1
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:34,040
Because we're in Vancouver
is daunting.

2
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,580
Who here for a second,
Jordan and

3
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,393
given me the honor of moderating this 
debate or discussion depending on how 

4
00:00:50,741 --> 00:00:55,741
you view it and I think that actually 
creates a certain kind of responsibility

5
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,750
and I want to talk to you about my 
responsibility and who I see it in my.

6
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:03,810
My sense of how you all have 
responsibility in this as well.

7
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,310
I suspect that what's going to happen 
tonight is actually historical,

8
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,300
which doesn't necessarily make it good 
as lots of

9
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,240
bad history.

10
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,190
It could be good though and that's what 
I'm hoping will happen.

11
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,413
So the reason I say I think it's 
historical is that we are existing in a 

12
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:22,134
moment where all of the systems that 
have helped us make sense are breaking 

13
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:26,880
down the university.

14
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,670
The students are breaking down,
journalism is breaking down

15
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:38,170
and at that same moment we have a 
network of people who are trying to make

16
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:40,364
sense in an alternative way.
And I have to say I think beating the 

17
00:01:42,831 --> 00:01:45,740
odds for the moment.
So here's the problem.

18
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,873
That network is not entirely in 
agreement with itself about some 

19
00:01:49,581 --> 00:01:52,850
significant issues in Sam and have some 
differences.

20
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:58,070
Very difficult.
So what could happen tonight is we could

21
00:01:58,071 --> 00:02:01,880
have some sort of a failure where things
get even more muddled.

22
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,910
We could tread water,
we're nothing gets clearer.

23
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,190
Maybe it would be entertaining,
maybe it wouldn't,

24
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:08,413
but best case scenario is that we figure
out how to make sense of things that 

25
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:13,124
have gotten in our way before.
And if that happens then you all will 

26
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:20,330
leave here and as you talk in your 
various networks,

27
00:02:20,331 --> 00:02:21,164
you will have something to say about in 
what way we upgraded our software so 

28
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:28,220
that we could talk more deeply about 
difficult issues.

29
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,113
So and to that end we would ask that you
not film tonight's discussion and 

30
00:02:35,361 --> 00:02:38,690
broadcast and online.
It's not that we want to hide this.

31
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:43,691
In fact we encourage you to discuss it,
but we would like to have all of us feel

32
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,593
maximally free to speak here to try out 
positions that we haven't tried out 

33
00:02:49,281 --> 00:02:52,610
before in the hopes that we can get 
somewhere new.

34
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:53,823
All right,
so

35
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,073
see if we can head towards some of the 
discussions that have difficult in the 

36
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,263
past.

37
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,603
Yeah,

38
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,383
I think I'll just start by saying that
when we first had the idea to do this 

39
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:30,090
now some months ago,
and I'm getting a little reverb,

40
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,800
so if you can dial down then there's a 
white one,

41
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:39,350
Jordan I first designed to do is you do 
an event together was after we did those

42
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,063
somewhat ill fated podcasts and I joke 
that we would probably need a safe word 

43
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,250
for this event.

44
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,083
So

45
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,920
that safe word as will come as no 
surprise is lobster.

46
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,100
So

47
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,741
No,
you'll know,

48
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:01,750
things are dire when one of us says says
that,

49
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,413
but I,
you know,

50
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,943
I just want to express my motive for a
helping to stage these events into it 

51
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:11,640
because I,
you know,

52
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,490
I,
I reached out to Jordan,

53
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,533
um,

54
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,083
it really was born of him in 
conversation with people other than 

55
00:04:20,031 --> 00:04:22,820
myself.
I saw him do a podcast with Joe Rogan.

56
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:23,654
I saw him speak to Dave Rubin as I'm 
speaking with Brett on Rogan's podcast 

57
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,323
and I had so much admiration for him in 
those conversations is 90 percent of 

58
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,264
what he said in those conversations 
struck me as really wise and useful and 

59
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:43,730
well intentioned and 10 percent didn't.
And but I,

60
00:04:43,731 --> 00:04:44,564
and I noticed that it was clear to me 
that I am seeing these successful 

61
00:04:48,661 --> 00:04:51,090
conversations with other people who I 
respect.

62
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,840
I began to wonder that,
you know,

63
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,530
I might be the problem
and I,

64
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:58,680
I think I,
I think I am the problem.

65
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,090
Before you applied,
maybe I didn't mean that quite the way

66
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,043
took it.

67
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,063
I think it's,
I think it's a good sort of problem for 

68
00:05:13,501 --> 00:05:14,334
Jordan to have because it's what happens
on those 10 percent moments and what 

69
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:24,120
doesn't happen that I think made our 
conversations so hard and,

70
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,120
and I think there is stuff to clarify 
between us.

71
00:05:27,121 --> 00:05:29,760
So I look forward to doing that.
And thank you Jordan,

72
00:05:29,761 --> 00:05:30,594
for agreeing to do this.
It's an honor to share the stage with 

73
00:05:32,371 --> 00:05:35,040
you and needless to say,
having Brett as a moderator is a,

74
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,683
almost an obscene underestimation of the
role he should be playing at any stage 

75
00:05:42,061 --> 00:05:42,894
because he,
as you know,

76
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,020
he's been on my podcast and that was one
of the best conversations I've ever had.

77
00:05:46,021 --> 00:05:47,370
So thank you for doing this.

78
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,810
Thanks.

79
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:05,270
Alright,
so I'm going to jump right into it.

80
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:08,570
I think you're.
So look,

81
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:09,404
this is.
I put up a poll a couple of days ago to 

82
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:12,254
find out what people broadly speaking 
might want us to discuss and I'd been 

83
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:17,570
taking a look at that and I took a lot 
of notes,

84
00:06:17,571 --> 00:06:20,180
which is why I have my computer here by 
the way on my phone.

85
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:22,180
It's not to check my email.
Well,

86
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,053
the debates going on the discussion.
I thought what I might do is just lay 

87
00:06:27,191 --> 00:06:31,970
out some places that I think Sam and I 
agree and because there's lots of places

88
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:36,530
we agree and so and then I want to 
figure out where we disagree,

89
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:39,680
which I've been trying to sort out and 
then I want to see if we can hash it out

90
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:41,780
a little bit and move forward on that a 
bit.

91
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:43,730
So I'm going to lay out.

92
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,970
See,
one of the things that Carl Rogers said,

93
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:47,804
this psych psych psychologist was that 
one good way to have a discussion with 

94
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:51,674
someone is to tell them what you think 
they think until they think that what 

95
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:58,570
you said reflects what they said.
We'd like.

96
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,413
This is really useful thing to know if 
you're ever having a discussion with an 

97
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:02,324
intimate partner for example,
is that you have to put their argument 

98
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:06,740
back to them in terms they agree with.
It's very difficult.

99
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,160
So I'm going to try to do that.
And so.

100
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:12,830
So the first thing is,
I think,

101
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,640
I think that partly what's driving you,
if,

102
00:07:15,641 --> 00:07:16,910
if,
if this is accurate,

103
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:21,911
is that you want to ground a structure 
of ethics in something solid and,

104
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:23,674
and there's two,
there's two things you want to avoid to 

105
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:27,734
catastrophes.
Let's say one is the catastrophe that 

106
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:30,494
you identified with religious 
fundamentalism and the other is the 

107
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:35,600
catastrophe that's associated with moral
relativism.

108
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,890
Is that,
is that reasonable?

109
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:37,724
Yeah,
that's good.

110
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,420
Okay,
good.

111
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,350
Good.
Okay.

112
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:40,184
Well,

113
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,053
okay.
So it's crucially crucially important 

114
00:07:46,561 --> 00:07:47,394
that we get this right now.
So that's something that I think we 

115
00:07:50,491 --> 00:07:51,324
really agree on because I've 
conceptualized that slightly different 

116
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:55,074
than you and that might be relevant,
but I think of that as a pathology of 

117
00:07:58,021 --> 00:07:58,854
order and a pathology of chaos.
So the terminology is slightly 

118
00:08:01,591 --> 00:08:02,424
different,
but I think we're working on the same 

119
00:08:03,271 --> 00:08:04,860
axis.
So,

120
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,720
so,
so that's the first thing.

121
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:07,643
And then in order to do that,
it seems to me that's your first 

122
00:08:11,971 --> 00:08:12,804
priority.
Then maybe your second priority is 

123
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,440
something like,
you know,

124
00:08:16,441 --> 00:08:20,430
you see undue suffering in the world,
plenty of it,

125
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:21,983
and you would think that things would be
better if that wasn't the case and that 

126
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:27,743
this morality,
whatever it's going to be is at least 

127
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:31,554
going to ground itself in part on the 
presupposition that the less undue 

128
00:08:36,151 --> 00:08:37,740
suffering in the world,
the better.

129
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,020
So is that also reasonable?

130
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,150
I would just add to that the positive 
side of the continuum as well.

131
00:08:44,151 --> 00:08:44,984
So as you know the phrase,
I use the word I use for this as well 

132
00:08:48,251 --> 00:08:51,920
being,
and I know from having.

133
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,990
I don't think we spoke about this on my 
podcast,

134
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,770
but from having seen in other 
interviews,

135
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:56,604
I think you think that phrase doesn't 
capture everything one could reasonably 

136
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:03,390
want,
but I think it does.

137
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:04,230
I mean I've just,
you know,

138
00:09:04,231 --> 00:09:04,550
it's,
it's,

139
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,760
it's an elastic suitcase term for a 
reason and it's,

140
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:08,973
it's actually in reading your book,
I realize there's a point of contact 

141
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:12,294
here because you used the word being 
capital b been with as though it were 

142
00:09:16,591 --> 00:09:19,430
imbued with significant gravitas.
And

143
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,860
so for me,
and I agree with you,

144
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:23,694
that's an inappropriate use of,
of being a and for me wellbeing is 

145
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:30,190
simply just the positive side of being,
you know,

146
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,440
there's,
there's the negative side,

147
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:32,274
the suffering we want to mitigate.
But I think I think however good 

148
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,653
consciousness can be in this universe,
that the wellbeing for me subsumes all 

149
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:42,264
of those possibilities.

150
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,801
Okay,
well,

151
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:43,634
so,
so I focused on the suffering element I 

152
00:09:45,201 --> 00:09:46,034
think as I've done in my own work 
because I actually think it's easier to 

153
00:09:48,741 --> 00:09:51,560
zero in on in some sense,
like I think it's easier for people.

154
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,530
And I think you lay out the argument in 
the moral landscape kind of like this.

155
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:59,210
I think it's easier perhaps to gain 
initial agreement between people on what

156
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:03,680
might constitute a generalized ethic to 
concentrate on what we don't want.

157
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,410
I'm not saying that what we do want is 
unimportant,

158
00:10:06,411 --> 00:10:08,420
but it seems to me to be harder to get a
grip on.

159
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,810
We don't want to Auschwitz,
we don't want to go like archipelago.

160
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,153
So.
And

161
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,203
there are those and I would add to just 
closing the door to moral relativism 

162
00:10:16,761 --> 00:10:19,820
here.
Those who do want Auschwitz are wrong to

163
00:10:19,821 --> 00:10:20,680
want Auschwitz.
I mean,

164
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,170
obviously it's only happened because 
some people did want Auschwitz,

165
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:27,050
not the victim side,
but the perpetrator side.

166
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,280
And so crucially for me is the claim 
that

167
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,740
I'm a realist.
I'm a moral realist and realism means is

168
00:10:36,741 --> 00:10:37,574
that it's that there are right and wrong
answers to the question of this kind 

169
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,943
and,
and you can not know what you're 

170
00:10:42,381 --> 00:10:43,041
missing.
In fact,

171
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:43,874
we almost certainly don't know what 
we're missing on questions of human 

172
00:10:46,401 --> 00:10:49,880
value.
And then our job is to discover just how

173
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:50,714
good life can be and just what variables
are making it needlessly horrible and 

174
00:10:54,831 --> 00:10:58,160
to,
to mitigate all of that and live in a,

175
00:10:58,230 --> 00:10:59,960
in a better and better world.

176
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,981
Well,
so.

177
00:11:00,981 --> 00:11:01,500
Okay,

178
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,333
so,

179
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:06,460
okay,
so,

180
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,200
so that's,
that's a lot of points of agreement.

181
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:14,201
So I also believe that there is a 
catastrophe of,

182
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,533
of arbitrary moral injunction and that 
there is a catastrophe of moral 

183
00:11:18,981 --> 00:11:20,940
relativism and that,
that,

184
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,863
that has to be dealt with and that there
are genuine differences between the 

185
00:11:26,661 --> 00:11:30,560
proper way of behaving morally and the 
improper way of behaving morally.

186
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,800
And I think that they are grounded in 
human human universals,

187
00:11:33,801 --> 00:11:37,580
even though there's a wide amount of 
variation so that that's a lot of points

188
00:11:37,581 --> 00:11:38,331
of agreement,
right?

189
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:41,240
So we know that there's two things we 
want to avoid.

190
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:42,973
We conceptually speaking,
which is the most moral relativism in 

191
00:11:46,221 --> 00:11:47,054
this kind of moral absolutism that's 
grounded in an arbitrary statement of 

192
00:11:51,051 --> 00:11:53,210
facts that you identify with religious 
fundamentalism.

193
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,200
I would identify that with fungilin 
fundamentalism more generally,

194
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,063
not,
not with religious fundamentalism per 

195
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,950
se,
because I see it also happening,

196
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,400
happening in secular states,
let's say like Nazi Germany or or,

197
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,283
or so.
It doesn't seem to be religious 

198
00:12:05,651 --> 00:12:08,170
fundamentalism per se.
That's crucial to your argument.

199
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,103
No,
it's not.

200
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,493
Just to close the loop on that,
the only reason why I would focus on 

201
00:12:13,461 --> 00:12:18,461
religion in particular there is that 
religion is the only language game where

202
00:12:19,131 --> 00:12:24,131
in fundamentalism and of dogmatism,
dogmatism is not a pejorative concept.

203
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:26,523
A Dogma is a good word,
and specifically within Catholicism and 

204
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,453
the notion that you must believe things 
on faith that is in the absence of 

205
00:12:34,281 --> 00:12:37,550
compelling evidence that would otherwise
cause a rational person to believe it.

206
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,570
That in a religious context is 
considered a feature,

207
00:12:41,571 --> 00:12:42,404
not a bug elsewhere.
We recognize it to be a bug and that's 

208
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,120
why the

209
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,383
focus on.
Okay,

210
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,273
so,
so,

211
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,490
so.
All right.

212
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,070
So is it reasonable to assume that the 
associate,

213
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,200
we've already established,
at least in principle,

214
00:12:54,201 --> 00:12:57,850
that there's an association between the 
totalitarian regimes,

215
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,170
let's say,
and a dog and dogmatism,

216
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,840
dogmatism that characterize his 
religious belief.

217
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,890
What do you think,
although it,

218
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,743
at least in principle,
the secularist totalitarian states and 

219
00:13:09,381 --> 00:13:12,920
the religious fundamentalists,
totalitarian states do different,

220
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,590
one important regard,
which is that the religious types ground

221
00:13:15,591 --> 00:13:19,670
their axioms in God and the secular 
totalitarian types don't.

222
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,743
And so there's got to be something about
totalitarianism per se that's 

223
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:24,734
independent of,
that's associated with religious belief 

224
00:13:27,651 --> 00:13:28,484
in the manner that you just described,
but that's not particularly associated 

225
00:13:31,341 --> 00:13:33,440
with the belief in God.
There's something that makes them,

226
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,453
it's a commonality between them.
And so do you have any sense of what 

227
00:13:36,921 --> 00:13:37,760
that might be?

228
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,233
Well,
I,

229
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,840
I think one has to acknowledge that 
there's something uniquely pernicious,

230
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:48,364
at least potentially about religious 
beliefs because they have the other 

231
00:13:52,571 --> 00:13:55,720
worldly variable,
the supernatural variable.

232
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,790
The,
uh,

233
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:00,610
you're gonna get everything you want 
after you die.

234
00:14:00,611 --> 00:14:04,150
So this life doesn't matter.
Issue that,

235
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:09,580
that allows for a kind of misbehavior 
that is especially.

236
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,231
Okay.
So,

237
00:14:10,231 --> 00:14:14,000
so it seems that,
so that the claim would be that if you,

238
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:17,630
if you put forward axiomatically your 
claim that God exists,

239
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,493
then you can use that claim to justify 
whatever arbitrary atrocities your 

240
00:14:22,971 --> 00:14:24,170
system might throw off.

241
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:25,443
Yeah,
I guess the only point I was making 

242
00:14:26,471 --> 00:14:27,304
there is that not all dogmas are created
equal and some dogmas are on their face 

243
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,290
more dangerous and more divisive.

244
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,373
Right?
But what I'm curious about specifically 

245
00:14:34,851 --> 00:14:35,684
is because it seems to me that the 
dogmas of the USSR and the dogmas of 

246
00:14:38,601 --> 00:14:39,434
Nazi Germany where as pernicious as any 
religious dog dogmas and they may also 

247
00:14:44,211 --> 00:14:46,740
share important features with pernicious
religious candles,

248
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,693
but it isn't clear to me from your 
perspective what those commonalities 

249
00:14:50,811 --> 00:14:51,644
would.

250
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,813
Well,
so I mean in some ways your 

251
00:14:55,601 --> 00:14:56,434
recapitulated in an argument I've made,
and this is an argument that I would 

252
00:14:58,641 --> 00:14:59,474
make against you.
Were you declaim as you've had you have 

253
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:02,654
elsewhere that,
that atheism is responsible for the 

254
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:09,230
greatest atrocities of the 20th century.
The idea that Stalin,

255
00:15:09,231 --> 00:15:10,064
Ism and Nazi-ism and fascism were 
expressions of atheism simply doesn't 

256
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:17,980
make any sense in the case of fascism 
and Nazis,

257
00:15:17,981 --> 00:15:20,750
and it doesn't make any sense because 
the fascists and the Nazis,

258
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:22,200
by and large,
we're not even atheist,

259
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,073
mean Hitler wasn't an atheist and he was
talking about executing a divine plan 

260
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:27,584
and he got lots of support from the 
churches and the Vatican did nothing to 

261
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,420
stop him.
And Fascism as you know,

262
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,673
a coexisted quite happily with 
Catholicism in Croatia and Portugal and 

263
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:40,700
Spain and Italy.
So,

264
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:41,563
but even in the case of stolen,
what was so wrong with that situation 

265
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:49,040
was where all of the ways in which it's 
so resembled a religion.

266
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:52,220
You had a personality cult.
You had dogmatism,

267
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,720
uh,
that,

268
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:54,763
uh,
held sway to a point where apostasy and 

269
00:15:57,891 --> 00:15:59,870
blasts with me,
we're killing offenses.

270
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,520
You know,
that the people who,

271
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,383
who,
who didn't toe the line were eradicated 

272
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:09,320
and you know,
so and so to take a more modern example,

273
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:10,154
North Korea is a religious cult.
It just doesn't happen to be a one that 

274
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,110
is focused on the next life or,
or,

275
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:20,170
you know,
supernatural claims.

276
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,650
So what we imagined if.
Okay,

277
00:16:21,651 --> 00:16:22,484
so what would be the defining 
characteristics of a religious 

278
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,483
totalitarian movement that would make it
different from a nonreligious 

279
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:28,580
totalitarian movement?

280
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,761
Similar.
Yeah.

281
00:16:30,761 --> 00:16:31,180
They may,
yeah,

282
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,340
they're very similar,
but the problem is dogmatism.

283
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,810
The overarching problem is believing 
things strongly on bad evidence and B,

284
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,673
b,
and the reason why dogmatism is so 

285
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,213
dangerous is that it is,
it doesn't allow us to revise our bad 

286
00:16:47,141 --> 00:16:47,974
ideas in real time through conversation.
It is dogmas have to be enforced by 

287
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,313
force or the threat of force.
Because the moment someone has a better 

288
00:16:55,361 --> 00:16:56,194
idea,
you have to shut it down in order to 

289
00:16:58,211 --> 00:16:58,940
preserve your dog.

290
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,661
Okay.
Okay.

291
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:01,700
So,
so the commonality seems to be something

292
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:05,150
like claims of absolute truth at some 
level that can't be,

293
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,970
that you're no longer allowed to 
discuss.

294
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,021
Yeah.
Okay.

295
00:17:09,021 --> 00:17:09,651
And so,
okay,

296
00:17:09,651 --> 00:17:11,660
so that's another point of agreement.
Then I would say,

297
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:13,730
because part of the reason that I've 
been,

298
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,593
let's say a free speech advocate,
although I don't think that's the right 

299
00:17:16,431 --> 00:17:19,990
way of thinking about it,
just because I think of free discourse,

300
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:24,370
the discourse that we're engaged in as 
the mechanism that corrects totalitarian

301
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:25,204
excess or dogmatic excess,
and so I also think that systems of 

302
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:32,690
governance that are laying themselves 
out properly have to evaluate,

303
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,793
have to elevate the process by which 
dogmatic errors are corrected over the 

304
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:38,564
dogmas themselves,
which is why I think the Americans are 

305
00:17:40,701 --> 00:17:42,770
right,
say with regard to their first amendment

306
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:43,843
is the process of free speech is the 
process by which dogmatic errors are 

307
00:17:46,671 --> 00:17:49,190
rectified.
And so it has to be put at the pinnacle,

308
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,310
the hierarchy of values.

309
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,030
I think you and I totally agree about 
the primacy of free speech.

310
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,151
Okay.
Okay,

311
00:17:55,151 --> 00:17:55,661
good.
Okay,

312
00:17:55,661 --> 00:17:56,494
so that's another.

313
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:03,050
Thank you.

314
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,660
Okay,
so then we could think there's

315
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,560
point that we should just a lock in our 
gains here.

316
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,663
It sounds like what you're saying is 
that the reason to fear religious dogma 

317
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,300
is really on the dogma side and not the 
religion side,

318
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:19,134
which at least leaves open the 
possibility that something could exist 

319
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,650
over on the religion side that doesn't 
have that characteristic.

320
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,080
Right.
That often they travel in tandem,

321
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,990
but that the thing to fear is not the 
religious belief.

322
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,030
It is the dogmatic nature of the way it 
is.

323
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,003
The other way to say that is the only 
thing that's wrong with religion is the 

324
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:40,660
dogmatism.
If you get rid of the dog,

325
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,630
I've got no problem with the buildings 
and the music and the and the

326
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,270
Dan's and.
Wait,

327
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,223
wait,
wait,

328
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,670
wait a minute,
wait a minute.

329
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,833
That's not a trivial.
It's not a trivial point and it's not 

330
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:51,534
just a joke because the buildings and 
the music are very important parts of 

331
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:55,584
their religious process and so I know,
I know there's a humorous element to 

332
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,004
that,
but it's not like Sam is throwing out 

333
00:19:00,091 --> 00:19:01,410
the baby with the bathwater there

334
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,370
and to go further than that.
I've got no problem.

335
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:06,204
In fact,
I'm deeply interested in the 

336
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:09,290
phenomenology of spiritual experience,
so,

337
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:13,050
so whatever experience,
someone like Jesus had,

338
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,930
whoever he was historically or any of 
the other,

339
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,050
uh,
Matriarchs and Patriarchs of the world's

340
00:19:19,051 --> 00:19:24,051
religions,
that phenomenology is subjectively real.

341
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,860
I mean,
that is diverse.

342
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:27,510
I'm not saying everyone's had the same 
experience,

343
00:19:27,511 --> 00:19:28,344
but there are changes in consciousness 
that explain both how religions have 

344
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,504
gotten founded by their founders and the
experiences people have had in the 

345
00:19:38,641 --> 00:19:39,474
presence of those people or by following
their methodologies that seemed to be 

346
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:46,140
confirming of the dog.
But that got,

347
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:49,510
that grew up around those traditions.
And My,

348
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:53,610
my issue is that whatever is true about 
us spiritually,

349
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:58,680
whatever opportunity being born to this 
universe actually presented a matter of,

350
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,620
of consciousness,
a spiritually,

351
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:07,200
that truth has to be deeper than 
accidents of culture.

352
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:11,730
And just mere historical contingency is 
the fact that somebody was born in,

353
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:16,470
in Mesopotamia and not in China and got 
a different language game.

354
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,470
Uh,
so whatever is true,

355
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:20,304
there has to be understood in universal 
terms about the nature of human 

356
00:20:23,611 --> 00:20:25,680
psychology and the human mind.

357
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:26,720
Okay.
So,

358
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,950
so now another thing that I wanted to 
just point out obliquely and then I want

359
00:20:30,951 --> 00:20:34,070
to return to outlining maybe where we 
agree is that

360
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,970
one of the things that was really 
shocking to me,

361
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:38,804
I would say was the my reading of what 
was originally Jane Goodall's discovery 

362
00:20:43,851 --> 00:20:45,080
about chimp behavior.
You know,

363
00:20:45,081 --> 00:20:45,914
because there is this idea that is 
really in Rousseau in thinking that the 

364
00:20:49,121 --> 00:20:53,620
reason that people committed atrocities 
in the service of their group identity,

365
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:57,760
let's say their tribal identity was 
because culture had corruptive.

366
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:58,603
So it was a uniquely human thing.
But then of course good all showed in 

367
00:21:02,381 --> 00:21:05,530
the 19 seventies that the chimps at 
Gombe,

368
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,400
I think I'm pronouncing that correctly,
would go and raiding parties.

369
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:10,234
Right.
And so there'd be like four or five 

370
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,360
adolescent chimps,
usually male,

371
00:21:13,361 --> 00:21:14,194
sometimes with a female in there.
They would patrol the borders of their 

372
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:17,524
territory if they found an interloper on
the border near the border from another 

373
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,713
troop,
even if it was a member of their troop 

374
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,520
that had immigrated,
so to speak,

375
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,830
and that they knew that they had had 
some history with.

376
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,903
They would tear them to pieces.
And of course that was shocking to good 

377
00:21:33,111 --> 00:21:33,944
old buddy and my understanding is she 
had some trepidations about publishing 

378
00:21:37,721 --> 00:21:38,590
it,
although she did,

379
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,420
but then that's been noted repeatedly in
other forms of behavior.

380
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:44,263
So see,
I've been really interested in the 

381
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:48,910
commission of atrocity in the surface of
belief,

382
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,493
and it's tempting to pin that say on on 
Dogma and then to associate that with 

383
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:57,130
religious dogma.
I think that's all tempting,

384
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,293
but the fact that chimps do it shows 
that it can't be a consequence of 

385
00:22:02,441 --> 00:22:03,274
something like religious belief unless 
you're willing to say that the reason 

386
00:22:06,011 --> 00:22:06,844
that chimps commit a trustee in the 
service of their truth and their 

387
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,773
territory is because chimps are 
religious and so they're not religious 

388
00:22:13,841 --> 00:22:16,700
and they don't really hold a secular 
totalitarian viewpoint,

389
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,040
but they act out.
They still act out the atrocity element.

390
00:22:21,041 --> 00:22:23,230
That's characteristic of human behavior.
And so to me,

391
00:22:23,231 --> 00:22:26,350
that makes the problem deeper than one 
of mirror,

392
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,440
let's say surface statements surface.

393
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:30,503
It's of metaphysics.
The obviously the problem of primate 

394
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,823
aggression,
which we've inherited along with the 

395
00:22:37,021 --> 00:22:40,920
Shims,
is deeper or at least different than the

396
00:22:40,921 --> 00:22:41,754
problem of religious violence or,
or totalitarian political structure is 

397
00:22:46,781 --> 00:22:47,380
that,
okay,

398
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,650
get the worst out data people.
So,

399
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:50,880
uh,
I mean we have,

400
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:51,743
we have these primate capacities that we
have to correct for and we're busily 

401
00:22:55,051 --> 00:22:55,884
trying to correct for almost everything 
that we've have been evolved to do and 

402
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:02,400
we're not w w we don't like the state of
nature for good reason.

403
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:07,700
And virtually everything that's good 
about human life is born of our,

404
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,760
I would argue,
culture based and,

405
00:23:10,761 --> 00:23:13,890
and highly intelligent,
unnecessary effort to,

406
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:18,030
to mitigate what is in fact natural for 
us and that,

407
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,310
and there's nothing more natural than 
tribal violence,

408
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,590
which you have the source.
You're,

409
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,920
you're describing a chance.

410
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:23,551
Okay.
So,

411
00:23:23,551 --> 00:23:28,551
so then it also seems like we agree that
the core element of tribal alliance,

412
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,150
which would have its roots say and in 
the chimpanzee proclivity to,

413
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,133
or it's analog and the chimpanzee 
proclivity to identify with the 

414
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,283
dominance hierarchy of the troop is 
something that's a source of the 

415
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,363
proclivity for human social aggression.
That's independent of it's at in 

416
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,900
independent of any obvious religious 
substrate.

417
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,123
So there are other reasons for group 
belief and the Commission of a trustee 

418
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:55,550
that can't be directly attributed to two
religious dogma.

419
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,493
What most worries me about religion and 
I was able to obviously religion can 

420
00:24:00,821 --> 00:24:05,821
channel these primal urges in unhappy 
ways so you can get tribal violence that

421
00:24:06,881 --> 00:24:10,120
gets amplified by religious dogmatism 
and that should trouble everyone,

422
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,890
but it's not unique to religion is also 
nationalism and his racism and his other

423
00:24:14,891 --> 00:24:19,750
kinds of dogmatism.
But what most worries me are those cases

424
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:20,584
where clearly good people who are not 
necessarily captured by tribalism per 

425
00:24:27,491 --> 00:24:28,730
se,
uh,

426
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,960
are doing the unthinkable based purely 
on religious doctrines that they believe

427
00:24:35,771 --> 00:24:37,990
wholeheartedly with without good 
evidence.

428
00:24:37,991 --> 00:24:38,824
So you have the person who joins isis 
who wasn't even Muslim before they 

429
00:24:43,391 --> 00:24:44,170
converted,
you know,

430
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,003
16 months ago.
And they go all the way down the rabbit 

431
00:24:48,101 --> 00:24:51,280
hole to the,
the most doctrinaire,

432
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:55,120
most committed,
most uncompromising view of just how you

433
00:24:55,121 --> 00:24:55,954
have to live in this world.
If you're going to be Muslim and they 

434
00:24:58,901 --> 00:25:03,901
join isis based on the idea that 
salvation only goes one way and the dine

435
00:25:05,861 --> 00:25:06,694
and defends it,
the one true faith is the best thing 

436
00:25:08,621 --> 00:25:09,454
that can happen to you.

437
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,580
There's no question that there are 
individuals who have made that journey.

438
00:25:12,581 --> 00:25:13,414
In fact,
there are individuals by the thousands 

439
00:25:14,201 --> 00:25:17,980
who have made that journey and they're 
far more benign versions of that.

440
00:25:17,981 --> 00:25:19,510
There are people who just waste their 
lives.

441
00:25:19,511 --> 00:25:20,344
I would argue converting to whatever the
belief system is and just wasting a lot 

442
00:25:23,111 --> 00:25:23,944
of time worrying about hell or warning 
about the fact that their child is gay 

443
00:25:28,871 --> 00:25:29,611
and the,
you know,

444
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,870
the creator of the universe doesn't 
approve of that,

445
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,103
and Oh,
there are all kinds of suffering that 

446
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,610
striked me as truly unnecessary born.
Not of,

447
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,340
again,
apelike urges,

448
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:47,670
but ideas that any rational person would
if believed,

449
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:51,190
would,
would follow to that same terminus.

450
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,620
I mean,
the thing is if you buy,

451
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:59,070
if you buy the fact again to take Islam 
as as a current example,

452
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,063
if you buy the claim that the Koran is 
the perfect word of the creator of the 

453
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,104
universe,
never to be superseded by anything 

454
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,833
humanity does now or a thousand years 
from now that commits a rational per 

455
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:14,523
that then then the exercise of human 
reason is bounded by this I would argue 

456
00:26:18,941 --> 00:26:19,774
pathological frame which leads to 
certain outcomes that we should really 

457
00:26:23,351 --> 00:26:24,184
worry us.

458
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,343
So let's take that claim apart for a 
minute because that's not your claim 

459
00:26:29,141 --> 00:26:31,330
specifically the claim that you were 
describing.

460
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,463
See because that's.
That's really not the claim that 

461
00:26:34,841 --> 00:26:35,674
religious fundamentalists make.
The claim they make is worse than that 

462
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,413
because they claim that the Koran or the
Bible for that matter is the literal 

463
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:50,580
word of God,
but more than that,

464
00:26:50,581 --> 00:26:55,020
they claimed that their understanding of
that word is correct.

465
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,213
Which means they conflate two things.
Because you could imagine a situation 

466
00:26:59,071 --> 00:27:01,350
where you had a book,
and I'm not saying this is the case.

467
00:27:01,351 --> 00:27:05,520
It's an imaginative exercise where you 
had a book that had all the answers that

468
00:27:05,521 --> 00:27:08,850
was extraordinarily complicated and so 
that when you read it,

469
00:27:08,851 --> 00:27:09,684
it wouldn't be obvious that you 
understood it or perhaps it wouldn't be 

470
00:27:11,971 --> 00:27:13,530
obvious that you didn't understand it 
either,

471
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:18,531
but you're not going to be able to.
You can't get an interpretive version of

472
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:20,364
the book,
and so the fundamentalists claim is far 

473
00:27:22,111 --> 00:27:22,944
worse.
It's that not only is there an absolute 

474
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,343
reality truth embedded in the book,
but that their particular take on that 

475
00:27:28,351 --> 00:27:31,530
absolute reality is the absolute take on
that book.

476
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,930
So they conflate their own.
They,

477
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:34,773
they,
they make an assumption of their own 

478
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:39,070
omniscience and then pass that off 
quantic

479
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:41,230
yeah,
except in their defense,

480
00:27:41,231 --> 00:27:43,720
and I don't often rise to the defense of
fundamentalist.

481
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,450
It's,
it's very easy to get there because some

482
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:54,290
of the claims in the book are not at all
hard to parse.

483
00:27:54,291 --> 00:27:55,124
In fact,
many of them can only be honestly 

484
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,800
interpreted one way.
So to take again an example that will be

485
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:05,510
not inflammatory to you but makes the 
point.

486
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,573
It just says that the remedy for theft 
in the Koran is to cut the hands off a 

487
00:28:12,741 --> 00:28:14,300
thief,
me that you,

488
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:18,770
that that is the unambiguous injunction.
It's not an allegory,

489
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,293
so the you have to.
You have to dodge some kind of tortured 

490
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,663
interpretive scheme to avoid the that 
the shocking fact that the creator of 

491
00:28:33,681 --> 00:28:36,170
the universe,
he thinks you should live this way for,

492
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,080
for all time,
and people like Isis.

493
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,073
I mean this is my claim,
is this most of what is in these books 

494
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:47,990
and this is what worries me about those 
books because they can't be edited.

495
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,680
Most of what's in the books is clearly 
not the best that humanity is capable of

496
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,780
in the ethical domain or in the

497
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,713
so

498
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,190
and and so and so clearly,
and this is true for morality,

499
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:10,260
most pressingly,
but it's true for science,

500
00:29:10,261 --> 00:29:12,640
is true for economic,
is true for anything else that we,

501
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:13,523
we are wise to pay attention to.
Say Slavery is condoned in the Bible in 

502
00:29:21,271 --> 00:29:24,840
both testaments and in the Koran.
There's no getting away from that.

503
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:26,130
Now you can say,
well,

504
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:28,590
it's not the central thrust of any of 
these books,

505
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,920
but if you,
if you go to the books and try to figure

506
00:29:31,921 --> 00:29:32,754
out what the creator of the universe 
wants with respect to the owning and 

507
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,560
needless immiseration of other people,
right?

508
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:43,420
He expects you to keep slaves and he's 
told you how to do it.

509
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,413
You know,
don't knock out their eyes and their 

510
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:46,114
teeth.

511
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:51,910
You don't take if you're a Muslim,
don't take other Muslims as slaves,

512
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,103
but it's not an accident that the people
who joined Isis thought that it was 

513
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,440
absolutely kosher to take slaves to take
sex slaves,

514
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:04,803
and they were even there.
Their use of their sex slaves was 

515
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,910
conducted as a sacrament and that's not 
an accident.

516
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:13,744
I mean,
they weren't getting grain over there 

517
00:30:14,801 --> 00:30:17,500
that the Fed girls before they raped 
them.

518
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:18,883
So these,
this is not unlike what many people 

519
00:30:22,031 --> 00:30:22,864
expect.
It's not that this doctrine is being 

520
00:30:27,281 --> 00:30:28,114
used as a pretext for people who would 
otherwise do terrible things like take 

521
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:33,364
sex slaves and raped them.
And so there's no net damage being done 

522
00:30:38,591 --> 00:30:39,940
here by this belief system.
No,

523
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:42,490
these are.
I would argue in many cases,

524
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,353
psychologically normal people who are 
simply convinced of the absolute 

525
00:30:46,961 --> 00:30:47,794
veracity of these ideas and and in in 
this case that the perfect example of 

526
00:30:51,821 --> 00:30:52,654
Mohammed as the most self actualized 
human who's ever existed and what did 

527
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,270
Mohammed Mohammed Hooks.

528
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,430
Excellent,
so you know,

529
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,440
he and he's an and then once you,
once you grant that,

530
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,663
and this is,
I mean this is where there's a tension 

531
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:12,991
between both how we pursue the same 
goals as we've just established.

532
00:31:13,211 --> 00:31:14,044
We have many of the same goals,
but in so far as you make religion look 

533
00:31:18,851 --> 00:31:23,320
palatable in so far as you suggest to 
your audience that they can.

534
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,570
They can have their religious cake and 
eat it too.

535
00:31:25,571 --> 00:31:27,250
They can,
they can have their reason.

536
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,630
They can have their respect for science.
They can have a 21st century worldview,

537
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,493
but they can also hold on to everything 
they love and Christianity or fear to 

538
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:37,624
lose.
And it's undoubtedly mostly 

539
00:31:39,671 --> 00:31:41,710
Christianity,
but whatever,

540
00:31:41,711 --> 00:31:42,544
any religion.
My concern is that it keeps us shackled 

541
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,063
to these iron age philosophies and these
iron age conversations where we should 

542
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:56,620
be having a 21st century conversation 
about everything.

543
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,410
Ethics included.
Okay.

544
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,411
Okay.
So,

545
00:32:06,411 --> 00:32:09,830
so,
but I want to ask you a little bit about

546
00:32:09,831 --> 00:32:13,420
your feeling about weight before.
Before you move on,

547
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:17,720
I want to get each of you to clarify 
something so that we know we're where we

548
00:32:17,721 --> 00:32:18,860
are.
So Sam,

549
00:32:18,861 --> 00:32:23,000
you said the problem here is that the 
dogma can't be updated,

550
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:24,043
right?
That slavery is with us permanently 

551
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:26,144
because it's written into the dogma,
but clearly most of the traditions in 

552
00:32:28,371 --> 00:32:31,610
which it's written into the holy book 
don't practice slavery.

553
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,070
And the people who,
uh,

554
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:37,190
who adhere to these belief systems 
wouldn't defend slavery.

555
00:32:37,191 --> 00:32:40,250
So clearly there is the capacity,
an update mechanism,

556
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,750
but not really.
I mean,

557
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:44,090
they've been forced.
It had beaten out of them,

558
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:44,910
right?
I mean,

559
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:45,743
we,
we fought a civil war in the US to get 

560
00:32:47,991 --> 00:32:51,860
rid of slavery as Christians who 
abolished slavery in England though,

561
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:55,200
was that it was Christians who were at 
the forefront of the movement to abolish

562
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,060
Christians on either side of everything.
I mean there's,

563
00:32:58,061 --> 00:33:00,310
there's no one else to do the job,
but that's the update

564
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:06,963
with specifically Christians who were 
using their Christian belief as a 

565
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:10,114
justification for slavery.
The problem was they were actually on 

566
00:33:13,401 --> 00:33:13,590
the

567
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:17,320
losing side of a theological argument 
and it would be much better.

568
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:22,380
I think you would agree if one of the 10
commandments had been,

569
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,560
don't keep slaves.

570
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,613
Yeah.
I mean there's certainly one week of 

571
00:33:27,281 --> 00:33:29,450
swap out for that one,
so

572
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,343
it would've been much easier for 
Christians to have fought against 

573
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:37,150
slavery and it's much harder for Muslims
frankly,

574
00:33:37,151 --> 00:33:38,690
to to fight against it.
Now.

575
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:43,730
The problem is,
is that there's a point I made,

576
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:45,220
I think in my first book,
is that the,

577
00:33:45,221 --> 00:33:46,054
the doors leading out of this kind of 
fundamentalism don't open from the 

578
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:50,444
inside.
They get bashed open from the outside 

579
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,711
and it's,
it's,

580
00:33:53,711 --> 00:33:54,544
it's humanism and it's secularism and 
it's scientific rationality that has 

581
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:03,040
exerted such pressure,
such winnowing pressure on Christianity,

582
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:03,874
you know,
now for multiple centuries that that's 

583
00:34:06,831 --> 00:34:07,664
why we're not encountering the 
Christians of the 14th century on a 

584
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:11,120
daily basis.
The way that we,

585
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:15,200
we are essentially encountering Muslims 
of the 14th century,

586
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,473
a not only in the Middle East,
but in our own societies in terms of 

587
00:34:19,911 --> 00:34:21,890
their intuitions about how we should all
live,

588
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:22,370
right.
I mean,

589
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:27,370
the fact that zero percent of UK Muslims
think homosexuality is acceptable,

590
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,440
right?
Zero percent,

591
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,273
but there's almost no question you can 
come up with the where we could pull 

592
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,070
this,
this,

593
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:34,933
this society and say,
do you think that that the lizard king 

594
00:34:39,441 --> 00:34:41,360
is his living in the Oval Office,

595
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:43,271
you,
you,

596
00:34:43,271 --> 00:34:45,440
you never get a zero percent response to
any

597
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,490
poll question.
Right?

598
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:48,973
But

599
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,670
if you ask Muslims on the streets of 
London,

600
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,533
is homosexuality morally acceptable?
Apparently you can find no one who says 

601
00:34:57,771 --> 00:34:58,604
it is.
That's shocking and it's not an 

602
00:35:01,251 --> 00:35:02,150
accident.
Right?

603
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,190
And it would be much easier if the book 
actually said,

604
00:35:04,191 --> 00:35:08,420
actually you can love anyone you want 
and it's not a problem.

605
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,960
It is.
It is shocking.

606
00:35:09,961 --> 00:35:10,794
But I think you know,
there's a reason that you keep finding 

607
00:35:12,691 --> 00:35:13,524
yourself at Islam,
which may be the slowest to update for 

608
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:21,560
reasons that may be ancient,
but I want to do that.

609
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,100
That is a useful.

610
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,690
I can't do it for Christianity.
I just want to make the.

611
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,920
I want to make the point as cleanly and 
as undistracted loudly as possible.

612
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,090
But yeah,
it made it's true.

613
00:35:33,091 --> 00:35:37,920
I have the same kinds of concerns about 
Christianity or mormonism or or anything

614
00:35:37,921 --> 00:35:38,580
else.

615
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,413
And they're all.
The point is they're all different and 

616
00:35:40,201 --> 00:35:45,000
there's no reason to be because Islam to
take the case where it's fine.

617
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,350
Islam doesn't represent any impediment 
to stem cell research.

618
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,220
Right?
Because they just don't think that,

619
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,343
that,
that the design of the fertilized ovum 

620
00:35:54,241 --> 00:35:56,230
is immediately and sold.
They wait.

621
00:35:56,370 --> 00:36:00,330
It's 40 days or 80 days,
120 days depending on what you believe.

622
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:05,780
So it's just that never came up when we 
were all complaining about how religion,

623
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:06,893
in this case Orthodox Judaism and 
Christianity and in the states was 

624
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,790
posing and impediment to embryonic stem 
cell research.

625
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:13,510
Okay.
Hold on.

626
00:36:13,511 --> 00:36:16,690
I wanted to ask you a clarifying 
question to same level.

627
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,023
Would you agree that there are things 
written into these religious texts that 

628
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,733
are unambiguously unacceptable viewed 
through a modern lens and not because 

629
00:36:28,421 --> 00:36:31,840
the texts are so complicated that we 
have misunderstood something,

630
00:36:31,841 --> 00:36:32,674
but there are things that are just 
written in there that we now understand 

631
00:36:35,831 --> 00:36:36,664
to be wrong.

632
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,620
Okay.
So,

633
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,580
so the first thing,

634
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,083
the first thing I would say is that we 
have to be very careful about equating 

635
00:36:44,781 --> 00:36:45,614
all the religious texts and I do 
actually think that you are careful 

636
00:36:48,591 --> 00:36:49,424
about that,
but that's something we can have a 

637
00:36:50,631 --> 00:36:52,950
discussion about a little bit later.
I agree with you there.

638
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,280
So,
so because you know,

639
00:36:55,281 --> 00:36:57,410
for,
for a lot of my life I was,

640
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,483
I would say more interested in the 
universal truths expressed in religious 

641
00:37:02,301 --> 00:37:03,134
belief across different cultures.
But I've become more and more aware of 

642
00:37:06,201 --> 00:37:07,034
the important distinctions between the 
religious cultures maybe in the last 10 

643
00:37:10,881 --> 00:37:11,714
years.
So it isn't clear to me that you can 

644
00:37:12,681 --> 00:37:17,681
just throw all religious dictum dicta in
the same bucket and there may be complex

645
00:37:18,741 --> 00:37:19,760
reasons for that.
So,

646
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,520
you know,
one question which you kind of sent it,

647
00:37:22,521 --> 00:37:23,420
Sam already,
is,

648
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,613
do you see a hierarchy of 
unacceptability between different 

649
00:37:28,431 --> 00:37:31,060
religious doctrines?
You active.

650
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:31,640
Okay,
fine,

651
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,300
fine,
fine.

652
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,133
So,
okay,

653
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,270
now,
but here,

654
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,870
here's an interesting issue and I think 
we're starting to zero in on.

655
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,620
We've covered what we agreed on a lot of
it,

656
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,000
but there's another way to answer a 
question because I think.

657
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,003
Sorry,

658
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,130
sorry,

659
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:53,020
I answered the first half of it.
The second part is I think that

660
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:58,720
this is where I'm going to sound like a 
postmodernist,

661
00:37:58,721 --> 00:37:59,554
which I really hate.

662
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:08,570
I would say sentence by sentence.
Yes,

663
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:13,820
you're correct.
Paragraph by paragraph perhaps.

664
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,463
But here's,
here's the problem with complicated 

665
00:38:17,661 --> 00:38:19,820
texts,
especially ones that actually constitute

666
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:22,760
narratives.
So imagine,

667
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:23,683
imagine this.
So imagine you're at a movie and it's a 

668
00:38:26,391 --> 00:38:27,224
movie with a twist at the end.
And so the entire movie is set up to 

669
00:38:30,621 --> 00:38:33,860
make you think one particular way and to
have one set of experiences,

670
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:37,420
but when you put the twist at the end,
it changes the entire structure.

671
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,003
And so this is the one of the complex 
problems that actually led to the rise 

672
00:38:42,401 --> 00:38:44,650
of postmodern interpretations of 
literature,

673
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,350
which is that if you take a complex 
narrative,

674
00:38:47,351 --> 00:38:48,184
there's a very large number of ways of 
interpreting it and it isn't self 

675
00:38:51,671 --> 00:38:54,220
evident which of those are canonically 
correct.

676
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,160
We can deal with that horrible issue 
later,

677
00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:00,280
but.
But it's a good objection and it's true.

678
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,173
And what it does is it makes these sorts
of things quite complicated because in 

679
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:06,923
the Bible is a series of books and they 
had influence on one another and they 

680
00:39:11,651 --> 00:39:15,940
were sequenced with a very complex 
editorial process and there's actually a

681
00:39:15,941 --> 00:39:19,870
developmental narrative that links all 
the chapters together.

682
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:24,310
And what that means.
This is at least I'm going to speak from

683
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:28,300
the perspective or in terms of analysis 
of the Christian Bible.

684
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:34,500
What it means is that you have to read 
the beginning as if it's also influenced

685
00:39:36,761 --> 00:39:38,290
by the end,
which is what,

686
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:39,124
by the way,
in case you think that I'm weaseling 

687
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:45,490
around here and I'm not,
is that that's exactly what you do.

688
00:39:45,491 --> 00:39:48,130
Every time you read any story,
any work of fiction,

689
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,060
you say,
well,

690
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,220
you're claiming that the Bible is a work
of fiction.

691
00:39:51,221 --> 00:39:52,180
It's like,
don't don't.

692
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:54,730
That's,
that's just a cheap objection.

693
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:55,563
That's not my point.
My point is that it's a narrative and 

694
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:59,703
everything in a narrative is conditioned
by all the rest of the things in the 

695
00:40:02,711 --> 00:40:05,710
narrative and it is well known.
Like if you're a screenwriter,

696
00:40:05,711 --> 00:40:07,180
for example,
there's an old dictum,

697
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:11,170
remember who generate it was one of the 
great Russians that if there's a a rifle

698
00:40:11,171 --> 00:40:15,010
lying on a table in the first scene,
that it better be used by the end of the

699
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:17,080
second scene or it shouldn't have been 
there at all.

700
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,650
So there's this coherence.
I'm looking for the rifle in your answer

701
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:22,460
to this question,
one overused.

702
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,453
My point is is that it isn't reasonable 
to take a single sentence out of a 

703
00:40:29,141 --> 00:40:29,974
coherent narrative and say that stands 
on its own or it's rarely reasonable 

704
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:34,323
because you have to interpret the word 
in the sentence and the sentence in the 

705
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:38,434
paragraph and the paragraph in the 
chapter and the chapter in the context 

706
00:40:41,051 --> 00:40:44,380
of the entire book.
You have to do that now you could object

707
00:40:44,381 --> 00:40:45,214
and reasonably so that there are some 
sentences that are so blatant that you 

708
00:40:48,671 --> 00:40:52,870
can't use context to to what paraphrase 
them,

709
00:40:52,871 --> 00:40:53,704
let's say,
but I think you also have to give the 

710
00:40:55,031 --> 00:40:55,864
devil his due that the Christian Bible 
is a developmental narrative and the 

711
00:40:59,051 --> 00:41:02,100
beginning has to be read in light of the
end and that's a.

712
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,260
that's a.
that's a fact.

713
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,650
So what does that do to Moses's laws of 
war?

714
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,633
This is not a narrative.
This is instructions about what to do 

715
00:41:13,241 --> 00:41:17,770
when you invade a foreign land.
If you intend to take over that land,

716
00:41:17,771 --> 00:41:19,690
you kill every break,
right?

717
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:25,680
There are other rules in there about 
killing husbands and taking the wives.

718
00:41:25,961 --> 00:41:27,910
Yeah,
the old testaments are brutal document.

719
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:29,860
Absolutely brutal.
And so my point would be,

720
00:41:29,861 --> 00:41:33,830
I don't know that reading that portion,
um,

721
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,070
in

722
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,903
light of the end,
even if you call the end of the New 

723
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,053
Testament,
I don't know that it changes Moses's 

724
00:41:39,711 --> 00:41:44,180
laws of war and their acceptability 
while you take the new testament.

725
00:41:44,181 --> 00:41:46,490
Seriously.
It does because it's a suit.

726
00:41:46,491 --> 00:41:47,324
It's a document that supersedes it.
And I think there's actually technical 

727
00:41:50,001 --> 00:41:51,290
reasons but superseded.

728
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:52,763
I mean,
this is the problem.

729
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:57,190
Slavery is a very straightforward case 
because clearly the,

730
00:41:57,191 --> 00:41:59,710
the,
the Bible thumpers of the South who were

731
00:41:59,711 --> 00:42:04,240
defending slavery with reference to the 
text felt they were on firm ground.

732
00:42:04,241 --> 00:42:05,074
And I would just,
I would invite anyone to read what the 

733
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:07,683
New Testament and the Old Testament say 
about slavery to see that they were on 

734
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,770
fairly firm ground.
That the balance of the,

735
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,950
of the honest reading was on the side of
clearly we can,

736
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,180
we can keep slaves,
right?

737
00:42:19,181 --> 00:42:19,990
Jesus.
Jesus.

738
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:23,740
Jesus never envisioned a world without 
slavery.

739
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,633
And he admonished slaves to serve their 
masters well and to serve their 

740
00:42:27,101 --> 00:42:28,540
Christian masters especially.
Well,

741
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,040
the English Protestants wouldn't have 
agreed with that because like I said,

742
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:33,780
they were at the forefront of the fight 
against slavery.

743
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:34,723
Okay.

744
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:37,840
Clean influenced by something outside 
the text.

745
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:42,900
And this is began as you're making this 
harder than it is.

746
00:42:43,271 --> 00:42:45,460
And my concern is why?

747
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:47,330
Right?
But I don't think I am Sam,

748
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:48,164
because I think that the fundamental 
message in the New Testament for 

749
00:42:50,841 --> 00:42:52,290
example,
is that so

750
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:54,163
the old hat,
if we Jews are in possession of a book 

751
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,160
that has some diabolical passages that 
would be better left out.

752
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:06,080
You're not going to offend me.
I'm Jewish.

753
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,600
It's not like it's in the old testament 
itself and the Jewish Bible.

754
00:43:09,601 --> 00:43:10,434
There's,
there's also the seeds of the same 

755
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,950
tension.
So for example,

756
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:15,023
there's a tension and this would be 
attention that's of interest to you 

757
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:20,790
because you,
you stated quite clearly in your book,

758
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,713
in the moral landscape that you don't 
want to throw the baby out with the 

759
00:43:23,881 --> 00:43:26,580
bathwater with regards to at least to 
religious phenomenology.

760
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:29,700
You said that,
for example,

761
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:33,300
I still considered the world's religions
to be mere intellectual,

762
00:43:33,301 --> 00:43:36,420
runes maintained at enormous economic 
and social costs.

763
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:40,050
But now I understood that important 
psychological truths can be found in the

764
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:40,884
rubble while I'm trying to find the 
important psychological truths in the 

765
00:43:43,681 --> 00:43:46,140
rubble and so and so,
but,

766
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,450
but we have to decide also if we agree 
about that.

767
00:43:48,451 --> 00:43:52,110
Like are there important psychological 
truth to be found in the rubble?

768
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,070
Oh,
absolutely.

769
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,810
Okay,
so so then we can.

770
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,110
But

771
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:58,300
the problem with revelation that this 
notion of revelation,

772
00:43:58,301 --> 00:44:01,540
this notion that some books weren't 
written by smart people,

773
00:44:01,541 --> 00:44:02,374
they were written by God,
allows you confines you to taking the 

774
00:44:06,821 --> 00:44:07,654
whole tax,
even though the text was cobbled 

775
00:44:09,251 --> 00:44:11,920
together over centuries and some for 
whole centuries,

776
00:44:11,921 --> 00:44:12,754
but some books we're in the new 
testament and then they got thrown out 

777
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:18,130
the centuries later and some books 
weren't in and then got put in.

778
00:44:18,131 --> 00:44:18,964
So it's like it's an all too human 
process that got us these books in the 

779
00:44:21,701 --> 00:44:25,390
first place.
But once they were set to believers,

780
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,613
imagine that you're stuck with every 
passage and there are passages in the 

781
00:44:30,491 --> 00:44:31,324
old testament.
Tell you to stone up a girl or a woman 

782
00:44:33,901 --> 00:44:36,540
who's not a virgin on her wedding night.
Take her to her.

783
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:38,490
Father's doorstep and stone her to 
death.

784
00:44:38,491 --> 00:44:39,324
Right.
And

785
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:42,270
probably agree that those are wrong.
So yeah,

786
00:44:42,271 --> 00:44:43,710
there was another point,
but you don't.

787
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,160
You don't have to read the book to the 
end to know that it's wrong,

788
00:44:46,161 --> 00:44:48,000
but you can get.
You can get that from the paragraph.

789
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,130
Yeah,
but that isn't what I said.

790
00:44:52,131 --> 00:44:52,964
I didn't say you had to read the end to 
the end of the book to know that it 

791
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,473
needed to end.
You need it to read to the end of the 

792
00:44:58,191 --> 00:45:01,040
book to contextualize those statements 
within the whole.

793
00:45:01,041 --> 00:45:03,160
I didn't know exculpatory.

794
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:07,580
There's no exculpatory context as to 
those kinds of statements and that's

795
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:09,660
there is in the Old Testament,
there's a real.

796
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,553
There's a real tension and this is.
I think the tension that would be of 

797
00:45:12,391 --> 00:45:13,224
interest to you is there's a tension 
between the dogmatic and the prophetic 

798
00:45:15,511 --> 00:45:16,344
traditions and I think to the degree 
that you're interested in religious 

799
00:45:19,891 --> 00:45:20,724
phenomenology,
you find yourself on the side of the 

800
00:45:21,991 --> 00:45:25,860
prophetic tradition and the prophetic 
tradition has implicitly in it,

801
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,593
what would you call it?
An implicit damnation of those dogmatic 

802
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:33,960
crew,
those cruelly dogmatic rules.

803
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:35,190
You see that emerge all the time,

804
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:40,880
well arguably in Christianity,
I think going to see it clearly there in

805
00:45:40,881 --> 00:45:43,880
the old testament with the distinction 
between the once again

806
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:47,090
to Islam,
but but every prophetic,

807
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:52,500
the notion of prophecy is dangerous and 
worth worrying about.

808
00:45:52,911 --> 00:45:57,020
I mean the idea that any ancient book 
contains in it,

809
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:01,280
a perfect description of rightly 
interpreted,

810
00:46:01,281 --> 00:46:03,830
however difficult to interpret it.
If you're only smart enough,

811
00:46:03,831 --> 00:46:08,570
you could extract from this text a 
perfect window onto the future,

812
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:09,703
right,
and that that whole generations of 

813
00:46:10,821 --> 00:46:14,090
people have lived by the lights of this 
cockamamie idea,

814
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,353
right?
That the world is going to end and it's 

815
00:46:16,581 --> 00:46:18,650
empty and is going to be glorious,
right?

816
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:19,484
This is.
This is at the center of most most 

817
00:46:21,861 --> 00:46:23,410
eschatology is.
It's just that the,

818
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:26,820
when the wheels come off,
totally right,

819
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:30,610
that's on some levels the best thing 
that's ever going to happen because it's

820
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:31,453
showing you that in this case,
Jesus is going to come back and throw 

821
00:46:35,211 --> 00:46:36,560
this enters into a lake of fire

822
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:40,310
and I've read to the end of the book is 
pretty scary at the end as well.

823
00:46:40,311 --> 00:46:41,810
I in revelation is,
yeah,

824
00:46:41,811 --> 00:46:42,351
yeah,
yeah,

825
00:46:42,351 --> 00:46:43,510
no kidding.
Well,

826
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:45,260
that's a really good objection,

827
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,470
but you know,
like when I did my lectures on the Bible

828
00:46:48,471 --> 00:46:49,304
last year,
I said they provided the psychological 

829
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:52,093
take on the biblical lectures and that's
what I'm going to attempt to maintain 

830
00:46:54,651 --> 00:46:55,484
here because I don't believe that I'm 
qualified to make fundamental 

831
00:46:59,331 --> 00:47:01,850
metaphysical statements,
but,

832
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,150
but that,
that,

833
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:06,240
that scene,
that's,

834
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,110
that's limited out at the end of 
revelation.

835
00:47:08,111 --> 00:47:13,111
So that's a very interesting book read 
psychologically because what it is,

836
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:16,880
and this is,
we should talk about what we'll.

837
00:47:16,881 --> 00:47:17,630
Let me,
let me,

838
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:18,463
let me just address that.
Only take a minute and I'll try to be 

839
00:47:20,661 --> 00:47:21,494
succinct.
So there's an idea that's expressed in 

840
00:47:23,661 --> 00:47:24,494
that book is that it's something like 
things are always falling apart in a 

841
00:47:27,441 --> 00:47:29,680
fundamental manner.
It's part,

842
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:30,514
it's built into the,
there's an apocalyptic element to human 

843
00:47:32,861 --> 00:47:33,694
life.
We fail in small ways and we fail in 

844
00:47:36,011 --> 00:47:39,040
catastrophic ways and everything that we
have,

845
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:40,330
we lose and we die.

846
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:41,643
So there's an societies come to an end.
There's an apocalyptic element built 

847
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:45,364
into the structure of human reality and 
part of part of what's revealed in that 

848
00:47:49,391 --> 00:47:52,390
strange book at the end,
which is like a hallucinogenic nightmare

849
00:47:52,391 --> 00:47:53,224
in some sense,
is that the hero is born at the darkest 

850
00:47:55,661 --> 00:47:56,980
point in the,
in the,

851
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:58,023
in the journey,
and it's a psychological truth and it's 

852
00:48:00,401 --> 00:48:01,234
very,
very apt because at at the darkest 

853
00:48:03,401 --> 00:48:04,234
point,
this is also why Christ is born near 

854
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,350
near the darkest time of the year.
From a,

855
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:10,510
from a,
from a metaphysical perspective,

856
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:12,640
there's an idea there that when things 
fall apart,

857
00:48:12,641 --> 00:48:13,474
that's the time for the birth of the 
hero and the hero in revelation is also 

858
00:48:17,321 --> 00:48:21,250
the place where free.
Where we're truthful speech most clearly

859
00:48:21,251 --> 00:48:23,470
manifests itself because in the 
Christian tradition,

860
00:48:23,471 --> 00:48:24,304
Christ is identified with truthful 
speech and so the notion there is that 

861
00:48:26,921 --> 00:48:27,754
redemption under apocalyptic conditions 
is to be found in the revelation of 

862
00:48:30,971 --> 00:48:31,804
truthful speech.
Which is something that you actually 

863
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:33,890
believe.

864
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:36,260
Well,
I believe in truthful speech,

865
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:37,393
but I also believe that you can play 
this kind of interpretive game with 

866
00:48:41,421 --> 00:48:43,460
almost any text.
That this is this way.

867
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,320
But then you can do it with the world 
salmon.

868
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:48,330
That wreaks havoc with your value from 
facts argument.

869
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,153
No,
actually I didn't hear what you just 

870
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:51,510
said.

871
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:53,010
What was that?
While I said you can.

872
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:53,873
You can.
You can make exactly the same objection 

873
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,513
with the world of facts is there's an 
infinite number of facts and there's an 

874
00:48:58,681 --> 00:48:59,514
infinite number of potential 
interpretations and so pat tracking the 

875
00:49:02,281 --> 00:49:05,760
pathway from the fact to a value is 
actually impossible.

876
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:07,900
It's the same argument with regards to 
the local.

877
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:09,510
We'll talk about that.

878
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:12,220
That I don't think that's a good 
analogy.

879
00:49:12,221 --> 00:49:13,054
I.
There are more and less plausible 

880
00:49:14,891 --> 00:49:17,710
interpretations of,
of any situation,

881
00:49:17,711 --> 00:49:20,680
any data,
and any text,

882
00:49:20,681 --> 00:49:23,980
arguably,
but the problem is that you can.

883
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:25,083
You can read into any story,
some apparently meaningful set of 

884
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:34,060
psychological insights,

885
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,133
which,
but you can do that with any set of 

886
00:49:36,251 --> 00:49:37,310
facts too.

887
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:38,561
Well,
no,

888
00:49:38,561 --> 00:49:42,970
I mean there's certain things you can't.
You can't over interpret to your heart's

889
00:49:42,971 --> 00:49:45,220
content and come out any way you choose.
My,

890
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:48,850
my point is that the.
First of all there are.

891
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:53,530
This is why fundamentalism always has an
edge over more quote,

892
00:49:53,531 --> 00:49:58,531
more sophisticated theology because the 
sophisticated theology is in,

893
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:00,453
in most cases,
inspired by a more and more modern 

894
00:50:05,861 --> 00:50:06,694
recognition that what we can't read it 
literally because it either makes no 

895
00:50:10,211 --> 00:50:12,190
sense or it makes barbaric sense,
right?

896
00:50:12,191 --> 00:50:13,024
So we have to get away from the literal 
and the more you get away from the 

897
00:50:16,091 --> 00:50:16,924
literal,
the more you are unconstrained by the 

898
00:50:19,421 --> 00:50:23,500
text and you can just broadcast on it.
Anything you want to put there.

899
00:50:23,501 --> 00:50:24,830
And so,
you know,

900
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:26,470
the,
the literal x,

901
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:27,973
there's no question that most 
generations of Christians who read 

902
00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:31,034
revelation expected the world to end in 
some literals sense of this kind of fat 

903
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:38,690
phantasmagoria.

904
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:39,141
I mean,
there was,

905
00:50:39,141 --> 00:50:40,960
there was going to be a beast and it 
was.

906
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:42,670
I mean,
this is our,

907
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:43,513
you know,
undoubtedly they thought this was gonna 

908
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:45,860
happen in their own time,
you know,

909
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:47,840
under Rome.
But,

910
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:50,030
uh,
this is a,

911
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:55,090
you know,
if you're going to go purely literary on

912
00:50:55,851 --> 00:50:57,940
any of these texts,
you are,

913
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:01,280
you on some level,
you're playing tennis without a net.

914
00:51:01,281 --> 00:51:03,680
You're just,
you're unconstrained by the text and you

915
00:51:03,681 --> 00:51:05,960
can do with it more or less anything you
want.

916
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:07,183
Isn't that,
isn't that argument working at cross 

917
00:51:08,811 --> 00:51:12,360
purposes with your other argument about.
Well,

918
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:13,850
no,
because it's always tempting.

919
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:14,713
First of all,
there are lines that do not announce 

920
00:51:18,531 --> 00:51:19,364
their,
that they're susceptible to that 

921
00:51:20,451 --> 00:51:21,110
interpretation.
I mean,

922
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:21,921
yes you can.
You can say,

923
00:51:21,921 --> 00:51:22,754
listen,
Allah does not want us to cut the hands 

924
00:51:24,261 --> 00:51:25,041
off of thieves.
He,

925
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:25,671
he just,
you know,

926
00:51:25,671 --> 00:51:26,520
he,
he,

927
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,790
he meant a,
a cut the,

928
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:30,650
the,
you know,

929
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:31,513
the,
the hand of their volition rather than 

930
00:51:33,771 --> 00:51:34,790
their actual hands.

931
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:35,400
Right?
So you're,

932
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,730
you're constraining them rather than 
kind of now.

933
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,710
Sure.
Undoubtedly there was some,

934
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,990
some Muslim somewhere who wants to 
interpret it that way,

935
00:51:41,991 --> 00:51:46,640
but it gets harder and harder.
The clearer the the line is.

936
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:49,880
And the problem with all of these taxes 
that there are so many principles,

937
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:53,630
again,
I read revelation any way you want.

938
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:59,050
It is still a problem that it it,
it is perfectly rational on the basis of

939
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:01,484
reading that text to expect the world to
end and for Jesus Jesus to be the only 

940
00:52:06,951 --> 00:52:09,470
savior of it.
Therefore,

941
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:14,690
if you happen to be born a Hindu or born
a Muslim or or or born a Jew who doesn't

942
00:52:15,441 --> 00:52:18,260
recognize Jesus to be the Messiah,
you are screwed.

943
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:20,200
Well,
maternity is a funny thing though.

944
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,030
I mean,
it's a strange thing.

945
00:52:22,031 --> 00:52:22,864
Let's say that one of the things we 
already agreed on as far as I can tell 

946
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:32,080
is that the antidote to pathological 
dogmatism is,

947
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,930
is free,
truthful expression.

948
00:52:34,931 --> 00:52:36,730
Something like that.
Is that?

949
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:37,391
Yeah.
Okay.

950
00:52:37,391 --> 00:52:37,961
Yeah.
Well,

951
00:52:37,961 --> 00:52:38,794
but one of the things I would say that's
absolutely crucial to Christianity in 

952
00:52:42,911 --> 00:52:43,744
particular is the notion that the thing 
that's redeeming is exactly that and it 

953
00:52:47,921 --> 00:52:49,750
doesn't matter,
so it's universal truth.

954
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:52,420
Now,
if we both agree on that,

955
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:56,050
the idea that the free expression of 
truthful speech is the antidote,

956
00:52:56,051 --> 00:52:58,450
let's say both denialism and to 
totalitarianism.

957
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:02,590
Then the notion that that might be 
embodied in something like the word,

958
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:05,860
which is truly,
I think the deepest of Christian ideas.

959
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:09,850
It that why?
How is that not the same claim?

960
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:13,050
Now let.
Let me elaborate more a little bit more,

961
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,740
more,
more completely.

962
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:16,600
So here,
here's the strange thing.

963
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:18,790
First of all,
I agree with you by the way,

964
00:53:18,791 --> 00:53:19,624
about the danger of flying off the text.
Write about as you move away from the 

965
00:53:23,861 --> 00:53:24,694
text,
your interpretation gets less and less 

966
00:53:25,981 --> 00:53:26,814
constraint and I think it's also the 
same danger as move of moving away from 

967
00:53:29,611 --> 00:53:30,444
the facts,
which is I think why you want to ground 

968
00:53:32,071 --> 00:53:32,904
values and facts.
So I get that argument and I think it's 

969
00:53:34,771 --> 00:53:35,604
accurate,
but,

970
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:36,823
but here's,
here's something strange is that this 

971
00:53:39,151 --> 00:53:39,984
notion that redemptive,
that redemption is to be found in 

972
00:53:43,111 --> 00:53:47,250
truthful speech is actually embodied in 
Christian mythology,

973
00:53:47,251 --> 00:53:50,130
let's say as a personality and not as an
idea.

974
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:52,680
It's actually something that you embody 
and act out.

975
00:53:52,681 --> 00:53:53,514
It's not just an idea and that's why 
there's an emphasis on the idea of the 

976
00:53:56,341 --> 00:54:00,390
embodiment of the word in flesh.
It's a very sophisticated idea.

977
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:03,150
I mean it's just,
it's insanely sophisticated idea,

978
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:04,350
so.
And they will.

979
00:54:04,350 --> 00:54:06,420
And there's one more thing.
Okay,

980
00:54:06,421 --> 00:54:09,570
so look you,
you,

981
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,433
you've made the case and I hope we can 
really get to this because this is the 

982
00:54:12,451 --> 00:54:13,284
really tough part of our discussion I 
think is that you want to ground the 

983
00:54:16,201 --> 00:54:19,350
world of values in something that's 
true.

984
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:22,560
We can say objectively true,
but let's just say true for a minute and

985
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:25,440
I share that desire,
but,

986
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,250
but the problem is,
is that I can't see,

987
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:30,990
and you actually state this in your 
book,

988
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:31,883
I can't see how you can interpret the 
world of facts without an a priori 

989
00:54:35,881 --> 00:54:39,930
interpretive structure.
And this is an old philosophical claim.

990
00:54:39,931 --> 00:54:41,060
It's not unique to me.
It's,

991
00:54:41,061 --> 00:54:42,810
it's the claim of Khan,
for example,

992
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:43,913
that you can't get directly from the 
fact to the value because there's an 

993
00:54:48,061 --> 00:54:52,020
interpretive framework that mediates 
between you and the fact that.

994
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:52,903
So first of all,
I'd like to know if you accept that 

995
00:54:54,031 --> 00:54:56,730
proposition.
And then the second question would be,

996
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:57,803
if you do accept the proposition,
then what's your understanding of the 

997
00:55:01,021 --> 00:55:05,040
nature of the interpretive framework?
Because I think it's best understood,

998
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:08,940
at least in part as a personality or as 
a story for that matter.

999
00:55:08,941 --> 00:55:09,774
So

1000
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:15,350
well,
I think our intuition of truth,

1001
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:16,763
the intuition that there's a difference 
between fact and fiction or fact and 

1002
00:55:19,501 --> 00:55:23,160
fantasy,
the intuition that we are in,

1003
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:24,053
we live in relationship to a common 
reality about which our understanding 

1004
00:55:27,871 --> 00:55:28,704
can converge,
provided we're looking in the same 

1005
00:55:30,571 --> 00:55:31,404
direction with the same tools.
I think that is certainly deeper than 

1006
00:55:35,491 --> 00:55:38,910
religion.
It's not best captured by stories.

1007
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:40,590
Uh,
it's,

1008
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:42,660
it.
Even if it,

1009
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:45,300
even if you could,
as a matter of historical fact,

1010
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:49,140
point to its roots in story and myth and
religion,

1011
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:50,543
that's not an argument that it's now in 
the 21st century best captured by story 

1012
00:55:54,541 --> 00:55:56,820
and myth and religion.
I think it's,

1013
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,860
it is a fundamental intuition to which 
our sanity,

1014
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:03,743
both personally and Inter subjectively 
is anchored me to lose a sense of 

1015
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:09,803
objective reality is to lose the,
the platform on which you can 

1016
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:17,240
communicate with anyone and or,
or,

1017
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:18,103
or rationally expect anything to happen 
a moment from now to think that your 

1018
00:56:22,410 --> 00:56:23,243
memory represents something about a 
prior state of the world and your 

1019
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:30,520
beliefs represent something about a 
possible state in the future.

1020
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:31,653
All of this is anchored to a sense that 
there's a difference between knowing 

1021
00:56:35,561 --> 00:56:38,770
something really and just imagining it,
right?

1022
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:39,604
There's a difference between perception 
and hallucination and all of these 

1023
00:56:42,041 --> 00:56:42,874
distinctions are born of this,
this intuition I think we do have 

1024
00:56:48,190 --> 00:56:52,360
clearly we have fundamental intuitions 
which,

1025
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:53,403
uh,
are either impossible to analyze or can 

1026
00:56:58,391 --> 00:56:59,224
be analyzed with,
with respect to only other intuitions 

1027
00:57:01,901 --> 00:57:04,480
which we,
which we deem more rudimentary.

1028
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:05,623
Uh,
we're upon which everything else we do 

1029
00:57:08,321 --> 00:57:11,140
as a matter of knowledge gathering and 
sensemaking is built.

1030
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:14,170
So the intuition that two plus two makes
four,

1031
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:14,921
right?
You know,

1032
00:57:14,921 --> 00:57:15,754
you at some point you learn basic 
arithmetic and you learn what addition 

1033
00:57:20,351 --> 00:57:21,184
is.
And it's demonstrated to you with 

1034
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,390
objects and you're showing,
you're showing,

1035
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:26,303
you take two apples and you take two 
more apples and then you have four 

1036
00:57:28,481 --> 00:57:29,261
apples.
Look,

1037
00:57:29,261 --> 00:57:31,030
just count them,
uh,

1038
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:32,950
the,
the intuition that,

1039
00:57:32,951 --> 00:57:35,980
that can be generalized to any foreign 
objects,

1040
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:38,860
right?
That it's not just a fact about apples,

1041
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:39,753
right?
This is something that we are clearly 

1042
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,710
designed to have their places where it 
might break down,

1043
00:57:47,711 --> 00:57:50,140
right?
They might break down and at the quantum

1044
00:57:50,141 --> 00:57:54,310
level it might break down.
And in areas where our intuitions fail,

1045
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:58,450
we recognize those failures in science 
and mathematics by,

1046
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,150
by recourse to other intuitions,
which again,

1047
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:02,163
are unreliable.
But so there is just this fact that we 

1048
00:58:04,361 --> 00:58:08,980
do pull ourselves up by our bootstraps.
And that's not embarrassing.

1049
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:09,660
What's

1050
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:10,980
the difference?
What's the.

1051
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:13,620
And I'm not trying to trap you here,
seriously,

1052
00:58:13,621 --> 00:58:14,454
not so.
So there might be mathematical 

1053
00:58:16,831 --> 00:58:17,664
intuition's a priorities,
let's say identified time and spaces in 

1054
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:22,553
a prior intuitions.
But I think there's a third category of 

1055
00:58:25,591 --> 00:58:26,424
a prior intuitions that are in fact 
stories or their personalities or 

1056
00:58:29,551 --> 00:58:30,241
stories.
So let,

1057
00:58:30,241 --> 00:58:31,074
let me give you an example.
So I'm going to do a quick rereading of 

1058
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:37,290
the moral landscape.
So because see,

1059
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,800
you talk about g dot Morris argument of 
infinite regress.

1060
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:43,740
If you claim that something's good and 
you equate it with something,

1061
00:58:43,741 --> 00:58:47,490
you can also ask infinitely why the 
thing you're equating it with is good.

1062
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:51,570
Now it seems to me that the way that you
step out of that argument,

1063
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:54,570
and correct me if I'm wrong here,
as you tell this,

1064
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:58,560
you tell you tell a story.
I'm not trying to be smart about that.

1065
00:58:59,100 --> 00:58:59,933
You tell two stories.
You tell a story about someone who has 

1066
00:59:01,951 --> 00:59:03,660
an absolutely terrible life.
They're in a,

1067
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:04,703
in a,
in a jungle where nature is trying to 

1068
00:59:06,181 --> 00:59:09,030
kill them all the time and well,
they're trying to be killed by nature.

1069
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:10,770
Wild nature is trying to kill them all 
the time.

1070
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:14,670
Horrible barbaric thugs are making their
life miserable in every possible way.

1071
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:17,490
Okay,
so that's one poll,

1072
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,353
let's say.
And then another pool you identify and 

1073
00:59:21,171 --> 00:59:23,300
these are hypotheticals.
So I guess they're fictions.

1074
00:59:23,301 --> 00:59:24,134
That's one way of thinking about it.
Even though they're extracted from real 

1075
00:59:26,031 --> 00:59:27,780
situations,
they're there,

1076
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:29,280
they're met,
have fictions there.

1077
00:59:29,281 --> 00:59:31,280
Met a truths,
that's another way of thinking about it.

1078
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,353
You contrast a good life and that's a 
life where the person has enough to eat 

1079
00:59:36,021 --> 00:59:36,854
and enough shelter and you know they 
have the things that you would expect 

1080
00:59:39,831 --> 00:59:40,460
people to want.

1081
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,980
You say,
this is a bad life and you say this is a

1082
00:59:42,981 --> 00:59:43,814
good life,
and so and then you say that's when you 

1083
00:59:46,491 --> 00:59:47,324
make a side move,
which I would say is that that's an 

1084
00:59:48,741 --> 00:59:51,530
objectively verifiable fat.
I would say.

1085
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:54,500
I don't think it is an objectively 
verifiable fact.

1086
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:55,663
I think it's a fundamental moral claim 
and I think that's where you put your 

1087
00:59:58,791 --> 01:00:01,430
stake in the ground and I would say when
I read that,

1088
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:02,810
I thought,
well,

1089
01:00:02,811 --> 01:00:03,644
if you take your jungle story,
which you've extracted from a bunch of 

1090
01:00:07,311 --> 01:00:11,600
horrors and compiled and you take your 
positive story,

1091
01:00:11,601 --> 01:00:16,550
which you've extracted from a bunch of 
horrors or a bunch of of of Kwanzaa,

1092
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:19,730
utopias,
let's say in compiled your two thirds of

1093
01:00:19,731 --> 01:00:20,564
the way to a landscape of Hell and 
heaven while so then why not continue 

1094
01:00:24,531 --> 01:00:25,910
the abstraction and say,
look,

1095
01:00:25,911 --> 01:00:29,120
what we're really trying to avoid here 
is hell.

1096
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,340
We're really trying to move towards this
heaven.

1097
01:00:31,341 --> 01:00:31,731
Yeah,
but.

1098
01:00:31,731 --> 01:00:32,564
Oh yeah.

1099
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,360
As soon as they do that,
you name it.

1100
01:00:34,361 --> 01:00:35,510
Just landscape.
No,

1101
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:40,520
but my name for hell,
this is very interesting because

1102
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:46,920
like the,

1103
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:51,560
you and I were talking,
we were talking about this at dinner.

1104
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:55,040
We're talking about this at dinner and 
how the,

1105
01:00:55,041 --> 01:00:55,874
the,
the overlap or lack of overlap between 

1106
01:00:57,651 --> 01:01:02,360
our audiences and so like I just heard 
from your audience there and

1107
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,720
you might've heard from the odd convert,
but,

1108
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:06,703
but what's amazing to me is so like I 
have to do some work to figure out what 

1109
01:01:11,811 --> 01:01:15,920
point they think you made because.
Wait a second.

1110
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:17,390
Wait a second.
Wait a second.

1111
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:18,503
No,
no.

1112
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:19,473
Hold on.

1113
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,560
And I said if you're going to produce a 
fiction,

1114
01:01:22,561 --> 01:01:25,530
why not go right to the end?
So did produce a fiction.

1115
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:26,683
It's you,
you can tell stories by way of 

1116
01:01:29,761 --> 01:01:32,400
communicating certain ideas.
I mean that's obviously,

1117
01:01:32,670 --> 01:01:37,670
I'm not saying stories aren't incredibly
powerful and useful and inevitable,

1118
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:39,413
right?
It's like we

1119
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:40,790
wait,
I think you are.

1120
01:01:40,791 --> 01:01:43,170
You're not saying.
You might not be saying that they're,

1121
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:44,370
that they're,
they're not,

1122
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:45,423
they're not inevitable.
But you are debating their utility and 

1123
01:01:48,111 --> 01:01:48,944
power because you know,
you said that you don't need the story 

1124
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:52,274
as an intern.

1125
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:56,110
So now we have a few doors open here,
which I think we should wait.

1126
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:57,003
We should extract the most out of these 
areas that we've touched and not run on 

1127
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:02,460
something else.
So I think there is

1128
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:06,800
to talk about the utility of story,
right?

1129
01:02:06,801 --> 01:02:07,634
Which is obviously the fact about the 
world and about human psychology that 

1130
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,940
you're reading a lot into and more into 
that.

1131
01:02:13,941 --> 01:02:14,774
I'm reading right?
And the people we just heard from love 

1132
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,073
that you.

1133
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:19,980
Or maybe I'm reading more into it

1134
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:20,790
than

1135
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:21,623
that,
but you talk a lot about the primacy of 

1136
01:02:23,761 --> 01:02:28,170
stories and you're trying to get me to 
admit that they are.

1137
01:02:28,171 --> 01:02:29,004
That I even,
I helplessly resort to storytelling to 

1138
01:02:31,861 --> 01:02:32,694
make my points right.
Well I think is a good place for us to 

1139
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,770
and I don't want us to get bogged down 
by.

1140
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:39,613
I think it's a good place for us to 
touch this topic of the distinction 

1141
01:02:42,901 --> 01:02:45,900
between the literal and metaphorical 
truth which you.

1142
01:02:45,901 --> 01:02:47,160
I mean,
you might want to introduce it,

1143
01:02:47,161 --> 01:02:49,710
but I been [inaudible] that for in my 
mind that covers,

1144
01:02:49,711 --> 01:02:52,110
this is different emphasis on stories.

1145
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:54,580
Okay,
briefly,

1146
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:55,940
but we are,
we are at,

1147
01:02:56,470 --> 01:02:57,303
we are at

1148
01:02:57,330 --> 01:03:02,250
60 minutes and we had agreed to go an 
hour and 15 before we start q and a.

1149
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:05,460
So I agree that metaphorical truth is 
relevant here.

1150
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:06,383
Metaphorical truth is my argument that 
there are some things which are 

1151
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:14,040
literally false,
but if you behave as if they were true,

1152
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:14,874
you come out ahead of where you would if
you behaved according to the fact that 

1153
01:03:17,521 --> 01:03:22,380
they are false sense that these things 
hover in a kind of intermediate space to

1154
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:24,810
call them false is,
is incorrect.

1155
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:25,940
Right?
And,

1156
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:26,863
and,
and I hear Jordan wanting to call them 

1157
01:03:29,621 --> 01:03:31,330
true because there are so useful,

1158
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:33,500
but you also call it,
look,

1159
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,210
this is what happens in the moral 
landscape.

1160
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:36,870
I think.
Tell me about that.

1161
01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:37,723
Tell me why I'm wrong,
because I'm really trying to understand 

1162
01:03:39,381 --> 01:03:39,981
it.
See,

1163
01:03:39,981 --> 01:03:40,814
I think you dealt with Ge Moore's 
problem of infinite regress by by 

1164
01:03:45,350 --> 01:03:48,590
staking a moral proposition and your 
moral proposition was,

1165
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:49,424
look,
here's a way things can be horrible and 

1166
01:03:52,011 --> 01:03:52,844
here's the way things can be good.
Can we accept that this is horrible and 

1167
01:03:56,091 --> 01:03:58,460
this is good and that we should move 
towards good?

1168
01:03:58,790 --> 01:04:01,640
And if the answer is yes,
we can accept that,

1169
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:06,440
then we can proceed and maybe we can 
even proceed with extracting values from

1170
01:04:06,441 --> 01:04:07,274
facts,
but we have to accept that a priority 

1171
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,304
presupposition first and you insist that
we have to accept it because it's 

1172
01:04:13,371 --> 01:04:16,180
objectively true and I don't think 
that's correct.

1173
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:16,500
So

1174
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,333
unlimited is get the proposition clear.
So my argument is that the worst 

1175
01:04:21,751 --> 01:04:26,100
possible misery for everyone is bad.
That's hell.

1176
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:29,940
That's hell is is the religious version 
of that.

1177
01:04:29,941 --> 01:04:33,210
But I'm just.
You can forget about religion or whether

1178
01:04:33,211 --> 01:04:34,044
there's a god or anything else that we 
live in a universe that admits of the 

1179
01:04:36,571 --> 01:04:37,404
possibility of experience.
I'm asking you to imagine a universe 

1180
01:04:40,771 --> 01:04:41,604
where every conscious mind,
every mind that can have an experience 

1181
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:50,820
is tuned to the worst possible 
experience for that mind.

1182
01:04:51,090 --> 01:04:54,000
For as long as possible,
so there's no silver lining,

1183
01:04:54,020 --> 01:04:55,620
there is no.
There are no lessons learned.

1184
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:56,813
Everything that can suffer,
suffers as much as it possibly can for 

1185
01:04:59,581 --> 01:05:01,080
as long as they can.
Now,

1186
01:05:01,081 --> 01:05:03,150
that includes human beings,
includes animals,

1187
01:05:03,151 --> 01:05:07,590
and includes future ai that we might 
build that can suffer.

1188
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:10,980
It includes beings that we will never 
know about.

1189
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:15,930
Right?
So my argument is that's bad.

1190
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:18,820
If anything is bad,
that's bad.

1191
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:21,190
Okay?
We don't disagree that the hell is bad.

1192
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:22,053
If,
if the word bad is going to mean 

1193
01:05:24,641 --> 01:05:28,660
anything that's bad and you can't say 
that's fine,

1194
01:05:28,661 --> 01:05:30,660
but it's not a factual claim.
No,

1195
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:33,880
it is is essentially it's a claim about.
So I would argue to you,

1196
01:05:33,881 --> 01:05:34,714
and again,
it's hard to impart this intuition if 

1197
01:05:36,671 --> 01:05:37,504
someone doesn't share it,
but if someone doesn't share this 

1198
01:05:39,281 --> 01:05:40,114
intuition,
I have no way of interpreting any other 

1199
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:47,320
word that comes out of their mouth after
they admit they don't share this.

1200
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:51,310
So just imagine someone saying that 
doesn't make it a factual claim.

1201
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:53,740
Notes every.
So again,

1202
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:56,020
you guys are going to get stuck here.

1203
01:05:56,390 --> 01:05:59,590
I think you're going to
give us.

1204
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:00,950
Give us one more minute.
Okay,

1205
01:06:00,951 --> 01:06:02,000
one more.
One more minute.

1206
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:04,560
I don't think we'll get stuck here.
Every claim,

1207
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:08,310
every claim we make about anything,
at a certain point,

1208
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:11,490
if you trace all the tools we're using 
down to you,

1209
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:15,480
turtles all the way down to something 
that we can't explain and justify,

1210
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:16,433
right?
This is true of physics as true of 

1211
01:06:17,341 --> 01:06:20,310
mathematics.
I just said it was true of arithmetic.

1212
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:23,220
A good old proved it's true of 
arithmetic.

1213
01:06:23,221 --> 01:06:24,054
I mean there's that.
We have intuitions of truth that can't 

1214
01:06:25,561 --> 01:06:28,440
be cashed out by recourse to the system 
itself.

1215
01:06:28,970 --> 01:06:31,920
Uh,
and it's true.

1216
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:34,800
Morally,
I would argue in this sense that yes,

1217
01:06:34,801 --> 01:06:37,830
the worst possible misery for everyone 
is bad.

1218
01:06:37,831 --> 01:06:38,960
And if you're going to say,
well,

1219
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,500
who knows?
Maybe it's good or bad.

1220
01:06:43,501 --> 01:06:46,360
What does bad mean with a bad means?
Bad things.

1221
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:47,730
Again,
you guys are going to get stuck.

1222
01:06:49,730 --> 01:06:52,200
What does bad I,
I really,

1223
01:06:52,201 --> 01:06:53,034
I really think that we're going to go 
down a rabbit hole here and this is a 

1224
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:57,210
crucial issue.
That's an absolutely.

1225
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:00,430
Alright,
so we're putting our.

1226
01:07:01,690 --> 01:07:02,590
We have a mutiny here.

1227
01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:04,510
We're at,
we're at war with our moderator.

1228
01:07:05,370 --> 01:07:06,400
Give us two more minutes.

1229
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:08,130
Okay,
awesome.

1230
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:11,940
So let me.
But what I mean honestly,

1231
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:13,473
addiction,
that two minutes we won't be any 

1232
01:07:14,881 --> 01:07:15,714
foreigners.

1233
01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:17,810
Okay,
let's bet.

1234
01:07:17,811 --> 01:07:18,430
I'll bet you

1235
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:19,263
a dollar.
You're literally playing devil's 

1236
01:07:21,861 --> 01:07:26,861
advocate here because you don't believe 
that it's that hell might be good.

1237
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:28,580
No,
of course not.

1238
01:07:28,581 --> 01:07:30,310
Okay,
so it didn't say that so second.

1239
01:07:30,370 --> 01:07:33,460
So you will agree that it's bad and this
is an eight.

1240
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,640
I would argue that anything you would 
say,

1241
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:40,750
if you're going to use the word bad and 
good or better and worse or anything,

1242
01:07:40,971 --> 01:07:41,511
any,
make,

1243
01:07:41,511 --> 01:07:44,600
any value,
judgment about anything it will.

1244
01:07:44,601 --> 01:07:45,434
Implicit in those judgments will be an 
acknowledgement whether you're going to 

1245
01:07:48,321 --> 01:07:49,154
acknowledge it or not.
When I put the question to you that the 

1246
01:07:51,381 --> 01:07:55,580
worst possible misery for everyone is 
bad.

1247
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:59,540
You can't use the word bad unless you're
not disagreeing in the least about that.

1248
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:04,850
So it's built into your good and bad in 
with respect to every other situation in

1249
01:08:05,751 --> 01:08:06,584
life.
Find.

1250
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:07,560
You know,
if,

1251
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:09,880
if you,
if you're going home tomorrow and you're

1252
01:08:10,410 --> 01:08:13,610
a bus drives by and cuts your hand off 
and you say,

1253
01:08:13,611 --> 01:08:14,444
well that was bad.
It only makes sense with reference to 

1254
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:20,240
this underlying claim.
Well,

1255
01:08:20,241 --> 01:08:23,950
it would be worse if the other hand got 
cut off too and everyone's hands.

1256
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:25,990
You're beating a dead horse here,
man.

1257
01:08:25,991 --> 01:08:26,824
I agree with you.

1258
01:08:27,010 --> 01:08:30,790
So I'm saying that everyone assumes this
epic whether they,

1259
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:33,640
whether they claim to or not.
Okay.

1260
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:35,200
Okay.
And so and to so to say,

1261
01:08:35,201 --> 01:08:36,034
and this is,
this is how I bring g Moore's argument 

1262
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:38,900
to,
to end the opera.

1263
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:43,720
He says his argument depends on it being
intelligible at that point to say,

1264
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:46,330
well,
is that really bad?

1265
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,420
Is it really bad?
Okay,

1266
01:08:49,421 --> 01:08:51,550
well,
what would really band be if,

1267
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:56,080
if the worst possible misery for 
everyone didn't get you there,

1268
01:08:56,530 --> 01:08:57,400
right?
That there's no,

1269
01:08:57,430 --> 01:08:59,630
there's no other space to occupy.

1270
01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:00,843
I'm also not disputing the utility of 
your move to bring g Moore's infinite 

1271
01:09:04,301 --> 01:09:07,420
regress to an end.
I'm disputing something very specific.

1272
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:10,240
I'm disputing the issue that that's a 
factual claim.

1273
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:13,600
That's all bad.
We should avoid it.

1274
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:16,030
It brings Moore's infinite regress to an
end.

1275
01:09:16,090 --> 01:09:16,923
All of that.

1276
01:09:17,150 --> 01:09:17,983
It's deeper than a factual claim.
It's just a claim about the claim that 

1277
01:09:22,781 --> 01:09:26,890
is required to make any value,
judgment intelligible,

1278
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:28,510
right?
Any value judgment.

1279
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:29,393
So,
so it's not an not an arithmetical 

1280
01:09:31,211 --> 01:09:32,044
claim.
So an aeromedical claim about addition 

1281
01:09:34,031 --> 01:09:34,864
in this case is,
is now you could say the same thing you 

1282
01:09:40,151 --> 01:09:42,850
could say when I say two plus two makes 
four,

1283
01:09:42,910 --> 01:09:46,840
you could say,
but is that a factual claim and there is

1284
01:09:46,841 --> 01:09:50,530
some way of jiggering the way you talk 
about facts with respect to mathematics,

1285
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:50,951
because I.
well,

1286
01:09:50,951 --> 01:09:53,450
it's not a factual claim,
but as it's an arithmetical claim,

1287
01:09:53,451 --> 01:09:54,910
it's a mathematical claim.
Well,

1288
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:59,160
I'm also not trying to organize our 
myosin this way.

1289
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:00,250
Yep,
fine.

1290
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:03,450
What I'm trying to do is to what I'm 
really trying to do,

1291
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:04,883
we need.
See the problem I have with your 

1292
01:10:06,931 --> 01:10:10,620
argument and this isn't.
I don't mean that you're wrong.

1293
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:13,650
I see what you're doing and I see why 
you're doing it.

1294
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:15,870
As far as I can tell,
it's laudable,

1295
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,660
but for the problem is,
is that as far as I can tell,

1296
01:10:18,661 --> 01:10:19,494
there's problems it doesn't solve and 
there's other problems that leaves and 

1297
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:23,940
address that don't have to be unsolved 
or unaddressed.

1298
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:29,460
And so one of the problems is this 
problem of the intermediary interpretive

1299
01:10:29,461 --> 01:10:30,294
structure and you,
you already said we need intuitions to 

1300
01:10:32,491 --> 01:10:33,390
guide our,
our,

1301
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:36,870
our interrelationship with facts because
we've already agreed on that.

1302
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:40,200
So the question is what are the nature 
of these intuitions?

1303
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:44,040
And I'm saying some of those intuitions 
take the place of stories,

1304
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:46,500
take the form of stories,
but even more than that.

1305
01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:49,200
So I'm going to go after the health 
thing again.

1306
01:10:49,230 --> 01:10:50,610
Okay.
Because you said,

1307
01:10:50,611 --> 01:10:53,250
well it's bad and you made sure that I 
also agreed with that,

1308
01:10:53,251 --> 01:10:55,320
which I do.
I agree with that.

1309
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:58,170
And then it's a point of profound 
agreement between you and I,

1310
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,033
like I've spent my entire life trying to
understand why people get the worst 

1311
01:11:03,361 --> 01:11:07,500
things they could possibly imagine in 
the service of their dogmatic beliefs.

1312
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:10,830
And so I think that that's not good.
Seriously.

1313
01:11:10,831 --> 01:11:13,540
And I'm no fan of moral relativism,
so we're,

1314
01:11:13,690 --> 01:11:14,523
we're on the same page there now.
But what I noticed when you wrote the 

1315
01:11:18,541 --> 01:11:20,340
moral landscape is you,
you tell it,

1316
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,080
and I'm not trying to trap you,
you,

1317
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:23,133
you tell a story about it looks to me 
like it's a story about heaven versus 

1318
01:11:26,761 --> 01:11:28,920
Hell essentially.
Let me use that language momentarily.

1319
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,320
But it's also a story about good versus 
evil.

1320
01:11:31,710 --> 01:11:34,440
And this is why is because the question 
is,

1321
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:38,880
what's bad about hell?
Now you say the suffering,

1322
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:40,730
it's like fair enough,
man.

1323
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:45,510
True enough but not true,
but not true enough.

1324
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:50,900
So what's also bad about how in addition
to the actions that put you there,

1325
01:11:53,491 --> 01:11:55,570
the malevolence that generation,
okay,

1326
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:57,700
well that,
that's part of the sufferings mean.

1327
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:58,830
Oh No,
it's not.

1328
01:11:58,860 --> 01:11:59,640
No,
it's not.

1329
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,620
It's not the same as the suffering.
It's not,

1330
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:02,723
it's not the having your hand cut off.
It's the pleasure that's derived by the 

1331
01:12:06,061 --> 01:12:08,640
person who cut it off.
And that is different.

1332
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,190
So.
But that's part of my picture.

1333
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,070
But wait,
it's an important distinction.

1334
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:15,780
That distinction is important.

1335
01:12:17,530 --> 01:12:18,363
Jordan,
my picture of the moral landscape 

1336
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:20,513
includes all of this.
It includes everything that this is why 

1337
01:12:25,171 --> 01:12:26,004
I don't readily answer to the name of 
utilitarian or consequentialist because 

1338
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:33,480
the way those those views tend to be 
taught,

1339
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:38,570
they tend to take as the in the in the 
tally of consequences.

1340
01:12:40,410 --> 01:12:45,410
You leave out the psychological 
implications of being the sort of person

1341
01:12:45,871 --> 01:12:47,850
who would,
who would have sought those consequences

1342
01:12:47,980 --> 01:12:49,170
or behaved that way.
Right?

1343
01:12:49,171 --> 01:12:52,470
So I would grant you,
and this I'm explicit about this,

1344
01:12:52,471 --> 01:12:53,304
whenever I talk about this,
that part of the picture of any 

1345
01:12:57,511 --> 01:12:58,344
consequentialist discussion of wellbeing
are it is everything about the human 

1346
01:13:03,691 --> 01:13:04,524
mind and social relationships and 
societies born of all the individuals 

1347
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:13,580
living together,
everything there that leads to different

1348
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:14,903
states of consciousness.
So it's like like you having you having 

1349
01:13:17,171 --> 01:13:21,360
a negative intentions towards other 
people that give you that,

1350
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:23,520
that produce certain negative actions in
the world.

1351
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:24,913
They,
those intentions themselves are part of 

1352
01:13:26,851 --> 01:13:27,684
the consequential picture.
Those intentions themselves lead to 

1353
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:31,643
close the door to certain kinds of 
positive mental states that you don't 

1354
01:13:34,621 --> 01:13:35,301
have.
Let's say you.

1355
01:13:35,301 --> 01:13:36,134
Let's say you don't have compassion 
because you wake up every morning just 

1356
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:40,440
trying to figure out how to manipulate 
people.

1357
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:41,310
Well,
not,

1358
01:13:41,310 --> 01:13:45,780
not being able to feel compassion for 
other people is a bad thing for for many

1359
01:13:45,781 --> 01:13:46,614
reasons.
We could produce and if you get the 

1360
01:13:50,191 --> 01:13:51,024
usual consequentialist picture just 
looks at what's happening out in the 

1361
01:13:53,551 --> 01:13:57,210
world in terms of the body count and 
that's not,

1362
01:13:57,270 --> 01:13:58,103
you know,
that's.

1363
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:01,220
It's all part of this picture.
It's all we're all talking.

1364
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:02,273
Anything that can possibly affect a 
conscious mind anywhere is part of the 

1365
01:14:06,691 --> 01:14:09,270
picture that I'm painting that I'm 
calling the moral landscape.

1366
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:11,980
Okay?
So I want you to let me step

1367
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:12,730
in.
I,

1368
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:15,490
I think we need to bring you somewhere.

1369
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,420
Alright.
I'm gonna Start with you sam.

1370
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:19,633
Okay.
Let's swap out the idea of metaphorical 

1371
01:14:22,081 --> 01:14:26,370
truth for something a little harder 
headed heuristics,

1372
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:28,160
right?
We have [inaudible].

1373
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:32,160
We used them to perceive the world.
They're often highly reliable.

1374
01:14:32,910 --> 01:14:36,270
In fact,
almost everything that you believed that

1375
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:39,180
lets you operate has to be a hero stick 
of some kind.

1376
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:42,360
I mean,
if you decided to learn to drive and you

1377
01:14:42,361 --> 01:14:44,250
got into the car and they said,
okay,

1378
01:14:44,251 --> 01:14:46,590
well it's all quarks out there,
right?

1379
01:14:46,591 --> 01:14:49,260
You need to understand how parks 
interact with each other,

1380
01:14:49,261 --> 01:14:51,090
not useful,
not useful,

1381
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,050
right?
What you need,

1382
01:14:52,051 --> 01:14:52,884
or some heuristics in which you can 
stipulate that there's something called 

1383
01:14:55,141 --> 01:14:55,974
a vehicle out there and you don't have 
to be overly precise about what it is 

1384
01:14:58,261 --> 01:14:59,660
and you learn to avoid it.
Okay?

1385
01:15:00,180 --> 01:15:03,420
The heuristics vary a lot in quality.
Some of them are really good.

1386
01:15:03,570 --> 01:15:05,040
The periodic tables are really good.

1387
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:06,263
Okay?
Um,

1388
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:11,010
the idea of a gravitational potential 
energy is kind of crappy,

1389
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:14,550
right?
If I have a phone on a table here,

1390
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:15,384
I can tell you how much potential energy
it has by measuring its mass and its 

1391
01:15:18,150 --> 01:15:20,370
distance from the ground.
But if I've got a whole,

1392
01:15:20,371 --> 01:15:21,204
at one depth on one side of the table 
and another depth on the other side of 

1393
01:15:23,401 --> 01:15:24,234
the table,
I can't calculate it because it's a 

1394
01:15:25,231 --> 01:15:28,770
crappy heuristic.
Works well enough in regular stuff.

1395
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,150
Now,
here's the question.

1396
01:15:30,990 --> 01:15:35,820
What if these religious texts are 
heuristics?

1397
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:36,683
Through which most people simplify 
calculations that they are in no 

1398
01:15:39,721 --> 01:15:40,554
position to do based on the limited 
amount that they are capable of 

1399
01:15:43,321 --> 01:15:44,154
perceiving,
the amount that they understand about 

1400
01:15:45,691 --> 01:15:46,524
the things that are in play.
So they're deploying these heuristics 

1401
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:51,070
may be to reduce,
um,

1402
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:51,953
things that degrade wellbeing.
If it were true that religious 

1403
01:15:55,681 --> 01:15:56,514
heuristics increased wellbeing by 
allowing people to actually on average 

1404
01:16:01,531 --> 01:16:04,740
operate in the world in a way that,
that increased wellbeing,

1405
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:06,510
what would you say about them that?

1406
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:08,133
Well,
I would worry much less about them 

1407
01:16:09,041 --> 01:16:09,874
obviously,
and that's why I don't treat all 

1408
01:16:12,221 --> 01:16:13,054
religions equally there their religions 
I literally never think about because 

1409
01:16:16,991 --> 01:16:21,040
I'm not seeing the daily casualties of 
those belief systems.

1410
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:24,760
So.
But you say that as people get away from

1411
01:16:24,761 --> 01:16:25,594
fundamental versions of these things,
and I'm not advocating for 

1412
01:16:27,611 --> 01:16:28,444
fundamentalism here,
but you say yourself as people get away 

1413
01:16:30,701 --> 01:16:32,950
from the fundamental versions of these 
things,

1414
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:37,480
things tend to go haywire and so in,
in essence what you're saying

1415
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,470
that lap tend to go haywire and one 
says,

1416
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:43,063
well,
I thought I was interpreting 

1417
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:45,330
multiplicity of interpretations,
right?

1418
01:16:45,550 --> 01:16:46,060
Well,
yeah,

1419
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:49,780
but so people are in search of better or
heuristics.

1420
01:16:49,790 --> 01:16:50,623
I think the pressure is,
some of these heuristics are obviously 

1421
01:16:53,561 --> 01:16:54,394
so bad that there's,
there's civilizational pressure to find 

1422
01:16:57,941 --> 01:16:59,890
better interpretation and,
and,

1423
01:17:00,490 --> 01:17:03,680
but you said that the fundamentalists 
have an advantage.

1424
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:04,593
What is that advantage?
Because if you just go back to the text 

1425
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:10,640
and say,
listen,

1426
01:17:10,641 --> 01:17:13,370
I just want to understand what these 
words mean,

1427
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:17,030
right?
You get the first pass the quote literal

1428
01:17:17,031 --> 01:17:18,500
interpretation,
right?

1429
01:17:18,530 --> 01:17:23,530
And you're not bringing the 
armamentarium.

1430
01:17:24,010 --> 01:17:24,890
You,
you've brought your,

1431
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,520
you've got from the outside,
from other parts of culture to Parse the

1432
01:17:28,521 --> 01:17:29,510
tax.
You're just trying to,

1433
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:31,460
if it's an English and you speak 
English,

1434
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:34,060
you're just trying to decode the words.
Right?

1435
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:35,750
And when it says,
if your,

1436
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:39,080
if your girl is not a virgin on her 
wedding night,

1437
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:41,180
take her to her father's doorstep and 
stone her to death.

1438
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,690
That you know what stone means,
you know what girl means,

1439
01:17:44,691 --> 01:17:47,990
you know what father means and you're,
you're 90 percent there to uh,

1440
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,190
an obvious atrocity.

1441
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:51,810
I get the horror of it and we'll get to 
that in a second.

1442
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:52,883
But,
um,

1443
01:17:53,190 --> 01:17:58,190
but the basic point is to say that the 
fundamentalists have an advantage,

1444
01:17:59,130 --> 01:17:59,963
is to acknowledge something functional 
about those stories which I'm claiming 

1445
01:18:04,111 --> 01:18:04,944
are going to be some kind of 
evolutionary heuristic for living a 

1446
01:18:07,861 --> 01:18:09,540
life.
Does that make him defensible?

1447
01:18:09,650 --> 01:18:10,483
They have an advantage.
It's an advantage that it's an 

1448
01:18:14,381 --> 01:18:15,011
advantage.
It's a,

1449
01:18:15,011 --> 01:18:15,844
it's a mimetic advantage.
It's an advantage that isis has the 

1450
01:18:18,311 --> 01:18:19,560
advantage when,
when,

1451
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:24,750
when the people who,
who share their interpretation of Islam,

1452
01:18:26,810 --> 01:18:29,640
they slightly,
it's why someone like Anwar,

1453
01:18:29,641 --> 01:18:30,474
Allah,
locky could,

1454
01:18:30,490 --> 01:18:34,330
could make youtube videos that so many 
people found compelling.

1455
01:18:34,570 --> 01:18:37,060
It's because it's,
it's totally straightforward.

1456
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:37,953
Like the advantages.
Listen that a lot of people spending a 

1457
01:18:40,181 --> 01:18:45,070
lot of time lying to you about what 
these books mean and what the profit and

1458
01:18:45,071 --> 01:18:46,570
how he lived.
Right?

1459
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:47,670
I,
you,

1460
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:48,730
you,
you know,

1461
01:18:48,731 --> 01:18:51,790
in your heart that my interpretation of 
this is correct.

1462
01:18:51,791 --> 01:18:53,570
You just read the words,
right?

1463
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,770
And there's a strength in that.
There's a,

1464
01:18:56,771 --> 01:18:58,900
there's an honesty in that.
There's a,

1465
01:18:58,930 --> 01:19:01,060
there's a,
it's just,

1466
01:19:01,390 --> 01:19:04,480
it's clear when it says sacrifice a 
goat,

1467
01:19:04,690 --> 01:19:06,190
goat means goat,
right?

1468
01:19:06,191 --> 01:19:07,024
Like you,
you don't have to do something else to 

1469
01:19:08,141 --> 01:19:10,290
make goat meat having nothing to do with
goat.

1470
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:11,460
Right?
And so that it's,

1471
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:14,530
it's an.
It's an asymmetric war of,

1472
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:15,413
of if you're going to try to make your 
dog knows more and more palatable by 

1473
01:19:19,751 --> 01:19:20,584
importing stuff that clearly was never 
even in the worldview of anyone who 

1474
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:26,650
birthed these religions.
You're playing,

1475
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:31,720
you're not doing that because you want 
to live even more by God's word.

1476
01:19:31,960 --> 01:19:32,793
No.
You found some of God's words 

1477
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:35,530
unacceptable.
Right?

1478
01:19:35,531 --> 01:19:39,490
And that's an every fundamentalist can 
sniff that out and the right to sniff it

1479
01:19:39,491 --> 01:19:42,130
out because in fact it is in fact the 
motivation.

1480
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:43,900
Okay,
good.

1481
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:44,913
So I think we have.
We've got a tenuous kind of agreement 

1482
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:48,933
that there might be some kind of utility
that that utility might be morally 

1483
01:19:51,581 --> 01:19:52,414
questionable sometimes,
but that there is some reason that 

1484
01:19:55,091 --> 01:19:55,924
people would resort to a fundamental,
simple interpretation because as they 

1485
01:19:59,141 --> 01:19:59,974
depart from that interpretation,
things get more difficult and to create 

1486
01:20:02,481 --> 01:20:03,314
some kind of disadvantage.
While the part of the problem with that 

1487
01:20:05,171 --> 01:20:07,120
would be that as you move away from the 
texts,

1488
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:08,170
you fractionate

1489
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:11,610
the moral belief system and you end up 
with a nihilistic city situation.

1490
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:16,110
So as you move away from dogmatism,
you move towards the parallel danger,

1491
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:16,944
which is moral relativism and nihilism.
And so hopefully you can find some 

1492
01:20:20,131 --> 01:20:21,000
ballots.
So

1493
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:23,200
let me ask you to know.
I want to ask you a question.

1494
01:20:23,230 --> 01:20:24,063
Oh yes.
Okay.

1495
01:20:24,690 --> 01:20:27,840
And also what time do we actually start 
this 10?

1496
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:32,170
I just missed the timecard but I think 
we have another couple of minutes.

1497
01:20:33,490 --> 01:20:34,323
So

1498
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:36,400
no objective reality to time.
I think

1499
01:20:38,490 --> 01:20:40,570
actually it's a pretty good conversation
we could have,

1500
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:41,433
but.
Okay.

1501
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:43,693
So here's my question for you is
if we agree that there is some way in 

1502
01:20:50,991 --> 01:20:51,824
which religious texts carry some kind of
value because they allow people to 

1503
01:20:57,500 --> 01:21:02,140
figure out how to navigate their lives 
in ways that might reduce suffering,

1504
01:21:02,141 --> 01:21:04,670
reduced the complexity of the choices 
that they have to make.

1505
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:10,420
Presumably you will agree that that 
would be consistent with an evolutionary

1506
01:21:10,611 --> 01:21:11,444
interpretation that the fact that the 
stories themselves are functional would 

1507
01:21:16,431 --> 01:21:18,860
provide an advantage to those who were 
deploying them.

1508
01:21:18,950 --> 01:21:20,390
Yes,
so here's the problem,

1509
01:21:21,950 --> 01:21:22,783
isn't it then also true that those 
stories are responsive to past 

1510
01:21:26,571 --> 01:21:27,404
environments and so the claim that these
things might be timeless would be 

1511
01:21:30,861 --> 01:21:35,861
suspect and in fact you would expect a 
spectrum of durability.

1512
01:21:36,381 --> 01:21:41,150
Some stories would be right in a brief 
moment and all that's true.

1513
01:21:41,210 --> 01:21:43,040
All that's true.
So far so good.

1514
01:21:43,100 --> 01:21:44,270
Well,
so far so good.

1515
01:21:44,271 --> 01:21:45,800
This is.
This is actually,

1516
01:21:45,890 --> 01:21:50,890
I think quite excellent then because 
what we have is a recognition that there

1517
01:21:51,921 --> 01:21:52,754
is something to these belief systems 
that has to do with practical realities 

1518
01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:57,853
in the past and we also have an 
acknowledgement that we cannot trust in 

1519
01:22:00,771 --> 01:22:01,604
these things based on simple faith 
because even if they aren't can be 

1520
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:07,760
certain to have worked at some point in 
the past.

1521
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:11,000
We don't know what their relevance is to
the president.

1522
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:13,230
Right.
Okay.

1523
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:14,693
Fair enough.

1524
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:24,690
That's an I would say that's.
That's two things about that.

1525
01:22:27,210 --> 01:22:28,043
That's exactly why we're having this 
discussion and you see what happens in 

1526
01:22:33,361 --> 01:22:34,194
the most profound of such texts is the 
idea that the process by which your 

1527
01:22:39,691 --> 01:22:44,691
knowledge is updated has to occupy a 
position in the hierarchy of values that

1528
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:50,130
supersedes your reliance on dogma is the
fundamental claim.

1529
01:22:50,790 --> 01:22:51,930
That's why,
for example,

1530
01:22:51,931 --> 01:22:52,764
in Christianity,
the notion is is that the word is the 

1531
01:22:54,691 --> 01:22:55,524
highest values and that's embodied word 
and that's the thing that mediates 

1532
01:22:59,131 --> 01:22:59,964
between order and chaos and everything 
else has to be subject to that and I 

1533
01:23:03,181 --> 01:23:04,860
would say that's not a claim that's 
unique to.

1534
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:06,363
So for example,

1535
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:08,580
I think because we're,
we're being,

1536
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:09,573
we're being told we're out of time here,
so I want to give Sam his reaction to 

1537
01:23:12,221 --> 01:23:14,230
that as well and then we'll move on to q
and a.

1538
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:22,380
I'm tempted to just asked Jordan the 
question here.

1539
01:23:22,381 --> 01:23:23,214
I know this,
it's hard to know what to save for 

1540
01:23:24,421 --> 01:23:25,254
tomorrow night,
but I feel like we've got 3000 people 

1541
01:23:27,001 --> 01:23:29,040
sitting here who would really like an 
answer to this question.

1542
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:38,120
You say you believe in God,
you have been.

1543
01:23:38,150 --> 01:23:40,250
No,
I say I act as if he exists,

1544
01:23:40,310 --> 01:23:41,143
you'd say what I say,
I act as if he exists a much more 

1545
01:23:44,841 --> 01:23:46,500
precise claim.
Okay,

1546
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:47,650
so.
So then what,

1547
01:23:47,651 --> 01:23:49,100
what?
But in this case what.

1548
01:23:51,870 --> 01:23:52,703
So you act as though God exists and in 
addition I've heard you say that I act 

1549
01:23:57,420 --> 01:23:58,253
as though God exists,
that I can't really be an atheist so 

1550
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:04,020
far.
We'll see that the night is young.

1551
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:13,260
So in that sense I'm not really an 
atheist.

1552
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:14,480
I've,
I've heard you say this,

1553
01:24:15,410 --> 01:24:17,050
some of you is.
Well,

1554
01:24:17,790 --> 01:24:22,770
if I were really an atheist I would be 
far more poorly behaved and in fact I am

1555
01:24:22,830 --> 01:24:23,663
right.
I would be like risk on the cough 

1556
01:24:24,570 --> 01:24:27,350
committing murders and assuming there 
was nothing wrong with it more,

1557
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:28,890
it would be more likely.
Yes.

1558
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:29,560
Yeah.
Okay.

1559
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:30,393
So.
So that's a big distinction I need to 

1560
01:24:33,350 --> 01:24:35,160
know more likely.
What was that?

1561
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:36,083
It's a big distinction that you would,
is very different than it would be more 

1562
01:24:39,301 --> 01:24:41,340
likely.
Taking the safety off the gun is not the

1563
01:24:41,341 --> 01:24:43,070
same thing as shooting it.
Right.

1564
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:47,250
The temptations laid open to risk and 
would be more at hand.

1565
01:24:47,690 --> 01:24:49,230
Okay.
Just as they were to him.

1566
01:24:49,590 --> 01:24:54,590
So what in that.
So in what sense do you mean?

1567
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:59,920
What is the God that you act as though 
he,

1568
01:25:00,601 --> 01:25:03,200
she it exists,
and what is the what?

1569
01:25:03,210 --> 01:25:04,043
What is the God shaped thing I must have
in my life to prevent me from being a 

1570
01:25:08,551 --> 01:25:10,230
quote real atheist?

1571
01:25:10,690 --> 01:25:11,770
Well,
okay.

1572
01:25:11,830 --> 01:25:12,663
First of all,
I have to point out that there's no 

1573
01:25:13,991 --> 01:25:16,480
possible way I can answer both those 
questions in two minutes.

1574
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:18,160
Well,
it's the same question.

1575
01:25:18,870 --> 01:25:20,600
Like what?
What do you mean by God?

1576
01:25:20,730 --> 01:25:21,361
Okay.
Well,

1577
01:25:21,361 --> 01:25:24,110
I'm going to tell you some of the things
that I mean by God.

1578
01:25:25,710 --> 01:25:28,530
We do have to get the quizzes.
I'm going to do this tomorrow.

1579
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:30,060
Maybe this is where we start.

1580
01:25:31,930 --> 01:25:33,030
Well,
that was

1581
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:34,163
pretty resentful.
I seems like that constitutes an 

1582
01:25:36,451 --> 01:25:38,220
audience question,
wouldn't you say?

1583
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:39,760
I tell you what,
I'll tell you what,

1584
01:25:40,110 --> 01:25:45,110
let's
let's do this,

1585
01:25:47,261 --> 01:25:49,720
but let's be deliberate about time.

1586
01:25:49,900 --> 01:25:51,010
Okay?
Okay.

1587
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:52,420
Okay.
Well,

1588
01:25:52,490 --> 01:25:53,323
I'm,
I'm,

1589
01:25:53,410 --> 01:25:54,243
I'm going to read some things that I 
wrote because it's so complicated that 

1590
01:25:57,160 --> 01:25:59,890
I'm not sure that I can just spin it off
the top of my head.

1591
01:25:59,891 --> 01:26:02,710
And so you'll have to excuse me.
So,

1592
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:06,040
and what I'm going to do is sort of 
paint a picture by by,

1593
01:26:06,230 --> 01:26:09,230
by highlighting different things.
So now are already made.

1594
01:26:09,290 --> 01:26:10,123
One point here,
I made the point that part of the 

1595
01:26:12,651 --> 01:26:13,484
conception of God that underlies the 
western ethos is the notion that 

1596
01:26:17,360 --> 01:26:18,193
whatever God is expressed in truth,
the truthful speech that rectifies 

1597
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:25,520
pathological hierarchies and that isn't 
all it does,

1598
01:26:25,521 --> 01:26:30,050
it also confronts the chaos of being 
itself and generates habitable order.

1599
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,090
That's a,
that's the metaphysical proposition,

1600
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:36,470
and that that's best conceptualized as 
at least one element of God.

1601
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,633
And so I would think about it as a 
transcendent reality that's only 

1602
01:26:40,041 --> 01:26:42,590
observable across the longest of 
timeframes.

1603
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:44,960
The longest have iterated timeframes to 
your point.

1604
01:26:45,410 --> 01:26:46,250
So,
so,

1605
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:48,110
okay,
so here's,

1606
01:26:48,111 --> 01:26:48,944
here's some propositions and they're 
complicated and they need to be 

1607
01:26:51,741 --> 01:26:52,574
unpacked.
So I'm just going to read them and 

1608
01:26:54,170 --> 01:26:55,003
that'll have to do for the time being.
So God is how we imaginatively and 

1609
01:26:59,391 --> 01:27:03,560
collectively represent the existence and
action of consciousness across time,

1610
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:04,993
as the most real aspects of existence 
manifest themselves across the longest 

1611
01:27:08,151 --> 01:27:11,330
of timeframes,
but are not necessarily apprehensible as

1612
01:27:11,331 --> 01:27:12,164
objects in the here and now.
So what that means in some senses that 

1613
01:27:14,781 --> 01:27:15,614
you have conceptions of reality built 
into your biological and metaphysical 

1614
01:27:18,591 --> 01:27:21,350
structure that are consequence of 
processes,

1615
01:27:21,351 --> 01:27:22,184
of evolution,
that that occurred over unbelievably 

1616
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:25,393
vast expanses of time and that structure
your perception of reality in ways that 

1617
01:27:30,020 --> 01:27:30,853
it wouldn't be structured if you only 
live for the amount of time that you're 

1618
01:27:33,111 --> 01:27:33,944
going to live,
and that's also part of the problem of 

1619
01:27:36,201 --> 01:27:37,034
deriving values from fact because you're
evanescent and and you can derive the 

1620
01:27:41,151 --> 01:27:45,530
right values from the facts that portray
themselves to you in your lifespan,

1621
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:46,393
which is why you have a biological 
structure that's like three point 5 

1622
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:50,023
billion years old,
so god is that which eternally dies and 

1623
01:27:52,641 --> 01:27:55,520
is reborn in the pursuit of higher being
in truth.

1624
01:27:55,730 --> 01:27:57,860
That's a fundamental element of hero 
mythology.

1625
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:00,830
God is the highest value in the 
hierarchy of values.

1626
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:01,913
It's another way of looking at it.
God is what calls and what responds in 

1627
01:28:05,121 --> 01:28:08,960
the eternal call to adventure.
God is the voice of conscience.

1628
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,900
God is the source of judgment and mercy 
in guilt.

1629
01:28:12,380 --> 01:28:13,213
God is the future to which we make 
sacrifices and something akin to the 

1630
01:28:17,331 --> 01:28:21,020
transcendental repository of reputation.
Here's a cool one.

1631
01:28:21,021 --> 01:28:24,050
If you're an evolutionary biologist,
God,

1632
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:25,873
God,
God is that which selects among men in 

1633
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:31,650
the eternal hierarchy of men,
so you know,

1634
01:28:31,670 --> 01:28:32,503
men arrange themselves into hierarchies 
and then men rise in the hierarchy and 

1635
01:28:36,471 --> 01:28:37,304
there's principles that are important 
that determine the probability of their 

1636
01:28:40,581 --> 01:28:43,670
rise and those principles aren't 
tyrannical power.

1637
01:28:43,671 --> 01:28:44,504
There are something like the ability to 
articulate truth and the ability to be 

1638
01:28:47,721 --> 01:28:50,960
competent and the ability to make 
appropriate moral judgements,

1639
01:28:50,961 --> 01:28:53,390
and if you can do that in a given 
situation,

1640
01:28:53,391 --> 01:28:56,630
then all the other men will vote you up 
the hierarchy so to speak,

1641
01:28:56,631 --> 01:28:57,464
and that will radically increase your 
reproductive fitness and the operation 

1642
01:29:00,321 --> 01:29:02,400
of that process.
Long expanses

1643
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:03,233
of time looks to me like it's codified 
in something like the notion of God the 

1644
01:29:05,761 --> 01:29:06,594
father.
It's also the same thing that makes 

1645
01:29:08,311 --> 01:29:11,220
women men attractive to women because 
men,

1646
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:12,113
women peel off the top of the male 
hierarchy and the question is what 

1647
01:29:14,731 --> 01:29:15,564
should be at the top of the hierarchy 
and the answer right now is tyranny as 

1648
01:29:18,871 --> 01:29:19,704
part of the patriarchy,
but the real answer is something more 

1649
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:22,314
like the ability to use truthful speech 
in the service of let's say wellbeing 

1650
01:29:26,670 --> 01:29:27,503
and so that's something that operates 
across tremendous expenses of time and 

1651
01:29:31,141 --> 01:29:34,020
it plays a role in the selection for 
survival itself,

1652
01:29:34,021 --> 01:29:35,580
which makes it a fundamental reality.

1653
01:29:35,700 --> 01:29:36,490
Jordan?
Ivanka,

1654
01:29:36,490 --> 01:29:40,040
I just cut in here with one question 
that for now

1655
01:29:40,470 --> 01:29:41,303
what?

1656
01:29:47,550 --> 01:29:48,383
So I was not hearing in that list of 
attributes a god who could care if 

1657
01:29:53,791 --> 01:29:58,791
anyone masturbated.
I was not hearing a God who

1658
01:29:59,020 --> 01:30:00,820
depends on what else is stopping you 
from doing.

1659
01:30:00,821 --> 01:30:03,190
Sam,
sorry,

1660
01:30:03,191 --> 01:30:04,024
I missed that.
I said it depends on what else is 

1661
01:30:06,851 --> 01:30:08,260
stopping you from doing

1662
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:09,801
well.
Yeah.

1663
01:30:09,801 --> 01:30:12,470
Okay,
so it's serious.

1664
01:30:12,471 --> 01:30:14,750
It's important to do something other 
than masturbate.

1665
01:30:14,830 --> 01:30:15,663
Yes.

1666
01:30:16,550 --> 01:30:17,730
Yes.
Which is which,

1667
01:30:17,990 --> 01:30:20,870
which actually constitutes a problem,
which is harder

1668
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:21,923
sounds.

1669
01:30:26,690 --> 01:30:27,523
I'm not hearing a God,
a personal God who can possibly hear 

1670
01:30:33,201 --> 01:30:35,360
anyone's prayer is much less answer 
them.

1671
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:36,793
Right,
and I'm wondering what percentage of 

1672
01:30:38,661 --> 01:30:41,060
religious people who would say,
Oh yeah,

1673
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:43,820
I believe in God and it's the most 
important thing in my life.

1674
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:45,973
What percentage of those religious 
people do you think have in mind a god 

1675
01:30:48,441 --> 01:30:49,790
of this sort you just described

1676
01:30:50,150 --> 01:30:50,983
know sam?
It's a good question because when I go 

1677
01:30:52,451 --> 01:30:54,130
talk to people,
when I,

1678
01:30:54,340 --> 01:30:57,280
when I talk to people online and use 
exactly this terminology,

1679
01:30:57,281 --> 01:31:00,450
millions of people listen,
so it's not so obvious which,

1680
01:31:00,490 --> 01:31:02,230
what percentage of people see it this 
way?

1681
01:31:02,231 --> 01:31:04,690
It's maybe that they have the 
intuitions,

1682
01:31:04,691 --> 01:31:06,370
but they haven't been articulated.
Well,

1683
01:31:06,630 --> 01:31:09,800
I mean this is the problem is what 
worries me about this.

1684
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:10,713
So

1685
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:14,373
you.
You could do the same thing with the 

1686
01:31:18,201 --> 01:31:18,620
idea of,
of,

1687
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:19,730
of ghosts,
right?

1688
01:31:19,731 --> 01:31:21,710
So,
so people traditionally have believed in

1689
01:31:21,711 --> 01:31:23,240
ghosts.
It's a,

1690
01:31:23,241 --> 01:31:24,074
it's an archetype.
You might say the ghost survival of 

1691
01:31:26,091 --> 01:31:26,924
death is certainly an archetypes and we 
know what most people most of the time 

1692
01:31:30,321 --> 01:31:32,360
mean when they say they believe in 
ghosts,

1693
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:35,720
and I say,
I don't believe in ghosts,

1694
01:31:36,110 --> 01:31:36,861
and you say,
no,

1695
01:31:36,861 --> 01:31:38,510
no,
you do believe in ghosts.

1696
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:42,920
Ghosts are your relationship to the 
unseen.

1697
01:31:43,370 --> 01:31:44,203
That's a ghost,
so you have a new definition of ghost 

1698
01:31:47,390 --> 01:31:50,630
that you're putting in in place.
Provided which I have to say,

1699
01:31:50,631 --> 01:31:51,464
well,
of course I have a relationship to the 

1700
01:31:52,221 --> 01:31:55,130
unseen,
so I guess I do believe in ghosts.

1701
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:56,330
You win that argument,

1702
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:00,300
but

1703
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:01,133
that

1704
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:05,260
simply isn't what most people mean by a 
ghost most.

1705
01:32:05,510 --> 01:32:06,343
You mean using that simplified argument 
about my conception of ghost as an 

1706
01:32:09,971 --> 01:32:13,240
analogy for the proposition that I just 
put forward is when I see you do.

1707
01:32:13,241 --> 01:32:15,310
I mean maybe you have more to say on the
topic of Guy,

1708
01:32:15,311 --> 01:32:17,620
but this is what I hear you doing with 
God.

1709
01:32:17,621 --> 01:32:18,454
You have defined the God that most 
people believe in and we know this is 

1710
01:32:22,391 --> 01:32:24,760
the God that most people.
I was asked what God I believed in.

1711
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:26,550
I'm asking you

1712
01:32:26,550 --> 01:32:28,110
percentage,
yes,

1713
01:32:28,620 --> 01:32:29,453
but

1714
01:32:29,490 --> 01:32:32,860
you,
you by shifting the definition,

1715
01:32:32,890 --> 01:32:33,723
you have robbed the now and the 
traditional now of its traditional 

1716
01:32:37,541 --> 01:32:39,260
meaning and you're giving your

1717
01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:42,530
partying to people.
Wait a second.

1718
01:32:42,650 --> 01:32:45,770
Wait a second.
I mean by traditional meaning,

1719
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:46,420
look,

1720
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:47,253
it's one of the.
One of the elemental claims in the Old 

1721
01:32:49,421 --> 01:32:50,254
Testament is that you're not even 
supposed to under the name of God 

1722
01:32:52,241 --> 01:32:56,620
because by defining it too tightly,
you lose its essence and so let's not be

1723
01:32:56,621 --> 01:32:59,710
talking about what the classical 
definition of God is here.

1724
01:32:59,711 --> 01:33:01,060
Okay?
It's a historical

1725
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:01,920
starter.
Okay?

1726
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:02,753
Then there's plenty of religions that 
can make in my check in with the 

1727
01:33:04,521 --> 01:33:05,354
audience.
Is the audience all right with us 

1728
01:33:07,581 --> 01:33:08,980
continuing down this.

1729
01:33:10,670 --> 01:33:13,770
Okay,
so can I.

1730
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:15,750
can I jump in here?
Sacrificing

1731
01:33:15,780 --> 01:33:19,990
your q and a so that it is at the 
expense of q and a that's,

1732
01:33:20,020 --> 01:33:20,853
that's given out,
but I

1733
01:33:21,130 --> 01:33:26,130
probably worth.
So let me say,

1734
01:33:26,821 --> 01:33:27,654
Sam,

1735
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:30,433
I do not believe in a supernatural God,
but the God that I've heard Jordan just 

1736
01:33:34,461 --> 01:33:35,294
describe.
I do not have any difficulty 

1737
01:33:38,811 --> 01:33:41,900
understanding why he might care if you 
masturbate.

1738
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:42,853
And I also don't have any trouble 
figuring out how he might answer 

1739
01:33:46,700 --> 01:33:47,533
prayers.

1740
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:50,810
Well,
tell me more.

1741
01:33:51,590 --> 01:33:52,230
Well,
I,

1742
01:33:52,230 --> 01:33:53,730
I can tell you,
I can tell you,

1743
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,890
I can tell you how our prayer might be 
answered.

1744
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,760
Okay?
But these are so specific.

1745
01:33:57,780 --> 01:33:59,100
So good.
Let me do that.

1746
01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:02,220
So it'll be interesting.
So I'm not Jordan,

1747
01:34:02,250 --> 01:34:04,080
we've not talked about this.
If I

1748
01:34:04,540 --> 01:34:05,373
an answer from him that actually would 
satisfy me as to what the mechanism of 

1749
01:34:09,661 --> 01:34:11,030
action might be that,
that,

1750
01:34:11,100 --> 01:34:14,490
that'd be pretty interesting.
And if he can tell me what I heard,

1751
01:34:15,170 --> 01:34:16,003
I think it would,
it would suggest that that we're not 

1752
01:34:17,641 --> 01:34:18,474
just making it.

1753
01:34:18,670 --> 01:34:19,220
Okay.
So,

1754
01:34:19,220 --> 01:34:21,390
so you might like this,
you may be done,

1755
01:34:21,790 --> 01:34:23,980
but it's possible.
Okay.

1756
01:34:23,981 --> 01:34:25,600
So imagine that.
Okay.

1757
01:34:25,630 --> 01:34:28,510
So let's imagine that hellish situation 
that you laid out.

1758
01:34:29,230 --> 01:34:30,011
Okay,
but,

1759
01:34:30,011 --> 01:34:30,844
but let's,
let's put the extra twist in it because 

1760
01:34:32,141 --> 01:34:32,974
one of the things that we both decided,
I think was that you also have to build 

1761
01:34:35,981 --> 01:34:39,370
in the intent into that.
So let's say the hell that we're talking

1762
01:34:39,371 --> 01:34:40,204
about isn't the victim of the terrible 
massacres that you laid out in the 

1763
01:34:44,591 --> 01:34:46,180
jungle story.
But a perpetrator,

1764
01:34:47,080 --> 01:34:47,913
okay,
so someone who's actually acted in a 

1765
01:34:49,481 --> 01:34:51,520
malevolent manner,
truly malevolent manner,

1766
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:52,940
okay.
Or,

1767
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:55,540
or maybe perhaps we wouldn't have to 
take that extreme case.

1768
01:34:55,541 --> 01:34:56,231
We could say,
well,

1769
01:34:56,231 --> 01:34:57,650
perhaps you've,
that

1770
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:58,843
any of you,
you've decided that you've seriously 

1771
01:34:59,991 --> 01:35:04,220
done something wrong and you want to get
away from hail.

1772
01:35:04,221 --> 01:35:06,350
You want to make things better.
Okay?

1773
01:35:06,351 --> 01:35:08,720
So here's,
here's an exercise you can try.

1774
01:35:09,350 --> 01:35:11,300
So what you do is,
is,

1775
01:35:11,560 --> 01:35:14,810
is you sit on the edge of your bed and 
you say,

1776
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:17,600
okay,
what I did was wrong.

1777
01:35:18,290 --> 01:35:20,090
And you have to really believe this,
right?

1778
01:35:20,091 --> 01:35:21,530
So you've thought about it's killing 
you,

1779
01:35:22,190 --> 01:35:23,023
it's killing you.
Now you're a penitent and you're 

1780
01:35:25,071 --> 01:35:26,210
confessing,
let's say,

1781
01:35:26,630 --> 01:35:29,990
and you're confessing to yourself as 
much as to anyone and you say,

1782
01:35:31,070 --> 01:35:31,903
I really want to know what I did wrong 
and I really want to know what I could 

1783
01:35:35,511 --> 01:35:36,344
do to put it right and I'm willing to 
accept any answer that will manifest 

1784
01:35:40,611 --> 01:35:43,250
itself to me.
Try that.

1785
01:35:43,430 --> 01:35:44,600
See what happens.
Yeah,

1786
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:47,750
that's a prayer that will be answered 
and it won't be answered in the way that

1787
01:35:47,751 --> 01:35:49,970
you want it to be answered.
I can bloody well tell you that.

1788
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:50,630
Okay,
but,

1789
01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:52,190
but that.
Well,

1790
01:35:52,230 --> 01:35:55,390
what are you communicating with you 
communicating with what you do

1791
01:35:55,670 --> 01:35:56,503
that that is something that.
That is a process that I'm familiar 

1792
01:36:00,891 --> 01:36:01,724
with.
It doesn't require any supernatural 

1793
01:36:04,790 --> 01:36:05,623
explanation.

1794
01:36:05,690 --> 01:36:09,890
Certainly.
It certainly doesn't require

1795
01:36:10,270 --> 01:36:11,103
that.
We imagine that any of our books were 

1796
01:36:13,361 --> 01:36:14,194
dictated by the creator of the universe.
I didn't say anything so acquired any 

1797
01:36:16,151 --> 01:36:18,250
supernatural gifts.
Nobody shouldn't order to require.

1798
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:23,260
My concern was asked to provide an 
instance of prayer that worked.

1799
01:36:23,450 --> 01:36:24,370
That's what I did.

1800
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:27,970
That's,
that's fully understandable.

1801
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:31,300
In terms of human psychology.

1802
01:36:31,410 --> 01:36:34,110
It's not understandable because we don't
know where the answer comes from.

1803
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:35,700
Well,
we don't know where anything comes from.

1804
01:36:35,701 --> 01:36:36,600
That's true.
Yeah,

1805
01:36:37,050 --> 01:36:40,740
so.
But that doesn't.

1806
01:36:40,950 --> 01:36:42,000
That doesn't open

1807
01:36:42,150 --> 01:36:42,983
door of we one thing we can know with 
absolute certainty that that whoever 

1808
01:36:47,251 --> 01:36:50,730
wrote the Bible didn't know either and 
there's many other things.

1809
01:36:50,731 --> 01:36:51,780
He or she didn't know.

1810
01:36:52,610 --> 01:36:54,980
Everything else we know scientifically,
right?

1811
01:36:56,050 --> 01:36:57,990
So obvious with people.
No one even knew.

1812
01:36:58,090 --> 01:37:00,820
No one even knew the brain was involved 
in any of this.

1813
01:37:00,910 --> 01:37:01,743
Right?
So he probably knew about as much as we 

1814
01:37:03,251 --> 01:37:05,410
do.
About how the brain was involved in it,

1815
01:37:05,500 --> 01:37:06,333
but we've already,
we've already established in some 

1816
01:37:07,901 --> 01:37:08,734
tenuous way that things that nobody 
understands could have evolved into 

1817
01:37:12,311 --> 01:37:14,920
these stories in some way that would be 
useful,

1818
01:37:14,921 --> 01:37:17,140
but nobody knew what they were writing 
when they wrote it.

1819
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:18,373
The problem is that you can so again 
with this has been focused through the 

1820
01:37:21,791 --> 01:37:26,110
lens of your attachment to Christianity 
largely,

1821
01:37:26,170 --> 01:37:27,003
but the Hindus,
Hinduism is a completely different set 

1822
01:37:30,641 --> 01:37:34,570
of stories right now and many of them,
the logic,

1823
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:37,690
the emotional logic,
the psychological import.

1824
01:37:37,750 --> 01:37:42,750
Many of them have the opposite valence 
from any Christian story,

1825
01:37:42,761 --> 01:37:45,100
you would tell the whole notion of like 
for instance,

1826
01:37:45,101 --> 01:37:46,930
the whole notion of good and evil,
right?

1827
01:37:46,931 --> 01:37:47,764
Which has such primacy.
I mean you talk about religion being 

1828
01:37:50,531 --> 01:37:51,364
deeper than ethics because ethics just 
deals with right and wrong and religion 

1829
01:37:54,731 --> 01:37:57,690
deals with and evil right at bedrock,
okay,

1830
01:37:58,260 --> 01:38:03,260
good and evil do not have the same 
meaning in the east.

1831
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:06,360
Buddhism and Hinduism do something very 
different.

1832
01:38:06,370 --> 01:38:09,240
We're willing to accept your definitions
of good and evil.

1833
01:38:09,241 --> 01:38:14,241
For the truth is it's just not even evil
is just ignorance.

1834
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:15,533
On some level,
it's just an evil is just you haven't 

1835
01:38:17,491 --> 01:38:19,620
met any real evil people if you believe 
that,

1836
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:20,101
well,
okay,

1837
01:38:20,101 --> 01:38:22,590
so then all the Hindus and Buddhists are
wrong about this.

1838
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:23,473
That's possible claim.
I'm just saying that there is over a 

1839
01:38:27,031 --> 01:38:32,031
billion people who have a religious 
system of stories from which they derive

1840
01:38:33,121 --> 01:38:37,500
all kinds of meaning to which they're 
mightily attached to where we could play

1841
01:38:37,501 --> 01:38:38,334
the same game of,
of archetypal interpretation and 

1842
01:38:42,811 --> 01:38:43,644
valuing,
and yet the cash value with respect to 

1843
01:38:49,021 --> 01:38:53,010
good and evil is irreconcilable with 
what you get from Christianity,

1844
01:38:53,430 --> 01:38:55,670
but it doesn't,
it doesn't have to be interoperable.

1845
01:38:55,770 --> 01:38:56,410
Right?
But,

1846
01:38:56,410 --> 01:38:56,870
uh,
but,

1847
01:38:56,870 --> 01:38:57,703
but the point is we live in a reality.
Presumably Hinduism is also useful as a 

1848
01:39:03,991 --> 01:39:07,550
set of heuristics to be for Hindus and 
if he,

1849
01:39:07,590 --> 01:39:08,423
if Hinduism as a manner of doctrine and 
as a matter of the interpretations of 

1850
01:39:13,021 --> 01:39:16,530
the Heuristics by the devout in both 
systems,

1851
01:39:17,290 --> 01:39:21,120
if it Hinduism and Christianity are 
irreconcilable,

1852
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:22,273
right,
then there must be a deeper level of 

1853
01:39:25,531 --> 01:39:28,110
reality that explains why they both 
work.

1854
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:33,380
That can't be reducible to Christianity 
being true or Hinduism being true.

1855
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:35,270
Right?
Yeah.

1856
01:39:35,271 --> 01:39:37,230
That's Sam,
that's there's,

1857
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:38,870
there's absolutely nothing

1858
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:40,273
wrong with that objection.
Like so this is one of the immense 

1859
01:39:44,421 --> 01:39:45,254
problems obviously,
that that actually leads down the road 

1860
01:39:48,321 --> 01:39:51,990
to the kind of nihilism that you were 
objecting to in,

1861
01:39:52,050 --> 01:39:53,630
in,
in the moral landscape.

1862
01:39:53,631 --> 01:39:56,500
It's like one of the things that need 
you said was,

1863
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:59,530
it's very much apropos to this is that 
you know,

1864
01:39:59,540 --> 01:40:00,373
it's one thing to have your,
your belief system shattered by the 

1865
01:40:04,580 --> 01:40:05,413
observation that there are other belief 
systems that are incommensurate that 

1866
01:40:07,821 --> 01:40:09,930
seemed to have equal utility so that 
that's.

1867
01:40:10,450 --> 01:40:11,283
But it's even worse is that once you 
make the observation that there are 

1868
01:40:13,851 --> 01:40:16,850
other belief systems that have equal 
utility,

1869
01:40:17,090 --> 01:40:17,923
then it can shatter your belief in 
belief systems themselves and then 

1870
01:40:20,811 --> 01:40:23,910
you're in the postmodern nihilism 
landscape and that's a big problem.

1871
01:40:24,100 --> 01:40:24,933
Or You could just be in a,
in a more fundamental landscape that 

1872
01:40:27,191 --> 01:40:28,210
subsumes both

1873
01:40:29,170 --> 01:40:29,650
fine.
Let's,

1874
01:40:29,650 --> 01:40:30,483
let's hope that that can happen,
but that I would say that's the 

1875
01:40:32,501 --> 01:40:36,190
landscape that I'm trying to pursue.
Now you said that this is,

1876
01:40:36,340 --> 01:40:37,173
that I've been approaching this from a,
from a Christian perspective in this 

1877
01:40:40,061 --> 01:40:43,030
dialogue and to some degree that's true,
but there are reasons for that,

1878
01:40:43,031 --> 01:40:43,864
but I would also say I'm also doing what
you recommend doing because in maps of 

1879
01:40:48,791 --> 01:40:50,470
meaning for example,
because you said,

1880
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:51,333
well,
what about this problem of multiple 

1881
01:40:52,121 --> 01:40:52,954
interpretations?

1882
01:40:52,990 --> 01:40:54,460
You road maps of meaning

1883
01:40:55,420 --> 01:40:57,520
you wrote maps of meaning.
I wrote the moral landscape.

1884
01:40:57,630 --> 01:40:58,780
I must've,
I must've missed it.

1885
01:40:58,810 --> 01:41:01,210
Sorry,
I must have missed it.

1886
01:41:01,690 --> 01:41:04,120
I missed starting to get tired,
but

1887
01:41:06,130 --> 01:41:06,963
what I tried to do it well,
I tried to address that problem 

1888
01:41:09,401 --> 01:41:11,440
seriously.
Like it's a really big problem.

1889
01:41:11,860 --> 01:41:13,900
Was the problem of multiple 
interpretations.

1890
01:41:14,170 --> 01:41:15,003
It's the postmodern problem is if 
there's an infinite number of potential 

1891
01:41:17,831 --> 01:41:19,330
interpretations.
Okay.

1892
01:41:19,331 --> 01:41:20,011
So.
Oh,

1893
01:41:20,011 --> 01:41:20,844
so what do we do about that?
And the answer is it's something you 

1894
01:41:22,931 --> 01:41:24,000
alluded to,
I'm sorry,

1895
01:41:24,010 --> 01:41:25,660
in,
in the moral landscape,

1896
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:26,913
and it's part of the basis of your 
argument why these things need to be 

1897
01:41:29,621 --> 01:41:33,670
grounded in facts.
So because that is part of the answer to

1898
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:37,150
the problem of an infinite number of 
interpretations in maps of meaning,

1899
01:41:37,151 --> 01:41:39,220
I tried to do what Ian Wilson 
recommended,

1900
01:41:39,221 --> 01:41:42,940
but this was before he wrote his book.
I tried to use a consilience approach.

1901
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:45,700
So I looked at multiple religious 
systems.

1902
01:41:45,701 --> 01:41:48,370
I looked at Christianity,
I looked at evolutionary biology,

1903
01:41:48,371 --> 01:41:52,210
I looked at philosophy,
I looked at neuroscience and I looked at

1904
01:41:52,450 --> 01:41:56,770
the literature on emotion and motivation
and the literature on play that was very

1905
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:57,633
nicely delineated by piaget and I tried 
to see where there was a pattern that 

1906
01:42:01,751 --> 01:42:04,660
repeated across all dimensions of 
evaluation,

1907
01:42:04,661 --> 01:42:06,520
which is exactly what you do.
For example,

1908
01:42:06,521 --> 01:42:09,730
when you use your five senses to detect 
something real in the world.

1909
01:42:10,090 --> 01:42:12,910
And that's what Wilson recommended was a
consilience approach.

1910
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:14,043
And so my proposition was if it 
manifests itself here and here and here 

1911
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:21,760
and here and here,
six places,

1912
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:22,683
and it's always the same pattern than 
the probability that that pattern 

1913
01:42:25,211 --> 01:42:26,044
exists.
Independent of my delusional 

1914
01:42:28,031 --> 01:42:30,820
interpretation is radically decreased.

1915
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:32,510
My claim,
however,

1916
01:42:32,511 --> 01:42:35,120
is that many of these things don't 
repeat.

1917
01:42:35,121 --> 01:42:35,954
In fact,
they're flipped around completely based 

1918
01:42:38,211 --> 01:42:40,580
on different religious assumptions and 
different cultures,

1919
01:42:40,790 --> 01:42:42,810
and again,
I would just argue that this is.

1920
01:42:42,820 --> 01:42:46,260
We can disband discussion is trying to 
dispense with those,

1921
01:42:46,510 --> 01:42:47,343
but I'm just saying something as 
fundamental as evil doesn't run through 

1922
01:42:50,570 --> 01:42:52,730
all these cultures and all these 
religious traditions.

1923
01:42:52,770 --> 01:42:53,603
Then how can you make the claim that 
everyone would agree with your 

1924
01:42:55,681 --> 01:42:57,540
description of what constitutes bad

1925
01:42:58,760 --> 01:43:00,160
landscape?
It would be.

1926
01:43:00,550 --> 01:43:01,600
It just,
it's just not.

1927
01:43:01,930 --> 01:43:06,060
It's not evil in the sense that it's.
There's banter,

1928
01:43:06,370 --> 01:43:08,110
there's better and worse.
There's better and worse.

1929
01:43:08,860 --> 01:43:09,693
Can we?
Can we?

1930
01:43:09,810 --> 01:43:13,260
There's either universal moral 
intuitions or there honest no it.

1931
01:43:13,390 --> 01:43:14,223
Yes.
No.

1932
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:19,290
Are some moral intuitions universal?
Yes.

1933
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:19,780
No,
I would.

1934
01:43:19,780 --> 01:43:21,480
I would think.
Listen,

1935
01:43:21,481 --> 01:43:23,940
we are just human beings,
right?

1936
01:43:23,941 --> 01:43:27,180
We're human beings first before we're 
Hindu or Buddhist or Christian,

1937
01:43:27,181 --> 01:43:30,060
but we can all get indoctrinated into 
the religion of our parents.

1938
01:43:30,270 --> 01:43:31,890
This is a,
an artifice.

1939
01:43:31,950 --> 01:43:33,930
This laid on top of something far 
deeper.

1940
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:35,410
That should be obvious.
So.

1941
01:43:35,490 --> 01:43:36,091
Right.
So,

1942
01:43:36,091 --> 01:43:38,610
so we're trying to get down to what's 
deeper.

1943
01:43:38,740 --> 01:43:39,660
Okay,
so there may be,

1944
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:42,570
there may be some moral universal's.
Sure.

1945
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:43,433
I think Jordan would know,
but possible that there are some moral 

1946
01:43:47,881 --> 01:43:51,240
intuitions that are highly specific to 
particular

1947
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:54,230
and wouldn't translate over to others.
Yes,

1948
01:43:54,730 --> 01:43:58,330
so highly probable because there would 
be environment specific adaptations like

1949
01:43:58,331 --> 01:44:00,950
the environment specific tool use of 
chimpanzees.

1950
01:44:01,370 --> 01:44:02,150
Right,
right.

1951
01:44:02,150 --> 01:44:02,983
Or maybe it's not even the environment.
Maybe it's the self consistency of the 

1952
01:44:06,081 --> 01:44:06,914
belief pattern in question,
so I'm sure I would put that in the 

1953
01:44:09,261 --> 01:44:10,094
broader environment.
It might be a consequence of the 

1954
01:44:11,391 --> 01:44:13,940
particularities of that culture.
There will be things that look,

1955
01:44:13,970 --> 01:44:16,820
think about it like languages,
like many,

1956
01:44:16,821 --> 01:44:19,850
and this is kind of an answer to the 
problem that you laid out,

1957
01:44:19,851 --> 01:44:22,130
which is a real problem.
I'm not trying to deny the problem.

1958
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:24,740
If you look at there's a lot of 
languages,

1959
01:44:25,160 --> 01:44:27,110
lots of languages.
Look at how different they are.

1960
01:44:27,111 --> 01:44:27,741
It's like,
yeah,

1961
01:44:27,741 --> 01:44:28,574
at some levels of analysis they're 
fundamentally different and at other 

1962
01:44:30,561 --> 01:44:32,510
levels of analysis,
they're fundamentally the same,

1963
01:44:32,511 --> 01:44:34,940
which is how we know that their 
languages and you could say,

1964
01:44:34,941 --> 01:44:35,774
well,
there's into very large number of 

1965
01:44:36,381 --> 01:44:37,070
stories.

1966
01:44:37,070 --> 01:44:37,581
It's like,
yes,

1967
01:44:37,581 --> 01:44:38,414
there are,
but the fact that there's enough 

1968
01:44:41,331 --> 01:44:42,164
commonality across the class of stories,
the set of all possible stories so that 

1969
01:44:44,961 --> 01:44:45,794
we can identify what constitutes a story
and I would say that there's enough 

1970
01:44:48,351 --> 01:44:51,800
commonality across the set of all 
possible good stories that we can say,

1971
01:44:51,801 --> 01:44:53,210
well,
here's a canonical good story,

1972
01:44:53,330 --> 01:44:54,163
which is by the way,
what you do at the beginning of the 

1973
01:44:55,281 --> 01:44:58,700
moral landscape because you say,
this is horrible,

1974
01:44:58,730 --> 01:44:59,563
this is good.
We should move from what's horrible to 

1975
01:45:01,431 --> 01:45:02,900
what's good.
Say yes,

1976
01:45:02,901 --> 01:45:03,440
you're,
you've,

1977
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:06,230
you've,
you've taken a fragment of the universal

1978
01:45:06,231 --> 01:45:09,530
story and you've made it the axiom of 
your moral system,

1979
01:45:09,531 --> 01:45:11,600
which is what you should do it,
but,

1980
01:45:11,601 --> 01:45:15,890
but the claim that I think is not 
helpful,

1981
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:21,400
even though I understand it,
is that that's purely a claim of like of

1982
01:45:21,771 --> 01:45:24,140
unmediated fact.
It's like,

1983
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:26,090
no,
there is no need.

1984
01:45:26,630 --> 01:45:30,420
There is yes.
Even facts aren't unmediated facts.

1985
01:45:30,630 --> 01:45:31,463
I mean you can't hand.
You can't judge something to be factual 

1986
01:45:33,661 --> 01:45:36,630
without presupposing the validity of 
certain intuitions.

1987
01:45:36,631 --> 01:45:37,351
Like,
right?

1988
01:45:37,351 --> 01:45:40,370
That that causes proceed events,
you know,

1989
01:45:40,371 --> 01:45:42,330
so,
or causes precede their effects.

1990
01:45:43,260 --> 01:45:46,020
And those intuitions could be wrong.
I mean,

1991
01:45:46,021 --> 01:45:46,854
we could live in a teleological universe
where everything is getting pulled into 

1992
01:45:49,111 --> 01:45:51,090
the future by some kind of attractor.
Right?

1993
01:45:51,450 --> 01:45:53,880
And our notion of causation is totally 
backwards.

1994
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:57,930
That remains to be discovered.
And we have,

1995
01:45:57,960 --> 01:46:02,650
we would use other intuitions to make 
that discovery again,

1996
01:46:02,850 --> 01:46:03,683
again,
that you do pull yourself up by your 

1997
01:46:04,711 --> 01:46:05,544
bootstraps and that there's,
there's no branch of science or 

1998
01:46:09,781 --> 01:46:13,740
mathematics or anything fundamental 
logic that can get away from that.

1999
01:46:14,050 --> 01:46:16,740
But that's another place.
But given that picture,

2000
01:46:16,741 --> 01:46:21,510
that doesn't render all intuitions 
equally respectable,

2001
01:46:21,780 --> 01:46:23,000
absolutely.
Someone says,

2002
01:46:23,020 --> 01:46:24,600
Oh,
I happen to have an intuition that,

2003
01:46:24,630 --> 01:46:27,840
that Joseph Smith who saw those golden 
tablets and they were,

2004
01:46:27,900 --> 01:46:28,770
you know,
uh,

2005
01:46:29,050 --> 01:46:29,883
uh,
you know,

2006
01:46:29,890 --> 01:46:30,723
in mormonism is true.
That's not the sort of intuition we're 

2007
01:46:33,121 --> 01:46:33,954
talking about here.
Your intuition doesn't give you insight 

2008
01:46:36,391 --> 01:46:37,100
into history.
We could

2009
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:38,810
say,
and this would be an elaboration of,

2010
01:46:38,870 --> 01:46:39,990
of,
of,

2011
01:46:40,090 --> 01:46:40,923
uh,
Brett's point is that moral intuitions 

2012
01:46:45,021 --> 01:46:48,980
of the sort that you're describing have 
different zones of relevance.

2013
01:46:49,170 --> 01:46:50,280
So there's some things

2014
01:46:50,550 --> 01:46:55,550
that would only work as an intuition in 
very delimited areas of time and space.

2015
01:46:56,341 --> 01:46:57,174
Let's say there's a hierarchy of moral 
intuitions and the more profound the 

2016
01:47:00,181 --> 01:47:01,014
intuition,
the more it works as a universal truth 

2017
01:47:02,341 --> 01:47:04,860
across context,
just like in a scientific truth.

2018
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:06,173
So scientific truth is more profound.
This is why the postmodernist readings 

2019
01:47:10,231 --> 01:47:11,064
of Thomas Kuhn are wrong,
is that the idea that protons are real 

2020
01:47:14,550 --> 01:47:15,383
is really fundamental because no matter 
what span of time and space that you 

2021
01:47:18,781 --> 01:47:21,540
pick,
you're going to encounter protons.

2022
01:47:21,690 --> 01:47:24,960
It works everywhere.
And then with moral intuitions,

2023
01:47:25,110 --> 01:47:25,943
let's say,
or moral a priorities you have the same 

2024
01:47:27,181 --> 01:47:28,014
issue is some of them are so limited 
that they only work here and now and 

2025
01:47:31,510 --> 01:47:34,530
those are sort of impulsive,
low level intuitions,

2026
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:36,750
a whim even.
But some of them are really,

2027
01:47:36,751 --> 01:47:37,860
really deep.
The ones,

2028
01:47:37,890 --> 01:47:38,723
for example,
the one that orients you to make the 

2029
01:47:40,711 --> 01:47:43,320
claim that you made in the moral 
landscape,

2030
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:47,190
that the hellish story is bad and the 
heavenly story is good.

2031
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:50,700
I would say that's one of the deepest,
most context,

2032
01:47:50,701 --> 01:47:53,820
independent moral intuitions which,
which is kind of the claim.

2033
01:47:53,821 --> 01:47:54,490
You make access.

2034
01:47:54,490 --> 01:47:55,323
You claim that as again,
go back to my fundamental concern here 

2035
01:47:57,551 --> 01:47:58,384
in the difference with respect to the 
difference in how we talk about these 

2036
01:48:00,461 --> 01:48:05,461
things to call that thing.
God is fine.

2037
01:48:05,981 --> 01:48:08,650
That's a god I have no problem with.
Right?

2038
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:09,513
But that's not how most people most of 
the time are you using the word and 

2039
01:48:12,941 --> 01:48:15,000
there's something misleading about that 
and that's.

2040
01:48:15,590 --> 01:48:16,460
That worries me.
Yeah.

2041
01:48:16,461 --> 01:48:17,294
Well,
if,

2042
01:48:17,330 --> 01:48:21,350
if the claim,
if the claim that you're making is.

2043
01:48:21,530 --> 01:48:26,060
We're all deeply confused about the 
nature of divinity and ultimate reality,

2044
01:48:26,061 --> 01:48:27,140
it's like,
yeah,

2045
01:48:27,430 --> 01:48:29,060
yes.
Clearly.

2046
01:48:29,650 --> 01:48:31,840
The other thing we agree on,
I also don't disagree.

2047
01:48:31,930 --> 01:48:33,580
I don't disagree.
Look,

2048
01:48:33,640 --> 01:48:34,473
I've never said I've never made the 
claim that what I'm talking about is 

2049
01:48:39,880 --> 01:48:42,640
like what other people are talking 
about.

2050
01:48:42,700 --> 01:48:43,533
I mean it is in some ways,
but I've not made that claim so I don't 

2051
01:48:46,241 --> 01:48:48,750
see why that's a justifiable criticism.
It's like,

2052
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:50,330
no,
it's a,

2053
01:48:50,340 --> 01:48:55,340
it's a criticism can the with respect to
the very likely effects of communicating

2054
01:48:56,941 --> 01:48:59,940
in that way because I see the results of
that communication.

2055
01:48:59,941 --> 01:49:00,840
It's a little bit.
I mean,

2056
01:49:00,841 --> 01:49:02,640
this is going to sound more invidious 
than it is,

2057
01:49:02,641 --> 01:49:04,980
but this is the kind of thing that I get
into a Deepak Chopra.

2058
01:49:05,490 --> 01:49:07,500
Yeah,
Deepak and I agree.

2059
01:49:08,030 --> 01:49:10,420
I think it's more invidious than it 
sounds actually.

2060
01:49:12,430 --> 01:49:13,263
Well,
you're not wearing rhinestone book 

2061
01:49:14,090 --> 01:49:16,660
classes with you if you graduate to 
that.

2062
01:49:16,690 --> 01:49:20,110
We'll have more of a problem,
but it's.

2063
01:49:20,780 --> 01:49:21,613
Deepak clearly wants to let his audience
believe that everything they're into is 

2064
01:49:29,681 --> 01:49:34,681
on some level justifiable by his reading
of quantum spookiness.

2065
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:36,473
Right?
So it's all.

2066
01:49:36,510 --> 01:49:37,343
So if you want to go out and just buy a 
lot of crystals and think they're going 

2067
01:49:41,471 --> 01:49:42,304
to heal you,
it has something to do with quantum 

2068
01:49:44,980 --> 01:49:47,890
quantum reality.
Nothing me know,

2069
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:49,470
but saying,
but I,

2070
01:49:49,590 --> 01:49:51,700
I think deeply could say if,
if I,

2071
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:55,600
if I got his back to the wall,
Deepak could say,

2072
01:49:55,601 --> 01:49:57,400
honestly say,
listen,

2073
01:49:57,940 --> 01:50:00,250
I've never said anything about crystals,
right?

2074
01:50:00,251 --> 01:50:02,470
I'm not selling crystals.
I've never said they work,

2075
01:50:02,860 --> 01:50:07,860
but it's the way in which he's failing 
to make the clear differentiation.

2076
01:50:08,141 --> 01:50:10,480
The fact that the fact that it takes you
20 minutes

2077
01:50:11,230 --> 01:50:13,330
to admit that there is that

2078
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:18,430
a lot of the Bible is filled with 
barbaric nonsense.

2079
01:50:18,860 --> 01:50:23,480
It took me 20 minutes to it.
We'll go to the tape on that.

2080
01:50:23,500 --> 01:50:24,333
These things matter.
These things matter and I'm just saying 

2081
01:50:27,581 --> 01:50:30,690
it's like you were saying,
if you're.

2082
01:50:30,890 --> 01:50:31,670
If you're

2083
01:50:31,670 --> 01:50:32,503
parish of one or in a parish of 1000 or 
a parish of 100,000 but not in the 

2084
01:50:38,031 --> 01:50:41,510
parish that has anything in common with 
the with the Bible.

2085
01:50:41,511 --> 01:50:42,344
Thumper is in my country who think that 
Jesus is very likely coming back in 

2086
01:50:47,001 --> 01:50:47,834
their lifetime because he never died and
he's going to judge the living and the 

2087
01:50:50,721 --> 01:50:55,220
dead and there will be a resurrection 
and hell fire and all the rest.

2088
01:50:55,221 --> 01:50:58,040
If that's not the game,
you're playing at all.

2089
01:50:58,740 --> 01:50:59,573
Own it.

2090
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:05,810
Why?
Why are you?

2091
01:51:06,100 --> 01:51:09,220
Why are you?
Why are you all applauding about that?

2092
01:51:09,610 --> 01:51:10,190
It's like,
what?

2093
01:51:10,190 --> 01:51:11,830
What do you mean to own it?
It's like,

2094
01:51:11,831 --> 01:51:12,664
I already made my claim.
It's like I'm not playing a religious 

2095
01:51:14,831 --> 01:51:15,664
fundamentalist game,
so what's all the applause about so I 

2096
01:51:18,161 --> 01:51:19,150
don't understand that

2097
01:51:20,580 --> 01:51:23,240
and own it.
It's like I was as listened.

2098
01:51:23,730 --> 01:51:24,563
I was as clear as I possibly could be 
when I delineated my answer to the 

2099
01:51:28,741 --> 01:51:30,300
question.
Some people say,

2100
01:51:30,301 --> 01:51:31,570
well,
what do you mean by God?

2101
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:36,180
Somebody asked you if Jesus one 
residence second answer,

2102
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:38,080
but no.
Well forget it man.

2103
01:51:38,950 --> 01:51:41,610
When a women.
I think we can actually.

2104
01:51:42,300 --> 01:51:43,360
This is a complicated.

2105
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:45,100
No,
I don't want to end on.

2106
01:51:45,490 --> 01:51:47,500
I don't want to end on a note of 
acrimony,

2107
01:51:47,530 --> 01:51:48,363
but someone wants to ask you whether you
thought Jesus was literally resurrected 

2108
01:51:52,300 --> 01:51:55,270
and you said it would take me 40 hours 
to answer that question.

2109
01:51:56,050 --> 01:51:57,000
Okay.
That's,

2110
01:51:57,170 --> 01:51:58,003
that's,
that's the kind of thing I'm responding 

2111
01:51:58,811 --> 01:52:00,580
to here.
You don't need to do that.

2112
01:52:00,610 --> 01:52:03,400
If you have a clear cut answer to that 
question,

2113
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:07,680
I don't have a clear head and if you 
don't and if you don't do that,

2114
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:10,890
that connects with many other things 
that we still have to talk about.

2115
01:52:11,070 --> 01:52:12,040
Yes,
definitely.

2116
01:52:12,041 --> 01:52:12,874
Yeah,
and I think because a cause that it 

2117
01:52:14,990 --> 01:52:19,560
isn't obvious in the biblical account 
that Christ was literally resurrected,

2118
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:21,840
so it's not simple.
No.

2119
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:23,850
No,
but if the question is,

2120
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:25,560
do you think he let?
Let's,

2121
01:52:25,590 --> 01:52:27,840
let's put it probabilistically.
I mean anything's possible.

2122
01:52:27,841 --> 01:52:30,780
I'll tell you that it's possible that he
was physically resurrected.

2123
01:52:30,781 --> 01:52:32,670
I mean it's,
it's even pause.

2124
01:52:32,671 --> 01:52:35,010
Wait a second.
I did with respect to quantum mechanics,

2125
01:52:35,610 --> 01:52:38,910
the point is it would take me 40 hours 
to answer the question.

2126
01:52:38,911 --> 01:52:42,360
I didn't say that he was.
How's this for an answer?

2127
01:52:42,840 --> 01:52:47,430
Almost certainly not
you.

2128
01:52:49,510 --> 01:52:50,140
What's,
what's,

2129
01:52:50,140 --> 01:52:51,490
what's wrong with that answer?

2130
01:52:54,980 --> 01:52:55,813
I think I,
I think I know what's wrong with that 

2131
01:52:57,171 --> 01:52:58,004
answer.

2132
01:53:01,390 --> 01:53:02,120
It's,
it's a,

2133
01:53:02,120 --> 01:53:02,953
it's a financer and people have been 
giving that answer for a very long 

2134
01:53:05,391 --> 01:53:06,990
period of time,
but the idea doesn't seem

2135
01:53:07,050 --> 01:53:07,883
to go away.

2136
01:53:08,650 --> 01:53:11,170
Okay,
so that evidence of what exactly.

2137
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:13,280
I don't know.
Well,

2138
01:53:13,350 --> 01:53:17,200
I can tell you one thing.
It's an evidence of deep idea.

2139
01:53:18,110 --> 01:53:20,690
Let this be the doorway to our next 
three hour conversation.

2140
01:53:20,830 --> 01:53:23,180
Are they clearly were not sure.
So sure we have.

2141
01:53:23,181 --> 01:53:24,790
We have 10 minutes left.
Okay.

2142
01:53:25,310 --> 01:53:27,290
Well then let's answer that question in 
10 minutes.

2143
01:53:27,340 --> 01:53:29,590
So wait,
I want you to trust me,

2144
01:53:29,680 --> 01:53:30,780
me,
hear you.

2145
01:53:31,110 --> 01:53:33,030
For whatever reason decided I should 
moderate,

2146
01:53:33,031 --> 01:53:35,340
so I want you to trust me.
For one thing,

2147
01:53:35,341 --> 01:53:37,370
you.
You've been doing yeoman's work am.

2148
01:53:37,420 --> 01:53:39,180
I really would like to answer that 
question,

2149
01:53:39,460 --> 01:53:40,293
but I'm trying to figure out if people 
seem to think that I'm trying to evade 

2150
01:53:44,071 --> 01:53:46,500
the question.
It's like not evading the question.

2151
01:53:46,501 --> 01:53:48,180
I'm trying to figure it out.
It's a really.

2152
01:53:48,330 --> 01:53:51,960
People have been arguing about this for 
2000 years.

2153
01:53:52,170 --> 01:53:53,003
It's like it's not.

2154
01:53:53,590 --> 01:53:54,423
That's a sin.
That's a symptom of the effect of 

2155
01:53:56,811 --> 01:53:59,480
religious dogmatism for $2,000.

2156
01:53:59,730 --> 01:54:00,563
No,
it's not.

2157
01:54:00,870 --> 01:54:02,960
Okay.
It's certainly a symptom of that.

2158
01:54:02,961 --> 01:54:05,300
It's also partly a symptom of the idea.

2159
01:54:05,390 --> 01:54:09,470
The resurrection of Jesus is clearly an 
important question,

2160
01:54:09,471 --> 01:54:13,280
but you've raised a much bigger and more
pressing question for the audience,

2161
01:54:13,281 --> 01:54:16,040
which is whether or not God cares 
whether they masturbate.

2162
01:54:16,130 --> 01:54:16,963
So

2163
01:54:18,330 --> 01:54:21,330
I actually think if we pursue that 
answer,

2164
01:54:21,420 --> 01:54:22,253
that we will actually wrap this up in a 
way that you want to end this on 

2165
01:54:25,441 --> 01:54:30,441
masturbation.
I think we owe it to them.

2166
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:34,673
So

2167
01:54:36,690 --> 01:54:38,800
give me a little leash that the floor is
yours.

2168
01:54:39,160 --> 01:54:39,993
Great.

2169
01:54:41,260 --> 01:54:43,540
How did I end up here?
All right.

2170
01:54:44,050 --> 01:54:45,880
So here's,
here's the question.

2171
01:54:46,060 --> 01:54:47,080
Let's just figure out if we

2172
01:54:47,210 --> 01:54:51,950
can determine why God might care if you 
masturbate.

2173
01:54:52,270 --> 01:54:55,130
Right?
So let's suppose that we have a story,

2174
01:54:55,220 --> 01:54:58,130
a heuristic of some kind that stands in 
for something.

2175
01:54:58,730 --> 01:55:03,730
And the story is God is watching.
He sees you always.

2176
01:55:03,860 --> 01:55:06,890
He doesn't want you masturbating.
So don't you dare.

2177
01:55:07,790 --> 01:55:08,660
What happens,

2178
01:55:12,270 --> 01:55:13,290
what happens?
Yeah.

2179
01:55:14,370 --> 01:55:19,210
Well it's uh,
it's rubbed rather ineffectual idea.

2180
01:55:20,340 --> 01:55:21,390
Yeah.
Well,

2181
01:55:21,420 --> 01:55:23,010
I mean,
I think that story,

2182
01:55:25,030 --> 01:55:25,863
but I think the reality was was that you
had people masturbating and feeling 

2183
01:55:28,981 --> 01:55:29,814
terrible about it and you had a whole 
layer of sexual neurosis that we've got 

2184
01:55:33,031 --> 01:55:35,850
grafted onto human psychology 
unnecessarily.

2185
01:55:36,180 --> 01:55:40,990
Christianity has a certain type apology 
of sexual hang up or a which,

2186
01:55:41,170 --> 01:55:42,010
which,
you know,

2187
01:55:42,120 --> 01:55:45,330
the contracts have.
So if I understand you correctly,

2188
01:55:45,331 --> 01:55:49,860
you are agreeing that a certain amount,
certain number of people will masturbate

2189
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:52,200
some of the,
some of them battling the priesthood and

2190
01:55:52,201 --> 01:55:54,540
rape little boys.
I mean that is a piece.

2191
01:55:54,541 --> 01:55:55,374
There is stick with the topic,
so a certain number of people will have 

2192
01:55:58,321 --> 01:55:59,760
masturbated.
They will have thought.

2193
01:55:59,850 --> 01:56:01,260
Honestly,
it's the same topic.

2194
01:56:01,350 --> 01:56:02,740
I mean the,
the,

2195
01:56:02,960 --> 01:56:03,793
the taboos around masturbation,
the taboos around sexuality prior to 

2196
01:56:08,941 --> 01:56:10,650
marriage,
the taboo around divorce,

2197
01:56:10,920 --> 01:56:13,560
all of the taboo,
Taboola browned out of wedlock birth.

2198
01:56:13,860 --> 01:56:14,693
The ideal of celibacy in the priesthood.
All of that is a is a just a diabolical 

2199
01:56:19,621 --> 01:56:23,660
machine of needless sexual conflict and 
misery.

2200
01:56:23,670 --> 01:56:24,503
Hold on.

2201
01:56:25,890 --> 01:56:26,723
Yes.
Okay.

2202
01:56:27,410 --> 01:56:29,820
You have to take.
How's the.

2203
01:56:29,850 --> 01:56:32,460
How's the whole flood of pornography 
thing working out?

2204
01:56:32,461 --> 01:56:33,294
Okay.
Yeah,

2205
01:56:33,830 --> 01:56:35,820
I will.
I will grant you that.

2206
01:56:35,821 --> 01:56:36,654
There is some interpretation that takes 
supernatural principles and magic and 

2207
01:56:42,481 --> 01:56:44,940
other worldliness out of the equation 
here.

2208
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,730
That gets you some wisdom in the 
heuristic.

2209
01:56:47,760 --> 01:56:49,470
Yes.
If you're masturbating all the time,

2210
01:56:49,471 --> 01:56:50,304
you're not satisfying your,
your monogamous relationship with your 

2211
01:56:52,831 --> 01:56:53,730
wife or husband.

2212
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:55,760
We wouldn't even need to go there.
Let's just.

2213
01:56:55,820 --> 01:56:56,653
You're not procreating and we agree that
a certain amount of masturbation was 

2214
01:57:00,171 --> 01:57:02,540
present,
was prevented by that story,

2215
01:57:02,541 --> 01:57:06,320
which made people fear the consequences 
of them engaging in it,

2216
01:57:06,800 --> 01:57:11,800
which would result in,
I'm pretty sure less less masturbation,

2217
01:57:11,871 --> 01:57:12,704
which means that in seeking a release 
which we are physiologically programmed 

2218
01:57:17,690 --> 01:57:18,523
to seek,
one might end up looking in a more 

2219
01:57:21,530 --> 01:57:24,320
urgent fashion for a mate.

2220
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:25,920
Right?
So it's.

2221
01:57:26,410 --> 01:57:28,770
Oh,
we going to enforce monogamy is a no.

2222
01:57:29,130 --> 01:57:29,963
So look,
I'm trying to take you somewhere I 

2223
01:57:31,371 --> 01:57:32,350
think.
I think there is

2224
01:57:32,470 --> 01:57:33,303
way that we can rescue some important 
part of what both of you were saying 

2225
01:57:36,781 --> 01:57:39,690
that can now be reconciled and then 
there's a bitter pill for each of you.

2226
01:57:40,020 --> 01:57:42,360
I mean that's just the way this looks to
me.

2227
01:57:42,570 --> 01:57:43,403
So if we can agree that this makes sense
actually as a fitness enhancing 

2228
01:57:47,550 --> 01:57:48,383
adaptation,
that this story would result in people 

2229
01:57:50,131 --> 01:57:53,070
behaving in a way that might result in 
the marrying early,

2230
01:57:53,310 --> 01:57:56,580
might result in them reproducing earlier
than they would otherwise.

2231
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:59,430
Right.
Then we can understand it as mechanistic

2232
01:57:59,431 --> 01:58:00,264
and we can understand what you said that
you know maybe God would care about 

2233
01:58:03,781 --> 01:58:04,614
whether or not people masturbate because
God is a metaphor for some set of 

2234
01:58:08,101 --> 01:58:10,440
stories that gets you to behave in an 
adaptive fashion,

2235
01:58:11,100 --> 01:58:16,100
but the point for you then would be that
Sam is arguing with reason.

2236
01:58:18,661 --> 01:58:22,740
We can decide whether or not to employ 
this story at this moment,

2237
01:58:22,741 --> 01:58:23,574
whether it's a good idea for us to 
urgently reproduce as quickly as 

2238
01:58:27,301 --> 01:58:28,620
possible,
which for example,

2239
01:58:28,621 --> 01:58:31,170
increases the size of the population of 
the planet.

2240
01:58:31,171 --> 01:58:35,340
Whereas delaying reproduction keeps the 
rate of population growth down and might

2241
01:58:35,341 --> 01:58:36,174
be a better choice for a moment in 
history when we have seven and a half 

2242
01:58:38,910 --> 01:58:42,430
billion people on the planet.
So in some sense,

2243
01:58:42,820 --> 01:58:47,560
what I think I see is the religious 
story itself make some kind of sense.

2244
01:58:47,620 --> 01:58:48,453
If you adhere to it in a manner that you
are obligated and I have no tools with 

2245
01:58:52,451 --> 01:58:55,150
which to question it,
then you will miss the fact that at this

2246
01:58:55,151 --> 01:58:56,650
moment you might want to throw that 
story.

2247
01:58:56,651 --> 01:58:58,190
Yeah.
For the problem is it doesn't make sense

2248
01:58:58,191 --> 01:59:00,520
and this is a problem with these 
heuristics in general,

2249
01:59:01,030 --> 01:59:01,863
it doesn't make sense for the right 
reason and that's why it's not a 

2250
01:59:04,931 --> 01:59:07,930
reliable guide given other changes in 
the world,

2251
01:59:07,931 --> 01:59:08,764
but with everything changing,
you want to be making sense for the 

2252
01:59:11,711 --> 01:59:14,140
right reason.
You don't want it so useful.

2253
01:59:14,141 --> 01:59:17,440
Fictions have to be retired at a certain
point.

2254
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:20,440
Useful truths stay true.
I mean if you,

2255
01:59:20,470 --> 01:59:21,303
because they're based on your engagement
with reality and so to take your point 

2256
01:59:23,441 --> 01:59:25,930
about pornography,
which I think is totally valid,

2257
01:59:26,420 --> 01:59:26,910
you,
we,

2258
01:59:26,910 --> 01:59:27,743
you could have a completely rational 
conversation in terms of human 

2259
01:59:31,511 --> 01:59:32,344
psychology and sociology and what you 
want society to look like about the 

2260
01:59:36,761 --> 01:59:39,450
corrosive nature of pornography,
right?

2261
01:59:39,460 --> 01:59:41,620
That's not.
You don't have to be a victorian,

2262
01:59:41,860 --> 01:59:42,693
a prude to worry that there might be 
something wrong with the infinite 

2263
01:59:47,890 --> 01:59:52,690
availability of pornography to 13 year 
olds and above.

2264
01:59:52,750 --> 01:59:53,200
Right?
I mean,

2265
01:59:53,200 --> 01:59:54,033
that's A.
I don't know what what's generation of 

2266
01:59:56,171 --> 01:59:58,900
human beings were raising in the current
environment.

2267
01:59:58,970 --> 02:00:01,810
It's.
It's quite worrisome actually,

2268
02:00:02,170 --> 02:00:06,760
but again,
you don't have to invoke mythology to do

2269
02:00:06,761 --> 02:00:09,790
that and I would say the temptation to 
invoke mythologist said,

2270
02:00:09,791 --> 02:00:10,470
well,
you actually

2271
02:00:10,470 --> 02:00:11,340
no,
how do you do it?

2272
02:00:11,341 --> 02:00:13,350
Poseidon really gets pissed off when you
master.

2273
02:00:13,710 --> 02:00:15,450
How do you do it?
How do you do it?

2274
02:00:15,830 --> 02:00:16,663
You don't have any effects to have no 
mechanism for controlling about the 

2275
02:00:19,801 --> 02:00:20,530
effects,

2276
02:00:20,530 --> 02:00:21,363
human relationships and your own mind 
and your own intention and the way you 

2277
02:00:23,651 --> 02:00:24,410
view others.

2278
02:00:24,410 --> 02:00:27,690
That barely works for sex ed.
It barely works for condom education.

2279
02:00:28,030 --> 02:00:28,863
Well,
what was already works like those sorts 

2280
02:00:30,301 --> 02:00:31,134
of educational interventions to stop 
that kind of fundamental behavior have 

2281
02:00:33,571 --> 02:00:38,571
very little effect when people aren't 
nearly as amenable to behavioral changes

2282
02:00:38,701 --> 02:00:42,120
as a consequence of rational educational
interventions as you might hope.

2283
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:43,231
I mean,
and that's.

2284
02:00:43,231 --> 02:00:46,410
That's part and parcel of the very broad
clinical literature.

2285
02:00:46,790 --> 02:00:47,623
They're not as.
They're not as amenable to dogmatic 

2286
02:00:50,071 --> 02:00:52,600
intrusions either.
I mean they are and living.

2287
02:00:52,660 --> 02:00:55,300
That might be a problem and neuro 
problems with no because.

2288
02:00:55,450 --> 02:00:56,010
Because

2289
02:00:56,010 --> 02:00:58,090
there again,
this is just

2290
02:01:01,150 --> 02:01:01,983
like the problem is that this,
even if you could make the case that a 

2291
02:01:09,401 --> 02:01:14,401
dogmatic at attachment to one or another
religion was better,

2292
02:01:14,530 --> 02:01:18,340
all things considered than being a 
secular,

2293
02:01:18,550 --> 02:01:21,340
truly secular and truly rational,
right?

2294
02:01:22,540 --> 02:01:23,373
It's vulnerable.
It's vulnerable to every next thing we 

2295
02:01:27,371 --> 02:01:28,210
find out.
I mean,

2296
02:01:28,211 --> 02:01:32,770
that's why it's like you could have said
if you go back 200 years before the germ

2297
02:01:32,771 --> 02:01:34,660
theory of disease,
you could have said,

2298
02:01:34,661 --> 02:01:37,080
well,
all of these dietary taboos and,

2299
02:01:37,110 --> 02:01:38,460
and taboos around,
you know,

2300
02:01:38,461 --> 02:01:42,080
hand washing and clint foot washing.
It's actually very wise.

2301
02:01:42,081 --> 02:01:46,820
The wisdom of the germ theory of disease
was sort of built into our scripture and

2302
02:01:46,821 --> 02:01:47,654
people were survived.
There's a kind of differential level of 

2303
02:01:49,071 --> 02:01:51,400
survival based on those who really 
adhere to these,

2304
02:01:51,430 --> 02:01:54,470
these practices and those who didn't.
Okay,

2305
02:01:54,471 --> 02:01:59,270
but it one,
it's blind to the actual variables.

2306
02:01:59,271 --> 02:02:02,660
Like is there's nothing special about 
shellfish necessarily or there's nothing

2307
02:02:02,661 --> 02:02:06,200
special about pork necessarily or 
whatever the example is.

2308
02:02:06,440 --> 02:02:09,380
And once you get the actual variables in
hand,

2309
02:02:09,680 --> 02:02:10,513
then the whole edifice comes crashing 
down and then you really just want to 

2310
02:02:12,921 --> 02:02:13,440
understand that.

2311
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:14,370
Right?
Does that work?

2312
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:15,480
Look,
I don't know if.

2313
02:02:15,570 --> 02:02:16,403
I don't know if the whole edifice comes 
crashing down and it isn't clear to me 

2314
02:02:19,261 --> 02:02:20,094
that you want to claim that because one 
of the things you did say in the moral 

2315
02:02:22,951 --> 02:02:25,140
landscape,
and I think this is associated with your

2316
02:02:25,141 --> 02:02:28,800
interest in spirituality,
is that there is some baby mixed in with

2317
02:02:28,801 --> 02:02:31,590
the bathwater.
And the question is how do we,

2318
02:02:31,680 --> 02:02:33,840
how do we,
how do we distill that out?

2319
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:37,830
And the objections that you're raising 
are the objections that are,

2320
02:02:37,831 --> 02:02:40,350
look how difficult it is to do the 
distillation.

2321
02:02:40,351 --> 02:02:40,951
It's like,
yeah,

2322
02:02:40,951 --> 02:02:41,784
absolutely man.
And stuff like I'm a photo of the 

2323
02:02:43,501 --> 02:02:44,334
enlightenment.
I think you enlightenment types and I 

2324
02:02:46,161 --> 02:02:46,994
put pinker in the same camp and 
radically overestimate the degree to 

2325
02:02:49,471 --> 02:02:51,440
that was.
That was a cause of sweet.

2326
02:02:51,441 --> 02:02:52,274
It's like everyone was barbaric and 
superstitious until 1750 and some 

2327
02:02:55,681 --> 02:02:58,980
miracle occurred and now we're all in 
what we all became enlightened.

2328
02:02:58,981 --> 02:02:59,814
Like there was

2329
02:02:59,940 --> 02:03:02,550
the developmental habit.
I mean with this,

2330
02:03:02,680 --> 02:03:03,513
hence,
hence to are complaining about the 

2331
02:03:05,081 --> 02:03:05,914
problem and most of the world,
most of the world hasn't had the 

2332
02:03:08,081 --> 02:03:08,980
enlightenment true

2333
02:03:09,380 --> 02:03:11,990
look.
I no folded the enlightenment,

2334
02:03:11,991 --> 02:03:12,824
but I think that it had a lengthy 
developmental history that is radically 

2335
02:03:15,741 --> 02:03:19,160
underplayed by the people who,
who grounded purely in rationality

2336
02:03:19,220 --> 02:03:20,053
is clearly still developing.
My point is we we should be able to 

2337
02:03:23,671 --> 02:03:24,504
agree that having a worldview guided by 
a continuous honest engagement with 

2338
02:03:34,171 --> 02:03:35,004
reality and so far as we can apprehend 
it is better than having a worldview 

2339
02:03:41,310 --> 02:03:42,143
solidified or anchored to unchanging 
ideas that were born of people who had 

2340
02:03:49,831 --> 02:03:50,664
none of our present tools.
None of our present insights into 

2341
02:03:53,221 --> 02:03:54,054
anything.

2342
02:03:54,320 --> 02:03:55,270
Well,
it depends on.

2343
02:03:55,330 --> 02:03:58,300
It depends on the principals.
It depends on the principals.

2344
02:03:58,301 --> 02:04:01,690
Like I would say there are situations 
where that clearly applies,

2345
02:04:01,691 --> 02:04:04,300
but I think there are broad principles 
and again,

2346
02:04:04,420 --> 02:04:07,950
we should probably stop with this.
I think you have out there because I'm,

2347
02:04:08,010 --> 02:04:09,580
I'm,
I'm starting to get tired.

2348
02:04:09,581 --> 02:04:11,650
I'm sure everyone else in here is 
starting to get tired.

2349
02:04:12,370 --> 02:04:13,203
Well,
I'm starting to get tired anyways and I 

2350
02:04:15,581 --> 02:04:17,350
mean the,
the,

2351
02:04:17,380 --> 02:04:19,520
there are,
there are principles,

2352
02:04:19,521 --> 02:04:20,354
there are higher order principles of the
sort that I described that you also 

2353
02:04:23,111 --> 02:04:25,210
appeared to rely on in the moral 
landscape,

2354
02:04:25,211 --> 02:04:26,044
the idea of these profound moral 
intuitions and so that's what I'm after 

2355
02:04:29,951 --> 02:04:30,784
is what are these profound moral 
intuitions and what is their source and 

2356
02:04:34,590 --> 02:04:38,760
like I'm also perfectly willing to make 
the claim and have in fact in,

2357
02:04:38,780 --> 02:04:42,540
in detail that these moral intuitions 
see that this is a place where we differ

2358
02:04:42,541 --> 02:04:43,020
a little bit.

2359
02:04:43,020 --> 02:04:45,870
It's like maybe we can go here tomorrow 
night.

2360
02:04:47,040 --> 02:04:50,760
See,
it seems to me that you,

2361
02:04:50,810 --> 02:04:51,643
for you,
for you and your argument is the facts 

2362
02:04:53,251 --> 02:04:54,084
are laying out there and you can extract
out value from them and we already 

2363
02:04:57,120 --> 02:04:57,953
described why you want to do that 
because you want to at least not move 

2364
02:05:01,711 --> 02:05:02,544
into the nihilistic direction and you 
want to ground them in some sort of 

2365
02:05:04,651 --> 02:05:06,750
reality.
It's like fair enough.

2366
02:05:06,840 --> 02:05:10,830
But the thing is is that the facts as 
they are,

2367
02:05:10,831 --> 02:05:12,450
have been around for a very,
very,

2368
02:05:12,451 --> 02:05:13,650
very,
very long time,

2369
02:05:13,680 --> 02:05:14,513
right?
Let's say three and a half billion 

2370
02:05:15,481 --> 02:05:17,340
years,
the entire expanse of life,

2371
02:05:17,850 --> 02:05:21,240
and it's the operation of those facts on
life that is produced,

2372
02:05:21,241 --> 02:05:22,074
the a priori implicit interpretive 
structures that guide our interaction 

2373
02:05:26,521 --> 02:05:27,354
with the facts and those a priority 
implicit structures that have emerged 

2374
02:05:30,361 --> 02:05:31,194
out of this evolutionary course,
have a structure that mediates between 

2375
02:05:34,861 --> 02:05:38,430
us and the facts that cannot be derived 
from the facts at hand.

2376
02:05:40,230 --> 02:05:41,063
So,
so then the question is what is that 

2377
02:05:42,451 --> 02:05:45,300
structure?
And it's in both of our interests to get

2378
02:05:45,301 --> 02:05:46,134
that right,
because you use that as the source of 

2379
02:05:47,731 --> 02:05:50,070
moral intuitions like right?
Agreed.

2380
02:05:50,100 --> 02:05:52,920
That's the source of moral intuition.
So and

2381
02:05:53,600 --> 02:05:54,433
Clint,
clearly what we need to table this for 

2382
02:05:55,491 --> 02:05:57,570
tomorrow night,
but that's a good guys.

2383
02:05:57,590 --> 02:05:59,270
I'm just going to interrupt you.
You guys.

2384
02:05:59,271 --> 02:06:02,690
Let's give Jordan Peterson,
Sam Harris and Bret Weinstein.

2385
02:06:02,691 --> 02:06:03,800
Have you.
Let's go.

2386
02:06:06,740 --> 02:06:11,740
Thank you.
Thanks.
