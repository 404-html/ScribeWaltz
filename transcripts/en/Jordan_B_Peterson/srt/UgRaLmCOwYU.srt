1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,010
All right.
So

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,270
I am,
I'm really kind of hoping that at least

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:13,440
30% of you will be severely unhappy with
this lecture.

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,503
So,
because,

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,730
and maybe that's wrong,
I'll find out afterwards.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,990
This is a very,
this dimension of personality.

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,860
Agreeableness is one of the dimensions
that most particularly differentiate men

8
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:34,281
and women and obviously the differences
or similarities between men and women is

9
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:44,751
a matter of hot debate in our society.
Um,

10
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:50,550
and,
and I want it run through the science

11
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,670
that's associated with that.
And then,

12
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,880
well,
I guess then we'll see what,

13
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,520
what we conclude.
Now

14
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:07,290
you remember that the big five were
derived from a statistical analysis of

15
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,790
the content of language.
Hey,

16
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,590
that's kind of interesting because it
means that in so far as any

17
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,400
psychological theory in the history of
psychology has been a theoretical with

18
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:24,360
the possible exception of intelligence
research,

19
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,840
which was also the Iq is also derived
statistically.

20
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,520
Um,
it was derived by golden or it was

21
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:36,630
initially theorized by golden in some
sense back in the late 18 hundreds.

22
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:41,631
But what Golden Thought of as Eminence
bears very little relationship to what

23
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:46,770
the psychometric,
what the psychometricians measure as

24
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:49,800
intelligence.
So intelligence is a statistical

25
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:54,540
construct or Iq is a statistical
construct and the big five traits are

26
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:59,170
statistical constructs.
And what that means is that there,

27
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,970
there are theoretical presumptions that
went into their derivation,

28
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,260
but it's very difficult to think of them
as political because the first

29
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,440
hypothesis was only that
the fundamental dimensions of

30
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:20,370
personality would be reflected in the
language English to begin with.

31
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,970
But then other languages as the research
progressed around the world,

32
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,240
it's very difficult for me to understand
that as a political theory.

33
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,060
You know,
cause if scientific findings have

34
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:35,061
political implications,
then you have to wonder if the biases of

35
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:39,870
the researchers put the political
implications into the data before

36
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:42,330
revealing them as data.
But it's very difficult to argue that.

37
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:47,010
I think with regards to trait theories,
the other thing that happened with trait

38
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:52,011
theories is that the statistical
analysis suggested their existence.

39
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,060
It wasn't until after the traits were
reasonably well identified.

40
00:02:57,061 --> 00:03:02,061
And this really started to kick in in
the 90s that we started to under stand

41
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,450
the potential biological basis and,
and even the nature,

42
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:11,470
the descriptive nature of the traits it
out the aspect level now where you

43
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:16,300
differentiate the big five into 10
there's still aspects that that we don't

44
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:17,650
know much about.
We don't know.

45
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,010
Like we don't really understand the
difference between politeness and

46
00:03:21,011 --> 00:03:23,950
compassion.
We know that liberals are more

47
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:27,160
compassionate than,
than conservatives and conservatives are

48
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:31,720
more polite than liberals and we think
that politeness is somehow associated

49
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:35,320
with the tendency of conservatives to
follow social rules.

50
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,490
But that's about,
I would say that's about all we know

51
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,010
now.
We don't even know how much difference

52
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:45,280
there will turn out to be between polite
politeness and compassion.

53
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:51,030
But were there are ongoing studies
trying to understand the covariates and

54
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:57,220
correlates of the aspects.
And the same is true of the traits.

55
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,350
Um,
there was a lot of argument about

56
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:05,950
openness when it first was discovered
statistically.

57
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:10,570
Some people like Hans Isaac who
formulated some of the early three

58
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:13,240
dimensional models of personality.
And that was extroversion,

59
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:17,200
neuroticism and psychotic racism,
which he thought would predict the

60
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:20,860
proclivity towards schizophrenia but
actually turned out to be composed of

61
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,890
low agreeableness and low
conscientiousness.

62
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,010
Isaac didn't even think that openness
was a reasonable trade.

63
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:32,011
He thought it was mostly captured by Iq.
And actually that seems to be the case

64
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:36,220
to some degree because if you divide
openness into intellect and openness to

65
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:39,460
experience,
it looks like Iq loads on intellect or

66
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:44,461
at least the nonverbal part of Iq loads
on intellect where the verbal part of Iq

67
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:47,680
tends to load more on openness and
sodas,

68
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,780
openness to experience and so does
creativity.

69
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,270
But this is all discovered after the
fact.

70
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:58,170
So now one of the things that's happened
as a consequence of parsing out

71
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:04,531
personality into the big five traits and
also using other traits schemas is that

72
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:09,820
it's quite clear that there are
differences between the sexes or if you

73
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:14,821
like differences between the genders.
Now this is a thorny problem and it's

74
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:21,100
thorny for a number of reasons.
One reason is that it's a dogmatic

75
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:26,130
assumption proposition of social
constructionists that gender differences

76
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:30,910
are socially constructed.

77
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:33,730
First of all,
they separate out the idea of sex,

78
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:36,550
which you could think of as bio
biological sex you could think of is

79
00:05:36,551 --> 00:05:40,480
chromosomal sex.
I presume that's one thing,

80
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:42,670
but gender,
that's a whole different thing and

81
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:47,350
gender is the manner in which men and
women present themselves to the world in

82
00:05:47,351 --> 00:05:49,690
terms of differences in,
well,

83
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:53,710
anything that you can measure that's
above the fundamentally biological

84
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:56,380
level.
Maybe you could say anything above the

85
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:59,450
chromosomal difference,
like I don't exactly know where the

86
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:03,350
distinction is supposed to be made
between biological sex and gender.

87
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:08,620
It's not a simple thing to understand,
but the proposition is still obtains

88
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:13,871
that if there are differences between
men and women at the level of phenotypic

89
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:18,020
manifestation,
then they're socially constructed.

90
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:23,710
The problem with that is that it seems
to be wrong and not just a little bit

91
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:24,620
wrong,
but wrong,

92
00:06:24,621 --> 00:06:28,310
right to the core,
and one of the things that I would like

93
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:33,311
to propose to you is that the social
constructionists only have theory on

94
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:37,940
their side.
I don't believe they have any data to

95
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:40,130
support their claims whatsoever.
Now,

96
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:43,190
I also think that they wouldn't accept
the sorts of things that I'm going to

97
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:47,930
talk to you about as data,
but that's a whole different argument.

98
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,573
MMM.

99
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,630
I don't really understand how it's
possible for people in an,

100
00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:00,030
in the modern world to reject scientific
claims given that almost everything they

101
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,690
do in their day to day life that has
anything to do with technology

102
00:07:03,691 --> 00:07:07,140
whatsoever,
depends for its function on the validity

103
00:07:07,141 --> 00:07:09,780
of the scientific theories that underpin
the technology.

104
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:15,470
So what that means is that people who
treat scientific data as if it's just

105
00:07:16,741 --> 00:07:19,980
another form of information,
socially constructed information,

106
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,060
certainly don't behave like that if you
follow them around in the actual world.

107
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,110
Now,
here's the proposition about

108
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,660
agreeableness.
I don't know if this is the case because

109
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:33,580
as I said,
there's lots of things we don't

110
00:07:33,581 --> 00:07:35,380
understand about the big five
dimensions,

111
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:39,700
but this is how I've worked it out for
my own understanding and it's in

112
00:07:39,701 --> 00:07:42,620
accordance with the data in so far as I
can determine that

113
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,080
agreeableness seems to be the dimension
between,

114
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,270
we certainly know,
agreeable people were empathic and

115
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:55,680
compassionate and polite.
We know less about disagreeable people,

116
00:07:55,681 --> 00:07:57,720
although we know that they're more
likely to be male.

117
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:02,580
Now you could associate being
disagreeable with being more callous and

118
00:08:02,581 --> 00:08:07,581
more harsh and more selfish in that if
you had to bargain with someone who's

119
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:10,860
low in agreeableness,
they would fight harder for their side

120
00:08:10,861 --> 00:08:14,460
of the equation than someone high in
agreeableness would fight for.

121
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:19,461
There's now,
there's a couple of things about human

122
00:08:19,651 --> 00:08:23,850
beings that that aren't considered
sufficiently.

123
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:28,770
I believe in so far as we conceptualize
human personality.

124
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:33,150
And one is that humans are unbelievably
maternal,

125
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,300
both genders.
They have to be,

126
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:40,890
because our babies are born for a mammal
of our size.

127
00:08:40,891 --> 00:08:42,900
That gestation period should be two
years,

128
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,280
nine months.
And so what that means is that babies,

129
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:49,050
human babies are already born premature.

130
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,680
And you can tell that because you know
like ungulates deer thinking gears and

131
00:08:55,611 --> 00:08:58,410
Angelette,
it doesn't matter pretty much as soon as

132
00:08:58,411 --> 00:09:01,050
they're born,
they can stagger up on their legs and

133
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:03,990
start to run around.
Whereas a human baby isn't doing that

134
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:08,280
till 15 months or 13 months or 17 months
or depending on the baby,

135
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,570
you know,
so,

136
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,500
and babies are pretty much completely
helpless at birth and so they need a

137
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:16,500
tremendous amount of care.
And then because we have such a large

138
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:20,100
cortex and because we're so behaviorally
plastic,

139
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,460
we have an extraordinarily long
dependence and development period.

140
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,320
You know,
it's a minimum,

141
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,230
it depends on the culture,
but it's a minimum of 13 years and it

142
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:31,920
can certainly extend far beyond that and
does in cultures where there's a

143
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,550
tremendous amount of inculcation of
information.

144
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:41,750
So we also know that maternal behavior
is very common among mammals.

145
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:47,040
I mean the very definition of mammal in
some sense has to do with maternal

146
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,920
behavior because mammals,
well they bear live young and they

147
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:52,200
produce milk with her warm blooded and
they,

148
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,230
there's some other characteristics.
So,

149
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,280
so the ability to care for helpless,

150
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,543
okay.

151
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,830
Frequently upset,
dependent

152
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:15,190
creatures for a very long period of time
is part of our behavioral repertoire.

153
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:18,670
Now then you might wonder are there
individual differences in the degree to

154
00:10:18,671 --> 00:10:21,730
which people are maternal?
And I think that's captured,

155
00:10:21,731 --> 00:10:26,320
at least in part with agreeableness,
it makes sense because on the positive

156
00:10:26,321 --> 00:10:28,540
pole of agreeableness,
that's where you get warmth and

157
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:33,541
compassion and empathy and the desire to
care for others and and self sacrifice.

158
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:37,660
I would say one of the things will will
show later is that agreeable.

159
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,090
This is negatively correlated with
income,

160
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,890
which is exactly what you'd expect if
you were negotiating with someone who

161
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:48,640
was self sacrificing because they're not
going to put forward their side of the

162
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,330
power equation as forcefully as someone
who is disagreeable.

163
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,190
So,
but you know,

164
00:10:54,191 --> 00:10:57,670
in order to raise a baby you have to be
self sacrificing.

165
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,140
There is no two ways about it.
You might find that rewarding and

166
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:06,010
worthwhile,
but I don't believe there is a parent

167
00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:11,011
who actually becomes a good parent who
doesn't put their child's welfare first.

168
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,090
And I think that's particularly true of
mothers,

169
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,910
particularly in the first year after
birth.

170
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,730
It's probably true right up to the age
of three,

171
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:26,140
but I think it's virtually undeniably
true for the first year.

172
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,490
The question is,
is that

173
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:34,590
reflected in personality traits?
Now,

174
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:38,390
the other thing about people that it's
worthwhile recognizing is that

175
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,680
we're hunters.
All right.

176
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:48,500
People are coniferous are pretty damn
good at bringing down big game.

177
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,950
It's reasonable to suppose that the
reason that there aren't as many large

178
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:59,010
animals in North America as there are in
Africa is because when human beings came

179
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:02,080
into North Africa,
North America,

180
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:04,300
15,000 years ago,
they killed all of them.

181
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,320
They killed all the Mammas,
they killed all the giant bears,

182
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:10,420
they killed all the cats,
they killed all the,

183
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,770
I think there were camels,
maybe can't remember precisely.

184
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:16,480
Anyways,
there was a very large array,

185
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:20,710
a very large mammals,
and they started to disappear pretty

186
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:25,711
damn quickly after the period of time
where people migrated into North

187
00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:26,591
America.
Now,

188
00:12:26,591 --> 00:12:31,591
one of the theories is that in Africa,
the animals and the people call evolved

189
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,810
so that the animals and the people had
fallen into some sort of mutual

190
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,620
stability.
But in North America,

191
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:44,190
that wasn't the case at all.
I don't,

192
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,720
I don't think it was that easy to bring
down a mammoth with a spear.

193
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:52,060
So it was very destructive of people to
do what they did.

194
00:12:52,061 --> 00:12:57,061
But it also says volumes about what
human beings are like and it's certainly

195
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:03,211
the case that a non trivial proportion
of the human population still hunts and

196
00:13:04,691 --> 00:13:07,690
they'll do that for leisure,
which is something that's very difficult

197
00:13:07,691 --> 00:13:11,200
for people who aren't countries to
understand and they're almost all men,

198
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,990
which I don't think will come as a
surprise to anyone.

199
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:20,430
So I think that predatory aggression is
on the other side of agreeableness

200
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:27,460
and we also know that the best predictor
of whether or not you're going to be in

201
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:32,461
prison is low agreeableness.
Now low conscientiousness also helps,

202
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,880
but the fundamental marker of antisocial
behavior in so far as it's captured by

203
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:40,090
the big five personality markers seems
to be low agreeableness.

204
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,810
And that you might also say given that
men are less agreeable than women,

205
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:49,740
that that's part of the reason why
men are much more likely to be in prison

206
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,700
than women.
I think it's between,

207
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,103
okay,

208
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:59,550
I think it's 91% of incarcerated
criminals are male,

209
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:03,630
but I'm certain that it's above 80% I
believe it's 91%

210
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,080
now one of the things about
personality traits that you want to keep

211
00:14:16,721 --> 00:14:19,360
in mind is that we,
they're normally distributed

212
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,580
and you need to understand some things
about the normal distribution.

213
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:30,810
If you're going to understand how
personality affects social outcomes

214
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,250
because it looks like men are only about
a half standard deviation less agreeable

215
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:39,970
than women and what that means if you
pull a given woman out of the population

216
00:14:39,971 --> 00:14:42,880
in a given man,
you can by no means say for certain

217
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:45,460
which of those two are going to be less
agreeable.

218
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:50,490
On average it's going to be the man,
but there's not a huge difference in,

219
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,960
it's still quite highly probable that
the woman will be the least agreeable of

220
00:14:56,961 --> 00:15:01,930
the two.
Now a normal distribution presupposes a

221
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,773
mean

222
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,250
and then random distribution around the
mean

223
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:13,250
and one of the things that you'll learn
in psychology is that variables are

224
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:15,740
normally distributed and that's actually
not true.

225
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,490
Some variables are normally distributed
and lots aren't.

226
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:25,040
And you need to know about the ones that
aren't because a lot,

227
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:28,730
many of them are extremely important.
Wealth is not normally distributed.

228
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,780
Creative ability is not normally
distributed any.

229
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:37,990
Anything that has to do with the human
propensity to produce is not normally

230
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:40,910
distributed.
What happens is that in in those

231
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:45,911
situations,
almost every one does nothing and a very

232
00:15:46,161 --> 00:15:49,100
tiny fraction of the people do
everything.

233
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,120
So for example,
I suspect that the median number of

234
00:15:53,121 --> 00:15:58,121
records that you people have
produced is zero.

235
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,660
So,
and that's,

236
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:07,661
that's the case for very many phenomena
that are associated with creativity.

237
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,970
There are some things that are normally
distributed in personality traits seem

238
00:16:13,971 --> 00:16:16,580
to be one of them.
The effect of personality traits on

239
00:16:16,581 --> 00:16:19,280
production might not be,
but the personality traits themselves

240
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:22,730
are.
And so you can see if you look at this

241
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,830
distribution,
this is something you really have to

242
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,070
know and understand.
If you're going to understand research

243
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:31,010
and psychology,
this is like a basic axiom of all the

244
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:34,070
statistics.
The first axiom is that the phenomena

245
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:35,810
that you're measuring are normally
distributed.

246
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:38,060
Generally when you do a statistical
analysis,

247
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,530
you have to test to see if that's true.
And most statistics can handle a fair

248
00:16:42,531 --> 00:16:46,130
bit of deviation from normality without
being rendered invalid.

249
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,970
But the list of variables that I just
described to you,

250
00:16:49,971 --> 00:16:53,120
say those that are associated with
creative production do not fall into

251
00:16:53,121 --> 00:16:55,630
that category.
They have very long tails there.

252
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,430
They're distributed according to
something called the prieto

253
00:16:58,431 --> 00:17:00,920
distribution,
which we'll talk about more when we get

254
00:17:00,921 --> 00:17:05,921
to conscientiousness and trade openness.
Now you'll see there's a middle line

255
00:17:06,321 --> 00:17:10,280
there and that's the mean and the median
and the mode in a real normal

256
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:14,060
distribution.
And then the curve is divided up into

257
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:19,061
equal sections,
roughly four of them on each side of the

258
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,480
distribution.
So eight in total that represent a way

259
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:28,481
of representing the normal distribution.
And so by the time you get out to three

260
00:17:29,871 --> 00:17:34,871
standard deviations above the mean,
you're talking about 0.1% of the

261
00:17:35,061 --> 00:17:37,400
population.
So,

262
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,560
and the same thing is true on the other
end.

263
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,450
Three standard deviations below the
mean.

264
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,770
So basically the entire population is
encompassed within eight standard

265
00:17:47,771 --> 00:17:50,130
deviations.
Now it's not quite because the tails

266
00:17:50,131 --> 00:17:52,200
keep going.
There's just fewer.

267
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,520
There's so few people out there at one
point that you know they vanish into

268
00:17:56,521 --> 00:17:58,560
almost,
they almost vanish.

269
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:02,310
That doesn't mean they're not,
their existence is not necessarily

270
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:03,690
important.
You know,

271
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:08,700
one guy who's six standard deviations
below the mean in agreeableness might be

272
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:11,280
the serial killer who killed,
kills a hundred people.

273
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:15,660
So those exceptions can still have
extraordinarily powerful impacts.

274
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,670
They're just not statistically very
common.

275
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,590
Now the normal distribution for man and
women overlaps quite a lot for most

276
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:27,030
single personality traits.
So women are half a standard deviation,

277
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:31,260
more agreeable than man.
So you can imagine two curves that

278
00:18:31,261 --> 00:18:36,261
overlap with the female distribution
being shunted slightly to the right.

279
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,140
And so what that means,
as I said,

280
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:43,320
if you take out a random woman or a
random man from the distribution,

281
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:47,190
it's somewhat of a toss up who's going
to be more or less agreeable.

282
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:52,970
However,
if the situation is such that only the

283
00:18:53,911 --> 00:18:58,890
person who's one in a hundred least
agreeable ends up in prison,

284
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,100
all of the people who end up in prison
are going to be men.

285
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:07,430
Because the consequence of shifting the
curves slightly to the right is that

286
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:10,830
when you move out to the left hand side
of the distribution,

287
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,040
outstay three standard deviations in the
entire population,

288
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:16,910
all of the people out there are going to
be man.

289
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,340
So what that means is that small
differences in the mean,

290
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,910
even if the distribution is,
is the same shape,

291
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:27,060
small deviations from the mean can
produce huge,

292
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:32,240
huge social effects at the periphery.
So you know,

293
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:37,320
here's an example,
there aren't that many people who are

294
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:40,440
five standard deviations above the mean
and intelligence.

295
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:45,480
But among them are a tremendous number
of Nobel prize laureates.

296
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,440
So because you can understand with
intelligence,

297
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:53,230
it isn't exactly how smart you are that
matters.

298
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,200
It's how smart you are compared to other
people.

299
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,180
Cause if you're smarter than other
people,

300
00:19:58,181 --> 00:20:01,270
you're going to get to where everyone's
going faster.

301
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:06,130
And it's the fastest person who it's the
person who's fastest at that,

302
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:10,600
who's going to get there first.
So comparative ability really,

303
00:20:10,601 --> 00:20:14,970
really matters when you're looking at
exceptional levels of ability of,

304
00:20:14,971 --> 00:20:18,580
of productive output.
It's a rough law.

305
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,790
So here,
here's a rule.

306
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,800
This is called price's law.
The square root of the number of people

307
00:20:26,801 --> 00:20:31,801
in a domain do half the work is that
means if there's 10,000 neuroscientists,

308
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:37,360
10,000 publishing neuroscientists,
a hundred of them have half the

309
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:42,361
publications
and most of them have zero or one.

310
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,190
So the rule for publications is among

311
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,510
Phd students is

312
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:55,960
the median number of publications that
Phd students have is somewhere between

313
00:20:55,961 --> 00:21:00,961
zero and one half is many have to half
as many of that has three,

314
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:05,410
half as many as that have four.
So it's a tremendous step down in

315
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:10,411
productivity as it's an exponential
stepped down in probability with a

316
00:21:10,481 --> 00:21:14,350
linear step up in productivity.
It's a very,

317
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:16,360
very frightening fact.
Now,

318
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:21,390
it accounts for why 1% of the population
has a huge chunk of the money.

319
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,330
But you know,
if you take that 1% and you divide them

320
00:21:25,331 --> 00:21:30,331
into 99% and 1% the top 1% of the 1% has
almost all the money that the top 1%

321
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:36,070
house.
And then if you take the top 1% of 1%

322
00:21:36,071 --> 00:21:41,071
and you divide them into 99% and 1% the
top 1% of that tiny slice has almost all

323
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:48,061
of the money that that tiny slice house.
So it's also scalable and it's a problem

324
00:21:49,661 --> 00:21:53,800
because it means that productivity is,
is,

325
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,930
is always in the hands of a few and no
one knows what to do about that.

326
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:02,410
Or even if there's anything that can be
done about it or even if there's

327
00:22:02,411 --> 00:22:06,970
anything that should be done about it.
So I know you might think of it as

328
00:22:06,971 --> 00:22:09,460
unfair.
Well it's certainly on fair in terms of

329
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:13,870
egalitarian distribution of,
of productivity.

330
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,930
But what are you going to do about that?
Exactly.

331
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:21,970
It doesn't seem like stopping the people
who were hyper productive from being

332
00:22:21,971 --> 00:22:25,810
hyper productive constitutes a useful
solution to that problem.

333
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,830
So,
and even if you allow huge populations

334
00:22:29,831 --> 00:22:34,831
of people access to higher education,
that might boost the overall levels of

335
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:37,660
productivity,
but it doesn't change the distribution

336
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:40,750
partly because it just makes everything
more competitive.

337
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:41,584
Right?

338
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,533
So

339
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,840
here's the definition of gender that
basically it's basically the 1960s to 19

340
00:22:55,430 --> 00:23:00,430
well to 2010 feminists.
Description of gender is socially

341
00:23:02,271 --> 00:23:05,990
constructed system of classification
that ascribes qualities of masculinity

342
00:23:05,991 --> 00:23:09,740
and femininity to people.
Gender characteristics can change over

343
00:23:09,741 --> 00:23:14,741
time and are different between cultures.
Well,

344
00:23:15,171 --> 00:23:18,470
there's a variety of claims in that.
One is that it's socially constructed

345
00:23:18,471 --> 00:23:22,160
and the second is that it can change
over second and third that it changes

346
00:23:22,161 --> 00:23:24,050
over time and are different between
cultures.

347
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,730
Yeah,
of course.

348
00:23:26,731 --> 00:23:31,710
It depends on what you mean by different
and that's the key issue on what

349
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:34,770
measure,
which is something you can't

350
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:39,310
not ask when you make a statement like
that,

351
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,890
but that's the basic proposition.
I think the truth of the matter actually

352
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:49,891
is is that
you can make,

353
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,670
make a one to one mapping of personality
on to gender,

354
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,370
but that doesn't mean that personality
is socially constructed.

355
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,000
There isn't a lot of evidence that it
is,

356
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:15,120
it's certainly not socially constructed
in such a way that it would allow the

357
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,980
emergence of more than five dimensions.

358
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:23,890
It might be socially constructed,
at least to the degree that some one

359
00:24:23,891 --> 00:24:28,690
society can push people regardless of
their gender or even regardless of their

360
00:24:28,691 --> 00:24:31,570
personality,
farther up the distribution or farther

361
00:24:31,571 --> 00:24:33,340
down the distribution.
Then another culture,

362
00:24:33,341 --> 00:24:35,200
Mike.
So we know for example,

363
00:24:35,201 --> 00:24:37,520
that
it takes us,

364
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:42,900
if you take kids who are adopted out
twins and you want to produce a 15 point

365
00:24:43,751 --> 00:24:48,130
difference in their Iq by the time
they're 18 you have to have a minimum of

366
00:24:48,131 --> 00:24:52,240
three standard deviations difference in
wealth between the families that they

367
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:56,350
lambed in.
So that's what a one standard deviation

368
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,740
increase intelligence costs.
And that's a lot.

369
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And it isn't even obvious that that gain
sustains itself across the entire

370
00:25:06,551 --> 00:25:11,380
lifespan because one of the things that
happens is that as identical twins who

371
00:25:11,381 --> 00:25:14,860
were separated at birth and raised in
different families age,

372
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:20,580
their Iq is become more like each other
until by the time they're about 60 their

373
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:24,850
iqs are so similar that it's as if
you're testing the same person twice.

374
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,690
And that's weird day because what you
would think you would definitely think

375
00:25:28,691 --> 00:25:32,290
that well as once you separate the
twins,

376
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:36,040
the longer they stay apart,
the more different they're going to be.

377
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:38,020
Right?
Because you would assume that their

378
00:25:38,021 --> 00:25:41,020
environments stay different and the
differences are going to accumulate

379
00:25:41,021 --> 00:25:43,480
across time and that they're going to
divert.

380
00:25:43,481 --> 00:25:45,130
But that isn't what happens at all.

381
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,610
Okay.
So let's look at some,

382
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,940
some interesting things here.
So here's one study.

383
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,360
There's a,
one of the things you might ask yourself

384
00:25:58,361 --> 00:26:03,361
is
why do boys like to play with trucks and

385
00:26:04,471 --> 00:26:08,130
girls like to play with like stuffed
animals and dolls,

386
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,220
roughly speaking.
And one answer is,

387
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:16,290
well that's socially constructed
parents,

388
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,320
whether they want to or not
differentially reinforce toy preferences

389
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:26,910
subtly and directly.
And as a consequence that the cumulative

390
00:26:26,911 --> 00:26:30,600
effect of that determines what toys the
children are going to play with.

391
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,590
Um,
it's not obvious from the literature

392
00:26:34,591 --> 00:26:37,380
that that's the case,
but

393
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:41,400
that's not a theory that can explain
this.

394
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:45,450
So what the researchers was take a whole
variety of toys and have a number of

395
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:50,190
people classify them as either feminine,
stereotyped or masculine stereotype.

396
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:55,410
And then they give them to a number of
children to see which toys,

397
00:26:55,411 --> 00:27:00,411
which gendered children played with.
And they found that the male children

398
00:27:01,081 --> 00:27:05,430
tended to play with the stereotypically
masculine toys given free choice and the

399
00:27:05,431 --> 00:27:10,380
female children tended to play with the
female stereotype toys given choice.

400
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,720
Well,
that doesn't have anything to do at all

401
00:27:12,721 --> 00:27:17,580
with the socialization hypothesis,
except they did the same thing with

402
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:23,100
rhesus monkeys.
We compare the interactions of 34 rhesus

403
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:27,900
monkeys living within 135 monkey troop
with human wheeled toys and plush toys.

404
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:33,000
Male monkeys like boys showed consistent
and strong preferences for wheeled toys.

405
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:37,170
While female monkeys like girls show
greater variability at preferences.

406
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,450
That's the magnitude of preference for
wheeled over plush toys different

407
00:27:42,451 --> 00:27:46,620
significantly between males and females.
The similarities to human findings.

408
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,480
The top graph,
by the way,

409
00:27:48,481 --> 00:27:52,890
is human subjects.
In the bottom graph is monkey subjects.

410
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,060
On the left you see males.
Um,

411
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:02,780
the black bar is masculine toys and on
the right you see females where the

412
00:28:02,941 --> 00:28:04,860
black bars,
masculine toys.

413
00:28:04,861 --> 00:28:06,540
Now,
what you see is the females are more

414
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:09,150
likely to play with masculine and
feminine toys,

415
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,430
although they slightly prefer feminine
toys,

416
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:15,150
whereas the males overwhelmingly prefer
masculine toys.

417
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,600
The similarities to human findings
demonstrate that says preferences can

418
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:24,030
develop without explicit gendered
socialization.

419
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,660
We offer the hypothesis that toy
preferences reflect hormonally

420
00:28:27,661 --> 00:28:29,940
influenced behavioral and cognitive
biases,

421
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,110
which are sculpted by social processes
into the sex differences seen in monkeys

422
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,273
and humans.

423
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:36,760
Okay.

424
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,610
Janice M Hassett was the lead author on
that

425
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,903
paper.

426
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,240
That's kind of a rough one.
It's a,

427
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:48,550
it's not obvious at all why male rhesus
monkeys would want to play with wheel

428
00:28:48,551 --> 00:28:49,420
toys.
I mean,

429
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:50,500
what the hell?
Right?

430
00:28:50,501 --> 00:28:51,840
I mean,
it's not like rhesus monkeys.

431
00:28:51,841 --> 00:28:54,070
They're driving around in trucks,
you know?

432
00:28:54,071 --> 00:28:58,540
So it's not exactly clear why these
differences exist when you're thinking

433
00:28:58,541 --> 00:29:01,180
about how they're responding to plush
toys,

434
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:04,150
you know,
those are basically pseudo infants.

435
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:07,240
So that's kind of an easier thing to,
to understand,

436
00:29:07,241 --> 00:29:11,290
especially because we know that the,
the hallmarks of cuteness,

437
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:14,200
which,
which is the stimuli that are necessary

438
00:29:14,201 --> 00:29:17,200
to evoke a,
basically a maternal response,

439
00:29:17,201 --> 00:29:20,530
the hallmarks of cuteness are pretty
much stable across mammals,

440
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:23,920
which is why people think kittens are
cute and you know,

441
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,830
and uh,
well any little baby thing is cute and

442
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:30,010
the reason for that is big i's and
little nose and it sort of moves

443
00:29:30,011 --> 00:29:30,580
helplessly.

444
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:35,020
It has short limbs and all of that sort
of adds up to cute and cute is a very

445
00:29:35,021 --> 00:29:40,021
powerful set of triggering stimuli.
So if it wasn't obviously children who

446
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:46,030
were playing with little like plush
bears wouldn't baby them,

447
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:48,340
you know,
because obviously a plus there is not a

448
00:29:48,341 --> 00:29:50,470
baby,
but it's similar enough to a baby

449
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:55,570
schematically that it evokes
automatically evokes those sorts of

450
00:29:55,571 --> 00:29:56,450
responses.
You know,

451
00:29:56,451 --> 00:29:57,490
when,
um,

452
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:01,450
when my,
my daughter used to have this stuff toy

453
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:05,140
and it was a cat and I used to play with
that cat.

454
00:30:05,141 --> 00:30:08,320
And one thing I used to do with it is
you could actually push its head inside.

455
00:30:08,321 --> 00:30:13,240
It's little plus body know that she did
not find that the least bit of music.

456
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,750
So that's a difference in masculine and
feminine play patterns there too.

457
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:20,590
So,
you know,

458
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,080
she knew perfectly well that this thing
couldn't be hurt.

459
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,300
That wasn't the issue.
You know,

460
00:30:25,301 --> 00:30:26,200
the,
the,

461
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:30,580
the behavioral responses that it evoked,
we're part of a sect,

462
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,040
you know,
and it was perfectly healthy of her to

463
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:36,700
be responding as if this thing was
deserving of caring,

464
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:39,700
compassionate.
She was practicing doing that is a very

465
00:30:39,701 --> 00:30:42,310
important thing to do.
It needs practice.

466
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,473
Okay.

467
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,970
Um,
I'll read this to you now.

468
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:53,160
I think some of the best research done
on why gender differences exist outside

469
00:30:53,161 --> 00:30:55,790
of socialization has been done by,
um,

470
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,150
Simon Baron Cohen.
Simon Bar Cohen.

471
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:02,580
Okay.

472
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:06,510
He's a borats brother by the way.
Just so you know,

473
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:12,470
what he showed is that you might think
that the classical human body type is

474
00:31:14,401 --> 00:31:17,100
female.
So in some sense,

475
00:31:17,101 --> 00:31:22,101
every creature human creature starts out
with a prototypically female body

476
00:31:23,671 --> 00:31:26,580
structure by,
and even though there's chromosomal

477
00:31:26,581 --> 00:31:30,590
differences between the two sexes,
and what happens is that masculinization

478
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,990
occurs as a consequence of fetal
testosterone.

479
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:40,230
And there's a lot of variation in fetal
testosterone from male fetus to male

480
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:45,231
female fetus and some of Cohen's work
has demonstrated quite clearly that

481
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:50,790
field testosterone,
fetal testosterone levels are very much

482
00:31:50,791 --> 00:31:55,020
associated with post birth masculine
behaviors.

483
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:57,690
And one of the things he's found out,
for example,

484
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:03,110
he believes that autism is hyper
masculinity because he's found that

485
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:09,810
the feeder old boys who are hyper
masculinized are much more likely to

486
00:32:09,811 --> 00:32:12,210
become autistic.
And one of the things that's interesting

487
00:32:12,211 --> 00:32:14,850
about autistic kids,
there are autistic females as well,

488
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:16,500
by the way,
but most of them are male,

489
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,920
is that the most fundamental lack they
seem to have is the lack of ability to,

490
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,930
to engage in any sort of social contact
whatsoever.

491
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,070
So they don't make eye contact and boys,
by the way,

492
00:32:29,071 --> 00:32:31,290
boy,
babies make less eye contact and girl

493
00:32:31,291 --> 00:32:33,390
babies,
the autistic kids,

494
00:32:33,391 --> 00:32:35,880
they don't make hardly any I call to
contact at all.

495
00:32:35,881 --> 00:32:38,580
And they have a very difficult time
establishing any kind of social

496
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:42,980
relationship.
Now this study is kind of interesting.

497
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,140
So it was published in,

498
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:51,860
I think it was 2012 let me,
let me read it to you.

499
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,400
Previous research has shown that
prenatal exposure to endocrine

500
00:32:55,401 --> 00:32:59,420
disrupting chemicals can alter
children's neurodevelopment including

501
00:32:59,421 --> 00:33:04,010
sex typed behavior and that it can do so
in different ways in males and females.

502
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:09,190
Non Chemical exposure including
psychosocial stress may disrupt the

503
00:33:09,261 --> 00:33:14,261
prenatal hormonal meal you as well.
To date only one published study has

504
00:33:14,991 --> 00:33:19,250
perspectively that means over time
examined the relationship between

505
00:33:19,251 --> 00:33:23,870
exposure to prenatal stress and gender
specific play behavior during childhood.

506
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:29,230
Finding masculinized play behavior in
girls who experienced high prenatal life

507
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:33,470
events,
stress but no associations in boys.

508
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,410
Here we examine this question in a
second.

509
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:39,350
Prospect of cohort from the study for
future families.

510
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:42,500
Pregnant women completed questionnaires
on stressful events,

511
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:46,040
life events during pregnancy,
and those who reported one or more

512
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:50,570
events were considered stressed.
Families were recontact,

513
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:55,220
contacted several years later.
The mean age of their children was five

514
00:33:55,221 --> 00:33:59,180
years and mother's completed the
questionnaire including the validated

515
00:33:59,181 --> 00:34:03,410
preschool activities inventory which
measures sexually dimorphic play

516
00:34:03,411 --> 00:34:08,411
behavior in sex stratified analysis
after adjusting for child's age,

517
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,470
parental attitudes towards gender
atypical play,

518
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:17,600
age and sex of siblings and other
relevant covariates girls exposed to

519
00:34:17,601 --> 00:34:18,740
prenatal life events.

520
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:23,690
Stress had higher scores on the p s ai
masculine subscale.

521
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:24,550
Okay.

522
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:28,990
And showed a trend towards higher or
more masculine composite scores.

523
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:34,030
By contrast in males there was a trend
towards an association between prenatal

524
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:39,031
stress and Higher Psi Feminine subscale
scores but no association with masculine

525
00:34:40,301 --> 00:34:43,270
or composite scores.
These data confirmed previous findings

526
00:34:43,271 --> 00:34:47,500
of human and animal models suggesting
that prenatal stress is a non chemical

527
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:52,501
endocrine disruptor that may have
androgenic effects on female fetuses and

528
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:56,320
anti androgenic effects on male feed
fetuses,

529
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,560
androgenic being male hormone effected.
This is Simon Baron Cohen direct study.

530
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,640
Um,
one of the tests hypothetically that you

531
00:35:11,641 --> 00:35:15,330
can use to assess empathy,
although it turns out to be rather

532
00:35:15,331 --> 00:35:18,390
difficult to do that reliably,
is to use what's called the mind in the

533
00:35:18,391 --> 00:35:20,940
eyes test.
And basically with that test,

534
00:35:20,941 --> 00:35:25,941
what you do is you show subjects,
just a slice of a photograph of eyes.

535
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:32,040
The person in the photograph had been
manifesting some display of emotion and

536
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,920
some emotional displays are associated
with change.

537
00:35:34,921 --> 00:35:35,970
And I,
so for example,

538
00:35:35,971 --> 00:35:39,810
a Duchenne smile,
which is a true smile also involves

539
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:44,870
lifting of the eyes at the edge.
It's whereas just a like a fake social

540
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:50,181
smile is just the mouth.
So you can read a smile from the eyes.

541
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:53,370
Now you can't read that as well as you
could if you had the whole face.

542
00:35:53,371 --> 00:35:55,560
You can read anger from the eyes because
the eyebrows,

543
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,880
you know,
it includes the eyebrows,

544
00:35:56,881 --> 00:35:59,420
eyebrows go down and you can read
surprise and,

545
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:02,340
but it's kind of a tenuated because you
don't have the whole face.

546
00:36:02,341 --> 00:36:06,030
And so hypothetically,
people who are more attuned to social

547
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:09,060
cues can do a better job of reading the
mind in eyes.

548
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:16,360
So these researchers looked at children
for whom fetal testosterone data was

549
00:36:16,611 --> 00:36:20,540
available and then determined at how old
were they?

550
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:25,700
I don't remember.
It doesn't matter.

551
00:36:25,701 --> 00:36:29,540
They have data on fetal testosterone
from obviously from before birth.

552
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:31,940
And then at some point in their child
development,

553
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:35,690
they were given this test.
Empathy involves an understanding of

554
00:36:35,691 --> 00:36:40,130
what others are thinking and feeling and
enables us to interact and the social

555
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:43,790
world
according to the empathizing,

556
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,970
systematizing theory.
Now here's the theory.

557
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:50,960
The theory is that women are tilted
towards empathizing and males are tilted

558
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:54,590
towards systematizing.
And that that seems to fall into

559
00:36:54,591 --> 00:36:59,591
alignment with other observations
suggesting that the biggest gender

560
00:37:00,321 --> 00:37:04,160
difference between adult humans is

561
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,093
mmm.

562
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:10,280
Interest preference.
Women are much more likely to express

563
00:37:10,281 --> 00:37:13,400
interest in occupations that involve a
lot of social contact,

564
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:16,280
whereas men are more likely to,
um,

565
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,380
manifest interest in occupations that
have to do with things.

566
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:24,860
And so one example of that,
you see this in the Scandinavian

567
00:37:24,861 --> 00:37:27,350
countries,
despite the fact that they've really

568
00:37:27,351 --> 00:37:31,400
done everything possible to flatten out
the environmental differences between,

569
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,680
um,
opportunities for,

570
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,190
for boys and for girls,
is that in the Scandinavian countries,

571
00:37:37,191 --> 00:37:41,060
the ratio of male nurses to female
nurses is one to 20.

572
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:46,640
And of male of female engineers to male
engineers is one to 20.

573
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:50,240
And the government's now,
and then do a big push to try to get

574
00:37:50,241 --> 00:37:51,290
more men into

575
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,753
mmm.

576
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:55,720
Into nursing and more women into
engineering.

577
00:37:55,721 --> 00:38:00,721
And with a lot of push and a lot of
advertising and marketing and so forth,

578
00:38:01,021 --> 00:38:05,550
they can shift the,
the proportions to some minor degree.

579
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:09,300
But as soon as they stop pushing hard,
they just snapped back to one in 20.

580
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,690
And it's really interesting if you think
about it,

581
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:17,691
that the biggest gender differences that
are reported in the world are reported

582
00:38:17,851 --> 00:38:21,330
between men and women and Scandinavian
societies because those are the most

583
00:38:21,331 --> 00:38:25,410
gender equal societies in the world.
And so one of the perverse things that

584
00:38:25,411 --> 00:38:29,490
has happened is that you can imagine
that there's some reason that men and

585
00:38:29,491 --> 00:38:31,560
women are different is because of
environmental,

586
00:38:31,561 --> 00:38:33,000
very variability,
right?

587
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,980
The environment for the women and the
environment for the man is different.

588
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,010
And then some proportion is due to
genetic variability.

589
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:44,410
And so then one idea which is false is
that if you were radic hated the

590
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:47,740
environmental variability,
the gender differences would disappear.

591
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,220
That would only be the case if all the
gender differences were due to

592
00:38:51,221 --> 00:38:55,180
environmental variability.
What happens instead is that when you

593
00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:00,010
eliminate the environmental variability,
you maximize the genetic variability and

594
00:39:00,011 --> 00:39:01,990
the reason you do that is because that's
all that's left,

595
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,360
right?
You've eradicated the other source of

596
00:39:04,361 --> 00:39:06,340
variability,
so the only thing left is genetic

597
00:39:06,341 --> 00:39:10,390
variability and the consequence of that
is being is that men and women differ

598
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:13,750
more in Scandinavia than they do in any
other place on the planet.

599
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:19,660
Now that to me that seems like the death
knoll of social construction theories

600
00:39:19,661 --> 00:39:24,661
because it's exactly the opposite of
what would have been predicted precisely

601
00:39:24,671 --> 00:39:26,110
the opposite.
You know,

602
00:39:26,111 --> 00:39:29,500
and maybe it would've been a good thing
if flattening out the opportunity

603
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:33,100
landscape would have eradicated gender
differences in personality and

604
00:39:33,101 --> 00:39:36,220
preference and so forth,
but it isn't self evident that that's a

605
00:39:36,221 --> 00:39:40,270
good thing because you could also say
that I need galatarian.

606
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:45,360
Society optimally constructed is one in
which the differences between people are

607
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:51,541
allowed to manifest themselves so that
each person is able to find a place in a

608
00:39:51,701 --> 00:39:54,310
niche and the society that actually fits
their temperament.

609
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:59,030
Empathy involves and understanding of
what others are thinking and feeling and

610
00:39:59,031 --> 00:40:02,780
enables us to interact in the social
world according to the empathizing

611
00:40:02,781 --> 00:40:06,260
systemizing theory.
Now part of this systemizing theory as

612
00:40:06,261 --> 00:40:10,100
well is that one of the thing about
autistic people,

613
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:11,070
okay

614
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:13,500
is that they systematized like mad,
you know,

615
00:40:13,501 --> 00:40:17,670
so to the degree that their cognitive
abilities are intact,

616
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,880
which is extraordinarily variable,
it's more often the case that if an

617
00:40:24,961 --> 00:40:27,750
autistic child focus on focuses on
something,

618
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:32,870
they do it obsessively and what they do
is classify and systematize to a degree

619
00:40:32,911 --> 00:40:36,010
that looks you need dimensional and and

620
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,053
well

621
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,700
you need dimensional and fundamentally
focused

622
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:48,000
according to the empathizing systemizing
theory,

623
00:40:48,001 --> 00:40:51,030
females on average have a stronger drive
to empathize that males,

624
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:54,600
this sex difference May in part reflect
developmental differences in brain

625
00:40:54,601 --> 00:40:58,080
structure and function,
which are themselves under the influence

626
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:01,230
of fetal testosterone.
Previous studies and found that fetal

627
00:41:01,231 --> 00:41:06,231
testosterone is inversely backwards
correlated with social behaviors such as

628
00:41:07,831 --> 00:41:12,300
eye contact and infancy,
peer relationships and preschoolers and

629
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:14,970
mentalistic interpretation of animate
motion.

630
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,490
Male fetuses are exposed to higher
levels of testosterone.

631
00:41:22,491 --> 00:41:26,270
Then our female fetuses.
The present study investigates

632
00:41:26,271 --> 00:41:30,410
empathizing and children as a function
of amniotic measures of fetal

633
00:41:30,411 --> 00:41:33,320
testosterone.
193 mothers of children,

634
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:37,040
100 males 93 see males age six to eight
years of age,

635
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,040
completed children's versions of the
empathy quotient,

636
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:43,910
which is a questionnaire I believe and
children themselves.

637
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,460
We're tested on reading the mind in the
eyes task.

638
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:52,770
All mothers had had amniocentesis during
the second trimester of pregnancy.

639
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,790
There was a significant negative
correlation between fetal testosterone

640
00:41:56,791 --> 00:41:59,220
and scores on both measures.
Well,

641
00:41:59,221 --> 00:42:01,980
empathy may be influenced by postnatal
experience.

642
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,960
The results suggest that prenatal
biology also plays an important role

643
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:09,330
mediated by androgen effects in the
brain.

644
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:13,530
These results also have implication for
the causes of disability involving

645
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:18,000
empathy such as autism spectrum
conditions and may explain the increased

646
00:42:18,001 --> 00:42:20,640
rate of such conditions among males.

647
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:30,500
Here's some differentiators between
compassion and politeness.

648
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,780
Compassionate people feel others'
emotions.

649
00:42:32,781 --> 00:42:37,070
Inquire about others' wellbeing and
sympathize with other feelings,

650
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,990
others' feelings,
polite people.

651
00:42:38,991 --> 00:42:42,680
Respect authority,
hate to seem pushy and avoid imposing

652
00:42:42,681 --> 00:42:44,000
their will on others.

653
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,403
Okay,

654
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:48,760
so there's the,

655
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:50,250
okay.

656
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:52,350
The non overlapping distributions that
I,

657
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:53,180
okay.

658
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,020
Talk to you about

659
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,200
the probability that a randomly drawn
woman will be more agreeable than a

660
00:43:00,201 --> 00:43:05,201
randomly drawn men is 63% so six if you
do random pairs 10 times,

661
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,700
six times,
the woman will be more agreeable than

662
00:43:10,701 --> 00:43:12,840
the man that you chose.
So you see that it's not,

663
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:15,620
in some sense it's not a tremendous
difference.

664
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:18,950
You know it deviates from 50 50
obviously,

665
00:43:18,951 --> 00:43:22,910
but it still leaves a lot of room for
the claim that men and women are

666
00:43:22,911 --> 00:43:25,100
basically more similar than they are
different.

667
00:43:25,101 --> 00:43:27,830
But then again,
it depends on where in the distribution

668
00:43:27,831 --> 00:43:29,870
that you're looking because of the,

669
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:32,250
okay,

670
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:35,020
the increasing effects of a difference
in distribution.

671
00:43:35,021 --> 00:43:38,040
Now as you move farther and farther out
to the edges of the population,

672
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:47,870
women are more extroverted than man by
0.15 of a standard deviation in

673
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:52,200
particular.
They're more enthusiastic after the

674
00:43:52,201 --> 00:43:55,740
aspect level and enthusiastic and people
seem to manifest a lot of positive

675
00:43:55,741 --> 00:43:58,560
emotion.
So it's quite interesting because one of

676
00:43:58,561 --> 00:44:01,770
the things that that seems to imply is
that we know that women are also more

677
00:44:01,771 --> 00:44:05,340
sensitive to negative emotion.
So women actually seem to have a broader

678
00:44:05,341 --> 00:44:09,600
range of emotional expression than men.
They're more prone to positive emotion

679
00:44:09,601 --> 00:44:11,370
and they're more prone to negative
emotion.

680
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:23,460
You UN index is of a gender equality and
economic development are associated with

681
00:44:23,461 --> 00:44:27,180
larger differences in agreeableness but
not an extroversion or neuroticism.

682
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:31,590
So basically if you rank countries by
how

683
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:33,490
yeah,

684
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:38,380
favorably they look upon equal rights
and how much they've been able to put

685
00:44:38,381 --> 00:44:42,700
that in practice.
The countries that rank higher in rights

686
00:44:42,701 --> 00:44:46,990
for women produce women and men who are
more variable on agreeableness rather

687
00:44:46,991 --> 00:44:49,390
than less.
But you don't see the effect of with

688
00:44:49,391 --> 00:44:52,270
extroversion and neuroticism.
So

689
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:58,750
occupational preference,
it's the people things,

690
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:03,130
dimension men prefer working with things
and women with people.

691
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,770
And the difference is almost a full
standard deviation

692
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:13,060
and the end is 500,000 so you know when
you're starting to get up the numbers

693
00:45:13,521 --> 00:45:17,480
like that in the study,
it becomes increasingly more reasonable

694
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:20,150
to consider it representative of the
actual population.

695
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:26,290
Holand John Holland has produced a
typology of jobs which he acronine turns

696
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:31,100
into an acronym,
which is reassess,

697
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,650
realistic,
imaginative,

698
00:45:33,651 --> 00:45:35,270
artistic,
social,

699
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,690
entrepreneurial,
I believe.

700
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:42,020
And Conventional,
I'm not sure about the entrepreneurial

701
00:45:42,021 --> 00:45:45,710
one man show stronger,
realistic and investigative interests

702
00:45:45,711 --> 00:45:49,640
and women's show stronger artistic,
social and conventional interests.

703
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:51,080
Yeah,
and there's no differences in

704
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,720
enterprising.
It's not entrepreneurial ability.

705
00:45:53,721 --> 00:45:56,390
It's enterprising.
This is fundamentally the same thing.

706
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:04,130
So how does that express itself and in
social terms,

707
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,910
while there are more men as well known
in science,

708
00:46:07,911 --> 00:46:10,790
technology,
engineering and mathematics,

709
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,420
now God only knows if that'll be the
case in 20 years.

710
00:46:14,421 --> 00:46:17,960
Because one of the things that's
happening to our society very rapidly is

711
00:46:17,961 --> 00:46:21,710
that men are bailing out of higher
education institutions at a rate that's

712
00:46:21,711 --> 00:46:24,560
nothing short of terrifying.
So I

713
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:29,840
already in educational institutions,
higher

714
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:32,060
edgy,
you know,

715
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:35,470
institutes of higher education,
women radically outnumber men.

716
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:40,570
And the rate at which they're,
that's changing seems it's in itself to

717
00:46:40,571 --> 00:46:44,140
be increasing.
Why that is is not so obvious.

718
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,850
It's also the case that in pre higher
education settings,

719
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:54,120
increasingly girls outperform boys and
it's also not self evident why that is.

720
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:02,570
It's not a good thing.
Here's some gender differences in

721
00:47:04,471 --> 00:47:08,730
employment.
One of the things that might interest

722
00:47:08,731 --> 00:47:10,690
you might annoy you is that okay?

723
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:17,460
The most common occupation for women in
1956 was basically secretarial.

724
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:21,390
That's still the case,
although the names are different because

725
00:47:21,391 --> 00:47:24,180
it's often administrative assistant or
executive assistant,

726
00:47:24,181 --> 00:47:27,930
but the job descriptions are
fundamentally equivalent.

727
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:33,190
There's 11% women in construction,
15% women in forestry,

728
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:38,610
19% women in mining and 25% women in in
work.

729
00:47:39,341 --> 00:47:44,341
That involves utilities.
There are no female brick masons,

730
00:47:44,351 --> 00:47:48,100
block masons or stone masons.
0.1% very,

731
00:47:48,101 --> 00:47:51,250
very few cement masons,
concrete finishers and turnout,

732
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:54,160
so workers,
very few electrical power line

733
00:47:54,161 --> 00:47:57,400
installers and repairs.
Carpet floor and tile installers,

734
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,690
heating,
air conditioning,

735
00:47:58,691 --> 00:48:00,700
refrigeration,
mechanics and installers,

736
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,660
structural iron and rebar workers,
bus and truck mechanics and diesel

737
00:48:04,661 --> 00:48:07,630
engine specialists.
Miscellaneous vehicle in mobile

738
00:48:07,631 --> 00:48:08,620
equipment,
mechanics,

739
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:13,420
installers and repairs.
Tile and do make dye makers tool and die

740
00:48:13,421 --> 00:48:18,421
makers and roofers all under 1%.
Women.

741
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:25,090
This is the 10 most female dominated
occupations in the United States as of

742
00:48:25,091 --> 00:48:28,180
2010 secretaries and administrative
assistants,

743
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:33,100
96% childcare workers,
95% receptionists and information

744
00:48:33,101 --> 00:48:35,830
clerks,
93% teacher assistants,

745
00:48:35,831 --> 00:48:40,240
92% registered nurses,
91% it's all around 90.

746
00:48:40,241 --> 00:48:42,940
So while cops stop saying that,
bookkeeping,

747
00:48:42,941 --> 00:48:44,290
accounting,
auditing,

748
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,940
maids,
housekeepers,

749
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,580
nursing,
psychiatric and home health aides,

750
00:48:48,581 --> 00:48:52,240
personal and home care aides and general
office clerks.

751
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:55,660
All of those are 85% or more female.

752
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:02,640
Other differences between men and women.
Men are taller than women on average

753
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:05,650
five inches.
The average woman in North America is

754
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:07,990
five foot four and the average man is
five foot nine.

755
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:13,810
The average man weighs 194 pounds and
the average woman weighs 164 pounds.

756
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,350
Um,
men are 40 to 60% stronger in their

757
00:49:17,351 --> 00:49:18,184
upper body

758
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:25,460
and they and their and their,
their jaw size is much larger.

759
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:29,670
That's because jaws are used for
aggression.

760
00:49:29,671 --> 00:49:32,460
They're used for biting and so it's a
hangover from,

761
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:36,090
if you will,
a hangover from our more primordial

762
00:49:36,091 --> 00:49:39,660
past.
Women have a higher proportion of body

763
00:49:39,661 --> 00:49:42,420
fat,
they're more resistant to disease.

764
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:47,990
There are far more male homicide victim,
77% there are far more male homicide

765
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:53,250
perpetrators,
85% if women kill someone,

766
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:57,780
it's usually an intimate partner or
family member 60% of the time.

767
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:02,610
Whereas if men kill someone,
it's usually a non intimate acquaintance

768
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:07,760
or a stranger.
So obviously you're much safer with a

769
00:50:07,891 --> 00:50:11,160
woman you don't know.
Yeah,

770
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:17,100
predation instrumental versus defensive
aggression,

771
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:21,840
8% of the male population hunts,
and that's 91% male.

772
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:25,600
Okay.

773
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:30,300
Now,
one of the things that is characteristic

774
00:50:30,301 --> 00:50:35,301
of modern culture is that we associate
almost unthinkingly axiomatically

775
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:42,560
agreeableness with virtue,
and we think that compassion,

776
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:43,823
empathy

777
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,393
are

778
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:53,350
virtues that should predominate in
people's virtue hierarchy and that they

779
00:50:53,571 --> 00:50:56,960
should be fostered.
But one of the things that's very much

780
00:50:56,961 --> 00:51:00,890
worth considering is that all virtues
turned into vices.

781
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:04,280
If you push them far enough,
and that's part of the reason why they

782
00:51:04,281 --> 00:51:05,840
would be normally distributed,
right?

783
00:51:05,841 --> 00:51:10,841
Because every trait has a range within
which it's functional and outside of

784
00:51:11,511 --> 00:51:13,790
that range,
the probability that it will be

785
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,740
functional starts to become very,
very low.

786
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:19,420
Now,
empathy,

787
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:23,420
warmth and compassion sound like very
good things,

788
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:24,523
but

789
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:29,020
they can also be construed as trusting,
submissive,

790
00:51:29,021 --> 00:51:32,050
and compliant,
which could be perceived as naivete

791
00:51:32,051 --> 00:51:35,740
docility and a tendency to follow rather
than lead.

792
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:40,830
Now we do know that one of the
predictors of dependent personality

793
00:51:40,871 --> 00:51:44,830
disorder is high levels of agreeableness
and that that is a disorder that is more

794
00:51:44,831 --> 00:51:48,760
characteristic of women and anxiety
disorders and depressive disorders are

795
00:51:48,761 --> 00:51:52,570
also much more prevalent in women and
that's likely associated not with

796
00:51:52,571 --> 00:51:54,400
agreeableness,
but with high levels of negative

797
00:51:54,401 --> 00:51:58,990
emotion.
Now this paper 2001 is the effects of

798
00:51:58,991 --> 00:52:02,080
personality on executive career success
in the U S and Europe.

799
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:03,603
Now,
you know,

800
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:05,860
everybody talks about the glass ceiling,
right?

801
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:10,210
And the idea that women make less money
than men for the same amount of work.

802
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,100
Well,
the first thing I would say is that's

803
00:52:12,101 --> 00:52:15,100
not true for single people.
Just so you know,

804
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:17,263
and

805
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:22,390
it isn't obvious that the reason that
women make less money than men when they

806
00:52:22,391 --> 00:52:27,391
do is because of prejudice.
So women are more likely to work part

807
00:52:27,701 --> 00:52:28,600
time,
for example.

808
00:52:28,601 --> 00:52:30,190
And the reasons for that are pretty
obvious.

809
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:33,190
All you have to do is think about that
for 15 seconds to figure out why.

810
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:38,430
And the reason is is that many women
have children in their thirties and one

811
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:44,201
of the ways of balancing the development
of your career with the burden of having

812
00:52:45,321 --> 00:52:48,020
children or the wonder of having
children,

813
00:52:48,021 --> 00:52:51,320
it depending on how you look at it,
is by working part time.

814
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:54,320
Now,
one of the problems with that,

815
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:56,660
well,
there's two problems potentially.

816
00:52:58,370 --> 00:52:59,720
Well,
I'll show you the next slide before I

817
00:52:59,721 --> 00:53:00,830
get into that.
Okay.

818
00:53:00,831 --> 00:53:05,160
So
I'll go to this next one.

819
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:07,530
Yeah.
Okay.

820
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:11,130
So here's some correlations.
One of them is between how much money

821
00:53:11,131 --> 00:53:15,990
you make and your personality.
So the correlation between neuroticism

822
00:53:15,991 --> 00:53:18,300
and how much money you get paid is
negative 0.3.

823
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:21,330
The higher you are neuroticism,
the less you make,

824
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,160
less you get paid.
Why?

825
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:31,420
Why do you think that is?
Why?

826
00:53:31,421 --> 00:53:33,280
Because you're not confident in your own
abilities.

827
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,510
You have low self esteem and if you're
not confident in your own abilities and

828
00:53:37,511 --> 00:53:41,380
you're anxious about your performance,
the probability that you're going to

829
00:53:41,381 --> 00:53:46,060
feel confident and calm about
negotiating for more money or even

830
00:53:46,061 --> 00:53:47,830
asking for a raise is quite low.

831
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:49,953
Okay?

832
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:52,700
Extraversion and money made virtually no
correlation.

833
00:53:52,701 --> 00:53:53,870
Openness,
no correlation.

834
00:53:53,871 --> 00:53:57,110
Agreeableness,
negative 0.2 for now,

835
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:59,390
you might not think that those
correlations are very large,

836
00:53:59,391 --> 00:54:03,110
but if the correlation between
neuroticism and money made is negative

837
00:54:03,111 --> 00:54:06,580
0.3 if you translate that into an effect
size cause,

838
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:09,290
this is called a binomial effect size
distribution,

839
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:14,500
just the effect of neuroticism.
We'll ensure that 65% of men make more

840
00:54:16,041 --> 00:54:19,220
money than average and 35% of women make
more money than average.

841
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:24,310
Just the effect of neuroticism and if
you add neuroticism and agreeableness

842
00:54:24,351 --> 00:54:26,660
together,
I have to do the math because I have to

843
00:54:26,661 --> 00:54:28,430
square,
I have to take the square root.

844
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:30,230
It's 0.5

845
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,960
0.5

846
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,790
I can't do that in front of a class.
Unfortunately it's going to push it up

847
00:54:41,791 --> 00:54:46,791
to about 70 30 or higher than that.
There's a little bit of a negative

848
00:54:46,801 --> 00:54:51,030
correlation between conscious
conscientiousness and money made

849
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:54,690
ascendancy.
How well you progress up the ranks.

850
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:55,613
Yes.

851
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:57,400
Directly or indirectly?

852
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:03,490
I don't know cause I,
I didn't look that,

853
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:06,100
I didn't look in detail into the models
they use,

854
00:55:06,101 --> 00:55:08,470
so I was just going to stick to the zero
order correlations.

855
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:13,980
So ascendancy negative 0.2,
one for neuroticism,

856
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:17,500
negative 0.144

857
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:23,450
agreeableness,
the effects are larger if you totaled

858
00:55:23,451 --> 00:55:25,700
them.
Let's see.

859
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:28,730
Here's a good one.
This is something to think about.

860
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:34,010
Job Satisfaction.
The correlation with neuroticism is

861
00:55:34,011 --> 00:55:37,460
negative points for two.
That's a big one.

862
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:40,340
One of the things that's very
interesting about neuroticism is it's

863
00:55:40,341 --> 00:55:42,740
also a very good predictor of marital
satisfaction.

864
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:47,960
And it's interesting in that light to
note that 70% of divorces are initiated

865
00:55:47,961 --> 00:55:49,130
by women.
Now,

866
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,820
one reason for that is that men are
impossible to get along with.

867
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:57,320
And the other possibility is that women
are too sensitive to that and there's no

868
00:55:57,321 --> 00:56:00,410
way of sorting that out,
but it's nonetheless interesting to note

869
00:56:00,411 --> 00:56:02,510
that that's still where the gender
difference lives.

870
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:08,120
Neuroticism correlation with job
satisfaction,

871
00:56:08,121 --> 00:56:10,910
negative 0.42 correlation with life
satisfaction,

872
00:56:10,911 --> 00:56:13,970
negative 0.42 correlation with career
satisfaction,

873
00:56:13,971 --> 00:56:18,971
negative 0.41 so one of the things you
want to remember is that almost all the

874
00:56:20,121 --> 00:56:24,070
measures that purport to measure
something like wellbeing or happiness or

875
00:56:24,071 --> 00:56:28,990
satisfaction are so contaminated with
neuroticism that it's not even clear

876
00:56:28,991 --> 00:56:30,670
that they're measuring something
different.

877
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:35,260
You see agreeableness,
the correlation with career

878
00:56:35,261 --> 00:56:37,450
satisfaction,
just negative 0.2

879
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:45,890
if you get men to rate their performance
and you get their bosses to rate their

880
00:56:45,991 --> 00:56:48,960
performance,
men rate their performance pretty much

881
00:56:48,961 --> 00:56:52,350
the same as the bosses rate their
performance or maybe they rate them a

882
00:56:52,351 --> 00:56:55,680
little bit more.
But if women rate their own performance,

883
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:58,830
they rate their own performance as worse
than their bosses rating of their

884
00:56:58,831 --> 00:57:02,460
performance consistently.
And the predictor of that seems to be

885
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:04,140
negative emotionality.

886
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:12,380
Now you might wonder if negative
emotionality is something that's

887
00:57:12,381 --> 00:57:17,381
associated with lower levels of life
satisfaction across a broad variety of

888
00:57:17,691 --> 00:57:20,600
measures.
What possible use could it be?

889
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:23,960
But then you have to wonder,
well,

890
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:28,010
exactly how is the physical environment
different for women and for men?

891
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:33,430
And one clearer fact is that at an
individual level,

892
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:38,930
at least in relationship to dominance,
battles with men,

893
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:42,680
women are at a disadvantage,
not least because of their size.

894
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,960
Now it is the case,
for example,

895
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:49,940
that women hit men in marital
relationships more often than men hit

896
00:57:49,941 --> 00:57:50,774
women.

897
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:51,790
Okay,

898
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:54,430
but that's,
that's the sort of statistic that makes

899
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,890
you wonder about measures and
statistics.

900
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:01,980
What's wrong with that measure?
Exactly.

901
00:58:05,521 --> 00:58:07,380
That's exactly it.
You know,

902
00:58:07,381 --> 00:58:10,410
so it depends.
It depends precisely on how you define

903
00:58:10,411 --> 00:58:11,850
hit,
you know,

904
00:58:11,851 --> 00:58:14,970
and it's a very tricky thing because it
could be frequency,

905
00:58:14,971 --> 00:58:17,640
it could even be,
it could be frequency that that

906
00:58:17,641 --> 00:58:22,140
certainly might be a measure,
but the best measure would likely likely

907
00:58:22,141 --> 00:58:24,990
be something like damaged per blow.

908
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:34,090
Here's a study of the differences
between men and women.

909
00:58:34,091 --> 00:58:36,850
At an aspect level.
Women are more enthusiastic,

910
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:41,140
one fifth of a standard deviation there,
a little less assertive,

911
00:58:41,141 --> 00:58:44,050
but not very much.
Those are both elements of extroversion.

912
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:47,200
They're more compassionate,
almost half a standard deviation.

913
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:49,360
There are about a third of a standard
deviation,

914
00:58:49,361 --> 00:58:51,490
more polite.
There's no difference in

915
00:58:51,491 --> 00:58:54,190
industriousness.
Women are slightly more orderly than

916
00:58:54,191 --> 00:58:55,960
men.
Here's something to think about.

917
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:58,120
This is something that I noticed,
for example,

918
00:58:58,121 --> 00:59:03,121
when I was raising kids,
so I would intervene when my kids were

919
00:59:03,161 --> 00:59:06,070
misbehaving far more often than my wife
would,

920
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:10,450
but if I could just shut up for five
seconds when they were being annoying,

921
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:14,290
then she had to intervene.
And all that meant was my threshold for

922
00:59:14,291 --> 00:59:18,040
being annoyed by misbehavior was just
slightly lower than hers.

923
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:21,800
But what that meant in practice was
because it was lower,

924
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:24,860
I ended up doing,
I ended up intervening far more often

925
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:26,150
because I would get fed,
you know,

926
00:59:26,151 --> 00:59:31,151
if it took her 63 seconds to get annoyed
and me 60 what that would mean

927
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:35,090
practically would be that I was
intervening most of the time.

928
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:38,240
So in women are a little bit more
orderly than men too.

929
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:41,420
So you might ask yourself what exactly
that would mean for the division of

930
00:59:41,421 --> 00:59:44,750
Labor in a household.
Because what it suggests is that if

931
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:49,700
there's disarray in the household,
the probability is such that the tip of

932
00:59:49,701 --> 00:59:53,810
a woman will get more annoyed about that
faster than the typical Matt and how

933
00:59:53,811 --> 00:59:57,140
that would translate into the manner in
which household duties are distributed.

934
00:59:57,141 --> 00:59:59,840
I don't know.
But it's important to remember that

935
00:59:59,841 --> 01:00:03,680
small differences at the mean level can
produce very large differences in

936
01:00:03,681 --> 01:00:04,514
behavior.

937
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:09,710
Women are lower and intellect and higher
and openness.

938
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,470
And I think that probably goes along
with the,

939
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:15,590
with the interest dimension,
we saw already that women are more

940
01:00:15,591 --> 01:00:19,700
interested in artistic pursuits than men
are and that makes sense because we know

941
01:00:19,701 --> 01:00:24,440
that the openness to experience part of
openness is a predictor for example,

942
01:00:24,441 --> 01:00:28,190
of whether you were in the humanities or
in the sciences in university.

943
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:33,191
So intellect predicts roughly speaking,
interest in the sciences and openness to

944
01:00:33,291 --> 01:00:35,960
experience predicts interest in the
humanities.

945
01:00:35,961 --> 01:00:40,961
In the arts,
women are half a standard deviation,

946
01:00:41,381 --> 01:00:45,250
more agreeable.
This is at the big five level and four

947
01:00:45,251 --> 01:00:49,510
tenths of a standard deviation,
more sensitive to negative emotion.

948
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:54,130
So the two really big traits that
differentiate men from women are

949
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:56,410
agreeableness.
And negative emotion.

950
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:03,610
Now you might ask,
here's another chart that's quite

951
01:01:03,611 --> 01:01:05,150
interesting.
Um

952
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:09,663
Huh.

953
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:14,800
Motivation variables by big five traits.
Evenings worked.

954
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:17,820
Extrovert.
Extroverts are more likely to work.

955
01:01:17,821 --> 01:01:20,490
Evenings.
Agreeable people are less likely to work

956
01:01:20,491 --> 01:01:22,800
evenings.
Now that's interesting because you might

957
01:01:22,801 --> 01:01:25,800
think that if they were agreeable,
they'd work more evenings.

958
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:29,730
But I suspect that's what's happening
with the agreeable people is that

959
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:33,810
because their primary commitment is to
intimate relationships,

960
01:01:33,811 --> 01:01:37,830
they're more likely to consider their
primary domain,

961
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:41,490
their responsibilities to intimate
partners of various sorts.

962
01:01:41,491 --> 01:01:43,740
And so they'll goal work for that
reason.

963
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:48,740
Conscientious people work is more
central to their life.

964
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:52,050
It's also the case with open people.
So,

965
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:53,630
okay.

966
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:56,040
Uh,
the correlation between agreeableness

967
01:01:56,041 --> 01:02:00,540
and hours worked is negative 0.16.
The correlation between agreeableness

968
01:02:00,541 --> 01:02:04,440
and the hours of work that someone
desires is negative 0.17.

969
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:12,493
Okay.

970
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:16,880
Here's some things that predict,
um,

971
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:19,170
relationship instability on divorce.

972
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:24,970
Most personality traits have substantial
effects on mating and parenting related

973
01:02:24,971 --> 01:02:27,850
behaviors such as sexual promiscuity,
relationship stability,

974
01:02:27,851 --> 01:02:29,590
and divorce.
Promiscuity.

975
01:02:29,591 --> 01:02:33,070
And the desire for multiple sexual
partners are predicted by extraversion

976
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:37,150
openness to experience neuroticism,
especially in women.

977
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,730
Positive skid sodomy,
which we won't bother with.

978
01:02:39,731 --> 01:02:43,780
And the dark traits like narcissism,
psychopathy and machiavellianism,

979
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:48,610
negative predictors of promiscuity and
short term mating include agreeableness,

980
01:02:48,611 --> 01:02:50,800
conscientiousness,
honesty,

981
01:02:50,801 --> 01:02:52,360
humility.
In the HEXACO model,

982
01:02:52,361 --> 01:02:56,080
which is a six dimensional model and
autistic light traits,

983
01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:00,190
relationship instability is associated
with extroversion,

984
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,710
low agreeableness and low
conscientiousness.

985
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:03,783
Yeah,
that's,

986
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:06,340
that's high extroversion,
low agreeableness and low

987
01:03:06,341 --> 01:03:09,280
conscientiousness.
That's tilting quite hard towards

988
01:03:09,281 --> 01:03:12,480
psychopathy.
So someone who is really extroverted and

989
01:03:12,481 --> 01:03:15,610
really low and really low in
agreeableness,

990
01:03:15,611 --> 01:03:20,080
they tend to be narcissistic.
And that's not necessarily a problem if

991
01:03:20,081 --> 01:03:22,750
they're high in conscientiousness,
cause you can still,

992
01:03:22,810 --> 01:03:25,450
they might be selfish and after their
own interest,

993
01:03:25,451 --> 01:03:26,830
but if they're high in
conscientiousness,

994
01:03:26,831 --> 01:03:28,390
if they tell you that they'll do
something,

995
01:03:28,391 --> 01:03:31,180
they'll do it.
And generally you can expect that.

996
01:03:31,181 --> 01:03:34,210
They'll tell you the truth.
If they're low in conscientiousness,

997
01:03:34,211 --> 01:03:38,350
well then you have a big problem because
they tend to be somewhat parasitical,

998
01:03:38,410 --> 01:03:42,160
which is one way of defining low
conscientiousness and disagreeable.

999
01:03:42,161 --> 01:03:44,080
So they only care about themselves and
extroverted.

1000
01:03:44,081 --> 01:03:46,720
So they're very dominant and outgoing.
So.

1001
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:48,010
Okay.

1002
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:49,150
Finally,
neuroticism,

1003
01:03:49,151 --> 01:03:51,370
low conscientiousness,
and to a smaller extent,

1004
01:03:51,371 --> 01:03:54,520
low agreeableness all contribute to
increase the likelihood of divorce.

1005
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:01,300
Now in this study,

1006
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:11,433
okay,

1007
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:14,770
there is a 16 pdf study done.
You can't see it here because it's cut

1008
01:04:14,771 --> 01:04:17,830
off on this slide a couple of years ago.
What they did,

1009
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,140
it's quite interesting.
Instead of just looking at the zero

1010
01:04:20,141 --> 01:04:22,540
order correlations between gender and
personality,

1011
01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:26,590
they summed all the differences to see
what the overall difference was between

1012
01:04:26,591 --> 01:04:29,410
men and women.
So you'd have one normal distribution

1013
01:04:29,411 --> 01:04:31,840
that was man and another normal
distribution that was women,

1014
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:33,940
and then you could see how much they
overlapped.

1015
01:04:33,941 --> 01:04:35,710
If you summed up all the gender
differences,

1016
01:04:35,711 --> 01:04:40,030
and the answer was they were three
standard deviations different in total,

1017
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:43,390
which is a whopping difference.
It meant that the personality

1018
01:04:43,391 --> 01:04:47,890
distributions of men and women over out
only overlapped in total by 10%

1019
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,860
they found in the 16 pdf pdf,
Scotty,

1020
01:04:51,861 --> 01:04:55,400
that's an old personality scale that was
originally formulated by cattle and it

1021
01:04:55,401 --> 01:04:58,550
was a precursor to the big five.
The reason they used it was because they

1022
01:04:58,551 --> 01:05:02,030
had historical data that many thousands
of people had filled out.

1023
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:05,750
So the fact that it wasn't
psychometrically arrayed probably didn't

1024
01:05:05,751 --> 01:05:09,680
mean there was no information in it.
So women were hiring sensitivity,

1025
01:05:09,681 --> 01:05:10,940
warmth,
and apprehension,

1026
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:13,250
warmth than apprehension.
You could associate it with

1027
01:05:13,251 --> 01:05:16,640
agreeableness and neuroticism and men
were more emotionally stable,

1028
01:05:16,641 --> 01:05:17,830
more dominant,
more rural,

1029
01:05:17,831 --> 01:05:19,450
conscious,
and more vigilant.

1030
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,360
Now,
one last thing.

1031
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:29,083
Okay.

1032
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:34,670
This is something to think about.
How do men and women differ in the way

1033
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:36,760
they evaluate mates?

1034
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:40,280
Well,
here's the study.

1035
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:43,640
More than a thousand respondents,
primarily female,

1036
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,140
what they looked at was how much each
person,

1037
01:05:48,590 --> 01:05:50,990
how much prestige each person had in
their occupation.

1038
01:05:50,991 --> 01:05:53,300
So kind of where they were situated in
the dominance hierarchy,

1039
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:56,150
what their income was in education.
So they're all markers,

1040
01:05:56,270 --> 01:05:59,930
they're all pretty decent markers of
socio economic status,

1041
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:02,300
or they're pretty decent markers of
status.

1042
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:05,030
So,
and then they looked at how many

1043
01:06:05,031 --> 01:06:09,140
partners each person had number of
lifetime partners and number of

1044
01:06:09,141 --> 01:06:12,000
preceding year or sexual partners,
um,

1045
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,530
lifetime occurrence of simultaneous
partners.

1046
01:06:14,531 --> 01:06:16,310
So that was someone who was in a
relationship,

1047
01:06:16,370 --> 01:06:20,360
a sexual relationship with more than one
person at the same time and lifetime

1048
01:06:20,361 --> 01:06:25,361
frequency of simultaneous partners from
one very seldom or never to five very

1049
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:28,730
often.
Here's their assumption,

1050
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:33,820
the number of partners,
a member of sex a acquires is an index

1051
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:38,390
of how often this individual is chosen
by the other sex.

1052
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:42,830
It's just a definition.
It's an indication of reproductive

1053
01:06:42,831 --> 01:06:45,920
fitness as judged by members of the
opposite sex

1054
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,460
results.
Male criteria

1055
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:56,430
for women.
The correlation between their fertility

1056
01:06:56,431 --> 01:06:59,580
rates and the number of partners in the
previous year was 0.94

1057
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:05,260
so that's basically markers of
biological youth and also markers of

1058
01:07:05,261 --> 01:07:09,400
biological health like symmetry or waist
to hip ratio,

1059
01:07:09,401 --> 01:07:11,920
which actually tends to be correlated
with reproductive,

1060
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:17,320
um,
fitness because women with lower waist

1061
01:07:18,311 --> 01:07:22,870
to hip ratios are generally healthier
because especially in youth,

1062
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:28,300
the acquisition of abdominal fat is
often an indicator of subpar physical

1063
01:07:28,301 --> 01:07:31,090
health.
The correlation between the fertility

1064
01:07:31,091 --> 01:07:35,290
rate and the number of partners in the
previous year is 0.94 that's all of it,

1065
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:39,010
right?
You never see a correlation to 0.94

1066
01:07:39,011 --> 01:07:43,900
anywhere ever.
Males choose fertility indicators,

1067
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:46,630
beauty waist to hip ratio,
youthful appearance,

1068
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:51,580
neon naughtiness facial features,
and Nia naughtiness beans like a infant.

1069
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:56,790
So one of the uh,
one of the markers of feminine beauty is

1070
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:01,990
a face that has small childlike
features,

1071
01:08:05,390 --> 01:08:08,360
female criteria,
all respondents.

1072
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:12,320
The correlation between socioeconomic
status and frequency of simultaneous

1073
01:08:12,321 --> 01:08:14,060
partners.
For men it's 0.5.

1074
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:17,030
So the,
the status of the man man,

1075
01:08:17,031 --> 01:08:19,940
the more likely he has simultaneous
sexual partners,

1076
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:22,760
so it means he's going out with someone
sexually at the same time.

1077
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:28,400
For men it's 0.49.
For Women it's zero age 30 and over.

1078
01:08:28,401 --> 01:08:33,080
Correlation between socioeconomic status
and frequency of simultaneous partners.

1079
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:35,930
For men it's 0.8.
For Women it's zero

1080
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:42,690
age 30 to 39 the correlation between
socioeconomic status for women and

1081
01:08:42,691 --> 01:08:44,400
frequency of Simile,
tineas partners.

1082
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:47,880
For men it's 0.92 that's a very small
end though.

1083
01:08:48,150 --> 01:08:49,620
For Women,
it's 0.11

1084
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:54,240
female criteria.
For men,

1085
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:58,020
it might reflect the tendency on the
part of females to choose high status

1086
01:08:58,021 --> 01:09:00,660
partners during their own pre peak
reproductive years.

1087
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:04,110
This might account,
especially for the strong relationship

1088
01:09:04,111 --> 01:09:09,111
founded men between the age of 30 and 39
women who typically prefer men three to

1089
01:09:09,871 --> 01:09:12,960
eight years older than they are,
would then be in there may mid to late

1090
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,170
twenties a time when fecundability
enough sensitivity to male resources is

1091
01:09:16,171 --> 01:09:17,004
at its peak

1092
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,960
supporting evidence.
I don't believe that,

1093
01:09:22,961 --> 01:09:25,330
by the way,
I don't think that women pick men for

1094
01:09:25,331 --> 01:09:28,250
the socioeconomic status.
I think that women pick men for the or

1095
01:09:28,251 --> 01:09:32,680
ability to climb the status hierarchy
because we forced women in an experiment

1096
01:09:32,681 --> 01:09:35,530
that we never published to choose
between those two things.

1097
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:39,130
Wealth versus ability.
The women overwhelmingly chose the

1098
01:09:39,131 --> 01:09:41,470
ability,
they just use wealth as a marker of

1099
01:09:41,471 --> 01:09:42,420
ability.
Yup.

1100
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:48,070
It was an honors thesis and often honors
thesis,

1101
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:51,430
even if they're publishable,
drift into the thing all due next month

1102
01:09:51,431 --> 01:09:54,310
and then they stay there forever.
So cause it's a hard,

1103
01:09:54,311 --> 01:09:58,270
it's actually quite hard to turn an
honors thesis into a publishable paper

1104
01:09:58,271 --> 01:10:01,720
and if there isn't some single person
driving that forward,

1105
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:03,250
it's,
it's not going to happen.

1106
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,530
So that,
that was the only reason.

1107
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:10,450
Okay.
So Trevor's parental investment model

1108
01:10:10,451 --> 01:10:13,420
contends that women are more likely than
men to seek a mate who possesses

1109
01:10:13,421 --> 01:10:16,870
nonphysical characteristics that
maximize their survival or reproductive

1110
01:10:16,871 --> 01:10:20,110
prospects of their offspring.
And we're examining in a Meta analysis

1111
01:10:20,111 --> 01:10:25,111
of mate selection research as pre
predicted women accorded more weight

1112
01:10:25,780 --> 01:10:29,560
than men to socioeconomic status,
ambitiousness character and intelligence

1113
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:33,940
and the larger differences.
Largest Jeff gender differences were

1114
01:10:33,941 --> 01:10:38,860
observed for cues to resource equation,
acquisition status and ambitiousness.

1115
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:42,400
I'll also as predicted gender
preferences were not found in

1116
01:10:42,401 --> 01:10:45,640
preferences for characteristics
unrelated to progeny survival,

1117
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:48,520
like sense of humor in general,
personality

1118
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:51,750
were valid,
comparisons can be made.

1119
01:10:51,751 --> 01:10:54,390
The findings were generally invariant
across generations,

1120
01:10:54,391 --> 01:10:56,100
cultures and research paradigms.

1121
01:11:00,090 --> 01:11:05,090
Well,
so what do you think of that?

1122
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,113
You know,

1123
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:12,440
the most,

1124
01:11:25,450 --> 01:11:28,600
one of the things that it strongly
indicates is that men and women value

1125
01:11:28,601 --> 01:11:33,601
different things.
And that's worth thinking about because

1126
01:11:33,761 --> 01:11:36,370
the hypothesis,
and I think this is especially strongly

1127
01:11:36,371 --> 01:11:40,960
held among people who are very young,
is that the differences are culture and

1128
01:11:40,961 --> 01:11:43,870
the life cultural and the life course is
the same.

1129
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:48,100
So,
but that I don't think there's any

1130
01:11:48,101 --> 01:11:51,970
evidence that that's the case at all.
I have a lot of experience dealing,

1131
01:11:51,971 --> 01:11:53,800
for example,
with large law firms,

1132
01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:56,680
and one of the things that happens to
large law firms,

1133
01:11:56,950 --> 01:12:00,520
they're very competitive fee and the
people who are partners are making a

1134
01:12:00,521 --> 01:12:03,460
tremendous amount of money.
So it would be generally in excess of

1135
01:12:03,550 --> 01:12:07,600
300 $400,000 a year.
Now in order to do that,

1136
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:11,890
they have to go through virtual
enslavement during their internship.

1137
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,520
It's not called an internship.
It's called an Arctic there articling

1138
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:19,120
and then they have to be on call 80
hours a week.

1139
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:23,290
That's the life.
What happens is that they lose all their

1140
01:12:23,291 --> 01:12:25,690
women in their thirties they can't keep
them.

1141
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:31,390
And it's not because they don't try
because they try and the reason they try

1142
01:12:31,391 --> 01:12:35,590
is that there just aren't that many
people who are exceptionally able.

1143
01:12:35,591 --> 01:12:39,400
And so the law firms are trying to keep
every single person they possibly can.

1144
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:44,170
Who's exceptionally able because those
people produce profits for the law firm.

1145
01:12:44,290 --> 01:12:48,040
It's just in their best interest.
But the women all quit and their

1146
01:12:48,041 --> 01:12:50,380
thirties
well,

1147
01:12:50,381 --> 01:12:52,180
why?
Well,

1148
01:12:52,181 --> 01:12:53,980
there's a bunch of reasons.
The first reason is,

1149
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:58,300
is that a woman who's high in the
socioeconomic ladder is going to pick a

1150
01:12:58,301 --> 01:13:00,220
man who's hiring the socioeconomic
ladder.

1151
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:03,370
She's gonna marry across or up.
That's what the data show.

1152
01:13:03,371 --> 01:13:08,371
And what that means is that most female
potential law partners in their early

1153
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:11,110
thirties are married to someone who
makes a fair bit of money.

1154
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:15,430
So the absolute magnitude of their
income is no longer as relevant as it

1155
01:13:15,431 --> 01:13:18,970
would be if they were single.
It's also one of the factors by the way,

1156
01:13:19,150 --> 01:13:23,950
that's contributing to the polarization
of society and to those who have a lot

1157
01:13:23,951 --> 01:13:27,280
of money in and those who have none.
Because what happens is that men who are

1158
01:13:27,281 --> 01:13:31,150
rich will marry women who are poor,
but women who are rich will not marry

1159
01:13:31,151 --> 01:13:34,510
men who are poor.
And so what happens across time is that

1160
01:13:34,511 --> 01:13:37,810
sort of grinds its way through the
culture is that all the rich women are

1161
01:13:37,811 --> 01:13:40,690
with rich men.
And that increases the probability that

1162
01:13:40,691 --> 01:13:43,300
wealth is going to pool in the hands of
fewer and fewer people.

1163
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,630
What the women seem to come,
what the women seem to

1164
01:13:49,220 --> 01:13:50,450
realize or

1165
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:54,460
conclude.
I would say it's two things.

1166
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:58,810
One is that it's just not that much fun
to work for 80 hours a week.

1167
01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:00,760
Really.
Like it's,

1168
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:03,460
and if you want to have a life outside
of work,

1169
01:14:03,490 --> 01:14:06,130
that's not the way to do it.
And so then you might ask,

1170
01:14:06,131 --> 01:14:08,470
well why would anyone work 80 hours a
week?

1171
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:11,800
Because that's the real question.
It's not why some women won't obviously,

1172
01:14:11,801 --> 01:14:12,850
why would you?
You know,

1173
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:16,030
the answer is well there's a lot of
status and there's a lot of money

1174
01:14:16,031 --> 01:14:19,000
associated with it.
But the thing is is that status is more

1175
01:14:19,001 --> 01:14:22,840
important to men than it is for women.
And I think that's individually true and

1176
01:14:22,841 --> 01:14:27,760
also genetically true because for men,
status is associated with how attractive

1177
01:14:27,761 --> 01:14:31,030
they are to women.
Whereas for women status,

1178
01:14:31,031 --> 01:14:34,420
socioeconomic status has nothing to do
with how attractive they are to men.

1179
01:14:34,421 --> 01:14:35,890
In fact,
if anything,

1180
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:40,180
one of the things you find for example,
is that as women are

1181
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:43,210
segregated,
so to speak,

1182
01:14:43,211 --> 01:14:45,680
higher and higher up the Iq
distribution,

1183
01:14:45,710 --> 01:14:48,310
the probability that they'll get married
goes lower and lower.

1184
01:14:48,910 --> 01:14:51,010
And the reason for that is that it's
harder.

1185
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:53,290
You know,
once you're at the 95th percentile of

1186
01:14:53,291 --> 01:14:56,740
intelligence and you're going to marry a
cross and up,

1187
01:14:57,010 --> 01:14:59,170
you've,
you've already limited to one in 20

1188
01:14:59,171 --> 01:15:02,650
people in just as it just maintain the
same level.

1189
01:15:02,830 --> 01:15:05,020
And so if you're very intelligent,
very educated,

1190
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,870
and you also have a very high status job
if you're a woman,

1191
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:10,600
well first of all,
your bloody intimidating to most men.

1192
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:12,790
And second,
the probability that you're going to

1193
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:13,830
choose from,
uh,

1194
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:16,450
a hot spot in the hierarchy lower than
you is very low.

1195
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:19,090
You're just not going to be attracted to
that person.

1196
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:22,660
And so what happens to women who are
exceptionally intelligent is that the

1197
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:26,830
pool of acceptable mating partners
starts to become vanishingly small.

1198
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:32,400
So that combined with the propensity of
women to judge 85% of men in online

1199
01:15:33,191 --> 01:15:37,000
dating services as less attractive than
average,

1200
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:40,420
makes it that much more difficult.
Now,

1201
01:15:40,421 --> 01:15:41,560
I should say,
you know,

1202
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:44,400
all the prejudice is clearly not on the
side of women.

1203
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:48,940
And by no means,
because if you look at male attitudes

1204
01:15:48,941 --> 01:15:52,570
towards women in large online dating
site studies,

1205
01:15:52,810 --> 01:15:57,810
you'll find that their preference for
body configuration is 21 years old.

1206
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:02,110
And that doesn't change as the males
age.

1207
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:06,250
So you know,
the selection criteria on both the male

1208
01:16:06,251 --> 01:16:09,850
and the female side are extremely harsh.
So,

1209
01:16:18,230 --> 01:16:22,390
so
think about that.

1210
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,430
See you.
Thank you.

1211
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:26,660
Okay.
