1
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,440
Today I want to present to you some of 
the things I've been thinking and 

2
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,291
writing about his Easter approached.
I'm going to do this in five separate 

3
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,660
parts which hopefully will make up a 
coherent hole.

4
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:29,560
I'm going to read all of this because 
it's complicated in part one,

5
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:35,010
the nature of experience.
There are two ways of looking at the 

6
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,511
world as a place of things and there's a
forum for action because we are living 

7
00:00:43,551 --> 00:00:47,630
beings and must make our way 
pragmatically in the world.

8
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,560
The second way of looking has to take 
precedence.

9
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,640
This means that the world as a place of 
things is nested inside the world as a 

10
00:00:58,221 --> 00:01:02,990
forum for action.
This means that our conceptualization of

11
00:01:02,991 --> 00:01:07,991
the world as objective must remain 
subordinate to our conceptualization of 

12
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:13,601
the world as a place of being.
This is from the first part of my book.

13
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:16,830
Maps

14
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,010
meaning quote,

15
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,360
the world can be validly construed as 
forum for action or place of things.

16
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:33,310
The former manner of interpretation,
more primordial and less clearly 

17
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:38,261
understood,
finds its expression in the arts or 

18
00:01:38,261 --> 00:01:40,100
humanities,
enriched reuel drama,

19
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:45,190
literature and mythology of the world as
forum for auction is a place of value,

20
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,430
a place where all things have meaning.

21
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:55,860
This meaning which is shaped as a 
consequence of social interaction is 

22
00:01:56,201 --> 00:02:01,201
implication for action or at a higher 
level of analysis implication for the 

23
00:02:02,231 --> 00:02:07,231
configuration of the Interpretive Schema
that produces or guides action the 

24
00:02:08,801 --> 00:02:13,801
ladder manner of interpretation.
The world as place of things finds its 

25
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:17,620
formal expression in the methods and 
theories of science.

26
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:23,490
Science allows for increasingly precise 
determination of the consensually 

27
00:02:23,681 --> 00:02:28,681
validatable properties of things and for
efficient utilization of precisely 

28
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:34,171
determined things as tools.
Once the direction such use is to take 

29
00:02:34,391 --> 00:02:38,950
has been determined through application 
of more fundamental narrative processes.

30
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,880
No complete world picture can be 
generated without use of both modes of 

31
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:50,071
construal.
The fact that one mode is generally set 

32
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:53,611
at odds with the other means only that 
the nature of their respective domains 

33
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:58,051
remains insufficiently discriminated.
Adherence of the mythological worldview 

34
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:04,110
tend to regard the statements of their 
creeds as indistinguishable from 

35
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:08,221
empirical fact.
Even though such statements were 

36
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:11,500
generally formulated long before the 
notion of objective reality emerged,

37
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,970
those who by contrast except the 
scientific perspective who assumed that 

38
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:23,671
it is or might become complete,
forget that an impossible golf currently

39
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:27,160
divides what is from what should be.

40
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,250
I wrote this a little later.
It's also relevant as introduction to 

41
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,811
what we're going to discuss in a bit.
The world can be validly construed as a 

42
00:03:39,421 --> 00:03:42,720
forum for action as well as a place of 
things.

43
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,890
We described the world as a place of 
things using the formal methods of 

44
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,570
science.
The techniques of narrative,

45
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,070
however,
myth,

46
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:57,130
literature,
and drama portray the world as a forum 

47
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,191
for action.
The two forms of representation have 

48
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:03,821
been unnecessarily set at odds because 
we have not yet formed a clear picture 

49
00:04:03,831 --> 00:04:08,831
of their respective domains.
The domain of the former scientific 

50
00:04:10,171 --> 00:04:15,171
domain is the objective world.
What is from the perspective of 

51
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:20,540
intersubjective perception?
The domain of the ladder drama narrative

52
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:26,780
is the world of value.
What is and what should be from the 

53
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,551
perspective of emotion and action.
The world as a forum for action presents

54
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:38,240
itself in two stories.
The normal story,

55
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,140
I was at point a and I was going to 
point b and the revolutionary story.

56
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:51,260
I was at point a and well going to point
b,

57
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:56,350
something entirely unexpected and earth 
shattering happened meant I had to 

58
00:04:57,281 --> 00:05:00,490
abandon my story,
question my assumptions,

59
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,750
a lot of my old beliefs to die and be 
reborn.

60
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,620
A new.

61
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:12,910
The second story which is deeper,
is essentially religious part to some 

62
00:05:15,561 --> 00:05:18,230
axioms of the Christian revolutionary 
story,

63
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:25,120
number one,
to decide that and then enact the 

64
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,700
proposition that being is good despite 
its tragedy and malevolence.

65
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,980
Number two,
to work in consequence for the continual

66
00:05:34,981 --> 00:05:39,510
and eternal improvement of that being 
and to know that as love.

67
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,630
Number three,
to do such work in truth.

68
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,370
Number four,
to let everything inadequate burn off in

69
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:55,690
that pursuit and to welcome its 
replacement by what is better.

70
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,980
Number five,
to know that as the sacred imitation of 

71
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,150
Christ.
Number six,

72
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,530
do you understand that although Christ's
sacrifice redeemed us,

73
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:14,531
all the work still has to be done.
Number seven,

74
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:20,020
to accept that work as the sacred 
meaning of life.

75
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,120
Number eight,
to strive toward the heavenly city on 

76
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,051
the hill in that manner,
part three,

77
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:36,130
narratives and sacrifice for my new 
book,

78
00:06:36,131 --> 00:06:39,400
12 rules for life.
Rule seven,

79
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,300
pursue what is meaningful,
not what is expedient.

80
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:50,550
Every man for himself and the devil.
Take the hindmost as the old proverb 

81
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,560
hasn't.
Why not simply take everything you can 

82
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,761
get whenever the opportunity arises,
why not determined to live in that 

83
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:00,820
manner

84
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:07,210
or is there an alternative and if so,
why should we bother with it?

85
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:14,580
Our ancestors worked out very 
sophisticated answers to such questions,

86
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,220
but we still don't understand them very 
well.

87
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:23,370
This is because they are in large part,
still implicit manifest primarily in 

88
00:07:23,551 --> 00:07:27,930
ritual and myth,
and as of yet in completely articulated,

89
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,650
we act them out and represent them in 
stories,

90
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:36,890
but we're not yet.
Why is it enough to formulate them 

91
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,201
explicitly?
We're still chimps in a troop or wolves 

92
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:41,070
in a pack.
We know how to behave.

93
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:46,460
We know who's who and why.
We've learned that through experience or

94
00:07:46,621 --> 00:07:49,440
knowledge has been shaped by the 
interaction with others.

95
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,640
We've established predictable routines 
and patterns of behavior,

96
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,480
but we don't really understand them or 
know where they originated.

97
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,630
They've evolved over great expanses of 
time,

98
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,710
but we didn't and still don't understand
what it all meant.

99
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:10,860
The Biblical narrative of Paradise and 
the fall is one such story fabricated by

100
00:08:10,861 --> 00:08:14,160
our collective imagination working over 
the centuries.

101
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:19,910
It provides a profound account of the 
nature of being and points the way to a 

102
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:24,331
mode of conceptualization and action,
well matched to that nature in the 

103
00:08:25,411 --> 00:08:29,070
garden of Eden prior to the dawn of self
consciousness,

104
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,400
so goes the story.
Human beings were sinless.

105
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,860
Our primordial parents,
Adam and Eve walked with God,

106
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:42,100
then tempted by the snake.
The first couple ate from the tree of 

107
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:46,181
the knowledge of good and evil,
discovered death and vulnerability and 

108
00:08:46,181 --> 00:08:50,381
turned away from God.
Mankind was exiled from paradise and 

109
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:53,360
began it's effortful,
mortal existence,

110
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,370
the of sacrifice.
Enter soon afterward,

111
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:02,670
beginning with the account of Cain and 
Abel and developing through the 

112
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,760
Abrahamic Adventures and the exodus.
After much contemplation,

113
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,820
struggling humanity learns that God's 
favor could be gained and his wrath 

114
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,991
averted through proper sacrifice,
and also that bloody murder might be 

115
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:19,830
motivated among those unwilling or 
unable to succeed in this matter.

116
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:24,690
The delay of gratification when engaging
in sacrifice,

117
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:29,691
our forefathers began to act out what 
would be considered a proposition if it 

118
00:09:29,691 --> 00:09:34,491
were stated in words that something 
better might be attained in the future 

119
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,630
by giving up something of value in the 
president.

120
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,700
Recall,
if you will,

121
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:44,790
that the necessity for work is one of 
the curses placed by God upon Adam and 

122
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,590
his descendants in consequence of 
original sin.

123
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:52,520
Adam's waking to the fundamental 
constraints of his being,

124
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:57,790
his vulnerability.
His eventual death is equivalent to his 

125
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,610
discovery of the future.

126
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,540
The future

127
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:05,230
that's where you go to die.
Hopefully not too soon.

128
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,410
Your demise might be staved off through 
work,

129
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:12,730
through the sacrifice of the now to gain
benefit later.

130
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:18,630
It is for this reason among others,
no doubt that the concept of sacrifice 

131
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,760
is introduced in the biblical chapter 
immediately following the drama of the 

132
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,841
fall.
There's little difference between 

133
00:10:27,841 --> 00:10:31,640
sacrifice and work.
They're also both uniquely human.

134
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,610
Sometimes animals act as if they're 
working,

135
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,940
but they are really only following the 
dictates of their nature.

136
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:43,120
Beavers build dams.
They do so because they are beavers,

137
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,180
beavers build dams.
They don't think,

138
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:51,270
yeah,
but I'd rather be on a beach in Mexico 

139
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:51,270
with my girlfriend while they're doing 
it.

140
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:57,940
Prosaically such sacrifice work is delay
of gratification,

141
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:03,220
but that's a very mundane phrase to 
describe something of soul shattering 

142
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,091
significance.
The discovery that gratification could 

143
00:11:07,091 --> 00:11:10,481
be delayed was similar to the discovery 
of time and with it causality,

144
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,620
at least the causal force,
a voluntary human action.

145
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:21,700
Long ago in the mists of time,
we began to realize that reality was 

146
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,900
structured as if it could be bargained 
with.

147
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:28,370
We learned that behaving properly now in
the present,

148
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,640
regulating our impulses,
considering the plight of others could 

149
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,460
bring rewards in the future in a time 
and place that did not yet exist.

150
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,960
We began to inhibit control and organize
our immediate impulses so that we could 

151
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:48,830
stop interfering with other people and 
our future selves.

152
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:55,170
Doing so was indistinguishable from 
organizing the discovery of the causal 

153
00:11:55,691 --> 00:11:59,710
relationship between our efforts today 
and the quality of tomorrow.

154
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:04,770
Motivated the social contract,
the organization that enables today's 

155
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:09,361
work to be stored reliably,
mostly in the form of promises from 

156
00:12:09,851 --> 00:12:14,851
others.
Understanding is often acted out before 

157
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:21,571
it can be articulated just as a child 
acts out what it means to be mother or 

158
00:12:21,571 --> 00:12:25,330
father before being able to give a 
spoken account of what those roles mean.

159
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:31,620
The act of making a ritual sacrifice to 
God was an early and sophisticated 

160
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,860
enactment of the idea of the usefulness 
of delay.

161
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,320
There is a long conceptual journey 
between merely feasting,

162
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:46,321
hungrily and learning to set aside some 
extra meat smoke by the fire for the end

163
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,210
of the day or for someone who isn't 
present.

164
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:55,690
It takes a long time to learn to keep 
anything later for yourself or to share 

165
00:12:56,361 --> 00:13:01,361
it with someone else,
and those are very much the same thing 

166
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:03,350
as in the former case you are sharing 
with your future self.

167
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:09,460
It is much easier and far more likely to
selfishly and immediately wolf down 

168
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:14,261
everything in sight.
There are similar long journeys between 

169
00:13:14,301 --> 00:13:19,301
every leap and sophistication with 
regards to delay and its 

170
00:13:19,301 --> 00:13:21,140
conceptualization,
short term sharing,

171
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:26,350
storing away for the future 
representation of that storage in the 

172
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,821
form of records and later in the form of
currency and ultimately the saving of 

173
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:34,670
money in a bank or other social 
institution.

174
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:40,870
Some conceptualizations had to serve as 
intermediaries or the full range of our 

175
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:45,611
practices and ideas surrounding 
sacrifice and work and their 

176
00:13:45,611 --> 00:13:49,511
representation could have never emerged.
Our ancestors acted out a drama fiction.

177
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:58,330
They personified the forest,
that governance fate as a spirit that 

178
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:02,111
can be bargained with,
traded with as if it were another human 

179
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:05,450
being,
and the amazing thing is that it worked.

180
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:10,820
This was in part because the future is 
largely composed of other human beings,

181
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:16,270
often precisely those who have watched 
and evaluated and to praise the tiniest 

182
00:14:16,371 --> 00:14:21,371
details of your past behavior.
It's not very far from that to God 

183
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:27,100
sitting above on high tracking your 
every move and writing it down for 

184
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,931
further reference in a big book.
Here's a productive symbolic idea.

185
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:38,770
The future is a judgmental father.
That's a good start,

186
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,200
but two additional archetypal 
foundational questions arose because of 

187
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,971
the discovery of sacrifice of work both 
have to do with the ultimate extension 

188
00:14:49,851 --> 00:14:54,851
of the logic of work,
which is sacrifice now to gain later.

189
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,530
First question,
what must be sacrificed?

190
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:06,970
Small sacrifices maybe sufficient to 
solve small singular problems,

191
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:13,210
but it is possible that larger,
more comprehensive sacrifices might 

192
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:17,771
solve an array of large and complex 
problems all at the same time.

193
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:24,900
That's harder,
but it might be better adapting to the 

194
00:15:24,901 --> 00:15:27,720
necessary discipline of medical school 
will,

195
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:32,750
for example,
fatally interfere with a licentious 

196
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,650
lifestyle of a hardcore undergraduate 
party animal.

197
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:40,490
Giving that up is a sacrifice,
but a physician can quote George W 

198
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:46,850
really put food on his family that's a 
lot of trouble dispensed with over a 

199
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:50,060
very long period of time,

200
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,040
so sacrifices are necessary to improve 
the future and larger sacrifices can be 

201
00:15:57,341 --> 00:16:00,930
better.
Second question,

202
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,660
set of related questions.
Really,

203
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:09,140
we've already established the basic 
principle sacrifice will improve the 

204
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:13,941
future,
but a principal once established has to 

205
00:16:13,981 --> 00:16:18,981
be fleshed out.
It's full extension or significance has 

206
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:23,481
to be understood.
What is implied by the idea that 

207
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:28,071
sacrifice will improve the future in the
most extreme and final of cases,

208
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,890
where does that basic principle find its
limits?

209
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:37,410
We must ask to begin what would be the 
largest,

210
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:42,470
most effective,
most pleasing of all possible 

211
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,450
sacrifices,
and then how good mike the best possible

212
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:49,710
future be.
If the most effective sacrifice could be

213
00:16:49,711 --> 00:16:54,711
made.
The Biblical story of Cain and Abel,

214
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,040
Adam and Eve sons immediately follows 
the story of the expulsion from 

215
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,580
paradise.
As mentioned previously,

216
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:07,330
Cain and Abel are really the first 
humans since their parents were made 

217
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,830
directly by God and not born in the 
standard manner.

218
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:14,300
Cain and Abel live in history,
not in Eden.

219
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:19,960
They must work.
They must make sacrifices to please God 

220
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,850
and they do so with alter and proper 
ritual,

221
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,560
but things get complicated.
Ables offerings pleased God,

222
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,970
but canes do not able is rewarded many 
times over,

223
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,070
but Kane is not.
It's not precisely clear why,

224
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:42,120
although the tech strongly hints that 
Keynes Heart is just not in it.

225
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,680
Maybe the quality of what came put 
forward was low.

226
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,800
Maybe his spirit was begrudging or maybe
God was vexed for some secret reasons of

227
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:55,350
his own,
and all of this is realistic,

228
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,160
including the texts,
vagueness of explanation.

229
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:03,900
Not all sacrifices are of equal quality.
Furthermore,

230
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,960
it often appears that sacrifices of 
apparently high quality or not rewarded 

231
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,940
with a better future and it's not clear 
why,

232
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:17,990
why isn't God happy?
What would have to change to make him 

233
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:22,941
so?
Those are difficult questions and 

234
00:18:22,941 --> 00:18:27,480
everyone asks them all the time,
even if they don't notice.

235
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,590
Asking such questions is 
indistinguishable from thinking.

236
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,960
The realization that pleasure could be 
usefully forestalled dawned on us with 

237
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,701
great difficulty.
It runs absolutely contrary to our 

238
00:18:43,701 --> 00:18:47,061
ancient fundamental animal instincts 
which demand immediate satisfaction,

239
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,220
particularly under conditions of 
deprivation,

240
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,770
which are both inevitable and common 
place,

241
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:58,610
and to complicate the matter,
such delay only becomes useful when 

242
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:02,490
civilization has stabilized itself 
enough to guarantee the existence of the

243
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:07,491
delayed reward in the future.
If everything you save will be destroyed

244
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,260
or worse,
stolen,

245
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:15,470
there's no point in saving.
It is for this reason that a wolf will 

246
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,390
down 20 pounds of raw meat in a single 
meal.

247
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:20,790
He isn't thinking,
man,

248
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:25,791
I hate it when I binge.
I should save some of this for next 

249
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:29,570
week,
so how was it that those two impossible 

250
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,391
and necessarily simultaneous ad call,
months delay and the stabilization of 

251
00:19:32,391 --> 00:19:36,720
society into the future could possibly 
have manifested themselves?

252
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,610
Here is a developmental progression from
animal to human.

253
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:44,850
It's wrong,
no doubt in the details,

254
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:50,450
but it's sufficiently correct for our 
purposes in theme first,

255
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,730
there's excess food,
large carcasses.

256
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:57,600
Mammoths are other massive herbivores 
might provide that.

257
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,080
We a lot of Mammas,
maybe all of the with a large animal.

258
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:08,300
There's some left for later after a kill
that's accidental at first,

259
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:14,300
but eventually the utility of for later 
starts to be appreciated.

260
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:19,200
Some provisional notion of sacrifice 
develops at the same time.

261
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,550
If I leave some,
even if I wanted now,

262
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I won't have to be hungry later.
That provisional notion develops to the 

263
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:32,970
next level.
If I leave some for later,

264
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:38,570
I won't have to go hungry and neither 
will those I care for and then to the 

265
00:20:38,611 --> 00:20:43,611
next.
I can't possibly eat all of this 

266
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:46,641
mammoth,
but I can't store the rest for too long 

267
00:20:46,641 --> 00:20:48,340
either.
Maybe I should feed to other people,

268
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:54,450
maybe they'll remember and feed me some 
of their mammoth when they have some and

269
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:59,621
I have none.
Then I'll get some mammoth now and some 

270
00:20:59,621 --> 00:21:04,591
mammoth later.
That's a good deal and maybe those I'm 

271
00:21:04,591 --> 00:21:07,960
sharing with will come to trust me more 
generally.

272
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,660
Maybe then we could trade forever in 
such a manner.

273
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,590
Mammoth becomes future,
mammoth and future.

274
00:21:17,591 --> 00:21:22,591
Mammoth becomes personal reputation that
the emergence of the social contract to 

275
00:21:25,321 --> 00:21:30,321
share does not mean to give away 
something you value and get nothing 

276
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:34,071
back.
That is instead only what every child 

277
00:21:34,071 --> 00:21:37,641
who refuses to share fears.
It means to share means properly to 

278
00:21:40,081 --> 00:21:42,210
initiate the process of trade.

279
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,200
A child who can't share,
who can't trade,

280
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,430
can't have any friends because having 
friends is a form of trade.

281
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:56,030
Benjamin Franklin once suggested that a 
newcomer to a neighborhood ask a new 

282
00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:00,480
neighbor to do him or her a favor citing
this old maxim.

283
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:06,860
He that is once done,
you a kindness will be more ready to do 

284
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:10,641
you another.
Then he whom you yourself have obliged 

285
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:15,980
in Franklin's opinion,
asking someone for something not too 

286
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:19,701
extreme,
obviously was the most useful and 

287
00:22:19,701 --> 00:22:21,900
immediate invitation to social 
interaction and trade,

288
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,480
such asking on the part of the newcomer 
provided the neighbor with an 

289
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,871
opportunity to show him or herself as a 
good person at first encounter.

290
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,440
It also meant that the ladder could now 
ask the former for a favor in return 

291
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:43,270
because of the debt incurred,
increasing their mutual familiarity and 

292
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:47,681
trust in that manner,
both parties could overcome their 

293
00:22:47,681 --> 00:22:50,930
natural hesitancy and mutual fear of the
stranger.

294
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,190
It is better to have something than 
nothing.

295
00:22:56,030 --> 00:23:00,290
It's better yet to share generously this
something you have.

296
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,440
It's even better than that.
However,

297
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,620
to become widely known for generous 
sharing.

298
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,490
That's something that lasts,
that something that's reliable,

299
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:18,600
and at this point of abstraction we can 
observe how the ground work for the 

300
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,960
conceptions,
reliable,

301
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:25,020
honest and generous have been laid.
The basis for an articulated morality 

302
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:29,890
has been put in place.
The productive,

303
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:35,040
truthful sharer is the prototype for the
good citizen and the good man we can see

304
00:23:37,631 --> 00:23:42,580
in this manner how from the simple 
notion that leftovers are a good idea,

305
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,800
the highest moral principles might 
emerge.

306
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:52,620
It's as if something like the following 
happened as humanity developed first 

307
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:58,620
where the endless tens or hundreds of 
thousands of years prior to the 

308
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:02,521
emergence of written history and drama.
During this time,

309
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:07,620
the twin practices of delay and exchange
begin to emerge slowly and painfully.

310
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:15,750
Then they become represented in 
metaphorical abstraction as rituals and 

311
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:20,521
tales of sacrifice told in a manner such
as this.

312
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:26,790
It's as if there's a powerful figure in 
the sky who sees all and is judging you,

313
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:33,160
giving up something you value,
seems to make them happy and you want to

314
00:24:33,161 --> 00:24:36,670
make them happy because all hell breaks 
loose if you don't.

315
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:42,510
So practice sacrificing and sharing 
until you become an expert at it and 

316
00:24:44,561 --> 00:24:45,970
things will go well for you.

317
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:52,120
No one said any of this,
at least not so plainly and directly,

318
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:57,420
but it was implicit in the practice.
And then in the stories auction came 

319
00:24:58,301 --> 00:25:00,300
first.
Has it had to,

320
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,590
as the animals we once were,
could act,

321
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,620
but could not think.
Implicit,

322
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,680
unrecognized value came first as the 
actions that proceeded thought embodied 

323
00:25:12,041 --> 00:25:15,160
value,
but did not make that value explicit.

324
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:21,630
People watched the success will succeed 
and the unsuccessful fail for thousands 

325
00:25:22,241 --> 00:25:26,260
and thousands of years.
We thought it over a drew,

326
00:25:26,261 --> 00:25:31,261
a conclusion.
The successful among us delay 

327
00:25:31,261 --> 00:25:34,540
gratification,
the successful among us bargain with the

328
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:38,680
future.
A great idea begins to emerge.

329
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,800
Taking evermore clearly articulated form
in evermore clearly articulated stories.

330
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:49,240
What's the difference between the 
successful and the unsuccessful?

331
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:55,030
The successful sacrifice things get 
better as the successful practice,

332
00:25:55,721 --> 00:26:00,721
their sacrifices,
the questions become increasingly 

333
00:26:00,721 --> 00:26:04,711
precise and Cymbalta caneously broader.
What is the greatest possible sacrifice 

334
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:12,750
for the greatest possible good,
and the answers become increasingly 

335
00:26:13,001 --> 00:26:18,001
deeper and profound.
The God of western tradition like so 

336
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:23,791
many gods requires sacrifice.
We've already examined why,

337
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:30,210
but sometimes he goes even further.
He demands not only sacrifice,

338
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:34,780
but the sacrifice of precisely what is 
loved best.

339
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:41,200
This is most starkly portrayed,
most confusingly evident in the story of

340
00:26:41,201 --> 00:26:44,460
Abraham and Isaac.
Abraham,

341
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:49,520
beloved of God long wanted to Sun and 
God promised them exactly that after 

342
00:26:50,671 --> 00:26:55,671
many delays and under the apparently 
impossible conditions of old age and the

343
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:57,510
long barren wife,

344
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:02,100
but not so long afterward when the 
miraculous we born,

345
00:27:02,101 --> 00:27:06,480
Isaac is still a child.
God turns around and an unreasonable and

346
00:27:06,481 --> 00:27:11,481
apparently barbaric fashion demands that
his faithful servant offer his son as a 

347
00:27:12,361 --> 00:27:15,780
sacrifice.
The story ends happily.

348
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,960
God sends an angel to stay Abraham's 
obedient hand and accepts a ram in Isaac

349
00:27:22,301 --> 00:27:25,580
stead.
That's a good thing,

350
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,520
but it doesn't really address the issue 
at hand.

351
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,480
Why is God's going further necessary?
Why does he?

352
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:40,150
Why does life impose such demands?
We'll start our analysis with a truism 

353
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:49,500
stark self evident and understated.
Sometimes things do not go well.

354
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:58,560
That seems to have much to do with the 
terrible nature of the world with its 

355
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,730
plagues and famines and tyrannies and be
trails.

356
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:07,090
But here's the rub.
Sometimes when things are not going 

357
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:07,520
well,
it's not the world that's the cause.

358
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:13,360
The cause is instead that which is 
currently most valued subjectively and 

359
00:28:14,441 --> 00:28:17,180
personally.
Why?

360
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:23,670
Because the world is revealed to an 
indeterminate degree through the 

361
00:28:23,981 --> 00:28:27,800
template of your values.
Thus,

362
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:31,370
if the world you are seeing is not the 
world you want,

363
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
it's time to examine your values.
It's time to rid yourself of your 

364
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,120
current presuppositions.

365
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:44,570
It's time to let go.
It might even be time to sacrifice what 

366
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:49,491
you love best so that you can become who
you might become instead of staying who 

367
00:28:50,071 --> 00:28:55,071
you are.
There's an old and possibly apocryphal 

368
00:28:55,071 --> 00:28:59,730
story about how to catch a monkey that 
illustrates this set of ideas very well.

369
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:05,540
First,
you must find a large narrow neck jar 

370
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:09,470
just barely wide enough in diameter at 
the top for a monkey to put his hand 

371
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:13,911
inside.
Then you must fill the jar parkway with 

372
00:29:13,911 --> 00:29:16,530
rocks so it is too heavy for a monkey to
carry.

373
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:22,280
Then you must scatter some treats 
attractive to monkeys near the jar to 

374
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,850
attract one and put some more inside the
jar.

375
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:30,070
A monkey will come along,
reach into the narrow opening and grab 

376
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:34,690
while the grabbing is good,
but now we won't be able to extract his 

377
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:38,681
fist now full of treats from the jar,
not without unclenching his hand,

378
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:43,480
not without relinquishing what he 
already has,

379
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:48,850
and that's just what he won't do.
The monkey capture can then walk over to

380
00:29:48,851 --> 00:29:53,851
the jar and pick up the monkey.
The animal will not sacrifice the part 

381
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:59,550
to preserve the whole something valuable
given up ensures future prosperity,

382
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:07,840
something valuable sacrificed,
pleases the Lord.

383
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:13,590
What is most valuable and best 
sacrificed,

384
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,420
or what is it least emblematic of that 
choice cut of meat,

385
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,230
the best animal in a flock,
our most valued possession.

386
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:29,370
What's above even that something 
intensely personal and painful to give 

387
00:30:30,401 --> 00:30:35,401
up that symbolized perhaps in God's 
insistence on circumcision as part of 

388
00:30:36,491 --> 00:30:41,491
Abraham sacrificial routine where the 
part is offered symbolically to redeem 

389
00:30:42,581 --> 00:30:46,400
the whole.
What's beyond that?

390
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,900
What pertains more closely to the whole 
person rather than to the part

391
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:57,490
what constitutes the ultimate sacrifice 
for the gain of the ultimate prize?

392
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:01,880
It's a close race between child and 
self.

393
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:07,890
The sacrifice of the mother offering her
child to the world is exemplified 

394
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:10,190
profoundly by Michelangelo's great 
sculpture.

395
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:15,250
The Pieta,
Michelangelo Crafted Mary cradling the 

396
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:19,400
nearly naked body of her adult son 
crucified and ruined.

397
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,000
It's her fault.
It was through her that he entered the 

398
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,661
world and it's great drama of being.
Is it right to bring a baby into this 

399
00:31:30,111 --> 00:31:35,111
terrible world?
Every woman asks herself that question.

400
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,810
Some say no,
and they have their reasons.

401
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,090
Mary answers,
yes,

402
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:46,150
voluntarily knowing full well what's to 
come as do all mothers if they allow 

403
00:31:47,031 --> 00:31:52,031
themselves to see it's an act of supreme
courage when it's undertaken 

404
00:31:52,581 --> 00:31:53,540
voluntarily.

405
00:31:55,150 --> 00:32:00,150
In turn,
Mary's son Christ offers himself to God 

406
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:04,201
and the world to be trail torture and 
death to the very point of despair on 

407
00:32:05,471 --> 00:32:10,471
the cross where he cries out those 
terrible words from Matthew Twenty 

408
00:32:10,571 --> 00:32:12,190
seven,
46,

409
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,100
my God,
my God,

410
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:20,790
why Hast Thou forsaken me?
That is the archetypal story of the man 

411
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,690
who gives his all for the sake of the 
better.

412
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,080
Who offers up his life for the 
advancement of being who allows God's 

413
00:32:31,301 --> 00:32:36,301
will to become manifest fully within the
confines of a single mortal life?

414
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:43,620
That is the model for the honorable man 
in Christ case.

415
00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:46,730
However,
as he sacrifices himself,

416
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:49,370
God,
his father is similar,

417
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:54,910
sacrificing his son.
It is for this reason that the Christian

418
00:32:55,231 --> 00:33:00,231
sacrificial drama of Sun and self is 
archetypal story at the limit where 

419
00:33:02,801 --> 00:33:06,890
nothing more extreme,
nothing greater can be imagined.

420
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:12,730
That's the very definition of archetypal
and that's the core of what constitutes 

421
00:33:13,801 --> 00:33:17,420
a religious pain and suffering.

422
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,560
Define the world of that.
There can be no doubt.

423
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:27,430
Sacrifice can hold pain and suffering in
abeyance to a greater or lesser degree 

424
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:33,520
and greater sacrifices can do that more 
effectively than lesser of that.

425
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:39,340
There can be no doubt.
Everyone holds this knowledge in their 

426
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,670
souls.
Thus,

427
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:43,190
the person who wishes to alleviate 
suffering,

428
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:48,640
who wishes to rectify the flaws and Ba,
who wants to bring about the best of all

429
00:33:49,071 --> 00:33:53,840
possible futures,
who wants to create heaven on earth will

430
00:33:53,841 --> 00:33:57,650
make the greatest of sacrifices of self,
end of child,

431
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:02,800
of everything that is loved to live a 
life aimed at the good he will forego 

432
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:08,801
expediency,
he will pursue the path of ultimate 

433
00:34:08,801 --> 00:34:12,731
meaning and he will in that manner bring
salvation to the ever desperate world.

434
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:21,400
Part four from my blog on the Ark of the
covenant,

435
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:25,520
the Cathedral and the Cross Easter 
message,

436
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:30,521
one abridged from wikipedia.
The Ark of the covenant was elicited.

437
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:38,310
Gold leafed wouldn't chest containing 
the two stone tablets of the Ten 

438
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:42,991
Commandments.
According to various texts within the 

439
00:34:42,991 --> 00:34:46,170
Hebrew Bible,
it also contained Aaron's Rod and a part

440
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:51,171
of Manna.
God was said to have spoken with Moses 

441
00:34:51,171 --> 00:34:53,770
from between the two Cherubim on the 
arcs cover,

442
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,520
the biblical account states that the 
arch was created a year after the 

443
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,670
Israelite exodus from Egypt according to
a pattern given to Moses by God at the 

444
00:35:05,331 --> 00:35:09,200
foot of Mount Sinai.
Thereafter,

445
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:14,320
the gold plated acacia chest was carried
by it staves while en route by the Levi.

446
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:20,250
It's in advance of the people went on 
the march towards the promised land or 

447
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:24,290
at the head of the Israelite army in 
transport.

448
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:29,270
The arc was concealed under a large veil
made of skins and blue cloth,

449
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:34,840
carefully hidden even from the eyes of 
the priests and the Levi who carried it 

450
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:37,220
when at rest,
a portable building,

451
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:42,260
the tabernacle,
meaning residents or dwelling place was 

452
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:46,281
set up to how's the arc.
It was built of woven layers of curtains

453
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:51,530
along with 48 boards clad with polished 
gold standing like vertical blinds.

454
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,800
Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem superseded
it as the dwelling place of God.

455
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,960
Some 300 years later commentary.
There has to be a bridge between the 

456
00:36:05,851 --> 00:36:10,851
finite and the infinite.
There has to be a place where the 

457
00:36:10,851 --> 00:36:15,141
ephemeral meets the eternal.
There has to be a bridge between the 

458
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:20,541
knowable and the unknowable and there 
has to be bedrock at the foundation.

459
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,950
The arc,
which is the portal to God,

460
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:32,160
is to be carried on the shoulders of 
those who are holding it is not to be 

461
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,560
touched.
To touch the ark is to risk death.

462
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:40,910
There are holy things that cannot be 
touched except at mortal risk.

463
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:46,670
Those things that cannot be touched or 
at the very foundation of the community,

464
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,430
the art must be placed at the center of 
the temple.

465
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:56,230
The temple must be placed at the center 
of the community.

466
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:02,030
The community must be arranged around 
what is untouchable and unshakeable.

467
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:06,950
The untouchable and unshakeable is what 
is axiomatic.

468
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,560
The people following the arc have 
determined to journey together toward 

469
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:18,251
the eternal promised land.
The city arranged properly around the 

470
00:37:18,711 --> 00:37:21,950
Ark of the covenant is eternal.
Jerusalem,

471
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:26,570
something must be axiomatic or 
everything.

472
00:37:26,571 --> 00:37:31,571
Shakes and falls.
The axiomatic to not be expressed fully 

473
00:37:31,731 --> 00:37:35,390
in words.
Instead the axiomatic,

474
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:40,480
untouchable and unshakeable is what 
makes communication in words possible.

475
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,410
The axiomatic is a spirit,
a process,

476
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,620
a living force,
its manifestations.

477
00:37:48,621 --> 00:37:50,210
However,
our concrete,

478
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:54,260
that is the transformation of the spirit
into matter.

479
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,490
That is the generation of the tablets of
stone.

480
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:05,550
The Ark of the covenant contains the 
rules that are derived in the first 

481
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,820
order from the axiomatic principle.

482
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:12,250
That principle is the spirit that made 
the rules manifest.

483
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:16,660
That spirit is the ultimate inhabitant 
of the arch and the rules,

484
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,550
the result of its action.
That spirit is the creative logos,

485
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:27,390
the Ark of the covenant and the Temple 
are replaced by the Cathedral at the 

486
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:32,101
center of the community.
The cathedral is the cross in 

487
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:36,211
architectural form.
The Cross is where the transformation 

488
00:38:36,211 --> 00:38:40,290
takes place.
The transformation is the incorporation 

489
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:44,131
of the body of Christ.
That incorporation is a dramatic ritual,

490
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:49,090
is the embodiment of the decision not to
believe in Christ,

491
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:54,330
but to act him out,
which is to believe in a much deeper 

492
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:58,501
manner than to merely believe Christ is 
he who transcends death.

493
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,920
By voluntarily accepting death,
Christ is he who rejects the kingdoms of

494
00:39:05,741 --> 00:39:08,290
this world.
For the Kingdom of God.

495
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:13,770
Christ is he who speaks the truth that 
creates the habitable order that is 

496
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:18,601
good,
from the chaos of potential that exists 

497
00:39:18,601 --> 00:39:22,410
prior to the materialization of reality.
Christ is he who wields potential as the

498
00:39:24,551 --> 00:39:29,440
sword that cleaves death.
Christ is he who's radical,

499
00:39:29,441 --> 00:39:33,670
acceptance of the conditions of life,
defeats the hatred,

500
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:38,730
bitterness and vengefulness that the 
tragedy and malevolence that taints 

501
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:40,390
being otherwise produces

502
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,880
without the acceptance of death,
bitterness,

503
00:39:44,881 --> 00:39:47,210
rules,
and hell triumphs.

504
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:51,720
Christ is the potential of men and 
woman.

505
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:56,850
It is said that men and women alike are 
made in the image of God and that God is

506
00:39:56,851 --> 00:40:01,851
he who uses the eternal logos to 
generate habitable order from the chaos 

507
00:40:01,851 --> 00:40:04,680
of potential.
This is the axiom.

508
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:07,830
This is the diamond at the center of the
world.

509
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:11,430
This is the spirit in the arch that is 
untouchable.

510
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:17,300
This is the bedrock of the culture that 
brings peace and prosperity and that 

511
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,250
respects the dignity of man.
This is the great truth.

512
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:26,120
This is the responsibility who's 
acceptance allows each of us to live 

513
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,890
despite the catastrophic fragility of 
our limited being.

514
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:34,940
Our likeness to God gives each of us a 
value that transcends the finite 

515
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:40,650
individual and society of like are 
charged with the ethical demand to 

516
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:44,451
respect that value.
This is not only the presumption that 

517
00:40:44,451 --> 00:40:48,411
grounds the idea of the rights of man.
It is the presumption that lays upon 

518
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:53,570
each of us the ultimate responsibility 
that is the inevitable corollary of 

519
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:58,050
those rights.
Face the chaos of the future.

520
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:03,860
Employ the logos of which you are a part
to transform that chaos into habitable 

521
00:41:04,801 --> 00:41:08,310
order that is good.
Speak the truth,

522
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,990
embodied the truth

523
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:16,240
except impossibly the limitations that 
make being possible dispense in that 

524
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:20,210
manner with resentment,
hatred,

525
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:25,270
and the desire for infinite and 
unbounded vengeance and all the cruelty 

526
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:29,651
and evil that accompanies it.
Pick up the cross of your tragedy and 

527
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:32,090
betrayal,
except it's terrible.

528
00:41:32,091 --> 00:41:33,920
Wait,
hoisted

529
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:39,130
onto your shoulders and struggle 
impossibly upward toward the Kingdom of 

530
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:44,770
God on the hill.
The alternative is death and hell.

531
00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:50,850
Part Five.
The psychological meaning of the death 

532
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:54,931
and resurrection of Christ.
Easter message to this is a somewhat 

533
00:41:56,411 --> 00:42:01,411
extended,
an altered version of a commentary that 

534
00:42:01,411 --> 00:42:02,350
I wrote for the London Sunday Times 
magazine.

535
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,900
In the beginning only the king was 
sovereign.

536
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:14,540
Then the nobles became sovereign.
Then with the Greeks,

537
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:19,720
all men became sovereign.
Then came the Christian revolution,

538
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:23,230
and every individual male,
female,

539
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,170
beggar,
men,

540
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:29,380
tax collector,
prostitute and thief became so 

541
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,761
impossibly equally sovereign.
Then our cultural and legal systems 

542
00:42:34,161 --> 00:42:39,161
wrapped themselves tightly around that 
ultimately unlikely narrative of 

543
00:42:39,161 --> 00:42:43,061
individual sovereignty and made it their
central unshakable pillar.

544
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,230
Now we all give each other the respect 
of individual citizens who are sovereign

545
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:52,450
without remembering or noticing that we 
are assembled,

546
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:58,070
accepting the proposition that every 
single one of us is a divine center of 

547
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:02,841
logos at the center of the eternal word 
that brings habitable order into being 

548
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:09,440
through the voluntary truthful 
confrontation with chaos and the 

549
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,041
unknown,
and if any one of us has not treated in 

550
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:14,070
this manner.
If anyone,

551
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:16,770
no matter how powerful reacts to any of 
us,

552
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:21,890
no matter how downtrodden,
as if our freewill is illusory or our 

553
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,580
role in choosing the outcomes of our 
lives,

554
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:28,590
nonexistent.
Then we get offended and angry and 

555
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:32,031
agitated and insulted and rightly so,
are spectacularly and miraculously 

556
00:43:33,601 --> 00:43:38,601
functional.
Western legal systems are predicated on 

557
00:43:38,601 --> 00:43:41,661
the acceptance of the intrinsic value of
the individual predicated on the idea 

558
00:43:41,671 --> 00:43:46,671
that each person can step forward,
voluntarily accept the burden of being 

559
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:51,740
transformed positively in consequence,
and share the results of that 

560
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:55,881
transformation with everyone else.
It is in that manner that each of us 

561
00:43:55,881 --> 00:44:00,411
pushes everything away from the abyss 
and a bit more heavenward is the 

562
00:44:01,231 --> 00:44:05,520
apparent necessity for such insanely 
high regard an illusion.

563
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:12,240
It is certain that it is at least 
functional and therefore not so 

564
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:16,261
obviously illusory.
It is also equally certain that we have 

565
00:44:16,261 --> 00:44:19,450
not outlined any more viable,
materialistic alternative

566
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:25,940
you might well ask is the hypothesis of 
intrinsic human value justified is our 

567
00:44:27,391 --> 00:44:32,391
apparent ability to face the as of yet 
unmanifest future and decide on the 

568
00:44:32,391 --> 00:44:34,470
nature of its realization in the 
present,

569
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:39,620
genuine and real?
Is it true despite the 

570
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:43,880
incomprehensibility that we are free 
conscious beings and that our conscious 

571
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,620
freedom plays a role in constructing the
cosmos?

572
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,760
It could merely be as the cynics and 
reductionists hold that consciousness is

573
00:44:52,921 --> 00:44:57,921
an Epi phenomenon of materialistic 
processes that there is no free will or 

574
00:44:58,141 --> 00:45:03,141
at least none of any genuine import,
that there is no accompanying moral 

575
00:45:03,141 --> 00:45:07,191
responsibility or freely chosen destiny.
There are however valid and not so 

576
00:45:08,971 --> 00:45:13,971
simply dispensed with reasons to avoid 
too premature and casual acceptance of 

577
00:45:14,431 --> 00:45:19,431
such conclusions.
Even the greatest of us do not 

578
00:45:19,431 --> 00:45:23,031
understand consciousness,
not a bit much less comprehend the role 

579
00:45:23,031 --> 00:45:26,670
it plays in being.
We have no idea currently,

580
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:32,030
seriously no idea how the material 
substrate of the brain produces the 

581
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:36,561
awareness and more the self awareness 
that seems so vital to the existence of 

582
00:45:37,231 --> 00:45:38,100
the cosmos.

583
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,510
If there is no center of experience to 
experience something,

584
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:46,080
anything,
then it is very difficult to say in what

585
00:45:46,081 --> 00:45:49,380
manner that's something or anything 
exists.

586
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:55,280
Reality requires an observer and as far 
as we can tell that observer is 

587
00:45:55,891 --> 00:45:59,850
consciousness.
Even more so self consciousness,

588
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:06,080
our awareness or self awareness appears 
to confront the unformed potential of 

589
00:46:06,301 --> 00:46:10,050
the future and to cast it into the 
concrete reality of the present.

590
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:15,740
Our consciousness acts on possibility 
like the logos of the father acted on 

591
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:18,720
the pre cosmogony chaos at the beginning
of time.

592
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:24,620
It is in that manner that we are made in
the image of God and we all demand to be

593
00:46:24,661 --> 00:46:29,661
treated as if that were true and who 
would dare to deny that such a demand is

594
00:46:30,061 --> 00:46:33,960
made for valid and perhaps even 
ultimately valid reasons.

595
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:40,430
Consider the evidence from our actions 
when you treat yourself as if you matter

596
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:42,240
than you thrive.

597
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:47,690
When you treat those around you as if 
they are inhabited by a spark of 

598
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:50,961
divinity,
then your relationships stabilize and 

599
00:46:50,961 --> 00:46:54,471
grow simultaneously.
When we produce societies predicated on 

600
00:46:55,051 --> 00:47:00,051
the great idea of the inherent value of 
each individual from st to criminal than

601
00:47:01,501 --> 00:47:06,501
men become free and productive and 
capable of living the meaningful lives 

602
00:47:06,501 --> 00:47:11,421
that lended dignity to the tragedy of 
their limited existences and when we 

603
00:47:11,881 --> 00:47:15,210
fail to do so than our society's 
degenerate,

604
00:47:15,211 --> 00:47:20,211
into the tyrannical and murderous tribal
structures that seem to exist as the 

605
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:25,371
only certainly manifest alternative is 
this not all indicative of the existence

606
00:47:26,221 --> 00:47:31,221
of some profound truth.
Obviously we are constrained and 

607
00:47:31,681 --> 00:47:35,370
severely so by the manner of our 
corporeal being.

608
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:41,020
We're subject to deterministic rules in 
a seriously profound manner.

609
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:47,100
We do not have the power to shape things
in any old way whatsoever at any time or

610
00:47:47,471 --> 00:47:52,471
place,
but we can certainly and demonstrably 

611
00:47:52,471 --> 00:47:55,860
and apparently willfully advance in the 
direction of our imagination and in 

612
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:57,940
quite a staggering and compelling 
manner.

613
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:02,200
Is this not indicative of who we 
genuinely are?

614
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:08,080
Is this not as perhaps the primal 
existential truth?

615
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:14,870
We are in danger in the west of 
abandoning our culture of leaving our 

616
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:18,300
great foundational stories to die on the
altar of our inquisitiveness,

617
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:23,360
cynicism,
carelessness of degenerating into 

618
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:26,931
nihilism or returning in a reactionary 
manner to an archaic and destructive 

619
00:48:26,931 --> 00:48:31,911
tribalism of the right or the left.
It matters not these twin dread paths 

620
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:38,600
will not lead us to where we would want 
to be if we decided to be conscious and 

621
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:38,700
careful.

622
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:43,880
Such abandonment will weaken us fatally 
as individuals.

623
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:49,210
It will lay us open to possession by all
manner of demonic conceptual 

624
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:53,231
alternatives.
It will make us vulnerable to our 

625
00:48:53,231 --> 00:48:53,300
enemies within and without.

626
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:59,290
It is psychologically true that each of 
us should open ourselves up to the 

627
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:03,071
tragedy of being.
It is psychologically true that we 

628
00:49:03,071 --> 00:49:05,150
should pick up our tragic burdens and 
crosses,

629
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:09,080
die continually and renew our souls 
continually.

630
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:13,070
It may be more than psychologically true
as well.

631
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:16,040
It may be a truth of cosmic 
significance.

632
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:22,060
That is the death and resurrection 
celebrated by Easter and it is time for 

633
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:26,951
us to wake up,
become conscious and recognize it as 

634
00:49:26,951 --> 00:49:28,880
such.
It is not possible to encapsulate within

635
00:49:28,881 --> 00:49:33,881
any finite written account the total 
import of the idea of Christ's death and

636
00:49:33,921 --> 00:49:38,921
rebirth,
the impossible claim of the bodily 

637
00:49:38,921 --> 00:49:42,221
resurrection of one man conjoined with 
the notion that this event was both of 

638
00:49:42,221 --> 00:49:46,370
world redeeming and cosmic significance 
simply cannot be understood once and for

639
00:49:46,371 --> 00:49:49,760
all within any singular frame of 
interpretation,

640
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:54,200
even for die hard atheists have the 
scientific type.

641
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:58,940
Think Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris.
A great mystery remains.

642
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:04,420
Why has this strange and thoroughly 
implausible story exercise such immense 

643
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:09,580
impact?
It is because each life is a tragedy 

644
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:13,330
tainted by malevolence.
It is because life is suffering as we 

645
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:17,141
all are.
Each of us vulnerable and ignorant made 

646
00:50:17,141 --> 00:50:20,360
all too frequently bitter,
resentful and angry because of just that

647
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:24,020
and more than willing to make things 
worse in that anger,

648
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:29,390
but we all admire courage and the 
willingness to abide by the truth.

649
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:32,420
No matter how terrible in the face of 
that suffering,

650
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,330
we all recognize in such courage and 
truth,

651
00:50:35,331 --> 00:50:40,070
at least by our admiration of it,
an antidote to the catastrophe of life.

652
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:44,030
We all know that in the absence of such 
courage and truth,

653
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:48,950
mirror catastrophe degenerates all too 
frequently into hell.

654
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:54,460
Imagine that acceptance of vulnerability
in ignorance is the precondition for 

655
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:58,631
growth.
Imagine that confrontation with the 

656
00:50:58,631 --> 00:51:02,291
terrible unknown with it's paralyzing 
manifestations of tragedy and 

657
00:51:02,291 --> 00:51:06,170
malevolence is necessary to catalyze 
both wisdom and maturity.

658
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:12,160
Imagine finally that human consciousness
plays some central and as of yet poorly 

659
00:51:12,351 --> 00:51:15,080
understood role in the reality of the 
cosmos,

660
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:17,480
at least as necessary.
Observer.

661
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:22,400
Imagine all of that.
Then ask yourself,

662
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,880
what is the absolute hypothetical limit 
of human attainment with vulnerability 

663
00:51:28,071 --> 00:51:30,650
and ignorance are fully and completely 
accepted.

664
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:34,880
When the unknown is squarely confronted 
and when consciousness is given,

665
00:51:34,881 --> 00:51:37,640
it's due as the very center of the 
world.

666
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:41,180
That's Christ's acceptance of the 
crucifix.

667
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:46,870
That's his willingness to be betrayed,
subject to the evil of his closest 

668
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:50,570
companions and the state and his embrace
of brokenness and death.

669
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:56,650
It is pure truth that even a small 
leaving of humility and courage in 

670
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:57,530
genders,
resilience,

671
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:00,920
progress and growth,
it is pure truth.

672
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:06,100
That resentful rejection of the price of
finite being multiplies suffering 

673
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,450
endlessly and unnecessarily.

674
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:14,110
What is the ultimate expression of those
truths taken to their final conclusion?

675
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:19,740
Who is to say who we are and what we 
might be capable of achieving if we 

676
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,180
develop the courage to accept our 
terrible fates,

677
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:27,270
live in truth and stumble uphill?
This is the question posed by 

678
00:52:27,731 --> 00:52:32,731
Christianity and its very essence would 
you put everything you have and 

679
00:52:32,731 --> 00:52:37,381
everything you are on the line so that 
you could learn to conduct yourself in 

680
00:52:37,381 --> 00:52:41,521
the best possible manner?
Would you be willing to allow who you 

681
00:52:41,521 --> 00:52:45,931
might be to continually and painfully 
triumph over who you currently are in 

682
00:52:47,441 --> 00:52:52,441
the most ancient religious language?
Would you sacrifice what you love most 

683
00:52:52,541 --> 00:52:57,541
to God to find out who and what you are?
We are in the final analysis,

684
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:05,110
neither structured nor chaos.
Each of us is instead best understood as

685
00:53:05,111 --> 00:53:08,650
a process,
as a living dynamic process,

686
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:11,740
as the very process by which what we 
know,

687
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:16,630
what we know so insufficiently is 
transformed into what could yet be.

688
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:20,950
That is the process by which our 
continued forward.

689
00:53:20,951 --> 00:53:25,060
Movement through life is constantly and 
inevitably dependent.

690
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:30,330
To understand that and to welcome it.
That is voluntary.

691
00:53:30,331 --> 00:53:35,331
Acceptance of the necessity of eternal 
transformation as an alternative to 

692
00:53:35,401 --> 00:53:40,401
nihilistic despair or desperate and 
fatal identification with the state.

693
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,930
This is the idea enacted during the 
ceremony of the Christian Eucharist.

694
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:51,590
Incorporation of the body of Christ is 
the symbolic transformation of the 

695
00:53:51,590 --> 00:53:54,510
participant,
not into a believer of a set of fact,

696
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,940
religious,
though those facts may appear,

697
00:53:57,030 --> 00:54:02,030
but into the act of imitator of Christ 
into the person willing to undergo 

698
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:06,270
whatever death is necessary to bring 
about the next and better state of being

699
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:11,780
into the person,
willing to embrace his or her 

700
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:12,360
confrontation with the tragedy and 
malevolence of life.

701
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:17,630
To learn from that process of embrace 
and to move one step closer in 

702
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:21,450
consequence to the eternally receding 
city of God.

703
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:27,200
The idea of the dying and resurrected 
God is one of the oldest ideas of 

704
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,951
mankind,
widespread and exceptionally variant in 

705
00:54:30,951 --> 00:54:34,191
its forms.
It forms part of the set of 

706
00:54:34,191 --> 00:54:37,071
presuppositions that underlie the most 
ancient shamonic rituals carried over 

707
00:54:37,071 --> 00:54:41,900
perhaps from the stone age itself.
It is echoed in the foundational stories

708
00:54:42,241 --> 00:54:45,390
of ancient Mesopotamia,
Egypt and Greece.

709
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:50,100
It manifests itself in allegorical forms
in the figure of the Phoenix,

710
00:54:50,101 --> 00:54:52,410
for example,
which emulates itself,

711
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:57,330
regains its youthful form and rises in 
triumph from the ashes.

712
00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:01,980
It recurs repeatedly in the tropes of 
popular culture as well,

713
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:07,020
bringing even those entirely devoid of 
religious education under the spell,

714
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:12,360
Marvel's iconic ironman plummets like 
icarus from sky to ground.

715
00:55:12,361 --> 00:55:17,361
After saving the world from demonic 
serpentine other world forces and then 

716
00:55:17,491 --> 00:55:20,580
arises from his death,
the child wizard,

717
00:55:20,581 --> 00:55:25,170
Harry Potter must ultimately die and be 
reborn to defeat voldemort,

718
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:27,630
a very thinly disguised Satan.

719
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:33,650
All of that creative variation on a 
theme speaks of a deep ineradicable and 

720
00:55:34,651 --> 00:55:37,920
eternally re-emergent psychological 
reality.

721
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:44,070
We all see this in our day to day lives 
and we all know it because we see it.

722
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,340
A small failure,
a small disappointment,

723
00:55:47,341 --> 00:55:50,460
frustration or disenchantment and 
genders within us,

724
00:55:50,461 --> 00:55:54,060
a small death,
a small descent into the underworld,

725
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:59,350
a small requirement for rebirth.
A large failure produces a 

726
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:02,520
proportionately large catastrophe and 
transformation.

727
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:07,980
When you are compelled to talk to 
someone because you faced divorce or the

728
00:56:07,981 --> 00:56:12,360
failure of a treasured ambition or the 
illness or death of someone close,

729
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:17,070
you are walking yourself through the 
eternal narrative stability,

730
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:19,140
crisis,
death,

731
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:21,840
transformation,
rebirth.

732
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:24,520
That's the story of our lives.

733
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:28,030
That's the fall and the reestablishment 
of paradise.

734
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:34,140
The idea that the savior is the figure 
who dies and resurrect is a 

735
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:38,251
representation in dramatic or narrative 
form of the brute fact that 

736
00:56:38,251 --> 00:56:43,111
psychological progress,
indeed learning itself requires 

737
00:56:43,111 --> 00:56:46,450
continual death and rebirth of lesser 
and greater magnitude.

738
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:52,500
If you are engaged in this serious 
interpersonal conflict or argument or 

739
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:56,491
facing a true crisis in your life,
the new information confronting you 

740
00:56:56,491 --> 00:57:00,571
cannot be incorporated without the old 
so painful demise of your previous 

741
00:57:00,761 --> 00:57:05,761
conceptions and all of the resistance 
comprehension of that pain necessarily 

742
00:57:06,431 --> 00:57:10,600
entails.
That's part and parcel of the process so

743
00:57:10,601 --> 00:57:15,340
famously described as assimilation and 
accommodation by the great developmental

744
00:57:15,341 --> 00:57:20,170
psychologists jumped piaget,
we each confront the world with a set of

745
00:57:20,171 --> 00:57:25,171
preconceptual patients whose function is
Cymbalta obviously to delimit and render

746
00:57:25,721 --> 00:57:29,020
pragmatic are very perceptions,
thoughts,

747
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:33,400
and actions.
In the absence of this eight priority,

748
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:38,580
we simply cannot function nonetheless.
It is still insufficient.

749
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:44,050
No one ever knows enough and what we 
each do not yet know will at some moment

750
00:57:44,051 --> 00:57:49,051
of crisis become a vital importance when
something new and like confronts us and 

751
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:54,841
shakes us to our core.
What is old and anachronistic within 

752
00:57:54,841 --> 00:57:58,711
must therefore emulate itself and die.
It is very rare indeed to learn 

753
00:57:59,021 --> 00:58:04,021
something profound without suffering the
terrible pain of dashed dreams and the 

754
00:58:04,151 --> 00:58:07,090
soul shaking terror of uncertainty and 
doubt.

755
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:14,190
This means that none of us should 
identify in the most fundamental sense 

756
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:17,110
with what we currently know and presume 
means as well,

757
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:22,200
that we should all come to understand 
that so that we do not remain confused 

758
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:26,191
about who we are.
This means that it is never sufficient 

759
00:58:26,191 --> 00:58:30,301
to be conservative or to identify with 
the past or to become ideologically or 

760
00:58:30,301 --> 00:58:34,960
dogmatically committed or to remain 
stubbornly anachronistic and unchanged.

761
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:40,180
The environment transforms headlong 
around us and we all must run as fast as

762
00:58:40,181 --> 00:58:45,181
we can as Ellis as red queen,
well new just to stay in the same place.

763
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:51,780
It is not sufficient either to abandon 
tradition and structure entirely in a 

764
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:56,341
headlong and irresponsible rush towards 
the anomalous and revolutionary 

765
00:58:57,010 --> 00:59:02,010
structure is insufficient,
but it is still necessary and the 

766
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:05,671
ethical requirement for respecting and 
maintaining it is still a paramount 

767
00:59:05,671 --> 00:59:07,720
import.
We each must as well.

768
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:12,720
Similarly,
avoid falling prey to the temptation of 

769
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,810
identifying with the chaotic,
depressing,

770
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:18,990
anxiety ridden and nihilism inducing 
state of affairs in gendered by the 

771
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:21,890
terrible confrontation with the 
genuinely unknown,

772
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:25,820
even when thrust into the underworld by 
the dread events of our life,

773
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:30,940
we must not characterize ourselves as 
permanent inhabitants of that dark and 

774
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,870
dread place,
lest we lose hope,

775
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:36,980
despair,
and seek revenge to progress.

776
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:42,010
Psychologically,
you must let go sacrifice time and again

777
00:59:42,351 --> 00:59:46,220
in the face of success of obstacles,
you must abandon those things.

778
00:59:46,221 --> 00:59:50,420
That and often those people who are 
impeding your progress,

779
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:55,570
despite the fact that you may have held 
them very close to your heart when 

780
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:57,590
you're wrong,
when you've missed the mark,

781
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:00,110
when you've sinned,
because that is the meaning of sin.

782
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:04,160
You must let the part of you that is 
wrong and aiming improperly die.

783
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:09,910
Then you must allow the new spirit 
manifesting itself within two spring to 

784
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:12,200
life,
that new spirit,

785
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:17,470
that's the terrible information 
contained in whatever error you 

786
01:00:17,470 --> 01:00:21,761
committed in living conjunction with the
now transformed structures you 

787
01:00:21,761 --> 01:00:26,210
originally employed to frame the 
situation that new spirit,

788
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:29,690
it's a manifestation as well,
and in other words,

789
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:34,840
have the potential within you that had 
not yet been called forth by the 

790
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,290
previous travails of your life.

791
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:43,180
Christ is symbolically the way and the 
truth of life and no one comes to the 

792
01:00:43,911 --> 01:00:48,911
father except through him embracing the 
process of voluntary death and rebirth 

793
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:54,580
that is identical with psychological 
development means determining to move 

794
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:56,990
forward and upward despite the horrors 
of life.

795
01:00:57,890 --> 01:01:00,590
It means as well,
symbolically speaking,

796
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:05,770
rejuvenating the dead father or rescuing
him from stagnation and deterioration in

797
01:01:06,381 --> 01:01:11,240
the eternal underworld.
Forthright individual confrontation with

798
01:01:11,241 --> 01:01:13,670
the unknown,
renews the Individual,

799
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:16,970
but also catalyze this cultural 
revitalization.

800
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:22,900
This is the essence of Christian ritual 
and belief articulated as a 

801
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:27,191
psychological principle.
We must identify with that part of 

802
01:01:27,191 --> 01:01:31,241
ourselves that is always stretching 
beyond what we currently know and has 

803
01:01:31,241 --> 01:01:35,321
the faith to let go of old certainties 
so that new patterns of being can be 

804
01:01:35,321 --> 01:01:35,900
brought into place.

805
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:41,450
It is through identification with the 
process symbolized by Easter,

806
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:45,410
that we are each redeemed and our 
culture revivified and salvaged.

807
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:48,890
We are all the slaves of Pharisees and 
lawyers,

808
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:53,150
have those who place dogma above spirit,
at the cost of spirit.

809
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:58,360
We're all subject to be trail by 
ourselves and by all those who surround 

810
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:02,891
us.
We're all facing extinction in the most 

811
01:02:02,891 --> 01:02:06,011
torturous of manners,
but there is a spirit within us with 

812
01:02:06,011 --> 01:02:10,241
sufficient courage to confront the true 
horrors of existence forthrightly to 

813
01:02:10,341 --> 01:02:14,630
allow the transformation,
even death that's such confrontation.

814
01:02:14,631 --> 01:02:17,780
Catalyze this to occur and to leap 
forward,

815
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:22,320
renewed.
How is it that life might prevail in the

816
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:27,321
face of death and hell with arms open 
embracing its fate.

817
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:31,770
We are all fallen creatures and we all 
know it.

818
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:37,210
We are all separated from what should be
and thrown into the world of death and 

819
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:37,350
despair.

820
01:02:38,070 --> 01:02:40,380
We're all brutally crucified on the 
cross.

821
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:45,381
That is the reality of life itself.
To rebel against that fate merely 

822
01:02:45,381 --> 01:02:50,271
worsens it transforming what could be 
mirrored tragedy into something 

823
01:02:50,271 --> 01:02:54,411
indistinguishable from hell to argue 
bitterly and despair around the deathbed

824
01:02:55,680 --> 01:03:00,680
of a loved one.
To take a single example is to turn all 

825
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,250
the pain of death and loss into 
something far worse.

826
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:07,910
To accept instead is that simultaneously
to transcend it?

827
01:03:08,591 --> 01:03:11,610
Certainly courage and truth and perhaps 
even love,

828
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,640
and these three forces are something to 
behold.

829
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:19,020
Are they more powerful than despair and 
the desire for vengeance?

830
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:24,800
That is the Christian suggestion and the
Christian command to act out the 

831
01:03:25,291 --> 01:03:30,291
proposition that courage and truth and 
love are more powerful than death and 

832
01:03:30,291 --> 01:03:33,390
despair and to accept what transpires as
a consequence.

833
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:37,620
That is Easter and the death and 
resurrection of Christ.

834
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:43,290
We forget or remain blind to such things
at our great peril.
