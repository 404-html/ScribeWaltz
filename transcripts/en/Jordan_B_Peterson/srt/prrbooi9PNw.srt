1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
[inaudible]

2
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:15,923
Bjorn Lomborg.
It's a Danish author and president of 

3
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:22,020
the Copenhagen Consensus Center,
a project base us think tank.

4
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,123
We're prominent.
Economists are seeking to establish 

5
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:25,854
priorities for advancing global welfare.
He's the former director of the Danish 

6
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:33,180
government Environmental Assessment 
Institute in Copenhagen.

7
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,450
Bjorn became known internationally for 
his book,

8
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:41,451
The skeptical environmentalist in 2001 
and how to spend $75 billion to make the

9
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:43,134
world a better place.
Cool it in 2007 which is also a movie 

10
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,300
and lately published in 2018 
prioritizing development,

11
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,510
a cost benefit analysis of the UN 
sustainable development goals among many

12
00:00:57,001 --> 00:00:57,834
other works in books.
And so I'm hoping we'll have a very 

13
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:04,770
productive conversation today and 
welcome to this discussion.

14
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,260
Thanks a lot of term.
All right,

15
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:08,094
so why don't you just start by letting 
people know what you've been up to over 

16
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,590
the last,
let's say two decades.

17
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:16,560
I know that's a very broad question and 
and why.

18
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:17,394
I mean I've been interested in talking 
to you because I read a number of your 

19
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:21,384
books a few years ago and I was 
interested in their economic analysis 

20
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:29,580
and and as a way of determining which,
which crises,

21
00:01:29,581 --> 00:01:30,414
let's say,
or which potential crises are real and 

22
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:34,320
also how they might be managed most 
intelligently.

23
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,450
Thank thanks a lot drew.
So you know,

24
00:01:38,451 --> 00:01:41,370
fundamentally what I tried to do is to 
say [inaudible],

25
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:42,890
this really is very,
very obvious.

26
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,380
We only have a limited amount of 
resources,

27
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,423
so let's make sure we focus those 
resources on the places where we can 

28
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,160
help the most,
where we can do the most good.

29
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,323
Remember,
what is it that we mostly focused on in 

30
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,713
the world?
It's very often the things that get the 

31
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,840
headlines,
the things that people talk about,

32
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:00,763
it talk about.
And very often that ends up being the 

33
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:03,104
things that have the cutest animals.
So the most crying babies of the groups 

34
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:07,454
with the best pr and surely that's not 
the right way to prioritize the right 

35
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:12,494
way.
It should be to look at if I spend a 

36
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:18,971
dollar or a peso or rupee here,
will I do more good than if I spent that

37
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:21,860
same dollar a rupee,
a piece out over here.

38
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:26,600
So basically asking across all the 
different areas you can spend resources,

39
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,830
where do I help the most?
Now obviously that's a huge conversation

40
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:33,380
in and of itself because it's not easy 
to just determine that.

41
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,453
But the basic idea is simply to say 
let's focus on the places where you can 

42
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:38,954
do the most good rather than the places 
where it makes us feel the best about 

43
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:43,964
ourselves.
So that's really what I've been trying 

44
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:46,154
to do for,
for,

45
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,300
for,
for two decades.

46
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,840
And you know,
prioritizing the world and trying to say

47
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,430
where should you spend money,
of course makes the,

48
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,180
the projects that we say these are the 
really,

49
00:02:56,181 --> 00:02:57,014
really great interventions.
They all love us and think we're the 

50
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:01,900
best thing since sliced bread.
But of course the,

51
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,780
the projects and the policies that are 
not so effective,

52
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,760
we think we're terrible.
So,

53
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:09,340
you know,
it creates a lot of antagonism and makes

54
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:11,520
a lot of people annoyed and interest in 
it.

55
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,900
But I think it's crucial to ask these 
questions.

56
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,340
Well,
one question would be,

57
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:17,140
what's the alternative?
You know,

58
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:19,630
like when I was looking at the UN 
development goals,

59
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:21,190
for example,
if I remember correctly,

60
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:23,290
there was something approximating 200 of
them.

61
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,010
And this was a few years ago,
I worked on a UN panel and I thought,

62
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:27,844
well the problem with 200 goals is that 
you can't have 200 they're not goals if 

63
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:33,154
there's 200 of them,
because you absolutely have to 

64
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:38,740
prioritize in order to move forward.
Assuming some limitation on resources,

65
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:40,810
which is exactly what,
what you,

66
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,420
what you just described.
And so then,

67
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,610
then the question would become,
well,

68
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,120
how do you calculate benefit?
And that's a really difficult problem,

69
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:52,990
which is I think why it wasn't addressed
with the mishmash of 200 goals,

70
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,093
apart from the fact that you're going to
offend people by rank ordering their 

71
00:03:56,261 --> 00:03:57,094
priorities.

72
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,650
So why don't you tell people a little 
bit about the,

73
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:00,723
about the methods that you used?
Because I think they're extremely 

74
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:05,170
interesting.
So you're absolutely right.

75
00:04:05,171 --> 00:04:06,004
The sustainable development goals.
We actually work with the UN back in 

76
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:11,140
2015 when they were doing this.
I,

77
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,020
uh,
it was,

78
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,580
it was,
uh,

79
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,550
it was about a 60 to 90.
It was very unclear,

80
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,780
uh,
UN ambassadors.

81
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:18,870
I actually met with a quarter of them,
uh,

82
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,860
in New York,
can talk to each one of them said,

83
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,270
shouldn't we try to,
you know,

84
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,150
focus on the targets that would do the 
very most good.

85
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,630
And of course,
each one of them said yes individually,

86
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,250
but the,
the,

87
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,093
the combined effort of all the UN 
ambassadors was of course not to 

88
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:34,684
actually do the best goals.
It was to get everybody's goals in 

89
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:38,171
there.
So,

90
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:39,004
you know,
the Norwegians had three ideas and the 

91
00:04:40,421 --> 00:04:42,490
Brazilians at four and everybody else 
had,

92
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,290
you know,
three or four that they want in there.

93
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,860
That's why we ended up with 169 targets.
Uh,

94
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,753
which of course simply means you 
promised everything to everyone 

95
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:53,560
everywhere.
And that means a lot of people are going

96
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:54,394
to be very disappointed when 2030 rolls 
around and we haven't actually dealt 

97
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,380
with all the things that we promised.
Right?

98
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:03,160
So what happens there?
What happens there is that you,

99
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,640
the people who are doing that and 
including everyone on the list,

100
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,873
maximize short term emotional wellbeing 
of the people who had been doing the 

101
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:14,620
consultation at the cost of medium to 
longterm progress,

102
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:15,843
but then again,
they're not going to be around in 2030 

103
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:20,200
and all possibility to suffer the 
consequences of that.

104
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,780
So yeah,
or at least they're not.

105
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:23,643
Nobody's going to see that.
We failed to do as much good as we 

106
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:29,650
possibly could because we will have done
a little bit of good everywhere,

107
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,070
but doing a little good everywhere.

108
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,933
It's not nearly as good as doing an 
enormous amount of good in the places 

109
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:38,530
where you can view the very most good 
with extra resources.

110
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,260
Again,
remember we're estimating the total cost

111
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:46,261
of the sdgs as somewhere in there in the
range of two and a half trillion dollars

112
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:51,280
and the actual amounts available,
there's about $140 billion.

113
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,730
So we literally have 5% of what we're 
promising.

114
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,830
So we're promising the world and then we
say,

115
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:59,330
hey,
here's a small amount of money and let's

116
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:02,240
spread it similarly.
So everybody gets a little bit of it.

117
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,600
Okay.
So that's,

118
00:06:03,601 --> 00:06:04,434
so that's partly where you derive your 
premise that we're dealing with limited 

119
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:08,084
resources is that you're actually using 
a real number and the number of you're 

120
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:12,044
using is what's actually available.
And when you wrote how to spend 75 

121
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,093
billion,
you basically go calf of what it was 

122
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:20,030
available that yes,
that was about much,

123
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,260
much earlier on.

124
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,243
And that was mostly sort of a,
it's a fun idea to say how would you 

125
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:26,720
spend a specific amount?
Yes.

126
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:28,160
And that was half.
Uh,

127
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:30,560
so,
so we weren't saying we should spend all

128
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:31,394
of it in the exact way that we were 
talking about how would totally agree 

129
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:35,510
with you.
So to agree with you,

130
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:36,344
people have to agree that everything 
can't be done for everyone all at once 

131
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,160
at infinite expense.
And that it's useful practically.

132
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,133
And,
and also even in a Utopian sense in 

133
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:51,850
desirable sends to rank order so that 
the obvious money that's available,

134
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:54,510
the money that's genuinely available can
be targeted best.

135
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,543
And so then the next question would be 
how do you go about that in the least 

136
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,420
controversial and most empirically sound
manner to,

137
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,020
to do the rank ordering.
So we use cost benefit analysis,

138
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:09,620
which is a very well established 
economic tool that tries to say,

139
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,513
all right,
for each of the proposals that you come 

140
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:14,570
up with,
how much will that proposal cost?

141
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,210
Now remember,
this is not just economics.

142
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:20,030
Most of the costs will be money.
But for instance,

143
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:21,650
if you want to immunize,
uh,

144
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,330
uh,
small children,

145
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,373
you also have to ask the mothers to 
spend packs a day to go to the place 

146
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:31,340
where their kids will be immunized.
That'll both cost them labor.

147
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:35,270
They can't do Labor that day.
Maybe they'll have transportation costs,

148
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:37,550
I'll have food costs,
there'll be extra the cost.

149
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,490
So we try to add all of those costs up 
and say,

150
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:42,560
so what's the total cost of this 
project?

151
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,220
Then we look at all the benefits and I 
remember the benefits of both economic,

152
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:47,001
yes,
uh,

153
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:48,770
but there are also social,
for instance,

154
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:52,910
kids not dying or kids not being sick 
and they are often also environmental.

155
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,103
So we tried to take all of those costs,
all of those benefits of both the 

156
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,170
economic,
the environmental and social benefits at

157
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:01,004
them all up into one number that is 
denominated in dollars or rupees or 

158
00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:06,410
whatever your currency is.

159
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,573
And then you can say,
well for this many dollars you can do 

160
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:10,754
this much good.
And that means you can also say for 

161
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:15,380
every dollar spent you can do this much 
good.

162
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,393
Now obviously I'm simplifying this,
but in a sense what it means is if you 

163
00:08:20,271 --> 00:08:21,104
do it right,
a lot of economists has spent a lot of 

164
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:23,624
time trying to make those right.
If you have all the same parameters 

165
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:26,804
across all these different areas,
it actually means you can start 

166
00:08:29,061 --> 00:08:33,560
comparing different interventions across
all the different areas and say,

167
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,810
where do you get the biggest bang for 
your buck?

168
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,830
And of course that is what matters if 
you're actually going to do good.

169
00:08:39,831 --> 00:08:41,420
So we did a,
and this is not,

170
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,520
please don't buy this book because this 
is,

171
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,533
this is a very long at an academic book,
but we did this long and academic book 

172
00:08:47,811 --> 00:08:48,644
with with more than 50 of the world's 
top economists looking across all these 

173
00:08:52,071 --> 00:08:52,904
different areas.

174
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,833
But the beauty is you can actually put 
it in just one chart and I'm going to 

175
00:08:57,211 --> 00:08:58,044
show you that.
And then we'll also put it up on your 

176
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:02,090
website.
So this is the ones,

177
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,760
one page chart that has all the targets 
here.

178
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,133
And for each of the targets there's an 
analysis that says how much will this 

179
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:11,790
cost,
how much good will it do?

180
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,280
And then it shows for every dollar 
spent,

181
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:16,860
how much good will it do?
If it's a long line,

182
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,650
it'll do a lot of dollars of good.
If it's a short line,

183
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:20,723
not too much.
So it really becomes this very simple 

184
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,970
menu for the world to say,
where can you spend your resources?

185
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,990
And of course this doesn't mean,
you know,

186
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,530
just like when you go into a restaurant,
you get a menu.

187
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:35,070
Doesn't mean you buy the cheapest thing 
or the most nutritious thing.

188
00:09:35,071 --> 00:09:36,530
Maybe you're in the mood for it,
you know,

189
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,910
uh,
an unhealthy cake.

190
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,190
But it's incredibly important to know 
what is the cost and what's the benefit.

191
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,263
And knowing this makes it a lot more 
likely that the world is going to focus 

192
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:49,314
itself on some of the really long bars 
where it can do a lot of good for every 

193
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:54,840
dollar or group you're a peso spent.

194
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,213
Okay.
So now if I was thinking about 

195
00:09:58,411 --> 00:09:59,244
critiquing this,
let's say from a social science and an 

196
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
aura or a political perspective,
the first thing that I would object is,

197
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,800
well,
how do you,

198
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,953
how,
how is it that you know that your 

199
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:13,680
calculation of the costs and the 
benefits are accurate?

200
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,873
So you and,
and how do you know that they're 

201
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:21,810
essentially as free as possible of any 
undue political bias?

202
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,213
So because the critics,
no doubt we'll object as perhaps they 

203
00:10:27,721 --> 00:10:29,310
should,
that there will be,

204
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,530
let's call them implicit biases even 
though I'm not a fan of that idea.

205
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,513
In some sense there's going to be 
underlying presuppositions that weight 

206
00:10:38,161 --> 00:10:40,530
the manner in which the economic 
calculations are made.

207
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,543
And then of course you also have to buy 
the idea that the cost benefit analysis 

208
00:10:44,401 --> 00:10:45,234
approach is actually valid.
So can you tell me what you guys did to 

209
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,480
forestall such to take such criticisms 
into account?

210
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:53,563
And so first of all,
we don't just ask one team of 

211
00:10:56,461 --> 00:10:57,294
economists.
We also have other teams critiquing 

212
00:10:58,921 --> 00:10:59,754
those economists and we exactly tried to
make sure that there's sort of critique 

213
00:11:03,051 --> 00:11:03,884
some both sides if you will.
So we know that this is not just an 

214
00:11:06,451 --> 00:11:07,284
ideologically driven number,
but it's actually an empirically pretty 

215
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:12,750
clear number that says,
for instance,

216
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:16,440
if you focus on on vaccinations,
you're actually going to do.

217
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:17,274
And what we find is you're going to do 
$60 to social good for every dollar you 

218
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:23,160
spend.
Now you could argue,

219
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,190
well,
what?

220
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:28,050
What would be sort of the ideal 
ideological spin you could put in that?

221
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:29,580
Well,
one thing is to say,

222
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,370
well,
did you measure all humans as equal?

223
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,660
Yes,
we actually did.

224
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,793
And of course you could argue from an 
economic point the same point that they 

225
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:40,350
are not.
I think very few people would want to do

226
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:43,230
that,
but what we do is across all this,

227
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,243
all these areas,
all people are ranked as equally 

228
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:47,190
important.

229
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:51,270
That is equally valuable and that's 
obviously political consideration.

230
00:11:51,271 --> 00:11:52,104
But I think one,
if we're looking across a world that is 

231
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:56,590
the right one,
if anything,

232
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,543
that probably means that most rich 
country people are valued at way too 

233
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:03,640
little compared to what they're actually
willing to do themselves.

234
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,170
But this means that we actually get the 
waiting right intensive sense of saying,

235
00:12:08,171 --> 00:12:09,004
where are you going to spend extra money
if your goal is to help the most in the 

236
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:13,510
world?
Right.

237
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:14,344
Okay.
So you used an approach that was 

238
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,383
basically,
I would say a solid measurement 

239
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:19,710
approach,
uh,

240
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,880
from,
from the theoretical perspective because

241
00:12:21,881 --> 00:12:22,714
the idea would be to have multiple 
measures of the same phenomenon or set 

242
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:31,060
of phenomena and,
and to see where they are dovetail.

243
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,520
So that would be an issue of 
reliability.

244
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:34,354
So if you have multiple teams of 
economists and they all converge on 

245
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:38,614
something that approximates an agreement
and you look at a diverse range of 

246
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:42,274
opinions,
then you can be reasonably certain that 

247
00:12:44,231 --> 00:12:45,880
you've conversed on something that's 
real.

248
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,340
And then you also have an element of 
peer review in there.

249
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,400
Yes.
Another way of go,

250
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,303
go ahead and exactly what both of these 
are obviously important to make sure as 

251
00:12:56,381 --> 00:12:58,710
you say,
that you get the reliability of the,

252
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,890
you actually get something that 
resembles somewhat of a truth.

253
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,470
But the real point here is of course,
in some way,

254
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:09,280
if we just take a step back,
this is not a question about getting the

255
00:13:09,281 --> 00:13:11,530
absolute numbers exactly right.
I mean,

256
00:13:11,531 --> 00:13:13,120
that would be wonderful if we could do 
that.

257
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,040
Uh,
but when I just told you that,

258
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:15,940
you know,
vaccination,

259
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:16,774
every dollar you spend,
we'll give you $60 back and it'd be 

260
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:20,344
very,
very unlikely that that's the right 

261
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:23,470
number.
But it's much,

262
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:26,160
much more about getting the order of 
magnitude right.

263
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:30,640
Is it 60 or is it six or is it $600 you 
get back?

264
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,593
Because really the point here is to 
compare across all these other things 

265
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:36,550
that you could also have spent that 
money on.

266
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:41,970
And there we have a much greater uh,
sort of reliability because we're pretty

267
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:45,940
sure that even if you change the 
assumption very much,

268
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,180
you will still get much of the same kind
of picture.

269
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,343
You won't get exactly the same picture,
but you'll very much get the same sort 

270
00:13:53,171 --> 00:13:54,004
of picture,
which indicates that there's a few 

271
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:57,730
targets that we'll do an amazing amount 
of good.

272
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,980
And there's a lot of targets.
I'll just do a little good.

273
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,113
And so again,
we tried to say is do the amazing 

274
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,150
targets first.
Okay.

275
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:04,984
So the critical thing for you guys to 
get right as the rank ordering and not 

276
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:08,434
the absolute magnet as well.
So as long as your method is stable 

277
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:12,484
across all the different domains,
then the rank ordering should be 

278
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:15,574
relatively stable.
Now did you get a prieto distribution 

279
00:14:18,281 --> 00:14:21,730
with regards to um,
positive impact of investment?

280
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,563
Like is there a handful of interventions
that are clearly head and shoulders 

281
00:14:27,821 --> 00:14:31,030
above the rest in terms of generating 
positive economic outcome and,

282
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,133
and what,
and what proportion of the total number 

283
00:14:33,761 --> 00:14:36,610
of say 170 goals,
like if you did,

284
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,533
if you accomplish 10% of the 170 goals,
how much of the Economic Bang for your 

285
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:43,720
buck would you,
would you accrue?

286
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,200
I should actually just say I didn't 
plant that question.

287
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:50,080
That's wonderful because that's exactly 
what we tried to do.

288
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,720
So if you do across all these areas,
every dollar spent,

289
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:57,920
we'll do about $7 of good if you just 
did it across all of them equally,

290
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,200
which is probably unreasonable to 
assume,

291
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:00,891
but it's not,
you know,

292
00:15:00,891 --> 00:15:01,724
unreasonable.
And the sort of first order 

293
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:07,700
approximation,
if you spend it on the best 19 targets,

294
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,930
you would do $32 of good.
So more than four times more.

295
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:12,764
Good.
So you can simply spend you're the same 

296
00:15:14,991 --> 00:15:15,824
dollar and do more than four times more 
good than you would do if you just 

297
00:15:19,191 --> 00:15:20,960
scattershot it across all areas.

298
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,243
And again,
what you also have to remember is a lot 

299
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:26,150
of the things that we're looking at,
which are really,

300
00:15:26,151 --> 00:15:29,900
really effective.
Also things that are much easier to do.

301
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,640
So two of the best things that we point 
out is actually contraception.

302
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,520
So family planning for women.
Why?

303
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,100
Because if you do that,
not that there's,

304
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:44,510
there's about 13% of women that still 
don't have access to contraception.

305
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,480
Uh,
and if they got that access,

306
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,790
they would be able to better space it 
kits.

307
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:50,624
And we know that that means that you can
actually have your pubes when you're 

308
00:15:52,671 --> 00:15:53,504
ready to have them.
That means you put more effort and 

309
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,580
investment into your kids.
So they'll grow up better,

310
00:15:58,581 --> 00:15:59,414
they'll be fed better,
they'll have a greater chance of 

311
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:02,054
surviving,
but they'll also become more productive 

312
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:04,424
in the long run.
It also means fewer of those kids are 

313
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:08,480
going to die,
few of moms are going to die.

314
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,480
So we actually estimate you'd see about 
600,000 fewer kids die and you would get

315
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,480
a demographic dividend that is basically
because you have slightly,

316
00:16:18,481 --> 00:16:20,630
if your kids,
you can invest more in them,

317
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,583
you get better return on every kid.
You have slightly higher growth rates 

318
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:25,903
and so we estimate for every dollar you 
spend that family planning you will do 

319
00:16:28,911 --> 00:16:29,744
$120 of social good.
The other great thing is invest in free 

320
00:16:34,851 --> 00:16:35,684
trade.
Free Trade is something that we've sort 

321
00:16:37,641 --> 00:16:39,240
of forgotten.
Uh,

322
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,810
we actually had the last big free trade,
a discussion from Doha,

323
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,560
uh,
back in 1999.

324
00:16:45,561 --> 00:16:46,810
It's basically,
you know,

325
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,773
stop being a concern obviously with 
trump but also with many other people 

326
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:53,390
who have sort of given up on free trade 
yet.

327
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:54,224
We have to remember that one of the 
basic things that have made us wealthy 

328
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,630
is the fact that we trade with each 
other.

329
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,090
You do what you're good at and I do what
I'm good at.

330
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:05,090
And that means when we change,
we actually all get better off.

331
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,950
There are some issues here
in some,

332
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,360
in some detail.
What,

333
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,200
what,
what that would mean practically.

334
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:13,034
Like what are the sorts of barriers that
you guys determined were particularly 

335
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:21,980
troublesome that need to be addressed.
So we actually estimate it,

336
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:25,460
what would it take to get a reasonably 
successful dough around,

337
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,210
which would not be free trade,
but it would be free yard trade.

338
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,250
So it would simply be reduced.
Harris,

339
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,400
make it easier for everyone to trade 
across the world,

340
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,280
especially from the developing world to 
the developed world.

341
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,520
And one of the outcomes we found was not
only that,

342
00:17:40,521 --> 00:17:41,354
on average,
every person in the world would be 

343
00:17:42,741 --> 00:17:43,521
about,
sorry,

344
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:44,354
in the developing world would be about a
thousand dollars richer per person per 

345
00:17:47,751 --> 00:17:51,180
year in 2030 so by the end of the 
sustainable development goals,

346
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:55,200
we would lift 145 million people out of 
poverty.

347
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:00,620
But we would simply make everyone better
off because if you're in a poor country,

348
00:18:00,961 --> 00:18:03,630
you would be able to sell the things 
that you do best.

349
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,820
How little easier,
a little cheaper,

350
00:18:05,821 --> 00:18:06,654
and hence be able to market more of it.
And you'd be able to buy back more from 

351
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:13,620
other developed countries and that would
make everyone better off.

352
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,030
So again,
this is not,

353
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,490
this is not rocket science.
I mean if you look at China,

354
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:18,490
for instance,
uh,

355
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:23,540
China over the last 30 years lifted what
had 680 million people out of poverty,

356
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,043
very largely driven by the fact that 
they could trade with the rest of the 

357
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:30,330
world.
Imagine if we could make that happen for

358
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,690
sub Saharan Africa if we could make that
happen more for Latin America.

359
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,823
So again,
it's more about realizing that for very 

360
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:38,034
little money,
some of these things can do an amazing 

361
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:41,064
amount of good and we tend to forget 
because there's no focus on these 

362
00:18:44,761 --> 00:18:45,594
issues.
We don't think about a family planning 

363
00:18:47,821 --> 00:18:51,720
or or,
or a free trade or indeed vaccinations.

364
00:18:51,721 --> 00:18:52,554
We think about all kinds of other things
like plastic waste or global warming or 

365
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,860
many other things that have a lot of 
sort of,

366
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,570
uh,
attention from,

367
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,880
from celebrities and getting the 
newspaper.

368
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,950
And that's because there are no 
problems.

369
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,360
But it's about getting a sense of what's
the magnitude of how much good we can do

370
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,440
with little money.
And let's talk about global warming

371
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,620
because by,
okay,

372
00:19:14,621 --> 00:19:16,060
so my,
my,

373
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,970
I've talked to lots of people about your
work and you know,

374
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,860
you obviously have a lot of admirers and
you have a lot of detractors.

375
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,833
And I'd be listening to the detractors 
because I believed after I had reviewed 

376
00:19:28,031 --> 00:19:28,864
the UN development goals,
I had come to the same conclusion that 

377
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,280
you had come to before I knew what you 
had done,

378
00:19:33,281 --> 00:19:34,114
which was these things need to be rank 
ordered because otherwise it's not a 

379
00:19:36,701 --> 00:19:38,260
plan.
It's not a strategy.

380
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,470
And so then there has to be some 
mechanism for rank ordering them.

381
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,270
And I ran across your work and I 
thought,

382
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:48,040
well that seems to be exactly right to 
me from an agnostic perspective,

383
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:48,874
let's say it's an interesting idea 
because what you have to start with is 

384
00:19:51,701 --> 00:19:52,534
the willingness to be agnostic about 
what the worst problems are and while 

385
00:19:56,471 --> 00:19:59,530
the worst and most solvable problems,
let's say at the same time,

386
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,830
you have to be agnostic about that.
And I actually think that that's part of

387
00:20:02,831 --> 00:20:03,664
the reason why what you do bothers so 
many people because they have an a 

388
00:20:05,891 --> 00:20:09,640
priori commitment to what constitutes 
the most salient catastrophe.

389
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,160
And that's clearly at the moment is,
is the eye,

390
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,780
the idea that,
uh,

391
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:19,330
climate change or global warming,
depending on how you want to phrase it,

392
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,523
um,
constitutes such an immediate and 

393
00:20:22,031 --> 00:20:22,864
pressing threat of,
of overwhelming economic magnitude that 

394
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:31,680
a sacrifice of any amount is worth some 
probability of forestalling that.

395
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,030
And so,
um,

396
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,023
one of the things that striking about 
your list and maybe what I should do is 

397
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:39,684
have you tell us what the top seven or 
eight are just so that we have some 

398
00:20:42,631 --> 00:20:43,464
sense of what the priorities are.
Because one of the things I noticed was 

399
00:20:46,591 --> 00:20:48,100
that they don't tend

400
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,430
to include measures that are designed to
forestall global warming.

401
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,701
Yeah.
So,

402
00:20:53,701 --> 00:20:54,520
uh,
we actually,

403
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,150
uh,
we,

404
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,840
we had two Nobel laureates,
um,

405
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,873
look over all of these evident,
all of this evidence and set priorities 

406
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:04,210
and then come out with 19 targets that 
they focused on.

407
00:21:04,211 --> 00:21:05,950
Actually one of them was,
uh,

408
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,813
stop fossil fuel subsidies,
which is obviously a stupid idea in so 

409
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,280
many different ways.
Uh,

410
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,220
remember this is most of them developing
countries where it's very often done,

411
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,233
uh,
to basically pacified population a 

412
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:19,354
little bit.
Like you make a subsidies for bread or 

413
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:22,810
other things.
Uh,

414
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,660
but of course the idea of subsidizing 
fossil fuels like that.

415
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:28,140
So it was done in Indonesia has done,
uh,

416
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,203
is basically a way of subsidizing fairly
wealthy people to drive their car that 

417
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:33,994
you have to have a car in order to enjoy
this a and drive it more and actually 

418
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,403
create more congestion,
more inclusion and with very few 

419
00:21:41,141 --> 00:21:41,974
benefits.

420
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,873
Uh,
so clearly what you should be doing is 

421
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,070
scrap those subsidies for fossil fuels,
not only because they lead to more,

422
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,710
uh,
air pollution and co two emissions,

423
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,753
but also because they're just terribly 
bad use of public resources that could 

424
00:21:54,821 --> 00:21:55,654
have been spent on education or health 
or other places they could have done a 

425
00:21:58,841 --> 00:21:59,674
lot more.
Good.

426
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:00,723
But just to give you a sense of some of 
the other ones that we were talking 

427
00:22:02,891 --> 00:22:03,820
about,
uh,

428
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:06,220
expanded immunization as we talked 
about.

429
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:07,263
That's an incredibly good way.
We know that we're right now cut child 

430
00:22:11,321 --> 00:22:12,154
mortality that is under five mortality 
from about 12 million kids dying every 

431
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:20,920
year in 1992 about 6 million.
That's a fantastic achievement.

432
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:21,993
Of course,
6 million is still a mind boggling 

433
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,480
number that's way,
way too large.

434
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,450
And we actually know that by investing 
about a billion dollars,

435
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,220
we could save a million kids every year 
that you've got to almost say that again

436
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,510
for $1 billion.

437
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:37,180
You could save a million kids' lives 
every year.

438
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:40,210
Why the hell is that not one of our top 
priorities?

439
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:43,060
And that's also why we show for every 
dollar spent,

440
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,900
you actually do $60 worth of goods and 
other incredible,

441
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,420
uh,
investment is in nutrition.

442
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:50,501
Uh,
so,

443
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:52,210
you know,
everybody kind of knows that it's,

444
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:53,883
it's not right that people are starving 
and we know that we could actually feed 

445
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,693
everyone.
The main reason why people are still 

446
00:22:58,631 --> 00:23:00,640
starving is because they don't have 
enough money.

447
00:23:00,641 --> 00:23:01,474
It's not because we can't produce it.
So it's because they're poor and they 

448
00:23:03,671 --> 00:23:04,504
don't actually have the demand capacity.
But the real tragedy of malnutrition is 

449
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,460
a,
if you get it when you're really small,

450
00:23:12,461 --> 00:23:16,480
so from zero to two years of age,
your brain develops less.

451
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:17,583
And that means when you get into school,
you're actually less able to learn and 

452
00:23:21,581 --> 00:23:23,530
that stays with you for your entire 
life.

453
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:28,330
You stay less long than school,
you learn less than you come out and you

454
00:23:28,331 --> 00:23:31,510
actually are not very productive.
We know this now we,

455
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:34,030
we've had this as a theoretical argument
for a long time.

456
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:35,043
Uh,
but researchers in some of the 

457
00:23:35,741 --> 00:23:36,574
researchers that we work with have not 
actually proven this because they went 

458
00:23:39,641 --> 00:23:43,420
back to an old study done in Guatemala 
and the late 1960s,

459
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,453
uh,
where researchers went to two small 

460
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:46,904
villages,
ruled water model and gave the kids 

461
00:23:49,191 --> 00:23:50,024
there.
So the really small zero to two year 

462
00:23:50,901 --> 00:23:52,190
olds,
good food,

463
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,383
and then they took to other rural 
villages nearby and gave the kids 

464
00:23:56,331 --> 00:23:59,540
essentially sugar water.
Of course you couldn't do this today.

465
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,613
But the brilliant thing about it is,
as our researchers then refound these 

466
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:04,094
kids,
they now in their late thirties early 

467
00:24:05,271 --> 00:24:08,150
forties and you could see what had 
happened,

468
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,280
and it was exactly what the theory 
predicted.

469
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:14,390
If you had gotten good food,
you stayed longer in school,

470
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:18,260
you'll learn more every year in school.
And so when you came out,

471
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,153
you were much more productive.
And one of the ways we measure that is 

472
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,520
you had higher incomes.
If you're avoiding being stunned,

473
00:24:24,521 --> 00:24:29,000
it you had 60% higher income.
That's just a phenomenal outcome.

474
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,260
So again,
spend money,

475
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:31,094
for instance,
a malnutrition by getting good food and 

476
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:36,350
also research and development into 
better yielding varieties.

477
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:40,850
And you can do an incredible amount of 
good for every dollar we estimate $35 or

478
00:24:40,851 --> 00:24:41,684
thereabouts,

479
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,880
right?
And so what you're doing is for stalling

480
00:24:43,881 --> 00:24:46,850
cognitive deterioration in the,
in the first two years.

481
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:50,180
And because cognitive ability is a great
predictor of longterm success,

482
00:24:50,181 --> 00:24:51,014
then you're producing people who are 
much more likely to be economically 

483
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,840
productive for themselves and for other 
people.

484
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:57,861
Right?
And so,

485
00:24:57,861 --> 00:24:58,950
yeah,
it is.

486
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,440
It's also for other people,
right?

487
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:01,880
If you're yeah,
you're good.

488
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,980
You're likely to make other people 
better too.

489
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:04,850
Yeah.
Right.

490
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,740
Oh yes.
That's an absolutely crucial issue.

491
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,600
So,
so yeah,

492
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,580
so,
so it's quite striking.

493
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,373
It was quite striking to me when I came 
across your work to find out to what 

494
00:25:14,901 --> 00:25:15,734
degree it was focused on targeting 
children's health in some fundamental 

495
00:25:19,731 --> 00:25:22,370
sense in the developing world.
That seems to be,

496
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,490
if you had to put it in a nutshell,
correct me if I'm wrong.

497
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:29,010
That seemed to be where are you guys 
focused or where,

498
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:33,980
where your focus took you and
what else can I just say?

499
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,380
Because there's also some other very low
hanging fruit.

500
00:25:36,381 --> 00:25:37,280
For instance,
uh,

501
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:39,410
what you're seeing increasingly across 
the world is

502
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:43,770
that more and more people died,
not of infectious diseases because we've

503
00:25:43,771 --> 00:25:47,760
actually tackled many of those.
But they died from old age diseases like

504
00:25:47,761 --> 00:25:49,300
cancer and heart disease.
Those,

505
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,810
it by far the biggest issues,
cancer,

506
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,210
it turns out to be fairly costly to deal
with.

507
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,223
But heart disease,
we've actually now figure it out pretty 

508
00:25:58,031 --> 00:25:58,864
much how to deal with,
not to the extent that we will live 

509
00:26:00,821 --> 00:26:01,654
forever,
but that we can make people live much 

510
00:26:03,221 --> 00:26:04,054
longer.
And that's basically by giving very 

511
00:26:05,471 --> 00:26:08,980
cheap and off Patton,
a heart med medication.

512
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,023
So we give this a lot of middle aged 
people and the developed world and it's 

513
00:26:13,451 --> 00:26:14,284
very,
very cheap to also do in the developing 

514
00:26:15,761 --> 00:26:18,370
world.
So we can save about three years of life

515
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,490
for these elderly people,
both men and women.

516
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:26,700
And it costs peanuts and you can 
basically make all lives longer.

517
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,280
And so that's one of the places where we
also show there's a huge benefit.

518
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,653
We also emphasize,
and this is again one of the depressing 

519
00:26:34,361 --> 00:26:37,930
things that we should be focusing a lot 
more on tuberculosis,

520
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:38,973
tuberculosis.
Now the world's leading infectious 

521
00:26:40,931 --> 00:26:43,260
disease killer.
It's no longer HIV aids.

522
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,510
Uh,
that's still a good idea to invest in,

523
00:26:45,511 --> 00:26:48,930
but it's actually needing better idea to
invest in tuberculosis.

524
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,340
But again,
because it's an old diseases,

525
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,223
you know,
it's been with us for hundreds of years 

526
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:57,000
and we kind of learned to how to fix it 
a hundred years ago.

527
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,860
It's not an issue in the developed 
world,

528
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,750
so most people don't want to hear about 
it,

529
00:27:00,751 --> 00:27:05,040
don't care about it.
But it's a crucial killer that kills 1.4

530
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,410
million people every year in the 
developing world.

531
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,520
And we have the means to eradicate 
pretty much all of those that's very,

532
00:27:11,521 --> 00:27:12,600
very cheaply.
So again,

533
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,583
that's one of the places where we say 
spend money here because you can do an 

534
00:27:15,931 --> 00:27:16,830
amazing amount of good.

535
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:21,450
So I think we were just simply looking 
for where are the really good deals?

536
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,840
If you want to do something about global
warming is an issue,

537
00:27:24,841 --> 00:27:28,140
then you should ask yourself,
well,

538
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:31,020
how are we going to fix it?
So there's two things to global warming.

539
00:27:31,021 --> 00:27:32,490
One is,
as you mentioned,

540
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:33,324
there's a sense in which people believe 
it's the overwhelming danger that's 

541
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,063
going to undermine the entirety of human
civilization and just like pretty much 

542
00:27:42,781 --> 00:27:44,460
all other problems.
That's just not true.

543
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,890
This is a problem.
It's not the end of the world.

544
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:49,350
Uh,
if you look at the economic system done,

545
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,383
uh,
the Nobel prize was just a water and 

546
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:54,540
climate economics to Willy North House,
uh,

547
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,620
this year.
Uh,

548
00:27:55,621 --> 00:27:58,920
and he's been a,
a guy working almost three decades on,

549
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:59,700
uh,
on,

550
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,400
on what are the costs and the benefits 
of,

551
00:28:02,401 --> 00:28:05,400
of climate action.
And he finds the cost of climate.

552
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,033
So climate change is about,
and he's backed up on a lot of other 

553
00:28:10,471 --> 00:28:11,304
economists,
is somewhere between two and 4% of GDP 

554
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:18,390
by the end of the century.
So remember by then we'll be,

555
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,490
you know,
say four or five times richer.

556
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:23,280
So we'll be 400,
5% as rich as we are now,

557
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,640
but we will see a drop in our incomes 
worth about two to 4% less than we would

558
00:28:30,361 --> 00:28:32,070
otherwise have had.
That's a problem.

559
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,740
But it's by no means the end of the 
world.

560
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,560
And that's the first thing you sort of 
need to recognize.

561
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,050
This is a problem is not the end of the 
world.

562
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,940
Because if you think you're,
it's the end of the world,

563
00:28:41,941 --> 00:28:42,774
as you rightly pointed out,
then you're willing to throw everything 

564
00:28:44,611 --> 00:28:47,220
and the kitchen sink at it.
But if it's a problem,

565
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:50,970
you will act exactly like what I think 
we should do with all problems.

566
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:51,803
Say,
all right,

567
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,850
there's a lot of problems.
Let's ask,

568
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,690
where can we spend a dollar and fix most
of that problem.

569
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,150
And unfortunately that's not climate 
change.

570
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,170
It's actually really,
really hard to just change it.

571
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,240
A tiny bit of climate change with a lot 
of money.

572
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,433
And that's why we find that most of the 
interventions that you do for climate 

573
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:12,060
change,
it turns out to be fairly poor.

574
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,500
They're not necessarily bad investments,
some of them are.

575
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,540
Uh,
but even,

576
00:29:15,541 --> 00:29:16,291
you know,
for instance,

577
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:19,860
adaptation or,
or get more energy for,

578
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,560
uh,
for poor countries give you sort of,

579
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,431
you know,
two,

580
00:29:23,431 --> 00:29:26,100
$5 back on the dollar,
which is nice.

581
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:28,470
But in the big scheme of things here are
much,

582
00:29:28,471 --> 00:29:30,900
much better place as you can spend your 
resources on.

583
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:31,590
So,
okay.

584
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,250
He's,
Oh so,

585
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,840
so let's look at God.
Look at this.

586
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,960
Well,
cause I'm really curious about this,

587
00:29:35,961 --> 00:29:36,794
hey,
because I can't see any a priori 

588
00:29:39,451 --> 00:29:42,010
problems with your method.
It seems to me to make a

589
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:42,843
lot of sense.
And if your goal is to do the most 

590
00:29:45,641 --> 00:29:49,120
amount of good in the shortest period of
time with the least amount of resources,

591
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,193
which seems like a pretty damn good goal
then and to be realistic about what's 

592
00:29:53,531 --> 00:29:54,364
attainable then I can't see that 
anyone's done a better job from a 

593
00:29:57,911 --> 00:30:00,070
methodological perspective than you guys
have.

594
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,451
Okay.
But now,

595
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:04,960
but you still face a tremendous amount 
of opposition and most of that does come

596
00:30:04,961 --> 00:30:07,270
from the climate side of things as far 
as I can tell.

597
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,823
So it's,
I've been trying to think through why 

598
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:11,854
that might be.
And so when I reviewed the climate 

599
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:16,780
literature,
which was a few years ago,

600
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:17,893
um,
I had some real concerns about 

601
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:20,434
measurement,
accuracy and so forth because it's a 

602
00:30:22,151 --> 00:30:27,151
very complicated issue and it's not the 
constants that should be associated with

603
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,070
increase in carbon dioxide aren't 
obvious.

604
00:30:30,071 --> 00:30:31,930
And there's quite wide error bars around
them.

605
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:32,763
And then carbon dioxide has all sorts of
weirdly complicated effects like 

606
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:39,310
increasing green global greening,
which is quite an interesting one.

607
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,770
And so anyways,
it also struck me that the,

608
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:44,883
if you project out the climate change 
estimates across about a 50 to 100 year 

609
00:30:48,491 --> 00:30:49,324
period,
the error bars grow very large as you 

610
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:53,680
move outward,
obviously because the errors multiply.

611
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:54,933
And then it struck me that we're in a 
situation where the error bars out 50 

612
00:30:59,711 --> 00:31:03,580
years or so wide that even if we did 
what people recommended now,

613
00:31:03,581 --> 00:31:07,810
we could never be sure that it actually 
worked because you can't,

614
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,993
the,
the propagation of error across all 

615
00:31:10,571 --> 00:31:13,870
those decades makes the picture so 
blurry two or three,

616
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:14,704
four decades down the road that there's 
no way of garnering evidence about the 

617
00:31:18,101 --> 00:31:21,160
effectiveness of your intervention.
And if it's a high cost intervention,

618
00:31:21,161 --> 00:31:22,900
that seems to be a really bad idea.

619
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,251
So,
okay.

620
00:31:24,251 --> 00:31:25,084
So,
and I'm going to step one more step 

621
00:31:25,961 --> 00:31:26,830
backwards,
which is,

622
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:28,443
so
I also found it difficult to trust the 

623
00:31:32,471 --> 00:31:33,304
climate science.
And the reason for that was that it 

624
00:31:35,321 --> 00:31:38,470
struck me as motivated by,
um,

625
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:39,723
issues in la,
at least in some part that were outside 

626
00:31:42,821 --> 00:31:43,654
of the science.
It seems to me that a tremendous amount 

627
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:52,050
of what motivates people's psychological
commitment to the idea of climate change

628
00:31:52,051 --> 00:31:52,884
is an underlying,
something like an underlying anti 

629
00:31:54,591 --> 00:31:55,424
western or anticapitalist ethos.
And that the idea is that we should 

630
00:32:00,221 --> 00:32:03,850
restrict growth and we should 
restructure the economic system and that

631
00:32:03,851 --> 00:32:06,370
would address climate change.
And that would be a positive thing.

632
00:32:06,371 --> 00:32:07,204
And it's forced all the apocalypse.
But the real goal seems to be more to 

633
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:11,344
find an ethical justification for the 
political position that requires the 

634
00:32:14,111 --> 00:32:17,260
retooling of these economic systems.
And so,

635
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,780
so,
well,

636
00:32:19,781 --> 00:32:22,930
I guess the first thing I'd like to know
is what you,

637
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,990
does that strike you as a reasonable 
argument?

638
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,123
Cause I can't see otherwise why people 
would be objecting to what it is that 

639
00:32:29,621 --> 00:32:32,530
you're doing now.
So there's,

640
00:32:32,531 --> 00:32:36,430
there's a lot of questions and then let,
don't unpack some of those.

641
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,330
Uh,
so,

642
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,860
so we,
I think

643
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,000
if you look out,
yes,

644
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,620
there's a lot of uncertainty,
uh,

645
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,050
going forward.
Um,

646
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:46,580
some of that actually cancels out when 
you were saying,

647
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,593
well,
we're uncertain about how much the 

648
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:49,034
temperature rise will be,
but we do know that it's a causal 

649
00:32:51,081 --> 00:32:54,140
mechanism is CEO to lead to higher 
warming.

650
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,290
If you take some of the Sio two hours,
you will get less of it.

651
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:01,250
Now we don't exactly know how much,
where you get less,

652
00:33:01,251 --> 00:33:02,084
whether it was a lot down here a little 
bit or whether it was here in down a 

653
00:33:05,281 --> 00:33:06,114
little bit,
but did you actually get a little bit 

654
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:08,243
the same thing?
So you can take some of the error bars 

655
00:33:10,551 --> 00:33:12,770
up because you're only looking at the 
difference,

656
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:13,933
uh,
and you're not actually looking at the 

657
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,740
actual input.
Uh,

658
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:20,480
the other thing I,
I'm in no doubt that there's a lot of,

659
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,353
you know,
other reasons why people latch on to 

660
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,710
social phenomena.

661
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,131
So,
you know,

662
00:33:25,131 --> 00:33:25,964
when,
when some climate scientists say we 

663
00:33:27,351 --> 00:33:31,100
should cut carbon emissions because this
is leading to a really dangerous issue,

664
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,870
there's a lot of other people who will 
see,

665
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,150
oh,
that actually fits with my ideological,

666
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,070
a priest,
the substation.

667
00:33:37,071 --> 00:33:38,840
So I'll actually join in,
uh,

668
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,430
in this,
in this conversation.

669
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:42,770
I think that happens in a lot of 
different areas.

670
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:43,983
Uh,
tried to do is to sort of step back and 

671
00:33:46,521 --> 00:33:46,821
say,
look,

672
00:33:46,821 --> 00:33:50,450
I'm not going to get into all of that.
I'm simply taking as the starting point.

673
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,470
We're,
we're economist.

674
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,360
I'm actually not,
I'm a political scientist,

675
00:33:53,361 --> 00:33:55,070
but all the people I work with,
our economists,

676
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:59,870
we just take as given what the climate 
scientists are telling us.

677
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,520
I think it's a,
it's a,

678
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,440
it's an interesting conversation and 
say,

679
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,540
did they actually get it somewhat wrong?
Um,

680
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,910
and I think certainly,
you know,

681
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,360
somebody should be looking into it.

682
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,450
But you know,
I,

683
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,260
I've met a lot of these climate 
scientists.

684
00:34:12,261 --> 00:34:14,270
My sense is that they're good,
hardworking,

685
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:15,283
you know,
scientists are actually trying to find 

686
00:34:16,731 --> 00:34:17,564
out what's the up and down in this area.
So we said we'd take our starting point 

687
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:21,943
with you and climate panel.
What we do is we ask how much will it 

688
00:34:26,091 --> 00:34:31,091
cost to cut carbon emissions so much 
that we will see a significant change in

689
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:35,240
temperature.
And of course remember we emit co2,

690
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:38,150
not because we want to bother Al Gore,
anyone one else.

691
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,103
It's a byproduct of having a life that 
is incredibly much nicer than one we 

692
00:34:44,721 --> 00:34:47,420
would have if we didn't have access to a
lot of energy.

693
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:50,570
I mean we can sit and talk here across 
the continent,

694
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,583
but also you have heating and cooling 
and a fertilizer that subsidize I 

695
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,083
official fertilizer.
It basically feeds half the world's 

696
00:34:59,091 --> 00:34:59,924
population and a lot of other benefits 
that come from mostly using fossil 

697
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:03,980
fuels.

698
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:07,240
So if you want to get rid of some of 
those fossil fuels and pot,

699
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,113
possibly all of them,
you will have to replace it with more 

700
00:35:10,281 --> 00:35:12,120
expensive,
uh,

701
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,800
energy.
And that's why it costs to cut corporate

702
00:35:15,801 --> 00:35:18,140
emissions.
Now that may be worth the cost,

703
00:35:18,141 --> 00:35:18,974
but that's exactly the question that we 
tried to ask and that's what William 

704
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:22,683
Nordhaus,
the Nobel laureate and the climate 

705
00:35:23,631 --> 00:35:27,440
economics and many of us fast.
And so it's really important.

706
00:35:27,441 --> 00:35:30,620
It's really important to note that 
you're not questioning the science as it

707
00:35:30,621 --> 00:35:31,454
stands now.
It's so that this is purely a 

708
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,090
consequences,
economic calculation.

709
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,070
This is,
this is only a bad thing.

710
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:37,973
Good co2 impacts warming,
and it does so in the way that the UN 

711
00:35:42,091 --> 00:35:43,620
climate panel tells us.
Now,

712
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,483
that's not entirely true because there's
a lot of things that they tell us and 

713
00:35:47,641 --> 00:35:50,140
there's a whole variability and we tried
to take that into account,

714
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,190
but honestly it turns out that if you do
it on the central estimates,

715
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,620
you get pretty much what I'm about to 
tell you.

716
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:59,220
So what you find is if you cut carbon 
emissions,

717
00:35:59,221 --> 00:36:02,940
now you can have a little bit of impact 
in a hundred years,

718
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:07,770
but it will have a significant cost.
Now it's not going to put us to the poor

719
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:08,604
house that nobody's talking about that 
just like we're not talking about the 

720
00:36:11,191 --> 00:36:12,024
end of the world.
If we don't do something about climate 

721
00:36:13,261 --> 00:36:14,094
change,
we're not talking about the end of the 

722
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:16,104
world.
If we do something about climate change 

723
00:36:17,191 --> 00:36:19,650
drivers.
So I want to sort of dial it back on the

724
00:36:19,651 --> 00:36:21,360
rhetoric,
both from the alarmists that say,

725
00:36:21,361 --> 00:36:22,860
oh my God,
the world is coming to an end.

726
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,600
Or the people who are saying,
oh,

727
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,700
we can't afford this.
And we all going to the poor house.

728
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:28,810
If you want to have solar panels and 
wind turbines.

729
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:33,020
These are both manageable costs,
thesis sort of in the order,

730
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:33,933
you know,
two to 4% but the problem is that if we 

731
00:36:37,021 --> 00:36:37,854
do sort of things that cost one to 2% of
GDP right now and for the rest of the 

732
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,600
century,
we basically solve almost no,

733
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,870
no part of the global warming problem.

734
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:49,703
We'd probably saw about 1% of it.
So basically by incurring a cost of one 

735
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:57,780
to 2% of GDP now and every year 
throughout the rest of the century,

736
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:58,763
you will have solved almost none of the 
problem come 2100 so you still have to 

737
00:37:03,391 --> 00:37:07,740
pay all the same problems that global 
warming is as encouraging,

738
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:12,420
minus a slight amount and then you paid 
one to 2% every year.

739
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:17,780
That's the basic idea of why most cost 
benefit analysis show that unless you do

740
00:37:18,121 --> 00:37:22,920
it very carefully and only do a little 
bit of cutting and do it really smartly,

741
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:27,300
you're actually incurring higher costs 
than the problem you're trying to solve.

742
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:31,320
So we can thread the needle and do 
really carefully,

743
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:34,230
but that requires a lot of smartness 
from a lot of politicians.

744
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,513
But if we do it really bluntly,
we're just going to incur lots of costs 

745
00:37:38,251 --> 00:37:40,050
to actually not get very many benefits.

746
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:40,913
Okay.
So when the people who are not happy 

747
00:37:42,841 --> 00:37:43,674
with you for not prioritizing climate 
change to the degree that it should be 

748
00:37:46,471 --> 00:37:47,304
hypothetically,
like how do they criticize your 

749
00:37:51,151 --> 00:37:51,984
statements?
Like on what basis do they decide that 

750
00:37:54,211 --> 00:37:57,120
your conclusions are inappropriate?
I think,

751
00:37:57,121 --> 00:37:57,954
I mean if you read most of the Internet,
there is a lot of things they'll just 

752
00:38:00,931 --> 00:38:01,201
say,
oh,

753
00:38:01,201 --> 00:38:02,880
you're a denier.
You can't say that.

754
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:05,430
It's sort of we're going to 
excommunicate you.

755
00:38:05,431 --> 00:38:07,170
We don't want to talk to you.
That's not right.

756
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:07,781
Uh,
I'm,

757
00:38:07,781 --> 00:38:10,470
I'm not really going to talk about those
people because that's just,

758
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:11,323
yeah,
that's political posturing that rather 

759
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:15,300
than anything else,
I think there's a reasonable argument to

760
00:38:15,301 --> 00:38:19,560
be made to say that's not the only way 
that you can approach this.

761
00:38:19,561 --> 00:38:22,800
So there's two ways you can think about 
cost benefit analysis,

762
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:26,580
actually showing that climate impacts 
are worth doing.

763
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,280
One is to say,
ah,

764
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,900
but there might be a tiny risk,
even just a tiny risk to the whole world

765
00:38:33,901 --> 00:38:36,580
is going to spin out of control and 
we're all going to die kind of thing.

766
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,250
And you know,
that's not implausible.

767
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:43,000
Especially if you say sort of,
I'm not going to put a percentage on it,

768
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,220
but it's not,
it's greater than zero.

769
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,433
So there's a non zero chance that global
warming will spin out of control and 

770
00:38:49,811 --> 00:38:50,800
we'll basically,
it'd be,

771
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,150
you know,
rally get a few,

772
00:38:52,151 --> 00:38:52,984
couple a hundred couples of,
of humans living on an ice free Arctic 

773
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,353
as well.
That's a positive feedback loop 

774
00:38:58,901 --> 00:38:59,800
argument,
right?

775
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:00,634
That we might trigger mechanisms like 
the melting of the greenland ice sheet 

776
00:39:03,281 --> 00:39:05,890
for example,
that would flood the world or cause some

777
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:09,520
irreparable catastrophe of unparalleled 
magnitude.

778
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:10,240
Okay.
So,

779
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,990
so I have a question about that because 
that's a tricky one to address,

780
00:39:13,991 --> 00:39:14,200
right?

781
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,410
That's kind of an apocalyptic argument.
And then the argument would be,

782
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,543
well,
if there's a 1% chance of an infinite 

783
00:39:19,811 --> 00:39:20,644
apocalypse,
it's worth any donation of resources to 

784
00:39:22,631 --> 00:39:23,464
stave it off.
So one way of thinking about that is 

785
00:39:27,401 --> 00:39:32,401
actually to multiply the catastrophes 
because my suspicions are that that same

786
00:39:33,131 --> 00:39:33,964
argument could be used in relationship 
to a lot of the other problems that you 

787
00:39:38,201 --> 00:39:39,034
are trying to address.
Like I don't know what the probability 

788
00:39:42,101 --> 00:39:42,934
is that if we keep a substantial number 
of people in abject poverty over the 

789
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:48,730
next 20 years,
let's say more than we'd have to,

790
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:53,430
that we would increase the probability 
of the generation of um,

791
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,550
um,
epidemic and infectious diseases because

792
00:39:57,551 --> 00:40:01,690
poverty,
poor people are risk to everyone in this

793
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,700
court is a horrible way of thinking 
about it.

794
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:06,970
But poverty is a risk to everyone.
That's a better way of thinking about it

795
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:07,804
because decreased global human health,
it's also a breeding ground for all 

796
00:40:11,591 --> 00:40:13,330
sorts of catastrophes that might emerge.

797
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,163
And then there's also the possibility of
political instability and a nuclear war 

798
00:40:18,071 --> 00:40:21,130
and all of those things that are also 
equally apocalyptic.

799
00:40:21,131 --> 00:40:21,964
So it's,
it seems to me to be reasonable to some 

800
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:25,090
degree to say,
look,

801
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:26,763
there's the possibility across a wide 
range of potential crises of unforeseen 

802
00:40:30,491 --> 00:40:32,980
positive feedback loops spiraling out of
control.

803
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:35,260
But we can't introduce them into the 
argument less.

804
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:38,010
We can parameterize them because all it,
it,

805
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:38,863
it's,
it's an unfair game move in some sense 

806
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,270
because you can't be not wrong about 
that.

807
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,050
You can exactly.
And,

808
00:40:45,051 --> 00:40:45,884
and,
and you're,

809
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,230
you're basically saying,
if you allow it in,

810
00:40:48,231 --> 00:40:50,500
in this area,
just because you like that,

811
00:40:50,501 --> 00:40:51,334
cause they go there a area and say,
I want you to focus more money on my 

812
00:40:54,101 --> 00:40:55,450
thing,
which is climate change.

813
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,570
You could equally well do it in all 
kinds of other areas.

814
00:40:58,571 --> 00:41:00,910
And I actually think you can make your 
argument even stronger.

815
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,760
It's just not,
it's not just the poverty sort of breeds

816
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:04,594
a lot of risks,
but it's also that they breed terrorism 

817
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,090
and willingness to,
you know,

818
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:10,690
uh,
do a lot of bad things and you know,

819
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:11,643
focused.
So it's not just something that happens 

820
00:41:13,091 --> 00:41:13,920
but you know,
uh,

821
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,753
threatened by terrorists and our ability
to keep all the plutonium in the world 

822
00:41:18,611 --> 00:41:19,990
under,
under law and,

823
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:20,883
and you know,
you can get catastrophe from anything 

824
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:25,860
nor Canto App.
So abject poverty for example.

825
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:29,260
You could imagine that there might be 
two socioeconomic contributions to that.

826
00:41:29,261 --> 00:41:30,094
There would be the absolute number of 
people in abject poverty who are 

827
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:33,763
therefore desperate.
And then there would also be maybe 

828
00:41:35,691 --> 00:41:36,524
another contribution of excess 
inequality and a sense that the world 

829
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:44,810
isn't laying itself out fairly and that 
that would justify political,

830
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:45,883
political and revolutionary and 
stability and also a state failure and 

831
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:53,380
many other things that we know make it a
lot easier for everyone to,

832
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:57,080
to make really bad things like we saw 
out of Afghanistan,

833
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:00,380
uh,
with nine 11 and a lot of other things.

834
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,040
You know,
once you,

835
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,770
once you get failed states,
you get a lot of bad things happen.

836
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,233
We try to make people better off.
We tried to make people federoff 

837
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,780
globally so that we decrease the 
probability of,

838
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,040
of large scale political instinct,
political and economic instability.

839
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,710
And that's another way of staving off an
apocalypse.

840
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:16,821
Yes.
Okay.

841
00:42:16,821 --> 00:42:19,540
And then on,
can I just say,

842
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,610
so northouse actually looked at this,
they know about Lauren,

843
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,553
uh,
because some people aren't exactly what 

844
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:25,454
you said.
There's a tiny risk that things go 

845
00:42:26,991 --> 00:42:27,741
really,
really bad.

846
00:42:27,741 --> 00:42:30,290
So we should spend all of our money on 
this issue.

847
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,590
But of course that's a failed argument 
because likewise,

848
00:42:33,591 --> 00:42:36,560
there's a lot of small risks everywhere 
else.

849
00:42:36,561 --> 00:42:41,561
We know one risk which is being hit by 
an asteroid that could wipe out the uh,

850
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,860
the earth yet.
And Nordhaus did that.

851
00:42:44,861 --> 00:42:46,370
I thought that was very,
very elegant.

852
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,563
Uh,
we know that we can track all of those 

853
00:42:50,271 --> 00:42:51,104
asteroids out there,
99.99% but we chose to only track 90% 

854
00:42:57,081 --> 00:42:59,300
because tracking the rest was too 
expensive.

855
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:00,583
So you can actually see that we put a 
price on how much are we willing to do 

856
00:43:04,071 --> 00:43:04,851
this.
And of course,

857
00:43:04,851 --> 00:43:05,684
that's just one place where we have a 
very clear example that we say we cast 

858
00:43:09,551 --> 00:43:12,980
somewhat for the future,
but we don't care about it entirely.

859
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,190
We have lots of other issues that we 
want to focus on right now.

860
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:20,510
So that's every other area you have to 
rq,

861
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:24,560
what is the risks and what are the 
opportunity to do this?

862
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,573
And absolutely,
given that there are some risks and 

863
00:43:27,531 --> 00:43:30,530
they're probably more downside risk than
upside risk for global warming,

864
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:33,620
we should probably do a little more than
what we would otherwise do.

865
00:43:33,621 --> 00:43:35,330
And that's exactly what the model show 
us.

866
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:36,343
And those are the models that we use in 
making the estimate of how much should 

867
00:43:39,111 --> 00:43:41,810
you be paying for global warming.
So yes,

868
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:44,720
we should take that into account,
but it's not a good argument.

869
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:46,130
That was,
that was one argument.

870
00:43:46,131 --> 00:43:46,760
I'm sorry,
I'll,

871
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,680
I'll try to be a little with the other 
argument.

872
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:49,813
The other argument is that people will 
say one of the reasons why it doesn't 

873
00:43:53,151 --> 00:43:56,270
pay to do global warming,
it is because you have to pay now,

874
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,240
but the benefits come far up into the 
future.

875
00:43:59,241 --> 00:44:00,074
So basically you do something now that's
fairly costly and then you get a tiny 

876
00:44:03,111 --> 00:44:03,944
benefit in a hundred years.
So you have to really say the future's 

877
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:12,410
incredibly important economic speak.
That is that the discount is really low.

878
00:44:12,411 --> 00:44:13,244
They really care a lot about the future.
Now a lot of people would argue we 

879
00:44:17,001 --> 00:44:17,520
should,
you know,

880
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,353
we're rich,
we should be able to care enormously 

881
00:44:20,931 --> 00:44:21,770
about the future.

882
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:22,843
And if you change that parameter enough 
and you say we care enormously about 

883
00:44:25,971 --> 00:44:26,804
future generations,
it actually turns out that global 

884
00:44:29,151 --> 00:44:30,740
warming becomes a good deal.
You know,

885
00:44:30,741 --> 00:44:33,000
doing something about global warming 
actually becomes,

886
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:33,834
goes from,
you know,

887
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:37,560
saying you spend a dollar and you do a 
couple of cents of climate damage to,

888
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,453
sorry to avoid climate damage,
you actually spend a dollar and you 

889
00:44:40,651 --> 00:44:45,360
might do $2 of climate benefits.
So it actually turns it into good idea.

890
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,560
But here's the kicker.
If you care that much about the future,

891
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:54,540
you change every other one of all of 
these priorities and make them Whoa,

892
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:55,463
right?
Because we're obviously happens is 

893
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:59,490
you've just said,
I care so much about the future that the

894
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:03,960
guy that I will save from not having 
tuberculosis and dying from it tomorrow,

895
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,240
we'll now go on to have a successful 
life.

896
00:45:06,241 --> 00:45:09,030
His kids will live longer,
they'll do better,

897
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,330
he will have a better,
his nation will do better.

898
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:15,480
That means there'll be much,
much better off in 2100 and so on.

899
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:16,583
And that means that this is no longer a 
question of saying you spend it all in 

900
00:45:19,631 --> 00:45:22,710
you to $43 worth of goods,
but you spend it all,

901
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,553
you $1,000 worth of goods.
So what you've achieved as basically 

902
00:45:27,631 --> 00:45:28,464
just make everything a great idea.
That's also intellectually what making 

903
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,350
the discount rate very,
very small.

904
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:37,200
What it means is you should basically 
starve.

905
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,213
You should just eat porch every day and 
spend all of the rest of your money on 

906
00:45:42,151 --> 00:45:44,940
the future because you care so much 
about it right now.

907
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:46,050
If you do that,
I,

908
00:45:46,051 --> 00:45:49,140
I applaud your are sort of your,
your consistency,

909
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,273
but most people just don't do this and 
we certainly don't do this in the way 

910
00:45:52,801 --> 00:45:53,270
that,
you know,

911
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:55,890
we don't seem to care all that much 
about our pension systems,

912
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:59,700
which are in many rich countries got to 
fail in the next 20 to 40 years.

913
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:02,950
All these other issues.
So as long as you were saying no,

914
00:46:02,951 --> 00:46:03,450
no,
no,

915
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:06,030
what you're really saying then is on 
climate.

916
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:06,923
We want to care a lot about the future,
but we don't want to do it in all other 

917
00:46:09,241 --> 00:46:09,960
areas.
Okay.

918
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:10,793
You're going to be consistent.
You need to do it across all areas and 

919
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:14,980
then you need to be very hungry and only
parch.

920
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:15,601
Right.
Okay.

921
00:46:15,601 --> 00:46:16,434
So your claim basically from a 
methodological perspective is that your 

922
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,900
rank ordering remains constant across 
variable discount rates.

923
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,251
Yes.
Right.

924
00:46:23,251 --> 00:46:24,900
And that's a really,
that's a really important,

925
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:25,763
that's a really fundamentally important.
It's not until I got to say it does 

926
00:46:29,311 --> 00:46:32,310
change some of these because obviously,
you know,

927
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,273
education for instance is one of those 
where you pay now and you'll only get 

928
00:46:35,761 --> 00:46:36,594
benefits 10 20,
50 years out when the kids grow up in 

929
00:46:39,081 --> 00:46:40,500
the actual become much more productive.

930
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,513
So there is a change,
but mostly the rank order ordering 

931
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,233
remains the same.
And I'm simply just insisting that 

932
00:46:46,681 --> 00:46:49,050
people need to be consistent.
You can't just say,

933
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,113
uh,
the future is important when you talk 

934
00:46:51,241 --> 00:46:52,074
about climate.
You have to want to say the future is 

935
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,140
important,
it's important across all areas and then

936
00:46:55,141 --> 00:46:57,300
you really have to do everything and you
know,

937
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:59,510
forego a,
having a good life for yourself.

938
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:00,300
Right,
right.

939
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:00,781
Okay.
Well,

940
00:47:00,781 --> 00:47:01,614
so the other thing that's worthwhile 
pointing out about the discount rate is 

941
00:47:04,051 --> 00:47:04,940
that,
you know,

942
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:08,250
you can make a case that the future is 
more important than the present.

943
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:10,560
Especially cause it's extends out so 
far.

944
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:11,394
But,
but the other reason that people 

945
00:47:12,511 --> 00:47:13,344
discount the future is because you can't
make the case that you can predict the 

946
00:47:17,131 --> 00:47:17,964
outcome of your actions.
And that means that the error in 

947
00:47:20,791 --> 00:47:24,220
prediction magnifies itself as you move 
out farther in timeframe.

948
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:25,103
And so what happens is you get to a 
point where there isn't a lot of point 

949
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,580
in adjusting your behavior in the 
present.

950
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:32,980
If you look like a hundred years out,
let's say,

951
00:47:32,981 --> 00:47:33,814
or a thousand years out,
because you actually can't calculate 

952
00:47:35,801 --> 00:47:38,890
with any accuracy the consequences of 
your actions or inactions.

953
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:40,173
And so the,
the cumulative error makes discounting 

954
00:47:43,061 --> 00:47:43,894
the future,
the appropriate thing to do because you 

955
00:47:45,701 --> 00:47:47,860
can predict what's going to happen if 
you act now,

956
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:51,220
now and maybe tomorrow,
but you get much less accurate as,

957
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,233
as you move forward.
So even in the best case scenario where 

958
00:47:54,611 --> 00:47:55,444
we had the best wishes for the future,
that doesn't mean we could justify 

959
00:47:58,811 --> 00:47:59,644
incredibly radical sacrifices now 
because we can't calculate their 

960
00:48:01,781 --> 00:48:03,360
cumulative impact.
No.

961
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,550
Uh,
there's,

962
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:05,383
there's a good,
there's a good way of thinking about 

963
00:48:06,701 --> 00:48:07,240
this.
You know,

964
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,690
if you look at what previous generations
has done for us,

965
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:11,853
the only thing that they really managed 
to do is to give us a lot more 

966
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:15,394
knowledge.

967
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,293
So investment in knowledge is actually a
great way to help future generations 

968
00:48:19,421 --> 00:48:23,110
because it helped them in all kinds of 
ways and we can't really predict how,

969
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:25,930
but it's probably a good idea to leave 
them with a lot of books.

970
00:48:25,931 --> 00:48:28,150
I'm,
I'm using that as a metaphor,

971
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:29,253
but trying to help them in a specific 
way in matching back a hundred years 

972
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:36,070
ago,
our forefathers back in the 1920s,

973
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:41,550
no 1910s would have,
would have done reasonably to help us.

974
00:48:41,831 --> 00:48:44,470
Now,
chances are they would have wasted a lot

975
00:48:44,471 --> 00:48:47,050
of money on things that never turn into 
problems.

976
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:49,060
There's a wonderful book called today 
now,

977
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,890
uh,
sorry.

978
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:55,390
Oh God,
I'm forgetting now.

979
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:58,060
Oh God.
Anyway,

980
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:01,990
it has a great and clever title,
which I've clearly screwed up now,

981
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:06,310
but it was back in 1893.
Uh,

982
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:06,881
the,
uh,

983
00:49:06,881 --> 00:49:08,920
the world's fair in Chicago,
I believe,

984
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:09,963
ask 50 of the world's smartest people to
predict what would the world look like 

985
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:14,470
in a hundred years.

986
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:17,200
And so all of them,
first star said,

987
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:19,090
you know,
I love the fact that I'm not going to be

988
00:49:19,091 --> 00:49:21,940
around when this prediction comes true 
or not.

989
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,460
Uh,
but then they made all their predictions

990
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,990
and they were almost entirely off.
Yeah.

991
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:27,853
There's some pretty close or you know,
there's one that it predicted sort of 

992
00:49:31,121 --> 00:49:34,840
email in the sense that you know,
those [inaudible] and then up,

993
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:38,920
I can't pronounce that pneumatics 
pneumatic tubes.

994
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:41,890
Yup.
Which has sent away and it would sort of

995
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,060
suck it out.
And so you could send a letter somewhere

996
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,590
they imagined that that would be a 
worldwide thing.

997
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,720
And so you could actually send a letter 
everywhere.

998
00:49:49,721 --> 00:49:51,700
You just sort of put it in the very,
very long tube,

999
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:55,360
which is kind of right.
And you can sort of say,

1000
00:49:55,361 --> 00:49:55,991
yeah,
yeah,

1001
00:49:55,991 --> 00:49:57,520
that's not entirely wrong.
You know,

1002
00:49:57,550 --> 00:49:59,950
got the whole technology wrong,
but the right idea.

1003
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:01,443
But the fundamental point is we are 
probably wrong about so many things as 

1004
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:05,584
you say,
that I am to help the world in the 

1005
00:50:08,141 --> 00:50:09,520
future by,
for instance,

1006
00:50:09,521 --> 00:50:14,290
cutting temperature might be one of the 
least effective ways of helping also.

1007
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:17,080
So there's another thing that's 
interesting about that.

1008
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:22,000
I think that speaks to the fundamental 
intelligence of your approach.

1009
00:50:22,001 --> 00:50:27,001
So one of the things that has struck me 
as highly likely is that given complex

1010
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:32,600
things are and how rapidly they're 
changing that the best thing we could do

1011
00:50:32,601 --> 00:50:36,290
to prepare ourselves for the future 
would be to make better people,

1012
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,720
smarter people,
wiser people,

1013
00:50:38,721 --> 00:50:40,310
more responsible people,
all of that.

1014
00:50:40,311 --> 00:50:42,200
So there's a psychological element to 
that.

1015
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:43,483
And so I would say some of my work has 
concentrated on that and the public 

1016
00:50:46,821 --> 00:50:47,654
lectures that I've been doing.
But what's interesting about your 

1017
00:50:49,551 --> 00:50:50,384
approach,
the economic approaches that you're 

1018
00:50:51,801 --> 00:50:52,634
diverting a lot of resources to the 
creation of better people for tomorrow 

1019
00:50:56,691 --> 00:50:59,660
by investing,
especially in in childhood nutrition.

1020
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:00,733
So if you,
and I suppose this is kind of how we 

1021
00:51:02,971 --> 00:51:03,804
economists look at the world,
but maybe biologists could look at it 

1022
00:51:05,481 --> 00:51:06,314
this way too.
If you think of people as general 

1023
00:51:08,241 --> 00:51:11,380
problem solving machines,
which is not a bad way of thinking about

1024
00:51:11,381 --> 00:51:12,214
us,
then it might be that given that you 

1025
00:51:14,061 --> 00:51:16,550
don't know which problems are going to 
be paramount,

1026
00:51:16,551 --> 00:51:19,790
what you want to do is improve the 
machines that will solve the problems,

1027
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,470
whatever those problems happen to be.

1028
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:26,800
And so that investment in early 
childhood development seems particularly

1029
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,490
Apropos in that regard.
And so having said that,

1030
00:51:31,491 --> 00:51:32,324
I want to return to the climate issue 
one more time because here's something 

1031
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:37,970
peculiar.
This is something I don't understand.

1032
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:39,373
It's a real mystery.
So let's say that just for the sake of 

1033
00:51:42,291 --> 00:51:43,124
argument,
that most of the people who are 

1034
00:51:44,031 --> 00:51:44,864
concerned about climate change and its 
relationship to economic development or 

1035
00:51:47,901 --> 00:51:51,050
on the left side of the spectrum,
okay,

1036
00:51:51,051 --> 00:51:52,970
but led,
and let's also say that those who are on

1037
00:51:52,971 --> 00:51:53,804
the left side of the spectrum are 
hypothetically also concerned with the 

1038
00:51:57,081 --> 00:51:57,914
economic wellbeing of the most 
dispossessed and that those might be 

1039
00:52:01,461 --> 00:52:04,580
equally important concerns and their 
integrity locked together.

1040
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,713
Well,
the strange thing about so many of your 

1041
00:52:07,461 --> 00:52:08,294
recommendations is that they're directly
aimed at addressing the immediate now 

1042
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,190
concerns of the fundamentally 
dispossessed.

1043
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:17,383
And so you'd think that that,
that's part of the reason that I can't 

1044
00:52:19,671 --> 00:52:20,504
understand why there's so much objection
to your methods because it's not like 

1045
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:26,323
what you came up with looks like support
for something that's like a right wing 

1046
00:52:30,051 --> 00:52:32,180
agenda by any stretch of the 
imagination.

1047
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:33,321
I mean,
first of all,

1048
00:52:33,321 --> 00:52:36,770
it's predicated on the idea that there's
a certain amount of development aid,

1049
00:52:36,771 --> 00:52:39,680
especially directed to children.
You said not exclusively.

1050
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:43,640
There would be of great use.
And it seems to me to be undeniable that

1051
00:52:43,641 --> 00:52:44,474
the most dispossessed people in the 
world are impoverished infants of 

1052
00:52:48,291 --> 00:52:50,480
impoverished people.
So,

1053
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:51,733
so what if some of the objections to 
what you're doing are ideologically 

1054
00:52:56,421 --> 00:52:58,910
motivated?
Why doesn't that cancel it out?

1055
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:02,540
As a good question and I don't quite 
understand it.

1056
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,030
My sense is that in some ways,
so,

1057
00:53:05,031 --> 00:53:05,680
so,
uh,

1058
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,920
I was in New York in September.
Uh,

1059
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:08,550
there was,
uh,

1060
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:12,020
uh,
the first I heard a summit at the UN,

1061
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,360
uh,
for tuberculosis and I was there because

1062
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:15,194
one of the things that we've identified 
as this is a great investment and of 

1063
00:53:17,991 --> 00:53:19,710
course all the tugboats,
tuberculosis,

1064
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,810
people love us because,
you know,

1065
00:53:20,811 --> 00:53:23,270
we're finding out you should spend more 
money on their problem.

1066
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,830
Um,
and,

1067
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:26,040
and almost

1068
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,270
nobody went.
Uh,

1069
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:30,210
I wrote a,
an orbit together with the South African

1070
00:53:30,211 --> 00:53:33,660
health minister and it was widely 
published in the developing world,

1071
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,540
but almost no one in the developed world
picked it up.

1072
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:37,643
It was only when I wrote and other offit
where I said there were two meetings 

1073
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:43,590
taking place in the New York.
One was this TV place where,

1074
00:53:43,591 --> 00:53:45,780
you know,
biggest infectious disease killer in the

1075
00:53:45,781 --> 00:53:47,580
world.
We're almost nobody turned up.

1076
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:49,140
And then those,
the other meeting,

1077
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,153
uh,
which macron and the French president 

1078
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:55,110
and uh,
Bloomberg and others attended to,

1079
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:58,140
which was the climate summit,
which everybody attended to.

1080
00:53:58,830 --> 00:53:59,663
He sort of pointed out the disparity and
then it was picked up in all kinds of 

1081
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:05,970
developed country,
pick the papers.

1082
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:08,190
I think fundamentally it goes down to 
saying,

1083
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:11,670
while everybody says they care a lot 
about the world's poor,

1084
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:16,970
the reality is that you care somewhat 
for but most rich,

1085
00:54:18,211 --> 00:54:21,960
well meaning people probably care a lot 
more about the fact that they worry that

1086
00:54:21,961 --> 00:54:22,794
their kids might be in a position where 
global warming is really going to 

1087
00:54:25,351 --> 00:54:27,460
undermine even that.

1088
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,193
Because look,
we already established the fact that 

1089
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:32,243
there's equal reason to be 
apocalyptically concerned about uncheck 

1090
00:54:35,671 --> 00:54:40,671
poverty and inequality.
So this is why I suggested to begin with

1091
00:54:40,681 --> 00:54:41,514
that.
The one of the lovely things about the 

1092
00:54:43,021 --> 00:54:43,854
idea of climate change is that it,
it really justifies the idea of 

1093
00:54:46,801 --> 00:54:50,160
overthrowing the current system or of 
undermining the current system.

1094
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,533
And that if you're inclined to do that 
rather than inclined to truly help the 

1095
00:54:54,841 --> 00:54:56,040
dispossessed,
let's say,

1096
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,293
then you'd be more inclined to support a
theory that justifies that sort of 

1097
00:55:00,541 --> 00:55:03,150
radical,
let's say interventionists policy.

1098
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,313
And I can't see a way out of that 
logically given that the work that 

1099
00:55:07,981 --> 00:55:08,814
you're doing on tuberculosis is a great 
example is directly and Evett 

1100
00:55:13,170 --> 00:55:14,003
evidentially associated with a market 
increase in the wellbeing of the 

1101
00:55:18,511 --> 00:55:19,344
dispossessed.
And so you'd think that they would 

1102
00:55:21,961 --> 00:55:24,300
attract the proper amount of ideological
attention,

1103
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:25,410
but it doesn't.

1104
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,750
And that's,
that's a great mystery.

1105
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:30,740
There's something about that 
extraordinarily good and it's as,

1106
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:31,623
it's a good point and,
and I think you have a consistent 

1107
00:55:34,321 --> 00:55:35,190
argument.
The,

1108
00:55:35,191 --> 00:55:36,024
the thing that I've,
I've decided a long time ago that I 

1109
00:55:38,371 --> 00:55:41,730
don't want to argue and I think that's 
probably the difference between,

1110
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:44,490
of being more psychologically focused.
I don't want to argue,

1111
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,610
I think might be people's,
uh,

1112
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,473
sort of inner motivations.
I want to actually take them on face 

1113
00:55:50,911 --> 00:55:51,744
value.
And you know,

1114
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,490
many people I meet,
they say,

1115
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:56,850
I worry a lot about climate change.
I worry a lot about the world's poor.

1116
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:59,220
And then I try to show them,
well,

1117
00:55:59,221 --> 00:56:00,054
if you actually do that,
why the hell would you be focusing on 

1118
00:56:02,071 --> 00:56:02,904
spending lots of money?
They'll almost to no good instead of 

1119
00:56:04,801 --> 00:56:05,634
spending possibly less money.
And during the fall you about more and 

1120
00:56:09,421 --> 00:56:10,254
it creates some cognitive dissonance and
I think it switches people a little bit 

1121
00:56:14,821 --> 00:56:16,440
towards spending smarter.

1122
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:17,730
But yes,
you're right.

1123
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:21,300
But telecall ignorance,
you know,

1124
00:56:21,301 --> 00:56:26,080
it's like what you're doing is pretty 
new and it takes a long time.

1125
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:27,520
I mean it's not new for you,
what,

1126
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:31,150
it's not new considering the span of a 
single lifetime,

1127
00:56:31,151 --> 00:56:31,984
but you know,
what you're doing is very radical in 

1128
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,010
some sense.
There is,

1129
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:39,100
and there isn't anybody else doing it.
And so it might own,

1130
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:39,963
it might be that will take 20 years or 
25 years or something like that for the 

1131
00:56:43,181 --> 00:56:44,014
approach that you're
publicizing and have developed to for 

1132
00:56:48,431 --> 00:56:50,950
people to actually know about it,
you know?

1133
00:56:50,951 --> 00:56:52,480
And so what,
what did they say?

1134
00:56:52,481 --> 00:56:55,180
You should assume ignorance instead of 
malevolence when you can.

1135
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:58,120
I do think that ignorance is a part of 
this.

1136
00:56:58,121 --> 00:56:58,954
It's not obvious to everyone that there 
is this method of rank ordering that 

1137
00:57:02,441 --> 00:57:03,274
people have done it and,
and that there are consequences to that 

1138
00:57:05,381 --> 00:57:07,870
that could be laid out in an intelligent
economic plan.

1139
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:08,631
You know,
and I,

1140
00:57:08,631 --> 00:57:09,464
I know that it takes a finding in the 
scientific literature if it's going to 

1141
00:57:13,181 --> 00:57:16,780
make its way into the public,
something approximating 15 years.

1142
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:21,070
And that's only the ones that actually 
do manage to make it.

1143
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:22,383
And so it could be that just way more 
people need to build what you're doing 

1144
00:57:25,811 --> 00:57:29,200
and why and how it was done before it 
gets the steam going.

1145
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:33,100
I'm interested in the psychological 
issues in part to try to help figure out

1146
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,533
what it would take to motivate people to
be more attentive to the sorts of 

1147
00:57:38,741 --> 00:57:39,574
solutions that you and your people have 
been putting forward and hit and to 

1148
00:57:42,311 --> 00:57:43,720
eliminate those barriers.
But,

1149
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:44,590
but,
uh,

1150
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:46,090
but it could just be,
as I said,

1151
00:57:46,091 --> 00:57:49,180
it could just be ignorance and,
and one of them,

1152
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:51,370
one of the problems that we're facing 
constantly,

1153
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:54,460
and I know why there's no one else doing
this than we,

1154
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:59,740
the weird thing because when you do 
prioritization and you inevitably end up

1155
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:00,603
antagonizing a lot of people,
I mean a climate change is the most 

1156
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:04,330
obvious one.

1157
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:06,130
But for instance,
a sanitation,

1158
00:58:06,131 --> 00:58:07,990
water and sanitation,
huge problem.

1159
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:08,830
Uh,
so you know,

1160
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:09,663
the,
there's two and a half million people 

1161
00:58:10,811 --> 00:58:11,644
affected by this.
One of the points that we emphasizes 

1162
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:16,900
that Dune sanitation,
while a good thing to do,

1163
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:20,530
it probably only pays you back $3 back 
on the dollar.

1164
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:21,453
Why?
Because it's actually fairly costly to 

1165
00:58:23,141 --> 00:58:23,974
do sanitation and also because the 
benefits not nearly as great as what 

1166
00:58:27,551 --> 00:58:28,384
many have assumed and this is new global
burden of disease estimates that the 

1167
00:58:31,511 --> 00:58:32,344
real problem is that what you're doing 
with sanitation is that you're not 

1168
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:37,210
removing fecal matter from the 
environment.

1169
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,193
You simply reducing the amount so you're
not actually having all that much of an 

1170
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,330
impact on the sea shore.
Having a little bit,

1171
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:46,060
but not nearly as much as what we would 
like to say.

1172
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:50,860
That obviously pisses off all the people
who are doing sanitation and we ended up

1173
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:52,180
pissing off a lot of people.

1174
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:57,210
And the truth is I think it's necessary 
if you're going to do this when you rank

1175
00:58:57,431 --> 00:58:58,560
order,
of course the,

1176
00:58:58,630 --> 00:59:00,700
the,
the cost is to come out of top.

1177
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,470
Love it.
And the cost is don't,

1178
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:03,603
don't love it,
but it's also important to make that 

1179
00:59:05,891 --> 00:59:06,730
argument.
And so,

1180
00:59:06,731 --> 00:59:08,400
so at the end of the day,
so I mean,

1181
00:59:08,401 --> 00:59:13,401
my sense is it's necessary to do it,
but it will always entail a great amount

1182
00:59:14,681 --> 00:59:15,514
of,
of sort of,

1183
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:16,720
uh,
anies,

1184
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:17,983
uh,
because it doesn't feel like we're 

1185
00:59:19,871 --> 00:59:20,590
saying,
you know,

1186
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:23,660
Kumbaya and we should do everything,
but we're actually saying,

1187
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:25,460
no,
you should do these things.

1188
00:59:25,461 --> 00:59:27,710
But not all of these things,
although they seem nice,

1189
00:59:27,890 --> 00:59:30,710
they're just not in the same league.
Right,

1190
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:31,460
right,
right,

1191
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:34,040
right.
Well that's,

1192
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:35,413
it would be nice if we could do 
everything good that we possibly could 

1193
00:59:38,031 --> 00:59:40,550
all at once,
but it's not,

1194
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:42,583
it's not realistic because you can't do 
everything at once and you don't have 

1195
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:46,910
infinite resources as we've already 
pointed out.

1196
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,260
So.
Okay.

1197
00:59:48,261 --> 00:59:52,700
So what would you say would be,
if you're going to play devil's advocate

1198
00:59:52,701 --> 00:59:53,534
against your own position,
which I presume you've done a lot of 

1199
00:59:55,281 --> 00:59:59,630
anyways,
what are their criticisms against your,

1200
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:01,063
let's say your,
your aims and your methods that you 

1201
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,620
regard as unresolved?
Like,

1202
01:00:06,621 --> 01:00:11,150
what is it that you're doing that still 
weak and wrong in your own estimation or

1203
01:00:11,151 --> 01:00:11,870
what,
where the,

1204
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:14,130
where the limitations in your methods?
Well,

1205
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:19,040
there's no method does everything.
So we have two very obvious problems.

1206
01:00:19,041 --> 01:00:19,874
One is not all issues is about money.
So we're looking at how do you 

1207
01:00:24,381 --> 01:00:27,350
prioritize money.
But sometimes money is not the issue.

1208
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:30,110
For instance,
on free trade as we talked about before,

1209
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,153
we estimate the benefit is incredible.
But we actually look at the cost as the 

1210
01:00:35,151 --> 01:00:35,984
cost of subsidizing western farmers 
because those are the ones that 

1211
01:00:38,871 --> 01:00:42,410
basically make a killing from not a 
freeing up,

1212
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,940
uh,
Martin global markets.

1213
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:47,570
And those were the ones that usually 
kept held it back.

1214
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:51,290
But what has happened is it has become 
much more sort of an emotional thing.

1215
01:00:51,291 --> 01:00:55,370
It's sort of an identity thing and I'm 
not sure how you would cost that.

1216
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:59,870
So to the extent that things have not 
nothing to do with money,

1217
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:03,290
but they just simply about political 
willingness or interest or,

1218
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:04,430
uh,
what,

1219
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:07,580
uh,
then we are not making the argument,

1220
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,410
uh,
that is going to convince you.

1221
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:13,220
So in some sense we are telling you 
where can you spend money,

1222
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,740
but we're not talking about the things 
that don't require money.

1223
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:17,960
Right?
So people would object that you're,

1224
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:18,853
that the problem with your method is 
that you're measuring everything that 

1225
01:01:21,951 --> 01:01:24,770
can be tangibly measured from an 
economic perspective.

1226
01:01:24,771 --> 01:01:29,540
But that's actually a small fraction of 
the universe of properly attended to.

1227
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:34,040
I would tend to say it's probably sort 
of 70 or 80%.

1228
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:35,780
I'm not quite sure how you'd make that 
up,

1229
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:36,783
but,
but you know,

1230
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:37,993
the biggest,
the biggest policy decisions in most 

1231
01:01:40,011 --> 01:01:42,400
countries is the national budget.
Uh,

1232
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:45,890
it's very clear that that is a very 
substantial part of what we decide.

1233
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,690
How are we going to allocate money?
Well,

1234
01:01:47,691 --> 01:01:49,300
the problem lately,
that's a big issue.

1235
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,170
We don't move.
Not the only issue.

1236
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:51,921
Right?
Well,

1237
01:01:51,921 --> 01:01:54,470
the problem with the objection is that,
well,

1238
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,570
the people who are objecting could be 
right.

1239
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,300
That your methods are narrow.
I mean,

1240
01:01:59,301 --> 01:02:01,370
you're making the case that they're not 
in an arrow as a,

1241
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:01,941
yeah.
As a,

1242
01:02:01,941 --> 01:02:02,774
as a pessimist might assume.
But that puts the onus on them to come 

1243
01:02:05,781 --> 01:02:08,930
up with an alternative way of ranking.
Right?

1244
01:02:08,931 --> 01:02:10,480
I mean,
I would just say we're,

1245
01:02:10,481 --> 01:02:14,240
we're not talking about those last 30% 
that are purely about,

1246
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:15,283
uh,
you know,

1247
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:17,810
should we have transgender bathrooms or 
something?

1248
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:18,733
Yeah,
well that's possibly a bad idea because 

1249
01:02:20,161 --> 01:02:24,030
that actually has cost them and building
a third bathroom or something.

1250
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:24,690
But,
you know,

1251
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:28,230
there's some things that are mostly just
about w what do you think?

1252
01:02:28,231 --> 01:02:30,510
What do you believe?
What are your intuitions?

1253
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:32,940
Uh,
rather than actual costs.

1254
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:36,060
But there's no way of adjudicating 
between those claims.

1255
01:02:36,061 --> 01:02:36,894
That's the problem that all the people 
that he was pushing each other around 

1256
01:02:39,211 --> 01:02:40,130
about them.
If they can't,

1257
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:41,173
with the rational there,
there's still a substantial amount of 

1258
01:02:43,321 --> 01:02:46,470
issues where you do need to look at 
resource allocation.

1259
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,560
And there we have a good argument.
The second part,

1260
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,570
the second sort of criticism,
uh,

1261
01:02:51,571 --> 01:02:55,290
which is a very fair criticism is we 
don't look at inequality.

1262
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:56,693
So economists are very,
very bad at dealing with inequality 

1263
01:02:59,701 --> 01:03:02,010
because fundamentally that's a political
issue.

1264
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:06,420
So when we look at you spend a dollar 
and you do $60 worth of good,

1265
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:09,480
we don't look at who gets that $60.

1266
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:10,733
Now to be fair,
most of the things that she was all you 

1267
01:03:13,351 --> 01:03:14,184
also pointed out,
most of the things that we actually 

1268
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:16,524
indicate are really,
really low hanging fruit of the world 

1269
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:21,900
are things that will help the world's 
pores mostly because the world's poorest

1270
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:23,123
have so many things that they haven't 
gotten that would be hugely beneficial 

1271
01:03:26,041 --> 01:03:26,874
for them.
So it mostly actually help also 

1272
01:03:29,191 --> 01:03:31,440
inequality,
but we don't measure it.

1273
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:32,783
And so we don't actually look at would 
this be a good expenditure in the t in 

1274
01:03:37,941 --> 01:03:40,410
the sense of helping the world's 
poorest,

1275
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:43,320
mostly wood,
but it's not part of our framework.

1276
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:46,430
And there's how me making that.
Well,

1277
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:47,453
because uh,
because cost benefit analysis is 

1278
01:03:49,621 --> 01:03:50,454
basically assuming that everybody's 
equally worth talking about that 

1279
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:56,600
earlier.
There's no way of,

1280
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,500
of sort of,
well you can,

1281
01:03:58,501 --> 01:03:59,334
but it becomes incredibly unclear and 
very unintuitive if you start making 

1282
01:04:03,811 --> 01:04:06,630
weightings and on who is actually worth 
more.

1283
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:08,660
So.
So we are,

1284
01:04:08,930 --> 01:04:11,460
we're getting saying it's a little bit 
like the menu,

1285
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:12,720
you know,
you get in the restaurant,

1286
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:13,950
we're telling you,
hey,

1287
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:14,903
the Spanish is cheap and it has lots of 
vitamins and the cake is expensive and 

1288
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:20,060
it's bad for,
you know,

1289
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:21,293
you go ahead and make the choice.
And I think that's the fair way to have 

1290
01:04:24,301 --> 01:04:25,134
that conversation that we're telling you
some important facts about your 

1291
01:04:27,841 --> 01:04:28,674
decisions.
But these are not the only things that 

1292
01:04:30,151 --> 01:04:33,450
are going to guide your decision.
And I'm absolutely happy to say that.

1293
01:04:33,451 --> 01:04:34,284
So.
So in some sense you asked me to be 

1294
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:38,300
devil's advocate.
I just think it's important to clarify.

1295
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:39,533
We don't look at all issues because we 
only look at issues that require 

1296
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:45,480
resources and we don't feel with 
inequality,

1297
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:46,433
which is also an important issue.
But apart from that we have to make 

1298
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:53,520
priorities and we're simply making it a 
little clear.

1299
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,460
At the end of the day,
you can choose to totally disregard it.

1300
01:04:56,610 --> 01:04:57,443
But I would imagine that you would at 
least like to know what does the 

1301
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:02,640
evidence tell you?
If you spend it all here,

1302
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:05,880
how many people will you save?
How many lives will be improved,

1303
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:08,400
how much environment will be improved 
and so on.

1304
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:09,503
Versus all the other things where you 
could have spent that dollar and done 

1305
01:05:12,090 --> 01:05:14,820
different amounts of good in all those 
different areas.

1306
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:17,100
And that's what we provide for the menu.

1307
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,180
So do you,
okay.

1308
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:21,430
Okay.
Well I appreciate that very much.

1309
01:05:21,431 --> 01:05:23,170
Um,
do you have any sense,

1310
01:05:23,171 --> 01:05:25,330
what do you,
off the top of your head,

1311
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:26,673
what the total capital expenditure for 
the minimization eradication of 

1312
01:05:30,221 --> 01:05:32,770
tuberculosis actually would be?
What are you talking about?

1313
01:05:32,771 --> 01:05:34,120
An absolute dollar amounts.

1314
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,480
So,
and,

1315
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:38,150
and it depends a lot on,
uh,

1316
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:39,140
because,
uh,

1317
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:42,150
we estimate it you need about $2 
billion.

1318
01:05:42,151 --> 01:05:42,541
The,
uh,

1319
01:05:42,541 --> 01:05:43,210
the,
uh,

1320
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:44,043
the,
the global funds that we were also 

1321
01:05:45,271 --> 01:05:46,420
campaigning with,
uh,

1322
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:47,333
our,
it's saying it's about five point $8 

1323
01:05:49,890 --> 01:05:51,720
billion.
And to be quite honest,

1324
01:05:51,721 --> 01:05:55,460
I'm not quite sure which of these two 
numbers is the right number.

1325
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:56,840
I think the,
uh,

1326
01:05:57,210 --> 01:05:58,800
you know,
compared to,

1327
01:05:58,830 --> 01:06:00,560
you know,
just to give you a sense of proportion,

1328
01:06:00,770 --> 01:06:01,603
uh,
the amount of subsidies that we give to 

1329
01:06:03,451 --> 01:06:04,920
solar and wind,
uh,

1330
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:09,100
is about $120 billion right now.
Uh,

1331
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:09,900
so,
you know,

1332
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:11,130
we're,
we're talking about a very,

1333
01:06:11,131 --> 01:06:12,720
very small amount,
uh,

1334
01:06:12,721 --> 01:06:14,830
and certainly it's a very small amount.
You know,

1335
01:06:14,831 --> 01:06:15,750
it's,
it's about what,

1336
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:19,650
three,
4% of global development,

1337
01:06:19,670 --> 01:06:20,301
uh,
uh,

1338
01:06:20,301 --> 01:06:24,360
spending the amount of spending that we,
that we spend every year to try and help

1339
01:06:24,510 --> 01:06:27,240
improve the world.
And it will probably be one of the very,

1340
01:06:27,241 --> 01:06:29,370
very best things that we could do.
So again,

1341
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:30,810
very,
very small leanings.

1342
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:33,890
I need to know these things.
And I think that if they did

1343
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:34,823
no,
that would start to care if they 

1344
01:06:35,701 --> 01:06:37,020
actually knew.
So.

1345
01:06:37,021 --> 01:06:37,740
Okay.
I got,

1346
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:40,740
I got two final questions for you,
I think,

1347
01:06:40,741 --> 01:06:41,574
and then I'll ask you if there's 
anything else you wanted to bring to 

1348
01:06:43,861 --> 01:06:44,694
people's attention that,
that you thought was particularly 

1349
01:06:46,081 --> 01:06:46,831
necessary.
Okay.

1350
01:06:46,831 --> 01:06:49,260
So the first one is,
um,

1351
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:52,900
to what degree do you think,
oh,

1352
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:53,793
I'll ask all three questions.
To what degree do you think you've been 

1353
01:06:56,241 --> 01:06:59,270
making headway?
Like obviously you're,

1354
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:00,133
you've been successful in putting 
together your institutes and your work 

1355
01:07:03,051 --> 01:07:06,590
is garnered a substantial amount of 
attention published and otherwise,

1356
01:07:06,591 --> 01:07:09,800
and so it's not like you've been 
silenced and,

1357
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:10,703
and imprisoned or anything like that.
And so are the reasons for optimism as 

1358
01:07:15,231 --> 01:07:19,190
far as you're concerned.
And then the next thing that I'd like to

1359
01:07:19,191 --> 01:07:20,024
ask you about is what's happening in 
France because one of the things that 

1360
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:24,853
the people who are pushing for radical 
current interventions with regards to 

1361
01:07:29,091 --> 01:07:33,590
longterm climate change haven't factored
in is the reverse apocalyptic issue,

1362
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:37,520
which is that there's going to be 
substantial resistance to the short term

1363
01:07:37,521 --> 01:07:41,120
costs that will cause spinoff disasters 
of their own.

1364
01:07:41,420 --> 01:07:45,080
And so the French example seems to be a 
very interesting case in point.

1365
01:07:45,081 --> 01:07:47,000
So,
so the first question was,

1366
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:50,720
how do you feel about the impact that 
you're having in the second is,

1367
01:07:50,721 --> 01:07:52,820
what do you have to say about what's 
happening in France?

1368
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:53,840
Yup.

1369
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:56,420
And can I,
I'm gonna answer it in reverse.

1370
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:59,540
The France point is,
is really a good,

1371
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:01,160
uh,
a good argument.

1372
01:08:01,161 --> 01:08:03,180
If you ask people around the world,
uh,

1373
01:08:03,290 --> 01:08:05,600
do you care about global warming?
Almost everyone will say,

1374
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:06,463
yes.
Uh,

1375
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:08,360
do you want to do something for global 
warming?

1376
01:08:08,361 --> 01:08:10,370
And they'll say yes.
Then when you ask them,

1377
01:08:10,371 --> 01:08:13,790
how much are you willing to pay the 
typical answer,

1378
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,710
uh,
both in rich and cork countries,

1379
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,450
there's a couple of hundred dollars per 
year.

1380
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:20,390
So Yup.
It goes from 100 to $200.

1381
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:23,030
So fundamentally what people are saying 
is,

1382
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:24,950
yes,
I do worry about this issue.

1383
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:26,540
I'm willing to spend a little bit of 
money,

1384
01:08:26,541 --> 01:08:27,374
but not very much.
And I think this is the fundamental 

1385
01:08:29,571 --> 01:08:30,404
thing that we just have not been able to
get to the attention of a lot of people 

1386
01:08:34,221 --> 01:08:36,890
who are pushing for really,
really radical solutions.

1387
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:41,840
You're never going to succeed in a 
democratic situation.

1388
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:42,893
Uh,
if,

1389
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:44,510
yeah,
if you keep ramping up,

1390
01:08:44,730 --> 01:08:46,970
uh,
the taxes on fossil fuels,

1391
01:08:46,971 --> 01:08:49,790
if you keep making energy more and more 
expensive,

1392
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:51,140
it's going to harm,
first of all,

1393
01:08:51,141 --> 01:08:53,120
the poor,
the most very,

1394
01:08:53,121 --> 01:08:55,400
very regressive.
And that obviously

1395
01:08:58,490 --> 01:09:00,950
means a lot of heartache for a lot of 
poor people.

1396
01:09:01,130 --> 01:09:01,963
These are typically also the people who 
are at least able to defend themselves 

1397
01:09:04,881 --> 01:09:08,870
because they're just so busy just 
surviving the day today.

1398
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:09,853
So it typically has to hit the 
middleclass before you really get sort 

1399
01:09:12,741 --> 01:09:15,290
of an eruption as what you've seen in 
France and elsewhere.

1400
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:16,393
Let's remember,
there's also a lot of other issues in 

1401
01:09:17,901 --> 01:09:20,540
France,
so it's not just because they put three,

1402
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:22,390
three sets on a,
on,

1403
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:24,080
on a liter of diesel,
but,

1404
01:09:24,081 --> 01:09:28,040
but it is an issue of saying if you push
people too far,

1405
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:30,800
you will actually not be able to do the 
solution for climate.

1406
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,960
And so you're very,
very expensive.

1407
01:09:32,961 --> 01:09:35,690
Solutions are never going to be a 
longterm viable,

1408
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:37,820
you know,
when you predict these ideas of saying,

1409
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,650
if we had Obama,
uh,

1410
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:42,830
and if he would actually have managed to
put a carbon tax on,

1411
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:43,930
on,
on co2.

1412
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:46,220
Remember he actually had a democratic 
congress,

1413
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:47,283
uh,
the first two years of this presidency 

1414
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:52,730
and they were still not able to get a 
carbon tax implemented.

1415
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:55,370
Of course when you have a Republican 
congress,

1416
01:09:55,380 --> 01:09:58,070
it becomes really hard when you have a 
republican president.

1417
01:09:58,071 --> 01:09:59,660
Also,
it falls apart.

1418
01:09:59,810 --> 01:10:02,000
You just can't do this for a hundred 
years.

1419
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:04,700
It's just not going to work out.
And that's why,

1420
01:10:04,970 --> 01:10:05,561
uh,
and,

1421
01:10:05,561 --> 01:10:06,394
and we never got to that.
We actually did a climate consensus 

1422
01:10:09,231 --> 01:10:12,410
where we brought together 27 of the 
world's top climate economist,

1423
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:16,580
three Nobel laureates to look at where 
can you do good for climate?

1424
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:17,743
And what they found was the by far best 
investment to tackle global warming is 

1425
01:10:22,671 --> 01:10:24,550
to invest in Green Energy R.
And.

1426
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:26,030
D.
So fundamentally,

1427
01:10:26,031 --> 01:10:30,050
if we could invest in making better 
green energy for the future,

1428
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:31,333
hopefully eventually get it to be so 
cheap that it w out compete fossil 

1429
01:10:34,131 --> 01:10:36,680
fuels,
we will solve global warming just simply

1430
01:10:36,681 --> 01:10:37,514
because the green energy became cheaper.
If you'll allow me a slight detour 

1431
01:10:41,091 --> 01:10:41,720
people,
you do it,

1432
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:43,450
do it.
Uh,

1433
01:10:43,670 --> 01:10:45,570
uh,
back in the 1860 [inaudible],

1434
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:46,573
uh,
the world was hunting whales to 

1435
01:10:47,691 --> 01:10:50,330
extinction because whales have this.
Wonderful,

1436
01:10:52,220 --> 01:10:53,830
should I just say that again?
Yup.

1437
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:55,240
Yup.
All right.

1438
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,340
Um,
back in the 1860s,

1439
01:10:57,370 --> 01:10:58,203
we were hunting whales to extinction 
because whales have this wonderful oil 

1440
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,890
that just burns a lot cleaner and a low 
point.

1441
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:07,260
And so it was wonderful for the houses 
and in,

1442
01:11:07,290 --> 01:11:09,590
in North American and Europe to burn 
these,

1443
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:10,473
uh,
this whale oil and they're all excited 

1444
01:11:11,631 --> 01:11:16,631
about it and it,
the bad side effect there was actually a

1445
01:11:16,770 --> 01:11:18,180
pushing whales to extinction.

1446
01:11:18,410 --> 01:11:22,980
Now the sort of global warming approach 
to that problem would have been society.

1447
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:23,843
Could you please turn down the light,
could you please have it a little less 

1448
01:11:26,521 --> 01:11:27,354
light in your room?
And of course you would have been 

1449
01:11:28,681 --> 01:11:29,514
entirely failed.
What did save the whales was we 

1450
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:34,770
discovered oil,
fossil fuel oil,

1451
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:35,813
which were actually burning cleaner.
It was much cheaper and you didn't have 

1452
01:11:38,101 --> 01:11:38,934
to go out and kill whales for it.
And so what happened about a decade was 

1453
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:45,510
to stop killing whales because you've 
got a better technological product.

1454
01:11:45,810 --> 01:11:46,643
And we've seen this a lot of times that 
technology can simply invalidate an old 

1455
01:11:50,251 --> 01:11:51,084
issue,
a problem that you thought was almost 

1456
01:11:52,711 --> 01:11:54,990
intractable.
If you get cheaper,

1457
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:56,880
smarter,
new technology,

1458
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:58,590
people switch,
right?

1459
01:11:58,591 --> 01:11:59,424
That's opposing imposing limits on 
expensive limits on people is not an 

1460
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:07,620
appropriate longterm solution because of
implementation resistance and cost.

1461
01:12:07,621 --> 01:12:09,710
And the best solution is to come up with
a,

1462
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:12,510
well let's say,
to put it in a cliched manner,

1463
01:12:12,511 --> 01:12:16,020
is to come up with a better solution,
which is cheaper energy.

1464
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:19,140
That's that it has all the advantages 
and fewer disadvantages.

1465
01:12:19,380 --> 01:12:21,090
And that's really how it would be a 
problem.

1466
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,950
Wind turbines,
solar panels,

1467
01:12:22,951 --> 01:12:25,200
and,
and I'm just taking the two most popular

1468
01:12:25,201 --> 01:12:28,500
things and batteries together.
If they were cheaper than fossil fuels,

1469
01:12:28,501 --> 01:12:30,540
which they aren't right now,
but if they were,

1470
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:33,400
of course everyone would bond them 
buying coal,

1471
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:34,243
fire power plants.
So it's really not rocket science in 

1472
01:12:35,911 --> 01:12:37,710
that way.
Now I'm not saying it's going to be easy

1473
01:12:37,711 --> 01:12:39,600
and it's certainly not going to happen 
right now,

1474
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:42,030
but it's the only viable long term 
solution.

1475
01:12:42,031 --> 01:12:44,070
It's much cheaper and much more 
effective.

1476
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:45,053
So we estimated that for every dollar 
spent you'll actually do about $11 a 

1477
01:12:48,641 --> 01:12:50,330
climate benefit.
Okay,

1478
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:52,740
so that's that.
So an alternative energy.

1479
01:12:52,810 --> 01:12:56,400
Our index,
I fart,

1480
01:12:56,490 --> 01:12:56,971
you know,
so,

1481
01:12:56,971 --> 01:12:58,590
so it's,
it's not the best thing,

1482
01:12:58,591 --> 01:13:00,450
but it comes down here.
So it actually,

1483
01:13:00,451 --> 01:13:02,220
you know,
it's a pretty good investment.

1484
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:03,960
Yeah.
It's not the best in the world,

1485
01:13:04,020 --> 01:13:04,853
but we should definitely be doing okay.
The second question that you had was 

1486
01:13:08,191 --> 01:13:08,791
the,
you know,

1487
01:13:08,791 --> 01:13:10,800
the optimism.
So fundamentally,

1488
01:13:10,801 --> 01:13:13,680
how much of an impact does this have?
Well,

1489
01:13:13,770 --> 01:13:14,603
it's half the impact.
Very predictable impact that when we 

1490
01:13:17,251 --> 01:13:18,630
come out and say,
for instance,

1491
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,240
uh,
uh,

1492
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:23,550
more immunization gives you $60 back in 
the dollar,

1493
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:24,803
the people who are doing immunization 
tells you all the time you should fund 

1494
01:13:28,651 --> 01:13:31,590
us because we do $60 in good humor,
every dollar you spend.

1495
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:34,590
So very clearly,
I sat down with a guy from,

1496
01:13:34,620 --> 01:13:35,330
uh,
from,

1497
01:13:35,330 --> 01:13:37,620
uh,
a family foundation,

1498
01:13:37,621 --> 01:13:38,850
a big family foundation.
Then,

1499
01:13:38,851 --> 01:13:39,684
you know,
where we were at a malaria event and we 

1500
01:13:42,871 --> 01:13:45,470
sat and politely conversing here.
Uh,

1501
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:46,890
he would say,
so what do you do?

1502
01:13:46,891 --> 01:13:47,261
I,
well,

1503
01:13:47,261 --> 01:13:49,210
I worked with the Copenhagen Consensus 
Center,

1504
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:50,730
you know,
totally blacks there.

1505
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:51,983
And then I asked him,
what do you do and what we work with 

1506
01:13:53,941 --> 01:13:54,500
malaria.

1507
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,340
We did,
you know that actually it's,

1508
01:13:56,341 --> 01:13:59,180
you spend a dollar in malarial do $33 
worth of good.

1509
01:13:59,181 --> 01:13:59,821
And I was like,
yeah,

1510
01:13:59,821 --> 01:14:01,570
we did that.
And you know,

1511
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:02,211
and,
and,

1512
01:14:02,211 --> 01:14:03,090
and,
you know,

1513
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:05,010
this is exactly the point.
We're not,

1514
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,120
we're not there to,
you know,

1515
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:06,983
get attention.
We're there to make sure that we get 

1516
01:14:08,881 --> 01:14:09,714
attention to some of these top ideas.
And I think we definitely helped a lot 

1517
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:15,640
of these top ideas get a little easier 
right in the world.

1518
01:14:15,670 --> 01:14:18,250
Okay.
So let me ask you another cost benefit.

1519
01:14:18,490 --> 01:14:19,150
Okay.
So,

1520
01:14:19,150 --> 01:14:21,700
yes.
So what if I said,

1521
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:23,433
wouldn't it be interested interesting in
doing a metta cost benefit analysis on 

1522
01:14:28,421 --> 01:14:29,254
how much money you would need to raise 
and spend to effectively market your 

1523
01:14:34,031 --> 01:14:34,864
findings.
You don't want to hire people who are 

1524
01:14:36,791 --> 01:14:37,624
really good at doing such marketing so 
that you had the appropriate 

1525
01:14:40,091 --> 01:14:42,850
advertisements and so that you,
cause you're,

1526
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:44,800
you're,
this is not a criticism,

1527
01:14:44,801 --> 01:14:45,634
believe me,
but your approach is very academic and 

1528
01:14:47,951 --> 01:14:48,784
very objective and,
and that's all well and good and 

1529
01:14:52,211 --> 01:14:54,010
reliable and valid and all of those 
things.

1530
01:14:54,010 --> 01:14:56,170
But
do you,

1531
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:59,170
do you,
could you reconna [inaudible] compute to

1532
01:14:59,171 --> 01:15:03,630
utility in dollar value of establishing 
an ex,

1533
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:04,793
an extensive inappropriate marketing 
scheme because you'd think that there 

1534
01:15:07,991 --> 01:15:08,824
are,
let's see,

1535
01:15:08,850 --> 01:15:09,683
cause I've been watching what's been 
happening with the Democrats in the U S 

1536
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:16,240
and they've,
a pack that I know about has been,

1537
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:17,533
uh,
making new ads for the Democrats trying 

1538
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:20,974
to move them towards the center and 
they've had a substantial amount of 

1539
01:15:23,741 --> 01:15:24,574
impact because the advertisements have 
been very professionally crafted and 

1540
01:15:27,710 --> 01:15:28,870
constructive.
And so,

1541
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:31,180
well,
I don't,

1542
01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:33,430
I don't know what you think about that,
but I'd been,

1543
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:35,223
part of the reason I'm interviewing you 
today is because I want to put this up 

1544
01:15:37,451 --> 01:15:38,284
on youtube and I want to get it out 
there in podcast so that more people 

1545
01:15:40,241 --> 01:15:42,130
know about this.
And so,

1546
01:15:42,830 --> 01:15:43,663
all right,
well,

1547
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:47,470
yeah,
so the short answer of course is we have

1548
01:15:47,471 --> 01:15:49,550
tried to do that because we're economist
and we think,

1549
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,700
yeah,
that would be a good idea.

1550
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:54,070
So let me just tell you about something 
else that we had done.

1551
01:15:54,071 --> 01:15:54,671
So,
uh,

1552
01:15:54,671 --> 01:15:57,730
so we've been working a lot and we were 
just talking about the cool.

1553
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,053
Uh,
so when you do prioritization on the 

1554
01:16:00,851 --> 01:16:03,970
planetary scale,
it's academically very interesting.

1555
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:07,150
But unfortunately the impact is mostly 
that people say,

1556
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:09,130
yeah,
that's probably true somewhere else.

1557
01:16:09,210 --> 01:16:10,043
You know?
So when we go and tell the immune 

1558
01:16:10,781 --> 01:16:11,620
system,
they'll say,

1559
01:16:11,621 --> 01:16:12,454
yeah,
that's probably true for Mexico and 

1560
01:16:13,331 --> 01:16:15,430
Mexico.
Say it's probably true of Argentina.

1561
01:16:15,431 --> 01:16:16,264
And so,
so everybody just push it off to 

1562
01:16:17,561 --> 01:16:21,100
somebody else.
The bowl was never anyone's problem.

1563
01:16:21,101 --> 01:16:22,960
Yeah.
Someone else needs to fix us.

1564
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:26,760
And so what we've increasingly done it 
as to do this in nations.

1565
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:28,083
Uh,
so we did this a couple of years ago in 

1566
01:16:29,201 --> 01:16:30,970
Bangladesh,
a w and,

1567
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:31,823
and the nation of course,
is an overlap between who actually 

1568
01:16:34,121 --> 01:16:38,260
decides where to spend the money and the
problems that we analyzing.

1569
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:41,260
So we did the exact same thing for just 
for Bangladesh.

1570
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:46,440
So we did a list of all the things.
So we talked to everyone in Bangladesh.

1571
01:16:46,481 --> 01:16:47,314
We got them to say,
what are the best things that you want 

1572
01:16:49,151 --> 01:16:49,984
to focus on?
What are the smartest new solutions we 

1573
01:16:51,251 --> 01:16:52,870
worked with?
Primus think tank,

1574
01:16:53,140 --> 01:16:53,973
the finance minister,
everybody else and talked about where 

1575
01:16:55,781 --> 01:16:57,790
can you actually spend money.
Again,

1576
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:58,863
this is,
this is a menu that's not entirely 

1577
01:17:00,671 --> 01:17:03,580
politically correct.
Certainly the politicians don't like all

1578
01:17:03,581 --> 01:17:04,750
of this,
but what the,

1579
01:17:04,751 --> 01:17:06,250
you know,
the finance minister would go like,

1580
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:06,941
no,
no,

1581
01:17:06,941 --> 01:17:07,660
no,
Oh yes,

1582
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:08,650
yes,
I like this.

1583
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:10,940
See Him.
So they did some of the things.

1584
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:14,270
So that solves the Tower of Babel 
problem to some degree.

1585
01:17:14,271 --> 01:17:15,980
Is that too much distance?
Yeah,

1586
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:18,590
there's too much distance between the 
local and the global.

1587
01:17:18,830 --> 01:17:21,320
And so you're using the nation state as 
a,

1588
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:23,960
as a psychological intermediary.

1589
01:17:24,670 --> 01:17:28,520
So there we actually estimate that every
dollar spent on what we were doing,

1590
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:29,530
uh,
does,

1591
01:17:29,530 --> 01:17:30,363
you know,
at least $10,000 worth of good simply 

1592
01:17:32,301 --> 01:17:37,301
because we help shift spending in 
Bangladesh both on their national budget

1593
01:17:37,911 --> 01:17:41,090
but also the development budgets 
spending in Bangladesh.

1594
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:42,740
And again,
we didn't change,

1595
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:43,663
you know,
Bangladesh to suddenly become super 

1596
01:17:45,201 --> 01:17:46,160
rational.
Anything.

1597
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:48,680
I'm simply changed the bowl little bit 
we gave,

1598
01:17:48,681 --> 01:17:49,514
if you will,
headwind to the poor ideas and tailwind 

1599
01:17:52,131 --> 01:17:54,710
to the good ones.
And so we will not Haiti,

1600
01:17:54,711 --> 01:17:55,544
we are,
we're now doing this in India together 

1601
01:17:56,781 --> 01:17:58,660
with Tata Trust.
I just came back and said,

1602
01:17:58,661 --> 01:18:01,340
that's why I'm a little jet lag or a 
little bleary eyed.

1603
01:18:01,341 --> 01:18:03,560
I just came back from,
from Ghana,

1604
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:04,573
uh,
where are we going to do our next 

1605
01:18:05,121 --> 01:18:07,100
project?
So we want to bring this to Africa.

1606
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:09,980
Three.
I used to do it globally and locally.

1607
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:11,473
Yes.
And I think when we'll have a lot more 

1608
01:18:12,561 --> 01:18:13,394
opportunity to actually get people's 
attention when you talk specifically to 

1609
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,360
the nation states where you're actually 
going to be making these decisions.

1610
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:21,403
But obviously if it's true Ghana,
it's probably also true in the 

1611
01:18:23,871 --> 01:18:25,580
neighboring state.
You're going to get the overlap.

1612
01:18:26,210 --> 01:18:28,610
Exactly.
So I think I would love to,

1613
01:18:28,611 --> 01:18:29,051
you know,
uh,

1614
01:18:29,051 --> 01:18:29,930
have,
have,

1615
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:30,800
uh,
have,

1616
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:31,740
have a lot of,
uh,

1617
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:35,450
of extra sort of pr ability.
But I think what we,

1618
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:36,343
what we really need is just simply to be
able to come up with all these great 

1619
01:18:40,011 --> 01:18:42,820
ideas and I think we are reasonably 
successful but,

1620
01:18:42,930 --> 01:18:47,090
but the problem in some ways is we're 
advocates of all the boring stuff.

1621
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:48,073
You know,
all the stuff that gets the attention 

1622
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:52,580
are the ones that have the crying babies
and cute animals.

1623
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:54,590
The thing is it's not true.

1624
01:18:54,590 --> 01:18:58,490
It's not what you're doing isn't boring.
It's absolutely exciting beyond belief.

1625
01:18:58,491 --> 01:19:03,050
I mean I don't believe that it is dry 
and I don't believe that it doesn't have

1626
01:19:03,051 --> 01:19:03,884
a powerful narrative message.
It's just that there are reasons that 

1627
01:19:06,741 --> 01:19:07,574
the narrative messages I'm scared.
And I think putting your finger on the 

1628
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:13,790
gap between the local and the global is 
a good one.

1629
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:17,870
That's smart because you see the same 
problem starting to emerge.

1630
01:19:17,871 --> 01:19:18,704
For example with the EU where the 
overarching bureaucracy is so distant 

1631
01:19:22,071 --> 01:19:26,750
from the people on the ground that 
there's a disconnect in identification.

1632
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:27,973
And so to harness the latent power of 
the nation state and its patriotism and 

1633
01:19:31,971 --> 01:19:34,690
it's at its economic,
what would,

1634
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:35,943
it's rather local economic structure 
seems to me to be a rita smarter 

1635
01:19:38,660 --> 01:19:40,130
solution.
But I,

1636
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:41,113
I really,
I was thrilled when I came across your 

1637
01:19:42,921 --> 01:19:46,250
work and I mean on an emotional level 
because I thought,

1638
01:19:46,251 --> 01:19:48,290
well wow,
if we really want it to do good,

1639
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:49,153
if that was the goal and we wanted to do
it intelligently and carefully and 

1640
01:19:53,690 --> 01:19:55,970
agnostically to some degree.
Um,

1641
01:19:56,330 --> 01:19:59,060
and in a non he ideologically 
self-serving manner,

1642
01:19:59,061 --> 01:20:01,490
which would be a lovely thing to manage 
if it was possible,

1643
01:20:01,491 --> 01:20:04,040
then this seemed to be an incredibly 
exciting approach.

1644
01:20:04,041 --> 01:20:04,874
And I,
I believe that there's every reason to 

1645
01:20:07,321 --> 01:20:08,154
assume that

1646
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,113
with proper publicity that people could 
really get behind the idea that we 

1647
01:20:12,931 --> 01:20:15,480
wouldn't have to have tuberculosis in 10
years,

1648
01:20:15,990 --> 01:20:16,361
you know?
And,

1649
01:20:16,361 --> 01:20:18,000
and that some of these things could 
really,

1650
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:19,613
you know,
I've talked to people in on my lecture 

1651
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:23,790
tour about the things that we could do 
to make the world a better place.

1652
01:20:23,791 --> 01:20:26,310
And there's no shortage of enthusiasm 
for that.

1653
01:20:26,311 --> 01:20:29,010
It's just that there's a fair bit of 
cynicism,

1654
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,740
but there's a lot more ignorance is like
what will,

1655
01:20:31,741 --> 01:20:36,741
we just don't know what to do.
But your prescription say well here's 10

1656
01:20:36,961 --> 01:20:37,794
things you could do one of them and one 
of them would work and so you've got a 

1657
01:20:40,231 --> 01:20:41,064
bit of a choice there.
We wouldn't have to take our number one 

1658
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:46,110
priority as your own,
but you could take number five and you'd

1659
01:20:46,111 --> 01:20:49,530
still do a lovely job and it might be in
accordance with your own motivations.

1660
01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:52,050
Okay.
Can I can,

1661
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:52,913
can you get me pdfs for example of the 
relevant whatever you think is relevant 

1662
01:20:58,860 --> 01:20:59,693
that would inform people in short order.
I will post in the description of the 

1663
01:21:04,111 --> 01:21:04,944
video so that they get access to that.
So whatever material you'd like to have 

1664
01:21:09,181 --> 01:21:11,640
disseminated as a consequence of this 
conversation,

1665
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:12,743
just get that to me and I'll post it and
any blurb you want me to put it in the 

1666
01:21:15,811 --> 01:21:18,360
description.
Then I'll also do that with whatever.

1667
01:21:18,590 --> 01:21:19,980
What,
when do you need it for?

1668
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:21,950
As soon as,
as soon as you can get it,

1669
01:21:21,951 --> 01:21:24,650
cause I'll put this very soon.
Like in the next day.

1670
01:21:24,670 --> 01:21:26,090
Right.
All right.

1671
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:28,683
Okay.
Is there anything else that you would 

1672
01:21:29,941 --> 01:21:32,940
like to say that we haven't covered?
All right.

1673
01:21:33,010 --> 01:21:33,843
For first of all,
I think it's wonderful the way that 

1674
01:21:35,551 --> 01:21:36,384
you're,
you're talking about this as sort of an 

1675
01:21:37,981 --> 01:21:38,670
outside of that.

1676
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:40,010
It's actually exciting,
uh,

1677
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:41,080
because we,
we,

1678
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:41,953
and we probably make this mistake that 
we think of ourselves in a little bit 

1679
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:46,200
and sort of technocrats and,
and,

1680
01:21:46,201 --> 01:21:48,690
you know,
fiddlers and the margin kind of thing.

1681
01:21:48,691 --> 01:21:51,030
And it actually,
you're right and it is exciting.

1682
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:55,530
It is exciting actually,
if we could actually spend our resources

1683
01:21:55,531 --> 01:21:57,990
four times as well as what we're doing 
right now.

1684
01:21:58,140 --> 01:21:58,973
So instead of saying all the things that
are politically cried and making us all 

1685
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:02,093
feel warm and fuzzy,
actually doing the things that perhaps 

1686
01:22:04,651 --> 01:22:07,380
are not top of mind,
not top of the,

1687
01:22:07,410 --> 01:22:08,080
uh,
uh,

1688
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:09,240
the,
the agenda,

1689
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:11,370
but we just do an amazing amount of 
good.

1690
01:22:11,371 --> 01:22:13,260
Why the hell are we not doing that?
It's not,

1691
01:22:13,270 --> 01:22:14,103
yes.
Thank you very much for getting me back 

1692
01:22:16,081 --> 01:22:17,520
into the group and excellence.
I really,

1693
01:22:17,521 --> 01:22:20,190
I really believe that.
And incredibly useful.

1694
01:22:20,330 --> 01:22:21,690
Yeah,
I think,

1695
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:24,990
I think it's a mistake not to view what 
you're doing as a,

1696
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:26,370
as an exciting adventure.

1697
01:22:26,370 --> 01:22:28,860
I think it's a form of,
of what,

1698
01:22:29,030 --> 01:22:31,800
uh,
it's a form of non-helpful humility.

1699
01:22:32,310 --> 01:22:33,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

1700
01:22:34,490 --> 01:22:36,510
And,
and I think I,

1701
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:37,440
I'm,
I'm Danish,

1702
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:39,120
uh,
background and,

1703
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:41,810
and one of the things we're very,
very good at as self-effacement.

1704
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:43,390
Uh,
and so yes,

1705
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:45,400
you're probably right.
So like you're following people,

1706
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:49,470
you're calling people to a great 
adventure here saying,

1707
01:22:49,471 --> 01:22:50,304
look,
we have enough resources so that we can 

1708
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:57,320
deflect a small fraction of them and do 
an unbelievable amount of good.

1709
01:22:57,331 --> 01:22:59,580
And the,
and there were no downside to that.

1710
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:01,850
There would be no downside.
Anyone,

1711
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:02,693
there would be nothing but upside even 
with some error and there's going to be 

1712
01:23:04,621 --> 01:23:06,100
error.
And so of course,

1713
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:07,193
no,
I think we'll find that people will 

1714
01:23:08,621 --> 01:23:11,020
respond to this video in a very,
very positive way.

1715
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:12,373
And because I do believe that there as 
people become more aware that we are 

1716
01:23:17,891 --> 01:23:18,724
becoming richer and that we do have more
resources at our disposal and that 

1717
01:23:21,490 --> 01:23:22,690
that's genuinely true.

1718
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,600
And that with a bit of intelligent 
consideration,

1719
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:29,890
we could make things a lot more less 
dismal for a lot of people.

1720
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:33,760
I think that they will start to view 
that as something that's part of a great

1721
01:23:33,761 --> 01:23:36,100
global,
national and global adventure.

1722
01:23:36,530 --> 01:23:37,363
And,
and because you're agnostic and because 

1723
01:23:38,891 --> 01:23:42,680
you've done the leg work,
then people can also,

1724
01:23:42,681 --> 01:23:45,080
I think get behind that without any real
cynicism,

1725
01:23:45,081 --> 01:23:45,914
they can say,
look,

1726
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:48,710
our money spent here is not going to be 
wasted.

1727
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:52,190
We can be reasonably assured that if 
we're charitable in this direction,

1728
01:23:52,191 --> 01:23:54,470
we're going to do something positive.
And so,

1729
01:23:54,710 --> 01:23:55,790
so anyways,
like I said,

1730
01:23:55,791 --> 01:23:56,960
I found it an incredibly

1731
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:59,880
wonderful,
let me just say,

1732
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:00,690
uh,
again,

1733
01:24:00,690 --> 01:24:03,450
we said a couple of times,
it's something that I've done.

1734
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:05,100
I need to say,
you know,

1735
01:24:05,101 --> 01:24:05,934
I'm,
I'm just the sock puppet that talks 

1736
01:24:07,111 --> 01:24:08,490
about all these things.
The,

1737
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:11,340
this is the work of an incredible amount
of really,

1738
01:24:11,341 --> 01:24:12,174
really smart economists.
So one of the three end of the world's 

1739
01:24:13,741 --> 01:24:15,840
top economists,
seven Nobel Lawrence,

1740
01:24:16,170 --> 01:24:19,230
those are the guys who have actually 
done the work and who are giving you the

1741
01:24:19,231 --> 01:24:21,180
credibility to all of this.
Uh,

1742
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:25,080
this research and that's why we can say 
with great amount of certainty,

1743
01:24:25,230 --> 01:24:27,180
this is not just sort of a,
a whim,

1744
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:30,060
but something that is probably the best 
we know now.

1745
01:24:30,061 --> 01:24:32,550
It's probably as you point out,
not entirely true,

1746
01:24:32,551 --> 01:24:35,100
but it's certainly better than anything 
else we have right now.

1747
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,113
That's it.
Well,

1748
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:41,390
actually the right comparison,
it's like it's not absolutely true.

1749
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,790
Yeah.
But no one's got a better idea.

1750
01:24:44,570 --> 01:24:45,403
Right.
So we go with the best idea that we 

1751
01:24:46,341 --> 01:24:48,500
have.
Exactly.

1752
01:24:48,710 --> 01:24:49,580
Right.
Right.

1753
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:50,571
All right,
well look,

1754
01:24:50,571 --> 01:24:52,340
it was a great pleasure talking to you 
and,

1755
01:24:52,341 --> 01:24:53,570
uh,
I'm hoping that,

1756
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:54,553
you know,
a million people will watch this and 

1757
01:24:55,551 --> 01:24:56,384
that we'll get another million podcasts 
out of it and that this'll help 

1758
01:24:59,991 --> 01:25:01,220
disseminate what you're doing

1759
01:25:01,490 --> 01:25:03,050
broadly.
I think that would be,

1760
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:05,210
I think that would be lovely.
You Bet.

1761
01:25:05,770 --> 01:25:07,610
Thank you.
It was,

1762
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:08,870
it was great.
Awesome meeting you.

1763
01:25:08,871 --> 01:25:11,750
And I hope our paths will cross again 
soon and,

1764
01:25:11,751 --> 01:25:12,351
uh,
you know,

1765
01:25:12,351 --> 01:25:14,180
we should,
we should make a habit of this.

1766
01:25:14,330 --> 01:25:15,440
Yes,
we definitely should.

1767
01:25:15,441 --> 01:25:18,680
Well when you start to develop some more
of the national indices,

1768
01:25:18,890 --> 01:25:22,620
have you worked on any Western countries
like Canada or the United States or so?

1769
01:25:22,621 --> 01:25:22,770
So

1770
01:25:22,770 --> 01:25:23,401
we,
we,

1771
01:25:23,401 --> 01:25:24,650
I want it to do that.
So we,

1772
01:25:24,651 --> 01:25:27,710
we haven't done it in the US just 
because it's too dysfunctional,

1773
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:28,623
so many different ways.
We've seen a couple of other people 

1774
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:32,700
trying to do this without our 
involvement.

1775
01:25:32,930 --> 01:25:35,100
And one of the things we're really,
really good at is it,

1776
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:36,083
you know,
you get all these economists who do all 

1777
01:25:37,141 --> 01:25:39,930
of this stuff and the first draft of the
paper is,

1778
01:25:40,110 --> 01:25:42,030
this is really hard.
We need 10 years,

1779
01:25:42,090 --> 01:25:42,923
a lot of research money,
and then we'll probably get you 

1780
01:25:44,521 --> 01:25:46,620
something and you know,
we say hello and that's,

1781
01:25:46,650 --> 01:25:49,710
that's nowhere.
You've got to give it your best shot.

1782
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:51,870
Give,
use the information that's out there now

1783
01:25:51,871 --> 01:25:52,704
and give us a knowledge because 
politicians are going to make decisions 

1784
01:25:54,721 --> 01:25:55,990
next year.
Uh,

1785
01:25:56,050 --> 01:25:56,883
and,
and what has happened in those two 

1786
01:25:58,290 --> 01:26:00,240
places.
So they did one in Holland,

1787
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:03,350
they did,
it might actually be Canada,

1788
01:26:03,351 --> 01:26:04,910
but that was like 10 years ago.

1789
01:26:05,150 --> 01:26:05,983
Uh,
in ends up very much like a very 

1790
01:26:07,791 --> 01:26:08,624
interesting anthology of,
of of points that I have no sort of 

1791
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:17,420
consistency is what we're trying to save
cost.

1792
01:26:18,140 --> 01:26:20,570
What would it cost to have something 
like this done for Canada?

1793
01:26:21,170 --> 01:26:23,280
Uh,
so the shirt,

1794
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:26,270
the short version is it cost about two 
and a half million dollars.

1795
01:26:26,271 --> 01:26:27,150
Simply it's,
it's,

1796
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:28,830
it doesn't really scale well.
Uh,

1797
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:31,170
so you know,
doing it for Ghana,

1798
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:32,900
it's the same thing as doing it for 
Canada.

1799
01:26:33,350 --> 01:26:36,200
How long would it take?
18 months.

1800
01:26:36,710 --> 01:26:38,420
God,
that's such a good idea.

1801
01:26:38,421 --> 01:26:40,700
So two and a half million dollars.
18 months.

1802
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:42,320
Yeah.
Okay.

1803
01:26:42,321 --> 01:26:43,154
Well I'm going to wrap that around.
Well maybe we can figure out how to 

1804
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:47,360
raise the money.
We should.

1805
01:26:47,361 --> 01:26:49,070
We should try and do that.
That be would be good.

1806
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:50,533
I think there'd be a lot of interest in 
Canada and Canada would be great way to 

1807
01:26:53,271 --> 01:26:57,320
also get sort of bridge point into the 
US without doing it in the u s Yup.

1808
01:26:57,580 --> 01:26:58,370
Yup.
Well,

1809
01:26:58,370 --> 01:26:59,203
that would be good cause we're flailing 
about politically and it would be nice 

1810
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:03,180
to,
okay,

1811
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:04,033
so,
so that's,

1812
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:04,821
that's,
that's,

1813
01:27:04,821 --> 01:27:07,460
that's,
that's fodder for another conversation.

1814
01:27:07,461 --> 01:27:09,050
We,
I've got a couple of other conversations

1815
01:27:09,051 --> 01:27:09,884
that I'd like to have with you about 
policy development and also about 

1816
01:27:12,501 --> 01:27:14,540
marketing,
but we'll save those for another time.

1817
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:16,660
Brilliant.
Them,

1818
01:27:16,830 --> 01:27:18,800
it was great talking to you again.
Thank you.

1819
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:21,920
Very good at this stuff basically 
tonight.

1820
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:23,650
That's wonderful.
Wonderful.

1821
01:27:23,690 --> 01:27:25,370
Yeah,
I'll get this up as soon as I can.

1822
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:26,870
Wonderful.
All right.

1823
01:27:27,050 --> 01:27:28,250
Talk to you soon.
Okay.

1824
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,113
Bye.
Bye.
