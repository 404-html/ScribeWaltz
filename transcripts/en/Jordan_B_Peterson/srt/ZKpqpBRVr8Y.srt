1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:06,110
So welcome to psychology to 30
personality and its transformations.

2
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,380
So I guess the first thing I'll do is
our,

3
00:00:18,381 --> 00:00:21,920
for you,
a bit of a description of what

4
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:26,921
personality is.
It's a very extensive phenomenon.

5
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:35,060
Personality.
Your personality determines the way you

6
00:00:35,061 --> 00:00:37,610
perceive.
So what that means,

7
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:40,490
at least in part,
is that your personality actually

8
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:45,350
determines
how you're going to extract facts from

9
00:00:45,351 --> 00:00:47,750
the world.
You know,

10
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:52,470
people think that you see the world and
then you think about it then,

11
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:55,100
then maybe you react emotionally and
then you act.

12
00:00:55,101 --> 00:00:59,900
But that's really not accurate.
It's too slow,

13
00:00:59,901 --> 00:01:02,630
first of all.
And there's lots of times when you have

14
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:06,710
to be fast.
And if you had to go through all that

15
00:01:06,711 --> 00:01:08,960
processing before you acted,
you'd be dead.

16
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,420
So personality is deeper than what you
do with facts.

17
00:01:14,421 --> 00:01:18,230
It's deep enough.
So that determines how you bias your

18
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:22,790
perceptions
so that the world appears to you in a

19
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,950
particular manner.
We don't really understand how

20
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:26,300
personality does that yet.

21
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,033
MMM.

22
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,410
It determines your emotional response to
things.

23
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,730
People differ in their positive
emotions,

24
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,020
their baseline level of positive emotion
and their variability and they differ in

25
00:01:41,021 --> 00:01:45,430
their negative emotions as well.
So some people are set to be anxious and

26
00:01:45,431 --> 00:01:49,060
some people are set to be fearless and
the environment can move that around to

27
00:01:49,061 --> 00:01:52,630
some degree.
But a fair bit of it's at least it's

28
00:01:52,631 --> 00:01:56,120
origin point seems to be pretty tightly
determined by genetic factors.

29
00:01:56,121 --> 00:01:56,954
So

30
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:03,080
people differ in the degree to which
they're creative or they differ in the

31
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:07,100
degree to which they're orderly.
There's all sorts of different phenomena

32
00:02:07,101 --> 00:02:12,101
that are tightly attached to what makes
you different from other people because

33
00:02:12,561 --> 00:02:14,600
that's another way of thinking about
personality,

34
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,810
personality,
colors,

35
00:02:17,811 --> 00:02:21,830
your actions because you act in
accordance with your personality,

36
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,870
it's,
it determines your values.

37
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,970
And so that also determines how you act
because of course you act in accordance

38
00:02:28,971 --> 00:02:31,430
with what you value because you're
moving from where you are,

39
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:35,930
which isn't as as good as it could be to
somewhere better and you have to decide

40
00:02:35,931 --> 00:02:38,900
for yourself.
Or maybe that's decided for you by your

41
00:02:38,901 --> 00:02:41,060
temperament,
just where better is.

42
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,900
And so it's very interesting and
exciting for me to teach personality

43
00:02:47,361 --> 00:02:51,290
because it's,
it's the most personal of all phenomena

44
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:54,500
and it's,
it's understanding isn't extraordinarily

45
00:02:54,501 --> 00:02:57,050
relevant,
I think to everyone.

46
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:03,430
Understanding your personality can help
you figure out who you are for better or

47
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:06,740
for worse.
Because with every set of personnel,

48
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:11,970
personality attributes there tend to
come on an associated set of devices.

49
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,700
So for example,
if you're an orderly person,

50
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,970
which in many cases is a good thing,
then you're also prone to harsh

51
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:26,110
judgments.
You tend to be xenophobic and sexual

52
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:29,710
behaviors that aren't strictly normative
are likely to discuss you.

53
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,320
And you might think of that as something
that you conclude as a consequence of

54
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:37,870
your experience.
But it looks in many ways like it's

55
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,350
determined before you act.
In some ways,

56
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,180
personality theory can also help you
understand other people because it's

57
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:53,140
easy to think that other people are like
you and they are like you.

58
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,040
They're like you enough so that more or
less you can communicate with them,

59
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,920
but they're also very different from
you.

60
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:04,450
And so often when you're communicating
with people,

61
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,170
they're actually starting with a
different set of a priori presumptions

62
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:12,580
than you are and we'd like to think that
things can be worked out as a

63
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:16,570
consequence of logical negotiation and
that's true to some degree,

64
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:23,670
but these a priority factors that
underlie your being itself interfere

65
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:29,311
with the ability to use logic because
logic is usually predicated on values

66
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:32,650
and values in turn are predicated on
your temperament.

67
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,120
So having an appreciation for
differences in personality can help you

68
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:43,850
understand your own personality and
maybe improve it and also understanding

69
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,990
and and give some credence to the
viewpoints of other people.

70
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,650
One of the things we've been studying in
my lab for example,

71
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:55,090
is the relationship between personality
and political belief.

72
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,960
I know when it's been thought for a long
time,

73
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,230
it's kind of an enlightenment idea that
you come to your political beliefs as a

74
00:05:02,231 --> 00:05:04,270
consequence again of rational
deliberation.

75
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,270
You take a look at the facts,
you analyze them and you extract out

76
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,270
what you think are the appropriate,
what is the appropriate information from

77
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,070
that analysis.
But we've found,

78
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:18,340
for example,
that people who are high in creativity,

79
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,740
openness,
which is the technical term really for

80
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:22,450
the trait that's associated with
creativity.

81
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:25,300
People who are high in openness and low
in conscientiousness,

82
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,530
conscientiousness is basically
industriousness in order to get high in

83
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:31,240
openness,
low in conscientiousness,

84
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:34,690
they tend to be liberal or left leaning.
Whereas people who are more

85
00:05:34,691 --> 00:05:37,870
conscientious and less creative tend to
be conservative.

86
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,350
And that seems to be true more or less
cross culturally,

87
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:46,240
at least in those cultures where the
left right spectrum is similar in nature

88
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:49,450
to the left right spectrum in North
American culture.

89
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,580
So,
and we also found,

90
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:55,090
although this,
we're still kind of wrestling with this,

91
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:59,190
finding that the effects of your
personality on your political preference

92
00:05:59,191 --> 00:06:01,860
and you're voting behavior actually
increase as you get older.

93
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,210
They don't decrease.
So in some sense,

94
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,480
the degree to which your eight by a
state priority,

95
00:06:09,481 --> 00:06:13,080
by your temperamental perspective,
dominates your thoughts and your

96
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:18,081
behavior even more as you age.
So I don't really know what to make of

97
00:06:19,201 --> 00:06:19,811
that.
You know,

98
00:06:19,811 --> 00:06:21,360
and it's,
it's not the sort of thing that,

99
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,290
that people normally bring into a
political discussion.

100
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:28,170
But the next time that you're,
most of you are probably left wing

101
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,990
because most of you are open and
intelligent and low in

102
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,720
conscientiousness,
relatively speaking.

103
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:34,740
And,
uh,

104
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,050
because you're,
you're likely to be lower in orderliness

105
00:06:37,051 --> 00:06:39,420
than the typical population.
Given that you're interested in this

106
00:06:39,421 --> 00:06:41,190
course.
The next time that you're having a

107
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:43,620
discussion with someone who's
conservative,

108
00:06:43,621 --> 00:06:47,220
you might give some credence to the idea
that you're actually talking to someone

109
00:06:47,221 --> 00:06:49,950
who's quite different than you.
It isn't just that they believe a bunch

110
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,760
of stupid things that you can't
understand why anyone would possibly

111
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:58,260
believe it's that the facts themselves,
array themselves before those people

112
00:06:58,261 --> 00:07:00,240
differently than they do in front of
you.

113
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:02,910
And if you listen as they should listen
to you,

114
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,610
then you know,
you might learn something that you

115
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,670
wouldn't know given your temperamental
stance.

116
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,903
So

117
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,240
practical matters.
You need the,

118
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,850
you need to know this url.
Okay?

119
00:07:20,851 --> 00:07:23,610
So you have to write it down because
that's where the syllabus is.

120
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,440
And,
uh,

121
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,960
opposed to copy of it on blackboard as
well.

122
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:31,560
But for now,
what's there and the syllabus lists

123
00:07:31,561 --> 00:07:33,360
everything that you need to know about
the course.

124
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:38,100
And I'm going to go through it today,
but it tells you what the lecture topics

125
00:07:38,101 --> 00:07:40,710
are.
Of course the readings are posted there

126
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,840
except for the texts.
There's two books for the class.

127
00:07:42,841 --> 00:07:45,390
There's a textbook and a book called the
Black Swan,

128
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,860
um,
and all the assignments and so forth.

129
00:07:49,861 --> 00:07:52,800
And their requirements are listed on the
syllabus as well.

130
00:07:52,801 --> 00:07:56,580
So it should serve as a place where you
can get all the information you need for

131
00:07:56,581 --> 00:07:59,100
the course.
But we'll walk through it today and I'll

132
00:07:59,101 --> 00:08:02,340
give you an overview of what the course
is going to be like.

133
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,710
So now it didn't just personality that
this course is about,

134
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:12,240
people tend to think of personality as
something that's relatively fixed and

135
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:16,410
stable because if it was fluctuating
completely all over the potential range

136
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:18,750
of personality,
that wouldn't be a lot of utility and

137
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:23,370
discussing it.
But it is stable so that you are who you

138
00:08:23,371 --> 00:08:26,160
are.
But it's also amenable to change.

139
00:08:26,161 --> 00:08:28,440
Now it's difficult to change your
personality.

140
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:32,190
It's as if in some sense that the dice
was rolled or five sets of dice.

141
00:08:32,191 --> 00:08:35,280
As it turns out,
we're rolled at the point where you were

142
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:40,281
born and you were granted a particular
kind of personality configuration on the

143
00:08:40,741 --> 00:08:44,640
off chance that that configuration could
find its proper niche in the

144
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:49,020
environment.
It's sort of like people have more or

145
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:51,420
less settled on a five dimensional
personality model,

146
00:08:51,421 --> 00:08:54,030
which we'll talk about a lot in the last
half of the course.

147
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:59,030
But the idea seems to be that perhaps is
that the environment that you inhabit,

148
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:01,500
which is largely social,
right?

149
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:03,990
It's not just physical,
it's mostly social cause you're like

150
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:07,200
hyper social primates.
Some of you are probably checking your

151
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:09,240
email right now.
Um,

152
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:15,020
it's as if there are niches within that
space that may or may not be there may

153
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:18,630
or may not predominate.
And the dice rolls when you're conceived

154
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,340
and you're given a set of attributes and
with any luck you can find a niche in

155
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:28,320
the broader social and physical
environment where your particular set of

156
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:31,380
attributes is going to be functional for
you.

157
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,080
And so a lot of,
and it's,

158
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,120
this is something to think about too.
We'll try to get into this in some depth

159
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:38,790
in the class.
A lot of what you need to do to make

160
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:43,530
your life at least tolerable is to
figure out what your personality

161
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:46,350
attributes are and then to find a niche
where they're valued.

162
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,530
So for example,
for those of you that are creative,

163
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,270
you,
you probably know who you are.

164
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,970
It's actually a rare trait by the way.
Um,

165
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:59,060
I wouldn't recommend banking or law
because law and banking,

166
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,780
just to take two examples,
are very conservative enterprises.

167
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,440
We tested the hundred most creative
lawyers in Canada at one point with,

168
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:12,590
they were nominated by their firms.
And the most outstanding personality

169
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:17,550
attribute of the hundred most creative
Loris was not openness.

170
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:20,040
It wasn't creativity,
it was conscientiousness,

171
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,890
even though they were the hundred most
creative lawyers.

172
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,140
And of course largely depends on
precedent.

173
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,360
And how creative do you want your lawyer
to be?

174
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,160
You know,
if your lawyer is creative enough then

175
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:30,840
you'll be in jail.
So that's probably not,

176
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,610
you know,
it's not the greatest idea.

177
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:37,290
So it's very useful to get a handle on
what your personality is because then

178
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:42,291
you can take a look at the potential
environments that lie in front of you

179
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,670
and hopefully match yourself to one of
them.

180
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,350
Now that's a tricky business,
you know,

181
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:50,970
because it isn't necessarily the case
that the niche that you're most suitable

182
00:10:50,971 --> 00:10:55,860
to inhabit is one that's stable or,
or economically viable,

183
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,780
you know?
And so for example,

184
00:10:57,781 --> 00:11:00,960
I think in,
in some ways it's become more difficult,

185
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,970
for example,
to monetize a variety of different

186
00:11:02,971 --> 00:11:06,000
creative production.
So it's harder to monetize music,

187
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,220
for example,
because of course it can be shared for

188
00:11:08,221 --> 00:11:09,420
nothing.
So,

189
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,850
you know,
it's luck of the draw to some degree.

190
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,590
So now the other part of the course is
the transformation element.

191
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,233
Now,
you know,

192
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,350
personality is stable.
So if you test person at one time and

193
00:11:22,351 --> 00:11:25,650
you test the person later,
then there's high correlations between

194
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:29,400
the two sets of tests.
But there's also variability and the

195
00:11:29,401 --> 00:11:33,240
variability is the part that contains
the potential,

196
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,980
so to speak,
for transformation.

197
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,450
So you're,
uh,

198
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,300
you're an entity with cause I fixed
attributes.

199
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,390
But that doesn't mean that you can't
transform and learn.

200
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,040
You know,
you're a sort of this weird balance

201
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:51,030
between stability and plasticity,
which actually happened to be two metta

202
00:11:51,031 --> 00:11:56,031
traits of personality.
And I also want to take you through the

203
00:11:56,531 --> 00:12:01,531
process of understanding what
personality transformation is and how to

204
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:06,040
conceptualize it.
Because personality transformation comes

205
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:11,020
at a cost and the cost seems to be with
each incremental change,

206
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,740
there is an equal increment of
unstability of instability,

207
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,350
you know,
so that's often because you learn things

208
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:18,910
painfully,
right?

209
00:12:18,911 --> 00:12:20,710
I mean,
if you learn something,

210
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,110
if it's something you expect and
something you want,

211
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:26,530
there's no learning there,
generally speaking because you expect it

212
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:28,540
so it means you already know about it
and you want it.

213
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:32,350
So it's good.
The most potent learning experiences

214
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:37,351
tend to occur when something occurs in
within the realm of your experience that

215
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,300
you don't expect and often that you
don't want.

216
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,900
And those are the sorts of things that
destabilize your personality.

217
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,850
Now they can also be the sort of things
that eventually expand it because if you

218
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,980
encounter something that you don't
understand,

219
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:55,570
that means that there's information in
the event that you haven't incorporated

220
00:12:55,571 --> 00:12:57,910
within your own being.
And if you can do that,

221
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:02,800
then at least in principle,
then your dominion of competence can

222
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:06,010
expand.
Now one of the things you'd see the

223
00:13:06,011 --> 00:13:08,590
courses sort of broken up,
roughly speaking,

224
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:11,830
it's broken up into two sections.
There are more sections which I'll get

225
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:14,020
into,
but the biggest split is actually

226
00:13:14,021 --> 00:13:17,320
between the clinical theorists.
So those would be people who are,

227
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,360
some of them are psychiatrists,
most of them,

228
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:23,170
more practitioners.
So their theories were derived from

229
00:13:23,171 --> 00:13:25,900
observations,
mostly of personality pathology and

230
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:28,750
transformation.
The first half of the course is really

231
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:32,900
about that.
And that's partly because I think the

232
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,930
the most,
um,

233
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,140
intellectually compelling and,
and,

234
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,250
and,
and perhaps even practically useful

235
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,600
theories of personality have in fact
been derived by clinical practitioners

236
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:50,410
like Freud and like human,
like Rogers and of the various people

237
00:13:50,411 --> 00:13:51,790
that we're going to talk about him.

238
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,460
Um,
one of the things that's really

239
00:13:54,461 --> 00:13:56,860
interesting about the clinical
practitioners,

240
00:13:56,861 --> 00:13:59,290
because they have to deal with issues of
health,

241
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,800
roughly speaking,
good mental health versus poor mental

242
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:06,220
health say,
is that they're all their fields of

243
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:11,221
endeavor also deal with values because
it's almost impossible to grapple with

244
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:18,751
the problem of the good or wellbeing or
mental health or psychopathology or

245
00:14:19,211 --> 00:14:24,211
suffering or anxiety or pain or any of
those phenomena without also necessarily

246
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,610
evaluating the domain of values.
It's like,

247
00:14:30,611 --> 00:14:32,380
okay,
well you're a certain way.

248
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,930
Do you want to be better?
If you were better,

249
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:36,970
would that mean that you are more
mentally healthy?

250
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:41,440
What exactly does better mean and is it
useful to use that sort of descriptive

251
00:14:41,441 --> 00:14:43,450
terminology?
When you're talking about personality

252
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,950
being,
I assume that most of you wanting to be

253
00:14:47,951 --> 00:14:52,100
better people now,
your definition of what might better is

254
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:54,200
going to differ again,
according to your temperament,

255
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,440
but generally speaking it seems that
people are,

256
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,230
they're like scissor office there uphill
climbers,

257
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,870
you know,
you don't want to go from bad to worse.

258
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,420
You want to go from where you are to
better.

259
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:09,410
And that means that you have to
conceptualize what constitutes better.

260
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:14,411
And that makes personality theory at
least in re in regard to its,

261
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:20,210
its clinical domain,
a very strange hybrid of science and

262
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,760
engineering because you know,
generally science doesn't deal with

263
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:24,560
values,
but if you're dealing with human

264
00:15:24,561 --> 00:15:29,561
personality,
it seems impossible to avoid the the

265
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,430
topic,
especially if you're concerned with

266
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,550
something like mental health.
So you know,

267
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:36,860
you can assume that mental health means
normal,

268
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,830
but most of you don't assume that.
Right?

269
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:41,720
Because you know,
if you're,

270
00:15:41,721 --> 00:15:44,960
if you're actually,
if you want your reach to exceed your

271
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:46,790
grasp,
a lot of you are going to be aiming for

272
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,250
something that's better than normal or
better than average.

273
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:51,770
Let's say we don't consider average
optimal.

274
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,600
And that's a strange thing.
So the first half of the course that

275
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:59,930
deals with the clinicians is going to
take us into the realm of personality

276
00:15:59,931 --> 00:16:04,460
transformation and also necessarily lead
us through a discussion of value because

277
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,560
I can't see that there's any avoiding
it.

278
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,390
Also,
I think it would be ridiculous to avoid

279
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:12,930
it because why you should do things is,
you know,

280
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,950
how you conceptualize why you should do
things is extraordinarily integral part

281
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:20,120
of your personality.
I mean,

282
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,790
one of the things that we found
recently,

283
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,000
um,
it's a variant of an exercise that I'm

284
00:16:26,001 --> 00:16:28,270
going to have you do in this class,
um,

285
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:33,370
is that if you get people to spend a
couple of hours writing down their

286
00:16:33,531 --> 00:16:35,210
vision of the future,
you know,

287
00:16:35,211 --> 00:16:36,800
so the,
the question basically is,

288
00:16:36,801 --> 00:16:39,680
all right,
so imagine yourself now.

289
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,650
Now imagine yourself three to five years
in the future.

290
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:44,240
Okay,
now and here's the rules.

291
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,730
Imagine that you're trying to take care
of yourself.

292
00:16:46,731 --> 00:16:48,890
Like you would take care of someone that
you cared about.

293
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:52,730
There's a strange,
it's a strange framing,

294
00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:54,800
but you know,
people often don't take care of

295
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:56,750
themselves as well as they take care of
other people.

296
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,400
You know,
they're hard on themselves and they

297
00:16:58,401 --> 00:17:02,180
denigrate themselves because you know,
we might be painfully aware of all your

298
00:17:02,181 --> 00:17:04,310
multiple inadequacies.
And of course,

299
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:06,230
inadequacies are part of the human
condition.

300
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:11,231
So it's easy if you've become cognizant
of your inadequacies to also denigrate

301
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:14,210
the value of your being and not take
care of yourself.

302
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:15,650
And that's not a good thing.
I mean,

303
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:18,470
flawed is you are.
You're probably no worse than anyone

304
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:21,080
else.
And if things shouldn't be good for you,

305
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:24,140
then the logical conclusion is that
things shouldn't be good for anyone else

306
00:17:24,141 --> 00:17:24,974
either.
So,

307
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:27,530
you know,
start with yourself and assume that you

308
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:30,830
deserve some,
at least the basic elements of the

309
00:17:30,831 --> 00:17:33,140
attitude that you would give to someone
that you care for.

310
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:34,820
Okay?
So you put yourself in that mind frame

311
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,680
now you think three to five years down
the road,

312
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,200
what do you want for friendship?

313
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,740
What do you want for career?
What do you want for family?

314
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,410
How do you want your intimate
relationships to be constituted?

315
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,230
What are you going to do when you're not
working?

316
00:17:48,231 --> 00:17:51,570
What sort of productive useful
activities and interesting activities

317
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:55,530
are you going to engage it?
If you could optimize your life three to

318
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:59,190
five years down the road,
what exactly would that look like?

319
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,660
All right,
so there's that question.

320
00:18:00,661 --> 00:18:04,950
Then we also get people to do dance or
the reverse question,

321
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:08,700
which is all right.
Now imagine that you allow your

322
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:12,480
inadequacies and your pathology such as
they are to gain the upper hand,

323
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:14,880
which I'm sure they do,
and your own life zone and week to week

324
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:17,160
basis.
Imagine you really let them get out of

325
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:19,170
hand.
So you know you're,

326
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:23,760
you're drinking 26 ounces of vodka every
second day in five years or you know,

327
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:27,660
you're lying uncontrollably or no one
can stand to you cause you're too

328
00:18:27,661 --> 00:18:30,350
disagreeable in neurotic or whatever
you've,

329
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,201
you know,
you know,

330
00:18:31,201 --> 00:18:34,950
whatever your weaknesses happened to be.
Maybe you procrastinate all the time and

331
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:38,880
end up unemployed.
Imagine three to five years down the

332
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:42,630
road that things turn out as badly for
you as they can because you've allowed

333
00:18:42,631 --> 00:18:46,320
things to go from bad to worse and
conceptualize that

334
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,590
while.
And then we have people write a plan

335
00:18:50,591 --> 00:18:53,440
based on the positive vision.
The negative vision I think is really

336
00:18:53,441 --> 00:18:55,840
useful because if you're running towards
something,

337
00:18:55,841 --> 00:18:59,200
it's also extremely useful from a
motivational perspective to be running

338
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:01,810
away from something at the same time,
you know,

339
00:19:01,811 --> 00:19:04,720
then you can harness your positive
emotions which are associated with

340
00:19:04,721 --> 00:19:07,840
approaching a valued goal.
And you can have your negative emotions

341
00:19:07,841 --> 00:19:11,290
like fear chasing you instead of
standing in front of you,

342
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,410
interfering with your progress.
Anyways.

343
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:19,030
When we have people do this exercise,
their grade point average,

344
00:19:19,031 --> 00:19:21,160
for example,
we'd done this with 3000 people so far,

345
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:26,460
grade point average goes up about 25%
dropout rate goes down about 30% so you

346
00:19:27,101 --> 00:19:31,330
know,
it seems like the act of positing value,

347
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,610
so like a valued future or or terribly,
you know,

348
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:39,100
negatively valued future is a
prerequisite to appropriate functional

349
00:19:39,101 --> 00:19:41,080
being.
And so what that means in part is that

350
00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:44,700
human beings are value producing
creatures and there's just no way of,

351
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:48,110
it's,
it's ridiculous to avoid dealing with

352
00:19:48,111 --> 00:19:52,520
that well in a class on personality
despite the fact that it's and as uneasy

353
00:19:52,521 --> 00:19:55,670
balance between science and engineering,
so to speak.

354
00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:01,030
So that's the first part of the course.
All right,

355
00:20:01,281 --> 00:20:03,140
so let's,
let's get into details here.

356
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:07,643
Okay.

357
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,750
We're going to tell you a little bit
about this picture.

358
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,800
That's Jonah.
I don't know how many of you know the

359
00:20:13,801 --> 00:20:16,050
story of Jonah,
but the story basically goes like this.

360
00:20:16,051 --> 00:20:17,900
It's an old testament story.
Um,

361
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,010
God tells Jonah to go off and do
something and he doesn't want to do it.

362
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:27,930
So cause you know,
at least as far as the old testament is

363
00:20:27,931 --> 00:20:29,940
concerned,
God's always telling people to do

364
00:20:29,941 --> 00:20:31,770
horrible and miserable things that are
difficult.

365
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:34,410
And so avoiding it is the logical thing
to do.

366
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:39,590
So Jonah goes out on a boat trying to
get away from this demand and there's a

367
00:20:39,691 --> 00:20:43,050
huge storm and you know,
the boat is in danger of being swamped

368
00:20:43,051 --> 00:20:45,550
and um,
the so,

369
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,750
so sailors are all wondering this storm
is happening and Joan and finally admits

370
00:20:49,751 --> 00:20:50,660
that he's,
you know,

371
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,570
got this command from God.
He's running away from it.

372
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:55,480
So they throw him overboard and then
sees common.

373
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,850
Anyways,
Joan ends up inside this whale and then

374
00:20:57,851 --> 00:20:58,960
later,
three days later,

375
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:01,000
as it happens,
it's spits them up back on shore.

376
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,090
Now
you might think,

377
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:06,460
why the hell are you telling us this
story?

378
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,300
But I can give you a hint about why I'm
telling you this story.

379
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:15,040
Uh,
remember the last time that you broke

380
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,860
through the thin ice that you're skating
on all the time.

381
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,140
You know,
everybody knows what that means,

382
00:21:20,141 --> 00:21:22,630
right?
Is that you're cruising along in your

383
00:21:22,631 --> 00:21:27,520
life perfectly content or at least
reasonably content,

384
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:29,710
and then something strikes you out of
the blue.

385
00:21:29,711 --> 00:21:31,450
Maybe it's the death of someone that you
love,

386
00:21:31,451 --> 00:21:34,880
or it's the breakup of a relationship or
something that you failed dismally at,

387
00:21:34,881 --> 00:21:38,710
or some manner in which you'd be trade a
friend or they betrayed you and all of a

388
00:21:38,711 --> 00:21:41,260
sudden,
everything that you stand on disappears

389
00:21:41,261 --> 00:21:42,580
and you get swallowed up.

390
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,490
Oh,
it turns out that the Motif of being

391
00:21:45,491 --> 00:21:49,450
swallowed by something that lurks
underneath like the,

392
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,390
like the shark in jaws.
It's a very,

393
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:55,180
very old story.
In fact,

394
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,850
it's the oldest story that human beings
tell.

395
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,800
It's the same story,
for example,

396
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,480
that you see,
if you watched the hobbit guys,

397
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:06,220
how many of you have seen the hobbit
recently or the Lord of the Rings?

398
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,050
Yeah,
yeah.

399
00:22:08,051 --> 00:22:08,411
Well,
you know,

400
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:11,830
in the harbor,
the little hobbit encounters a dragon,

401
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:13,870
right?
And everyone seems to understand what

402
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:16,450
that means even though it's completely
absurd proposition.

403
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:20,620
And that's allied with this sort of,
this sort of pattern of story.

404
00:22:20,621 --> 00:22:22,960
And the idea is something like this is
that

405
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,920
your,
your,

406
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:32,560
your current pattern of being is
fragile.

407
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:36,400
And the reason for that is that there's
not very much of you and there's an

408
00:22:36,401 --> 00:22:40,270
awful lot of the world.
And what that means is that at any

409
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:43,660
moment,
some element of the world that you have

410
00:22:43,661 --> 00:22:48,661
not mastered and do not understand can
emerge and destroy you potentially your

411
00:22:51,401 --> 00:22:54,190
psychological health,
your physical health and your dreams.

412
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,530
And that puts you somewhere.
And the ancients believed that that put

413
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:02,950
you somewhere that was akin to being
devoured by a great beast.

414
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,080
And if you're lucky,
then you know,

415
00:23:05,081 --> 00:23:07,840
it spits you up later.
If you're unlucky,

416
00:23:07,841 --> 00:23:09,590
then you stay inside it.
And you know,

417
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:12,640
those are the sorts of people that you
see in mental hospitals are wandering

418
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,320
around on the streets.
You know,

419
00:23:14,321 --> 00:23:16,420
hearing voices and talking to
themselves,

420
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:22,000
they never get out.
And the standard transformative

421
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:27,420
narrative is descent an asset.
You learn something by deteriorating

422
00:23:27,521 --> 00:23:30,340
first and then by reascended as you
incorporate it.

423
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,410
And I love the story because,
well,

424
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,740
the first of all to know that story,
which is the fundamental story of

425
00:23:35,741 --> 00:23:38,170
mankind,
to know that story means first of all,

426
00:23:38,171 --> 00:23:42,850
that you understand that there's no
learning without pain and the pain is a

427
00:23:42,851 --> 00:23:45,190
necessary prerequisite to
transformation.

428
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,080
Now the pain doesn't necessarily have to
be of the sort that completely destroys

429
00:23:49,081 --> 00:23:51,330
you.
But generally a valuable lesson is one

430
00:23:51,331 --> 00:23:54,540
that's difficult to learn.
And what that also means something very

431
00:23:54,541 --> 00:23:56,370
interesting about the human psyche
because,

432
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,590
and this is something to really think
about too,

433
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,090
you know,
cause you might say,

434
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:06,320
are you who you are
or are you who you could be or are you

435
00:24:08,431 --> 00:24:11,760
the thing that changes from who you are
to what you could be?

436
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,273
And

437
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,810
which of those things you identify with
makes a huge difference to your life.

438
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,540
So for example,
if you are who you are,

439
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,360
then you can't talk to someone who
doesn't agree with you.

440
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:29,820
You can't listen to them because they
may tell you something that you don't

441
00:24:29,821 --> 00:24:33,120
already know and that'll change you.
And if you are who you are and that's

442
00:24:33,121 --> 00:24:35,190
the right way to be,
then you don't want to be changed.

443
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,710
And if you are who you're going to be in
the future,

444
00:24:37,711 --> 00:24:42,210
then if any circumstance comes along to
destabilize the environment so that that

445
00:24:42,211 --> 00:24:45,240
future becomes unlikely,
then you're in the same boat.

446
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,860
Things are going to fall apart around
you.

447
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:51,540
But if you're the thing that can change
when change is necessary,

448
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,320
well then you don't have to be who you
are or who you could be.

449
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:59,370
You can be the thing that changes.
And then when new things come along,

450
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,440
regardless of how they're presented to
you,

451
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:07,260
well then you can welcome them even
though they're going to destabilize you

452
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:12,470
in the hope that what comes out the next
what comes out the other side will be an

453
00:25:12,871 --> 00:25:15,060
improved version of you.

454
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,560
One of the things that all talk to you
about,

455
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:25,580
especially in the first couple of
lectures is the notion that the idea

456
00:25:25,891 --> 00:25:30,891
that you should identify with the part
of your psyche that can transform is

457
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:37,530
actually one of the world's most
fundamental religious ideas and the

458
00:25:37,531 --> 00:25:40,580
reason I'm discussing religious ideas
with you in part is Walt's.

459
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:44,640
Partly because when we deal with some of
the more profound thinkers in the early

460
00:25:44,641 --> 00:25:47,850
part of the chorus and the part that
deals with psychoanalysis like young for

461
00:25:47,851 --> 00:25:52,851
example being use depth psychology goes
down deep enough into the psyche so that

462
00:25:53,791 --> 00:25:58,260
the appropriate language to describe the
phenomena that he is dealing with is

463
00:25:58,261 --> 00:26:03,120
always religious language is young sort
of conceptualized religious language,

464
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:07,830
religious symbols as the grammatical,
as part of the grammatical structure of

465
00:26:07,831 --> 00:26:12,180
the psyche.
So that's an archetype by the way,

466
00:26:12,181 --> 00:26:13,380
that's what an archetype is.

467
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:16,500
An archetype is,
is part of the structure of the psyche.

468
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,450
It's,
it's something you can't escape from.

469
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:21,120
So I could give you,
I'll give you a quick example of that.

470
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:22,163
So,
um,

471
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:26,550
men are much more visually oriented
towards sexual stimuli than women.

472
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,820
It appears that way.
Women seem to be more oriented towards

473
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:33,000
auditory sexual stimuli.
So for example,

474
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,420
there was a book published a little
while ago called dataclysm.

475
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,040
It's,
it's the first third of,

476
00:26:38,041 --> 00:26:39,460
it's quite interesting.
It,

477
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,020
it's written by one of the Google
analytics guys and it's,

478
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,540
sorry,
I'm sorry I'm wrong.

479
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:48,180
It's called a billion wicked thoughts.
I read too,

480
00:26:48,181 --> 00:26:51,480
that we're dealing with Internet
phenomena is called a billion wicked

481
00:26:51,481 --> 00:26:52,800
thoughts.
And,

482
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:54,780
uh,
the authors were analyzing,

483
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,180
uh,
pornography usage on the web.

484
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,193
And you know,
of course,

485
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:01,950
for the longest time,
about 35% of web traffic was pornography

486
00:27:01,951 --> 00:27:04,350
and it actually really got the web
going,

487
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,273
weirdly enough.

488
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:07,260
Men.
Yeah,

489
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:08,041
it's strange,
you know,

490
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:11,700
and so that sexual motivation was what
drove to technological innovation.

491
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,470
It's interesting.
Even now,

492
00:27:13,471 --> 00:27:15,240
you know,
one of the things that's driving

493
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:18,720
computer chip technology is the
necessity for making more and more

494
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:19,870
accurate,
um,

495
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,730
CGI movies.
So it's very strange things often that

496
00:27:23,731 --> 00:27:25,170
motivate human progress,
right?

497
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,110
On the one hand,
it's the desire for entertainment more

498
00:27:28,111 --> 00:27:30,750
and more realistic artificial
entertainment.

499
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:31,920
On the other hand,
it's sex,

500
00:27:31,921 --> 00:27:34,830
which is exactly what Freud would
presume anyways,

501
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,080
man,
look at visual stimuli and women read

502
00:27:37,081 --> 00:27:42,081
pornography.
So now with regards to men,

503
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:47,030
there some things you can say about what
men find attractive sexually if they're,

504
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,140
if they're heterosexual.
So for example,

505
00:27:49,141 --> 00:27:54,060
they prefer a west waist to hip ratio of
about 0.68 and that's standard across

506
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:57,060
body types.
So a thin woman who has a hip waist to

507
00:27:57,061 --> 00:28:00,570
hip ratio of 0.68 is attractive and uh,
you know,

508
00:28:00,571 --> 00:28:04,680
a mesomorphic woman,
woman of medium build with a waist to

509
00:28:04,681 --> 00:28:06,840
hip ratio of 0.68 is also attractive.

510
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:10,470
And that's in some sense,
that's the function of the archetype.

511
00:28:10,471 --> 00:28:13,260
And that archetype would be the
archetype of air oss or Venus or,

512
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,560
or beauty.
And if the problem with those archetypes

513
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:18,270
in some sense,
and this is what makes the market

514
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:20,730
tipple,
is you can't argue yourself out of them.

515
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,420
They're in built.
They're like,

516
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:27,870
they're part of your operating system to
use a terrible analogy.

517
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,950
So anyways,
he owns,

518
00:28:30,951 --> 00:28:35,951
his claim was that the architectural
images are religious fundamentally that

519
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,800
they hit you with the force of
religious,

520
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,590
uh,
what's the word?

521
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,860
Re revelation.
So,

522
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:50,450
so that's all in that picture.
Say,

523
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,600
you know,
a picture's worth a thousand words and

524
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,410
that one's worth a lot more than a
thousand.

525
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,470
You know,
you also might ask yourself,

526
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:00,360
you know,
why don't people do what's right?

527
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:03,500
It's a good question because
hypothetically they could,

528
00:29:03,501 --> 00:29:05,460
and the answer seems to be something
like,

529
00:29:05,461 --> 00:29:08,580
well,
transforming yourself into something

530
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:12,180
that's continually better means
continually being swallowed up by

531
00:29:12,181 --> 00:29:13,200
something like this.

532
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,010
And so it's hard and frightening.
So that's why people aren't enlightened

533
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:21,540
and there's gotta be some reason given
that it's hypothetically possible.

534
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,910
You know,
when you hear people like Joseph

535
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,560
Campbell say things like,
follow your bliss,

536
00:29:25,561 --> 00:29:27,300
you know,
and so that sounds pretty easy.

537
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,270
You want to develop your personality,
just do what you love.

538
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,720
You know it's a corruption of Carl
Jung's thinking because young would say,

539
00:29:33,721 --> 00:29:35,370
well,
follow what you're interested.

540
00:29:35,371 --> 00:29:37,500
It'll take you somewhere you really
don't want to go.

541
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,740
And then maybe you learn something.
So,

542
00:29:40,741 --> 00:29:43,510
and that's a whole different,
that's a whole different proposition.

543
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,060
So,
okay,

544
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,970
I already asked you to write down the
website.

545
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,050
So it's easy to find.
You just have to type my name into the

546
00:29:53,051 --> 00:29:55,330
web and my website will come up and then
you can find the course.

547
00:29:55,331 --> 00:29:58,600
But I would still write it down.
I'll show it to you again at the end of

548
00:29:58,601 --> 00:30:01,090
class for those who didn't,
who didn't get it.

549
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:02,890
All right.
So

550
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,910
here's the basic,
here's what we're going to try to do

551
00:30:06,911 --> 00:30:08,410
during this semester.

552
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,700
In some sense,
this is,

553
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:16,550
I've tried to structure this class in
some sense,

554
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:19,040
both sort of historically and
developmentally.

555
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:25,030
So the first thing that I want to
describe to you is an elaborated version

556
00:30:26,721 --> 00:30:30,110
of what I just did when I was telling
you about the Jonah image.

557
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:35,590
I want to talk to you about an array of
what you might describe as eternal

558
00:30:36,171 --> 00:30:40,640
images there or they're like eternal
characters in a story that our

559
00:30:40,641 --> 00:30:42,680
architectural,
and I want to show you how those have

560
00:30:42,681 --> 00:30:47,230
been represented by cultures that we
would regard as say pre-scientific.

561
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,800
I think that's a good way to think about
them.

562
00:30:48,801 --> 00:30:52,370
So those are cultures that haven't
precisely divided the world up into

563
00:30:52,371 --> 00:30:55,940
objective reality and subjective
experience.

564
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:59,990
And there's a,
there seems to be something like a set

565
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:04,700
of constant reference that human beings
have used all over the world to orient

566
00:31:04,701 --> 00:31:07,010
themselves in their existence.

567
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:11,090
And so I want to talk to you about those
because I think one of the things that

568
00:31:11,091 --> 00:31:15,130
does is that it provides you with an
underlying theory metatheory it's a

569
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:20,030
better way of of thinking about it,
a metatheory into which you can plug all

570
00:31:20,031 --> 00:31:22,370
the particular theories that we're going
to talk about.

571
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,350
You know,
because one of the strange things about

572
00:31:24,351 --> 00:31:26,900
personality theory is that it's not
exactly integrated.

573
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,110
There's an,
I suppose that's also partly because

574
00:31:30,111 --> 00:31:34,640
it's still a pre science in some ways.
So there are a variety of different

575
00:31:34,641 --> 00:31:38,840
theories and all of the theories have
somewhat different claims and all of the

576
00:31:38,841 --> 00:31:42,920
claims seem logically coherent,
appropriate and applicable,

577
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:46,940
but they don't necessarily seem mutually
inclusive.

578
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:50,870
So thinker a might claim one thing and
think you're be another and the two

579
00:31:50,871 --> 00:31:54,470
things aren't.
They can't logically coexist.

580
00:31:54,471 --> 00:31:59,180
And so that makes learning about
personality theory difficult because

581
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:05,190
things that aren't coherent across any
distance of any length of time or

582
00:32:05,191 --> 00:32:07,320
difficult to remember.
So anyways,

583
00:32:07,321 --> 00:32:10,440
I'm going to provide you with an
underlying metatheory and then we're

584
00:32:10,441 --> 00:32:13,920
going to try to plug all the different
theorists into that metatheory and then

585
00:32:13,921 --> 00:32:18,420
hopefully that'll give you a nice
coherent and memorable account of

586
00:32:18,421 --> 00:32:23,421
personality and its transformations.
So that's mythological representations.

587
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,210
I'm going to show you how the
personality has been represented since

588
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:29,850
history began,
literally since history began because

589
00:32:29,851 --> 00:32:34,830
the oldest written documents that we
have are about personality and its

590
00:32:34,831 --> 00:32:36,930
transformations.
So,

591
00:32:36,931 --> 00:32:40,580
and interestingly enough,
those tell a story that you're all

592
00:32:40,581 --> 00:32:45,581
entirely familiar with and that you've
seen hundreds of times as you've grown

593
00:32:45,651 --> 00:32:48,650
up.
They're constantly represented in movies

594
00:32:48,651 --> 00:32:52,670
and in tv shows and everything that you
would regard as an infj brawling

595
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:55,250
narrative.
Because one of the things you might ask

596
00:32:55,251 --> 00:32:57,080
yourself is,
why the hell are you interested in

597
00:32:57,081 --> 00:32:57,914
stories?

598
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,920
You know,
why are you interested in watching TV?

599
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:02,600
Why are you interested in going to
movies?

600
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:04,250
You know,
you'll line up and pay for them.

601
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:08,030
It's very strange behavior.
And you often see in movies things that

602
00:33:08,031 --> 00:33:11,770
are completely impossible and yet you
swallow them without a second's thought.

603
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,081
It's,
you know,

604
00:33:12,081 --> 00:33:14,870
as long as they're done in a reasonable
manner that allow you to,

605
00:33:14,871 --> 00:33:18,710
in some sense to suspend disbelief.
You get completely engaged.

606
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:21,830
And a lot of the early theorists,
the ones that we're going to talk about,

607
00:33:21,831 --> 00:33:23,750
especially with regards to depth
psychology,

608
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:29,380
posited that the human personality was
in fact a narrative or even even more

609
00:33:29,601 --> 00:33:34,550
deeply that human experience,
which you could think of as existence

610
00:33:34,551 --> 00:33:39,230
itself has a narrative structure.
Now that's a pretty broad claim,

611
00:33:39,231 --> 00:33:40,880
but you know,
there's been some pretty,

612
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:45,260
there's been some heavyweight
philosophers who've wandered down that

613
00:33:45,261 --> 00:33:46,170
road.
So heidegger,

614
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,450
for example,
is one of them.

615
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,820
So,
and that's very,

616
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:53,600
that's a very interesting thing to
consider because it's certainly the case

617
00:33:53,601 --> 00:33:56,660
that human beings,
if you talk about a human being,

618
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:59,060
you tend to use something that's like a
story.

619
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:03,320
And when you recount your own being,
you tend to use something like a story.

620
00:34:03,321 --> 00:34:05,600
And that sort of begs the question,
you know,

621
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:10,280
does that mean in fact that your
experience is either a story or

622
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:11,430
something like a story?

623
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,280
One of the things young said I really
like this is you should figure out which

624
00:34:18,281 --> 00:34:21,940
story you're living because you're
living a story and it might be a

625
00:34:21,941 --> 00:34:24,940
tragedy.
And so you know,

626
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,930
you want to find out because if it's a
tragedy you don't come to a very good

627
00:34:28,931 --> 00:34:31,990
end.
Another thing young said was this is

628
00:34:31,991 --> 00:34:35,290
also worth thinking about.
People don't have ideas,

629
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:41,330
ideas have people.
And so what we are dealing with say is

630
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:44,810
that if you're living out of tragedy,
the tragedy has you,

631
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:48,020
you don't have it.
And if you can figure out what the

632
00:34:48,021 --> 00:34:51,830
tragedy is that has you in its grip,
then you have a fighting chance of

633
00:34:51,831 --> 00:34:54,680
escaping from it into a more pleasing
plot.

634
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,650
But it's no easy thing,
you know?

635
00:34:57,651 --> 00:35:02,651
So if you're one of those people to whom
the same terrible thing keeps happening

636
00:35:03,921 --> 00:35:07,790
over and over after the third time,
approximately,

637
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:09,250
you might ask yourself,
you know,

638
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:12,710
is this the world or is this me?

639
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,030
All right.
So we,

640
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:22,020
we moved from mythological
representations into a discussion of

641
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:26,790
both heroic and shamanic initiations.
And the reason we're going to talk about

642
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,830
shamonic initiations is,
first of all,

643
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:34,020
they are a logical,
there are logical next step in moving

644
00:35:34,021 --> 00:35:36,990
from the fundamental mythology into
depth psychology.

645
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:42,290
But also because initiation processes
are processes that archaic people have

646
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:46,380
used learning to use to catalyze
personality transformation.

647
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:50,080
So for example,
a typical initiation tends to be more

648
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:52,780
young men who are initiated more often
than young women.

649
00:35:52,781 --> 00:35:57,300
And the hypothesis there is that mother
nature initiates young women all on her

650
00:35:57,301 --> 00:35:58,950
own.
Whereas with young men,

651
00:35:58,951 --> 00:36:02,250
something has to be imposed from a
cultural perspective in order to

652
00:36:02,251 --> 00:36:07,110
catalyze their transition from childhood
dependency and make them independent

653
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:09,840
adults.
And that usually involves some

654
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,980
relatively terrible experience that I
think it does.

655
00:36:13,981 --> 00:36:17,520
Two things.
One is it helps the person defined what

656
00:36:17,521 --> 00:36:19,650
actually constitutes terrible.

657
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,660
Cause you might ask yourself,
you know,

658
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,970
how worried should you be about
something?

659
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,790
You know,
let's say you wake up in the morning and

660
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:28,020
you know you've,
you've got a wide,

661
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:30,060
I know you've got an ache in your side.
It's like,

662
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,280
okay,
it wasn't there the night before.

663
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:34,320
So what does that mean?
Well,

664
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,700
you pulled a muscle or you're going to
die of cancer in three months.

665
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:43,230
It's like you don't know.
So how upset should you be?

666
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,510
Well,
the answer is you don't know.

667
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:50,460
And I think one of the things that
initiation process is due to people is,

668
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:54,900
um,
calibrate their anxiety systems.

669
00:36:55,350 --> 00:37:00,300
So you know,
unless you've been required at some

670
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:05,301
point in your existence to face
something that is truly awful without

671
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:09,900
destroying you,
maybe you don't know how to calibrate

672
00:37:09,901 --> 00:37:11,790
what you should be worried about and
what you shouldn't.

673
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:17,100
And it seems to be the implicit theory
upon which initiation rituals are

674
00:37:17,101 --> 00:37:17,730
predicated.

675
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:18,091
You know,
and they,

676
00:37:18,091 --> 00:37:20,310
they tend to reemerge spontaneously.
You know,

677
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,170
you see them reemerge,
for example,

678
00:37:22,171 --> 00:37:24,810
in situations like fraternity hazing,
you know,

679
00:37:24,811 --> 00:37:28,230
or medical residency for that matter.
Because if you're going to be a medical

680
00:37:28,231 --> 00:37:31,170
resident,
you can be completely assured that

681
00:37:31,171 --> 00:37:33,810
you're going to be tortured to death for
two years.

682
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,430
So,
and when you come out of that,

683
00:37:35,431 --> 00:37:37,890
you won't be the same person that you
were when you went in.

684
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:42,240
And it isn't necessarily the case that
that will be that you'll be better.

685
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:47,270
But that's a different issue.
So I want to talk about the structure of

686
00:37:47,581 --> 00:37:52,581
shamonic and heroic initiations,
partly to further our understanding of

687
00:37:54,361 --> 00:37:59,340
personality transformation,
but also partly to give you an idea of

688
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:04,910
the body of
the relationship between the symbolic

689
00:38:05,251 --> 00:38:10,140
realm and the,
and the day to day realm prior to the

690
00:38:10,141 --> 00:38:14,970
emergence of psycho analysis.
Because when psychoanalysis emerged in

691
00:38:14,971 --> 00:38:19,470
the first part of the 20th century,
the psychoanalysts,

692
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:22,980
mostly Freud,
and you discovered what you might regard

693
00:38:22,981 --> 00:38:26,060
as a symbolic realm they associated it
with,

694
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:27,060
with within.

695
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:32,310
So the symbolic realm in terms of your
experience might be what you dream at

696
00:38:32,581 --> 00:38:33,361
night.
You know,

697
00:38:33,361 --> 00:38:35,110
how bizarre dreams are.
You know,

698
00:38:35,111 --> 00:38:37,030
when there's debate about whether
they're interpretable,

699
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,850
say some people's dreams are
interpretable and some people's aren't

700
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:41,710
in my experience.
But it's,

701
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:42,850
uh,
the dream realm,

702
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,600
for example,
is very peculiar because obviously you

703
00:38:46,601 --> 00:38:51,490
experience it,
it's quasi coherent in that when you

704
00:38:51,491 --> 00:38:53,170
wake up and you remember it,
you can,

705
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,700
you can remember it.
First of all,

706
00:38:54,701 --> 00:38:57,640
it's not random.
It's not like white noise on a blank

707
00:38:57,641 --> 00:38:58,451
screen.
You know,

708
00:38:58,451 --> 00:38:59,890
it's,
it has characters,

709
00:38:59,891 --> 00:39:01,880
they're doing things.
Um,

710
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:03,960
although there are,
you know,

711
00:39:03,970 --> 00:39:07,060
there are dynamic jumps usually in the
narrative structure that make it

712
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:10,030
difficult to understand.
There are chunks of it that are clearly

713
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:13,870
comprehensible and that seemed to have
the same quality.

714
00:39:13,871 --> 00:39:16,970
Roughly speaking is something cinematic.
Um,

715
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,560
things transform in peculiar ways in
dreams.

716
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:24,880
The normal laws of physics are often
suspended in one way or another.

717
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,550
So people frequently dream of flying,
for example.

718
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,200
Um,
and most peculiarly dreams seem to

719
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:34,210
happen to you,
you know,

720
00:39:34,211 --> 00:39:34,991
because you say,
well,

721
00:39:34,991 --> 00:39:38,170
I drank last night,
but that doesn't generally mean that,

722
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,690
you know,
you decided which movie to play in your

723
00:39:40,691 --> 00:39:43,210
head so to speak.
It seems when you're dreaming that

724
00:39:43,211 --> 00:39:46,930
things happen to you,
you're in your dream that are like the

725
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:50,950
things that happened to you in regular
life in that they happen.

726
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:55,090
You don't make them happen.
So in a dream,

727
00:39:55,091 --> 00:39:58,330
you're the subject of uncontrollable
forces in some sense,

728
00:39:58,331 --> 00:40:00,520
just as you are in waking life.
It's like,

729
00:40:00,521 --> 00:40:03,280
okay,
well who in the world is dreaming?

730
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,310
You know,
it's not the ego obviously cause he

731
00:40:06,311 --> 00:40:08,650
can't control it unless you happen to be
a lucid dreamer.

732
00:40:08,651 --> 00:40:10,660
You know,
some people can become conscious during

733
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:14,290
their dreams and exercise a certain
degree of control over the contents.

734
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,730
Although it's a relatively,
it's a relatively undeveloped skill.

735
00:40:18,731 --> 00:40:21,880
It's not particularly rare.
How many of you have had lucid dreams?

736
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,760
Yeah,
it's very much,

737
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:28,360
much more common among women generally
for reasons we don't really understand

738
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,790
so,
but most of the time a dream is

739
00:40:30,791 --> 00:40:33,850
something in which you're embedded.
It's like what's dreaming exactly.

740
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:35,410
You know,
you would say,

741
00:40:35,411 --> 00:40:37,390
well the world is dreaming inside of
you.

742
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:42,930
It's nature dreaming inside of you.
It's a natural phenomena and it has the

743
00:40:43,301 --> 00:40:46,510
same kind of meaning that any other
natural phenomena has,

744
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:50,350
which is what meaning that you can
discover that turns out to be useful.

745
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:55,890
So there's a relationship between that
internal set of processes,

746
00:40:56,291 --> 00:40:58,540
you know,
that deeply symbolic set of processes

747
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:03,750
and the kinds of rituals and symbols
that are used in archaic ceremonies like

748
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:07,480
heroic in Shamanic initiations.
And so that's partly why I wanted to

749
00:41:07,481 --> 00:41:08,314
tell you about them.

750
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:11,950
I'd also helps you understand,
I think a little more deeply

751
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,680
the price that you have to pay in order
for transfer in order to transform.

752
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:23,280
Because the rule in most archaic
cultures is that to transform a male

753
00:41:23,471 --> 00:41:28,300
adolescent into a man requires
dismantling the childhood personality

754
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:31,930
often rather brutally,
and replacing it with something that's

755
00:41:31,931 --> 00:41:33,740
new.
And so,

756
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,271
you know,
you might think,

757
00:41:35,271 --> 00:41:37,520
well perhaps the brutality isn't
necessary,

758
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,433
but,
um,

759
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:42,830
it's hard to say what's necessary.
You know,

760
00:41:42,831 --> 00:41:47,831
there's a rule in,
in psychological therapy and the rule is

761
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,290
if you want to improve,
you have to identify what it is that

762
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:59,150
you're afraid of that stopping you.
And then you have to confront it.

763
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:02,600
And you have to do that voluntarily.
It's the primary rule.

764
00:42:02,601 --> 00:42:04,760
You might say it's primary rule of
psychotherapy.

765
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:07,130
You're going somewhere there,
impediments,

766
00:42:07,131 --> 00:42:11,000
the impediments make you afraid because
you're afraid you start progressing.

767
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:15,230
So what do you have to do?
You have to face the things that are

768
00:42:15,231 --> 00:42:17,290
stopping you voluntarily,
you know?

769
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,270
And that's part of the heroic,
that's actually part of standard hero

770
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,850
narratives,
which is face the thing that you're

771
00:42:22,851 --> 00:42:24,110
afraid of.
And that's why,

772
00:42:24,111 --> 00:42:25,300
for example,
in the Hobbit,

773
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,050
Frodo,
Frodo,

774
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,120
Frodo is not bill bose.
The second one.

775
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,760
Yeah.
Frodo has to face the dragon and the

776
00:42:31,761 --> 00:42:34,670
dragon hordes gold.
Billable.

777
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,630
Sorry.
Well thank you.

778
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,430
Yes,
that is what I was asking.

779
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,910
Bilbo has to face the dragon and the
dragon hordes gold.

780
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:44,300
It's like what the hell does a giant
reptile need with gold?

781
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:48,000
Well,
the answer to that in part is that the,

782
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:52,220
the giant reptile represents that which
you are afraid of.

783
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:56,060
And the treasure that it sits on
represents what you gain if you conquer

784
00:42:56,061 --> 00:42:58,940
what you're afraid of.
And it's an architectural story in some

785
00:42:58,941 --> 00:43:03,941
sense because you can't invent a more
frightening story than that more

786
00:43:04,161 --> 00:43:04,580
frightening.

787
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,950
And Richard Story,
there's nothing more frightening than a

788
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:08,750
dragon,
roughly speaking.

789
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,240
And there's nothing more valuable than a
hoard of gold.

790
00:43:11,241 --> 00:43:13,430
And that's partly what makes the story
archetipal right?

791
00:43:13,431 --> 00:43:17,800
It's taken the phenomena and extended
them to the point of,

792
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:21,650
of maximum return in some sense.
So

793
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:28,180
constructivism as piaget mostly,
and a

794
00:43:31,310 --> 00:43:33,770
PSA called himself a genetic
epistemologist,

795
00:43:33,771 --> 00:43:36,020
which is hardly the same thing as a
psychologist.

796
00:43:36,021 --> 00:43:40,540
But Piaget was actually interested this,
and this is something you won't hear in

797
00:43:40,541 --> 00:43:44,510
most classes about piaget.
When Piaget was a adolescent,

798
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:50,240
he was very obsessed by the growing
split between religion and science.

799
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:53,280
In fact,
he wrote a novel about that and uh,

800
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:57,260
he took it upon himself.
His life's goal was to reconcile the gap

801
00:43:57,261 --> 00:44:00,360
between religion and science.
So there's something you don't know.

802
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:04,730
Did anybody know that about piaget?
How many people know you knew that?

803
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:08,180
How did you learn that?
Huh?

804
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:08,690
Wow,
that's,

805
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:13,010
that's a good way of learning things.
So how many of you knew who knew who

806
00:44:13,011 --> 00:44:15,230
piaget is?
Oh,

807
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,470
that's good.
How many don't you?

808
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,190
It's okay if you don't.
You're probably engineers or some damn

809
00:44:19,191 --> 00:44:20,024
thing.
So

810
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,330
yeah.
Anyways,

811
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:28,160
Piaget became interested in how
knowledge is developed and he started

812
00:44:28,161 --> 00:44:33,161
with the infant and he's very interested
in how the infant who is an embodied

813
00:44:33,241 --> 00:44:34,170
creature,
you know,

814
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:36,720
who has a body,
which turns out to be very important if

815
00:44:36,721 --> 00:44:40,080
you want to have a psyche,
how the infant comes to construct his

816
00:44:40,081 --> 00:44:42,210
world.
And I really liked the PSG and approach

817
00:44:42,211 --> 00:44:46,260
because it melds nicely with our
discussion of both personality,

818
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:50,220
the stable elements of personality and
the transformative elements of

819
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:51,390
personality.
So,

820
00:44:51,391 --> 00:44:53,340
you know,
cause piaget has a stage theory of

821
00:44:53,341 --> 00:44:56,970
development and um,
he doesn't concentrate a tremendous

822
00:44:56,971 --> 00:45:00,900
amount on the intervening period of
chaos between the stages of development.

823
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:01,890
But,
um,

824
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:05,010
but,
but the idea is still there.

825
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:09,120
So as it is,
say in a Thomas Kuhn's work on the

826
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:12,820
history of science,
which piaget was aware of [inaudible]

827
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:17,520
from.
So I want to lay out the Piagetian

828
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:22,590
theory because
one of the things that piaget was really

829
00:45:22,591 --> 00:45:27,591
good at was understanding that the
psyche is not like a floating soul.

830
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,640
And you know,
people,

831
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:33,420
we believe perhaps that we've dispensed
with most of the religious

832
00:45:33,421 --> 00:45:36,180
presuppositions that interfere with our
scientific clarity,

833
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,680
which we certainly haven't.
But one idea that's,

834
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:44,550
that lurks deeply,
it's very difficult to abandoned for a

835
00:45:44,551 --> 00:45:47,070
variety of reasons is the idea that,
you know,

836
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:51,180
you have a consciousness that sort of
like a soul that sort of stuck in your

837
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:52,560
body.
You know,

838
00:45:52,561 --> 00:45:55,050
and that's sort of,
you might think about that as your ego

839
00:45:55,051 --> 00:45:59,430
or you might think about it as the I
that you experienced when you talk about

840
00:45:59,431 --> 00:46:01,800
yourself it's like a floating
consciousness,

841
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,270
you know,
and that that's,

842
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:07,110
that's led people like artificial
intelligence researchers for the longest

843
00:46:07,111 --> 00:46:12,111
time to imagine that they could embody a
mind inside complicated machines and in

844
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:16,220
that would function perhaps in the same
way that your mind functions.

845
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:20,910
Piaget is a really good antidote to that
because what piaget points out very

846
00:46:20,911 --> 00:46:25,911
clearly is that you cannot have a mind
like we have without having the body to

847
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:29,760
begin with.
And so the one of the ways that you can

848
00:46:29,761 --> 00:46:33,300
conceptualize that cause it's very
important is that your personality is

849
00:46:33,301 --> 00:46:38,301
actually oriented towards action rather
than perception of the object of worlds.

850
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:40,470
Like what the hell do you care about the
objective world?

851
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:43,050
We didn't even discover it until 500
years ago.

852
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:44,420
You know,
in,

853
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,860
in a sense,
what you're concerned about is how to

854
00:46:46,861 --> 00:46:51,600
act in the world and your conceptions,
although you may think about them as

855
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:55,020
conceptions of the objective world,
that isn't what they are,

856
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:59,580
what they are instead is abstractions of
how to act in the world.

857
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:04,380
And Piaget explains this in a beautiful
way because he starts with the infant

858
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:09,710
and he talks about how the infant's body
develops in sync with its psyche and how

859
00:47:09,781 --> 00:47:14,070
the two things are like absolutely
integrally interlock.

860
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:16,320
And it's a lovely idea.
And I,

861
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:20,310
I think not only do I think it's right,
I think that all the evidence in the

862
00:47:20,311 --> 00:47:23,220
last 30 years points towards being
right.

863
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:25,770
You know,
we haven't been able to make artificial

864
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:30,490
intelligence without embodying the
intelligence in something that acts.

865
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,550
So for example,
the Google cars or they're getting

866
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:35,830
pretty damn smart,
but they have a body.

867
00:47:35,831 --> 00:47:37,780
Fundamentally,
there are things that can act in the

868
00:47:37,781 --> 00:47:38,890
world,
you know,

869
00:47:38,891 --> 00:47:42,790
and it turns out to be more difficult to
walk than it does to calculate,

870
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:45,970
you know,
extremely complex mathematical formula,

871
00:47:45,971 --> 00:47:47,340
which a computer can do.
And you know,

872
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:50,650
a billionth of a second,
even though we haven't got computers

873
00:47:50,651 --> 00:47:53,800
that can walk around in the real world,
that turns out to be difficult.

874
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:58,330
So Piaget tells you how to build a
psyche from the bottom up and it's,

875
00:47:58,331 --> 00:47:59,200
it's uh,
it's,

876
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:03,430
it's a prerequisite I think for accurate
understanding of the sorts of things

877
00:48:03,431 --> 00:48:06,340
that we're going to discuss as we
progress.

878
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,250
Then we turned to the depth psychologist
and

879
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:16,970
people usually start talking about depth
psychology,

880
00:48:16,971 --> 00:48:21,920
psychoanalysis with Freud,
and then move to young saying perhaps

881
00:48:21,921 --> 00:48:23,450
Adler as

882
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,150
yeah,

883
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:27,310
accomplices or no,
that's not the right word.

884
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:32,440
Um,
apprentices of Freud.

885
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,150
And I think that's probably because the
Freud,

886
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:40,160
Ian's got a hold of the,
had the best biographies written first,

887
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:46,230
but you was influenced by Freud,
but he was equally influenced by nature

888
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:53,330
and it in fact,
umes primary concerns were associated

889
00:48:55,241 --> 00:48:58,170
with niches,
primary concern and niches.

890
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:03,010
Primary concern was that God had died in
the late 1900.

891
00:49:03,011 --> 00:49:06,370
So Nietzsche,
the philosopher announced that it's a

892
00:49:06,371 --> 00:49:08,140
famous announcement.
God is dead.

893
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,360
God is dead.
Sometimes you see that written on

894
00:49:10,361 --> 00:49:12,160
bathroom walls.
God is dead.

895
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,590
Nietzsche.
Nietzsche is dead.

896
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:18,610
God,
what needs you was,

897
00:49:18,611 --> 00:49:21,010
was,
was observing was that,

898
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,530
and this is something you all know
implicitly,

899
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,550
is that the body of knowledge that human
beings had evolved over centuries that

900
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,800
was encapsulated within religious
thinking,

901
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:34,450
had emerged in conflict with the body of
knowledge that was produced primarily in

902
00:49:34,451 --> 00:49:38,560
Europe over about a 400 year period
ending say it in the beginning of the

903
00:49:38,561 --> 00:49:41,500
20th century.
And the two forms of knowledge seemed

904
00:49:41,501 --> 00:49:45,580
incommensurate the claims of religion
and the claims of science did not seem

905
00:49:45,581 --> 00:49:50,170
to be mutually harmonious.
And the consequence of that,

906
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:54,880
as far as Nisha was concerned,
was that the religious substructure upon

907
00:49:54,881 --> 00:49:57,970
which at that point Western civilization
was built,

908
00:49:58,270 --> 00:49:59,103
was

909
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:05,380
rendered invalid.
And the problem with that from a

910
00:50:05,381 --> 00:50:07,630
Nietzschean perspective was while there
were two problems,

911
00:50:07,631 --> 00:50:08,950
one was,
okay,

912
00:50:08,951 --> 00:50:13,570
then what the hell are we doing and why?
And the second was so that's a

913
00:50:13,571 --> 00:50:14,950
nihilistic problem,
right?

914
00:50:14,951 --> 00:50:17,680
If there's no ultimate meaning,
then why do anything?

915
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:21,100
Just perfectly reasonable question.
And then the second problem was,

916
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,950
well,
in the absence of comprehensive systems

917
00:50:23,951 --> 00:50:26,950
of meaning,
if you don't want to be nihilistic,

918
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,200
what do you do?
And each,

919
00:50:28,201 --> 00:50:29,001
his answer was,
well,

920
00:50:29,001 --> 00:50:31,820
you developed totalitarian systems to
replace religion,

921
00:50:31,821 --> 00:50:33,890
which is exactly what happened in the
20th century,

922
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:38,000
and that didn't seem to be a very good
solution and we're certainly not done

923
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:42,110
with that problem yet.
So that's the central problem that needs

924
00:50:42,111 --> 00:50:45,380
your post was like,
we had these evolved systems of meaning

925
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:48,500
and science undercut them or apparently
undercut them,

926
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:52,100
and that left people technologically
enlightened,

927
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:53,930
but spiritually deprived.

928
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:58,100
And that state of spiritual deprivation,
given that your primary orientation in

929
00:50:58,101 --> 00:51:02,210
the world is towards action,
is equivalent to a mass mental disease.

930
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,680
And it manifests itself in nihilism or
in the pension for adopting totalitarian

931
00:51:06,681 --> 00:51:09,020
belief systems.
It's a big problem.

932
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:12,020
It killed millions of people in the 20th
century.

933
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:14,270
You know,
it's not usually regarded as a form of

934
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:16,670
personality pathology,
but that's just because people don't

935
00:51:16,671 --> 00:51:19,640
think about it properly.
I think now,

936
00:51:19,641 --> 00:51:22,940
une was very interested in that problem.
And so

937
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:28,580
as a student of nature and which he was,
he wrote,

938
00:51:28,581 --> 00:51:31,580
for example,
there's a series of lectures that were

939
00:51:31,581 --> 00:51:33,100
published,
uh,

940
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:34,670
as,
as adjuncts to use,

941
00:51:34,671 --> 00:51:39,671
collected word works that I believe are
2,600 pages long and they're written in

942
00:51:40,141 --> 00:51:44,150
very little tight and all they are
commentaries on the first third of a

943
00:51:44,151 --> 00:51:47,510
book called [inaudible],
which is a very short book of very

944
00:51:47,511 --> 00:51:51,920
bizarre because I poetry and it happens
to be the book in which Nietzsche had

945
00:51:51,921 --> 00:51:53,630
his character announced the death of
God.

946
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:58,310
So young was a real nietzschean scholar.
So what yoga was doing,

947
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:03,700
see who thought that basically that as
we d animated the cosmos,

948
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:06,080
so to speak,
you know,

949
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:09,620
as as the projections of Daddy's that
human beings had created,

950
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:12,560
had been pulled in from the objective
world,

951
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:14,960
they didn't disappear.
They weren't destroyed,

952
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,400
as,
as,

953
00:52:16,401 --> 00:52:20,420
as Nietzsche might've presumed,
they sort of went into hiding inside the

954
00:52:20,421 --> 00:52:22,520
psyche,
which is where the era where they

955
00:52:22,521 --> 00:52:26,180
originated from to begin with.
They originated in the imagination.

956
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,750
Now,
a standard objective scientist would

957
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:30,351
say,
well,

958
00:52:30,351 --> 00:52:33,620
if they originated in the imagination,
they aren't real.

959
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:36,620
Whereas young would say,
don't kid yourself,

960
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:41,300
the imagination is real.
It's just a different category of real

961
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,370
and that you better learn how to deal
with it.

962
00:52:43,371 --> 00:52:48,371
Because whether you know it or not,
you are pawns of your imagination in the

963
00:52:49,971 --> 00:52:54,590
same way that the Greeks considered them
pawns of the themselves,

964
00:52:54,591 --> 00:52:56,240
pawns of the Greek gods.

965
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,330
And so that's a hell of a thing to
realize.

966
00:52:59,331 --> 00:53:01,010
You know,
and it's one of the remarkable things

967
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:04,880
about depth psychology because the
depths psychologists tell you flat out

968
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:10,610
you are a house of many spirits and one
of them is you.

969
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:15,200
And if you think that you are the most
powerful spirit in your house of

970
00:53:15,201 --> 00:53:17,690
spirits,
all that means is that you're hyper

971
00:53:17,691 --> 00:53:20,480
protected and diluted because you're
not.

972
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:25,920
There are things that are deep inside
you and you can think of them as systems

973
00:53:25,921 --> 00:53:28,660
if you want,
which also manifest themselves in,

974
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:33,210
in psychological phenomena that have
more power than you do.

975
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:36,690
It's like try not to make a fool of
yourself when you're,

976
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:39,300
you know,
hopelessly in love with someone you

977
00:53:39,301 --> 00:53:41,970
don't even know.
It's like good luck to that cause you

978
00:53:41,971 --> 00:53:45,240
won't manage it.
And that's because the instinct that

979
00:53:45,241 --> 00:53:50,241
grips you when you're overwhelmingly
attracted to someone is more powerful

980
00:53:50,881 --> 00:53:53,610
than you are and you do what it wants.

981
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:55,290
Even though you might want to fight
back,

982
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:59,520
you do what it wants and their reasons
for that.

983
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:02,490
You know some of them you can think of
them as instinctual reasons.

984
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:05,040
See if you know,
if you're not overwhelmingly attracted

985
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:07,710
to someone,
at least throughout most of the history

986
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:10,660
of mankind,
the probability was pretty low that you

987
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:13,170
going to initiate any sort of sexual
contact with them.

988
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,110
So when see it,
since that's necessary for the human

989
00:54:16,111 --> 00:54:20,010
race to propagate,
it serves biological purposes to have

990
00:54:20,011 --> 00:54:25,011
you play the role of actor of the
demands of the instinct of reproduction,

991
00:54:25,951 --> 00:54:27,840
which is of course also Freud's main
claim,

992
00:54:27,841 --> 00:54:28,710
right?
Because Freud,

993
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:34,550
who I place after his fundamental claim
was that the god that reels humanity is,

994
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:36,640
is air oss,
is set,

995
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,030
sexuality,
you know,

996
00:54:38,031 --> 00:54:39,920
and I'm always,
he also,

997
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,230
he'll introduced an idea called the
death instinct later.

998
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:45,570
Freud was also concerned about
aggression.

999
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:47,640
But you know,
in some sense you could say that Freud

1000
00:54:47,641 --> 00:54:52,080
believed that we were ruled by two gods,
the god of the goddess of sex,

1001
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:53,820
we'll say,
and the god of war.

1002
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:55,741
And you know,
as,

1003
00:54:55,741 --> 00:54:58,950
as far as reductive theories go,
yeah.

1004
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,740
Beats most of the claims of postmodern
scholars.

1005
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:03,900
So,
all right,

1006
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:05,550
so that's all pretty fun.
You know,

1007
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:07,410
Freud,
Freud's really,

1008
00:55:07,411 --> 00:55:10,560
uh,
in some sense he's in 19th century

1009
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:13,980
atheistic thinker.
He's kind of like Dawkins and the other,

1010
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,870
you know,
modern atheist in that ways.

1011
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:18,510
Um,
in some sense a strict darwinist

1012
00:55:18,511 --> 00:55:22,110
antibiological reductionist and,
but Freud had some very interesting

1013
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:24,000
things to say.
And one of them I really like,

1014
00:55:24,001 --> 00:55:26,250
I mean,
I think Freud had it absolutely dead on

1015
00:55:26,251 --> 00:55:27,084
here.
It's like,

1016
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:29,310
one of the things I've noticed in my
clinical practice,

1017
00:55:29,311 --> 00:55:31,020
because I'm a,
I'm a clinical psychologist,

1018
00:55:31,021 --> 00:55:36,021
is that I never have clients whose
parents made them too independent.

1019
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:39,270
I always have the reverse.
Not,

1020
00:55:39,271 --> 00:55:41,340
not that all my clients have this
particular problem,

1021
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:44,340
but the fundamental problem is they
cannot get away from their family.

1022
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:47,790
They've been infant dialyzed or more
accurately,

1023
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:53,450
their families have conspired to have
them remain in an infant dialyzed state.

1024
00:55:55,770 --> 00:56:00,240
And so their world is the family.
They can't get out of the world of the

1025
00:56:00,241 --> 00:56:02,400
family.
And so in some sense that's still

1026
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:04,590
childhood or adolescence because they're
not dealing with the,

1027
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:06,990
you know,
the concern to the broader world.

1028
00:56:06,991 --> 00:56:11,991
And so that's the analysis of that was
done by Freud most particularly in his

1029
00:56:12,421 --> 00:56:14,820
conceptualization of the oedipal
complex.

1030
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:18,420
Now Freud concretize that in a variety
of ways that I don't think were

1031
00:56:18,421 --> 00:56:21,090
particularly helpful,
but he had his finger on the right

1032
00:56:21,091 --> 00:56:22,380
button.
You know,

1033
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:25,210
human are unbelievably dependent when
they're born.

1034
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:30,880
So a mammal of our size should have a
gestation period of two years,

1035
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:31,720
you know,
if,

1036
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:36,190
if we were comparable to other mammals
of approximately our size being pregnant

1037
00:56:36,191 --> 00:56:38,110
for two years,
that does not sound like fun.

1038
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:39,640
But you know,
if you,

1039
00:56:39,641 --> 00:56:41,140
if you look at animals,
say like,

1040
00:56:41,141 --> 00:56:41,860
like,
uh,

1041
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:45,040
like a deer or moose or animals like
that,

1042
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:48,400
pretty much as soon as they're born they
can get up and walk.

1043
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:51,280
Whereas a human being,
it's like 15 months,

1044
00:56:51,281 --> 00:56:52,450
right?
It's calling around like,

1045
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,793
you know,
little

1046
00:56:56,150 --> 00:57:01,000
helpless little thing.
I can't even stand up for 15 months.

1047
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:04,540
Well that's because it's born in some
sense in fetal form.

1048
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:08,590
And so that makes it incredibly deep.
It's kind of like a baby kangaroo except

1049
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,500
it's more developed in that,
um,

1050
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:13,990
it makes it incredibly dependent in a
way that no other animal is.

1051
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,480
And then of course it takes you,
well let's see,

1052
00:57:16,481 --> 00:57:19,300
about 40%,
50% of people your age live in their

1053
00:57:19,301 --> 00:57:20,740
parents' houses,
you know,

1054
00:57:20,741 --> 00:57:23,650
so you're 20 or 21 or 19 or whatever you
are.

1055
00:57:23,651 --> 00:57:25,030
It's like,
you know,

1056
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:26,860
you're still dependent fundamentally.

1057
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:32,080
And so it's not that easy to break a
dependence habit of 19 years.

1058
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:35,170
And you know,
your parents may foster your

1059
00:57:35,171 --> 00:57:39,010
independence and chase you the hell out
of the house if they can try to make you

1060
00:57:39,011 --> 00:57:44,011
into a functional try to help you become
a functional and independent adult.

1061
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:47,620
But maybe not too.
And it's the,

1062
00:57:47,621 --> 00:57:50,230
maybe not,
that's the big problem because it's

1063
00:57:50,231 --> 00:57:52,720
actually rather frightening to develop
independence.

1064
00:57:52,721 --> 00:57:55,630
Even though you get to be independent,
which is supposed to be the payoff.

1065
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,780
And it's easy for that process to be
interfered with.

1066
00:57:58,781 --> 00:58:02,380
And one of the things that can really
interfere with it as maternal anxiety.

1067
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,080
Now paternal anxiety can interfere with
it too,

1068
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:08,770
but fathers tend to be substantially
less anxious than mothers.

1069
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:12,100
And so the classic Eda pulled mother is
anxious.

1070
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:15,580
And so every time the child tries to do
something that's independent,

1071
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:17,440
her anxiety gets in the way.
Oh,

1072
00:58:17,441 --> 00:58:19,300
you better be careful if you're going to
do that.

1073
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:22,120
It's like you hear that 5,000 times,
man,

1074
00:58:22,121 --> 00:58:23,740
you're not going to be able to take a
step without,

1075
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:28,780
you know,
without manifesting the anxiety that

1076
00:58:28,781 --> 00:58:33,160
you've been taught by a powerful
external force.

1077
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:35,530
That's the oedipal complex in a
nutshell,

1078
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:38,050
fundamentally.
So that's a great thing to,

1079
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,940
to figure out.
And we'll look,

1080
00:58:39,941 --> 00:58:41,980
I think we're going to look at a movie
called Crumb,

1081
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:43,023
which was,
um,

1082
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:48,260
it's about this
underground cartoonist named our crump.

1083
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:49,503
And uh,

1084
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:54,340
it has some very interesting things to
say about the oedipal complex.

1085
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,800
So,
all right,

1086
00:58:56,801 --> 00:59:00,330
so
humanism,

1087
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,720
existentialism and phenomenology,
narcotic clump together,

1088
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:09,480
brilliant theorists.
I think a lot of this came out in the

1089
00:59:09,481 --> 00:59:11,610
1950s.
You went it was,

1090
00:59:11,611 --> 00:59:13,260
well,
you could think about it in some sense

1091
00:59:13,261 --> 00:59:15,690
as the precursor deposit of psychology.
Except that,

1092
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:17,393
huh?

1093
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:23,120
Except that positive psychology has no
either in psychology or philosophy.

1094
00:59:23,121 --> 00:59:27,080
Whereas existentialism has good
grounding in both and it's not naive.

1095
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,590
You know,
the existentialists believed that,

1096
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,930
well,
the a clump them together for the

1097
00:59:32,931 --> 00:59:36,440
purpose of this brief exposition.
The first thing that this group of

1098
00:59:36,441 --> 00:59:40,490
thinkers asks you to consider,
this is a hard thing to do,

1099
00:59:40,491 --> 00:59:43,580
but if you can do it,
it's really worthwhile is forget about

1100
00:59:43,581 --> 00:59:47,510
your normal conceptions,
your formal conceptions of what

1101
00:59:47,511 --> 00:59:50,570
constitutes reality and play this game
in stat.

1102
00:59:50,571 --> 00:59:52,100
It's like it's,
it's an axiom shift.

1103
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:56,880
Instead of thinking that reality is the
objective world and you're like a

1104
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,340
superfluous subjective observer,
a transient subjective observer.

1105
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:05,090
Imagine that what reality is is what you
experience.

1106
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:09,080
That's it.
So everything you experience is equally

1107
01:00:09,081 --> 01:00:11,660
real.
Although there are different categories

1108
01:00:11,661 --> 01:00:12,470
of real,
right?

1109
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:15,320
I mean,
a dream is not in the same category as

1110
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,830
the chair that you're sitting on,
but from the phenomenological point of

1111
01:00:18,831 --> 01:00:21,880
view,
a dream and an emotion is just as real a

1112
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:25,160
phenomena as the chair is real.
Okay?

1113
01:00:25,161 --> 01:00:26,950
So that's the first accidents.
It's,

1114
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,280
it's,
it's the game is sort of what,

1115
01:00:28,281 --> 01:00:30,080
what if we,
what if we make that assumption?

1116
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:33,770
So you make that assumption.
The next issue is

1117
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,480
what are the essential qualities of what
you experience?

1118
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:48,550
And that can be addressed in a variety
of ways.

1119
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:52,120
One of the most important things that
the existentialists are concerned about

1120
01:00:52,121 --> 01:00:56,590
is fundamental anxiety.
So the this group of thinkers would say,

1121
01:00:56,591 --> 01:00:57,910
well,
you're,

1122
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:01,360
you have you,
you exist within this domain of

1123
01:01:01,361 --> 01:01:04,090
experience.
And one of the phenomena that's most

1124
01:01:04,091 --> 01:01:08,110
manifest within that domain is the
feeling of anxiety or dread.

1125
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:13,000
That's a Kierkegaardian idea.
It's that as at in an experience

1126
01:01:13,001 --> 01:01:16,720
constituted like yours,
which is somewhat fragile,

1127
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:20,050
which knows its limits,
it's localized in time and space,

1128
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:25,650
the fundamental,
the fundamental negative meaning in some

1129
01:01:28,591 --> 01:01:30,510
senses,
anxiety and dread.

1130
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:33,450
And then the question is,
given that that's the fundamental

1131
01:01:33,451 --> 01:01:35,040
reality,
what do you do about it?

1132
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:38,550
And so the existentialist id and sense
is

1133
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:47,010
observe your existence.
Find those elements of being that

1134
01:01:47,011 --> 01:01:52,011
support you and pursue them.
And that will counterbalance the primary

1135
01:01:53,671 --> 01:01:58,671
feeling of dread and alienation and
anxiety and allow you to exist in a

1136
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:03,330
manner that makes existence at least
bearable.

1137
01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:07,020
So if you look at the Floridians,
for example,

1138
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:10,500
Verdean sorta think that if there's
something wrong with you,

1139
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:12,800
there's a reason.
So if,

1140
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:15,270
if you were just a normal person,
you'd be okay.

1141
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:17,760
And since you're not a normal person,
something went wrong.

1142
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:20,430
Where's the existentialists take the
opposite idea?

1143
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,510
They say,
look,

1144
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:24,960
you're screwed from day one.
That's just how it is.

1145
01:02:24,961 --> 01:02:26,070
Because like,
look at you.

1146
01:02:26,071 --> 01:02:27,390
You're,
you're flawed,

1147
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:30,630
are finite and there's a thousand
things,

1148
01:02:30,631 --> 01:02:32,340
a million things that you don't know
and,

1149
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,970
and all sorts of things that are
conspiring to do you in.

1150
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:40,650
It's like with a problem like that,
you don't need more problems to be

1151
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,410
unstable.
You're just unstable to begin with.

1152
01:02:43,770 --> 01:02:48,770
So they think conceive of negative
emotion related pathology as an integral

1153
01:02:50,341 --> 01:02:52,350
part of being and then the question is,
okay,

1154
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:55,170
given that it's like the Buddhist idea
that life is suffering.

1155
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:58,800
It's the same idea.
It's like don't be wondering why your

1156
01:02:58,801 --> 01:03:01,470
pathological,
it's so obvious why your pathological,

1157
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:06,920
how could you help but be pathological?
The question is given that what should

1158
01:03:07,711 --> 01:03:10,740
you do about it or even is there
anything you can do about it and that's

1159
01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:16,470
the question that we'll try to unfold in
this section of the course.

1160
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:23,100
Now the other thing that's really
interesting about this group of thinkers

1161
01:03:23,101 --> 01:03:26,460
I think is that especially the later
ones like,

1162
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:28,950
well,
I include Solzhenitsyn has a personality

1163
01:03:28,951 --> 01:03:31,530
theorist for for reasons that I won't
talk to you about now.

1164
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:35,010
Solzhenitsyn was a Russian author and he
wrote a book called the Gulag

1165
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:37,380
Archipelago,
which was published in the 1970s and it

1166
01:03:37,381 --> 01:03:40,890
was one of the things that knocked over
the Soviet Union because it revealed for

1167
01:03:40,891 --> 01:03:44,250
the first time just how corrupt and
murderous the Soviet system was.

1168
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:45,840
Now,
the thing that's interesting about

1169
01:03:45,841 --> 01:03:49,200
Solzhenitsyn and also about frankl,
Viktor Frankl,

1170
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:52,230
who was a psychiatrist who had been put
in the Nazi death camps,

1171
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:57,500
is that they were very integrity,
concerned with the idea of the intrinsic

1172
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:01,110
meaning,
fullness and meaninglessness of human

1173
01:04:01,111 --> 01:04:02,160
life.
One thing.

1174
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:03,480
So that's the person,
that element.

1175
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,610
But the second thing they were concerned
about,

1176
01:04:05,611 --> 01:04:10,611
and this sort of made them logical
followers of Nietzsche,

1177
01:04:10,861 --> 01:04:15,861
was what effect is your decision about
the meaning of your life have on the

1178
01:04:16,111 --> 01:04:17,520
broader social community?

1179
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:21,540
So let's say that your nihilistic or
you're a totalitarian.

1180
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:25,140
So what does that mean?
Like you're not an isolated unit.

1181
01:04:25,141 --> 01:04:26,820
You're interacting with people all the
time.

1182
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:28,890
You have a tremendous network of
connections.

1183
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,240
You know,
you can think of it this way.

1184
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:34,170
You know a thousand people,
each of those thousand people knows a

1185
01:04:34,171 --> 01:04:36,240
thousand people.
That means you're one person from

1186
01:04:36,241 --> 01:04:40,560
1,000,002 from a billion.
So instead of being some little

1187
01:04:40,561 --> 01:04:44,550
localized.in an random array of dots,
7 billion of them,

1188
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:47,130
you're the center of a connected
network.

1189
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,850
And so if there's something that's gone
astray with your psychic functioning,

1190
01:04:50,851 --> 01:04:54,510
your psychological functioning,
what exactly does that do to the broader

1191
01:04:54,511 --> 01:04:58,170
social community and soldier Nixon's
idea and Frankel's as well?

1192
01:04:58,171 --> 01:04:59,750
It's quite straight forward.
It's the two.

1193
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:03,300
The reason that societies become
pathological,

1194
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:07,890
deeply murderously pathological is
because individuals within this society

1195
01:05:07,891 --> 01:05:10,800
have become deeply and murderously
pathological.

1196
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:15,150
So instead of society in which is
something that the Marxists would think,

1197
01:05:15,151 --> 01:05:17,890
for example,
you know that you're the of social

1198
01:05:17,891 --> 01:05:20,080
forces,
the existentialists would say,

1199
01:05:20,270 --> 01:05:22,210
ah,
don't be so sure about that.

1200
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,870
It's the quality of the individual
decisions that you make on a personal

1201
01:05:25,871 --> 01:05:28,840
level,
day to day that spread out into the

1202
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:31,660
broader community and either improve it
or pathologize it.

1203
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:35,200
And so I'm gonna have you read both
frank align solution medicine because I

1204
01:05:35,201 --> 01:05:39,430
think they make viciously powerful
arguments that that is in fact the case.

1205
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:43,840
And it's actually quite a useful,
it's a funny thing because often this is

1206
01:05:43,841 --> 01:05:46,330
sort of associated with the idea of
facing dragons.

1207
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:50,740
Often you learn the things that are most
vital to your being by considering the

1208
01:05:50,741 --> 01:05:53,560
worst possible phenomena.
So I might say,

1209
01:05:53,561 --> 01:05:54,940
well,
just think about this.

1210
01:05:54,941 --> 01:05:59,530
It's like the idea that frankl and
Solzhenitsyn and others by the way have

1211
01:05:59,531 --> 01:06:03,520
been propagating is that whatever
decisions you make that are moral on a

1212
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:07,390
day to day basis aren't isolated to you.
They spread out into the community very

1213
01:06:07,391 --> 01:06:12,391
rapidly and so the fate of the community
is dependent in some sense on your

1214
01:06:13,181 --> 01:06:14,320
personal morality.

1215
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:17,260
So then,
well that's a terrible thing.

1216
01:06:17,261 --> 01:06:20,650
I mean it's a terrible weight,
but it certainly provides an answer to,

1217
01:06:20,651 --> 01:06:23,500
well,
why should I do what I do?

1218
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:25,030
It's like,
do good things,

1219
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:26,410
great.
They propagate,

1220
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:28,480
do bad things,
fine.

1221
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:31,900
They propagate to,
and one of the really interesting things

1222
01:06:31,901 --> 01:06:34,960
about the existentialist is they took a
look at what happened in the 20th

1223
01:06:34,961 --> 01:06:39,310
century with its ungodly murderous
political systems and said,

1224
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:42,460
all right,
just exactly what responsibility does

1225
01:06:42,461 --> 01:06:45,880
the individual bear for bringing those
conditions about?

1226
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,270
It's like it's a question.
Well,

1227
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:52,270
we're thinking about and it certainly
hasn't lost its relevance.

1228
01:06:52,271 --> 01:06:53,230
In fact,
I think it's,

1229
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:54,940
well,
it's as relevant as ever,

1230
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:56,560
so that's great.
That's,

1231
01:06:56,590 --> 01:06:58,390
that's really an interesting thing to
do.

1232
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:02,440
Then we move into the fields that are
more strictly scientific,

1233
01:07:02,441 --> 01:07:06,460
but a lot of what we've covered in the
beginning of the class provides the

1234
01:07:06,461 --> 01:07:10,210
platform for that.
I'm going to tell you about the

1235
01:07:10,211 --> 01:07:15,211
structure and function of the basic
biological systems that underlie your

1236
01:07:16,331 --> 01:07:19,390
motivations and your emotions.
And roughly speaking,

1237
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:23,920
we're going to say that a motivational
system sets a goal for you.

1238
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:26,020
So if you're hungry,
you're goal is to eat.

1239
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:29,800
Obviously if you're thirsty,
you're goal is to consume some liquid

1240
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:33,640
goal setting systems,
and there's a system for each of those.

1241
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:39,100
We'll call them drives.
Even though that's we'll call the

1242
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:42,460
motivational systems because they're not
really drives where his emotions are,

1243
01:07:42,461 --> 01:07:47,320
things that are more likely to manifest
themselves as markers for your position

1244
01:07:47,321 --> 01:07:49,240
on the way to the goal.
So for example,

1245
01:07:49,450 --> 01:07:53,140
if you have a goal in mind and you're
progressing towards it without any

1246
01:07:53,141 --> 01:07:55,060
obstacles,
you're going to feel positive emotions.

1247
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:58,270
And if you have a goal in mind and
you're progressing towards it and you

1248
01:07:58,271 --> 01:08:01,270
encounter obstacles,
then you're going to experience negative

1249
01:08:01,271 --> 01:08:04,150
emotions.
And what I want to do is outline what I

1250
01:08:04,151 --> 01:08:09,151
think is the best relatively current
neuroscience on the structure and

1251
01:08:09,581 --> 01:08:13,180
function of those systems.
And what we'll see is that there's a

1252
01:08:13,181 --> 01:08:17,630
nice analog,
the peer Jedi and story about how the

1253
01:08:17,631 --> 01:08:20,570
psyche develops and the way the brain is
organized.

1254
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:25,810
And there's a nice analog between the
theories of psychological symbolism that

1255
01:08:26,901 --> 01:08:31,901
were pursued by the depths psychologists
and the relationship between the brain

1256
01:08:33,111 --> 01:08:38,111
areas that subsume your sense of
individuality and the underlying

1257
01:08:39,561 --> 01:08:44,450
motivational and emotional systems that
guide and drive and constrained and

1258
01:08:44,451 --> 01:08:45,770
allow your behavior.

1259
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:47,253
So,

1260
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:53,410
so that'll put some biology underneath
the theorizing and I think that's a

1261
01:08:53,411 --> 01:08:55,450
really,
that's also a very fun thing to have

1262
01:08:55,451 --> 01:08:58,090
happen.
Then after that we're going to talk

1263
01:08:58,091 --> 01:09:03,091
about five factor trait theory and fight
the five factor trait theory is the most

1264
01:09:03,761 --> 01:09:08,761
modern formulation of psychometric
theory and psychometric theory is the

1265
01:09:09,421 --> 01:09:14,421
statistical reduction of dis data sets
that describe human personality.

1266
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:19,300
It's,
it's the,

1267
01:09:19,330 --> 01:09:21,850
so if I,
if I took an infinite bank of questions

1268
01:09:21,851 --> 01:09:25,810
that I could ask you about your
personality and then I subjected them to

1269
01:09:25,811 --> 01:09:29,680
the proper kind of statistical analysis,
I could group those questions into

1270
01:09:29,681 --> 01:09:32,980
coherent groups.
And what I would discover is that your

1271
01:09:32,981 --> 01:09:36,370
personality has something resembling a
five factor structure,

1272
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,530
five dimensions.
It's a lot of dimensions.

1273
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:41,200
The world has four dimensions,
right?

1274
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:45,010
Your personality has five,
so that's plenty complicated and we're

1275
01:09:45,011 --> 01:09:47,650
going to walk through what those
dimensions are,

1276
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:52,000
what the variability represents,
how they might be related to the

1277
01:09:52,001 --> 01:09:55,330
motivational systems and the thought
patterns that we discovered earlier.

1278
01:09:55,510 --> 01:10:00,010
And then all the practical consequences
of knowing about those systems.

1279
01:10:00,011 --> 01:10:02,590
And we actually,
the model I'm going to present you with

1280
01:10:02,591 --> 01:10:06,040
this tiered,
so the top level is stability and

1281
01:10:06,041 --> 01:10:09,070
plasticity.
The next tier is the standard five

1282
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:12,220
factor model,
extroversion and openness that makes up

1283
01:10:12,221 --> 01:10:14,350
plasticity,
agreeableness,

1284
01:10:14,470 --> 01:10:16,480
conscientiousness,
and

1285
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:20,300
what's the other one there?

1286
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:23,000
What's that?
No,

1287
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:23,670
no.
Yes.

1288
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:24,600
Neuroticism.
I'm sorry.

1289
01:10:24,601 --> 01:10:26,280
Emotional stability reversed.
Yeah.

1290
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:28,200
So,
and then underneath that,

1291
01:10:28,201 --> 01:10:31,770
each of those breaks into two.
And so I want to describe to you the

1292
01:10:31,771 --> 01:10:36,771
most current research on what each of
those hierarchical tiers mean and why

1293
01:10:37,831 --> 01:10:40,200
you want to know that.
And at the same time I'm going to have

1294
01:10:40,201 --> 01:10:45,201
you do a personality analysis online.
So what it will do is help you identify

1295
01:10:45,331 --> 01:10:49,740
your personality virtues using a big
five model and your personality faults

1296
01:10:49,741 --> 01:10:52,650
also using a big five months.
So that'll give you some insight into

1297
01:10:52,651 --> 01:10:56,910
who you are and what the Hell's wrong
with you and also what's good about you

1298
01:10:57,180 --> 01:11:01,830
at the same time that we're trying to
elaborate these dimensions on a,

1299
01:11:01,831 --> 01:11:06,831
at a conceptual level.
So that's in a nutshell the course

1300
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:15,120
I want the readings and the order in
which you have to do them are listed on

1301
01:11:15,121 --> 01:11:15,600
the website.

1302
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,000
So I'm not going to go through them.
It should be relatively self

1303
01:11:18,001 --> 01:11:21,030
explanatory.
I want you to read Chapter 15 of the

1304
01:11:21,031 --> 01:11:23,640
Black Swan.
And the reason I want you to read that

1305
01:11:23,641 --> 01:11:28,641
is because it questions the validity of
the standard normal distribution model

1306
01:11:29,071 --> 01:11:33,420
that psychometrics is predicated on and
wilcock a lot more about that later.

1307
01:11:33,421 --> 01:11:36,930
But I think you need to know it because
you're going to learn in psychology that

1308
01:11:36,931 --> 01:11:41,040
most things are normally distributed.
And all of the statistics that you'll

1309
01:11:41,041 --> 01:11:44,400
use in psychology are predicated on the
idea that they're normal distribution

1310
01:11:44,401 --> 01:11:46,920
holds.
But there's lots of situations in which

1311
01:11:46,921 --> 01:11:49,410
it doesn't hold and they're important.
So for example,

1312
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:52,440
money is not normally distributed,
right?

1313
01:11:52,530 --> 01:11:55,980
1% of the population has 50% of the
money.

1314
01:11:55,981 --> 01:12:00,150
And then if you take that 1% and you
take the top 1% of that,

1315
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:03,480
then they have 50% of all the money that
the top 1% has.

1316
01:12:03,690 --> 01:12:06,990
And lots of phenomena like that.
Artistic productivity is like that.

1317
01:12:07,170 --> 01:12:10,170
Anything that people create productively
is like that.

1318
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:12,900
So,
okay,

1319
01:12:12,990 --> 01:12:16,430
exams,
you can look this up on the website.

1320
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,690
Here's what you have to do.
There are three exams,

1321
01:12:18,691 --> 01:12:23,691
they're not cumulative.
There's one 15% essay of 750 words and

1322
01:12:23,911 --> 01:12:27,270
the online exercise and it's pass fail
because you know,

1323
01:12:27,271 --> 01:12:30,330
I don't know how I'm going to grade you
for your virtues of your faults.

1324
01:12:30,331 --> 01:12:31,440
You know,
that's your problem,

1325
01:12:31,441 --> 01:12:33,210
but you,
you know,

1326
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:36,720
so all we'll do is check to see that
you've actually gone through the

1327
01:12:36,721 --> 01:12:39,570
exercise and half intelligible manner.
So,

1328
01:12:41,180 --> 01:12:44,400
alright,
now I want to start with

1329
01:12:50,050 --> 01:12:51,730
that so you can write it down if you
didn't.

1330
01:12:51,731 --> 01:12:53,560
But here's a couple of things I want to
tell you.

1331
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:57,640
Um,
I have some insight into my own

1332
01:12:57,641 --> 01:13:00,070
personality.
I'm very industrious,

1333
01:13:00,071 --> 01:13:02,890
I'm not very orderly and a very high in
openness.

1334
01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:07,030
And so I'm telling you that because
there are some things you should

1335
01:13:07,031 --> 01:13:10,510
consider if you want to take this course
and you should really consider them

1336
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,640
because not every course is for
everyone.

1337
01:13:13,570 --> 01:13:18,280
If you're unbelievably organized person,
this is not the course for you.

1338
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:22,150
Okay?
Because there's a contradiction between

1339
01:13:22,151 --> 01:13:26,270
openness and orderliness.
And the thing about orderliness is that

1340
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:30,100
orderliness puts everything into boxes
and the boxes are tight and the

1341
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:33,280
dichotomies are black and white.
And I'm not criticizing that.

1342
01:13:33,281 --> 01:13:36,130
There's great utility in orderliness,
but orderliness,

1343
01:13:36,131 --> 01:13:40,390
fights with openness.
And I like to break boxes apart.

1344
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:44,380
And so if you're the sort of person who
is orderly,

1345
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:45,730
we're like really orderly.

1346
01:13:46,210 --> 01:13:47,680
You'll know this.
How clean is your room,

1347
01:13:47,681 --> 01:13:50,080
like is have you alphabetized your soup
cans?

1348
01:13:50,081 --> 01:13:52,900
If you have,
then this is not the course for you,

1349
01:13:54,150 --> 01:13:57,310
you to to take this course.
There's two things that have to

1350
01:13:57,311 --> 01:14:00,730
characterize you.
One is you have to be willing to read.

1351
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:02,860
Okay.
The reading load is quite,

1352
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:07,090
I don't think it's overwhelmingly heavy,
but the material is quite difficult and

1353
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:09,130
there is a,
there is plenty of it.

1354
01:14:09,730 --> 01:14:13,000
So if you,
if that interest you like don't take the

1355
01:14:13,001 --> 01:14:15,160
course.
And the second thing is,

1356
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:17,740
you know,
if you're the sort of person who

1357
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:21,250
spontaneously talks about ideas with
your friends,

1358
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:24,850
you know when you find conversations
about things that aren't related to

1359
01:14:24,851 --> 01:14:26,950
ideas,
somewhat tedious,

1360
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:30,070
then this is the course for you because
it's,

1361
01:14:30,071 --> 01:14:34,750
it's really because I'm an open person.
I can't help but make my course.

1362
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:38,470
I can't help but created in that image.

1363
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:42,340
I'm really interested in ideas.
Like I tried to tell you why it's

1364
01:14:42,341 --> 01:14:45,580
necessary to know them because an idea
is an interesting to me,

1365
01:14:45,581 --> 01:14:50,410
unless it has utility for you.
But we're going to go all over,

1366
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:51,790
and if,
if,

1367
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:56,770
if you want a road that's defined and
like a single track towards a goal that

1368
01:14:56,771 --> 01:14:59,290
isn't this road,
this road is going like this.

1369
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:00,670
Like you just heard,
you know,

1370
01:15:00,671 --> 01:15:02,500
you just had a lecture,
so you know what they're going to be

1371
01:15:02,501 --> 01:15:05,980
like.
So you're welcome to be here.

1372
01:15:05,981 --> 01:15:08,440
I'm thrilled to be able to teach you
this material,

1373
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:13,800
but don't say I didn't warn you.
All right,

1374
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:17,380
well that's that.
So we'll see you Thursday.

1375
01:15:18,130 --> 01:15:18,520
Bye.
