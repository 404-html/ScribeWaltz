1
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:08,690
Hello everyone.
Great.

2
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,200
You can see me.
Daniel says loud and clear,

3
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:16,723
so excellent.

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,313
Okay.

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,130
Okay,
well thanks guys for tuning in and,

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,173
and uh,
again for offering support for the 

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,100
continued operation of my youtube 
channel.

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:30,563
So,
um,

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,200
let's get going.
Um,

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,870
it's good to see all of you and so I've 
got a set of questions here.

11
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,040
I'm,
I can see the,

12
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,340
the live stream as well,
the live chat,

13
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,540
so that's great.

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:49,043
Hm.

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,500
All right,
let's try this one.

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,633
What's an effective way to figure out 
how to match your career with your 

17
00:00:57,781 --> 00:01:00,510
temperament?
How can you determine if a job is a good

18
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:03,300
fit or a terrible mistake?
Let's start with the first one.

19
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,650
What's a good way of,

20
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,503
oh,

21
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,163
what's an effective way to figure out 
how to match your career with your 

22
00:01:15,671 --> 00:01:17,410
temperament?
Well,

23
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:18,813
the first thing you do,
obviously you have to do is to 

24
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,870
understand your temperament to some 
degree.

25
00:01:22,871 --> 00:01:25,180
And so the best way to deal with that is
to,

26
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,120
uh,
get yourself assessed using a good,

27
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:30,220
big five instrument.
There's many of them online.

28
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,413
We're going to be setting up a website 
within the next month that will enable 

29
00:01:33,671 --> 00:01:38,671
people to do use a tool that a student 
of mine,

30
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:40,534
Colin de Young,
who's now a professor at the University 

31
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:45,730
of Minnesota and I and some other 
coauthors developed back in,

32
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:50,020
I think it was 2007 called the big five 
aspects scale and it breaks the big five

33
00:01:50,021 --> 00:01:53,380
down into 10 aspects and we'll have a 
version of that online,

34
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,363
I hope by the end of July.
That's the plan that will enable people 

35
00:01:56,501 --> 00:02:01,501
to get a read of their temperament that 
will tell them how extroverted they are,

36
00:02:02,771 --> 00:02:05,440
how high they are,
a negative emotion or neuroticism,

37
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,720
how agreeable,
how conscientious in how open.

38
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,590
But it will break each of those traits 
down into two aspects.

39
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:15,160
So extroversion breaks into enthusiasm 
and assertiveness.

40
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,940
Neuroticism breaks into withdrawal and 
volatility.

41
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,000
Agreeableness breaks down into 
politeness and compassion,

42
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,163
conscientiousness into orderliness and 
industrious and openness into openness 

43
00:02:26,441 --> 00:02:27,274
proper,
which is something like creativity and 

44
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:29,104
interest in ideas.
And so the first thing you have to know 

45
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:32,434
is what your temperament is.
The second thing you should probably 

46
00:02:34,661 --> 00:02:35,494
know,
and we'll probably add this 

47
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:38,290
functionality to the system at at some 
point,

48
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,870
is what your intelligence level is,
what your acu is.

49
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,840
Because the,
the higher your Iq,

50
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:49,140
the better suited you are for jobs.
Who's demands change rapidly and most.

51
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,713
So those are complex jobs and simple 
jobs are the jobs where you can learn 

52
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:56,380
something and then you can run it as an 
algorithm.

53
00:02:56,381 --> 00:02:58,120
You can just repeat it over and over.
And those,

54
00:02:58,121 --> 00:03:00,310
those jobs of course becoming more and 
more scarce.

55
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,410
So you need to know what your 
temperament is and then you need to know

56
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:08,350
the temperamental demands of the job.
Now,

57
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:09,184
most jobs are,
are mastered with a combination of 

58
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:17,611
intelligence and conscientiousness.
But the other temperamental factors play

59
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:20,680
a moderating role.
So for example,

60
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,053
um,
extroverted people tend to be 

61
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,770
entertainer types and highly social.
And so if you're interested,

62
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:31,030
for example,
if you're extroverted,

63
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:31,864
then a career in sales is something that
you might consider a career that 

64
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:37,210
involves a lot of public communication 
and interaction with groups.

65
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:38,680
Whereas you're an introvert,
you're going to work,

66
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,390
you're going to want to work a lot more.
Um,

67
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,570
you're going to be suited to work on s 
in a solitary manner a lot more.

68
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:47,943
If you're agreeable,
you're going to be suited for taking 

69
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:52,000
care of people.
If you're disagreeable,

70
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,360
then you're a tough bargainer and a hard
negotiator.

71
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,570
And,
and Ah,

72
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,780
litigators,
for example,

73
00:03:58,781 --> 00:04:00,080
lawyers are,
are,

74
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:01,930
uh,
often low in agreeableness.

75
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,380
So if you're conscientious,
well,

76
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:06,214
that tends to be a very good trait for 
any kind of managerial and 

77
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:10,150
administrative job.
And for,

78
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,580
for,
for simpler jobs as well.

79
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,443
Uh,
it's a great predictor of military 

80
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:15,550
prowess.
For example.

81
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,940
Um,
if you're high in openness,

82
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:19,774
then you're going to want a creative 
career and that might make you an 

83
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:25,360
entrepreneur or musician or an artist of
that or something like that.

84
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,890
Um,
that's often very,

85
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,780
very difficult to monetize.
But,

86
00:04:28,781 --> 00:04:29,614
um,
one of the funny things about openness 

87
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:31,804
is that if you're high in openness,
it's not that helpful at the bottom of 

88
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,103
hierarchies because you're basically 
expected at the bottom of most 

89
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:40,360
hierarchies to act more or less like a 
functionary.

90
00:04:40,361 --> 00:04:43,600
But it becomes of critical importance at
the top of hierarchy.

91
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:44,434
So it's a personality trait whose 
utility can really kick in in the later 

92
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:48,304
stages of your career because in really 
complex positions where things are 

93
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:54,700
changing dynamically,
you need to have a high intelligence and

94
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:56,560
you also need to be creative.

95
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,850
So how can you determine if a job is a 
good fit or a terrible mistake?

96
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,350
Ha.
Well,

97
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:03,963
I would say you can tell if it's a 
terrible mistake if you dread going and 

98
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,613
also if you're working hard and doing 
what you're supposed to and you're not 

99
00:05:11,621 --> 00:05:14,800
being rewarded for it or,
and there's no chance for advancement so

100
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,630
that,
those are good reasons to,

101
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,220
uh,
to leave.

102
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:22,060
Um,
so all right.

103
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:23,973
Truck playing says,
just wanted to tell you that you're the 

104
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:28,120
first person to actually make me read 
books.

105
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,860
I have a background in math and 
engineering,

106
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:32,020
lots of formulas and equations.
Keep up your work.

107
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,490
Well,
good work truck plane.

108
00:05:33,491 --> 00:05:36,580
There's some real utility in reading 
books and I'm glad that you found the,

109
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,740
the,
I,

110
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,990
I'm glad that you figured out why it's 
necessary to do that.

111
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,370
So that's,
that's uh,

112
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,870
that's,
I'm,

113
00:05:44,871 --> 00:05:45,704
I'm very happy to hear that all of our 
connor says it's definitely worth doing 

114
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,300
the humanities.

115
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,133
It gives you a skillset you can apply 
anywhere that's actually worth 

116
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:52,924
elaborating on a little bit because I do
believe that classical humanities 

117
00:05:56,651 --> 00:06:00,120
education is at the core of the proper 
university curriculum.

118
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,040
And you might say,
well,

119
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:04,640
what's the utility for example,
in studying philosophy and literature?

120
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:06,530
But that's not exactly the right way to 
look at it.

121
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,150
The,
the utility of humanities education,

122
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,730
at least in principle,
is that it teaches you,

123
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,100
first of all,
how to be civilized and educated so that

124
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,053
you become aware of the major cultural 
works that every educated person needs 

125
00:06:20,841 --> 00:06:21,674
to be aware of in order to operate 
properly at a high level of 

126
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:25,604
functionality in the world.
And what you'll find is that as you get 

127
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:30,290
older and you climb hierarchies of 
competence,

128
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:35,710
that broader and broader educational 
familiarity is demanded of you.

129
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,913
But more importantly,
education in the humanities is designed 

130
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:43,850
to teach you how to think and to speak 
and to formulate arguments.

131
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:44,683
And because what you're doing in complex
positions almost always involves the 

132
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,323
identification of problems and their 
articulation so that you can frame the 

133
00:06:53,181 --> 00:06:56,180
problem,
then a description of a potential set of

134
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:57,014
solutions,
and then the communication of those set 

135
00:06:58,881 --> 00:06:59,714
of solutions to a wide variety of people
in a manner that can help them obtain a 

136
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:03,854
consensus and work together,
they'll set those skills are absolutely 

137
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:09,230
crucial when you're doing anything 
that's a real difficulty.

138
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,620
And so the humanities education is 
extraordinarily important as a,

139
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,660
as a consequence of that.
Um,

140
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,300
here's a question.
Piaget's final stage of morality.

141
00:07:18,301 --> 00:07:22,130
It was he who can,
who you can create the rules.

142
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,950
Would you please provide an example of 
what that means?

143
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,181
Um,
yeah,

144
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:27,080
I can,
I can.

145
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,920
It says,
uh,

146
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,640
I'm having trouble,
I can't get the rest of it,

147
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:32,474
but can you,
can you please provide an example of 

148
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:34,880
what that means?

149
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,410
Well,
look at,

150
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,860
at a lower stage of Piaget and 
development,

151
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:42,470
let's say where you're a child and 
you've learned to play a game,

152
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,693
you're going to determine morality on 
the basis of how well you as a player 

153
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,473
adhere to the rules.
Now at the point of development above 

154
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:56,450
that,
you start to understand that well,

155
00:07:56,451 --> 00:08:00,590
the rules were actually a human creation
and in their original form.

156
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:04,280
And that what that means is that when 
it's necessary,

157
00:08:04,281 --> 00:08:07,460
the rules can be adjusted.
Think about the Harry Potter series.

158
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:08,294
I mean,
one of the things that characterizes 

159
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,950
Harry and his friends is that there and 
her mind,

160
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:16,880
he's a really good example of this is 
that they're sufficiently disciplined.

161
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:19,490
I mean,
she happens to be really disciplined and

162
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,710
are perfectly capable of following the 
rules,

163
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:25,670
but also make exceptions when that's 
necessary.

164
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,504
And it's the fact that they can step 
beyond the rules when that becomes 

165
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:29,270
necessary.

166
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,760
That actually makes them the heroes of 
the adventure.

167
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:32,983
Because it's very difficult to set up a 
situation where you can always act 

168
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:41,060
perfectly only by following the rules 
because it's very difficult to delineate

169
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:41,894
out a rule set that sufficiently 
comprehensive so it'll cover every 

170
00:08:44,181 --> 00:08:46,310
eventuality.
So that's the,

171
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,630
that's the upshot on that.
Um,

172
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,840
women have a tendency to prefer bad men 
higher in dark triad traits.

173
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,823
How come?
The Bible describes mode of being as 

174
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:58,470
associated with Nice guy traits,
which contradict that.

175
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,483
Okay,
well I take issue with both elements of 

176
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:02,574
that.
Actually,

177
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:03,443
I don't believe that women do have a 
tendency to prefer d bad men higher in 

178
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:07,314
dark triad traits.
They may have a tendency to be more 

179
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:16,110
erotically attracted to men who are 
capable of manifesting,

180
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,300
um,
dominance and aggression.

181
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:19,134
I think that the evidence for that is 
relatively clear and I don't think the 

182
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:22,884
Bible at all,
this describes a mode of being as 

183
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,340
associated with Nice guy traits.

184
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,673
Um,
I don't know that that may be how it's 

185
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:32,490
classically taught,
for example,

186
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:37,670
because Christ is often presented,
especially in more simple minded,

187
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,933
very variants.
And I'm not being pejorative about that 

188
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:42,984
precisely as the ultimate in Nice guys.
But I don't think that that's true at 

189
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:47,184
all.
That's a reasonable characterization at 

190
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:49,614
all.
If you read the Gospel accounts because 

191
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:54,330
he was someone who was certainly capable
of saying very,

192
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:59,290
very harsh things to people and was also
identified very strongly as a figure who

193
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:03,120
was capable of using judgment and 
distinguishing between what was positive

194
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:03,954
and what was negative in that capacity 
for judgment is something quite 

195
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:10,170
different than than,
than the mere nice guy,

196
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:13,260
compassion that would be associated with
high levels of trait agreeableness.

197
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,500
So I think that um,
the,

198
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,910
the idea that the ideal that's put 
forward in the biblical writings,

199
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,650
it's something like be harmless.

200
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,020
I think that's a real misreading of the 
text.

201
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:26,870
And uh,
I also think that it's,

202
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,850
it's,
it's wrong because harmless and good are

203
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:31,860
not the same thing at all.
And in fact,

204
00:10:31,861 --> 00:10:32,694
I think one of the best ways of 
characterizing like a higher order 

205
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:37,254
morality,
and this is something that needs you 

206
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,630
talked about a fair bit is that,
and,

207
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,870
and young as well with regards to the 
idea of integration of the shout,

208
00:10:43,871 --> 00:10:44,704
it was that someone whose moral has the 
capability for violence and the 

209
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:51,690
capability for aggression built in and 
add hand,

210
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:52,524
but is also someone who's perfectly 
capable of controlling that in a 

211
00:10:55,081 --> 00:10:56,940
civilized manner.
And I think that,

212
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,411
um,
you know,

213
00:10:58,411 --> 00:11:00,150
I'm speaking off the cuff here 
obviously,

214
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:02,460
but I think that the,
the,

215
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,990
the attraction that some women have for 
the,

216
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,050
for the sort of men who are more likely 
to misbehave,

217
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,160
uh,
to,

218
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,993
to act in a delinquent manner and so 
forth is partly their desire to be 

219
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:20,340
associated with men who have the 
capacity for aggression.

220
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,353
Now,
the best of all possible worlds is when 

221
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:27,150
that capacity for aggression is 
civilized and held under control.

222
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,253
But,
so I would say that one of the things 

223
00:11:30,181 --> 00:11:35,181
that men should do as they mature is 
transformed themselves into monsters,

224
00:11:35,371 --> 00:11:37,680
but also become civilized at the same 
time.

225
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,993
And that that's exactly what you see in 
stories like beauty and the beast where 

226
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,203
the,
the,

227
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,373
the,
the ideal man starts out as a beast and 

228
00:11:45,211 --> 00:11:48,180
ends up civilized.
He doesn't start out as a milk salt wimp

229
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,640
sort of character who you know,
who,

230
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,830
who poses no threat to anyone and then 
becomes the hero.

231
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,693
That isn't how it works.
Although there are stories of that kind 

232
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:58,060
of development.
So,

233
00:11:58,890 --> 00:11:59,723
um,
which is the most accessible of Carl 

234
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,050
Jung's books?
Oh,

235
00:12:03,051 --> 00:12:03,884
well,
I wouldn't say any of them are 

236
00:12:04,271 --> 00:12:05,104
particularly accessible,
although modern man in search of a soul 

237
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,310
is probably a good one to start with.

238
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,430
That's modern man in search of a,
of,

239
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,413
of a soul,
I think modern man in search of his 

240
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:16,480
soul.
Anyways,

241
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,093
it's modern man in search of a soul.
I believe it's short and it's to the 

242
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,080
point and,
and so that's a good introduction,

243
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,243
which has been the most impactful to me.
Probably I on a I o n which is the 

244
00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:29,464
second volume,
the second volume of volume nine of the 

245
00:12:33,071 --> 00:12:35,200
collected works,
which is an absolutely amazing,

246
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,890
terrifying book.
Um,

247
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,850
which describes it actually it,
it acts,

248
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,733
it,
it contains some of young's writings on 

249
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:42,844
the psychology of astrology,
which are actually quite interesting 

250
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:49,981
because he regarded astrology as a 
millennia long as millennia,

251
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:54,490
long fantasizing on the part of the 
collective human imagination.

252
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:57,100
And,
and spend a lot of time in analyzing the

253
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:59,770
content of that.
You might think about it as a dream that

254
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:01,450
was projected out into the cosmos.

255
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,673
So
what are your personal strategies for 

256
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,830
consuming the news?
Hmm.

257
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,071
Well,
you know,

258
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:09,904
it's funny.
For years I haven't watched television 

259
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:12,424
news for example,
and I don't read newspapers very often 

260
00:13:14,081 --> 00:13:16,870
either.
I tried to actually limit my exposure to

261
00:13:16,871 --> 00:13:18,280
the news.
Um,

262
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,670
I read the economist,
I used to read Harper's magazine.

263
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,020
I used to read,
um,

264
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,430
the,
uh,

265
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,410
um,
Atlantic monthly as well.

266
00:13:26,411 --> 00:13:28,290
I thought they were good periodicals all
the way.

267
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,330
Think both of them have collapsed quite 
precipitously in recent years.

268
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,790
Harper's maybe not so much.
Um,

269
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:37,840
how do I walk the line between wanting 
to be informed while avoiding the danger

270
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:39,160
of cluttering your mind?
Well,

271
00:13:39,161 --> 00:13:40,710
the economist helps with that.
Um,

272
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,650
I think it's actually gone down hill to 
some degree over recent years as well.

273
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,710
But I definitely tell my clinical 
clients very frequently,

274
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:48,544
especially if they are depressed and 
feeling overwhelmed to s to limit their 

275
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:55,780
exposure to do Daily News,
particularly because if something's only

276
00:13:55,781 --> 00:13:56,614
relevant the day that it's published,
you could make the case that it's not 

277
00:13:58,691 --> 00:13:59,524
relevant at all,
which is part of the reason why I like 

278
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:01,624
the economist because it only comes out 
every week or two weeks depending on 

279
00:14:04,271 --> 00:14:05,104
your subscription.

280
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,740
And so it can only cover things that 
have enough importance to,

281
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,680
to be relevant over a timeframe that 
exceeds a day.

282
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,560
So,
all right.

283
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:16,870
So let's see what we've got in the live 
stream here.

284
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,853
MMM.

285
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,820
How do we revive interest in the good 
mother archetype?

286
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,850
Well,
that's a good question.

287
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,833
Um,
I think it's a good question in part 

288
00:14:29,331 --> 00:14:33,680
because it isn't really obvious to me 
that young women are narrow.

289
00:14:33,681 --> 00:14:37,490
Society are told the truth about what 
their lives are likely to be like.

290
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,653
You know,
they're,

291
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,920
they're,
they're,

292
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:40,754
um,
they're taught both explicitly and 

293
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:49,451
implicitly that their primary interest 
will be in the pursuit of a dynamic.

294
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,170
And there's some real problems with 
that.

295
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:59,171
The first is that the proportion of 
people who will have a dynamic career in

296
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:01,484
the technical sense is actually quite 
low because most people have jobs and 

297
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:05,684
not careers.
And even in those jobs that might be 

298
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:12,740
regarded as careers,
much of the work that's done his job.

299
00:15:12,741 --> 00:15:13,850
Like,
I mean,

300
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,713
the reason that people pay you to have a
job is often because you're required to 

301
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,930
do things that you wouldn't do if you 
weren't being paid.

302
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,350
And so
we,

303
00:15:24,351 --> 00:15:25,250
we,
we,

304
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,143
we glamorize the role of career and 
confuse jobs with careers and assume 

305
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,940
that most people are going to end up 
with high end careers.

306
00:15:34,941 --> 00:15:37,880
And then we also assume that most 
people,

307
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,823
even those who are qualified to have 
high end careers are actually the sort 

308
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:46,100
of people who would like to have high 
end careers if they could.

309
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,040
And that's also often not true.
So for example,

310
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:53,120
I've worked very intensely with a large 
population of female lawyers.

311
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,023
Uh,
usually,

312
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:58,010
usually partners at large law firms,
very,

313
00:15:58,011 --> 00:16:00,680
very successful women,
usually very attractive,

314
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:03,260
very intelligent,
extraordinarily conscientious,

315
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,663
um,
and the sort of people who were 

316
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,950
outstanding in high school and then 
outstanding as undergraduates.

317
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:13,490
And then ace law school and then did 
their articling perfectly and then,

318
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,673
uh,
became associates and then eventually 

319
00:16:16,341 --> 00:16:19,370
entered the partner stream in the large 
law firm and then became partners.

320
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:23,540
And a huge proportion of them wake up 
around 30,

321
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:24,374
somewhere between 30 and 32 and notice 
they're 65 hour days and the incredibly 

322
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:30,350
competitive environment that they happen
to be in.

323
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,423
And the fact that the demands of their 
career are only going to accelerate as 

324
00:16:34,371 --> 00:16:35,360
they move forward.
I mean,

325
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,720
they're going to make a lot of money,
but the,

326
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,583
the demands on their time of their 
career only going to accelerate as they 

327
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:45,641
move forward and decide quite rapidly 
that that's maybe not what they want.

328
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,400
And the reason for that is they also 
would like to have a life.

329
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,263
They'd like to have a relationship that 
they could attend to and they'd like to 

330
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:55,430
have children.
And the truth of the simple truth of the

331
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,900
matter is,
is that it's very,

332
00:16:56,901 --> 00:16:57,734
very difficult to have a truly high end 
career and have an important 

333
00:17:01,911 --> 00:17:02,744
relationship and have children,
especially if there are two of you 

334
00:17:05,031 --> 00:17:05,990
trying to pursue that.

335
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:10,100
At the same time it's very difficult and
it's difficult to have a high end career

336
00:17:10,101 --> 00:17:10,934
period.
And it's also difficult to have a fully 

337
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:13,514
functional family.
Trying to combine those sorts of things 

338
00:17:15,621 --> 00:17:18,800
makes people who are,
I mean I've seen people do it,

339
00:17:18,801 --> 00:17:19,600
but man,
they,

340
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,420
they push themselves right to their 
limits and they usually have limits that

341
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:28,010
exceed the limits of typical people.
So one of the things we could do,

342
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,053
for example,
to revive interest in the good mother 

343
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:31,634
archetype is to stop telling lies to 
young women about what their life is 

344
00:17:34,341 --> 00:17:36,590
likely to be like.
Because my experience has been,

345
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,633
and you might think I'm old fashioned,
although I don't really think I am by 

346
00:17:39,681 --> 00:17:40,900
the way.
Um,

347
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,773
I think I'm actually quite current and I
pay a lot of attention to what's going 

348
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:45,014
on around me.
And my experience has been 

349
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,233
overwhelmingly that high caliber women 
decide in their thirties that 

350
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:55,440
relationship and family is the most 
important thing in their life.

351
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,160
And I think the reason that the fact 
that major law firms,

352
00:17:59,161 --> 00:17:59,994
for example,
have a really difficult time holding on 

353
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:02,724
to their high performing women,
even though they bend over backwards to 

354
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:07,320
do that is actually an indication of 
exactly that.

355
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:08,154
And this notion that it's a glass 
ceiling in some sense that are stopping 

356
00:18:10,951 --> 00:18:12,780
women from advancing up the corporate 
ladder,

357
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,200
I believe to be a truly erroneous as 
well as dangerous.

358
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:17,550
And I,
I don't think there's really any,

359
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:20,430
any really any evidence to support that.
So,

360
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,483
alright.
Fraser Burns says highly creative 

361
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:27,360
stupendously low in conscientiousness.
Am I do?

362
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,100
Um,
no,

363
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,053
you're not doomed.
And I think that openness and 

364
00:18:31,801 --> 00:18:34,620
conscientiousness are often at odds with
one another.

365
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:35,454
It isn't obvious to me how someone can 
easily be highly creative and ordered 

366
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:40,441
the,
for example,

367
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:45,441
because to be creative means to make 
some disorder in the intermediary stages

368
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:48,090
of being a creative person.

369
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:49,853
I would say also that many creative 
enterprises are not the sort of thing 

370
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,630
that anybody who was sensible from the 
perspective of being conscientious,

371
00:18:57,810 --> 00:19:01,620
conscientious would ever pursue.
Like the the lifestyle of a musician for

372
00:19:01,621 --> 00:19:05,220
example.
I would say though that if you're low in

373
00:19:05,221 --> 00:19:07,500
conscientiousness and really high in 
openness,

374
00:19:07,501 --> 00:19:09,750
high in creativity is that you're going 
to have,

375
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,260
you're going to be able to generate a 
lot of creative ideas,

376
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:15,150
but you're going to have a hard time 
implementing them.

377
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,343
You won't have the follow through and 
you may have to really learn to 

378
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:19,074
discipline yourself.
And I would say the simplest way to 

379
00:19:21,781 --> 00:19:22,614
start disciplining yourself is to use 
something like Google calendar to 

380
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,070
establish a schedule and stick to the 
damn thing.

381
00:19:29,071 --> 00:19:31,860
Like train yourself to get up at the 
same time.

382
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,753
Train yourself to eat at the same time.
Train yourself to follow a schedule so 

383
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:41,310
that you undertake the tasks that you 
need to undertake each week on a regular

384
00:19:41,311 --> 00:19:42,120
basis.

385
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,953
But,
but you can leave in that a little bit 

386
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:45,684
so that it doesn't become intolerable by
using the schedule to design days that 

387
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:49,314
you would want to have instead of just 
days that you should have like a 

388
00:19:51,811 --> 00:19:53,430
schedule.
It doesn't have to be a tyrant.

389
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,043
The proper use of his schedule enables 
you to have the maximum amount of 

390
00:19:57,901 --> 00:19:58,734
freedom while also maintaining the 
responsibility necessary to stop your 

391
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:02,424
life from auguring into the ground.
So if you're high in openness and and 

392
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,213
in,
in all likelihood you're fairly 

393
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:09,084
intelligent.
If that happens to be the case and 

394
00:20:10,381 --> 00:20:11,214
you're low in conscientiousness,
you might be able to get the best of 

395
00:20:12,871 --> 00:20:14,760
both worlds by learning to discipline 
yourself.

396
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:16,650
But it's going to be a step by step 
process.

397
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,693
And I would also say do something like 
the future authoring program from self 

398
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:23,580
authoring.com and even if you do it 
badly,

399
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:24,443
because one of the things that will help
you discipline yourself is to have a 

400
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:31,770
plan and a plan is this is the something
that all of you who are listening should

401
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:32,604
know is like,
I really recommend doing that future 

402
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:34,764
authoring program because you,
you will not get what you want unless 

403
00:20:39,121 --> 00:20:40,440
you figure out what it is.

404
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,543
You won't be as much to use to yourself 
and to the broader world unless you 

405
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,040
develop a vision and implement it.
And,

406
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,190
and the best way to do that is to do it 
seriously.

407
00:20:51,191 --> 00:20:53,650
And,
and one of the best ways to do something

408
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:55,840
seriously is to write about it.
So,

409
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,283
um,
my goal is to be married and on my way 

410
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,633
to starting a family within five years.
Is this a legitimate goal to have for 

411
00:21:03,281 --> 00:21:03,821
myself?
Well,

412
00:21:03,821 --> 00:21:04,960
absolutely.
I mean,

413
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,823
absolutely.
All of these things can be made 

414
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:08,560
conscious.
I mean,

415
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,010
you know,
we have this romantic belief,

416
00:21:12,011 --> 00:21:12,844
I suppose that if you open yourself up 
to opportunity than it will ferret you 

417
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:18,274
out in your dreams will come true.
But that's kind of a naive way of 

418
00:21:20,771 --> 00:21:23,560
looking at the world.
And it's much more likely to be the case

419
00:21:23,561 --> 00:21:27,940
that if you aim at something and,
and you aim carefully and thoughtfully,

420
00:21:27,941 --> 00:21:28,774
that you're,
that you will orient yourself in a 

421
00:21:30,761 --> 00:21:34,780
manner that makes you aware of the 
opportunities that will arise,

422
00:21:34,781 --> 00:21:36,190
that will put you in that direction.

423
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,650
That's actually how your perceptual 
systems work.

424
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:39,843
And so part of the reason that it's so 
useful to Orient Yourself with regards 

425
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,384
to a specific game is that your 
perceptual systems then turn on to tell 

426
00:21:47,861 --> 00:21:51,010
you what's going to facilitate your 
movement forward.

427
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:54,010
And also what's going to get in the way.
Now,

428
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,263
you don't want to be too single minded 
about it because you can get obsessive 

429
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,503
and you also want to maintain enough 
flexibility in your aim so that you can 

430
00:22:01,931 --> 00:22:02,764
change them when necessary.
But there's absolutely nothing wrong 

431
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:07,540
with deciding.
Not only,

432
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,970
you know,
over what period of,

433
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,990
during what timeframe you might want to 
get married and when you want might want

434
00:22:13,991 --> 00:22:14,824
to have children,
but what kind of partner you want to 

435
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:19,000
have and what,
what sort of interests you would like to

436
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:19,834
share with them and to really specify 
your life because it's much more likely 

437
00:22:22,871 --> 00:22:23,704
that it's going to be turned out in a 
positive manner for you and everybody 

438
00:22:25,901 --> 00:22:26,200
else.

439
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,330
If you put some intelligent thought into
it,

440
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,343
just like it's the case that almost 
everything is likely to turn out better 

441
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:33,250
if you,
if you do that.

442
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,263
Um,
do you suggest homeschooling with the 

443
00:22:38,051 --> 00:22:40,930
state public schools are currently in?
No,

444
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,943
I don't suggest it.
I think homeschooling is an incredibly 

445
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:49,081
difficult thing to pull off properly.
And I think that there,

446
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:53,470
I think that the number of people who 
would do it badly far exceeds the number

447
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:56,050
of people who would do it well.
Having said that,

448
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,200
it's not like I think it's wrong and 
it's also not like,

449
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:00,034
I think that there isn't increasing 
reason for parents to consider that 

450
00:23:02,711 --> 00:23:03,544
because I do actually think there's 
increasing reason for parents to 

451
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:06,334
consider that because the postmodern neo
marxists have got their claws into the 

452
00:23:09,461 --> 00:23:12,430
education system and I think they're 
doing everything they can.

453
00:23:12,431 --> 00:23:13,870
And you can certainly see that in,
in,

454
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:17,620
in Canada and in Ontario where the 
elementary teachers,

455
00:23:17,621 --> 00:23:20,170
Federation of Ontario has published 
there,

456
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,640
there,
there,

457
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:24,310
there,
I think it's guideline curriculum.

458
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,143
It's something like that that's 
basically a blueprint for transforming 

459
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,253
kids into social justice oriented 
individuals from kindergarten through 

460
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:33,034
grade eight.
So it's not surprising that people want 

461
00:23:34,331 --> 00:23:35,680
to do that.
So,

462
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,583
um,
but I think that parental rights trumps 

463
00:23:40,221 --> 00:23:41,054
state rights in relationship to children
and it has to be that way even though 

464
00:23:43,481 --> 00:23:44,314
there's lots of bad parents.
The thing about bad parents is that the 

465
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:51,950
state as parent is worse.
It's not like there are no bad parents,

466
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,113
but to assume that the state is going to
be a better parent on average than 

467
00:23:55,971 --> 00:23:58,580
parents who actually love their children
is a very bad idea.

468
00:23:59,090 --> 00:23:59,923
So why is Jordan Peterson's Webcam a 
thousand times better than all of my 

469
00:24:05,181 --> 00:24:06,014
favorite youtube.
Youtube is with millions of subscribers 

470
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:13,370
because my son Julian,
who helps me with technical matters,

471
00:24:13,371 --> 00:24:14,204
bought a Dlsr l camera dlsr camera for 
me that happens to work extremely well 

472
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:22,880
except the battery runs out about every 
hour and 15 minutes and I have to change

473
00:24:22,881 --> 00:24:23,030
it.

474
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,210
So,
um,

475
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,450
and I think there's,
there's,

476
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,710
it would be nice if I could actually 
plug it in with an adapter,

477
00:24:30,711 --> 00:24:31,544
but I think that that changes the 
category of camera to video camera and 

478
00:24:34,701 --> 00:24:36,770
then there's tax implications or 
something like that.

479
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:37,604
So I have the high quality camera and I 
have to put up with the fact that the 

480
00:24:40,671 --> 00:24:41,660
battery dies.
So,

481
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,363
um,
how do I plan to buffer myself from the 

482
00:24:45,261 --> 00:24:49,190
deteriorating tier you're aiding side 
effect of success?

483
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,320
That's a really good question actually.
Um,

484
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,890
I can tell you a bunch of answers to 
that.

485
00:24:54,891 --> 00:24:55,780
I mean,
the first is,

486
00:24:55,781 --> 00:25:00,230
is that I have a sensible family,
a son and a daughter,

487
00:25:00,231 --> 00:25:03,530
and soon to be a son in law and a 
daughter in law as well,

488
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:07,880
who I like and who liked me.
And we get along really well and they're

489
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:10,760
really sensible people.
And so they help keep me,

490
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,470
my feet nailed to the ground.

491
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,303
And so does my wife because my wife is 
also an extremely sensible person and 

492
00:25:16,011 --> 00:25:16,844
someone I really deeply trust.
And I'm also fortunate in that I have 

493
00:25:20,091 --> 00:25:23,300
parents who,
who play that role with me as well and a

494
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:25,670
sister and a brother in law.
Um,

495
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:27,383
and,
and my brother as well who helped me 

496
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,173
stay
attuned to the potential dangers that 

497
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:41,220
this widespread public exposure might 
otherwise produce.

498
00:25:41,221 --> 00:25:43,970
But so,
but the other issue,

499
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:46,040
so there's that,
I have advisors,

500
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:48,500
let's say,
who are on my side who tell me the truth

501
00:25:48,501 --> 00:25:52,880
and we discussed what I'm doing all the 
time to make sure that it's staying more

502
00:25:52,881 --> 00:25:55,430
or less on track.
The other thing too is though,

503
00:25:55,431 --> 00:25:57,890
you know,
I'm not exactly a young man anymore.

504
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:00,000
I'm 55.
And um,

505
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:00,973
I think a lot of the detrimental 
elements of widespread public exposure 

506
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,613
are things that would have been a lot 
more harmful or that are a lot more 

507
00:26:10,191 --> 00:26:11,750
harmful to people when they're younger.

508
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,613
There's just a lot of things about being
in the public eye that don't have the 

509
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:19,640
same cache to me that they might have 
when I was a younger person or that they

510
00:26:19,641 --> 00:26:20,474
would have to a younger person.
And I guess I would also say that I 

511
00:26:23,211 --> 00:26:26,300
don't really believe that I'm the sort 
of person to let,

512
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:31,250
and I'm not trying to put myself on a 
higher moral plane or anything with this

513
00:26:31,251 --> 00:26:32,930
comment,
but I don't think I'm the kind of person

514
00:26:32,931 --> 00:26:37,931
to let the sort of thing that's happened
over the last year or so really go to my

515
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:39,823
head.
And I think part of the reason for that 

516
00:26:40,971 --> 00:26:44,670
is it that I have a fairly pronounced 
depressive temperament and so that I can

517
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:48,690
see the negative side of myself with,
with plenty painful clarity.

518
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:49,500
And,
um,

519
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,333
I'm also more concerned about the 
possibility of making a catastrophic 

520
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:55,584
mistake as I present my self publicly 
than I am in what clambering up some 

521
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,550
power louder I suppose in elevating 
myself to a position at the top.

522
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,840
I'm just not that interested in that.
And so I think,

523
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,070
and I'm,
I'm also,

524
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,993
I think fairly aware of the dangers of,
of well let's say fame to the degree 

525
00:27:17,701 --> 00:27:19,340
that that's what's occurred to me.
Um,

526
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,070
I know the downside of that and it isn't
something that I'm interested in it,

527
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,210
I'm actually,
I know it's a strange thing but to think

528
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:31,044
about,
but I'm actually also rather private 

529
00:27:32,311 --> 00:27:34,170
person and,
and um,

530
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,320
although I'm,
I can't keep my mouth shut obviously,

531
00:27:37,321 --> 00:27:39,330
and I'm,
I'm very talkative.

532
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,433
That's from being very high in openness,
even more than being high in 

533
00:27:42,211 --> 00:27:44,540
extroversion I think.
And uh,

534
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:52,970
but there isn't anything that comes 
along with the dark side of fame,

535
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:53,964
let's say,
that I would find particularly 

536
00:27:54,931 --> 00:27:56,550
attractive.
You know,

537
00:27:56,551 --> 00:28:00,030
I'm not really interested in partying 
endlessly,

538
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:03,120
although I had my time doing that when I
was young.

539
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,780
I'm certainly not interested in,
um,

540
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,613
whatever additional attractiveness to 
two females that my more well known the 

541
00:28:13,561 --> 00:28:14,394
fact that I'm more my well known might 
provide to me that that just doesn't 

542
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,473
interest me at all.
I'm very happy in my marriage and also 

543
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,713
very aware of the catastrophes that lie 
in directions of that sort of 

544
00:28:27,361 --> 00:28:28,440
temptation.
So,

545
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,620
um,
but,

546
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:33,750
but I also,
I think of all those explanations,

547
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:34,584
the one that's most relevant is my see,
I know that I'm walking a tight rope in 

548
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:40,374
some sense and that it would be very 
easy for me to make the kind of error 

549
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:44,130
that would sink me.

550
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,760
Um,
and I'm,

551
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,673
I know that there are many people who 
don't approve of what I'm doing who 

552
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:54,690
would be very happy about that.
And so I think also living in a somewhat

553
00:28:55,050 --> 00:29:00,050
constant state of existential terror 
about the probability that this house of

554
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:01,974
cards could collapse is also something 
that keeps me oriented in the humble 

555
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:10,620
direction and
dwelling on this a little bit.

556
00:29:10,621 --> 00:29:12,270
But it really is an interesting 
question.

557
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:13,643
I am also,
I believe I also have trained myself so 

558
00:29:16,831 --> 00:29:17,664
that I orient myself mostly to 
considering what I'm doing wrong and 

559
00:29:20,641 --> 00:29:23,070
what I couldn't be doing better than 
what I'm doing right.

560
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:28,610
And so I'm always on the lookout in all 
of the presentations I make four where I

561
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,850
didn't say things as clearly as I might 
have been,

562
00:29:32,851 --> 00:29:33,684
where I could have improved my delivery.
And so concentrating on where what I 

563
00:29:37,801 --> 00:29:38,634
have yet to attain is also a good way of
keeping whatever ego boost there might 

564
00:29:43,961 --> 00:29:48,010
be in more widespread public recognition
under control.

565
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,660
Having said that,
I'm very,

566
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,710
it's not like I'm ungrateful for the 
fact that all this has happened.

567
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:56,290
It's actually an amazing thrill.
I mean,

568
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,540
things happen to me all the time that 
are,

569
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,660
that are so overwhelmingly positive that
I can't believe it.

570
00:30:01,661 --> 00:30:02,494
So last night for example,
I went to this restaurant called the 

571
00:30:04,361 --> 00:30:05,194
cake and I go there because I have a lot
of food allergies and they're actually 

572
00:30:07,871 --> 00:30:09,910
very careful with people who have food 
allergies.

573
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,580
And,
uh,

574
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,140
the,
the waiter showed us to the table and he

575
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:14,974
knew who I was and he said that he had 
been watching my videos and that he had 

576
00:30:17,501 --> 00:30:21,040
had four promotions.
I think that's what he's doing.

577
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:21,671
He said,
yeah,

578
00:30:21,671 --> 00:30:24,250
four promotions in the last four months 
at the cake.

579
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,593
And the reason for that was that he had 
been watching my lectures and decided 

580
00:30:28,181 --> 00:30:29,014
that he was going to adopt a more 
responsible attitude as an employee and 

581
00:30:31,511 --> 00:30:33,190
also do,
you know,

582
00:30:33,191 --> 00:30:36,310
we'll start pushing the development of 
his career at this,

583
00:30:36,311 --> 00:30:37,300
at this restaurant.

584
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,133
And that had worked out brilliantly.
And like it was so positive because you 

585
00:30:42,071 --> 00:30:44,950
know it,
and I thought about it as a true victory

586
00:30:44,951 --> 00:30:48,850
on his part because he took the 
situation that he was actually in,

587
00:30:48,851 --> 00:30:49,684
so a real situation and decided that he 
was going to maximize the opportunity 

588
00:30:53,861 --> 00:30:55,840
that was there for him.
And you know,

589
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,670
there's nothing about that.
It's negative,

590
00:30:57,671 --> 00:31:00,700
it's all positive and it's a personal 
story.

591
00:31:00,701 --> 00:31:04,420
And he shared it with me and I had some 
small role in bringing that about.

592
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:07,510
And like that's just an absolute thrill 
as far as I'm concerned.

593
00:31:07,511 --> 00:31:09,340
Like every time someone writes me and 
says,

594
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,453
I've been watching your videos and I've 
just decided to sort out my life and to 

595
00:31:14,261 --> 00:31:16,840
aim higher and that's working,
it's just like,

596
00:31:16,841 --> 00:31:17,674
it's such a thrill for me to be able to 
provide that service for hundreds of 

597
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:22,390
thousands of people.

598
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,950
It's like,
it's a,

599
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,443
it's an unbelievable privilege and I 
hope I can figure out how to do it 

600
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,620
better and better as I get more and more
practiced at it.

601
00:31:32,621 --> 00:31:33,820
I mean,
that's really the aim.

602
00:31:33,821 --> 00:31:35,650
And with my colleagues,
uh,

603
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,020
Daniel Higgins for example,
I have two business partner,

604
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,913
Daniel Higgins and,
and Robert Peale peale was my graduate 

605
00:31:42,971 --> 00:31:43,804
advisor and mcgill and Daniel Higgins 
was one of my graduate students at 

606
00:31:46,961 --> 00:31:47,794
Harvard and we've been working on making
psychological interventions accessible 

607
00:31:51,551 --> 00:31:52,384
to people for about 20 years.
So they helped me develop the self 

608
00:31:54,191 --> 00:31:56,170
authoring suite for two.
For example,

609
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,430
we have a whole host of,
um,

610
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:03,370
psychological tools in development,
including a future authoring program for

611
00:32:03,371 --> 00:32:06,730
high school students that we want to 
bring to the broader general public.

612
00:32:06,731 --> 00:32:10,330
And so this public exposure also gives 
me the opportunity to,

613
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:11,703
to make what I know as a clinical 
psychologist and as someone with some 

614
00:32:15,671 --> 00:32:19,060
specialization in technology,
especially through my partnerships,

615
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,630
make that accessible to perhaps millions
of people.

616
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,310
I mean,
God,

617
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:26,320
that's,
that's just an amazing opportunity.

618
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:30,580
And so
someone asks,

619
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:34,330
how do you find the self authoring 
autobiography,

620
00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:35,170
um,
outline?

621
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,003
Well,
you go to the self authoring.com it's 

622
00:32:37,151 --> 00:32:38,950
available there.
Um,

623
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:40,483
let's see.

624
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,223
MMM,

625
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,600
somewhat.
And at Adler says,

626
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:51,020
I have also done better in a lot of 
things due to your kicks in the ass.

627
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:51,981
Yeah.
Well,

628
00:32:51,981 --> 00:32:52,814
I mean,
that's great and that I'm thrilled to 

629
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:54,674
hear that.
Um,

630
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,780
see,
part of it,

631
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,093
you see,
the thing about disciplining someone 

632
00:33:00,351 --> 00:33:01,184
let's say is that when you,
and I see this very clearly when I'm 

633
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:05,234
talking to young people,
is that I really on the side of the 

634
00:33:07,941 --> 00:33:08,774
person that wants to do something 
positive with their life to make their 

635
00:33:14,751 --> 00:33:15,584
own life better.
Because I think that's where you should 

636
00:33:16,671 --> 00:33:17,504
start.
You should start by making maximizing 

637
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,800
the quality of your own life.
That's not a selfish thing.

638
00:33:21,801 --> 00:33:22,634
Or if it is,
it's the right kind of selfishness and 

639
00:33:24,441 --> 00:33:25,274
that you should figure out how to do 
that in a way that's of benefit to your 

640
00:33:27,441 --> 00:33:29,150
friends and your family and your 
community.

641
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,190
And you should take that deadly 
seriously.

642
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,263
And the reason you should do that is 
because that just makes life better for 

643
00:33:35,031 --> 00:33:35,864
everyone and it re it reduces a fair bit
of the misery that would otherwise be 

644
00:33:40,311 --> 00:33:41,144
part and parcel of life.
And it makes everything function 

645
00:33:43,431 --> 00:33:45,320
smoothly.
And one of the things I'm really curious

646
00:33:45,321 --> 00:33:48,350
about is what the world would be like if
everybody decided to do that.

647
00:33:48,351 --> 00:33:49,184
Because human beings are really 
remarkable creatures and we humble 

648
00:33:51,591 --> 00:33:52,424
ourselves very badly.
With deception and resentment and 

649
00:33:54,651 --> 00:33:59,120
revenge and the desire to make things 
worse and arrogance and all those,

650
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,550
all those sins,
let's say that,

651
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:02,803
that,
that make us deviate from our True Path 

652
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:09,080
and our true path should be something 
like imagine the noblest aim,

653
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,123
then you can conceptualize and then 
sacrifice your life to attempting to 

654
00:34:13,521 --> 00:34:14,354
attain it.
And there's nothing in that that isn't 

655
00:34:16,611 --> 00:34:17,660
good for everyone.

656
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,230
And so apart from the fact that it 
requires a lot of responsibility,

657
00:34:21,231 --> 00:34:23,690
I just can't see why everyone wouldn't 
do that.

658
00:34:23,691 --> 00:34:27,140
And when I'm talking to young people and
it was shaking my finger and saying,

659
00:34:27,141 --> 00:34:29,810
you know,
grow the hell up and get mature and take

660
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:34,790
on some responsibility,
I'm not saying that because I'm an enemy

661
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:35,624
of the person,
I'm saying it because I'm the best 

662
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:41,190
friend of the part of them that would 
really like to walk in the light and,

663
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:44,210
and it's an invitation to walk in the 
light and,

664
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:47,840
and it would be remarkable.
This is what we need to do as far as I'm

665
00:34:47,841 --> 00:34:50,660
concerned,
not only in the West but in the world at

666
00:34:50,661 --> 00:34:51,494
large,
but maybe in the West first is we have 

667
00:34:52,761 --> 00:34:53,594
to consciously decide that we're going 
to do everything we can as individuals 

668
00:34:58,881 --> 00:34:59,714
to walk in the light and to regard that 
as a noble and heroic endeavor and to 

669
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,230
make that first and foremost in our 
lives.

670
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,840
And that's what we should be educating 
young people to do.

671
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:09,674
And they can do that.
And so I have dozens of people writing 

672
00:35:11,841 --> 00:35:12,674
to me and,
and talking to me all the time who are 

673
00:35:14,331 --> 00:35:15,830
saying the same thing they're saying,
look,

674
00:35:15,831 --> 00:35:19,400
I've really been trying to get my act 
together over the last six months.

675
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,413
I've been trying not to lie,
which is slightly different than trying 

676
00:35:23,241 --> 00:35:24,170
to tell the truth,
right?

677
00:35:24,171 --> 00:35:27,500
It's a more humble goal to not lie 
because you can tell when you're lying,

678
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:29,720
but you can't necessarily tell when 
you're telling the truth.

679
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,180
And I,
I've been coming up with a plan and I've

680
00:35:32,181 --> 00:35:34,880
been trying to discipline myself and 
I've been cleaning up my room,

681
00:35:34,881 --> 00:35:35,714
which is like a nice humble act that 
that involves transforming chaos into 

682
00:35:39,061 --> 00:35:40,290
order.
And they write and say,

683
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:41,124
God,
things are just working out way better 

684
00:35:42,151 --> 00:35:42,540
for me.

685
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,620
It's like,
Whoa,

686
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,510
do it man.
That's just,

687
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:49,260
you keep that up for 15 years and you'll
be unbeatable.

688
00:35:49,261 --> 00:35:52,290
And that's what we should be convincing 
young people to be,

689
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:53,124
is to be unbeatable.
And not because that's what they should 

690
00:35:55,471 --> 00:35:56,304
do or because they're bad if they don't,
but because there's nothing better you 

691
00:35:59,371 --> 00:36:00,204
can possibly do with your limited and 
you're limited and suffering bound life 

692
00:36:05,611 --> 00:36:09,240
than to aim high and,
and sacrifice yourself to the attainment

693
00:36:09,241 --> 00:36:11,100
of those goals.
So that's,

694
00:36:11,101 --> 00:36:14,130
uh,
being a highly creative woman,

695
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:17,370
I find myself fearful that having kids 
will be spiritual suicide,

696
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,413
hindering my endeavors.
But I also don't want to have an 

697
00:36:20,131 --> 00:36:23,370
unfulfilled life.
Can I have a full life without kids?

698
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:24,631
Well,
yes,

699
00:36:24,631 --> 00:36:26,100
I,
I suspect you can.

700
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,330
Although it's risky,
Maddie,

701
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:30,300
because it's really important for people
to have kids.

702
00:36:30,301 --> 00:36:33,480
Because the thing is is that you get 
older than 40,

703
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,210
and our culture is kind of dopey in that
regards.

704
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:39,960
It's underdeveloped.
We live as if we live as if we,

705
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,420
we only exist when we're young and we 
don't.

706
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:47,690
It's like what are you going to do from 
the ages of say 45 to 90 or 95?

707
00:36:47,731 --> 00:36:49,440
You,
you need a family around you.

708
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:52,080
You need to see your children grow.
You need to have grandchildren.

709
00:36:52,081 --> 00:36:52,914
It's a major part,
maybe the most important part of the 

710
00:36:55,231 --> 00:36:57,450
last half of life.
No,

711
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:58,523
you said being a highly creative woman,
I find myself fearful that having kids 

712
00:37:01,591 --> 00:37:03,030
will be spiritual suicide.
Well,

713
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:03,893
that's the part of your question that I 
would really address because I would 

714
00:37:05,971 --> 00:37:06,601
say,
well,

715
00:37:06,601 --> 00:37:09,660
don't let them be spiritual suicide.
You know,

716
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:10,494
it may be that there's a certain amount 
of time that you need to take away from 

717
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:15,180
the kids.
That,

718
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,010
and this is the case for parents in 
general,

719
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:19,440
um,
so that you can pursue your own creative

720
00:37:19,441 --> 00:37:19,950
endeavors.

721
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:22,830
It's children do not have to devour your
life.

722
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,350
In fact,
if you let them devour your life,

723
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,540
then you'll hate them and you mistreat 
them.

724
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,673
And so what you want to do is to set 
yourself up so that you can have 

725
00:37:31,351 --> 00:37:34,290
children and have a life and that's 
better for the children.

726
00:37:34,291 --> 00:37:37,290
And it's better for you.
Like children can be taught,

727
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,710
encouraged to spend a fair bit of time,
not when they're infants,

728
00:37:40,711 --> 00:37:41,544
obviously,
but to spend a fair bit of time amusing 

729
00:37:43,801 --> 00:37:44,634
themselves.
And that's especially the case if you 

730
00:37:46,081 --> 00:37:49,620
have more than one child because they'll
mutually amuse one another.

731
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:52,860
It's actually easier in some ways to 
have more than one child.

732
00:37:52,861 --> 00:37:55,470
Because with one child,
you're constantly amusing the child.

733
00:37:55,471 --> 00:37:58,380
But with two or three,
then they're off in their little,

734
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,460
you know,
club.

735
00:37:59,461 --> 00:38:02,670
Especially if you can stop them from 
developing sibling rivalry,

736
00:38:02,671 --> 00:38:05,280
that's too intense and they can monitor 
themselves.

737
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,113
So the trick is if you're a highly 
creative woman is be disagreeable and 

738
00:38:09,281 --> 00:38:12,810
now so that you can carve yourself out 
your own space so that you don't come to

739
00:38:12,811 --> 00:38:14,940
resent your children.
You're afraid of that.

740
00:38:14,941 --> 00:38:18,270
You're afraid that it looks like you're 
afraid that if you,

741
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:21,660
if you give yourself to children,
there'll be nothing left for you.

742
00:38:21,661 --> 00:38:23,040
And um,
you know,

743
00:38:23,041 --> 00:38:25,620
that could happen if you have children 
who have terrible health problems,

744
00:38:25,621 --> 00:38:26,454
for example,
but you can't protect yourself against 

745
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:32,310
those eventualities in life anyways.
But I would say your best bet is to be a

746
00:38:32,311 --> 00:38:34,320
more selfish mother.
And believe me,

747
00:38:34,321 --> 00:38:36,040
I've had more clients

748
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,280
who were ruined by mothers who were too 
unselfish than I've had clients who were

749
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:40,114
ruined by mothers who were too selfish.
So you need to be there when the kids 

750
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,810
need you,
but you shouldn't be there any more than

751
00:38:46,811 --> 00:38:48,700
is necessarily.
So

752
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,153
let's see,

753
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:00,903
Adam Watson,
I feared having kids for the same 

754
00:39:02,201 --> 00:39:04,000
reason.
I'm a full time pro artist.

755
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:08,350
You make your own normal said my 
therapist jp is speaking the truth.

756
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,520
Yeah,
well that's the,

757
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:12,880
oh,
that's the thing.

758
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,073
You know,
don't be thinking that you can't 

759
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,730
organize your life when you have 
children.

760
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,000
The thing about modern people is that 
they're terrified of children,

761
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:23,163
they and this because they think they 
regard children as if they're miniature 

762
00:39:26,651 --> 00:39:28,720
tyrants.
They can be of course,

763
00:39:28,721 --> 00:39:33,220
because anyone will tyrannized over you 
if you allow them to,

764
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,593
perhaps not anyone but virtually anyone.
Why not regulate your children's 

765
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:40,560
behavior?
I wrote a chapter in my new book called,

766
00:39:40,561 --> 00:39:42,730
uh,
don't let your children do anything that

767
00:39:42,731 --> 00:39:43,564
makes you dislike them and that's like 
really serious advice is like if you 

768
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,273
allow your children to conduct 
themselves around you in a manner that 

769
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:52,840
makes you dislike them,
if you're being honest,

770
00:39:52,841 --> 00:39:55,810
if you're paying attention to the shadow
side of yourself,

771
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:56,644
that can be aggressive and destructive,
then then if you allow your children to 

772
00:40:01,841 --> 00:40:04,660
do things that make you dislike them,
then they're going to,

773
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,570
they're having children is going to mess
up your life,

774
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,800
but you don't have to do that.

775
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:12,280
You're actually,
you actually have a tremendous amount of

776
00:40:12,281 --> 00:40:16,390
control over the quality of your 
relationship with your children and also

777
00:40:16,391 --> 00:40:19,210
the manner in which you choose to 
disperse your time.

778
00:40:19,211 --> 00:40:20,980
And I mean you're,
you've got,

779
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:26,590
if you're willing to think it through 
and be clear,

780
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:28,203
you can be in charge of your household.
The children don't have to be in charge 

781
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:34,180
and it's not good for them to be in 
charge anyways.

782
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,014
So people are afraid of children and 
it's too bad because children are 

783
00:40:38,411 --> 00:40:39,790
absolutely wonderful.
I mean,

784
00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:40,624
you have to be careful with them and 
they get tired and they get hungry and 

785
00:40:43,571 --> 00:40:46,630
they get hot and,
and they don't have an attention span.

786
00:40:46,631 --> 00:40:49,990
That's as long as an adult who has a 
long attention span,

787
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:55,090
but they're great company and they're 
unbelievably comical and they love you.

788
00:40:55,091 --> 00:40:55,924
And like they,
they give back far more than they take 

789
00:40:58,391 --> 00:41:00,670
if you have an ounce of sense when 
you're dealing with them.

790
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,380
So,
yeah.

791
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:05,170
So,
so don't be afraid of children,

792
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:07,030
man.
You're,

793
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:10,080
you're the adult for God's sake.
You've got the upper hand and,

794
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:12,640
and if you have a partner,
you can rely on Walden.

795
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:13,893
You know,
you can both decide how it is that 

796
00:41:15,671 --> 00:41:18,250
you're going to run your household so 
that you're actually thrilled to death,

797
00:41:18,251 --> 00:41:20,020
that you have kids in that you have a 
life.

798
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,960
So,
all right,

799
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:23,883
let's see.

800
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:40,270
When am I appearing on each three h 
three November,

801
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,860
I believe.
November 3rd.

802
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,900
So I'm looking forward to that.

803
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,673
MMM.

804
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,103
Let's see.
How do you help someone with borderline 

805
00:41:53,501 --> 00:41:55,750
personality disorder?
That's Matthew Dodson.

806
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,361
Matthew,
you know,

807
00:42:03,361 --> 00:42:04,194
I'd like to answer that question,
but it's so damn complicated that I 

808
00:42:06,091 --> 00:42:08,060
don't think I can manage it.
Um,

809
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,233
so instead of doing a bad job,
even though that's a very interesting 

810
00:42:11,911 --> 00:42:14,070
question,
I'm afraid I'm going to skip that.

811
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:15,523
MMM.

812
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:20,140
Let's look back at the pigeonhole panel 
here.

813
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:21,323
Um,

814
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,453
okay.

815
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,850
Do you consider this,

816
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,133
okay,

817
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,510
some people have criticized my portrayal
of postmodernism.

818
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:46,710
In what ways would you claim you are a 
fair or unfair in your assessment of its

819
00:42:46,711 --> 00:42:47,640
core principles?

820
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,370
Well,
um,

821
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:56,400
I've done my best to,
to give it an evenhanded assessment.

822
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:57,743
MMM.

823
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:58,983
And

824
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:02,723
I think I'm unfair in that any rather 
truncated criticism of a large body of 

825
00:43:09,361 --> 00:43:10,194
thought is liable to clip a few corners.
But I would say that I'm attempting to 

826
00:43:16,861 --> 00:43:21,120
provide a snapshot,
a relatively accurate but low resolution

827
00:43:21,121 --> 00:43:26,121
snapshot of a certain kind of war id on 
a war of ideas that's currently going on

828
00:43:26,221 --> 00:43:27,054
in our culture.
And that's primarily centered in the 

829
00:43:28,441 --> 00:43:29,274
universities.
And I don't think my assessment of 

830
00:43:30,781 --> 00:43:34,560
postmodernism and its relationship with 
neo Marxism is unfair in the least.

831
00:43:34,561 --> 00:43:37,920
In fact,
I think that the danger that's presented

832
00:43:37,921 --> 00:43:38,754
by that combination of ideological,
of ideological presumptions is more 

833
00:43:45,091 --> 00:43:47,460
dangerous than people are currently 
aware of.

834
00:43:47,461 --> 00:43:48,294
And that poses a larger threat to the 
integrity of our culture then then I've 

835
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:56,430
currently stated it's more widespread 
than I thought.

836
00:43:56,431 --> 00:43:58,080
For example,
when I first started,

837
00:43:58,550 --> 00:43:59,383
um,
speaking out against postmodernism and 

838
00:44:02,671 --> 00:44:04,710
neo Marxism,
I didn't realize,

839
00:44:04,711 --> 00:44:07,110
for example,
that the law schools had turned into,

840
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:10,650
it had turned into training grounds for 
social justice activists.

841
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:11,483
I didn't realize that the legal system,
the legal training system had become 

842
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:15,443
corrupt,
perhaps not to the same degrees as say 

843
00:44:17,401 --> 00:44:19,290
the faculties of education or social 
work.

844
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,393
Certainly a long ways down that road.
And so I think I do believe that 

845
00:44:25,051 --> 00:44:28,620
postmodernism is an intellectually 
bankrupt school of thought.

846
00:44:28,621 --> 00:44:33,270
And I believe that its alliance with neo
Marxism borders on malevolent and it may

847
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:34,104
even go past the border into actual 
malevolence because I don't understand 

848
00:44:37,921 --> 00:44:38,754
how anybody with an inkling of 
historical sense can take a look at the 

849
00:44:41,401 --> 00:44:44,100
20th century.
And then dare put forward ideas that are

850
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:47,070
derived from Marxism as a,
as a,

851
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:52,250
as a treatment for any of society's 
hypothetical disorders.

852
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,453
And it,
it's not to say that I don't leave that 

853
00:44:54,721 --> 00:44:58,210
there are,
that there are errors in,

854
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,000
in,
in western culture,

855
00:45:00,001 --> 00:45:02,160
say for,
for whatever that's worth.

856
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:03,023
I mean,
individuals make more errors all the 

857
00:45:04,741 --> 00:45:08,430
time in groups make moral errors and 
cultures make moral errors.

858
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:09,863
That isn't the issue.
The issue is how are we doing compared 

859
00:45:14,071 --> 00:45:16,710
to any reasonable alternatives.
Um,

860
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:18,383
what makes you think that it's,
it's appropriate to compare the 

861
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,390
performance of western societies,
for example,

862
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:27,540
to some hypothetical utopia of your own 
fictional imagining,

863
00:45:27,541 --> 00:45:31,290
especially when we seen what sort of 
utopias have emerged out of,

864
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,371
uh,
out of,

865
00:45:32,371 --> 00:45:34,440
out of such imaginings.
And,

866
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:35,393
um,
what is it that you are offering people 

867
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:38,573
as a concrete alternative than all I see
in postmodernism is destruction and 

868
00:45:42,001 --> 00:45:45,420
nihilism and always see in neo Marxism 
is historical ignorance,

869
00:45:45,421 --> 00:45:49,320
malevolence and misdiagnosis.
Well,

870
00:45:49,321 --> 00:45:51,540
and in gratitude and arrogance,
I mean,

871
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:56,040
the list goes on and on.
So I don't feel that I've misrepresented

872
00:45:56,041 --> 00:45:56,874
the postmodernists in the least.
And I find I regard like I've read a 

873
00:45:59,821 --> 00:46:00,654
fair bit of Foodco less of Derrida but 
enough to get a pretty good sense of 

874
00:46:03,421 --> 00:46:04,290
what he's on about.

875
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:08,850
Like foucault is readable but more or 
less obvious as far as I'm concerned.

876
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:13,350
And so he's a third rate thinker and 
Derrida is just a troublemaker as far as

877
00:46:13,351 --> 00:46:14,970
I'm concerned.
Although a very brilliant one.

878
00:46:14,971 --> 00:46:15,804
And the idea that the postmodernist had 
that there's an infinite number of ways 

879
00:46:19,081 --> 00:46:23,280
of interpreting any set of data,
let's say that's how actually happens to

880
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:26,700
be a true observation and a very 
problematic one,

881
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:29,040
which is partly why it's,
it's so difficult,

882
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:31,230
for example,
to evolve a system that can,

883
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:32,603
that can visually perceive the world and
why about half our brain is devoted 

884
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:36,330
towards that.
It's,

885
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,193
it's definitely the case that coming up 
with a viable interpretation of the 

886
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:42,420
world is a very difficult process.
But,

887
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,590
but that's about as far as the validity 
of the postmodernist claims go.

888
00:46:46,591 --> 00:46:47,580
After that,
it's like,

889
00:46:47,581 --> 00:46:48,870
well,
yes,

890
00:46:48,871 --> 00:46:51,780
there's a very large number of potential
interpretations of the world,

891
00:46:51,781 --> 00:46:52,614
but there's a very small number have 
actually viable interpretations and 

892
00:46:55,171 --> 00:46:56,400
that's really what's relevant.

893
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:59,310
And viability is constrained by all 
sorts of,

894
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,533
of,
uh,

895
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,490
what would you call them?
Well,

896
00:47:02,491 --> 00:47:04,440
let's call them constraints.
Yes.

897
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:06,660
Um,
you,

898
00:47:06,661 --> 00:47:07,494
you have to interpret the world in a 
manner that's commensurate with the 

899
00:47:11,761 --> 00:47:12,594
minimization of your own intolerable 
suffering that puts very tight 

900
00:47:16,651 --> 00:47:20,280
constraints on which interpretations 
you're allowed to bring forward.

901
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:24,330
You have to do that in a manner that's 
iterable and repeatable across time.

902
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:29,660
You have to do that in a way that isn't 
too objectionable other people,

903
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:30,514
or even better in a manner that makes 
them want to cooperate and compete with 

904
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,170
you so that,
you know,

905
00:47:35,171 --> 00:47:36,004
a rising tide lifts all boats.
There's immense constraints on 

906
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:45,360
organizing your perceptions in a manner 
that is similar [inaudible] individually

907
00:47:45,911 --> 00:47:46,744
and socially highly functional.
And the postmodernist Joseph just don't 

908
00:47:49,811 --> 00:47:51,990
grapple without at all.
They and,

909
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:52,883
and they're,
they're biologically ignorant beyond 

910
00:47:55,001 --> 00:47:56,880
belief and proud of that fact.

911
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,750
Anyways,
as you can tell,

912
00:47:59,020 --> 00:47:59,853
I can hardly say enough things that 
aren't good about postmodern neo 

913
00:48:03,191 --> 00:48:04,300
Marxists.
There's,

914
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:05,163
there's,
apart from the fact that they got the 

915
00:48:06,431 --> 00:48:08,710
initial observation right,
which is that there's a very,

916
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:09,633
there's almost an infinite number of 
ways of interpreting a finite set of 

917
00:48:11,981 --> 00:48:14,740
data.
Everything else they've done is not only

918
00:48:14,741 --> 00:48:15,574
intellectually bankrupt,
it's also morally reprehensible and I 

919
00:48:18,101 --> 00:48:21,190
think they're corrupting our culture and
I think they're,

920
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,430
they're,
they're hurting young people and they're

921
00:48:24,431 --> 00:48:28,210
hurting them as well by getting them to 
pay for being hurt,

922
00:48:28,211 --> 00:48:31,310
which is really quite a malevolent,
um,

923
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:33,280
um,
enterprise.

924
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:36,760
So I've got no,
what would you call,

925
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:37,923
I have absolutely no regrets about going
after the postmodern neo Marxists as 

926
00:48:43,691 --> 00:48:47,230
hard as I possibly can and I'm certainly
not done doing so.

927
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,970
So one of the things that's going to 
happen,

928
00:48:48,971 --> 00:48:50,770
for example,
in the next month or so,

929
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,140
I've been working with a programmer 
who's,

930
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:56,290
who's volunteered his services and has 
already produced this.

931
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:57,123
He's,
he's produced a website that enables 

932
00:48:58,901 --> 00:48:59,734
people to enter text that will then 
classify the text as postmodern or non 

933
00:49:03,911 --> 00:49:04,744
postmodern.
And so you'll be able to enter course 

934
00:49:06,371 --> 00:49:09,550
descriptions from universities,
the course description,

935
00:49:09,551 --> 00:49:11,080
the professor's name,
the discipline,

936
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:14,260
and the university.
It will tell you the degree to which the

937
00:49:14,261 --> 00:49:17,500
description is postmodern and then you 
can decide for yourself whether you want

938
00:49:17,501 --> 00:49:19,780
to take that it become a social justice 
warrior.

939
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:20,653
That's what you think your education 
should be about or if you should avoid 

940
00:49:23,231 --> 00:49:25,150
that,
like the plague that it truly is.

941
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,820
And so my goal,
if I had to set a personal goal,

942
00:49:27,821 --> 00:49:28,654
and this is the sort of thing maybe that
you guys are helping me do with my 

943
00:49:31,151 --> 00:49:31,984
continued support on Patrion,
is that I'd like to knock enrollment in 

944
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:38,920
the postmodern disciplines down by 75% 
over the next five years.

945
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,173
I think that,
I think I'm thinking about it from the 

946
00:49:42,731 --> 00:49:45,880
perspective of of nonviolent warfare.

947
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,713
It's that serious to me and that this 
would be equivalent to cutting off the 

948
00:49:49,901 --> 00:49:51,790
supply chain.
It's like the,

949
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,673
the,
the postmodernists need a continual 

950
00:49:54,971 --> 00:49:55,804
influx of young impressionable minds in 
order to continue their propagandistic 

951
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,113
and society devouring efforts.
And I'm going to do absolutely 

952
00:50:03,791 --> 00:50:07,210
everything I can to cut that supply 
chain off at the source hopefully,

953
00:50:07,211 --> 00:50:08,044
and,
and reduce their enrollment to the zero 

954
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,600
that would match their citation rate for
their publications.

955
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,033
So would I in my career as an academic 
in order to enter politics as a 

956
00:50:19,151 --> 00:50:21,790
candidate for MP under Andrew Scheer's 
leadership?

957
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:25,270
Uh,
no I don't think I would do that.

958
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:26,133
I mean I thought for Awhile I thought at
one point of running for the leadership 

959
00:50:29,961 --> 00:50:30,794
of the Liberal Party in Canada and then 
I thought at another point in running 

960
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:35,510
for the leadership of the Conservative 
Party,

961
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:41,170
but both times I decided that what I was
doing as a academic,

962
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:46,970
and I would say as someone who's a 
phyllis philosophy,

963
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:51,830
a philosophy,
a philosophy and science cheeses,

964
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:53,023
it's been a long day guys.
I'm starting to forget how to talk as a 

965
00:50:56,151 --> 00:51:01,151
philosophically and scientifically 
minded psychologist was more useful than

966
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:06,170
anything I could likely do practically 
in the political realm.

967
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,033
And I haven't seen any reason to change 
that opinion as a consequence of the 

968
00:51:11,541 --> 00:51:12,374
events of the last eight months or so.
And so although I've always been 

969
00:51:15,471 --> 00:51:16,304
interested in

970
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:17,750
okay,

971
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:18,583
politics as a potential career route,
every time the opportunity has arisen 

972
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:23,983
and I've had to make a choice between 
continuing what I've been doing and 

973
00:51:27,471 --> 00:51:28,304
pursuing a political pathway,
I've always decided to continue doing 

974
00:51:31,941 --> 00:51:32,774
what I am doing.
And I think that's probably what I will 

975
00:51:35,031 --> 00:51:35,864
continue to do.
I actually think I can have more 

976
00:51:37,941 --> 00:51:41,990
influence doing what I'm doing,
that I could by doing anything else.

977
00:51:41,991 --> 00:51:42,824
And that's partly because I suppose if I
thought there was anything else I could 

978
00:51:45,711 --> 00:51:48,050
be doing that was more useful,
I'd be doing that instead.

979
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:50,720
So that's the answer to that.

980
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:52,383
MMM.

981
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:55,873
What is the role of art in a healthy 
culture is postmodernism as destructive 

982
00:51:59,671 --> 00:52:02,330
and in this domain as in politics?
Well,

983
00:52:02,331 --> 00:52:03,051
let,
let's,

984
00:52:03,051 --> 00:52:04,370
that's Michael Bamford.
Well,

985
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:06,290
what's the role of art in a healthy 
culture?

986
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:07,423
While the artists articulate the,
the artists are the people who first 

987
00:52:09,861 --> 00:52:10,694
articulate the unknown.
And so the role of artists in a healthy 

988
00:52:14,181 --> 00:52:15,014
culture is to bring to public awareness 
elements of being that have not yet 

989
00:52:20,031 --> 00:52:22,790
entered the,
the collective consciousness.

990
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:23,713
So you can imagine,
imagine that we're all living on an 

991
00:52:27,471 --> 00:52:28,304
island and many of us are in the center 
of the island far enough away so that 

992
00:52:31,911 --> 00:52:34,760
maybe we can't even see the shoreline 
and we can't see the ocean.

993
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:37,460
That's where our borders and,
but we're,

994
00:52:37,461 --> 00:52:41,390
we're distant from the artists are right
on the edge and they're,

995
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:42,800
they're,
they're,

996
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,310
they're,
they're expanding the landscape.

997
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:49,010
They're there,
they're moving the culture forward.

998
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:49,873
That's where my metaphor fails.
I guess they're moving the culture 

999
00:52:52,971 --> 00:52:56,630
forward into the unknown.
And they do that by translating what is,

1000
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:57,464
as of yet unimaginable,
but sensed into what is at least 

1001
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:05,740
imaginable and represented,
represented in image and,

1002
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:06,703
and drama and literature.
And that's the precursor to its full 

1003
00:53:09,441 --> 00:53:12,650
formulation in articulated philosophy 
and thought.

1004
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:15,140
And that's what artists do.
They're problem solvers.

1005
00:53:15,141 --> 00:53:17,360
They're problem detectors and problem 
solvers.

1006
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:18,583
That's what true artists do.
And they're always trying to solve 

1007
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,344
problems.
Like if you,

1008
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:23,930
there's a great documentary that was 
made about Picasso,

1009
00:53:23,931 --> 00:53:25,440
for example,
a painting.

1010
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:27,330
And unfortunately,
I can't remember the name of it.

1011
00:53:27,331 --> 00:53:28,164
I think it was made in 1957 it's 
available on youtube and it's in black 

1012
00:53:31,021 --> 00:53:36,021
and white and Picasso is filmed making a
painting on a,

1013
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:37,283
on a,
on a window so that you can see exactly 

1014
00:53:38,641 --> 00:53:40,980
what it's doing and you can watch them 
work with ideas.

1015
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:44,010
He,
he paint something in and then he erases

1016
00:53:44,011 --> 00:53:44,770
that,
you know,

1017
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:45,603
he paints over it.
Then he paints again and he paints over 

1018
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:48,144
it.
He moves the figures around on the 

1019
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,153
canvas.
It's,

1020
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:54,210
it's a window pane as I said.
And you can see him working out visual,

1021
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:58,950
you can see them working out problems 
and solutions to problems using,

1022
00:53:58,951 --> 00:54:02,850
using his visual imagination and the 
artistic product.

1023
00:54:02,851 --> 00:54:03,684
The painting is,
is the consequence of that rather than 

1024
00:54:05,431 --> 00:54:08,970
the aim of it.
The aim is to formulate the problems and

1025
00:54:08,971 --> 00:54:11,160
to work out the solutions and the 
artistic

1026
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,980
product.
The painting is,

1027
00:54:13,981 --> 00:54:16,050
is the byproduct of that,
not the aim.

1028
00:54:16,650 --> 00:54:19,200
And so artists move us forward into the 
unknown.

1029
00:54:19,201 --> 00:54:22,410
And you can see them doing that in 
cities because it's the open people,

1030
00:54:22,411 --> 00:54:25,530
the artists who go into parts of the 
cities that are,

1031
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:26,753
have degenerated to some degree back 
into chaos and then revitalize them and 

1032
00:54:29,881 --> 00:54:30,750
they civilize them.

1033
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:31,583
And then the less artistic people who,
who are more conventional move in and 

1034
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:37,193
you know,
that's when you get gentrification and 

1035
00:54:38,131 --> 00:54:38,964
that sort of thing.
And that usually chases the artists out 

1036
00:54:40,441 --> 00:54:41,274
and they go somewhere else cheap and 
interesting and start the renewal 

1037
00:54:43,441 --> 00:54:46,410
process again.
So the thing about artists,

1038
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:49,740
and it's a hard thing to balance 
property in our culture,

1039
00:54:49,741 --> 00:54:52,920
is that artists are unbelievably 
productive economically,

1040
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,113
but it's very,
very hard for them to monetize their 

1041
00:54:56,161 --> 00:54:56,994
productivity.
So even though what they produce can be 

1042
00:54:58,801 --> 00:55:00,730
of incalculable value,
um,

1043
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:01,883
it's very difficult for them to get any 
of the economic value that they're 

1044
00:55:05,551 --> 00:55:09,350
produced actually directed towards them.
It's a major problem in,

1045
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:10,293
and it's a major problem with trade 
openness as a mode of being in the 

1046
00:55:12,781 --> 00:55:13,614
world.
So it's postmodernism is destructive in 

1047
00:55:17,191 --> 00:55:18,024
this realm as it is in politics.
Postmodernism is perhaps equally 

1048
00:55:21,571 --> 00:55:24,120
destructive in all realms as far as I 
can tell,

1049
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:25,390
especially when it's allowed.

1050
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,540
But with neo Marxism and those two 
things,

1051
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,700
there's no reason they should go hand in
hand.

1052
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:31,890
You know,
because if you're a postmodernist,

1053
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:37,190
there's absolutely no reason stemming 
from your own philosophy that you should

1054
00:55:37,231 --> 00:55:39,810
ally yourself with a new Marxist 
political outlook.

1055
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:40,823
And the fact that those two things are 
found together almost inevitably 

1056
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:45,383
indicates to me that postmodernism is 
the handmaiden of the Neo Marxists 

1057
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:52,920
rather than the other way around.
So in in fact,

1058
00:55:52,921 --> 00:55:53,754
postmodernism is the intellectual front 
that the Neo Marxists where or adopt to 

1059
00:55:58,231 --> 00:56:01,290
hide from themselves and other people 
their true motivations,

1060
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:05,300
which are mostly driven by revenge and,
and resentment and,

1061
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:09,660
and the desire to destroy and a hatred 
for quality and a hatred for qualitative

1062
00:56:09,661 --> 00:56:11,490
distinctions,
which is dead.

1063
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:13,620
It's death.
I mean with young people,

1064
00:56:13,621 --> 00:56:15,090
you want to say,
look,

1065
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:16,223
there's not much to,
you're only 20 and you're kind of 

1066
00:56:17,251 --> 00:56:18,084
useless.

1067
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,150
But that's because you're only 20 you 
know,

1068
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:22,470
that doesn't mean you're not full of 
potential.

1069
00:56:22,471 --> 00:56:23,304
That potential needs to manifest itself 
so that you can turn into something 

1070
00:56:25,661 --> 00:56:27,100
that's it's of,
of,

1071
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:29,950
of,
of world beating significance.

1072
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:33,850
But in order to tell a young person that
credibly you have to say,

1073
00:56:33,851 --> 00:56:34,684
look,
there are true qualitative distinctions 

1074
00:56:35,711 --> 00:56:38,020
between things and you're just getting 
started.

1075
00:56:38,021 --> 00:56:42,760
There are highlights that you can ascend
to that are genuinely high,

1076
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:45,520
which also means they're above where you
are now,

1077
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:48,550
but that gives your life the fact that 
there are those things to pursue,

1078
00:56:48,551 --> 00:56:52,060
gives your life deep meaning and 
significance and gives your struggle.

1079
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,960
Nobility and validity and the 
postmodernist,

1080
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:56,823
Neil Marxist as far as I'm concerned,
are absolute enemies of qualitative 

1081
00:56:59,381 --> 00:57:02,650
distinctions and so what they do is 
destroy everyone's ambition.

1082
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:06,010
It's like we're all already as valuable 
as we're going to get.

1083
00:57:06,011 --> 00:57:06,641
It's like,
okay,

1084
00:57:06,641 --> 00:57:07,960
well fine,
that's good.

1085
00:57:07,961 --> 00:57:09,460
We don't have to feel bad about 
ourselves,

1086
00:57:09,461 --> 00:57:10,294
but what the hell are we going to do?
What are we going to orient ourselves 

1087
00:57:12,941 --> 00:57:16,210
towards?
What we want is multiple hierarchies,

1088
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,660
multiple steep hierarchies of competence
that are open in,

1089
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:20,763
in fair competition to everyone.
And if we don't have enough hierarchies 

1090
00:57:24,521 --> 00:57:25,354
of competence for everyone,
then you know it's up to the creative 

1091
00:57:27,581 --> 00:57:30,790
people to produce some new ones.
It's not like we'll necessarily run out.

1092
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:32,283
So.

1093
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,393
All right.

1094
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:39,543
Have you ever had to tell someone that 
they are best suited to a subservient 

1095
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:46,030
slash blue collar lifestyle because they
don't have any semblance of brilliance?

1096
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,073
Okay.
Well I want to take issue with the 

1097
00:57:48,011 --> 00:57:48,844
formulation of that question,
although I think it's a perfectly 

1098
00:57:50,501 --> 00:57:52,930
reasonable question.
That's Gen Swan.

1099
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:56,920
Don't be thinking that a blue collar 
lifestyle is necessarily subservient.

1100
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:58,150
I mean,
first of all,

1101
00:57:58,151 --> 00:57:58,984
you can be a trades person and now it's 
a really good career choice as far as 

1102
00:58:01,661 --> 00:58:03,070
I'm concerned.
It's very,

1103
00:58:03,071 --> 00:58:04,450
very valuable.
I mean,

1104
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:05,643
you know,
good plumbers are rare and good 

1105
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:10,870
carpenters are rare and good bricklayers
are rare and they're so useful.

1106
00:58:10,871 --> 00:58:12,460
I mean,
I do a lot of renovation work.

1107
00:58:12,461 --> 00:58:15,040
I've done an awful lot of renovation 
work on all the places that I've,

1108
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:15,993
I've lived in and I've learned to do a 
fair bit of construction and automotive 

1109
00:58:18,641 --> 00:58:20,230
body work and all those sorts of things.

1110
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:22,510
And I really liked doing it.
And you know,

1111
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:23,463
there's,
they're blue collar life is not 

1112
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:25,983
necessarily subservient at all because 
you can be master of your trades domain 

1113
00:58:29,111 --> 00:58:29,944
and be unbelievably economically useful 
and productive and creative and 

1114
00:58:32,951 --> 00:58:35,610
independent and autonomous.
And so there's,

1115
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:38,170
there's nothing necessarily subservient 
about that.

1116
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:39,910
Um,
now,

1117
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:41,380
you know,
if you're thinking more about,

1118
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:42,333
about,
let's say life at the low end of a 

1119
00:58:43,841 --> 00:58:45,130
restaurant,
but even there,

1120
00:58:45,131 --> 00:58:48,340
if you're a conscientious person and 
you're careful and you,

1121
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,233
and you're awake and you treat the 
people around you well and you do your 

1122
00:58:52,601 --> 00:58:55,000
job properly,
there's also room for advancement in the

1123
00:58:55,001 --> 00:58:55,834
private sphere.
There's no reason to assume whatsoever 

1124
00:58:57,851 --> 00:58:58,684
that merely because you don't have the 
intellectual horsepower to work well in 

1125
00:59:03,611 --> 00:59:04,660
the ABS,
in the,

1126
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:09,640
in the domain of rapidly shifting 
abstractions that your life has to be of

1127
00:59:09,641 --> 00:59:12,160
secondary quality or,
or,

1128
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:13,090
or opportunity.

1129
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:14,440
I don't see that at all.
And,

1130
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:17,440
and there is endless opportunity in the 
trades and,

1131
00:59:17,441 --> 00:59:19,420
and like in,
in Toronto for example,

1132
00:59:19,421 --> 00:59:20,254
there's a chronic shortage of,
and there's always a shortage of 

1133
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:27,500
qualified people for every occupation.
So,

1134
00:59:27,501 --> 00:59:28,334
um,
if I have to tell someone that they're 

1135
00:59:29,991 --> 00:59:33,680
best suited to a blue collar lifestyle,
I wouldn't feel bad about it.

1136
00:59:33,681 --> 00:59:34,550
I might say to them,
well,

1137
00:59:34,551 --> 00:59:35,101
look,
you know,

1138
00:59:35,101 --> 00:59:35,934
um,
you,

1139
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:36,893
you know,
let's assume you're talking to someone 

1140
00:59:37,761 --> 00:59:38,594
who has an Iq of a hundred,
which is the Iq of the average high 

1141
00:59:40,641 --> 00:59:42,590
school graduate.
You might say,

1142
00:59:42,591 --> 00:59:42,951
well,
look,

1143
00:59:42,951 --> 00:59:44,240
you know,
um,

1144
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:46,960
less you're super conscientious,
uh,

1145
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,280
uh,
career in something like law is probably

1146
00:59:49,281 --> 00:59:52,490
not your best bet because you're going 
to be competing with people who have iqs

1147
00:59:52,491 --> 00:59:54,440
that are like 30 points higher than 
yours,

1148
00:59:54,441 --> 00:59:55,274
or 25 points higher than yours.
And if you really work yourself to 

1149
00:59:57,831 --> 00:59:58,664
death,
you might be able to main maintain 

1150
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,704
competitiveness in that domain,
but you're going to be working at a 

1151
01:00:02,481 --> 01:00:05,090
powerful disadvantage because the people
that you're competing with,

1152
01:00:05,091 --> 01:00:05,924
for example,
are going to be way faster than you 

1153
01:00:07,101 --> 01:00:07,790
verbally.

1154
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:11,120
They're gonna be able to read faster and
to reason verbally faster,

1155
01:00:11,121 --> 01:00:12,170
and,
and all of that.

1156
01:00:12,171 --> 01:00:15,140
And it might be better to pick up,
uh,

1157
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:16,570
uh,
an ambition.

1158
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:17,404
It's more in keeping with the quality of
your temperament and your intelligence 

1159
01:00:20,931 --> 01:00:23,060
to,
to put it bluntly so that you can be,

1160
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:25,460
but that doesn't mean that your success 
has to be limited.

1161
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:26,743
And it,
it also doesn't mean that I'm in ve 

1162
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:28,813
elevating intelligence to do a platform 
of the ultimate moral ideal because the 

1163
01:00:33,441 --> 01:00:36,740
relationship between intelligence and 
moral ideal is zero.

1164
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:39,170
There is no relationship between them at
all.

1165
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:40,370
Intelligence is,
uh,

1166
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:41,443
is our capacity,
let's say that can be put to ill use 

1167
01:00:44,871 --> 01:00:48,200
just as well as to good use.
And there's nothing intrinsically better

1168
01:00:48,201 --> 01:00:49,034
about smart people.
They might be more useful for certain 

1169
01:00:51,201 --> 01:00:53,270
things if they're oriented towards the 
good,

1170
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:54,740
but,
um,

1171
01:00:55,010 --> 01:00:55,843
there's absolutely,
there's no shortage of opportunity in 

1172
01:00:58,491 --> 01:01:01,700
the working class end of the end of the 
world.

1173
01:01:01,701 --> 01:01:05,120
And I can certainly understand often why
people might prefer that too.

1174
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:10,480
To the endless,
my asthma,

1175
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:14,400
you might say chaotic Miasma of complex 
abstract jobs.

1176
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:17,490
One of the problems with those sorts of 
jobs is that you're never done.

1177
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:18,863
It never finished.
There's always more work than you can 

1178
01:01:20,401 --> 01:01:23,400
possibly do.
So all right,

1179
01:01:23,401 --> 01:01:25,410
so that's a good one.
Let's see here.

1180
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:27,313
MMM.

1181
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:31,200
I feel sensitive to meme culture.
Slash irony.

1182
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:36,030
It seems hard to act out honesty when 
every facet of human behavior has turned

1183
01:01:36,031 --> 01:01:36,864
into a meme.
So I worried people's natural reaction 

1184
01:01:38,821 --> 01:01:40,920
will be to mock or scoff.
Well,

1185
01:01:41,310 --> 01:01:43,830
you know,
I've been the target of my fair share of

1186
01:01:43,831 --> 01:01:44,664
memes,
um,

1187
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:48,120
perhaps more than my fair share.
And I actually find it extremely,

1188
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:51,450
I'm really happy about it.
And part of the reason for that

1189
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:56,070
involves some of the elements of our 
earlier discussion.

1190
01:01:56,071 --> 01:01:57,450
People were saying,
well,

1191
01:01:57,451 --> 01:01:59,580
how do you plan to keep your feet on the
ground,

1192
01:01:59,610 --> 01:02:01,860
say,
given your new phone public,

1193
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,380
um,
um,

1194
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:07,020
pr profile.
And I see the,

1195
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:10,770
the meme culture as part of the 
corrective.

1196
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:11,633
I mean,
there's a great role for satire and 

1197
01:02:13,621 --> 01:02:16,590
irony and all of the elements of comedy 
to,

1198
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:19,530
to act as a corrective.
And I mean,

1199
01:02:19,531 --> 01:02:20,364
I've been fortunate because most of the 
memes that have been directed my way 

1200
01:02:22,921 --> 01:02:25,320
have been done with good humor.

1201
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:26,483
I'm lucky because for some reason the 
ratio of positive attention I received 

1202
01:02:33,121 --> 01:02:35,820
from the general public,
let's say,

1203
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:37,163
is compared to the ratio to the amount 
of negative reactions I'm receiving is 

1204
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:42,924
very disproportionate.
I receiving almost all positive 

1205
01:02:44,611 --> 01:02:45,630
reactions.
So,

1206
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:46,643
you know,
I'm in the fortunate position of being 

1207
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:48,930
able to allow for long with it.
But,

1208
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:52,140
um,
I don't think that there's any reason to

1209
01:02:52,141 --> 01:02:55,560
assume that irony and satire have to 
become cruel and scoffing.

1210
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:57,143
They can be done with a light touch and 
they can be done in a manner that keeps 

1211
01:03:00,601 --> 01:03:05,370
everybody awake and make sure that no 
one is above

1212
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:07,500
okay.

1213
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,240
Both criticism and,
and,

1214
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:10,343
and humor that they're now,
that sort of thing can become cynical 

1215
01:03:16,471 --> 01:03:17,304
very rapidly,
but it degenerate as soon as it becomes 

1216
01:03:19,771 --> 01:03:21,930
cynical.
You see this with satirical shows,

1217
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:22,620
you know,
like,

1218
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:25,620
I really liked the simpsons,
the first 13 seasons in particular,

1219
01:03:25,621 --> 01:03:28,530
and like it,
it was one of the very rare,

1220
01:03:28,531 --> 01:03:29,364
true satires on American television.
And it never degenerated into cynicism 

1221
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:33,803
in part because although it comedically 
critiqued almost every element of 

1222
01:03:39,661 --> 01:03:41,700
American life,
it was also,

1223
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:45,270
it also had a set of messages that were 
very positive.

1224
01:03:45,271 --> 01:03:46,104
So for example,
the Simpson family was an 

1225
01:03:47,191 --> 01:03:48,024
extraordinarily coherent nuclear family 
unit and for whatever homer's faults 

1226
01:03:51,991 --> 01:03:53,490
might've been,
and they were myriad,

1227
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:58,590
he was always there as a reliable and 
trustworthy a father to his family,

1228
01:03:58,591 --> 01:04:00,360
despite his,
you know,

1229
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,630
somewhat limited abilities,
both ethically and intellectually.

1230
01:04:03,870 --> 01:04:04,703
He was there when it counted.
And that stopped that show from 

1231
01:04:07,381 --> 01:04:10,230
degenerating into cynicism.
And I also think the same boat,

1232
01:04:10,231 --> 01:04:11,064
the trailer park boys,
which is a show that I have a fair bit 

1233
01:04:13,651 --> 01:04:15,210
of partiality four,
despite its,

1234
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:18,660
it's endless profanity and,
and an absurdity,

1235
01:04:19,170 --> 01:04:20,003
it has the same underlying structure is 
that the characters are bound together 

1236
01:04:24,031 --> 01:04:24,864
by genuine affection.
And there's something about that that 

1237
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:30,650
that makes the satirical message,
um,

1238
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:33,960
both positive and deeply acceptable as 
far as I'm concerned.

1239
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:35,213
So

1240
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,790
I know lots of laughs.
Jordan watches trailer park boys.

1241
01:04:44,791 --> 01:04:46,650
I don't just watch it.
I really like it.

1242
01:04:46,651 --> 01:04:49,230
I really get a kick out of it.
I don't know how many of you are trailer

1243
01:04:49,231 --> 01:04:50,064
Park Boys Aficionados?
Probably not that many because it is a 

1244
01:04:51,961 --> 01:04:53,910
pretty rough schilt.
But um,

1245
01:04:54,450 --> 01:04:56,700
the conky episode,
that's gotta be one of the,

1246
01:04:57,170 --> 01:04:58,740
the high,
that's one of the highest.

1247
01:04:58,950 --> 01:04:59,783
That's the,
the highest reach of Canadian comedy as 

1248
01:05:01,651 --> 01:05:04,470
far as I'm concerned.
That episode just absolutely floored me.

1249
01:05:04,471 --> 01:05:07,210
It was so,
it was so surreal and so observed that,

1250
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:10,370
um,
alright.

1251
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:11,460
Let's see here.

1252
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:23,013
What are,
is your advice for someone who lives 

1253
01:05:24,491 --> 01:05:26,440
with chronic pain?
Wow,

1254
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:27,303
that's a tough one.
How can I discipline myself mentally in 

1255
01:05:29,051 --> 01:05:31,570
order to be productive when I feel awful
all of the time?

1256
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:34,390
What coping methods cannot use?
Look,

1257
01:05:34,391 --> 01:05:37,060
the first thing I would say,
this is a question posed by shivers,

1258
01:05:37,061 --> 01:05:39,370
is like,
if you're suffering chronic pain,

1259
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:42,970
one of the things you can do is try not 
to judge yourself too harshly.

1260
01:05:42,971 --> 01:05:44,350
Man,
that's really rough.

1261
01:05:44,351 --> 01:05:45,184
And why don't you start by assuming that
if you're having a hard time 

1262
01:05:47,831 --> 01:05:48,664
disciplining yourself,
that it's actually a consequence of the 

1263
01:05:50,441 --> 01:05:53,200
chronic pain rather than a moral fault.
You know,

1264
01:05:53,201 --> 01:05:54,034
like I've dealt with lots of people 
who've had terrible chronic health 

1265
01:05:56,111 --> 01:05:58,240
problems and you know,
you,

1266
01:05:58,450 --> 01:05:59,170
you,
you,

1267
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:00,003
you want to push yourself because you 
don't want to end up in a situation 

1268
01:06:04,421 --> 01:06:05,254
where the disease condition is taking 
more away from you than it absolutely 

1269
01:06:10,331 --> 01:06:10,870
has to.

1270
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:11,703
So you attempt to impose minimal 
disciplinary structures on yourself too 

1271
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:17,770
to push the illness back as much as you 
can.

1272
01:06:17,771 --> 01:06:20,260
But if you're in chronic pain,
I would say,

1273
01:06:20,530 --> 01:06:21,363
um,
you need to find someone that you can 

1274
01:06:23,891 --> 01:06:26,440
trust to talk to so that they can help 
you plan.

1275
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:27,903
And you need to be able to delineate out
what your limitations are in a manner 

1276
01:06:31,331 --> 01:06:32,164
that they can understand so that you can
jointly focus on how to make productive 

1277
01:06:36,941 --> 01:06:37,774
use and high quality use of the time 
that you can actually spend outside of 

1278
01:06:41,741 --> 01:06:42,574
merely suffering.
The other thing that I would ask you 

1279
01:06:44,111 --> 01:06:44,944
about is,
are you sure that your medication 

1280
01:06:46,571 --> 01:06:51,190
regimen regimen is adjusted optimally?
Because antidepressants,

1281
01:06:51,191 --> 01:06:52,024
for example,
can be very effective long term 

1282
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:57,460
medication for chronic pain,
especially,

1283
01:06:57,500 --> 01:06:59,460
uh,
drugs like Celexa w.

1284
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:00,453
So,
I don't know if you use an 

1285
01:07:01,361 --> 01:07:03,910
antidepressant in your attempts to 
manage your chronic pain,

1286
01:07:03,911 --> 01:07:05,890
but that's something I would definitely 
recommend.

1287
01:07:05,890 --> 01:07:09,460
And there was a lot of pharmaceutical 
treatment and you know,

1288
01:07:09,461 --> 01:07:10,294
you may have run the gamut already.
I know lots of people who have chronic 

1289
01:07:12,431 --> 01:07:13,510
pain have done that,
but,

1290
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:17,200
and also stimulants,
like the adhd medications,

1291
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:19,540
um,
can also be helpful in the management of

1292
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:22,260
pain because stimulant medication,
um,

1293
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:26,530
has an analgesic properties.
So you might want to consult a number of

1294
01:07:26,531 --> 01:07:27,364
specialists about your medication 
regimen to see that you're medicated to 

1295
01:07:30,761 --> 01:07:31,594
the optimal degree.
But I would definitely recommend 

1296
01:07:32,891 --> 01:07:36,970
antidepressants and also find and,
and talking to someone,

1297
01:07:36,971 --> 01:07:37,804
find someone you can trust so that you 
can talk to him about your genuine 

1298
01:07:41,261 --> 01:07:43,150
limitations and how you might transcend 
them.

1299
01:07:43,151 --> 01:07:43,984
And,
and also see if you can not torture 

1300
01:07:45,851 --> 01:07:46,684
yourself with guilt because you aren't 
able to live the productive life that 

1301
01:07:50,651 --> 01:07:52,330
someone who's free of chronic pain 
might.

1302
01:07:52,331 --> 01:07:54,280
I mean,
it can be unbelievably debilitating.

1303
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,113
So mostly a while.
So I'm very sorry to hear that that's 

1304
01:07:58,811 --> 01:07:59,644
plaguing you.
And,

1305
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:00,653
and,
uh,

1306
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:04,930
when you say,
how can I discipline myself?

1307
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:08,620
I'm sorry,
I'm afraid I've lost the question.

1308
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:09,933
You said,
how can I discipline myself at 

1309
01:08:10,871 --> 01:08:11,704
something?
Like how can I discipline myself when 

1310
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,710
I'm in chronic pain?
It's like,

1311
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:16,003
well,
I think a more appropriate question 

1312
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,513
might be how can you ensure you that you
treat yourself with the appropriate 

1313
01:08:26,301 --> 01:08:27,134
compassion if you happen to be living 
with severe chronic pain and maybe the 

1314
01:08:30,651 --> 01:08:32,810
disciplinary element should be 
secondary.

1315
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:34,910
It's something like that.
So

1316
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:44,940
I'm getting tired guy,
so I'm probably gonna stop at nine.

1317
01:08:45,090 --> 01:08:45,923
I'm going to stop at nine 30 because I'm
going to start becoming incoherent if I 

1318
01:08:48,691 --> 01:08:50,370
don't.
So just to give you a warning,

1319
01:08:50,371 --> 01:08:51,204
we're going to,
we're going to run this for 15 more 

1320
01:08:52,501 --> 01:08:56,670
minutes.
So is joining the military a respectable

1321
01:08:56,760 --> 01:09:00,840
path for my life.
While I would say it would likely depend

1322
01:09:00,841 --> 01:09:05,460
on how you conduct yourself as a soldier
it and also what your alternatives are.

1323
01:09:05,461 --> 01:09:06,294
But I wouldn't,
so I wouldn't say yes without 

1324
01:09:08,071 --> 01:09:08,904
reservation,
but I certainly wouldn't say no without 

1325
01:09:10,261 --> 01:09:11,094
reservation.
I think joining the military can be a 

1326
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:15,390
respectable pathway for your life.
I mean,

1327
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:17,370
it's obviously a complex pathway,
but,

1328
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:20,250
um,
it's,

1329
01:09:20,251 --> 01:09:22,890
it's not like the military isn't a 
necessity.

1330
01:09:22,891 --> 01:09:25,920
And so if there's something in you that 
tilts you in that direction,

1331
01:09:25,921 --> 01:09:27,070
then,
um,

1332
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:30,540
perhaps that's courage in Utah.
That's certainly possible.

1333
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:31,433
So,

1334
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:35,220
um,
let's see.

1335
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,260
Let's go back to the pigeon hole thing 
here.

1336
01:09:47,610 --> 01:09:51,150
Becoming a truthful person involves 
dealing with the guilt of past lives.

1337
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:52,013
Is it better to come clean about old 
lies even if they will ruin lives or 

1338
01:09:54,541 --> 01:09:58,200
forgive yourself and focus on living 
truthfully in the present and future?

1339
01:09:58,650 --> 01:10:00,450
Uh,
that's a,

1340
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,060
that's a really good question.
Um,

1341
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:06,780
I would say that there,
there are

1342
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:11,083
telling the truth doesn't mean saying 
everything about everything all the 

1343
01:10:16,431 --> 01:10:18,950
time.
It's a lot more complicated than that.

1344
01:10:18,951 --> 01:10:21,050
First of all,
you have a right to privacy.

1345
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:22,280
And second,
like,

1346
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,290
here's an example.
This is a tricky one,

1347
01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:27,140
but I think it would address your 
question.

1348
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:30,590
Imagine that you've had an affair,
you have a happy marriage,

1349
01:10:30,591 --> 01:10:31,424
but you had an affair and maybe you had 
an affair three years ago and maybe it 

1350
01:10:33,951 --> 01:10:34,551
was,
you know,

1351
01:10:34,551 --> 01:10:35,384
a couple of weeks or a couple of months 
or maybe it was even only one night and 

1352
01:10:38,181 --> 01:10:40,970
it's driving you crazy,
you're guilty about it and you feel that

1353
01:10:40,971 --> 01:10:43,100
you should confess.
And I would say,

1354
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:47,300
well the first question is have you 
learned your lesson?

1355
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:53,260
And the lesson should be you've 
processed what you've done and decreased

1356
01:10:53,421 --> 01:10:54,254
the probability that you will do it 
again to something as closely 

1357
01:10:57,021 --> 01:10:57,854
approximating zero as possible.
And then you have to ask yourself what 

1358
01:11:01,461 --> 01:11:04,400
makes you think that you have any right 
to confess?

1359
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:08,960
Because then what you would do is take 
the original transgression,

1360
01:11:08,961 --> 01:11:13,830
which was quite severe and hurt someone 
very badly revealing it.

1361
01:11:13,831 --> 01:11:14,664
And you might say,
well you pat yourself on the back for 

1362
01:11:15,991 --> 01:11:16,824
being a truthful person about it.
But I would say you've already 

1363
01:11:18,871 --> 01:11:23,130
sacrificed the right.
You have to be truthful about that.

1364
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:24,583
And,
and I know I'm over simplifying it 

1365
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:30,600
because the only way to not oversimplify
is such a thing is to use a real example

1366
01:11:30,601 --> 01:11:31,434
and not a hypothetical example,
but I think many times the moral thing 

1367
01:11:34,711 --> 01:11:37,860
to do is to take your guilty secrets to 
the grave.

1368
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:39,893
And maybe you can talk about them with a
therapist or you can talk about them 

1369
01:11:42,751 --> 01:11:45,420
with someone that you really trust,
who will maintain confidentiality.

1370
01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:46,320
But,
um,

1371
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:48,203
you don't come clean about old lives.
You're not coming clean about old lies 

1372
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,540
generally,
if that will ruin lives.

1373
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:58,290
And I don't think you,
you forgive yourself precisely and focus

1374
01:11:58,291 --> 01:11:59,124
on living truthfully in the future.
You focus on living truthfully in the 

1375
01:12:01,891 --> 01:12:04,200
future.
And perhaps you don't forgive yourself.

1376
01:12:04,201 --> 01:12:05,034
Exactly.
That doesn't mean you pound yourself 

1377
01:12:06,241 --> 01:12:07,074
into the ground with guilt.
But if you have done things in the past 

1378
01:12:09,511 --> 01:12:12,240
that were reprehensible and that would 
destroy lives,

1379
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:15,270
if we're brought to light,
then you should.

1380
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,333
I think that generally speaking,
you should do everything you can to 

1381
01:12:20,071 --> 01:12:20,904
limit the spread of damage as you 
attempt to move truthfully into the 

1382
01:12:24,601 --> 01:12:26,040
future.
So,

1383
01:12:27,570 --> 01:12:28,403
um,
you've said that a marriage must be 

1384
01:12:29,581 --> 01:12:32,460
based on trust and transparency and 
being shackled together.

1385
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:33,533
How,
and for how long should you get to know 

1386
01:12:35,371 --> 01:12:37,320
someone?
How does set a foundation?

1387
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:38,250
Oh,
well,

1388
01:12:38,250 --> 01:12:39,570
you know,
there's no,

1389
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,910
there's no simple answer to that.

1390
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:43,970
Um,
hello.

1391
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:54,990
I think that you should know someone 
well enough so that you can

1392
01:12:57,810 --> 01:12:58,643
so that you know if you can negotiate 
with them and so that you have started 

1393
01:13:02,221 --> 01:13:06,210
to formulate a vision of your joint 
future that you can both

1394
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:12,290
look forward to with enthusiasm and 
confidence.

1395
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,013
So,
and of course that's going to depend to 

1396
01:13:15,591 --> 01:13:16,424
some degree on your level of maturity,
but that means you've considered such 

1397
01:13:20,571 --> 01:13:24,830
things as,
do you have a sufficient number of joint

1398
01:13:24,831 --> 01:13:25,664
interests and are you oriented in the 
same direction with regards to how 

1399
01:13:28,941 --> 01:13:29,774
you're going to handle your joint 
careers and the possibility of children 

1400
01:13:32,211 --> 01:13:33,044
and that the manner in which you're 
going to interact with your in laws and 

1401
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:39,830
you have to start thinking about,
you have to start

1402
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:42,523
considering your life together from the 
perspective of practicality and 

1403
01:13:45,651 --> 01:13:47,030
economics,
I would say.

1404
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:48,133
So it can't just be that massive erotic 
attraction that's associated with with 

1405
01:13:53,511 --> 01:13:54,344
love.
Although I think that's extraordinarily 

1406
01:13:55,491 --> 01:13:56,324
important and you're unbelievably 
fortunate if you have that and you 

1407
01:13:58,251 --> 01:14:00,020
should do everything you can to maintain
it,

1408
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:03,110
which and at that takes effort that 
takes real effort and will,

1409
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:04,273
but you need to ally that with with 
maturity and intelligence and the 

1410
01:14:08,391 --> 01:14:09,950
maturity and intelligence is,
okay,

1411
01:14:09,951 --> 01:14:12,100
we're going to put our lives together.
What's

1412
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:14,530
that going to look like at the level of 
detail?

1413
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:17,530
How are we going to handle our finances?
Where are we going to live?

1414
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:20,020
Um,
what are our joint plans going to be?

1415
01:14:20,021 --> 01:14:20,854
It's et cetera.
One of the things that my business 

1416
01:14:23,141 --> 01:14:26,890
partners and I plan to do in,
in,

1417
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,233
what would you say that in a as an 
analog to the self authoring suite is 

1418
01:14:32,441 --> 01:14:33,274
that we want to develop an online 
program to help people negotiate their 

1419
01:14:37,391 --> 01:14:38,224
relationships and,
and so it would actually provide an 

1420
01:14:41,141 --> 01:14:45,400
answer to this question in a more 
comprehensive manner is that you imagine

1421
01:14:45,401 --> 01:14:47,500
that if you want to set up a household 
with someone,

1422
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:51,430
then there's a lot of things that you 
need to get straight.

1423
01:14:51,431 --> 01:14:52,264
And you either do that by bringing your 
unconscious assumptions to bear on the 

1424
01:14:55,721 --> 01:14:56,554
situation and perhaps clashing where 
they don't match or you sit down like a 

1425
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:02,463
conscious and aware and articulate 
couple and start to negotiate what your 

1426
01:15:06,611 --> 01:15:08,410
joint responsibilities are going to be.

1427
01:15:08,410 --> 01:15:13,410
And so that would be well,
who's responsible for the meals and when

1428
01:15:13,781 --> 01:15:14,614
and what are you going to eat and who's 
going to get groceries and who's going 

1429
01:15:16,631 --> 01:15:17,464
to pay the bills and who's going to do 
which part of what household chores 

1430
01:15:20,861 --> 01:15:23,110
there are to do and how is that going to
be laid out?

1431
01:15:23,111 --> 01:15:26,290
Fair.
And so you should get to know,

1432
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:27,423
you should get to know the person that 
you're with well enough so that you can 

1433
01:15:31,331 --> 01:15:32,164
start discussing the real practical 
issues of life and determine whether or 

1434
01:15:36,161 --> 01:15:39,160
not you're capable of of negotiating 
that.

1435
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:40,023
And I don't think that necessarily means
that you should live together because 

1436
01:15:43,481 --> 01:15:44,314
the evidence is actually quite strong.
At least the last time I looked at 

1437
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:52,150
people who live together are more rather
than less likely to be divorced.

1438
01:15:52,270 --> 01:15:53,103
Now that might be,
that might have nothing to do with the 

1439
01:15:54,491 --> 01:15:55,900
actual act of living together.

1440
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:59,380
It might be that people who are more 
likely to get divorced or also those who

1441
01:15:59,381 --> 01:16:00,214
are more likely to merely live together.
But I don't think that's a great 

1442
01:16:02,381 --> 01:16:05,800
solution for reasons I won't get to go 
get into now.

1443
01:16:06,190 --> 01:16:08,980
And with regards to being shackled 
together is that,

1444
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:11,010
that's a complicated one.
And,

1445
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:15,190
and I learned this at least in part from
reading Carl Young and the idea there is

1446
01:16:15,191 --> 01:16:16,024
that unless you've really made a 
commitment to someone like a lifetime 

1447
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:23,140
commitment and that that's a serious 
commitment,

1448
01:16:23,141 --> 01:16:24,900
one that you're not going to back out 
of,

1449
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:28,450
you're not going to take the 
relationship with the seriousness that's

1450
01:16:28,451 --> 01:16:29,284
necessary to make it have the highest 
possible quality and sustainability 

1451
01:16:32,861 --> 01:16:33,694
across the course of your life.
And it's really important that it is of 

1452
01:16:36,161 --> 01:16:39,220
that high quality and sustainability 
because the relationship,

1453
01:16:39,490 --> 01:16:41,500
especially when it starts to produce 
children,

1454
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:43,090
is a,
a machine,

1455
01:16:43,091 --> 01:16:43,924
let's say a machine that you jointly 
operate that adds immensely to the 

1456
01:16:47,051 --> 01:16:49,240
quality of your life and the depth of 
your life.

1457
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:50,523
I mean you,
you have the rope and strand of your 

1458
01:16:52,931 --> 01:16:56,890
life and your partner has the strands in
the rope of his or her life.

1459
01:16:56,891 --> 01:16:59,800
And then those are tied together to make
a stronger rope.

1460
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:01,023
And then that unites you across time.
And then you undertake massive 

1461
01:17:04,481 --> 01:17:07,360
adventures together.
And some of that is the establishment of

1462
01:17:07,361 --> 01:17:10,100
a household and the establishment of 
joint careers and

1463
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:10,933
the maintenance of each other's mental 
and physical health and the maintenance 

1464
01:17:13,491 --> 01:17:15,740
of a high quality sexual life and all of
that.

1465
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,750
Very,
very challenging to do all of that.

1466
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:22,730
And then the joint production end and 
care of children,

1467
01:17:22,731 --> 01:17:23,564
which,
which sets you up properly for the last 

1468
01:17:25,611 --> 01:17:26,630
half of your life.
So like,

1469
01:17:26,631 --> 01:17:28,010
I'm 55 now,
you know,

1470
01:17:28,011 --> 01:17:28,844
and um,
both my kids just got engaged in the 

1471
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:33,620
last month,
so that's pretty bloody amazing.

1472
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:36,380
And they're both setting up households 
and um,

1473
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:40,730
and there are stepping into adulthood 
and I'm fortunate enough to have them in

1474
01:17:40,731 --> 01:17:43,070
the city that I live in.
So Hooray for me,

1475
01:17:43,071 --> 01:17:44,430
that's so bloody,
uh,

1476
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:46,520
fortunate that I can hardly believe it.
I mean,

1477
01:17:46,521 --> 01:17:48,230
we've helped them out and tried to make 
it.

1478
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:49,613
Um,
what would you say to make the 

1479
01:17:52,161 --> 01:17:55,100
possibility of their living here be 
something that's viable?

1480
01:17:55,101 --> 01:17:55,934
But I'm absolutely thrilled that they're
going to be around and I'm looking 

1481
01:17:57,831 --> 01:18:01,370
forward immensely to having 
grandchildren and like,

1482
01:18:01,371 --> 01:18:04,160
what else are you going to do when 
you're 55,

1483
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:06,170
you know,
when you're going to be 55,

1484
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,210
it's going to,
I might have 40 more years.

1485
01:18:08,210 --> 01:18:10,340
Like,
what am I going to do with those years?

1486
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,110
Well,
so I have a good marriage,

1487
01:18:12,111 --> 01:18:15,470
thank God for that.
And that's partly due to the outstanding

1488
01:18:15,471 --> 01:18:17,300
moral quality of my life.
My wife,

1489
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:19,550
who I'm also extraordinarily attracted 
to.

1490
01:18:19,940 --> 01:18:20,773
And,
uh,

1491
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:21,643
you know,
we've built a life together and we've 

1492
01:18:22,341 --> 01:18:24,410
had kids together and we're happy with 
our kids.

1493
01:18:24,411 --> 01:18:28,010
And we had plenty of,
of struggle with our kids because one of

1494
01:18:28,011 --> 01:18:30,230
our children,
my daughter had serious,

1495
01:18:30,231 --> 01:18:31,064
serious health problems,
which she seems to have managed to 

1496
01:18:33,981 --> 01:18:37,130
resolve partly as a consequence of her 
own brilliance.

1497
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:39,770
Um,
but you know,

1498
01:18:39,771 --> 01:18:40,604
we've set ourselves up now so that our 
children are respectable and mature 

1499
01:18:44,001 --> 01:18:45,950
young adults.
So thank God for that.

1500
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:48,800
And they've got partners who we both 
really like,

1501
01:18:48,801 --> 01:18:51,500
and they're going to have children and 
well,

1502
01:18:51,501 --> 01:18:52,281
Hooray.
You know,

1503
01:18:52,281 --> 01:18:55,580
that means that this next part of my 
life is going to be something that I can

1504
01:18:55,581 --> 01:18:58,550
advance into with a,
with a fair bit of hope and,

1505
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:00,350
and,
and excitement.

1506
01:19:00,350 --> 01:19:02,420
And the idea of having little kids 
around again,

1507
01:19:02,421 --> 01:19:04,430
it's thrilling because I really liked 
the little kids.

1508
01:19:04,431 --> 01:19:05,930
They're really,
really fun.

1509
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:10,220
And so th the shackled together is more 
like,

1510
01:19:10,221 --> 01:19:11,150
it's a,
it's,

1511
01:19:11,230 --> 01:19:12,320
it's,
it's such a,

1512
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:13,393
I may have even said that,
but it's such a cynical way of looking 

1513
01:19:15,141 --> 01:19:15,974
at it.
It's more like what you've produced is 

1514
01:19:16,911 --> 01:19:21,911
an unbreakable bond between two beings 
and that that makes both of them,

1515
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:25,880
both of them better in every way.
If it's based on,

1516
01:19:25,881 --> 01:19:29,000
if it's a relationship that's based on 
trust and genuine communication,

1517
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:30,193
it's very difficult thing to attain 
because you have to be willing to tell 

1518
01:19:32,841 --> 01:19:33,674
the truth.
And the truth is terror generally a 

1519
01:19:34,881 --> 01:19:36,650
horrible thing,
you know?

1520
01:19:36,651 --> 01:19:37,484
I mean,
it's easy to tell truth when everyone 

1521
01:19:38,871 --> 01:19:39,704
wants to hear what you have to say,
but it's very difficult to tell the 

1522
01:19:41,541 --> 01:19:44,540
truth when no one wants to hear it,
least of all yourself.

1523
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:48,980
And so marriage gets a very bad rap in 
our culture and Sodas,

1524
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:50,203
child rearing.
And I think that's absolute catastrophe 

1525
01:19:51,981 --> 01:19:56,600
because really being in a longterm 
relationship,

1526
01:19:56,601 --> 01:19:59,480
a marriage let's say,
and having children,

1527
01:19:59,510 --> 01:20:00,343
that's two thirds of your life.
Even if you're a highly career oriented 

1528
01:20:03,501 --> 01:20:05,420
person,
that's two thirds of your life.

1529
01:20:05,421 --> 01:20:08,220
And I'm a highly career oriented and

1530
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:09,533
my family has been unbelievably 
important to me and has also been 

1531
01:20:12,151 --> 01:20:12,984
something that's enabled me to be very 
effective in my career because my house 

1532
01:20:16,261 --> 01:20:18,630
has been a sanctuary for me.
And thank God for that,

1533
01:20:18,631 --> 01:20:20,670
especially over or many times in my 
life,

1534
01:20:20,671 --> 01:20:23,250
but especially over the last year.
So

1535
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:25,613
you should,
you should get to know someone long 

1536
01:20:27,751 --> 01:20:31,110
enough to know that you two can 
negotiate,

1537
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:34,680
tell the truth with each other,
communicate and negotiate.

1538
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:35,543
Because the most important part of a 
relationship is the fact that you can 

1539
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:38,874
tell each other the truth and negotiate.
So how does it feel to be viewed as a 

1540
01:20:42,661 --> 01:20:44,940
father figure by many people who grew up
without one?

1541
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:46,073
Well,
um,

1542
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:49,260
I think it's an unbelievable honor.
How's that?

1543
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:50,573
And that is really what I think as it 
gets a tremendous honor and I'm doing 

1544
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:57,540
absolutely everything I can to be worthy
of that.

1545
01:20:57,540 --> 01:20:58,373
And I would like to say to all the 
people out there who grew up without a 

1546
01:21:00,901 --> 01:21:03,900
father,
that's really too bad because you need a

1547
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:04,734
father there to encourage you.
That's what fathers do is they 

1548
01:21:07,801 --> 01:21:10,950
encourage,
they help make you courageous.

1549
01:21:11,190 --> 01:21:12,023
And if I can help people develop the 
capacity to be courageous and to learn 

1550
01:21:15,931 --> 01:21:19,200
to tell the truth and to be responsible,
then that's great.

1551
01:21:19,201 --> 01:21:19,880
I,
I,

1552
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:20,713
I can't imagine a better outcome for me.
And so if people are willing to help me 

1553
01:21:24,391 --> 01:21:29,391
play that role and to use what I've been
teaching to guide them in that manner,

1554
01:21:29,431 --> 01:21:30,264
then hooray.
I couldn't possibly imagine a better 

1555
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:34,020
outcome than that.
So

1556
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:39,360
how do you formulate good questions?
Giving that a well,

1557
01:21:39,390 --> 01:21:40,223
given that a well oriented question 
seems often more critical than the 

1558
01:21:42,571 --> 01:21:44,550
answer?
That's a great question by the way.

1559
01:21:44,970 --> 01:21:45,803
Um,
a lot of what you do to formulate good 

1560
01:21:47,491 --> 01:21:48,660
questions is listen.

1561
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:50,213
Like,
if you're engaged in dialogue with 

1562
01:21:51,751 --> 01:21:53,880
someone and you really listen to what 
they're saying,

1563
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:58,710
the all you have to do is notice when 
you don't understand what they're saying

1564
01:21:58,980 --> 01:21:59,813
and then ask them for clarification.
And that's the case when you're dealing 

1565
01:22:02,731 --> 01:22:05,940
with the w the factual world as well,
you know,

1566
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,570
um,
what you do to formulate good questions.

1567
01:22:09,571 --> 01:22:10,404
It is admit your own ignorance to 
yourself and then tried to articulate 

1568
01:22:14,551 --> 01:22:17,640
that ignorance as clearly and simply as 
you possibly can.

1569
01:22:18,150 --> 01:22:18,983
And so I do that all the time when I'm 
in my clinical sessions with people 

1570
01:22:21,211 --> 01:22:25,530
because there'll be telling me the story
of their life years ago perhaps,

1571
01:22:25,531 --> 01:22:27,840
or maybe events over the last few weeks 
or whatever.

1572
01:22:27,841 --> 01:22:28,674
And they'll tell me the story and,
and all detect elements of it that I 

1573
01:22:32,491 --> 01:22:35,940
don't understand or that are unclear or 
that seem self contradictory.

1574
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:37,860
And so then I'll just ask,
it says,

1575
01:22:37,861 --> 01:22:38,430
well,
I don't,

1576
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:40,170
I don't understand what you're saying 
there.

1577
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,660
You said this as far as I can tell,
but that wasn't clear.

1578
01:22:42,661 --> 01:22:45,660
What exactly do you mean?
And so a huge,

1579
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:47,520
and,
and get them to articulate it.

1580
01:22:47,521 --> 01:22:48,690
And maybe I'll say,
well,

1581
01:22:48,691 --> 01:22:50,910
you said this now,
but you said this,

1582
01:22:50,911 --> 01:22:51,960
you know,
10 minutes ago.

1583
01:22:51,961 --> 01:22:54,660
And as far as I can tell,
those two things are opposites.

1584
01:22:54,661 --> 01:22:55,494
And so how do you,
how do you bridge the gap between those 

1585
01:22:59,311 --> 01:23:00,144
things?
And,

1586
01:23:00,270 --> 01:23:01,103
but the critical issue with regards to 
good questions is that you admit to 

1587
01:23:03,961 --> 01:23:06,100
yourself your own ignorance and you're 
not embarrassed

1588
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:06,933
about it.
Like there's nothing wrong with being 

1589
01:23:07,841 --> 01:23:09,580
ignorant.
Well that's not true.

1590
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:12,040
It's a terrible thing to be ignorant,
but it's inevitable.

1591
01:23:12,490 --> 01:23:16,390
But it's not a moral flaw.
It's just unfortunate.

1592
01:23:16,570 --> 01:23:19,570
The moral flaw is in refusing to admit 
to it.

1593
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:21,400
And so,
you know,

1594
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:23,193
the students who do really well in 
classes are the ones who ask basic 

1595
01:23:26,111 --> 01:23:27,550
questions.
They put up their hand and say,

1596
01:23:27,551 --> 01:23:28,270
look,
you know,

1597
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:30,070
everyone else here seems to understand 
this,

1598
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:32,080
but this is a point that I really don't 
get.

1599
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:33,273
And you know,
rarely a person asks a question like 

1600
01:23:35,981 --> 01:23:36,814
that and they haven't been listening and
they haven't been paying attention and 

1601
01:23:39,281 --> 01:23:40,114
they're just being annoying.
But most of the time people who do that 

1602
01:23:43,481 --> 01:23:44,314
have been paying attention and they're 
asking a question that everyone else in 

1603
01:23:46,781 --> 01:23:49,300
the room would also like to ask but is 
embarrassed to do so.

1604
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:51,350
So,
um,

1605
01:23:52,410 --> 01:23:53,243
all right.
You said that positive emotion comes 

1606
01:23:55,631 --> 01:23:56,464
from moving towards a goal,
but also that friends and family are 

1607
01:23:58,181 --> 01:24:00,040
crucial,
critical to a fulfilling life.

1608
01:24:00,041 --> 01:24:02,110
Are both of these hitting the same 
neural circuits?

1609
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:04,330
I would say no,
not precisely.

1610
01:24:04,331 --> 01:24:05,164
The,
the positive emotion that comes from 

1611
01:24:06,551 --> 01:24:09,790
moving towards a goal looks to me to be 
primarily dopaminergic.

1612
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:11,313
And the,
the positive emotion that's associated 

1613
01:24:13,301 --> 01:24:15,790
with friends and family,
I think is much more associated with the

1614
01:24:15,791 --> 01:24:16,624
opiate system.
And some of the best work on that was 

1615
01:24:18,311 --> 01:24:20,380
done by Jaak Panksepp,
j a,

1616
01:24:20,381 --> 01:24:21,670
k,
Panksepp,

1617
01:24:21,671 --> 01:24:22,191
p,
a,

1618
01:24:22,191 --> 01:24:22,701
n,
k,

1619
01:24:22,701 --> 01:24:23,620
s,
Epp.

1620
01:24:23,621 --> 01:24:26,950
And he wrote a book called affective 
neuroscience and a variety of very,

1621
01:24:26,951 --> 01:24:27,784
very good scientific papers and laid 
some of the initial groundwork for 

1622
01:24:30,491 --> 01:24:34,600
understanding the relationship between 
the functioning of the endogenous opiate

1623
01:24:34,601 --> 01:24:37,270
systems and social bonding.
So no,

1624
01:24:37,271 --> 01:24:38,350
I don't think they're the same.

1625
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:39,353
They're,
they share overlap because the opiate 

1626
01:24:40,991 --> 01:24:44,200
circuits can activate the dopaminergic 
circuits.

1627
01:24:44,610 --> 01:24:45,443
Um,
but,

1628
01:24:45,850 --> 01:24:46,683
but there,
there are definitely differences in the 

1629
01:24:48,911 --> 01:24:49,840
system that,
that,

1630
01:24:50,230 --> 01:24:51,063
that seeks out goals.
And that's the system that Panksepp 

1631
01:24:53,231 --> 01:24:54,064
actually called the seeking system.
That's the dopaminergic system and the 

1632
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:57,424
more affiliate of systems.
So there are definitely overlapping but 

1633
01:25:00,161 --> 01:25:01,990
separate neural circuits.
And so,

1634
01:25:02,870 --> 01:25:03,703
um,
I have to take away from your 

1635
01:25:06,971 --> 01:25:08,560
interpretations,
but for a skeptic,

1636
01:25:08,561 --> 01:25:11,620
how do you know that your analysis of 
Biblical stories are true?

1637
01:25:11,980 --> 01:25:13,540
Well,
that's a great question,

1638
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:16,210
but the issue there is what,
what you mean by true?

1639
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:18,213
I would say there are functional because
I'm a pragmatist and I mean that 

1640
01:25:21,791 --> 01:25:22,624
technically I believe that our 
conceptual structures are tools to help 

1641
01:25:25,691 --> 01:25:29,620
us orient ourselves in the world.
And so the issue for me is,

1642
01:25:29,860 --> 01:25:33,340
are the interpretations that I'm making 
of the biblical stories,

1643
01:25:33,970 --> 01:25:38,050
useful functional tools for people to 
use to operate in the world?

1644
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:43,330
And how can I demonstrate that their 
canonical interpretations of the Bible?

1645
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:45,640
Well,
I can't demonstrate that.

1646
01:25:45,670 --> 01:25:46,503
What I can say is that people can listen
to them and make their own judgment 

1647
01:25:49,271 --> 01:25:51,940
about whether or not they're useful and 
valid,

1648
01:25:52,210 --> 01:25:55,570
which I think is a better way of 
thinking about it then then true.

1649
01:25:55,720 --> 01:26:00,130
Because truth in literature and 
mythology is a very tricky concept.

1650
01:26:00,131 --> 01:26:00,964
And especially in a book like the Bible,
which as I pointed out in the first 

1651
01:26:03,771 --> 01:26:08,660
Biblical lecture is the first truly 
hyperlinked text where every,

1652
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:12,920
almost every verse interacts with almost
every other verse.

1653
01:26:13,190 --> 01:26:14,023
And so it's an end.
It's endlessly deep and there's an 

1654
01:26:17,450 --> 01:26:18,283
endless number in some sense of valid 
interpretations that could come forth 

1655
01:26:21,381 --> 01:26:22,550
from it.
But,

1656
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:24,033
um,

1657
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:25,650
okay,

1658
01:26:25,650 --> 01:26:27,980
there's more to the answer to that 
question,

1659
01:26:27,981 --> 01:26:30,740
but I can't go into it for now because 
I'm,

1660
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:31,813
well,
we're running out of time and I'm 

1661
01:26:32,241 --> 01:26:33,380
running out of energy.
In fact,

1662
01:26:33,381 --> 01:26:35,350
it is nine 30 and so,
um,

1663
01:26:37,070 --> 01:26:39,200
and so,
and my daughter has just showed up in my

1664
01:26:39,201 --> 01:26:40,034
wife has told me that.
So I think I'm actually going to take 

1665
01:26:41,751 --> 01:26:44,990
this opportunity to bow out and to say 
once again,

1666
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:46,030
thank you.
Um,

1667
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:50,460
this is my wife by the way.
I might as well what

1668
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:55,040
I was watching the video and I thought 
she was still in the room.

1669
01:26:55,041 --> 01:26:55,874
The video is lagged.
So I was actually interacting with a 

1670
01:26:58,041 --> 01:26:59,630
ghost there for a minute.
Um,

1671
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,510
I wanted to thank you all again for 
supporting me.

1672
01:27:02,710 --> 01:27:03,543
Um,
I also want to say I know that for you 

1673
01:27:05,271 --> 01:27:10,271
patrons that have been supporting me for
at the $200 level,

1674
01:27:10,730 --> 01:27:11,563
I know that I promise to give you 
producer credit on the biblical videos 

1675
01:27:15,171 --> 01:27:16,310
and I haven't forgotten that.

1676
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:19,970
I just haven't done it yet because I 
would like to say because I'd been doing

1677
01:27:19,971 --> 01:27:22,340
a bunch of other things and I do 
actually believe that's true,

1678
01:27:22,341 --> 01:27:24,470
but I haven't forgotten and I still want
to do it.

1679
01:27:24,471 --> 01:27:29,471
And I think it is important and you have
been crucial to the production of these,

1680
01:27:29,690 --> 01:27:31,640
this series,
all of you patrion supporters.

1681
01:27:31,641 --> 01:27:32,474
And I'm hoping that I can continue to 
put the support that you've been 

1682
01:27:34,881 --> 01:27:37,730
offering me to,
to ever better use.

1683
01:27:37,731 --> 01:27:42,440
And hopefully you can also help guide me
in doing that in these q and a's because

1684
01:27:42,441 --> 01:27:43,790
it gives us a chance to,
uh,

1685
01:27:44,450 --> 01:27:46,040
to communicate.
So,

1686
01:27:46,041 --> 01:27:48,170
um,
well,

1687
01:27:48,171 --> 01:27:53,171
so I'm going to say good night and 
thanks a lot to all of you and we'll see

1688
01:27:53,271 --> 01:27:55,320
you in a month.
Um,

1689
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:57,440
get your act together,
all of you,

1690
01:27:57,441 --> 01:27:59,120
and do what you can,
man.

1691
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:02,630
It'd be a wonderful thing to see.
And if enough people start doing that,

1692
01:28:02,631 --> 01:28:04,220
maybe we can turn this whole mess 
around.

1693
01:28:04,490 --> 01:28:07,190
That'd be lovely.
And maybe it won't take that many people

1694
01:28:07,191 --> 01:28:09,410
to start it,
so that'd be a good goal.

1695
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:11,660
So good night.
