1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,970
Yeah,

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:08,883
it's great to
be back in October last year and then 

3
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,523
made,
I've now made two documentaries about 

4
00:00:15,761 --> 00:00:16,594
you and a big focus for rebel.
Wisdom is kind of making sense of the 

5
00:00:22,061 --> 00:00:22,894
cultural moment and making sense of your
success and what it represents and I 

6
00:00:27,731 --> 00:00:28,564
don't know if you remember the very 
first question I asked you back in 

7
00:00:30,161 --> 00:00:30,994
October in the interview was firstly 
what do you make of your success so far 

8
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,640
and are you ready for it to continue?
Because I had.

9
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,503
I had a sense back then,
but what your message represented with 

10
00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:40,994
something in the culture desperately 
needed this sort of what that signifies 

11
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:45,970
to me as a kind of reintegration of the 
sacred.

12
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:48,003
Did you have any sense back then the,
the exponential success that you were 

13
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,950
going to have between then and now?

14
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,133
Well,
I mean the most likely outcome at each 

15
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:03,130
of the what?
What would you say at each point where I

16
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:03,964
might notice what's going on around me 
has been that this was stopped but it 

17
00:01:08,681 --> 00:01:09,514
isn't stopping,
so I've been thinking about that pretty 

18
00:01:12,311 --> 00:01:14,920
much nonstop I would say,
and I have some,

19
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,800
some solutions.
Let's say,

20
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:20,230
or some ideas that I didn't present in 
October,

21
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:25,770
so one of the things I've realized is 
that part of what's pushing

22
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:33,390
part of what's accounting for this,
the popularity of my ideas is actually a

23
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:37,330
secondary consequence of a technological
revolution.

24
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,780
And I've seen that more clearly since 
October,

25
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,363
um,
partly because I can see the mainstream 

26
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:45,124
media dying at a faster and faster rate 
and the alternative media expanding 

27
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,643
faster and faster.
So television radio and the classic 

28
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,363
print media had shared one thing in 
common which was a extreme restriction 

29
00:02:02,711 --> 00:02:03,544
in bandwidth.

30
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,680
This was especially true of television 
because each minute of television,

31
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:09,903
given the,
the necessity to broadcast and the 

32
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:15,850
expensive,
that was unbelievably expensive.

33
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,870
And so there just wasn't time to do 
anything on television.

34
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,790
There's no time.
And so if you had something important to

35
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,290
say,
um,

36
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,780
or even something unimportant for that 
matter,

37
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:33,970
most of the time it had to be compressed
into something approximating 30 seconds,

38
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,640
which wouldn't even be your words.
That would be a journalist.

39
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:41,641
Common commenting on what you said and 
if you were really pushing the envelope,

40
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,140
maybe you'd have 25 minutes on a talk 
show that was devoted to your ideas,

41
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,423
but then even that would be highly 
scripted and so television made people 

42
00:02:53,801 --> 00:02:54,634
look stupider than they were even to the
producers of television because of this 

43
00:02:58,721 --> 00:02:59,554
narrow.

44
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,253
The the rise of video online and audio 
as well has blown the bandwidth 

45
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:14,191
limitation out of our mass communication
and it turns out that people are smarter

46
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,913
with longer attention spans.
Then we thought what happened with me 

47
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:22,474
was that for one reason or another I was
an early adopter of that technology and 

48
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:28,894
so there's this massive technological 
transformation which is a Gutenberg 

49
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,830
revolution in the provision of video and
audio.

50
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,640
No barrier to production because it 
doesn't cost anything.

51
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,030
Anyone can do it.
People can communicate with it.

52
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,450
You can cut up youtube videos,
you can make your documentaries.

53
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,020
The entry point is easy.
Audio podcasts and that sort of thing,

54
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,200
which can be of indefinite length,
allow people to use,

55
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:56,890
found time to listen.
More people can listen.

56
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:57,724
Then can read like all of these things 
add up to a massive technological 

57
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:02,434
revolution and it's that upswell in 
technology that's in part has propelled 

58
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,510
what I've been doing to,
to,

59
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,490
to,
to the,

60
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,630
to the,
to,

61
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,980
to this mass audience.

62
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,820
And so that's been a relief to figure 
that out because it depersonalizes it to

63
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:20,290
some degree.
Right.

64
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,153
And so I use the metaphor,
we're not been asked about this before 

65
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:27,730
of being on a wave surfing on a giant 
wave,

66
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:30,100
but the wave isn't something that I've 
done.

67
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:32,230
It's part of this technological 
revolution.

68
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,603
So that's a relief to know that and I'm 
quite convinced that that's the case 

69
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,800
because there are other people who are 
occupying the same space.

70
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,310
Essentially.
Joe Rogan is a very good example of that

71
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,420
and the various commentators on,
on Youtube who've,

72
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,690
who've become increasingly influential 
and powerful.

73
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,750
Same thing driven by the technology.
They happen to be early adopters and so.

74
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,910
And then there's a secondary question 
which is,

75
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:01,744
well,
is there anything specific in 

76
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:05,740
relationship to my content,
let's say?

77
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:06,574
And I would say also that isn't the case
and I think what I've been able to do 

78
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,520
with reasonable effectiveness is to draw
a conceptual,

79
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,373
a equation equivalence between the 
meaning that's necessary to sustain you 

80
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:28,480
in life,
given it's suffering and malevolence and

81
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,090
the necessity to dog responsibility.

82
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,910
And I think there's something new about 
that.

83
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,920
I mean,
I don't know how new.

84
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,520
I'm sure I'm not the first person who's 
discovered that,

85
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:43,700
but I think I've done a reasonable job 
of pointing out to people that,

86
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:45,983
that the suffering that's intrinsic to 
life in the absence of meaning is not 

87
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:51,363
tolerable.
It,

88
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:52,180
it,
it,

89
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,013
it destroys and corrupts and that the 
proper pathway out of isn't rights or 

90
00:05:58,341 --> 00:06:01,820
happiness or entitlement or,
or anything that's associated with,

91
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,570
with,
with individual ease,

92
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,433
let's say.
But with the adoption of something 

93
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:12,290
approximating maximal responsibility.
And people get that,

94
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,153
like it's,
it's not that hard to understand when 

95
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:18,680
it's laid out like that.
And lots of people,

96
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:22,070
especially young people,
especially people who are young and also

97
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:24,590
somewhat nihilistic in their 
orientation,

98
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,953
uh,
perhaps because of an excess of 

99
00:06:27,051 --> 00:06:31,970
intellectual criticism are they grabbed 
that immediately.

100
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:32,661
I think,
oh,

101
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:34,340
there's the missing piece.
I see.

102
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:37,550
It's that the antidote to this 
meaninglessness,

103
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:42,050
this void that I'm confronting isn't 
hedonism.

104
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,720
It's not right.
It's not impulsive pleasure.

105
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,270
It's none of that.
It's responsibility.

106
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,710
It's like,
Oh yes,

107
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:51,350
okay.
That everything snaps into place.

108
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,483
And so that's been.
I think that's the most essential part 

109
00:06:55,431 --> 00:06:59,360
of the message to the degree that what 
I'm doing has an essential message.

110
00:06:59,361 --> 00:07:00,194
That would be it.
And I do think that's what accounts for 

111
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,460
a large part of its impact.

112
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:10,410
And you mentioned Joe Rogan before you 
and he are grouped together in this sort

113
00:07:10,411 --> 00:07:12,640
of new constellation of the intellectual
dark web.

114
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,300
What do you see as the,
I mean,

115
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:18,280
what do you make of your kind of 
inclusion in this and what do you see as

116
00:07:18,281 --> 00:07:21,060
its role going forward in the cultural 
organization?

117
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:21,220
Yeah,

118
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,660
well it's,
it's,

119
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,330
it's,
it's like a herd of cats,

120
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,200
right?
Because so I've thought about,

121
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:29,980
well,
what,

122
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,813
what,
what unites us to the degree that 

123
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:35,350
there's an us,
because that's not so self evident.

124
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,640
There's enough of us so that the name he
and it stuck.

125
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,253
So,
so there's something in common because 

126
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,370
otherwise the name wouldn't have stuck,
right?

127
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,040
You can't name nothing.
It doesn't work.

128
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,960
And I've talked to a fair bit about this
with Dave Rubin because Dave Rubin and I

129
00:07:52,961 --> 00:07:55,030
have been touring together,
right?

130
00:07:55,031 --> 00:07:59,680
He opens my mind discussions and adds a 
nice comedic touch to them.

131
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,340
And um,
so what do we have in common?

132
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:08,020
Everybody in the group is an independent
practitioner.

133
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,153
So an entrepreneur essentially with 
their own media enterprise that's 

134
00:08:13,991 --> 00:08:17,590
autonomous.
None of us are serving any master except

135
00:08:17,591 --> 00:08:19,360
the audience.
So,

136
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,530
so,
and,

137
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:25,360
and we're all somewhat independent 
financially as a consequence of that.

138
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,480
And so that makes us beholden to no 
master.

139
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:33,130
All of us are engaged in these long form
discussions,

140
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,353
right?
And one of the consequences of being 

141
00:08:36,011 --> 00:08:40,510
engaged in long form discussion is that 
you can assume that your intelligence,

142
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,463
that your audience is intelligent.
And so that's another thing that unites 

143
00:08:44,531 --> 00:08:48,460
everybody in the group is we all assume 
that our audience is intelligent,

144
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:49,563
but I think that that's not so much a 
consequence of any particular moral 

145
00:08:52,841 --> 00:08:53,674
virtue on our parts,
but an observation that the technology 

146
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:58,500
has made possible.
It's like,

147
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,970
oh,
and you can see this,

148
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,480
I would say particularly with Rogan 
because in some sense he's a trailblazer

149
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,770
in this domain.
It's like,

150
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,023
oh,
turns out my audience will listen to a 

151
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:08,364
three hour discussion.
But he wouldn't have been able to 

152
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:12,120
discover that without the technology.
Right?

153
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,343
So now to his credit,
he was smart enough to discover it and 

154
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:19,650
smart enough to notice it when he 
discovered it.

155
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,721
And so,
and I,

156
00:09:20,721 --> 00:09:23,850
I think that also characterize as the 
rest of the people in this group,

157
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:24,421
it's like,
oh,

158
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:25,254
look at that,
the audience actually wants our 

159
00:09:27,301 --> 00:09:28,200
listeners,
let's say,

160
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:32,670
and viewers want detailed in depth,
unscripted,

161
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,623
spontaneous,
meaningful conversation and then really 

162
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:41,560
are willing to go in that direction.
That's the risk taking element.

163
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,070
Like,
well,

164
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,770
I can give you an example of that.
So,

165
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,460
um,
I just did four talks with Sam Harris,

166
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,250
who's often grouped into this group as 
well.

167
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,720
I'm on the relationship between science 
and religion,

168
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:56,070
say,
or facts and values.

169
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:56,904
That's another way of thinking about it 
with a bit of politics thrown in a 

170
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,620
discussion of left rate differences and 
so on.

171
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,610
Um,
what's the willingness to take the risk?

172
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,200
Well,
I have no idea.

173
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,063
When I met Sam in Vancouver,
which was where the first two of the 

174
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,680
four talks were held.

175
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,040
I never met him before.
We did a podcast together,

176
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,880
one of which was very.
We got locked in the other one,

177
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:24,750
which was more productive I would say,
but I had no idea if he had,

178
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:26,700
I could talk,
but we,

179
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:31,050
we,
we were willing to willing to.

180
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:32,723
I guess that's right.
Agreed to take the risk to see if we 

181
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,374
could talk in a public forum.
And I think that's another thing that 

182
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:42,294
characterizes the people in that group 
is that they will take those sorts of 

183
00:10:45,001 --> 00:10:47,790
risks.
If you go into a television studio,

184
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,983
a classic television studio,
all the conversation is scripted and 

185
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,313
it's actually quite frustrated because 
you can't have a conversation with the 

186
00:10:55,711 --> 00:10:58,110
journalist because the journalist isn't 
there,

187
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,453
who's there is a frontest piece for the 
organization and the organization has 

188
00:11:04,251 --> 00:11:08,550
scripted all their responses and so it's
not actually like talking to a person.

189
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,380
It's really like talking to a puppet.
So for better or for worse,

190
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:17,610
but in these low unscripted loan form 
conversations,

191
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,473
then you can take the risk of having a 
conversation and that can go 

192
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:25,620
spectacularly well,
but it can also fail dismally.

193
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,873
So I would say those are the things that
united us to the degree that the group 

194
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,943
exists.
I mean I've met who I was in la a week 

195
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,910
ago and about seven of us got together 
for,

196
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,403
for dinner
and that was the first time we met as 

197
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:48,330
anything approximating a group.
And you know,

198
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:51,030
it was interesting to watch everybody 
interact because as I said,

199
00:11:51,031 --> 00:11:51,864
it really is a herd of cats.
There's tremendous diversity of 

200
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:57,490
political opinion and a tremendous 
diversity of personality.

201
00:11:57,491 --> 00:11:58,324
Like Eric Weinstein and Joe Rogan.
Like they're not even members of the 

202
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:04,450
same species in some ways,
you know,

203
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,890
so,
so it,

204
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,920
it's a very fractious group,
but I think those things that I outlined

205
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,120
are the elements that basically united,

206
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,650
there's also something that I sent to 
watching some of the discussions.

207
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:25,810
There's a kind of intellectual curiosity
and a sense of people thinking in public

208
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:27,903
and there's also a sense of maybe the 
potential for people to change their 

209
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:32,020
minds or to,
to,

210
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,640
to discover things during the course.

211
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:37,650
Was that partly the appreciation of the 
intelligence of the audience?

212
00:12:37,651 --> 00:12:38,484
It's like,
and I would say it is actually the 

213
00:12:40,501 --> 00:12:41,334
manifestation of the process of thinking
that's more important than the 

214
00:12:45,151 --> 00:12:45,984
conclusions that are generated even in 
these discussions that I've been having 

215
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:51,480
with Harris.
Like we are trying to,

216
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:53,783
to argue out to different viewpoints 
because Harris believes that values can 

217
00:12:57,901 --> 00:12:59,910
be derived with,
with,

218
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:05,070
with unerring precision in some sense 
using the proper methodology from facts.

219
00:13:05,071 --> 00:13:05,904
And I,
I believe that it's more complicated 

220
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,054
than that,
that there has to be intermediate 

221
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,650
structures and those are really 
narrative and in their nature.

222
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,160
So there's a technical argument,
um,

223
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,173
as well as a variety of sub arguments 
about the relative role of traditional 

224
00:13:21,391 --> 00:13:22,224
religion and so forth,
but the outcome of the debate about 

225
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:31,200
those issues is partly what people are 
coming to the talks to see,

226
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,010
to determine what should the conclusions
be,

227
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,113
but a much larger part perhaps is to 
observe and engage at least by proxy in 

228
00:13:42,091 --> 00:13:42,924
the process of dialogue.
And that's more important because 

229
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,860
dialogue is the process by which complex
problems are solved.

230
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,173
Which is what makes me a free speech 
advocate fundamentally was not an 

231
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:57,480
advocate.
It's like I realized that that,

232
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,793
that protection for free speech is 
protection of the mechanism whereby 

233
00:14:02,161 --> 00:14:05,820
complex social problems are solved and 
we're,

234
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,120
we're the people in this group and many 
other people as well are acting out that

235
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:14,110
dialogical process and,
and,

236
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,680
and people are happy about that as they 
should be.

237
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:22,270
And I've read the spectator review of 
your recent conversation.

238
00:14:22,641 --> 00:14:23,474
I think you've now come to the end of 
your debates with Sam Harris and they 

239
00:14:26,151 --> 00:14:30,320
said that you expressed a little bit of 
irritation at some of the stuff when Sam

240
00:14:30,321 --> 00:14:32,540
didn't grasp.
Some of the points that you're making or

241
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:35,330
that you didn't fully appreciate that he
read and understood them.

242
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,300
I also think that Sam Harris in 
particular,

243
00:14:38,301 --> 00:14:40,610
like he's built a whole kind of 
personality career,

244
00:14:40,611 --> 00:14:41,444
several books on this atheism position.
Do you think that he can argue in good 

245
00:14:46,281 --> 00:14:49,790
faith from that perspective?
Could he turn round and say,

246
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:50,511
well actually,
no,

247
00:14:50,511 --> 00:14:52,010
you're right.
This atheism

248
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,950
thing is a bit simplistic.
He was,

249
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,720
I think he was,
I think he was conducting the discussion

250
00:14:56,721 --> 00:14:57,554
in good faith.
I actually think that what Sam is doing 

251
00:14:59,721 --> 00:15:02,030
is a good faith project.
You know,

252
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,073
he,
I think there's conceptual muddiness 

253
00:15:05,391 --> 00:15:07,030
about it.
Um,

254
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,080
but you know,
he,

255
00:15:09,081 --> 00:15:09,914
his basic premise is that we could come 
to an agreement that working to reduce 

256
00:15:15,621 --> 00:15:20,621
unnecessary misery and suffering is a 
universal good slim.

257
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,820
Okay,
fair enough.

258
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,040
That seems like a reasonable 
proposition.

259
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,380
I don't think it's a proposition of 
fact.

260
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,990
And he claims that it is,
but that doesn't matter still.

261
00:15:29,991 --> 00:15:31,280
It's fair enough,
man.

262
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,020
And then,
you know,

263
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:33,854
so that's one proposition.
The other proposition is it would be 

264
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:41,150
really good if our systems of value 
weren't founded on air.

265
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,690
And what do we have that's not air?
What we have facts,

266
00:15:44,691 --> 00:15:46,340
we have objective facts.
I mean,

267
00:15:46,341 --> 00:15:47,174
look at the technology,
look at what we've done with our 

268
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:49,250
science.

269
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,083
It's like you don't want to 
underestimate the utility of objective 

270
00:15:52,281 --> 00:15:53,114
facts,
so maybe we can ground the value 

271
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:55,520
structure in the facts.
It's like,

272
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:56,683
well,
that would be good if we could do it so 

273
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,770
and,
and so.

274
00:16:00,771 --> 00:16:02,180
And then his,
his ethic,

275
00:16:02,181 --> 00:16:04,700
let's say,
as an amalgam of those two propositions.

276
00:16:04,701 --> 00:16:07,320
And I think that his project is 
honorable and,

277
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,373
and I think he's committed to it.
He also rightly is concerned with the 

278
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:17,270
dangers of the fundamentalist dangers of
revealed truth.

279
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,690
Um,
and so it's very skeptical about,

280
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,670
about the axiomatic claims of,
of dogmatic religion.

281
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,280
It's like,
yeah,

282
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,040
fair enough.
But

283
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,543
his,
the mechanisms that he outlines to 

284
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:41,150
derive values from facts are 
insufficient in my estimation.

285
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,500
I don't think that his argument is 
sufficiently sophisticated,

286
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,753
even though I don't doubt it's,
I don't think that Sam is any less 

287
00:16:50,331 --> 00:16:55,331
committed to an ethical good.
It's not obvious to me that he is than I

288
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,110
am,
you know,

289
00:16:57,111 --> 00:16:57,944
and he's argued and discussed
fully in good faith as far as I'm 

290
00:17:03,351 --> 00:17:04,250
concerned,
you know,

291
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:05,084
with the,
with the odd error because no one is 

292
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,990
negotiating 100 percent all the time in 
good faith.

293
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,060
I mean that's a standard that no one 
can,

294
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,920
can,
can achieve,

295
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,320
but I think the discussions have been 
unbelievably productive and,

296
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,080
and we'll see that certainly the crowds 
are respond.

297
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,080
I don't think the crowds would have been
engaged if Sam wouldn't have been,

298
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,590
wouldn't have been discussing in good 
faith,

299
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,053
you know,
because the engagement is actually an 

300
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:33,530
indication that a good faith discussion 
is,

301
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,630
is occurring.
Otherwise it gets dealt very,

302
00:17:35,631 --> 00:17:36,464
very rapidly.
We'll see what happens when the videos 

303
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:39,554
are released and that'll be in August.
Once their sound is edited and all of 

304
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:44,504
that,
and then people will have a public 

305
00:17:46,911 --> 00:17:51,060
debate about how it,
how did discussion proceeded.

306
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,043
I also think that each discussion built 
on the previous one and that we both 

307
00:17:56,011 --> 00:17:56,844
ended up.
I think we both ended up more informed 

308
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:02,550
and more articulate than we started out.
So that's a good.

309
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,413
That's a really good thing.
I certainly understand his argument is 

310
00:18:05,341 --> 00:18:09,420
much better than I did well a year ago,
let's say,

311
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,360
and I've heard Eric Weinstein described 
sort of the cultural moment is a kind of

312
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:15,194
civil war within the left,
sort of extreme left and then sort of 

313
00:18:18,111 --> 00:18:19,950
moderate soft left,
um,

314
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,251
which,
uh,

315
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:23,600
probably sort of the,
at least the dominating kind of paradigm

316
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:25,590
in the media.
Um,

317
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:26,703
I,
I'm,

318
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:27,643
I've got a lot of progressive friends 
and what I see happening recently maybe 

319
00:18:30,891 --> 00:18:31,724
in the last couple of weeks is a lot of 
them starting to grapple with your 

320
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,230
ideas.
Um,

321
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,173
and looking at asking this question,
what can the left learn from Jordan 

322
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:43,230
Peterson,
um,

323
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,083
which is,
which is a pretty new development 

324
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,370
because I saw a lot of kind of 
reactivity to it before.

325
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:53,480
How can you personally contribute to 
that debate?

326
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,520
And

327
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,430
is that a debate you're interested in 
contributing?

328
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,250
Absolutely.
No,

329
00:18:58,251 --> 00:19:00,500
no doubt about it,
no doubt about it.

330
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,793
Um,
one thing that I've been doing in my 

331
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:08,810
tour repeatedly when I talk about the 
first chapter of my book,

332
00:19:08,811 --> 00:19:10,910
which is stand up straight with your 
shoulders back,

333
00:19:10,911 --> 00:19:14,060
it's a discussion of hierarchies and 
their eternal nature,

334
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,200
right?
Because my claim,

335
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,243
not my claim,
I think it's mirror fact that organisms 

336
00:19:20,991 --> 00:19:21,824
that have to cooperate and compete with 
other organisms have their type 

337
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:29,600
inevitably arrange themselves into 
hierarchies.

338
00:19:29,601 --> 00:19:34,601
And that's been going on for so long,
which is at least 300 million years that

339
00:19:35,361 --> 00:19:36,194
our nervous systems have adapted to 
hierarchies as if they're a permanent 

340
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,573
element of being right,
more permanent than treats like 

341
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,370
seriously permanent at the most 
fundamental neurochemical,

342
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,233
the one that regulates the entire brain.
Serotonin is acutely sensitive to 

343
00:19:54,021 --> 00:19:57,410
hierarchical distinctions.
And so that's part of the proposition.

344
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,243
So the reason I laid that proposition 
forward was to say whatever pitfalls 

345
00:20:03,471 --> 00:20:04,304
hierarchies might produce,
you cannot lay them at the feet of the 

346
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,200
West Patriarchy or capitalism.
It's like that's a nonstarter.

347
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:15,200
You're wrong and not just a little bit 
wrong.

348
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,560
You're so seriously wrong that if you 
insist upon doing that,

349
00:20:18,561 --> 00:20:19,394
you won't even achieve your own names 
because you're actually not grappling 

350
00:20:22,941 --> 00:20:23,774
with the problem.
The problem is if hierarchies are a 

351
00:20:25,881 --> 00:20:27,710
problem,
which they are,

352
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:32,000
the problem is way more serious than 
mere capitalism.

353
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:37,750
It's way deeper and if you're actually 
interested in rectifying the cons,

354
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,490
the negative consequences of 
hierarchies,

355
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,300
then you're going to have to get a lot 
more sophisticated than your,

356
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:46,370
than your idiot Marxism.
So,

357
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,293
so,
so part of the elaboration of that 

358
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:49,930
argument is,
well,

359
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,513
hierarchies are inevitable because we 
have to solve complex problems and we 

360
00:20:54,641 --> 00:20:55,990
have to solve them socially.

361
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,020
And when you implement a solution to a 
complex problem,

362
00:20:59,021 --> 00:20:59,854
socially you produce a hierarchy because
some people are better at the 

363
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:06,010
implementation than others.
So there's a hierarchy of competence and

364
00:21:06,011 --> 00:21:09,400
then there's a hierarchy of distribution
of the spoils.

365
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,130
And so,
and in both of those hierarchies,

366
00:21:12,131 --> 00:21:12,964
you get a disproportionate clumping of 
resources at the top and disposition at 

367
00:21:16,961 --> 00:21:19,300
the bottom and the nature of 
hierarchies.

368
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,493
So what's the left for?
The left is to remind those who are 

369
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:25,984
benefiting from the hierarchies that the
hierarchy comes at a cost and the cost 

370
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:32,524
is the clumping of people at the bottom 
and that that's an internal costs and 

371
00:21:36,851 --> 00:21:37,684
it's not trivial,
and so that's what the left should be 

372
00:21:40,511 --> 00:21:41,344
properly focused on.
The left should be providing the voice 

373
00:21:44,321 --> 00:21:45,154
of those who are dispossessed by 
hierarchies and the right should be 

374
00:21:47,801 --> 00:21:49,090
saying,
yeah,

375
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,670
but the damn hierarchies are necessary 
and they're not only necessary,

376
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,590
but they're also productive.

377
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,323
Then the left says yes,
but they tilt towards tyranny and they 

378
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:06,400
can be occupied inappropriately by 
people who are playing games of power.

379
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,370
Fair enough.
The right has to take that into account.

380
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,980
The hierarchy can rigidity,
rigidified,

381
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,420
and is likely to do that and it can be 
taken over by people who are corrupt and

382
00:22:16,421 --> 00:22:18,610
that's likely to happen.
And so,

383
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:21,250
but,
but it's okay because the dialogue could

384
00:22:21,251 --> 00:22:23,200
work out.
The right can say,

385
00:22:23,201 --> 00:22:24,034
well yeah,
we need the damn hierarchies and they 

386
00:22:24,971 --> 00:22:27,790
need to be about trust.
And the left can say yes,

387
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:28,683
but they have to be maintained properly 
so they don't deteriorate and 

388
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,020
degenerate.
And I think that's,

389
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,913
I think that's ancient wisdom.
I think the ancient Egyptians had 

390
00:22:38,111 --> 00:22:40,660
figured that out in their symbolic 
representations.

391
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:46,080
So now when the left goes too far,
it does something like say,

392
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,000
well,
how about no hierarchies?

393
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,611
It's like,
no,

394
00:22:48,611 --> 00:22:53,611
how about not wrong?
Because all that happens if you flat.

395
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,693
One of the things that happens if you 
flatten out the hierarchy is that you 

396
00:22:56,921 --> 00:22:57,754
can't even organize your perceptions.
You can't perceive the world without 

397
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,790
looking at the world through a hierarchy
of value.

398
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,103
And if because you can't perceive the 
world unless you make one thing more 

399
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:10,840
important than all the other things 
because you don't even know what to look

400
00:23:10,841 --> 00:23:11,674
at,
and if one thing isn't more important 

401
00:23:13,181 --> 00:23:15,250
than all the other things,
then you have nothing to aim at.

402
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:18,040
If you have nothing to aim at and you 
have no meaning in your life,

403
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:22,930
so the left can't just demolish the 
hierarchies in the name of some equality

404
00:23:22,931 --> 00:23:23,920
of outcome,
let's say,

405
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:27,460
because you blow out the future,
you leave people aimless,

406
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,383
and you destroyed the very institutions 
that allow people to make competent 

407
00:23:31,241 --> 00:23:32,410
progress in the world.

408
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:35,920
That's not an acceptable outcome,
so we have to,

409
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,203
we have to agree to live with the 
tension necessity for hierarchies that 

410
00:23:43,051 --> 00:23:43,884
proclivity for them to pathologize and 
the necessary voice of the left and 

411
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:50,630
speaking for the,
for the dispossessed.

412
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:54,320
So and I mean I've.
As far as I'm concerned,

413
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:58,550
I've said something approximating that 
through my entire career.

414
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,380
So the fact that the left wingers have 
been irritated at me as well,

415
00:24:03,381 --> 00:24:04,214
in some sense that's an inevitable 
consequence of me taking on the radical 

416
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:09,584
left wingers,
but it's also the refusal by the 

417
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,480
moderate left to deal with their 
internal problems

418
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,850
and the sticking point that I hear a lot
from my sort of more progressive friends

419
00:24:22,851 --> 00:24:25,610
is your sort of primary focus is on the 
individual.

420
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:26,480
Yeah.
Well that's,

421
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,313
that's too bad for them because their 
primary focus should be on the 

422
00:24:29,381 --> 00:24:29,900
individual.

423
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,190
I can agree with that,
but what I.

424
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,300
The paradox,
they would say it's like,

425
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:37,340
okay,
focus on the individual,

426
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,443
but you have to accept that there are 
some situations that are much more 

427
00:24:41,661 --> 00:24:42,494
conducive to an individual thriving and 
other situations and so they're focused 

428
00:24:45,531 --> 00:24:48,440
on structural inequality.
Your focusing on the individual,

429
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,750
is there not some interplay?

430
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:51,763
Well,
obviously because people do have group 

431
00:24:53,321 --> 00:24:54,154
identities.
The question is whether whether the 

432
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:00,810
group or the individual identity should 
be paramount and the leftist dance.

433
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,760
The radical leftist answer is,
well,

434
00:25:02,761 --> 00:25:03,594
there is the look,
it's not me that's failing to take into 

435
00:25:07,061 --> 00:25:07,894
account those two levels of analysis.
It's the bloody radical leftist because 

436
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:11,344
for them it's the collective and that's 
that and so it's obvious as far as I'm 

437
00:25:16,661 --> 00:25:17,494
concerned that people have their 
individuality and then behind that they 

438
00:25:20,831 --> 00:25:22,420
have there.
They have their group,

439
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,450
multiple group identities which is also 
a big problem

440
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,633
or any of these situations that make it 
much more difficult for people to self 

441
00:25:29,801 --> 00:25:32,290
actualize.
What what I think they'd argue with.

442
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,390
They don't hear you talk about that very
much.

443
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,290
Well,
it isn't.

444
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,720
First of all,
it's not self evident like I'm not.

445
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,940
I don't accept maslow's hierarchy of 
needs.

446
00:25:39,941 --> 00:25:40,774
I don't think it's necessarily more 
difficult for people who are poor to 

447
00:25:43,481 --> 00:25:45,010
self actualize.
Sorry,

448
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:47,740
I don't buy that because what that would
mean.

449
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,663
Think about what that would mean.
That would mean that the rich are 

450
00:25:51,101 --> 00:25:54,220
morally superior.
That's what that means,

451
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:56,950
because they have all the opportunities 
to self actualize.

452
00:25:56,951 --> 00:25:57,784
So obviously if the material conditions 
are the prerequisite for self 

453
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:01,624
actualization,
then the rich are morally superior to 

454
00:26:03,431 --> 00:26:04,264
the poor.
Is that really an argument we want to 

455
00:26:05,471 --> 00:26:07,540
make?
And then in fact,

456
00:26:07,541 --> 00:26:08,374
I don't think that that's even even 
vaguely reasonable because one of the 

457
00:26:11,591 --> 00:26:14,980
things that does help build character is
privation.

458
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:20,790
Now obviously starving to death is an,
an excess of privation.

459
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:24,460
So there are limit conditions,
but

460
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:26,823
the,
it's a leftist trope that the provision 

461
00:26:28,631 --> 00:26:32,800
of additional material resources will 
produce ethically superior human beings.

462
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,840
Sorry,
not true.

463
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,180
And in fact,
sometimes quite the contrary.

464
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,920
So,
so,

465
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,180
um,
so I don't,

466
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,820
I don't,
I don't buy that argument in the least.

467
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,093
Um,
I also think that under most 

468
00:26:46,141 --> 00:26:46,974
circumstances,
it accepting those of exceptional 

469
00:26:49,471 --> 00:26:53,700
privation and even perhaps under those 
conditions in most,

470
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,073
in most cases,
your best bet to move people forward is 

471
00:26:59,371 --> 00:27:00,204
to concentrate on the development of 
their individual character and their 

472
00:27:03,151 --> 00:27:05,340
individual,
their individual moral character.

473
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,260
And because moral character is actually 
your moral character is actually the set

474
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:11,094
of tools that you have to operate 
effectively in the work because 

475
00:27:13,681 --> 00:27:15,990
otherwise morality would be of no 
utility.

476
00:27:15,991 --> 00:27:20,991
And morality is in some sense precisely 
that w which is of maximal utility.

477
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,573
And so and,
and the other objection that I would 

478
00:27:25,531 --> 00:27:27,480
throw it at the radical leftists.
Well,

479
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:29,160
how do you know that your,
oh,

480
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,053
your emphasis on collective existence 
isn't just an abdication of your 

481
00:27:35,671 --> 00:27:37,050
personal responsibility.

482
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,190
Well,
of course it's not.

483
00:27:38,191 --> 00:27:39,120
It's like,
no,

484
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:39,810
no,
no.

485
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,370
Seriously,
here,

486
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,430
it's not that easy to adopt personal 
responsibility,

487
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,043
maximal personal responsibility.
What makes you think you're not running 

488
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:52,350
away from it?
You have every reason to.

489
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,160
You really have that stellar moral 
character.

490
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,320
Really,
that's,

491
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,850
that's yourself analysis.
Sorry,

492
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,833
I don't buy it.
And I especially don't buy it when I 

493
00:28:02,401 --> 00:28:03,234
look at the consequences of leftist 
revolution because all of these people 

494
00:28:06,901 --> 00:28:11,820
have stellar moral character when they 
undertake their collectivist revolution.

495
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:15,330
Nothing comes out of that,
but absolute bloody catastrophe.

496
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,610
So,
so all the well meaning aims aside,

497
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,403
my,
my sense of a lot of the progressive 

498
00:28:25,231 --> 00:28:26,064
people that I know is that they're not,
that they're sort of from a new 

499
00:28:28,891 --> 00:28:30,780
generation,
they're not generally materialists,

500
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:31,643
that they're sort of very spiritually 
aware and I sense a kind of implicit 

501
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:37,260
message in what you're saying.
I've never heard,

502
00:28:37,261 --> 00:28:42,261
made explicitly that in some sense 
materialism is a deadening doctrine.

503
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,850
I mean you look at the opiod crisis in 
America,

504
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:46,330
you look at a lot of these.
If,

505
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,253
if poverty is seen as a more sort of 
also also as a sort of spiritual crisis 

506
00:28:50,581 --> 00:28:53,250
or a crisis of the soul as much as 
anything else.

507
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:55,403
Is it mostly.
That would be lovely if poverty was 

508
00:28:59,161 --> 00:29:00,450
caused by lack of money.

509
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:03,020
Hmm.
We could fix it really easily then.

510
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,120
But my point I think is to say that if,
if you frame your message in that way,

511
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,013
I think there will be a lot of people on
the left who would be receptive to that 

512
00:29:11,691 --> 00:29:12,524
message.
Sort of the that actually there is a 

513
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:18,140
crisis of the crisis of,
what do you call it,

514
00:29:18,141 --> 00:29:18,974
like worldview has real consequences and
a lot of poverty we're seeing in the 

515
00:29:22,251 --> 00:29:25,220
world is to do with this kind of 
materialist worldview that has become,

516
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:30,440
become corrupt or at least kind of 
stripped all of the meaning and purpose.

517
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,400
Yeah.
Well that,

518
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,590
that's a good point.
Well,

519
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,453
right.
Well,

520
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,353
I mean I don't believe that materialism,
materialist hedonism is a sufficient 

521
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,444
solution.
Now it's bit more complicated than that 

522
00:29:42,611 --> 00:29:43,444
because I do think that functional 
democratic systems are actually pretty 

523
00:29:48,671 --> 00:29:49,504
good at reasonable hedonism.
Like I'm pretty happy that our system 

524
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:59,050
produces a variety of toothpastes and a 
variety of toilet papers in a variety of

525
00:29:59,051 --> 00:30:01,410
sanitary napkins.
All of these things that,

526
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:06,640
that are basically oriented towards,
what would you call them individually,

527
00:30:06,641 --> 00:30:07,474
creature comforts.
There's something about that that's 

528
00:30:08,951 --> 00:30:12,490
really merciful and properly 
egalitarian.

529
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:16,960
And so a certain degree of material 
hedonism is a good thing,

530
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,000
right?
Because it,

531
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:23,190
it's nice that people can have their 
basic needs taken care of in a dignified

532
00:30:24,761 --> 00:30:26,040
manner.
Um,

533
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,003
but as,
as a ultimate solution to the problems 

534
00:30:29,501 --> 00:30:30,610
of life.
It's insufficient,

535
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:33,460
which is again why I don't really like 
Abraham maslow's hierarchy of,

536
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,750
of,
of,

537
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,220
of,
of needs.

538
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,623
Now it isn't.
It isn't a progression up the moral 

539
00:30:40,031 --> 00:30:43,420
chain because of the provision of 
additional material resources.

540
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,273
It doesn't work that way.
That doesn't mean that you don't want 

541
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:47,124
to.
You want to set up a situation where as 

542
00:30:48,341 --> 00:30:53,341
many people as possible are absent the 
terrible strictures of of privation,

543
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:59,020
but we are doing that quite rapidly.
Thank God so,

544
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,913
so I think we're.
The leftists are less happy with what 

545
00:31:05,741 --> 00:31:06,574
I'm doing is the case that I'm making 
that the meaning that transcends mere 

546
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:12,454
materialism is to be found in the 
adoption of individual responsibility 

547
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,760
because I wouldn't say that that's a 
core message.

548
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,623
Certainly none of the radical left it.
It's not that at all because generally 

549
00:31:23,171 --> 00:31:24,004
they construe the individual as either 
the oppressor or the suffering or 

550
00:31:28,521 --> 00:31:33,521
pressed but not as the active agent as 
either of those active agents.

551
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,653
The problem with the oppressor of press 
narrative is even though there's an 

552
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:39,004
element of truth to it,
each of us can be subdivided into so 

553
00:31:42,011 --> 00:31:42,844
many group identities that there's at 
least one dimension along which we're 

554
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:46,654
all oppresses and that's actually when 
I've been looking at what happened in 

555
00:31:50,921 --> 00:31:52,750
the aftermath of the Russian revolution.

556
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:57,130
That that was the bloody error,
so to speak.

557
00:31:57,370 --> 00:32:02,370
Because you could take virtually every,
any individual and you could find out.

558
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,103
It's like if there's one dimension of 
your identity that makes you an 

559
00:32:06,761 --> 00:32:07,594
oppressor,
that trumps all the elements of your 

560
00:32:09,821 --> 00:32:11,440
identity,
where you're a victim.

561
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,113
And the problem with that is there is 
one element of your identity where 

562
00:32:15,431 --> 00:32:20,431
you're an oppressor and so that's 
sufficient justification to throw you in

563
00:32:20,531 --> 00:32:24,040
with the predators and do whatever is 
necessary to dispense with you.

564
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:26,500
And that is exactly what happened in the
aftermath.

565
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,423
Will not only of the Russian revolution,
but all of these radical leftist 

566
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,870
revolutions.
So like,

567
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,753
well,
if you're a socialist while you're not 

568
00:32:34,451 --> 00:32:37,390
sufficiently pure from a doctrinaire 
perspective.

569
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:38,224
And if you're a student,
well then you're part of the emerging 

570
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,300
bourgeois class.
And if your parents were reasonably,

571
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,910
what would you say?
Efficient farmers,

572
00:32:46,911 --> 00:32:51,260
then you're part of the Kulaks and like 
it just went on and on and on and on.

573
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:53,600
There wasn't anybody who escaped from 
the,

574
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:56,150
from being tarred with the brush of 
oppressor.

575
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,103
And that's because that is because each 
of us are in fact oppressors and 

576
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,040
oppressed.
Every single person shares both of those

577
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:06,230
things in common.
So,

578
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:09,270
um,
got a couple of minutes left.

579
00:33:09,271 --> 00:33:12,530
So this might be quite a big question,
but just come back from the U.

580
00:33:12,531 --> 00:33:13,364
s where we interviewed pool vander clay,
Christian pastor who's been doing quite 

581
00:33:16,081 --> 00:33:21,081
a lot of videos about your,
your thought he,

582
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,950
one of his questions was,
he says he,

583
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,873
he's,
he's a real sort of stoicism and your 

584
00:33:24,691 --> 00:33:28,560
thought for pick up your cross and drag 
it up the hill.

585
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:31,320
His question is what's at the top of the
hill?

586
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,490
He doesn't hear that.

587
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:35,060
Well,
that's because he hasn't listened to the

588
00:33:35,061 --> 00:33:38,390
times when I've been talking about it.
I guess because I've said it repeatedly.

589
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:43,010
You stumble up hill with your burden 
towards the city of God.

590
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,390
That's the,
that's the store that does that.

591
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:46,360
I mean the city of gold

592
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:51,980
to you.
I would say that that's.

593
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,933
That's a place where everyone bears 
maximum responsibility and speaks the 

594
00:33:57,331 --> 00:34:00,120
truth.
That's what it is.

595
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,383
And what's the responsibility?
You're responsible for the suffering in 

596
00:34:05,811 --> 00:34:06,644
the world.
You're responsible for the malevolence 

597
00:34:09,021 --> 00:34:14,021
in the world and you're responsible for 
the veracity of your utterances.

598
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,380
Right?
And in the city of God,

599
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,870
you're maximally responsible for the 
suffering.

600
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,830
You're maximally responsible for the 
malevolence and you speak the truth.

601
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,560
That's what it is.
Very concise.

602
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:31,780
So you can tell them Paul van play that.
Great.

603
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,220
Jordan,
thank you very much.

604
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:34,870
My pleasure.
Nice to see you again.

605
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:35,933
You take.
