1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,330
We talk about phenomenology last time 
and

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,880
I tried to make the case that
phenomenology,

3
00:00:20,801 --> 00:00:23,830
at least in part,
was an attempt to include

4
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:26,883
the entire domain of subjective 
experience inside the definition of 

5
00:00:30,341 --> 00:00:31,174
reality.

6
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,333
Yeah.

7
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,033
When Roger's talked about mental health,
he was speaking of something that that 

8
00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:51,061
superseded just rational coherence.
Rogers also touched on

9
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,270
a topic that's become very well 
developed since the time of Rogers,

10
00:00:58,271 --> 00:01:00,430
which is the topic of embodied 
cognition.

11
00:01:00,431 --> 00:01:01,264
It's become increasingly clear
to artificial intelligence researchers 

12
00:01:06,611 --> 00:01:07,444
particularly

13
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,253
that

14
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:13,483
the enlightenment idea of rationality as
like a disembodied sort of spiritual 

15
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:23,120
function is,
is wrong in principle.

16
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:29,020
And I think that's because
the way the brain sets itself up

17
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,413
with the body is the way that we 
discussed when we were talking about 

18
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:35,144
piaget.
It's that the mind is built from motor 

19
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:39,974
actions up and the concepts that the 
mind uses aren't abstract categories 

20
00:01:45,141 --> 00:01:49,100
that describe reality.
They're more like tools that allow us to

21
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:52,640
do things in the world.
And so they're predicated,

22
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,480
their validity is predicated on the fact
that we have a body.

23
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:02,270
And one of the things that Rogers was 
trying to emphasize,

24
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,870
and I think there's a long history of 
this in

25
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,573
in

26
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,910
western thought over the last few 
thousand years,

27
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,620
that there's,
there are faculties of,

28
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,203
of apprehension that are higher than 
rationality and some of those are 

29
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:25,164
embodied.

30
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,063
So

31
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,543
it's a variant in Floridian theory 
because the Friday ends of course 

32
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,184
thought that it was necessary to attend 
to emotions and motivational states and 

33
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:36,894
to integrate them with the ego.
But it takes that idea further in some 

34
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:46,830
sense
by treating the inputs of the body.

35
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,383
So motivational states and emotions,
but also perhaps the capacity to mirror 

36
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:55,830
other people as a prerequisite for 
mental health.

37
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,850
And so the other thing that Rogers 
emphasizes

38
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,053
is to pay attention to how it is that 
your experiential field is manifesting 

39
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:12,640
itself while you speak and interact with
other people.

40
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:18,100
And he was hoping and pr and striving 
towards a kind of unification.

41
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,023
It was analogous to the unification that
are described to you that young talked 

42
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:25,370
about in his last book
there.

43
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,343
There's another practical element to 
this that I should tell you that that I 

44
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:29,704
think is unbelievably useful.
We talked last time a little bit about 

45
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:38,281
the necessity of listening to people and
techniques that you could use to do that

46
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,080
in the effort to improve your 
communications and and,

47
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,123
and also to improve the degree to which 
you were gathering information that was 

48
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,420
practically useful to you and 
corrective.

49
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,020
But with the Rogerian techniques to some
degree,

50
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:53,854
you could do the same thing with regards
to the relationship between your 

51
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,993
intellectual rationality,
which is sort of your knowledge as 

52
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:03,184
represented at the highest level of 
verbal abstraction and the platform on 

53
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:12,100
which that knowledge is hypothetically 
implemented.

54
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:16,960
So you can imagine in the [inaudible] 
mode of development,

55
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,063
you start to learn how to move and then 
those movements are chained in evermore 

56
00:04:21,941 --> 00:04:26,941
complex sequences and those sequences 
start to become representable abstractly

57
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:29,950
so that you can describe yourself,
for example,

58
00:04:29,951 --> 00:04:30,784
as a good person.
And hypothetically as you decompose the 

59
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:37,180
idea of good person down towards 
specific actions,

60
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,343
that whole hierarchy is internally 
consistent in that you're a good person 

61
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:47,020
in your self representation,
but you also enact all the things that a

62
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:47,854
good person would enact.
And then there's no flaws in the entire 

63
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:51,424
hierarchy.
But the weird thing about having an 

64
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:59,581
intelligence that's dissociable,
which means that you can think up things

65
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:00,604
without acting them out,
is that you can also formulate self 

66
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:03,964
representations in ideas that aren't 
fully integrated with the manner in 

67
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:10,960
which you actually act.

68
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,230
So you can have a concept of yourself 
and,

69
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:18,231
and even an ideological framework that's
only vaguely related to your,

70
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,780
to the programming that's been 
instantiated in your body.

71
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,510
And Rogers would consider that,
uh,

72
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,130
he has a technical term for it.
It's a,

73
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,020
well it's a form of internal disharmony,
non congruent.

74
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:34,720
That's,
that's,

75
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,360
that's his term and the non congruent 
ideas.

76
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:41,920
A very interesting one because in my 
experience you can feel it.

77
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,253
So,
and here's something that you could try 

78
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:45,994
as an experiment.
And I think it's as effective and 

79
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:51,010
experiment as the listening experiment 
that we discussed last time.

80
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:55,840
So
it's very common for modern people,

81
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:57,800
especially intelligent,
modern people,

82
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,520
to identify themselves with the contents
of their intellect.

83
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,470
But that's a strange thing to do in many
sense in many ways because first of all,

84
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:08,780
obviously you're not just the content of
your intellect,

85
00:06:08,781 --> 00:06:09,614
your also your emotions and your 
motivations and your body and so forth 

86
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:14,390
and your embeddedness within a social 
context.

87
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,643
But especially if you're intelligent,
it's tempting to identify yourself with 

88
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:19,964
the contents of your intellect.
But there's no reason to assume 

89
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,174
whatsoever that those contents are in 
fact congruent with the programming of 

90
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:29,780
your body or,
or even with its natural inclinations.

91
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:34,781
And that's partly because the fact that 
you can abstract also means that you can

92
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:36,284
learn abstract.
And that means you can pull in concepts 

93
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,374
from the world at a level of abstraction
that may have virtually nothing to do 

94
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:43,454
with you.
And that's certainly the case if you're 

95
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:49,370
educated because you read all sorts of 
things and the,

96
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:50,204
you know,
the reading and all the investigating 

97
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:53,234
that you do at an abstract level allows 
you to have theories about being in 

98
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:57,314
theories about yourself.
But there's no necessity that those 

99
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:00,764
theories about being in yourself have 
any basis in who or what you actually 

100
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:06,740
are.
And so that can,

101
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,993
that makes you into the inauthentic.
That's the existential perspective and 

102
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,340
the Rogerian perspective would be 
incongruent.

103
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,383
There are,

104
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,473
you're not a singular entity at all the 
multiple levels at which you exist and 

105
00:07:22,321 --> 00:07:24,150
that can cause conflict.
So for example,

106
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:29,151
maybe you're acting out in ideology 
because you're convinced of its rational

107
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,860
integrity and coherence and utility,
but that utility,

108
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,870
that ideology doesn't fulfill you as a 
individual.

109
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,610
That's certainly an existential claim.
It's a fundamental existential claim.

110
00:07:41,611 --> 00:07:42,444
In fact,
as we'll talk about in in the next 

111
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:44,874
lecture,
there are thinkers like soldier Nansen 

112
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:52,070
who've ascribed the worst catastrophes 
of the 20th century to exactly that kind

113
00:07:52,411 --> 00:07:53,244
of inauthenticity,
which is the development of a coherent 

114
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:58,410
and rational ideology,
say like a Communist ideology.

115
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,830
And then the attempt to force that on 
the world and and on people,

116
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:02,813
despite the fact that the rational 
formulation and the reality of the 

117
00:08:05,581 --> 00:08:07,860
people in the world have very little in 
common.

118
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:10,803
Now,
how would you detect your own 

119
00:08:11,921 --> 00:08:14,770
inauthenticity or your,
your own incongruent?

120
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,563
Well,
Rogers had this idea that he called 

121
00:08:18,521 --> 00:08:23,521
subception which was maybe something 
that you might regard as a sixth sense.

122
00:08:24,281 --> 00:08:25,114
It's sort of like a proprietors centric 
perception and that's the perception 

123
00:08:31,361 --> 00:08:32,194
that you have of your body as it's 
reacting and localized in time and 

124
00:08:36,701 --> 00:08:37,534
space.
And so it's sort of like touch the 

125
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:40,610
feeling but it's,
it's,

126
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,620
it's your sense of how you're reacting 
internally and where you are.

127
00:08:45,621 --> 00:08:49,420
And a lot of that is subserved by the 
autonomic nervous system,

128
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:52,900
which is reporting to you about various 
states of being in your body.

129
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,320
Rogers believed that you could use the 
information that's being provided to you

130
00:09:01,991 --> 00:09:02,824
from your body,
sort of bottom up to determine when you 

131
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:06,754
were being inauthentic or non congruent.
And I've thought about this for a long 

132
00:09:10,991 --> 00:09:14,350
time and tried to sort it out in a 
practical manner.

133
00:09:14,351 --> 00:09:15,184
And what I've concluded is this,
you could try this for a couple of 

134
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,050
weeks.
It's an extremely interesting exercise.

135
00:09:20,051 --> 00:09:25,051
So you sorta have to detach yourself 
from your thoughts and your and what you

136
00:09:25,571 --> 00:09:27,460
say.
So you got to assume,

137
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,593
you start by assuming that what you say 
and what you think is not necessarily 

138
00:09:31,091 --> 00:09:31,924
you,
and of course that's just the case 

139
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,650
because a lot of what you think,
in fact,

140
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:36,723
most of what you think and most of what 
you say are the opinions of other 

141
00:09:39,521 --> 00:09:40,354
people.
There are things you've read or things 

142
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:42,364
people have told you.
You know that that's a benefit in some 

143
00:09:44,531 --> 00:09:48,100
ways because you get all those thoughts 
that other people have spent a long time

144
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:50,650
formulating,
but it's a disadvantage in that it's not

145
00:09:50,651 --> 00:09:53,230
exactly you.
Okay,

146
00:09:53,231 --> 00:09:57,310
so you detach yourself from that.
You're no longer your thoughts or or,

147
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,293
or the things that you say or maybe 
you're no longer all of them and now 

148
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,370
what you're going to try to find out is

149
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,053
which of your thoughts and things that 
you say are you and maybe so you not 

150
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,100
utilize the rest or maybe so that you 
can correct the rest because they're not

151
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:18,060
representative of yourself as a,
as an integrated being.

152
00:10:18,061 --> 00:10:19,680
They don't take everything into account.

153
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,573
My sense has been that you can tell when
you're saying something that's not 

154
00:10:27,311 --> 00:10:32,170
authentic by feeling out whether or not 
it makes you weak or strong.

155
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:33,993
Now you know what?
Sometimes when you're conversing with 

156
00:10:35,471 --> 00:10:36,304
people,
you can say something that embarrasses 

157
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,010
yourself.
Now Nisha said,

158
00:10:39,011 --> 00:10:39,844
for example,
everyone has perjured themselves at 

159
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:44,920
least once in the attempt to maintain 
their good name,

160
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,230
something like that.
It's not an exact quote,

161
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:48,580
but I've got the gist of it,
right?

162
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,773
So maybe you're saying things to impress
someone or you're saying things to 

163
00:10:52,841 --> 00:10:56,350
remain part of your political group or 
your social group or whatever.

164
00:10:56,351 --> 00:10:57,184
Or maybe you have attributes,
personal attributes that might be 

165
00:10:59,861 --> 00:11:03,430
positive that you're ashamed of and so 
you're not going to speak about them.

166
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,280
So there's a falseness about yourself,
representation,

167
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:08,983
watch for two weeks and see,
make a rule that if you start to say 

168
00:11:14,061 --> 00:11:14,894
something and it makes you feel weak,
it's hard to describe exactly what that 

169
00:11:18,441 --> 00:11:19,274
means to me.
What it means is that I can feel things 

170
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:23,653
coming apart sort of in my mid section.
So I think it's an autonomic phenomena 

171
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:33,820
and the subjective senses of false hood.
It's like I've just stepped off to solid

172
00:11:35,421 --> 00:11:38,510
ground and onto something that doesn't 
support me well,

173
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,450
and it,
it feels like a self betrayal.

174
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,284
So that's existential inauthenticity.
You can feel it right away and then the 

175
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:47,870
rule is shut up.
If that happens,

176
00:11:47,871 --> 00:11:48,704
stop talking and then feel around and 
see if you can find some words that you 

177
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:57,130
say in that situation that don't produce
that sensation.

178
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,173
And it's like,
you see this played out in different 

179
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:02,770
forms of drama.
So there's,

180
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,420
there's a scene in the Lord of the 
rings,

181
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:08,320
for example,
where I believe it's Gollum and Bilbo,

182
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,800
it's the Lord of the rings.
It's,

183
00:12:12,801 --> 00:12:13,611
yeah,
it's bill boats,

184
00:12:13,611 --> 00:12:14,444
Lord of the rings,
not the hobbit because the hobbits 

185
00:12:15,321 --> 00:12:15,981
Frodo,
right?

186
00:12:15,981 --> 00:12:18,350
So it's Bilbo there.
I've got it wrong.

187
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,120
So the other way around,
okay,

188
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,360
so gollum and Frodo,
yes,

189
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,373
are going across the swamp and the swamp
is full of essentially full of dead 

190
00:12:28,401 --> 00:12:29,234
Saul's.
And they have to step very carefully in 

191
00:12:31,491 --> 00:12:32,324
order to not fall off the track.
And the stones are sort of hidden 

192
00:12:34,311 --> 00:12:35,144
underneath the surface.
And the implication there is that in 

193
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,640
order to follow a trail property,
you have to pick your,

194
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,013
your ground very carefully and you have 
to test it to see if it's solid or 

195
00:12:44,511 --> 00:12:47,540
you'll slip off into this.
Well essentially what it is is chaos.

196
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,374
You'll slip off into chaos.
And that's a dramatic representation of 

197
00:12:52,281 --> 00:12:54,770
what I'm,
what I'm suggesting to you,

198
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:57,840
it's like all you have to do is notice,
but,

199
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,510
and you have to pay attention.
And so,

200
00:12:59,511 --> 00:13:00,344
so to some degree what you're doing in 
fact is you're making your capacity to 

201
00:13:03,231 --> 00:13:07,280
pay attention,
super ordinate to your capacity to think

202
00:13:07,281 --> 00:13:08,890
and to speak.
Cause you,

203
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,733
you know,
you might ask yourself while exactly 

204
00:13:10,881 --> 00:13:11,714
what are you,
while I said you can identify yourself 

205
00:13:13,371 --> 00:13:15,800
with your intellect and that's very,
very common.

206
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,070
It's sort of like the worst sin of 
intelligent people,

207
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,760
but that isn't all you are.
And there are lots of reasons for making

208
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:29,270
the assumption that attention is a 
higher order function than intellect.

209
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,640
Because attention is what teaches 
intellect.

210
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,670
So if by,
if you pay very,

211
00:13:34,671 --> 00:13:39,410
very careful attention to what you say 
without having the automatic,

212
00:13:39,411 --> 00:13:40,244
without bringing the automatic 
assumption that what you say is you to 

213
00:13:43,641 --> 00:13:46,550
bear on the conversation and then also 
to feel like you have to defend it.

214
00:13:46,551 --> 00:13:47,384
Once you say it,
you'll find very rapidly that very much 

215
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:51,980
of what you think can say has absolutely
nothing to do with you.

216
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,833
It's just,
it's the dead souls that are in that 

217
00:13:56,571 --> 00:13:57,404
little scene that I described to you,
sort of manifesting themselves in your 

218
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:01,274
head.
They're dead ideas that other people 

219
00:14:02,421 --> 00:14:05,270
have created and some of them might be 
applicable to you.

220
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,133
You know,
you might have the right to them so to 

221
00:14:08,091 --> 00:14:08,924
speak,
but lots of the malt and you're using 

222
00:14:10,911 --> 00:14:11,744
the words as camouflage or self defense 
or as an attempt to attain status and 

223
00:14:16,101 --> 00:14:19,130
the status hierarchy or to make yourself
look smarter than you are.

224
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:19,963
Or there's all sorts of reasons or,
or to hide what you think from other 

225
00:14:23,181 --> 00:14:24,014
people.
I see this and undergraduate essays all 

226
00:14:25,641 --> 00:14:26,474
the time.
So cause the essays are full of cliches 

227
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,310
and you know,
it's not all that obvious.

228
00:14:31,311 --> 00:14:34,250
Why a cliche is a bad thing,
but it cliche is a bad thing.

229
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,610
In the same way that being possessed by 
the dead is a bad thing.

230
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,870
It's like a cliche isn't you?
It's something else.

231
00:14:41,871 --> 00:14:43,970
It's like the crowd.
It's like the other,

232
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,710
it's,
it's not living.

233
00:14:45,711 --> 00:14:48,860
It has nothing to do with you.
And part of the reason that students use

234
00:14:48,861 --> 00:14:49,694
cliches is because it's easier than 
using your own genuine creative 

235
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:58,610
formulation.
So you can just default to cliche use.

236
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,623
But there's something more insidious 
than that is that if you write an essay 

237
00:15:02,271 --> 00:15:06,110
that's nothing but a string of cliches 
and you get criticized,

238
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,330
then you're not being criticized.

239
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:13,300
What's being criticized is the cliches.
And you can hide behind that and the the

240
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,280
part of you that's wise.
But,

241
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,840
but,
but treacherous thinks,

242
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,760
well,
the criticism doesn't really apply to me

243
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:20,870
because,
you know,

244
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,290
I didn't really say what I thought.
And then there's this kind of sense,

245
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,760
you get that you've gotten away with 
something,

246
00:15:25,761 --> 00:15:28,600
which is a terrible thing.
So when I read undergraduate essays,

247
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,330
what I see very frequently is,
especially the first essay,

248
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:33,560
it's just nothing but cliches.
It's awful.

249
00:15:33,561 --> 00:15:34,850
It's,
it's dull.

250
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:39,020
You can hardly stand reading it because 
there's nothing in it that's gripping or

251
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:39,854
alive.
And then maybe the second essay you can 

252
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:42,614
see there's a layer of cliche and then 
now and then the person will be brave 

253
00:15:46,401 --> 00:15:49,190
enough to poke up a thought of their 
own.

254
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:52,250
It'll just sort of poke up somewhere,
maybe in three pages in,

255
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:53,084
it's like this little green shoot that's
barely alive and the person is brave 

256
00:15:57,561 --> 00:15:59,870
enough to pop it up in the hope that you
know,

257
00:15:59,871 --> 00:16:02,390
maybe it won't get wall up down with a 
sledge hammer.

258
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,090
And so one of the things I tried to do 
is to point that out.

259
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:05,691
It's like,
look,

260
00:16:05,691 --> 00:16:07,160
you know,
this is something,

261
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,590
there's a real thought here.
It's a real original thought.

262
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:11,990
It's something that you have the right 
to cause.

263
00:16:11,991 --> 00:16:12,824
It's derived from your own experience 
and your own knowledge and you 

264
00:16:15,111 --> 00:16:18,410
formulated it in an original and 
compelling way.

265
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,310
But the problem with that is that if you
get criticized for that,

266
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,680
you're just going to pull right back 
into your shell.

267
00:16:24,681 --> 00:16:25,514
Right?
Cause that hurts because it's actually 

268
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:27,734
part of you that you've exposed.
And that's a terrifying thing to expose 

269
00:16:30,891 --> 00:16:31,910
yourself like that.
But it's,

270
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,950
it's,
it's an absolute prerequisite to genuine

271
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,550
communication and thought.
So

272
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,033
the ancient Mesopotamians,
I haven't got time to tell you this 

273
00:16:45,411 --> 00:16:48,950
story if you want to hear it,
you can come to my maps of meaning class

274
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,023
in your fourth year,
but the most ancient Mesopotamians had 

275
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:55,350
figured out 5,000 years ago or so that 
the,

276
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,443
the highest God in the hierarchy of God,
so sorta like the highest value or the 

277
00:17:00,441 --> 00:17:04,700
thing that should be imitated most 
carefully was a god that whose,

278
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,530
whose head had eyes all the way around 
it and who spoke magic words.

279
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:13,220
And so the words he spoke could make the
sunrise and make the sunset very,

280
00:17:13,221 --> 00:17:14,054
very powerful speaker.
And the reason the Mesopotamians had 

281
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:18,584
figured this out to,
to the degree they had was because they 

282
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:22,850
realized that the capacity to pay 
attention,

283
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:26,360
which is the eyes of course,
because we really pay attention with her

284
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:27,194
eyes.
And then the capacity to speak 

285
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:30,560
properties,
in fact the highest virtue.

286
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,293
And so then you can check yourself.
You can see all you have to do is 

287
00:17:34,581 --> 00:17:35,414
listen.
Like you would listen to someone else 

288
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,570
and you have to feel,
you think,

289
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,650
do I actually believe that?
Is that actually my thought?

290
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,693
And really I'll tell you what you'll 
find is 95% of what you say has nothing 

291
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:48,464
to do with you.
So it's quite shocking to do this 

292
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:52,980
because you'll start to say something 
and you'll think,

293
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,413
oh that doesn't feel quite right.
Like it doesn't make me feel solid when 

294
00:17:57,961 --> 00:17:58,794
I say it.
There's something about that that I'm 

295
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:03,510
subordinating myself to something or 
hiding in some way.

296
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,970
It's very difficult to figure out 
exactly what you're doing,

297
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:10,500
but you'll find out that
almost everything that's

298
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:15,250
abstractly represented right,
it has to be that way.

299
00:18:15,251 --> 00:18:18,040
Cause you guys are also young.
So in some sense,

300
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,950
you know way more than you can actually 
know,

301
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,080
right?
You've been taught all these things,

302
00:18:23,081 --> 00:18:26,830
but you don't know them.
They're just in your head.

303
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,993
In fact,
they have you rather than the other way 

304
00:18:29,231 --> 00:18:31,210
around.
It's like Carl Jung said,

305
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,780
people don't have ideas,
ideas have people.

306
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:38,620
And that's something to really think 
about because then you want to watch and

307
00:18:38,621 --> 00:18:39,454
see what ideas there are floating around
in your head and start to figure out 

308
00:18:42,341 --> 00:18:45,820
where they came from because it's highly
probable that they're controlling you.

309
00:18:45,821 --> 00:18:49,990
Just like a Marionette is controlled by 
the puppeteer.

310
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,393
It's very,
very similar and there's an 

311
00:18:53,561 --> 00:18:54,394
inauthenticity about that.
And so that brings us into 

312
00:18:56,351 --> 00:18:57,184
existentialism.
So now I want to talk to you a little 

313
00:18:58,481 --> 00:18:59,314
bit about existentialists because 
existentialists are very concerned with 

314
00:19:02,381 --> 00:19:03,310
authenticity.

315
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,910
And so you could say that above all 
else,

316
00:19:06,911 --> 00:19:10,120
existentialists are concerned with 
truth.

317
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:11,883
Now of course we know that it's not very
easy to define exactly what constitutes 

318
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:16,864
truth.
And I would also say there are various 

319
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,810
definitions of truth that can be used 
for different purposes.

320
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,510
You know,
cause your definitions of truth can also

321
00:19:25,511 --> 00:19:27,970
have a tool,
light function and,

322
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:28,983
and,
and finally that we can't come up with 

323
00:19:30,491 --> 00:19:35,491
an ultimate definition of truth because 
we're not infinitely informed,

324
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,993
right?
So ignorance is going to underlie our 

325
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:39,844
claims all the time,
but that doesn't eradicate the validity 

326
00:19:43,901 --> 00:19:47,560
of the concept of truth.
And I think one of the ways you can deal

327
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,394
with that existentially is that you may 
not be able to determine what's true at 

328
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:52,774
any given moment,
but it's quite a different matter to 

329
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:57,970
determine what's false.
That's a lot easier.

330
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,740
So one of the things I often tell my 
clients,

331
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:00,521
for example,
is,

332
00:20:00,521 --> 00:20:02,740
uh,
here,

333
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,120
here's the way to clean up your life.

334
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:11,730
Stop doing the things that you know are 
wrong that you could stop doing.

335
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:13,691
Right?
So it's,

336
00:20:13,691 --> 00:20:15,900
it's a fairly,
it's a fairly limited attempt.

337
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,743
First of all,
we're not going to say that you know 

338
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,430
what the good is or what the truth is in
any ultimate sense.

339
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:22,563
But we will presume that there are 
things that you're doing that for one 

340
00:20:24,581 --> 00:20:25,600
reason or another,
you know,

341
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:26,434
are not in your best interests.
There's something about them that you 

342
00:20:28,481 --> 00:20:31,540
just know you should stop.
There are kind of self evident to you.

343
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,880
Other things you're going to be doubtful
of it about.

344
00:20:33,881 --> 00:20:36,880
You're not going to know which way is up
in which way is down.

345
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,780
But there are things that you're doing 
that you know you shouldn't do.

346
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,033
Now,
some of those you won't stop doing for 

347
00:20:43,751 --> 00:20:45,430
whatever reason.
You don't have the discipline.

348
00:20:45,431 --> 00:20:47,080
Or maybe there's a secondary pay off.

349
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,273
You don't believe it's necessary or it's
too much of a sacrifice or you're angry 

350
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,650
or resentful or or afraid,
who knows?

351
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,513
So forget about those for now.
But there's another subset that you 

352
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,860
could stop doing.
It might be little thing.

353
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:03,340
Well that's fine.
Stop doing it and see what happens.

354
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,623
And what will happen is your vision will
clear a little bit and then something 

355
00:21:08,381 --> 00:21:13,060
else will pop up in your field of 
apprehension that you will also know you

356
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:13,894
should stop doing and that you could 
stop doing because you strengthened 

357
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:17,284
yourself a bit by stopping doing the 
particular stupid thing that you were 

358
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:22,030
doing before that just puts you together
a little bit more.

359
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:27,390
And you could do that repeatedly for,
for an indefinite period of time.

360
00:21:27,761 --> 00:21:29,260
And,
and you know,

361
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,123
that doesn't necessarily mean that 
you're going to ever be able to 

362
00:21:32,021 --> 00:21:37,021
formulate a clear and final picture of 
what constitutes the truth and the good.

363
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,463
But it does mean that you'll be able to 
continually move away from what's 

364
00:21:41,261 --> 00:21:44,280
untruth.
And what's bad and you know,

365
00:21:44,281 --> 00:21:45,550
well,
that's not a bad start.

366
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:46,961
Now.
Soldier,

367
00:21:46,961 --> 00:21:49,630
an incident who will talk a lot about in
the next lecture,

368
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,913
Solzhenitsyn was a great Russian writer.
He wrote a book called the Gulag 

369
00:21:53,651 --> 00:21:54,484
archipelago,
which was instrumental in bringing down 

370
00:21:55,931 --> 00:21:59,380
the Soviet Union and Solzhenitsyn,
like Viktor Frankl,

371
00:21:59,381 --> 00:22:02,680
who you'll also read,
was very much convinced that the reason,

372
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:06,010
the horrors of the Soviet Union and of 
the,

373
00:22:06,011 --> 00:22:09,640
of Nazi Germany and of Mao's China and 
various other places around the world,

374
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:12,850
he was very convinced that the reason 
those horrors took place,

375
00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:13,684
the death and torture of hundreds of 
millions of people was because the 

376
00:22:16,811 --> 00:22:17,644
individuals that made up that those 
societies were inauthentic in their own 

377
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,653
use of of thought and speech.
And so it isn't a following orders 

378
00:22:27,671 --> 00:22:29,350
theory.
It's not that at all.

379
00:22:29,351 --> 00:22:30,184
It's a bottom up pathology theory.
It's the reason the whole state is 

380
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:37,690
pathological is because the individuals 
that compose it are pathological,

381
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,780
not because they're good and following 
orders.

382
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,863
So

383
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,980
I believe that.
I believe that to be the case.

384
00:22:46,981 --> 00:22:47,814
I do believe that the catastrophes of 
the state are a consequence of the 

385
00:22:53,131 --> 00:22:56,640
amalgamated pathologies of the 
individuals,

386
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:57,474
especially they're willful blindness.
And so another thing that you might 

387
00:23:01,351 --> 00:23:03,840
think about,
because most young people do think about

388
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:04,674
this,
is what is it that you can do in order 

389
00:23:07,441 --> 00:23:08,274
to

390
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:11,703
aid the world?
Let's say like you might if you were 

391
00:23:13,211 --> 00:23:15,130
thinking about being an 
environmentalist.

392
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,140
Oh,
as far as I can tell,

393
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,860
the one sure.
Route to aiding the world is to clean up

394
00:23:20,861 --> 00:23:24,460
your existential space.
First of all,

395
00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:26,170
you're not telling anyone else what to 
do.

396
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,010
That's a big plus and second.
Well,

397
00:23:30,011 --> 00:23:30,844
the more you do that,
the more you're going to be able to do 

398
00:23:33,401 --> 00:23:34,630
things,
you know?

399
00:23:34,631 --> 00:23:35,680
And so you might think,
well,

400
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:36,514
if you're going to clean up the world,
you might start by cleaning up your 

401
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,200
phenomenal logical space and see how far
you get with that.

402
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,000
It's a difficult thing to do,
but if you do it,

403
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,063
the better you get at it,
the more capable you are of of handling 

404
00:23:51,951 --> 00:23:54,800
larger and larger problems.
And that's how you should start.

405
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:59,801
You should start with what's right in 
your grasp and with what you can control

406
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:03,260
and not,
that'll enables you to practice.

407
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,220
Now.
And here's the,

408
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,510
here's an offshoot of this.
This is an existential offshoot.

409
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,423
So here's a hypothesis.
So you imagine the existentialists 

410
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,533
continually claim,
unlike the psychoanalysts that people 

411
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:16,723
are psychopathological not because say 
of childhood trauma or neurosis or 

412
00:24:22,101 --> 00:24:23,960
repression or,
or,

413
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:24,973
uh,
failure to integrate elements of the Ed 

414
00:24:26,811 --> 00:24:27,644
into the ego.
They existentialist claim that the 

415
00:24:29,781 --> 00:24:30,614
reason that people are 
psychopathological is because the 

416
00:24:33,111 --> 00:24:33,944
conditions of existence are so tragic 
that it's inevitable that people become 

417
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:39,590
psychopathological.
Right?

418
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:41,480
And that's okay.
So what's the argument?

419
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:44,720
Well,
people are self conscious,

420
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,610
so that's a big problem.
So,

421
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,640
and because we're self conscious,
we know that we're going to die.

422
00:24:49,641 --> 00:24:50,474
We're aware of our temporal limitations.
So that's our real catastrophe because 

423
00:24:54,261 --> 00:24:55,094
no other animal has that problem.
Like elephants looked like they've got 

424
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,350
kind of a dim apprehension of it,
but they're not articulate.

425
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:03,170
So they can't really get to the final 
stage of,

426
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,423
you know,
assessing their existence in 

427
00:25:06,261 --> 00:25:08,720
relationship to its,
its finitude.

428
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:09,823
And of course everyone knows that 
they're prone to illness of all sorts 

429
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,970
and aging and that,
you know,

430
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:20,050
so is everyone else they know and that 
you can be damaged in comprehensively by

431
00:25:20,871 --> 00:25:23,570
untruth and by false hood and bye bye 
betrayal.

432
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:24,560
You know?
And then,

433
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:29,270
and also that there's 150 things wrong 
with you that you're acutely aware of at

434
00:25:29,271 --> 00:25:30,710
almost all times.
So you,

435
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,693
you fall short of perfection along 
pretty much any access of comparison 

436
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,433
that you wish to generate.
And so the existential point of view on 

437
00:25:40,011 --> 00:25:40,844
that is that all of that's enough to 
make the default condition of human 

438
00:25:43,671 --> 00:25:46,460
beings.
Psychopathological.

439
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:47,743
It's like the weight of existence itself
is sufficient to make normal 

440
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,610
pathological.
And,

441
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,580
and it's a very powerful,
it's very powerful argument.

442
00:25:58,581 --> 00:25:59,414
Cause one of the things you might ask,
and it's certainly something I've asked 

443
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:05,270
when I've dealt with people who have ag 
or a phobia for example,

444
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,770
who are afraid to go out.

445
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,433
You know,
they're afraid to go up because they 

446
00:26:08,781 --> 00:26:09,614
might have a heart attack and then that 
there'll be too far away from the 

447
00:26:11,271 --> 00:26:12,920
hospital and then they'll die.
Well,

448
00:26:12,921 --> 00:26:13,754
they make fools of themselves.
That's basically the agoraphobic 

449
00:26:16,131 --> 00:26:19,280
spheres.
So it's biological mortality plus social

450
00:26:19,281 --> 00:26:20,240
exposure,
right?

451
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,133
It's bad enough to die,
but if you die in public while 

452
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:25,610
everyone's looking at you,
then you know,

453
00:26:25,611 --> 00:26:27,830
you get the worst of both worlds.
And it is,

454
00:26:27,831 --> 00:26:28,664
to me,
it's not such a mystery that people are 

455
00:26:29,811 --> 00:26:33,170
agoraphobic.
It's a mystery that other people aren't,

456
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,591
you know?
And,

457
00:26:34,591 --> 00:26:39,050
and from the existential point of view,
the mystery starts to become the,

458
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:44,680
the ubiquity of normality given the 
intolerable conditions of existence.

459
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,910
It's a much more powerful viewpoint.
And I think it's correct to,

460
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:52,911
because there's no reason to assume that
the default condition of mankind is like

461
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,030
calm,
rational acceptance of fate.

462
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,013
It's like you have to very,
very specific conditions that you're in 

463
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,570
before you're calm and,
and,

464
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,061
and,
and,

465
00:27:03,061 --> 00:27:03,894
you know,
feeling comfortable and sort of hopeful 

466
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:05,844
about the future.
It's like that's a rare state to 

467
00:27:07,081 --> 00:27:09,480
achieve.
We can assume that's normal,

468
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,793
at least to some degree in our society 
because it's unbelievably 

469
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:16,230
technologically sophisticated and we're 
not hungry that often.

470
00:27:16,231 --> 00:27:18,360
We're not cold that often,
or you know,

471
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,790
or even sick that often.
But to think of that is the norm.

472
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:23,180
It's like,
no,

473
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,630
no,
definitely not.

474
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:28,080
That's it's a miracle that it's ever 
like that.

475
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,833
Now the other claim the existentialists 
make fundamentally is something like 

476
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:34,434
this.
It's like,

477
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,053
well,
if the fundamental conditions of 

478
00:27:37,951 --> 00:27:42,300
existence are tragic at at minimum,
because there's worse,

479
00:27:42,301 --> 00:27:43,134
there's evil too,
which is different than tragedy because 

480
00:27:45,301 --> 00:27:47,640
evil is sort of like unnecessary 
tragedy,

481
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,680
you know,
cause there's earthquake say,

482
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,480
you know,
who are you going to blame about that?

483
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,583
But then there's you going to school and
you know there's four people who've got 

484
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:57,630
it out for you and all they do is pound 
you flat.

485
00:27:57,631 --> 00:27:58,464
Every time you,
you enter the building or make fun of 

486
00:28:00,031 --> 00:28:01,920
you and you know,
try to torture you to death.

487
00:28:01,921 --> 00:28:04,350
That's,
that's not tragedy.

488
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:06,350
That's,
it's not accident.

489
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:09,090
It's not your accidental subjugation to 
fate.

490
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,953
It's some horror show perpetrated on you
by people whose only goal is to make 

491
00:28:14,851 --> 00:28:17,640
sure that there's more suffering in the 
world rather than less.

492
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,653
So you also have to put up with that.
But we'll leave that aside for the time 

493
00:28:21,331 --> 00:28:22,164
being.
You're stuck in your pathology because 

494
00:28:24,991 --> 00:28:28,830
of the conditions of existence are 
intolerable to a self conscious being.

495
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,750
We'll say that.
So then you might ask,

496
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:33,180
well what could you do about that?
Well,

497
00:28:33,181 --> 00:28:34,014
here's one potential answer.
Not Answer is see what happens if you 

498
00:28:38,821 --> 00:28:42,810
stop doing things you know to be 
inadequate and wrong.

499
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:48,050
So the hypothesis is every time you 
engage in an activity like that,

500
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,500
you weaken yourself,
you put yourself down first,

501
00:28:51,501 --> 00:28:52,334
you remove your own self confidence,
but you also fail to take the 

502
00:28:55,551 --> 00:28:59,210
opportunity to expand your domain of 
competence.

503
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,970
What would life be like if you didn't do
that?

504
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,960
And the existential claim is it's,
it's,

505
00:29:08,961 --> 00:29:11,120
it's a,
it's a weak claim in some ways.

506
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:13,940
The claim is bots.
There's two.

507
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,060
One is,
if you don't do that,

508
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,820
if you don't try to fix the things that 
you could fix,

509
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,520
things will go from bad to worse for 
your life.

510
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:26,210
And that will spread out and it will 
take everyone else's life along with it.

511
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,580
So that,
so that's on the negative end.

512
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,830
So you don't do it because of the 
negative end.

513
00:29:30,831 --> 00:29:31,664
But then there's a positive claim to 
which is maybe if you stopped bullying 

514
00:29:35,721 --> 00:29:36,710
yourself,

515
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,463
the tragic conditions of existence would
become because you would be strong 

516
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:45,120
enough to tolerate them.
And,

517
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,353
and it's,
it's analogous to use idea of 

518
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,590
progression towards the self because 
young has a very strong,

519
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:57,850
is existential theme underlying his work
derived mostly from nature.

520
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,790
But it's,
it's the most optimistic.

521
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:05,820
It's the only optimistic hypothesis I've
ever seen in psychology.

522
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:08,463
Truly optimistic hypothesis because 
there's other hypotheses like the 

523
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,813
positive illusions hypothesis,
which is basically life is so tragic 

524
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:19,300
that you have to tell yourself,
you know,

525
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:23,290
happy false hoods just so you don't go 
insane.

526
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:27,310
And that's what normal people do,
which I think is an absolutely appalling

527
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,180
philosophy.
It's,

528
00:30:29,181 --> 00:30:31,450
it's,
it's the ultimate and cynicism that,

529
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:32,770
but still there,
you know,

530
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:33,623
there's a huge literature on the 
supposedly utility of positive 

531
00:30:36,071 --> 00:30:36,904
illusions.
And then there's also the associated 

532
00:30:38,861 --> 00:30:43,861
sort of terror management hypothesis,
which is that the purpose of your belief

533
00:30:44,231 --> 00:30:47,980
systems is to protect you from the 
anxiety of death,

534
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,023
which has sort of a variant of the 
Friday and idea that religion was a 

535
00:30:51,881 --> 00:30:52,714
childish delusion designed to protect 
people from terror of their own 

536
00:30:56,201 --> 00:30:57,034
mortality.

537
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:01,630
Very powerful critique of religion,
although it's one that I happen to think

538
00:31:01,631 --> 00:31:02,464
is wrong.
I mean one of the problems with Freud's 

539
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,820
formulation is that it fails to deal 
with,

540
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,430
you know,
concepts like the underworld and hell.

541
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,980
I mean,
if you're going to just whip up a belief

542
00:31:11,981 --> 00:31:14,830
system to protect yourself against the 
fear of death,

543
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:15,933
why in the world would you envision 
something like an eternity of suffering 

544
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:21,790
worse than death?
If you ever step out of line,

545
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,910
it's very hard to understand how that's 
a defense mechanism.

546
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,470
Now,
a cynic would say,

547
00:31:26,471 --> 00:31:27,304
well,
the only reason that say Christians 

548
00:31:28,301 --> 00:31:30,460
invented hell,
even though they didn't,

549
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:33,850
it's a very old idea,
is so that they had somewhere convenient

550
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:35,440
to put people who didn't agree with 
them.

551
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:40,390
But you have to be unbelievably cynical 
to assume that that's the only reason I,

552
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,253
I don't think there's any historical 
support for the idea that that's the 

553
00:31:43,991 --> 00:31:44,824
only reason.

554
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,263
Now I'm going to tell you some,
I'm going to tell you some stories that 

555
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,283
some of the most famous existentialists 
and history told their their ideas and 

556
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,150
quotations and,
and I,

557
00:31:56,290 --> 00:32:00,370
the existentialists that I've read are 
often the most powerful of writers.

558
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:04,690
So Dostoyevsky's an existentialist and 
Solzhenitsyn and says an existentialist.

559
00:32:04,691 --> 00:32:08,980
And so as Viktor Frankl who survived the
concentration camps and Kierkegaard,

560
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:12,160
very weird collection of people,
I mean they're,

561
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,213
they're fundamental belief systems were 
often very much at odds with one 

562
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:16,834
another.
Some of them are atheists and some of 

563
00:32:17,651 --> 00:32:20,890
them are Orthodox Christians especially,
uh,

564
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,263
you know,
cause a lot of the literary 

565
00:32:23,381 --> 00:32:26,860
existentialists were Russian.
So you can come at existentialism from a

566
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:27,694
variety of origin points.
But what they have in common is what I 

567
00:32:30,821 --> 00:32:31,654
kind of outlined is that the first idea 
is the essential preconditions of life 

568
00:32:35,261 --> 00:32:39,590
are sufficiently tragic to render the 
normative state of humanity,

569
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,573
pathological and,
and health something as something and 

570
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:45,980
health and wholeness is something very 
difficult to,

571
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,790
to uh,
aspire to or accomplish.

572
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:54,791
And that and that the road to that 
health is the reduction of deceit.

573
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:56,443
And so that's a thing that's also very 
interesting about the existentialist 

574
00:32:58,461 --> 00:32:59,330
cause they make a very

575
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:04,510
straightforward moral claim,
which is that lies make people sick.

576
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:05,523
And I'll,
I'll tell you in my experience as a 

577
00:33:07,091 --> 00:33:08,260
psychotherapist,
I mean,

578
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,453
you know,
I can tell you some of the things that 

579
00:33:10,391 --> 00:33:11,224
make people sick,
a lot of them have nothing to do with 

580
00:33:13,571 --> 00:33:16,970
the psyche.
The things that make people sick,

581
00:33:16,971 --> 00:33:17,804
car while they get unemployed.
It's like unemployment just lays people 

582
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:22,084
out,
especially if they're conscientious and 

583
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,960
they just devour themselves.
And it's so stressful,

584
00:33:25,961 --> 00:33:27,100
right?
Cause if you're unemployed,

585
00:33:27,101 --> 00:33:31,150
well your finances become shaky almost 
right away.

586
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,073
Plus you don't have any routine.
Plus you're not involved in anything 

587
00:33:34,601 --> 00:33:37,060
meaningful in relationship to society.
You know?

588
00:33:37,061 --> 00:33:39,730
And then you start to eat yourself up 
with doubts and,

589
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,200
and,
and,

590
00:33:41,201 --> 00:33:41,831
uh,
you know,

591
00:33:41,831 --> 00:33:42,664
self criticism,
especially if you're a conscientious 

592
00:33:44,621 --> 00:33:45,454
person or especially if you're a 
conscientious person who's high in 

593
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:50,890
negative emotion.
It's like unemployment will just flatten

594
00:33:50,891 --> 00:33:55,891
you and then the death or illness of 
yourself or close relative,

595
00:33:56,081 --> 00:33:58,540
that's really hard on people.
And uh,

596
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,413
there and there were situations at work 
that are difficult so people are 

597
00:34:05,731 --> 00:34:07,920
bullied.
Maybe they have a terrible supervisor or

598
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:08,993
they're,
or they're in a pathological social 

599
00:34:10,861 --> 00:34:12,340
structure so that,
you know,

600
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,263
they're basically being bullied and 
oppressed with every step they take or 

601
00:34:16,231 --> 00:34:18,000
they're in a very horrendous 
relationship.

602
00:34:18,001 --> 00:34:20,640
But,
but then things start to turn a bit.

603
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,810
So,
okay,

604
00:34:21,811 --> 00:34:22,644
so you can lose your job and you can be 
ill or dying and so can people around 

605
00:34:27,121 --> 00:34:29,490
you.
And that'll lay low on a lot of the time

606
00:34:29,491 --> 00:34:30,330
and no wonder,
right?

607
00:34:30,331 --> 00:34:31,630
It's logical.
And when,

608
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:35,370
when people come to me with those sorts 
of problems,

609
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,890
the first thing I often notice,
they're not psychological.

610
00:34:37,891 --> 00:34:40,290
I tell the people that that's not a 
psychological problem.

611
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:43,410
You're unemployed.
That's an actual problem.

612
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,840
And it's really useful to distinguish 
those.

613
00:34:45,841 --> 00:34:47,160
Right?
So,

614
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,023
so for example,
and this is something that psychiatric 

615
00:34:49,831 --> 00:34:51,630
diagnosis does it very,
very badly.

616
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,033
If someone comes to me and they're 
depressed so they're not sleeping 

617
00:34:55,981 --> 00:34:57,630
properly,
they feel terrible in the morning,

618
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:58,501
you know,
they,

619
00:34:58,501 --> 00:35:00,150
they,
they don't have a lot of energy.

620
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:03,630
They're having a hard time experiencing 
any positive emotion.

621
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,780
It's difficult for them to move.
Um,

622
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:06,723
and they have a lot of negative thoughts
about the past and the present and the 

623
00:35:08,761 --> 00:35:09,594
future.
I do an analysis of their life first to 

624
00:35:11,641 --> 00:35:12,091
say,
well,

625
00:35:12,091 --> 00:35:13,770
you know,
you have a job that's,

626
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,200
you know,
all right that,

627
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,670
you know,
that did at least isn't horrifying.

628
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:18,773
You know,
is it okay for you to go to work in the 

629
00:35:19,681 --> 00:35:20,514
morning?
Do you have an intimate relationship 

630
00:35:21,721 --> 00:35:25,350
that's basically functional d,
do you have some friends you know,

631
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:26,243
um,
are your relationships with your family 

632
00:35:27,571 --> 00:35:28,860
members?
Okay?

633
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:32,010
Are you reasonably healthy apart,
apart from the depression?

634
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:36,060
And do you have useful and interesting 
things to do that aren't related to your

635
00:35:36,061 --> 00:35:36,894
career?

636
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,003
And if the person says yes to all of 
those and they're still feeling 

637
00:35:39,991 --> 00:35:40,890
terrible,
then I think,

638
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:42,690
okay,
this person is depressed.

639
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,750
Right?
Because they don't have a problem.

640
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,870
They're just depressed.
And in my experience,

641
00:35:48,871 --> 00:35:52,230
those are the people who respond quite 
well to antidepressants.

642
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,483
You know,
cause their nervous system isn't 

643
00:35:54,331 --> 00:35:55,164
calibrating.
It's an analysis of their situation to 

644
00:35:58,321 --> 00:35:59,154
the reality of the situation.
It's as if they're lower status 

645
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,473
according to their status.
Comparitor which is a very primordial 

646
00:36:05,911 --> 00:36:08,760
thing since even lobsters have it,
it's their status.

647
00:36:08,761 --> 00:36:11,880
Comparitor isn't paying attention to 
their actual status.

648
00:36:11,881 --> 00:36:13,770
And maybe that's because they're,
you know,

649
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,600
temperamentally high in negative 
emotion.

650
00:36:15,601 --> 00:36:19,260
Or maybe it's because they had been 
traumatized earlier in their life.

651
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:22,620
And so they're much more sensitive to 
any signs of failure.

652
00:36:22,621 --> 00:36:24,750
It's easy to,
it's easier to knock them down.

653
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,210
But then you have the other people who 
are,

654
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,303
well,
they don't have a job and they ha they 

655
00:36:31,951 --> 00:36:32,784
never have.
And maybe they're 30 or 35 no real 

656
00:36:35,881 --> 00:36:38,730
stable employment history,
no real educational history.

657
00:36:38,731 --> 00:36:42,030
It's pretty patchy.
One or more illnesses.

658
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:46,020
And then family members who are just out
for there,

659
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,283
absolute destruction,
like families can be unbelievably 

660
00:36:50,601 --> 00:36:51,434
pathological.
So they're in meshed in the familial 

661
00:36:53,331 --> 00:36:55,550
situation where for one reason or 
another,

662
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,610
as soon as they get up off the ground a 
little bit,

663
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,653
someone knocks them back down and so,
and then maybe they have a drug or 

664
00:37:03,201 --> 00:37:06,620
alcohol problem to go along with that.
Or they have a relationship with someone

665
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:07,663
who has a drug and alcohol problem or a 
mental illness and sometimes you see 

666
00:37:10,461 --> 00:37:13,310
people who have like all five of those 
things going on at the same time.

667
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:14,563
It's like

668
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:17,283
that's not precisely mental illness.
Now a lot of that's associated with 

669
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:23,500
deceit,
you know,

670
00:37:23,501 --> 00:37:24,334
they're entangled in relationships and 
in relationships with themselves that 

671
00:37:27,191 --> 00:37:31,600
are pathologically untrue.
So I've seen people,

672
00:37:31,601 --> 00:37:32,470
for example,
who

673
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,383
I've seen people who are in families 
where probably nothing they were ever 

674
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:44,100
told was true.
Like it was never just true.

675
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:48,450
It was always twisted and bent in some 
way by whoever was talking to them.

676
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,553
For the purposes of that person power or
domination or or positive illusion or 

677
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,064
delusion or something like all the 
communication within the family was 

678
00:37:58,951 --> 00:38:02,890
motivated.
And so there,

679
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,013
it's so awful to grow up in an 
environment like that because you can't 

680
00:38:06,781 --> 00:38:09,330
get a grip on what's real.
And then you know,

681
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:10,164
it can get worse than that in that the 
person will tell you that they love you 

682
00:38:12,721 --> 00:38:13,554
and they'll act all sweet,
but every time you do anything that's 

683
00:38:16,231 --> 00:38:17,064
even vaguely productive and useful,
they'll just criticize you to death and 

684
00:38:21,211 --> 00:38:23,190
all the wild telling you that they love 
you.

685
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:28,350
It's really horrible.
And that's all tangled up with deception

686
00:38:28,351 --> 00:38:28,980
and lies.

687
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:33,150
And it's a weird thing because if you 
look at the Freudian hypotheses,

688
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,313
you'll notice that Freud attributed an 
awful lot of psychopathology to 

689
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:37,960
repression,
right?

690
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,153
But I think the distinction between 
repression and self deception or deceit 

691
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:43,834
is very permeable.
It's like what's the difference between 

692
00:38:48,851 --> 00:38:52,300
repressing something and lying to 
yourself about it?

693
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:53,763
Well,
Freud would say often that repression 

694
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:57,490
occurs unconsciously,
but I really wonder about that.

695
00:38:57,491 --> 00:38:58,324
I think that what happens is that 
something happened or you did something 

696
00:39:01,931 --> 00:39:06,550
that you don't like and it's bothering 
you and you could think it through,

697
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,640
but you just decide not to.
You just don't think it through.

698
00:39:09,641 --> 00:39:12,310
So it's left vague and uncertain and you
know,

699
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:16,150
fairly emotionally salient,
but you just refuse to think it through.

700
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,313
And you practice doing that until you've
built up a habit of not thinking that 

701
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,130
through.
And then you forget that you've built up

702
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:24,880
the habit.

703
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,980
And then it's like,
it's being repressed unconsciously.

704
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:28,960
But I think that,
you know,

705
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,970
or at least you knew when you first did 
it.

706
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:34,090
And so you know,
when you meet people who are acting in a

707
00:39:34,091 --> 00:39:36,820
twisted in peculiar way,
and you ask yourself,

708
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,160
they're very manipulative.
Say you ask yourself,

709
00:39:39,161 --> 00:39:43,180
well do they know what they're doing?
The answer to that could be,

710
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:44,014
well,
no,

711
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,000
but another answer could be,
yeah,

712
00:39:46,001 --> 00:39:48,850
but they knew once,
they knew,

713
00:39:48,851 --> 00:39:51,460
when they made the decision to start 
acting like that,

714
00:39:51,461 --> 00:39:52,294
but after they did it a hundred times or
so and made it into an automatic 

715
00:39:55,181 --> 00:39:57,640
routine,
well then they forgot its origin.

716
00:39:57,641 --> 00:40:00,970
And now it runs autonomously.
And so now they don't know.

717
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:05,050
But they did know.
And so you know,

718
00:40:05,051 --> 00:40:05,884
this is the sort of point and this is 
the real point of the existentialists 

719
00:40:08,441 --> 00:40:09,274
were

720
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,083
clinical psychology and,
and the claims of morality start to 

721
00:40:15,181 --> 00:40:16,014
become very tightly aligned.
And it's something that the psychiatric 

722
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,930
and psychological industries,
so to speak,

723
00:40:21,931 --> 00:40:22,764
don't really tackle head on.
My experience has been that in these 

724
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,200
situations,
for example,

725
00:40:28,201 --> 00:40:29,034
where the person has five terrible 
things going on in their life that 

726
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:36,780
there's just deception twisted in and 
strewn in,

727
00:40:36,781 --> 00:40:39,750
all of that.
People are betraying each other.

728
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,970
There's no fidelity in the 
relationships.

729
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,550
There's no clear and genuine 
communication.

730
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,653
Everything's manipulation.
No one admits to what they're really up 

731
00:40:48,511 --> 00:40:49,291
to.
You know,

732
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:51,870
there's a lot of false and Saccharin 
love,

733
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,850
which has absolutely nothing to do with 
love.

734
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:55,830
It's all for appearance,
you know,

735
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:58,380
and you cannot be healthy in a situation
like that.

736
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,780
I don't think in my experience,
you know,

737
00:41:00,781 --> 00:41:03,860
apart from terrible luck cause you know,
you can get cancer,

738
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:06,120
diabetes or any number of awful things.

739
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:09,510
In my experience,
apart from the tragedies of life,

740
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:13,590
there is nothing that hurts people more 
than deception,

741
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:19,160
lies do people in,
and that's an existentialist claim.

742
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:22,930
The claim is first,
while life is basically unbearable.

743
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:25,260
That's an existential claim.
And then there's,

744
00:41:25,261 --> 00:41:26,094
there's the hope that with sufficient 
caution and attention and clarity of 

745
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,430
thought and speech,
you can match.

746
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,070
You can it,
you can,

747
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,933
you can master it to the point where you
could even accept the fact that it's 

748
00:41:37,551 --> 00:41:39,710
tragic.
But if you multiply,

749
00:41:39,711 --> 00:41:42,500
it's tragedy with the use of deceit.
It's like,

750
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:45,710
forget it because you know,
it's one thing to be hurt,

751
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,270
you know,
maybe you break your leg.

752
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:50,360
That's one thing.
It's another thing to be attacked by two

753
00:41:50,361 --> 00:41:51,194
or three people who break your leg and 
do everything they can to demean you at 

754
00:41:54,201 --> 00:41:57,500
the same time.
It's like lots of people break their leg

755
00:41:57,501 --> 00:41:58,334
and they're not traumatized.
It's very few people who can go through 

756
00:42:00,891 --> 00:42:03,860
the ladder experience without being,
you know,

757
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:06,290
seriously and permanently damaged.

758
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,433
Here's Pascal,
one of the first existentialists when I 

759
00:42:13,381 --> 00:42:14,214
considered the brief span of my life,
swallowed up in the eternity before and 

760
00:42:17,611 --> 00:42:18,444
behind it,
the small space that I feel or even see 

761
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:25,140
engulfed in the infinite immensity of 
spaces,

762
00:42:25,141 --> 00:42:27,540
which I know not and which,
no,

763
00:42:27,541 --> 00:42:28,374
not me.
I am afraid and I wonder to see myself 

764
00:42:32,251 --> 00:42:33,084
here rather than there for,
there's no reason why I should be here 

765
00:42:37,081 --> 00:42:40,500
rather than there or now rather than 
then.

766
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,770
Now another thing the existentialists do
that's,

767
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,840
that's very,
and they're Romantics,

768
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:50,130
they're not enlightenment rationalist.
And part of the reason they're romantics

769
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:53,010
is because they actually don't believe 
that life is rational.

770
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,153
And Pascal's comment on on what what the
existentialists often called thrownness 

771
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,150
is a description of the fundamental 
irrationality of life.

772
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,013
It's like,
okay,

773
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,180
here you are.
Well,

774
00:43:06,181 --> 00:43:07,770
why you?
Why here?

775
00:43:07,771 --> 00:43:09,960
Why now?
Why the way you look,

776
00:43:09,961 --> 00:43:12,930
why with your family,
why you're gender?

777
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,573
Well,
there's no answer to any of those 

778
00:43:15,091 --> 00:43:16,110
questions.
It's just

779
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:21,880
how it is.
It's blind and random chance.

780
00:43:21,881 --> 00:43:22,714
Maybe there's this,
but even if it's not that there's 

781
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:25,234
something arbitrary about,
and there's something that's arbitrary 

782
00:43:28,451 --> 00:43:31,540
and not self evidently just or fair,
you know,

783
00:43:31,541 --> 00:43:33,580
cause maybe you could've been born,
you know,

784
00:43:33,581 --> 00:43:37,210
there are people around the world who 
make their living in garbage heaps,

785
00:43:37,211 --> 00:43:38,044
right?
So there's whole families and whole 

786
00:43:39,071 --> 00:43:42,910
societies that live out in the garbage 
dumps and all they do is pick out,

787
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:44,020
you know,
the,

788
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:48,570
the metal and glass that will enable 
them to sort of glean out of living.

789
00:43:48,571 --> 00:43:49,001
It's like,
well,

790
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,740
why the hell aren't you born there 
instead of,

791
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:51,940
you know,
sitting right here.

792
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:54,520
So there's an irrational element to 
that.

793
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,380
Right?
You can't justify it.

794
00:43:56,381 --> 00:43:59,530
You can't explain it and you don't 
really even know what to do about it.

795
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:00,573
Right.
I mean,

796
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:05,290
do you owe an existential debt to the 
people who were born much worse off than

797
00:44:05,291 --> 00:44:05,770
you?

798
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:09,070
Or is it just okay that it's that way?
Well,

799
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,560
it's a problem that that by the way,
is the problem,

800
00:44:11,561 --> 00:44:16,150
the existentialists called thrownness,
which is you're arbitrarily here in that

801
00:44:16,151 --> 00:44:18,730
form and there's no explanation for it 
and it,

802
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:19,703
and it,
it's something that's outside of human 

803
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:24,910
concepts of say justice and equity and 
fairness and,

804
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:25,893
and even sensibility.
And then Pascal also points to the fact 

805
00:44:29,261 --> 00:44:30,430
that,
well,

806
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:34,080
we're localized things.
You know,

807
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:38,910
you're right there and there's a lot of 
what isn't right there around you.

808
00:44:38,911 --> 00:44:39,744
So you're a small thing against a big 
infinitely large potential span of 

809
00:44:46,111 --> 00:44:46,944
experience.
And that's also an existential 

810
00:44:48,721 --> 00:44:51,570
challenge.
It's the challenge of the finite against

811
00:44:51,571 --> 00:44:52,920
the,
the infinite.

812
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:54,713
And that's also an existential problem,
which is that it isn't your problem or 

813
00:44:59,341 --> 00:45:01,830
it is,
it's more ad problem.

814
00:45:01,831 --> 00:45:04,200
It's just a problem that springs out of 
being human.

815
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:36,410
One of the places where existentialism 
and phenomenology touch

816
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:38,773
the phenomenologists of course,
make the case that reality is best 

817
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:46,070
conceived of as the totality of your 
experience,

818
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,060
even if that includes things that you 
wouldn't normally consider you.

819
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:50,983
But certainly it includes things like 
emotions and motivations and bodily 

820
00:45:53,631 --> 00:45:56,360
sensations and all the things that 
aren't precisely rational.

821
00:45:57,470 --> 00:45:58,303
The existentialists would take that 
claim and push it a bit farther by 

822
00:46:01,461 --> 00:46:02,294
saying,
and this is analogous to something I 

823
00:46:03,601 --> 00:46:04,790
already told you,
that

824
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:10,000
the degree to which that 
phenomenological field,

825
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:14,980
your field of experience is fractured 
and incoherent and paradoxical,

826
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:17,643
that that that occurs in pr,
precise proportion to the week to the 

827
00:46:21,671 --> 00:46:26,410
weakening of the spirit within you that 
necessarily has to be strong in order to

828
00:46:26,411 --> 00:46:29,860
remain on corrupted by the tragic 
conditions of existence.

829
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:31,023
So along with the existentialist claim,
which is that life is unbearable and 

830
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,093
it's in its very nature,
it's tragic and unbearable in its very 

831
00:46:38,471 --> 00:46:43,471
nature is the idea that that's made 
worse by your own set of inadequacies,

832
00:46:44,441 --> 00:46:45,274
inadequacies that you could repair and 
worse that to the degree that you are 

833
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,760
rife with inadequacies that you could 
repair,

834
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:52,773
you're going to make the tragic 
situation that's integral to life worse 

835
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,230
again,
not only for yourself but also for other

836
00:46:59,231 --> 00:47:00,064
people.
So out of existentialism also 

837
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:05,770
automatically arises a kind of moral 
necessity,

838
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:11,490
which is that you can't just sit in 
isolation and be useless and resentful.

839
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:14,493
That doesn't work.
If you're useless and resentful and you 

840
00:47:16,571 --> 00:47:19,300
refuse to address the things that you 
know you should address,

841
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:22,360
you can't help but pathologize 
everything around you,

842
00:47:23,350 --> 00:47:24,183
and so you're stuck with a moral duty.
And the existentialists would would say 

843
00:47:27,851 --> 00:47:28,990
more than that.
They would say,

844
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:35,910
if you don't
shoulder that existential burden,

845
00:47:37,931 --> 00:47:42,520
that existential moral burden,
you will inevitably suffer for it.

846
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:46,510
You cannot get out of it.
You're stuck with it.

847
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:48,363
So the existentialists are great 
believers in freewill in that you have 

848
00:47:51,761 --> 00:47:54,820
choice,
but the wheel has parameters,

849
00:47:54,821 --> 00:47:55,654
right?
There are still things that you can't 

850
00:47:56,261 --> 00:47:58,030
get away with,
and one of them is

851
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,473
you can't.
You fundamentally can't get away with 

852
00:48:02,341 --> 00:48:03,174
being immoral.
The structure of existence is set up 

853
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:07,713
well.
One of the things you might say if you 

854
00:48:09,371 --> 00:48:10,204
were thinking about it existentially is 
immoral things are precisely those 

855
00:48:13,751 --> 00:48:14,584
things that you can't get away with.
That's why people have identified them 

856
00:48:17,741 --> 00:48:18,574
as immoral is that they will inevitably,
the consequences of enacting will 

857
00:48:22,211 --> 00:48:27,040
inevitably be brought to bear on you or 
on the people you love for.

858
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:29,890
They'll,
it'll snap back in some way.

859
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:30,963
You know,
and I see this in psychotherapy very 

860
00:48:32,441 --> 00:48:33,274
often too,

861
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:43,100
people will engage in the same kind of 
behavior over and over.

862
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:43,973
Well,
there's a classic definition of 

863
00:48:44,451 --> 00:48:45,284
insanity,
which is insanity is doing the same 

864
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:50,090
thing over and over and expecting a 
different outcome each time.

865
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:52,580
And there's an element of self deception
in that.

866
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:54,890
Like people will

867
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:57,203
run out a procedure that ends in tragedy
and then they'll repeat that over and 

868
00:49:00,091 --> 00:49:00,924
over and you can lay out for them the 
causal connection between their actions 

869
00:49:04,891 --> 00:49:08,490
and their conceptions and outcome.
And they'll listen,

870
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,340
but there's no change whatsoever and 
behavior.

871
00:49:11,341 --> 00:49:13,890
And so then they run through the routine
again and bang.

872
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:14,993
And what they're doing is immoral 
precisely because whenever they 

873
00:49:18,631 --> 00:49:19,464
implemented it produces the kind of 
catastrophe they claim to want to avoid 

874
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,671
it.
Because you know,

875
00:49:23,671 --> 00:49:24,504
relativists martyred relativists like to
think of virality as something that's 

876
00:49:27,001 --> 00:49:29,220
just the arbitrary,
like it's a cultural construction.

877
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,940
You know,
and society one thinks that a is bad and

878
00:49:32,941 --> 00:49:36,150
society to thinks that B is bad.
And when you get right down to it,

879
00:49:36,151 --> 00:49:38,400
there's no commonality underneath all 
that.

880
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:41,400
But the existentialists sort of undercut
all that and they just say,

881
00:49:41,401 --> 00:49:42,234
well,

882
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:48,123
what's immoral?
Or those things that you could change 

883
00:49:49,901 --> 00:49:53,500
that you do that result in outcomes that
are catastrophic for you.

884
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:57,820
That's it.
That's what immoral is.

885
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,313
And so that's universal because it 
doesn't really matter what the details 

886
00:50:01,811 --> 00:50:02,591
are,
you know,

887
00:50:02,591 --> 00:50:06,610
like what you do that's immoral could be
very much different than what you do.

888
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:08,430
It might be temperamental,
you know,

889
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,080
we're each in our own playing field in a
sense.

890
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:13,120
But there's a commonality underneath 
that,

891
00:50:13,121 --> 00:50:14,860
which is,
well for example,

892
00:50:14,861 --> 00:50:16,750
you won't get away with deceiving 
yourself.

893
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:17,943
You just can't.
And the reason you can't is because you 

894
00:50:19,721 --> 00:50:21,940
need a model of the world.
It's like the world.

895
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:23,970
And if you try to live in a model of the
world,

896
00:50:23,971 --> 00:50:26,710
it isn't like the world,
you'll just bump into the world.

897
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:28,363
And so the the deception brings with it 
its own punishment and that's why it's 

898
00:50:31,641 --> 00:50:32,474
immoral.

899
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:44,650
There's other elements of existentialism
that I think are extremely interesting.

900
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:45,543
For example,
the definition of Truth and 

901
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:47,823
existentialism is,
is different than the definition of 

902
00:50:50,501 --> 00:50:53,530
truth that might be characteristic of 
objective materialism.

903
00:50:53,531 --> 00:50:58,531
So truths that are truths from the 
perspective of objective materialism are

904
00:50:58,901 --> 00:51:02,350
scientific truths and they're usually 
descriptive truths.

905
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:03,184
And so the truth claims of science go 
something like this all undertake a 

906
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,224
procedure,
which I'll tell you about and I'll 

907
00:51:10,541 --> 00:51:14,590
observe the outcomes.
And then if you undertake that procedure

908
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:17,950
and you observe the outcomes and 
outcomes are the same,

909
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:18,933
you know,
and we'll do this maybe a hundred times 

910
00:51:20,201 --> 00:51:24,850
just to be certain,
then we'll assume that what that outcome

911
00:51:24,851 --> 00:51:25,684
is is real.
So it's a definition of a procedure 

912
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:29,973
that's,
that's the experiment that elicits the 

913
00:51:31,541 --> 00:51:32,374
outcome and then the demonstration that 
the outcome is constant across 

914
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:38,440
observers.
So that's a lovely definition of truth.

915
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,273
And it obviously has extreme utility,
partly because it helps you separate 

916
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:43,833
subjective fantasy,
which is a form of reality from other 

917
00:51:46,871 --> 00:51:47,704
forms of realities.
So another form of reality would be 

918
00:51:49,661 --> 00:51:50,494
collectively apprehensible reality.
You don't want to confuse those two 

919
00:51:53,201 --> 00:51:53,951
things.
In fact,

920
00:51:53,951 --> 00:51:54,784
that's actually a sign of if not not 
naivety and a state of undeveloped 

921
00:52:02,261 --> 00:52:03,094
differentiation.
It can also be a sign of insanity 

922
00:52:04,451 --> 00:52:06,770
because one of the things say that 
characterizes schizophrenia,

923
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:07,623
this,
they can't tell the difference between 

924
00:52:08,801 --> 00:52:11,980
what only they experience and what 
everybody else experiences.

925
00:52:11,981 --> 00:52:16,090
So the scientific definition of truth is
a perfectly reasonable definition,

926
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:19,180
but it's not the existential definition 
of truth.

927
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:22,900
The existential definition of truth is 
more action predicated.

928
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:26,830
So for the existentialists truth is a 
way of being,

929
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:31,090
it's not a collection of descriptions.
So it's more,

930
00:52:31,091 --> 00:52:33,010
it's more embodied,
you know,

931
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:34,630
from the PSG and point of view.

932
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:37,390
And so truth is reflected in,
in what you act.

933
00:52:37,391 --> 00:52:39,250
So neat.
You would say for example,

934
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:44,500
it doesn't matter what you say,
it matters what you do.

935
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,660
And if I want to figure out what you 
believe,

936
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,240
I don't ask you,
I watch how you act.

937
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:54,550
And I assume that your true beliefs are 
those that are directing your actions.

938
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:59,230
And so truth is discovered in action.
And that's a very different claim.

939
00:52:59,350 --> 00:52:59,811
You know,
and it,

940
00:52:59,811 --> 00:53:00,644
it's,
it's not the claim of a passive 

941
00:53:01,721 --> 00:53:04,810
observer.
It's the claim of someone who's actively

942
00:53:04,811 --> 00:53:07,570
interacting with the world.
And of course we are always acting.

943
00:53:08,350 --> 00:53:11,470
We're always acting interactively with 
the world.

944
00:53:11,471 --> 00:53:12,304
And not only that,
if we don't act interactively with the 

945
00:53:15,491 --> 00:53:17,410
world,
we cease to exist.

946
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:20,200
So we have to do that merely to maintain
ourselves.

947
00:53:20,201 --> 00:53:25,150
And so the existential claim would be 
given that in our essential nature,

948
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:30,680
there are ways that you can act that are
in your improper Ndu.

949
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:36,720
Technically it's like for example,
let's say you want a,

950
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:38,423
and then you act in a bunch of ways that
makes it absolutely impossible that you 

951
00:53:41,341 --> 00:53:44,040
will get a,
it's like an existentialist would say,

952
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,740
well there's something wrong with that 
Schema.

953
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:48,090
Like it's a,
it's,

954
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:48,924
it's,
it's not necessarily a moral because 

955
00:53:51,331 --> 00:53:53,640
that would only be if you were willfully
blind to it.

956
00:53:53,641 --> 00:53:54,780
But they would certainly say,
well,

957
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,680
it's got this self contradictory element
that makes it wrong.

958
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,353
So,

959
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:07,080
so in so far it's like this in so far as
you're acting,

960
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:11,520
you're acting towards the name,
you want something and then in so far as

961
00:54:11,521 --> 00:54:13,830
you want something,
the fact that you want,

962
00:54:13,831 --> 00:54:18,831
it constitutes the framework within 
which you evaluate the utility and truth

963
00:54:19,981 --> 00:54:21,330
of your actions.
Right?

964
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:22,313
So it's like you come up with a theory 
of truth just because you're doing 

965
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:25,194
something and the theory is a that what 
you want is acceptable to want and you 

966
00:54:28,951 --> 00:54:30,810
know that can be true or not,
but it doesn't matter.

967
00:54:30,811 --> 00:54:31,644
You just assume that and be that
those things that will get you to that 

968
00:54:36,711 --> 00:54:40,760
and are appropriate.
You can't get out of that.

969
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:41,623
If you're doing something,
you're making a claim about the 

970
00:54:43,851 --> 00:54:46,250
structure of the world and what 
constitutes appropriate action.

971
00:54:46,251 --> 00:54:49,250
As soon as you make any action,
you can't get out of that.

972
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:52,913
Okay.

973
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:53,943
Nisha said,
can one live it all truths are bloody 

974
00:54:57,251 --> 00:54:58,084
truths to me and then that's an issue.
That's one of the things I really like 

975
00:55:01,571 --> 00:55:03,430
about reading the existentialists too.
It's not,

976
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:04,533
there's no,
there's no abstract disembodiment in 

977
00:55:07,151 --> 00:55:07,984
their philosophy.
You see that the people who are writing 

978
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:14,500
as existentialists are committed to what
they say they want to.

979
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:16,900
They want to enact what they say in the 
world.

980
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:18,303
It's,
and it's romantic because it does 

981
00:55:19,481 --> 00:55:23,470
involve emotions and motivation.
It see with reasoning alone,

982
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:24,453
enlightenment view of reason was that 
reason and the passions were 

983
00:55:27,551 --> 00:55:28,384
antagonistic,
that all the passions could do would be 

984
00:55:30,041 --> 00:55:34,330
to cloud reason and that it was reasons 
job to lift itself up above the body and

985
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,890
the emotions and clarified the nature of
the world.

986
00:55:36,891 --> 00:55:37,724
He,
the existentialists would deny that 

987
00:55:39,101 --> 00:55:40,090
completely.
They would say,

988
00:55:40,091 --> 00:55:40,421
no,
no,

989
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:43,300
no.
It's that the purpose,

990
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:47,860
the appropriate mode of being is to act 
properly.

991
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:51,190
And rationality can be a guide to that,
but can also,

992
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:53,860
it can also deceive and all sorts of 
ways.

993
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:58,360
The passions inform you.
They don't cloud your reasoning,

994
00:55:58,361 --> 00:56:01,390
although of course they can because they
tend to be kind of single minded.

995
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:03,040
You know,
they can take you off course,

996
00:56:03,490 --> 00:56:08,020
but that doesn't mean that they're 
enemies of rational clarity per se.

997
00:56:08,350 --> 00:56:09,183
And when the existentialists right,
you can tell they put their whole being 

998
00:56:13,541 --> 00:56:14,231
into it.
So it's,

999
00:56:14,231 --> 00:56:16,120
it's,
it's gripping and passionate.

1000
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:32,643
The existentialists.
I've also identified sort of classes of 

1001
00:56:36,491 --> 00:56:41,491
pathology that are unique in some ways.
They are outside the purview of standard

1002
00:56:42,651 --> 00:56:45,100
psychology and psychiatry.
So,

1003
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:48,203
okay.

1004
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,333
You,
you see often if you're looking at 

1005
00:56:50,481 --> 00:56:51,314
debate,
say between atheists and religious 

1006
00:56:52,371 --> 00:56:53,204
people,
one of the things that tends to set the 

1007
00:56:54,861 --> 00:56:55,694
atheist back on their heels is the 
observation that the religious people 

1008
00:56:58,191 --> 00:57:01,220
make that if there's no final meaning to
anything,

1009
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:04,700
then there's no meaning to anything.
And so that it immediately elicits,

1010
00:57:04,701 --> 00:57:08,750
it's a kind of nihilism.
It's like if nothing means anything,

1011
00:57:08,751 --> 00:57:09,584
why do anything?
And it's a reasonable argument because 

1012
00:57:11,481 --> 00:57:14,330
doing things requires effort and you can
say to yourself,

1013
00:57:14,331 --> 00:57:16,280
well,
why should I do x or y?

1014
00:57:16,281 --> 00:57:20,840
Especially if x is difficult.
If who the hell's going to know when the

1015
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,580
thousand years are,
who the hell is going to know where in a

1016
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:24,320
hundred years or why does it matter 
anyways?

1017
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:25,963
And then the atheist,
so tie themselves up in knots trying to 

1018
00:57:27,831 --> 00:57:30,860
address that issue.
But the existentialists take a different

1019
00:57:30,861 --> 00:57:32,090
perspective.
Nisha said,

1020
00:57:32,091 --> 00:57:32,924
for example,

1021
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,960
he was,
he viewed the emergence of nihilism as a

1022
00:57:36,961 --> 00:57:37,794
kind of cultural pathology.
And so you remember of course that it 

1023
00:57:40,261 --> 00:57:42,720
was Nietzsche who said God is dead,
right?

1024
00:57:42,721 --> 00:57:47,580
You see that scrolled out in like 
washroom graffiti from time to time.

1025
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:48,520
You know,
it's,

1026
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:48,961
it's,
it's,

1027
00:57:48,961 --> 00:57:51,420
it's like a truism,
but that isn't what Nisha said.

1028
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:52,283
He said,
God is dead and we have killed him and 

1029
00:57:53,551 --> 00:57:55,920
we'll never find enough water to wash 
away the blood,

1030
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:58,170
which is a very,
very different statement.

1031
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:01,410
It wasn't like he was proclaiming it 
triumphantly.

1032
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:05,250
It was more like a catastrophic loss of 
meaning,

1033
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:06,383
you know,
the sort of loss of meaning that the 

1034
00:58:07,051 --> 00:58:07,884
terror management theorists would say 
would produce like a traumatic 

1035
00:58:10,741 --> 00:58:11,574
pathology.

1036
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,400
Now what needs you observed was that 
there,

1037
00:58:15,401 --> 00:58:16,234
you know,
and of course you all know this to some 

1038
00:58:17,591 --> 00:58:19,840
degree,
that in the course of the development of

1039
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:20,863
scientific knowledge and rationality,
that a contradiction between our 

1040
00:58:24,281 --> 00:58:25,114
historical moral knowledge formulated 
and religious terms and our descriptive 

1041
00:58:28,721 --> 00:58:32,050
rational knowledge emerged conflict 
between science and religion.

1042
00:58:32,470 --> 00:58:33,303
Now,
part of that conflict is a losery 

1043
00:58:34,421 --> 00:58:35,254
because the purpose of religion is to 
tell you how to act and the purpose of 

1044
00:58:37,691 --> 00:58:38,524
science is to provide clear descriptions
of of what universally apprehensible 

1045
00:58:44,081 --> 00:58:44,914
reality.
They're not working in precisely the 

1046
00:58:46,061 --> 00:58:49,300
same domains.
It doesn't matter niches.

1047
00:58:49,330 --> 00:58:51,250
Observation was this,
he said,

1048
00:58:51,251 --> 00:58:52,084
well,
it's pretty clear that the scientific 

1049
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:58,480
lists are going to demolish the 
substructure of Western religious belief

1050
00:58:58,481 --> 00:58:59,314
and then of course the substructure of 
that sort of belief all the way around 

1051
00:59:01,181 --> 00:59:04,420
the world and there's going to be 
consequences to that.

1052
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:07,640
And he said,
there's going to be two consequences,

1053
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:11,750
and he predicted this say an 1850 it's 
something like 1850 and will to power.

1054
00:59:11,751 --> 00:59:12,584
It's unbelievable.
He said that what's going to happen in 

1055
00:59:15,561 --> 00:59:16,394
Europe is that there'll be the rise of 
socialist slash communist Utopian that 

1056
00:59:21,981 --> 00:59:22,814
will possess people and that will 
produce a war and the consequence of 

1057
00:59:26,601 --> 00:59:27,434
that war,
that will be that hundreds of millions 

1058
00:59:29,241 --> 00:59:30,074
of people die.
And he predicted that like 80 years 

1059
00:59:34,551 --> 00:59:35,660
before it happened.
Well,

1060
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:36,523
maybe less.
If you think of the Russian revolution 

1061
00:59:37,851 --> 00:59:38,684
as a precursor of that,
which Dostoyevsky would've certainly 

1062
00:59:40,401 --> 00:59:41,234
viewed it as a precursor of that now.
So there's totalitarianism on one side 

1063
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,120
that's,
that's one of the dangers

1064
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:52,693
and other danger is nihilism.
And then now nihilism emerges because 

1065
00:59:55,101 --> 00:59:59,300
you shatter the meaning structure within
which action is conceptualized.

1066
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:03,350
And so those are like two emergent 
pathologies that threatened people.

1067
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:04,543
Now if you talk to someone who's 
nihilistic and rationalist or almost 

1068
01:00:07,221 --> 01:00:09,410
always nihilistic,
especially if they're depressed,

1069
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:13,580
they'll say things like,
like I already told you,

1070
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:18,500
what difference does it make anyways?
Now Dostoyevsky played out those themes,

1071
01:00:18,501 --> 01:00:20,780
for example,
in in a really very,

1072
01:00:20,781 --> 01:00:22,580
very powerful way and a number of his 
books.

1073
01:00:22,581 --> 01:00:24,380
So the possessed,
for example,

1074
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:27,290
it's funny cause Dostoyevsky and Nichi 
road at the same time,

1075
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:29,660
and Dostoevsky wrote literature,
Nature Road Philosophy,

1076
01:00:29,661 --> 01:00:33,620
but they were doing exactly the same 
thing in Dostoyevsky's the possessed,

1077
01:00:33,621 --> 01:00:34,454
he talked about description of the 
Russian political economic ideological 

1078
01:00:39,021 --> 01:00:39,854
scene.
And what he saw happening was that as 

1079
01:00:41,451 --> 01:00:44,510
people moved away from there in 
measurement,

1080
01:00:44,511 --> 01:00:47,120
in a historically condition meaning 
system,

1081
01:00:47,121 --> 01:00:47,954
so that was say Judeo Christianity,
that they started to become susceptible 

1082
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:54,800
to utopian rationalist utopian 
ideologies.

1083
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:55,633
It was so out with one belief system in 
with another and the other was more 

1084
01:01:00,321 --> 01:01:01,154
dangerous because like the religious 
system sort of emerged from the bottom 

1085
01:01:04,161 --> 01:01:04,994
up and they were weird and mythical and 
difficult to understand from a 

1086
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:08,414
rationalist perspective.
Whereas the Utopian schemes were 

1087
01:01:10,971 --> 01:01:11,804
rational constructions in theology is 
very narrow and they're just imposed on 

1088
01:01:15,351 --> 01:01:16,184
people.
So for the example of the communists 

1089
01:01:17,331 --> 01:01:21,740
would say from each according to his 
ability to each according to his need,

1090
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:24,380
which sounds wonderful,
but if you put it into practice,

1091
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:27,920
it's like it's instantly genocidal.
So Nisha said,

1092
01:01:27,921 --> 01:01:29,150
well,
as

1093
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:31,623
the modern world suffers through the 
contradiction between scientific 

1094
01:01:35,771 --> 01:01:37,330
rationality and

1095
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:43,990
ritual religion,
historically conditioned,

1096
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:48,760
the consequence of that is going to be 
that two pathologies will emerge.

1097
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:50,313
One is reliance on totalitarianism.
And so I would say to the degree that 

1098
01:01:53,651 --> 01:01:54,484
any of you are any logical,
then you've succumb to the one pole of 

1099
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:01,503
of post religious pathology and all 
you've done is replace adherence to one 

1100
01:02:05,771 --> 01:02:06,604
set of beliefs.
Even though religious beliefs are not 

1101
01:02:09,401 --> 01:02:10,234
precisely beliefs with another,
it's rationally constructed and 

1102
01:02:12,761 --> 01:02:15,520
incredibly dangerous.
And he said,

1103
01:02:15,521 --> 01:02:17,350
well,
if it isn't going to be totalitarianism,

1104
01:02:17,351 --> 01:02:18,184
it's going to be nihilism.
But the thing that's so interesting 

1105
01:02:21,181 --> 01:02:22,014
about the existentialist does they make 
a forthright claim that regardless of 

1106
01:02:26,341 --> 01:02:31,341
whether or not the fact that people will
turn to those alternatives is a rational

1107
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:36,210
can be rationalized.
It makes sense that it would happen.

1108
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,810
It's still pathological.
It's like it,

1109
01:02:38,811 --> 01:02:40,450
it's a,
it's like an a priori statement.

1110
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:41,283
So I could say,
well,

1111
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,010
let's say you're nihilistic.
You know,

1112
01:02:44,011 --> 01:02:45,030
you,
you lack,

1113
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:45,923
you have a lot of doubt about life's 
meaning and purpose and it's like it's 

1114
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:49,771
eating at you.
It's,

1115
01:02:49,771 --> 01:02:51,390
it's,
it's a disease of the soul.

1116
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:52,523
And you'll come to me and you tell me 30
logical reasons why what you say has to 

1117
01:02:55,801 --> 01:02:56,634
be true.
And I would say those are excellent 

1118
01:02:58,951 --> 01:02:59,784
logical reasons.
And you're making a very powerful 

1119
01:03:01,051 --> 01:03:04,140
argument,
but it doesn't matter.

1120
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:05,483
It's irrelevant.
The fact that you're nihilistic means 

1121
01:03:07,411 --> 01:03:08,244
that you're infected with a pathology 
and whether or not you can justify it 

1122
01:03:10,861 --> 01:03:11,694
rationally is completely irrelevant.
All it means is that your rational mind 

1123
01:03:15,571 --> 01:03:18,660
is capable of spinning off a sequence of
logical tricks.

1124
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:22,440
And the ultimate truth is it's 
undermining your ability live.

1125
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:25,170
And so it's wrong.
Why is it wrong?

1126
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:28,500
I don't care why it's wrong.
It's not relevant.

1127
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:29,333
Why it's wrong.
What's relevant is you can't live like 

1128
01:03:32,191 --> 01:03:33,024
that.
And that's an existential claim cause 

1129
01:03:34,651 --> 01:03:37,110
the existentialists are interested in 
different kinds of truth.

1130
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:38,123
They would say that a truth you cannot 
live is not true because their 

1131
01:03:44,281 --> 01:03:47,040
definition of truth is different.
It's predicated on action.

1132
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:49,920
And then the totalitarianism claim is 
the same thing.

1133
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:52,650
So let's say that you're an ardent right
winger,

1134
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:53,753
or you're an ardent socialist,
or you're an ardent feminist or an 

1135
01:03:56,281 --> 01:04:01,020
environmentalist,
or who cares what the ISM is.

1136
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:06,740
You've abstracted out a bunch of axioms.
You develop a coherent representation of

1137
01:04:08,371 --> 01:04:13,371
the world and it's pathological.
It doesn't matter what the content is.

1138
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:19,080
It's pathological because it's not you.
It's not you.

1139
01:04:19,081 --> 01:04:19,914
If it was you,
then a million other people wouldn't 

1140
01:04:21,181 --> 01:04:22,014
believe it.
So the existentialists would say if a 

1141
01:04:25,201 --> 01:04:28,890
million other people believe it,
it's definitely false.

1142
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:31,470
And they're not talking about scientific
claims.

1143
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:34,140
That's a whole different,
that's a whole different order of,

1144
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:35,323
of discussion and description.
They're clearly making the point that 

1145
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:40,403
you're an individual thing and if you've
been unable to particularize your 

1146
01:04:47,161 --> 01:04:47,994
experience and you've replaced that with
adherence to some sort of arbitrary and 

1147
01:04:52,801 --> 01:04:56,940
universal call to action or 
representation,

1148
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:02,520
you've your pathological,
it's a form of mental illness.

1149
01:05:03,510 --> 01:05:05,520
And you might say,
well what's the evidence for that?

1150
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:06,863
Well,
what we'll find out in the next lecture 

1151
01:05:09,241 --> 01:05:11,550
is the 20th century was evidence for 
that.

1152
01:05:12,330 --> 01:05:14,760
Not so much for the nihilism nihilism 
aspect.

1153
01:05:14,761 --> 01:05:15,594
I think that we're still in for that 
cause I think we swung to 

1154
01:05:18,011 --> 01:05:20,890
totalitarianism first and that didn't 
work.

1155
01:05:20,891 --> 01:05:23,590
And so now you see this in postmodernism
for example,

1156
01:05:23,591 --> 01:05:24,424
it's an unbelievably nihilistic 
philosophy because it claims that all 

1157
01:05:28,151 --> 01:05:31,150
meaning for example,
is reduceable to motivations of power,

1158
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:35,740
which is like intellect,
intellectually simplistic beyond belief.

1159
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:40,590
And it comes straight out of like 1950s 
Marxism and you know it's,

1160
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:41,433
it's,
it's pretty much permeated the 

1161
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:47,230
humanities and the study of literature,
universities all over North America.

1162
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:48,333
It's,
it's,

1163
01:05:48,370 --> 01:05:53,370
it's sick beyond belief to teach young 
people that all meaning is relative.

1164
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:57,870
It's the last thing you guys need to 
hear when you're like 20 it's,

1165
01:05:58,270 --> 01:05:59,103
and the reason that people teach it is 
because there are more afraid that 

1166
01:06:02,681 --> 01:06:03,514
things might have meaning then they are 
afraid that things might not cause you 

1167
01:06:07,091 --> 01:06:08,290
might ask yourself,
well,

1168
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:11,830
here's two options.
One is it doesn't bloody.

1169
01:06:11,831 --> 01:06:14,710
Won't matter what you do.
Who the hell cares?

1170
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:18,250
Who's going to know in a thousand years?
And everything's relative.

1171
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:19,751
While you think,
God,

1172
01:06:19,751 --> 01:06:22,600
nothing could be worse than that.
Well,

1173
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:24,580
I can tell you something that would be 
worse than that.

1174
01:06:24,581 --> 01:06:26,380
It's easy.
Let's take the reverse.

1175
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:30,430
Everything you do matters.
Okay,

1176
01:06:30,431 --> 01:06:32,290
so what's the downside of that?

1177
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:34,600
It's like you don't get to get away with
anything.

1178
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:38,980
Everything you do is important.
It's linked to everything else.

1179
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:39,821
It's like,
okay,

1180
01:06:39,821 --> 01:06:41,890
now choose.
You got a choice.

1181
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,680
You can either choose to believe 
nihilistic Lee,

1182
01:06:44,681 --> 01:06:46,660
that nothing has any meaning.
Well,

1183
01:06:46,661 --> 01:06:47,494
you get to be depressed and anxious and 
it may be you're impulsive cause that's 

1184
01:06:50,141 --> 01:06:50,974
the only kind of pleasure you can find.
But the advantage is you don't have any 

1185
01:06:54,041 --> 01:06:54,874
responsibility.
You can do whatever you want and then a 

1186
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:59,440
psychoanalyst would say,
hm,

1187
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:03,190
maybe that's why you believe it.
That's a secondary gain,

1188
01:07:03,191 --> 01:07:04,024
right?
You think you believe it cause you've 

1189
01:07:05,291 --> 01:07:06,670
derived it logically.
It's like,

1190
01:07:06,671 --> 01:07:07,330
yeah,
sure.

1191
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:07,930
No,
no,

1192
01:07:07,930 --> 01:07:08,763
you believe it because it's in the best 
interest of the worst aspects of you to 

1193
01:07:12,341 --> 01:07:15,970
believe it because it,
it justifies sloths and cynicism.

1194
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,400
While the opposite is,
yeah,

1195
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:20,200
what you do matters.
It's like,

1196
01:07:20,201 --> 01:07:21,370
well,
why not believe that?

1197
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:24,580
We'll try believing it's seriously and 
see what happens.

1198
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,620
You take the existential claim 
seriously.

1199
01:07:26,621 --> 01:07:27,454
One of them is you make a mistake,
especially one that you know is a 

1200
01:07:30,581 --> 01:07:34,430
mistake.
You will absolutely pay for it and worse

1201
01:07:34,431 --> 01:07:37,810
that you'll never get away with it.
And worse than that,

1202
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:43,030
it'll domino out into the world.
So not only will you pay for it,

1203
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,610
but the people that you're connected 
with will pay for it.

1204
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:48,610
There's always a price.
It's like,

1205
01:07:48,611 --> 01:07:49,444
well,
you decide which of those two things is 

1206
01:07:50,681 --> 01:07:52,360
more terrifying.
You know,

1207
01:07:52,361 --> 01:07:57,010
when you read Freud and Freud says 
religion is a defense against death,

1208
01:07:57,011 --> 01:07:58,840
anxiety.
Well,

1209
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:02,920
that's a good argument,
but it is not by no means clear to me at

1210
01:08:02,921 --> 01:08:04,750
all.
That the reverse of that,

1211
01:08:04,751 --> 01:08:05,584
which is the idea that things have 
intrinsic meaning and that you have a 

1212
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:13,510
unlike an intrinsic responsibility.
It's by no means clear to me that that's

1213
01:08:13,511 --> 01:08:14,770
a comforting idea.

1214
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:20,000
It could easily be that the more 
comforting ideas that you know,

1215
01:08:20,001 --> 01:08:24,410
you're just a Spec in a collection of 
specs and what you do doesn't matter.

1216
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:28,430
Well,
you can sit and play video games for the

1217
01:08:28,431 --> 01:08:30,350
rest of your life and it isn't gonna 
make any difference.

1218
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:33,050
It doesn't have any significance.
Well,

1219
01:08:33,051 --> 01:08:35,390
if the opposite is true,
you know,

1220
01:08:35,391 --> 01:08:37,670
every time you do something 
pathological,

1221
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:39,740
especially if you know it's 
pathological,

1222
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:43,490
you tilt the whole world towards 
pathology.

1223
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:47,540
And so the existentialists would say of 
the 20th century,

1224
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:53,440
we just about an isolated ourselves once
in 1962 and then once again in the early

1225
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:57,230
eighties were this far away from nuclear
annihilation.

1226
01:08:57,590 --> 01:08:58,730
You might ask yourself,
well,

1227
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,980
why didn't we do it?
And the existential answer would be as a

1228
01:09:03,981 --> 01:09:04,814
collective human beings decided that it 
would be better to continue being than 

1229
01:09:08,331 --> 01:09:09,164
not to.
And the way they decided that was by 

1230
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:12,553
shifting the ratio of their pathological
to honest behaviors a little bit more 

1231
01:09:16,911 --> 01:09:17,900
towards honesty.

1232
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:19,753
And you know,
you might wonder about this sort of 

1233
01:09:20,691 --> 01:09:22,880
thing if this kind of thing could 
possibly be true.

1234
01:09:22,881 --> 01:09:25,860
Well that's why I have you read Frankel 
and soldier Nitsa,

1235
01:09:25,861 --> 01:09:26,694
you know,
they're not classic personality 

1236
01:09:27,561 --> 01:09:28,394
theorists,
but it doesn't matter to me because 

1237
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:30,343
they're getting at something that's 
deeper than the terror management 

1238
01:09:32,841 --> 01:09:35,120
theorists are the people who deal with 
positive illusions.

1239
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:36,373
They're trying to make a case based on 
the analysis of an entire bloody 

1240
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:40,723
century.
And the case is society's become 

1241
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:45,043
carnivorous and pathological and precise
proportion to the degree that the 

1242
01:09:49,881 --> 01:09:54,710
individuals who make up that society 
become deceitful and irresponsible.

1243
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:55,990
Okay.

1244
01:09:55,990 --> 01:09:56,823
And I've never encountered a political 
or economic analysis or claim that has 

1245
01:10:02,801 --> 01:10:04,480
anywhere near the power of that,

1246
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:06,763
but it's a terrifying proposition.
Even though what you get out of it is 

1247
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:12,980
while your life is meaningful,
your life is meaningful,

1248
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:17,300
and then if all of a sudden you find 
that you're suffering unnecessarily.

1249
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:19,550
This is a weird thing too about meaning 
claims.

1250
01:10:19,551 --> 01:10:23,060
You know someone's Nihilistic,
they come and talk to you.

1251
01:10:23,061 --> 01:10:23,631
They say,
well,

1252
01:10:23,631 --> 01:10:25,910
my life has any,
there's no meaning in my life.

1253
01:10:25,911 --> 01:10:26,391
And I say,
well,

1254
01:10:26,391 --> 01:10:27,800
how do you feel about that?
And they say,

1255
01:10:27,801 --> 01:10:29,210
well,
I'm really feeling bad.

1256
01:10:29,211 --> 01:10:29,871
And then you say,
well,

1257
01:10:29,871 --> 01:10:32,930
that's a meaning.
Feeling bad,

1258
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:35,060
being anxious,
hurting.

1259
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:38,960
Those are meanings.
They're just not very good meanings.

1260
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,500
And so then you might also ask yourself 
if your philosophy

1261
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:44,613
okay

1262
01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:49,360
throws you in the direction of 
overwhelming negative emotion,

1263
01:10:49,361 --> 01:10:51,970
anxiety and pain,
and that's a meaning.

1264
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:54,280
Hey,
you might note you're not going to argue

1265
01:10:54,281 --> 01:10:55,270
yourself out of that.

1266
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:56,970
Okay?

1267
01:10:56,970 --> 01:10:58,920
Which shows that there's a meaning 
basis.

1268
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:01,320
You can't just all of a sudden decide 
you're not hurting,

1269
01:11:01,321 --> 01:11:03,630
you're not anxious.
You don't have control over that.

1270
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:04,793
The meaning of your pain is,
is completely impenetrable to your 

1271
01:11:08,221 --> 01:11:12,060
rational mind.
So even if you're nihilistic,

1272
01:11:12,061 --> 01:11:14,340
you have to admit to the of negative 
emotion.

1273
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:16,043
Well then what do you do?
You just denied the existence of 

1274
01:11:17,641 --> 01:11:19,420
anything positive.
Well,

1275
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:22,290
why is that reasonable?
Maybe it's just that,

1276
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:23,513
wow,
you could be unlucky and maybe you're 

1277
01:11:24,481 --> 01:11:25,314
not.
Well,

1278
01:11:25,530 --> 01:11:26,363
you know when maybe you have reasons to 
be suffering that have nothing to do 

1279
01:11:28,321 --> 01:11:29,760
with the way you're construing the 
world,

1280
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:30,743
because people do get unlucky.
But there's always the possibility that 

1281
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:36,324
the reason that things are so terrible 
for you was that you're inhabiting a 

1282
01:11:38,941 --> 01:11:43,941
pathological perspective.
That's an existential point of view.

1283
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:50,790
And somebody tells me what time it is.

1284
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,710
It's one.
Oh,

1285
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:56,090
well good.
Then we can stop.

1286
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,740
We'll see you after reading week.
