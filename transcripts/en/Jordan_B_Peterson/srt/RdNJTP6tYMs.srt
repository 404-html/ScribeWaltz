1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:01,913
So there's,
there's a paper you're supposed to read 

2
00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:10,170
this week was gray marble of the limbic 
system and Basal Ganglia.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,833
It's a hard paper,
but it's easy compared to the optional 

4
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:16,170
paper,
which was Swanson.

5
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:18,900
And I had everybody read that last year,
but you know,

6
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:21,810
people were basically having 
convulsions.

7
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:25,110
And so I decided that it wasn't really 
fair to get you to read it.

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:25,973
However,
I would very much recommend that you 

9
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:30,390
read it and because it's a bloody 
brilliant paper and you'll,

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,920
you'll learn so much from it that it'll 
be worth,

11
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:33,893
especially if you're interested in the 
scientific element of psychology at 

12
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:37,404
Swanson.
He's a smart guy and that's a great 

13
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:39,564
paper.
And one of the things I really liked 

14
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:42,264
about it,
and this is what I'm going to an end 

15
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:46,870
about grey's papers as well as be there,
they're there,

16
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,070
they're describing brain physiology and 
the relationship between that physiology

17
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:53,004
and behavior in a way that's 
sufficiently sophisticated so that I 

18
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,620
actually think it's psychologically 
revealing.

19
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,791
It's,
it's so,

20
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:00,624
it's,
it's useful and important to know these 

21
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:03,030
things.
And I think what's happening,

22
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,553
you know,
I've been thinking more and more that 

23
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:07,590
that hierarchy that I've showed you guys
over and over,

24
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,740
I really think that that's basically a 
map of the unconscious.

25
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,330
It's something like that.
And it's not that hierarchy I showed you

26
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:19,380
isn't obviously a fully worked out 
representation of the unconscious,

27
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:21,630
but it's,
it's not a bad schemata.

28
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:24,700
And I think what it's missing is that,
you know,

29
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:28,170
the at near the bottom where you have 
the actual actions,

30
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,933
those actions are actually sequenced 
into what you might call motor melodies 

31
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,670
that have a perceptual frame associated 
with them.

32
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:40,410
And then those are nested inside 
fundamental motivational systems.

33
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,640
And Swanson's paper does a lovely job of
detailing the,

34
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,180
the physiological substrate for that,
you know?

35
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:49,014
So basically what he shows is that the 
nervous system is built up of 

36
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:52,764
hierarchical models that started in the 
body that basically start with spinal 

37
00:01:58,081 --> 00:01:58,980
reflexes.

38
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,873
You know,
the sort of quick and dirty spinal 

39
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:03,390
reflexes that cause your,
your,

40
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:05,630
your people think of their brain is in 
their head.

41
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,840
It's like,
no,

42
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,840
there's a big part of your brain in your
head,

43
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:12,270
but a huge part of it's distributed 
through your body.

44
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:13,104
So I re I re,
I remember reading and I hope this is 

45
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:16,164
correct,
that there are more neurons in your 

46
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:17,784
autonomic nervous system,
then there are in your central nervous 

47
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:20,394
system and the autonomic nervous system 
is distributed throughout the body and 

48
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,650
it's the part of the nervous system that
governs all the things.

49
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:26,484
You're too stupid to take care of,
like how your liver works and how your 

50
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:31,540
heart should stay beating and how you 
digest food and it's,

51
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,383
you know,
complicated things that consciousness 

52
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:36,660
isn't capable of dealing with and you 
don't want to,

53
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,673
you know,
you don't want to downplay the 

54
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:40,530
complexity of those sorts of functions.

55
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,950
There are so important that evolution 
does let you mess around with them.

56
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,660
So,
and then,

57
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,280
um,
you know,

58
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:47,740
the,
the,

59
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,573
the,
the voluntary motor system and the 

60
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:51,810
sensory system.
So the central nervous system,

61
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:52,644
well,
you know,

62
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,693
your spine is fairly hefty bit of neural
tissue and then of course the neurons 

63
00:02:58,441 --> 00:03:00,400
themselves distributed through your 
body.

64
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:03,170
So really your brain is distributed 
through your body.

65
00:03:03,171 --> 00:03:06,850
And there's also a tremendous number of 
neurons in your gut as well.

66
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:07,923
And some of those seem to actually 
produce information that might actually 

67
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:13,180
even acquire consciousness.
Now,

68
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:15,010
I don't necessarily mean at the gut 
level,

69
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:17,530
but it certainly informs you.
So,

70
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,540
so Swanson's basic proposition is that 
it's a piagetian proposition.

71
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:25,690
You know,
that you lay out these initial reflex of

72
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:29,500
behaviors and then they're sequenced 
into more complex melodies.

73
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:30,790
The,
the,

74
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,893
the,
uh,

75
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,610
you know,
the lowest level,

76
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:34,444
highest resolution behaviors you 
practice and practice until you're an 

77
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:38,140
expert at them.

78
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,070
Like,
you know how to graph,

79
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:41,980
you don't have to figure that out.
So you've got these elements of behavior

80
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,000
that you can basically parcel off to 
automated systems.

81
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:46,834
And some of those automated systems are 
so automated that they're handled by 

82
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:51,740
very low brain areas,
like spinal level.

83
00:03:51,741 --> 00:03:52,574
So for example,
if you take out paraplegic person and 

84
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:56,980
you and you,
uh,

85
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,900
have you take a paraplegic person and 
you suspend them under the arms,

86
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,793
over a treadmill and tilt them forward,
they'll walk has pretty remarkable a 

87
00:04:06,401 --> 00:04:07,360
cause.
You wouldn't think that.

88
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:11,830
But walking isn't that complicated.
I shouldn't say that.

89
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,770
Walking could be,
can be handled by the spine.

90
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,800
Figuring out where you want to walk.
That's more complicated.

91
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:21,190
So higher order brain systems are 
involved in that,

92
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:22,930
but so you think about it as a 
hierarchy.

93
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:25,220
Now one of the things that that,
ah,

94
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,833
that Swanson really concentrates on is 
this is the function of the 

95
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,160
hypothalamus.

96
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,730
And uh,
she would tell you some things about the

97
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,460
hypothalamus.
It sorta sits at the top of the,

98
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,000
of the spinal cord and it's,
it's not that big.

99
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,160
It's a little bitty brain area,
although it's,

100
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,290
it's also not,
you know,

101
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,124
you gotta remember that when you hear a 
word like hypothalamus or word like 

102
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:52,570
emotion or word like brain,
those are low resolution words,

103
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:55,630
right?
The phenomena itself isn't homogenous.

104
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:59,800
And so if you look at the hypothalamus,
it's composed of modules.

105
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,260
And then those modules are composed of 
modules.

106
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:03,094
And those modules modules are composed 
of modules and all the way down to the 

107
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:07,084
cellular level.
And then there's some modules there and 

108
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,200
that goes all the way down to the 
molecular level.

109
00:05:11,201 --> 00:05:13,960
And then there's sub modules at the 
molecular level.

110
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:16,300
So it's really,
really complicated.

111
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:17,134
And to think about it as a homogenous 
system is just a low resolution 

112
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,190
representation.

113
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,263
So the hypothalamus isn't an entity,
it's a group of functionally related 

114
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:29,770
entities that are composed of groups of 
functionally related entities.

115
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:30,604
But you know,
you can't start at the highest level of 

116
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:35,770
detail and progress forward.
So we're going to use shortcuts.

117
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:36,604
So anyways,
the hypothalamus isn't a very big brain 

118
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:39,454
area,
but it's an important one and it's 

119
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:42,154
sufficiently sophisticated so that if 
you take a female cat and there's an 

120
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:49,720
important reason that it's female and 
you take out basically it's whole brain,

121
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,520
the limbic system that's responsible for
emotions and the whole critical cap.

122
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,590
So it basically has no brain except for 
his cord,

123
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:58,424
the hypothalamus.
And if you keep it in a relatively 

124
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:02,810
closed environment,
you don't like a like a cage,

125
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:08,000
it pretty much acts like a normal cat.
It can do all the normal cat things.

126
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:10,790
It can,
it can engage in defensive aggression,

127
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,550
it can eat,
it can drink,

128
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,450
it can sleep.

129
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:15,603
It's Co,
it's conscious as you know in so far as 

130
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:19,340
you can tell whether or not an animal is
conscious,

131
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,503
it's hyper exploratory,
which is extraordinarily peculiar 

132
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:24,884
because the last thing you'd expect of a
cap with no brain would be to be hyper 

133
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:28,790
exploratory.
Right?

134
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:33,740
It seems to be insanely curious about 
everything and that's what that seems to

135
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:37,940
indicate is that it's psychomotor 
exploratory system,

136
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:38,774
which is in fact grounded in the 
hypothalamus is still active but it 

137
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:42,104
can't build up the memory 
representations that would inhibit the 

138
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:45,344
exploratory activity because basically 
what you're doing when you explore is 

139
00:06:49,821 --> 00:06:52,970
you're taking something something 
complex and then your mapping.

140
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:53,804
It's responses in relationship to the 
transformations of your body and in so 

141
00:06:58,191 --> 00:06:59,024
far as the set of transformations of 
your body that you're likely to 

142
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:07,091
manifest,
say in this place have zero motivational

143
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:08,474
relevance,
which is really what you're hoping for 

144
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:10,820
most of the time.

145
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,240
Then you build up a representation of 
the place that's,

146
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,193
that's part of that for septual motor 
hierarchy and it shuts off your 

147
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:21,740
curiosity about it.
And then what you perceived from then on

148
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:25,490
in really is your representation of the 
thing rather than the thing itself.

149
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:26,563
And you're kind of happy about that 
because it's easier to see what you've 

150
00:07:29,271 --> 00:07:32,360
already learned that it is to see the 
thing itself.

151
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,733
Now things can get re novelized you know
if someone acts very peculiarly right 

152
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:41,540
beside you,
you're like the whole space around you,

153
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:42,374
it's going to get renormalize very 
rapidly and your body will go on alert 

154
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:46,490
because of that.
But Mick,

155
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,090
basically what you're doing is learning 
in order to ignore,

156
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,973
right?
Because you want and you want to play 

157
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:55,070
attention to everything all the time.
It's like that's,

158
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,933
that's a short path to exhaustion 
because if everything's relevant than 

159
00:07:59,331 --> 00:08:00,164
your body goes on hyper alert and you 
produce cortisol and you know you're 

160
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:05,870
ready for anything and there's,
that's kind of exciting.

161
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,660
But as a longterm survival strategy,
it's bad.

162
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:09,494
What,
you just don't have the energy to 

163
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:11,534
maintain that for any length of time.
So part of the reason the cat is hyper 

164
00:08:14,571 --> 00:08:15,404
exploratory is because the systems that 
mediate exploration are still intact as 

165
00:08:19,191 --> 00:08:20,024
long as it has a hypothalamus and some 
of the rough underlying circuitry that 

166
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,640
associates that with the motor output 
system.

167
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,293
Um,
but it can't remember what it's 

168
00:08:28,371 --> 00:08:32,090
explored.
So just stays hyper exploratory.

169
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,060
It's also hyperreactive safety accuse of
aggression.

170
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,270
I would say like a hypothalamic cat is a
lot like a two year old,

171
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,853
you know,
and I mean that in the best possible 

172
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:41,910
way.
Um,

173
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,610
two year olds that are extremely 
curious,

174
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:45,170
they're hyper exploratory,
they're very,

175
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:47,600
very reactive to stimuli.
You know,

176
00:08:47,601 --> 00:08:49,550
they cry easily,
they laugh easily,

177
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,990
they run around easily.
They,

178
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,240
they get scared easily.
They,

179
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,070
you know,
experience pain easily.

180
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,230
So,
and it isn't until they built the higher

181
00:08:58,231 --> 00:09:00,270
order structures in the,
in the,

182
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,020
you know,
perceptual motor hierarchy that that all

183
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:04,854
gets integrated and they're not so 
reactive then they're nowhere near as 

184
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:08,530
much fun at that point either,
you know,

185
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,440
but uh,
you know,

186
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:13,110
and so the female cat can,
can regulate it.

187
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,530
It's water intake and it can also engage
in sexual activity.

188
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,443
No male cat can't do that.
It needs more brain than just the 

189
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:21,024
hypothalamus because it's more 
complicated to sequence male sexual 

190
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:27,790
behavior.
So you can tell the difference between a

191
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,643
male cat with no court tax,
let's say a no limbic system and a 

192
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:34,110
female cat,
but pretty much only in that,

193
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,420
in that particularities.
So,

194
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,310
so,
you know,

195
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,144
so,
so that's very interesting because if 

196
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:41,334
you,
if you study neuropsychology and you're 

197
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:46,530
taught by clinical neuropsychologist 
say,

198
00:09:46,531 --> 00:09:49,740
or even neuropsychologists that have a 
clinical background,

199
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,360
they're very cortical centric.

200
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,850
You know,
and I think it's,

201
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,790
it's part of your hangover.
We're,

202
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,490
we're,
you know,

203
00:09:56,491 --> 00:09:59,700
since we got unseated from our position 
at the center of the universe,

204
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:00,930
we've been,
you know,

205
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:01,764
rat rat radically running around trying 
to figure out what it is that makes us 

206
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:05,004
special in relationship to animals.
And we kind of cottoned onto the idea 

207
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:08,910
that,
you know,

208
00:10:08,911 --> 00:10:12,480
we have this big cortical cap and 
especially the prefrontal Cortex,

209
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:14,730
and it's very large in relationship to 
our body,

210
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,930
which,
which it is.

211
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,771
And that,
you know,

212
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:19,050
somehow that distinguishes us from other
animals,

213
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,040
which it does.
But,

214
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:21,963
but that's also led us into thinking 
that the most recently evolved parts of 

215
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:28,710
the brain are the most important.
It's like,

216
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,350
and,
and in some sense the smartest,

217
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:32,683
you know,
but there's a real error of presumption 

218
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:35,544
there because you might also,
you might think instead that it's those 

219
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:42,390
parts of the brain that evolution has 
had the longest time to work on that are

220
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,670
in fact the smartest,
you know?

221
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,740
And they do take care of all the heavy 
lifting.

222
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,311
You know,
your,

223
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:48,000
your,
your,

224
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,870
your consciousness isn't entrusted with 
any of the heavy lifting.

225
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:56,070
You can fiddle around the edges with it,
but you're not going to be allowed to do

226
00:10:56,071 --> 00:10:57,770
anything that's really pr,
you know,

227
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,613
that's really physiologically profound 
and it's a good thing because you just 

228
00:11:01,351 --> 00:11:02,184
don't have the intellectual capacity to 
manage that kind of ongoing 

229
00:11:06,571 --> 00:11:07,404
physiological monitoring in all of us.
Like you don't understand your body if 

230
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:11,964
you're lucky,
the thing works and you can ignore it 

231
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:14,490
roughly speaking,
you know?

232
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,533
But if it ever goes wrong,
good luck trying to figure it out 

233
00:11:17,821 --> 00:11:18,750
consciously,
you know?

234
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:20,190
I mean,
we're getting somewhere with that,

235
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,890
but it's very,
very difficult to do so.

236
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,143
So we should think about the 
hypothalamus for a bit because it seems 

237
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:32,340
to be pretty damn important.
And so I would say,

238
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:34,043
you know,
people have wondered sometimes and 

239
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:36,174
they've asked me,
you know,

240
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,900
where's the Super Ego and the ego and 
the ID located in the brain.

241
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:40,763
And you know,
it's a stupid question and it's not a 

242
00:11:44,221 --> 00:11:46,720
stupid question at the same time,
um,

243
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,000
it's actually a useful question at one 
level of analysis because you could say,

244
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:51,834
well,
the end from the Freudian is sort of 

245
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:54,964
the,
the natural force that propels 

246
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,780
motivation.
You know,

247
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,810
and,
and when we say motivation,

248
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:05,140
we're not saying much different than 
saying in,

249
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:05,951
by the way,
you know,

250
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:08,710
it's the same kind of low resolution 
word.

251
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:09,783
And it's clearly the case that we have 
fundamental motivational systems and 

252
00:12:12,281 --> 00:12:16,530
that we do share them with animals and 
that they do drive our behavior in it.

253
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,650
But they also drive our perceptions in 
all the ways that Freud thought about,

254
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,573
you know,
and one of the things I really like 

255
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:23,554
about the psychoanalysts is that they,
they never make the mistake of assuming 

256
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,523
that a motivational system or an 
emotional system is a mechanical system 

257
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:37,330
that reacts to deterministically.
They say no,

258
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:39,820
those things are like personalities.
And that's,

259
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:40,683
that's much more sophisticated viewpoint
than the typical behaviorist or the 

260
00:12:44,411 --> 00:12:47,260
typical cognitive psychologist,
you know,

261
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:48,483
because they tend to think of the 
computer in either stimulus response 

262
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:52,324
terms.
So it's basically deterministic chains 

263
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,280
or as if the,
the,

264
00:12:56,281 --> 00:13:00,880
the information processing system is a 
computational apparatus,

265
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,580
which it is.
But it's not only that,

266
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:06,520
you know,
it's an embodied computational apparatus

267
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:08,980
and the body is a very sophisticated 
thing.

268
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:09,680
You know,
it's,

269
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,340
it's been very difficult for us to build
embodied robots.

270
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,730
And it's also the case that until you 
build embodied robots,

271
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:17,440
the things don't really get smart.

272
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,530
You know,
you have to have a body for the thing to

273
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:21,364
actually have any intelligence.
And that was actually figured out by a 

274
00:13:23,681 --> 00:13:24,514
robotics engineer named Rodney Brooks 
back in the 1990s 92 93 published a 

275
00:13:28,211 --> 00:13:30,190
couple of papers on that saying,
you know,

276
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:32,410
that if we were going to build 
artificial intelligence,

277
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,633
we shouldn't start from the top down.
We shouldn't build a world modeling 

278
00:13:37,211 --> 00:13:38,044
machine.
And then embedded in something that 

279
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:40,984
moves around,
we should build something that sort of 

280
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:45,280
moves around semi autonomously,
like a stupid insect.

281
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,563
Insects aren't stupid.
So I do mean as stupid insect and if we 

282
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,210
could manage that,
we'd really be doing something,

283
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,620
you know,
and I think we've,

284
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,580
you might've gotten beyond the stupid 
insect level of,

285
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,900
of robots so far.
Um,

286
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,450
and you know,
it starting to ramp up really fast,

287
00:14:01,451 --> 00:14:03,850
but it's in large part because the 
things are embodied.

288
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:08,740
And so because it is the case as,
as we've discussed that your,

289
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:09,773
your perceptual,
your cognitive perceptual motor systems 

290
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,013
have to be embedded in an output system 
that can interact with the world in 

291
00:14:17,261 --> 00:14:20,410
order for them to be doing anything 
that's actual or real.

292
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,380
So.
So anyways,

293
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,220
back to the hypothalamus.
Um,

294
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,240
roughly speaking and I'm no expert on 
hypothalamic function and I had to pound

295
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:33,880
by way through Swanson's paper because 
it's quite complex,

296
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:34,714
you know,
but the hypothalamus is sort of the 

297
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:40,060
nexus between the brain,
the mind and the body.

298
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,953
That's one way of thinking about it.
And it's very good at monitoring your 

299
00:14:43,451 --> 00:14:44,284
body,
the states of your body and it can 

300
00:14:45,221 --> 00:14:49,540
figure out basically when your blood 
sugar's too low and when you need water.

301
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:52,580
And when you,
I don't exactly remember how it's,

302
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,463
uh,
associated with the regulation of 

303
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:55,484
breathing because I suspect that that's 
a different system and I don't remember 

304
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,900
that being a sub component of the 
hypothalamus,

305
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:04,130
but it does also regulate things like 
sexual behavior and sex,

306
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:08,060
sexual attraction and temperature 
regulation and excretion and,

307
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,223
and you know,
all the things that you would associate 

308
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:15,650
with the basic biological functions that
come along with being a complex animal.

309
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,521
And,
you know,

310
00:15:16,521 --> 00:15:20,180
we share those functions way down the 
evolutionary chain.

311
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,403
You know,
we share a lot of the functions with 

312
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:25,340
everything that moves,
approach and avoidance.

313
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,290
We share with pretty much everything 
that moves.

314
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:32,030
And by the time you get to the higher 
mammalian functions,

315
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,193
you know,
we share those with pretty much all 

316
00:15:34,371 --> 00:15:35,204
mammals.
That's partly why we can understand 

317
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:37,910
mammals pretty well.
You know,

318
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:38,744
it's,
you can kind of have a lizard as a pet 

319
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,650
and some of them are more social than 
others.

320
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,540
But you know,
to really have a pad,

321
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:45,374
it has to be a mammal.
And it's even better if it's a social 

322
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,380
mammal,
like a,

323
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,213
like a dog because you know,
you can understand dogs and they can 

324
00:15:52,191 --> 00:15:53,024
understand you cause they're 
hierarchical animals and they have the 

325
00:15:55,251 --> 00:15:59,390
same roughly the same set of biological 
functions that you do.

326
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,553
You know,
their brains are organized around smell 

327
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,130
and not around vision.

328
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,323
And almost all animals are like that 
except for people and maybe hunting 

329
00:16:08,241 --> 00:16:09,440
birds,
you know.

330
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:12,260
So that's one thing that really 
distinguishes us from dogs,

331
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,393
but we're similar enough in or embodied 
behavior so that we can directly relate 

332
00:16:18,531 --> 00:16:23,120
to dogs and you know,
they can even play and plays a circuit.

333
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:27,410
So there's a guy named Jaak Panksepp,
j a k Panksepp,

334
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:28,640
p a n k,
s,

335
00:16:28,641 --> 00:16:32,240
e p.
P who I would roundly recommend that you

336
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:36,020
read if you're interested in in 
behavioral neuroscience.

337
00:16:36,021 --> 00:16:36,854
I think he's a genius.
He's sort of on par with gray as far as 

338
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:39,914
I'm concerned.
And on par with Swanson and Panksepp I 

339
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,660
believe discovered the play circuit in 
mammals.

340
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:46,400
And so you know,
two thumbs up for him.

341
00:16:46,401 --> 00:16:47,234
That's a big deal.
That's kind of like discovering a 

342
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:51,050
continent from the psychological 
perspective.

343
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:51,884
And it's a search.
It's a circuit that's separate from 

344
00:16:53,601 --> 00:16:54,434
exploration,
which is kind of interesting cause you 

345
00:16:56,061 --> 00:16:58,700
think about play as a form of 
exploratory behavior,

346
00:16:58,970 --> 00:16:59,803
but it's sufficiently different from,
from standard exploratory behavior that 

347
00:17:03,261 --> 00:17:07,550
it has a circuit that's devoted to it 
and there's a lot of primary circuits,

348
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,773
you know,
and they're networked in with the rest 

349
00:17:09,771 --> 00:17:10,340
of the brain.

350
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,680
And obviously circuit is a,
you know,

351
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:13,514
a metaphor.
So I could say there's a lot of primary 

352
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,110
subpersonalities.
They're like one eyed monster.

353
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,080
There's only one thing thereafter,
you know,

354
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:24,290
and there's a whole bunch of them.
And so roughly speaking,

355
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,363
they regulate the things.
I already mentioned that the 

356
00:17:28,161 --> 00:17:30,980
hypothalamus regulates defensive 
aggression,

357
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,020
sexual behavior,
temperature,

358
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:35,360
regulation,
food and water intake,

359
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,300
excretion,
while then there's one for breathing,

360
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:42,140
then there's another for pain,
then there's another for anxiety.

361
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,483
Um,
and there's another for exploration and 

362
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,800
there's others.
There's sensory modules as well.

363
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,820
You know,
there's a visual circuit and an auditory

364
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:54,920
circuit to know olfactory circuit and 
the circuit gets devoted to taste and,

365
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,960
and there's a circuit that keeps track 
of how your body is localized in space.

366
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,820
That's a parietal circuit.
And um,

367
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,460
what else is important?
Oh yeah.

368
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:06,294
There's a circuit that you can use to 
abstractly model perceptual structures 

369
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:13,710
and patterns of behavior before you 
implement them in the world.

370
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,130
And that seems to be a higher cortical 
function fundamentally.

371
00:18:17,131 --> 00:18:20,280
And you associate that with the contents
of your consciousness.

372
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,040
There's a language circuit,
um,

373
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:24,001
though.
Oh yeah.

374
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:26,970
There's an empathy circuit that mediates
maternal behavior.

375
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,180
There's a hunting circuit that mediates 
predatory behavior.

376
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,880
Um,
there's a circuit to check dominance and

377
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:34,710
subordinate subordination.

378
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,353
MMM.

379
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,800
There's a circuit that mediates 
creativity and human beings.

380
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,920
There's a circuit that mediates social 
activity.

381
00:18:46,921 --> 00:18:47,451
So,
and,

382
00:18:47,451 --> 00:18:48,284
and the,
the positive reinforcing nature of 

383
00:18:49,741 --> 00:18:50,574
social activity and that's quite tightly
expo associated with the exploratory 

384
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:54,864
circuit.

385
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,120
Um,
let's see.

386
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:59,301
Well that's,
you know,

387
00:18:59,301 --> 00:19:00,134
that's not too bad for beginning.
I'm sure I've missed some and I'll 

388
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:02,840
remember them.
But,

389
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,680
and each of those subsystems is 
important enough so that there's a neuro

390
00:19:06,681 --> 00:19:07,514
architecture devoted to it.
Now some of those neural architectures 

391
00:19:10,971 --> 00:19:14,750
are flexible enough so that if they 
don't develop in one brain area,

392
00:19:14,751 --> 00:19:16,280
they'll develop in another.
So it's,

393
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,173
it's not exactly as if the location of 
these functions is specifically 

394
00:19:20,811 --> 00:19:23,930
determined in advance before 
development.

395
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:27,920
So for example,
if you have a baby and it has,

396
00:19:27,921 --> 00:19:30,290
you know,
epilepsy and the epilepsy is really bad,

397
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,960
sometimes they'll take out the whole 
left or right hemisphere.

398
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,190
And if they do that early enough doesn't
really seem to have much consequence for

399
00:19:37,191 --> 00:19:38,240
the baby,
you know,

400
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:39,470
which is pretty weird.
You think?

401
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:40,304
Well,
half of the brain that problem fairly 

402
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,103
useful.
But in some sense it's as if the 

403
00:19:44,271 --> 00:19:45,104
cortical elements of the brain are 
territory that can be inhabited in 

404
00:19:49,551 --> 00:19:51,980
colonized by the lower levels of the 
brain.

405
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:56,240
And so you could say that the lower 
levels of the brain,

406
00:19:56,241 --> 00:19:59,930
including the visual input systems,
would just as soon call a nice,

407
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,793
what we call the visual cortex.
But if there's no visual cortex because 

408
00:20:03,801 --> 00:20:04,634
it's been removed,
then they'll just go call tonight as 

409
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:08,150
part of the auditory cortex.
You know,

410
00:20:08,151 --> 00:20:12,640
and what you see in other situations 
sometimes is that people have high,

411
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,483
high hydrocephaly.
And what that means is that their 

412
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,030
cerebral spinal fluid builds up in their
brain.

413
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:23,490
And so the ventricles get very enlarged.
And so if you take an x ray or an MRI or

414
00:20:23,631 --> 00:20:25,070
other sort of scan,
if these people,

415
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:25,904
you'll find that their entire skull is 
full of water except for like a half 

416
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,220
inch thin slice of court at old tissue 
around the water,

417
00:20:34,221 --> 00:20:35,054
like a balloon.
And one of the guys who was like that 

418
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,650
had a phd in mathematics from Cambridge,
you know,

419
00:20:39,651 --> 00:20:42,140
5% of his brain tissue was intact.

420
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,093
Now it was pretty active that 5% and you
could also be sure that it would not 

421
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,350
have been very resilient to damage.
You know?

422
00:20:50,351 --> 00:20:54,280
So part of the reason that we have an 
excess of cortical tissue,

423
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,533
so to speak is because you know,
we need to be resilient to assaults and 

424
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,880
trouble.
And it does appear,

425
00:21:00,881 --> 00:21:02,530
perhaps this is,
this is,

426
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,520
this is the sort of discussion that got 
Larry Summers kicked out of Harvard.

427
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,170
Um,
it looks like men are,

428
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,340
are somewhat more differentiated in 
their cortical function than women.

429
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,720
And what that means is that there is a 
very small subset of spatial skills that

430
00:21:16,721 --> 00:21:17,554
men seem to have an advantage in.
But the price they pay for that is that 

431
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:20,944
they're much more susceptible to a brain
malfunction and also to brain damage 

432
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:28,270
because they don't have redundancy built
in to the same degree women do.

433
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:29,523
So,
and that's part of the reason why there 

434
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,980
were far more boys who have learning 
disabilities for example,

435
00:21:32,981 --> 00:21:34,630
than there are women.
So

436
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:37,443
now people debate about that because 
it's contaminated with concerns about 

437
00:21:40,121 --> 00:21:40,954
gender.
But,

438
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,180
um,
so,

439
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,043
okay,
so the brain's gone all these like 

440
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:50,740
specialized sub circuits and they're 
variable in their expression.

441
00:21:50,741 --> 00:21:51,574
And what,
what that basically means is that on 

442
00:21:53,231 --> 00:21:56,470
average across people,
they're likely to be located in the same

443
00:21:56,471 --> 00:21:58,450
place.
Now there's,

444
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,640
there's,
there's some discrepancies,

445
00:22:00,641 --> 00:22:04,120
cause lefthanders are different than 
right handers and people also have mixed

446
00:22:04,121 --> 00:22:04,954
dominance.
And so their brains can be organized in 

447
00:22:06,761 --> 00:22:11,230
ways that are not exactly cononical.
So we're saying roughly speaking,

448
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,423
and it extends,
it extends in some weird ways to 

449
00:22:14,891 --> 00:22:15,724
phenomena that you wouldn't necessarily 
think could possibly be organized in 

450
00:22:18,281 --> 00:22:19,720
that manner.
So for example,

451
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,243
the part of the brain that you use for 
silent reading and the visual Cortex is 

452
00:22:26,081 --> 00:22:29,710
back here and then the auditory cortex 
is about here.

453
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,933
And then the part of the brain that you 
use for silent reading is where the 

454
00:22:33,491 --> 00:22:37,600
auditory and the visual cortex overlap.
So that's pretty cool.

455
00:22:37,601 --> 00:22:38,434
So what it means is that you look at 
words and you hear them because your 

456
00:22:41,321 --> 00:22:44,620
eyes are using the auditory cortex as a 
representational structures.

457
00:22:44,621 --> 00:22:45,454
So that's pretty cool.
And so it turns out that people who 

458
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:51,040
silent read pretty much used the same 
brain area to do that.

459
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:54,700
And so you might think about that as 
biological preparedness in some sense.

460
00:22:54,701 --> 00:22:59,260
But of course people didn't learn to 
read silently til 500 years ago,

461
00:22:59,261 --> 00:23:00,460
roughly speaking.
You know,

462
00:23:00,461 --> 00:23:04,840
even the earliest literate people,
most of them read out loud,

463
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,300
silent reading was a very,
very rare phenomenon.

464
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:11,020
Julius Caesar could read silently and 
people thought that that was part of his

465
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,560
magical power because it's,
well it's pretty damn weird.

466
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:16,510
You know that you can use your eyes to 
here,

467
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,100
you know,
cause you can all do it.

468
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,790
You think,
yeah,

469
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,560
anybody can do that.
But you know,

470
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:21,423
it's a pretty new thing on the 
evolutionary horizon and to be able to 

471
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:26,620
hear with your eyes,
it's like good work guys.

472
00:23:26,621 --> 00:23:28,960
That's,
that's not an easy thing to manage.

473
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,970
So,
so anyways,

474
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:34,400
the brain is,
has specialized subsystem,

475
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,253
but it's a dynamic biological systems so
you can muck about with it quite a bit 

476
00:23:38,621 --> 00:23:41,110
and it'll set itself up in slightly 
different ways.

477
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,303
So the systems aren't necessarily 
localized exactly the same place in 

478
00:23:45,861 --> 00:23:47,690
every one.
But roughly speaking,

479
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,350
everyone has those systems and roughly 
speaking,

480
00:23:51,351 --> 00:23:53,540
they're in the same place across people.
Now.

481
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:56,780
There's a lot of variability and it's 
one of the things that makes you know,

482
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:57,983
Mri studies in the light.
Very difficult to interpret because if 

483
00:24:00,051 --> 00:24:04,250
you average across a lot of people,
what it means is you blur things out,

484
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,593
you know,
cause you can only extract out the 

485
00:24:06,381 --> 00:24:07,214
commonalities and although you know 
they're getting better and better at 

486
00:24:09,201 --> 00:24:09,890
dealing with that.

487
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:13,370
So
okay.

488
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,313
So
there's other ways that you can think 

489
00:24:19,611 --> 00:24:20,444
about the brain too.
These are all approaches to 

490
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:23,770
understanding it.
You know,

491
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,620
there,
I would,

492
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,690
I would say it's a very,
very complex thing.

493
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,880
In fact it's the most complex thing 
there is.

494
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,103
You know,
there are more patterns of combinations 

495
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,193
of neuro connections in your brain than 
there are subatomic particles in the 

496
00:24:36,681 --> 00:24:38,360
universe.
So you are,

497
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,283
I know you,
you won't believe that because it 

498
00:24:39,921 --> 00:24:40,754
doesn't seem possible.
But you can do the math and you'll 

499
00:24:41,991 --> 00:24:42,824
figure out that it's actually right it.
So you're the most complicated thing 

500
00:24:46,161 --> 00:24:46,994
there is and by a lot.
And so in some sense there's more space 

501
00:24:51,201 --> 00:24:54,080
inside your head then there is space 
outside your head.

502
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,510
It depends on how you conceptualize 
space,

503
00:24:56,511 --> 00:24:57,344
you know,
because you can conceptualize space as 

504
00:24:59,241 --> 00:25:03,710
the number of ways that something can be
configured and that state space,

505
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:07,040
and that's a,
that's a a magnitude measurement,

506
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,870
you know,
and the distance between things,

507
00:25:08,871 --> 00:25:11,000
well that's another way of 
conceptualizing space.

508
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,820
But if you're wanting,
if you want to think about big,

509
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:15,523
what's inside you is,
I think that it's bigger than what's 

510
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:19,394
outside you.
It's certainly that way in terms of 

511
00:25:20,391 --> 00:25:22,700
complexity,
unless you factor in the other brains,

512
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,290
you know,
so.

513
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,930
So that's very much we're thinking about
means that,

514
00:25:26,931 --> 00:25:29,750
you know,
what we don't understand about the brain

515
00:25:29,751 --> 00:25:31,460
is going to fill many,
many books.

516
00:25:31,461 --> 00:25:34,850
And one of the things we really don't 
understand his consciousness,

517
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:38,060
people just don't get that.
And it doesn't really look,

518
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,100
you know,
you might think that consciousness is an

519
00:25:40,101 --> 00:25:43,400
emergent late evolutionary function,
you know?

520
00:25:43,401 --> 00:25:45,740
But it doesn't really look like that,
you know?

521
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:48,060
I mean,
even when people become demented and,

522
00:25:48,061 --> 00:25:48,894
and they,
you lose almost all of their higher 

523
00:25:50,001 --> 00:25:50,834
cortical function.
There's no doubt there's still 

524
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:54,710
conscious.
And so consciousness might be way,

525
00:25:54,711 --> 00:25:56,450
way,
way older than we think.

526
00:25:56,451 --> 00:25:58,370
And in fact,
I think it's highly probable.

527
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,130
I don't think a hypothalamic cat is 
unconscious.

528
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:03,460
It's certainly a wake,
you know,

529
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:07,160
and distinguishing between awake and 
conscious is no easy thing.

530
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:07,971
You might say,
well,

531
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:09,590
animals aren't conscious.
It's like,

532
00:26:09,591 --> 00:26:10,424
well,
you know,

533
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,100
here's the thing.
You know what people norm normally think

534
00:26:16,101 --> 00:26:18,560
is that humans are different than other 
animals.

535
00:26:18,561 --> 00:26:21,740
And so before you anthropomorphize an 
animal,

536
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,310
you should be careful.
But I think that's complete rubbish.

537
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,173
I think it's exactly the opposite.
Before you assume that humans have 

538
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:30,104
attributes that animals don't,
you have to prove it because there's 

539
00:26:32,661 --> 00:26:34,550
continuity,
tremendous,

540
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,384
tremendous continuity.
And so it's right to anthropomorphize 

541
00:26:38,871 --> 00:26:39,704
animals.
What's wrong is to presume a priority 

542
00:26:42,861 --> 00:26:43,694
that humans are qualitatively different.
Now there are some very bizarre things 

543
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:47,850
about this.
Obviously,

544
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:51,570
you know these,
we have opposable thumbs,

545
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,880
that's a big deal.
We can grip things.

546
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,800
That's a massive deal,
you know,

547
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,280
and it turns out that there's another,
your,

548
00:26:59,281 --> 00:27:00,150
your,
your,

549
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,103
your brain maps your body onto its 
surface onto its motor strip and it's 

550
00:27:05,761 --> 00:27:08,730
sensory strip,
which are roughly here on the brain.

551
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,773
And if you take the motor strip or the 
sensory strip and you make a 

552
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:16,170
representation of how it represents the 
body,

553
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,270
which is called a Homerun,
keyless wilder,

554
00:27:18,271 --> 00:27:21,510
penfield wilder penfield still did this 
first at mcgill university.

555
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,673
He,
I don't know if you know this and 

556
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,520
perhaps you'll be fortunate enough to 
experience it,

557
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:31,530
but people who have brain surgery are 
conscious when it happens.

558
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,173
And that's so that the surgeons can 
figure out whether this little part is 

559
00:27:35,341 --> 00:27:37,200
doing anything important before they 
take it out.

560
00:27:37,201 --> 00:27:39,030
You know,
it's getting very horrific thought.

561
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,313
But Penn field when he was,
he did some of the early psychosurgery 

562
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:46,230
for epilepsy because in tractable 
epilepsy,

563
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:48,390
sometimes the only thing to do is 
radical surgery,

564
00:27:48,391 --> 00:27:49,224
like a corpus.
You caught the Corpus callosum for 

565
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:52,170
example.
So that the,

566
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,960
you know,
the electrical storm so to speak,

567
00:27:54,961 --> 00:27:58,590
can't transmit across the hemispheres 
and the whole brain won't be affected.

568
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,540
So,
but while he was doing that,

569
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,553
he used the little electrode to map out 
the surface of the brain and he mapped 

570
00:28:05,011 --> 00:28:05,844
out the motor strip,
which is just behind the prefrontal 

571
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:09,930
cortex.
And then the sensory strip,

572
00:28:09,931 --> 00:28:10,764
which is just behind that to find out 
how the body representatives or the 

573
00:28:14,671 --> 00:28:18,870
brain represents the body.
And basically what he showed was that on

574
00:28:18,871 --> 00:28:20,460
the motor strip,
you know,

575
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,323
you're,
the thumb has as much representation as 

576
00:28:23,851 --> 00:28:28,440
your whole trunk.
So basically your thumb is as smart from

577
00:28:28,441 --> 00:28:32,580
a motoric perspective,
smarter than you from here to here,

578
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:33,723
you know,
well try picking up something with your 

579
00:28:35,521 --> 00:28:36,660
back,
you know,

580
00:28:36,661 --> 00:28:38,730
and you'll figure out exactly why that 
is.

581
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:39,743
And the thumb basically has almost as 
much representation as the rest of the 

582
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:43,524
hand.
But the hands are like gigantic 

583
00:28:44,881 --> 00:28:46,500
balloons,
you know.

584
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:48,760
And the arms are a little skinny sticks 
here,

585
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,850
here,
theater fairly highly

586
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:56,160
represented,
especially in the sensory cortex because

587
00:28:56,161 --> 00:28:57,870
you know,
you gotta be careful about what you,

588
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,100
what you step on.

589
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,173
And one of the things that's very 
interesting about the representation of 

590
00:29:03,061 --> 00:29:03,894
the feet on the sensory strip is that 
it's right beside the representation of 

591
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:09,600
the Genitalia.
And so there's crosstalk.

592
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:13,350
And so some of you are pretty into foot 
massages and that's why,

593
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,700
you know,
so it's,

594
00:29:14,701 --> 00:29:16,590
it's,
it's a consequence of the overlap.

595
00:29:16,591 --> 00:29:19,470
Now why that overlap is there,
I don't know exactly,

596
00:29:19,471 --> 00:29:20,304
you know,
maybe,

597
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,140
maybe the brain had organized itself.
So particularly sensitive surfaces.

598
00:29:25,141 --> 00:29:27,210
We're taking advantage of the same 
tissue,

599
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,300
something like that.
But you know,

600
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:33,060
it's an interesting case of it's like 
synesthesia and sent in a sense,

601
00:29:33,061 --> 00:29:35,400
it's like sensory synesthesia.
So,

602
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:38,070
um,
as far as your brain's concerned,

603
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,090
your all hands and your hands are almost
all thumb and you're quite a bit of feet

604
00:29:43,091 --> 00:29:43,924
and your lips are massive and so is your
tongue and your face is very highly 

605
00:29:48,011 --> 00:29:48,970
represented too.

606
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,953
So basically as far as your brain is 
concerned with regards to sensory input 

607
00:29:53,411 --> 00:29:54,244
and motor output,
you're this huge face with great big 

608
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:57,544
lips and tongue and you have massive 
balloon like hands and your feet are 

609
00:30:00,821 --> 00:30:01,654
pretty big too.
And there's a fair bit of sensory 

610
00:30:03,191 --> 00:30:05,950
representation for the Genitalia as 
well.

611
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:08,710
And then the body's hardly there at all.
So,

612
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,690
so that's kind of what a human being is 
like,

613
00:30:10,691 --> 00:30:11,524
right?
We're all thumbs in hands and we talk 

614
00:30:12,461 --> 00:30:13,294
about what we do with our thumbs and 
hands all the time and we take things 

615
00:30:15,701 --> 00:30:16,534
apart with them.
And we put them together and then we 

616
00:30:17,861 --> 00:30:19,510
tell everybody else how we're doing 
that.

617
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:20,643
And that's basically a human being.
And when you're thinking about the 

618
00:30:23,381 --> 00:30:24,214
difference between human beings and 
highly encephalitis mammals like 

619
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:28,894
dolphins and whales,
because people have claimed that 

620
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,600
dolphins and whales are extraordinarily 
intelligent and you know,

621
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:37,930
dolphins don't seem particularly simple 
minded,

622
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,490
but look at the things they're in.

623
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:41,890
Like if they're in these test tube 
shaped bodies,

624
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,620
what are they going to do?
Flip sand up into buildings?

625
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:49,010
It's like they can't manage that.
And so the embodied the,

626
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:49,863
the manner in which their nervous system
is embodied turns out to be 

627
00:30:52,841 --> 00:30:53,674
extraordinarily important when you're 
trying to understand something like the 

628
00:30:55,931 --> 00:30:59,440
relationship between cortical tissue 
mass and intelligence,

629
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:04,630
you can't just think about mind as 
something that's floating like a soul in

630
00:31:04,631 --> 00:31:08,320
space if it isn't stuck in something 
that you can use,

631
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,393
it's not particularly good for anything 
or anything that human beings would 

632
00:31:13,091 --> 00:31:16,150
regard as particularly intelligence.
Okay,

633
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,680
so that's kind of a,
Oh,

634
00:31:20,681 --> 00:31:21,514
here's another way that you can think 
about the brain and you can also think 

635
00:31:23,231 --> 00:31:24,064
about it as divided.
This is sort of a Schema that there was 

636
00:31:28,781 --> 00:31:30,970
more popular with the Russian 
neuropsychologist,

637
00:31:30,971 --> 00:31:32,050
but it's pretty good.
One,

638
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:33,483
you can think about the front part of 
the brain is being concerned with motor 

639
00:31:35,621 --> 00:31:36,454
output.

640
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:37,953
And so there's the motor strip that 
allows you to sequence activities and 

641
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:42,874
then you know,
to make these kinetic melodies that are 

642
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:46,420
chains of things that you know how to 
do.

643
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,793
Um,
and then in front of that is the 

644
00:31:49,421 --> 00:31:53,530
prefrontal cortex and the prefrontal 
cortex grew out of the motor cortex.

645
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,753
And that's pretty interesting because if
you think about that from an 

646
00:31:57,131 --> 00:31:57,964
evolutionary perspective,
what that implies is that thought is 

647
00:32:01,361 --> 00:32:04,570
abstracted action,
right?

648
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:05,703
Because that's where it came from.
And so basically what you're doing when 

649
00:32:07,661 --> 00:32:08,494
you're thinking is you're figuring out 
action sequences that you could 

650
00:32:11,531 --> 00:32:12,364
implement and modeling their 
consequences and evaluating them before 

651
00:32:15,821 --> 00:32:16,654
you implement them in behavior.
And that's why I think it was Alfred 

652
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,810
North Whitehead though I should might be
getting that wrong.

653
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,170
He said,
uh,

654
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,520
we think so that our thoughts can die 
instead of us.

655
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,710
It's a lovely way of thinking about a 
day.

656
00:32:29,711 --> 00:32:30,544
So it's sort of like we generate 
abstract avatars of ourselves acting in 

657
00:32:35,141 --> 00:32:37,720
the world.
And if the Avatar does something stupid,

658
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,930
Bang,
we,

659
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,220
we kill it often and we don't implement 
it in our own bodies.

660
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,383
That's smart.
So basically we're thrown off abstract 

661
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:49,550
representations of ourselves so they can
perish instead of us.

662
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:50,763
It's pretty cool.
So also what you do when you're playing 

663
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:53,204
video games.
So does anybody know where the word 

664
00:32:57,021 --> 00:32:58,130
Avatar came from?

665
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,400
Anybody?
Uh,

666
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,540
uh,
uh,

667
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,393
directly.

668
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,200
Yeah,
that's exactly right.

669
00:33:10,201 --> 00:33:13,140
So an Avatar is the embodiment of the 
daddy on earth.

670
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,280
He's such a cool idea.
It's so interesting that that would word

671
00:33:17,281 --> 00:33:18,114
was,
was used to represent your fictional 

672
00:33:19,561 --> 00:33:21,870
self insight in a video game.
You know,

673
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:22,853
it's one of the mysteries about words.
You never know how those things get 

674
00:33:24,871 --> 00:33:27,000
generated or catch on,
you know,

675
00:33:27,001 --> 00:33:31,700
but it's such a,
it's such an interesting idea that you,

676
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,573
you know,
you,

677
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:33,563
you limit yourself in some interesting 
way and toss yourself into an abstract 

678
00:33:36,601 --> 00:33:38,910
world and you think that's really fun,
you know?

679
00:33:38,911 --> 00:33:39,744
And then that thing dies and gets reborn
or does whatever the hell it wants to 

680
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:44,130
do.
And you think that's very entertaining,

681
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,550
but the real you is behind that,
you know,

682
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,590
so you can toss off all,
uh,

683
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,483
what do you call,
pseudo selves in a sense and play about 

684
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,750
with them without any real costs.
Few and maybe with some benefit.

685
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,910
And that the term for that is your 
avatar.

686
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,560
That's very cool.
That,

687
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,060
so anyways,

688
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:09,970
it is an extension of what you do with 
your capacity to abstract,

689
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,660
right?
Cause you're,

690
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:13,730
you're producing simulated worlds and 
you act in a simulated way.

691
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,593
And,
and that's what you do when you were 

692
00:34:15,161 --> 00:34:17,000
imagining things,
you know?

693
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:19,810
So that's what you do when you write 
books of fiction.

694
00:34:19,811 --> 00:34:21,400
That's what you do when you go to a 
movie.

695
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:24,250
And so all avatars,
one thing,

696
00:34:24,251 --> 00:34:27,910
one form or another.
So some of those are archetipal avatars.

697
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:31,270
Okay.
So the way the Russians,

698
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:32,943
the Russians had a very,
very long and illustrious history of 

699
00:34:36,161 --> 00:34:37,960
producing psychologists.
And so,

700
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,900
and I'm hoping I'm getting this right to
Pavlov.

701
00:34:40,901 --> 00:34:42,940
You know,
about Pavlov and Pavlov's dog.

702
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,833
Pavlov was Leery as instructor.
And luria was the instructor of Vinegar 

703
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:50,320
Dova and socal off who discovered the 
orienting response,

704
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:51,154
which we're going to talk about it a lot
because I think it's the most important 

705
00:34:53,231 --> 00:34:55,270
discovery that was ever made in 
neuroscience.

706
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,593
Um,
they should have gotten a Nobel prize 

707
00:34:57,251 --> 00:34:59,380
for that for sure.
Um,

708
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:00,573
and then soak law of in vinegar,
dover were precursors to gray and great 

709
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,343
wrote,
developed the most well thought through 

710
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:12,190
theory of anxiety and incentive 
motivation.

711
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,060
And so,
um,

712
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:15,883
you,
it's useful to kind of know that 

713
00:35:16,961 --> 00:35:21,040
developmental history luria was also 
influenced by Piaget by the way.

714
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:25,540
And he was also influenced by a thinker 
from mit called Norbert Wiener,

715
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:29,800
which is like the perfect name for 
someone who goes to mit.

716
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:31,300
But anyways,
he was a real,

717
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,770
he was a real genius.
This guy,

718
00:35:32,771 --> 00:35:35,410
what are the pioneers of artificial 
intelligence research?

719
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,543
And he developed cybernetic of embodied 
cognition and the cybernetic models are 

720
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:45,150
the models that gray uses in his 
neuropsychology of anxiety.

721
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,023
And so it's,
it's nice to know the history of the 

722
00:35:47,431 --> 00:35:51,510
development of these ideas because you 
see how things connect behind the scenes

723
00:35:51,511 --> 00:35:52,344
in ways that you wouldn't really think 
possible took me years to figure out 

724
00:35:55,561 --> 00:35:56,394
those,
those intellectual connections by the 

725
00:35:58,111 --> 00:35:59,070
way.
So,

726
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:03,083
so if you remember them,
then you won't have to spend years 

727
00:36:04,351 --> 00:36:07,050
figuring them up yourself.
So anyways,

728
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,263
one of the ways that luria 
conceptualized the brain was as motor 

729
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:13,704
versus sensory.
And so the motor was the motor circuit 

730
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,573
and then the prefrontal cortex.
And so that determined the range of 

731
00:36:21,451 --> 00:36:22,284
potentials that you could manifest in 
time and space and also helped you 

732
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:29,160
implement them.
And then the back of the brain basically

733
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,720
that rough,
roughly speaking,

734
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:31,554
the back half was the sensory half and 
the sensory half is a lot of it's 

735
00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:36,390
auditory.
And again,

736
00:36:36,391 --> 00:36:39,630
that's about here.
And a huge chunk of it is visual.

737
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,440
And then there's,
uh,

738
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,553
there's,
there's areas that are more central to 

739
00:36:46,411 --> 00:36:47,244
the brain that are much,
much older that are associated with 

740
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,430
olfaction and taste.
Cause those are the,

741
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:54,720
has been around for a very,
very long period of time.

742
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,040
And the smell circuits in and taste 
circuits are extraordinarily archaic.

743
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:02,910
So they're not part of the,
roughly speaking the sensory cortex.

744
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,190
So you can think of motor versus 
sensory,

745
00:37:05,191 --> 00:37:08,070
that sort of front versus back 
distinction.

746
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,460
And then you can also think about a left
versus right distinction.

747
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:12,863
So,
and people often think of the left as 

748
00:37:14,911 --> 00:37:18,690
the linguistic hemisphere and the right 
as the non-linguistic hemisphere.

749
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,640
And that's roughly accurate if you're 
talking about lefthanded males.

750
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,493
And,
and it's roughly accurate for everyone 

751
00:37:24,721 --> 00:37:25,554
else too,
but,

752
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,513
but it's mostly accurate for them cause 
there's more complications in brain 

753
00:37:29,401 --> 00:37:32,280
lateralization in people.
It's not a simple thing.

754
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:33,923
One of Leary,
a student's guide named El Conan 

755
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,873
Goldberg,
came up with an alternative theory of 

756
00:37:40,021 --> 00:37:42,120
hemispheric function,
which I think is better.

757
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,000
Um,
he thought that the right hemisphere was

758
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:45,834
specialized for the initial stages of 
novelty analysis and detection and that 

759
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:53,910
the left hemisphere was specialized for,
um,

760
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,103
creation of the detailed responses to 
those things and the storage of those 

761
00:37:58,891 --> 00:38:01,500
detailed responses,
particularly in the back of the,

762
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,950
in the back of the brain.
So he thought of the right hemisphere is

763
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:09,300
an anomaly detection.
And first stage modeling system that was

764
00:38:09,301 --> 00:38:10,134
primarily under limbic control and he 
thought that the linguistic capacities 

765
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:14,574
of the left hemisphere,
we're merely a reflection of its 

766
00:38:16,831 --> 00:38:19,650
capacity to generate detailed 
representations.

767
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:20,821
So,
and I,

768
00:38:20,821 --> 00:38:21,654
I'm telling you that for a specific 
reason because it's relevant to graze 

769
00:38:24,031 --> 00:38:24,864
model.

770
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,150
Okay.

771
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:27,491
Oh,
okay.

772
00:38:27,491 --> 00:38:30,970
So I'm going to describe to you an 
integration,

773
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:36,030
roughly speaking between Swanson's 
mortal and graze model and the orienting

774
00:38:36,641 --> 00:38:39,580
reflex mod models of soul,
clove and vote Victor Cordova.

775
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:40,563
Now
people started to get interested in the 

776
00:38:44,351 --> 00:38:47,230
lower levels of the brain.
Really I would say,

777
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,120
well the animal psychologists got there 
first,

778
00:38:49,121 --> 00:38:52,030
but there was a flurry of activity 
around the hippocampus,

779
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:52,864
particularly in the 1960s and that was 
begun first by the Russians who are 

780
00:38:56,951 --> 00:38:59,350
playing around with electrical,
um,

781
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,393
eeg analysis of brain function.
So I know your brain produces a lot of 

782
00:39:04,811 --> 00:39:05,644
electrical activity,
but a 100 watt light bulbs where 

783
00:39:08,201 --> 00:39:09,034
something like that,
when it's busily buzzing away on all of 

784
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:11,874
the things that it does and you could 
get some low resolution insight into 

785
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:15,874
brain function by analyzing the 
different patterns of electrical 

786
00:39:19,061 --> 00:39:19,894
activity it produces.
It's been likened to listening to a 

787
00:39:21,911 --> 00:39:26,830
symphony with a stethoscope stethoscope 
through a six foot concrete shell,

788
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:31,540
which is approximately correct,
but it's an investigative technique that

789
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:32,530
has some utility.

790
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,650
Now.
It turns out that,

791
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,870
so imagine that I,
I did this to you,

792
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,240
I put you in a chair and I strapped eeg 
electrodes to you.

793
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:47,380
And then now and then I have you 
listened to a beep,

794
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:48,700
beep,
beep,

795
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,100
beep,
and then there'd be a little fraction of

796
00:39:51,101 --> 00:39:55,240
time and I'd play a louder beep beep.
And then that was allowed to beat by the

797
00:39:55,241 --> 00:39:56,074
way.
And then there'd be some beeps after 

798
00:39:57,971 --> 00:39:58,804
that.
And then if I did that to you a hundred 

799
00:40:01,061 --> 00:40:01,894
times and then I averaged the manner in 
which your brain waves were manifesting 

800
00:40:06,341 --> 00:40:08,350
themselves across all those hundred 
times,

801
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:09,423
I could extract out a particular pattern
of brainwave that was locked to that 

802
00:40:13,871 --> 00:40:18,670
stimulus.
And so then I could infer I couldn't,

803
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,713
I would first of all have the wave form,
which would have a temporal element and 

804
00:40:22,691 --> 00:40:23,524
I could actually do some calculations if
my instrumentation was sophisticated 

805
00:40:26,831 --> 00:40:30,490
enough about exactly where that wave 
form was emanating.

806
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
So keep that in the back of your mind.
What soak glove and vinegar Dova started

807
00:40:36,611 --> 00:40:38,320
investigating was.
So that was,

808
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:40,300
that's an electrophysiological 
investigation.

809
00:40:40,301 --> 00:40:42,790
What they started investigating with 
something a bit simpler,

810
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,530
which was skin conductance response.
So it turns out that if I take you and I

811
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:48,423
put you,
this is what the scientologists used to 

812
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:51,760
read in grounds.
By the way,

813
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,550
in case you're wondering,
um,

814
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:58,900
in grams or memory traces that are 
theoretically left from the time that we

815
00:40:58,901 --> 00:41:01,270
inhabited Venus,
I think that's their theories.

816
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,890
Um,
it's something like that.

817
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:07,570
So if I put you in a chair and I hook up
electrodes to your hands,

818
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:11,080
I can pass a current through the 
electrodes through your skin.

819
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,453
And how well that current is transmitted
is going to depend on how much you're 

820
00:41:15,611 --> 00:41:19,480
sweating and how much you're sweating is
going to depend on how much your body is

821
00:41:19,481 --> 00:41:20,830
preparing to act.

822
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:21,913
Because one of the things that happens 
if it starts to prepare to do something 

823
00:41:24,311 --> 00:41:26,560
is that sweats a little bit.
And that's,

824
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,020
I presume,
because if you start acting,

825
00:41:29,021 --> 00:41:29,854
you're going to get hot.
And so he might as well prepare to cool 

826
00:41:31,271 --> 00:41:32,860
yourself.
Now it happens very,

827
00:41:32,861 --> 00:41:36,740
very fast.
So if I play a tone to you,

828
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,380
you're sitting there and all of a sudden
the tone goes off.

829
00:41:39,381 --> 00:41:42,410
What will happen is that your skin 
conductance will increase.

830
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,740
And then if I play the tone again,
it,

831
00:41:44,741 --> 00:41:47,120
it'll increase again,
but less.

832
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:47,983
And then it'll increase again.
But last and then soon I can play the 

833
00:41:50,931 --> 00:41:51,764
tone to you and it's flat.
Now then if I take the tone and I 

834
00:41:56,751 --> 00:41:59,120
increased the volume,
or if I change the pitch,

835
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:03,710
or if I even changed the timing of it,
any little tiny change whatsoever,

836
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,930
and I play the tone to you,
bang,

837
00:42:05,931 --> 00:42:08,480
the original response will be 
reinstated.

838
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,120
So the Russians were thinking about 
this,

839
00:42:11,121 --> 00:42:11,954
they were thinking,
okay,

840
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,340
well what?
What does that imply?

841
00:42:13,341 --> 00:42:14,300
And they thought,
well,

842
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,393
it has,
it's analogous to an earlier phenomenon 

843
00:42:20,081 --> 00:42:23,810
that was known as habituation.
So if you take a snail,

844
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,510
it'll come out of its shell and you tap 
it,

845
00:42:26,511 --> 00:42:30,410
then it'll go into a shell and then it 
will slowly come out of its shell.

846
00:42:30,411 --> 00:42:31,244
You can tap it again.
And if you're into teasing snails and 

847
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,810
um,
if you do that enough,

848
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:38,180
the stale,
we'll just start to ignore you.

849
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:43,570
Now you could call that fatigue because 
it might be fatigue or you could call it

850
00:42:43,671 --> 00:42:44,504
habituation is what happens is the 
sensory nerves are no longer sending a 

851
00:42:48,711 --> 00:42:51,110
signal to the motor nerves to make the 
thing contract.

852
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:53,390
And so that's habituation.
It's a form of learning.

853
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:54,403
It's a form of learned irrelevance.
Now Soak love and vinegar Dova weren't 

854
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,353
satisfied with the sort of odd 
hermiticity that was implied by the 

855
00:43:04,011 --> 00:43:04,844
habituation models.
And so they came up with a slightly 

856
00:43:06,621 --> 00:43:11,621
different suggestion for what was 
happening when the orienting response

857
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:13,130
yeah.

858
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:13,963
Was he was declining across time.
They suggested that what you did when 

859
00:43:17,091 --> 00:43:21,560
you were listening to a tone was to 
build an interior model of the tone.

860
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,413
And that was,
it was a representation of the tone in 

861
00:43:25,161 --> 00:43:28,790
all of it's important dimensions in so 
far as you were capable of doing that,

862
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:29,713
you know,
with your particular level of hearing 

863
00:43:31,011 --> 00:43:35,930
acuity and that you had inferred that 
the tone was irrelevant.

864
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,740
So you've mapped it in the map says this
is safe territory,

865
00:43:39,741 --> 00:43:43,580
and then when the tone occurs,
the map inhibits your response.

866
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:46,340
If something like that,
the model inhibits your response.

867
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:47,413
And so the idea would be you're always 
carrying a model of the world around in 

868
00:43:50,271 --> 00:43:51,104
your head that you've learned and as 
long as the world is behaving in 

869
00:43:53,211 --> 00:43:56,120
accordance with that model,
then you stay calm.

870
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,580
A very,
very smart idea.

871
00:43:58,581 --> 00:43:59,414
And so the orienting reflects is that 
initial response when something happens 

872
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,810
that your map does not cover.

873
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,053
Okay.

874
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,080
And they localize that to the 
hippocampus,

875
00:44:15,081 --> 00:44:17,780
which is very good at them with their 
primitive equipment.

876
00:44:17,781 --> 00:44:20,540
Back in the 1960s these were very,
very smart people.

877
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,213
The Russians got there way before the 
North Americans and they western 

878
00:44:25,581 --> 00:44:26,414
Europeans because who are the only ones 
doing investigations into this sort of 

879
00:44:29,511 --> 00:44:30,344
thing at that time,
because the Russians had figured out 

880
00:44:33,391 --> 00:44:34,224
very early that the brain was stuck 
inside the body and so that bodily 

881
00:44:37,831 --> 00:44:38,664
responses and emotional responses and 
motivational responses were were valid 

882
00:44:42,961 --> 00:44:43,794
indexes of of brain activity.
It took the western neuropsychologists 

883
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,990
till the 1990s really to start figuring 
this out.

884
00:44:51,991 --> 00:44:55,590
And it was Antonio Damasio who,
who led the way he,

885
00:44:55,591 --> 00:44:56,424
uh,
he had generated this hypothesis called 

886
00:44:58,321 --> 00:44:59,154
the somatic marker hypothesis would be 
that part of the way that you evaluate 

887
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:07,440
things when they occur is by reading off
the report of your body.

888
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:08,843
You know,
cause it's going to react in various 

889
00:45:09,691 --> 00:45:10,320
different ways.

890
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,240
And that's going to tell you what the 
thing is.

891
00:45:12,241 --> 00:45:13,074
And the way reason he figured that out 
was because he was reading abstracts 

892
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:17,514
from Russian neuropsychologists and he 
was the only one doing it in the late 

893
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,930
eighties.
As far as I can tell though,

894
00:45:21,931 --> 00:45:22,764
I was doing it too.
But that was because I read gray and 

895
00:45:24,991 --> 00:45:26,130
gray had done it.
So,

896
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:29,730
so anyways,
the Russians got there very early and it

897
00:45:29,731 --> 00:45:30,564
was so clove and vinegar Dova that 
basically is basically identified the 

898
00:45:34,471 --> 00:45:35,304
orienting response.
And the reason I think that deserves a 

899
00:45:36,691 --> 00:45:41,220
Nobel prize is because it's the bloody 
thing that piaget was talking about.

900
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:46,370
You know how Piaget would say that a 
child will run through its Schemas,

901
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,213
right?
And if the Schema produces something 

902
00:45:49,411 --> 00:45:50,610
novel,
you know,

903
00:45:50,611 --> 00:45:51,444
so the kid is moving its arms and bang 
it wax into a little immobile and the 

904
00:45:55,561 --> 00:45:58,020
child Sorta startles but says do it 
again.

905
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,300
You know,
and so then it tries to do it again.

906
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:01,134
So it tries to replicate the emergence 
of the phenomena by modeling it's 

907
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:10,050
interactions with it and constructing a 
psycho motor perceptual schema.

908
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:15,290
But the initial like burst of awareness,
that's an orienting reflects.

909
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:20,340
And so what soak love and vinegar Nova 
discovered was how people reacted to the

910
00:46:20,341 --> 00:46:23,310
unknown.
And that's a major thing man.

911
00:46:23,311 --> 00:46:24,144
Because everything you learn is a 
consequence of you interacting with the 

912
00:46:27,781 --> 00:46:29,640
unknown.
So,

913
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,240
you know,
it's a huge discovery and you know,

914
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:36,630
it's psychology is a funny science 
because we never,

915
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:39,510
we've never really figured out when 
we've discovered something that's really

916
00:46:39,511 --> 00:46:40,680
worth discovering.
And,

917
00:46:40,681 --> 00:46:42,540
but uh,
like the discovery,

918
00:46:42,541 --> 00:46:43,374
the orienting reflects that was like a 
home run milner olds and milner 

919
00:46:46,651 --> 00:46:49,770
discovered the reward system,
the incentive reward system.

920
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:54,130
When was that?
I think that was in the take.

921
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:55,970
That was in the early seventies it was 
like that.

922
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:56,803
It was Nobel prize winning stuff too.
It's like it's the whole circuit for 

923
00:47:00,721 --> 00:47:01,554
positive emotion and exploration.
It's like that's a big deal to discover 

924
00:47:04,891 --> 00:47:05,461
that,
you know,

925
00:47:05,461 --> 00:47:06,294
and then Panksepp discovered the play 
circuit and that's another whopping 

926
00:47:09,331 --> 00:47:10,164
discovery.
Like I really do think these things are 

927
00:47:11,791 --> 00:47:14,730
equivalent to discovery continents.
It's a big deal.

928
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:16,530
But you know,
for some reason

929
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:22,140
I don't know what it is.
It's not modesty I don't think,

930
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,490
but let's,
psychologists don't seem to be that good

931
00:47:26,491 --> 00:47:27,324
at figuring out when what they've 
discovered is like a major league 

932
00:47:29,981 --> 00:47:31,660
discovery.
So.

933
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:32,533
All right.

934
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:33,913
Hmm.

935
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:41,610
So what happened with regards to Soak 
Lovan Vinegar Dover?

936
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,340
There,
there was a whole flurry of,

937
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:47,950
of,
of ideas that their research generated.

938
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,770
A lot of that was among artificial 
intelligence,

939
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:53,260
um,
investigators.

940
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,133
And what they basically concluded was 
that the way that creatures work in the 

941
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:04,231
world was that they produced expectancy 
maps

942
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:07,263
of how the world would lay itself out 
when they acted in a particular way and 

943
00:48:10,991 --> 00:48:14,980
then they would transform the mortal 
internally.

944
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:16,773
This is probably how you think.
You think they transformed the model 

945
00:48:19,481 --> 00:48:22,660
internally and make a prediction about 
what the outcome of their behavior would

946
00:48:22,661 --> 00:48:23,494
be
and then that would manifest that 

947
00:48:25,781 --> 00:48:29,350
behavior.
So the idea is stimulus.

948
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,350
First of all,
the idea was stimulus response.

949
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,080
And that's actually true if you don't go
much above the spine.

950
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,570
So at the behaviors were,
we're right about that.

951
00:48:37,571 --> 00:48:38,404
There are deterministic levels at which 
the nervous system operates or or 

952
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:43,810
roughly deterministic.

953
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:46,630
But as the amount of brain tissue 
increases,

954
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:50,020
as the number of processing interfaces 
increases,

955
00:48:50,021 --> 00:48:54,010
the number of neuro connections between 
stimulus and response increase.

956
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:55,143
The idea that it's deterministic starts 
to fall apart because it's chained 

957
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,210
complex chain networks of activity 
between the,

958
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:02,403
you know,
the action or the stimulus and the 

959
00:49:04,091 --> 00:49:04,924
action.
But there are circuits that are really 

960
00:49:06,221 --> 00:49:07,054
simple.
It's just one neuron or two neurons and 

961
00:49:08,201 --> 00:49:10,270
those things are super fast and you need
them.

962
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:11,493
You know,
if you're going to jump out of the way 

963
00:49:11,921 --> 00:49:13,150
of the snake,
for example,

964
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,160
you're going to be sitting there 
thinking about snakes.

965
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:18,460
It's like you want your eyes to activate
your spinal cord.

966
00:49:18,461 --> 00:49:21,070
So you jumped to the side that's not 
conscious.

967
00:49:21,071 --> 00:49:23,050
It's like it's way too fast to be 
conscious.

968
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:25,720
So when we've,
we've conserved all those,

969
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:26,823
you know,
archaic systems because we need to be 

970
00:49:28,271 --> 00:49:29,104
fast and you can model the way those 
archaic systems work by using the 

971
00:49:33,491 --> 00:49:34,324
standard tendance of behaviorism.
And you can get quite long way doing 

972
00:49:37,511 --> 00:49:39,170
that,
but you can't get everywhere.

973
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:41,620
So the mapping idea that I'm describing 
is,

974
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:43,880
um,
mean in part it's,

975
00:49:43,881 --> 00:49:47,140
it's the entrance of,
of cognition into the,

976
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,240
into,
into behaviorism.

977
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,410
It's part of it.
It was,

978
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:52,690
it was more complicated than that,
but that was part of it.

979
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:54,063
So,

980
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,400
you know,
and that kind of makes sense.

981
00:49:57,401 --> 00:50:00,400
I suspect that's the way you think.
You think,

982
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:02,680
you know,
you see something,

983
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:04,653
you think about what it is,
you figure out what you're going to do 

984
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:09,220
and then you do it.
And then it either works,

985
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,360
in which case that's great for everyone 
or it doesn't work.

986
00:50:13,361 --> 00:50:17,050
And then you have an orienting reflex 
that was their basic idea,

987
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:18,363
you know,
and it's,

988
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:19,840
it's pretty smart idea.

989
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:26,840
It turns out to be wrong in many 
complicated,

990
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:30,110
and I can't even tell you exactly why 
it's wrong,

991
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:30,973
although I do know that part of the 
reason that it's wrong is that it turns 

992
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:36,074
out that it's way more complicated to 
produce these damn models than anybody 

993
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:39,494
thought because the behavior is to at 
that point and Soak Lovan vinod grid 

994
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:46,400
over we're behaviors.
They kind of had this implicit idea.

995
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:51,670
You think stimulus response.
Now in between that there's a black box,

996
00:50:52,191 --> 00:50:53,600
right?
That's whatever the brain is doing.

997
00:50:53,601 --> 00:50:54,434
They didn't care about that because they
didn't think you had to take it into 

998
00:50:56,391 --> 00:50:57,224
consideration.
But there's still two other elements of 

999
00:50:59,331 --> 00:51:03,680
that theory.
One element is there is a stimulus.

1000
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:07,130
Another element is there is a response.
Well,

1001
00:51:07,131 --> 00:51:11,420
we won't go into the response part yet,
but we will go into the stimulus part.

1002
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:13,003
It's like,
let's say that you look at someone 

1003
00:51:15,381 --> 00:51:17,360
attractive and your heart rate 
increases.

1004
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,670
Okay,
what's the stimulus

1005
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,750
exactly?
The person,

1006
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,990
you know,
the person's eyes,

1007
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:32,420
the way their eyes are configured in 
relationship to the rest of their face.

1008
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:36,230
Um,
older shape,

1009
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:38,540
um,
context.

1010
00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:41,150
What's the stimulus?
And the answer is,

1011
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:43,400
well,
who the hell knows?

1012
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:48,370
Because figuring out what the stimulus 
is turns out to be hard and the behavior

1013
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:50,060
is they just pretended that no,
no.

1014
00:51:50,061 --> 00:51:52,610
Everything was made out of homogenous 
blocks.

1015
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:54,950
And when you looked at them,
there they were,

1016
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,110
and that was the stimulus,
roughly speaking.

1017
00:51:57,111 --> 00:51:57,944
So they pretended,
they got rid of having to consider the 

1018
00:52:00,831 --> 00:52:01,664
complexity of the brain.
Remember half year damn cortex is 

1019
00:52:05,061 --> 00:52:08,270
devoted to seeing it turns out that 
seeing is very difficult.

1020
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:09,463
The behavior's just the funnest.
That by by just pretending it wasn't a 

1021
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:13,964
problem,
they just assumed the stimulus was 

1022
00:52:16,371 --> 00:52:18,290
given.
So it was like,

1023
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:21,133
there's the box,
there's a picture of the box on your 

1024
00:52:22,971 --> 00:52:23,804
retina.

1025
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:27,350
That picture is translated into the 
little guy inside your hand.

1026
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:29,540
And then he figures out how to move your
arms.

1027
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:30,763
It's like,
well,

1028
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,930
that's not right.
It's not right.

1029
00:52:32,931 --> 00:52:35,210
Because it's very difficult to specify 
the stimulus.

1030
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:36,463
It's extraordinarily difficult.
And that's part of the reason why it's 

1031
00:52:39,661 --> 00:52:41,930
been,
it's taken so long to develop artificial

1032
00:52:41,931 --> 00:52:45,530
intelligence and you can't teach the 
damn things to see.

1033
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:49,010
And that's because there's no edges.
There's no lines.

1034
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:49,903
There's no primary objects.
All of that is something that our brain 

1035
00:52:52,581 --> 00:52:54,980
constructs for us on the fly 
instantaneously.

1036
00:52:54,981 --> 00:52:55,814
So we think it's just there.
But some of you have probably played 

1037
00:52:58,761 --> 00:53:01,340
with photoshop trying to adjust an image
chain.

1038
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:02,803
It's like,
are there lines in that image or there 

1039
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:05,930
are,
there are edges.

1040
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:08,420
It's like not at all.
You increase the resolution,

1041
00:53:08,421 --> 00:53:13,421
it just turns into a massive pixels that
are fundamentally indistinguishable from

1042
00:53:13,701 --> 00:53:14,420
one another.

1043
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,253
Like if you,
if you take a photograph of someone and 

1044
00:53:17,151 --> 00:53:21,110
you try to cut them out and put them 
against a different background,

1045
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:21,944
what you find right away is that you end
up with this cutout looking thing 

1046
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:28,760
because you're,
you're trying to make something into it.

1047
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:29,663
A manipulable object that's segregated 
from the world that actually isn't 

1048
00:53:33,631 --> 00:53:36,270
represented that way in the photograph 
at all.

1049
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,940
You might see it that way and in fact 
you do.

1050
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:41,370
But if you start to play with the 
representation,

1051
00:53:41,371 --> 00:53:43,380
you find that just like,
it's like,

1052
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:44,243
it's pixels all the way down.
And so it's very hard and photoshop is 

1053
00:53:47,671 --> 00:53:50,460
pretty damn sophisticated.
It'll do edge detection for you,

1054
00:53:50,461 --> 00:53:51,240
you know?
But it's,

1055
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,380
it's Kinda rough.
It's,

1056
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,690
it's,
it's not enough to fool your eyes.

1057
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:57,900
So it's hard to see things.
So that was one of the,

1058
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,390
that's actually one of the places where 
behavior is,

1059
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,120
which we will talk more about,
started to fall apart.

1060
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,080
It was like,
oh,

1061
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,273
it turns out the problem is a problem of
the stimulus is like way more 

1062
00:54:07,891 --> 00:54:08,724
complicated than we thought.
And then it also turned out that the 

1063
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:13,080
problem of the behavior was way more 
complicated.

1064
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:14,393
So the basic,
so let's say you train a wrap to run 

1065
00:54:16,411 --> 00:54:17,244
down the runway,
and the way you do that is you take the 

1066
00:54:20,581 --> 00:54:24,660
rap and he make sure he's hungry.
Skinner's rats,

1067
00:54:24,690 --> 00:54:25,351
bf,
skinner,

1068
00:54:25,351 --> 00:54:26,184
he was like the dean of behaviorism.
His rats were starved to 75% of their 

1069
00:54:30,271 --> 00:54:34,240
body weight.
So a Skinnerian rack was a weird rap.

1070
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:38,100
It was really lonesome and isolated and 
it was starving and so,

1071
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:41,700
and so you could kind of treat it like a
one dimensional entity,

1072
00:54:41,701 --> 00:54:43,410
right?
Cause it would do anything for food.

1073
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:48,450
So it was an extraordinarily hungry rat.
And then it was also an isolated frat.

1074
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,420
So it was a simplified model of an 
actual rat.

1075
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:54,030
And that's a simplified model of a human
being.

1076
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:55,493
And you know,
you might think that I'm not very fond 

1077
00:54:57,721 --> 00:55:00,180
of the idea that you can model human 
beings with rats,

1078
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:02,490
but I'm actually extremely fond of it 
because,

1079
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,700
uh,
a rack is a way,

1080
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:05,534
Barrett better model of who you are.
Then your model of who you are is a 

1081
00:55:08,641 --> 00:55:10,320
model of who you are.
You know,

1082
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,273
so a rat is a lot more like you then 
you're thought of you is like you and 

1083
00:55:15,541 --> 00:55:17,730
rats,
like give the guy some credit man.

1084
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:19,490
Those things are smart,
you know,

1085
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,090
and they are like us in many,
many,

1086
00:55:21,091 --> 00:55:23,220
many ways,
many important ways.

1087
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,233
So you can get along way with a rat.
And I think I told you at the beginning 

1088
00:55:26,701 --> 00:55:27,534
of this class is like part of the 
pharmacology that a lobster uses to 

1089
00:55:30,631 --> 00:55:31,464
determine its position in a dominance 
hierarchy is the same pharmacology that 

1090
00:55:34,951 --> 00:55:36,150
you use.
So you know,

1091
00:55:36,151 --> 00:55:39,930
you're quite a bit like a lobster,
but you're even more like Iraq.

1092
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:42,240
So that's enough compliments for one 
day.

1093
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:43,583
So,

1094
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:49,143
okay,
so so the behavior is modeled as simple 

1095
00:55:50,711 --> 00:55:51,544
behaviors model didn't work out so well 
and neither did the idea that in some 

1096
00:55:55,181 --> 00:55:56,014
way you were generating a,
an accurate model of the world and then 

1097
00:56:00,491 --> 00:56:01,324
you were comparing the actual world to 
that model and that that's how you 

1098
00:56:05,651 --> 00:56:09,670
planned your behavior.
There's lots about that.

1099
00:56:09,671 --> 00:56:11,500
That's true,
but but there's lots of boat.

1100
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:12,790
If it isn't,
so anyways,

1101
00:56:12,791 --> 00:56:13,624
I'm going to treat it like it's true for
the time being because we can get quite 

1102
00:56:15,671 --> 00:56:20,671
a long ways with low resolution theories
even if they're not completely right.

1103
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:22,144
They may still have tremendous benefits 
and behaviorism had tremendous benefits 

1104
00:56:24,761 --> 00:56:25,594
because we learned all sorts of things 
about behavior in the brain from the 

1105
00:56:27,761 --> 00:56:28,594
behaviors.
Almost everything we know from a 

1106
00:56:31,091 --> 00:56:35,560
scientific perspective about psychology,
it's behaviorists.

1107
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:39,130
I've learned way more from the animal 
researchers than from anyone else except

1108
00:56:39,131 --> 00:56:42,200
for the clinicians way more there,
there,

1109
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:43,053
there,
there.

1110
00:56:43,230 --> 00:56:46,630
They're so careful in their terminology 
and their scientific approach.

1111
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,153
Okay.

1112
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:50,923
Yeah.

1113
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:55,360
You remember that little oval.
Then I keep showing you point B,

1114
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:58,450
point a you're trying to get from point 
a to point b.

1115
00:56:58,660 --> 00:56:59,493
And point B is a representation and 
point a is a representation 

1116
00:57:02,471 --> 00:57:03,690
fundamentally.
And then you,

1117
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:07,030
you know,
you invoke actions or perceptual schemes

1118
00:57:07,031 --> 00:57:10,630
that are necessary to translate one 
state into the other.

1119
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:11,763
Okay?
Now imagine for a moment what the 

1120
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:20,490
primary biological brain systems do is 
grab hold of that oval and they say,

1121
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:25,330
point a,
you're hungry.

1122
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:27,700
Point B,
you need food.

1123
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:32,770
Here's the behaviors and the perceptions
that of you that you've used in the past

1124
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:37,060
to solve that problem.
Let's prime them and implement them.

1125
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:42,340
And so that's what's happening during 
your day is like you get hungry,

1126
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:45,730
the hypothalamus grabs that little oval 
and now you're,

1127
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:46,743
you're under the control of the 
hypothalamic perceptual and motor 

1128
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,233
functions.
Now it's connected to the rest of the 

1129
00:57:53,921 --> 00:57:54,280
brain.

1130
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,680
So it's going to do this in a pretty 
sophisticated way,

1131
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:57,633
but it's going to call on procedures and
routines that you already know in order 

1132
00:58:02,291 --> 00:58:03,610
to solve the problem.
Like,

1133
00:58:03,611 --> 00:58:06,160
you know where the fridge is,
you know how to open the peanut butter,

1134
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:08,680
whatever it is you're going to eat.
You know how to hold a knife,

1135
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:09,873
you know,
so all those things are going to be 

1136
00:58:10,781 --> 00:58:13,060
primed.
The,

1137
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:14,553
the behaviorists thought of that.
They thought of the action of the 

1138
00:58:16,841 --> 00:58:19,840
fundamental biological systems as 
drives.

1139
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:22,600
And there's a deterministic element to 
drive,

1140
00:58:22,601 --> 00:58:24,760
you know,
so you're hungry.

1141
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:25,833
The hunger makes you move your foot down
the stairs in a sort of stereotype 

1142
00:58:29,531 --> 00:58:30,370
manner.
Uh,

1143
00:58:30,371 --> 00:58:33,360
chaining of behavioral outputs,
simple reflexes,

1144
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:34,563
and it drives you to the fridge.
And that drives you to unscrew the 

1145
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:41,250
peanut butter and to take out the knife.
And these are all chained reflexes.

1146
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:43,570
It turns out that's wrong,
but,

1147
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:46,720
but it's an entry.
It's a useful and interesting model.

1148
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:48,243
What

1149
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:53,160
the way it was demonstrated that that 
was wrong.

1150
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:54,023
Okay,
so now we're going to go back to rats 

1151
00:58:54,841 --> 00:58:55,674
for a minute.
You've got a rat and you put them in 

1152
00:58:58,951 --> 00:59:00,520
the,
in a,

1153
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:02,940
in a maze and you want to teach them how
to get through the maze.

1154
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:07,380
So you put the rat there and then you 
put a little food pellet in front of the

1155
00:59:07,381 --> 00:59:10,320
rack.
And so then the rack reddens down in the

1156
00:59:10,321 --> 00:59:12,570
maze and eats the food palate.
Maybe it's only this far.

1157
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:16,980
And so then you put the rat back,
can you put a foot pet food pellet there

1158
00:59:16,981 --> 00:59:17,814
again?
And it runs down the runway and it gets 

1159
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:21,950
the food pellet.
And maybe you do three or four times and

1160
00:59:21,951 --> 00:59:25,070
you put the right back in the other cage
and they leave him for a day.

1161
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:28,370
And then the next day you take the same 
route and you put it back in and you put

1162
00:59:28,371 --> 00:59:30,230
the food pellet about three inches 
farther.

1163
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,350
And so it runs down there,
grabs the food pellet,

1164
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,473
et cetera.
And then you put another three inches 

1165
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:36,470
in,
another three inches,

1166
00:59:36,471 --> 00:59:37,304
another three inches,
and soon the rack is zipping through 

1167
00:59:38,811 --> 00:59:39,644
that through the maze.
And you can see how you could 

1168
00:59:41,331 --> 00:59:44,720
conceptualize that as the simple 
chaining of reflex behaviors,

1169
00:59:44,721 --> 00:59:45,450
right?
Cause it's,

1170
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:46,283
it's not that complicated.
The rat has to walk reflexive and then 

1171
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,830
just has to change in the reflexes 
together.

1172
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,220
And you want to have a simple model if 
you're a scientist.

1173
00:59:55,221 --> 00:59:58,640
And so that was the model.
But then some wise guy took a rat,

1174
00:59:58,970 --> 00:59:59,803
I can't remember his name unfortunately,
but he was extraordinarily funny as far 

1175
01:00:03,261 --> 01:00:04,094
as I'm concerned.
He took the rat and he caught up its 

1176
01:00:06,051 --> 01:00:11,051
back legs and then he put its back late 
on a little cart and then he put the rat

1177
01:00:11,151 --> 01:00:15,110
in the maze and sure enough the rap go 
like this through the maze to get to the

1178
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:15,740
end.

1179
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:16,573
And he said,
well obviously that's not reflex 

1180
01:00:17,811 --> 01:00:20,120
chaining because like rats don't have 
wheels,

1181
01:00:20,121 --> 01:00:23,960
but if you stick wheels on a rack it can
figure it out pretty damn quick.

1182
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:25,123
And so it was experiments like that that
blew apart the simple reflex chaining 

1183
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:32,180
hypothesis of behaviorism.
It's a very,

1184
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,073
that's a such a funny experiment to,
I mean they must've just cackled away 

1185
01:00:35,451 --> 01:00:37,340
when they come in a talk that went up.
It's like,

1186
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:39,500
talk about your ultimate nerd 
experiment,

1187
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:40,763
right.
Let's put wheels on this rat and see 

1188
01:00:42,141 --> 01:00:43,970
what happens.
Anyways,

1189
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:49,933
so soulful love and vinegar dove and a 
variety of other people started 

1190
01:00:52,071 --> 01:00:53,840
believing that,
you know,

1191
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:54,703
animals weren't simple chains of 
reflexes from sensation to behavioral 

1192
01:00:58,971 --> 01:00:59,804
output,
but that they generated models of the 

1193
01:01:01,701 --> 01:01:04,190
world.
And the basic model would be,

1194
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:08,900
and this is a cybernetic model,
this comes from Norbert Wiener from back

1195
01:01:08,901 --> 01:01:12,650
in the 1940s when he was studying 
simple,

1196
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:15,140
simple,
intelligent machines.

1197
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:20,300
And one of the things wiener worked on 
was anti missile systems.

1198
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:21,753
So cause you imagine,
so you get a muscle and it's zooming 

1199
01:01:23,871 --> 01:01:26,600
along and you want to shoot another 
missile added to it.

1200
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:27,463
Now that's a complicated problem.
It's trying to hit a moving target and 

1201
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:32,683
he construed that.
What the antimissile missiles should do 

1202
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:37,183
is track its trajectory towards the,
like the ideal trajectory towards the 

1203
01:01:41,901 --> 01:01:44,960
missile and then correct for deviations 
from that.

1204
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:46,513
So you know,
so if it got a little too far to the 

1205
01:01:47,811 --> 01:01:48,644
left then it would move to the right.
And then if it got a little too far to 

1206
01:01:50,271 --> 01:01:51,410
the right,
it would move to the left.

1207
01:01:51,411 --> 01:01:53,330
It's like a Thermostat,
you know,

1208
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:55,850
it's basically the same system that's in
a thermostat.

1209
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,820
It's the simplest form of intelligent 
behavior.

1210
01:01:59,660 --> 01:02:00,493
And that's actually the model that gray 
used was quite funny because when I was 

1211
01:02:03,951 --> 01:02:04,784
teaching about this in Boston,
I had an engineer in one of my classes 

1212
01:02:06,981 --> 01:02:10,200
and I went through the gray model,
which is the cybernetic model.

1213
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:10,971
And I,
and he said,

1214
01:02:10,971 --> 01:02:11,710
you know,
that's,

1215
01:02:11,710 --> 01:02:12,543
that's weird.
That's exactly the same system that we 

1216
01:02:13,941 --> 01:02:17,060
use to design and he missile missiles on
Jesus.

1217
01:02:17,061 --> 01:02:18,650
That's,
that's really weird.

1218
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:19,484
That's a of a coincidence.
And then the engineer went off to 

1219
01:02:21,511 --> 01:02:25,020
England where he met Jeffrey Gray and 
jet and he said that like,

1220
01:02:25,021 --> 01:02:27,150
isn't this an interesting coincidence?
And Grace said,

1221
01:02:27,151 --> 01:02:27,984
well,
it's not a coincidence because it was 

1222
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:30,443
the anti missile missile researchers 
work that or at least a branch of that 

1223
01:02:34,141 --> 01:02:37,860
work that had the same intellectual 
history as this particular theory.

1224
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:38,963
So,
you know,

1225
01:02:38,970 --> 01:02:41,610
that was quite cool.
And that's all stemming from this guy at

1226
01:02:41,611 --> 01:02:42,444
mit.
So imagine what happens is your 

1227
01:02:46,141 --> 01:02:47,790
hypothalamus says,
ah,

1228
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:49,410
you don't have enough sugar in your 
blood.

1229
01:02:49,411 --> 01:02:54,411
And so like it pops up this perceptual,
I call them motivation action maps.

1230
01:02:55,741 --> 01:02:56,461
What is it?
No,

1231
01:02:56,461 --> 01:02:57,230
I can't even remember.

1232
01:02:57,230 --> 01:02:58,860
But I called them,
um,

1233
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:03,260
motivation,
oh,

1234
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:04,910
it doesn't matter.
Um,

1235
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:05,851
there,
those little,

1236
01:03:05,851 --> 01:03:09,600
those little ovals and they contain a 
way of looking at the world.

1237
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:15,260
So a way of focusing in on the things 
that are relevant and they contain that.

1238
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:16,224
The,
the branching sequence of ready made 

1239
01:03:19,021 --> 01:03:22,020
actions and perceptions that you would 
use to solve the problem.

1240
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:25,200
And they sort of prime those so they're 
at hand.

1241
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:28,290
And I think that's what you basically 
experienced when you get hungry.

1242
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:29,723
You know,
and hunger isn't just the feeling in 

1243
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:32,970
your stomach,
the empty feeling.

1244
01:03:32,971 --> 01:03:35,700
It's also this impulse to act right in 
a,

1245
01:03:35,810 --> 01:03:40,170
in a particular direction.
And it's a heightened particular taste.

1246
01:03:40,510 --> 01:03:41,343
Um,
and maybe even for a particular 

1247
01:03:42,331 --> 01:03:44,910
substance.
So it turns out this is quite cool.

1248
01:03:46,170 --> 01:03:47,003
You know,
there's five or six or seven primary 

1249
01:03:49,021 --> 01:03:54,021
tastes and part of your brain tells you 
what it is that you're tasting.

1250
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:59,190
And then another part of your brain says
whether or not that is a good taste or a

1251
01:03:59,191 --> 01:04:01,500
bad taste.
And if it's a good taste,

1252
01:04:01,501 --> 01:04:02,334
then you'll pursue it.
And if it's a bad taste or even a 

1253
01:04:04,831 --> 01:04:06,510
neutral taste,
you won't pursue it.

1254
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:09,120
And so what happens is that as you get 
hungry,

1255
01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:14,570
the goodness of the taste increases.
And then when you eat it decreases.

1256
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,500
It tastes the same though.
Right.

1257
01:04:16,501 --> 01:04:18,510
Which is kind of interesting cause you 
might think that,

1258
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:20,250
you know,
if you were eating something salty,

1259
01:04:20,251 --> 01:04:22,920
the way he would stop is it just 
wouldn't taste salty anymore.

1260
01:04:23,130 --> 01:04:23,963
But that isn't,
what happens is you have a goodness 

1261
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:30,480
adjuster and it works independently for 
the different tastes.

1262
01:04:30,481 --> 01:04:31,314
So that's why when you eat,
you still have room for dessert because 

1263
01:04:34,501 --> 01:04:37,230
that part is unsatiated that taste isn't
satiated yet.

1264
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:38,550
So,
okay.

1265
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,980
Anyways,
the Hypothalamus,

1266
01:04:40,981 --> 01:04:41,814
let's say pops up this little sub 
personality and it's the eating 

1267
01:04:44,821 --> 01:04:45,750
subpersonality.

1268
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:48,610
And if it's like a really desperate 
eating subpersonality,

1269
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:50,820
you better not get in its way.
You know,

1270
01:04:50,821 --> 01:04:51,654
you're,
you never experienced that to speak of 

1271
01:04:52,711 --> 01:04:54,600
because you know,
North Americans are never hungry.

1272
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:57,990
Hungry is what happens after you haven't
eaten for 30 days,

1273
01:04:57,991 --> 01:04:58,920
you know,
that's hungry.

1274
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,270
So,
and you will,

1275
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:02,160
you don't want to get in the way of 
someone like that.

1276
01:05:02,161 --> 01:05:05,490
They're going to be occupying the 
hunger,

1277
01:05:06,450 --> 01:05:07,283
motivation,
action and perception module all the 

1278
01:05:09,031 --> 01:05:11,280
time and in a very,
very motivated way.

1279
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:16,670
And the hypothalamus is no hiker.
It's got massive projections reaching up

1280
01:05:17,411 --> 01:05:18,244
into the parts of the brain that you 
would associate more particularly with 

1281
01:05:21,401 --> 01:05:22,234
you.
And if it wants to subordinate you to 

1282
01:05:25,451 --> 01:05:26,770
it,
it will.

1283
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:29,140
And you'll see this all the time.
And Binge eaters,

1284
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:30,453
you know,
because a binge eater will starve 

1285
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:34,900
usually herself and starve herself and 
starve herself and starve herself.

1286
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:35,883
And then the hypothalamus will say,
especially if she gets a little upset 

1287
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:40,083
because the,
the negative emotion will suppress her 

1288
01:05:41,981 --> 01:05:45,450
preferred in frontal cortical function.
And then the hypothalamus ago,

1289
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,770
and then the little eating bark module 
pops up and you know,

1290
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:54,130
she's in the fridge eating two ports of 
ice cream in 15 seconds.

1291
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,290
And then she says,
it was like,

1292
01:05:56,291 --> 01:05:57,880
it wasn't even me.
It's like,

1293
01:05:57,910 --> 01:05:58,780
yeah,
it wasn't,

1294
01:05:58,810 --> 01:05:59,643
it was,
it was a fundamental biological 

1295
01:06:01,631 --> 01:06:05,260
subcircuit that is devoted to not 
letting you starve yourself to death,

1296
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:06,753
you know?
And so you don't want to get into war 

1297
01:06:07,331 --> 01:06:08,164
with one of those things.
And that's really what happens in 

1298
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:11,313
bulemia in particular.
It's a war between higher cortical 

1299
01:06:13,751 --> 01:06:17,890
centers and lower subcortical centers.
And that's not good,

1300
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:18,933
you know,
so.

1301
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:22,110
So anyways,
off pops the Little Lod,

1302
01:06:22,111 --> 01:06:24,610
you all,
it says state a,

1303
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:26,740
you're,
you don't have enough food.

1304
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:27,603
Your blood sugar's too low.
State be solved that by having a peanut 

1305
01:06:31,301 --> 01:06:32,470
butter sandwich,
you know,

1306
01:06:32,471 --> 01:06:34,450
it's context,
it's context specific.

1307
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:36,730
Solve it by eating.
Okay?

1308
01:06:37,210 --> 01:06:41,050
Now what that has done is set up the 
framework for satiation.

1309
01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:42,431
Okay?
Now,

1310
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:43,264
satiation is a kind of reward.
Now you might think that satiation is 

1311
01:06:47,891 --> 01:06:48,724
the kind of reward that everyone wants 
because that's actually what people 

1312
01:06:51,251 --> 01:06:52,360
think,
you know,

1313
01:06:52,361 --> 01:06:55,480
they think that what you want is to give
to your goal.

1314
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:59,530
And generally we presume that getting to
your goal is rewarding.

1315
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:02,410
But it's a funny kind of reward because 
actually,

1316
01:07:02,411 --> 01:07:05,680
because it's a consumer Tory reward,
which is a particular kind of reward,

1317
01:07:05,681 --> 01:07:06,514
it has its own circuitry.
The consumer Tory reward just shuts off 

1318
01:07:09,551 --> 01:07:13,360
the system that was pursuing it.
That's the consequence.

1319
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:16,900
So the drive goes away.
It's a funny reward,

1320
01:07:16,901 --> 01:07:17,734
right?
Because you stopped being impelled by 

1321
01:07:19,091 --> 01:07:22,450
the drive.
You're kind of happy about that.

1322
01:07:22,451 --> 01:07:24,880
But all that happens is that system 
sinks and Poof,

1323
01:07:24,881 --> 01:07:28,600
up pops another one.
So Conservatory reward does this strange

1324
01:07:28,601 --> 01:07:29,434
kind of reward because it's never really
final and all it does is shut down the 

1325
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:34,330
part of you that wanted it.
So,

1326
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:37,430
okay,
so that's consumer Tory reward.

1327
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:40,390
And that's important to remember.
You'll see why after awhile.

1328
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:46,200
Now imagine what could happen as you 
move towards the consumer Tory reward.

1329
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:48,903
So here's,
here's some rough things that could 

1330
01:07:49,901 --> 01:07:50,734
happen.

1331
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:55,340
The things that you're doing could work 
in the way you want them to work.

1332
01:07:56,570 --> 01:07:57,403
Okay?
And so that's kind of the no hassle 

1333
01:07:58,401 --> 01:07:59,840
situation.
You know,

1334
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:02,090
you go downstairs,
you opened the cupboard,

1335
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:04,460
the peanut butters there,
you make a sandwich,

1336
01:08:04,461 --> 01:08:06,080
you eat it,
and then you go back to study.

1337
01:08:06,350 --> 01:08:07,183
Pretty

1338
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:09,600
no,
I'm excited.

1339
01:08:09,870 --> 01:08:12,750
You know,
it's like it's a boring story and that's

1340
01:08:12,751 --> 01:08:14,280
the kind of story you want and inhabit.
Habit.

1341
01:08:14,281 --> 01:08:15,114
Most of the time you want the things 
that you know how to do to produce the 

1342
01:08:18,441 --> 01:08:20,630
results that you want to produce to 
work.

1343
01:08:21,350 --> 01:08:25,070
And that basically keeps your emotions 
regulated.

1344
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:27,163
So now that we understand this a to be 
movement and we understand how the 

1345
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:35,930
underlying biological subsystems 
modulate that,

1346
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:39,500
now we can start to think about emotion.
All right?

1347
01:08:39,501 --> 01:08:44,150
So
as you're walking towards your goal,

1348
01:08:45,110 --> 01:08:45,943
you're evaluating what happens as you 
walk and as long as the things that you 

1349
01:08:50,391 --> 01:08:52,730
want to have happen are happening while 
you walk,

1350
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:57,170
then you're dopaminergic system,
which is the source of incentive reward,

1351
01:08:57,350 --> 01:09:01,250
which is the second kind of reward.
You're dopamine system is going,

1352
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:02,390
good job,
good job,

1353
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:03,560
good job,
good job,

1354
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,330
good job.
And you kind of liked that.

1355
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:06,163
It keeps you alert,
you know when you're on the right track 

1356
01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:08,863
and it reinforces that behavior because 
your body assumes that if the thing is 

1357
01:09:12,650 --> 01:09:13,483
that you're doing is working,
then the circuit that does that should 

1358
01:09:16,101 --> 01:09:16,934
get a little stronger and a little more 
well developed because it's producing 

1359
01:09:19,671 --> 01:09:22,820
the desired outcome.
And I think you feel good about that.

1360
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:24,133
And I think the reason you feel good 
about that is because your brain is 

1361
01:09:26,391 --> 01:09:28,850
actually like,
it's in a state of growth.

1362
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:32,570
It's producing chemicals that help your 
brain grow.

1363
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:37,310
And I think it's the feeling of that,
that you have as a positive feeling.

1364
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:42,340
Now how you feel that I don't know.
But why wouldn't you feel that?

1365
01:09:42,591 --> 01:09:45,230
It's like the thing you're doing is 
working,

1366
01:09:45,231 --> 01:09:48,290
it should thrive.
And so you're pretty happy about that.

1367
01:09:48,291 --> 01:09:50,930
And that's like mild level positive 
emotions.

1368
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:53,060
I know what I'm doing,
you know?

1369
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:58,060
So that's one thing that can happen.
Things that you expect or predict.

1370
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:01,980
It's expect if you use a pure cognitive 
warrant,

1371
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:03,973
it's desire.
If you use a model that incorporates 

1372
01:10:06,981 --> 01:10:07,814
motivation,
cause socolow lovin vinegar Dova and to 

1373
01:10:10,251 --> 01:10:14,180
some degree gray kind of thinks about 
the brain as something that predicts and

1374
01:10:14,181 --> 01:10:15,980
expects,
you know?

1375
01:10:15,981 --> 01:10:19,160
So as long as what you expect to happen 
is happening,

1376
01:10:19,161 --> 01:10:21,200
then you stay calm.
But there's a,

1377
01:10:21,201 --> 01:10:24,530
there's an error in that in the error is
well you don't just expect things,

1378
01:10:24,531 --> 01:10:26,060
you want them,
right.

1379
01:10:26,061 --> 01:10:29,450
And you're always aiming at something 
specific.

1380
01:10:29,451 --> 01:10:30,284
And it's the biological systems that 
underlying motivation that they're 

1381
01:10:32,751 --> 01:10:35,660
specifying that.
So you can't think of yourself as a cold

1382
01:10:35,661 --> 01:10:39,140
calculating expectancy machine,
cognitive expectancy machine.

1383
01:10:39,350 --> 01:10:41,390
Cause you're not like that.
You want things,

1384
01:10:42,170 --> 01:10:43,003
okay,
so you're moving along towards you 

1385
01:10:44,001 --> 01:10:44,834
target and the things that you want to 
have happen are happening and the cues 

1386
01:10:49,071 --> 01:10:52,550
that you're approaching the target are 
appearing as they should be.

1387
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:55,280
And your dopamine system,
which is grounded by the way,

1388
01:10:55,281 --> 01:10:56,114
in half of the hypothalamus,
so half of the hypothalamus is devoted 

1389
01:10:59,511 --> 01:11:00,344
towards popping up these little bubbles 
that tell you what you should want and 

1390
01:11:03,411 --> 01:11:04,244
how to get them.
And the other half is devoted to 

1391
01:11:05,331 --> 01:11:09,680
exploring and to mostly to exploring 
into paying attention.

1392
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:10,543
Okay?
So,

1393
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:11,683
and it will be ticking along just quite 
nicely as long as what you're doing is 

1394
01:11:14,131 --> 01:11:15,870
working.
But then we'll say,

1395
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:17,820
well,
what if what you're doing isn't working?

1396
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:19,553
What if,
uh,

1397
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:20,753
what if you get to the cupboard and you 
open it and your little brother has 

1398
01:11:23,641 --> 01:11:26,040
eaten all the peanut butter?
Well,

1399
01:11:26,041 --> 01:11:26,791
what you get,
Dan,

1400
01:11:26,791 --> 01:11:29,790
is a mismatch.
It's like instead of the presence of the

1401
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:30,624
peanut butter,
you get the absence of the peanut 

1402
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:33,870
butter.
And that's actually a stimulus.

1403
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:37,400
So cool.
The absence of a desired entity is,

1404
01:11:37,410 --> 01:11:38,550
it is a punishment.

1405
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:42,060
It's a punishment.
So that's pretty abstract,

1406
01:11:42,061 --> 01:11:43,800
right?
I mean it's pretty abstract punishment.

1407
01:11:43,801 --> 01:11:46,740
It's like a hole where there shouldn't 
be a whole,

1408
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:47,933
will produce an orienting response and 
frustrate you and make you aggressive 

1409
01:11:51,031 --> 01:11:52,770
and irritated and all those sorts of 
things.

1410
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:55,590
And so,
and you're going to feel that negatively

1411
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:58,320
now.
That's interesting.

1412
01:11:58,321 --> 01:12:00,570
That's a punishment.
That's a punishment.

1413
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:02,273
Now,
if you had suspicions that the peanut 

1414
01:12:03,901 --> 01:12:06,180
butter might be missing when you were 
opening the door,

1415
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:09,390
that would make you anxious.
Cause anxiety,

1416
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:10,313
fear more particularly fear is the 
expectation that a punishment might 

1417
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:17,303
occur.
And you have a separate interesting 

1418
01:12:19,341 --> 01:12:20,130
though,
even though it's,

1419
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:25,130
it's in relationship to a punishment 
which you might think of as a primary,

1420
01:12:25,990 --> 01:12:29,280
um,
unconditioned stimulus,

1421
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:31,570
right?
It's an unconditioned stimulus cause he,

1422
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:34,140
you naturally,
you're naturally respond to it.

1423
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:37,020
Fear which could be considered a 
condition.

1424
01:12:37,021 --> 01:12:37,854
Stimulus actually has its own circuit.
It's so common that what we want might 

1425
01:12:43,081 --> 01:12:43,914
not be there.
That we've evolved the whole circuit 

1426
01:12:45,691 --> 01:12:46,524
just to deal with things that are 
threatening as well as things that are 

1427
01:12:49,201 --> 01:12:50,790
punishing.
Punishment,

1428
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:51,713
pain,

1429
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:55,230
threat,
anxiety.

1430
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:58,800
Threat is threat of punishment.
So it's an abstract form of,

1431
01:12:58,801 --> 01:13:00,720
but it's an abstract representation of 
punishment.

1432
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:03,120
You're anxious so that you don't get 
hurt.

1433
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,310
Now you might say,
I'm so damn anxious,

1434
01:13:05,311 --> 01:13:06,660
I don't,
I'd rather have to hurt.

1435
01:13:06,661 --> 01:13:10,560
But no you wouldn't.
It's like it's a lesser price to pay.

1436
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:12,473
It's a law.
It's a lesser pain to avoid a greater 

1437
01:13:14,071 --> 01:13:15,660
pain.
That's really what anxiety is.

1438
01:13:15,661 --> 01:13:18,240
So the next time you're anxious,
you should be happy about that because

1439
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:21,113
at least you're not pain,
which is what the anxiety trying to 

1440
01:13:22,981 --> 01:13:23,814
protect you from it.

1441
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:27,583
Okay,
so you're going towards your goal and 

1442
01:13:29,451 --> 01:13:30,284
one thing that could happen is that 
things that you want to have happen are 

1443
01:13:32,391 --> 01:13:35,390
happening and things that you want to 
have appear are appearing.

1444
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:39,020
And so you get a little dopamine kick 
from the hypothalamus and that makes you

1445
01:13:39,021 --> 01:13:41,090
feel like you're,
you know,

1446
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:44,300
on the right track,
which is exactly how it makes you feel.

1447
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:45,943
Because we're trajectory oriented 
animals and just like an anti missile 

1448
01:13:50,661 --> 01:13:51,494
missile,
we're always trying to hit a moving 

1449
01:13:52,371 --> 01:13:53,204
target.
And so if you're on the right 

1450
01:13:54,261 --> 01:13:56,360
trajectory,
then everything,

1451
01:13:56,420 --> 01:14:01,040
everything about the way you organized 
your brain at that moment is functional.

1452
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:06,190
And so your brain pumps up a little bit 
of neuro chemical to make those areas of

1453
01:14:06,291 --> 01:14:07,124
the brain that are involved in that 
productive activity grow a little bit 

1454
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:10,910
and you think,
Hey,

1455
01:14:11,170 --> 01:14:13,930
are going pretty good for me.
So that's pretty cool.

1456
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:16,990
Now here's another thing that could 
happen.

1457
01:14:16,991 --> 01:14:17,711
So we could say,
well,

1458
01:14:17,711 --> 01:14:18,544
the peanut butter isn't there.
Well first you're going to be surprised 

1459
01:14:22,721 --> 01:14:24,400
about that.
Hypothetically,

1460
01:14:24,401 --> 01:14:26,530
if to the degree that you thought it 
would be there.

1461
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:27,573
And so that's gonna make you anxious 
because one of the things that can 

1462
01:14:30,701 --> 01:14:35,701
happen when you're on the way to get 
something you want is that something you

1463
01:14:35,741 --> 01:14:38,620
don't expect will happen.
That's novelty,

1464
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:40,053
that's novelty or a normally and 
normally is the mismatch between the 

1465
01:14:45,221 --> 01:14:46,054
structures that you're using to 
represent the world and your actions in 

1466
01:14:48,581 --> 01:14:49,414
it and the actual world.
It's the detection of a gap between the 

1467
01:14:53,351 --> 01:14:56,950
state of reality and your representation
of the state of reality.

1468
01:14:57,430 --> 01:14:58,540
Now,
the bigger that gap,

1469
01:14:58,541 --> 01:15:01,360
the more anxious you get.
Now then you might say,

1470
01:15:01,361 --> 01:15:02,194
well,
how do you calculate how anxious you 

1471
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:06,250
should be?
And Gray.

1472
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:08,620
Actually it doesn't talk about that,
but if you,

1473
01:15:08,710 --> 01:15:09,543
but there's a paper in there by carver 
and Scheier that you'll have to read 

1474
01:15:12,551 --> 01:15:13,480
that's related to this.

1475
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:16,450
So remember the hierarchy,
right?

1476
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:17,643
You got little bitty things at the 
bottom and you've got great big things 

1477
01:15:19,541 --> 01:15:21,820
at the top.
And so you might say

1478
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:24,213
you open the cupboard and the peanut 
butter isn't there and you think this 

1479
01:15:26,861 --> 01:15:29,830
stupid family,
I should go hang myself.

1480
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:31,053
You know,
which I I would say is not a 

1481
01:15:32,351 --> 01:15:35,200
particularly adaptive response,
although it does solve the problem.

1482
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:36,243
What's happening there is that you're 
calibrating the threat as a threat to 

1483
01:15:39,281 --> 01:15:40,114
the integrity of the top levels of the 
hierarchy that you use to orient 

1484
01:15:42,881 --> 01:15:46,150
yourself in the world.
And I would say that's pretty,

1485
01:15:46,420 --> 01:15:48,310
that's fuzzy thinking.
You know,

1486
01:15:48,311 --> 01:15:49,144
before you hang yourself about it,
you might think if there's some simpler 

1487
01:15:51,851 --> 01:15:55,660
things you could do that were lower in 
the hierarchy and higher resolution that

1488
01:15:55,661 --> 01:15:57,160
would solve the problem.
Like,

1489
01:15:57,550 --> 01:15:58,383
well you could go to the corner store 
and get a jar of peanut butter and then 

1490
01:16:00,371 --> 01:16:01,570
that problem would be solved.

1491
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:02,403
Right?
Or maybe you could just have something 

1492
01:16:03,971 --> 01:16:05,770
that wasn't peanut butter.
And you know what I mean?

1493
01:16:05,771 --> 01:16:08,680
You want,
you want to do a shift at the low levels

1494
01:16:08,681 --> 01:16:12,670
of the hierarchy at high resolution 
because it's less anxiety provoking.

1495
01:16:12,790 --> 01:16:16,210
It's less effort and it doesn't take you
apart.

1496
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:20,470
And so there's a rule and I don't know 
how your brain figures it out.

1497
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:25,630
The rule is make the least modification 
necessary to solve the emergent problem.

1498
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:27,760
It's a really,
really,

1499
01:16:27,761 --> 01:16:29,560
really,
really important rule.

1500
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:31,930
And if you use it when you're talking to
other people,

1501
01:16:31,931 --> 01:16:34,930
they will like you a lot better because 
maybe you know,

1502
01:16:35,020 --> 01:16:38,740
the person that's working for you 
doesn't do something that they said they

1503
01:16:38,741 --> 01:16:40,870
would do.
And that puts you in trouble.

1504
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:42,760
I mean,
one responses,

1505
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:44,500
you know,
you're a useless creek,

1506
01:16:44,530 --> 01:16:46,900
get the hell out of here so you're,
you fire them.

1507
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:48,940
And the other is,
okay,

1508
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:54,250
tell me exactly what happened during the
time that you were supposed to be,

1509
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:56,320
you know,
outputting this,

1510
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:58,353
this resource.
So he listened to the person detail out 

1511
01:17:00,521 --> 01:17:01,354
there,
psychomotor schemes and you see where 

1512
01:17:03,731 --> 01:17:08,320
you can tweak one or two so that the 
next time that happens,

1513
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:11,270
the next time a situation like that 
arises,

1514
01:17:11,390 --> 01:17:15,800
you don't get the same undesired output 
as much better.

1515
01:17:15,801 --> 01:17:17,180
But it takes acuity,
right?

1516
01:17:17,181 --> 01:17:20,120
Cause you gotta turn it low resolution 
situation,

1517
01:17:20,121 --> 01:17:25,121
which is I'm irritated and anxious and 
frustrated and hurt by your foolishness.

1518
01:17:25,611 --> 01:17:26,444
You're a parent foolishness,
which is really easy thing to 

1519
01:17:28,701 --> 01:17:30,770
conceptualize because it doesn't take 
any effort.

1520
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:34,340
It's just an expression of my automatic 
response.

1521
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,350
Or I can think,
okay,

1522
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:40,640
let's let's constrain this 
differentiated,

1523
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:45,410
sequence it and try to figure out where 
the problem actually lies.

1524
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:46,393
Now if it happens 50 times,
well maybe it's time not to have a 

1525
01:17:48,591 --> 01:17:50,060
relationship with that person anymore.

1526
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:51,223
But to begin with,
at least you want to start with the 

1527
01:17:53,330 --> 01:17:54,163
smallest possible correction.
And you can really remember this when 

1528
01:17:56,811 --> 01:17:58,130
you're arguing with people,
you know,

1529
01:17:58,131 --> 01:18:00,200
especially with people that you have a 
relationship with.

1530
01:18:00,230 --> 01:18:01,063
It's like save the,
we should get a divorce statements for 

1531
01:18:03,801 --> 01:18:07,280
the serious occasions and if there's 
violations,

1532
01:18:07,281 --> 01:18:09,680
like assume that they're high 
resolution,

1533
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:12,950
low level violations,
investigate that.

1534
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:16,820
And if that doesn't work well then jump 
up one level but start low.

1535
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,840
And most of the time your brain is 
trying to figure out how to do that.

1536
01:18:20,841 --> 01:18:21,674
For you,
it would like to assume that your 

1537
01:18:23,001 --> 01:18:23,834
stupidity is of the rectifiable kind.
And I want to talk to you a little bit 

1538
01:18:28,251 --> 01:18:29,084
about how it makes that calculation 
because it's a very hard calculation to 

1539
01:18:31,551 --> 01:18:32,151
make,
right?

1540
01:18:32,151 --> 01:18:35,230
It's like if you wake up and you know 
you,

1541
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,280
there's something about you that's 
aching.

1542
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,130
It's like what the hell are you supposed
to think about that?

1543
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:45,290
Because the ranges from nothing,
it'll go away in five minutes to hey,

1544
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,153
you know you're dead in three months and
there's no real way of telling what 

1545
01:18:50,061 --> 01:18:50,894
level of catastrophic response you 
should have to the emergence of that 

1546
01:18:53,721 --> 01:18:55,940
anomaly.
It's a real big problem.

1547
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:59,390
And so your brain has to estimate it and
all sorts of different ways.

1548
01:18:59,391 --> 01:19:04,391
And as we differentiate it,
differentiate out the personality traits

1549
01:19:04,910 --> 01:19:08,180
will start to talk about that.
So for now,

1550
01:19:08,181 --> 01:19:09,014
just remember that your your built in 
biological systems are specifying the 

1551
01:19:13,851 --> 01:19:16,640
goal and the framework within which you 
construe that goal.

1552
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:19,700
Perceptions and actions as little 
personality.

1553
01:19:19,701 --> 01:19:21,530
And it wants some,
okay.

1554
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:25,160
As that little personality is going on 
long towards its goal,

1555
01:19:25,820 --> 01:19:28,340
three things can happen.
It can make progress,

1556
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:32,060
it can get stopped in a way that's 
easily rectifiable.

1557
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:32,953
You know,
like maybe there's a toy on the stairs 

1558
01:19:34,071 --> 01:19:36,620
and you have to step around it.
Obviously that's not going to bother you

1559
01:19:36,621 --> 01:19:40,190
very much because it just requires a 
tiny transformation of your,

1560
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:42,290
of your Schema,
right?

1561
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:45,800
So little things you can rectify might 
help.

1562
01:19:45,801 --> 01:19:46,634
So those are little punishments or 
middle threats or you can hit an 

1563
01:19:48,621 --> 01:19:50,480
anomaly.
Okay.

1564
01:19:50,510 --> 01:19:54,020
And if things are going right,
that's positive emotion.

1565
01:19:55,010 --> 01:19:56,660
That's extroversion.
By the way.

1566
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:59,330
It's the same system.
So extroverts,

1567
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,360
they're positive,
they're positive reward system.

1568
01:20:02,361 --> 01:20:03,194
The incentive reward system is quite 
active and extroverts not active and 

1569
01:20:06,411 --> 01:20:09,210
interests.
And then in terms of neuroticism,

1570
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:10,913
people that are high in neuroticism tend
to react with more anxiety and pain to 

1571
01:20:17,311 --> 01:20:18,144
the same amount of disruption.
And those are two of the first 

1572
01:20:21,751 --> 01:20:26,751
fundamental personality traits.
So we'll see you Tuesday.
