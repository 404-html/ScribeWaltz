1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,280
Okay.
So now we're going to talk about the

2
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:15,690
phenomenological existential slash
phenomenological psych guy trusts and

3
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:19,950
their theories from the 1950s.
And as I mentioned to you before,

4
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,780
a lot of their thinking was motivated by
what had happened did in World War II.

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,700
When I,
when I lecture to you last,

6
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:27,990
I,
I pointed out,

7
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:34,020
I described Nietzschean Dostoyevsky's
summation of the world situation and

8
00:00:34,021 --> 00:00:36,900
really the world psychological situation
at the end of the 18 hundreds.

9
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:41,520
And that was that
our new modes of thinking had undermined

10
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:44,790
our faith and our old modes of thinking.
And that was a problem because people

11
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:47,820
need something firm to stand on,
to orient themselves and to move

12
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:51,120
forward.
And so Nietzschean Dostoyevsky basically

13
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:54,480
both prophesied that the consequence of
that dissolution would be,

14
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,480
um,
increased probability of nihilism and

15
00:00:57,481 --> 00:01:00,810
everything that went along with that.
And Dusty Yefsky wrote about that

16
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:04,020
actually quite extensively in a book
called notes from underground,

17
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:07,230
which if any of you are interested,
especially in clinical psychology,

18
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,530
that's a book you should really read
because it's one of the most brilliant

19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,550
psychological studies of,
uh,

20
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,260
of a,
of a psychologically disturbed man

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,580
that's ever been written.

22
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,740
It's very accurate.
And there are sections in crime and

23
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:22,920
punishment that are like that too.
I think there are unsurpassed in their

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,740
representation of,
of psych,

25
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,920
of psychological phenomenon.
That was,

26
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,900
I don't,
I don't know how he managed it.

27
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:34,170
I mean Dostoyevsky was epileptic,
I don't know if you know that,

28
00:01:34,171 --> 00:01:35,490
but he,
um,

29
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,500
he was arrested by the czar's men in the
late 18 hundreds for being a student

30
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:45,501
radical and they threw him in the main
prison in Moscow.

31
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,460
And then one day they took him out in
front of a firing squad and shot him at

32
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:52,590
six in the morning,
but they only use blanks,

33
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:56,250
which of course he didn't know about.
And that scared him so badly.

34
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:58,170
He developed epilepsy and then he had
epilepsy.

35
00:01:58,171 --> 00:01:59,910
That can happen by the way,
um,

36
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,880
at Andy had epilepsy for the rest of his
life,

37
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:04,500
but he had this strange kind of
epilepsy,

38
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:06,600
which is actually not all that rare.

39
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,730
Um,
sometimes when people have epilepsy,

40
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:11,460
they experienced this phenomena.
They call an aura,

41
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:14,010
which is an altered state of
consciousness before the epileptic

42
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:15,990
seizure hits.
And they can be very strange these

43
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:18,630
auras.
So I read a case study once about a guy

44
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:19,640
who,
um,

45
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,720
his aura was that his hand was being
possessed by devils from hell and he

46
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:27,990
could feel the possession move up his
arm and into his shoulder.

47
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:30,150
And once it hit his head,
he'd have an epileptic seizure.

48
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,790
And so then there was another case,
um,

49
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,760
where,
where this man,

50
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,360
his aura was that his exact double had
appeared behind him.

51
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,880
But if you turn and if you turned to
look,

52
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:44,520
then you'd have an epileptic seizure.
But if he didn't turn to look,

53
00:02:44,521 --> 00:02:46,590
then he wouldn't.
So these,

54
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:49,080
you know,
brain disorders are very strange things

55
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:50,580
because they're,
well,

56
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,810
the system that is disordered is alive
and it's capable of any number of

57
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,970
extraordinarily peculiar misbehaviors.

58
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,660
Anyways,
Dostoyevsky's aura was a world revealing

59
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,150
aura.
And so what Dostoyevsky would experience

60
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:08,080
was that the meaning of things got
deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper

61
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:10,720
and deeper.
And then just as he was on the verge of

62
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:14,080
discovering the secret to everything,
he'd have an epileptic seizure.

63
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,150
But he said that the quality of
experience during the aura was so high,

64
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,900
so overpowering,
and so deep that he would've traded all

65
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:25,960
of his normal experience just to have
had those experiences.

66
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:30,220
And he had them repeatedly.
And I really do believe that it was this

67
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:34,060
broadening of his,
of his vision and concept by his

68
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:36,520
epilepsy that transformed them.
Among other things.

69
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:38,110
I mean,
he went through some pretty damn rough

70
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:42,070
experiences because he was in prison
with rapists and murderers for a long

71
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:44,470
time in Siberia,
even though he was kind of an

72
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:45,730
aristocratic guy.
I mean,

73
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:47,710
he had a,
he had a rough time of it.

74
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:52,840
And I imagine that that also broadened
him tremendously given that it didn't

75
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:54,270
kill him.
But,

76
00:03:54,271 --> 00:03:56,860
um,
I really do believe that the epileptic

77
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:01,210
insight was key to his,
like his unsurpassed genius.

78
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,110
And so,
and the his aura and other people do

79
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:08,110
experience epileptic aura symptoms like
that by the way.

80
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:11,530
And some people are so enamored of the
aura that they won't take their

81
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:14,410
antiepileptic epilepsy medication
because they don't want to forego the

82
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,770
experience that precedes the aura or the
actual,

83
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:23,020
our actual epileptic seizure.
So Dostoyevsky's experiences,

84
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:27,970
the op element of the aura is also
relevant to what we're going to talk

85
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:31,540
about today because both been swagger
and boss,

86
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:35,170
we're very interested in how meaning
revealed itself in the world.

87
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,080
And they had an,
they had opposing explanations.

88
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,320
I actually think they're parallel
explanations.

89
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,280
But um,
the meaning that Dostoyevsky experienced

90
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:48,340
is,
is an amplification of the normal manner

91
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:50,590
in which meaning reveals itself in the
world.

92
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,880
So I mean,
and people experience that sort of thing

93
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:57,370
in,
in various altered states of

94
00:04:57,371 --> 00:05:02,140
consciousness.
It's been swearing or in boss.

95
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:04,750
So they work mostly in the 1950s.
And as I said,

96
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:07,290
they were very concerned about what had
happened in world war two.

97
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:11,030
And so Dostoyevsky and Nichi had
basically predicted that it was going to

98
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,230
be nihilism or ideological
totalitarianism.

99
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:16,330
And that's basically exactly what
happened.

100
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:20,260
And by,
by the time the 1930s appeared on the

101
00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:21,730
horizon,
the Germans who had been,

102
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,623
you know,

103
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:29,210
they'd gone through an absolutely brutal
first world war and then they went

104
00:05:29,211 --> 00:05:32,390
through hyperinflation of insane
proportion.

105
00:05:32,391 --> 00:05:37,340
So in the 1920s Germany underwent this
partly because they had such heavy war

106
00:05:37,341 --> 00:05:41,900
debts to pay for World War One.
The German German inflation got to the

107
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:46,901
point where it was literally upwards of
100 million marks to buy a loaf of

108
00:05:48,021 --> 00:05:49,070
bread,
you know,

109
00:05:49,071 --> 00:05:52,970
so they were taking wheelbarrows full of
money to the grocery stores.

110
00:05:52,971 --> 00:05:54,530
You know,
what happened was their currency

111
00:05:54,531 --> 00:05:56,740
devalued to zero.
And you know,

112
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,840
that actually happens to economies more
often than you might think.

113
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:02,120
So the thing just hit zero and that's
that.

114
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:04,550
And then it has to be rebooted,
so to speak.

115
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:09,170
So they had been,
the war was dreadful in hundreds of

116
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,670
thousands of men were killed or
brutalized.

117
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:14,000
Then their economy just absolutely fell
apart.

118
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,040
And then of course,
at the same time,

119
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:20,030
well a little bit earlier,
the revolution had taken place in

120
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:20,510
Russia.

121
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,260
Right.
You know,

122
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,090
right.
At the end of the first world war and

123
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:26,300
the communists had come to power and the
communists were agitating all over

124
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:28,460
Europe and in North America.
And you know,

125
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:32,720
their goal was to,
to produce a communist revolution that

126
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:36,350
was worldwide.
And so the Germans were all shorted out

127
00:06:36,351 --> 00:06:38,390
that the communists were going to take
over the country,

128
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:41,900
which was a perfectly reasonable fear.
And you know,

129
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,170
instead of that,
what happened was that fascism or ropes

130
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:48,860
and fascism was a form of,
of state and totalitarianism.

131
00:06:48,861 --> 00:06:52,400
And I think the Germans were so
desperate for order by that point,

132
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:54,620
that,
and that's what the fascists basically

133
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:56,090
offered them,
at least in theory.

134
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,090
Um,
unfortunately as it turned out,

135
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:03,080
they offered them a little bit too much
order or maybe a lot too much order and

136
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:05,620
things went dreadfully south.
But you know,

137
00:07:05,621 --> 00:07:09,980
so then the whole world had to walk
through the horrors of World War Two.

138
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,650
And,
and it was shocking in a variety of

139
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:14,570
ways,
not only because of the brutality of the

140
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:16,820
warfare,
but because of the genocidal actions

141
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:19,310
that took place consciously by the
Nazis.

142
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:22,550
And you know,
and those actions were in many ways very

143
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:24,590
difficult to understand,
um,

144
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,010
mean here's why they're particularly
difficult to understand.

145
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,160
There were certainly times where the
brutality that the Nazis employed in

146
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:39,881
their eradication of their theoretical
enemies far surpassed the necessity for

147
00:07:41,181 --> 00:07:43,550
the mere eradication.
But even worse than that,

148
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:47,750
so it went past eradication into real
torture constantly.

149
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:51,320
And not only that,
there are many situations in which the

150
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:53,030
Nazis,
especially near the end of the war,

151
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:56,420
they had to decide really whether they
were going to continue exterminating

152
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:00,830
Jews and Gypsies and homosexuals and all
the people they felt didn't fit into

153
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:03,320
their culture or whether they were going
to win the war.

154
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,010
And there were decisions they had to
make about the distribution of resources

155
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:10,370
where if they were going to pursue the
genocidal extermination,

156
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,160
that would mean it would decrease the
probability that they would win.

157
00:08:13,161 --> 00:08:15,620
The war not happened a lot,
especially at the end.

158
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:18,800
And the Nazis always picked continuing
the extermination.

159
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,290
Now that's pretty damn interesting,
you know,

160
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:23,630
because you can think,
well on the one hand,

161
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:24,980
you know,
if,

162
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,540
if they are serving a creed and the
creed is world domination and this is

163
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,840
the extermination processes are
considered a step towards the actual end

164
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,240
point,
which is the establishment of a world

165
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:41,990
state of fascist world state,
or at least a fascist European state,

166
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:45,920
then you would think that the
extermination attempts would be

167
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:49,610
subordinate to that goal if they were
actually pursuing the goal that they

168
00:08:49,611 --> 00:08:52,100
said they were pursuing.
But you know,

169
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,130
there's an old psychoanalytic idea,
which is really worthwhile.

170
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,020
It's like a surgical tool.
And I would say if you're gonna use it

171
00:08:58,021 --> 00:09:01,020
in your own life,
use it carefully because you don't want

172
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:03,780
to do unnecessary surgery.
And the rule is,

173
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,140
and I think this is union rule,
but I can't remember exactly where I

174
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:10,860
read it.
If you can't understand why someone is

175
00:09:10,861 --> 00:09:14,670
doing something,
look at the consequences of their

176
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:17,220
actions,
whatever those might be,

177
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,370
and then infer the motivation from the
consequences.

178
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,660
So if you see someone who seems to be
doing nothing except making everyone

179
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:28,320
around them and themselves miserable and
you can't understand why,

180
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:32,250
one of the hypotheses that you might
entertain is that they're trying to make

181
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:35,040
everyone around them miserable as well
as themselves.

182
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:39,300
And that's actually their goal.
And it's hard for people to understand

183
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:43,410
these sorts of things because when we
see phenomena like the columbine

184
00:09:43,411 --> 00:09:44,370
shooters,
you know,

185
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,630
we always assume that the reason that
these people are doing these sorts of

186
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:50,190
things is for other reasons.

187
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,450
Then the reasons they that the reasons
that appear to motivate them or even the

188
00:09:54,451 --> 00:09:57,400
reasons they say they're doing it
because the columbine killer,

189
00:09:57,401 --> 00:10:00,930
especially the more literate one,
he said exactly why he was doing what he

190
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:02,060
was doing.
It's not,

191
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:06,210
it's as clear as it could possibly be.
All you have to do is go online and read

192
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:08,640
what he said and he tells you what he
was up to.

193
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,880
But people don't like to think that way
because they don't believe that anybody

194
00:10:11,881 --> 00:10:16,620
could be consciously possessed of that
much malevolence without there being

195
00:10:16,621 --> 00:10:18,750
some other kind of cause.
Like,

196
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,300
you know,
he was bullied at school or you know,

197
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:24,840
he was an outcast and those things were
only vaguely true and they certainly

198
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:26,940
weren't more true of having them.
They were true of,

199
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,730
you know,
how many people in high school are,

200
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,340
you know,
bullied in somewhat outkast?

201
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,960
Jesus,
it must be 10%.

202
00:10:33,961 --> 00:10:37,290
It's probably more like 30 you know,
that doesn't mean that the schools are

203
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,030
blowing up all over,
you know,

204
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:41,940
all over all the time.
It's a completely insufficient

205
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:45,150
explanation anyways,
for whatever reason,

206
00:10:45,151 --> 00:10:48,900
you know,
people turn to possession by very,

207
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:51,630
very strict ideological ideas and you
know,

208
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:55,440
they were willing to be possessed by
those ideas to the point where they

209
00:10:55,441 --> 00:10:59,580
would undertake actions that you'd think
would be completely impossible for

210
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,700
theoretically civilized people.
You know,

211
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,830
it turned out that those sec actions,
not only,

212
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,590
we're not impossible for civilized
people,

213
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,590
but the people themselves,
you know,

214
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,290
especially in Nazi Germany,
they pretty much knew what the hell was

215
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,220
going on.
You know,

216
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,180
you don't take several million people
out of your population without rumors

217
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:19,530
spreading,
let's say.

218
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:20,581
And so,
you know,

219
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:22,710
we should never forget that Hitler was
elected,

220
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,750
you know,
when he was elected by a large margin

221
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:25,590
majority too.

222
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,530
It was a landslide vote.
The kind of vote that no modern

223
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:31,530
democratic leader ever gets.
So,

224
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,380
you know,
although it's difficult to,

225
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,740
it's difficult for people to swallow.
Um,

226
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:43,490
it's hard not to assign culpability for
what happened in Germany to the society

227
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:49,410
at every strata.
You can't just dump it on the leaders

228
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:49,680
and,
and,

229
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,050
and in fact,
one of the things that,

230
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:53,740
here's,
here's something to think about with

231
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:55,300
regards to Hitler.
So,

232
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:58,540
because one of the things you might ask
is how the hell could he be so,

233
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:03,010
so absolutely compelling to his
audiences.

234
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:03,491
But here,
here,

235
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:05,770
I'll give you an explanation.
So let's,

236
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:08,020
let's make the,
let's make a few assumptions.

237
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:12,610
The first assumption is there are a lot
of resentful Germans kicking around.

238
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,560
Why?
Well,

239
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,050
they lost the first world war.
That wasn't so good.

240
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:20,860
And then there were a lot of brutal man
left because they'd been in the trenches

241
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:23,500
and they'd been shooting,
fighting and shooting at each other

242
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,100
under absolutely aborad conditions for
like years and years.

243
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,230
And so there were plenty of brutalized
men around.

244
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,440
Um,
and then their whole damned economy

245
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:36,790
collapsed because they were forced into
signing what historians regard is a very

246
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:41,080
punitive peace treaty.
And so like everything had fallen apart

247
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,660
to a degree that we can't even begin to
imagine.

248
00:12:43,661 --> 00:12:44,950
And so,
you know,

249
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,620
in the 1930s,
the Germans were starting to get back on

250
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:49,510
their feet and,
and um,

251
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,840
when Hitler came to power,
he started not only to rearm but to ray

252
00:12:52,841 --> 00:12:55,780
industrialize the economy and he was
actually pretty damn good at that.

253
00:12:55,781 --> 00:12:58,930
So now Hitler was a good orator,
but he,

254
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,870
but he,
it isn't exactly clear that he was a

255
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,880
coherent philosophical theorize or
although to think of him as stupid as it

256
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,050
is completely missing the point.
He was by no means stupid.

257
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,900
Um,
I wouldn't say that he was particularly

258
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:16,750
educated,
but he had a very powerfully developed

259
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:21,010
aesthetic sense and he spent a lot of
his time designing the cities that would

260
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:24,370
be built after World War II was over in
those cities were generally

261
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,390
conceptualize by him,
has places where the arts or at least a

262
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:31,390
Nazi version of the arts could flourish,
you know,

263
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:35,500
so there's no real evidence that what
was wrong with the Nazis was that they

264
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:36,760
were civilized.

265
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,600
There's more evidence actually I think
that they were too civilized and I'll

266
00:13:40,601 --> 00:13:42,880
talk to you about that later.
But anyways,

267
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:45,700
you think,
how did Hitler get all these people

268
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:48,040
under his spell?
Well,

269
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:51,370
here's a hypothesis that's basically
derived from union thinking.

270
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:54,730
And I should let you know by the way,
because sometimes young has been accused

271
00:13:54,731 --> 00:13:57,730
of being an anti Semite and there's
various reasons for this,

272
00:13:57,731 --> 00:13:59,950
partly because of what happened during
World War II.

273
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,910
And pardon me,
because I'm,

274
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,500
his theory drew heavily from
Christianity,

275
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:08,920
although for many other sources as well.
And he did believe that there were

276
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:12,280
differences in the psychology of people
with different ethnicities.

277
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:13,330
And now,
you know,

278
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,360
whether that's racist or not,
depends on whether or not you like the

279
00:14:16,361 --> 00:14:19,900
person you're talking to because the
lefties think that there are cultural

280
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,450
differences in they're important.
But if you ever talk about them in the

281
00:14:22,451 --> 00:14:24,670
wrong way,
then you're racist and the right

282
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:26,320
wingers,
while they just think there are ethnic

283
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:27,550
differences to begin with.

284
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,370
So it's a tricky,
it's a tricky issue.

285
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:33,430
If there aren't differences that are
important than who the hell cares about

286
00:14:33,431 --> 00:14:36,100
multiculturalism,
it's not even worth preserving.

287
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,950
And if there are differences,
well then you're stuck with having to

288
00:14:38,951 --> 00:14:41,530
deal with the differences.
So you're basically screwed either way.

289
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,950
So anyways,
young has been the target of many

290
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:49,060
accusations of antisemitism,
particularly by biographers who were

291
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:52,100
resentful and clueless and historically
uninformed.

292
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:55,700
And um,
I would say malevolent fundamentally.

293
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,490
Um,
he worked as a CIA agent,

294
00:14:58,491 --> 00:15:00,860
it was just revealed last year and he,
he,

295
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:05,660
he provided psychological reports to the
American government on the underlying

296
00:15:05,661 --> 00:15:08,690
psychological structure of the Nazi
leaders for years.

297
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,330
And he never told anybody about that
while he was alive.

298
00:15:11,331 --> 00:15:14,570
It only came to light,
like it only came to light as far as I

299
00:15:14,571 --> 00:15:16,730
know last year or perhaps a year before
that.

300
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,130
So.
So anyways,

301
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:19,851
the Germans,
you know,

302
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:22,010
they weren't very happy about the whole
damn situation.

303
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,920
And so when they were aggregating on
Mohs you think,

304
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:27,230
well what happens when all people get
together in a group?

305
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,060
You know,
when we talked about that last time when

306
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:32,480
we talked about Kierkegaard is idea that
as soon as you get a bunch of people

307
00:15:32,481 --> 00:15:34,850
together,
no matter how truthful they are,

308
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:38,900
all as individuals,
instantly the crowd is not a truthful

309
00:15:38,901 --> 00:15:40,040
thing.
And you know,

310
00:15:40,041 --> 00:15:40,660
there,
there,

311
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,000
there are,
there are real reasons for that.

312
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:46,250
Real psychological reasons.
So there's the famous ash experiments,

313
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:47,900
I hope that those are the right
experiments.

314
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:51,020
A S C h about line length,
you know,

315
00:15:51,021 --> 00:15:55,370
so you draw two lines on the board and
they're the same length and you get the

316
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,750
crowd to collaborate with you and you
ask some poor sucker who doesn't know

317
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,180
about the game,
uh,

318
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,510
to play.
And you know,

319
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:04,070
you ask one person and they say,
no,

320
00:16:04,071 --> 00:16:05,810
those lines are different in length.

321
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,010
And you ask another person,
they say,

322
00:16:07,011 --> 00:16:07,450
well,
yeah,

323
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,740
they're quite different in length.
And another person says,

324
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,840
yeah,
the sure I can see the difference in

325
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:13,670
length.
And then you ask the poor pigeon,

326
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:15,470
you know,
are they different in length?

327
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,200
And he says,
yes.

328
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,960
You know,
and you can understand why.

329
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:25,670
It's like if all those other people are
saying it does either there's either

330
00:16:25,671 --> 00:16:29,570
something wrong with all of them,
which seems unlikely or he's the victim

331
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,450
of a conspiracy,
which is a little on the paranoid side

332
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:34,970
but happens to actually be true in this
case.

333
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,360
Um,
or he's just not looking at it.

334
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:39,290
Right.
And you might think,

335
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,660
well,
the humble thing to think is he's wrong.

336
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:42,681
And so,
you know,

337
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:45,620
the fact that somebody might go along
with the crowd,

338
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:46,880
you know,
you can,

339
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,100
you can,
you can blame that on their,

340
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,340
on their ability to be social and
conventional,

341
00:16:52,341 --> 00:16:56,360
which in many ways is a huge advantage
because if you are all antisocial and

342
00:16:56,361 --> 00:16:58,010
unconventional,
you know,

343
00:16:58,011 --> 00:17:02,570
I mean there'd be a good chunk of you in
jail and we certainly wouldn't be having

344
00:17:02,571 --> 00:17:03,111
this,
you know,

345
00:17:03,111 --> 00:17:05,600
delightful,
peaceful conversation that we're having.

346
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,111
So,
you know,

347
00:17:06,111 --> 00:17:10,520
you don't want to underestimate the
utility of conventionality to too much

348
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:12,950
of a degree.
Anyway,

349
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:17,000
so
there's this funny story I read once,

350
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:18,560
I don't think it's true,
but it might be,

351
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:24,040
whereas psychology class got together
and decided they'd play a trick on the

352
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:27,430
professor.
And the trick was that he would walk

353
00:17:27,431 --> 00:17:28,500
back and forth a,
and,

354
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,900
and the trick was that they wouldn't pay
any attention to them at all if he was

355
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:33,280
on the left side of the room.
You know,

356
00:17:33,281 --> 00:17:35,170
they talk a bit and look,
look up.

357
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,940
And if he was on the right side of the
room,

358
00:17:36,941 --> 00:17:38,840
then they'd really focus in and pay
attention.

359
00:17:38,841 --> 00:17:41,800
And the story goes that by the,
you know,

360
00:17:41,801 --> 00:17:44,710
by several weeks of this little trick,
they had them like lecturing right

361
00:17:44,711 --> 00:17:45,700
beside the door,
you know,

362
00:17:45,701 --> 00:17:48,880
and he wouldn't move from that spot.
And so the reason I'm telling you that

363
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:53,490
is it's pretty obvious that people can
respond to the cues that a crowd is

364
00:17:53,491 --> 00:17:54,630
delivering.
You know,

365
00:17:54,631 --> 00:17:56,310
when a good speaker does that,
right?

366
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,150
So a good speaker does a variety of
things and one is the never talks to

367
00:18:00,151 --> 00:18:02,160
the,
to the crowd per se.

368
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,410
You know,
when you pick out specific individuals

369
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:07,980
and talk to them and they're sort of
reflective of the crowd and then you can

370
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:10,640
tell if everybody's understanding.
And uh,

371
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:14,580
the other thing that a good speaker does
is pay attention to the damn responses

372
00:18:14,581 --> 00:18:17,490
of the crowd because you know,
if,

373
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,030
if a lecture is really a dialogue,
even though the,

374
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:26,090
the audience is only emitting nonverbal,
the nonverbal elements of the

375
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:28,710
conversation,
those nonverbal elements,

376
00:18:28,711 --> 00:18:33,090
those damn things are important.
So you want to stay in touch with the

377
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:36,030
nonverbal communications.
Now Hitler,

378
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,920
he's kind of a chaotic guy,
you know,

379
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,620
he's very angry.
He's angry in part because he was a

380
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:43,620
frustrated art student.
He tried to get into art school like

381
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:47,880
four times.
So really the person to blame for World

382
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,300
War II was the foreperson committee that
wouldn't let poor Hitler into the,

383
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,720
I believe it was the Viennese School of
art because he really wanted to go,

384
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,700
you know,
and he had some artistic talent.

385
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,330
He was a little on the conventional side
by all appearances.

386
00:19:00,331 --> 00:19:03,150
But you know,
I've seen some of his sketches and you

387
00:19:03,151 --> 00:19:05,070
know,
he wasn't a complete piker and he kind

388
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:08,070
of felt maybe it would be okay for him
to go to university because he just been

389
00:19:08,071 --> 00:19:09,450
through World War One,
you know?

390
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:13,050
And that wasn't much fun.
There's a story about Hitler where he

391
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:16,800
was out on in the trenches and he was
there with all his buddies and he

392
00:19:16,801 --> 00:19:19,020
wandered off to do whatever he wandered
off to do.

393
00:19:19,021 --> 00:19:22,140
And when he came back they were all dead
because a bomb had blended right in the

394
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:23,490
middle of them.
And you know,

395
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,970
you might think that would do the little
something to your psyche because after

396
00:19:26,971 --> 00:19:28,830
an experience like that,
you're either going to think,

397
00:19:28,831 --> 00:19:30,990
oh man,
things are pretty damn random and

398
00:19:30,991 --> 00:19:32,160
horrible,
or there's pretty,

399
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:36,270
there's something pretty damn special
about me because I wasn't killed by the

400
00:19:36,271 --> 00:19:36,660
bomb.

401
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:39,060
You know,
maybe God has saved me for a higher

402
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:39,900
purpose.
I mean,

403
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:44,160
you can be absolutely sure that if you
went through an experience like that,

404
00:19:44,161 --> 00:19:46,620
that something like that would be
rattling around in your mind.

405
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,020
And he won.
He won a medal for bravery,

406
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,290
you know,
so he kinda,

407
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,810
and he,
after World War One,

408
00:19:51,811 --> 00:19:56,010
he kind of wandered around like a lot of
men unemployed in sort of like a tramp,

409
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:57,660
you know.
So it wasn't very happy about that.

410
00:19:57,661 --> 00:19:58,770
And,
and you know,

411
00:19:58,771 --> 00:20:01,200
no wonder.
So anyways,

412
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,280
he didn't get into art school.
Now he didn't really have a fully

413
00:20:05,281 --> 00:20:07,070
developed political theory,
you know?

414
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,300
And,
but he was pretty good at speaking,

415
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:11,340
so,
and there were lots of people who had

416
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:14,940
come to s to hear him speak because
people were sort of trying to figure out

417
00:20:14,941 --> 00:20:17,220
what the hell to do about all the chaos,
you know,

418
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,200
so then you think,
well,

419
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,340
what did he,
what was hitting?

420
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,040
They're good at.
Well,

421
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,200
okay,
now I'm going to switch to a slightly

422
00:20:25,201 --> 00:20:27,060
different story and then I'll get back
to this one.

423
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:29,700
So I don't know if you guys know about
the,

424
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:34,290
uh,
the daycare scandals that,

425
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:37,110
that were very,
very common in the 1980s.

426
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:41,250
So horribly common,
actually this infested many towns.

427
00:20:41,251 --> 00:20:44,610
And usually what would happen is
somebody who is a little on the paranoid

428
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:49,150
side or maybe a lot on the paranoid side
was their children off to daycare.

429
00:20:49,151 --> 00:20:50,680
And that was a whole new thing in the
80s,

430
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:51,580
right?
Because women were,

431
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,740
you know,
moving into the workforce like mad.

432
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:56,230
And so they were handing over there
often their infants,

433
00:20:56,231 --> 00:20:58,960
kids below three say two total
strangers.

434
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:01,450
And you know,
for some of them that set up a fair bit

435
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:02,800
of worry.
Like it's still does.

436
00:21:02,801 --> 00:21:06,010
And sometimes that word got out of hand,
especially among the people who are a

437
00:21:06,011 --> 00:21:10,090
little on the little predisposed to
paranoid schizophrenia and maybe even

438
00:21:10,091 --> 00:21:11,980
had had some previous episodes.

439
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,970
And so,
you know,

440
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:17,260
the kid would come home and the mother
would observe or not something kind of

441
00:21:17,261 --> 00:21:20,470
peculiar about their behavior.
And then she'd fantasize about maybe

442
00:21:20,471 --> 00:21:23,200
what that was.
And then when she started asking the

443
00:21:23,201 --> 00:21:26,920
child if the child had been touched in
any particular way and you know,

444
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,350
and she keeps this up for a good length
of time.

445
00:21:29,351 --> 00:21:33,120
And then the child would start to have
nightmares and then the child would tell

446
00:21:33,121 --> 00:21:36,310
the mother about what the nightmares
were and then that would freak her out.

447
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:38,590
And so she'd ask even deeper questions
and soon,

448
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,540
you know,
her children were telling her that

449
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,030
horrible things were happening to them
at daycare.

450
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,200
And so then she'd go to the police and
they wouldn't look into recycling

451
00:21:46,201 --> 00:21:48,610
patrick background.
And then the police would go out and

452
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:50,500
they'd start to interview other
children.

453
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,250
And if they interviewed them properly,
then the other children would start to

454
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:56,970
produce all these stories as well.
Because the now,

455
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,630
how did that happen?
Well,

456
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,450
a bunch of ways.
The first is

457
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,780
the police would ask leading questions
like,

458
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,910
did anyone touch you?
Well,

459
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,460
of course I'm going to touch the cans.
I mean,

460
00:22:11,461 --> 00:22:14,490
people touch kids.
Did anybody touch you there?

461
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,650
Well,
that's not a question.

462
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,810
That's a piece of information.
The piece of information is if someone

463
00:22:21,811 --> 00:22:25,980
touched me there and adult would be very
interested in that,

464
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,860
right?
So now at what's a child doing when he's

465
00:22:28,861 --> 00:22:31,950
answering and adults questions,
wealth child doesn't bloody well know

466
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,900
what the hell do they know?
They're like three.

467
00:22:33,901 --> 00:22:36,810
You know,
they can't hardly organize their story.

468
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,910
You know,
if you're talking to a kid and you want

469
00:22:38,911 --> 00:22:41,700
to give,
get them to give you an account of their

470
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,310
day,
you have to really guide them through

471
00:22:44,311 --> 00:22:47,670
the Organization of their memory.
And partly what they're doing when

472
00:22:47,671 --> 00:22:51,120
you're doing that is they're looking at
you trying to figure out if they're

473
00:22:51,121 --> 00:22:54,420
telling you the right things,
which is what they should be doing.

474
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:58,170
Because what they're trying to learn to
do is to tell people things in a way

475
00:22:58,171 --> 00:23:00,570
that they'll understand them.
But that makes the child very,

476
00:23:00,571 --> 00:23:05,190
very responsive to the nonverbal and
verbal cues of the adult.

477
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,520
You think about how fast those little
rats learn how to pick up language.

478
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:10,920
You know,
it's really very fast and no one really

479
00:23:10,921 --> 00:23:13,620
teaches them.
They're just paying attention like mad.

480
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:18,030
So you get a bunch of cops who were on
how like a half cocked adventure and

481
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:21,720
they think there's some serial sexual
pervert in their midst and they go

482
00:23:21,721 --> 00:23:22,950
interview,
you know,

483
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,650
1520 kids and they do do,
do it,

484
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,200
do it a lot.
They use little dolls and they do it a

485
00:23:28,201 --> 00:23:32,040
lot and they do it a lot and they do it
a lot and sooner or later all the kids

486
00:23:32,041 --> 00:23:36,270
start having nightmares and then they
start telling the cops there's all these

487
00:23:36,271 --> 00:23:37,470
terrible things happen.

488
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:39,720
Like they're taking into underground
caverns in there,

489
00:23:39,721 --> 00:23:44,130
strip naked and they're forced to like
leap frog over each other and like you

490
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,760
just can't believe what happened.
You can't believe it.

491
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:49,550
It's all documented in a book called
Satan's silence,

492
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,830
which was written by a social worker and
a lawyer.

493
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,760
It's mind boggling.
The longest prison sentence is in

494
00:23:55,761 --> 00:24:00,761
American history were handed out to it
to a series of middle aged women who are

495
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:04,580
taking care of little kids.
And the FBI even came up with a whole

496
00:24:04,581 --> 00:24:09,440
new criminal category,
late onset female sexual offender.

497
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,020
Well,
why didn't that category exists before?

498
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,290
It's simple.
There are no late onset,

499
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:19,700
middle aged female sexual offenders.
That's why we didn't need the category.

500
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,610
But once all these accusations came up,
well poof,

501
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:24,470
you know,
you had to have some damn category for

502
00:24:24,471 --> 00:24:28,070
these poor women.
Some of them were put in jail for 350

503
00:24:28,071 --> 00:24:30,560
years,
which seems a bit excessive given that

504
00:24:30,561 --> 00:24:32,750
they're only going to last about 40 you
know,

505
00:24:32,751 --> 00:24:35,630
they'd get 12 consecutive life
sentences.

506
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:36,890
So it,
and you know,

507
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:41,891
there was actually a situation where one
town went so far as to start digging

508
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,420
underneath the town to find these
underground satanic layers where all

509
00:24:47,421 --> 00:24:50,300
these weird ritual things were going on,
you know,

510
00:24:50,301 --> 00:24:55,301
and along with this was not one shred of
Collab of concrete evidence,

511
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,970
you know,
and the eventual conclusions and this

512
00:24:58,971 --> 00:25:02,540
affected thousands of people.
The eventual conclusions was while

513
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:04,550
they're,
there actually isn't anybody who's,

514
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:05,720
you know,
Saint,

515
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:07,330
technically,
uh,

516
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:10,400
torturing children in daycare centers
now,

517
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,770
now anyways,
why am I telling you this?

518
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,443
Well,

519
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,650
what the children were doing,
you think about how the hell did the

520
00:25:24,651 --> 00:25:27,590
children come up with these weird ideas?
You know,

521
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:28,551
I mean,
first of all,

522
00:25:28,551 --> 00:25:32,660
we should note the children are not
stupid and they can also dream up the

523
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:34,580
most horrible things,
you know,

524
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:37,070
um,
because they have an imagination that's

525
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:40,490
capable of extending itself out into the
terrifying.

526
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:43,190
Now everyone knows that because all you
have to do is remember when you were a

527
00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:44,450
kid,
you know,

528
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:47,300
when you were hiding under the covers
because there were horrible things in

529
00:25:47,301 --> 00:25:49,070
your dark room.
You know,

530
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,430
you can populate the darkness with
monsters with no problem.

531
00:25:52,431 --> 00:25:54,770
And you should be able to,
because there are monsters in the

532
00:25:54,771 --> 00:25:56,870
darkness.
Even though your parents might tell you

533
00:25:56,871 --> 00:25:59,500
there aren't,
it's like there might not be any door

534
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:02,540
monsters in that particular piece of
darkness.

535
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:05,120
And that's a perfectly reasonable thing
to tell your children.

536
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,550
But in the darkness as a whole,
it's like,

537
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:08,870
yeah,
look the hell out.

538
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,670
So the children aren't stupid now.
So then the PA,

539
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:15,080
the,
the adults start to question them and

540
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:18,410
the kids or the back of their brain,
the little imaginative part is thinking,

541
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,810
what do these people want?
What do these people want?

542
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,360
What do these people want?
And so they'll throw him out a little

543
00:26:23,361 --> 00:26:26,360
bit of information and they'll,
the adults will perk up.

544
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,640
They'll focus right on that piece of
information.

545
00:26:28,641 --> 00:26:33,641
So maybe it's a cop who really hates
childs satanist abductors,

546
00:26:33,681 --> 00:26:34,431
which,
you know,

547
00:26:34,431 --> 00:26:39,230
it's perfectly reasonable stance.
And so when the child offers any

548
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:42,620
information about,
about the existence of such a thing,

549
00:26:42,621 --> 00:26:45,210
while the cop will perk up and then the
child thinks,

550
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:45,781
oh,
I see,

551
00:26:45,781 --> 00:26:47,280
well,
so sort of what's going on,

552
00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:49,950
it seems to have something to do.
They don't think this consciously,

553
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,140
you know,
but their imagination is working.

554
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:56,130
How do I model the reality that's being
presented to me?

555
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,350
And that's when the dream start to kick
in too.

556
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:02,040
Okay.
So by

557
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:09,020
speaking in the appropriate way,
you can get all sorts of things churned

558
00:27:10,201 --> 00:27:13,590
up in the,
in the unconscious minds of your

559
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:14,424
listeners.

560
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:23,500
And by watching them as well,
you can extract out there unconscious

561
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:25,730
desires.
Someone,

562
00:27:25,731 --> 00:27:30,731
now I'm speaking to you all and you're
all irritated because your life has been

563
00:27:31,491 --> 00:27:35,720
really awful for 15 years.
And I'm saying this and I'm saying that

564
00:27:35,721 --> 00:27:38,330
and I'm saying this and I'm saying that,
you know,

565
00:27:38,331 --> 00:27:40,550
and then I say something,
maybe I say something,

566
00:27:40,551 --> 00:27:41,384
uh,

567
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:43,980
initially,
ah,

568
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:49,390
dismissive of Jews and you're all mad
and there's two or three people who go,

569
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,770
yeah,
and then I think,

570
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,540
oh,
I'm not going to hold.

571
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,500
That's kind of an interesting response.
And then,

572
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:58,340
you know,
I lay out a couple more ideas and some

573
00:27:58,341 --> 00:28:00,020
of them don't get any response and
others,

574
00:28:00,021 --> 00:28:01,530
you know,
people perk right up and,

575
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,870
and I'm not stupid and I'm trying to get
the bloody attention of the crowd.

576
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:11,620
And so if I do that 50 times,
the crowd's going to tell me an awful

577
00:28:13,041 --> 00:28:15,950
lot about what they want,
especially if I'm willing to follow

578
00:28:15,951 --> 00:28:17,990
them.
And I can do that easily because,

579
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,600
especially if I can start to work the
crowd a little bit,

580
00:28:20,601 --> 00:28:23,510
because I can capitalize on their
emotional,

581
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:27,200
on their emotional,
capitalize on their emotions and the

582
00:28:27,201 --> 00:28:30,140
display of that emulsion,
and I can learn to play that.

583
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,960
And then that turns into a positive
feedback loop.

584
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,010
And so Hitler's informing the audience
and the audiences informing Hitler,

585
00:28:37,011 --> 00:28:40,880
and that's why you'll believe that
Hitler embodied the shadow of the German

586
00:28:40,881 --> 00:28:41,714
people.

587
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,463
Yeah.

588
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:53,870
So that's another reason why you should
be careful what you say and why you say

589
00:28:53,871 --> 00:28:55,760
it.
You know,

590
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:58,370
why you're looking for attention and all
of those things,

591
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:01,610
and actually what's motivating you and
actually what's motivating the people

592
00:29:01,611 --> 00:29:05,060
who are listening to you.
Because God only knows where it might go

593
00:29:05,061 --> 00:29:06,560
if you're not careful.
Well,

594
00:29:06,561 --> 00:29:08,840
actually we do know where it goes if
you're not careful.

595
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,960
And it's not pretty,
that's for sure.

596
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,150
And to think that we've learned anything
from that,

597
00:29:14,151 --> 00:29:15,140
it's like,
no,

598
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,500
that's not right.
We haven't learned a damn thing from it.

599
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:22,670
So because we don't want to understand
it now,

600
00:29:22,671 --> 00:29:24,620
these guys were all concerned with that
sort of thing.

601
00:29:24,621 --> 00:29:26,030
They're highly concerned with it.
Now,

602
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,810
Vince Wanger and boss had both been
influenced by Freud and bite you.

603
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,240
You can see in the bottom right hand
corner there,

604
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:37,330
that's a boss with you and,
and that's been swinger on the left and

605
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:38,840
boss at the top there.

606
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,830
So you know,
they're,

607
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:43,660
they're pretty thoughtful looking guys
and they were pretty damn smart and they

608
00:29:43,661 --> 00:29:47,860
were quite philosophically oriented and
they had both studied heidegger and they

609
00:29:47,861 --> 00:29:52,420
both studied Husserl who were German
philosophers on heidegger actually got

610
00:29:52,421 --> 00:29:55,840
tangled right up into the Nazi movement.
And you know,

611
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:59,740
his philosophy has been cast under a
cloud of suspicion,

612
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:03,220
perhaps a well deserved cloud of
suspicion as a consequence of his

613
00:30:03,221 --> 00:30:07,990
cooperation with the Nazis.
So it wasn't only stupid people who got

614
00:30:07,991 --> 00:30:10,480
tangled up in this,
it was pretty much everybody who got

615
00:30:10,481 --> 00:30:12,610
tangled up in it.
Then one of the things you might be

616
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,650
might think about,
and this is we're thinking about,

617
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:18,550
is that if you were there for any one of
you,

618
00:30:18,551 --> 00:30:21,250
there's a 90% chance that you would have
got tangled up in it.

619
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,990
You know,
you wouldn't have been the person who

620
00:30:22,991 --> 00:30:25,300
rescued the Gypsies is like forget that.

621
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,940
It's like,
unless you think that you know you're a

622
00:30:27,941 --> 00:30:30,760
heroic far beyond the average and I
would be very,

623
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:34,270
very careful about assuming that you
could assume instead that you would have

624
00:30:34,271 --> 00:30:37,840
been swept along with the crowd just
like everyone else because everyone else

625
00:30:37,841 --> 00:30:42,400
was all right.
Now part of what these guys were trying

626
00:30:42,401 --> 00:30:45,880
to figure out is in some sense there
were two things.

627
00:30:45,881 --> 00:30:48,790
There was the,
the function and structure of belief

628
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:53,791
systems and then the nature of that
which transcends a belief system.

629
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,520
Okay.
So you know what transcends a belief

630
00:30:57,521 --> 00:31:00,700
system is what you don't know if you use
that belief system,

631
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,650
right?
Because there are things outside of your

632
00:31:02,651 --> 00:31:05,500
belief system and they have a nature as
well.

633
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:09,370
And you usually run into those sorts of
things when you make a mistake and

634
00:31:09,371 --> 00:31:12,880
things don't happen the way you expect
them to or want them to or desire them

635
00:31:12,881 --> 00:31:13,540
to.

636
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,640
So,
and then the other problem they're

637
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:17,620
trying to solve in some senses.
Well,

638
00:31:17,621 --> 00:31:22,621
what's the appropriate mode of behavior
for an individual in relationship to

639
00:31:23,471 --> 00:31:26,950
belief systems and to the world that
transcends the belief systems?

640
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,500
And the reason they were interested not
is because they thought,

641
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,390
well,
maybe it would be a good event.

642
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:34,780
Good idea of our belief systems didn't
get so damn pathological.

643
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,430
Because if they do,
then you know,

644
00:31:36,431 --> 00:31:41,230
6 million people end up in ovens or the
equivalent and 120 million people end up

645
00:31:41,231 --> 00:31:43,080
dead in battlefields.
And you know,

646
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:46,720
that doesn't count the stallon massacres
or mile who were,

647
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:49,210
you know,
made Hitler in some sense look like an

648
00:31:49,211 --> 00:31:51,010
absolute amateur.
I mean,

649
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:56,011
Stalin starved 6 million people to death
in Ukraine in the 1930s and he was just

650
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,670
warming up.
You know,

651
00:31:57,671 --> 00:31:59,560
I don't know how many,
how many of you have heard of the

652
00:31:59,561 --> 00:32:00,394
Ukraine famine?

653
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:04,090
How many of you have you haven't?
Yeah,

654
00:32:04,091 --> 00:32:05,470
well think about that.
You know,

655
00:32:05,471 --> 00:32:08,050
how many of you knew Mao killed 100
million people?

656
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,480
How many of you didn't?
Yeah.

657
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:12,610
Well you might think about why you don't
know that.

658
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,680
You know,
you know about the Damn Nazis,

659
00:32:14,681 --> 00:32:17,680
but you don't know about the horrors
that the communists perpetrated.

660
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,190
It's worth thinking about why?
Because the communists,

661
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:25,330
especially the Maoist man,
those people were brutal.

662
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:30,100
So it's really important.
Like of all the things we could possibly

663
00:32:30,101 --> 00:32:34,090
learn psychologically from the 20th
century and is what these characters in

664
00:32:34,091 --> 00:32:35,980
the 50s were concentrating on it,
it's like,

665
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:39,270
okay,
things can go powerfully sideways.

666
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,660
It was quite a shock to everyone because
in some sense,

667
00:32:41,661 --> 00:32:44,070
you know,
everyone was pretty thrilled that the

668
00:32:44,071 --> 00:32:46,550
beginning of the 19th century that
religion,

669
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:49,100
classical religion beliefs had crumbled.
You know,

670
00:32:49,101 --> 00:32:51,980
the Marxist said,
well the damn religions were only there

671
00:32:51,981 --> 00:32:55,490
to oppress the poor anyways and to keep
the priesthood in the aristocracy in

672
00:32:55,491 --> 00:32:56,470
power.
You know,

673
00:32:56,471 --> 00:32:58,310
you'll,
I'm sure you learn plenty of that in

674
00:32:58,311 --> 00:32:59,630
your,
in your classes,

675
00:32:59,631 --> 00:33:00,770
that sort of thinking,
you know,

676
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:04,130
it's power economics related thinking
and it's typical of,

677
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,980
of of what,
what would you say?

678
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,553
MMM.

679
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:12,410
Intellectually manipulative.
Left wing thinkers.

680
00:33:12,411 --> 00:33:14,630
I would say that's basically the
routine.

681
00:33:14,631 --> 00:33:16,550
You know,
they reduce everything to a single damn

682
00:33:16,551 --> 00:33:18,770
motivation.
It's usually economics or power.

683
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:21,680
Then they explain everything from that
perspective.

684
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:25,430
It's like it's so boneheaded it should
be illegal anyways.

685
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:30,603
Okay.

686
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:33,320
The Marxists,
we're happy that religion had collapsed

687
00:33:33,321 --> 00:33:35,090
because they thought that that would
eliminate an,

688
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:38,360
an entire strata of oppression.
And you can see that it's not like the

689
00:33:38,361 --> 00:33:39,740
Catholic church,
for example,

690
00:33:39,741 --> 00:33:41,870
was free of corruption.
You know,

691
00:33:41,871 --> 00:33:44,990
it was in many ways it corrupt
enterprise and you could read it as

692
00:33:44,991 --> 00:33:47,000
solely a corrupt enterprise.
And you know,

693
00:33:47,001 --> 00:33:48,620
to hell with it,
it's good that it's gone.

694
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,023
And uh,

695
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,170
you know,
the Friday and it's basically thought

696
00:33:54,171 --> 00:33:56,000
the same way.
And so did most intellectuals,

697
00:33:56,001 --> 00:33:59,030
Freud thought that religion was nothing
than a,

698
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:04,090
than a childish delusion that people
identified with because they were afraid

699
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:06,770
of dying.
It was a,

700
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,810
you know,
it was a defense against death,

701
00:34:08,811 --> 00:34:09,920
anxiety.
Look,

702
00:34:09,921 --> 00:34:12,230
the Marxist argument and the,
and the Floridian and argument,

703
00:34:12,231 --> 00:34:14,150
those are bloody powerful arguments,
you know,

704
00:34:14,151 --> 00:34:15,710
cause you can see it.
You'll do,

705
00:34:15,711 --> 00:34:18,500
people use their religious belief as a
defense against things.

706
00:34:18,501 --> 00:34:21,440
They're too terrified to confront.
Well obviously,

707
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,050
you know,
does the Church press people?

708
00:34:24,051 --> 00:34:24,411
Did it?
Oh,

709
00:34:24,411 --> 00:34:25,400
press people,
get it,

710
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:26,680
engage in,
you know,

711
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,570
conspiracies with people in power across
centuries.

712
00:34:29,571 --> 00:34:31,010
It's like,
obviously,

713
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,140
you know,
the question is,

714
00:34:33,141 --> 00:34:34,790
well,
what do you make of that?

715
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,980
Well,
partly you make of it that all sorts of

716
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,550
structures do that.
It's like structures do that and you

717
00:34:40,551 --> 00:34:43,160
know,
you can't just damn one structure and

718
00:34:43,161 --> 00:34:44,570
thanked the others are gonna,
you know,

719
00:34:44,571 --> 00:34:46,760
it's like the right wingers,
they're always owned about big

720
00:34:46,761 --> 00:34:48,150
government,
how terrible that isn't.

721
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:51,620
Left wingers are always on about how big
corporations are terrible.

722
00:34:51,621 --> 00:34:53,840
It's like,
well bank is terrible.

723
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:57,830
It doesn't matter if it's government or
corporations because things tend to tilt

724
00:34:57,831 --> 00:35:02,210
towards corruption across time and then
that has to be taken into account.

725
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:03,703
But

726
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,970
anyway,
so the Friday comes and the

727
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:08,830
intellectuals in the Marxists,
we're all pretty happy when the

728
00:35:08,831 --> 00:35:13,270
religious dream started to come apart
and they believe that the new edifice is

729
00:35:13,271 --> 00:35:17,200
that they were going to construct
fascist and communist would be so much

730
00:35:17,201 --> 00:35:19,450
better than what they replaced that,
you know,

731
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:23,000
everybody would be drowning in utopia.
And uh,

732
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:28,630
it's kind of too bad that isn't how it
turned out.

733
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,740
But it's certainly not how it turned
out.

734
00:35:31,741 --> 00:35:32,910
How it turned out was,

735
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:34,583
hmm,

736
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:38,070
sometimes when you something down,
even

737
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:42,390
if you think it's terrible,
you end up constructing something on its

738
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:46,710
ruins that makes the previous terrible
look like the work of rank amateurs.

739
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,320
And that's certainly what happened in
the 20th century.

740
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,920
I mean,
no matter what you say about the

741
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,440
Catholic Church and its basic barbarism,
especially when you know they were

742
00:35:55,441 --> 00:35:57,360
involved in the witch hunt in the middle
ages.

743
00:35:57,361 --> 00:36:00,840
It's like those guys,
they were amateurs compared to the

744
00:36:00,841 --> 00:36:02,490
fascists and the communists.
You know,

745
00:36:02,491 --> 00:36:04,860
they were counting their victims in the
tens of thousands,

746
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,880
not the hundreds of millions.
So anyways,

747
00:36:08,881 --> 00:36:12,810
things didn't go so well.
And so by the 1950s especially because

748
00:36:12,811 --> 00:36:16,290
of the Cold War started the day the
Second World War ended,

749
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:18,570
right.
And it ended with the atomic bomb in

750
00:36:18,571 --> 00:36:22,000
Japan and the Russians had the damn
atomic bomb like you know,

751
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,640
tomorrow.
Fundamentally.

752
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:28,850
And both the Russians and the Americans
had the hydrogen bomb by the early 1950s

753
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,150
and I don't know if you know this,
you can tell me how many of you know

754
00:36:33,151 --> 00:36:35,430
this.
Do you know that a hydrogen bomb uses an

755
00:36:35,431 --> 00:36:37,110
atom bomb for it's trigger?

756
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:42,270
Okay.
So the hydrogen bombs,

757
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,300
the atom bomb stands in relationship to
a hydrogen bomb.

758
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:50,250
Like the ignition cap on a shelf stands
in relationship to the gunpowder.

759
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,520
The atomic blast just gets the explosion
going.

760
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:56,040
So hydrogen bombs,
they're like way,

761
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,760
way more explosive than atomic bombs.
And so,

762
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:02,010
you know,
by the middle of the 1950s we'd pretty

763
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:06,300
much put herself in a position where,
and they were building some mighty big

764
00:37:06,301 --> 00:37:07,410
bumps.
I mean,

765
00:37:07,411 --> 00:37:11,040
really unbelievable.
Unbelievably big bombs,

766
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:14,070
you know,
400 times as big as the ones that wiped

767
00:37:14,071 --> 00:37:15,990
out here.
Ashima like huge,

768
00:37:15,991 --> 00:37:18,840
huge bumps and they're getting pretty
damn good at it.

769
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:21,540
You know?
So by the mid 1950s it was like

770
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:26,400
we developed enough firepower on both
sides of the Atlantic,

771
00:37:26,401 --> 00:37:29,280
along with the missiles necessary to
deliver them,

772
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:32,130
which the Nazis had basically invented
in World War II.

773
00:37:32,131 --> 00:37:34,200
Right?
It was all Nazi scientists who invented

774
00:37:34,201 --> 00:37:37,770
rockets and they were all taken by the
Americans after the Second World War to

775
00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:39,990
work on the American space program,
basically.

776
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,190
And so by the 1950s we had the missiles
to deliver the damn things too.

777
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:47,520
So not only were the psychologists who
were thinking about things sort of

778
00:37:47,521 --> 00:37:51,000
shorted out about what happened in World
War II for good reason.

779
00:37:51,001 --> 00:37:54,420
And then of course all the stalinists
horrors were starting to be revealed at

780
00:37:54,421 --> 00:37:56,790
that point.
Although it took western intellectuals

781
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:59,790
like 30 years before they gave them any
credence at all.

782
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:03,660
Think John Paul Sartre was still a
member of the communist party up until

783
00:38:03,661 --> 00:38:07,410
1970 it was very common,
particularly among French intellectuals.

784
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:10,650
You know,
even though the news was getting out,

785
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,690
oh,
careful observers,

786
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:15,180
like George Orwell had pretty much
figured out by the,

787
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:21,740
by the late thirties that not all was
right in the paradise of Stellan.

788
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,780
But you know,
people didn't thought he was a right

789
00:38:23,781 --> 00:38:25,160
winger.
He didn't listen to a much,

790
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,630
even though he was a left winger.

791
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,043
Okay.

792
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:34,090
So are these,
these existential phenomenologists

793
00:38:34,091 --> 00:38:36,850
they're trying to figure out,
we've got a big problem here.

794
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:41,650
The belief systems are seriously going
sideways and there's some indication,

795
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:44,440
you know,
there's some individual responsibility

796
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,720
for that.
I've some indeterminant nature.

797
00:38:46,721 --> 00:38:49,990
Like if you live in a country where
everyone's turned into a fascist

798
00:38:49,991 --> 00:38:52,300
murderer,
like is that your fault?

799
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:53,403
Well,

800
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,540
you know,
it's not obvious that an individual

801
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:59,750
should be held responsible for the
actions of an entire country.

802
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:02,320
But then again,
the country's made up of individuals.

803
00:39:02,321 --> 00:39:05,210
So that's a very difficult problem to
solve.

804
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:07,790
You know,
and one of the tenants of Western law is

805
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:11,240
that you don't hold an individual
responsible for the actions of the

806
00:39:11,241 --> 00:39:14,450
group,
even if he or she happens to be a member

807
00:39:14,451 --> 00:39:18,520
willingly or unwillingly of that group.
But you can't ignore the fact that all

808
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:21,650
these things were made up of people.
And then you also can't ignore the fact

809
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:25,910
that it was individuals who were doing
the terrible things that were being done

810
00:39:25,911 --> 00:39:26,631
to people.
You know.

811
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:29,870
So in Auschwitz for example,
one of the little tricks that the guards

812
00:39:29,871 --> 00:39:31,400
used to do was to,
you know,

813
00:39:31,401 --> 00:39:34,250
they bring the Jews off the freight
cars.

814
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:37,220
A lot of them had died in the freight
cars cause they are packed in there like

815
00:39:37,221 --> 00:39:37,880
this,
you know.

816
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,670
So lots of them would suffocate or the
old ones would die.

817
00:39:40,671 --> 00:39:43,190
Or the little kids would die.
And that was okay.

818
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,380
You know,
and then on along the outside of the

819
00:39:45,381 --> 00:39:47,090
freight cars,
especially if it was winter,

820
00:39:47,091 --> 00:39:49,520
well it's like 20 below.
And so the ones on the outside would

821
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:50,870
freeze,
but you know where you were going to get

822
00:39:50,871 --> 00:39:53,810
rid of them anyways.
So that was just convenient mostly.

823
00:39:53,811 --> 00:39:58,130
So then you'd take them to Auschwitz and
they'd all spill out speaking different

824
00:39:58,131 --> 00:40:00,200
languages,
torn up from their family,

825
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,080
you know,
as miserable as people can possibly be.

826
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,800
And then one trick was to have,
you know,

827
00:40:06,801 --> 00:40:11,330
someone who is not quite dead enough,
pick up a sack of a wet,

828
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,990
a sack of wet salt.
So that's 100 pounds and carry it from

829
00:40:14,991 --> 00:40:18,140
one side of the compound to the other.
And then back,

830
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,120
you know,
one side and then back.

831
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,680
And you know,
you don't want to be thinking about

832
00:40:21,681 --> 00:40:24,110
these campuses like,
like a football field.

833
00:40:24,111 --> 00:40:27,140
These bloody things were cities.
They were big.

834
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,830
They held tens of thousands of people.
And so there's some guard.

835
00:40:30,831 --> 00:40:35,000
He thinks that's pretty good joke.
And it's not just a few people that are

836
00:40:35,001 --> 00:40:36,740
like that.
And we found out from the Stanford

837
00:40:36,741 --> 00:40:39,590
prison experiment,
which every psychologist likes to think

838
00:40:39,591 --> 00:40:41,060
of as immoral.
You know,

839
00:40:41,061 --> 00:40:45,530
because we actually discovered something
with it that if you gave ordinary people

840
00:40:45,531 --> 00:40:48,620
the opportunity to be fascist barbarians
in six days,

841
00:40:48,621 --> 00:40:51,950
30% of them would be.
And you know what we learned from that

842
00:40:51,951 --> 00:40:56,300
is that social psychologist shouldn't
run the Stanford prison experiment.

843
00:40:56,510 --> 00:41:01,510
That's not the right conclusion to draw.
So some of these phenomenologists are

844
00:41:02,151 --> 00:41:05,240
all where it all concerned about this.
It's like what the hell should we do

845
00:41:05,241 --> 00:41:07,910
about that?
So they're starting to think about how

846
00:41:07,911 --> 00:41:10,880
belief systems are constructed.
And so

847
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:18,080
the first proposition that they make is
that we should treat the reality that

848
00:41:18,081 --> 00:41:22,550
we're dealing with as psychologists.
We should treat human experiences that

849
00:41:22,551 --> 00:41:25,910
reality.
And so the reality for you from a

850
00:41:25,911 --> 00:41:28,940
phenomenological perspective is
everything you experienced,

851
00:41:28,941 --> 00:41:31,160
they assume everything you experienced
is real.

852
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:34,550
And they also assume that you can't get
more real than that.

853
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,980
And so your consciousness,
whatever that is,

854
00:41:36,981 --> 00:41:40,340
is real and your dreams are real and
your emotions are real and your pain is

855
00:41:40,341 --> 00:41:42,860
real,
which is a really useful thing to think

856
00:41:42,861 --> 00:41:45,890
if you want to make sure that you're not
going to hurt people.

857
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,660
You know,
you kind of have to think that maybe

858
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:51,490
think pain should be treated as a
fundamental reality instead of as an ff

859
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:55,520
phenomena of some material substrate.
And so that's their first perspective.

860
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:58,700
And they took that from heidegger
because heidegger thought that western

861
00:41:58,701 --> 00:42:02,150
philosophy had gone off,
got off on the wrong track,

862
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:05,720
you know,
3000 years ago because we didn't really

863
00:42:05,721 --> 00:42:09,020
concentrate on being itself as the
fundamental mystery.

864
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,600
And so the fundamental mystery is why
the hail?

865
00:42:11,601 --> 00:42:14,720
Is there anything?
And since there is something

866
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,890
experiential being what are its
fundamental elements?

867
00:42:18,891 --> 00:42:20,900
And so that's the phenomenological
stats.

868
00:42:20,901 --> 00:42:22,130
It's,
it's completely,

869
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:26,150
it's not the same as a scientific
approach because it starts with a

870
00:42:26,151 --> 00:42:27,850
different presupposition.
You know,

871
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:32,890
the scientific presupposition,
roughly speaking is that things are the

872
00:42:33,231 --> 00:42:37,190
objectively real elements of things are
the most real elements.

873
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:41,750
And there's no sense complaining about
that because it's an approach that works

874
00:42:41,751 --> 00:42:45,440
tremendously well for many,
many things including making hydrogen

875
00:42:45,441 --> 00:42:49,160
bombs for example.
But it's also reasonable to think that,

876
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:52,730
well it might not be the,
it might not be the whole truth and

877
00:42:52,731 --> 00:42:56,030
nothing but the truth.
And maybe you could also suspect that

878
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:59,900
the fact that we can manufacture
hydrogen bombs also might indicate that

879
00:42:59,901 --> 00:43:04,220
there's something trifle off with our
fundamental belief systems scientific

880
00:43:04,221 --> 00:43:05,180
though they may be.

881
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:07,590
And that was certainly something that
concerned Heidegger,

882
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,650
even though he got all tangled up with
the Nazis.

883
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:14,750
So the phenomenologists were trying to
take apart experience as such and they

884
00:43:14,751 --> 00:43:17,960
made some some hypotheses and then some
observation.

885
00:43:17,961 --> 00:43:22,130
So the first is that we're going to
assume that your experience like

886
00:43:22,131 --> 00:43:27,131
experience itself is real.
Now you just because dreams are real and

887
00:43:28,551 --> 00:43:29,870
pain is real,
it doesn't mean,

888
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:33,920
and like objects that we can all
perceive our real doesn't mean you

889
00:43:33,921 --> 00:43:35,720
should put them all in the same
category.

890
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:40,930
Like my dreams are not in the same
category of reality as this table

891
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,600
because you don't have access to my
dreams and you have access to the table.

892
00:43:44,601 --> 00:43:47,990
But that doesn't mean that my dreams and
my pains and my emotions aren't real.

893
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:50,330
They're real.
So that's the first now.

894
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:54,620
Or You should know that this is a,
this is a proposition.

895
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:00,280
What they're saying is let's act as if
that's true and then worked from those

896
00:44:01,251 --> 00:44:03,890
premises and see what happens,
see where we can get with it.

897
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,990
And that that's,
that's a perfectly reasonable thing to

898
00:44:05,991 --> 00:44:08,660
do because at the bottom of a theory,
you also have,

899
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,560
you always have to put an assumption
because otherwise your theory would be

900
00:44:12,561 --> 00:44:15,680
100% right and would cover everything
and it doesn't.

901
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:18,560
So you have to throw an assumption
somewhere in there at the bottom and

902
00:44:18,561 --> 00:44:18,981
say,
okay,

903
00:44:18,981 --> 00:44:20,870
we're not,
we're not questioning that.

904
00:44:20,871 --> 00:44:23,060
That's the starting point.
So,

905
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:26,000
and it,
you have to do that because you're

906
00:44:26,001 --> 00:44:27,650
ignorant.
You don't have a full theory.

907
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:33,120
So they don't like the idea that mind
can be reduced to matter.

908
00:44:33,121 --> 00:44:36,390
They're not playing that game.
They're not playing the game,

909
00:44:36,391 --> 00:44:39,840
that the subject is only up a phenomenal
and the object is real.

910
00:44:39,841 --> 00:44:42,690
They're not playing that game either.
And it's partly because,

911
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,240
as boss says,
without a subject,

912
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:49,950
nothing at all would exist to confront
objects and to imagine them as such.

913
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:52,740
True.
This implies that every object,

914
00:44:52,741 --> 00:44:56,460
everything objective is merely
objectively in being merely objectivize

915
00:44:56,461 --> 00:44:59,670
by the subject is the most subjective
thing possible.

916
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:03,780
It's a radical claim,
you know,

917
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,880
but here's,
here's something to think about it.

918
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,660
When I look at that,
coke can,

919
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:11,183
you might say,

920
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,610
hi,
perceive the object,

921
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:18,140
and then I make inferences about its use
and then I evaluate it and then I use

922
00:45:18,141 --> 00:45:18,681
it.
And you know,

923
00:45:18,681 --> 00:45:21,800
that is not actually what you do.
In fact,

924
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,980
it's not obvious at all that what you
perceive our objects.

925
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:26,870
And,
and if you think about it,

926
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:29,870
well,
people weren't perceiving scientific

927
00:45:29,871 --> 00:45:34,871
objects until like 1,514 50 so there was
no objective object before that.

928
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:44,020
So obviously whatever we were perceiving
was not precisely that because we would

929
00:45:44,911 --> 00:45:48,560
have been scientists right off the bat.
George Kelly claimed that people were

930
00:45:48,561 --> 00:45:51,410
natural scientists.
You know that we're always investigating

931
00:45:51,411 --> 00:45:53,720
hypothesis and trying to disprove them
and so on.

932
00:45:53,721 --> 00:45:56,570
And it's an interesting theory and that
it's right in a sense.

933
00:45:56,571 --> 00:46:00,260
But fundamentally it's wrong.
We are not natural scientists were

934
00:46:00,261 --> 00:46:03,290
natural engineers.
And when we look at the world,

935
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,750
we don't see objects.
And then in further use,

936
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:08,450
what we actually see is the use.

937
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,490
So for example,
when I look at that,

938
00:46:10,491 --> 00:46:14,120
coke can buy,
my visual system activates my motor

939
00:46:14,121 --> 00:46:17,210
cortex directly.
It can do that without me seeing the dam

940
00:46:17,211 --> 00:46:20,860
can consciously to some degree,
because there are people with blind

941
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,490
side,
I've told you about those people,

942
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:25,280
they say they can't see.
But if you asked them which hand do you

943
00:46:25,281 --> 00:46:27,110
have held up,
they can tell you.

944
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:31,850
So they might not be able to see.
But they can map patterns from their

945
00:46:31,851 --> 00:46:34,310
visual system onto their motor output,
you know?

946
00:46:34,311 --> 00:46:36,350
And that's basically what Piaget said we
do.

947
00:46:36,351 --> 00:46:39,680
When we deal with the world,
we're embodied creatures,

948
00:46:39,681 --> 00:46:41,960
you know?
And so what we see when we look around

949
00:46:41,961 --> 00:46:45,110
aren't objects.
They're things we can use and things

950
00:46:45,111 --> 00:46:47,270
that get in our way.
You know?

951
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:51,350
And that's the theory that was derived
originally from Jj Gibson who wrote a

952
00:46:51,351 --> 00:46:55,100
great book on that called the visual
approach to ecological ecological

953
00:46:55,101 --> 00:47:00,080
approach to visual perception.
And his science is a brand of pragmatism

954
00:47:00,081 --> 00:47:02,660
and the pragmatists basically claim that
you know,

955
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,770
things including theories and
perceptions have a limited range of

956
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:11,510
truth and the truth that that,
that the limited range of truth is

957
00:47:11,511 --> 00:47:15,110
determined by the match between your
actions and outcomes.

958
00:47:15,111 --> 00:47:18,290
So I think this is a coke can,
is that what it is?

959
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:20,690
No,
but it's good enough for me if I want to

960
00:47:20,691 --> 00:47:22,190
drink a bit of coke out of it.

961
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,430
God only knows what it is.
You know,

962
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:31,600
if you go into communist China and you
start advertising these things,

963
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:36,430
then what are they?
Cause this thing tells a story,

964
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:38,890
right?
What's the story like?

965
00:47:38,891 --> 00:47:40,420
Really?
Do you need Coca Cola?

966
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:43,480
No,
it's like it's a bit of Frippery,

967
00:47:43,481 --> 00:47:44,231
you know,
it's a bit of,

968
00:47:44,231 --> 00:47:47,320
it's not unnecessary luxury.
It's not even very good for you,

969
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:50,500
but it's kind of fuzzy and it's sweet
and you get to buy it.

970
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,220
And why is that?
Because no matter how stupid you are and

971
00:47:54,221 --> 00:47:57,490
your nutrition choices,
as far as our society goes,

972
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:02,380
you have the right to poison yourself in
whatever way you think best fits you.

973
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:06,610
And so when you send this little coke
can off to communist China,

974
00:48:06,611 --> 00:48:09,910
this thing screams stupid individuality
all over.

975
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:12,760
And God only knows how it undermines the
state.

976
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:14,020
You know?
And if you don't,

977
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:16,030
if you're not thinking about that,
you're not thinking.

978
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,700
Think about what happens when we export
cars.

979
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:20,350
What does the car say?

980
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:23,150
It says,
Hey,

981
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:26,100
you can go wherever you want,
whenever you want.

982
00:48:26,101 --> 00:48:29,370
You don't have to tell anybody at all
and you can do it in a really dangerous

983
00:48:29,371 --> 00:48:33,000
highspeed manner.
It's like you want a political

984
00:48:33,001 --> 00:48:35,790
statement,
wrap it up in metal and ship that thing

985
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:36,780
off.
And everybody goes,

986
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,000
oh,
I really liked to have one of those.

987
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:42,300
It's like poof,
communism disappears with that.

988
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:48,290
There's nothing that says individuality
and capitalism like a personal

989
00:48:48,571 --> 00:48:50,100
automobile.
You know,

990
00:48:50,101 --> 00:48:53,700
you even get to pollute the atmosphere
and ruin the planet with the damn thing.

991
00:48:53,701 --> 00:48:56,040
But you know,
if you have to drive to the corner store

992
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:58,980
and pick up your damn coke,
it's like to hell with the atmosphere.

993
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:05,880
So don't be thinking that the things
that appear in front of you are merely

994
00:49:05,881 --> 00:49:08,310
objects because they're not,
you know,

995
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:10,290
I started thinking about this,
for example,

996
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:14,640
when I was thinking about people going
down to Graceland to look at Elvis

997
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:15,160
Guitar.

998
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,370
You think
what exactly

999
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,080
is it that makes a good tart?
Elvis has guitar,

1000
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,720
you know,
it's not exactly the guitar

1001
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:27,830
cause it's just sitting there like any
old guitar,

1002
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:29,480
you know,
and maybe you could even think about it.

1003
00:49:29,481 --> 00:49:32,480
You could take that and guitar out and
he could put another guitar in that look

1004
00:49:32,481 --> 00:49:34,370
just like it.
And it would still be all of us as

1005
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:36,860
guitar cause no one would know.
And you might think,

1006
00:49:36,861 --> 00:49:39,530
well then that's not really,
Elvis has guitar.

1007
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:44,480
But that's a funny thing because you
would only think that if you thought

1008
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:47,630
that Elvis is guitar was the thing that
was made out of material that was

1009
00:49:47,631 --> 00:49:50,990
sitting right in front of you.
And that isn't what it is.

1010
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,450
That's the only one's tiny little bit of
it.

1011
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:57,830
That bloody thing is,
is a part of an incredibly layered

1012
00:49:57,831 --> 00:49:58,820
reality,
right?

1013
00:49:59,090 --> 00:49:59,923
I mean,

1014
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,490
okay,

1015
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:04,880
the people who want to go look at that,
they're looking at it in some sense

1016
00:50:04,881 --> 00:50:07,100
because of the magic that's emanating
from it.

1017
00:50:07,101 --> 00:50:09,380
But the magic is actually real.
You know,

1018
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:14,180
the magic is the effect of that guitar,
let's say on the entire culture.

1019
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:16,820
And those effects are the damn guitar
too.

1020
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:19,760
And it's weird because when you go look
at Elvis Guitar,

1021
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:22,910
you don't have looking at the guitar,
you're looking at the magic.

1022
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:26,060
And weirdly enough,
the magic is actually real.

1023
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:28,010
While can't think that way

1024
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:31,040
if you're a materialist because you
think that the thing is the material,

1025
00:50:31,041 --> 00:50:31,880
it's like,
yeah,

1026
00:50:31,881 --> 00:50:33,980
right.
I can tell you another story.

1027
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:38,450
So when the,
when the Europeans came to the South

1028
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:40,760
Pacific islands,
the South Pacific islanders,

1029
00:50:40,761 --> 00:50:43,800
because there weren't that many of them,
they didn't have a very high,

1030
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:45,560
highly technical society,
you know?

1031
00:50:45,561 --> 00:50:50,561
And so like if you were like Joe
Dominant guy in a Pacific island

1032
00:50:51,111 --> 00:50:53,150
culture,
you know you might be able to have a

1033
00:50:53,151 --> 00:50:55,960
stone ax,
like a wellmade stone ax because go out

1034
00:50:55,961 --> 00:50:58,220
and make a stone ax and see how long
that takes you.

1035
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:02,030
It's like that's a bit of work.
And so if you're a high status guy,

1036
00:51:02,031 --> 00:51:05,300
if you've really worked your whole life
to be at the top of your Damn pyramid,

1037
00:51:05,301 --> 00:51:07,430
you get,
maybe you get had two axes,

1038
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:08,960
you know,
it's like a red letter day.

1039
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:11,420
You've got two axes,
you know,

1040
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:14,390
which is more than any other animal has
by a lot.

1041
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:17,560
So it's not trivial.
And then the damn missionaries come in

1042
00:51:17,561 --> 00:51:20,270
and they,
and they set up shop and what do they

1043
00:51:20,271 --> 00:51:23,300
bring?
Steel access.

1044
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:26,570
It's like that's kind of a downer.
You know,

1045
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:30,140
you've worked your whole damn life to
get these stone axes and that makes you

1046
00:51:30,141 --> 00:51:34,040
like head tribesmen and then you want
your kid wanders down to the local

1047
00:51:34,041 --> 00:51:37,100
missionaries and they say,
oh we got an extra steel ax here.

1048
00:51:37,101 --> 00:51:39,320
Why don't you take that back home?
And it's like,

1049
00:51:39,321 --> 00:51:43,370
it's so shocking because not only did
the missionaries have this thing that is

1050
00:51:43,371 --> 00:51:47,450
so much better than a steel ax,
it's like a jet plane compared to a,

1051
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,250
to a wheeled cart.
Like they're really,

1052
00:51:51,251 --> 00:51:53,830
really different,
but the missionaries,

1053
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:57,220
they don't even notice.
That's the horrible thing about it.

1054
00:51:57,221 --> 00:51:59,650
It's like the giveaway,
this thing that hasn't virtually

1055
00:51:59,651 --> 00:52:01,240
infinite value and it's like,
well,

1056
00:52:01,241 --> 00:52:02,021
it's okay.
We got,

1057
00:52:02,021 --> 00:52:03,340
you know,
a couple dozen of those sitting in the

1058
00:52:03,341 --> 00:52:06,220
store room and you know,
we're just willing to hand them out.

1059
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:09,760
It was a little demoralizing.
It was a little demoralizing for the

1060
00:52:09,761 --> 00:52:14,380
Pacific islanders and so you know,
why was it an ax that the missionaries

1061
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,214
gave away?

1062
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:20,260
It wasn't.
You'd think that if you are a Westerner

1063
00:52:20,261 --> 00:52:21,730
and you had a bunch of access,
it's like,

1064
00:52:21,731 --> 00:52:22,630
yeah,
that's an ax.

1065
00:52:22,631 --> 00:52:23,201
It's like,
yeah,

1066
00:52:23,201 --> 00:52:25,480
right.
It's a lot more than an ax,

1067
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,090
a lot more.
It's a weapon to bring down a whole

1068
00:52:28,091 --> 00:52:33,091
culture accidentally.
One of the things that the

1069
00:52:37,431 --> 00:52:38,840
phenomenologists claimed,

1070
00:52:41,350 --> 00:52:43,480
this is a cool claim.
I didn't know they claimed this.

1071
00:52:43,481 --> 00:52:46,180
It took me quite a long time to figure
this out because I thought I'd figured

1072
00:52:46,181 --> 00:52:48,580
this out on my own,
but it turns out that's very difficult

1073
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,910
to figure out anything on your own.
Now,

1074
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,210
when I was doing my investigations into
how the brain works from a

1075
00:52:55,211 --> 00:52:58,630
neuropsychological perspective,
not was informed a lot by Jeffrey Gray,

1076
00:52:58,631 --> 00:53:03,340
who we're going to talk about later.
One of the things I noticed was that you

1077
00:53:03,341 --> 00:53:06,310
don't actually,
you don't actually see things when you

1078
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:08,620
first see something.
In fact,

1079
00:53:08,621 --> 00:53:10,900
when you first see something,
you don't even see it.

1080
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:15,460
You react to it.
You rock too with your body.

1081
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:17,970
So I can give you an example.
So you,

1082
00:53:17,971 --> 00:53:19,960
you're,
you have a partner and you have a

1083
00:53:19,961 --> 00:53:22,780
trusting relationship and then you find
out that they're,

1084
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:24,550
you know,
they tell you or you figure out from

1085
00:53:24,551 --> 00:53:27,690
their phone or something,
they're having an affair and you look at

1086
00:53:27,691 --> 00:53:29,990
them and you think,
well,

1087
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:30,883
what do you see?

1088
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:32,310
And you think you see,
well,

1089
00:53:32,311 --> 00:53:33,480
you see the person,
it's like,

1090
00:53:33,481 --> 00:53:34,200
no,
you don't.

1091
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:39,200
You do not see the person that's wrong.
What you see is a huge pit that you're

1092
00:53:39,931 --> 00:53:42,390
going to fall into and you don't even
know you see it,

1093
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:46,650
but your body knows that's your blood
pressure goes through the roof and your

1094
00:53:46,651 --> 00:53:50,940
heart starts to pound and you sweat.
And the reason for that is your body

1095
00:53:50,941 --> 00:53:54,810
sees what you can't see and what it sees
as something it's seriously does not

1096
00:53:54,811 --> 00:53:59,811
understand it does not understand it.
It sees the territory behind the map,

1097
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:01,950
right?
Because when I look at you,

1098
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,160
for all intents and purposes,
really what I'm looking at is my

1099
00:54:05,161 --> 00:54:08,220
presuppositions about you.
And because you're a polite and well

1100
00:54:08,221 --> 00:54:10,890
behaved,
you're gracious enough to act in

1101
00:54:10,891 --> 00:54:14,340
accordance with those presuppositions.
So I don't even really have to look at

1102
00:54:14,341 --> 00:54:14,730
you.

1103
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:18,540
And thank you very much for that because
it's very difficult to look at people

1104
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:22,200
because they're horrifying and profound
creatures.

1105
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:26,370
And so everybody walks around behaving.
So we don't terrify the hell out of each

1106
00:54:26,371 --> 00:54:29,580
other all the time.
Now when someone betrays you,

1107
00:54:29,581 --> 00:54:31,530
it's like Poof,
presuppositions gone.

1108
00:54:31,531 --> 00:54:32,700
Okay,
what's there?

1109
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:37,260
Well,
God only knows and that's what your body

1110
00:54:37,261 --> 00:54:39,120
reacts to.
And that's partly why the

1111
00:54:39,121 --> 00:54:43,260
phenomenologists said we react to
meaning first.

1112
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:47,550
We don't react to the object.
It takes a long time to see the damn

1113
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,170
object.
So for example,

1114
00:54:49,171 --> 00:54:51,660
let's say that your person has betrayed
you.

1115
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:55,920
Now you think you knew who they were and
you thought you knew who you were.

1116
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,210
Ha.
Guess what?

1117
00:54:57,390 --> 00:54:59,850
You're wrong.
You don't know who they are.

1118
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:03,210
And because you're such a moron,
that means you don't know who you are.

1119
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:06,300
And it means you can't trust any of your
memories with that person.

1120
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:09,540
And maybe none of your memories in any
intimate relationships at all.

1121
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:12,630
Plus what about the future?
Well,

1122
00:55:12,631 --> 00:55:14,670
so when you look at the person,
what do you see?

1123
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:16,740
You see all that.
It's like chaos,

1124
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:18,330
whack.
That's what you see.

1125
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:21,990
And that chaos is the meaning behind
your presuppositions.

1126
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:26,820
And that's why the phenomenologists
would say meaning shines forth.

1127
00:55:26,821 --> 00:55:28,800
That's famous thigh.
It shines forth.

1128
00:55:28,801 --> 00:55:30,960
And that's the primary thing we
encounter.

1129
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:34,200
It's like that smart.
And you know what's really weird?

1130
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:37,920
That's how your damn brain is organized.
And that's weird.

1131
00:55:37,921 --> 00:55:40,140
A because you think,
let's think about it.

1132
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:43,920
How do you define reality?
Now.

1133
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:47,820
That's a tough one.
So I would say most of you define

1134
00:55:47,821 --> 00:55:52,821
reality like you're Isaac Newton or
maybe like your democritus who was the

1135
00:55:52,921 --> 00:55:57,690
first person who hypothesized Adams.
And so in the Newtonian world,

1136
00:55:57,810 --> 00:55:59,640
it's like billiard ball world,
right?

1137
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:03,630
Everything is made out of little
billiard balls and they bang together in

1138
00:56:03,631 --> 00:56:07,110
a causal way and you can predict the
consequences of their banging together.

1139
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:10,380
And if you extend it enough,
you can conjure up an entirely

1140
00:56:10,381 --> 00:56:14,250
deterministic world.
A happens causes b because it's see

1141
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:18,540
always the same way and everything runs
like a giant clock.

1142
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:22,230
That's Newton's model and it's,
and it was a clock model because you

1143
00:56:22,231 --> 00:56:23,230
know,
back at that time,

1144
00:56:23,231 --> 00:56:23,981
clocks,
man,

1145
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:25,780
those things were pretty damn
impressive.

1146
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:28,720
Clocks got the whole industrial
revolution underway.

1147
00:56:28,721 --> 00:56:31,240
And you know,
medieval cities would put an awful lot

1148
00:56:31,241 --> 00:56:34,330
of time and work into their clocks and
they thought those damn things were

1149
00:56:34,331 --> 00:56:35,620
really cool.
You know,

1150
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:38,140
they could keep track of where the
planets were moving.

1151
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:40,330
It's like that's a big deal.
A clock.

1152
00:56:40,331 --> 00:56:43,000
And then if you want to think about an
invention that changed the world,

1153
00:56:43,001 --> 00:56:47,590
it's like the clock's a big one.
Now we can measure time in the same way.

1154
00:56:47,591 --> 00:56:50,200
Everyone can measure time.
It's a big deal.

1155
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,630
So the idea that the universe is like a
clock,

1156
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:55,780
given that the clock can predict the
universe,

1157
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,640
it's a pretty damn powerful idea.

1158
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:00,700
It turns out that it's wrong because you
know,

1159
00:57:00,701 --> 00:57:03,310
causalities a mass,
no one really understands it.

1160
00:57:03,311 --> 00:57:07,210
And there are levels of analysis that
which causality just in the way we

1161
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:09,760
experience it doesn't seem to imply it
apply at all.

1162
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:12,760
You go down to the subatomic level,
it's probabilistic.

1163
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:16,510
You can't predict single events.
And I don't believe that you can predict

1164
00:57:16,511 --> 00:57:19,240
the future.
You can predict parts of the future in

1165
00:57:19,241 --> 00:57:21,520
an extremely limited way for some
purposes,

1166
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:25,780
for some span of time that,
and you can't even predict how long that

1167
00:57:25,781 --> 00:57:28,000
span of time is going to last.
You know?

1168
00:57:28,001 --> 00:57:32,500
And some things seem to be more stable
across more situations and more times

1169
00:57:32,501 --> 00:57:34,540
than others,
but there's still,

1170
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:37,900
there's instability everywhere and it
makes it predicting things a very

1171
00:57:37,901 --> 00:57:40,390
difficult thing to do.
So,

1172
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:43,750
okay,
so that's one idea about reality.

1173
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:45,820
That's the idea really,
that you have,

1174
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:50,380
and that's the reality that you've been
educated to have the idea of reality.

1175
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:52,900
You've been educated to have,
even though we know it's wrong,

1176
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,220
like Einstein blue,
that world in the early 19 hundreds

1177
00:57:57,221 --> 00:57:59,710
along with the various people that
Einstein dependable,

1178
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:01,660
that's gone,
it's wrong.

1179
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:05,230
And then there's all sorts of other
extremely complicated problems like how

1180
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:07,810
to model positive feedback loops.
You know,

1181
00:58:07,811 --> 00:58:10,360
that sort of gets you into chaos theory
and it's really,

1182
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:12,460
really hard to model positive feedback
loops.

1183
00:58:12,461 --> 00:58:16,090
And they can go wild in 50 different
ways and you can't really predict them

1184
00:58:16,091 --> 00:58:19,450
because they depend on initial
conditions and so on and so forth.

1185
00:58:19,451 --> 00:58:22,780
So,
so the deterministic world,

1186
00:58:22,781 --> 00:58:23,321
it's like,
no,

1187
00:58:23,321 --> 00:58:25,630
that's wrong.
I think part of the reason we have to

1188
00:58:25,631 --> 00:58:28,840
have freewill is because we can't act
deterministically.

1189
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:31,390
You know,
a deterministic system is only going to

1190
00:58:31,391 --> 00:58:34,840
work in a system that stays the same,
you know,

1191
00:58:34,841 --> 00:58:37,390
so you can wind up a little clock,
you know,

1192
00:58:37,391 --> 00:58:39,820
one of those little clockwork toys and
it'll walk.

1193
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:42,160
But you know,
if you put a cliff in front of it,

1194
00:58:42,161 --> 00:58:45,580
just walks off the cliff.
So in cliffs are appearing in front of

1195
00:58:45,581 --> 00:58:48,760
us randomly all the time.
So I can't even see how a deterministic

1196
00:58:48,761 --> 00:58:52,480
system could possibly work to guide us.
It would assume that our knowledge,

1197
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:56,680
the knowledge that we derive from the
past is sufficiently accurate to

1198
00:58:56,681 --> 00:58:59,110
causally guide us into the future.
It's like,

1199
00:58:59,111 --> 00:59:00,820
no,
that's not right.

1200
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:04,300
It doesn't that maybe that's why we have
consciousness.

1201
00:59:04,301 --> 00:59:06,190
No one knows.
But that's a good theory.

1202
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:07,240
If there's a y

1203
00:59:09,210 --> 00:59:10,590
anyways,
here's an alternative.

1204
00:59:10,591 --> 00:59:12,900
The alternative,
this is a Darwinian alternative.

1205
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:14,370
So here's the alternative.

1206
00:59:16,610 --> 00:59:20,240
The world's a complex and dynamic place.
It's full of weird things.

1207
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,850
Musically.
It's made up of patterns.

1208
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:27,110
It's made up a patterns and patterns of
patterns and patterns and patterns of

1209
00:59:27,111 --> 00:59:28,790
patterns.
And that's what it is.

1210
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:33,530
And they shift and dance around and then
you throw something that's alive into

1211
00:59:33,531 --> 00:59:35,010
that.
It's,

1212
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:39,500
it's programmed by DNA and the damn
thing has to keep up with the patterns

1213
00:59:39,501 --> 00:59:41,870
and they're changing all the time.
Some of them are kind of stable,

1214
00:59:41,871 --> 00:59:46,280
but they're pretty damn fluid.
So then you throw the DNA in there and

1215
00:59:46,281 --> 00:59:51,281
it goes and produces a million variants
of whatever it's going to produce.

1216
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:53,750
And most of them are wrong.
So you're a mosquito,

1217
00:59:53,751 --> 00:59:55,760
you lay a million lay eggs.
It's like,

1218
00:59:55,761 --> 01:00:00,761
so that's a million
bets about how the future will causally

1219
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:05,280
unfold and the bed is the future's going
to unfold.

1220
01:00:05,281 --> 01:00:08,310
So this egg can turn into a mosquito.
And so then you might say,

1221
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:11,520
well how often is the mosquito that lays
the eggs wrong?

1222
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:15,600
And the answer to that is if it,
if it lays a million eggs in its

1223
01:00:15,601 --> 01:00:17,700
lifetime,
I don't know how many eggs mosquitoes

1224
01:00:17,701 --> 01:00:18,960
late,
but they lay a lot.

1225
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:22,560
All of those eggs are going to die
except one

1226
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:27,350
if the mosquitoes lucky.
And you know that because we're knee

1227
01:00:27,351 --> 01:00:28,670
deep and mosquitoes,
right?

1228
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:30,470
If,
if it wasn't the case,

1229
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:32,960
then there just be mosquitoes everywhere
and there aren't.

1230
01:00:32,961 --> 01:00:34,820
Thank God there's enough of the damn
things.

1231
01:00:34,821 --> 01:00:38,000
But you know,
so basically what's the bet?

1232
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:43,090
The bet is mosquito matches environment
answer wrong except once in a million.

1233
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:46,790
So how do you overcome that million
mosquitoes,

1234
01:00:46,791 --> 01:00:48,830
million eggs.
And it'll do the trick.

1235
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:50,910
And so look,
that's so interesting.

1236
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,310
A,
because it means the fundamental

1237
01:00:52,311 --> 01:00:57,311
hypothesis that the mosquito structure
matches the structure of reality is

1238
01:00:57,321 --> 01:01:02,321
wrong at a one in a million.
It's wrong at a 999,999 level of error.

1239
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:08,900
You might just think that's just
completely wrong.

1240
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:10,070
You know,
that's really wrong,

1241
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:12,950
but it keeps the damn mosquitoes going.
Okay,

1242
01:01:12,951 --> 01:01:16,700
so then this propagates across time.
You know,

1243
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,350
and what really propagates across time
is a massive wave of death.

1244
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:26,480
Virtually everything fails.
99.9% of the species that ever lived are

1245
01:01:26,481 --> 01:01:27,800
extinct.
It's something like that,

1246
01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:29,390
you know?
And we're doing a fairly good job of

1247
01:01:29,391 --> 01:01:32,630
making sure that a good chunk of the
ones that exist now we're going to go

1248
01:01:32,631 --> 01:01:33,740
extinct.
You know?

1249
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:37,430
So failure and death is the norm and
it's going to happen to all of you.

1250
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:43,800
So
if the underlying structure of reality

1251
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:47,640
is mutable,
which it is,

1252
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:54,130
and the only way that you can adapt to
it is by generating variance and having

1253
01:01:54,131 --> 01:01:57,850
most of them perish except for the ones
that manage more or less by chance to

1254
01:01:57,851 --> 01:02:00,070
keep up.
How do you define real?

1255
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:02,980
And a darwinist would say,
and this would a pragmatist would say

1256
01:02:02,981 --> 01:02:03,814
too,

1257
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:11,580
you embody real to the best degree that
real can be attained.

1258
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:15,760
And it's not very good.
Your reel is only good enough for about

1259
01:02:15,761 --> 01:02:18,280
80 years.
But you know what else they would say is

1260
01:02:18,281 --> 01:02:22,260
that's as real as gets the,
the whatever reality is,

1261
01:02:22,261 --> 01:02:27,261
it's so damn complicated.
This multilayered pattern array that you

1262
01:02:29,281 --> 01:02:31,830
can't even model it without using death
as the,

1263
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:33,930
as the,
as the mechanism.

1264
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:37,350
You can't do it.
And even if he dual use death,

1265
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:40,950
it's almost all death.
And even for the parts that aren't

1266
01:02:40,951 --> 01:02:43,020
death,
which is hardly any of it,

1267
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,100
your damn solution isn't that good.
You know,

1268
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,270
you're going to wear out in 80 years.
That's,

1269
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:50,700
you got 3 billion years of trying behind
you.

1270
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:53,220
That's the best you can do 80 damn
years.

1271
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:54,810
You know,
maybe if you're a parrot,

1272
01:02:54,811 --> 01:02:58,390
you can get a 150 and apparently there's
somebody mortal jellyfish,

1273
01:02:58,410 --> 01:03:01,710
which fingers would be the damn
jellyfish that would be a mortal.

1274
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,260
So real might,
you know,

1275
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:06,540
that's a whole different way about
thinking about real.

1276
01:03:06,541 --> 01:03:07,081
Now,
you know,

1277
01:03:07,081 --> 01:03:09,810
Nisha said life is truth.
Truth serves life,

1278
01:03:09,811 --> 01:03:11,880
sorry.
And that's a Darwinian id.

1279
01:03:11,881 --> 01:03:13,410
Even though he didn't take it from
Darwin.

1280
01:03:13,411 --> 01:03:18,411
It's like there isn't anything more true
than what evolution reveals as the model

1281
01:03:19,321 --> 01:03:22,830
for reality.
That's as true as it gets for us.

1282
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:27,750
And that's not a Newtonian reality.
It's a multilevel pattern,

1283
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:31,500
chaotic reality that we're trying to
keep up with.

1284
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:34,470
And that's real.
And so what that might mean is that,

1285
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:37,653
okay,

1286
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:42,470
the implications for action that I
derived from that phenomena

1287
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:48,820
might be more indicative of what it is.
Then an objective analysis,

1288
01:03:49,990 --> 01:03:54,510
because your truth is the degree to
which you,

1289
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:59,530
you embody truth in so far as it can be
determined within a Darwinian framework

1290
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:04,810
is entirely measured by your success in
living in propagating.

1291
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:07,780
And that's it.
There isn't anything under that.

1292
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:09,040
Now.
Maybe there is,

1293
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:11,050
but if you're a Darwinian,
that's it.

1294
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:14,890
And I think Darwin's right,
all things considered and Newton is

1295
01:04:14,891 --> 01:04:17,380
wrong.
Plus we also know that Newton is wrong.

1296
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:20,950
Now the whole Darwinian thing is more
complicated than we thought because you,

1297
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:21,880
you know,
you've run,

1298
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:25,570
do you know what epigenetics are?
How many of you know about that?

1299
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:27,340
Well,
that's pretty good.

1300
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:31,210
So your biological education,
like demolishes your historical

1301
01:04:31,211 --> 01:04:33,160
education,
how many people don't know what

1302
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:35,080
epigenetics is?
It's okay.

1303
01:04:35,081 --> 01:04:37,150
It's just relatively new.
Anyways.

1304
01:04:37,151 --> 01:04:41,320
It turns out that your parents
experience can alter their genetic

1305
01:04:41,321 --> 01:04:44,110
structure in such a way that it alters
your genetic structure.

1306
01:04:44,410 --> 01:04:45,670
It's like,
oh,

1307
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:48,820
that's something we didn't expect that
that's for sure.

1308
01:04:48,821 --> 01:04:50,800
And nobody knows what the final,
you know,

1309
01:04:50,801 --> 01:04:54,160
consequences of that will be.
But it looks like there's more to the

1310
01:04:54,161 --> 01:04:59,161
evolutionary story than mere random
production and natural selection.

1311
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:02,500
There's more to it than that.
Who knows how much.

1312
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,270
So anyways,
when the,

1313
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:08,470
when the phenomenologists say we react
to meaning first,

1314
01:05:09,010 --> 01:05:10,570
that kind of opens a question.
It's like,

1315
01:05:10,571 --> 01:05:11,350
well,
is that,

1316
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:14,230
is the meaning real?
And that opens is another question,

1317
01:05:14,231 --> 01:05:19,090
which is what do you mean by real?
And then that opens another question is

1318
01:05:19,091 --> 01:05:19,741
like,
well,

1319
01:05:19,741 --> 01:05:23,440
is it Newton real or is it Darwin real
well,

1320
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:25,900
Newton's wrong.
That leaves Darwin

1321
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:30,790
and Darwin Real.
That's about as real as it gets.

1322
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:33,460
In fact,
that might be as real as it gets.

1323
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:36,850
You know,
if a partial entity is trying to model a

1324
01:05:36,851 --> 01:05:40,360
complex totality,
all they're ever going to be able to do

1325
01:05:40,361 --> 01:05:44,410
is embody a partial representation of
that and it's not going to be that good,

1326
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:46,600
but it's going to be as good as they can
get.

1327
01:05:47,470 --> 01:05:52,450
And that's as true as it can get.
So the phenomenologists,

1328
01:05:52,451 --> 01:05:54,370
you know,
they have this weird idea we perceive

1329
01:05:54,371 --> 01:05:55,204
meaning.
It's like,

1330
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:57,640
guess what?
That's how your brain is set up.

1331
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:01,060
You first perceive meaning and then with
a lot of work,

1332
01:06:01,061 --> 01:06:04,810
you turn that into an object perception.
Christ God only knows how much

1333
01:06:04,811 --> 01:06:06,910
exploration you have to do before you do
that.

1334
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:10,630
You know how long you think it takes a
child to handle?

1335
01:06:10,631 --> 01:06:14,680
It's,
it's a soother before it builds up an

1336
01:06:14,681 --> 01:06:17,410
accurate representation of the soother.

1337
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:19,900
You know it's going to be chewing on
that thing like mad.

1338
01:06:19,901 --> 01:06:21,760
It's going to be taking a note and
checking it out,

1339
01:06:21,830 --> 01:06:26,050
turning it around and banging it against
things and it has to do all of that

1340
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:31,090
including the tac kyle interaction and
the experimentation with the thing

1341
01:06:31,091 --> 01:06:33,850
across situations to establish say
object permanence.

1342
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,880
It has to do all that before it can see
the thing.

1343
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:43,230
You know like early Iei in early ai
researchers who were basically under the

1344
01:06:44,081 --> 01:06:49,081
influence of behaviorists who basically
said the object is given and so they

1345
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:51,430
could treat the brain like it didn't
even exist.

1346
01:06:51,431 --> 01:06:54,100
You know the objects just there,
you can just see the world.

1347
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:56,320
It's like that turned out to be
seriously wrong.

1348
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:59,110
It's damn difficult to get a computer to
see the world.

1349
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:00,850
Now.
It turns out you have to put the bloody

1350
01:07:00,851 --> 01:07:04,570
things inside bodies before they could
even do it because you really can't

1351
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:09,630
perceive the world without a body
because perception is for bodily action

1352
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:14,170
and without the framework within which
cause really what you're doing and this

1353
01:07:14,171 --> 01:07:17,080
is a Ph Yeti and idea to this is a
pattern,

1354
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:19,140
this thing.
And then I'm,

1355
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:23,110
the pattern exists at multiple levels,
including say the advertising level and

1356
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:25,660
your memories of coke and all the bloody
jingles,

1357
01:07:25,661 --> 01:07:26,650
you know,
and all that.

1358
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:29,230
But this,
when I look at that,

1359
01:07:29,290 --> 01:07:33,190
I map it's pattern onto my retina.
And the pattern is a pattern because

1360
01:07:33,191 --> 01:07:34,810
it's extending across time,
right?

1361
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:37,510
So it's not like smoke,
it's not just dissipating.

1362
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:39,400
There it is.
It's staying there across time.

1363
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:43,870
I map that onto my retina and the retina
matches it onto my hand.

1364
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:47,320
That's the coke can.
And actually the coke can is all of

1365
01:07:47,321 --> 01:07:48,154
this.

1366
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:55,250
And you might say that's not what it is
because it's made of aluminum.

1367
01:07:55,251 --> 01:07:55,881
It's like,
yeah,

1368
01:07:55,881 --> 01:08:00,881
yeah it's made out of aluminum.
But that's only one part of what it is.

1369
01:08:00,981 --> 01:08:03,800
And it's not necessarily even the most
important part cause it could be made

1370
01:08:03,801 --> 01:08:05,960
out of plastic and you know,
what the hell difference would that

1371
01:08:05,961 --> 01:08:07,220
make?
You know?

1372
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:11,450
So,
so it's pretty damn weird when you start

1373
01:08:11,451 --> 01:08:14,990
to think about it because people make
the claim that meaning is EPA.

1374
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:18,410
It's like there's no real meaning of the
universe is this dead thing.

1375
01:08:18,590 --> 01:08:20,810
And if we all went to extinguished,
you know,

1376
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:25,930
tomorrow they're just be a bunch of
meaningless marbles rotating in space.

1377
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:29,390
Well first of all,
even that's not true because God only

1378
01:08:29,391 --> 01:08:31,640
knows what's out there if there's
nothing to perceive it.

1379
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:34,280
You know,
the physicists tell us it's more like a

1380
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:37,850
vast potential fluctuating quantum
field.

1381
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,920
You know?
And maybe it doesn't even turn into

1382
01:08:39,921 --> 01:08:42,470
stars and planets until there's someone
to look at it.

1383
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:45,230
You know?
And you might think that's ridiculous.

1384
01:08:45,231 --> 01:08:48,290
But if you think about it for a while,
you'll see that there's really something

1385
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:49,400
to it.
You know,

1386
01:08:49,401 --> 01:08:52,820
because you are the thing that specifies
the level of analysis,

1387
01:08:53,210 --> 01:08:54,830
right?
You know,

1388
01:08:55,250 --> 01:08:57,350
the way you look at the world,
you don't see the atoms,

1389
01:08:57,380 --> 01:09:00,470
you don't see the subatomic particles,
you don't see the little rocks.

1390
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:04,100
You see planet sized things.
When you look out into space and you

1391
01:09:04,101 --> 01:09:06,050
know,
you see it at a particular slice of

1392
01:09:06,051 --> 01:09:07,490
time.
That's part of,

1393
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:11,390
maybe your refresh rate is something
like 60 hertz.

1394
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:16,750
So what you see is the universe sliced
into 60 hertz slices and you think

1395
01:09:17,331 --> 01:09:18,470
that's real.
It's like,

1396
01:09:18,471 --> 01:09:19,140
yeah,
yeah.

1397
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:23,870
So was all the rest of it,
including its huge expanse of time from

1398
01:09:23,871 --> 01:09:24,770
beginning to end.

1399
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:27,110
You don't see any of that.
It's there.

1400
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,130
So what's there?
All those things at the same time and

1401
01:09:31,131 --> 01:09:34,970
what does all that add up to?
The physicists seem to be telling us

1402
01:09:34,971 --> 01:09:39,410
that adds up to a pool of quantum
potential that isn't realized until

1403
01:09:39,411 --> 01:09:41,960
there's something that conscious,
it's conscious that interacts with it.

1404
01:09:42,230 --> 01:09:43,580
It's like,
who knows?

1405
01:09:44,510 --> 01:09:48,760
Now you've got your meaning shining
forth like mad.

1406
01:09:48,761 --> 01:09:51,980
And I think part of the reason that
children are so attractive is because

1407
01:09:52,190 --> 01:09:54,680
for them the meaning is just shining at
them.

1408
01:09:54,681 --> 01:09:56,720
Like Matt.
That's why they're always wandering

1409
01:09:56,721 --> 01:09:57,770
around like this,
you know?

1410
01:09:57,771 --> 01:10:01,700
And it's really fun to watch kids
because they give you a taste of that

1411
01:10:01,701 --> 01:10:02,361
again,
you know,

1412
01:10:02,361 --> 01:10:05,030
because kids have to pay you so you
don't throw them out the window because

1413
01:10:05,031 --> 01:10:06,110
they're very annoying.
Right.

1414
01:10:06,111 --> 01:10:08,330
They're always crying,
they're completely useless.

1415
01:10:08,331 --> 01:10:10,160
They just lay there and they don't do
anything,

1416
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:11,840
you know,
and they wake you up at three in the

1417
01:10:11,841 --> 01:10:12,890
morning and annoy you.

1418
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:14,330
And so,
you know,

1419
01:10:14,331 --> 01:10:17,720
because you're selfish and mean you need
some something in return and so they

1420
01:10:17,721 --> 01:10:19,880
smile at you and,
but they do other things.

1421
01:10:19,881 --> 01:10:20,750
They're really,
really,

1422
01:10:20,751 --> 01:10:21,471
really,
really,

1423
01:10:21,471 --> 01:10:24,860
really comical.
So there are a blast to watch and play

1424
01:10:24,861 --> 01:10:26,900
with.
But one of the things they really do is

1425
01:10:26,901 --> 01:10:30,140
they,
they remove the blinders from you while

1426
01:10:30,141 --> 01:10:31,340
you're around them.
Cause you know,

1427
01:10:31,341 --> 01:10:34,610
you go out and like a little forest with
a two and a half year olds,

1428
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,760
very annoying cause the bloody things,
they just wander around randomly,

1429
01:10:37,761 --> 01:10:40,400
you know?
So you've got no goal directed,

1430
01:10:40,730 --> 01:10:43,730
nothing goal directed is going to happen
with the two and a half year old.

1431
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:47,270
But that's kind of cool because it frees
your mind from your goal directed

1432
01:10:47,271 --> 01:10:50,750
narrowness and you can watch the two
year old look at all these things that

1433
01:10:50,751 --> 01:10:53,480
you haven't looked at for 20 years
because you already looked at them once

1434
01:10:53,481 --> 01:10:56,300
and now you just have to see your memory
and then you think,

1435
01:10:56,810 --> 01:10:58,250
wow,
that really is cool.

1436
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,660
You know,
they'll bring you something and they'll

1437
01:10:59,661 --> 01:11:01,190
tell you what's cool.
And you know,

1438
01:11:01,191 --> 01:11:04,340
maybe it's a shiny piece of aluminum of
gum wrapper,

1439
01:11:04,341 --> 01:11:07,970
what you think it's a gum wrapper
because that's what you see when you

1440
01:11:07,971 --> 01:11:09,980
look at it.
Because you've already built up gum

1441
01:11:09,981 --> 01:11:12,470
wrapper representation and you just lay
it on that.

1442
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,040
That isn't,
the kid sees,

1443
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:16,260
God only knows what they're looking at.
You know,

1444
01:11:16,410 --> 01:11:19,890
maybe how the light reflects off the
aluminum prismatic Lee and how it

1445
01:11:19,891 --> 01:11:23,610
glitters and how cool it is that it can
be folded up and how light it is.

1446
01:11:23,611 --> 01:11:26,310
It's like,
and they're looking at it like this and

1447
01:11:26,311 --> 01:11:28,230
you know,
I think it's because their cortex isn't

1448
01:11:28,231 --> 01:11:31,800
very well developed and they haven't
built the inhibitory structures that

1449
01:11:31,801 --> 01:11:35,340
stopped them from seeing meaning shining
forth.

1450
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:36,480
You know,
and you might think,

1451
01:11:36,481 --> 01:11:37,980
well,
is there any evidence for that?

1452
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:40,410
And there actually is quite a bit of
evidence for that.

1453
01:11:40,411 --> 01:11:41,520
You know,
I mean,

1454
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:48,210
one piece of evidence is that if you
take a cats brain off out and you just

1455
01:11:48,211 --> 01:11:50,490
leave it with the hypothalamus and the
spinal cord,

1456
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:53,700
it's hyper exploratory.
It runs around like everything's

1457
01:11:53,701 --> 01:11:56,070
interesting.
It's pretty weird behavior for a thing

1458
01:11:56,071 --> 01:11:57,840
that doesn't have a brain,
you know,

1459
01:11:57,841 --> 01:12:00,390
you kind of think that once you don't
have a brain,

1460
01:12:00,391 --> 01:12:04,170
nothing would be interesting.
It depends on how much of your brain you

1461
01:12:04,171 --> 01:12:06,210
have.
And there are people who've experienced

1462
01:12:06,211 --> 01:12:07,044
that.
By the way,

1463
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:12,080
there was a famous case of a conductor
who had a very serious brain injury and

1464
01:12:12,421 --> 01:12:17,160
it basically blew out his hippocampus so
he couldn't put any more information

1465
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:19,410
from short term attention to longterm
storage.

1466
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:21,900
And he wrote these articles,
these,

1467
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:26,960
these massive page long journals,
multipage long journals and only,

1468
01:12:27,121 --> 01:12:30,270
right is it,
is that is if I'm seeing everything for

1469
01:12:30,271 --> 01:12:33,180
the first time,
it's as if I'm seeing everything for the

1470
01:12:33,181 --> 01:12:34,014
first time.

1471
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,210
It's as if I'm seeing everything for the
first time.

1472
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:38,850
And he was wandering around in a
constant state of awe,

1473
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:40,680
you know,
and his wife would come to visit him.

1474
01:12:40,681 --> 01:12:42,720
He couldn't remember any of the things
that had happened to him.

1475
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,450
And he'd just be blown out of the water
to see her,

1476
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:47,850
you know,
because he didn't see his memories and

1477
01:12:47,851 --> 01:12:49,710
he'd say,
it's just like I'm seeing you for the

1478
01:12:49,711 --> 01:12:50,880
first time.
And you know,

1479
01:12:50,881 --> 01:12:53,370
he was,
he was seeing her for the first time

1480
01:12:53,730 --> 01:12:56,280
because the,
the access to the inhibitory structures

1481
01:12:56,281 --> 01:12:58,200
that were directing his attention were
gone.

1482
01:12:58,830 --> 01:13:00,720
He was an interesting case too,
because now,

1483
01:13:00,721 --> 01:13:02,760
and then he'd sit down to play the
piano,

1484
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:05,400
you know,
and he'd have an epileptic seizure and

1485
01:13:05,401 --> 01:13:08,520
then he could play the piano and he
could play just like he used to play,

1486
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:11,130
you know,
so it was like he had to switch brain

1487
01:13:11,131 --> 01:13:13,560
modes and the mechanism for switching
was damaged.

1488
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:16,500
So we'd have to have a little seizure.
And then he could lay out these,

1489
01:13:16,501 --> 01:13:21,480
like Beethoven Sonata is like a mad dog.
And then at the end he'd have a little

1490
01:13:21,481 --> 01:13:24,630
seizure and he'd come back to,
it's as if I'm seeing everything for the

1491
01:13:24,631 --> 01:13:26,160
first time,
you know?

1492
01:13:26,161 --> 01:13:29,520
And I think part of the reason that
psychedelic drugs proved so attractive

1493
01:13:29,521 --> 01:13:33,030
to people in the 60s and improved
attractive to people since the bloody

1494
01:13:33,031 --> 01:13:36,390
beginning of time is because in some
sense that's what they do.

1495
01:13:36,690 --> 01:13:39,630
It's like Poof,
you're a memory representations.

1496
01:13:39,810 --> 01:13:42,750
They're gone and what are you seeing?
God only knows,

1497
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:46,350
but it isn't what you expect.
And maybe it's what's there.

1498
01:13:47,310 --> 01:13:48,390
Well,
maybe not too.

1499
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:54,663
Wow.

1500
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:03,520
All right,
so I'm going to sum this up a little

1501
01:14:03,521 --> 01:14:08,521
bit.
What do you think drives to extreme

1502
01:14:12,191 --> 01:14:15,520
forms of pathology now that might be
your pathology,

1503
01:14:15,521 --> 01:14:17,290
your misery,
your suffering and all that,

1504
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:20,530
or it might be your social
psychopathology,

1505
01:14:20,531 --> 01:14:23,230
which is your murderous desire to
exterminate.

1506
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:27,640
Okay,
well here's a phenomenological theory.

1507
01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:35,390
The terror management theory is that you
got to build these structures in your

1508
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:37,910
head to get yourself away from death
anxiety,

1509
01:14:37,911 --> 01:14:39,770
right?
And so really what the terror management

1510
01:14:39,771 --> 01:14:42,440
people are saying is the blinder you are
the better.

1511
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:45,530
And that's what the pause disillusion
people think too.

1512
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:47,240
Now,
the phenomenologists,

1513
01:14:47,241 --> 01:14:48,890
they were going at this from another
direction.

1514
01:14:48,891 --> 01:14:53,030
They were saying
the meaning that constantly reveals

1515
01:14:53,031 --> 01:14:56,690
itself is nourishing and revitalizing.
Although it's so powerful,

1516
01:14:56,691 --> 01:15:00,770
it can just blow you apart.
So it's a dangerous thing to be messing

1517
01:15:00,771 --> 01:15:04,230
with.
It's like the burning Bush and you,

1518
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:07,370
you have to build this structure in
order to be able to cope with that

1519
01:15:07,371 --> 01:15:09,980
because you have to minimize it to what
you can handle.

1520
01:15:10,430 --> 01:15:12,470
But you need to build a structure
properly,

1521
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:16,160
properly,
and carefully so that the meaning that

1522
01:15:16,161 --> 01:15:21,161
reveals itself can be shaped by you into
a world conceptual and practical.

1523
01:15:22,010 --> 01:15:26,120
That allows the remaining meaning to
shine through in a way that you find

1524
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:31,240
sufficiently revitalizing so that you
don't become corrupt enough to become

1525
01:15:32,061 --> 01:15:37,061
genocidal.
Now that's a good theory and that's what

1526
01:15:37,461 --> 01:15:40,340
what the phenomenologists were on about.
And that's part of the reason why the

1527
01:15:40,341 --> 01:15:43,520
existentialists and the phenomenal,
I'll just say,

1528
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:49,540
don't deceive yourself about what
manifests itself to you.

1529
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:54,200
Don't use language instrumentally.
Why?

1530
01:15:55,010 --> 01:15:59,900
Because if you do that and twist up the
structures that you're using to

1531
01:15:59,901 --> 01:16:03,500
interpret the world through the world
will twist up on you.

1532
01:16:03,710 --> 01:16:06,200
And all live will be revealed is it's
harder.

1533
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:10,970
And if horror is all that's always being
revealed to you,

1534
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:14,540
you will not stay good.

1535
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:16,220
Yeah.

1536
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:18,750
Cause you can't,
under that sort of pressure,

1537
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:23,930
you'll get bitter and resentful and
everything will fall apart around you

1538
01:16:24,301 --> 01:16:29,301
because you're not actually modeling the
reality in a way that the positive

1539
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:32,760
meaning can shine through.
So you'll fail and you'll become

1540
01:16:32,761 --> 01:16:36,570
resentful and you'll become bitter.
And then you'll be looking for someone

1541
01:16:36,571 --> 01:16:40,200
to hurt and you'll have plenty of
justification for it.

1542
01:16:41,370 --> 01:16:44,670
So and worse,
and this is union contribution to this

1543
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:47,760
whole idea.
This won't happen all at once.

1544
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:52,920
It'll happen as a consequence of 100,000
micro decisions that you hardly even

1545
01:16:52,921 --> 01:16:57,921
notice where you can be truthful about
something or not in this tiny way that

1546
01:16:58,201 --> 01:17:02,160
hardly even seems to matter.
But that the consequence of iterating

1547
01:17:02,161 --> 01:17:06,480
that across time,
say 300,000 decisions is that you can

1548
01:17:06,481 --> 01:17:10,040
build yourself into the sort of monster
that you would never want to see in the

1549
01:17:10,041 --> 01:17:12,230
mirror.
And one of the things that

1550
01:17:12,231 --> 01:17:15,710
phenomenologists would also tell you,
and this is something you said as well,

1551
01:17:15,711 --> 01:17:19,400
is that is the sort of monster that you
probably are.

1552
01:17:20,270 --> 01:17:24,740
And so if you want to deal with that,
you have to start taking things

1553
01:17:24,741 --> 01:17:26,750
seriously.
And one of the things,

1554
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:30,740
there's two things you have to take
seriously and one is the meaning that

1555
01:17:30,741 --> 01:17:34,580
reveals itself to you.
And the other is the stance of truth

1556
01:17:34,581 --> 01:17:39,140
towards which you were pro,
the stance of truth that you adopt while

1557
01:17:39,141 --> 01:17:43,580
you're interacting with that meaning.
And the final consequence of that would

1558
01:17:43,581 --> 01:17:47,240
be your health,
the health of your family and your

1559
01:17:47,241 --> 01:17:50,960
society and the health of the entire
society at large.

1560
01:17:52,250 --> 01:17:54,980
Pivots on that.
It pivots on that.

1561
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:59,180
And that the way the world moves is a
sum total of all the decisions that are

1562
01:17:59,181 --> 01:18:02,720
all of us are making all those little
micro decisions and those bloody things

1563
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:07,670
echo like ripples in a pond.
And so when you do some little crooked

1564
01:18:07,671 --> 01:18:09,620
thing that you know you shouldn't be
doing,

1565
01:18:09,950 --> 01:18:12,680
you're actually warping the entire
structure of reality.

1566
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:16,730
And what's really interesting about that
is now we know what happens when you do

1567
01:18:16,731 --> 01:18:20,300
that.
What happens is that we end up with the

1568
01:18:20,301 --> 01:18:22,910
Nazis and the communists in the hydrogen
bombs,

1569
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:27,620
and we haven't escaped from that yet,
and hopefully we will,

1570
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,320
but we won't.
If people don't learn what the 20th

1571
01:18:30,321 --> 01:18:31,490
century had to teach them,

1572
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:36,693
that's that.

1573
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:37,570
Okay.
