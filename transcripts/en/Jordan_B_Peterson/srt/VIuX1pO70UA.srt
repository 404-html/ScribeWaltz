1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,050
Okay.
So there's this,

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,750
there's this spirit of good,
let's say,

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,123
and what the spirit of good does is act 
in the world on the potential of the 

4
00:00:08,401 --> 00:00:11,460
world to generate the actuality of the 
world.

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,870
And the Judeo Christian proposition is,
is that if you confront the potential of

6
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:19,350
the world with good in mind,
using truth,

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,300
truthful communication,
then the order that you extract is good.

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:25,703
And then that's echoed in genesis when 
God is using the word and he creates 

9
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:31,560
cosmos out of potential.
And every time he does that,

10
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:33,240
he says,
and it was good.

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,533
Which is,
I think it's so interesting because 

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,863
there's a proposition there and the 
proposition there is that if you 

13
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:43,050
encounter potential with truth,
the cosmos you create is actually good.

14
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,243
Well,
that's,

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,920
that's just an absolutely overwhelming 
idea.

16
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,200
It's like if it's true,
and if it's true,

17
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:50,800
it's the greatest idea there ever was.
