1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,520
These are stopping Jordan Peterson.

2
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:05,683
Thank.
Are there differences between men and 

3
00:00:16,631 --> 00:00:18,690
women?
Yes.

4
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:19,760
Perfect.

5
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,203
So the first thing I've noticed,
and I actually mentioned this at the 

6
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,000
University of Toronto,
the baby with someone who was

7
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,353
thinking about this for quite a while 
and there was an overwhelming majority 

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,120
of men in the room at the University of 
Toronto and if you look around

9
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:45,663
you'll see that it's probably running,
I wouldn't say about 1910 and that's 

10
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:54,690
remarkable because there are more women 
than men in universities now and so it's

11
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:58,730
been quite interesting to me to see the 
public parks.

12
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,130
The vast majority of people are also the
people that are watching on youtube.

13
00:01:03,131 --> 00:01:08,131
It's about 90 10 as well.
I'm not exactly sure why that is.

14
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,870
Although I think maybe that nobody is 
actually speaking to,

15
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,200
you know,
maybe I'm doing a bit of that and I will

16
00:01:17,201 --> 00:01:18,034
say that's probably also really good for
women because men aren't doing very 

17
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:21,994
well.
You can be sure that women aren't going 

18
00:01:22,841 --> 00:01:26,740
to do very well because as it turns out,
you actually meet each other.

19
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,410
So anyways,
I don't need to start again.

20
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,543
I guess talking about bills,
she's 16 and I know I made some videos 

21
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:36,634
back at the end of September.
I suppose most people you know that one 

22
00:01:39,851 --> 00:01:44,230
of them,
unless I'm expressing my concern about a

23
00:01:44,231 --> 00:01:45,064
piece of legislation at the federal 
level called Bill Sixteen and it was 

24
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,723
boring to do,
was to add gender expression and gender 

25
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:54,510
identity to the list of protected 
groups,

26
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:55,903
predictability to the relevant human 
rights legislation and also making it 

27
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:01,354
harassment and discrimination,
something intentionally addressable 

28
00:02:04,691 --> 00:02:05,524
under the hate crimes,
permission of the criminal code on a 

29
00:02:08,861 --> 00:02:09,694
surface of it very skirt,
shorter bill wasn't turns out on the 

30
00:02:12,971 --> 00:02:16,510
surface it looks,
although it's very bad with formula,

31
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,020
the first major errors of course the 
gender expression,

32
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:20,883
which is fundamentally fashion choices 
defined onto her human rights 

33
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,330
conditions,
websites.

34
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,343
It's how you present yourself,
how you present yourself in terms of 

35
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:30,874
your clothing and your fashion and your 
hair and makeup and that sort of thing 

36
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:35,170
in day to day activity.

37
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,230
It's shouldn't be too unreasonable 
walked out with it.

38
00:02:38,231 --> 00:02:39,064
That does not constitute a group and I'm
actually a bit of a stickler when it 

39
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:43,114
comes to language.
I think especially when we're making 

40
00:02:44,921 --> 00:02:45,754
legislation that we should be laws that 
say exactly what they should say and 

41
00:02:48,311 --> 00:02:49,144
nothing else,
and since gender expression is not 

42
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:52,654
approved,
it strikes me as very difficult to 

43
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:57,630
determine exactly how it's going to be 
added as a group to the protected groups

44
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,780
under the relevant to human rights.
But more than that,

45
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,170
um,
it's,

46
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,170
it's quite self.
It's quite almost,

47
00:03:07,171 --> 00:03:08,880
and I've talked to a number of people 
about this,

48
00:03:08,881 --> 00:03:09,714
so I know it's not just my imagination 
then bill [inaudible] and legislation 

49
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:13,984
like it are going to be interpreted in 
light of the policies that the Ontario 

50
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,753
Human Rights Commission has developed a,
the urine absolutely incoherent set of 

51
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,450
palsy,
never seen one.

52
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,030
And that's why the,
the first video,

53
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,650
the second video I made because 
University of Toronto and its wisdom,

54
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,503
the HR and equity people decided that it
was okay to force their employees to 

55
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:38,200
undergo mandatory anti unconscious bias 
training.

56
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,033
Which is something I have a big problem 
with given that you can't diagnose 

57
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:46,120
someone's unconscious bias first of all.
And even if you couldn't,

58
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,020
there's no evidence whatsoever that 
unconscious bias retreading will help.

59
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:50,854
And find them,
there's no reason whatsoever by your 

60
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:54,400
employer,
no matter who they are,

61
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,234
should be messing about with the 
fundamental perceptual structures of 

62
00:03:57,491 --> 00:03:58,870
your,
of your psyche,

63
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,420
especially when they're looking at 
things that aren't even volunteered.

64
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,700
So it's appalling on multiple 
dimensions.

65
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:04,534
And one of the things I would seriously 
recommend to all of you is that if 

66
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:07,384
anybody starts to suggest that you need 
to undergo mandatory retraining through 

67
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:14,440
your unconscious racial biases,
that if you go along with that,

68
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:15,274
you're immediately admitting that you're
the sort of biggest who needs to be 

69
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:18,094
retrained.
And I would think very carefully about 

70
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:23,290
admitting them because first of all,
it's possible that it's not true.

71
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:24,281
You know,
I mean,

72
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:26,710
people carry with them.
Every carries with them,

73
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,810
certainly in the,
in group preference.

74
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:29,644
That's quite common.
What exactly that means in terms of 

75
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,150
their overt behavior.
Uh,

76
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:37,690
proclivities is completely undetermined 
by the relevant science.

77
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:38,524
And there's absolutely no excuse for 
social psychologists to be putting 

78
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:42,064
forward tests like the implicit 
association task which purport to 

79
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:48,820
measure unconscious bias as a diagnosed 
against them because they don't have the

80
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:51,510
validity and reliability that we put 
forward as such.

81
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,353
In fact,
if you are a clinical psychologist and 

82
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:56,860
you were using tests that sort of to 
diagnose individuals,

83
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,510
you'd be in violation of the statutes 
that are governing private practice.

84
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,760
So I have my reasons for objecting to 
these studies.

85
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,303
Now.
What I really don't like about bill see 

86
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,140
16 and its surrounding policies is that 
it's.

87
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,043
It's putting into our law a sequence of 
presuppositions that actually happened 

88
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:19,630
to be false and it was me and pointing 
out that they were false.

89
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,463
That's got me in whatever trouble I've 
been in and generate the accusations of 

90
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:27,620
such things as Trans Phobia and racism,
which are.

91
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,930
I don't know how racism got into the 
picture at all because.

92
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:32,843
Because I complained about the insane 
individuals who are running black lives 

93
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,250
matter Toronto.
Then I have,

94
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,123
since I'm not a racist,
I don't care if you're black or 

95
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,553
breathing if you're crazy.
I've never made the point that you're 

96
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,263
crazy to people who run the black lives 
matter are really reprehensible 

97
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:49,120
individuals and so I was objective to 
that.

98
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:53,420
I don't see how that makes racist with 
regards to being a transport.

99
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,873
First of all,
I object to the terminology because 

100
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:57,094
phobia has specific terminology,
which is partly why also object to the 

101
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:01,520
word luck,
Islamophobia,

102
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,870
because phobia is a medical term and you
don't just get to pull in medical terms,

103
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,570
uh,
away from their proper context and apply

104
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:09,404
them to those people whose political 
opinions you don't happen to agree with 

105
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,030
misuse of language.

106
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:14,863
It's misuse of medical terminology.
And I would also like to tell all of 

107
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:19,370
them,
just so you know,

108
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:22,460
that there are a number of.
First of all,

109
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:25,100
there aren't that many transsexual 
people in the world.

110
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:27,890
There aren't that many in Canada.
So whenever you hear from any of them,

111
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,920
it's actually a reasonably substantial 
portion of the overall population.

112
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:37,700
There are a lot of videos on youtube put
up like transsexual people,

113
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,430
including the person I talked to you in 
Vancouver.

114
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:45,040
His name is Tara Meyer who,
who stayed quite vociferous with that.

115
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,210
They don't agree with any of the,
uh,

116
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,223
of the activist.
The trend is that the so called Trans 

117
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,363
activist political agenda that's being 
put forward as hypothetically 

118
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,530
representative of their approval.
First of all,

119
00:06:57,531 --> 00:07:01,430
they're not a group.
The fact that you happened to have a,

120
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,990
what would you say,
gender dysphoria or,

121
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,580
or an indeterminate gender identity does
not make people a margin to screw.

122
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,443
It certainly doesn't.
It doesn't situate you such that some 

123
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,360
member of your group or some so called 
ally,

124
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:17,630
let's say,
can stand out and stand purport to speak

125
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:18,464
for you on mass as if you were a,
a modular scrutiny as completely 

126
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,380
nonsensical.
I mean,

127
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,400
you can talk to a man and assuming that 
he speaks for all man,

128
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,460
man,
you can't tell.

129
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,313
Talk to a black woman and have her say 
that she speaks for all black women and 

130
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,340
inserting the can stand up and say that 
because you're a transsexual,

131
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,840
you speak for all transexuals 
department.

132
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:39,923
Why?
We have the idea of legitimate 

133
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:45,740
representation for people to 
legitimately represented a group.

134
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,360
They have to have some legitimacy.
Perhaps they have to be elected.

135
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,640
At least they have to pull the people 
that are purporting to represent because

136
00:07:52,641 --> 00:07:57,641
he can just come up and say it.
It's inappropriate on after receiving 30

137
00:07:58,221 --> 00:07:59,054
letters from transsexual people and then
29 and the more positive and I can tell 

138
00:08:03,591 --> 00:08:05,720
you why with regards to what I've been 
doing,

139
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:09,920
I can tell you why the first is they're 
not very happy with,

140
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,993
uh,
the idea that they're being represented 

141
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:13,574
by these noisy activists groups because 
they don't regain at each individual 

142
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:17,943
because these are all individuals who 
wrote me saying that they're not happy 

143
00:08:20,661 --> 00:08:22,070
about being represented.

144
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,903
They're not having because that isn't 
how their political view of the world 

145
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,200
actually helps to lay itself out.
In fact,

146
00:08:27,201 --> 00:08:29,950
most people were turning sexual,
are perfectly happened,

147
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,270
for example,
with the pronouns he and she,

148
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,430
they just want to be called the other 
one.

149
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:38,810
And so the people who are,
who want the gender neutral pronouns,

150
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,670
pronouns say,
I don't know,

151
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,250
a very small minority of a very small 
minority.

152
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:44,084
It's hard to say how many of them are,
but the idea that they're somehow valid 

153
00:08:48,171 --> 00:08:50,260
representatives of the whole group is 
observing.

154
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,970
They're also not very happy because they
believe that,

155
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,890
that that because this has become such 
an issue,

156
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,190
there are actually likely to face more 
prejudice rather than less prejudice,

157
00:08:59,191 --> 00:09:01,110
you know,
because generally what people want,

158
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,040
regardless of whatever kind of visible 
minority status they might have,

159
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:05,903
what most people want is to live 
relatively peacefully and invisibly 

160
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,590
among other people.

161
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:15,290
And so then whenever a political 
movement comes out to exaggerate or or,

162
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,090
or otherwise draw attention to the 
reporting differences,

163
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:22,890
there's real danger in that.
So I'd like to put to rest the idea that

164
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:23,724
somehow the transactive as to who are 
accusing me of all the things that are 

165
00:09:27,711 --> 00:09:28,544
accusing me of are somehow more 
legitimate representatives of 

166
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:36,231
transsexual identity and,
and that say well being than I am.

167
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,463
I don't believe that for a second.
I've dealt with all sorts of people in 

168
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:43,930
my life more than more than most people.
That you'll need that for sure.

169
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,570
Big Span,
different sort of person.

170
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:46,404
You can imagine that I worked hard to 
make all of their lives better 

171
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,690
regardless of their,
of their particulars,

172
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:55,150
of their identity.
And so to cast me as an enemy of,

173
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,830
of,
of,

174
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,890
of an identifiable group,
I believe is completely observed them.

175
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,240
I think I can be confident in stating 
that too because I have the good fortune

176
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,223
of having about 500 hours of my public 
statements to university students 

177
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:08,520
online.

178
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,430
I tape everything now.
Everything that will say to students,

179
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,840
pretty much,
you know,

180
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,773
at least in the classroom if there is 
anything even remotely reprehensible in 

181
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:21,600
any of that content and can be sure that
someone would have called it out and put

182
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:22,434
it on youtube with big exclamation 
points that are going to be called 

183
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:28,410
property to task for it.
And none of that has happened at all.

184
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:30,310
And the reason for that is that there 
isn't any of that.

185
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,283
None of that exists.
So I'm not saying that I'm completely 

186
00:10:33,961 --> 00:10:36,480
without bias.
You have to be a fool to say that,

187
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,593
you know,
everyone is biased in their perceptions 

188
00:10:39,391 --> 00:10:40,550
to some degree.
But that's,

189
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,320
that's not the point.
That doesn't mean you're racially biased

190
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:44,154
or that you're racist.
It means that you have your own 

191
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:46,344
particular viewpoint.
And then that comes with with 

192
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,933
idiosyncratic St,
St Lucy's and peculiarities of your 

193
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:53,064
character and your ethnic heritage and 
your race and your culture and all of 

194
00:10:55,981 --> 00:10:56,700
that.

195
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,533
So I'm not going to say for a moment 
that I don't have my own viewpoint 

196
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:05,050
because I do,
but I'm a certain things that,

197
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,530
that their comments directed at me that 
you're trying to target with some,

198
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,050
some of these half winded epithets that 
are continuing to direct it after you're

199
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:15,570
completely without any standing 
whatsoever.

200
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,610
So.
All right,

201
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:18,444
so let's go into the background that 
Bill [inaudible] and why I objected to 

202
00:11:21,511 --> 00:11:22,344
it.
So I looked at quite deeply into the 

203
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:27,450
legislation as it was originally 
formulated in Ontario.

204
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,333
And that was the legislation that was 
designed to provide protection for 

205
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,230
people who,
whose gender identities,

206
00:11:34,231 --> 00:11:35,064
let's say nonstandard.
And the original legislation wasn't too 

207
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:38,304
bad,
you know,

208
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,153
it.
It basically attempted to do perhaps 

209
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:46,770
what it should have if it was going to 
be reasonable and merely add,

210
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,663
let's say the people who have a 
nonstandard gender identities to the 

211
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:53,260
list of protected groups.

212
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,093
And they actually defined the known 
standard gender identity fairly 

213
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,953
carefully,
but they shot the legislation out to 

214
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,103
activists groups and what happened was 
that by the time everybody and their 

215
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:05,974
dog,
so to speak and have their shot at 

216
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:08,374
modifying the original terminology was 
absolute mess and it's an absolute mess 

217
00:12:11,381 --> 00:12:14,380
now and I'm going to tell him why and 
also why it's dangerous.

218
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,350
There first thing in the policies that 
surround those [inaudible].

219
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:20,883
There's a claim that's been instantiated
law in Ontario and will soon be 

220
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:24,514
instantiated into law in Canada.
Anatomy is and it's a technical and you 

221
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,780
need to pay attention to it because of 
the technicalities matter.

222
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,000
So the claim is the biological sex,
gender identity,

223
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:42,930
gender expression and sexual proclivity 
very independently

224
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,380
and that was a false claim.
Now,

225
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,253
that's actually what I said in the 
original video and that's why people 

226
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,873
originally and instill accused me of 
denying the existence of transsexual 

227
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,290
people.

228
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,123
There's no point in doing that because 
obviously transsexual people exist and 

229
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:02,380
they've existed for a very long period 
of time,

230
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,220
but that has very little to do with 
whether or not biological sex,

231
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,240
gender,
identity,

232
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:08,074
gender expression and sexual proclivity 
are independent and they are certainly 

233
00:13:11,861 --> 00:13:14,740
not independent.
They're not even close to a dependent.

234
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,460
There are so highly correlated that the 
correlation is almost perfect.

235
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,443
And,
and these things matter when you put 

236
00:13:20,561 --> 00:13:21,970
them into,
into,

237
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:25,390
into a legal framework.
And so what's really happened is because

238
00:13:25,391 --> 00:13:26,224
the social constructionist types of lost
the intellectual battle as the 

239
00:13:28,811 --> 00:13:29,644
biological evidence for the grounding of
identity has become stronger and 

240
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,950
stronger over the last 50 years because 
they've lost the scientific argument.

241
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:36,963
They've taken the back door and they're 
trying to instantiate legally it's not 

242
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:44,050
gonna work because you can make false 
facts law.

243
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,060
I mean you can hurt people by doing 
that.

244
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:46,923
You can cause all sorts of trouble,
but it isn't going to work for any 

245
00:13:48,491 --> 00:13:51,420
length of time.
So let's take apart the client.

246
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,103
First of all,
the first thing is that biological sex 

247
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:56,014
and gender identity are actually 
different and you know you can make a 

248
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:00,634
case for that in a weak way because 
because there is quite a range of 

249
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,090
personality expression,
let's say,

250
00:14:07,091 --> 00:14:12,091
and interests among people who have the 
same biological sex,

251
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,160
so there are masculine limit,
let's say,

252
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:17,470
and there are feminine now and there's 
quite an overlap,

253
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,500
although you can distinguish the 
janitors quite,

254
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:21,783
quite accurately using nothing but 
personality information and interest so 

255
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,240
you can separate them even at the level 
where there is some similarity,

256
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,000
but so you can make a weakened case for 
that,

257
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:31,834
but it's difficult to make a strong case
and the reason for that is that 

258
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:38,170
virtually every person who was 
biological sex is male,

259
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,020
expresses themselves in mail or has an 
identity that's now.

260
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,320
It's only about one in 300 people for 
whom that I get the difference.

261
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,160
Now you can say,
well that's because the,

262
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,290
the,
the,

263
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,600
the degree gender,
what would you say?

264
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:57,710
Amorphousness has been suppressed by 
sociological phenomenon.

265
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:00,440
I suppose that's true to some degree,
but it doesn't matter.

266
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,333
It's still going to being a very tiny 
minority and he's narrowed to exceed 

267
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,090
more than one percent.
I don't think so.

268
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:05,924
What that means is that 99 percent of 
people at the same gender identity as 

269
00:15:10,341 --> 00:15:13,370
biological sex,
so how has that independent?

270
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,820
It's the very opposite of independent,
so it's wrong.

271
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,713
It's a simple as that and then now that 
doesn't mean there aren't people who 

272
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:21,554
don't wear.
Those two identities don't match and 

273
00:15:23,511 --> 00:15:25,370
those are the transsexual people 
obviously,

274
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,740
but two,
to extract from that,

275
00:15:27,741 --> 00:15:28,574
the statement that those very 
independently is a intellectual sleight 

276
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:34,880
of hand and it's really been pushed 
forward by people who are radical social

277
00:15:34,881 --> 00:15:35,714
constructionists who believe that every 
single aspect of human identity is 

278
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:42,500
determined by culture and that was 
patently false and not only that,

279
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:46,910
it's dangerous politically because one 
of the ideas that characterized the most

280
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:47,744
reprehensible movements of the 20th 
century was the human beings can be 

281
00:15:50,091 --> 00:15:50,924
molded in any manner possible by the 
state that we didn't have any intrinsic 

282
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:55,034
identity,
that any sort and that were only 

283
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,770
creatures of coalition.

284
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,130
And that's not the case.
There's a very distinct human identity,

285
00:16:01,131 --> 00:16:03,910
and I'll talk a little bit more about 
that as this progresses.

286
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,300
Okay,
so gender identity and biological sex do

287
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:09,134
not very independent.
That's the first thing that clamp as 

288
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,690
well,
that's moved to gender expression.

289
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,953
Well,
you can address in any manner in what 

290
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,330
you can express yourself in a feminine 
manner,

291
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,193
culturally speaking,
if you're a male or you can express 

292
00:16:22,671 --> 00:16:25,100
yourself in the mascot.
Now culturally speaking,

293
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:25,934
if you're female,
but the truth of the matter is that the 

294
00:16:27,801 --> 00:16:32,240
vast majority of people whose biological
sex is male and whose gender identity is

295
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,074
male,
presented themselves in their fashion 

296
00:16:34,761 --> 00:16:38,150
choices as male and the same can be said
about females.

297
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,110
So the notion that there's independence 
there is also interact.

298
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,530
They can vary,
but they don't vary independently.

299
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,150
And finally,
with regards to sexual proclivity,

300
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,230
the vast majority of people who are male
who a,

301
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,630
who identify as a male who presented 
themselves as male,

302
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,220
are also heterosexual.

303
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:58,100
And that doesn't mean that there are new
people who are homosexual.

304
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:00,560
The percentage varies,
but it looks like it's somewhere between

305
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,394
two and five percent or maybe between 
one and five percent depending on the 

306
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:04,904
statistics,
but that means that at least 95 percent 

307
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:08,384
of people who are male who identify as 
male and present and present themselves 

308
00:17:12,861 --> 00:17:13,694
as male are also heterosexual,
so those four levels of analysis do not 

309
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:23,381
very independently and that's that.
So the law is incorrect,

310
00:17:23,511 --> 00:17:24,344
it's badly formulated and it's poorly 
put forward and that's what I was 

311
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:27,614
objecting to.
Now is worse than that as far as I can 

312
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:32,410
tell,
because it's social construction is dale

313
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,620
and the social infrastructure element is
the insistence that all those things are

314
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:39,920
culturally are culturally constructed 
and they're not.

315
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,410
So let's do that.
Let's review that a little bit.

316
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,690
It's like elementary biology I suppose.

317
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,150
What's different between men and women?
All right,

318
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,123
well there's a variety of things.
You know the classic human embryo 

319
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,990
logical for is female xx or x,
y,

320
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:02,310
and the males are a masculinized in 
Utero by testosterone.

321
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,383
So that's the first difference.
And testosterone exposure in Utero has 

322
00:18:06,391 --> 00:18:10,260
quite profound effects on later on all 
sorts of phenomena.

323
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,230
Psychological and physical,
so for example,

324
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:16,980
one of the things that higher levels of 
testosterone in Utero seem to predict is

325
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:20,480
less interest in people that more 
interest in face and so,

326
00:18:20,481 --> 00:18:24,390
and that's been well documented research
teams in the UK in particular,

327
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,500
but,
but in any case,

328
00:18:26,501 --> 00:18:30,090
so this Feminine Female Morpho the 
Standard Morphology is female,

329
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:34,020
but it's translated into male,
a male morphology by testosterone.

330
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:35,723
And so then what do you get for standard
morphological transformations while 

331
00:18:38,821 --> 00:18:43,300
there's the evident genetic ones 
speaking technically a,

332
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,153
obviously male and female genitalia 
differ substantially as you all know 

333
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,070
there are,
there are,

334
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:53,100
there is some variation in that,
although it's very rare.

335
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,323
Um,
and then there are also other 

336
00:18:56,131 --> 00:18:59,430
differences that kick forward,
especially when puberty hits and some of

337
00:18:59,431 --> 00:19:01,610
those are physiological and some of them
are resectable.

338
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,410
So one of the things that you see have 
you for example,

339
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:05,244
is that there aren't very many,
there aren't very large personality 

340
00:19:08,491 --> 00:19:09,324
differences between boys and girls 
before purely doing with regards to 

341
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:12,984
negative emotion.
So that's trading neuroticism for those 

342
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:17,730
of you who are interested in big five 
trait terminology.

343
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,073
And so people who were high on 
neuroticism are more sensitive to 

344
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:21,924
anxiety and emotional pain and women are
more sensitive than men to anxiety and 

345
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:30,000
emotional pain on average and the effect
is massive.

346
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:32,430
It's about a third to half a standard 
deviation,

347
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,443
but it's massive enough so that if you 
look at the end of the distributions 

348
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:40,830
were the extreme and people are almost 
all the people who have extreme problems

349
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:42,330
with anxiety and emotional pain.

350
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,163
Our window,
it's running about four to one in terms 

351
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:45,624
of depression and anxiety disorder 
diagnosis worldwide and there's no 

352
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,380
evidence that that's cultural.
Now on the other end of the spectrum,

353
00:19:52,381 --> 00:19:55,070
so to speak,
there are male pathologies as well,

354
00:19:55,071 --> 00:19:55,904
so males are much more likely to 
manifest every social personality 

355
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,364
disordered.
They're much more likely to be 

356
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:01,254
characterized by alcoholism and they're 
also more much more likely to manifest 

357
00:20:04,741 --> 00:20:07,950
and attention deficit disorder and 
various learning disabilities.

358
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:12,150
And so that also seems to be biologic 
dedicated to a large degree.

359
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:15,780
So and interestingly enough,
those differences,

360
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:20,190
the personality differences between men 
and women with regards to trade negative

361
00:20:20,191 --> 00:20:23,310
emotion emerge up puberty while,
while.

362
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,690
Well,
let's think about it for a minute.

363
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,340
Now,
these are speculations,

364
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:27,174
but you can,
you can think about that until you tell 

365
00:20:28,651 --> 00:20:29,490
me what you think.
I mean,

366
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,350
they're reasonably grounded 
speculations,

367
00:20:31,351 --> 00:20:34,290
but um,
I'm not certainly going to state them as

368
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,290
fact,
although I would say that the,

369
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,900
the idea that these differences in 
personality between men and women exist,

370
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:40,734
that's fast.

371
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,653
How powerful those different those 
differences are and precisely what they 

372
00:20:46,171 --> 00:20:49,000
consist of is still subject to some 
investigation,

373
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:51,040
but it's extraordinarily well 
documented.

374
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,170
So what happens to men and men at 
puberty,

375
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,810
while the men get bigger,
they get stronger,

376
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:03,070
especially in their upper bodies and 
human beings are quite impressive.

377
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,530
Were prey animals as well as we're 
predators,

378
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:06,364
as well as what are the,
what are the ways that we defend 

379
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,260
ourselves aggressively is using the 
upper body strength.

380
00:21:11,261 --> 00:21:15,130
So we punch like Kangaroos.
There's other evidence to do that.

381
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,770
So,
and we punched.

382
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,960
And so what that means is that men are 
quite a bit more dangerous than women in

383
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,830
say hand to hand combat.
And that's an American actual actually a

384
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:25,420
real problem.
You see one of those,

385
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,480
you see that manifest itself in part in 
a strange statistic because it will come

386
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:31,624
as news to most of you,
but why is it their husbands more often 

387
00:21:33,881 --> 00:21:36,580
than husband see if their wives quite 
quite a lot actually,

388
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,893
but it's.

389
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:38,863
It's a misleading statistic to some 
degree because women lack upper body 

390
00:21:41,471 --> 00:21:42,304
strength.
They can hit their husbands and they're 

391
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:43,834
not really going to hurt them that much.
I mean there are men who are abused and 

392
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,450
neglected that,
but one of the problems with having much

393
00:21:49,451 --> 00:21:50,284
harder at upper body strength is that if
you hit some your life Bible to hurt 

394
00:21:53,201 --> 00:21:54,034
them,
and so a male aggression in the context 

395
00:21:56,741 --> 00:21:57,574
of a dyadic relationship,
physical aggression as much more likely 

396
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:00,334
to be dangerous or lethal than the 
female version of the same sort as part 

397
00:22:03,551 --> 00:22:04,384
of the reason.
I think that women are more likely to 

398
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:06,454
hit their husbands or wives more likely 
to interest us that the reverse is 

399
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:09,694
because both have wives and the husbands
know perfectly well that the wife is 

400
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:13,234
going to hurt as much.
So there isn't as much inhibition 

401
00:22:15,011 --> 00:22:15,880
against the aggression.

402
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,400
Okay,
so now what is it?

403
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,160
What is it mean for women that men are 
stronger than them?

404
00:22:21,161 --> 00:22:25,990
Starting at puberty means that women are
at a disadvantage in physical combat and

405
00:22:25,991 --> 00:22:26,824
that's part of the reason I think that 
their nervous systems make them more 

406
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:29,494
nervous or anxious and more susceptible 
to emotional pain is because the world 

407
00:22:33,071 --> 00:22:36,460
is actually more dangerous for them.
Now the world is also more dangerous for

408
00:22:36,461 --> 00:22:38,830
women's sexually.
Now that self evident,

409
00:22:38,831 --> 00:22:39,664
I really think I have to explain that.
I hope no one is foolish enough to try 

410
00:22:43,511 --> 00:22:44,344
to disagree with that.
Definitely the reason that sex is more 

411
00:22:46,751 --> 00:22:50,890
dangerous for women than for men 
obviously because women can get pregnant

412
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,680
and that changes.
That changes their life completely.

413
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,020
I mean,
they may choose to have an abortion,

414
00:22:56,021 --> 00:23:00,040
but that in itself is no trivial matter 
and as soon as you have a child and that

415
00:23:00,041 --> 00:23:00,874
child is dependent on you,
then your whole life is changed and in 

416
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,920
in more traditional societies,
if you had a sexual adventure outside of

417
00:23:08,921 --> 00:23:12,820
the standard traditional structures and 
you ended up pregnant,

418
00:23:12,821 --> 00:23:13,654
now you are in serious trouble and so 
for women to be more anxious and more 

419
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:18,364
susceptible to the emotional pain 
because of their increased sexual 

420
00:23:20,411 --> 00:23:22,180
vulnerability is perfectly reasonable.

421
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:23,883
Then the final reason I think that that 
women are more susceptible to anxiety 

422
00:23:28,421 --> 00:23:31,540
and emotional pain than men is because.

423
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,720
Let me see now.
I lost my train of thought for that.

424
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,700
I'll have to come back to that for a 
moment.

425
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:40,910
Oh yes.
That's it.

426
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,623
No,
it's not obvious to me that women's 

427
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,603
nervous systems are actually actually 
serve to function in the best interest 

428
00:23:50,781 --> 00:23:51,614
of women.
I think that they actually serve to 

429
00:23:54,171 --> 00:23:58,340
function in the best interests of women 
and infants because you think,

430
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,790
do you think about our evolutionary past
and for that matter are present?

431
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:02,993
No,
you're quite a different creature when 

432
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,490
you're single person,
male or female,

433
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,920
then you are when you're a female as an 
incident,

434
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:15,050
especially the intent that's under the 
bolt hole on soul because human entrance

435
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:15,884
are unbelievable.
Know they're born in some sense of way 

436
00:24:19,711 --> 00:24:20,544
before they shouldn't be in that.
That's part of an evolutionary problem 

437
00:24:22,821 --> 00:24:25,220
too because our hands are so fake that 
babies are.

438
00:24:25,221 --> 00:24:26,054
Babies have to be born very young 
compared to other mammals that are our 

439
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,200
size.

440
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,320
Roughly speaking.
The gestation period shouldn't be longer

441
00:24:33,321 --> 00:24:36,170
for human being.
So because our heads are so big,

442
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:37,004
the babies have to come under early and 
that makes them route relatively 

443
00:24:38,931 --> 00:24:40,800
underdeveloped.
Um,

444
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,940
and so they need a tremendous amount of 
care.

445
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,813
They're very fragile.
And so it seems to be quite likely that 

446
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,233
women's nervous systems are optimized so
that they're more threat sensitive and 

447
00:24:50,261 --> 00:24:51,094
more sensitive to emotional pain because
they have to be more responsive to 

448
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,253
infants and they have to take care of,
especially in your most fragile state 

449
00:24:57,291 --> 00:24:58,770
and happen to be in the first nine 
months.

450
00:24:58,771 --> 00:24:59,604
And I think that tilts women's nervous 
systems hard in the direction of what 

451
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:06,590
men might regard as excessive negative 
emotionality,

452
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,453
but you have to be sensitive to threat 
and danger if you're going to have an 

453
00:25:09,351 --> 00:25:11,360
infant because they're very,
very fragile.

454
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:12,703
So I think those are the reasons,
and there's lots of other personality 

455
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:17,210
differences between men and women.

456
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,213
You know,
I can give you a list of them and these 

457
00:25:19,191 --> 00:25:21,650
are well documented it,
so you might as well know about them.

458
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,063
Um,
there's not a lot of difference in men 

459
00:25:24,951 --> 00:25:28,310
and women in terms of extroversion.
Extroversion as a whole.

460
00:25:28,311 --> 00:25:29,144
Extroversion is roughly the dimension 
that bring in the dimension of 

461
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:34,040
personality that's associated with 
positive emotion.

462
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,700
And extroverted people are gregarious 
and enthusiastic and assertive.

463
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:39,710
They like to party.
They like to have a good time.

464
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:44,040
The social environment is their 
environment and extroversion breaks down

465
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:47,210
into enthusiasm and assertiveness and 
women are more enthusiasm,

466
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,390
which means that not only do they have 
more negative emotion than men,

467
00:25:50,391 --> 00:25:53,330
they also have more positive emotions.
And so,

468
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:54,483
um,
so that's the positive emotion 

469
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:56,804
dimension.
The negative emotion dimension is 

470
00:25:58,761 --> 00:25:59,960
neuroticism,
as I said,

471
00:25:59,961 --> 00:26:02,180
somewhat pleasantly named,
I guess,

472
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:05,060
but it basically index is anxiety and 
emotional pain,

473
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,410
frustration,
disappointment,

474
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:08,590
grief,
that sort of thing.

475
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,443
All logo,
the same dimension that breaks into 

476
00:26:11,721 --> 00:26:14,180
volatility and volatility,
volatility.

477
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,033
People are rather irritable and and 
withdrawal and withdrawal are less 

478
00:26:18,771 --> 00:26:22,470
likely to do things that are threatened 
and women are higher by about a third of

479
00:26:22,471 --> 00:26:25,410
the standard deviation in both 
agreeable.

480
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,313
This is the dimension that men and women
differ on the most and agreeable people 

481
00:26:31,161 --> 00:26:31,994
and this is I think,
the most fundamental dimension of 

482
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,520
matching it at that characterizes human 
being so agreeable.

483
00:26:37,521 --> 00:26:41,330
People are compassionate and polite and 
warm and kind and giving,

484
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,480
but they're easy to.
It's easy to take of

485
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:45,283
standing up for themselves and actually 
if you look at one of the things that 

486
00:26:47,611 --> 00:26:51,060
predicts wage differential across time,
male or female,

487
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:51,894
there's more agreeable.
People get paid less and the reason for 

488
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:56,620
that is that often salary negotiation 
negotiations,

489
00:26:56,621 --> 00:26:59,430
that zero sum and if and if you're not 
aggressive,

490
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,293
you don't get paid because people aren't
just going to give you money because 

491
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,410
they're going to be nice to you.
That is not how it works.

492
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:05,483
You generally have to fight for status 
and position and movement forward 

493
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,910
careers and in order to that,
you'd have to take a relatively,

494
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,553
I would say self centered attitude 
because they all sent in some sense the 

495
00:27:16,671 --> 00:27:18,930
opposite.
The opposite of being agreeable is to be

496
00:27:18,931 --> 00:27:22,830
self centered and I'm also not saying 
that in a particularly negative way.

497
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,043
There's advantages to being self 
centered and to fight for your own 

498
00:27:25,951 --> 00:27:29,790
territory and so and men are more likely
to do that and you might say,

499
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:30,624
well,
what's your evidence that those 

500
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,053
differences in personality aren't 
culturally constructed and the evidence 

501
00:27:35,701 --> 00:27:36,000
for that?

502
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,520
It's quite clear.
You can go online,

503
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,363
you look up the Scandinavian studies.
Let's go online and look up gender 

504
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:43,200
differences in personality 
cross-culturally.

505
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:46,410
You'll find the relevant studies.
They've been done with tens of thousands

506
00:27:46,411 --> 00:27:50,370
of people and what they showed quite 
clearly is that in those societies where

507
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:54,450
the most is being done to move,
move to social world,

508
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:55,403
into a position of radically quality,
and so that would roughly be the 

509
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:58,943
Scandinavian countries because they've 
done more than that more than any other 

510
00:28:02,011 --> 00:28:02,844
country.
The personality differences between men 

511
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:08,280
and women maximize,
they don't minimize,

512
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,203
they maximize.
And I'll say that again at in the 

513
00:28:11,641 --> 00:28:12,474
countries where the most has been done 
to equalize the playing field between 

514
00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:18,294
men and women.
Men and women get more different rather 

515
00:28:20,911 --> 00:28:21,744
than more of the same.
So for all your social constructionists 

516
00:28:24,151 --> 00:28:24,984
out there in the audience,
and there's probably not that many of 

517
00:28:26,311 --> 00:28:27,144
you because you wouldn't come in here 
and be talked to or social 

518
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,960
constructionist.
You're actually wrong.

519
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,660
Yeah.
Well,

520
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,533
and the thing is,

521
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:40,750
thank you.
Don't

522
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,750
be.
So.

523
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:47,963
One of the things you might be 
interested in is that it's all the same 

524
00:28:50,611 --> 00:28:51,444
to me in some sense,
like when I was looking into this to 

525
00:28:53,401 --> 00:28:56,400
begin with in this group started 
probably 25 years ago,

526
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,700
looking at differences in personality 
between men and women,

527
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,933
you know,
it doesn't go at all whether they were 

528
00:29:02,311 --> 00:29:05,750
fundamentally biological,
biological are fundamentally associate,

529
00:29:05,751 --> 00:29:09,270
large boiler or mixed produced the 
differences,

530
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,143
you know,
no one knew and the most logical 

531
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:12,744
hypothesis really the ipod was that as 
unique as this society that men and 

532
00:29:16,531 --> 00:29:19,620
women would become more of the same,
but that is not what happened,

533
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,513
and so we've actually looked the social 
constructionist hypothesis with regards 

534
00:29:23,041 --> 00:29:26,190
to gender differences in insects and 
personality.

535
00:29:26,191 --> 00:29:27,024
We'll put that to the test and you're 
very intense way and the social 

536
00:29:29,251 --> 00:29:30,084
constructionist viewpoint fail.
So it's very strange because no one 

537
00:29:33,421 --> 00:29:34,630
really believed that,
right?

538
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,493
If you make this make society one of the
same in men and women get more 

539
00:29:37,621 --> 00:29:38,490
different.
Sorry,

540
00:29:38,491 --> 00:29:40,170
what's up with that?
Well,

541
00:29:40,171 --> 00:29:44,020
the answer seems to is that there's 
fundamentally two sources of variability

542
00:29:44,021 --> 00:29:45,190
in personality,
right?

543
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,203
There's perhaps more,
but you can categorize them as roughly 

544
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,850
genetic and roughly sociological.
Well,

545
00:29:51,851 --> 00:29:52,684
if you take out all the sociological 
differences between the landscape in 

546
00:29:56,471 --> 00:29:57,304
which men,
women are raped and all you have left 

547
00:29:58,811 --> 00:29:59,644
are the biological and genetic 
differences so they maximize or that's 

548
00:30:02,771 --> 00:30:05,080
exactly what happened.
This actually matters.

549
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,393
It really matters.
And this is why the demands for equity 

550
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:09,640
or so.
Well,

551
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,190
there's 15 reasons why demands for 
equity.

552
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:15,260
This is between men and women should not
be overlooked.

553
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,143
Partly because it's wrong to overlook 
the junior with differences between men 

554
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:21,480
and women.
It's not good for the man.

555
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,363
It's not good for the women.
So one of the things you see in 

556
00:30:24,551 --> 00:30:25,870
Scandinavia,
for example,

557
00:30:25,871 --> 00:30:26,704
is there's an overwhelming preponderance
of female nurses and there's an 

558
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:34,561
overwhelming preponderance of male 
engineers and actually the data on,

559
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,250
on personality differences.

560
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,900
Um,
there's,

561
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,913
there's,
there's the standard traits which I'll 

562
00:30:40,061 --> 00:30:41,560
continue to go through.
Um,

563
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,453
I can do that quite quickly.
There's no much difference in trait 

564
00:30:44,951 --> 00:30:48,580
conscientiousness between men and women.
If you break it down into the aspects,

565
00:30:48,581 --> 00:30:49,414
women are a bit more orderly than men,
but there's no difference in 

566
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:56,410
industriousness.
And then with regards to openness,

567
00:30:56,411 --> 00:30:58,330
which is the intellect,
intellect,

568
00:30:58,331 --> 00:31:00,250
creativity,
dimension overall,

569
00:31:00,251 --> 00:31:01,720
there's no difference between men and 
women,

570
00:31:01,721 --> 00:31:02,554
but if you break it up into the aspects,
then the differences are actually quite 

571
00:31:04,931 --> 00:31:05,764
pronounced.
So what you have is the openness to 

572
00:31:08,021 --> 00:31:08,854
experience is the technical trade and it
roughly breaks down into something 

573
00:31:11,831 --> 00:31:12,664
that's sort of like create creativity 
and aesthetic interests versus the 

574
00:31:15,391 --> 00:31:16,224
interest in ideas.
And what you see is that women are a 

575
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,510
third of the standard deviation higher 
than men in terms of,

576
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:26,410
of creativity and aesthetic aesthetic 
proclivity,

577
00:31:26,411 --> 00:31:27,244
let's say,
and men or month or the standard 

578
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:31,750
deviation higher than women in terms of 
interest in ideas.

579
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,570
And it's not a trivial difference and it
makes a difference.

580
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:35,823
So,
but the biggest difference between men 

581
00:31:37,001 --> 00:31:37,834
and women as it turns out,
and this is almost one standard 

582
00:31:40,301 --> 00:31:42,140
deviation,
which is a walloping difference.

583
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,690
You never see that in social sciences.
And massive difference is um,

584
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:50,560
difference between difference in 
interest and the masculine interests.

585
00:31:50,561 --> 00:31:53,140
Roughly speaking is in things.
And then female interest,

586
00:31:53,141 --> 00:31:53,974
roughly speaking is in people.
And that's what underlies the 

587
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:57,830
differences.
Say in,

588
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,813
in career choice preference between 
things like nursing and psychology and 

589
00:32:01,721 --> 00:32:05,980
social work and that sort of thing and 
engineering and uh,

590
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,083
because engineering is perhaps the most 
male oriented about the disciplines and 

591
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:14,590
the evidence that that's a sociological 
history period.

592
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,860
Now I should also point out,
because this is important,

593
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,470
people have wondered for a long time if 
they,

594
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:24,510
if the differences between men and women
say with regards to the sciences and the

595
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,353
engineering had anything to do with 
intelligence and the former prison 

596
00:32:29,021 --> 00:32:29,560
department.

597
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,540
There is,
summer's gone in terrible trouble at one

598
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:32,171
point.
In fact,

599
00:32:32,171 --> 00:32:33,004
I think he had to resign because he made
a very technical claim and he said that 

600
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:39,860
if you look at the distributions of 
intelligence for men and women,

601
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,780
imagine you have a normal distribution.
Right?

602
00:32:41,781 --> 00:32:44,570
So almost everybody's at the average.
There's some extremely,

603
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,850
extremely intelligent people,
but not very many.

604
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:49,270
And there are some people who are very 
intellectually imperative.

605
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,143
Not very many.
If you map the distributions of many 

606
00:32:52,131 --> 00:32:55,040
women onto one another,
there's two hypothesis.

607
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:57,200
One hypothesis,
roughly speaking,

608
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:01,970
is that they're the se and the evidence 
for that as is reasonable.

609
00:33:01,971 --> 00:33:02,804
I would say the other,
the other theory is that the means are 

610
00:33:05,811 --> 00:33:07,460
the same,
the meaning is the same.

611
00:33:07,461 --> 00:33:10,240
So both men and women have an average Iq
of 100,

612
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:13,690
but the standard deviation is different.
So it's larger amendment.

613
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:14,630
It is in women.

614
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:15,643
And what that means is that if you're 
way the hell out into the hyper genius 

615
00:33:18,171 --> 00:33:19,610
rates,
they're almost all men.

616
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:22,850
But also if you go away,
they log into the range where people are

617
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:26,570
incredibly intellectually impaired.
They're also all men.

618
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,020
And that's the increase male variability
hypothesis.

619
00:33:30,021 --> 00:33:33,800
And you see increased male variability 
in and a number of different species,

620
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,080
partly because men are more expendable 
than limit.

621
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,450
And the reason for that,
biologically speaking,

622
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:40,520
the reason for that is that,
well,

623
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:43,160
you don't need that many men to 
impregnate a lot of women,

624
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:43,994
but women need women.
Women are a bottleneck with regards to 

625
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,610
reproduction.
So every woman task,

626
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:52,280
although not every man's house and,
and that's true many,

627
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:54,920
many species.
And so you see more variability and male

628
00:33:54,921 --> 00:33:57,260
behavior because of that across species 
frequently.

629
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,423
And um,
that comes often added costs with 

630
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,330
increased male illness.

631
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,950
And you know,
look at it guys,

632
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:04,843
you're going to die.
It's been eight years sooner than the 

633
00:34:06,501 --> 00:34:09,770
typical woman and that's partly the 
price you paid for,

634
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,633
for,
for,

635
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,473
for running,
parking on testosterone because it's 

636
00:34:12,681 --> 00:34:17,300
quite toxic over the long run.
So men are men in do page for their,

637
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,163
for their,
whatever advantages they might have and 

638
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:23,250
they paid for that with the lifespan 
that's decreased by about 10 percent.

639
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,750
It's a nontrivial disadvantage.
But anyways,

640
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,620
what Larry Summers said was,
well,

641
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:31,790
if the ICU distribution is flattering 
for men than for women,

642
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:35,030
maybe one of the reason that almost all 
the outstanding men in science,

643
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:35,893
technology,
engineering and mathematics or mail is 

644
00:34:37,371 --> 00:34:41,870
because it takes a genius level of Nike 
level of say 150 or a hundred and 60.

645
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,970
And when you go way out on the 
distributions,

646
00:34:43,971 --> 00:34:45,800
when the distribution is different like 
that,

647
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,140
then there's massive differences at bms.

648
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:53,000
Now he didn't say that was by the way he
said that that was one possibility.

649
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,953
And by the way,
it is one possibility because nature 

650
00:34:55,821 --> 00:34:56,654
doesn't arrange itself so that 
everything in presents to us is in 

651
00:34:59,661 --> 00:35:02,300
keeping with what we would like to be 
true political,

652
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,040
in fact,
quite the contrary.

653
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:05,323
Now I'm kind of agnostic with regards to
that because I've looked at the data on 

654
00:35:08,211 --> 00:35:09,044
both sides and I can.
I don't think that we can make a 

655
00:35:11,761 --> 00:35:15,590
determined them statement about the 
differences in science,

656
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:16,670
technology,
engineering,

657
00:35:16,671 --> 00:35:17,504
mathematics over representation of men 
on the basis of variability and 

658
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:21,363
intelligence.
But I do think we can make the case in 

659
00:35:23,061 --> 00:35:27,770
terms of interest because it is the case
that the biggest differences between men

660
00:35:27,771 --> 00:35:30,320
and women are differences in interest.
And the question is,

661
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:33,050
well,
do we have a problem with that?

662
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,730
Because that really a problem.

663
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,380
Now you know,
you couldn't.

664
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:39,780
You could up your culture to eradicate 
those differences.

665
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,323
You know,
because you could make cultures very 

666
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:45,390
coercive.
And so if you punched boys from the time

667
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:46,224
they were born for being interested in 
things and insisted that they become 

668
00:35:48,871 --> 00:35:51,850
more interested in people,
then perhaps you could do that.

669
00:35:51,851 --> 00:35:53,730
It would,
it would come at some cost.

670
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:55,230
And you could do the same thing for 
girls,

671
00:35:55,231 --> 00:35:58,380
you could make them less interested in,
people are more interested in things,

672
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,760
but you know,
to the degree that those differences are

673
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:07,590
real and to the degree that they're 
actually bombed or grounded in biology,

674
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,573
you're going to have to turn your 
society into something pretty damn too 

675
00:36:10,331 --> 00:36:13,850
radical to produce those differences.
So when you to do that,

676
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,620
that makes you do,
what do you want to do it?

677
00:36:15,621 --> 00:36:16,454
Is it not the big problem that men and 
women actually have different interests 

678
00:36:18,931 --> 00:36:20,880
and this is read that biggest surprise.

679
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:22,890
Is that something that you want to 
eradicate?

680
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:27,300
All right.
So I also felt back to bill's scene.

681
00:36:27,301 --> 00:36:28,700
16,
okay.

682
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,053
The policies surrounding it are 
incorrect and they're dangerous and 

683
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:33,923
they're dangerous partly because they 
are predicated on the insistence that 

684
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,470
all of these,
these levels of analysis with regards to

685
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,930
human identity associated with 
culturally constructed and they're not.

686
00:36:43,931 --> 00:36:44,764
And there's implications for that too 
because one of the things that this is 

687
00:36:47,311 --> 00:36:48,144
happening,
particularly with regards to the equity 

688
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:54,921
movements.
So I'll define equity for you used to be

689
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,753
quality and more opportunity,
but it shifted to equity and in many 

690
00:36:59,191 --> 00:37:01,740
universities now,
like human resources department is human

691
00:37:01,741 --> 00:37:02,574
resources in their equity.
They should be absolutely ashamed of 

692
00:37:04,861 --> 00:37:06,150
themselves for that is.
It is.

693
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:09,330
It is absolutely appalling.
It's reprehensible.

694
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:11,810
I actually thinking,
well,

695
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:16,230
I want to say it.
There's almost no political stance.

696
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:19,050
It's more reprehensible than the stamps 
that demands equity.

697
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,393
It's very informed and it's being tried 
very many times in very many places and 

698
00:37:24,721 --> 00:37:25,554
the net result of pushing the equity 
from a political perspective was not 

699
00:37:28,171 --> 00:37:29,004
good.
And if people have any stats of 20th 

700
00:37:31,021 --> 00:37:31,854
century history at all,
the first thing they realized is that 

701
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:36,750
political systems based on the notion of
equity become murderous very,

702
00:37:36,751 --> 00:37:38,280
very rapidly.
And so

703
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:45,010
thank you.

704
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,533
So
here's how you diagnose in an 

705
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,233
organization as racist and pathological.
So the first thing you do is pick your 

706
00:37:58,821 --> 00:38:03,360
key dimensions of identity and whatever 
they happen to be in the common ones are

707
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:04,700
gender,
race,

708
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,940
ethnicity,
sexual proclivity,

709
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,310
fine,
but there are enumerable,

710
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,173
right?
That's one of the problems is that you 

711
00:38:12,171 --> 00:38:14,810
can continually in some of our people 
into groups

712
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,430
and the groups are relevant and also,
for example,

713
00:38:19,431 --> 00:38:21,920
if you were concerned with the 
representation,

714
00:38:21,921 --> 00:38:22,754
let's say of Hispanic women,
are you going to be equally concerned 

715
00:38:25,371 --> 00:38:26,204
about the representation of Hispanic 
women from economically deprived 

716
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,423
backgrounds and for rich backgrounds for
privileged about reasonably going to 

717
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,303
Hispanic women into those who came 
through privileged and those who came 

718
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:41,380
from privileged backgrounds and further 
stuff divide them by.

719
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,730
Well,
how about attractiveness?

720
00:38:42,731 --> 00:38:44,140
How about that?
How about wait,

721
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:46,060
how about that?
How about Iq?

722
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,190
How about disability?

723
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,463
No,
you can fractionating populations 

724
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,250
endlessly with regards to their group 
identity in it so that,

725
00:38:54,251 --> 00:38:55,084
that's one of the fundamental problems 
with the notion of equity just because 

726
00:38:56,981 --> 00:38:57,814
you can never attain it because you can 
keep fractionating the groups and so 

727
00:39:00,941 --> 00:39:03,420
you're not going to attain equity.
But apart from that,

728
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:05,890
let's say that you just start with the 
major categories,

729
00:39:05,891 --> 00:39:06,820
you know,
um,

730
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:08,620
gender,
ethnicity,

731
00:39:08,621 --> 00:39:12,100
race and sexual proclivity,
that's fine.

732
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:12,934
So here's how you diagnose an 
organization to find out if the people 

733
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:19,090
who run it are unconscionably biased and
prejudice.

734
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,820
You look at the strategy of the 
organization,

735
00:39:21,821 --> 00:39:23,110
right?
The power structure.

736
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:24,183
Then you take each strata and you map it
onto the demographics of the general 

737
00:39:27,461 --> 00:39:31,840
population according to your particular 
way of breaking down that population.

738
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,793
You have to keep in mind and if there's 
any lack of concordance between the 

739
00:39:35,891 --> 00:39:40,210
general population and representation at
each of those levels of the hierarchy,

740
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,800
then you described the whole hierarchy 
as unconscionably a biased and racist.

741
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,033
It's like,
well that's convenient except that it's 

742
00:39:47,411 --> 00:39:48,910
wrong.
And I mean,

743
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:49,871
well,
the thing is,

744
00:39:49,871 --> 00:39:50,704
you know,
most organizations do have their share 

745
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,013
bikes for historical reasons and for and
for reasons that are perhaps a lot more 

746
00:39:57,401 --> 00:39:58,234
unseemly that historical reasons,
but the idea that you can categorically 

747
00:40:01,721 --> 00:40:05,380
state that every single difference at 
every single level of the hierarchy as a

748
00:40:05,381 --> 00:40:06,214
consequence of the racial bias and 
announcing the thoughts of everyone in 

749
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:13,160
the organization is absolutely appalling
thing to think,

750
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,460
you know,
it's a multifaceted problem,

751
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,353
right?
Why are people represented differently 

752
00:40:18,491 --> 00:40:19,324
in different organizations?
While there's probably 20 reasons not 

753
00:40:21,491 --> 00:40:23,170
what you can't just say,
well,

754
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:25,090
it's racism or it's prejudice.
It's like,

755
00:40:25,091 --> 00:40:25,870
yeah,
yeah,

756
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,160
sure,
yes.

757
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:31,060
It's probably racism and it's probably 
prejudice,

758
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,073
but that isn't the only reasons.
There's lots of reasons and you have to 

759
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,310
do a differentiated analysis first of 
all,

760
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:37,144
to understand understanding and then you
have to be very careful not to mock 

761
00:40:39,761 --> 00:40:43,600
about stupidly with the organization to 
make it worse than it already is,

762
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,913
and so the idea,
and let me go up the University of 

763
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,160
Toronto,
her department is teaching.

764
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,890
It's just this straight out that's 
adequately.

765
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:51,873
If they.
If the organization doesn't produce a 

766
00:40:53,561 --> 00:40:54,394
population equivalent outcome,
then it's racist or sexist or whatever 

767
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,840
you want it to be.
There's something wrong with it and then

768
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,733
where's the that?
Everybody in the organization needs to 

769
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:06,280
be reeducated.
It's like,

770
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,800
come on,
that's just nuts.

771
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:11,620
It's not sensible and well,
no,

772
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,040
these are not sensible.
It's.

773
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,673
It's downright dangerous.
And so that was the other reason that I 

774
00:41:16,431 --> 00:41:17,264
made the videos to begin with is because
I don't believe that that's the least 

775
00:41:19,781 --> 00:41:23,260
bit appropriate and I think it takes our
society.

776
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:26,560
Does your path,
so all right,

777
00:41:26,561 --> 00:41:28,690
so let's.
What else do I talk to you both?

778
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,650
Oh yeah,
so,

779
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:33,680
so this was the last thing I was asked 
to about.

780
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,263
So we're in a rather chaotic political 
period right now and as you may have 

781
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:39,973
noticed,
that certainly manifested itself in the 

782
00:41:41,901 --> 00:41:42,734
American election,
which is still causing all sorts of 

783
00:41:44,271 --> 00:41:46,640
preservations,
but you can see the same thing happening

784
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,220
in let's say in Europe for the time 
being,

785
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:49,880
right?

786
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,713
What do you see happening?
Roughly speaking is that the divide 

787
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:57,290
between the left wing and the right wing
is growing and extremism on both ends is

788
00:41:57,291 --> 00:41:58,124
also growing.
And really that's not a good thing 

789
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:04,050
because we've had extremist right wing 
movements in the last 50 years.

790
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,070
We've had extremely left wing movement 
centered.

791
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:09,830
They weren't pretty and maybe we don't 
want to bring them back and so we have a

792
00:42:09,831 --> 00:42:11,690
serious problem.
All right,

793
00:42:11,691 --> 00:42:15,950
so let's take a look at that for a 
minute and look at it seriously.

794
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,910
So let's look at the left.
And so I'm going to tell you some things

795
00:42:19,911 --> 00:42:20,744
about the left.
The first thing is that people vote 

796
00:42:24,381 --> 00:42:25,214
their temperament and you need to 
understand this because when you're 

797
00:42:28,101 --> 00:42:31,370
talking to people who are across the 
political divide from you,

798
00:42:31,371 --> 00:42:33,620
and I'm assuming they're relatively 
reasonable people,

799
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,840
we're not going to talk about the 
extremist for a moment.

800
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:38,290
If you're talking to people who are 
liberal,

801
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:39,163
left leaning,
then you're talking to people who are 

802
00:42:40,731 --> 00:42:44,840
high in trait,
openness and low in conscientiousness.

803
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:47,360
Okay,
and so that makes them roughly speaking,

804
00:42:47,361 --> 00:42:51,260
interested in ideas and creative but not
very good at implementing things.

805
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,550
And then people who are on the right or 
the opposite,

806
00:42:55,551 --> 00:42:58,340
they're lower loneliness and they're 
high in conscientiousness,

807
00:42:58,790 --> 00:42:59,623
conscientiousness,
and that makes them not very good at 

808
00:43:01,221 --> 00:43:02,054
thinking up new things,
but pretty damn good at implementing 

809
00:43:04,461 --> 00:43:05,294
things that already exist and so and so.
The thing about that is that both of 

810
00:43:09,651 --> 00:43:10,484
those ways of interacting with the world
are necessary under different 

811
00:43:13,941 --> 00:43:14,960
conditions.
You know,

812
00:43:14,961 --> 00:43:17,470
sometimes you have a good idea and 
you're running on it,

813
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,313
and what we need are people to implement
the idea just as Indian as efficiently 

814
00:43:20,991 --> 00:43:25,190
and effectively and in an orderly map.
And away you go,

815
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,113
but sometimes you're efficient in order 
to restructure is not working anymore 

816
00:43:28,941 --> 00:43:29,774
because the environment has changed 
dramatically around it and you need 

817
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:32,953
troublemakers with new ideas to come in 
and break things up so that you start 

818
00:43:36,181 --> 00:43:40,040
moving in a different direction and new 
I'd for yourself or when is the time for

819
00:43:40,041 --> 00:43:40,874
the chaos of the left and when is the 
time for the order of the right and the 

820
00:43:44,451 --> 00:43:45,284
answer to that because we don't know
and that's why we have to talk because 

821
00:43:51,621 --> 00:43:54,320
the like the environment moves around on
us,

822
00:43:54,321 --> 00:43:54,770
right?

823
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:55,603
It's constantly shifting underneath our 
feet and sometimes it's shifts so that 

824
00:43:59,031 --> 00:43:59,864
we have to shift to the left to stay in 
the middle and sometimes it's shifts so 

825
00:44:03,021 --> 00:44:05,560
that we have to shift to the right to 
stay in the middle.

826
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:08,540
And the only way we can figure that out 
is by having political dialogue.

827
00:44:08,541 --> 00:44:09,374
And that's part of the reason why I'm 
strong free speech advocate isn't test 

828
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:15,580
if I shouldn't have to defend myself for
such a foolish steak.

829
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:16,310
No,

830
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:21,310
please.
Thanks.

831
00:44:27,171 --> 00:44:27,350
What

832
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:29,180
freedom of speech,
first of all,

833
00:44:29,181 --> 00:44:34,181
freedom of speech isn't a cornerstone of
our is I don't think it's reasonable.

834
00:44:34,201 --> 00:44:35,034
You can have a debate about that and I 
think the reason for that is that free 

835
00:44:38,671 --> 00:44:42,250
speech is how people fake.
Now you might think you finished,

836
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:43,093
but generally you don't want to do is 
rehash temperamental prejudice is over 

837
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:47,604
and over again in your mind and you 
actually know that much until you write 

838
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:53,360
for other people or to the tarp that 
people could.

839
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:54,263
They make you think because your 
assumption is just going to be that 

840
00:44:56,541 --> 00:44:59,400
you're correct gen unless you've been 
really think and Hartland.

841
00:44:59,401 --> 00:45:02,580
Many people can think because it really.
It's hard.

842
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:03,563
In order to think,
you have to fragment yourself up into 

843
00:45:06,061 --> 00:45:06,894
multiple personalities,
each of which hold about opposing 

844
00:45:08,701 --> 00:45:09,534
perspective and then you have to let 
those opposing perspectives have a 

845
00:45:12,781 --> 00:45:15,210
battle in the theater of your 
imagination.

846
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,193
That's a very difficult thing to do and 
so don't confuse having your 

847
00:45:19,441 --> 00:45:20,274
idiosyncratic prejudices with thinking.
You have to be technically trained in 

848
00:45:23,611 --> 00:45:24,444
order to think and it's very 
uncomfortable and painful and so people 

849
00:45:26,461 --> 00:45:27,294
don't like it at all.
So generally what you do though the 

850
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:33,570
speed is that you put forth your view of
the world,

851
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:38,600
perhaps invest in internet you can,
but also loaded with your own prejudices

852
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:41,220
and biases because how in your ignorance
as well,

853
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:44,190
because you have to speak from your 
restricted perspective,

854
00:45:44,191 --> 00:45:47,850
knowing as little as you do know and 
with your personality,

855
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:52,350
you know first and foremost in your 
utterances and then other people correct

856
00:45:52,351 --> 00:45:53,184
you and hopefully you as you enter into 
a real dialogue whereby you can 

857
00:45:56,851 --> 00:45:57,684
transcend the your own bias limitations 
and expand the toolbox with which you 

858
00:46:02,131 --> 00:46:02,964
use to work in the world and everyone 
benefits from that and then you modify 

859
00:46:06,511 --> 00:46:09,780
your viewpoints so that they actually 
work better in the future because that's

860
00:46:09,781 --> 00:46:11,220
kind of what it means.

861
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,353
What it means to have a a useful and 
correct viewpoint is do you have a 

862
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:20,610
toolbox that is going to enable you to 
work effectively in the world?

863
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,850
And if you're too biased and too narrow,
too ignorant,

864
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,713
what that means is that your toolbox is 
only going to work and very narrow 

865
00:46:27,061 --> 00:46:29,880
environment.
If you go out into public and you hammer

866
00:46:29,881 --> 00:46:30,714
yourself up against other people,
especially those who don't agree with 

867
00:46:33,361 --> 00:46:34,194
you,
you could formulate the problems more 

868
00:46:35,641 --> 00:46:36,474
clearly.
You can discuss the possibility for 

869
00:46:38,881 --> 00:46:39,714
consensus and then you can negotiate an 
implementation strategy and the 

870
00:46:43,231 --> 00:46:45,900
alternative to that is that you're 
silent.

871
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:48,720
You're a slave or your retirement.
That's it.

872
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:49,583
We devolve into conflict and fighting 
and that's not a good idea and we don't 

873
00:46:53,401 --> 00:46:54,234
have to do it because we do actually 
know how to talk to each other and 

874
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:02,370
although perhaps we forget very 
frequently why we should have to know.

875
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,233
The other thing to think about is you 
know you don't exist just for who you 

876
00:47:06,901 --> 00:47:07,734
are.
Now.

877
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,680
You also exist for who you're going to 
be next week,

878
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:12,230
next month,
next year,

879
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:13,223
five years down the road and so on,
and so you're actually a collection of 

880
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:16,973
people that extends out into the future.
And so what that means is that you not 

881
00:47:20,101 --> 00:47:20,934
only have to get along with yourself,
you have to get along with all the 

882
00:47:22,951 --> 00:47:23,784
people that you're going to be,
and one of the ways to determine who 

883
00:47:27,241 --> 00:47:28,074
those people that you're going to be is 
to talk to other people around you 

884
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:32,973
because you're actually a collective 
that extends across time and in so far 

885
00:47:36,281 --> 00:47:38,170
as you're only speaking for yourself 
right now.

886
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:41,170
You're not speaking for yourself as are 
distributed across time,

887
00:47:41,171 --> 00:47:43,390
but if you talked to a bunch of other 
people,

888
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:47,470
then what you're doing is approximating 
yourself distributed across time.

889
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:48,483
So it's actually even in your selfish 
best interest to talk to a bunch of 

890
00:47:52,241 --> 00:47:53,074
other people because they did help you 
represent yourself better than you were 

891
00:47:55,661 --> 00:47:59,980
going to do it by yourself.
And then you know why we also say it

892
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:02,563
well,
there's other reasons that you want to 

893
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,540
be.
Want to talk to other people to get your

894
00:48:05,541 --> 00:48:07,970
toolbox in order,
because we might want to say to him,

895
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:08,660
well,
what do you.

896
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,660
What should you be aiming for in your 
life?

897
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,100
I can.
I can tell you that roughly speaking,

898
00:48:13,101 --> 00:48:14,990
if you're looking for something that 
will give your life,

899
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:15,770
meaning,
that's,

900
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:18,410
that's,
that's actually quite straightforward as

901
00:48:18,411 --> 00:48:21,010
far as I'm beginning to town.
This is where the Ios App,

902
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:21,853
it's so wrong that it's almost 
unbelievable and as far as I'm 

903
00:48:24,261 --> 00:48:26,480
concerned,
fundamentally they're just escaping from

904
00:48:26,481 --> 00:48:27,314
responsibility anyways,
even though they are perfectly rational 

905
00:48:29,331 --> 00:48:32,360
arguments for their nihilism.
It's like everything's meaningless.

906
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:33,650
It's like,
no.

907
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:37,430
First of all,
no pain is not meaningless.

908
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:38,713
You're never going to meet anyone who 
will tell you that their own pain is 

909
00:48:42,021 --> 00:48:42,854
meaningless,
so we can just forego the whole meeting 

910
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:46,100
was argument right off the bat.

911
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:48,370
It's like there may be no positive 
meeting advice.

912
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:49,243
We can have a discussion about that,
but south after the negative meaning 

913
00:48:52,311 --> 00:48:55,610
exists and everyone knows it,
and even someone who's in Archicad,

914
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:59,180
nihilistic to the core drug,
a spike through their hand,

915
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:00,223
they're going to get like that has 
meaning and since I've been an 

916
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:03,373
existential
and look at how people are instead of 

917
00:49:08,091 --> 00:49:08,924
what they say,
and they'll act out the idea that that 

918
00:49:10,551 --> 00:49:12,020
has meaning very,
very rapid,

919
00:49:12,021 --> 00:49:14,420
so we'll just go with that.
Now you might say,

920
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,090
well,
there's all sorts of now,

921
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:20,630
but that's not the kind of meaning that 
I believe doesn't exist.

922
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,090
I believe that only positive meaning 
doesn't exist,

923
00:49:23,091 --> 00:49:23,660
which is,
you know,

924
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,820
a little on the negative side.
I would say the beginning,

925
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:27,453
but I can understand that people have.
People can have a pretty directional 

926
00:49:29,811 --> 00:49:30,644
lights,
you know,

927
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:31,603
and you can easily get yourself in a 
situation where it seems like there's 

928
00:49:33,861 --> 00:49:34,694
nothing at all to your life except 
suffering and that's what happens to 

929
00:49:36,951 --> 00:49:38,830
people who become suicidal,
for example,

930
00:49:38,831 --> 00:49:41,150
and it's no joke and they have the 
reasons.

931
00:49:41,151 --> 00:49:43,530
Now you know,
sometimes those people have been hurt in

932
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:44,373
ways that are absolutely unimaginable 
and so when they see a horizon that's 

933
00:49:47,691 --> 00:49:50,810
full of nothing but suffering,
you can't just wave that away.

934
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,190
But I would say

935
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:59,970
the first thing we might hypothesize is 
that sending paid is an alternative fact

936
00:50:00,101 --> 00:50:02,850
of meeting and certainly seems to be 
negative,

937
00:50:02,851 --> 00:50:03,684
but one of the things you might want to 
try to orient yourself in relationship 

938
00:50:06,431 --> 00:50:09,210
to is the reduction of human suffering.
Now,

939
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:10,083
because I think that's the goal.
You know the answer to what do you do 

940
00:50:14,171 --> 00:50:16,840
about a child who stopped wearing in a 
concentration camp?

941
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:20,110
Is it who the hell is going to care in a
million years?

942
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,390
Right?
That's not the right answer,

943
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:25,210
and if it's not the right answer in that
situation,

944
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,170
then perhaps it's not the right answer 
at all.

945
00:50:27,171 --> 00:50:31,700
And the right answer to who the hell's 
gonna care anyways in a million years is

946
00:50:31,701 --> 00:50:36,440
why in the world when you frame the 
mistake that idiotically mean anybody,

947
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,333
anybody.
This is kind of a trick of the 

948
00:50:38,211 --> 00:50:39,044
imagination in some sense.
Anybody who's quick witted can come up 

949
00:50:42,141 --> 00:50:47,141
with a frame of reference that makes 
anything that makes almost anything lack

950
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:49,310
meaning within that frame of reference.

951
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,353
Well,
all that means to me is that you picked 

952
00:50:51,371 --> 00:50:53,210
a stupid frame of reference,
right?

953
00:50:53,211 --> 00:50:54,044
Why should you?
Why should you accept without doubt the 

954
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,304
consequences of your stupid algorithm?
Who's going to care in a million years 

955
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,920
gone?
Really?

956
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,540
You got to be able to do better than 
that.

957
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:07,280
If that's what you're going to wipe out,
meaning.

958
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:09,080
Well,
so what do you want from me?

959
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:10,550
Alright?
Reduced software,

960
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,250
that'd be a good one.
You could devote your life to that and I

961
00:51:13,251 --> 00:51:14,084
would say start locally and I think this
is the alternative to right wing 

962
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,730
nationalism,
which is too much order and chaos,

963
00:51:22,731 --> 00:51:23,564
which is too much chaos.
We don't want to go down that rabbit 

964
00:51:25,491 --> 00:51:26,870
hole again,
either of it.

965
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,153
So what's the alternative?
I thought about this for a very long 

966
00:51:29,841 --> 00:51:30,674
time.
It took me decades to come to this 

967
00:51:31,701 --> 00:51:32,534
conclusion.
The conclusion is just that you 

968
00:51:33,961 --> 00:51:36,860
straightened yourself out and you do 
that humbling.

969
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:38,780
There's this idea that the new 
testament,

970
00:51:38,781 --> 00:51:39,614
which I get quite a kick out of,
that you're not supposed to pray in 

971
00:51:41,961 --> 00:51:42,794
public.
It's a little more complicated than 

972
00:51:43,881 --> 00:51:44,361
that.
Actually,

973
00:51:44,361 --> 00:51:45,194
you know what?
I'm supposed to pray until you like 

974
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:49,400
sorted out the dispute that you have 
with your brother.

975
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:50,443
For example.
I really like that idea because what it 

976
00:51:53,001 --> 00:51:53,834
means is that you shouldn't make a 
public display of your virtue until you 

977
00:51:56,390 --> 00:51:57,223
straighten up your damn life,
and this is one of the things I really 

978
00:51:59,421 --> 00:52:00,254
don't like about protests and I really 
don't like the fact that university 

979
00:52:03,111 --> 00:52:03,944
students are tired.
They're halfway and professors that the 

980
00:52:05,631 --> 00:52:06,740
way that you changed your world.

981
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:16,530
Thank you.

982
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:20,583
You don't change the world by going and 
waving signs of that you've defined as 

983
00:52:23,931 --> 00:52:28,340
more evil than first of all,
the probability that they're more useful

984
00:52:28,341 --> 00:52:29,174
than you is actually quite low
because they may be you're in the same 

985
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,264
damn boat and if you divided the world 
up convenience so that you can identify 

986
00:52:39,111 --> 00:52:39,944
the innocent and the and the dam or the 
oppressor and oppressed and you think 

987
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:44,203
you're in the positive category,
then the probability that you're a part 

988
00:52:46,641 --> 00:52:49,850
of the solution and not part of the 
problem was zero.

989
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:52,830
So it's just not that easy.
You know,

990
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,800
in the most profound people that I've 
ever read,

991
00:52:54,801 --> 00:52:57,800
he said the same thing over and over.
It's like the line between good and evil

992
00:52:57,801 --> 00:52:58,634
runs down the middle of every human 
heart and the first thing that you're 

993
00:53:00,831 --> 00:53:03,380
supposed to do is with that bag on your 
own territory.

994
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:04,423
And that's bloody Joel.
That's a difficult thing to do because 

995
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:08,740
it means that you have to recognize 
that.

996
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:09,673
Recognize yourself as a perpetrator of 
gravy and that is what you are and 

997
00:53:13,971 --> 00:53:14,804
that's a terrible thing for me to learn.
You know when you look at the 20th 

998
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:18,860
century and you think,
well,

999
00:53:18,861 --> 00:53:22,490
who brought on the horrors of the 
communist systems and the horrors of the

1000
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:25,170
Nazi system is the answer is people just
like you.

1001
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,190
That's the answer,
but if you don't understand that and you

1002
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:33,191
think that answer is wrong,
then you're not very biased and it's not

1003
00:53:33,451 --> 00:53:36,300
surprising because the price that you 
paid for wisdom,

1004
00:53:36,301 --> 00:53:37,134
this is radically dissimilar.
Disillusionment and the confrontation 

1005
00:53:39,871 --> 00:53:42,840
with evil and no one wants that.
Really.

1006
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:46,560
It's a terrible thing to confront and 
that's because human beings are terrible

1007
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:47,580
or preachers.
Now,

1008
00:53:47,581 --> 00:53:50,880
I think we're also absolutely remarkable
creatures and wonderful creatures,

1009
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:51,753
but we have an unlimited capacity for 
brutality and evil and every one of us 

1010
00:53:56,011 --> 00:53:56,844
carries it,
and so what you do is you try to sort 

1011
00:53:59,251 --> 00:54:01,590
that out in your own life and you start.

1012
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:06,330
I haven't talked to me just a while back
about about his life.

1013
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:07,173
Haven't been going very well.
He decided to put himself together and 

1014
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:11,100
he started doing this little ritual 
thing,

1015
00:54:11,101 --> 00:54:15,330
which I thought was quite cool.
He was in this kind of an isolated guy,

1016
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:17,970
very overweight guy.
When I talk to him,

1017
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:21,060
he lost about 130 comments,
which was quite impressive for this part

1018
00:54:21,061 --> 00:54:24,450
of him putting himself together,
but he started doing it by bill.

1019
00:54:24,451 --> 00:54:25,284
He had a bunch of labels leftover from 
his childhood and the first thing he 

1020
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:29,064
did,
because he was feeling very nihilistic 

1021
00:54:30,091 --> 00:54:30,990
and hopeless,
he,

1022
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:32,043
he found that he got a little bit of 
satisfaction out of building little 

1023
00:54:33,991 --> 00:54:35,370
things on the blade bills,
you know,

1024
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,240
and I thought,
well that was pretty interesting.

1025
00:54:37,241 --> 00:54:39,450
And so he built a bunch of these things 
and then he said,

1026
00:54:39,451 --> 00:54:40,950
well,
I got a bunch of these things built.

1027
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:43,550
Then I had to figure out how to organize
them in the room.

1028
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:46,110
They were.
I thought that's cool because he started

1029
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:48,420
higher resolution at the level of 
detail.

1030
00:54:48,421 --> 00:54:49,254
You know,
what he was building something that was 

1031
00:54:49,891 --> 00:54:51,990
trivial.
He knew that he was just playing a game,

1032
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:54,420
but then as soon as he had a collection 
of those,

1033
00:54:54,421 --> 00:54:55,254
then you have to sort out the space that
he was going to organize them in many 

1034
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:58,160
figured out,
well,

1035
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:58,993
yeah,
just sort of the room that they were 

1036
00:54:59,701 --> 00:55:02,400
going to be in,
so we started organizing and beautifying

1037
00:55:02,410 --> 00:55:03,243
the room and at the same time he 
modified his diet and he was putting 

1038
00:55:05,521 --> 00:55:08,100
himself together and that's the right 
thing to do.

1039
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:11,130
That's the right thing to do is that 
there is.

1040
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,650
There are responsibilities that are 
awaiting you,

1041
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:14,693
right,
that are in your own grass and you know 

1042
00:55:16,501 --> 00:55:17,334
what they are.

1043
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:20,600
This is also something that no one can 
preach to you about.

1044
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:21,853
It's something you have to decide for 
yourself and you can do it quite 

1045
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:26,880
straightforwardly and it's something 
that I do on a regular basis.

1046
00:55:26,881 --> 00:55:27,714
You sit down in the or in the morning 
and ask yourself like you're asking 

1047
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:36,620
someone that you want the answer from,
like genuinely needed,

1048
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:39,840
want to have the entrepreneur telling 
yourself none of that.

1049
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:42,810
You're asking yourself,
right?

1050
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,673
There's a bunch of things about my life 
that aren't in order that aren't 

1051
00:55:45,751 --> 00:55:46,584
together and I know it and they're 
making me suffer and they're making me 

1052
00:55:49,141 --> 00:55:49,974
less than I am,
and there's some of those things that 

1053
00:55:52,021 --> 00:55:52,854
are staring me right at the face and I 
know what they are and there's some of 

1054
00:55:54,931 --> 00:55:59,430
those that I can put in order today with
a little bit of work so that when I wake

1055
00:55:59,431 --> 00:56:02,940
up tomorrow,
the domain of my experience,

1056
00:56:02,941 --> 00:56:03,774
which is basically being itself,
that the main point experience will be 

1057
00:56:06,721 --> 00:56:09,270
more pristine and better put together 
than it is today,

1058
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:11,850
and you asked yourself that you'll find 
right away.

1059
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:13,680
You know what they are,
five things that come up,

1060
00:56:13,681 --> 00:56:14,281
Bang,
Bang,

1061
00:56:14,281 --> 00:56:14,761
Bang,
Bang,

1062
00:56:14,761 --> 00:56:16,980
and they'll all be things that aren't 
very heroic.

1063
00:56:16,981 --> 00:56:19,350
They're kind of trivial and that you've 
been avoiding.

1064
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:20,723
You've been avoiding.
Those are little dragons of chaos 

1065
00:56:22,771 --> 00:56:24,070
though.
And you know,

1066
00:56:24,071 --> 00:56:26,230
they're just little.
That's good because you're not much of a

1067
00:56:26,231 --> 00:56:27,064
hero warrior and so maybe a little tiny 
dragons are all the ones that you've 

1068
00:56:29,311 --> 00:56:31,290
been put up.
You know,

1069
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:34,000
do search those things out and it'll.
First of all,

1070
00:56:34,001 --> 00:56:34,834
they will order your order,
the being around you in a more pristine 

1071
00:56:39,721 --> 00:56:40,554
and productive way and they can just a 
little bit more focused in together and 

1072
00:56:44,141 --> 00:56:44,974
what that would mean is that the next 
thing you can do is ask yourself the 

1073
00:56:46,931 --> 00:56:51,220
same question in the end of the problems
that will emerge will be slightly larger

1074
00:56:51,221 --> 00:56:52,054
and more complex,
and then you can try to put those in 

1075
00:56:54,761 --> 00:56:55,594
order and that will make everything 
around you more pristine and benefit 

1076
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,840
together and it'll make you a little bit
stronger and more clear habit.

1077
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:05,200
And then another set of problems will 
emerge that's a little bit larger.

1078
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:08,740
If you continue to do that,
you know you're asserting yourself.

1079
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:09,583
I'll clean up your room and you put your
house in order and then you could start 

1080
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:15,700
to work in the community and by that 
time you'll actually have some power and

1081
00:57:15,701 --> 00:57:16,534
some and some self confidence and some 
competence and some creaminess and 

1082
00:57:20,231 --> 00:57:21,064
they'll be much more,
much less likely to stupidly hit 

1083
00:57:23,021 --> 00:57:25,990
something complicated with the stick and
say that you fixed it,

1084
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:30,070
but you have to start low.
You have to be Carl Jung said,

1085
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:32,740
very uninteresting.
One is fairly interesting phrases.

1086
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:33,633
He says that the reason that monitor 
people can't see is because they won't 

1087
00:57:36,131 --> 00:57:38,300
look low enough.
I really liked that.

1088
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:39,653
I mean he is an extraordinarily wise 
person than what he meant by that was 

1089
00:57:42,071 --> 00:57:43,870
something like what I'm telling you,
this,

1090
00:57:43,871 --> 00:57:44,704
that the secret to your existence is 
right in front of you and it manifests 

1091
00:57:48,341 --> 00:57:50,350
itself as all those things you know you 
should do,

1092
00:57:50,351 --> 00:57:51,184
but you're avoiding because one of the 
things you might ask yourself this 

1093
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:54,173
curse,
you're useless and weak and miserable 

1094
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,000
and and cruel than all of those horrible
things,

1095
00:57:58,001 --> 00:58:01,240
but partly that's because you're also 
not what you could be an part of.

1096
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,240
The reason for that is not doing what 
you know you shouldn't be doing,

1097
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:07,480
so you might ask herself,
because this is a very interesting game.

1098
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:11,050
If you started doing the things that you
know you should do,

1099
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:13,720
this is a discussion with your own 
conscious.

1100
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:14,823
If you started doing those things that 
you know you should do and you did that 

1101
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:18,244
diligently,
what the hell would you be like at 10 

1102
00:58:19,721 --> 00:58:21,190
years?
Now?

1103
00:58:21,191 --> 00:58:22,024
That's an exciting game.
That's an interesting game and if you 

1104
00:58:25,781 --> 00:58:26,614
play that,
we'll find that you're a hell of a lot 

1105
00:58:27,401 --> 00:58:30,700
more than you were and that's something 
at least you might not hit the pinnacles

1106
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:32,650
that you're going to be a lot lower than
you are,

1107
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:36,540
and then if you're not leaking miserable
and wretched and sovereign,

1108
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:38,830
dismal and self pitying and all those 
things,

1109
00:58:38,831 --> 00:58:42,490
you're going to be a lot less resentful.
You're going to be a lot less broom.

1110
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:45,460
You're gonna be a lot less cruel to 
yourself and to other people.

1111
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:47,110
Well,
that's pretty good start.

1112
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:48,303
You know,
even if you're not a positive force for 

1113
00:58:49,301 --> 00:58:52,630
good in the world,
if you just weren't wretched horrible,

1114
00:58:52,631 --> 00:58:55,840
that would be a good additional 
contribution.

1115
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:59,790
No,
I would say too,

1116
00:58:59,810 --> 00:59:01,810
there's a corridor that goes along with 
that

1117
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:05,680
and I,
and this is so,

1118
00:59:05,681 --> 00:59:07,810
so,
so you could look at it this way.

1119
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,470
This is something that I tried to 
explain.

1120
00:59:11,471 --> 00:59:14,480
I did a video on Pinocchio,
couple of Videos About Pinocchio,

1121
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:15,993
which I've been fascinated by it because
it's a very good illustration in poplar 

1122
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:24,500
culturally of how archives manifest 
themselves and how people understand the

1123
00:59:24,501 --> 00:59:25,334
archetypes even if they don't know they 
understand them because it was a very 

1124
00:59:27,801 --> 00:59:30,860
interesting movie and think about it.
You know you,

1125
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:34,090
you might ask,
well,

1126
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,740
with modern people,
think about people going to church.

1127
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:37,573
They think,
how can people believe those 

1128
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:41,390
superstitions?
Fair enough.

1129
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:42,500
Question,
well,

1130
00:59:42,501 --> 00:59:44,460
what the hell do you think you be 
moving.

1131
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,570
What are you doing here?
Here you are.

1132
00:59:47,571 --> 00:59:50,480
You're probably on seem to Nokia,
but whatever.

1133
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:54,250
You're an adult,
you bring your five year old to see,

1134
00:59:54,251 --> 00:59:56,150
to know you.
You're just as interest is here,

1135
00:59:56,151 --> 00:59:57,920
so think about what you're doing.
First of all,

1136
00:59:57,921 --> 00:59:59,360
you know what?
Those are drawings.

1137
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:04,660
They're not real creatures or draws.
Second tuck wouldn't topic.

1138
01:00:05,871 --> 01:00:10,871
Who actually happens to one who is being
guided to cricket was highest goal is to

1139
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:16,080
sell for reasons no one can understand 
and somehow that makes it very turn them

1140
01:00:16,081 --> 01:00:20,210
into something that's real.
It's like that's strange people,

1141
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:21,243
right?
The fact that you're doing that is very 

1142
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:27,760
peculiar and it says something about 
what people are means that we understand

1143
01:00:27,761 --> 01:00:29,630
the things that we don't normally 
understand,

1144
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:33,500
and so now it's a very interesting 
movie.

1145
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,710
I can tell you what it's fundamental 
presupposition here,

1146
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:37,700
so I'll just guide you through it very,
very rapidly.

1147
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:40,790
So the beginning of the movie,
Japan,

1148
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:43,280
who's who's the archetype of the good 
father,

1149
01:00:43,281 --> 01:00:44,114
by the way,
which is an archetype that we've 

1150
01:00:44,871 --> 01:00:45,704
forgotten about.
It does exist because our culture isn't 

1151
01:00:47,451 --> 01:00:48,284
just a tyrannical patriarchy.
As you can tell by the fact that we're 

1152
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:52,963
comfortable with.
We're not tearing each other to shreds 

1153
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:55,303
at the moment,
which is what you do in a state of 

1154
01:00:56,571 --> 01:00:57,920
absolute chaos,
right?

1155
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:01,940
It's made freezing and starving,
right?

1156
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:02,993
And that is what one cap.
We have a piece and it's rare and it's 

1157
01:01:07,161 --> 01:01:11,240
amazing that we have and we shouldn't 
take it for granted because it's not the

1158
01:01:11,241 --> 01:01:12,074
normal order of things.
The normal order of things is 

1159
01:01:14,541 --> 01:01:15,374
destructive chaos and if you're 
fortunate enough to live somewhere 

1160
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,160
that's peaceful,
productive,

1161
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:20,413
you should thank your lucky stars every 
second of your life and if you don't do 

1162
01:01:23,241 --> 01:01:24,074
that,
all that means is that you don't know 

1163
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:25,543
anything about history and you know 
nothing about it because things can get 

1164
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:30,043
out supposedly monsters and it happens 
all the time and there's always a 

1165
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:33,104
fraction of the population thinks that's
how they like things to be and perhaps 

1166
01:01:36,351 --> 01:01:40,490
there's a fraction of you that's like 
two and I wouldn't nurture that fragment

1167
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:43,830
if I miss you,
unless you want to go where it will take

1168
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:44,693
you.

1169
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:46,790
Anyways,
back to

1170
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:51,910
no
thank you,

1171
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:59,750
and then you can tell that he's got a 
warm allison.

1172
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,820
It's full of toys and it's full of music
boxes,

1173
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:02,993
scar little kit and then these goldfish 
and he takes care of them and so he's a 

1174
01:02:05,791 --> 01:02:08,930
good guy.
It makes this pocket and then he puts us

1175
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:10,633
on the puppet announced the final act 
and the pocket kidnap his capacity to 

1176
01:02:13,891 --> 01:02:15,510
speak.
And that's what you want.

1177
01:02:15,511 --> 01:02:17,560
If you're a good father is you want to 
take your son,

1178
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:21,740
turn turning into someone who can speak 
right,

1179
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:23,303
who can speak his soul,
and soldier paddle puts a smile on his 

1180
01:02:27,001 --> 01:02:27,834
son's spaces as,
wouldn't it be wonderful if he could be 

1181
01:02:30,331 --> 01:02:32,940
a good boy?
Yeah,

1182
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,730
wouldn't it be wonderful,
right?

1183
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:36,200
Because that's what you do.
You're a good father.

1184
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:39,060
You think,
wouldn't it be possible with this puppet

1185
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:43,410
could actually become something genuine 
and independent with its own voice?

1186
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:44,783
While he says that sounds likely it goes
off to bed and then star appears up in 

1187
01:02:48,841 --> 01:02:51,330
the window to be wishes on a star and 
you think,

1188
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:52,230
well,
what does that mean?

1189
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:54,230
What does it mean to wish on a star?
It's like,

1190
01:02:54,290 --> 01:02:55,123
well,
the star is the light that that gets in 

1191
01:02:56,111 --> 01:02:57,060
the darkness,
right,

1192
01:02:57,061 --> 01:02:57,894
and it's something transcendent.
You go shopping to the night sky and 

1193
01:03:00,370 --> 01:03:01,203
it's.
It's inspiring whether you're religious 

1194
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,744
or not.
You're looking into the Internet while 

1195
01:03:05,161 --> 01:03:06,810
you make a relationship with the 
infinite.

1196
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:07,703
By wishing on a star,
you raise your eyes above the horizon 

1197
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:13,800
and point at the light that beckons in 
the darkness

1198
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,333
and you say,
I wish more than anything else that my 

1199
01:03:19,201 --> 01:03:22,350
son can become a real person.
That's what you do.

1200
01:03:22,351 --> 01:03:24,960
If you're a good for the employer may 
come into a slave.

1201
01:03:25,090 --> 01:03:26,280
You don't want to be a tyrant.

1202
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:29,850
You don't want them to be a puppet.
You want them to be something strong and

1203
01:03:29,851 --> 01:03:31,130
independent.
Also,

1204
01:03:31,160 --> 01:03:31,993
often over it goes out into the world.
He faces all these different moral 

1205
01:03:35,641 --> 01:03:37,530
problems.
He's armed with his conscious.

1206
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:39,910
It turns out to be a bug,
right?

1207
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,100
Well,
why?

1208
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:42,770
Well,
it's because things bug you.

1209
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:44,253
You know you're conscious bugs you and 
the reason that the conscience is 

1210
01:03:48,301 --> 01:03:49,134
jimminy cricket is because that's the 
same initials as Jesus Christ and 

1211
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:53,573
Jimminy cricket is southern US Slang for
Jesus Christ and no doubt the other 

1212
01:03:56,431 --> 01:03:57,264
mangers thought that was very commonly.
I'm not telling you that the bug is a 

1213
01:03:59,521 --> 01:04:02,160
very strange representation of Christ.
That's for sure.

1214
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:03,003
What would make it into a cricketer and 
he's also rather error prone into 

1215
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:06,173
movies.
So he gets the movie doesn't have 

1216
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:09,090
precisely the affordable Christian 
structure,

1217
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:10,313
but part of the reason this took me a 
long time to figure out too is that you 

1218
01:04:12,781 --> 01:04:14,820
have to have a dialogue with your 
conscience,

1219
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:18,660
but it has to be a dog because it's 
actually not 100 percent right.

1220
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:23,670
It has to be something that you build by
having a discussion with it across time,

1221
01:04:23,671 --> 01:04:25,860
and that's actually worth Mq.
With junior cricket,

1222
01:04:25,861 --> 01:04:26,694
as the movie progresses,
both the puppet and the conscience get 

1223
01:04:30,271 --> 01:04:33,790
wiser by begging themselves against the 
world and the pop.

1224
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:37,750
It has to resist the temptation of fame 
and celebrity.

1225
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:39,390
That's the first temptation,
right?

1226
01:04:39,391 --> 01:04:40,224
Because he's asked to be an actor,
which is an easy way to be celebrities 

1227
01:04:42,781 --> 01:04:44,080
like the Kardashians,
right?

1228
01:04:44,081 --> 01:04:44,914
It's,
it's established without responsibility 

1229
01:04:46,771 --> 01:04:47,604
or or competence,
and so that that exists and attraction 

1230
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:52,830
and then he's,
he's.

1231
01:04:53,070 --> 01:04:55,920
He learns that lying is a very bad idea.
Right?

1232
01:04:55,921 --> 01:04:58,050
That's what he's knows grocery as,
to get that sort of.

1233
01:04:58,051 --> 01:04:58,884
No.
And then he said he's asked to present 

1234
01:05:01,201 --> 01:05:05,190
himself as a victim of circumstances.
That's what the Fox and the coyotes.

1235
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:09,390
And when you decided that he's too ill 
to go back to school,

1236
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:10,283
they take them to pleasure it degrees 
trained to be a jackass that works for 

1237
01:05:12,841 --> 01:05:15,240
slavers into soul lines,
right?

1238
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:18,070
Not Bad for animation,
I would

1239
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:20,230
say.
And then at the end of the movie,

1240
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,153
he tries to go back home because he's 
terribly lost and he's half Jack asked 

1241
01:05:23,861 --> 01:05:26,360
because the people that pleasure island 
have told him,

1242
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:29,580
taught him to do nothing but break,
which I can help with

1243
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:33,550
offers or what would you.
What would you say is,

1244
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:36,010
is an appalling parallel to what's 
happening?

1245
01:05:36,011 --> 01:05:39,520
To educate people who are being educated
in modern universities,

1246
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:43,280
which are increasingly play houses where
you're taught to break in.

1247
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,600
Listen,
I can't listen to protest is just.

1248
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,770
It just.
It's just painful.

1249
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:52,870
Is this constant repetition of a soul.
It's nonsense.

1250
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:59,400
Thank chanted this because the 
protesters,

1251
01:06:05,291 --> 01:06:06,124
they're trying to convince themselves 
even more desperate than they're trying 

1252
01:06:08,261 --> 01:06:09,094
to convince them.

1253
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:15,040
So anyways,
Pinocchio goes back home,

1254
01:06:15,041 --> 01:06:18,570
half jackass and half again.
Then he tries to find his father.

1255
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:21,670
There's no going home right now.
Once you're an adult,

1256
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:22,543
it's your young adult.
You don't get to go back because there 

1257
01:06:24,641 --> 01:06:26,620
isn't anyone there that can tell you 
what to do anymore,

1258
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:27,903
and so they go and allocate those homes 
and his father isn't there and then 

1259
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:31,463
finds out that he has to go to the 
bottom of chaos itself to rescue his 

1260
01:06:33,701 --> 01:06:36,520
father,
and that's what we have to do it right,

1261
01:06:36,521 --> 01:06:37,354
because our civilization is in this 
state of crisis now is predicted long 

1262
01:06:40,061 --> 01:06:44,110
ago by people like Nisha Dusty Dustier,
and partly what you're trying to do with

1263
01:06:44,111 --> 01:06:44,944
you go to university is to go to the 
heart of darkness right to the place 

1264
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:50,170
that terrifies you the most and define 
your values,

1265
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:51,013
your culture really has,
and that's what it means to go down to 

1266
01:06:52,961 --> 01:06:54,050
the bottom of the desk.

1267
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:54,933
The thing that terrifies you the most,
integrative before your father to very 

1268
01:06:57,701 --> 01:06:58,534
little story.
The Egyptians were telling that story 

1269
01:07:00,221 --> 01:07:01,054
for a thousand years ago.
It's one of the oldest stories of 

1270
01:07:02,621 --> 01:07:04,890
mankind,
and so that's what you have to do.

1271
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,510
You and you united yourself with your 
culture,

1272
01:07:07,511 --> 01:07:10,510
so you're more than just a week and 
simple minded individual,

1273
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:11,373
right?
You dedicate yourself to the study of 

1274
01:07:12,761 --> 01:07:13,594
what's great about the past and you 
incorporate it so that there can be 

1275
01:07:15,881 --> 01:07:16,714
something to you and then you bring your
father back up to the surface so that 

1276
01:07:19,691 --> 01:07:20,524
the culture can see and live yet,
and then that makes you into a real 

1277
01:07:23,111 --> 01:07:24,300
individual.
Well,

1278
01:07:24,310 --> 01:07:26,410
that's the movie.
Well,

1279
01:07:27,370 --> 01:07:32,320
we watch it were captivated by it.
Now it's time to understand.

1280
01:07:32,321 --> 01:07:33,154
It takes time to understand that in an 
articulated and conscious map because 

1281
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:39,820
it's too late for us to be unconscious 
anymore.

1282
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:42,850
And so we have silla and shrimp.
This,

1283
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,160
we have the chaos of the left.
The left says,

1284
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:45,994
well,
we need to tear down structures because 

1285
01:07:47,261 --> 01:07:48,094
they press.
Obviously structures will press because 

1286
01:07:51,191 --> 01:07:54,910
something's good at the top of the 
structure and also good at the bar.

1287
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:55,803
So if you have any values dropped you,
it's going to privilege somethings and 

1288
01:07:58,630 --> 01:07:59,463
exclude others,
but if you scrap the value structures 

1289
01:08:01,301 --> 01:08:04,300
then there's nothing to live for.
So we can't do that.

1290
01:08:04,301 --> 01:08:05,134
That's just chaos.
And then the radical right says back to 

1291
01:08:07,451 --> 01:08:11,110
the nations like really?
You know,

1292
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:13,190
we went back to the nation a couple of 
times,

1293
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:16,160
so it doesn't really look that great.
Part of the reason

1294
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:19,070
for that is that the purpose of the 
nation isn't the nation.

1295
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:20,473
The purpose of the nation is to produce 
citizens who transcend and rejuvenate 

1296
01:08:24,351 --> 01:08:25,184
the nation and so the nation should be 
probably properly subordinating to the 

1297
01:08:28,641 --> 01:08:29,474
individual,
right to the divine individual for that 

1298
01:08:31,311 --> 01:08:32,144
map,
and that's what we figured out in the 

1299
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:34,484
West.
Now it is that we only figured that out 

1300
01:08:36,921 --> 01:08:37,754
in the west,
but so far we've been fortunate enough 

1301
01:08:39,171 --> 01:08:43,490
to put it into a reasonable practice in 
our political institutions and thank God

1302
01:08:43,491 --> 01:08:44,324
for that.
At least it's worked somewhere and we'd 

1303
01:08:46,671 --> 01:08:47,504
be completely foolish to give that up 
because look at what it's provided us 

1304
01:08:50,211 --> 01:08:53,960
with.
It's remarkable for free,

1305
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:55,153
as free as we can,
but that doesn't mean that we're happy 

1306
01:08:56,421 --> 01:08:59,090
because freedom and happiness are not 
the same thing at all.

1307
01:08:59,120 --> 01:08:59,953
But we did figure out that the state 
should be subordinate to the wisdom of 

1308
01:09:02,901 --> 01:09:04,160
the individual,
to the site,

1309
01:09:04,161 --> 01:09:08,260
and the wisdom of the individual puts a 
heavy responsibility on everyone.

1310
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:09,103
That mean to you.
Have to be the wise individual who can 

1311
01:09:11,181 --> 01:09:14,300
see at speed,
that's your job,

1312
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:15,433
and if you do that,
the thing that's so cool about that is 

1313
01:09:17,470 --> 01:09:18,303
you know you need a meaning in your life
that enables you to bear to the 

1314
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:23,390
suffering of their life without becoming
corrupted.

1315
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:25,153
That's the basic rule and you have to 
build yourself into something that you 

1316
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:29,414
can actually respect so that you can see
yourself bearing that terrible 

1317
01:09:33,831 --> 01:09:37,220
existential burden properly and then you
don't lose hope.

1318
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:38,253
Don't lose meaning because you can see 
that you're strong enough to stand up 

1319
01:09:40,851 --> 01:09:44,690
underneath that burden and then there's 
something about you that you can respect

1320
01:09:44,830 --> 01:09:45,663
and then maybe other people can respect 
that will help bring suffering in the 

1321
01:09:48,231 --> 01:09:49,064
world to an end and that will help 
people develop fully as individuals and 

1322
01:09:52,461 --> 01:09:53,294
that will enable us to avoid the 
dehumanizing rigid a stair I'll 

1323
01:09:59,121 --> 01:10:04,121
uniformity of the nationalistic left and
a hallway chaotic devouring chaos of the

1324
01:10:06,051 --> 01:10:09,350
radical left.
How about no

1325
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:12,460
the individual?

1326
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:16,460
That's the secret to the world and 
you're all individuals.

1327
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:20,780
You're all the secret to the world and 
then all you have to do

1328
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:28,420
to discover that is picked up in your 
damn responsibility.

1329
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:32,290
Stop listening to people who keep 
burdening you with rights.

1330
01:10:32,291 --> 01:10:37,291
How many Goddamn right steel?
Why do you need some responsibility?

1331
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:38,403
So pick it up,
open your eyes and learn how to make 

1332
01:10:41,411 --> 01:10:42,244
yourself articulate and that way the 
world will just send them to the series 

1333
01:10:45,611 --> 01:10:49,140
of health that it already descended into
in the 20th century.

1334
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:58,440
Thank
you.

1335
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:11,720
Well that's probably just as good a 
place as any to end.

1336
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,470
I think in principle we have time for 
questions.

1337
01:11:19,471 --> 01:11:21,080
Is that correct?
You?

1338
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:23,820
Okay.
So we'll start with you.

1339
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:27,740
Do you want to use the Mike?
Yeah.

1340
01:11:27,741 --> 01:11:28,574
Okay.
So I'd ask you to try to keep your 

1341
01:11:33,281 --> 01:11:35,100
questions relatively short,
so,

1342
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:35,993
so see if you can get them,
articulate it out to the point where 

1343
01:11:37,981 --> 01:11:41,730
they can be relatively concise.
So I'm weirdly you.

1344
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:42,603
We're talking about the idea that like 
when you see a distinction between 

1345
01:11:46,591 --> 01:11:50,310
gender and sex and like I'm not saying 
right,

1346
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:51,233
like you need are.
You said they are connected and I'm 

1347
01:11:55,381 --> 01:11:56,214
wondering like the idea that because we 
can find an example of a non connected 

1348
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:00,780
that means that they necessarily are 
connected,

1349
01:12:00,781 --> 01:12:04,320
like where does that idea come from?
It comes from wishful thinking.

1350
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:06,613
It comes from.
There's a deep question underneath that 

1351
01:12:08,401 --> 01:12:09,234
and the wishes that human nature for the
infinitely malleable and that the state 

1352
01:12:12,171 --> 01:12:14,610
will determine the direction that that 
malleability should,

1353
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:15,803
should take.

1354
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:18,180
That's the fun.
That's the unreliable.

1355
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:19,853
Now I suppose there's also a wish to 
some degree that we can all burst the 

1356
01:12:22,681 --> 01:12:24,460
bonds that define us,
you know,

1357
01:12:24,570 --> 01:12:27,660
in a particular way that you can ask 
yourself if you already want to do that.

1358
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:30,740
One of the things I see happening to 
young people that I think is terrible is

1359
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:35,750
that they're asked to abandon their 
identity before they even have one,

1360
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:37,343
and so then they turned to these group 
identities which are extraordinarily 

1361
01:12:40,051 --> 01:12:41,780
shallow or very,
very shallow.

1362
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:42,643
How important,
how are we going to get through life 

1363
01:12:44,071 --> 01:12:47,010
being a transsexual?
It's not an identity.

1364
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:49,950
I'm not saying there are no transexuals.
I'm not saying that,

1365
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:52,500
but you don't get through life as a 
black person.

1366
01:12:52,590 --> 01:12:54,480
You don't get through life as a white 
person.

1367
01:12:54,810 --> 01:12:57,690
You get through life by having a 
differentiated identity.

1368
01:12:57,810 --> 01:13:02,540
That's the toolbox that you use to 
interact with others and part of now,

1369
01:13:02,650 --> 01:13:03,483
part of that means that you have to 
accept certain limitations on who you 

1370
01:13:05,671 --> 01:13:06,504
are,
but you want those limitations because 

1371
01:13:08,041 --> 01:13:11,040
there's nothing worse than total 
freedom.

1372
01:13:11,870 --> 01:13:12,703
It's like you're dropped someone out in 
the ocean right in the middle of the 

1373
01:13:15,331 --> 01:13:18,420
ocean with no direction and you say,
you're free to swim any way you want.

1374
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:22,260
What are you going to do with that?
You're going to have an identity,

1375
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:27,860
so that's good.
Thank you.

1376
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:33,383
How about here?

1377
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:44,100
My blessing.
I just want to say

1378
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:55,730
thank goodness I'm actually a 
transplant.

1379
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:04,300
If you put English language,
orange,

1380
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:08,780
apple,
you think any of us could actually be.

1381
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:10,673
Well,
so the question is about gender neutral 

1382
01:14:12,191 --> 01:14:17,191
pronouns.
Do you think any of us would be here?

1383
01:14:18,820 --> 01:14:21,530
The issues that we're discussing would 
come up in another way?

1384
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:22,870
No,
because I think.

1385
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:24,053
I think everyone knows that whatever 
we're talking about has very little to 

1386
01:14:26,411 --> 01:14:31,411
do with gender pronouns mean and people 
have asked me why I chose deliver data,

1387
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:34,450
let's say on that particular amount.
And it's like,

1388
01:14:34,451 --> 01:14:35,284
well the answer to that is you have to 
pick some place that's actionable to 

1389
01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:38,910
stamp.
Right?

1390
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:39,933
And the problem with that is that it 
might be somewhat observed while you've 

1391
01:14:42,591 --> 01:14:43,690
been in a battle.
You know,

1392
01:14:43,691 --> 01:14:44,680
it's like,
well,

1393
01:14:44,681 --> 01:14:46,750
who cares if you take the next yard of 
ground,

1394
01:14:46,810 --> 01:14:48,370
why would you die over that?

1395
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:50,180
Well,
when you think about it that way,

1396
01:14:50,181 --> 01:14:51,670
it's fair enough.
It's foolish,

1397
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:52,863
but you have to make the abstract 
concrete before you can actually engage 

1398
01:14:56,111 --> 01:14:59,020
with it.
And so it just so happened that this was

1399
01:14:59,021 --> 01:15:01,170
the issue.
I do believe that if,

1400
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:04,180
if there were gender neutral pronouns in
English,

1401
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:05,043
then then this will just come up some 
other way because political correctness 

1402
01:15:08,250 --> 01:15:09,083
and the and the polarization between 
right and left were occurring long 

1403
01:15:11,831 --> 01:15:14,140
before this particular issue manifested 
itself.

1404
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,120
So
yes,

1405
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:18,053
with the glasses,
I'll repeat the questions and then 

1406
01:15:19,970 --> 01:15:21,670
everybody can hear them.
It'll be a little faster.

1407
01:15:22,710 --> 01:15:24,350
Just to start off,
are you familiar with?

1408
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,210
Yes.
Okay,

1409
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:33,360
great.
What do you think my medic period,

1410
01:15:33,420 --> 01:15:34,253
a usefulness is an understanding our 
components that go into how violence is 

1411
01:15:38,531 --> 01:15:40,150
created.
And then,

1412
01:15:40,190 --> 01:15:42,970
um,
can you offer some examples of combating

1413
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:46,870
or opposing the norm of scapegoating 
individuals?

1414
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:48,890
Uh,
uh,

1415
01:15:49,030 --> 01:15:50,790
because it correct,
uh,

1416
01:15:50,810 --> 01:15:53,680
and societies and social groups or 
strengthened into their violence.

1417
01:15:54,940 --> 01:15:57,600
Uh,
how do we drive the wedge between them?

1418
01:15:57,610 --> 01:15:58,443
No.

1419
01:15:59,070 --> 01:15:59,903
Well,
I think you have to escape the right 

1420
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:02,460
thing,
you know,

1421
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:04,720
because the reasonable level,
it's in the world.

1422
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:10,420
That's another thing that we've 
forgotten about in modern parlance.

1423
01:16:11,191 --> 01:16:13,620
You know,
I've talked about for a very long period

1424
01:16:13,621 --> 01:16:16,950
of time is my,
my colleagues tend to look askance at me

1425
01:16:17,130 --> 01:16:18,720
because they don't believe in such a 
thing.

1426
01:16:18,721 --> 01:16:19,680
And I think,
well,

1427
01:16:21,140 --> 01:16:22,230
well first of all,
yes,

1428
01:16:22,231 --> 01:16:26,160
you do believe in it whether you do or 
not.

1429
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:27,053
If you don't bring your heaviness end,
unless you're willing to say for 

1430
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:32,550
example,
I think it was unit seven,

1431
01:16:32,551 --> 01:16:33,384
nine one,
you guys who don't think distance of 

1432
01:16:35,461 --> 01:16:36,294
evil,
you go online and read about them at 

1433
01:16:37,341 --> 01:16:38,174
seven,
nine months and then you see what you 

1434
01:16:39,031 --> 01:16:39,864
think about that.
If I told you about this done in China 

1435
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:46,320
before World War Two by the Japanese,
uh,

1436
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:49,890
scientific investigative squads,
let's say,

1437
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:53,093
that's the sort of thing that the things
that were done by that unit were so 

1438
01:16:56,671 --> 01:16:57,504
terrible that I would not discuss them 
before an audience without a trigger 

1439
01:17:00,331 --> 01:17:01,164
warning,
because they would burn themselves into 

1440
01:17:02,881 --> 01:17:06,240
your imagination and you would never 
forget them for the rest of your life.

1441
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:09,030
And if you can invest,
I think it was 7:31,

1442
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:09,873
by the way,
if you can investigate that and come to 

1443
01:17:11,631 --> 01:17:13,580
the conclusion that there's no such 
thing as evil,

1444
01:17:13,650 --> 01:17:14,483
then that's fine.
You go ahead and live that way and just 

1445
01:17:17,391 --> 01:17:19,680
see how far it gets.
Um,

1446
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:21,673
so we need to localize malevolence luck.
And the other thing I want to tell you 

1447
01:17:24,741 --> 01:17:25,574
too,
is that people have encounters with 

1448
01:17:26,421 --> 01:17:27,254
malevolence in their lives.
And it often produces posttraumatic 

1449
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:31,303
stress disorder,
so very frequently soldiers develop 

1450
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:38,280
posttraumatic stress disorder,
not because of what they observed,

1451
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:39,653
what they observe themselves doing,
so they observe themselves doing 

1452
01:17:43,101 --> 01:17:46,670
something absolutely vicious on the 
front and they think,

1453
01:17:46,671 --> 01:17:49,550
where did that come from?
I didn't think that's who I was at all.

1454
01:17:49,551 --> 01:17:54,200
It's like you didn't think so because 
you were never in a situation like that.

1455
01:17:54,350 --> 01:17:58,640
You've never had a chance to reveal to 
yourself exactly what you were light and

1456
01:17:58,641 --> 01:18:00,350
then other people can develop.

1457
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:01,193
Post traumatic stress disorder are often
people who have been encountered with 

1458
01:18:03,771 --> 01:18:07,550
someone who is truly malevolent,
who really truly wanted to hurt,

1459
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:08,713
and there's no room in their philosophy 
of being for that sort of that sort of 

1460
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:12,913
event or action.
It just fragments them and they never 

1461
01:18:15,021 --> 01:18:16,790
recover.
They often never recovered.

1462
01:18:16,910 --> 01:18:20,630
They have to develop a fully fledged 
philosophy of evil in order to recover.

1463
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:22,013
Understand that there are people who are
malevolent and that malevolence exists 

1464
01:18:24,471 --> 01:18:25,304
in the world.
When you can put it on someone else and 

1465
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:32,240
even punish them for it and you can 
chase them away and then you can pretend

1466
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:36,230
that it's got,
but it never goes away and the right way

1467
01:18:36,231 --> 01:18:40,130
to deal with it is to find the thing in 
you that that into work,

1468
01:18:40,131 --> 01:18:41,960
to comprehend them,
to control it.

1469
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:42,913
It also,
one of the things that's very 

1470
01:18:43,611 --> 01:18:48,080
interesting about that is it also makes 
you extraordinarily tough if you do it,

1471
01:18:48,430 --> 01:18:51,340
and I can give you a pop culture example
of that.

1472
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:55,030
So Harry Potter obviously has an nmp 
right,

1473
01:18:55,031 --> 01:18:55,864
and that's voldemort and if you can't 
see the sale Christ and safety lurking 

1474
01:18:59,211 --> 01:19:00,044
behind those figures,
then you're really not using your 

1475
01:19:01,401 --> 01:19:03,410
imagination to any great degree.
There.

1476
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:04,880
Archetype will fingers.
Right?

1477
01:19:05,270 --> 01:19:06,103
And the thing about Harry Potter is that
the only reason that he can face photo 

1478
01:19:08,770 --> 01:19:11,960
artist because he's,
he's got a touch of evil inside of it.

1479
01:19:12,020 --> 01:19:12,853
It's embedded inside of it and that's 
extraordinarily useful to know that 

1480
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:21,260
because it's very useful to be a monster
or more importantly,

1481
01:19:21,261 --> 01:19:25,130
it's very useful to be able to be a 
monster because if you can be a monster,

1482
01:19:25,131 --> 01:19:27,710
you can stand up for yourself or for 
anything else.

1483
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:30,500
So the trick is to take that monster 
inside of me,

1484
01:19:30,501 --> 01:19:31,334
went to incorporate it into using it,
and then you don't have to escape to go 

1485
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:35,273
to other people and you can constrain 
the spread of eagles starting with 

1486
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:39,640
yourself.
And um,

1487
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:41,630
you know,
the people that you admire,

1488
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:43,820
whether you're men or women,
have exactly that.

1489
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:46,910
Ask it because women do not like armless
man.

1490
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:48,133
They like dangerous men who were 
civilized and men have no respect for 

1491
01:19:51,021 --> 01:19:51,854
armless man.
They like dangerous men who are 

1492
01:19:53,151 --> 01:19:53,984
civilized.
And so the trick for madness to turn 

1493
01:19:55,431 --> 01:19:58,170
yourself into a dangerous man.
Civilized.

1494
01:19:58,520 --> 01:19:59,353
And I would say that the most dangerous 
man is the person who can speak 

1495
01:20:03,021 --> 01:20:04,970
properly.
So I mean,

1496
01:20:04,971 --> 01:20:08,010
there's other forms of dangerousness.
There's nothing with physical products.

1497
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:09,373
There's nothing wrong with all of the 
multidimensional ways that you could 

1498
01:20:12,241 --> 01:20:14,730
learn to be dangerous.
But the highest,

1499
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:20,120
the highest order danger is articulated 
speech and wealth.

1500
01:20:20,610 --> 01:20:23,310
For all these reasons,
it's speech Buddhists in the world.

1501
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:27,090
And so get your scapegoats.
Right?

1502
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:31,483
So you think great deal of time talking 
about free speech and political 

1503
01:20:35,241 --> 01:20:38,040
correctness on campus in the United 
States,

1504
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:43,041
we see places like University of Chicago
stand against political correctness,

1505
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:46,583
free speech on campuses in Canada.
Would you say that our universities in 

1506
01:20:50,821 --> 01:20:55,800
particular and a particular university 
departments that have done a good job at

1507
01:20:55,801 --> 01:20:56,634
standing up for free speech and standing
up against political correctness on 

1508
01:21:00,910 --> 01:21:01,940
campus?
Well,

1509
01:21:01,980 --> 01:21:02,813
I would say Canada or the sort of 
question is that Jonathan Heit and his 

1510
01:21:06,781 --> 01:21:07,614
people at the end or the Arts Academy 
have attempted to rank order American 

1511
01:21:11,161 --> 01:21:15,240
universities in terms of their 
allegiance to classical ideals.

1512
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:18,720
Liking that idea of the people that 
enlightenment ideals or free speech free

1513
01:21:18,721 --> 01:21:20,520
discourse and the narrative social 
justice,

1514
01:21:20,521 --> 01:21:24,000
and they put the University of Chicago 
at the tall and I think brown was at the

1515
01:21:24,001 --> 01:21:26,270
bottom growing university or the talk.

1516
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:28,200
If you're thinking about social justice.
And then

1517
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:33,860
the question was,
what do I think about Canadian?

1518
01:21:34,740 --> 01:21:35,573
My answer to that would be Canadian 
universities have done such a good job 

1519
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:40,313
over the over the decade standing up for
free speech that everyone just takes it 

1520
01:21:44,491 --> 01:21:45,324
for granted,
but now it's come under threat and I 

1521
01:21:47,851 --> 01:21:51,570
think it's come under threat because the
postmodern movement,

1522
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:52,583
which basically started in the 19 
seventies in which is deeply nested 

1523
01:21:55,111 --> 01:21:58,530
inside of a matrix of Marxism and 
accountant.

1524
01:21:58,580 --> 01:21:59,413
The postmodernism themselves poses a 
substantial threat to the very idea of 

1525
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:05,550
free speech because they don't believe 
in free speech.

1526
01:22:06,430 --> 01:22:08,480
The postmodernist.
You got to understand these.

1527
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:11,790
The like.
I'm not saying that every social justice

1528
01:22:11,791 --> 01:22:12,624
activist is a committed postmodernist 
because most of them aren't educated 

1529
01:22:15,031 --> 01:22:20,031
enough to be that
by saying,

1530
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:25,313
I'm just saying that
it takes a substantial amount of 

1531
01:22:28,621 --> 01:22:32,310
education before you're the incarnation 
of the political philosophy,

1532
01:22:32,311 --> 01:22:34,530
right?
You have to do a lot of reading and so I

1533
01:22:34,531 --> 01:22:35,980
would say,
you know,

1534
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:41,180
Michel Foucault or Jacques Derrida that 
are fragmented up into their tiny little

1535
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:45,340
book suffers no equal pieces of 
voldemort soul,

1536
01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:47,623
and then they're distributed among the 
people who are possessed by that 

1537
01:22:49,890 --> 01:22:50,723
ideology.
So if you take a particularly someone 

1538
01:22:52,651 --> 01:22:55,230
who's hyper politically correct,
you'd say,

1539
01:22:55,231 --> 01:22:57,630
well,
95 percent of them is normal person,

1540
01:22:57,631 --> 01:23:00,360
that's five percent of them is like 
Michelle Foodco.

1541
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:03,480
It's the evil offspring of Michelle Fuco
and Jacques Derrida,

1542
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:06,370
and so,
but if then if you put 20

1543
01:23:06,370 --> 01:23:07,203
of them together and their mop and you'd
get the whole philosophy blasting 

1544
01:23:09,911 --> 01:23:10,744
forward,
happy.

1545
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:11,920
Well what?
What's,

1546
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:15,220
what is the philosophy?
The philosophy of commodity?

1547
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:19,120
It's quite straight forward from the 
postmodernist perspective.

1548
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:23,370
Value structures exclude,
which of course they didn't,

1549
01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:26,030
but they take it further.
They say,

1550
01:23:26,031 --> 01:23:26,864
well,
that's the purpose of abandoned 

1551
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:28,503
structures to explain.
So if you're an Italian structural 

1552
01:23:31,030 --> 01:23:32,060
hierarchy,
let's say,

1553
01:23:32,061 --> 01:23:35,950
and you have the top positions,
then you're privileged for doing that,

1554
01:23:36,190 --> 01:23:37,023
but the reason that that and that you 
fight for it is because of privileges 

1555
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:41,463
you and does have a part by excluding is
that know that's pushing it a bit too 

1556
01:23:45,071 --> 01:23:45,904
far.
So like value structure is excluded and 

1557
01:23:47,721 --> 01:23:50,770
they have because they're not 
instructors if they don't exclude.

1558
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:51,903
But to move from that,
to say that the only reason value 

1559
01:23:54,311 --> 01:23:57,620
instructions exist is to exclude is 
palpably observed.

1560
01:23:57,650 --> 01:23:58,483
Look,
if you're going to go get your brain 

1561
01:23:59,351 --> 01:24:02,230
operating on,
you're going to make it a presupposition

1562
01:24:02,231 --> 01:24:03,064
that there's a hierarchy of competence 
among brain surgeons that's independent 

1563
01:24:06,371 --> 01:24:08,800
of their desire for power at least 
partly,

1564
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:11,620
and you're going to look for the best 
brain surgeon just like you look for the

1565
01:24:11,621 --> 01:24:15,700
best auto mechanic or or if the best 
plumber for the best carpenter,

1566
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:16,773
anything that's worth doing by by by 
definition has a value structure 

1567
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:21,913
implicit in it,
and of course if there are good 

1568
01:24:23,351 --> 01:24:24,184
carpenters,
they're also people who aren't good 

1569
01:24:25,361 --> 01:24:26,194
carpenters.

1570
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:30,010
It's like prejudice to point that out.
It's not prejudice to point that out.

1571
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:33,310
They're just not good carpenters.
Luckily they might be able to be good at

1572
01:24:33,311 --> 01:24:34,144
something out well,
so most of our is that now I just 

1573
01:24:38,831 --> 01:24:39,664
dropped his excluded and that's why they
exist and then what we should do is 

1574
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:44,133
flat.
You are limiting things or more 

1575
01:24:47,351 --> 01:24:49,210
perversely,
I've been saying we should

1576
01:24:50,770 --> 01:24:54,610
know that this is where the marks of 
Marxism comes into it.

1577
01:24:55,090 --> 01:25:00,090
It's very strange,
intellectual slightly that your identity

1578
01:25:00,131 --> 01:25:00,964
is defined by your gender or your 
sexuality or what ever happens to the 

1579
01:25:03,911 --> 01:25:04,744
identity issue.
Do sure and and because you're 

1580
01:25:06,821 --> 01:25:07,654
identifying with that idea and other 
people are identifying with other 

1581
01:25:10,541 --> 01:25:11,374
identities,
there's no way of having a dialogue 

1582
01:25:13,361 --> 01:25:14,194
between them because well,
for the postmodernists dialogue doesn't 

1583
01:25:16,451 --> 01:25:19,420
even exist.
There's no way of developing a consensus

1584
01:25:19,421 --> 01:25:22,210
between groups that are predicated on 
different identities.

1585
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:23,253
The whole idea of consensus through 
dialogue is actually a trick that was 

1586
01:25:26,561 --> 01:25:27,394
generated by the people that you the 
most dominant positions and those are 

1587
01:25:30,791 --> 01:25:34,640
the fellows enter transitions that 
they're under always arm about.

1588
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:36,310
Well,
so.

1589
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:39,040
Well it's,
it's,

1590
01:25:39,041 --> 01:25:43,030
it's an interesting idea because value 
structures are prejudicial.

1591
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:46,420
There's no doubt about it and one of the
ways of thinking about that,

1592
01:25:46,421 --> 01:25:48,620
you think you're not prejudice.
It's not yet.

1593
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:51,550
You swimmed with anyone who asks you to 
you.

1594
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:52,453
Now,
some of you might say yes and ask very 

1595
01:25:56,021 --> 01:25:57,230
often,
but,

1596
01:25:57,780 --> 01:25:59,230
but,
but I make it very,

1597
01:25:59,350 --> 01:26:00,183
very straightforward.
The point here is that in our most 

1598
01:26:01,901 --> 01:26:04,010
intimate relationships were precisely 
most

1599
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:04,843
prejudicial.
You want to take that away from people 

1600
01:26:06,621 --> 01:26:07,454
or do you want to start knowing that 
certain kinds of prejudices and things 

1601
01:26:11,571 --> 01:26:15,580
that are desirable or valuable or 
actually being taken apart,

1602
01:26:15,710 --> 01:26:20,710
making intelligent choice so.
Well that was a bit of time for one more

1603
01:26:22,731 --> 01:26:24,720
question.
Okay.

1604
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:28,693
So according to what you said earlier,
you pointed out differences between men 

1605
01:26:33,351 --> 01:26:35,930
and women
and

1606
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:41,500
just following from what you said,
it stands to reason that different ideas

1607
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:45,200
are going to resonate more with women 
versus men in general.

1608
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:51,480
So I'll give you the woman studies and 
say seek help from therapists a lot more

1609
01:26:51,621 --> 01:26:52,454
than men do,
which allows me to positive or negative 

1610
01:26:55,161 --> 01:26:59,600
feelings you're experiencing and move 
through prices a lot better than me

1611
01:27:01,330 --> 01:27:03,140
on this.
Another.

1612
01:27:03,141 --> 01:27:08,141
Another advantage we have generally
trump dramatic

1613
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:14,290
sort of
crazy situations,

1614
01:27:20,150 --> 01:27:20,983
but to what extent do natural 
propensities legislatively versus 

1615
01:27:25,570 --> 01:27:26,403
correct?

1616
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:31,960
Absolutely valid.
Just because man is less likely to.

1617
01:27:34,490 --> 01:27:39,490
Doesn't mean that that's
just because of the woman's consent.

1618
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:44,640
Central
judge everyone.

1619
01:27:46,230 --> 01:27:47,890
Well,
it's very complicated question,

1620
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:49,283
but if
you listen to the central question is 

1621
01:27:54,411 --> 01:27:55,244
that given that there are differences 
between men and women that say to what 

1622
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:02,053
society is structured so that the 
negative consequences of those 

1623
01:28:04,761 --> 01:28:07,340
differences might be in this specific 
example,

1624
01:28:07,341 --> 01:28:08,174
it was perhaps that women are more 
likely to seek medical attention and 

1625
01:28:12,501 --> 01:28:13,334
psychological health,
which does happen to be the case and 

1626
01:28:14,841 --> 01:28:15,674
that that's perhaps beneficial.
What would it be better if family we're 

1627
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:21,680
more prone to seek help as well and they
have called.

1628
01:28:21,710 --> 01:28:22,543
We don't know,
but we could assume that might be the 

1629
01:28:23,721 --> 01:28:25,390
case.
Well,

1630
01:28:26,690 --> 01:28:28,450
let me just think about that for a 
second here.

1631
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:32,450
See if I can figure out how to answer 
that properly.

1632
01:28:35,870 --> 01:28:36,703
I think the way you started this by 
trying to figure out what the 

1633
01:28:38,391 --> 01:28:40,320
differences are first,
you know,

1634
01:28:40,350 --> 01:28:41,183
because I always think I'm very leery of
broad scale social solutions because I 

1635
01:28:45,021 --> 01:28:45,854
think there are so low resolution that 
they tend to cause more trouble than 

1636
01:28:48,171 --> 01:28:49,004
they than they.
They tend to cause more trouble than 

1637
01:28:50,781 --> 01:28:51,614
they forestall.
We're just at the beginning of starting 

1638
01:28:53,751 --> 01:28:56,750
to understand what the differences 
between men and women actually are.

1639
01:28:56,870 --> 01:28:57,703
You know,
like the Scandinavian studies that I 

1640
01:28:58,701 --> 01:29:01,320
talked about,
there are only about 15 years old and it

1641
01:29:01,321 --> 01:29:02,070
isn't,
takes about

1642
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:02,903
15 years for scientific information 
generally sort of leach out into the 

1643
01:29:05,701 --> 01:29:06,534
general public if it's going to do so.
And so the question to what degree the 

1644
01:29:11,251 --> 01:29:15,130
differences between men and women exist 
and to what degree the biological versus

1645
01:29:15,170 --> 01:29:16,003
sociological.
It's something that we're just starting 

1646
01:29:17,131 --> 01:29:19,620
to sort out the next question might be,
okay,

1647
01:29:19,621 --> 01:29:22,770
well what did we do in the face of those
differences?

1648
01:29:23,190 --> 01:29:26,340
And that sort of that is like I don't 
know what we should do about it.

1649
01:29:26,730 --> 01:29:30,030
I do think that we should,
we should for,

1650
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:30,893
for go the temptation to jump to 
premature conclusions and we have some 

1651
01:29:34,411 --> 01:29:37,230
real problems with this.
So one of the things that's happening in

1652
01:29:37,231 --> 01:29:38,064
many of you may have noticed it is that 
men are bailing out of the humanities 

1653
01:29:40,861 --> 01:29:43,080
and social sciences like map.
You know,

1654
01:29:43,081 --> 01:29:45,210
if you,
and this has been happening for about 15

1655
01:29:45,211 --> 01:29:46,200
years,
20 years,

1656
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:51,260
I mean overall enrollment in the 
humanities is declined substantially and

1657
01:29:51,441 --> 01:29:53,250
that's because I think most of what's 
being,

1658
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:58,200
and this is all simplified postmodern 
nonsense and it's very,

1659
01:29:58,201 --> 01:30:03,201
very hard employment and go there and 
they have whatever cherished assumptions

1660
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:05,610
they might have fragmentary as they are.

1661
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:08,550
They bring to a humanities class and 
have those demolished.

1662
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:09,393
It's like a giant hits your raft with we
have an emerging problem which is what 

1663
01:30:14,221 --> 01:30:17,520
we're going to do when there's no men 
left in the social sciences.

1664
01:30:17,521 --> 01:30:20,860
Is that actually going to work because 
that I'm not sure of the work.

1665
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:22,753
I guess we're gonna find out and then we
have the inverse problems say with 

1666
01:30:26,341 --> 01:30:27,174
regards to engineering and women.
Women don't go into engineering well 

1667
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:32,130
should it?
Well,

1668
01:30:32,131 --> 01:30:35,700
the first question might be who said 
that they should come in?

1669
01:30:35,701 --> 01:30:39,660
My sense is that what we should do is 
open up opportunities for people because

1670
01:30:39,661 --> 01:30:40,494
I think the idea of leveling the playing
field to the degree that's possible to 

1671
01:30:44,011 --> 01:30:44,844
equalize opportunity is a good one from 
a sociological perspective because you 

1672
01:30:47,791 --> 01:30:50,100
don't want talent to go to waste.
Now,

1673
01:30:50,101 --> 01:30:50,934
that doesn't mean that doesn't mean that
the way that's done commonly is 

1674
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:57,640
intelligent or appropriate because it 
often doesn't work at all,

1675
01:30:57,641 --> 01:30:58,474
but it is best if we can open up society
so that people can let their talents 

1676
01:31:01,471 --> 01:31:02,304
flourish.

1677
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:03,173
I would say we remove unreasonable 
prejudice to the degree that that's 

1678
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:07,223
possible.
When you do that by constraining it in 

1679
01:31:08,331 --> 01:31:11,690
your own life and then you let people 
make their own decisions and let us sort

1680
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:12,533
out the way it will.
And you know when you see that in 

1681
01:31:14,131 --> 01:31:17,970
Scandinavia,
so you have 19 female nurses to one male

1682
01:31:17,971 --> 01:31:21,570
nurse in 19 female engineers,
female engineers,

1683
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:25,380
or maybe that's okay.
Maybe that's all we don't know.

1684
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:30,660
I think individually people that so do 
we have time for one market?

1685
01:31:30,661 --> 01:31:33,460
We should be stopped.
I think we're just about to

1686
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:41,360
thank you.
