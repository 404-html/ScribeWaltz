1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,163
Hi everyone.
I'm going to talk to you today about a 

2
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:10,161
book that I'm publishing in January of 
2018 it's called 12 rules for life,

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,210
an antidote to chaos and it's going to 
be published by Penguin Random House.

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,063
I'm going to tell you how it came about 
first and then I'll describe the book's 

5
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:26,520
contents and then I'm going to read you 
a little bit of it.

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,383
Okay.
In 2012 I did a Canadian Broadcasting 

7
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,390
Corporation program called say no to 
happiness.

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,753
Um,
and in that program I critique the idea 

9
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:44,040
that happiness was the proper goal of 
life,

10
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,600
uh,
claiming it's dead,

11
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:49,530
that it's much more useful and 
effective,

12
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:50,723
perhaps even for producing happiness,
to look for meaning and responsibility 

13
00:00:55,351 --> 00:00:56,640
in life.
Anyways,

14
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,150
I received the following email as a 
consequence.

15
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,423
Dear Dr. Peterson,
your comments on the CBC program say no 

16
00:01:06,271 --> 00:01:07,104
to happiness.
We're both thought provoking and 

17
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:09,264
challenging.
They had me asking bigger questions and 

18
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,560
that has always tremendously appealing.

19
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,083
To be perfectly honest.
Some aspects were harder for me to 

20
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:20,190
understand that others,
but I was left wanting to know more.

21
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:21,743
Have you considered writing a book?
For a general rather than academic 

22
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:29,640
reader.
I'm a literary agent and Co owner at the

23
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,473
Cook Agency.
We have experienced with academics 

24
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:33,540
interested in writing for a broad 
audience,

25
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:34,613
working with them to remove the 
scaffolding that required an academic 

26
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:40,110
writing and helping to make their work 
more accessible.

27
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,640
We specialize in selling authors to 
international markets and developing the

28
00:01:44,641 --> 00:01:45,474
writing careers.
You can find out more about us at www 

29
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:51,030
dot cooke agency dot.
Ca.

30
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,750
I look forward to hearing from you,
sally harding.

31
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,770
So a literary agent represents an author
and attempts to market their books.

32
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:06,720
And so there they can be extraordinarily
useful people and in return for that,

33
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:07,554
they get a percentage of the book's 
profits and that's how they make their 

34
00:02:10,651 --> 00:02:10,980
living.

35
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,813
So it's a difficult job,
especially now because the market for 

36
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:19,701
books is while very complicated and 
increasingly restricted,

37
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:22,860
I would say to a few extremely 
successful authors.

38
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,293
Anyways,
Sally got Ahold of me and I had thought 

39
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:28,284
about for a long time about writing a 
more popular version of my first book 

40
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:33,534
called maps of meaning.
And I actually produced almost a 

41
00:02:36,541 --> 00:02:38,170
complete manuscript.
Uh,

42
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,023
that was,
uh,

43
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,020
uh,
let's call it a,

44
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:45,870
a simplified version or I wouldn't say 
simplified exactly more.

45
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,200
Well I tried to make it more accessible 
but I didn't,

46
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:51,810
it was never really happy with it.
I never really felt that it,

47
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,440
that it got its legs underneath the tie 
suppose.

48
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,293
Um,
and maybe that's because I was 

49
00:02:56,941 --> 00:02:58,920
duplicating something that I'd already 
done.

50
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,093
I was thinking very hard about what to 
do about this and how I might approach 

51
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:03,994
it because sally was interested in,
I thought it might be a good thing to 

52
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:11,020
try to write a book for,
for a more general audience.

53
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,723
And uh,
we talked for awhile and we discussed a 

54
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:21,540
few ideas.
This was back in 2012 and uh,

55
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,910
I mentioned to her that I had written 
something for quora,

56
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:25,803
which is an

57
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,930
online,
uh,

58
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,033
website obviously where anybody can post
any question and anyone can answer it 

59
00:03:34,411 --> 00:03:39,411
and then the questions are voted on and 
a chorus quite interesting I would say.

60
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:40,943
And I had written a variety of out just 
cause I was playing around with it and 

61
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,953
some of them as it always is,
tracked it much more attention than 

62
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:50,490
others.
Um,

63
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,383
and

64
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,110
okay,

65
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:52,943
somebody posted,
I think it was a young guy posted this 

66
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:55,734
question,
what are the most valuable things 

67
00:03:56,941 --> 00:04:00,510
everyone should know?
And so I answered it.

68
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,433
I listed as it was 40,
42 rules to live by and some of them 

69
00:04:05,461 --> 00:04:06,294
were kind of amusing.
I thought some of them were dead 

70
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,840
serious.
And anyways,

71
00:04:09,841 --> 00:04:14,841
it became very popular on Quora and as 
of now it has 174,000 views and 2,500 up

72
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,124
votes,
which makes it one of chorus most pop 

73
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,100
popular answers.
How's,

74
00:04:23,101 --> 00:04:25,620
it was soon after I posted it and I 
thought,

75
00:04:25,621 --> 00:04:26,454
well people really like those rules.
There was something about them that 

76
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:31,134
appealed to them.
So what if I write a book based on the 

77
00:04:33,211 --> 00:04:35,880
rules?
And so I'll read you the rules.

78
00:04:35,881 --> 00:04:37,850
Okay.
But maybe you'll find them interesting.

79
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:45,370
Tell the truth.
Do not do things that you hate.

80
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:46,660
Okay.

81
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,493
Which I think is a variant of telling 
the truth because you have to act out 

82
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:54,880
the truth as well as telling it,
act so that you can tell the truth about

83
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:57,370
how you act.
That's obviously related to the first to

84
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,250
pursue what is meaningful,
not what is expedient.

85
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,613
If you have to choose,
be the one who does things instead of 

86
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:08,410
the one who is seen to do things.

87
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:09,880
Okay.

88
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,713
Pay Attention.
I assume that the person you are 

89
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:16,240
listening to might know something you 
need to know.

90
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,330
Listen to them hard enough so that they 
will share it with you.

91
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,520
Plan and work diligently to maintain the
romance in your relationships.

92
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:26,590
Okay.

93
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,590
Be careful who you share good news with.
Be careful who you share bad news with.

94
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,570
Make at least one thing better every 
single place you go.

95
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,160
Okay.

96
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,790
Imagine who you could be and then aimed 
singlemindedly at that.

97
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,900
Do not allow yourself to become arrogant
or resentful.

98
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,160
Yeah.

99
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,220
Try to make one room in your house is 
beautiful as possible.

100
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:52,690
Yeah.

101
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,940
Compare yourself to who you were 
yesterday,

102
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,103
not to who someone else's today.
Work as hard as you possibly can on at 

103
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:05,891
least one thing and see what happens if 
old memories still make you cry,

104
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:11,640
right them down carefully and completely
maintain your connections with people.

105
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,490
Do not carelessly denigrate social 
institutions are artistic achievement.

106
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:18,920
Okay?

107
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,420
Treat yourself as if you were someone 
that you are responsible for helping.

108
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,573
Ask someone to do you a small favor so 
that he or she can ask you to do one in 

109
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:30,074
the future.
Make friends with people who want the 

110
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:33,794
best for you.
Do not try to rescue someone who does 

111
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:42,450
not want to be rescued and be very 
careful about rescuing someone who does

112
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,820
nothing.
Well done is insignificant.

113
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:48,890
Okay?

114
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,640
Set your house in perfect order before 
you criticize the world.

115
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:59,030
Dress like the person you want to be.
Be Precise in your speech.

116
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,770
Stand up straight with your shoulders 
back.

117
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:05,630
Okay.

118
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,463
Don't avoid something frightening if it 
stands in your way and don't do 

119
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:11,480
unnecessarily dangerous things.

120
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:25,110
[inaudible] [inaudible]
yeah.

121
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,830
Do you know how to let your children do 
anything that makes you dislike them?

122
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,600
Do not transform your wife into a maid.

123
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,000
Okay?

124
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,970
Do not hide unwanted things in the fog.

125
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:33,720
Yeah.

126
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:38,340
Notice that opportunity lurks where 
responsibility has been abdicated.

127
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:39,810
Okay.

128
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,150
Read something written by someone.
Great.

129
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,380
Pet a cat.
When you encounter what on the street.

130
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,950
Don't bother children when they're 
skateboarding.

131
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,300
Okay?

132
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,110
Don't let bullies get away with it.
Write a letter.

133
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,063
The government,
if you see something that needs fixing 

134
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:58,763
and propose a solution,
remember that what you do not yet know 

135
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,133
is more important than what you already 
know and be grateful in spite of your 

136
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:12,921
suffering.
So those were the 40 odd rules and uh,

137
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:18,360
people were pretty happy with them.
And then something odd happened.

138
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:19,194
So a friend of mine as a novelist,
Gregg Hurwitz and Greg wrote a book 

139
00:09:23,821 --> 00:09:25,990
that's become very popular,
uh,

140
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,920
called orphan x.
And one of the characters in that book,

141
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:29,754
the female lead,
I would say off and on again wrote 

142
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,520
romance interest for the main character,
posted these rules on her fridge.

143
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,890
And so they were peppered throughout the
book.

144
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,370
So that was kind of an interesting 
development,

145
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:48,420
I thought.
And then because they were so popular on

146
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,000
Quora,
I talk to sally about the possibility of

147
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,320
turning them into a book.

148
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,520
And so my original vision was to write 
42 short essays.

149
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,743
I thought that would be,
I was going to call the book 42 which I 

150
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:04,770
thought was quite funny because if you 
remember the answer to life,

151
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:09,771
the universe and everything from Douglas
Adams was 42 a computer calculated that.

152
00:10:10,681 --> 00:10:14,160
So I thought it would be amusing to 
write a book called 42 that,

153
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,470
you know,
contained answers to life,

154
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:19,620
the universe and everything.
But when I started writing the book,

155
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,483
um,
it turned out that I had more to say 

156
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:27,210
about each of the rules than I had 
originally envisioned.

157
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:32,450
And so I first cut it down to 25 and 
wrote some essays and then I cut it down

158
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:37,080
to 16 and it was still too long.
And then I cut it down to 12,

159
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:39,930
which turned out to be a good thing 
anyways because if you write a book,

160
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,943
you should write way more than you're 
going to publish and then cut because 

161
00:10:44,251 --> 00:10:46,890
that way you,
you're only left with what's best.

162
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,700
So anyways,
I wrote for about three years.

163
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,581
While,
no,

164
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:56,880
it's more than that now.
I guess it's almost five years because I

165
00:10:56,881 --> 00:10:57,714
just finished the book in September,
so it took about four or five years to 

166
00:11:01,771 --> 00:11:02,604
write and I was riding pretty regularly.
What I'm going to do is read to you a 

167
00:11:06,451 --> 00:11:09,450
little bit of it.
I think this is the book here

168
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,173
that's a galley copy and a galley copy 
is a preprint of a book so that you can 

169
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,390
get some sense of what it looks like.
It's got some nice illustrations in it,

170
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,010
I think by this comic book author named 
Ethan Van Scriber.

171
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,550
So that's kind of a rough one.
Uh,

172
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,043
on the chapter three,
treat yourself like someone you are 

173
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:37,590
responsible for helping.
Ethan is a comic book artist.

174
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,453
He's done a,
he's a great illustrator and he put my 

175
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:43,260
kids in,
each one of my kids.

176
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:47,520
I have two kids,
one of them in each illustration sort of

177
00:11:47,521 --> 00:11:51,750
contemplating,
well the complexities of life,

178
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:53,770
I guess that's how you might describe 
it.

179
00:11:53,771 --> 00:11:56,080
So that's one illustration.
I'll show you another one.

180
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,253
So that's my son Julian there looking up
at the great statue of David and that's 

181
00:12:03,371 --> 00:12:06,640
part and the David of course is an 
inspirational statue.

182
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:07,474
It's a representation of what you could 
be and that's real three make friends 

183
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:14,740
with people who want the best for you.
And I think I'm going to read that,

184
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:18,040
some of that to you right now.
The each chapter,

185
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,870
each rule is divided into subsections.
Small sub chapters let's say.

186
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:25,290
And um,
I'll read you one of those.

187
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,300
You'll get some sense of the book.
Rule three,

188
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,470
make friends with people who want the 
best for you.

189
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,373
The old hometown,
the town I grew up in had been scraped 

190
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:42,610
only 50 years earlier out of the endless
flat northern prairie.

191
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,140
Fairview,
Alberta was part of the frontier and had

192
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:47,974
the cowboy bars to prove it.
The Hudson's Bay company department 

193
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:54,400
store on Main Street still bought 
beaver,

194
00:12:54,401 --> 00:12:57,490
wolf and coyote first directly from the 
local troppers.

195
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:03,090
3000 people lived there 400 miles away 
from the nearest city cable TV,

196
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,960
video games,
and Internet did not exist.

197
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,760
It was no easy matter to stay innocently
amused at fairview,

198
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,103
particularly during the five months of 
winter when long stretches of 40 below 

199
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:20,680
days and even colder nights where the 
norm,

200
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:25,120
the world's a different place when it's 
cold like that.

201
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,960
The drugs in our town ended their sad 
lives early.

202
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,333
They passed out in snow.
Banks at three in the morning froze to 

203
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:33,874
death.
You don't go outside casually when it's 

204
00:13:36,221 --> 00:13:37,054
40 below on first breath,
the arid desert air constricts your 

205
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:46,540
lungs ice forms on your eyelashes and 
they stick together.

206
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,213
Long hair wet from the shower,
freezes solid and then stands on and 

207
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:57,130
wraith like of its own accord.
Later in a warm house when it thaws bone

208
00:13:57,131 --> 00:14:02,131
dry charged with electricity.
Children only put their tongues on steel

209
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:03,694
playground equipment once
smoked from house chimneys doesn't rise 

210
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:10,143
defeated by the cold.
It drifts downwards and collects like 

211
00:14:13,271 --> 00:14:18,271
fog on snow covered rooftops in yards.
Cars must be plugged in at night.

212
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,463
Their engines warmed by block heaters or
oil will not flow through them in the 

213
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:29,281
morning and they won't start.
Sometimes they won't anyways.

214
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,933
Then you turn the engine over 
pointlessly until the starter clatters 

215
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:34,324
and fall silent.
Then you remove the frozen battery from 

216
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:42,541
the car loosening bolts with stiffening 
fingers in the intense cold and bring it

217
00:14:42,671 --> 00:14:43,504
into the house.
It sits there sweating for hours until 

218
00:14:47,381 --> 00:14:48,214
it warms enough to hold a decent charge.
You're not going to see out of the back 

219
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,260
window of your car either.

220
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:59,570
It silver in November and stays that way
until may scraping it off,

221
00:14:59,571 --> 00:15:03,530
just dampens the upholstery.
Then that freezes too

222
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,400
late.
One night going to visit a friend,

223
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,263
I sat for two hours on the edge of the 
passenger seat in a 1970 dodge 

224
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:13,094
challenger jammed up against the stick 
shift using a vodka soaked rag to keep 

225
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:19,094
the inside of the front windshield clear
in front of the driver because the car 

226
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:26,000
heater had quit.
Stopping wasn't an option.

227
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:30,980
There was nowhere to stop and it was 
hell on house cats,

228
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,203
felines and fairview had short ears and 
tails because they had lost the tips of 

229
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:40,370
both to frostbite.
They came to resemble Arctic foxes,

230
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,400
which evolved those features to deal 
proactively with the intense cold.

231
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,580
One day our cat got outside and no one 
noticed.

232
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,420
We found him later for frozen fast to 
the cold,

233
00:15:53,421 --> 00:15:54,680
hard concrete.

234
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:58,430
It's no lasting damage except to his 
pride.

235
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,833
Fairview cats.
We're also at great risk in the winter 

236
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,270
from cars,
but not for the reasons you think.

237
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,680
It wasn't automobile sliding on icy 
roads and running them over.

238
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:10,603
Only loser cats died that way.
It was cars parked immediately after 

239
00:16:15,081 --> 00:16:15,914
being driven that were dangerous.
A frigid cat might think highly of 

240
00:16:19,221 --> 00:16:22,160
climbing up under such a vehicle and 
sitting on.

241
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:22,994
It's still warm engine block,
but what if the driver decided to use 

242
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:31,640
the car again before the engine cool 
down and the cat departed?

243
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,463
Let's just say that heat seeking house 
pets and rapidly rotating radiator fans 

244
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,833
do not coexist happily
because we were so far north that 

245
00:16:43,581 --> 00:16:47,990
bitterly cold winters were very dark by 
December.

246
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:53,110
The son didn't rise until 10:00 AM we 
trudge to school in the pitch black.

247
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:57,590
It wasn't much lighter when we walked 
home just before the early sunset.

248
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,790
There wasn't much for young people to do
in fairview even in the summer.

249
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:07,450
But the winters were worse than your 
friends mattered more than anything.

250
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,110
So that's a little section of 12 rules 
for life.

251
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:16,820
I can tell you what the rules are.
A foreword was written by Norman Doidge.

252
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:17,923
He comments a little bit about the 
political turmoil that surrounded me 

253
00:17:21,411 --> 00:17:22,244
over the last year.
Although the book itself is very 

254
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:28,670
apolitical with the exception of the 
chapter on Skateboarding,

255
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,000
uh,
where I go into the battle,

256
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:32,834
the ongoing polarizing battle between I 
would say the radical left and everyone 

257
00:17:36,471 --> 00:17:37,304
else.
Uh,

258
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:41,090
but other than that,
it's not a political book.

259
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:45,440
So the table of contents include rule 
one,

260
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,080
stand up straight with your shoulders 
back.

261
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:52,800
That's actually a bit of a story that 
centers on lobsters to a large degree.

262
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:53,970
I,
I have,

263
00:17:53,971 --> 00:17:54,804
uh,
what proclivity for talking about 

264
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:02,451
lobsters rule to treat yourself like 
someone you are responsible for helping.

265
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:07,170
That's something that people don't do 
very well because they're not very happy

266
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:08,370
with themselves.
Often.

267
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,013
Rule three,
make friends with people who want the 

268
00:18:12,361 --> 00:18:15,570
best for you.
That's the chapter I already read that.

269
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,613
I read the first part of that and it's 
about trying to organize your life so 

270
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:22,614
that you're surrounded by people who 
support you when you're trying to do 

271
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:27,234
what's right.
It's very important rule for compare 

272
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:31,944
yourself to who you were yesterday and 
not too who someone else is today have 

273
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,030
because if you're comparing yourself to 
someone else,

274
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,283
I mean first of all,
you don't know very much about the life 

275
00:18:42,691 --> 00:18:44,490
of the person you're comparing yourself 
to.

276
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:48,600
You don't know and it it no what across 
all of its dimensions and second,

277
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,960
people are very different and so 
comparing yourself to someone else,

278
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,110
it's kind of useful I guess when you're 
young,

279
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:57,990
but as you get older and more singular 
and more particular,

280
00:18:57,991 --> 00:19:01,140
it becomes increasingly less useful.

281
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,453
Better to compare yourself to a previous
version of yourself and work for 

282
00:19:05,191 --> 00:19:09,450
improvement in that way.
Rule Five,

283
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,900
do not let your children do anything 
that makes you dislike them.

284
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:15,840
That's probably going to be the most 
controversial chapter.

285
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:20,841
I would say.
It's a chapter about discipline and love

286
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,990
and respect.
I guess that's probably right.

287
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:30,240
Rural six set your house in perfect 
order before you criticize the world.

288
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,280
Yeah.
Well that's a rough chapter,

289
00:19:32,281 --> 00:19:33,480
man,
that,

290
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:37,380
uh,
I'm trying to explain the mindset behind

291
00:19:37,381 --> 00:19:40,470
people like the columbine high school 
shooters,

292
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:44,250
and so it's a,
it's a harsh chapter.

293
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,533
Rule seven,
pursue what is meaningful and not what 

294
00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:48,744
is expedient.
Expedient is what works in the short 

295
00:19:51,511 --> 00:19:54,030
term expedience.
What's easy,

296
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,710
meaningful instead is what sustains you 
through tragedy.

297
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:03,830
Let's say rule eight tell the truth or 
at least don't lie.

298
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:05,701
Yeah.
Well,

299
00:20:05,701 --> 00:20:09,030
it's not that easy to tell the truth 
because who knows about the truth,

300
00:20:09,031 --> 00:20:12,930
but you can learn not to say things that
you know to be false.

301
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:16,200
And if you stop saying things that you 
know to be false,

302
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:17,034
then your life will improve the lot.
It's simplifies it and it puts you into 

303
00:20:20,571 --> 00:20:21,404
alignment with reality and you should be
in alignment with reality because 

304
00:20:24,481 --> 00:20:26,490
there's a lot more of it than there is a
view.

305
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:28,583
Rule nine assume that the person you're 
listening to might know something you 

306
00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:35,610
don't.
That's a good one because,

307
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:36,743
and this is even true when you're 
dealing with people that don't like you 

308
00:20:39,061 --> 00:20:43,140
because they may offer you criticisms 
that are valid.

309
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,060
Now,
many that aren't too of course,

310
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:47,470
because maybe they're just trying to 
take you down a bit.

311
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:52,890
But if you get a criticism that is valid
and then you can fix that error,

312
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:54,094
let's say that'll stop you from running 
nose first into walls and that's 

313
00:20:57,731 --> 00:21:02,731
generally a handy thing.
Rule 10 be precise in your speech.

314
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,203
Yeah,
well you have to be exacting in the way 

315
00:21:06,491 --> 00:21:07,324
that you described things and the way 
that you think because otherwise you 

316
00:21:09,941 --> 00:21:10,774
live in the fog and you won't get what 
you should out of life or what you need 

317
00:21:14,801 --> 00:21:18,760
out of life.
And by need I mean what will sustain you

318
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:21,070
so that you don't become bitter and 
resentful.

319
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:26,470
Rule 11 do not bother children when 
they're skateboarding.

320
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,873
So that chapter's about,
I would say our society's hyper 

321
00:21:31,901 --> 00:21:32,734
concerned with safety and its 
fundamental antagonism to exploratory 

322
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,130
behavior,
especially among boys.

323
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,750
Rural 12 pet a cat.
When you encounter one on the street.

324
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,333
Yeah.
Well that's about trying to orient 

325
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:50,674
yourself towards life so that even when 
you're in the middle of a crisis or a 

326
00:21:54,311 --> 00:21:55,144
tragedy,
you can find bits and pieces of 

327
00:21:58,841 --> 00:21:59,674
experience that are positive and 
sustaining so that you can stay 

328
00:22:05,501 --> 00:22:10,180
positively oriented towards your own 
existence and towards existence itself.

329
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,350
So anyways,
that's the book

330
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,690
and it's coming out January 23rd.
Um,

331
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:20,643
although it's available for 
preorder@amazon.com or amazon.ca and 

332
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:28,540
several other places.
I'll put links in the,

333
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:29,763
in the video description.
If you're trying to figure out how to 

334
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:37,420
Orient Yourself in the midst of the 
chaos that constitutes life,

335
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,733
then you might find some of the things 
that I wrote in 12 rules for life 

336
00:22:42,521 --> 00:22:43,354
helpful.
So I hope that that was interesting and 

337
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:48,910
a good bye for now.
