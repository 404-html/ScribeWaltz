1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:05,820
Yeah.
So I was thinking today about how to

2
00:00:06,931 --> 00:00:11,850
explain this a little bit further.
So let's say

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,560
you're going for a job interview
and uh,

4
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,060
you're nervous about it
and you go in to the job interview and

5
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:35,520
there's some people there and some
chairs and tables and it's a room that's

6
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:37,140
like this,
maybe not quite as ugly,

7
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:40,200
but,
but something like this.

8
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:46,970
What's in the room?
You're nervous,

9
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,900
you've seen chairs,
the tables before,

10
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,360
you've seen people what's in the room.

11
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:53,623
Okay.

12
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,780
How about a set of alternate futures?

13
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,733
Right.

14
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,070
You know,
that isn't how we think,

15
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:08,100
it's how we act.
And you know,

16
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,850
if you talk about it,
I was nervous about going to this job

17
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:13,170
interview.
Why?

18
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,360
Well,
I thought I might be evaluated.

19
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,340
Okay,
well why does that matter?

20
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,890
Well,
we know partly why it matters.

21
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,000
Look at this figure again,
pretty happy with his figure.

22
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,380
All things considered,
you know,

23
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:29,550
and you might say,
well,

24
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,100
if I,
maybe it'll shake my faith in my,

25
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,330
you know,
in my belief that I'm a good person.

26
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,660
That'd be a little silly for an
interview,

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,670
you know?
So if you're thinking that way,

28
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:46,170
I would say you're thinking you're,
you're not thinking specifically enough

29
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,830
cause there's lots of reasons you might
not do well at a job interview,

30
00:01:49,831 --> 00:01:52,800
including the fact that they might have
already given the job to someone else

31
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:54,690
for all you know.
So,

32
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,840
so you don't want to leap to the top of
the hierarchy without cause.

33
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:02,763
Okay.

34
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,270
Now,
so one of the things you might say is

35
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:10,160
that in the room there,
there are threats that might be posed to

36
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:15,161
any level of the hierarchy
of beliefs and behaviors that you use to

37
00:02:17,901 --> 00:02:21,860
interact with the world.
Now,

38
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:23,900
the terror management people would tell
you,

39
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,030
let's assume that this is a belief
structure.

40
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,590
I don't care whether you agree with the
way it's represented graphically or not

41
00:02:30,591 --> 00:02:33,550
for the time being,
but let's just assume that what we're

42
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,360
talking about is a belief structure.
Now,

43
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:40,820
the Tara management people would tell
you that you have that belief structure

44
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,900
far in large part to protect you from
the fear of death,

45
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:45,680
right?
From Maine,

46
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,820
from death,
anxiety.

47
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,780
But there's a bunch of problems with
that idea.

48
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,830
Not least that it actually sidesteps the
issue of the function of the belief

49
00:02:55,671 --> 00:02:58,490
system.
It's like you don't exactly have a

50
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:01,750
belief system to make philosophical
sense out of the world.

51
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:07,650
You have a system of tools
that are embodied that allow you to

52
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:14,320
actually act in the world.
Now you might also have an articulated

53
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:18,370
representation of that on top that's
more or less accurate,

54
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,480
probably less all things considered.
And you know,

55
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:25,990
maybe if your faith and not as shaken
your faith in what you do,

56
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:29,530
we'll also be shaken because the two
things are are associated,

57
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:34,360
but we should always remember that I
believe system doesn't just protect you

58
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:38,950
from the fear of death and protects you
from death and that's a lot different,

59
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,690
you know,
I mean this whole thing is,

60
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:45,990
it's your set of skills and and,
and the perceptions and thoughts and

61
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:48,400
emotions that go along with those
skills.

62
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:53,590
And then it's an integrated structure
consisting of the particular manner in

63
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:55,990
which you've integrated all your own
little sub parts.

64
00:03:55,991 --> 00:03:57,880
And then in relationship to the whole
community,

65
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:02,620
you can also think about it in some
sense as a holographic representation of

66
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:03,454
the culture.

67
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,003
Now

68
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,670
I don't know how much you guys know
about holographs.

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,710
I don't know very much about them
either,

70
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,750
but there's some things I know about
them.

71
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,500
So if you shine a light on a holograph,
you'll get it.

72
00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:20,480
Three,
the image that of whatever it was there

73
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,740
when the holograph was created,
it's created by lasers now.

74
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,580
And if you take a holograph and you
break it into pieces and then you shine

75
00:04:28,581 --> 00:04:32,900
a light on the pieces,
you get an object in each piece.

76
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,020
So,
but it's lower resolution.

77
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,810
It's a nice way of thinking about a
person,

78
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,570
you know,
like if your brain is damaged,

79
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,110
you'll be there,
but sort of as a lower resolution

80
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:47,510
representation of yourself.
But it's also really nice way of

81
00:04:47,511 --> 00:04:52,511
thinking about what culture is.
Culture is this massive structure of

82
00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:00,430
multiple levels and domains,
but it's reflected in each of us.

83
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,380
Like we're each partial carriers of it.

84
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,740
So we have a partial representation of
the structure that we embody,

85
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:08,630
a partial representation of the
structure.

86
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:13,070
I mean literally we embody it and then
we also represent it abstractly.

87
00:05:13,071 --> 00:05:14,600
And you know,
part of the reason that you go to a

88
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:19,601
university is to in some sense,
improve your capacity to articulate your

89
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:21,680
structure,
right?

90
00:05:21,681 --> 00:05:23,420
Because you're a cultural creature.
It's like,

91
00:05:23,421 --> 00:05:25,250
why are you the way you are?
Well,

92
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,250
some of it's psychological,
some of its sociological,

93
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,490
some of it's historical,
like a lot of it is historical.

94
00:05:31,491 --> 00:05:35,960
So when you go and you study social
science or humanity,

95
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,030
you're studying your own personality.

96
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,633
Now

97
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,440
I wrote a paper a while back with a
couple of my graduate students and it

98
00:05:46,441 --> 00:05:50,310
was,
I think it was called the entropy.

99
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,280
God,
you'd think I would remember this.

100
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,190
Entropy doesn't matter.
The hypothesis was,

101
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,010
and this is something I'd been thinking
about a law for a long time,

102
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:02,700
is that,
you know,

103
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,370
the world is very,
very complex.

104
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,510
And so what that means is that the act
of getting from one place to another is

105
00:06:08,511 --> 00:06:09,860
often very,
very difficult.

106
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,360
And partly what you're doing when you
put together a functional submodule is

107
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,130
you're putting together a little routine
that will enable you to transform some

108
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:23,060
part of time and space from what it is
and to what you want it to be.

109
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,180
And in some sense,
what you're doing is reducing the

110
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:28,640
complexity of that situation.
So imagine this,

111
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:31,370
so you go for your job interview and
you're,

112
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,660
you're knocking them dead.

113
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,090
What happens?
Well,

114
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:38,090
a whole bunch of possibilities,
all that,

115
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,120
that set of possibilities that was
concerning you starts to collapse

116
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,710
towards a single solution.
And that single solution is if you're

117
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:52,640
doing very well in the interview,
it's like it's a positive solution.

118
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:56,390
So your anxiety disappears and it's
replaced with positive emotion.

119
00:06:56,391 --> 00:07:00,920
You get enthusiastic and excited because
what's happening in that room is that a

120
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:05,420
path to the desirable future is opening.
Now you can't see any of this,

121
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:07,820
you know?
And because we're so blinded by the idea

122
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:09,870
that we see objects,
we,

123
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:15,020
we failed to perceive in any articulated
sense what it is that we're actually

124
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:16,280
dealing with them.
You know,

125
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:20,490
I think that one way of thinking about
it is that you're always on the edge of,

126
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,210
of,
of something that's potential.

127
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,540
That's where you exist.
You exist on this moving,

128
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,410
um,
boundary of potential and you can

129
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:35,150
interact with it such that you form it
and it passes,

130
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,910
it passes by you into the past,
you know,

131
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:42,911
and hopefully you're forming it in a way
that is in concordance with your better

132
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:48,650
health and perhaps with the better
health of the people around you that

133
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:49,790
would sort of be optimal.

134
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,700
So you're realizing that potential inner
inner,

135
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,420
inner genuine,
non metaphorical sense that that's the

136
00:07:56,421 --> 00:07:58,970
thing about these representations in
other,

137
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,200
they're often described as mythical or
mythological or metaphorical,

138
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,660
but you know,
they're really not metaphorical.

139
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,900
Well,
it's not exactly right because the great

140
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:09,980
mother,
the great father,

141
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:12,320
those,
they're partially metaphorical,

142
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:16,190
but the medic,
the thing that they stand for as

143
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:19,640
metaphors is something other than the
things that we conceptualize when we

144
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:21,590
look at the world from an objective
perspective.

145
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,630
Now we've talked a little bit about the
figure of the dragon of chaos.

146
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,120
And I think of all the metaphorical
images,

147
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:31,880
it's the most difficult to grasp because
it's,

148
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,880
it's that which has not yet been
encountered.

149
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:39,080
So it's neither unknown nor known.
And you think,

150
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:40,790
well,
you can't even describe that.

151
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:41,451
It's,
yeah,

152
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:44,480
but you can encounter it and you
encounter that when you go into a

153
00:08:44,481 --> 00:08:46,280
situation that's radically new.

154
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,640
So I would say,
let's say it's just the second before

155
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:52,040
you walk into a high stakes interview,
you know,

156
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:56,040
just before you open the door,
I would say that's as close as you get.

157
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,330
You know,
in a normal day,

158
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,260
do a direct encounter with the dragon of
chaos because you don't know what's

159
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:03,000
going to happen and to say,
well,

160
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,040
you're in a room and there's a door in
front of you.

161
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,320
You know,
it's almost moronic to think of it that

162
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:07,801
way,
right?

163
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:10,200
Because what the hell does that have to
do with anything?

164
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,310
It's what's in there is unbelievably,
I like,

165
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:17,970
it's the localized,
it's the localization of unbelievably

166
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:21,330
complex webs of causality.
That's what's waiting for you inside

167
00:09:21,331 --> 00:09:24,150
that room.
And then you might say,

168
00:09:24,151 --> 00:09:26,280
well,
is it structured in any real way?

169
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:30,840
And the answer to that is not really,
it's no more structured then it's even

170
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:33,090
less structured than a book that you're
reading.

171
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,030
You know,
like you're,

172
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,640
if you're reading the book,
you might say,

173
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:38,780
well where's the meaning in this book?
And the answer to that is it,

174
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,000
well it's not in the book.
Like it's partly there,

175
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,860
you know,
because you need the words in the

176
00:09:43,861 --> 00:09:45,660
sentences and the paragraphs and all
that,

177
00:09:45,661 --> 00:09:49,080
but you need the whole cultural context
around it in order to interpret it.

178
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,080
So you're not reading it blank.
You know,

179
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:56,280
you come to it with a set of a very
large set of presuppositions,

180
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,650
enough of them so that you can
understand the,

181
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,800
the author.
Now maybe you can't and the book's over

182
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:06,390
your hand or it's badly written.
But typically you come at it with the

183
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:11,391
machinery in place so that when you
interact with the words and the phrases

184
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:16,560
and the sentences and so forth,
revelations of new meaning poor forth.

185
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,280
And so,
I don't know how to say it any clearer

186
00:10:20,281 --> 00:10:20,790
than that.

187
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,490
That's what the meaning of the book is.
And,

188
00:10:22,491 --> 00:10:25,110
and it's,
it's in the dialectical interaction

189
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:26,490
between you and the book.
Well,

190
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,110
if you walk into an interview room,
it's even less given in some sense than

191
00:10:31,111 --> 00:10:31,801
the book,
right?

192
00:10:31,801 --> 00:10:35,670
Because what's going to happen in there,
which really means which of the many

193
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:38,880
futures that that room contains is going
to manifest itself.

194
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,040
It depends very much on how you act.
So it's in that way that you collapsed

195
00:10:45,931 --> 00:10:49,710
the potential that's in a particular
place and you extract something out of

196
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:51,630
it.
That's well that,

197
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:54,570
and then that's when it gets tricky,
neutral,

198
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,360
positive or negative may be bombed the
interview,

199
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,380
right?
And then you might say,

200
00:10:58,381 --> 00:10:59,060
well,
what,

201
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,090
what,
what does,

202
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,650
what happened?
What happened?

203
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,140
Well,
that's a very complicated question.

204
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,060
Then you're stuck with this hierarchy,
right?

205
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:07,830
And that's what you're going to do when
you go home.

206
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,510
You're going to say,
well,

207
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,610
you know,
maybe I didn't dress properly or maybe I

208
00:11:11,611 --> 00:11:14,580
didn't get to the interview on time,
or they ask me a bunch of questions I

209
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:16,740
wasn't prepared for,
or Jesus,

210
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:18,510
I didn't know anything about what's
going on.

211
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:22,080
My whole education was a waste of time.
And what the hell am I doing?

212
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,330
And then he might go,
I'm never going to get a job.

213
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,340
And you,
you know what you could say in some

214
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:31,341
sense that all of those hypotheses as
you move up and down the hierarchy,

215
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,400
you know,
you move from trivial trouble to really

216
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:40,401
not good trouble as you bounce.
And all of that is an attempt to specify

217
00:11:40,531 --> 00:11:44,310
in some sense what that room contained.
And it's not easy.

218
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:48,060
You know?
And it's weird too because the room can

219
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:51,210
contain things that alter your past,
you know,

220
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,650
because maybe you say,
well,

221
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,990
maybe you're going for a computer
science job.

222
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,250
Maybe you're not,
whatever.

223
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,870
You know,
you go in there and you think you're the

224
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:01,000
top person in your class and maybe you
were,

225
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:02,980
but you know,
the people in there are so far ahead of

226
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:05,170
you that you can't even imagine ever
catching up.

227
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:06,970
And you know,
when you come out of there,

228
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,430
the manner in which you construe your
educational history is going to be

229
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:15,760
radically transformed.
So there's a lot of,

230
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,210
a lot of trouble in that room.
There's a lot.

231
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,520
Now,
one of the things we thought in this

232
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:23,560
paper,
you can think of each of those little

233
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:27,760
eggs,
they're really eggs as a container.

234
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,450
And what they contain is entropy
trouble.

235
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,930
And the smaller ones contained smaller
amounts of entropy and the bigger ones

236
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:37,390
contain bigger amounts of entropy,
you know?

237
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:40,510
And so here's another example.
You're driving down the highway and your

238
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:43,720
car sputters and grinds to a halt.

239
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,300
Maybe it makes some nice red radical
noise as well.

240
00:12:46,301 --> 00:12:48,160
It's doing it.
It's okay.

241
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:53,760
Well what happened?
Well the answer is the simple answer is

242
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,800
your car mental function and you had to
pull off the road.

243
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,710
That's a really object oriented
analysis.

244
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,150
But what's actually happened is that you
had a conceptualization of the car as a

245
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:07,180
pragmatic tool.
Cause what do you know about the damn

246
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:08,620
car?
You know,

247
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,510
the car was uh,
uh,

248
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,090
the car was a,
an affordance that's the right word that

249
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:18,670
would get you from point a to point b.
And you could have a very little

250
00:13:18,671 --> 00:13:20,170
resolution model of it,
right?

251
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,800
It can just look like a plastic shell,
which is sort of what a car looks like.

252
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,370
And as long as you see how low root
resolution that is,

253
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:30,640
you could replace it with a cartoon and
you wouldn't even notice

254
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,420
that's,
that's good enough representation.

255
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,760
As long as the thing is doing what it's
supposed to be doing.

256
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,880
But as soon as it stops doing what it's
supposed to be doing,

257
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:42,490
then it could be any old thing.
And you think,

258
00:13:42,491 --> 00:13:43,790
well,
what does any old thing mean?

259
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:46,570
Well maybe you're on a deserted highway
and it's one o'clock in the morning.

260
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,240
And you know when someone pulls over to
is to help you.

261
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,310
Okay,
well what's that?

262
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,301
Well,
you know,

263
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:55,210
we believe me,
your imagination will rapidly span the

264
00:13:55,211 --> 00:13:59,500
world of possibility from oh good,
someone's come to help to I'm going to

265
00:13:59,501 --> 00:14:02,070
be dragged off in the bush and killed.
You know,

266
00:14:02,071 --> 00:14:05,860
and that's all contained in that,
in that sequence of events.

267
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:08,260
And then even if no one does stop,
well then you know,

268
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,960
and,
and you have to worry about exactly

269
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:13,260
what's gone wrong and you would have to
worry about how you're going to fix it.

270
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,130
You have to worry about the mechanic
that might help you.

271
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:17,410
And you have to concern yourself with
whether or not you're going to need a

272
00:14:17,411 --> 00:14:21,370
new car and then you have to think about
your finances and it's like the idea

273
00:14:21,371 --> 00:14:26,371
that that car is a bounded entity like
it looks is only true when it works,

274
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,970
as soon as it doesn't work,
then God,

275
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:35,440
it's any old thing and that in some
senses the dragon of chaos.

276
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,980
It's this.
Now what seems to me to have happened

277
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,091
because you might think,
well,

278
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:42,370
how do people come to conceptualize such
a thing?

279
00:14:42,371 --> 00:14:45,940
Because I would think of of all the
things that are different are difficult

280
00:14:45,941 --> 00:14:49,180
to conceptualize.
The category of all things that you have

281
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:52,760
not yet encountered is the most
difficult thing to discover it,

282
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:54,140
right?
It's kind of like zero.

283
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:58,730
It took people a long time to figure out
zero and no wonder we need a symbol for

284
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,564
nothing.

285
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,150
Well,
this is even worse.

286
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,530
We need a representation for potential.
While you think,

287
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:07,040
well,
why?

288
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,570
Well,
because it's actually potential that

289
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:11,420
you're interacting with all of the time.
Now,

290
00:15:11,421 --> 00:15:13,520
what seems to me to have happened was
that,

291
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:18,720
you know,
this is a evolutionary just so story.

292
00:15:18,721 --> 00:15:22,130
So I'm not assuming that it actually
worked precisely this way,

293
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:25,340
but it doesn't matter cause it's got,
I'm going to touch on the appropriate,

294
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,743
you know,
uh,

295
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,840
the appropriate features.
Well one of the things we know about

296
00:15:29,841 --> 00:15:32,690
social animals generally speaking and
animals in general,

297
00:15:32,691 --> 00:15:34,160
is that they have a territory,
right?

298
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,070
And so you think,
well what is their territory exactly?

299
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:38,511
And he might say,
well,

300
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:39,770
you can mark it out.
Here's,

301
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:40,760
here's a,
Oh,

302
00:15:40,761 --> 00:15:44,630
what will we think about
what would have a territory?

303
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,350
It must make it make it a like a tiger.
They're pretty solitary.

304
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:49,790
So it'll be simple.

305
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:54,650
They have a big territory rights as
hundreds of square miles.

306
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,560
And the reason for that is while there
are tigers,

307
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,220
you can't have like 50 of them cause
they'll just eat everything that's

308
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:02,870
there.
Even though you have to have a big

309
00:16:02,871 --> 00:16:07,400
territory to support one apex Predator.
So then you might say,

310
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:09,710
well what exactly is the territory of
the tiger?

311
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:10,221
And you'd say,
well,

312
00:16:10,221 --> 00:16:12,880
here's its boundaries.
This is where it there,

313
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:16,940
this is where it roams,
but that's not the right way of thinking

314
00:16:16,941 --> 00:16:21,410
about the territory of the tiger because
the territory of the tiger is actually

315
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,640
all the places where when the tiger does
its thing,

316
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:29,300
the things that the tiger wants to or
expect happens,

317
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,940
that's the Tigers territory.
It's the same with you.

318
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,910
You know you're at home wherever you
know what to do and what you're doing

319
00:16:37,911 --> 00:16:41,750
when you knew what to do is you know how
to match this hierarchy,

320
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,690
which is partly action oriented.

321
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,500
You know how to match the hierarchy with
this situation so that when you put it

322
00:16:48,501 --> 00:16:52,520
into practice,
the potential that's there transforms

323
00:16:52,521 --> 00:16:56,810
itself into what you're aiming at.
And that's your territory.

324
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,240
And you know,
and you need to think about it that way

325
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:01,580
because your territory can shift very
rapidly on.

326
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,680
And if you think about geography
geographically,

327
00:17:03,681 --> 00:17:06,620
it's kind of confusing.
So let's say you're on the subway that

328
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:10,910
you always take and then someone sits
down beside you and they're muttering

329
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:14,930
away madly and have a pretty malevolent
look on their face and you get a glimpse

330
00:17:14,931 --> 00:17:17,360
inside their code.
And it's like there's a knife,

331
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,820
it's like you're not in your territory
anymore.

332
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:24,940
And the fact that all of the objective
entities are still there,

333
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:29,420
arrayed around you is it's just an,
it's nothing more than a,

334
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,510
what would you call it?
It's a delusion at that point to think

335
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:34,640
that those things characterize where you
are.

336
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,000
Okay.
So if you're willing to consider

337
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:41,750
territory as that,
it's a space time continuum.

338
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,940
Okay.
And the reason I'm stressing that,

339
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,240
I mean first of all,
whatever reality is,

340
00:17:47,241 --> 00:17:49,230
is a space time continuum,
right?

341
00:17:49,231 --> 00:17:52,020
It's got three dimensions of space and
one dimension of time.

342
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:57,021
And everyone knows that as we sit here
more or less stable in three dimensions,

343
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:01,160
time flows past us in some sense.
And so the,

344
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,770
the three dimensional reality is
transforming all by itself just because

345
00:18:04,771 --> 00:18:05,581
of time.
Okay.

346
00:18:05,581 --> 00:18:07,800
And so when we're mapping out our
territory's,

347
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:12,950
we map out spacetime territory's.
And so that means that not only do you

348
00:18:14,221 --> 00:18:16,290
know where you are,
you know when you are,

349
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:19,620
and if you're in your territory,
you know how to act for that place in

350
00:18:19,621 --> 00:18:23,700
that time so that you transformed the
potential that's there into whatever it

351
00:18:23,701 --> 00:18:24,570
is that you're aiming at.

352
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,000
Okay?
So that's your territory.

353
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:32,940
Now that territory is isomorphic
evolutionary,

354
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:37,770
evolutionarily with lots of things which
you could also confuse geographically.

355
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:40,590
So you know,
you might think of a human territory as

356
00:18:40,591 --> 00:18:44,880
something like,
it's probably the fundamental human

357
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:48,090
territory is probably a fire,
right?

358
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,910
And so the fire is a place of light in
the darkness,

359
00:18:50,911 --> 00:18:55,911
and then you can think of row rings,
concentric rings of relative safety,

360
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,850
uh,
surrounding the fire.

361
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,690
So right beside the fire where it's warm
and light and there's lots of other

362
00:19:03,691 --> 00:19:04,440
people,
man,

363
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,390
that's explored territory,
you know?

364
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,540
But then if you start wandering away
from the fire into the Bush,

365
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:14,280
especially if you're in a very
biologically active area,

366
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,400
then the farther away you get from the
fire,

367
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,300
the more you're going outside of your
territory.

368
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:21,480
And you can tell that it's happening
because your whole nervous system starts

369
00:19:21,481 --> 00:19:22,500
to function differently.

370
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:27,090
What happens is is that the nervous
system parts that you were using using

371
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,380
while you were in known territory,
just they just shut down.

372
00:19:31,381 --> 00:19:34,890
And the other nervous system elements
that you use an unknown territory start

373
00:19:34,891 --> 00:19:39,891
to turn on and generally you're not very
happy about that because where you're,

374
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,310
when you're aware you've mastered the
territory,

375
00:19:44,311 --> 00:19:48,720
you can presume that neutral or
moderately good things are going to

376
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:52,020
happen with the possibility of something
great now and then.

377
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:56,640
But as you move away from that,
it flips in some sense too.

378
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,200
I don't know what is going on here and I
might fall to something's going to bite

379
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,600
me too.
I'm going to die a painful death.

380
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,870
You know,
and you don't use the same circuits to

381
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:11,610
process the first situation as you do
the process the second you don't even

382
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:14,130
like having the second one on,
you know,

383
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:16,610
so you know what it's like you're you.

384
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,350
Maybe you've been feeling a bit down
because that always helps.

385
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,380
And then you wake up at three in the
morning and you're worrying about six

386
00:20:22,381 --> 00:20:25,080
things and you hear some random noise
somewhere.

387
00:20:25,081 --> 00:20:26,610
There shouldn't be around him.
Noise.

388
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:31,920
Well how you feel right then.
That's what it is like to have the

389
00:20:31,921 --> 00:20:36,870
system that deals with the unexpected on
your like a prey animal really,

390
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,070
really exactly like what because that's
actually what you are in many ways and

391
00:20:41,071 --> 00:20:45,450
so you know your whole biology
transformed so that you're prepared for

392
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:47,620
God only knows what.
Well,

393
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,910
what seem to have happened in the course
of evolution was that when we were

394
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:56,560
smaller creatures all and far after
that,

395
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,520
before let's say we figured out how to
use throwing sticks and slings and then

396
00:21:04,811 --> 00:21:09,811
later maybe bows and arrows or maybe
even sticks like we're getting eaten

397
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,340
lot.
I think I told you guys last week that

398
00:21:12,341 --> 00:21:16,090
they just discovered this damn cat in
Africa that it looks like it prayed on

399
00:21:16,091 --> 00:21:19,270
our fore bearers and or we have pretty
hard skull.

400
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:21,370
So the normal cap can't really know all
three of them.

401
00:21:21,371 --> 00:21:24,460
But this cat had a special set of teeth
and if it grabbed the front of your

402
00:21:24,461 --> 00:21:26,020
head,
it would drive one of its teeth right

403
00:21:26,021 --> 00:21:28,360
through the back of your skull.
So you know,

404
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,470
the hominids were preyed on enough so
that they had their own predators.

405
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,551
Well,
so you know,

406
00:21:33,551 --> 00:21:37,120
that's just not,
that's just not very pleasant.

407
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,420
And then that's why the time we were
hominins you can go back farther than

408
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:42,070
that.
So when we were little tree rats,

409
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,650
roughly speaking and then all sorts of
things we're eating us,

410
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,170
you know,
there were a lot of reptiles around back

411
00:21:47,171 --> 00:21:49,960
then and s 60 million years ago and they
weren't pleasant.

412
00:21:49,961 --> 00:21:52,360
There was phil dinosaurs around 60
million years ago.

413
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,950
And so you know,
that's a lot of evolutionary time for us

414
00:21:56,951 --> 00:22:01,180
to have developed biological systems
that distinguished between places were

415
00:22:01,181 --> 00:22:02,890
safe and places we're not safe.

416
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,610
Well,
you roughly have one set of

417
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:12,510
neuropsychological neuropsycho
physiological functions for familiar

418
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:15,070
territory and another set for unfamiliar
territory.

419
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,990
Now what I would say this is,
this is where this becomes I think

420
00:22:19,991 --> 00:22:22,060
radically different.
The terror management theory.

421
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,750
What these,
what this hierarchy is doing.

422
00:22:25,751 --> 00:22:29,860
When it's functioning is shutting off.
It's keeping the system that operates an

423
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:33,250
unexplored territory shut off and you
like that.

424
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,210
And that's when you're calm and like you
are in here,

425
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,320
you're know you're relatively at home
here because you assume that you know

426
00:22:41,321 --> 00:22:45,160
how to act here as long as you sit and
you ask questions more or less

427
00:22:45,161 --> 00:22:48,340
appropriately and he don't bother people
and you don't talk on your phone,

428
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,120
various other things,
the probability that you're going to be

429
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:56,170
confronted by an angry primate or some
other Predator is a very,

430
00:22:56,171 --> 00:22:59,230
very low.
And so so,

431
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,770
so you'd say,
well you're normal,

432
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,260
you feel like you do normally here.
And,

433
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,590
but I would say the only reason you feel
that way normally to begin with is

434
00:23:08,591 --> 00:23:12,160
because you don't go places where you
feel not normal.

435
00:23:12,161 --> 00:23:14,980
You stay away from them and everyone
knows what those places are.

436
00:23:14,981 --> 00:23:15,814
Like.

437
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:21,560
I saw a real cool example of this once I
was down by,

438
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,780
by old cad about midnight on a Saturday
night.

439
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,280
You know,
there was,

440
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,280
it was in the summer.
So there are all these kids really

441
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,220
wandering around in their party clothes.
And,

442
00:23:33,221 --> 00:23:34,270
you know,
go into the clubs.

443
00:23:34,271 --> 00:23:39,271
And I was standing there watching and I
looked through a park at this street

444
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:44,560
that runs by near Oca and there were
these houses,

445
00:23:44,561 --> 00:23:48,590
there was a row of houses and there was
like three houses here and they're all

446
00:23:48,591 --> 00:23:51,320
really nicely taken care of.
And there was a house here.

447
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,140
And then there was some more houses over
here that were well taken care of.

448
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,600
And that house in the middle was
condemned,

449
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:59,360
you know,
so the roof was pro rotting and they

450
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,170
boarded up all the windows,
you know,

451
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,530
and the fences were falling over and
there was garbage in the yard.

452
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:05,150
It was a derelict place,
you know,

453
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,820
so that's kind of a spooky place.
Well,

454
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,570
while I was standing there,
this guy walked down the street and he

455
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:15,650
was very intoxicated and he wasn't very
happy and he was sort of muttering to

456
00:24:15,651 --> 00:24:19,370
himself and he passed the three houses
that were in pretty good shape.

457
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:22,820
And then as soon as he got in front of
the House that was derelict,

458
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,740
he just started to rant.
And he was,

459
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,930
you know,
pounding up and down and muttering

460
00:24:26,931 --> 00:24:29,030
paranoid things and yelling and you
know,

461
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:31,940
it was sounding really dangerous,
but he kept more or less moving forward.

462
00:24:31,941 --> 00:24:35,900
And then just after he got past that
border line and back into the more or

463
00:24:35,901 --> 00:24:39,050
less normal neighborhood,
he switched back to just mumbling

464
00:24:39,051 --> 00:24:40,850
quietly and walk forward.
You know,

465
00:24:40,851 --> 00:24:43,460
he was so damn intoxicated.
There isn't a possibility that he

466
00:24:43,461 --> 00:24:46,370
noticed what had happened,
but he was being cued by the

467
00:24:46,371 --> 00:24:47,420
surroundings,
you know?

468
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,080
And it was a different hand when he was
in unexplored territory.

469
00:24:51,081 --> 00:24:52,820
You know,
it was something that had degenerated

470
00:24:52,821 --> 00:24:56,160
back into chaos.
So the anger and aggression came out of

471
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,810
them because that's often necessary if
you're going to be where there's chaos,

472
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:02,840
you know,
and chaos can burst forth and does all

473
00:25:02,841 --> 00:25:04,340
the time in people's lives.
You know,

474
00:25:04,341 --> 00:25:07,780
if you're sitting around the dinner
table with your family and everything's

475
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,860
going pretty well,
but someone touches on,

476
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,720
you know,
one of those topics that you should just

477
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:13,670
shut the hell up about,
you know,

478
00:25:13,671 --> 00:25:16,610
it can take almost no time at all before
the whole thing unravels.

479
00:25:16,611 --> 00:25:20,060
And then God only knows where you are
and it's not pleasant.

480
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,190
So instead of our belief systems
protecting us from death,

481
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:29,810
anxiety are hierarchical,
pragmatic systems for interacting with

482
00:25:29,811 --> 00:25:34,811
the world stopped the parts of our brain
that deal with the unexpected from being

483
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:35,810
on.

484
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:39,530
And they don't do that because we
believe they do that.

485
00:25:39,531 --> 00:25:44,390
Because when we enact those structures,
all hell doesn't break loose.

486
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,090
So there's nothing illusory about it.
Now,

487
00:25:47,091 --> 00:25:47,924
you know,
you might say,

488
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,520
well,
in the final analysis,

489
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:53,360
does it really protect you from chaos?
And you know that's an okay question.

490
00:25:53,361 --> 00:25:57,680
But most of the time,
most of the time that's irrelevant.

491
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,100
It isn't always irrelevant,
but most of the time it just doesn't

492
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,900
matter.
And the other thing is,

493
00:26:02,901 --> 00:26:06,800
is that much of the time it doesn't even
matter if you believe this,

494
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,830
you know,
which by which I would mean you have an

495
00:26:09,831 --> 00:26:14,480
articulated representation of it.
It's also a self representation.

496
00:26:14,481 --> 00:26:18,140
And you carry that around and maybe you
have a crisis of faith and you don't

497
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:20,560
believe in that.
You still act all this stuff out and

498
00:26:20,561 --> 00:26:23,210
most of the time you're still extremely
well protected by it.

499
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:27,290
So it's a little,
it's more robust than merely the

500
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:30,740
articulated or imagined version.
It's a lot deeper than that.

501
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:35,480
It's only a tiny part of its structure.
And so we should never really talk about

502
00:26:35,481 --> 00:26:37,370
belief systems.
Exactly.

503
00:26:37,371 --> 00:26:42,110
Especially not if they're shared with
very many other people because they're

504
00:26:42,111 --> 00:26:45,690
not structures of,
they're much deeper structures and that,

505
00:26:45,691 --> 00:26:49,830
and the belief part is only a pale
reflection of the underlying reality.

506
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:52,500
Okay.
So that,

507
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:56,070
I presume that makes sense and you can,
when you can make sense of that in your

508
00:26:56,071 --> 00:26:57,000
own life.
And you know,

509
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:00,330
there's other things that can happen to
that that I should mention is lots of

510
00:27:00,331 --> 00:27:03,090
times people have chaos.
You know,

511
00:27:03,091 --> 00:27:05,250
you think your body has explored
territory.

512
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,260
It's sort of like the ultimate explored
territory.

513
00:27:07,261 --> 00:27:09,870
But I would say don't get too convinced
about that.

514
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,960
That can also switch in a moment.

515
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,730
And it happens to people all the time.
So if you get a tooth pulled,

516
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,270
it takes your tongue like three months
to map the inside of your mouth.

517
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:24,570
Again,
so that's refamiliarizing your brain

518
00:27:24,571 --> 00:27:26,190
with the new territory,
right?

519
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,290
And that is very,
very complicated.

520
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:33,291
So your body representation is insanely
complicated and it's really easy to

521
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,880
screw up.
So if you go to have someone go like

522
00:27:35,881 --> 00:27:40,020
that and then you point to one of their
fingers in the middle and get them to

523
00:27:40,021 --> 00:27:41,040
move it,
don't touch it,

524
00:27:41,041 --> 00:27:45,150
they often can't because just that's
enough to boggle up their visual

525
00:27:45,151 --> 00:27:48,660
representation of their body.
And so you can play all sorts of tricks

526
00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:51,990
on people that way.
And so,

527
00:27:51,991 --> 00:27:54,150
you know,
so that your map of your body and your

528
00:27:54,151 --> 00:27:57,360
body are sort of reasonably well
associated,

529
00:27:57,361 --> 00:27:59,670
but they can be dissociated quite
rapidly.

530
00:27:59,671 --> 00:28:04,020
And you know,
that happens when maybe you get a little

531
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:06,420
hypochondriacal and start worrying about
your health.

532
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,890
Something's bugging you,
you know,

533
00:28:07,891 --> 00:28:09,810
and you don't exactly know what it is.
It's like,

534
00:28:09,811 --> 00:28:12,510
well,
all of a sudden you get alienated from

535
00:28:12,511 --> 00:28:15,270
your body.
And that can get really serious.

536
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:19,140
You know?
And I've seen people after a car

537
00:28:19,141 --> 00:28:21,300
accident,
this was the most striking case of this

538
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:24,660
client.
I had had her shoulder up like this.

539
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:29,100
And I noticed he never really looked in
the direction of that arm.

540
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:31,650
And when she moved that you'd only move
at about this far.

541
00:28:31,651 --> 00:28:33,210
And after seeing her for awhile,
I thought,

542
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,240
oh,
she's afraid of that arm now.

543
00:28:36,241 --> 00:28:39,090
It had been hurt.
Well why would you get afraid of your

544
00:28:39,091 --> 00:28:40,500
arm?
Well,

545
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,340
doesn't act like it used to.
So that's annoying.

546
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:45,510
And then when you move it wrong,
it hurts.

547
00:28:45,511 --> 00:28:49,050
And then you also don't know that if you
move it wrong and it hurts whether

548
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,890
you're making it worse,
so then you just kind of ignore it and

549
00:28:52,891 --> 00:28:55,290
then it sort of your arm and sort of not
your arm,

550
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:55,980
you know?

551
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:00,180
Well I had her at one point,
we just practice doing this.

552
00:29:00,181 --> 00:29:00,691
I said,
well,

553
00:29:00,691 --> 00:29:03,120
can I do it?
The action,

554
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,560
can you do this?
She'd do it.

555
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,690
And then I'd go,
well can you do this?

556
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,330
And then she'd do it.
Now can you do this?

557
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:13,500
We just kept doing this and only took
about half an hour until she was up

558
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:14,161
here.
She said,

559
00:29:14,161 --> 00:29:16,320
I hadn't put my arm up there for two
years,

560
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,570
you know?
And then I get the same thing with their

561
00:29:18,571 --> 00:29:19,410
shoulder.
You know,

562
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,720
can you lift it cheap?
I said,

563
00:29:21,721 --> 00:29:23,280
can you lift your shoulder?
No.

564
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,300
Can you lift at one 16 seven inch while
she could do that,

565
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:30,210
well you know,
16 times at one 16th of an inch and

566
00:29:30,211 --> 00:29:31,950
that's an inch and that's starting to
get there.

567
00:29:31,951 --> 00:29:34,890
And you know,
she did this a bunch and then her arm

568
00:29:34,891 --> 00:29:38,790
went down so she'd been holding the damn
arm up for two years.

569
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,030
Just try that,
you know?

570
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,020
I mean you just do this for five minutes
and see what happens.

571
00:29:44,021 --> 00:29:47,230
You just hold your shoulder up there for
two years and see what that does to the

572
00:29:47,231 --> 00:29:50,170
entire right side of your body.
Like it's really,

573
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:52,480
really stressful.
Man.

574
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:55,780
I did something strange then,
which was a whim,

575
00:29:55,781 --> 00:29:58,780
but I think it was because I was
embodying her because I was paying so

576
00:29:58,781 --> 00:30:00,940
close attention.
I asked her to come and lean over my

577
00:30:00,941 --> 00:30:02,800
desk.
There's something about the way she was

578
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,450
holding herself that was really bugging
me.

579
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,120
And so I asked her just to lean over her
desk,

580
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:09,340
my desk,
and I pounded on her back down her

581
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:11,650
spinal cord and she dropped her
shoulders again.

582
00:30:11,651 --> 00:30:14,230
Then she cried for about half an hour.
So,

583
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,750
and again it was because she got hit by
a car.

584
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,710
That's how she was like,
she just walked around like that,

585
00:30:20,711 --> 00:30:22,870
you know,
and it permanently,

586
00:30:22,871 --> 00:30:23,590
more or less.

587
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,440
And you know,
we work it out of her reasonably well,

588
00:30:26,441 --> 00:30:28,570
but
you know,

589
00:30:28,571 --> 00:30:32,500
even your own damn body can become
unexplored territory.

590
00:30:32,501 --> 00:30:33,520
And you know,
that's another,

591
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,420
that's another way of understanding that
Yin Yang symbol,

592
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:42,040
right?
You got the black serpent Paisley and

593
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:45,250
it's got a little white dog in it,
which means that sometimes when things

594
00:30:45,251 --> 00:30:49,270
are really broken all to hell,
a solution can come blasting fourth.

595
00:30:49,271 --> 00:30:51,490
And you know,
chaos turns into order,

596
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:54,910
but more likely,
you know,

597
00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:00,150
everything's going pretty nicely and op
something comes and the chaos builds

598
00:31:01,331 --> 00:31:04,180
into the order and that's the world you
live in.

599
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:08,470
And that's not a metaphor.
And it's really interesting to know that

600
00:31:08,471 --> 00:31:10,600
because then the question becomes,
okay,

601
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:14,310
well what do you do in order?
And what do you do in chaos out?

602
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:17,620
Those are useful things to know.
We kind of know what to do in order

603
00:31:17,621 --> 00:31:19,900
because order that sort of defines
order,

604
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,690
but we don't really know what to do in
chaos,

605
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,600
you know,
in fact the field of mental health in

606
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:27,610
some senses and attempt to figure that
out.

607
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,540
But I can tell you some things to do
when you're in chaos.

608
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,270
So let's say you're dealing with someone
who's very,

609
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:39,271
very ill or maybe it's you that's very,
very ill and so god only knows what's

610
00:31:39,461 --> 00:31:42,970
going to happen in the future or even
next week.

611
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:47,350
Well the first thing you do is stop
thinking about next week and the future

612
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:50,320
because it's not calculable,
right?

613
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:53,500
The,
the pathways have become so multiple and

614
00:31:53,501 --> 00:31:57,190
so uncontrollable that if you think
about them,

615
00:31:57,191 --> 00:32:00,250
it's just going to hurt you.
And so,

616
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,740
you know,
you can't just not think about it

617
00:32:02,741 --> 00:32:06,040
because that doesn't work.
But what you can do is narrow your

618
00:32:06,041 --> 00:32:08,290
timeframe of analysis,
you know,

619
00:32:08,291 --> 00:32:10,030
so instead of worrying about the week,
you think,

620
00:32:10,031 --> 00:32:12,160
okay,
well let's make this day as good as it

621
00:32:12,161 --> 00:32:14,680
can be.
And then if you're really stressed it's

622
00:32:14,681 --> 00:32:15,250
like,
no,

623
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:20,170
we're going to really work on this hour.
And so what happens is you hyper at 10

624
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:25,171
to the local space time area and that's
what you've got.

625
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,790
You can work with that.
And it really works.

626
00:32:27,791 --> 00:32:29,500
Like if you're dealing with people who
are dying,

627
00:32:29,501 --> 00:32:31,120
for example,
that's what you do.

628
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:36,130
He was zero in to the,
to the right level of resolution

629
00:32:36,131 --> 00:32:38,470
fundamentally.
And you can tell when it's the right

630
00:32:38,471 --> 00:32:42,830
resume level of resolution because you
don't feel like you don't know what

631
00:32:42,831 --> 00:32:44,450
you're doing anymore.
What am I doing here?

632
00:32:44,451 --> 00:32:46,460
What am I supposed to do here?
What does all this mean?

633
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:49,760
You don't feel that anymore.
Cause those are the wrong questions at

634
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:51,130
that point in time.
And maybe,

635
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:53,210
you know,
try and make the person comfortable and

636
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:57,410
you pay attention so that you can take
the right micro movements and the right

637
00:32:57,411 --> 00:33:00,590
micro attitudes in those critical
moments.

638
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:03,980
And that's what you do.
And so that's one way of dealing with

639
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:06,170
the underworld.
And you need to know that because it's

640
00:33:06,171 --> 00:33:07,004
going to happen.

641
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,380
So,
so if you're really stressed,

642
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:12,650
you think about less,
you think about smaller amounts of space

643
00:33:12,651 --> 00:33:15,560
and time and you could try to get them
right.

644
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:20,450
It's still important to get it right,
but the entropy is so high at that

645
00:33:20,451 --> 00:33:23,480
point,
the landscape is so complicated that

646
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:28,040
there's no way you can map more of it
than a few moments out of time.

647
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:30,920
But it turns out often that that's,
that's okay,

648
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:33,140
that's good enough.
You know,

649
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:36,950
it's obviously it's not optimal,
but one thing you can be sure of is you

650
00:33:36,951 --> 00:33:40,580
can take a terrible situation and you
could make it a hell of a lot worse.

651
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,640
So you know,
if it's a terrible situation and you

652
00:33:43,641 --> 00:33:47,300
manage it as well as it can be managed
and maybe it's only terrible,

653
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,990
but if you take a terrible situation and
you manage it really badly,

654
00:33:50,991 --> 00:33:53,360
then it can be something you'll never
ever recover from.

655
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,400
So,
you know,

656
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:57,560
I'm not trying to be hyper optimistic
about this.

657
00:33:57,561 --> 00:33:59,900
I know that people go through rough
times,

658
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,690
but there's a difference between tragedy
and hale.

659
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,250
And tragedy is when something terrible
happens and unit and you're awake and

660
00:34:07,251 --> 00:34:11,600
hell is when something terrible happens
and you're not awake and that's a place

661
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:13,460
you really don't want to go.
You know?

662
00:34:13,461 --> 00:34:16,760
So then the death of your father could
turn it into the obliteration of your

663
00:34:16,761 --> 00:34:18,440
entire family.
Well,

664
00:34:18,441 --> 00:34:22,400
you know the first is bad enough,
but the second might well be unbearable.

665
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:24,140
You know,
cause people often fight in

666
00:34:24,141 --> 00:34:26,300
circumstances like that.
And you know,

667
00:34:26,301 --> 00:34:27,890
the family gets very,
very stressed.

668
00:34:27,891 --> 00:34:29,270
It's very common.
For example,

669
00:34:29,271 --> 00:34:32,000
if someone,
a couple has a sick child or a child

670
00:34:32,001 --> 00:34:34,940
that dies that they get divorced,
it's not surprising.

671
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,040
You know,
cause it's not like they have a

672
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:40,460
psychological problem,
they have a real problem and they might

673
00:34:40,461 --> 00:34:42,950
be amplifying it with their
psychological problems.

674
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:46,510
But all problems are not psychological.
You know?

675
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:50,030
And that's also useful to know because
if you end up somewhere that you don't

676
00:34:50,031 --> 00:34:52,250
expect,
you're going to be thinking,

677
00:34:52,251 --> 00:34:55,760
especially if you're conscientious,
if I wasn't such a useless fool,

678
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:58,370
I would've never ended up here.
Where,

679
00:34:58,371 --> 00:35:00,950
and there's a much more pessimistic
thought than that.

680
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,060
That's much more useful,
which is whether you are a fool or not,

681
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,400
you are going to end up somewhere like
big now and then.

682
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,750
And you might think,
God,

683
00:35:08,751 --> 00:35:10,730
that's a horrible thing to think because
you know,

684
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:15,080
that means that you know,
our destinies are uncontrollable.

685
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,670
At least in park.
It's like,

686
00:35:16,671 --> 00:35:17,720
yeah,
they are.

687
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,990
So partly what that means is prepare
yourself for that.

688
00:35:20,991 --> 00:35:25,991
And don't pound yourself into the ground
when you get there because it happens to

689
00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:28,790
people.
And it isn't necessarily the case that

690
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:31,820
the reason it happened to you is because
you're useless now that might have

691
00:35:31,821 --> 00:35:35,600
furthered the process and all that,
but you just don't need those thoughts

692
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:36,434
at that time.

693
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:38,970
You know,
all they do is undermine you.

694
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:40,080
And when you know,
yeah,

695
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,110
you know,
everybody's dog dies,

696
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:45,330
which is true.
It's like,

697
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:51,000
well,
it takes some of the guilt out of it and

698
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:54,060
the guilt is something that at that
point you don't really need.

699
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,523
Okay.
So

700
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:01,020
you've got your explored territory and
we've kind of walked through what that

701
00:36:01,021 --> 00:36:03,300
is and then you have your unexplored
territory.

702
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,910
No.
And then you have the sort of things

703
00:36:05,911 --> 00:36:09,030
that exist on the fringe.
I W I would say in some sense the things

704
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:11,640
that exist on the fringe,
closer to the unknown,

705
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,460
those are usually symbolized by the,
by the terrible mother.

706
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,240
And then the order is symbolized by the
terrible father.

707
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:23,100
And then the chaos that's beyond order
beyond knowing,

708
00:36:23,101 --> 00:36:26,100
that's beyond order in chaos.
That's the dragon of chaos.

709
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:27,960
Now it's a reptile,
right?

710
00:36:27,961 --> 00:36:31,920
A reptilian carnivores.
It's a reptilian carnivore that has a

711
00:36:31,921 --> 00:36:34,980
variety of interesting properties.
So let me show you some of the pictures

712
00:36:34,981 --> 00:36:38,190
that I've got here of the,
of the dragon of chaos.

713
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,283
This is a good one.

714
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,970
So that's a figure called a neuro
burrows.

715
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:48,510
And you could say in some sense that
that's one of the first graphical

716
00:36:48,511 --> 00:36:52,950
representations of the infinite,
you know,

717
00:36:52,951 --> 00:36:54,720
we have a symbol for infinity,
right?

718
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,370
And so,
which is another thing that's pretty

719
00:36:56,371 --> 00:36:59,730
weird to symbolize because you're
encapsulating something that can't be

720
00:36:59,731 --> 00:37:01,770
encapsulated inside a capsule.
Right?

721
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:06,030
It's very sneaky to be able to do that.
And you actually need it to do advanced

722
00:37:06,031 --> 00:37:09,030
mathematics of all sorts of kinds.
So you know,

723
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,870
so it's real,
at least in so far as you can use it as

724
00:37:12,871 --> 00:37:14,760
a tool.
So let me tell you a few things about

725
00:37:14,761 --> 00:37:16,950
this symbol.
This representation,

726
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:23,910
it's kind of like the Judeo Christian
idea of God being the Alpha and Omega,

727
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,210
which is this thing that exists at the
beginning of the time,

728
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,100
time,
all the way to the end of time.

729
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:32,550
So it's something that that exists
outside of time.

730
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:37,560
So you could think about this at one
level as the eternal presence of the

731
00:37:37,561 --> 00:37:40,290
Predator,
predators come and go.

732
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:45,080
The Predator never goes away.
So it's got this God,

733
00:37:45,081 --> 00:37:47,880
like you can say the spirit of the
Predator never disappears.

734
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,300
And as soon as you think that way,
well then you have some idea about what

735
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,840
archaic people were doing when they were
populating the world of spirits.

736
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,460
The difference between a spirit and an
abstract idea is like there's no

737
00:37:59,461 --> 00:38:01,050
difference.
You know,

738
00:38:01,051 --> 00:38:04,020
the spirit of the Predator and Hannah
inhabits the jungle.

739
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:04,830
It's like,
yeah,

740
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:07,530
that's for sure.
And you should be very careful about

741
00:38:07,531 --> 00:38:09,570
disturbing such spirits when you go in
there.

742
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,820
Well,
so then you might ask yourself,

743
00:38:11,821 --> 00:38:13,020
well,
what is a predator?

744
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:16,980
Well,
that's a complicated thing because you

745
00:38:16,981 --> 00:38:19,200
know,
we would say because we're

746
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:23,460
scientifically minded that you can take
predators and you could classify them

747
00:38:23,461 --> 00:38:27,090
according to their species and there are
subspecies in their Fila and all that

748
00:38:27,091 --> 00:38:27,570
sort of thing.

749
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:30,060
Right?
Then we think about classifying them as

750
00:38:30,061 --> 00:38:35,061
objects and then maybe in terms of their
evolutionary origins,

751
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,110
but that's not very helpful.
You know,

752
00:38:38,111 --> 00:38:40,900
if something jumps out in and he's wants
to eat you,

753
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,810
I mean,
knowing what it is might help you plot

754
00:38:43,811 --> 00:38:46,000
your escape,
but all those additional complexities,

755
00:38:46,001 --> 00:38:47,950
they're just not the relevant issue at
that point.

756
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:52,510
The realm of the issue is how do you
keep the predators out away from your

757
00:38:52,511 --> 00:38:54,700
explored territory?
Well,

758
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:57,700
that's a complicated question because
you might say,

759
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:04,540
what do you mean by that?
Do you mean right now,

760
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:09,490
while you're walking through the Bush,
you mean right now for you and your

761
00:39:09,491 --> 00:39:11,320
family?
Will all of you are walking through the

762
00:39:11,321 --> 00:39:13,840
bush.
There's this old joke about these two

763
00:39:13,841 --> 00:39:17,620
guys that go out in the forest and one
guy says to the other,

764
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:22,980
there's grizzly bears here and
so you have to be careful.

765
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:26,380
And then the other guy says,
well,

766
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,580
how fast can you run?
And the first guy says,

767
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:33,580
well don't you mean how fast does the
Grizzly bear rug?

768
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,520
And the first guy says,
no,

769
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,890
that is not what I mean.
I just want to know if I can run faster

770
00:39:38,891 --> 00:39:41,230
than you.
Right,

771
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:41,921
right.
So,

772
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,480
so right.
And the reason I'm telling you that

773
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:48,481
stupid joke is because what you want as
an answer to the question depends on

774
00:39:49,871 --> 00:39:54,490
exactly how you put the question.
And so the answer there was,

775
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:57,730
well,
I don't care if the grizzly bear eats

776
00:39:57,731 --> 00:39:59,770
someone as long as it's not me.
Okay,

777
00:39:59,771 --> 00:40:01,510
fine.
So that's one answer to the question.

778
00:40:01,511 --> 00:40:03,190
But then you might think,
well,

779
00:40:03,191 --> 00:40:07,420
let's keep the grizzly bears away from
me now my family now,

780
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,650
ah,
my tribe now me tomorrow,

781
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,080
my family tomorrow,
my tribe tomorrow,

782
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,830
then across the week,
then across the month,

783
00:40:17,831 --> 00:40:20,470
then across the years,
then maybe forever.

784
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,600
Okay.
So how is it that you have to act so

785
00:40:22,601 --> 00:40:25,280
that you keep the predators away?
Wow.

786
00:40:25,281 --> 00:40:29,720
That starts to become an extraordinarily
complicated problem because the simplest

787
00:40:29,721 --> 00:40:31,120
solution might be,
well,

788
00:40:31,121 --> 00:40:34,330
when there's a Predator around climb a
tree or run into a whole,

789
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,060
which is what lots of animals do,
you know,

790
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:39,850
but it's pretty partial solution.
They don't get eaten that day.

791
00:40:39,851 --> 00:40:44,380
But what about tomorrow when the
predators little hungrier and kind of a

792
00:40:44,381 --> 00:40:46,540
bonehead and solutional things
considered.

793
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,610
So then you might say,
well if we thought of the spirit of the

794
00:40:51,611 --> 00:40:55,780
Predator,
which is more like the fact that there

795
00:40:55,781 --> 00:40:58,990
is a class of predators and they're
never going to go away,

796
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:03,970
then miss that question we have to
answer is how do we act so that that

797
00:41:03,971 --> 00:41:07,240
class that's eternal doesn't bother us
anymore than necessary?

798
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:11,140
Well that's really complicated,
really,

799
00:41:11,141 --> 00:41:13,810
really complicated because it might mean
in some sense,

800
00:41:13,811 --> 00:41:18,280
well how should you act because
conquering the problem of having your

801
00:41:18,281 --> 00:41:23,281
territory invaded cause there's not just
like reptilian and Mammalian predators.

802
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,930
Right.
Like third things with teeth.

803
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:30,490
There's other people and like there are
a lot worse than anything else that is

804
00:41:30,491 --> 00:41:32,860
going to come at you.
So you also have that problem.

805
00:41:32,861 --> 00:41:36,950
How You keep yourself away from the
predatory people and the foreign tribes

806
00:41:36,951 --> 00:41:39,890
that are going to invade your land
didn't take it well.

807
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,970
So there's,
there's no difference between that

808
00:41:43,971 --> 00:41:46,490
question.
And how do you establish the security of

809
00:41:46,491 --> 00:41:49,430
a nation,
roughly speaking or maybe even how do

810
00:41:49,431 --> 00:41:51,410
you establish peace?
You know what I mean?

811
00:41:51,411 --> 00:41:54,320
It's a question that it doesn't have
obvious borders.

812
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:57,860
Okay?
So one answer might be stay away from

813
00:41:57,861 --> 00:41:58,850
the dam.
Predators.

814
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,430
Okay,
so you build a big wall or someone else

815
00:42:01,431 --> 00:42:05,780
does and you hide inside the walls.
Well that's not a bad solution.

816
00:42:05,781 --> 00:42:08,870
And of course that's what people started
to do when they originally built cities.

817
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:13,910
They built these big walls like trump is
going to build between Canada and the U

818
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:17,330
S and,
and it'll keep the predators out.

819
00:42:17,331 --> 00:42:19,370
But of course,
what do we know from the story of

820
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:24,371
genesis and from the Taoist symbol,
no matter how big the wall is,

821
00:42:24,381 --> 00:42:28,220
you can't keep out the damn snakes.
So you build a wall and all the snakes

822
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:31,580
pop up inside.
So it's not a very good solution.

823
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:33,170
And you know,
that's pretty obvious,

824
00:42:33,171 --> 00:42:34,400
right?
I mean,

825
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,900
my suspicions are that,
uh,

826
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:41,270
mass shooters who are native to the
United States kill a lot more people in

827
00:42:41,271 --> 00:42:44,840
the u s every week that Mexican,
illegal Mexican immigrants.

828
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:46,780
So,
well,

829
00:42:46,781 --> 00:42:49,430
soul looks like what problem,
exactly are you solving?

830
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:52,863
Yup.

831
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:01,220
Okay.
So the first question you have to solve

832
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:03,700
when you're,
see,

833
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,660
there's no point,
there's just no solution to this

834
00:43:05,661 --> 00:43:06,494
problem.

835
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:10,263
Okay.

836
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,720
So why did you laugh at that

837
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,010
do you think?
Cause it opened again and there was

838
00:43:26,011 --> 00:43:26,844
unexpected.

839
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,570
Yeah,
but why didn't that terrify you walk.

840
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,160
But you know what's related to the
hierarchy at she,

841
00:43:33,161 --> 00:43:34,930
right?
Because like the door isn't behaving

842
00:43:34,931 --> 00:43:37,120
properly.
So like what's funny about that?

843
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,670
Well,
it's funny to watch someone,

844
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:45,760
someone's little routine not work.
When the consequences are trivial.

845
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:47,980
It's like,
oh well he knows how to close the door.

846
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,430
It's not working.
So now he's got the problem of this door

847
00:43:51,431 --> 00:43:53,740
and that's a stupid problem.
So everybody could laugh about it,

848
00:43:53,741 --> 00:43:55,540
you know?
So little,

849
00:43:55,570 --> 00:44:00,040
little,
little anomalies that you could bind

850
00:44:00,041 --> 00:44:02,320
quickly are comical,
you know,

851
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,560
and I think it's an indication to tell
you the truth.

852
00:44:05,561 --> 00:44:08,690
I think it's an indication of people's
transcendent ability.

853
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:12,520
Because what happens,
comedians do this with you too,

854
00:44:12,521 --> 00:44:13,360
you know,
so you'd be,

855
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:14,830
you'd be sitting in the audience,
a comedian,

856
00:44:14,831 --> 00:44:16,570
I'll say this thing,
and then this thing,

857
00:44:16,571 --> 00:44:18,970
and they're connected some way,
but it's not obvious.

858
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:23,260
And then you go click and you,
and it's like everybody celebrates their

859
00:44:23,261 --> 00:44:24,340
brilliance together.
It's like,

860
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,031
oh,
I get it.

861
00:44:25,031 --> 00:44:26,740
Ha ha ha aren't nice,
smart.

862
00:44:26,741 --> 00:44:29,560
And it's,
it transforms you into the pub from the

863
00:44:29,561 --> 00:44:33,180
puzzle thing into the thing.
And everyone really likes that.

864
00:44:33,181 --> 00:44:33,841
It's like,
yes,

865
00:44:33,841 --> 00:44:34,770
we solved.
It's like,

866
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:35,730
wait,
we can go and,

867
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:36,900
you know,
combat down,

868
00:44:36,901 --> 00:44:38,580
known together.
So,

869
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:41,520
all right,
so you got this chaos thing here.

870
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:43,950
Now that's,
as I said,

871
00:44:43,951 --> 00:44:46,750
that's called a neuro burrows.
And they're,

872
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:49,110
the reason it's got its tail in it's
mouth is,

873
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:50,131
it's,
it's,

874
00:44:50,131 --> 00:44:50,911
uh,
it's,

875
00:44:50,911 --> 00:44:53,100
uh,
the idea that that's trying to represent

876
00:44:53,101 --> 00:44:55,620
is that this thing is complete unto
itself.

877
00:44:56,250 --> 00:45:00,060
So it's a symbol of totality.
It's everything.

878
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:05,190
How well you walk into the room where
your interview is.

879
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,410
You might say,
what's in there?

880
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:09,900
While a better question is what's not in
there.

881
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:14,760
That's a better question because your
whole damn futures in there,

882
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:18,070
and you don't even know how much that
branches your futures.

883
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,890
They're the future of your children is
in there.

884
00:45:19,891 --> 00:45:21,720
The future of your grandchildren is in
there.

885
00:45:21,721 --> 00:45:25,110
You know,
there's these waves that go out from

886
00:45:25,111 --> 00:45:28,650
that room that that in some sense,
especially if you stretch them forward

887
00:45:28,651 --> 00:45:31,020
in time,
they have almost no boundary.

888
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:32,700
You know?
I mean,

889
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,400
I dunno.
Each of us is descended from one person.

890
00:45:35,401 --> 00:45:37,230
I don't remember how many millions of
years ago,

891
00:45:37,231 --> 00:45:41,700
but it's not that many to,
maybe it's even earlier than that,

892
00:45:41,701 --> 00:45:43,950
650,000 years,
something like that.

893
00:45:43,951 --> 00:45:47,070
So for all you know,
what do you could be like the person who

894
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:49,200
through whom the entire human race
lives,

895
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:52,710
and maybe it's because you made the
right decision in that interview.

896
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:55,920
My point is,
is that potential itself has no

897
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:57,870
boundary,
no obvious boundary,

898
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,660
and you don't know what you're messing
with when you're messing with it.

899
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:02,550
It's very,
very complicated.

900
00:46:02,551 --> 00:46:04,560
So how should you do it?
Well,

901
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:06,630
this figure says,
well,

902
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:09,810
you better watch out because some of
it's predatory and the crawls along the

903
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:12,960
ground and it's got teeth and it's no
damn joke.

904
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:14,790
And so then you can think it's sort of
snake,

905
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:16,590
like a snake,
sneak around through the,

906
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,420
through the grass and then it sort of
crocodile light because snakes don't

907
00:46:21,421 --> 00:46:22,650
have teeth,
but crocodile.

908
00:46:22,651 --> 00:46:25,080
Sure the hell do.
And so do other predatory lizards.

909
00:46:25,081 --> 00:46:27,900
And you know,
as we've talked about before,

910
00:46:27,901 --> 00:46:32,901
the probability that our ancestral
planes dwelling African ancestors were

911
00:46:33,511 --> 00:46:37,860
regularly lunched upon by crocodiles.
It's pretty damn high because how else

912
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:39,810
would they get water?
You know,

913
00:46:39,811 --> 00:46:43,290
and you gotta be pretty mean before you
can take on a Nile crocodile.

914
00:46:43,291 --> 00:46:45,810
I mean,
I'm sure we did that fairly early in our

915
00:46:45,811 --> 00:46:48,060
evolutionary history,
but before that we were,

916
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,880
a lot of us were snacks for lizards.
So,

917
00:46:50,881 --> 00:46:52,800
which seems like just not good,
you know?

918
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,293
So,

919
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,710
okay,

920
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:58,670
so this thing also lives in a whole
dragon.

921
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,550
It's usually live in holes or
underground,

922
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:03,820
like Harry Potter's Basilisk and usually
they're immortal.

923
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,410
They live in a cave,
there were mortal,

924
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,880
right?
They live forever.

925
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:09,550
You don't want to bother them because
then they pop out of their whole,

926
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:12,710
like they do in the hobbit and they come
and burn down your village.

927
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,880
Like leave the damn dragon alone.
Well,

928
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:18,370
yes and no.
Why not leave it alone?

929
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:22,480
Well,
maybe it would be better to go get the

930
00:47:22,481 --> 00:47:25,660
dragon before it gives you that
certainly possible.

931
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,880
And then there's this other weird thing
about dragons,

932
00:47:27,881 --> 00:47:31,750
which is that they hoard.
So maybe you can go and confront the

933
00:47:31,751 --> 00:47:35,470
dragon and you get the treasurer and the
treasurer takes basically two forms.

934
00:47:35,471 --> 00:47:39,100
So there's the St George story where the
treasure is often an,

935
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:39,890
uh,
like,

936
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:43,930
uh,
trapped young female and other version

937
00:47:43,931 --> 00:47:44,764
is,
well,

938
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:48,460
the dragon sits on gold.
Now what's the whole idea there?

939
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:51,700
Well,
maybe the best way to overcome

940
00:47:51,701 --> 00:47:54,340
predators,
the spirit of the creditor is to

941
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:55,330
confronted.

942
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,080
Well,
that's a hell of an idea.

943
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:00,820
Then you might think,
well,

944
00:48:00,821 --> 00:48:04,630
how deep an idea is that you confront
the Predator,

945
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:05,740
you get the gold.
Well,

946
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:09,530
this is that you confront infinite
possibility and you get the,

947
00:48:09,531 --> 00:48:12,670
the,
the reward you encounter infinite

948
00:48:12,671 --> 00:48:17,230
possibility properly.
You derive from it the rewards that it

949
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:19,240
offers.
What are the rewards that infinite

950
00:48:19,241 --> 00:48:22,630
possibility offers?
Who knows?

951
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,450
Right.
We have no idea.

952
00:48:24,451 --> 00:48:28,660
And it's so interesting because we live
at a time in history where that's

953
00:48:28,661 --> 00:48:32,260
literally true.
Like I would hesitate to predict

954
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,620
anything about 50 years from now,
I have,

955
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,810
I have,
I quit worrying about the future,

956
00:48:37,811 --> 00:48:40,240
about 20 years ago because I thought,
oh,

957
00:48:40,241 --> 00:48:42,760
I get it.
No matter what happens,

958
00:48:42,761 --> 00:48:45,460
the probability that it's something I
predict is zero.

959
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:48,160
So it's like whatever you're worried
about,

960
00:48:48,161 --> 00:48:51,130
well I'll go ahead and worry about it,
but something completely different is

961
00:48:51,131 --> 00:48:52,060
going to happen.
So,

962
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:57,640
so it's not really all that useful.
Just be ready for whatever comes because

963
00:48:57,641 --> 00:48:59,140
here it comes,
you know,

964
00:48:59,141 --> 00:49:03,310
like I think where I'll have fully
functional autonomous robots within

965
00:49:03,311 --> 00:49:05,170
three or four years.
So,

966
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,240
and that's like,
that's a real game changer,

967
00:49:07,241 --> 00:49:09,360
you know?
And God only knows what's going to

968
00:49:09,361 --> 00:49:12,220
happen after that.
Transplantable organs,

969
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,830
those things.
Or you can print those on three d

970
00:49:14,831 --> 00:49:17,440
printers already.
What else?

971
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:19,900
Well,
augmented intelligence,

972
00:49:19,901 --> 00:49:21,910
while you're,
you all have augmented intelligence

973
00:49:21,911 --> 00:49:23,780
already.
What good are facts?

974
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,080
He's look them up,
right?

975
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:29,950
Everyone's an infinite supply and facts.

976
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:34,290
Can you explain and different words why
the Dragon?

977
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:41,300
Because it has everything it needs.
That's,

978
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:43,920
that's another way of thinking about it.
So it's,

979
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:45,570
it's self contained.
It doesn't,

980
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:49,290
it doesn't need anything outside of
itself and there isn't anything outside

981
00:49:49,291 --> 00:49:54,030
of itself.
So it doesn't rely on anything to exist.

982
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,430
That's another way of thinking about,
it's just there.

983
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:01,820
And so there's an echo of the idea there
that that of have an idea of beyond time

984
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:06,360
or,
I don't know so much beyond space but

985
00:50:06,361 --> 00:50:09,510
certainly be on time.
Time has no effect on it.

986
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,420
So it's beyond time in that sense.
Yeah.

987
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:17,760
There's another reason has its tell
snuff and that's because it represents

988
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:22,800
the border between the known world and
all its goodness and badness.

989
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:27,940
Unknown world order can get smaller

990
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:31,730
as it gets more of its tail.
Right,

991
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,020
right.
Okay,

992
00:50:33,021 --> 00:50:37,070
so now it has wings.
Why does it have links?

993
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:39,293
Okay,

994
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:42,720
well this is another horribly
complicated thing.

995
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:48,000
I'll show you a diagram.
This is the closest I've been able to

996
00:50:48,001 --> 00:50:52,310
get to it.
I often don't talk about this diagram,

997
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:58,180
but I guess I am today.
Yeah.

998
00:51:21,131 --> 00:51:21,881
Okay,
let's,

999
00:51:21,881 --> 00:51:26,550
we must go through this completely.
Okay.

1000
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:27,690
So here's you.

1001
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:36,573
So

1002
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,520
if you look right in the middle there,
here I'll,

1003
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:40,403
I'll make it bigger

1004
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:42,490
so that you can see it.

1005
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,040
You kind of think that you're right
here.

1006
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:49,710
This is sort of where your consciousness
normally sits.

1007
00:51:49,711 --> 00:51:52,320
Like you know,
are you yourself that's sort of your

1008
00:51:52,321 --> 00:51:55,140
conscious body envelope and all that.
Are you your family?

1009
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:59,520
Well you know the border there is rather
pliable.

1010
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:04,050
Well then you can go,
you can drill down into the self and

1011
00:52:04,051 --> 00:52:05,940
this is sort of the idea of the
hierarchy.

1012
00:52:05,941 --> 00:52:07,830
You know,
you can look at principles.

1013
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:11,730
So those are your general philosophical
beliefs and then your programs and then

1014
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:15,480
the sequence of behaviors that you
instantiate that in and then your

1015
00:52:15,481 --> 00:52:18,570
behaviors.
And then you can go below that even.

1016
00:52:18,571 --> 00:52:23,490
And you can think of yourself as well
because when you're behaving well,

1017
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:24,840
how,
what's under that?

1018
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:25,620
What,
what,

1019
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:27,420
what,
what's the support for that?

1020
00:52:27,421 --> 00:52:28,590
The platform for that?
Well,

1021
00:52:28,591 --> 00:52:29,760
it's your body,
right?

1022
00:52:29,761 --> 00:52:31,110
So what's there?
Well,

1023
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:35,280
once you get past the level of arm,
it's sort of like musculature and then

1024
00:52:35,281 --> 00:52:36,001
you might say,
well,

1025
00:52:36,001 --> 00:52:37,260
what's,
you know,

1026
00:52:37,261 --> 00:52:38,730
what's under that?
Or what's,

1027
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:40,080
what's,
what's next?

1028
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:42,150
Well,
you have your cellular structure.

1029
00:52:42,151 --> 00:52:45,570
And so that's what cellular biologist
studying God,

1030
00:52:45,571 --> 00:52:48,000
that's so complex.
And then below that,

1031
00:52:48,001 --> 00:52:50,430
while you have your molecular structures
like Dna,

1032
00:52:50,431 --> 00:52:52,560
and then underneath that there's an
atomic structure.

1033
00:52:52,561 --> 00:52:55,090
And then underneath that there's the
subatomic structure.

1034
00:52:55,091 --> 00:52:57,750
And what are you going to say about
that?

1035
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:01,290
There wasn't even time at that level.
So,

1036
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:06,820
and then you can do the same thing if
you go up,

1037
00:53:06,821 --> 00:53:09,130
it's like people say,
well you shouldn't just pay attention to

1038
00:53:09,131 --> 00:53:10,420
your family.
It's like you're,

1039
00:53:10,421 --> 00:53:12,550
you're in a cultural group.
They're important too.

1040
00:53:12,551 --> 00:53:14,560
And well,
what about the biological group that

1041
00:53:14,561 --> 00:53:16,900
that's nested in?
And maybe you should be paying more

1042
00:53:16,901 --> 00:53:19,520
attention to the ecosystem rather than
to yourself.

1043
00:53:19,521 --> 00:53:22,630
And you know,
you shade upward into this thing that

1044
00:53:22,631 --> 00:53:26,370
you can't really,
you can't really dissociate yourself

1045
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:29,340
from Arthur now.
So you know,

1046
00:53:29,341 --> 00:53:31,830
so that's what you are.
Make no mistake about it.

1047
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,970
Like you will,
your consciousness is such that you only

1048
00:53:35,971 --> 00:53:40,971
are located at in some sense at one
level of observation and that God only

1049
00:53:41,011 --> 00:53:43,140
knows why that is.
It's almost as if,

1050
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:47,310
you know,
being has to come to a pinpoint in order

1051
00:53:47,311 --> 00:53:48,990
for,
for things to exist.

1052
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:51,540
The way I've been thinking about it in
some senses,

1053
00:53:51,541 --> 00:53:55,380
like you could take ever all of this
structure and you know,

1054
00:53:55,410 --> 00:54:00,410
narrow it down to a single point of a
pencil that's writing and the writing is

1055
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:03,060
the transformation of potential into
actuality.

1056
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:04,770
But in order to do that,
you have to,

1057
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:08,940
you there has to be a point of contact
between you and potential.

1058
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:11,150
And that's,
that's your body and part.

1059
00:54:11,151 --> 00:54:14,220
But it's even narrower than that.
It's whatever occupies your,

1060
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:19,320
this tiny little laser beam of attention
while you're wandering through the

1061
00:54:19,321 --> 00:54:21,340
world.
And it's like burning reality into

1062
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,230
being,
you know,

1063
00:54:22,231 --> 00:54:24,720
so why that is,
I mean,

1064
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:26,460
God,
who knows?

1065
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:30,030
It's beyond strange.
Now,

1066
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:33,960
you know,
one way of thinking about this whole

1067
00:54:33,961 --> 00:54:38,160
structure is that you can think about it
as the psychological world because

1068
00:54:38,161 --> 00:54:40,680
you're at the center of it.
Or you can think about it as the

1069
00:54:40,681 --> 00:54:43,020
spiritual world.
If you think about spirit as a

1070
00:54:43,021 --> 00:54:46,590
manifestation of consciousness,
it's not a material world anyways.

1071
00:54:46,591 --> 00:54:49,980
Or if it is,
it's the material world in so far as

1072
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:53,820
it's you as a living conscious being.
So you know,

1073
00:54:53,821 --> 00:54:56,640
we tend to separate out consciousness
and matter,

1074
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,670
right?
I mean I'm conscious that that's

1075
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:02,700
something we are,
we don't take this table is so we think

1076
00:55:02,701 --> 00:55:05,340
of them as separate substances in a
sense.

1077
00:55:05,350 --> 00:55:07,830
Spirit and matter.
Well that's what that dragon is.

1078
00:55:07,831 --> 00:55:10,200
It's half matter.
That's the thing that's crawling around

1079
00:55:10,201 --> 00:55:13,140
on the ground and it's half spirit and
that's the Wayne's.

1080
00:55:13,141 --> 00:55:16,290
And that's many might say,
well why the hell is the dragon half

1081
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:20,850
spirit and half matter
while we've got the spirit park?

1082
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:23,010
I just showed you it.
So now I'm going to show you the

1083
00:55:23,011 --> 00:55:23,850
mattered park.

1084
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:26,200
That's worse.

1085
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:43,640
Okay.
So we could say,

1086
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,290
well what's that?
Well,

1087
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,120
it's,
it's a chair.

1088
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,330
You think that's pretty straight
forward?

1089
00:55:53,331 --> 00:55:56,150
It's actually not.
And I can tell you why very rapidly.

1090
00:55:56,830 --> 00:55:58,370
Um,
why is it a chair?

1091
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:02,870
How would a bean bag,

1092
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,430
is that a chair?
Because we can sit in it.

1093
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:07,490
That's right.
Yes.

1094
00:56:07,491 --> 00:56:11,120
Because we can sit in it and that seems
to be the fundamental issue.

1095
00:56:11,121 --> 00:56:15,260
Is this a chair?
It can be,

1096
00:56:15,261 --> 00:56:15,861
yeah.
Yeah.

1097
00:56:15,861 --> 00:56:19,570
You'd say it's not a canonical chair and
neither is a bean bag chair.

1098
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:22,070
It could be a bean bag or a stump.
But you know,

1099
00:56:22,071 --> 00:56:26,080
that's sort of a canonical chair.
But part of my point is,

1100
00:56:26,081 --> 00:56:30,220
you know the typical answer that people
will give when you ask why is that a

1101
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:32,920
chairs that they'll lay out the
objective structure,

1102
00:56:32,921 --> 00:56:36,070
which is really no,
that's only a tiny bit of why it's a

1103
00:56:36,071 --> 00:56:36,841
chair.
You know,

1104
00:56:36,841 --> 00:56:40,060
if it was that high,
well would it be a chair?

1105
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:45,130
It has to have the right structure and
the right function in order for it to be

1106
00:56:45,131 --> 00:56:47,440
a chair.
And so what that means is that thing

1107
00:56:47,441 --> 00:56:51,580
which is an object is already only
existing in relationship to you in some

1108
00:56:51,581 --> 00:56:52,414
important sense.

1109
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:53,860
But I can also say,
well,

1110
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:57,880
it's part of the classroom.
What's the classroom partner?

1111
00:56:57,910 --> 00:57:01,150
Well that's part of Sid Smith.
This chair is part of Sid Smith.

1112
00:57:01,151 --> 00:57:03,790
And what Sid Smith part of,
well it's part of the university.

1113
00:57:03,791 --> 00:57:05,920
And what's the university part of?
Well God,

1114
00:57:05,921 --> 00:57:08,290
it's part of all sorts of things,
but we could say it's,

1115
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:11,080
it's a piece of the city.
It's a chunk of the province.

1116
00:57:11,081 --> 00:57:15,340
It's a bat of the country.
And then it's west nested inside a much

1117
00:57:15,341 --> 00:57:19,060
broader civilization than that.
So that's sort of going up from the

1118
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:22,450
chair and you could say,
well that's not read the chair.

1119
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:23,501
And I could say,
well,

1120
00:57:23,501 --> 00:57:27,820
if that thing was floating at some point
halfway between the sun and Pluto,

1121
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:31,030
I don't think considering it and a chair
would be reasonable,

1122
00:57:31,510 --> 00:57:32,980
you know,
because well,

1123
00:57:32,981 --> 00:57:34,420
for obvious reasons,
you know,

1124
00:57:34,421 --> 00:57:37,900
you can decontextualize something so
completely that it isn't what it is

1125
00:57:37,901 --> 00:57:38,440
anymore.

1126
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:41,050
It's not that hard.
So you know,

1127
00:57:41,051 --> 00:57:42,910
when you kind of do that to yourself,
when you say,

1128
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:43,721
well,
who cares?

1129
00:57:43,721 --> 00:57:46,090
Why is this important?
Who's going to know in a million years?

1130
00:57:46,091 --> 00:57:46,721
It's like,
poof,

1131
00:57:46,721 --> 00:57:49,750
you're decontextualized.
It's like it's a stupid trick.

1132
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:53,050
It's like a party trick for intellect.
It's a stupid trick,

1133
00:57:53,051 --> 00:57:54,910
you know,
because anybody can do it.

1134
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:58,090
And what does it mean?
It means you're looking at it from the

1135
00:57:58,091 --> 00:57:59,890
wrong perspective.
That's what it means.

1136
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,770
So it's not like it's an ultimate
question.

1137
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:05,650
You wouldn't be able to think about in
15 seconds if it was an ultimate

1138
00:58:05,651 --> 00:58:07,090
question,
you know,

1139
00:58:07,091 --> 00:58:09,640
so,
but then you can do the same thing with

1140
00:58:09,641 --> 00:58:12,610
the chair that you did with yourself
when you zoom into it.

1141
00:58:12,611 --> 00:58:13,760
Right?
So it's,

1142
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,900
it's made of parts obviously.
And then the parts are made out of sub

1143
00:58:16,901 --> 00:58:19,990
parts and so forth,
all the way down to the subatomic level

1144
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:22,150
and the chairs,
all those things at the same time.

1145
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:25,540
Okay.
So then you might say,

1146
00:58:25,541 --> 00:58:28,420
well what do you encounter when you
encounter the unknown?

1147
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:34,870
And that's what you'll encounter?
I think.

1148
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:38,770
So let's take a look at this and you can
think about this.

1149
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,580
So weird idea.
Okay.

1150
00:58:42,581 --> 00:58:44,230
So you've got your little frame of
reference,

1151
00:58:44,231 --> 00:58:46,840
right?
You're going from point a to point b and

1152
00:58:46,841 --> 00:58:48,580
then when you're going from point a to
point b,

1153
00:58:48,581 --> 00:58:51,310
something that you didn't want to happen
happens.

1154
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,820
And we already know that it can be a
little thing that happens and then you

1155
00:58:54,821 --> 00:58:56,830
know,
Haha it's funding or it can be like your

1156
00:58:56,831 --> 00:58:59,500
whole world falls apart and then it's a
catastrophe.

1157
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:03,130
But let's say it's something like the
interview.

1158
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:07,120
So I would say that sort of a mid level
anomaly,

1159
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:08,260
right?
You walk in,

1160
00:59:08,261 --> 00:59:11,170
there's a lot in there,
but you can handle it weirdly enough.

1161
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:15,580
And I suppose that's because there's
other places you can go where there are

1162
00:59:15,581 --> 00:59:18,580
potential futures lying.
So it's not like you're out of potential

1163
00:59:18,581 --> 00:59:20,920
futures just because you walk through
that.

1164
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:22,880
So when you say,
well,

1165
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:25,080
what's in that room is,
it's anomalous,

1166
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:27,890
you don't understand it,
it's unformed matter.

1167
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,740
Now you might say,
someone might say,

1168
00:59:30,741 --> 00:59:33,650
uh,
does this interview matter to you?

1169
00:59:34,190 --> 00:59:37,280
You think?
That's pretty weird question because

1170
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:40,970
things are made out of matter.
So what does it mean when you say,

1171
00:59:40,971 --> 00:59:43,130
does this matter to you?
Well,

1172
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:46,250
partly what it means is that before
matter was our matter.

1173
00:59:46,251 --> 00:59:49,760
It was a matter that was more
complicated linguistically speaking.

1174
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:52,490
So back,
if you go back far enough,

1175
00:59:52,491 --> 00:59:56,900
what people meant by matter wasn't this,
it was,

1176
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:01,790
it was more like,
I would say it's more like potential or

1177
01:00:01,791 --> 01:00:04,490
it's more like information.
That's another way of thinking about it.

1178
01:00:04,491 --> 01:00:07,250
So you could certainly say that room was
chocked full of information.

1179
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:10,640
So,
so let's go with the information idea.

1180
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:13,700
Just for the sake of argument.
We already talked about it as potential.

1181
01:00:13,701 --> 01:00:16,130
Let's talk about it as information.
Both of those work.

1182
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:19,250
You walk in there and you start
interacting with people.

1183
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,860
Okay.
And then you leave later and you know,

1184
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:22,690
you,
you,

1185
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:25,190
you tell your partner,
they say,

1186
01:00:25,191 --> 01:00:26,720
well I went for this interview and they
say,

1187
01:00:26,721 --> 01:00:28,400
how did it go?
And you say,

1188
01:00:28,401 --> 01:00:32,360
well I didn't go very well but I learned
some things cause you could say that.

1189
01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:35,090
Right.
Well so I would say you went into that

1190
01:00:35,091 --> 01:00:38,090
room and you extracted some spirit out
of the potential.

1191
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,740
Now that's exactly how piaget looked at
it,

1192
01:00:42,741 --> 01:00:45,080
by the way.
Well I shouldn't say exactly because you

1193
01:00:45,081 --> 01:00:47,420
know,
it's probably not exactly the way he

1194
01:00:47,421 --> 01:00:50,270
looked at it.
But basically what piaget proclaimed

1195
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:54,410
with children was that children have
tried a little routine and then

1196
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:57,410
something will happen that doesn't fit
in their little routine.

1197
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:01,160
And so they all investigate it using
whatever tools they have at hand.

1198
01:01:01,161 --> 01:01:03,020
Some of it's trial and error and some of
it's,

1199
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:06,920
you know,
they try out other tool like embodiments

1200
01:01:06,921 --> 01:01:09,410
of their body that have worked in the
past.

1201
01:01:09,411 --> 01:01:13,430
So for example,
the first thing I say a nine month old,

1202
01:01:13,431 --> 01:01:17,240
we'll do crawling around on the floor.
If it encounters something that's

1203
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:20,210
roughly mouth sized,
we'll put it in her mouth.

1204
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:22,550
Why?
Well they don't know what it is,

1205
01:01:22,551 --> 01:01:24,190
but they don't kind of how to use their
mouse.

1206
01:01:24,191 --> 01:01:25,640
So they throw it in their mouth and then
they,

1207
01:01:25,641 --> 01:01:26,740
Tom Hinten,
you know,

1208
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:30,250
they get some sense of how it tastes,
which is very important and what its

1209
01:01:30,251 --> 01:01:31,340
shape is and all of that.

1210
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:34,400
Cause they're very wired up in their
mouth and so they can investigate like

1211
01:01:34,401 --> 01:01:38,360
mad.
And so what they encounter is a thing.

1212
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:40,700
And then when they throw it in their
mouth,

1213
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:44,360
they practice doing something with it,
you know,

1214
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:46,550
getting a shape.
So now they know something about it.

1215
01:01:46,551 --> 01:01:49,430
So that changes them from a spiritual
perspective,

1216
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:52,430
a psychological perspective.
Now they're slightly different than they

1217
01:01:52,431 --> 01:01:54,710
were.
They've incorporated some information

1218
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:59,630
and they've also transformed the thing
into a specific thing with specific

1219
01:01:59,631 --> 01:02:02,270
features.
And so what you might say is that out of

1220
01:02:02,271 --> 01:02:06,770
potential spirit and matter arise,
and it's a very interesting way of

1221
01:02:06,771 --> 01:02:08,540
looking about looking at it.
Also,

1222
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:13,720
it fits well with the phenomenological
philosophers because they believe that

1223
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:19,780
we encountered phenomenon and phenomena
where those phenomena were those things

1224
01:02:21,421 --> 01:02:24,900
that sean forth.
And so that's like a reversion to the

1225
01:02:24,901 --> 01:02:28,200
idea of meaning,
because you got to think about it this

1226
01:02:28,201 --> 01:02:28,650
way too.

1227
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:33,240
It's like when you walk into a library,
God,

1228
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:34,650
what's in there?
Well,

1229
01:02:36,290 --> 01:02:38,100
it's inexhaustible.
The library.

1230
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:40,350
Well,
how come you just don't get exhausted?

1231
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:42,420
Well,
that's because you're not actually

1232
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:46,800
interacting with the whole library.
You've got this focal point like the

1233
01:02:46,801 --> 01:02:49,740
laser again,
and you've made it into a focal point

1234
01:02:49,741 --> 01:02:51,870
because you're inside that hierarchical
structure,

1235
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,400
right?
And so you say,

1236
01:02:53,401 --> 01:02:55,410
well,
I'm in the library to get this book.

1237
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:57,750
I'm getting this book to read this
chapter.

1238
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:00,000
So chapter book,
Library,

1239
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:04,440
I'm going to university,
I need to become educated and get a job

1240
01:03:04,441 --> 01:03:06,660
so that I'll be a good citizen and a
good person.

1241
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:08,340
And so that's what you're doing in the
library.

1242
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,560
You're just doing one little fragment of
that.

1243
01:03:10,561 --> 01:03:13,350
And the more you have that whole model
developed,

1244
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:17,100
right all the way from good person right
down to why you were in the library,

1245
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:20,910
the more precise your aim is,
the more you know what you're doing,

1246
01:03:20,911 --> 01:03:24,660
the less encumbered by doubt and
uncertainty you are and the higher

1247
01:03:24,661 --> 01:03:29,661
probability you have of focusing on your
task and then writing the past that you

1248
01:03:30,061 --> 01:03:33,630
want to be into Ba and so well.

1249
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:37,230
So it's very useful to think about
things this way and it's also very

1250
01:03:37,231 --> 01:03:39,240
interesting to note that that's how you
act.

1251
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:43,050
You actually act like the world has made
this way and it's even weirder because

1252
01:03:43,710 --> 01:03:46,860
this is the case that I made for you
when we were talking about the structure

1253
01:03:46,861 --> 01:03:49,830
of the brain,
it actually looks like this is how your

1254
01:03:49,831 --> 01:03:53,760
brain construes the world and because
you have systems,

1255
01:03:53,761 --> 01:03:56,610
you've got the system that works.
When you know what you're doing and

1256
01:03:56,611 --> 01:03:59,250
you've got the other system that works
when you don't know what you're doing.

1257
01:03:59,251 --> 01:04:03,270
And so basically the world is divided
just like the dallas say into the

1258
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:08,010
orderly domain and the chaotic domain.
And you need to know how to operate in

1259
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:12,060
both and you need to balance them and
you need to transform one into the

1260
01:04:12,061 --> 01:04:13,740
other.
And that's basically what you're doing

1261
01:04:13,741 --> 01:04:15,270
when you're interacting with reality.

1262
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:18,660
And you know,
one of the things that I would,

1263
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,770
I will claim,
and this will become more important as

1264
01:04:22,771 --> 01:04:25,320
the course progresses,
is that when you're doing something

1265
01:04:25,321 --> 01:04:28,260
meaningful,
you're doing that property.

1266
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:33,650
And the sense of meaning that you have
is actually an indication that your

1267
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:38,460
psychophysiology is manifesting,
that you're in the right place at the

1268
01:04:38,461 --> 01:04:41,670
right time doing the right thing.
And it's real.

1269
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,270
It's not only real,
it's like it's the most real thing.

1270
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:51,080
It's where potential is transformed into
reality and it's hard to get any more

1271
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:54,690
real than that.
So that's partly why I'm telling you

1272
01:04:54,691 --> 01:04:56,730
that these things aren't exactly
metaphors.

1273
01:04:57,270 --> 01:05:00,480
You know,
they have to be represented by metaphor

1274
01:05:00,481 --> 01:05:03,690
in some sense.
But the reality of this underlying them

1275
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:06,090
isn't,
it's not just a story.

1276
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:08,760
Even though it is a story,
it's not just a story.

1277
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:11,670
It's a real representation of reality.

1278
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:16,020
So you know,
the other thing I kind of outlined here

1279
01:05:16,021 --> 01:05:19,930
is that when you hit an the,
normally it's sort of the anomaly is the

1280
01:05:19,931 --> 01:05:22,360
thing from which everything shines
forth.

1281
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,180
You know,
when it's still really anomalous,

1282
01:05:25,181 --> 01:05:28,420
what happens is it,
it manifests itself to you in sort of

1283
01:05:28,421 --> 01:05:32,500
like a burst of contradictory meanings.
And that can be paralyzing.

1284
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:34,420
You know,
you can be really,

1285
01:05:34,421 --> 01:05:35,830
really,
really excited and reading,

1286
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:36,281
reading,
reading,

1287
01:05:36,281 --> 01:05:37,660
nervous,
which might happen.

1288
01:05:37,661 --> 01:05:40,180
For example,
if you were going to a job interview and

1289
01:05:40,181 --> 01:05:44,140
you actually wanted the job,
it would be even worse if you went to a

1290
01:05:44,141 --> 01:05:49,141
job interview and like 30% of you wanted
the job because you know that's the 30%

1291
01:05:49,481 --> 01:05:52,900
that wants to develop and now they're
30% would just soon fail so that you

1292
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,110
crawl under your bed at home and stay
there with the dust bunnies til you're

1293
01:05:56,111 --> 01:06:00,640
40 and you know another 25% of you is
resentful about the fact that you got to

1294
01:06:00,641 --> 01:06:02,530
have to go get a stupid job at all.

1295
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,990
And so then you go in there and it's
really,

1296
01:06:04,991 --> 01:06:09,220
really complicated because not only is
that all that potential there,

1297
01:06:09,221 --> 01:06:13,930
but your fractured and those fractures
make the whole situation way more

1298
01:06:13,931 --> 01:06:16,900
complicated and unstable than it would
otherwise have to be.

1299
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:20,320
So,
and that happens to people all the time,

1300
01:06:20,321 --> 01:06:22,510
you know,
I mean people hedge their bets in job

1301
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:24,340
interviews all the time cause they
think,

1302
01:06:24,370 --> 01:06:25,870
eh,
I don't really care.

1303
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:26,561
It's like,
no,

1304
01:06:26,561 --> 01:06:30,340
you care.
You just want to have a story to tell

1305
01:06:30,341 --> 01:06:33,520
yourself.
If you fail while and then if you have

1306
01:06:33,521 --> 01:06:35,350
that story,
well then probably you're going to fail

1307
01:06:35,351 --> 01:06:40,351
because you don't get to do that.
You can't go in there at 60% and hope to

1308
01:06:40,391 --> 01:06:42,610
win.
You have to go in there at 100% now

1309
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:46,150
that's cool too,
because what it implies is just what the

1310
01:06:46,151 --> 01:06:51,151
clinical psychologist have been telling
people for 60 years or 70 years,

1311
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:52,180
right?

1312
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:55,570
You have to voluntarily face the things
that you're afraid of.

1313
01:06:55,930 --> 01:06:57,550
Now,
it's a little more complicated than that

1314
01:06:57,551 --> 01:06:59,380
because otherwise you could just go play
in traffic,

1315
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:00,911
you know,
so it's,

1316
01:07:00,911 --> 01:07:05,440
it's not a call to stupid adventure.
What it does is assume that you've gone

1317
01:07:05,441 --> 01:07:08,200
a direction and that the direction is it
valid direction,

1318
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:11,410
and then that what happens is as you
pursue that,

1319
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,750
obstacles emerge,
anomalous,

1320
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:18,700
threatening obstacles,
and then you either confront them or you

1321
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,640
abandon the whole project,
while generally speaking,

1322
01:07:21,641 --> 01:07:25,990
if you chop them into little pieces,
then you can confront them and digest

1323
01:07:25,991 --> 01:07:28,570
them,
and then you get stronger because you're

1324
01:07:28,571 --> 01:07:30,670
doing all this digesting.
It's like you're eating,

1325
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:36,090
you're eating the monster of chaos.
And that's a classic metaphor for,

1326
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:40,000
for developing wisdom to ingest piaget
than uses that,

1327
01:07:40,001 --> 01:07:40,930
right?
Assimilate.

1328
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:45,370
It's exactly the same idea as ingesting
instead of what you're eating is

1329
01:07:45,371 --> 01:07:46,900
information instead of matter.

1330
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:48,460
And so,
you know,

1331
01:07:48,461 --> 01:07:52,930
and the information restructures you,
it makes you more informed and that puts

1332
01:07:52,931 --> 01:07:55,240
you more information.
So,

1333
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:56,841
so you know,
you,

1334
01:07:56,841 --> 01:08:00,670
you encounter the anomaly and it's a
burst of contradictory potential.

1335
01:08:00,671 --> 01:08:02,590
And so that's exactly how you respond to
it.

1336
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:06,340
Your body's going everywhere at once
because God only knows what's going to

1337
01:08:06,341 --> 01:08:08,580
happen.
And then as you interact with it,

1338
01:08:08,581 --> 01:08:10,630
it collapses.
You're collapsing it.

1339
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:14,050
That's what happens when you take
control of the situation and then you

1340
01:08:14,051 --> 01:08:18,710
reduce it to a single path where
everything's going properly.

1341
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:20,120
And you might say,
well,

1342
01:08:20,121 --> 01:08:23,030
you're bending it to your own selfish
wills,

1343
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:25,580
but that's not right.
Because if you're in,

1344
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,430
let's say you're in an interview and
there's five or six people in there,

1345
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:32,660
you can't just bend the damn thing to
your will because you have to interact

1346
01:08:32,661 --> 01:08:35,570
with those people.
And so if you don't do that with,

1347
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:38,000
you know,
you can be a psychopath and manipulate,

1348
01:08:38,001 --> 01:08:39,920
but that will only work for a short
period of time.

1349
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:42,740
You'll get caught and then you'll have
to move because that's what psychopaths

1350
01:08:42,741 --> 01:08:44,300
do.
But if you're,

1351
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:46,340
that's how they keep being psychopaths.
You know,

1352
01:08:46,341 --> 01:08:50,540
they exhaust everyone's trust and then
they have to move and then they go find

1353
01:08:50,541 --> 01:08:55,010
some other people who are trustworthy
because they built up trust capital with

1354
01:08:55,011 --> 01:08:57,230
other people and then they betrayed
them,

1355
01:08:57,231 --> 01:08:59,750
but they have to keep moving.
So it's an unstable solution.

1356
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:03,110
So you go in there and you do it
properly.

1357
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,360
Well,
what are you doing exactly?

1358
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:08,750
No,
I would say that if you're really,

1359
01:09:08,751 --> 01:09:11,510
really nailing that interview,
you're saying,

1360
01:09:11,511 --> 01:09:12,260
well,
here's a,

1361
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:16,160
here's a future that we could all march
together into consonantly and happily

1362
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:20,000
that's what you're saying.
And I'm the person to do that.

1363
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:22,430
Now you might be saying that on a
relatively low scale,

1364
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:26,510
like if I'm your assistant,
you're never going to have to worry

1365
01:09:26,511 --> 01:09:28,880
about me because I'm always going to be
there,

1366
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:29,660
you know?

1367
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:32,420
And then if maybe you're the CEO,
you're going to say,

1368
01:09:32,421 --> 01:09:33,320
well,
you know,

1369
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:36,590
this is,
this is the way that all of us are going

1370
01:09:36,591 --> 01:09:38,210
and here's why,
and this is what it's going to look

1371
01:09:38,211 --> 01:09:40,190
like.
And the better you are at that,

1372
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:46,910
the more that potential will turn into
it multiplies.

1373
01:09:46,911 --> 01:09:48,920
That's what happens if you're good at
dealing with it,

1374
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:51,710
the potential that's accessible to you
multiply.

1375
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:55,340
So,
which is really cool.

1376
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,850
And also how you'd hope it would be
cause you don't,

1377
01:09:58,851 --> 01:10:01,790
you hope that more potential would
manifest itself to people who are more

1378
01:10:01,791 --> 01:10:04,400
competent.
Things worked well.

1379
01:10:04,401 --> 01:10:07,610
That would be good.
So,

1380
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:13,630
so that's the spirit matter idea.
And so that's represented in that

1381
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:20,930
drag it.
So let's go back to him.

1382
01:10:32,590 --> 01:10:33,880
No.
Okay.

1383
01:10:33,881 --> 01:10:37,420
So are you remember this character here?
So what to do about that?

1384
01:10:37,421 --> 01:10:41,140
What to do about chaos?
Well,

1385
01:10:41,141 --> 01:10:44,920
one thing you might want to start by
doing is admitting that it exists.

1386
01:10:46,270 --> 01:10:49,040
You know?
So let's say that you're,

1387
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:52,900
you're not a terror management advocate.
Let's say you're an advocate of positive

1388
01:10:52,901 --> 01:10:55,870
illusions.
Does everybody know what those are?

1389
01:10:56,770 --> 01:10:59,470
Just do you or are you still taught
about those in social psychology?

1390
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:01,270
Positive illusions?
Yes.

1391
01:11:01,810 --> 01:11:04,330
No.
How many people know about them?

1392
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,650
Okay.
Where did you learn about them?

1393
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:10,150
Your class.
Okay.

1394
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:14,880
Sexy 30 in two 30 yeah.
No one else has taught you about this.

1395
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:17,400
Anybody else learned it to anywhere
else?

1396
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:19,740
You learned it online.
Okay,

1397
01:11:19,741 --> 01:11:21,960
well thank God for that.
Well,

1398
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:25,650
what happened was the paper where
positive illusions were first pouted and

1399
01:11:25,651 --> 01:11:28,470
that was in social psychology.
So it was in the Journal of Personality

1400
01:11:28,471 --> 01:11:29,280
and social psychology.

1401
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:33,240
That was the most cited,
the most cited paper ever in social

1402
01:11:33,241 --> 01:11:35,250
psychology.
It's up there.

1403
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:36,121
Yeah.
Yeah.

1404
01:11:36,121 --> 01:11:39,120
And it's an appalling paper because it
basically says,

1405
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:42,240
it says something like this,
if you scrape away all the nonsense,

1406
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:45,360
things are so horrible that if you just
looked at them,

1407
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:48,780
you'll be so depressed.
You want to die so you better not you

1408
01:11:48,781 --> 01:11:51,810
better.
We've around yourself an illusion that

1409
01:11:51,811 --> 01:11:55,190
things are better than they are and that
you're more powerful and wonderful venue

1410
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:59,010
actually are.
And if you do that but not too much,

1411
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,950
then you're going to be happier.
Well,

1412
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:04,680
you know,
the error is in that are just manifolds

1413
01:12:04,681 --> 01:12:05,370
first.
Like,

1414
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:07,800
well who cares if you're happy,
what the hell does that have to do with

1415
01:12:07,801 --> 01:12:08,634
anything?
You know,

1416
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,770
it could be happy stepping on ats,
you know,

1417
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:15,090
so well really it's like what the hell
stupid ideas that you've got.

1418
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:17,790
Positive emotion,
Caucasian cocaine will do that.

1419
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,740
You know,
bullies are pretty happy when they're

1420
01:12:19,741 --> 01:12:22,470
pounding out someone like mill house,
you know,

1421
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:25,170
so happiness is,
what the hell is that?

1422
01:12:25,171 --> 01:12:27,120
It's shallow.
It's a dopey idea.

1423
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:28,860
So,
and then,

1424
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:30,540
and then,
well,

1425
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:33,720
how big should these lies that you're
telling yourself be?

1426
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:36,750
And answer that as well.
Just exactly the size that will make you

1427
01:12:36,751 --> 01:12:38,940
happy.
Well that's not helpful because if

1428
01:12:38,941 --> 01:12:41,850
you're going to have a theory,
let's hear about exactly how big they

1429
01:12:41,851 --> 01:12:42,690
should be.
Well,

1430
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:45,810
sometimes they should be this big and
then other times they shouldn't be this

1431
01:12:45,811 --> 01:12:47,880
big,
but there's no real way of telling a

1432
01:12:47,881 --> 01:12:50,670
priority while.
So that's not really very helpful

1433
01:12:50,671 --> 01:12:52,080
either.
So,

1434
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:55,800
and then there's another id underneath
that that's even worse,

1435
01:12:55,801 --> 01:12:59,060
which is reality is so awful that you
can't look at it.

1436
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:02,490
Well that's,
that's nasty man.

1437
01:13:02,491 --> 01:13:03,650
Because that means,
and that,

1438
01:13:03,651 --> 01:13:05,220
and that is what the pause to pollution
stuff,

1439
01:13:05,221 --> 01:13:07,080
man.
Sort of like the terror management

1440
01:13:07,081 --> 01:13:10,170
theories.
If you got an unvarnished look at

1441
01:13:10,171 --> 01:13:13,920
reality,
it would just destroy it because you're,

1442
01:13:13,950 --> 01:13:17,880
you're not strong enough to look at
reality in an unvarnished manner.

1443
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:20,383
Well,

1444
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:24,370
you can imagine why people would believe
that.

1445
01:13:24,371 --> 01:13:25,150
I mean you,
you could,

1446
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:26,560
you could thank God.
Yes.

1447
01:13:26,561 --> 01:13:27,500
I mean,
you know,

1448
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,850
it's pretty damn awful,
but then you think,

1449
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,110
well,
wait a minute,

1450
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:39,740
is it read the case that everyone who's
out there coping with the world is like

1451
01:13:39,741 --> 01:13:43,430
blind and diluted?
Or maybe is it that the people who are

1452
01:13:43,431 --> 01:13:45,980
not coping with the world very well or
blind and diluted,

1453
01:13:46,370 --> 01:13:48,830
I mean,
ask yourself that you see people in your

1454
01:13:48,831 --> 01:13:50,600
life that you know,
you admire.

1455
01:13:50,601 --> 01:13:54,200
I presume as certainly you've seen
people you don't admire.

1456
01:13:54,810 --> 01:13:57,830
Well also like let's take the ones you
don't admire.

1457
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,080
Well,
how bout blind in diluted?

1458
01:14:00,081 --> 01:14:03,440
Does that partially described them?
It would be blind,

1459
01:14:03,441 --> 01:14:04,310
diluted,
bitter,

1460
01:14:04,311 --> 01:14:07,400
resentful at mean that sort of covers
the territory.

1461
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:09,710
So,
and then the people you admire?

1462
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:13,240
Well,
they're strong people.

1463
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:15,130
Generally.
They can do things that are really

1464
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:18,550
ridiculously difficult,
like have a baby and raise it without

1465
01:14:18,551 --> 01:14:19,570
destroying it,
you know,

1466
01:14:19,571 --> 01:14:24,130
or work in a palliative care board or be
a nurse in a cancer ward for children or

1467
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,233
you know,
or,

1468
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:27,310
I mean there's a lot of awful things.

1469
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:31,420
I talked to this guy the other day,
I just met him sort of randomly and he

1470
01:14:31,421 --> 01:14:34,090
had had a motorcycle accident that was a
bad one.

1471
01:14:34,091 --> 01:14:37,800
He rolled like 200 feet at 60 miles an
hour when he broke seven ribs and you

1472
01:14:37,801 --> 01:14:40,360
know,
had a brain hemorrhage and like it

1473
01:14:40,361 --> 01:14:42,880
really took it out to them.
And he was a good athlete before that.

1474
01:14:42,881 --> 01:14:45,010
And so it probably aged him 20 years,
you know,

1475
01:14:45,011 --> 01:14:49,570
and he's still recovering.
And he was telling me he works for a

1476
01:14:49,571 --> 01:14:52,060
power company,
so he's climbing up these power poles,

1477
01:14:52,061 --> 01:14:53,500
you know,
because that's part of his job.

1478
01:14:53,501 --> 01:14:57,010
Well now he's pretty screwed up.
He's in his mid fifties he's still

1479
01:14:57,011 --> 01:15:00,520
climbing up power poles and he was
working with a guy who had Parkinson's

1480
01:15:00,521 --> 01:15:03,190
disease.
And so the guy with the Parkinson's

1481
01:15:03,191 --> 01:15:05,980
disease is at the top of the power pole
doing his job,

1482
01:15:05,981 --> 01:15:06,940
but he's getting shaky.

1483
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:08,860
So they're afraid things are going to
fall.

1484
01:15:08,861 --> 01:15:10,630
And then this guy comes up behind him to
help him.

1485
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:14,470
He's only really got one arm that works.
It's like Jesus,

1486
01:15:14,471 --> 01:15:16,810
that's tough.
Those people are tough,

1487
01:15:16,811 --> 01:15:18,010
man.
You know,

1488
01:15:18,011 --> 01:15:21,520
because Parkinson's,
that sucks and well,

1489
01:15:21,521 --> 01:15:25,220
so just having half your arm more or
less destroyed by a motorcycle acts and

1490
01:15:25,221 --> 01:15:27,460
not staying at home,
hiding under the bed,

1491
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:30,370
you know,
they're out there still making sure the

1492
01:15:30,371 --> 01:15:34,030
lights are on.
Well that's a pretty ardent unvarnished

1493
01:15:34,031 --> 01:15:36,370
confrontation with reality as far as I'm
concerned.

1494
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:38,560
You know?
So I couldn't say.

1495
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:41,020
All right.
So here's another story.

1496
01:15:41,410 --> 01:15:46,410
So
I probably told you a little bit about

1497
01:15:46,811 --> 01:15:51,811
this before,
when the behaviorist first proposed that

1498
01:15:52,501 --> 01:15:57,501
you could use exposure to treat anxiety.
The psychoanalysts were all skeptical

1499
01:15:58,141 --> 01:16:01,080
about that because they thought while
you're just treating the symptom,

1500
01:16:01,470 --> 01:16:04,860
they usually thought of a full bi as the
manifestation,

1501
01:16:04,861 --> 01:16:08,970
the visible manifestation of something
that was more that learn more deeply

1502
01:16:08,971 --> 01:16:12,530
underground and there's real truth and
not like,

1503
01:16:13,470 --> 01:16:14,050
okay,

1504
01:16:14,050 --> 01:16:18,220
whatever a mouse is to someone who's
mouse phobic isn't what MLC is.

1505
01:16:18,221 --> 01:16:21,790
Cue the mouse is a bunch of other things
because otherwise they wouldn't be

1506
01:16:21,791 --> 01:16:23,680
afraid of it.
And so all those,

1507
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:27,310
you could say the mouse is an exemplar
of the category of all things that

1508
01:16:27,311 --> 01:16:30,130
they're afraid of.
And that's a good way of thinking what

1509
01:16:30,131 --> 01:16:33,910
it might mean symbolically.
And so I had one client who was afraid

1510
01:16:33,911 --> 01:16:37,450
of mice and she thought one would run up
her leg and she was also afraid of being

1511
01:16:37,451 --> 01:16:38,980
raped.
And those two things were,

1512
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:43,150
there was a,
a metaphorical union between them,

1513
01:16:43,330 --> 01:16:44,830
even though they weren't,
you know,

1514
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:48,010
are obviously not exactly the same.
So the psychoanalysts,

1515
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:49,450
they're making their point,
you know,

1516
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:53,770
but it turned out that it now,
so the original behavior theory was you

1517
01:16:53,771 --> 01:16:55,870
can't be anxious and calm at the same
time.

1518
01:16:56,890 --> 01:16:59,230
So what you do first,
if you're going to teach someone not to

1519
01:16:59,231 --> 01:17:01,690
be afraid of a mouse,
is teach them how not to be afraid.

1520
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:05,890
So you put them in the chair and you do
a relaxation exercise with them and then

1521
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:08,560
you show them a picture of a mouse and
you say,

1522
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:09,680
just breathe.
You know,

1523
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:11,150
calm down.
And so they all,

1524
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:14,540
they calm down and then sooner or later
they can look at the pictures of mice by

1525
01:17:14,541 --> 01:17:17,090
themselves.
And then maybe you could throw a like

1526
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:19,370
stuffed mouse them and then maybe,
you know,

1527
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:22,520
they could walk by a pet store and look
at her house and so on and so forth

1528
01:17:22,521 --> 01:17:25,670
until you get them like holding rats.
And so,

1529
01:17:26,090 --> 01:17:27,710
you know,
that works works,

1530
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:30,080
but it works even if you don't relax
them.

1531
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:32,210
Fact,
it works just as well.

1532
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:36,950
So the oil behavioral idea that was
countered conditioning was wrong.

1533
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:40,340
Just like the idea that the reason you
were afraid of a rat was because of

1534
01:17:40,341 --> 01:17:41,300
conditioning.
It's like,

1535
01:17:41,410 --> 01:17:42,650
of course you're afraid of a rat.

1536
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:44,600
It's a rat.
You know?

1537
01:17:44,601 --> 01:17:47,150
It's just like you're afraid of snakes,
you know,

1538
01:17:48,950 --> 01:17:52,460
to a lesser or greater degree in people
actually become more afraid of stakes as

1539
01:17:52,461 --> 01:17:54,020
they get older.
Interestingly enough,

1540
01:17:54,021 --> 01:17:56,000
which is not what you really expect,
right?

1541
01:17:56,001 --> 01:18:00,110
Unless it was a biological function.
So anyways,

1542
01:18:00,111 --> 01:18:04,220
all you have to show people the thing
they're afraid of and what did they

1543
01:18:04,221 --> 01:18:06,950
learn?
They don't learn that the thing isn't

1544
01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:09,410
frightening.
They learn that they're tough.

1545
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:13,100
And so one of the things,
and that's why generalize it.

1546
01:18:13,101 --> 01:18:16,820
So which is the behavior.
See No psychoanalysts predicted what

1547
01:18:16,821 --> 01:18:18,020
would happen is as well,
you know?

1548
01:18:18,021 --> 01:18:18,471
Yeah,
yeah.

1549
01:18:18,471 --> 01:18:20,540
You're not afraid of a mouse anymore,
but like you're,

1550
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:24,440
you're twice as afraid of being raped in
your cabin when you're up there alone.

1551
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:25,543
It's like,
no,

1552
01:18:25,790 --> 01:18:28,160
that isn't what happens.
You're not afraid of the mouse anymore

1553
01:18:28,161 --> 01:18:31,040
and your half is afraid of being alone
up in your cabinet.

1554
01:18:31,550 --> 01:18:34,400
It generalizes.
And so if you take someone who's

1555
01:18:34,401 --> 01:18:37,280
agoraphobic and in their mid forties and
somewhat dependent,

1556
01:18:37,550 --> 01:18:39,050
and you treat them for their
agoraphobic,

1557
01:18:39,051 --> 01:18:40,910
and then they'll go home and give their
husband tail,

1558
01:18:41,030 --> 01:18:43,730
cause they're usually women and tell
them all the things that they'd been

1559
01:18:43,731 --> 01:18:46,310
wanting to tell him for 20 years.
But it'd be too afraid to because they

1560
01:18:46,311 --> 01:18:48,500
thought he might leave.
And then they were afraid that,

1561
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,810
you know,
he'd leave and they fall apart and all

1562
01:18:50,811 --> 01:18:53,660
of that.
So they get you teach them that they

1563
01:18:53,661 --> 01:18:56,150
don't have to run out of the subway and
all of a sudden they get more

1564
01:18:56,151 --> 01:18:58,400
confrontation.
And the reason for that is because they

1565
01:18:58,401 --> 01:19:02,390
get more courageous.
And the reason for that is they go do

1566
01:19:02,391 --> 01:19:05,060
something difficult and they watch
themselves and hey,

1567
01:19:05,061 --> 01:19:07,640
they could do it.
And so one of the things you might ask

1568
01:19:07,641 --> 01:19:12,380
about yourself is how do you know what
you have to run away from?

1569
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:14,800
You know,
you might be so damn tough,

1570
01:19:14,810 --> 01:19:16,850
you just can't bloody well imagine it
and you're just,

1571
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:19,760
you know,
you just sort of a sheltered,

1572
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:21,980
you know.
Now look,

1573
01:19:21,981 --> 01:19:24,350
you're a lot less sheltered than you
were when you were three,

1574
01:19:24,440 --> 01:19:26,870
I presume.
How many of you live on your own?

1575
01:19:28,250 --> 01:19:30,890
Okay,
now that was a transition,

1576
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:32,540
I presume.
How many of you were depressed and

1577
01:19:32,541 --> 01:19:34,160
anxious their first year of university?

1578
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:37,260
Okay,
how many of you work?

1579
01:19:38,290 --> 01:19:39,050
Yeah.

1580
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:40,850
Okay,
so it's about 50% well,

1581
01:19:40,851 --> 01:19:43,580
that's about right.
Both the third of first year u of t

1582
01:19:43,581 --> 01:19:46,490
students meet clinical criteria for
depression according to the Beck

1583
01:19:46,491 --> 01:19:47,900
depression inventory.
Well,

1584
01:19:47,901 --> 01:19:48,740
why?
Well,

1585
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:50,450
it's hard.
You know,

1586
01:19:50,690 --> 01:19:52,880
you leave your family,
you're kind of protected there.

1587
01:19:52,881 --> 01:19:54,860
You go out,
you have to figure out all the things

1588
01:19:54,861 --> 01:19:57,710
you have to do to keep yourself alive.
And then you have to go to university

1589
01:19:57,711 --> 01:19:59,930
and they're going to give you an
impossible amount of work that no one

1590
01:19:59,931 --> 01:20:03,320
could ever possibly master.
So it's daunting.

1591
01:20:03,321 --> 01:20:06,380
And then you're surrounded by people who
are smarter than the people you're used

1592
01:20:06,381 --> 01:20:08,550
to being surrounded by.
So that means you're not as smart as you

1593
01:20:08,551 --> 01:20:10,500
thought you were.
And you meet people now,

1594
01:20:10,501 --> 01:20:13,680
men who are way smarter than you,
and way harder working and way better

1595
01:20:13,681 --> 01:20:14,860
looking.
And all of those phases.

1596
01:20:14,861 --> 01:20:15,830
So,
you know,

1597
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:16,501
it's,
it's,

1598
01:20:16,501 --> 01:20:19,590
it's depressing,
but by the same token,

1599
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:24,690
how many of you feel less armed to take
on the world then you get five years

1600
01:20:24,691 --> 01:20:25,524
ago?

1601
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:28,830
You're not gonna admit it probably.
But I presume that that's a very small

1602
01:20:28,831 --> 01:20:30,870
number.
How many of you feel more prepared?

1603
01:20:32,490 --> 01:20:33,151
Okay.
Okay.

1604
01:20:33,151 --> 01:20:35,670
So that's pretty cool.
So what that means is that you went out

1605
01:20:35,671 --> 01:20:39,780
there and get a whole bunch of difficult
things and some of those things you've

1606
01:20:39,810 --> 01:20:41,270
been reading each other's
autobiographies,

1607
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:45,420
right?
How's that going to be an interesting,

1608
01:20:45,950 --> 01:20:47,310
yeah.
Is it worthwhile?

1609
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:50,640
Anybody think it isn't worthwhile?
I really want to know,

1610
01:20:50,641 --> 01:20:52,220
you know,
because you know what's,

1611
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:55,020
it's kind of an experiment,
some sense to see how this was working,

1612
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:56,190
what's good about it

1613
01:20:58,850 --> 01:21:00,750
so you can get to know.

1614
01:21:03,290 --> 01:21:04,370
So why do you like that?

1615
01:21:05,410 --> 01:21:07,220
Cause it makes the class feel more like,

1616
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:10,611
yeah,
you know,

1617
01:21:10,611 --> 01:21:12,260
I'm,
I'm thinking about working with the

1618
01:21:12,261 --> 01:21:15,160
company and the Edmonton is setting that
up as a,

1619
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:19,730
we increase increasing trust among
people who work together with the same

1620
01:21:19,731 --> 01:21:21,380
company.
They're not going to be sharing your

1621
01:21:21,381 --> 01:21:24,350
deepest secrets.
But what they will be doing is having

1622
01:21:24,351 --> 01:21:27,560
structured conversations where they find
out a little bit about each other.

1623
01:21:28,070 --> 01:21:29,030
You know,
when it sort of,

1624
01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:32,060
it seems like have a relationship with
someone,

1625
01:21:32,061 --> 01:21:34,610
you'd kind of have to get to know their
hierarchical structure.

1626
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:35,750
Right.
And if it's just the,

1627
01:21:35,810 --> 01:21:39,620
like the sh the tiniest things,
well that person sits at the desk and

1628
01:21:39,621 --> 01:21:42,530
types,
well it's a shallow relationship.

1629
01:21:43,010 --> 01:21:45,740
If it's a deep relationship,
you know much more about the whole

1630
01:21:45,741 --> 01:21:46,550
structure.
Right.

1631
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:50,240
Which I think is why the,
the metaphor of depth works so well,

1632
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:51,381
you know?
Okay.

1633
01:21:51,381 --> 01:21:54,050
So,
so you found that it like catalyze the

1634
01:21:54,051 --> 01:21:55,250
classroom a little bit more,

1635
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:56,760
sorry.
Yeah.

1636
01:21:57,070 --> 01:21:59,480
And like,
isn't it like you fall in love with them

1637
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:01,370
when they're applying for,

1638
01:22:07,030 --> 01:22:09,090
yeah.
So that's an interesting thing to a

1639
01:22:09,100 --> 01:22:11,090
about the whole vulnerability issue.
Yeah.

1640
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:12,633
Yeah.
It's like

1641
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:16,330
if you're forming a relationship with
someone,

1642
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:20,660
what you do is you basically mutually
open up your shells and you know what's,

1643
01:22:20,710 --> 01:22:24,680
or you kind of go like this,
you know?

1644
01:22:24,681 --> 01:22:26,380
And if you could ask to close
permanently,

1645
01:22:26,381 --> 01:22:28,060
well then you go.
But yeah.

1646
01:22:28,061 --> 01:22:29,830
So that's another thing that's
interesting too,

1647
01:22:29,831 --> 01:22:32,050
because one of the prizes that unless
you,

1648
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:35,260
you know,
voluntarily expose your vulnerabilities,

1649
01:22:35,261 --> 01:22:39,040
you'll never find partner or they won't
be a real partner cause they don't know

1650
01:22:39,041 --> 01:22:42,250
who the hell you are and then you're
weak because there's only one of you,

1651
01:22:42,510 --> 01:22:43,480
you know,
so.

1652
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:45,060
Yep.
Yep.

1653
01:22:48,170 --> 01:22:49,400
Yeah.
So why'd you like that?

1654
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:54,480
Because I can share it,
like making decisions but not feel like

1655
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:55,403
anyone really,

1656
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:59,850
you know,
there's some evidence that people like

1657
01:22:59,851 --> 01:23:03,540
computer guided psychotherapy for
exactly that reason.

1658
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:06,580
It's like you can be completely honest
with the computer cause like it doesn't

1659
01:23:06,581 --> 01:23:07,720
care.
Not yet.

1660
01:23:07,870 --> 01:23:08,860
It's will soon,
but,

1661
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:13,060
but you probably won't judge you any
more harshly than you said it too.

1662
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:18,300
It's like love and affection today.
Well that won't be very far away.

1663
01:23:20,381 --> 01:23:22,120
Okay.
So what are other people have to say

1664
01:23:22,121 --> 01:23:23,590
about the autobiography?
Yeah,

1665
01:23:23,870 --> 01:23:28,870
I find really interesting because like I
never sold dp on that person as be

1666
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:33,830
stokes share.
Then as we get has to be taught what

1667
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:36,920
weight thinking beginning of their
childhood up to this point.

1668
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:38,990
You never really had that conversation.

1669
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:41,430
Hmm.
Hmm.

1670
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:42,600
Hmm.

1671
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,100
So you liked that too?
Yeah.

1672
01:23:44,101 --> 01:23:46,860
Like why,
why,

1673
01:23:46,930 --> 01:23:48,300
what was good about it for you?

1674
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:49,410
Thank you.
See,

1675
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:52,760
you get to see usually as,
even if you're like say just like you

1676
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:56,000
want to reach out to your agent and
every student like holistically,

1677
01:23:56,690 --> 01:23:59,070
but watching them grow,
it's Kinda like,

1678
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:03,880
it's Kinda very strange because we don't
think about people in that.

1679
01:24:04,170 --> 01:24:06,050
Right.
Well you're seeing more of this say.

1680
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:06,960
Yeah.
You know,

1681
01:24:06,961 --> 01:24:11,040
because the person actually extends
across time and you're right.

1682
01:24:11,041 --> 01:24:14,190
All you see as a slice,
well they're not a slice at the whole

1683
01:24:14,191 --> 01:24:16,560
damn thing and this thing that grows
across time.

1684
01:24:17,070 --> 01:24:17,761
Yeah.
So,

1685
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:18,594
okay.
Who,

1686
01:24:18,610 --> 01:24:20,490
who else has something to say?
That's interesting.

1687
01:24:21,470 --> 01:24:25,890
Ha.
Half the people don't want to talk now.

1688
01:24:26,190 --> 01:24:27,540
So anybody else?

1689
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:29,220
Okay.

1690
01:24:29,220 --> 01:24:31,860
After doing that and writing so many
things about myself,

1691
01:24:31,861 --> 01:24:33,900
I actually,
I was talking about the assignment to a

1692
01:24:33,901 --> 01:24:38,670
couple of friends and it really thought
I'd actually be okay if the people who

1693
01:24:38,671 --> 01:24:42,580
read my assignment,
like identified who I was and like even

1694
01:24:42,581 --> 01:24:47,581
like engage in conversation with me.
And it really kind of inspired me to be

1695
01:24:48,751 --> 01:24:52,380
more honest about sharing myself.
Like do my existing relationships.

1696
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:55,920
Huh.
So why did you conclude that it would be

1697
01:24:55,921 --> 01:24:57,490
okay if someone identified you?

1698
01:24:58,940 --> 01:25:03,830
Because I felt a desire to be seen more
and it was kind of,

1699
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:09,350
I felt more with myself when I was
disclosing more information about

1700
01:25:09,351 --> 01:25:12,650
myself.
And so it made me want to be more with

1701
01:25:12,651 --> 01:25:15,370
myself in my existing kitchen shit.

1702
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:17,360
Okay.
Back to what is a very good observation.

1703
01:25:17,361 --> 01:25:20,390
So I'm going to say a couple of things
about that and you tell me if you think

1704
01:25:20,391 --> 01:25:22,010
they're accurate.
Okay.

1705
01:25:22,011 --> 01:25:23,210
So the first thing is,

1706
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:24,720
yeah,

1707
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:28,110
it's an act of courage to expose
yourself to someone.

1708
01:25:28,111 --> 01:25:29,760
No,
we're not going to say that precisely.

1709
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:34,000
It's an active car.
It's an act of courage too,

1710
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:38,850
to be truthful with someone because
they're actually interacting with the

1711
01:25:38,851 --> 01:25:42,480
actual you.
So there's no facade.

1712
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:44,070
Okay.
So that's one thing.

1713
01:25:44,071 --> 01:25:46,620
So you get more courageous.
But then the next thing might be,

1714
01:25:50,090 --> 01:25:53,540
I would say that you have a more
sympathetic relationship with yourself.

1715
01:25:54,220 --> 01:25:54,951
Yeah.
You know,

1716
01:25:54,951 --> 01:25:58,010
because let's say you have this stupid
memory about some dumb you did when you

1717
01:25:58,011 --> 01:26:00,380
were 13 and you're still carrying that
along.

1718
01:26:00,381 --> 01:26:01,670
It's like Jesus,
you know,

1719
01:26:01,730 --> 01:26:02,960
you were 13,
what the hell?

1720
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:05,540
You expect 15 year olds,
they're just dumb as sticks.

1721
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:07,340
They're going to do all sorts of stupid
things.

1722
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:11,030
They're brains are all addled from
hormones and they're trapped in those

1723
01:26:11,031 --> 01:26:15,530
little educational prisons and you know,
so they're going to do stupid things.

1724
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:18,380
But if you're carrying that,
it's like it's you that did that.

1725
01:26:19,130 --> 01:26:21,990
It's not some stupid 13 year old that
you once word.

1726
01:26:21,991 --> 01:26:26,000
So then you can start to see yourself in
perspective.

1727
01:26:26,001 --> 01:26:28,760
You know,
as a 13 year old like other 13 year

1728
01:26:28,761 --> 01:26:29,594
olds,
you know,

1729
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:33,270
no better but perhaps no worse.
So you can get on your,

1730
01:26:33,470 --> 01:26:37,880
you can get on your side in some sense
by walking through your story and seeing

1731
01:26:37,881 --> 01:26:40,520
what the causal elements are.
Does that seem reasonable?

1732
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,050
Okay.
Okay.

1733
01:26:42,051 --> 01:26:42,441
Yeah.
Well,

1734
01:26:42,441 --> 01:26:44,640
so that's a good thing.
That's a good thing.

1735
01:26:45,390 --> 01:26:45,920
I think.

1736
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:47,690
Um,
I really liked it again,

1737
01:26:47,691 --> 01:26:49,880
because you really get to know other
people and that's,

1738
01:26:49,970 --> 01:26:50,803
that's,
um,

1739
01:26:51,890 --> 01:26:54,530
I really liked that aspect of it.
I think it was also interesting that I

1740
01:26:54,531 --> 01:26:59,531
think other people
not necessarily knew more about you than

1741
01:27:00,861 --> 01:27:02,620
you did,
but they can talk a little bit

1742
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:04,930
information that you gave them.
The,

1743
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:06,200
I know,
I know,

1744
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:08,460
um,
someone looked at something that I'd

1745
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,070
written a completely different light
than I did.

1746
01:27:10,071 --> 01:27:13,400
I thought that was so interesting.
And just like the idea of looking at it,

1747
01:27:13,401 --> 01:27:16,790
I guess a little bit more from the
outside and getting a different

1748
01:27:16,791 --> 01:27:17,350
perspective.

1749
01:27:17,350 --> 01:27:22,350
Well that's what's the famous poem about
the best gift we could possibly be given

1750
01:27:23,581 --> 01:27:27,280
us to see ourselves as others see us.
I think it's Robbie Burns and I just

1751
01:27:27,281 --> 01:27:30,090
mangled the hell out of them.
But that's basically what it meant.

1752
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:32,060
And Yeah,
you do get that opportunity and,

1753
01:27:32,061 --> 01:27:34,600
okay.
And it's weird and this is something the

1754
01:27:34,601 --> 01:27:36,580
positive illusion people never think
about either,

1755
01:27:36,581 --> 01:27:40,240
is that sometimes people think they're
better than they are,

1756
01:27:40,660 --> 01:27:44,170
like objectively whatever that means.
But lots of times the opposite is true

1757
01:27:44,171 --> 01:27:46,570
or not.
And I think often it's true even more

1758
01:27:46,571 --> 01:27:49,050
often it's like people think they're a
lot worse than they are.

1759
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:52,390
No one's as anxious as me or as
concerned about acts or,

1760
01:27:52,570 --> 01:27:54,040
you know,
was confused about this,

1761
01:27:54,041 --> 01:27:54,791
or,
you know,

1762
01:27:54,791 --> 01:27:57,270
as socially awkward or is not funny,
or,

1763
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,410
you know,
everybody's got their paranoia about

1764
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:03,190
this part of the niche,
the worst that anyone could possibly be

1765
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:05,620
in the entire world.
And it's almost never,

1766
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,550
almost never true.
You know,

1767
01:28:08,590 --> 01:28:11,200
other people are a lot more like that,
then you think,

1768
01:28:11,350 --> 01:28:14,260
and they're running around trying to
hide it madly as well,

1769
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,690
so,
so that's a good thing.

1770
01:28:16,691 --> 01:28:17,471
Well,
you know,

1771
01:28:17,471 --> 01:28:19,210
you also allow your,
in some sense,

1772
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:20,980
you're allowing yourself out into the
light.

1773
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:22,360
You go through your life and you think,
well,

1774
01:28:22,361 --> 01:28:23,230
I can allow other people.
