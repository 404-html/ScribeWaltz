1
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,220
I didn't.
Paul Kennedy,

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,990
this is ideas,
war and violence have always been with

3
00:00:07,991 --> 00:00:10,810
us.
The first murder took place between the

4
00:00:10,811 --> 00:00:12,580
first humans,
Cain and Abel,

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:17,710
in that legacy of destroying ourselves
and each other has come down to us from

6
00:00:17,711 --> 00:00:21,370
the very beginning.
The creation story reminds us as much

7
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:25,300
about our tragic weakness as it does
about our infinite potential.

8
00:00:25,301 --> 00:00:29,680
As humans,
Che loss is transformed into order by

9
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:33,340
the word and you are all speakers of the
word,

10
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,820
and if you want chaos to be transformed
into hell,

11
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:40,570
then lie.
If you want chaos to be transformed into

12
00:00:40,571 --> 00:00:45,571
heaven and tell the truth,
it's easy to look at violence and war as

13
00:00:45,761 --> 00:00:49,570
anomalies of human nature,
but there's clearly something else going

14
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:52,570
on.
What's the meaning of the Columbine and

15
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:56,500
Sandy Hook school massacres,
the bus bombings in Jerusalem,

16
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:01,480
the Charlie Hebdo killings?
Sometimes we think politics can explain

17
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:06,481
these things or a kind of madness,
but what else might be behind such

18
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:11,701
senseless acts acts that achieve no goal
except the universal sadness of what the

19
00:01:11,831 --> 00:01:14,680
human condition you can sweep underneath
your bed.

20
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,260
You don't have to go out and wave a
placard around.

21
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,450
I'm against poverty.
It's like,

22
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,910
who's for poverty?
I think you want to fix the world 65.

23
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,560
It's a lot harder than you think,
right?

24
00:01:26,561 --> 00:01:29,170
It says in the New Testament,
it's harder to rule yourself than to

25
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:31,500
rule the city,
but why?

26
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,050
Well,
it turns out you're more complicated

27
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,410
than a city.
It also turns out that you're more

28
00:01:35,411 --> 00:01:37,330
important in some sense,
the city,

29
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,340
Jordan Peterson is a professor of
psychology at the University of Toronto

30
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,210
and a clinical psychologist at the
Stratford Festival.

31
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:50,530
He explored some of these questions and
in today's program we'll hear the talk

32
00:01:50,531 --> 00:01:53,620
he gave and the conversation I had with
him afterwards.

33
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,750
Here's a history of violence.

34
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,080
If you do a genuine psychological
analysis of the human thirst for war,

35
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:14,450
you can't entertain a more brutal topic,
and part of the reason that people don't

36
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:19,320
understand it is because you really
don't want to understand it.

37
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,430
So despite that,
I'm going to use a case history today.

38
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:32,190
Fundamentally,
to illustrate the state of mind that you

39
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:37,191
have to occupy in order to be willing
and ready to commit any atrocity that

40
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:47,400
might be demanded of you under any
circumstances whatsoever.

41
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,240
The best way to think about the human
thirst for war,

42
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,530
at least at the level of analysis that
I'm capable of,

43
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:02,350
is to think about it as a personality.
Lots of the states of mind that

44
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:06,160
possesses us can be reasonably thought
of as a personality,

45
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,490
so if you're angry,
for example,

46
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,220
you can think of yourself as possessed
by aries or Mars' who's the god of war,

47
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,210
or if you're hopelessly in love with
making a fool of yourself,

48
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:22,300
well then you're possessed by arrows,
sir cupid or Venus,

49
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:28,210
and that really is how archaic people
pre scientific people viewed the

50
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:34,540
proclivity of people to occupy states of
mind that were quite different than

51
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:37,390
those that were characteristic of their
normal personality.

52
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:43,060
Freud really capitalized on that idea
and modernized it in some sense because

53
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:47,230
Freud viewed the human being,
as in some sense,

54
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:50,710
a loosely united collection of
subpersonalities.

55
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,230
We don't tend to conceptualize states of
mind anymore

56
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,260
as personalities,
not in the scientific literature,

57
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:07,090
but we do all the time in literature and
drama and movies

58
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,500
and that sort of representation is
extraordinarily compelling,

59
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,520
weirdly enough,
you'll pay to watch it and it is very

60
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:19,690
strange if you think about it,
because if the specter of pure

61
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:23,380
destructiveness is laid out in front of
you on a stage,

62
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,250
there is no logical reason to assume
that you would voluntarily expose

63
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:30,100
yourself to that,
to that and pay for the privilege of

64
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:35,020
doing so,
but you do and the reason for that.

65
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:40,830
One of the reasons for that is that you
need to know what that personality is,

66
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,840
partly so you can recognize elements of
it if they manifest themselves in front

67
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:51,841
of you or within you and partly because
you really can't understand good

68
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:00,370
until you understand evil,
and so if you're ever wondering why

69
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,330
white good itself seems to be such a
limited resource.

70
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:10,590
It's worthwhile remembering that you
don't get there without going somewhere.

71
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:14,740
You don't want to go first,
and so that's where we're going to go

72
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:19,630
today.
I'm going to start with a shakespearian

73
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:24,040
quote seems appropriate from Titus
Andronicus,

74
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:28,720
which is a very violent play.
It play that's essentially about

75
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:33,490
vengeance and one of Shakespeare's
characters says,

76
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,710
why should wrath be mute and fury dumb?
I am no baby.

77
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,820
I that with base prayers.
I should repent the evils.

78
00:05:42,821 --> 00:05:47,440
I have done 10,000 worst that ever,
yet I did.

79
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,800
Would I perform if I might have my will,
if one good deed in all my life I did.

80
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:59,700
I do repent it from my very soul.
It's not the sort of thing that you want

81
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:01,190
to hear someone say to you.

82
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,770
We look for reasons why people might be
motivated to commit atrocious acts and

83
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,160
given our cultural standpoint at
present,

84
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:21,410
we're often looking for sociological
reasons.

85
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,300
Poverty,
which does not read violence by the way,

86
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,310
relative poverty which does lack of
education.

87
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:35,660
Ignorance.
We very seldom consider intent or

88
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:40,661
voluntary intent because the idea is
that people could voluntarily and

89
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:46,160
consciously intend.
Destructiveness is a very frightening

90
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:50,120
thought,
especially when you realize that if

91
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:53,930
people could do that to the degree that
you're a person,

92
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,620
you could also do that and understanding
that people could do that and that you

93
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:04,880
could means that you might be morally
obliged

94
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,120
to undertake a very thorough examination
of the motives for your own behavior.

95
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,020
The personality that I want to talk to
talk about today,

96
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:21,490
it's composed of a downward spiral and I
think that's why people,

97
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:26,150
people have always envisioned hail in
some sense as a bottomless pit of hell

98
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:28,550
is a bottomless pit because no matter
how bad it is,

99
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,640
there's some stupid thing you can do to
make it worse and so the spiraling is

100
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:38,510
indicative of a positive feedback loop
where a causes B and b causes c and then

101
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:41,360
c causes a and everything moves out of
control.

102
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:47,380
The case study that I want to present to
you today is one of the more literate of

103
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:53,390
the columbine killers whose name was
Eric Harris.

104
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,180
People wonder why the mass shooters do
what they do,

105
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,800
which in some sense it's quite
surprising to me because if you read

106
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:08,180
what they say,
they tell you why they do what they do.

107
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:12,410
Now,
why people don't believe that is not

108
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:16,460
clear to me,
except that I think that if you do take

109
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:21,110
them at their word,
raises all sorts of specters that we

110
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:26,111
would rather have hidden.
Eric Harris became possessed,

111
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:30,980
I would say,
of just own free choice by a personality

112
00:08:30,981 --> 00:08:33,680
that was composed of ideological
rigidity,

113
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,070
pride,
resentment,

114
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,750
deception,
and vengefulness.

115
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,180
I'm going to read you some of his
comments about government systems.

116
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,200
Here's Harris's comments with regards to
ideological rigidity like the early Nazi

117
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:55,410
government.
My brain is like a sponge,

118
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:59,490
sucking up everything that sounds cool
and leaving out all that is worthless.

119
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,380
That's how nazi-ism was formed and
that's how I will be to Hitler and his

120
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:07,230
head.
Boys messed up a few times and it costs

121
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,540
him the war,
but I love their beliefs and who they

122
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,130
were,
what they did and what they wanted.

123
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,680
I love the Nazis too,
by the way.

124
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:16,890
I can't get enough of the swastika,
the SS and the Iron Cross.

125
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,890
It's not that he didn't understand the
Nazis.

126
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,930
He understood them perfectly well.
Whatever else you might say about Eric

127
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:25,763
Harris,
he wasn't stupid.

128
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:31,320
Pride people,
parents,

129
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,810
cops,
God teachers telling me what to do.

130
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,621
Think,
say,

131
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:38,460
act and everything else just makes me
not want to do it.

132
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,940
That's why my nickname is rebel.
Rab Actually no one is worthy of

133
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:47,070
anything unless I say they are.
I feel like God,

134
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:52,290
I wish I was having everyone being
officially lower than me already know

135
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,410
that I'm higher than almost anyone in
the world in terms of universal

136
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:58,560
intelligence.
I feel ever more confident,

137
00:09:58,561 --> 00:10:02,010
stronger and more godlike,
and I have confidence in my ability to

138
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:06,450
see people.
I have thought too much,

139
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,460
relies too much,
found out too much,

140
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,990
and I'm too self aware to just stop what
I am thinking and go back to society

141
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,110
because what I do and think isn't right
or morally accepted.

142
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,490
No,
no,

143
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,110
no.
I would sooner die than betrayed my own

144
00:10:22,111 --> 00:10:25,860
thoughts before I leave this worthless
place.

145
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,940
I will kill whoever I deemed unfit for
anything at all.

146
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,060
This is from paradise.
Lost

147
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,370
the great poem by John Milton.

148
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,990
These are the words that he puts into
the mouth of Satan after he's flung from

149
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:47,640
heaven,
for daring to oppose and attempt to

150
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:52,641
transcend the most high as his desire
was not only to be light God,

151
00:10:52,891 --> 00:10:57,891
but to be superior to God and in some
sense he's assembled in some very

152
00:10:58,051 --> 00:11:00,510
important sense.
He's a symbol or a representation you

153
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:05,511
could say which is more accurate of the
ultimate intellectual pride which says

154
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:10,740
everything I know is sufficient and
there's nothing transcendent beyond

155
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:15,390
that.
Milton has Satan say farewell,

156
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:20,160
happy fields where joy forever dwells.
Hail horrors,

157
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:24,180
hail infernal world,
and Thou profoundest.

158
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:26,490
Hail received the I knew possessor,

159
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,960
one who brings a mind not to be changed
by place or time

160
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,820
resentment.
I've noticed in my clinical practice

161
00:11:38,821 --> 00:11:43,821
that there are two,
three character logical elements that

162
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,620
really do people in and weirdly enough,
they're not really listed in the

163
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:56,770
psychiatric list of diagnosis and
they're often also not discussed as

164
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:00,130
causal elements in the genesis of mental
illness and suffering.

165
00:12:00,131 --> 00:12:03,820
Even though in my experience,
they're actually the primary causes

166
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,630
arrogance,
which is I already know enough

167
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,340
deceit,
which is I can twist the fabric of

168
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:17,341
reality in my favor for my individual
wants and I can get away with it,

169
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,750
which goes along with pride and
arrogance and then resentment,

170
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,700
which is the world is tragic,
which is of course true.

171
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:33,130
The world is unjust and tragic,
which is more debatable and the

172
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:38,131
injustice and tragedy of the world is
aimed at me specifically and unfairly.

173
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,570
Well,
that's just not true at all.

174
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,010
Resentment.
I hate you people for leaving me out of

175
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:47,530
so many fun things and no,
don't say,

176
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:51,010
well,
that's your fault because if it isn't

177
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,920
you.
People had my phone number and I asked

178
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:54,581
and all,
but no,

179
00:12:54,581 --> 00:12:55,414
no,
no.

180
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,090
Don't let the weird looking.
Eric kid come along.

181
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,990
Oh No,
you people could have shown more

182
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:03,250
respect,
treated me better,

183
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:08,230
asked for my knowledge or guidance more.
Treated me more like a senior and maybe

184
00:13:08,231 --> 00:13:11,620
I wouldn't have been as ready to carry
your heads off.

185
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,540
Milton again,
Paradise Lost Has Satan say.

186
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,840
The more I see pleasures about me,
so much more,

187
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:24,400
I feel torment within me as from the
hateful siege of contraries.

188
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,770
All good to me becomes Bain and in
heaven,

189
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,010
much worse would be my state,
but neither here seek.

190
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:37,840
I Know Norton Heaven to dwell and less
by mastering is heaven supreme,

191
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:43,650
nor hope to be myself.
Less miserable by what I seek,

192
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,950
but others to make such as I though
thereby worse to me.

193
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:52,870
Redound for only in destroying do I find
ease to my relentless thoughts.

194
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,340
Eric Harris again.
Then again,

195
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,760
I have always hated how I looked.
I make fun of people who look like me

196
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:04,240
sometimes without even thinking
sometimes just because I want to rip on

197
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:07,090
myself.
That's where a lot of hate grows from.

198
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,010
This is Richard three from Shakespeare.
Richard,

199
00:14:12,011 --> 00:14:15,310
the third eye shall despair.
There is no creature,

200
00:14:15,311 --> 00:14:17,290
loves me,
and if I die,

201
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,650
no soul will pity me.
Name,

202
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:24,040
wherefore should they?
Since that I myself find in myself,

203
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:28,300
no pity to myself.
Deception.

204
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:31,690
You know what I feel like telling about
lies.

205
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:36,160
I lie a lot,
almost constantly and to everybody just

206
00:14:36,161 --> 00:14:38,920
to keep my own ass out of the water and
by the way,

207
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:41,860
I don't think I'm doing this for
attention as some people may think.

208
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,330
Let's see,
what are some big lies I've told?

209
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,550
Yeah,
I stopped smoking.

210
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,040
Yeah.
I'm sorry for doing it.

211
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,190
Not for getting caught.

212
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,890
No,
I haven't been making more bombs.

213
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,500
No,
I wouldn't do that,

214
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:59,750
and of course countless other ones.
Yeah.

215
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:03,110
I know that I hate liars and I am one
myself.

216
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,060
Oh,
well it's okay if I'm a hypocrite,

217
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,870
but no one else because I'm higher than
you people.

218
00:15:08,871 --> 00:15:11,990
No matter what you say and if you
disagree,

219
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,970
I would shoot you.
If you take the personality elements

220
00:15:16,971 --> 00:15:20,210
that we've already discussed and you mix
them up and you let them run as a

221
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:23,960
process,
you get the positive feedback loop that

222
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:27,770
I was describing earlier and it goes
something like this and I learned this

223
00:15:27,771 --> 00:15:32,240
in part from the analysis of the story
of Cain and Abel in Genesis.

224
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:36,590
The first story about real human beings
is the story about Cain and Abel because

225
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:38,090
Adam and eve were made by God,
right?

226
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:41,060
So you know you can't really call them
normal humans.

227
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:46,060
Cain and Abel are the first humans and
Cain is very resentful and deceitful and

228
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,370
vengeful,
and the reason for that,

229
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,490
which it's clearly explained in the
story,

230
00:15:55,491 --> 00:15:59,330
is that cane sacrifices aren't accepted
by God.

231
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:04,700
Now it's hard for modern people to
understand what a sacrifice is because

232
00:16:04,701 --> 00:16:07,850
why?
Why would you offer up to God some

233
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:13,130
remnant of an animal for example,
but you know people along while back

234
00:16:13,131 --> 00:16:17,750
acted things out before they could
understand them and they had a more

235
00:16:17,751 --> 00:16:20,870
concrete view of the world.
I mean they assume God was in the cosmos

236
00:16:20,871 --> 00:16:23,660
because if you look up in the night sky,
especially if it's dark,

237
00:16:23,661 --> 00:16:26,360
it overwhelms you.
You see the transcendent and the

238
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:29,780
infinite,
and so it's the sensation and experience

239
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:34,781
of that that allows for the attributes
of God and his dwelling place to the

240
00:16:34,821 --> 00:16:36,830
heaven.
So that's not so ridiculous because you

241
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:40,220
do see the infinite when you're out
under this guy at night in the dark,

242
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,550
and if God's up there,
since smoke rises,

243
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,050
if you burn something,
well,

244
00:16:45,051 --> 00:16:48,410
God can tell if what you're offering is
of quality or not.

245
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,920
Now we have the psychological
equivalent,

246
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,560
which is,
I asked my students,

247
00:16:54,561 --> 00:16:58,760
what sacrifices did your parents make so
that you could go to university and of

248
00:16:58,761 --> 00:17:03,761
course they can answer that in no time
flat and whether that sacrifice work

249
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,590
depends on how well the child does at
university,

250
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,670
but what that essentially means is that
this sacrifice of the parents found

251
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:13,070
favor,
well with reality,

252
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:18,160
but you can substitute God for that with
no loss of meaning and so modern people

253
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,380
obviously believe that if you sacrifice
properly,

254
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,150
then reality will shine.
It's benevolent face on you.

255
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,320
Otherwise we wouldn't work,
so we're not so different from those

256
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:31,760
archaic people.
Now,

257
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:35,750
Cain make sacrifices and God doesn't
like them.

258
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:40,930
Now the story's a bit in bivalent about
why it might just be the gods arbitrary.

259
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:44,350
I mean it.
There's no shortage of arbitrary ness on

260
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,080
the part of God.

261
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,450
In the Old Testament,
which is part of the reason that people

262
00:17:47,451 --> 00:17:50,580
have modern people have with that book
because they say,

263
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:53,440
well,
I could never believe in a god who's

264
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:58,450
that arbitrary or even cruel,
but the ancient Israelites weren't that

265
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:02,160
foolish.
They knew that life could be that

266
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:04,350
arbitrary and cruel no matter what you
believe,

267
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,800
so they took me that God just has it in
for cane or it could be the cane is just

268
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:15,240
not really offering up the best quality
sacrifices and so he's trying to pull

269
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:17,970
one over on God and everyone else and in
fact,

270
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:22,890
that is what God accuses him up.
If you read the story very carefully,

271
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:28,410
Cain is mad because ables getting
everything and everyone loves able.

272
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:33,780
Lots of crops is flocks are flourishing.
All the girls love him.

273
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,530
Plus he's a really good guy so you can't
even hate him with good conscience,

274
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:40,320
which is extremely annoying,
especially to cane.

275
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,460
So king goes and has a chat with God and
he says,

276
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,740
what kind of stupid place if you made
here?

277
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,120
It means reality.
I'm like working myself to the bone and

278
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,560
you know,
all I get is the dregs and then there's

279
00:18:55,561 --> 00:18:59,580
old able out there and you know
everything he touches turns to gold.

280
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:03,600
What's up with you,
which is kind of arrogant if you think

281
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:04,111
about it,
right?

282
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:07,560
Because he is talking to God after all.
It isn't clear that cane understands

283
00:19:07,561 --> 00:19:11,970
everything about being and there's
always the possibility that it's keynes.

284
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,380
Fall,
could not gods,

285
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:18,381
but that isn't a hypothesis that Kayden
is willing to entertain.

286
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:24,710
So God says to him basically sin,
which means to miss the Bullseye by the

287
00:19:25,021 --> 00:19:28,970
way,
crouches at your doorstep like a

288
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,980
predatory and sexually aroused hunting
cat and you invited in and let it have

289
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:41,751
its way with you by which he means not
only is cain attacked by sin,

290
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:47,340
so to speak,
but it's a creative union sort of

291
00:19:47,341 --> 00:19:50,280
attack.
Sin Comes in and Caine plays with it,

292
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:52,760
develops it,
and puts his own twist on it,

293
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,570
produces something new out of it.

294
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:00,510
It's obvious decay and that God isn't
willing to take responsibility for the

295
00:20:00,511 --> 00:20:04,800
terrible state of being as a consequence
of this accusation and that makes them

296
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:07,740
extremely mad,
extremely mad,

297
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:13,070
and he kills Abel and then if you follow
the story closely,

298
00:20:13,261 --> 00:20:17,790
you can see that God tells everyone else
to leave cane alone,

299
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,601
don't,
don't kill him,

300
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:22,290
and the reason for that is that there's
a propensity for that kind of vengeful

301
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:25,650
killing to expand exponentially out into
the community,

302
00:20:25,651 --> 00:20:29,520
which in fact is what happens in the
story of Cain and Abel and the end,

303
00:20:29,521 --> 00:20:31,560
the,
the last one of canes,

304
00:20:31,561 --> 00:20:36,561
descendance named is actually to bull
cane and he is by tradition the first

305
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:41,970
person who makes weapons of war.
So the idea is that individual

306
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:47,030
resentment manifested as homicidal.
Rage is the precondition for the spread

307
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,630
of that mode of being into the broader
community and the danger there is that

308
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,770
will degenerate into

309
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,990
everyone against everyone.
Harris

310
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,170
moral is just another word and that's
it.

311
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,380
I think we are all a waste of natural
resources and should be killed off and

312
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,910
since humans have the ability to choose
and I'm human,

313
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,870
I think I will choose to kill and damage
as much as nature allows me,

314
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:17,280
so take that.
Eat Napalm and lead someone's bound to

315
00:21:17,281 --> 00:21:18,960
say,
what were they thinking when we go

316
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,810
natural born killers or when we're
planning it,

317
00:21:21,811 --> 00:21:25,980
so this is what I'm thinking.
I have a goal to destroy as much as

318
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,890
possible so I must not be sidetracked by
my feelings of sympathy,

319
00:21:28,891 --> 00:21:30,000
mercy,
or any of that.

320
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,820
Keep this in mind.
I want to burn the world

321
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:36,190
now.
Part of the reason that Cain killed Abel

322
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,900
because Abel is favored by God

323
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:44,480
and so Kane is actually not only taking
revenge against Abel and against his own

324
00:21:44,641 --> 00:21:49,620
insufficiency and to get suffering.
He's actually taking revenge against God

325
00:21:49,621 --> 00:21:53,460
and being itself,
and that's actually what he wants to do.

326
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:57,150
Hate.
I'm full of hate and I love it.

327
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:00,690
I want to grab some weak little freshmen
and tear them apart like a wolf.

328
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:03,030
Show them who's God,
strangled them,

329
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,670
squash their head,
bite their temples into the skull,

330
00:22:05,671 --> 00:22:08,140
rip off their jaw,
rip off their collarbones,

331
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,240
break their arms in half and twist them
around the lovely sounds of bones

332
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:16,530
cracking and flesh ripping so much to do
and so little chance.

333
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,380
God,
I want a torch and level everything in

334
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:22,170
this whole area,
but bonds of that size are hard to make

335
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,950
and plus I would need a fully loaded
eight,

336
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:27,660
10 to get every store on Wadsworth and
all the buildings downtown.

337
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:32,310
Picture half of Denver on fire just for
me and vodka.

338
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,940
Who was his partner?
Napalm on sides of skyscrapers and car

339
00:22:35,941 --> 00:22:38,310
garages blowing up from exploded gas
tanks.

340
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,990
Oh Man.
That would be beautiful.

341
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:44,250
Yes.
The human race is still indeed doomed.

342
00:22:44,251 --> 00:22:46,260
It just needs a few kickstarters like
me.

343
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,020
If I can tell you a few cities off the
map,

344
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:52,290
then great.
If you recall your history,

345
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:56,280
the Nazis came up with a final solution
to the Jewish problem.

346
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,060
Killed them all.
Well,

347
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:04,530
in case you haven't figured it out yet,
I say kill mankind.

348
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:09,740
No one should survive.
So I'll close this briefcase history

349
00:23:10,531 --> 00:23:15,531
with a quote from Georgia,
from Faust and faust.

350
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,900
The figure of Satan is played by
Mephistopheles and Memphis coffees in

351
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,770
girth.
This formulation is a very arrogant

352
00:23:28,771 --> 00:23:33,771
intellect and he has a credo which is
the articulated formulation of the

353
00:23:37,261 --> 00:23:42,261
values that he lives by
the spirit I that endlessly denies and

354
00:23:45,111 --> 00:23:47,840
rightly to,
for all that comes to birth,

355
00:23:47,841 --> 00:23:51,190
is fit for overthrow as nothing worth
wherefore.

356
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:56,220
The world were better sterilized.
That's all that's here is evil,

357
00:23:57,321 --> 00:24:02,321
recognized is gained to me and downfall,
rude and sin.

358
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:08,890
The very element type prosper in
so you can see in that the actuality,

359
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,370
the actuality is not only what Harris
wrote and meant,

360
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:19,540
but also what he did and what he was
planning to do,

361
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,660
which was much more destructive than
what he actually managed.

362
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:29,100
You see his state of possession by a set
of infinitely destructive desires and

363
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:35,500
wishes,
and you see the continual representation

364
00:24:35,501 --> 00:24:40,501
of that pattern of action and thought in
literature that's evil versus good.

365
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,440
Classically,
that's what the world is.

366
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,920
That's what the cosmos is.
It's a place where evil and good

367
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:54,921
continually battle eternally battle,
and although we don't believe in such

368
00:24:55,591 --> 00:24:59,520
things anymore or more accurately,
we don't know what we believe,

369
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:05,180
we still are inclined to watch that
drama present itself on stage in endless

370
00:25:06,301 --> 00:25:11,301
variations,
and the reason for that is that it's

371
00:25:12,831 --> 00:25:17,831
true.
You can't understand the human capacity

372
00:25:18,871 --> 00:25:23,871
and desire for atrocity without viewing
it through a metaphysical lens.

373
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:31,150
You can't understand someone like Eric
Harris or the countless others who are

374
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:32,870
possessed,
so to speak,

375
00:25:32,871 --> 00:25:37,871
in exactly the manner that he was
without using dramatic or religious

376
00:25:38,751 --> 00:25:43,751
language because you cannot formulate
either the question or the answer with

377
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:48,290
enough profundity without that kind of
representation.

378
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,940
Now,
I wouldn't say that the motives that

379
00:25:52,941 --> 00:25:57,770
I've discussed constitute the only
reasons for the human thirst for war,

380
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:02,420
but I can tell you that you'll never
understand the desire for atrocity

381
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,410
without coming to grips with the problem
of evil.

382
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,063
Thank you.

383
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:14,280
Thank you.

384
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,490
Your listening to ideas in Canada on CBC
radio,

385
00:26:20,491 --> 00:26:25,491
one on Sirius xm across North America
and around the world on CBC dot Ca.

386
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,840
I'm Paul Kennedy.
What is it that drives us to violence?

387
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:34,410
Murder and war,
these are some of the most puzzling

388
00:26:34,411 --> 00:26:38,730
corners of the human personality and
with the help of William Shakespeare and

389
00:26:38,731 --> 00:26:42,420
John Milton,
psychologist Jordan Peterson has been

390
00:26:42,421 --> 00:26:44,340
exploring mind of murder,

391
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,920
specifically the mind of columbine
killer,

392
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,780
Eric Harris.
This is a history of violence in time

393
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:55,890
now for my conversation with Jordan
Peterson and for some audience

394
00:26:55,891 --> 00:26:58,620
questions,
I want to begin,

395
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:03,710
I guess sort of where you began and I,
I'd never heard the words of Eric Harris

396
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:06,960
before and I have to tell you,
I found them chilling.

397
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:07,823
Lee,
frightening.

398
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,590
It was interesting though to then here
you quote and it had the,

399
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:14,190
the quotations so opposite and so
perfect.

400
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:18,660
Matching a quoting from Milton and
quoting from paradise lost,

401
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,840
I believe.
Um,

402
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:23,760
my undergraduate memory of studying that
masterpiece.

403
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,920
I'm,
is that,

404
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,350
and I think this is a school of critical
thought as well.

405
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:34,020
Milton apparently liked to Satan more
than he liked any of the other

406
00:27:34,021 --> 00:27:36,220
characters in that,
in that word,

407
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:39,810
the modern interpretation.
Why would that be modern and what do you

408
00:27:39,811 --> 00:27:40,420
mean by that?
Well,

409
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,253
because

410
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,960
Milton was a genius and the way he
represented Satan in paradise lost was

411
00:27:47,091 --> 00:27:52,091
as at a rebel and he didn't paint them
in black and white,

412
00:27:54,081 --> 00:27:56,420
so to speak.
He gave him all the attributes than an

413
00:27:56,421 --> 00:28:01,421
admirable rebel would have and people
enjoy identifying with the figure of the

414
00:28:02,571 --> 00:28:06,740
admirable rebel,
but what's what Satan was rebelling

415
00:28:06,741 --> 00:28:09,740
against,
wasn't what an admirable rebel would

416
00:28:09,741 --> 00:28:12,320
rebel against.
He wasn't rebelling the way Christ say.

417
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:17,330
Rick rebelled in his time against the
increasing tendency of the religious

418
00:28:18,171 --> 00:28:22,940
state to become dogmatic and tyrannical.
Satan was rebelling against the idea

419
00:28:22,941 --> 00:28:27,080
that there was something that exceeded
his power and that was transcendent.

420
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,940
Well,
human beings do that all the time,

421
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:32,810
especially modern human being.
So the idea that that Satan's and

422
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:36,440
admirable character I think can't be
placed at Milton Street.

423
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:40,340
He opened the door to that
interpretation and that's a good thing

424
00:28:40,341 --> 00:28:42,080
because part of,
for example,

425
00:28:42,081 --> 00:28:46,760
the reason that these modes of thinking
we're so powerful and compelling to

426
00:28:46,761 --> 00:28:48,510
Harris was that they,
I,

427
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:53,680
they allowed him the possibility of
construing himself as an admirable

428
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:57,680
rebel.
Even though what he was was

429
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:03,710
a momentary embodiment of the eternal
desire to obliterate everything,

430
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,820
and those are characters that exist to
Eric Harris,

431
00:29:07,821 --> 00:29:09,450
his little lone pair,
so he had to.

432
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,100
He had partners in Columbine.

433
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:16,340
He has admiral admires on the web of no
small number and not only does he exist

434
00:29:17,241 --> 00:29:19,670
out there,
he also exists in here,

435
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:24,470
like the thing that he represents,
the thing that he embodied is not.

436
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,900
It's a.
it's a permanent element of the human

437
00:29:26,901 --> 00:29:29,930
psyche.
It's in a radical,

438
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,240
it's eternal,
it's architectural,

439
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:36,200
it's structural.
So and why it's structural.

440
00:29:36,201 --> 00:29:38,300
It's Harris does a good job of
explaining.

441
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:44,530
Everyone knows that life is and everyone
knows that to exist is to suffer and one

442
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,840
logical and appropriate response to that
is to be grateful in spite of your

443
00:29:52,841 --> 00:29:56,980
suffering and attempt to make the best
of it and perhaps to alleviate that

444
00:29:56,981 --> 00:30:01,660
where you can and another is to take the
perspective of Mephistopheles and to say

445
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:02,561
no,
no.

446
00:30:02,561 --> 00:30:04,360
The whole thing is flawed right from the
beginning.

447
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:10,080
If this much suffering is the price of
being than we should just eradicate the

448
00:30:10,661 --> 00:30:15,661
whole mess and people think like that
all the time.

449
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:21,090
I'm curious,
you worked literally as an academic

450
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,570
professor of psychology.
You also have a practice here.

451
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:29,260
Do you have a clinical practice?
Is there any possible use for these

452
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:31,870
great icons,
sort of Western or eastern?

453
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:34,300
Any literature which all have in them,
as you say,

454
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:38,860
the sort of balance or,
or opposition of good and evil.

455
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,070
Um,
is there any possible clinical use for

456
00:30:42,071 --> 00:30:42,430
that?
Oh,

457
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:44,350
if you see people who are really in
trouble,

458
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:48,760
like really in trouble,
you can't address their problems without

459
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,090
using architectural language.
It's not possible.

460
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:55,990
So for example,
I had a client who lived in a web of

461
00:30:55,991 --> 00:31:00,991
lies that was pretty much infinite.
I tried for years to get to the bottom

462
00:31:01,121 --> 00:31:02,410
of it.
Familial lies.

463
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,870
The lie was we love you and we're
helping you.

464
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:09,390
When the truth was,
you should have been born a boy and

465
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,260
we've hated you ever since you were
born.

466
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,470
But we're not going to tell you that and
we're not gonna.

467
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,310
Let anyone else know that because we
need a facade of benevolence now and for

468
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:20,950
her,
this person to even begin to understand

469
00:31:20,951 --> 00:31:25,060
what was going on in her family.
There was no escaping archetipal

470
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:27,430
language.
I mean it was hellish.

471
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:30,820
People died in that house and I made
very little headway.

472
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,710
Every time I go to the bottom of some
absolutely horrendous betrayal,

473
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:41,820
betrayers we're in Dante's inferno.
They were right in the center of hell,

474
00:31:42,091 --> 00:31:44,390
right?
They were the worst of the criminals,

475
00:31:44,391 --> 00:31:47,710
so to speak.
I'd get to the bottom of some God awful

476
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:52,380
decades long,
brilliantly played betrayal,

477
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,490
and there'd be another one at the bottom
of that.

478
00:31:55,570 --> 00:32:00,570
I was wondering specifically whether
you'd actually used text in conversation

479
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:03,690
with patients.
So you would talk about foster,

480
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,190
you know,
lots of my patients have come from

481
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:07,390
religious backgrounds.

482
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:12,420
I mean one of them was a relatively
unsuccessful chaplain who was suddenly

483
00:32:14,411 --> 00:32:17,050
fired from her job and then was hit by a
car.

484
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:21,340
So that wasn't a good day.
I'm all in one day.

485
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,300
Yes,
yes.

486
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,170
And there was just,
there was no escaping the religious

487
00:32:26,171 --> 00:32:27,220
dimension.
I mean,

488
00:32:27,221 --> 00:32:29,800
the thing about religious,
the religious dimension sits at the

489
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:32,350
bottom of life.
Many people don't understand that.

490
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:35,110
They think it's a set of superstitions.
It's like it's not a set of

491
00:32:35,111 --> 00:32:37,030
superstitions,
or if it is,

492
00:32:37,031 --> 00:32:38,100
then you might ask yourself,
well,

493
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:42,770
why do you continue to go see it played
out time and time again on stage?

494
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,490
What are you just entertaining yourself?
It's like you're not.

495
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,070
Whether you know it or not,
you're educating yourself.

496
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:53,330
You're seeing near archetipal
representations of the structural

497
00:32:53,331 --> 00:32:58,331
elements of human behavior laid out for
you by geniuses dramatically and part of

498
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:04,160
the reason that you get the information
that way is that you're not smart enough

499
00:33:04,161 --> 00:33:08,870
to understand it abstractly and neither
is anyone else.

500
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:13,930
It's so complicated that even now all we
can really do is see it played out.

501
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:18,260
It's very difficult for us to transform
that into fully articulated philosophy.

502
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:23,830
Like it took me 15 years of work,
three hours a day to develop the ideas

503
00:33:23,871 --> 00:33:28,430
that and really like that was every day
I was thinking about this obsessively

504
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:33,910
for for decades and it took me that long
to reach the level of articulation where

505
00:33:36,111 --> 00:33:41,111
I could tell the story I told today it's
like it's complicated material and so

506
00:33:41,511 --> 00:33:45,080
it's also predicated on the idea which
which I believe to be true is that

507
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,920
reality itself is a forum for action.
It's not a place of objective things and

508
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,520
I believe that.
I also believe that if you're a true

509
00:33:55,521 --> 00:33:58,990
Darwinian,
you have to believe that because Darwin

510
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:03,410
believe that we are selected for
survival as a consequence of our

511
00:34:03,411 --> 00:34:06,230
actions,
and so our actions are what actually

512
00:34:06,231 --> 00:34:08,360
constitute the fundamental truth.

513
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,770
You live or die by your actions.
While actions have patterns,

514
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,990
we have character,
we have a nature.

515
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:18,560
That's why you can well,
that's why dramatic representations can

516
00:34:18,561 --> 00:34:23,150
be distributed worldwide and everyone
understands them and we understand them

517
00:34:23,151 --> 00:34:26,180
in some sense innately,
and we're drawn to them.

518
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:30,470
I Remember I showed Pinocchio to my son
when he was about four.

519
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:36,100
Pinocchio is a story about confronting
chaos and rescuing history in order to

520
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:41,660
become a genuine human being.
That's Pinocchio goes to the bottom of

521
00:34:41,661 --> 00:34:45,680
the ocean to confront chaos in the form
of a whale and he rescues his father and

522
00:34:45,681 --> 00:34:47,870
that makes him a fully developed human
being.

523
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:51,800
That's a story that the Egyptians tooled
for thousand years ago.

524
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:56,950
It's a very old story.
My son must've watched that 30 times.

525
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:59,630
You know,
he was really in some sense obsessed

526
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:00,350
with it.
Well,

527
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:03,500
not really.
Pinocchio has so much information and

528
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:06,330
you can barely begin to calculate it and
you know,

529
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:10,490
you could tell that by watching its
effect on someone whose mind was just

530
00:35:10,491 --> 00:35:13,220
starting to develop and he was terrified
of that whale,

531
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,050
but he wouldn't stop watching it.

532
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:16,850
You know,
we used to tell them,

533
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,390
keep your eye on the hero,
right?

534
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,260
Because,
you know,

535
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:23,240
should you show your children
frightening things?

536
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:28,870
Well the world is frightening.
You're going to shelter them from that.

537
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:32,510
Then all you do is launch them out into
the world like,

538
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:34,010
like edible.
Pray.

539
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,950
It's a bad idea.
So,

540
00:35:37,951 --> 00:35:40,860
you know,
you have to tell the children what to do

541
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:44,340
and that's to keep your eye on the hero
because despite the fact that it's

542
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:46,650
dangerous,
he prevails.

543
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,280
That's the story of humanity.
It's not while the heroes,

544
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,320
you know,
quivering at the back of the cave,

545
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,960
you know,
waiting for someone else to do the dirty

546
00:35:54,961 --> 00:35:59,640
work.
I guess I'm wondering how we might take

547
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:03,510
the archetypes you're talking about in
literature and theater in art and

548
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:05,290
creative world.
Um,

549
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:10,430
and somehow connect them with the other
kind of world we're watching all the

550
00:36:10,771 --> 00:36:12,000
time on television.

551
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,410
As you say,
we,

552
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:16,680
we are in a world where many of these
things are being acted out,

553
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,510
right?
Right before our eyes.

554
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:22,140
And it's horrifying to watch.
This is horrifying to watch television

555
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,340
for me these days anyway,
as it would be to read Eric Harris

556
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,740
journals and how can I connect what I
might learn if you,

557
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,140
if you.
I mean,

558
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:35,420
I tried to take apart the reasons for
atrocity in warfare particularly.

559
00:36:35,581 --> 00:36:38,910
I was trying to understand how the world
could have come to the point in about

560
00:36:38,911 --> 00:36:43,911
1984 where we were locked in mad mutual,
assured destruction mode.

561
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:50,430
How in the world is that the world that
we could have constituted the world so

562
00:36:50,431 --> 00:36:55,431
that we're aiming at each other's mutual
destruction with a weapon capacity that

563
00:36:57,961 --> 00:37:02,850
was exponentially beyond that.
It seemed like a mystery and I tried

564
00:37:02,851 --> 00:37:04,310
different levels of analysis,
you know,

565
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,480
because my first degree was political
science,

566
00:37:06,481 --> 00:37:11,481
so I tried political and economic and
sociological and until I got to the

567
00:37:12,211 --> 00:37:14,700
psychological and then to the
psychodynamic,

568
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,810
I didn't really have much luck because
you see what I was trying to understand.

569
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:22,680
For example,
it wasn't so much territorial war,

570
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,480
you know,
I can kinda understand.

571
00:37:24,481 --> 00:37:28,350
You have something I wanted so you know,
I'll push you out of the way animals do

572
00:37:28,351 --> 00:37:29,940
that.
I mean it's not,

573
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,530
it's by no means,
right?

574
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,010
But it's understandable.
But there are,

575
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:39,510
there are endless stories say about
occurrences in the 20th century,

576
00:37:39,511 --> 00:37:43,050
some of them that you can't even read
without developing posttraumatic stress

577
00:37:43,051 --> 00:37:48,051
disorder of gratuitous violence.
So one example,

578
00:37:48,691 --> 00:37:52,760
it's always haunted me.
It's an example from Auschwitz was that

579
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,780
game that the guards used to play.
There were,

580
00:37:54,781 --> 00:37:57,540
you know,
that the people that were being

581
00:37:57,541 --> 00:38:01,980
incarcerated would arrive at the camps
and of course they're already terrorized

582
00:38:01,981 --> 00:38:06,981
and half dead or completely dead and
ripped out of their lives and thrown in

583
00:38:08,341 --> 00:38:12,720
with people they don't understand and
whose language they don't speak and

584
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:17,220
demolished in multiple ways and you
know,

585
00:38:17,221 --> 00:38:22,221
they'd have them carry wet socks of salt
on their backs from one side of the

586
00:38:23,461 --> 00:38:27,990
compound to the other and back.
It's like,

587
00:38:27,991 --> 00:38:30,420
okay,
just exactly.

588
00:38:30,421 --> 00:38:33,150
Why do you want to do that?
Well,

589
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:37,500
that's a messy question,
you know,

590
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:40,910
when I don't think you can understand it
until you understand,

591
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:43,360
understand the part of you that could do
that.

592
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,420
And one of the horrifying things about
this line of investigation is that

593
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,820
that part exists.
And you could understand that,

594
00:38:52,821 --> 00:38:55,250
but you probably won't.
And it's no bloody wonder.

595
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:01,540
So
when I started the psychological

596
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:04,860
investigation,
I read a lot of mythology,

597
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:08,810
lot of work on comparative religion and
see the,

598
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,400
the religious stories are the
fundamental narratives.

599
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,480
You know,
they sort of,

600
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:17,660
if you think of behavior or,
or drama as having a grammar,

601
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:25,190
the grammar of behavior and drama is
religious and the reason it's really

602
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:29,400
it's religious because it's the grammar.
You know what,

603
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:32,120
you can't go any deeper than that.
That's how things are.

604
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:37,120
Like the human being,
the archetypical human being is a hero,

605
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:41,750
voluntarily confronting the unknown.
That's what we are and if we're not that

606
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:44,390
we're something else and that is not a
good thing.

607
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,890
It's also something that you know,
and I think this is what's really

608
00:39:47,891 --> 00:39:50,950
interesting about what you're saying.
I would would say,

609
00:39:50,951 --> 00:39:55,120
and I may be mischaracterizing
civilization or 20th and 21st century

610
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,830
political reality,
but many people I think given the fact

611
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:02,710
when you say it's a fact,
and I think it is grounded in something

612
00:40:02,711 --> 00:40:06,400
really archetipal and perhaps religious
really basic DNA,

613
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:11,260
there's evil and there's good.
Most people would want to say,

614
00:40:11,261 --> 00:40:12,910
okay,
let's work on getting rid of evil.

615
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,210
And I think you,
I think you were saying no,

616
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,860
that's not what you have to do.
Oh No,

617
00:40:18,861 --> 00:40:21,920
I think that is what you have to do,
but you don't do it by getting rid of

618
00:40:21,921 --> 00:40:24,140
other people's evil.
You get,

619
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:27,170
you do it by getting rid of your own.
Like I can tell you an experiment.

620
00:40:27,171 --> 00:40:29,030
You can try.
This is a great experiment.

621
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:32,720
Try not to say anything that isn't true
for a month.

622
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,521
You know when you say,
well,

623
00:40:34,521 --> 00:40:36,170
what about white lies?
It's like,

624
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:37,610
well,
you know,

625
00:40:37,611 --> 00:40:39,710
that's your problem.
You see if you can figure out how to.

626
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,060
So you know,
he might say,

627
00:40:41,061 --> 00:40:43,340
your wife says,
how do I look in this dress?

628
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,710
And you know,
you don't think she looks very good and

629
00:40:45,711 --> 00:40:47,300
so you say,
well you look great honey,

630
00:40:47,301 --> 00:40:49,730
and that's real good,
but that isn't the right answer.

631
00:40:49,731 --> 00:40:53,420
The right answer is something like,
don't ask me manipulative questions.

632
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:59,150
I know that's a little book.
It's a little harsh and I wouldn't

633
00:40:59,151 --> 00:41:01,190
actually formulated that way.
I would say,

634
00:41:01,191 --> 00:41:01,740
well,
you know,

635
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:04,070
I don't answer questions like that or
something like that.

636
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,530
So the truth wouldn't be that,
you know,

637
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:09,140
you look hideous in that dress and only
a moron would wear it.

638
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:11,420
That's,
that's not the truth.

639
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,500
The truth is more sophisticated than
that and you know,

640
00:41:15,501 --> 00:41:18,890
people are telling lies all the time to
spare other people's feelings and they

641
00:41:18,891 --> 00:41:22,730
have all sorts of good reasons for it.
It's like there are no good reasons for

642
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:26,900
lying.
You pollute your speech by lying,

643
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:30,800
and one of the most fundamental
presuppositions of western culture,

644
00:41:30,801 --> 00:41:34,340
and this is I think,
the most perhaps the most brilliant

645
00:41:34,341 --> 00:41:39,341
discovery human beings ever made,
is that chaos is transformed into order

646
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:45,310
by the word
and you are all speakers of the word,

647
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:49,190
and if you want chaos to be transformed
into hell,

648
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,360
then lie.

649
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:53,450
If you want chaos to be transformed into
heaven,

650
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:57,440
then tell the truth.
Fighting evil does matter,

651
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:02,570
but it's not corporations.
Some of them are evil,

652
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,550
obviously.
Some of them aren't.

653
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,070
You know,
it's not corporations,

654
00:42:07,071 --> 00:42:09,620
it's not sociopolitical structure.
It's none of those things.

655
00:42:09,621 --> 00:42:14,621
It's like fix up your speech,
fix up your family,

656
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,100
and then if you could manage that,
which is very difficult,

657
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:24,101
then maybe you could dare to start
thinking about something more complex

658
00:42:24,171 --> 00:42:26,660
than the family level of organization.
You know,

659
00:42:26,661 --> 00:42:29,840
I see students all the time,
whose lives are there are God awful

660
00:42:29,841 --> 00:42:31,940
mess,
you know when they're out protesting

661
00:42:31,941 --> 00:42:33,770
about something that's destroying the
world,

662
00:42:33,771 --> 00:42:34,910
it's like,
well,

663
00:42:34,911 --> 00:42:39,911
if we put you in charge,
well you have to decide what you're up

664
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:44,990
to
and you're either trying to make things

665
00:42:44,991 --> 00:42:47,270
better or worse.
That's it.

666
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,750
Those are the options and if you're
trying to make them worse,

667
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:53,180
there's reason and if you're trying to
make them better,

668
00:42:53,181 --> 00:42:58,181
there's a reason and so in some sense
you decide which side you're on and then

669
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:02,090
then you decide how much you're on that
side,

670
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:07,880
and a huge part of being on that side is
truth.

671
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,750
It's the fundamental virtue.
Without truth,

672
00:43:11,751 --> 00:43:14,180
you don't know where you are.
You don't know what you're doing,

673
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:17,570
you don't know who you are,
and the only reason you think you can

674
00:43:17,571 --> 00:43:19,520
get away with anything is pride.
It's like,

675
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:23,300
you know,
I'm smart enough to twist the fabric of

676
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:25,210
reality in my favor.
It's like crack.

677
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,110
Okay,
go ahead.

678
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:30,140
See what happens.
It's like the outcome will not be

679
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:32,450
pretty.
Even if you get what you want doing

680
00:43:32,451 --> 00:43:34,910
that,
you'll find out that it doesn't do for

681
00:43:34,911 --> 00:43:38,720
you what you thought it would.
So you know it's a fool's victory.

682
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:45,380
First question from the audience,
do people tend to take from plays views

683
00:43:45,381 --> 00:43:48,980
that reinforce their own position even
when the play expresses a country?

684
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:49,581
Oh,
that's a good.

685
00:43:49,581 --> 00:43:53,250
That's a really good question.
Art and literature truly subversive in

686
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:54,143
in the,
in,

687
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:56,450
you know,
because first of all,

688
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:59,930
if it's art,
it's not propaganda because if it's

689
00:43:59,931 --> 00:44:04,850
propaganda then that's a conscious
attempt to change the way you think or

690
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:05,090
look.

691
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:07,910
But if it's art,
then what's happening is the artist is

692
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,620
trying to figure something out.
Well,

693
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:14,650
he or she is engaged in the act of
artistic production and then the art

694
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:21,490
object is the result of that exploratory
attempt and the thing about exploring

695
00:44:22,461 --> 00:44:26,030
with art is you're always exploring
things that you don't know because

696
00:44:26,031 --> 00:44:29,930
otherwise why would you be exploring?
And so part of the reason that art is

697
00:44:29,931 --> 00:44:34,931
subversive is because it exists on the
border between articulated knowledge and

698
00:44:35,311 --> 00:44:38,250
the unknown itself.
Like it's the place where articulated

699
00:44:38,251 --> 00:44:42,780
knowledge is born and it's very
difficult to criticize art,

700
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,330
right?
I mean you can say,

701
00:44:45,331 --> 00:44:46,860
well,
one paintings better than another,

702
00:44:46,861 --> 00:44:51,861
but like what I mean by that is even
nihilistic punk rockers like music write

703
00:44:52,831 --> 00:44:56,340
music seeps in.
It's like music helps them celebrate

704
00:44:56,341 --> 00:45:00,120
life to the degree that nihilistic punk
rockers are capable of doing that and

705
00:45:00,121 --> 00:45:02,550
they will criticize the music.

706
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,740
Like maybe they don't like the lyrics or
whatever,

707
00:45:04,741 --> 00:45:08,790
but you're just an idiot if you
criticize music as a phenomenal logical

708
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:13,080
entity,
like dance is the same way these things

709
00:45:13,081 --> 00:45:15,330
are.
In some sense they're beyond criticism

710
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,980
because you actually don't know what
they're about.

711
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:20,820
So Yeah,
art is really subversive or

712
00:45:20,821 --> 00:45:22,480
transformative,
you know?

713
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:27,680
But that's the same thing.
This is a question that brings us right

714
00:45:28,171 --> 00:45:32,340
up to the prison peer.
Suppose what should be done in Gaza?

715
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,360
How do we look at that currently
properly?

716
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:40,620
I don't have an answer for that.
I don't think there's anything I can do

717
00:45:40,621 --> 00:45:45,621
about Gasa or alternatively I'm doing
everything I can about gas or by talking

718
00:45:45,811 --> 00:45:50,420
to you here today.
And my conclusion was,

719
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,060
as I mentioned before,
when I was trying to figure out what

720
00:45:54,061 --> 00:45:58,830
level of analysis was appropriate to
conceptualize the greatest of moral

721
00:45:58,831 --> 00:46:00,770
problem,
so Gaza situations,

722
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:04,950
a good example of that,
I always ended up at the individual

723
00:46:04,951 --> 00:46:05,340
level.

724
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:09,510
So I would say if you want to help the
situation in Gaza,

725
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:13,380
be more truthful with your spouse and
you would think,

726
00:46:13,381 --> 00:46:14,910
well,
how can that be connected?

727
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,220
But I can tell you how it's connected.
You know,

728
00:46:17,221 --> 00:46:19,350
you're more connected to other people
than you think.

729
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:20,790
So,
you know,

730
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,730
we don't live in linear relationships
with one another.

731
00:46:23,731 --> 00:46:27,450
We live in network relationships.
So each of you is connected,

732
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:29,790
for example,
pretty directly to about a thousand

733
00:46:29,791 --> 00:46:32,370
people over the course of your life.
Thousand people.

734
00:46:32,371 --> 00:46:34,920
It's more than that probably.
But then you think,

735
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:37,350
well,
each of those thousand are connected to

736
00:46:37,351 --> 00:46:39,690
a thousand.
So that's a million.

737
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:44,810
So you're one person away from a million
people and then those thousand thousand

738
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:48,090
noah thousands.
And so you're two people away from a

739
00:46:48,091 --> 00:46:50,190
billion people.
And you know,

740
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:53,610
the thing that's interesting about a
network is that it has as many centers

741
00:46:53,611 --> 00:46:56,010
as there are nodes and one of the.

742
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:58,320
This is something Solzhenitsyn made
explicit,

743
00:46:58,321 --> 00:47:03,321
but one of the implicit presuppositions
of the Judeo Christian tradition is that

744
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:07,170
each soul is a center of the cosmos.
You think,

745
00:47:07,171 --> 00:47:08,130
well,
can that be true?

746
00:47:08,131 --> 00:47:12,420
It's like God only knows what's true.
What we know about consciousness you

747
00:47:12,421 --> 00:47:16,200
could put in a thimble.
We know nothing about consciousness.

748
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:19,470
We haven't advanced in our understanding
fact.

749
00:47:19,471 --> 00:47:22,130
We may have gone backwards over the last
400 years.

750
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:26,100
I mean we know nothing about the
relationship of the brain to conscious

751
00:47:26,101 --> 00:47:30,010
awareness or virtually nothing.
Bits and pieces here and consciousness

752
00:47:30,011 --> 00:47:34,390
is an absolute mystery and God only
knows where it came from or what it's up

753
00:47:34,391 --> 00:47:34,841
to you.
I mean,

754
00:47:34,841 --> 00:47:38,710
we know some things about human being.
We are fundamentally explorers of the

755
00:47:38,711 --> 00:47:40,870
unknown.
That's how we're built.

756
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:46,270
We take things apart and put them
together and communicate the results of

757
00:47:46,271 --> 00:47:47,920
that and we find pleasure in that.

758
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:53,110
But don't underestimate the utility of
getting your life together.

759
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:55,600
I mean,
besides,

760
00:47:55,601 --> 00:47:57,250
you can do that.
Besides,

761
00:47:57,251 --> 00:47:58,630
you're not going to hurt anyone if you
do that.

762
00:47:58,631 --> 00:48:00,220
You'll just make things better.
Plus,

763
00:48:00,221 --> 00:48:03,760
it's kind of humble.
It's like you can sweep underneath your

764
00:48:03,761 --> 00:48:05,080
bed,
you know,

765
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:07,540
you don't have to go out and wave a
placard around.

766
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:11,560
I'm against poverty.
It's like who's for poverty?

767
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:16,780
You know,
so I think you want to fix the world,

768
00:48:16,781 --> 00:48:19,630
fix your life.
It's a lot harder than you think,

769
00:48:19,631 --> 00:48:20,920
right?
It says in the New Testament,

770
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:23,080
it's harder to rule yourself than to
rule the city,

771
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:25,060
but why?
Well,

772
00:48:25,061 --> 00:48:26,830
it turns out you're more complicated
than a city.

773
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:30,640
It also turns out that you're more
important in some sense than a city,

774
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,940
and it also turns out to matter what you
do with your life,

775
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:36,820
not it matters for you and it matters
for everyone else.

776
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:40,570
And it probably matters for the destiny
of being mean.

777
00:48:40,571 --> 00:48:43,420
That's what it means in some sense to be
made in God's image.

778
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:44,771
And you know,
you think,

779
00:48:44,771 --> 00:48:46,660
well,
I don't take that stuff very seriously.

780
00:48:46,661 --> 00:48:49,240
It's like your whole legal system is
predicated on that idea.

781
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,820
So don't say it.
You don't take it seriously.

782
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:52,920
You know,
you,

783
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,210
you presume that you have intrinsic
value,

784
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,280
it's a presupposition,
right?

785
00:48:57,410 --> 00:48:59,560
Well,
what is intrinsic value need?

786
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:02,800
It's grounded in something,
it's transcendent value.

787
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:06,610
And even if you don't believe in it,
you act it out and you'll be very

788
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:09,760
annoyed if anybody interferes with your
transcendent value.

789
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:14,080
So who cares what you say you believe.
What do you know about yourself?

790
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:16,840
You know,
we wouldn't have psychology if we were

791
00:49:16,841 --> 00:49:19,660
transparent to ourselves.
We wouldn't have drama,

792
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:22,900
you know,
just because you believe something about

793
00:49:22,901 --> 00:49:24,370
who you are doesn't make it true.

794
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:30,250
So
this is back to Michael or to Eric

795
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:31,383
Harris.
Um,

796
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:36,670
what parenting or educational practices
help to develop such extreme arrogance

797
00:49:36,671 --> 00:49:38,980
is displayed by somebody like Eric
Harris.

798
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:45,600
It's not self evident that it was
parenting per se that produced Harris,

799
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:50,500
you know,
and I would hesitate to lay

800
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:55,510
responsibility at his parents' feet.
People make choices,

801
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,110
and this is a rough one because we don't
have the science for that because the

802
00:49:59,111 --> 00:49:59,921
science says,
well,

803
00:49:59,921 --> 00:50:03,550
it's got to be causal in some factors.
So you look at sociological economic

804
00:50:03,551 --> 00:50:08,551
causes and you know there's all these
deterministic events on the social side

805
00:50:08,971 --> 00:50:11,290
and on the natural side,
nature and nurture,

806
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:13,150
that's all you are,
is nature and nurture.

807
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,760
It's like,
well,

808
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:18,820
maybe not.
You're also actually nature,

809
00:50:18,821 --> 00:50:23,680
nurture and consciousness and
consciousness seems to be able to make

810
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:27,500
choices and the choices seem to matter.
So

811
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:34,160
you can come from a pretty wretched
family and a pretty wretched social

812
00:50:34,161 --> 00:50:39,161
circumstance where absolutely everything
is stacked against you and come out

813
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,810
pretty damn good.

814
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:46,940
Most people who abuse their children
were abused as children.

815
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:48,740
Causal,
right?

816
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:49,603
Well,
no.

817
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:54,440
Most people who were abused as children
don't abuse their children.

818
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,150
The causality only works when you go
from the abuse back.

819
00:50:59,151 --> 00:51:01,550
Okay?
So the pool of abused people is high.

820
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:05,960
Most of them don't abuse their children.
But if you look at child abusers,

821
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:08,330
small pool,
most of them were abused,

822
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:10,250
but you're not talking about the whole
continuum.

823
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:14,390
Most people who are abused don't abuse.
And when you know that,

824
00:51:14,391 --> 00:51:17,240
because if they did think about it,
if they did,

825
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:21,800
it would spread exponentially and then
everyone would be being raised by

826
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:24,890
seriously violent,
abusive parents and would take no time

827
00:51:24,891 --> 00:51:27,050
at all.
I can take a few generations and poof,

828
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:29,280
everyone would be a violent abuser.
It's like,

829
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:32,150
that doesn't happen.
So weirdly enough,

830
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:37,180
the horrors of history don't necessarily
accumulate and become transferred.

831
00:51:37,971 --> 00:51:40,940
And I've seen this in my own practice.
Like I have one client who,

832
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:44,750
she had a pretty nasty upbringing.
Her mother pretty much did everything

833
00:51:44,751 --> 00:51:46,940
she possibly could to make sure that she
had

834
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:50,780
no real self confidence.

835
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:56,210
And uh,
what she learned from that was not to do

836
00:51:56,211 --> 00:51:59,030
that to her son.
And she raised an excellent son.

837
00:51:59,031 --> 00:52:01,370
It's like she had every reason to,
you know,

838
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:05,420
perpetuate her misery as a consequence
of resentment.

839
00:52:05,421 --> 00:52:07,490
And she has some resentment and it's not
surprising,

840
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:08,690
but she swore,
man,

841
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,300
I'm going not,
I'm not going to do this to my son.

842
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,100
And she did a great job.
Like,

843
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:17,630
I know her quite well and he's a.
She didn't overprotect him.

844
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,990
That's pretty good.
He tells the truth.

845
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,610
He's,
he's on a career,

846
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,150
you know,
he's,

847
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:26,480
he's got his career going.
He's a straightforward young guy and he

848
00:52:26,481 --> 00:52:27,800
likes his mom,
you know,

849
00:52:27,801 --> 00:52:31,090
so good deal,
but count for that causally.

850
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:33,770
The problem is,
and this is something you observed a

851
00:52:33,771 --> 00:52:38,771
long time ago,
any event can produce multiple causal

852
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,870
pathways while not any event,
but you know,

853
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:48,080
any complex event so determinism,
I think the world's too complicated to

854
00:52:49,411 --> 00:52:51,960
be deterministic.
So

855
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:01,280
ideas.
You've been listening to a history of

856
00:53:01,281 --> 00:53:06,281
violence and exploration by psychologist
Jordan Peterson into the human lust for

857
00:53:07,281 --> 00:53:11,630
violence and killing on Youtube.
You can find many of his talks that

858
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:16,640
Jordan Peterson videos.
This program was recorded at the studio

859
00:53:16,641 --> 00:53:20,030
theater of the Stratford Festival.
