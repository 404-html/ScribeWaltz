1
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,170
I think of all the stories that we've
investigated so far,

2
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:41,490
all the fundamental and myths of
creation that we've investigated so far.

3
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,600
The two that we're going to talk about
in detail today are probably the two

4
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:49,680
stories that have had more impact on the
course of world history than any other

5
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:52,170
two.
I'm going to talk in some detail today

6
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:55,050
about the story of creation laid out in
genesis,

7
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,690
genesis,
and also the story of the Buddha's

8
00:00:57,691 --> 00:01:00,600
enlightenment.
Both stories are also characterized by a

9
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:05,601
kind of depth that's virtually limitless
and I think in some ways that the topics

10
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:11,601
we're going to discuss today are the
most enlightening of all the many ideas

11
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:18,981
that we've traveled through so far in
this series.

12
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:24,411
So we're going to be concentrating on an
analysis of this Schema.

13
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:27,360
Again,
the idea of being here,

14
00:01:27,361 --> 00:01:29,760
of course,
that the world of experience,

15
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:32,550
which is the world that mythology is
attempting to describe,

16
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,480
has these fundamental constituent
elements.

17
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,170
One associated with chaos or nature or
the unknown,

18
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:45,171
one associated with culture or the great
farther or the predictable and another

19
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:50,691
associated with the architect will son
the individual who's the offspring of

20
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:54,990
the interplay of these two fundamental
forces.

21
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:00,050
Now given that part of the purpose of
this series is to elucidate the causes

22
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,350
of war and motivation for war attention
paid to the dualistic nature of the

23
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:10,351
individual is of paramount importance.
So we could say that just as nature has

24
00:02:10,841 --> 00:02:13,570
its terrible side and just this culture
has its terrible side,

25
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,580
so the individual has his or her
terrible side and the depth of that

26
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,250
capacity say for atrocity and
vengefulness is just as deep as the

27
00:02:24,251 --> 00:02:27,010
depth of terror that the unknown itself
holds.

28
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,370
I think this is so called,
uh,

29
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,330
uh,
difficult fact for normal individuals to

30
00:02:34,331 --> 00:02:39,331
grass given that we're highly motivated
to view ourselves as if not precisely

31
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:41,410
good,
at least as relatively harmless.

32
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,320
But the evidence that as individuals we
are relatively harmless,

33
00:02:44,321 --> 00:02:46,510
is very,
very thin indeed.

34
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,010
And I don't think it's possible to
understand the depth

35
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,760
of motivation for atrocity and social
conflict without coming to terms with

36
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,310
the capacity for evil.
That's characteristic of the individual.

37
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:02,890
Now,
both the story in genesis and the story

38
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,790
of the Buddha's enlightenment,
uh,

39
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,670
laid bare in many ways the nature of the
structure of individual eval and also

40
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:11,710
not only it's structured,
but it's motivation.

41
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:16,711
Why it is that people would turn more or
less voluntarily away from the good and

42
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:21,190
embrace what can only be described as
its polar opposite.

43
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,520
So in addition to making reference to
this structural Schema,

44
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:29,740
of course,
we're also going to be discussing,

45
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,470
it's the typical mode of interaction of
these elements of experience.

46
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,180
You may note for example,
that this diagram with which you're now

47
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:44,180
very familiar,
that the notion of order chaos and

48
00:03:44,181 --> 00:03:48,440
reestablishment of order also parallels
the structure of the story in Genesis,

49
00:03:48,441 --> 00:03:51,740
the creation myth where human beings are
created first and existed.

50
00:03:51,741 --> 00:03:54,560
A paradise will state that that paradise
is disrupted.

51
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,580
That as the,
as a consequence of some,

52
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,730
some uh,
event,

53
00:03:58,731 --> 00:04:00,660
uh,
virtually cosmic significance,

54
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,970
that as a consequence of that
disruption,

55
00:04:02,971 --> 00:04:07,971
people are destined to live a profane
existence in constant wait for the next

56
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,720
state of,
of order.

57
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:22,070
So just as this is a fundamental
archetipal structure,

58
00:04:22,071 --> 00:04:24,530
so that fundamental architectural
structure is,

59
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,740
constitutes the,
the basic grammar for the story in

60
00:04:27,741 --> 00:04:29,780
genesis.
Now what we're going to do to begin with

61
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,080
is to do describe precisely how this
idea of paradise descent and the search

62
00:04:36,721 --> 00:04:41,070
for paradise is illustrated symbolically
agenesis and exactly what those symbolic

63
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:44,130
representations mean.
The idea here being that the reason that

64
00:04:44,131 --> 00:04:47,510
the authors of Genesis,
the multiple authors of Genesis six

65
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,990
extending over thousands and thousands
of years chose those symbols is not

66
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:55,650
because they were laboring to be obscure
or not because they were establishing a

67
00:04:55,651 --> 00:04:59,490
pre empirical representation of reality.
I kind of,

68
00:04:59,491 --> 00:05:01,590
cause I seem to scientific
representation,

69
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,860
but because these symbols have an
elusive or metaphorical richness than

70
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:10,050
enables a story,
although short to be characterized by an

71
00:05:10,051 --> 00:05:12,330
almost infinite depth.
That's part of the reason.

72
00:05:12,331 --> 00:05:16,050
The other part of the reason is that
when you say something profound,

73
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:20,520
you say it using the language,
the chorus language that you have access

74
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:20,730
to.

75
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:23,700
And if the story is almost unalterably
profound,

76
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,940
then the images in which is in shrouded
are almost in comprehensively complex.

77
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:34,960
Then it has to be that way.
Because if the target of the

78
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:39,250
investigation is reality itself,
something so complex that we cannot

79
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,730
conceptualize it fully,
then the language that we use to

80
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,170
represent that reality has to stretch us
to the limits of our ability to

81
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:49,460
understand.
And it is the case that historian

82
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,920
genesis say as much as the story of the
Buddha's enlightenment constitutes an

83
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:58,850
artistic endeavor on the part of the
human race to portray the nature of

84
00:05:58,851 --> 00:06:02,690
human reality and to explain that
behavioral and philosophical

85
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:06,410
consequences of that reality,
that being a tall order,

86
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:11,411
perhaps we should forgive the multiple
authors for only being able to manage it

87
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:16,190
in a way that's essentially images stick
and dramatic rather than explicit,

88
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,290
logical,
philosophical,

89
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,460
and fully developed.

90
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,590
So the first thing I'd like to point out
to you is to,

91
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:28,790
is a statement made by Garcia Eliod,
which I think is one of the most

92
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:33,350
enlightening things I ever read.
Now the first thing that Ellia does is

93
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,410
describe the universality of flood
mythology,

94
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:40,340
but then he puts a twist on it.
So the idea behind flooding mythology is

95
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:45,341
something like this.
If societies deviate from an emergent,

96
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,090
unnecessarily emergent kind of morality,
a kind of reality that takes the

97
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:53,090
viewpoint of all the inhabitants of a
given society into account.

98
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,300
If it's society deviates from that
viewpoint sufficiently,

99
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,350
it dunes itself to annihilation.
That annihilation being represented

100
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:04,880
mythologies mythologically as the
flooding of the society by that pre

101
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,510
cosmotronic water sleep,
the primordial element or chaos.

102
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:13,250
So societies that are tyrannical doing
themselves to eradication by chaos,

103
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,890
a simple equation but made more
complicated by Ellie.

104
00:07:16,891 --> 00:07:21,140
He's observation that more than one
factor plays a role in the establishment

105
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:21,974
of a tyranny.

106
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,250
On the one hand,
there's the straight degeneration of

107
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:29,990
cultural presuppositions in that if you
establish a state or a game,

108
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:34,190
which has particular rules because of
the environment is constantly

109
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:37,850
transforming itself.
The rules by necessity become out of

110
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:40,010
date.
So merely as a consequence of the

111
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:43,820
progression of time,
the presuppositions on which any state

112
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:47,480
or found them tend to become less and
less relevant to the current

113
00:07:47,481 --> 00:07:48,320
environment.
Okay,

114
00:07:48,321 --> 00:07:52,340
so there's this aging and senility
merely as a consequence of thermodynamic

115
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:54,890
processes.
But then Eliana also points out that

116
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:58,760
there's one additional factor which has
to be attributed not to society,

117
00:07:58,761 --> 00:08:00,980
but to the individuals that make up that
society,

118
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,870
which is that the strictures and rules
on which society is founded,

119
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,980
Ken,
be constantly and carefully updated when

120
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:12,680
necessary,
if all the individuals that make up dot

121
00:08:12,681 --> 00:08:17,360
society are perfectly willing to
confront exemplars of emergent chaos in

122
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:18,194
their own lives.

123
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,860
When those exemplars and merge,
which is to say that it's perfectly

124
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:25,130
reasonable to be guided in your
personality by the structures of your

125
00:08:25,131 --> 00:08:27,290
state.
But if you face something unknown that

126
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:31,130
those rules cannot handle,
it's a moral necessity and obligation on

127
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:35,540
your part to face that emergent anomaly
forthrightly to souls,

128
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:38,240
it if you can,
and then to communicate the consequences

129
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:41,090
of your solution to the rest of the
members of your society.

130
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:44,120
Now with Elliot,
it points out is that the individual

131
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:47,720
who,
who removes him or herself from the

132
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:52,610
responsibility of confronting their own
and normally speeds the process by which

133
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:55,830
the state decays.
So the decay of the state and the

134
00:08:55,831 --> 00:09:00,831
possibility for the emergence of chaos
is an interaction between the tendency

135
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:06,051
of the state to a archaism and senility
merely as a consequence of change and

136
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:09,480
the voluntarily,
the voluntary unwillingness of the

137
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:13,290
citizens that comprise that state to
face the unknown courageously when it

138
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,040
confronts them.

139
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,890
So Elliot,
it says the Deluge myth is almost

140
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:20,850
university disseminated.
It is documented in all the continents,

141
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,000
although very rarely in Africa,
probably because of the relative

142
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:26,730
shortage of water and on various
cultural levels.

143
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,300
A certain number of variates seem to be
the result of dissemination,

144
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,640
first from Mesopotamia and then from
India.

145
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:37,890
It is equally possible that one or
several dilute catastrophes gave rise to

146
00:09:37,891 --> 00:09:41,130
fabulous narratives.
But it would be risky to explain.

147
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:44,940
So widespread of myth by phenomena of
which no geological traces have been

148
00:09:44,941 --> 00:09:47,340
found.
The majority of the flood myths seem in

149
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:49,410
some sense to form part of the cosmic
rhythm.

150
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:53,550
The old world,
people by a fallen humanity is submerged

151
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:57,420
under the water and then sometime later
a new world emerges from the aquatic

152
00:09:57,421 --> 00:10:00,540
chaos.
In a large number of variants,

153
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,290
the flood is the result of the sins or
ritual faults of human beings.

154
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,370
Sometimes it results simply from the
wish of a divine being to put an end to

155
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:12,030
mankind.
The chief causes light once therefore in

156
00:10:12,031 --> 00:10:16,260
the sins of men and the decrepitude of
the world by the mere fact that it

157
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:19,620
exists.
That is that it lives in producers.

158
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,520
The cosmos gradually deteriorates and
ends up falling into decay.

159
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,980
This is the reason why it has to be
recreated.

160
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,310
In other words,
the flood realizes on a macrocosmic

161
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,280
scale,
what is symbolically effected during the

162
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,900
New Year Festival,
the end of the world,

163
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,060
and the end of a sinful humanity in
order to make a new creation possible.

164
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:46,200
So then the question might arise
logically enough.

165
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,520
What is it that would motivate an
individual to work to avoid a normally

166
00:10:50,521 --> 00:10:55,521
when it emerges in his or her own life
and to risk and eventual flood even more

167
00:10:55,741 --> 00:10:58,140
profoundly,
what would motivate an individual

168
00:10:58,141 --> 00:11:02,490
perhaps to work for the antithesis of
order to work,

169
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,780
to promote the emergence of chaos?
Since we know that people are relatively

170
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:11,781
ambivalent in their moral stance,
is it possible that we can create a,

171
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,240
a compelling motivational story for the
desire of the individual as such,

172
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,530
to work against the emergence of the
good rather than for it.

173
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,940
So let's take a look at what genesis
says about the creation of experience.

174
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:29,670
So first of all,
remember we're taking a phenomenological

175
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,150
stance on this story,
which is to say that this story is not

176
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:38,270
an objective retelling of I've
materialistic emergence.

177
00:11:38,341 --> 00:11:41,610
It's something more specifically
dramatic.

178
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,340
It describes the nature of human
experience.

179
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:45,990
Okay.
The nature of conscious human

180
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:49,470
experience.
And in fact the creation story in

181
00:11:49,471 --> 00:11:52,920
genesis lays explicit stress on
individual consciousness,

182
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,620
literally as a precondition for being
itself.

183
00:11:56,621 --> 00:12:00,250
Which is to say that underlying the
story of genesis is the notion that

184
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:05,251
without whatever consciousness is there
would be no segregated entities and

185
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:09,070
therefore no being so.
This is one manner in which genesis

186
00:12:09,071 --> 00:12:12,700
attempts to put human beings at the
center of the cosmos,

187
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:16,540
so to speak,
which is the idea that the world

188
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:21,340
independently of consciousness,
whatever that world is absolutely needs

189
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,420
to be reflected by consciousness in
order to exist in any sense that

190
00:12:25,421 --> 00:12:30,421
existence could reasonably be defined.
First chapter in the beginning,

191
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:35,530
God created the heaven and the earth and
the earth was without form and void and

192
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:39,520
darkness was on the face of the deep.
Now the idea that the earth was without

193
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:44,020
form and void takes us back to the
Mesopotamian creation myth and Marduk

194
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,453
and tie mat.

195
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,310
Because the word for void,
the Hebrew word for void,

196
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:52,360
his tail and Tam is a word derived from
ty Matt.

197
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,350
And the void,
the chaos that constitutes the unformed

198
00:12:56,351 --> 00:13:01,351
condition of the cosmos prior to the
elaboration of being is assimilated to

199
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:05,500
the same category as tire mat,
which is this terrible,

200
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,680
unformed and frightening a priori
condition that has to be courageously

201
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:13,510
confronted in order to manifest itself
as being.

202
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,050
And the earth was without form and void
and darkness was on the face of the

203
00:13:17,051 --> 00:13:19,630
deep.
So now you see another,

204
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,230
another interplay of opposites here
between matter and water,

205
00:13:23,231 --> 00:13:25,270
the primordial elements.
So first of all,

206
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:28,780
it's heaven and earth and then it's
earth and water and,

207
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:33,100
and the height and the deep and the
spirit of God moved upon the face of the

208
00:13:33,101 --> 00:13:36,550
waters.
So another opposite representation

209
00:13:36,551 --> 00:13:40,780
between spirit and whatever it is that
the pre cosmotronic water or chaos

210
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,040
constitutes.

211
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,610
And God said,
let there be light and there was light

212
00:13:45,611 --> 00:13:48,820
and God saw the light that it was good
and God divided the light from the

213
00:13:48,821 --> 00:13:51,820
darkness and then a prototypical
division between light,

214
00:13:51,821 --> 00:13:56,290
which is associated with illumination
and enlightenment and consciousness

215
00:13:56,291 --> 00:14:01,291
because we're conscious during the day
and the sun and life that emerges nested

216
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:05,170
inside this initial opening lines of
this sentence,

217
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,150
uh,
northrop frye notes that there's

218
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:14,170
tremendous emphasis on the notion of s a
repetitive cycling of days and nights in

219
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:18,400
the opening sentences of genesis,
even though from a formal perspective,

220
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:23,380
this emphasis is paradoxical because the
notion of the day merges before the

221
00:14:23,381 --> 00:14:27,610
creation of the sun and fry's point is
not that this is some careless gesture

222
00:14:27,611 --> 00:14:30,070
on the part of the people who authored
genesis,

223
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:33,940
but more that it's an attempt to
emphasize the idea of a cyclical

224
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:38,110
relationship between consciousness and
light and darkness and chaos.

225
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,440
And,
and,

226
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:43,060
and to highlight the idea that it's
cyclical relationship is somehow

227
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,600
absolutely vital to being itself.
So genesis one five says,

228
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:53,000
and God called the light day and the
darkness he called night and the evening

229
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:55,100
in the morning where the first day fry's
says,

230
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:59,000
the central metaphor underlying
beginning is not really birth at all.

231
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:01,370
It has rather the moment of waking from
sleep.

232
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:06,380
When one world disappears,
a world of virtuality and potential and

233
00:15:06,381 --> 00:15:10,580
another comes into actual beating.
This is still contained within a cycle.

234
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,890
We know that at the end of the day,
we shall return to the world of sleep

235
00:15:13,891 --> 00:15:16,100
and,
and that's a notion that has a

236
00:15:16,101 --> 00:15:20,000
metaphorical resonance because there's
the sleep that punctuates periods of

237
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:22,370
consciousness,
and then there's the great sleep at the

238
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:25,190
end end of life,
which is characterized by the complete

239
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:29,120
cessation of consciousness.
We knew that at the end of the day we

240
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:32,360
shall return to the world of sleep,
but in the meantime there's a sense of

241
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:37,130
self transcendence of a consciousness
getting up from an unreal into a real or

242
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:41,090
at least more real world,
but a sense of awakening into a greater

243
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:44,870
degree of reality is expressed by
hereclitis as a passing from a world

244
00:15:44,871 --> 00:15:49,610
where everyone has his own logos into a
world where there's a carmen logos.

245
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:54,470
The experience that we all share.
Genesis presents the creation as a

246
00:15:54,471 --> 00:15:58,340
sudden coming into being of a world
through articulate speech,

247
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:03,350
which is another aspect of logos.
Logos incorporates the idea of creative

248
00:16:03,351 --> 00:16:07,670
exploration and then the formulation of
the consequences of that exploration and

249
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:10,370
verbally communicable categories,
right,

250
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,430
which give our,
give our aspects of our being there

251
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:18,431
defined boundaries and parameters and
enable us to establish a shared mode of

252
00:16:18,441 --> 00:16:21,950
social being
through articulate speech,

253
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:24,170
conscious perception,
light and stability.

254
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,940
Something like this metaphor of
awakening.

255
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:29,900
Maybe the real reason for the emphasis
on days and such recurring phrases and

256
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:31,760
the evening in the morning where the
first day,

257
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,810
even before the day is we know it was
established with the creating of the

258
00:16:35,811 --> 00:16:36,644
sun.

259
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:46,850
The most fundamental pair of conflicting
and sick likely interacting pairs of

260
00:16:47,551 --> 00:16:50,710
opposites that is portrayed in genesis
is essentially the,

261
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,980
the pairing of chaos versus order.
Generative chaos versus generative order

262
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,730
and a poem expresses this idea extremely
well and very powerfully,

263
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,310
so I'm going to read it to sacred night
sweeps.

264
00:17:05,311 --> 00:17:10,110
Having word she takes the glad the wind
some day and folding it rolls up.

265
00:17:10,111 --> 00:17:14,370
It's gold carpet that had been spread
over an abysmal pit,

266
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,670
gone vision like as the external world
and man,

267
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:22,170
a homeless orphan has to face an author
helplessness naked alone.

268
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:26,490
The blackness of immeasurable space upon
himself.

269
00:17:26,491 --> 00:17:29,040
He has to lean with mind,
abolished,

270
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,040
thought and fathered in the dim depths
of his soul.

271
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:37,041
He sinks for nothing comes from outside
to support or limit him all life and

272
00:17:37,231 --> 00:17:38,250
brightness.
Semen,

273
00:17:38,251 --> 00:17:41,730
ancient dream.
While in the substance of the night

274
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,530
unraveled alien.

275
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,310
He now perceives a fateful something
that is his by right?

276
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:53,040
Absolutely brilliant poetic statement.
I think laying out very nicely,

277
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:57,750
very richly that the fundamental nature
of the existential paradox that

278
00:17:57,751 --> 00:18:02,751
constitutes human life pointing to a
very profound sense of futility in

279
00:18:03,451 --> 00:18:06,120
theory,
but then beyond that to the notion that

280
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:10,260
in the depths of the unknown,
in the depths of the darkness and in the

281
00:18:10,261 --> 00:18:13,740
depths of all that,
that's fundamentally unfakeable,

282
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:18,030
there are still lurks something that can
be discovered given sufficient courage,

283
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:25,610
another fundamental division portrayed
indirectly in genesis the word versus

284
00:18:27,091 --> 00:18:29,910
chaos.
So what you have in genesis is an

285
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,650
absolutely stellar idea.
I think perhaps the most fundamental

286
00:18:34,651 --> 00:18:39,630
contribution of archaic Jewish thinking
to Western and world civilization,

287
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:44,631
which is that although it is easier in
some ways to consider the actual matrix

288
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:48,420
of things,
their material substrate as the strata

289
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:52,260
from which they emerge,
it is equally reasonable and perhaps

290
00:18:52,261 --> 00:18:57,261
more pragmatically useful to know that
things only exist because of the

291
00:18:57,421 --> 00:19:00,750
interaction between the logos,
the word that characterizes

292
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,240
consciousness and whatever this matrix
is.

293
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,240
So in Jewish thought and then Christian
thought and of course in in thoughts of

294
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:09,750
that sort of echoed throughout the
world.

295
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:14,400
There's the idea that consciousness
associated with the transcendent

296
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:18,060
directly associated with the daddy is
actually the thing that in the

297
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:23,061
interaction with this matrix give re
gives rise to being genesis plays a

298
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:28,470
stress places stress on this notion of
the internal logos,

299
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,680
the individual consciousness and to very
complex ways.

300
00:19:31,681 --> 00:19:34,380
It's first stance that it's the word of
God,

301
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,440
the logos of God that gives or that
gives ordered to chaos and makes being

302
00:19:40,101 --> 00:19:43,260
emerged.
But then even more particularly it's

303
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:47,430
the,
it's the self conscious logos of

304
00:19:47,431 --> 00:19:50,850
individual humans,
their capacity not just to see the world

305
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:55,560
as an object but also to see themselves
as an object that gives the world that

306
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:58,320
particular value slump that it has for
us.

307
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:03,321
Which is to say that not only are we in
a world where the subject and the object

308
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:05,490
are separated and,
and,

309
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:09,180
and therefore experience and suffer the
consequences of that separation.

310
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,410
But even more particularly,
we are the only creatures who are so

311
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:16,980
conscious that we can observe our self
as objects.

312
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:20,910
And the consequence of that is that
because we've extended our consciousness

313
00:20:20,911 --> 00:20:23,940
to ourself,
we're capable of conceptualizing things

314
00:20:23,941 --> 00:20:25,890
that other creatures cannot
conceptualize,

315
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,390
such as the infinite possibility that
lays manifested in the unknown,

316
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:35,540
but also the fact that as individuals
were subject to our finite limitations,

317
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:39,390
right,
that we can become diseased,

318
00:20:39,391 --> 00:20:42,510
that we can become mentally ill on that
finally will die.

319
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,530
And so the idea here is that something
like the extension of logos to the

320
00:20:47,531 --> 00:20:52,531
object to the subject has made human
existence finally problematic.

321
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:00,400
And Genesis refers to this as
essentially the heritable sin of Adam

322
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:05,470
because we're aware of our own
vulnerability as a genetic consequence

323
00:21:05,471 --> 00:21:09,040
merely of being human.
There's a transformation in the nature

324
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:13,030
of experience that has essentially
cosmic significance.

325
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:21,870
Lout sue and the Dao de Jing makes a
comment on the formless chaos that

326
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:26,950
constitutes the matrix of things,
the origin of things in the following

327
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:30,370
manner.
He says there was something formless yet

328
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:34,180
to complete that existed before heaven
and earth without sound,

329
00:21:34,181 --> 00:21:37,930
without substance.
This is the void or the chaos dependent

330
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:39,610
on nothing,
unchanging,

331
00:21:39,611 --> 00:21:43,390
all pervading unfailing.
When we think of it as the mother of all

332
00:21:43,391 --> 00:21:47,830
things under having the idea here being
that whatever experience is in the

333
00:21:47,831 --> 00:21:51,910
absence of a delimited human
consciousness is something that's

334
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:56,410
outside the boundaries of time.
Because time is a temporary is a human

335
00:21:56,411 --> 00:22:00,610
attribute and it's outside the
boundaries of spatial limitation because

336
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:05,790
only human beings with their delimited
and fixed size can attribute spatial

337
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:11,730
aspects to being itself.
So whatever it is is that exists without

338
00:22:12,251 --> 00:22:14,920
us.
It's so comprehensive and so complete

339
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:19,810
and transcends temporal dimensions to
such a great degree that it can't be

340
00:22:19,811 --> 00:22:24,550
conceptualized as being at all.
It's something that transcends being to

341
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:28,630
such a degree that it's not even
nameable but still exists as the mother

342
00:22:28,631 --> 00:22:30,430
of all things under heaven.

343
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:37,480
Now,
genesis formerly associates the human

344
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:42,040
being with logos.
And this is a determinitive move in

345
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:45,340
human history,
just as the Mesopotamians first

346
00:22:45,341 --> 00:22:50,110
hypothesized that their emperor was
equivalent to Marduk the force that

347
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,380
confronted timeout and carved her into
pieces and made the world.

348
00:22:53,381 --> 00:22:58,360
And just as the Egyptians conceptualize
their pharaoh as the intermingling

349
00:22:58,361 --> 00:23:01,690
between ocirus stability of the state
and horace,

350
00:23:01,691 --> 00:23:06,190
the exploratory hero,
and then disseminated that identity down

351
00:23:06,191 --> 00:23:10,960
the aristocratic levels closer and
closer to the individual individual.

352
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,740
So the ancient Hebrews said,
and God said,

353
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:18,490
let us make man in our image after our
likeness.

354
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:23,550
Now it could be said that the logical
derivation of that statement is that God

355
00:23:24,641 --> 00:23:26,680
looks like human beings,
or conversely,

356
00:23:26,681 --> 00:23:29,860
that God is an old man with a beard,
but it means something.

357
00:23:29,861 --> 00:23:32,170
I think that's more sophisticated than
that,

358
00:23:32,171 --> 00:23:37,171
which is that the central aspect that's
associated with this transcendent daddy,

359
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:40,570
the logos,
which is the thing that gives rise to

360
00:23:40,571 --> 00:23:43,480
order as a consequence of his
confrontation with chaos,

361
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:47,210
is also the thing that centrally
characterizes human consciousness.

362
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,690
And so with that,
there's this transcendent notion that

363
00:23:50,691 --> 00:23:55,130
inside each human being is a spark of
genuine divinity,

364
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,640
and it's the manifestation of that
divinity in human,

365
00:23:58,641 --> 00:24:03,170
temporal and spatial parameters that
literally keeps the cosmos generating.

366
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,800
So God created man in his own image,
in the image of God created he,

367
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:16,670
him male and female,
created he them and let them have

368
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:20,060
dominion over the fish of the sea and
the fall of the air and over the cattle

369
00:24:20,061 --> 00:24:23,600
and over all the earth and over every
creeping thing that creepeth upon the

370
00:24:23,601 --> 00:24:26,960
earth.
Now the fundamentalist Christians read

371
00:24:26,961 --> 00:24:28,550
this as an injunction,
right?

372
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:32,480
This is what human being should do,
dominate all other living things,

373
00:24:32,481 --> 00:24:36,110
but it's more like a description,
which is that the consequence of the

374
00:24:36,111 --> 00:24:40,730
embeddedness of this spark of divinity
in the individual is precisely what gave

375
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:43,310
rise to the human ability to dominate
the planet.

376
00:24:43,311 --> 00:24:45,440
We just an ability that at least at the
moment,

377
00:24:45,441 --> 00:24:49,580
seems fundamentally unparalleled with no
limit in sight.

378
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:54,110
So it's not an injunction so much as a
cold hearted description.

379
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:00,590
There's a very profound idea underlying
the necessity of the creation of the

380
00:25:00,591 --> 00:25:01,820
individual human big.

381
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:05,900
There's a line of Archaic Jewish
speculation that runs something like

382
00:25:05,901 --> 00:25:10,070
this.
Why is the creation of a limited subject

383
00:25:10,071 --> 00:25:13,220
necessary?
If God's Omniscience and omnipotent and

384
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,160
omnipresent,
why would he bother creating anything

385
00:25:16,161 --> 00:25:19,070
outside of himself?
And the line of speculation runs like

386
00:25:19,071 --> 00:25:22,520
this.
The one thing that a being that is

387
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:26,660
complete in all regards,
even all hypothetical regards,

388
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:31,820
lax by necessity is limitation.
And as a consequence of that,

389
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:36,470
anything that's absolute is not complete
and can't be complete without

390
00:25:36,471 --> 00:25:40,040
limitation.
And so there's an emergent idea in

391
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:44,420
genesis and most notions of the
emergence of human consciousness that

392
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:47,830
the absolute needs,
the reflection point of a delimited

393
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,220
being to actually spring into some kind
of defined actuality.

394
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,660
So that being itself becomes an an an
interplay between the necessarily

395
00:25:56,661 --> 00:26:01,661
limitations of the finite and the
transcendent reality of the absolute.

396
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,240
And so being is something that emerges
because of the fact as another ancient

397
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:14,000
Jewish tradition has it gone in man or
in a sense twins mutually dependent on

398
00:26:14,001 --> 00:26:19,001
one another for their defined being from
such a perspective being has the same

399
00:26:21,531 --> 00:26:22,700
nature as a game.

400
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,040
When you're playing a game,
you have to play by rules,

401
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:28,790
which means that there are things that
you can do well playing the game with.

402
00:26:28,791 --> 00:26:30,560
There are many,
many things you can't do,

403
00:26:30,561 --> 00:26:34,250
and that the game could not exist
without the limitations.

404
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:38,300
Also predicated on the idea that the
imposition and Nietzsche and idea that

405
00:26:38,301 --> 00:26:42,470
the imposition of limitations on a
structure actually gives rise to the

406
00:26:42,471 --> 00:26:46,830
possibility diverse new forms,
which is also a very sophisticated way

407
00:26:46,831 --> 00:26:51,660
of conceptualizing the world.
So from the perspective of Genesis,

408
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:56,550
the individual is the low cow of the
experiential drama,

409
00:26:56,551 --> 00:27:01,440
and the fact that the individual is
limited is a necessary precondition for

410
00:27:01,441 --> 00:27:02,274
being right.

411
00:27:59,700 --> 00:27:59,770
Okay.
