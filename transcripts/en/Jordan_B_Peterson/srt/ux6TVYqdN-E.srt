1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:05,020
Okay,
so the last time,

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,433
so the last time we talked,
I talked to you about how the knowledge 

3
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:18,444
structures that we inhabit might be 
built from the bottom up and so I'm 

4
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,040
showing you this diagram because it 
might help clarify that a little bit,

5
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,143
so what you see at the top of this 
hierarchy partially built hierarchy and 

6
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:33,414
so one way of thinking of an attribute 
like good when you apply it to a person 

7
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:39,144
or bad or evil or or wonderful or 
whatever is to think about it as a 

8
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:44,940
description of an object,
but it's not really.

9
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:45,774
It's a shorthand for a set of.
While I think of them as micro 

10
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:50,904
personalities,
but you could also think about them as 

11
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:56,910
behavioral patterns.
Now one of the things I mentioned to you

12
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,090
about,
I talked to you a little bit about words

13
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,373
at one point and what words signify and 
this is a very complicated problem and 

14
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:06,594
so most of you are probably Augustinians
without really knowing it because St 

15
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,010
Augustine originally proposed that a 
word was a label for a thing.

16
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,950
And of course that's how people 
naturally think.

17
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:17,784
I mean,
I'm sure most of you would regard that 

18
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:23,730
definition as perfectly suitable,
but it's not.

19
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,850
It's by no means the only definition and
it's by no means necessarily the correct

20
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:29,724
definition,
so there's a famous philosopher named 

21
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:32,754
Viv Goldstein who proposed instead that 
a word was like a piece in a chess game 

22
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,250
which meant that it was something that 
it was.

23
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,173
It was something that you did something 
with or you might think about it 

24
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:45,900
actually as a tool and when you think 
about how you use words,

25
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:46,734
then you can see that you're using them 
often as tools to interact with other 

26
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:53,130
people so that for a purpose,
right?

27
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,650
The words have a purpose and so the word
is a tool.

28
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,490
And what I like about the tool idea that
dual ideas,

29
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,343
very,
very evolutionarily sophisticated 

30
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,243
concept,
partly because we're tool using 

31
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:07,944
creatures probably beyond our other 
capacities except for possibly 

32
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:13,480
invitation and language set.

33
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:16,350
A set is so far apart from other 
animals,

34
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:17,723
but the thing about a tool is that the 
difference between dual in an object as 

35
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:24,840
an object doesn't have a user.
The word object doesn't imply user,

36
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:25,674
but the word tool implies user and it's 
not obvious that we ever interact with 

37
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:30,954
anything in the world without 
interacting with it in some motivated 

38
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:33,954
way.
And so what we're doing is using words 

39
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:40,200
to get through the world to interact 
properly within the world and to move to

40
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,180
where we want to go.
And so,

41
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:43,014
okay,
so that's the second way of thinking 

42
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:44,604
about where it.
Here's another way of thinking about a 

43
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:46,284
word.
A word is like a box of things and so 

44
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:50,994
imagine that you,
you've cleaned out your basement and 

45
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:54,930
there's a bunch of boxes downstairs and 
you know,

46
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:55,764
one box is labeled books while inside 
that box there can be any manner of 

47
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:00,970
books.

48
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,900
You know,
books is a very,

49
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:03,770
very diverse,
very,

50
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,810
very diverse set of phenomena.
If you're moving,

51
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,210
books are kind of condensed into one 
thing,

52
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:12,580
which is heavy objects that are made out
of paper.

53
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:13,983
No,
but you can also imagine another box 

54
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:20,680
that says things and in the thing box,
I'm sure you have a thing drawer at home

55
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:22,930
where you put all the things that you 
don't know what to do.

56
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:23,950
And,
and so it's like,

57
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:24,843
it's like the category of old things 
that you don't know what to do with 

58
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,630
things.
Okay.

59
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:33,631
So a word can also represent a 
relatively heterogenic heterogeneous set

60
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,020
of tools or entities.
And that's very much,

61
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,040
that's very,
very,

62
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:39,874
very useful to know because one of the 
things that happens often when people 

63
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:45,790
are arguing is that they use the same 
word,

64
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,580
but each word contains a set of 
different objects,

65
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:49,270
you know.

66
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,980
So you might say for example,
um,

67
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,320
is fear real questions like that are 
very strange.

68
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,980
They're not really answerable in some 
sense because it depends on exactly what

69
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:00,814
you mean by fear.
Because fear can contain a lot of 

70
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,663
heterogeneous entities roughly speaking.
And then it also means it also depends 

71
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:08,554
on what you mean by real.
And so you can define fear and you can 

72
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:14,080
define real.
So that fear is a subcategory of real.

73
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:16,180
Or you can define fear and you can 
define real.

74
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:19,300
So that fear isn't a subset of real.
So,

75
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:20,403
so like the idea that fear is a box that
only contains a certain set of entities 

76
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,260
or a certain set of tools.
And that reality is the same as wrong,

77
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,730
and people argue about those sorts of 
things all the time and you know,

78
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,680
they make these binary questions like,
is x a y?

79
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,543
Well x and y are generally not well 
enough defined so that you can easily 

80
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:43,030
come up with an answer to a binary 
question like that.

81
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,210
Okay.
So words can also represent a relatively

82
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:49,840
heterogeneous set of attributes or 
objects or tools.

83
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,210
When you say that someone's a good 
person,

84
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,793
for example,
you don't mean that they're a good 

85
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,044
person all the time or that everything 
they've ever done in their entire life 

86
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:00,964
is good because they wouldn't be a good 
person and they'd be a saint or some 

87
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:08,350
other fictional character like that.
So when you're applying the label,

88
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,720
we're calling label for the purposes of 
this argument.

89
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,240
It's a descriptive.
It's descriptive tool.

90
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:14,660
Actually,
when you're applying a,

91
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:19,690
a term like that to someone,
it's a shorthand for a variety of states

92
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,553
that this person could exist in the 
majority of which you would regard as 

93
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:24,790
positive.
You know?

94
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,980
And you might say,
well he's a better person than she is.

95
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,300
And then you'd say,
well,

96
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:31,480
the proportion of attributes that she 
has,

97
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,213
I think I said she,
whatever it exceeds the proportion of 

98
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,930
positive attributes that this other 
person has.

99
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,153
So the other way that you can think 
about a word is Mrs. More complicated 

100
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:43,420
and involve a little bit of 
visualization.

101
00:05:43,421 --> 00:05:46,900
So imagine that you have a child's train
on a track.

102
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:47,734
It's going round and round the track and
it's got cars on it that you can put 

103
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:52,600
things in and all the cars are full of 
things.

104
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,950
And then on the track there's a box with
cutouts.

105
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:56,803
Say That so that the train can pass 
through and on top of the blocks is a 

106
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:04,550
word and the word is things and the 
train is going through the box.

107
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:05,384
And in some sense what that would mean.
Imagine the train was long enough is 

108
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:08,954
that at any given second,
the box of things would contain 

109
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:13,940
different things,
but it would still be a box of things.

110
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,070
And a lot of words we use are like that.
Not only are they do,

111
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:22,010
they represent a heterogeneous set of 
entities,

112
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:26,030
but the set changes depending on the 
context that we use the word yet,

113
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,133
so all right,
so the reason I'm telling you that is 

114
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:30,704
because a word.
Here's another way of thinking about a 

115
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:33,344
word.

116
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,190
This will be good for you computer while
you're all computer people.

117
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:41,570
Now of course
a word is a low resolution image,

118
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,543
so you know what you think about it.
I'm worried isn't good enough 

119
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,670
approximation of the thing that it's 
representing.

120
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,533
Sort of like a thumbnail.
Now obviously one of the differences 

121
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:55,014
between the thumbnail and the real thing
is that the real thing exists at a much 

122
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,453
more,
a much higher level of resolution that 

123
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,720
exists at many,
many more layers,

124
00:07:03,721 --> 00:07:04,554
but you can use the thumbnail to 
represent it and the advantage to doing 

125
00:07:07,231 --> 00:07:08,064
that is that it doesn't take up much 
processing time and it doesn't take up 

126
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:12,564
much memory.
So lots of times you want to use the 

127
00:07:14,281 --> 00:07:17,640
shorthand for the thing rather than the 
thing because it's just too complicated.

128
00:07:17,641 --> 00:07:19,770
Otherwise and often.
Then you might say,

129
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:20,604
well,
how do you know that your shorthand 

130
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:22,883
representation is a good representation 
of the thing that you're trying to 

131
00:07:26,311 --> 00:07:28,590
represent?
And the pragmatist would say,

132
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,080
well it depends on what you want to do 
with it.

133
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,273
That that's the tool.
Like aspect say it's like if you're 

134
00:07:34,471 --> 00:07:38,670
using word x to represent potentially 
heterogeneous class,

135
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,920
why?
And when you use it,

136
00:07:40,921 --> 00:07:43,860
you get to where you want or you get 
close enough to where you want,

137
00:07:43,861 --> 00:07:47,610
then it's good enough.
So it's like it's how you know a joke is

138
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:49,590
good enough.
Well someone labs,

139
00:07:49,591 --> 00:07:52,380
it's like okay,
the joke is good enough and so.

140
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:53,933
So one of the things that's quite 
interesting about the way that you 

141
00:07:55,831 --> 00:07:56,664
interact with the world,
and this is something that pragmatists 

142
00:07:58,531 --> 00:07:59,364
really discovered in some sense,
was that you're always aiming out some 

143
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,780
bounded set of events that's somewhat 
different from the current set of events

144
00:08:06,781 --> 00:08:07,614
because otherwise you could just sit 
there and then you put your conceptions 

145
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,980
to work and your actions to work to 
manage the transformation.

146
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:17,670
And if you manage the transformation 
then it's good enough.

147
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:18,923
And that's.
You don't have to go any farther than 

148
00:08:20,341 --> 00:08:21,174
that.
So that explains partly how you can 

149
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:26,340
maneuver in the world with limited 
knowledge,

150
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,513
use low resolution representations to 
partially hit vague goals and that 

151
00:08:33,151 --> 00:08:34,630
generally gets you there.
Uh,

152
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,520
that process was called satisficing by 
now.

153
00:08:38,521 --> 00:08:39,354
What's his name?
Just extraordinarily famous economists 

154
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:42,734
and psychologists.
Anybody remember who coined the word 

155
00:08:44,851 --> 00:08:47,100
satisficing?
Economists,

156
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,090
psychologists or assignment.
That's right.

157
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:49,950
Sorry,
but thank you.

158
00:08:49,951 --> 00:08:51,480
That's exactly right.
It was herb assignment,

159
00:08:51,481 --> 00:08:52,380
so you know,
and he said,

160
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:55,080
well,
you're often not out to optimize,

161
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:57,480
let's say in a search for a partner.
Well,

162
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,373
to optimize it,
you'd have to search through several 

163
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:00,740
billion people.
It's,

164
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,480
you're not going to do that because you 
don't have the time.

165
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,460
And so then you might say,
well,

166
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,240
you don't know exactly how you do it,
but it's something like this.

167
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,733
You have five attributes that you're 
looking for and maybe to that you don't 

168
00:09:13,111 --> 00:09:14,910
know you're looking for,
but you are looking for.

169
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,840
And the first person that comes along 
that matches those well enough you pick.

170
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:23,100
And so it's not an optimization issue,
but you know,

171
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:24,990
given that you have a limited amount of 
time,

172
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,330
you can't wait around for optimized 
solutions,

173
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:32,331
you have to go ahead with sufficient and
then move to the next issue.

174
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:38,270
Okay.
So all that's a conceptual precursor for

175
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,853
taking a look at this diagram.
So we're calling someone a good person 

176
00:09:43,171 --> 00:09:45,870
and so what does it mean while we're 
going to do a bit of a micro analysis,

177
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,123
we'll assume that it's a shorthand,
low resolution representation of the 

178
00:09:49,771 --> 00:09:50,604
person and that you can decompose it.
So if someone says x is that Henry is a 

179
00:09:55,591 --> 00:09:58,260
good person and maybe he's 45,
he might say,

180
00:09:58,261 --> 00:10:00,120
does he have children?
And then you say yes,

181
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:00,954
and then you might say,
well he is he a good parent because you 

182
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:05,190
might assume that if he's a good person,
he would be a good parent.

183
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,890
Now it's conceivable that he could be a 
good parent,

184
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,690
a good person without being a good 
parent.

185
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:12,060
If he was good at like five other report
and things.

186
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:16,020
But let's assume that as a good person,
he's also a good parent.

187
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,273
I think it's reasonable to assume that 
good parent would be a subset of good 

188
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:21,120
person,
right?

189
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:21,954
Because it's more specific,
more specific means it covers less time 

190
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:30,630
and space in some sense because good 
person is a description of a person that

191
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:31,464
covers how the person interacts with the
world across the broadest possible 

192
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,370
amount of time and location and then 
good parents as well.

193
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:39,563
That's.
You find that out when they're 

194
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:42,840
interacting with children.
Let's say for the sake of argument,

195
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:44,790
there's other issues and then you might 
say,

196
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,320
well,
if he's good parent,

197
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:47,154
well,
what is he?

198
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,320
What does he have to do to be a good 
parent?

199
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,071
You might say,
well,

200
00:10:50,071 --> 00:10:50,904
yes,
to feed his children so he probably 

201
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,570
needs a job and it would be better if it
was a good job.

202
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,330
So he's got a good job and that's part 
of being a good person.

203
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,523
Um,
and then maybe he can care for his 

204
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:00,714
family.
And so care might be regarded as a more 

205
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:09,660
specific subset of good parent.
And so you can decompose care into,

206
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,050
let's say play with baby and then you 
can decompose,

207
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,860
play into while I decomposed it into 
peak tickle and clean.

208
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,790
And then what's interesting about this 
is that those are all abstractions,

209
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,120
but once you get down to a high enough 
level of resolution,

210
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:24,954
they're no longer abstractions in that 
there are actually options that you 

211
00:11:27,361 --> 00:11:30,420
undertake in the world.
Moving your hand is not an abstraction.

212
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,003
So at some point,
and this is a nice elegant solution to 

213
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:38,160
the mind body problem to some degree at 
some level of resolution,

214
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:38,994
high resolution,
it stops being conceptual and starts 

215
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:44,160
being action and that's where the mind 
hits the world.

216
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,233
And then I'm like,
if you go into an even higher level of 

217
00:11:47,161 --> 00:11:47,994
resolution than that,
like what do you have to do in order to 

218
00:11:50,191 --> 00:11:53,190
move your hand?
The answer to that is you don't know.

219
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:56,740
You just do it.
And so your consciousness bottoms out in

220
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:59,260
some sense at the level of voluntary 
motor activity.

221
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,483
So there's a level above which you 
cannot perceive which are the networks 

222
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,014
that you're involved in.
And there's a level below which you 

223
00:12:07,331 --> 00:12:11,170
can't perceive,
which is under normal circumstances,

224
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,053
perceive our control,
which is whatever it enables you to 

225
00:12:13,871 --> 00:12:16,090
actually move.
So all right,

226
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:20,050
so then you might say,
well what are all of these things?

227
00:12:20,051 --> 00:12:24,100
These like how would you conceptualize?
I decomposed good person,

228
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:25,263
but then you might say,
well what are all these things made out 

229
00:12:26,891 --> 00:12:27,960
of?
In a sense,

230
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,160
what are their constituent elements?
Good person,

231
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,770
good parent family care,
play with baby.

232
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,290
They're sort of like games.
They're sort of like stories.

233
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:38,980
They're sort of like rituals.
I think about them in these terms.

234
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:39,903
So if you look at,
that's where we get to this particular 

235
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,193
diagram,
which we're going to concentrate on 

236
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:49,060
quite a bit.
So let me shift to it and then we'll,

237
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,440
we'll,
we'll talk about that.

238
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,280
No,
I don't exactly know how to.

239
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:26,263
What to call this thing.
I think the best way of thinking about 

240
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,124
it is that it's a subpersonality and 
that the reason I call it a sub 

241
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,753
personalities,
because only a personality has all the 

242
00:13:37,431 --> 00:13:40,490
attributes that this thing has.
And so the attributes are.

243
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,623
It's something I talked to you last week
about the fact that the Russian 

244
00:13:43,641 --> 00:13:45,170
neuropsychologist,
for example,

245
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,090
felt that people had to build models of 
the world and and so you could call this

246
00:13:50,091 --> 00:13:50,924
a model of the world,
but and so the reason they suspected 

247
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:57,180
that was because if you brought someone 
in,

248
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,273
I think I ran through this.
If you bring someone into a laboratory 

249
00:13:59,901 --> 00:14:00,734
and you play them a tone when they first
hear the tone and they manifest and 

250
00:14:03,561 --> 00:14:05,290
orienting reflex,
which is a change,

251
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,223
a change in skin conductance,
and that's actually a consequence of 

252
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,780
neurological activity,
and then if you play the tone of bunch,

253
00:14:11,781 --> 00:14:12,614
they stop having that reaction and then 
if you vary the tone on any perceptible 

254
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:22,100
dimension,
the orienting reflex returns,

255
00:14:22,101 --> 00:14:22,934
and so the inference from that was all 
obviously the the person must be 

256
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:29,383
constructing a model of the tone because
otherwise how would they know if 

257
00:14:32,931 --> 00:14:34,130
something deviated from it?

258
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,380
Especially on all those dimensions.
So not only is it,

259
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,160
not only is it a model,
it's a multidimensional model.

260
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,930
Okay.
Now,

261
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,183
the upshot of that was that for a long 
time people tried to figure out how in 

262
00:14:45,891 --> 00:14:46,724
the world we modeled the world and then 
they also tried to make smart machines 

263
00:14:49,671 --> 00:14:50,504
that modeled the world,
that could then plan their actions in 

264
00:14:53,181 --> 00:14:54,014
the world and then could act in the 
world as a consequence and they got 

265
00:14:56,811 --> 00:14:57,644
nowhere with that because it turned out 
that the world is so damn complex that 

266
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:01,783
if you're going to model it,
you're going to spend all your time 

267
00:15:03,711 --> 00:15:05,530
modeling.
You're not going to spend anytime acting

268
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:06,364
in and you're not going to get anywhere,
and it's partly because the world is 

269
00:15:09,081 --> 00:15:09,914
almost infinitely complex.
And so if you're trying to get a 

270
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:13,880
computer to look at the world,
you might say,

271
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:14,714
well,
what is the computer supposed to look 

272
00:15:16,521 --> 00:15:17,354
at?

273
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,400
Everything?
Well,

274
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,323
no,
I mean you look at a lot in some ways 

275
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:27,560
and not very much in others and half 
your brain is dedicated roughly speaking

276
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:29,000
to visual process.
You know,

277
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:31,790
and then you've got your other senses to
help you figure out what's going on.

278
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:34,190
But you don't build a model of the whole
world.

279
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,233
You don't build any model alone at all 
of the parts of the world that aren't 

280
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:39,170
relevant to you.
So for example,

281
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:42,530
you're a model of this floor is very low
resolution.

282
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:43,364
If I took you guys out in the hallway,
assuming the hallway floor isn't the 

283
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,750
same color,
and I said,

284
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:50,630
what was the color of this floor?
You would not be able to tell me.

285
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:51,883
And the reason for that is who cares?
It could be shifting color all the time 

286
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:55,820
while you're sitting here,
you know,

287
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,010
suddenly and you're not going to care.

288
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:01,040
And the reason for that is you're not 
falling through it and it isn't moving.

289
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,310
And so it's like an invisible 
presupposition of your,

290
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,640
of your current knowledge structure.
And there's all sorts of things going on

291
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:08,690
around you that are like,
that.

292
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,673
You don't pay attention to the walls,
you really don't pay attention to the 

293
00:16:12,231 --> 00:16:13,880
people that are around you.
You know,

294
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:15,890
they could start themselves in a 
different way.

295
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,170
You wouldn't notice unless you know the 
person.

296
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,333
Um,
there's all sorts of things that you 

297
00:16:20,691 --> 00:16:21,524
don't model.
Now you've all seen the invisible 

298
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:26,420
gorilla video,
I presume everyone seen that hasn't?

299
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,283
No.
Is there anyone here who hasn't seen 

300
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:30,560
that video?
Okay,

301
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:31,910
good.
So that's something a.

302
00:16:31,911 --> 00:16:32,744
I mean it's really something that.
There's this psychology experiment 

303
00:16:34,371 --> 00:16:35,204
that's so well known.
You can talk to a crowd now and almost 

304
00:16:36,891 --> 00:16:39,020
everyone's seen it.
It's so shocking.

305
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:39,854
It's like,
of course I would see a gorilla if one 

306
00:16:41,271 --> 00:16:43,280
was dancing around on the basketball 
court.

307
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,200
It's like,
Huh?

308
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,051
No,
you wouldn't.

309
00:16:45,051 --> 00:16:46,910
Or there's a 50 percent chance you 
wouldn't.

310
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,133
Now,
the reason for that is fundamentally 

311
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:50,894
speaking is that your given a task when 
when you watch that video and the task 

312
00:16:56,061 --> 00:16:56,894
is to count the number of times the ball
was thrown by the team in black and so 

313
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,743
all of a sudden your perceptual systems 
reorient themselves and you're actually 

314
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:06,434
not really looking at people.
You're looking at something that might 

315
00:17:08,691 --> 00:17:09,524
be like animated stick figures who are,
who are engaged momentarily and moving 

316
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:19,271
the object of of perceptual importance 
around and so you can blur them out,

317
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,253
which you do because obviously you can't
tell the difference between a gorilla 

318
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:28,490
and the person dressed in black and the 
reason you can't is you don't need to in

319
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:29,324
order to fulfill the task.
You can treat all the people like 

320
00:17:32,181 --> 00:17:33,014
vaguely moving black objects and as long
as that doesn't interfere with your 

321
00:17:36,861 --> 00:17:40,070
counting,
then it's irrelevant and so actually you

322
00:17:40,071 --> 00:17:40,904
don't build a model of the whole world 
and you build a model of only the parts 

323
00:17:45,171 --> 00:17:48,560
of the world that are irrelevant to your
ongoing microaction.

324
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:52,950
Now the problem that brings up is how do
you know what's relevant and.

325
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:53,880
Well,
that's a much.

326
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:58,500
That's a tough question and I would say 
the reason that you know what's relevant

327
00:17:58,501 --> 00:17:59,334
is because some things don't change over
time and you've been evolving through 

328
00:18:03,571 --> 00:18:07,860
three and a half billion years,
so you've built yourself.

329
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,903
If we go back to that other diagram,
you imagine the levels there from the 

330
00:18:12,001 --> 00:18:16,890
micro activities to the abstractions.
You think about how much building had to

331
00:18:16,891 --> 00:18:19,410
go in before you can undertake those 
micro actions,

332
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:22,770
so like here you can move your hand.
Well that's great.

333
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:25,260
How do you get the hand?
Well,

334
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,050
you know,
it took a long time.

335
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,003
It took almost all of the three and a 
half billion years before he managed to 

336
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,630
come up with a hand.
So even underneath the,

337
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,873
the micro-actions,
there's this massive evolutionary 

338
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:40,524
history that's been built up partly as a
consequence of some of the unchanging 

339
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:45,294
features of the environment or at least 
in consequence of some of the slower 

340
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:49,644
changing features of the environment 
that has given you this incredibly 

341
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:53,544
complex body that's really good at doing
some things and not very good at doing 

342
00:18:56,341 --> 00:18:57,270
other things at all.

343
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,420
And so that's how you solve the 
relevance problem.

344
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,553
And I actually think it's one of the 
most powerful arguments for the 

345
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:05,844
necessity of evolutionary theory.
It's like this problem is so complex 

346
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:10,643
because it's not only do you have to 
adapt to the environment across time so 

347
00:19:13,141 --> 00:19:15,300
you don't have to build a body that 
adapts to the environment.

348
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,493
It's worse than that.
It's like the train passing through the 

349
00:19:18,181 --> 00:19:20,700
box,
the environment's not stable,

350
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,170
it keeps shifting and turning and moving
and twisting and so not only do you have

351
00:19:25,171 --> 00:19:26,004
to adapt to the environment,
you have to adapt flexibly to the 

352
00:19:28,561 --> 00:19:32,370
environment while it transforms itself 
at different levels of,

353
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,413
of,
of what would you say at different 

354
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:36,564
levels of totality,
because sometimes there's minor changes 

355
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,344
in the environment.
Sometimes you know a meteor hits the 

356
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:42,864
earth and you know,
were plunged into darkness for four 

357
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,560
years or there's an ice age or something
like that.

358
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,393
So the levels of transformation in the 
environment can be radical and the 

359
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:53,250
evolutionary process has to keep up with
that.

360
00:19:53,251 --> 00:19:57,060
And the way it works apparently like I 
don't believe this is the whole story,

361
00:19:57,061 --> 00:19:57,894
although it's more or less the whole 
Darwinian story is that something more 

362
00:20:01,711 --> 00:20:02,544
or less works and that makes a million 
copies of itself and there's tiny 

363
00:20:05,611 --> 00:20:06,444
variations in those copies often at 
least in principle because of copying 

364
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:12,300
error,
which is where I think the theories week

365
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:16,380
and then they all die except like two.
And so why didn't those die?

366
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,490
And their answer is,
well,

367
00:20:17,491 --> 00:20:18,324
they happened by chance to very in the 
direction that the environment varied 

368
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,733
and so they get to continue.
And so the reason evolution works is 

369
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:28,710
because everything dies,
everything fails.

370
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,270
So because he's saying,
well,

371
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:33,210
keeping up with a randomly changing 
environment is impossible.

372
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,413
Well,
so how do you do it while you do a 

373
00:20:35,821 --> 00:20:36,600
million things?

374
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,433
Most of them don't work and,
but you only have to succeed enough to 

375
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:41,574
propagate yourself once.
So now I think that that's not exactly 

376
00:20:46,321 --> 00:20:50,320
right because I don't believe that our 
understanding of evolution is complete.

377
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,333
There's a bunch of reasons I don't 
believe that one is DNA is pretty damn 

378
00:20:54,971 --> 00:20:55,804
complex.
It's not obvious how it could have 

379
00:20:56,771 --> 00:20:59,920
evolved.
And even the people who discovered DNA,

380
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:00,754
we're very,
very perplexed by the fact that it 

381
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:03,610
existed.
So one of them,

382
00:21:03,611 --> 00:21:04,444
and I told you this,
thought that it came from outer space 

383
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,200
and it involved somewhere else.
You know,

384
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:09,034
and you know,
you might think about that as a crazy 

385
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:14,350
theory,
but I'm cosmic winds,

386
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:17,380
solar winds and that sort of thing can 
propel tiny things.

387
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:22,360
Vast distances rep relatively rapidly.
And over 13 point 5 billion years,

388
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:26,380
you can really get around.
I think the estimates if even if you use

389
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,243
sub,
if you use transportation methods that 

390
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:31,054
are about the speed that we have,
you could call a nice the whole galaxy 

391
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:34,024
and some like 20 million years,
something like that because it's 

392
00:21:35,681 --> 00:21:36,514
exponential.

393
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:37,623
So 20 million years is a tiny,
tiny subset of three point 5 billion 

394
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:43,750
years.
So it's not as far fetched as it sounds.

395
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:46,000
The problem is it doesn't address the 
problem which is yeah.

396
00:21:46,001 --> 00:21:47,350
Okay.
It came from somewhere else.

397
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:48,760
But how did they get there?
Right.

398
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:51,820
It just pushes the problem back.
But there's this other issue too,

399
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:54,760
which is called MPG genesis Epi,
genesis,

400
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:55,863
and that's really put old spoke in the 
scientific wheels in the last 20 years 

401
00:21:58,841 --> 00:21:59,674
because the theory was 20 years ago that
all evolution proceeded through random 

402
00:22:05,081 --> 00:22:07,660
mutation and it was random.
Right.

403
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:10,700
But it turns out that's not exactly 
right because there are,

404
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,590
there have been a number of 
demonstrations that if something happens

405
00:22:14,591 --> 00:22:15,424
to generation a that will produce a 
transformation in the genetic 

406
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:23,110
information that's transferred to to,
to a generation b.

407
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:28,060
and the transformation often seems not,
not merely a consequence of damage,

408
00:22:28,061 --> 00:22:31,540
but actually a form of adaptation to the
new environment.

409
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,950
So now that's a tough one,
you know,

410
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,033
because when I,
20 years ago when I was studying 

411
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,240
evolutionary psychology and evolutionary
biology,

412
00:22:40,241 --> 00:22:41,074
if someone would have said what you can,
you can transmit acquired 

413
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:45,723
characteristics,
it would've been like a year over there 

414
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:50,350
with the creationists because that was,
that was no goal,

415
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,260
that was against the rules.
But it does happen.

416
00:22:53,261 --> 00:22:54,094
And the fact that EPA genesis happens at
all means that there's a lot of things 

417
00:22:57,191 --> 00:23:01,690
about how DNA works that we don't know.
And I actually think what's happening is

418
00:23:01,691 --> 00:23:02,524
that the DNA is a very,
very complex microcomputer and I don't 

419
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:09,850
know exactly how it operates,
but maybe it's a quantum computer.

420
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,043
It's very complex.
Remember it's had three and a half 

421
00:23:12,401 --> 00:23:14,140
billion years to figure out what's going
on.

422
00:23:14,141 --> 00:23:16,720
So like,
and it's pretty good at surviving.

423
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,460
So you don't want to underestimate it.

424
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:23,460
And the structures that builds at the 
molecular level are so complex.

425
00:23:23,921 --> 00:23:25,030
It just,
if you,

426
00:23:25,031 --> 00:23:25,864
if you.
There's some great animations of those 

427
00:23:27,251 --> 00:23:29,230
things going on,
a molecular level on the net.

428
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:33,700
They're so complex that you can't help 
but think of the mess computational when

429
00:23:33,701 --> 00:23:36,030
you watch them,
they're not random processes.

430
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,873
Mad like I watched the little molecule 
that checks for error in a DNA 

431
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:42,454
replication string.
I mean it checks for in DNA replication 

432
00:23:46,881 --> 00:23:51,740
string man out of how to figure out how 
it does something like that without some

433
00:23:51,741 --> 00:23:54,860
form of computation strikes me as 
impossible anyways.

434
00:23:54,861 --> 00:23:55,694
I think what happens is that overtime 
the DNA plays like it can manifest 

435
00:23:59,391 --> 00:24:03,440
itself in many different forms and it 
also capitalizes on mutation.

436
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,070
I think that's how it works.
Now you know there's other,

437
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:12,500
I'd say kind of weak evidence for that.
Maybe it's only evidenced by analogy,

438
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:16,760
but if I take one of you and I put you 
in a radically new environment,

439
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,013
new genes will turn on in your brain and
code for new proteins and so it's like 

440
00:24:21,351 --> 00:24:24,170
you're sitting there,
but in some sense there's a whole set of

441
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,033
potential use that are sitting there and
a lot of that potential is actually 

442
00:24:28,521 --> 00:24:30,020
locked in the genetic code.

443
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,960
I mean,
it's dependent on the information that's

444
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:35,540
in the environment around it because 
it's not all in the code,

445
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,490
but it's enough to get the process 
started.

446
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,460
So if I take you out of situation a and 
put you in situation,

447
00:24:40,461 --> 00:24:43,820
be you build new brain structures at the
micro level,

448
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:46,620
so you're actually a different person 
and you know,

449
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,473
that's a very interesting way of 
thinking about the consequences of 

450
00:24:49,581 --> 00:24:51,590
something like exposure in 
psychotherapy.

451
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:52,431
It's like,
okay,

452
00:24:52,431 --> 00:24:55,310
you're all timid and there's eight,
18 things you're terrified of.

453
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:57,410
And so you go out and you master one of 
them.

454
00:24:57,411 --> 00:24:59,960
It's like Poof,
your brain is not the same,

455
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,300
so maybe now you're a little braver and 
then you know,

456
00:25:02,301 --> 00:25:05,030
you go master another one in the bunch 
more of you turns on.

457
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:09,590
Now I don't know if when one thing turns
on something else,

458
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,820
turns off,
you know,

459
00:25:10,821 --> 00:25:11,654
if it's,
you know what I mean is that there's 

460
00:25:12,681 --> 00:25:15,110
only so much of you that can be turned 
on at any one time,

461
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,243
but,
but maybe a lot more of you could be 

462
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:22,810
turned on then is turned on.
So I think,

463
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,713
you know,
it looks like that because people who 

464
00:25:25,031 --> 00:25:27,580
really challenged themselves across the 
span of their life,

465
00:25:27,581 --> 00:25:29,920
they develop talents in multiple 
directions,

466
00:25:29,921 --> 00:25:33,310
you know,
people can really be amazingly good at a

467
00:25:33,311 --> 00:25:35,770
ridiculous number of things.
So.

468
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:39,670
Okay,
so

469
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,083
Sokolov and vinegar over the show,
spinnaker Nova showed that you modeled 

470
00:25:47,061 --> 00:25:49,010
the world right down to the finest 
detail.

471
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:53,660
But then Dan Simon and his crew showed 
that no,

472
00:25:53,661 --> 00:25:54,494
you don't.
You're so blind that you can't even 

473
00:25:55,911 --> 00:25:56,721
believe it.
It's like,

474
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,780
okay,
those are not the same set of facts.

475
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,110
So how do we reconcile that?
Okay,

476
00:26:03,111 --> 00:26:06,380
well here's one way of getting up a bit 
of a sense of it.

477
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:09,680
Look straight ahead,
okay?

478
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:13,730
Now concentrate not on what you see in 
the middle of your vision,

479
00:26:13,731 --> 00:26:17,330
but in this side's probably better if 
you look at a person to do that.

480
00:26:17,331 --> 00:26:20,520
Doesn't really matter though.
So look at straight ahead but,

481
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,820
but pay attention to what you see in the
periphery.

482
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,040
Okay?
So I can tell you what,

483
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:26,930
why,
what you'll see,

484
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,800
because some of it's very difficult to 
detect way out in the periphery.

485
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,040
It's black and white.
You can't tell that though,

486
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:37,790
but we know that because if we change 
colors way out in the periphery on you,

487
00:26:37,791 --> 00:26:41,060
you can't detect the change and then out
to about here,

488
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:44,070
if something isn't moving,
it's almost impossible

489
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,540
to see it,
but as soon as it moves,

490
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,400
you can see that there's something 
moving,

491
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,790
sort of like dinosaur vision.
You remember?

492
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:50,893
Um,
drastic park don't move because the 

493
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:55,080
dinosaur can see you.
It's like,

494
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,273
well,
you have dinosaur movement detector 

495
00:26:57,901 --> 00:27:01,230
still built into your nervous system and
the question is why?

496
00:27:01,231 --> 00:27:02,400
And the answer is,
well,

497
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:03,893
if you can't afford to have a lot of 
your brain wired up to the periphery of 

498
00:27:08,161 --> 00:27:10,260
your vision because your head is only so
big,

499
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,363
then you have to concentrate on 
detecting only those things that are 

500
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,093
most likely to be relevant and moving.
Things are more likely to be relevant 

501
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,203
because they can eat you moving.
Things are more likely to be relevant 

502
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:21,624
than stationary things.
Especially if you've been in an 

503
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,560
environment for awhile.
Right?

504
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:26,880
Because if you're in here,
it's like,

505
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:27,743
well,
the stationary things are going to stay 

506
00:27:28,561 --> 00:27:30,780
stationary so you can ignore them.

507
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,510
You don't even have to see them,
but the moving things,

508
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,720
while they're transforming at a time 
rate that's relevant to you,

509
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,610
and so it's good to be able to detect 
those.

510
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:43,410
Now the periphery of your vision is 
actually wired in more directly to your,

511
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:44,843
to your,
to the lower levels of your nervous 

512
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:46,944
system,
so it can trigger off things like 

513
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,030
startle reflexes,
which are very rapid.

514
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,240
And it also triggers an orienting 
response,

515
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:55,074
which is the movement of your sensory 
systems in the direction of the 

516
00:27:57,661 --> 00:28:00,120
stimulus.
So if something over here moves,

517
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,253
then you go like that.
And then what you're doing is you're 

518
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,550
nailing it with your central vision.
Now,

519
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:06,384
out in your peripheral vision,
if you follow the optical track back to 

520
00:28:09,331 --> 00:28:14,331
your brain and you'll see that the 
peripheral retinal nerves don't attached

521
00:28:14,571 --> 00:28:17,820
to a tremendous number of visual cortex 
neurons,

522
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:21,960
but the central ones do so each of the 
central neurons in your,

523
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,273
in your,
uh,

524
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,730
central vision,
the follow via,

525
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:25,703
each one of those is connected to 10,000
neurons at the first level of 

526
00:28:28,951 --> 00:28:29,790
elaboration.

527
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,390
And then each neuron is connected to 
about 10,000 other neurons.

528
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,433
So it's 10,000 to the 10 thousands,
two neurons in and so a lot of your 

529
00:28:38,941 --> 00:28:42,960
brain is focusing on that tiny little 
pinpoint that you use.

530
00:28:42,961 --> 00:28:47,280
That's full vision and it seems to be 
about big enough so that you can.

531
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:48,223
You can bring a face into high 
resolution in the center and you can 

532
00:28:51,241 --> 00:28:53,910
track the movements of the various 
elements of the faces.

533
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,163
If you.
If you look at someone and you look 

534
00:28:56,071 --> 00:28:58,860
about 18 inches to their left or to the 
right,

535
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,410
you'll see that you can't see their nose
anymore.

536
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:05,370
You see a kind of a vague outline of 
their face.

537
00:29:05,371 --> 00:29:06,204
You can still see the color,
you can detect their eyebrows and you 

538
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:12,000
can detect their mouth,
especially if their mouth moves or their

539
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:14,160
eyes move.
You just zero in on that right away.

540
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,383
And again,
so what's happening is that way out 

541
00:29:17,071 --> 00:29:17,904
here,
You're vision is incredibly low 

542
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:23,880
resolution and then the resolution 
increases to the center where it's very,

543
00:29:23,881 --> 00:29:27,780
very high and you and but.
And then there's some tweaks like,

544
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:29,370
okay,
you can't really see out here,

545
00:29:29,371 --> 00:29:30,204
but you can see motion and that's good 
enough because as soon as something 

546
00:29:32,641 --> 00:29:33,474
moves,
you can turn your head because you can 

547
00:29:34,291 --> 00:29:38,340
turn your head and your eyes and then 
you can focus that little pinpoint on it

548
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,950
and dance around because that's what you
do with the pinpoint.

549
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:46,030
It moves around very rapidly and then 
you can scan that central area with,

550
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,133
with high resolution.
And so it's an efficient use of limited 

551
00:29:49,451 --> 00:29:51,130
resources.
So,

552
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:54,850
so partly the way that you manage in the
world,

553
00:29:54,851 --> 00:29:56,230
which is very,
very complicated,

554
00:29:56,231 --> 00:29:59,290
is that even your senses simplify it for
you.

555
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,700
You know,
there's only.

556
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:05,170
You can't see the entire spectrum of 
electromagnetic radiation.

557
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,820
You can only see the visual light 
spectrum.

558
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:07,654
It's very narrow.
There's a whole range of sounds you 

559
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:11,800
can't hear.
There's things you can't smell.

560
00:30:11,801 --> 00:30:12,634
So you know,
you're in a box and some things get 

561
00:30:14,741 --> 00:30:15,640
through,
but not everything.

562
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,310
So that simplifies things for you right 
off the bat.

563
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:19,683
And you know,
hypothetically those things you do 

564
00:30:20,981 --> 00:30:21,814
detect where those things that it was 
necessary for you to detect for you to 

565
00:30:24,401 --> 00:30:28,540
be here over this vast span of time and 
no doubt there were variants all the way

566
00:30:28,541 --> 00:30:30,580
through that tried to parse it up 
differently,

567
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,250
slightly differently and that didn't 
work out as well.

568
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:37,840
So they aren't around.
So you're around because of this,

569
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,180
of death and replication so that,
you know,

570
00:30:40,181 --> 00:30:41,014
it's an interesting take on debt thing 
because you're the product of an 

571
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:48,250
unbelievable number of deaths,
right?

572
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:52,690
Because all of those experiments have to
take place in some sense for there to be

573
00:30:52,691 --> 00:30:54,670
you to,
for you to be here at all.

574
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,590
So anyways.
Okay.

575
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,053
Then.
So you can see with your central vision 

576
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:02,734
that you're focusing on one point and 
then you reduce the others too to low 

577
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,980
resolution representations,
maybe even cartoons.

578
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,233
And then I also think,
although I don't know this for sure in 

579
00:31:11,831 --> 00:31:15,130
someone has undoubtedly done the work.
My suspicions are,

580
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:18,460
is that in the periphery you don't 
update,

581
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,270
you know how your screen updates 60 
cycles a second,

582
00:31:22,271 --> 00:31:23,104
something like that.
You updated your vision at about 60 

583
00:31:25,391 --> 00:31:26,224
cycles per second,
and we know that because if the screen 

584
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,530
resolution or if the screen update 
decreases below 60 cycles a second,

585
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:36,220
people can start to see it flicker,
so we have a refresh rate.

586
00:31:36,221 --> 00:31:40,330
It's around 60 hertz and some people can
see flicker at higher

587
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,110
and higher hertz the nap,
but,

588
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,280
but most people can't.

589
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:50,280
Sixty is about right,
so that's another way that you deal with

590
00:31:50,681 --> 00:31:53,780
the fact that there's way too much for 
you to deal with your.

591
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,020
Your temporal resolution isn't very 
high,

592
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:59,260
you know,
so the smallest meaningful event for you

593
00:31:59,261 --> 00:32:00,094
is about a 10th of a second long.
Now it's if you're in a car accident or 

594
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:06,880
you're in some situation where it's an 
emergency and you get a massive burst of

595
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:07,714
dopamine,
you might be able to speed that process 

596
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,440
up by 100 fold.
Who knows,

597
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:14,710
but you're going to be absolutely 
exhausted instantly when you do that.

598
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,100
I don't know if you've ever experienced 
that in a car accident or something like

599
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:18,934
that,
but people often report that time slows 

600
00:32:21,131 --> 00:32:25,720
down dramatically and but then 
afterwards they're just there.

601
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,793
They're done.
So the reason you don't see a thousand 

602
00:32:29,201 --> 00:32:32,470
times as fast as you do is because you'd
have to be eating like a Hummingbird,

603
00:32:32,471 --> 00:32:34,750
right?
You need a big Vat of nectar attached to

604
00:32:34,751 --> 00:32:38,290
you and you'd be just sipping on it,
are gulping it down nonstop.

605
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,870
So you're kind of restricted in terms of
your temporal resolution.

606
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,283
Okay.
Well then what else do you do to 

607
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:48,260
simplify the world?

608
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:49,323
Well,

609
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,580
this is where the tool concept of

610
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,810
concept,
the two old concept of concept starts to

611
00:32:57,811 --> 00:33:02,700
become useful because you're actually 
aiming at things all the time.

612
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,713
And I really liked the aim metaphor 
because if you understand the metaphor 

613
00:33:07,351 --> 00:33:08,184
well,
it really shed some light on what human 

614
00:33:09,871 --> 00:33:13,110
beings are like.
Chimps are hunters,

615
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,840
but they're not hunters,
like human beings are hunters,

616
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,520
were really,
really good hunters.

617
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,773
Chimps.
They have to kind of mob an animal and 

618
00:33:20,011 --> 00:33:21,510
then they'll tear it apart and they 
liked.

619
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,580
They liked me,
so they'll definitely do it.

620
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:24,803
But human beings have been hunting and 
an unbelievably sophisticated way for a 

621
00:33:27,661 --> 00:33:28,494
tremendous amount of time.
And there's a bunch of things about us 

622
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:32,483
that aren't like chimps.
So one is we can throw and our bodies 

623
00:33:36,661 --> 00:33:38,580
are built for throwing.
Now you might think,

624
00:33:38,581 --> 00:33:39,414
well that's not that relevant,
but if something is chasing you through 

625
00:33:41,131 --> 00:33:41,964
the Bush and you can throw a rock at it,
it becomes relevant very quickly and so 

626
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:50,481
we're really good at taking projectiles,
specifying targets and hurling,

627
00:33:50,941 --> 00:33:54,480
the projectiles out targets,
and we can do that with rocks and we can

628
00:33:54,481 --> 00:33:55,314
do it with bows and we can do it with 
rifles and we can do it with nuclear 

629
00:33:58,861 --> 00:33:59,694
weapons.

630
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:00,683
And so there's something about us that's
obsessed with hitting the middle of the 

631
00:34:03,031 --> 00:34:08,031
target.
Now there's an interesting side note for

632
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:08,874
that,
which is that the word sin is derived 

633
00:34:11,131 --> 00:34:15,510
from the Greek word Hamartia and 
Hamartia is an archery term.

634
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,910
That means to miss the center of the 
target.

635
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:21,360
So now that's something very much we're 
thinking about.

636
00:34:21,361 --> 00:34:22,194
It's a very lovely concordance.
And so we're built on this hunting 

637
00:34:25,411 --> 00:34:26,244
platform.
We can track moving things 

638
00:34:27,151 --> 00:34:29,940
extraordinarily well.
We have the amazing eyesight,

639
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,313
our eyesight's better than any primate 
by a huge amount and better than any 

640
00:34:34,051 --> 00:34:36,810
other creature except for like hawks and
other birds of prey.

641
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,270
So,
and we also you,

642
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,413
so we have this amazing capacity to zero
in and here's some cool things about 

643
00:34:44,011 --> 00:34:46,560
your eyes.
So if you look at a gorilla,

644
00:34:46,561 --> 00:34:47,394
you'll see that a gorilla doesn't really
have whites in their eyes and you might 

645
00:34:50,251 --> 00:34:52,260
think,
well that's kind of weird because we do.

646
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,900
And so what's the hypothesis?
Well,

647
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,630
if I'm looking at somebody at the back 
of the room,

648
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:01,020
I can tell if they're looking at my 
eyes,

649
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,780
if they're looking at my nose,
it's,

650
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,633
it's almost as if their face just gets a
little bit vaguer like we're not 

651
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,163
communicating.
It's either icontact and so our ability 

652
00:35:09,721 --> 00:35:10,554
to specify the direction in which 
another person's eyes are pointing is 

653
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,610
phenomenal.
And you might say,

654
00:35:17,611 --> 00:35:18,444
well,
why?

655
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,890
Well,
first of all,

656
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,800
there's a lot of expression around the 
eyes,

657
00:35:22,801 --> 00:35:23,634
right?
So you can imagine a coevolution the 

658
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,150
coevolution is sharper and sharper 
vision,

659
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,733
vision associated with detecting eyes.
And then also more and more evolution 

660
00:35:32,611 --> 00:35:33,444
for,
for emotional expression around the 

661
00:35:34,861 --> 00:35:36,780
eyes.
So there's that.

662
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,483
But then

663
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,640
the other thing that I wanted,
the reason that I would be interested in

664
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:45,690
that is because I want to know what the 
hell you're up to because maybe you're a

665
00:35:45,691 --> 00:35:46,524
friend and maybe you're full or maybe 
you're interested in something that I 

666
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:51,960
should be interested in and so we know 
what people are like in that regard.

667
00:35:51,961 --> 00:35:56,640
So you go stand out on the corner and 
you look up and soon there are 10 people

668
00:35:56,641 --> 00:35:59,400
gathered around you looking at and why 
is that?

669
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:04,640
It's because when they see where your 
eyes are pointed and embody you,

670
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,361
they think,
well,

671
00:36:06,361 --> 00:36:07,740
that person,
they don't think this.

672
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:10,440
It's the equivalent of thinking.
They think,

673
00:36:10,441 --> 00:36:12,060
well,
that person must be looking at something

674
00:36:12,061 --> 00:36:15,720
interesting because that's what people 
look at and if it's interesting to them,

675
00:36:15,721 --> 00:36:17,580
then it's probably going to be 
interesting to me.

676
00:36:17,581 --> 00:36:19,020
Especially if it's in the sky.

677
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,720
It's like what the hell?
That's not supposed to be happening.

678
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,410
So you're looking at people's eyes 
because you want to know what they're up

679
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:26,243
to in their facial display,
which is your face is unbelievably 

680
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,383
innervated and controllable both by 
conscious and unconscious means that 

681
00:36:33,781 --> 00:36:34,614
tells you what they're up to,
which is why you want to see someone's 

682
00:36:36,721 --> 00:36:37,554
face.
You don't talk to the back of their 

683
00:36:38,431 --> 00:36:39,264
head,
you want to talk to their face and you 

684
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:43,140
don't like it when they're looking like 
this or looking like that.

685
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,123
Or failing to make eye contact,
although too much eye contact as a 

686
00:36:46,921 --> 00:36:48,790
predatory stair.
So you know,

687
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:51,690
well you got.
You got to get the balance right.

688
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:55,590
So now what about the whites of the 
eyes?

689
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:56,424
Well,
the theory is is that the reason we 

690
00:36:57,241 --> 00:36:58,074
developed the whites is because it was 
easier to see where someone's eyes were 

691
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:01,020
appointed.

692
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,180
If there was a dark circle in a white 
space.

693
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,620
And what that basically meant was that 
all your ancestors who are a little less

694
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,813
fortunate on the white side either 
didn't mate or got killed probably 

695
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,500
misunderstandings.
So,

696
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,473
so rois are.
I stand out against this bright white 

697
00:37:18,691 --> 00:37:19,524
background because that helps us,
that helps other people detect what 

698
00:37:22,231 --> 00:37:23,064
we're up to and that means we can trust 
each other more easily and we can even 

699
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,263
something as simple as like eye contact 
in a situation where there's a 

700
00:37:31,171 --> 00:37:32,004
possibility of finding a sexual partners
is a very important component of that 

701
00:37:35,611 --> 00:37:40,320
because I contact indicates interest and
it also indicates at least in principle,

702
00:37:40,321 --> 00:37:43,830
the possibility of approach.
And so approaches,

703
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:44,683
uh,
this dopaminergic Lee mediated and it's 

704
00:37:47,071 --> 00:37:47,904
a positive emotional state.
And that's also why interestingly 

705
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:52,950
enough,
if you go into a grocery,

706
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,813
into a pharmacy and there's a rock of 
magazines and there what's on the cover 

707
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,970
always almost always beautiful woman.

708
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,910
Like on 50 percent of the men's 
magazines,

709
00:38:05,911 --> 00:38:09,180
there's a beautiful woman and knowing 
100 percent of the women's magazines,

710
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,050
which is really interesting,
you know,

711
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,230
because you might think,
well why is that?

712
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,333
Well,
and the woman's eyes are always looking 

713
00:38:15,721 --> 00:38:17,580
out in a way that they're looking at 
you.

714
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:23,240
So there was some interest.
So it's an invocation of interest.

715
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,570
And so,
you know,

716
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,450
magazines evolve,
all the ones that don't get bought fail.

717
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:28,763
And so what's happened is they all 
converge to the same point in the same 

718
00:38:30,961 --> 00:38:35,500
point is the thing that's maximally 
interesting to a magazine purchaser

719
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,820
is a fee is a beautiful female face,
whether it's male or female.

720
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,700
Now on the male side,
just also gadgets of all sorts.

721
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:44,223
So,
and that may be because men are more 

722
00:38:45,371 --> 00:38:48,550
gadget oriented than women.
So anyways,

723
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,940
and we also know that for example,
with men,

724
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,940
if you show them this is a funny little 
study,

725
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:00,400
so you show them a view of the face of a
beautiful woman and her eyes are looking

726
00:39:00,401 --> 00:39:03,310
that way or this way,
or they're looking right at him.

727
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:04,443
You can check the activity and the 
dopaminergic center in a place called 

728
00:39:07,391 --> 00:39:08,224
the nucleus accumbens,
which is the same place that cocaine 

729
00:39:09,791 --> 00:39:12,820
hits face on,
I contact that thing,

730
00:39:12,821 --> 00:39:13,654
lights up,
it lights up even more if she's wearing 

731
00:39:15,281 --> 00:39:17,560
a red dress,
right?

732
00:39:17,561 --> 00:39:20,530
And you can get the same kind of 
lighting up with a red,

733
00:39:20,531 --> 00:39:23,320
curvy sportscar.
So it's the,

734
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,470
you know,
my,

735
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,630
my,
my thought would,

736
00:39:25,631 --> 00:39:27,370
I would,
I would,

737
00:39:27,371 --> 00:39:28,204
I read that was the perfect situation is
like a beautiful girl dressed in red 

738
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,180
purse on the sports car with some 
cocaine.

739
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,380
Why?
Randy?

740
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,350
Yeah,
that's a good.

741
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,650
That's a good question.
I'm not exactly sure why that's wrong.

742
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:49,651
I do know why red ripe fruit
women have coevolved with right fruit,

743
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:54,823
sneaky of you by the way,
so that's why you know that you just 

744
00:39:57,521 --> 00:39:58,354
have to lead through women's magazine 
and the lipstick is always associated 

745
00:40:01,271 --> 00:40:05,170
with apples that are glistening in some 
way or a peach or something like that.

746
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,333
And where we were primarily fruit eaters
and the reason we have color vision is 

747
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:15,220
to detect fruit ripe fruit.
And so part of the reason that also part

748
00:40:15,221 --> 00:40:16,054
of the reason that fruit turns red or 
colored when it ripens is because the 

749
00:40:19,181 --> 00:40:20,014
fruit that was successfully eaten by 
creatures that distributed this six 

750
00:40:22,671 --> 00:40:26,050
seeds was the fruit that was right when 
it was eating.

751
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,153
And so as the color vision evolved,
maybe there was a red tint for God only 

752
00:40:29,681 --> 00:40:30,610
knows what reason.

753
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,773
Then a positive feedback loop developed 
and fruit got redder and redder and at 

754
00:40:35,231 --> 00:40:39,580
the same time women capitalized on that.
So that's partly,

755
00:40:39,581 --> 00:40:42,820
I think what explains the association 
between Eve and the apple in,

756
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,500
in,
in genesis,

757
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,920
because genesis is always also a story 
about gaming site.

758
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,260
So yeah.
So that's why red.

759
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,170
So that's pretty funny.
I really think that's pretty funny.

760
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,500
So you know,
evolved more evolved.

761
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:00,040
Sensory significance is absolutely 
everywhere,

762
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:00,740
you know,
and it,

763
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,680
it's so deep inside of us.
Yep.

764
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,230
I have to wonder about lead to it seems 
like.

765
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,541
Oh yeah,
yeah,

766
00:41:07,541 --> 00:41:09,430
yeah.
Red's a significant color.

767
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,410
But I think,
I mean,

768
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:15,520
and it's funny too because say say 
there's a flushed face will.

769
00:41:15,521 --> 00:41:18,850
That means it's infused with blood.
It's also a sign of health.

770
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:22,180
It's also a sign of sexual arousal,
but it is a sign of health.

771
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,680
And so you see in an old coke ads from 
the 19 thirties,

772
00:41:26,681 --> 00:41:28,580
the girls cheeks are so red that,
you know,

773
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,630
it looks like she has a fever so often 
it's a,

774
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:35,630
it's a form of signaling that indicates 
a health.

775
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,930
So that's another part.
I mean these are multiply determined,

776
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:39,764
right.
And is there anything as complex as 

777
00:41:40,851 --> 00:41:41,750
vision?
Yeah.

778
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:42,590
And blood means,
hey,

779
00:41:42,591 --> 00:41:45,830
maybe don't go there or maybe it means 
there's something to eat.

780
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:46,963
Right,
right.

781
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,833
Yep.

782
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,860
You mentioned that there was another 
period of

783
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,193
facial expressions,
but depending on whether you're angry 

784
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,020
or.

785
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:00,920
Oh,
definitely.

786
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:02,600
Yeah.
Well you can see that those things would

787
00:42:02,601 --> 00:42:03,520
loop together.
Right.

788
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:09,130
Once the color vision starts to adapt,
it's probably the color vision for fruit

789
00:42:09,141 --> 00:42:14,141
is way older I would suspect because 
when we developed it we had for so,

790
00:42:14,481 --> 00:42:17,390
but once the,
once the ability's there and we lose our

791
00:42:17,391 --> 00:42:21,290
facial for then it's possible to 
capitalize on that ability to detect the

792
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:22,450
signaling.
You know,

793
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:25,540
when we're talking about a 
transformation over about we were,

794
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,830
we were living in trees about 60 million
years ago,

795
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:32,480
so the transition between us and them is
60 million years.

796
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,680
The separation from champs is about 
seven.

797
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,280
So,
and,

798
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,273
and you know,
chips skin is so dark that you're not 

799
00:42:40,401 --> 00:42:42,440
going to get a lot of signaling.
So.

800
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,410
Alright.
Alright.

801
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:45,501
So.
Okay,

802
00:42:45,501 --> 00:42:48,560
so back to this little diagram.
Now,

803
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:50,630
here's the,
here's the idea,

804
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,960
and this is also informed.
This is deeply informed,

805
00:42:53,961 --> 00:42:56,960
although I didn't know when I developed,
when I was working on these ideas,

806
00:42:56,961 --> 00:42:57,794
this is deeply informed by a guy named 
Norbert Wiener who was one of the 20th 

807
00:43:02,481 --> 00:43:07,481
century's massive geniuses and a force 
behind the development of computation,

808
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:13,100
and so this is a cybernetic model.
He invented cybernetics.

809
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,520
Now I didn't learn this from no Norbert 
Wiener because I learned it from Jeffrey

810
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:19,873
Gray,
but Jeffrey Gray's sources learned it 

811
00:43:21,381 --> 00:43:23,720
from Norbert Wiener way back in the 19 
forties.

812
00:43:23,721 --> 00:43:24,554
In fact,
there was a convention back in the 19 

813
00:43:25,941 --> 00:43:26,774
forties that when you're presented many 
of his ideas at that many psychologists 

814
00:43:30,381 --> 00:43:32,470
attended,
including Sean Psj,

815
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:33,663
and so piaget's theory is very much 
influenced by cybernetics as well and 

816
00:43:36,621 --> 00:43:37,460
all,
many,

817
00:43:37,461 --> 00:43:42,461
many of the standard psychology.
Cognitive models are cybernetic,

818
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:43,683
and so they're grounded in thinking 
that's actually doing engineering 

819
00:43:45,501 --> 00:43:47,630
thinking and not psychological thinking 
at all.

820
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,613
Yep.

821
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:51,263
Cybernetics,

822
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,210
no dianetics.
Yeah,

823
00:43:53,211 --> 00:43:54,044
yeah,
yeah.

824
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,510
So,
okay,

825
00:43:56,511 --> 00:43:57,344
so

826
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,373
what,
how might you conceptualize the 

827
00:44:01,851 --> 00:44:04,130
fundamental elements of a personality?
Well,

828
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,560
this is,
this is what it looks like to me.

829
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:09,140
The first thing is you're a moving 
creature.

830
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:10,993
So here's a funny story.
There's this little animal whose name I 

831
00:44:13,131 --> 00:44:16,370
forget,
and it's juvenile.

832
00:44:16,371 --> 00:44:18,620
It's an ocean animal and it's juvenile 
state.

833
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,480
It swims around.
Okay,

834
00:44:20,481 --> 00:44:22,690
so it's juvenile state.
It has,

835
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,110
it has to coordinate it's movements and 
interact with the changing environment.

836
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,530
So it has a brain,
but then when it turns into an adult,

837
00:44:30,531 --> 00:44:33,970
it attaches itself to a rock and turns 
into something that's sort of like a,

838
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:35,070
you know,
a piece of coral.

839
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:39,180
It promptly digests its own brain.
So the issue is,

840
00:44:39,181 --> 00:44:41,970
unless you don't really need a brain,
if you're not going to go anywhere,

841
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:42,833
right?
So a brain is going places thing and we 

842
00:44:45,511 --> 00:44:48,660
have a very big brain and so it's like 
we're always zooming around doing things

843
00:44:48,661 --> 00:44:49,494
and you know,
we've got these hands that enable us to 

844
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:53,370
manipulate things and transform things.

845
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:57,350
And so the brand is for doing things.
It's not just for perceive it.

846
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:58,403
Roughly speaking,
the back half of your brain is for 

847
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:02,670
perception.
The cortical part,

848
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,533
mostly visual perception,
but some auditory and touch a lot of 

849
00:45:06,181 --> 00:45:07,014
digital.
And the front part is for output motor 

850
00:45:09,961 --> 00:45:13,110
action,
and as you proceed,

851
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,900
imagine the front part starts halfway 
here.

852
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:16,913
As you proceed from the midline forward,
the auction becomes more and more 

853
00:45:20,521 --> 00:45:24,060
abstract until when you're dealing with 
the dorsolateral prefrontal Cortex,

854
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,280
you're thinking abstractly.
Now,

855
00:45:26,281 --> 00:45:28,600
people think that when they're thinking 
abstractly,

856
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,960
they're thinking about representations 
of the world,

857
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,270
you know,
because we think we think about objects,

858
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:37,800
but that isn't what we're doing.
What we're doing is rehearsing potential

859
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:42,120
schemas of action.
So we have this abstract space which you

860
00:45:42,121 --> 00:45:45,900
might think about as a duplicate world.
You have an idea,

861
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:46,973
you test the idea,
like you would test it if you were 

862
00:45:48,991 --> 00:45:49,824
acting it out in the world,
and if the consequence of the imaginary 

863
00:45:52,441 --> 00:45:56,760
testing is you encounter grief,
then you don't implement the idea in the

864
00:45:56,761 --> 00:45:57,594
world.

865
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,433
Now you know that doesn't always work 
because there's tradeoffs between short 

866
00:46:00,781 --> 00:46:03,840
term pleasure in longterm punishment.
That makes it complicated.

867
00:46:03,841 --> 00:46:07,260
But what seems to have happened is that 
as we've evolved,

868
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:09,720
we're very sneaky creatures.
You know,

869
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:10,913
for billions of years.
The only way that you could figure out 

870
00:46:14,191 --> 00:46:16,860
whether you're right or wrong was to go 
out and do something and if you died you

871
00:46:16,861 --> 00:46:18,880
were wrong.
So,

872
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:21,600
but now you can think about doing 
something.

873
00:46:21,601 --> 00:46:22,434
Andy,
of the consequence of running the 

874
00:46:24,001 --> 00:46:27,870
simulation in your head is that you die,
then you don't do it.

875
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:29,183
And so what you're basically doing is 
spinning off multiple potential use in 

876
00:46:33,781 --> 00:46:36,870
multiple potential universities and 
running them as simulations,

877
00:46:36,871 --> 00:46:37,704
you know,
and now we really do that now because 

878
00:46:38,761 --> 00:46:40,770
we've externalized it onto the computer.
Right?

879
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:43,770
Which is what we're doing with really,
really complex video games.

880
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:45,670
So it's so smart.
That's,

881
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:48,720
it's an amazing evolutionary advance.

882
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,553
Now.
It doesn't work that well because 

883
00:46:50,491 --> 00:46:52,410
sometimes you run the simulation and you
think,

884
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:53,790
you know,
this would,

885
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:54,803
this is a stupid idea and then you 
probably have a beer so that you could 

886
00:46:57,271 --> 00:46:58,620
go do it.
So,

887
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,260
but you know,
all things considered,

888
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,410
that's still what this abstract spaces 
for.

889
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:06,480
I should tell you something about this 
too,

890
00:47:06,481 --> 00:47:07,314
because you're going to hear from neuro 
psychologists that a lot of what the 

891
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:11,424
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex does,
the prefrontal cortex in general is 

892
00:47:14,221 --> 00:47:17,040
impulse control and that's.
That's wrong.

893
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,293
That is not what it does and part of the
reason I know this is because the 

894
00:47:21,451 --> 00:47:25,650
correlation between prefrontal cortical 
cognitive ability,

895
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:28,920
which is very tightly associated with Iq
by the way,

896
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:29,763
like the correlations like point nine,
so you could even argue it's the same 

897
00:47:32,981 --> 00:47:34,570
thing.
Fluid Iq in particular,

898
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:35,703
the correlation between Dorsolateral 
prefrontal cognitive capacity and 

899
00:47:41,081 --> 00:47:45,820
conscientiousness,
which is like longterm goal directed,

900
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:49,930
future oriented planned activity is 
zero.

901
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:51,793
Okay?
Zero is a very bad correlation when 

902
00:47:53,951 --> 00:47:55,480
you're driving,
you know the old idea,

903
00:47:55,481 --> 00:48:00,481
you correlation doesn't imply causality.
Well wrong.

904
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:01,833
It does strongly imply causality.
It doesn't demonstrate it because with 

905
00:48:04,841 --> 00:48:07,630
every crop causal relationship,
there's a correlation.

906
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:12,790
So 100 percent of causally related items
have a correlation,

907
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:15,070
right?
One hundred percent correlation.

908
00:48:15,071 --> 00:48:15,611
So,
well,

909
00:48:15,611 --> 00:48:16,444
not necessarily,
but it implies correlation does not 

910
00:48:18,671 --> 00:48:20,470
prove it,
right,

911
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:23,650
but zero,
that's,

912
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:24,573
that's bad.
That means that those things aren't 

913
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:27,070
related.
Now,

914
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:27,903
if you think about it,
you can understand why they have to be 

915
00:48:30,371 --> 00:48:35,371
unrelated because if you embodied your 
abstractions,

916
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,650
then you wouldn't be able to experiment 
with them.

917
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:41,290
You just act them out and then bang,
you'd be dead,

918
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:42,363
so you have to separate the cognitive 
activity from the embodiment completely 

919
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:50,290
so that you can choose which of your 
potential selves to incarnate,

920
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:52,000
so to speak.
Now,

921
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:53,253
the prefrontal Cortex is a complex place
and the lower parts of it seem to be 

922
00:48:56,591 --> 00:48:57,424
more related to the relationship between
cognitive activity and the control of 

923
00:49:02,891 --> 00:49:05,680
behavior,
but we have tried 50 tasks.

924
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,513
I bet trying to get a correlation with 
conscientiousness and we haven't found 

925
00:49:09,431 --> 00:49:11,530
one.
We cannot cope.

926
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:12,513
The reason I'm telling you this because 
conscientiousness is a very good 

927
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:16,750
predictor of longterm life success,
right?

928
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:17,843
It's,
it's you guys get your grades for two 

929
00:49:19,511 --> 00:49:20,410
reasons.
One,

930
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:24,310
you're smart if assuming you are and two
that you work hard,

931
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:27,910
assuming that you do that eats up almost
all the variance in your grades.

932
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,150
Creativity is zero correlation with 
grades at u of t by the way.

933
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:36,100
So I think it's extraordinarily comical 
and completely completely unsurprising.

934
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,233
So it's hard for an institution to 
greater creativity because it's an 

935
00:49:42,161 --> 00:49:45,190
institution and the problem with being 
creative is that you,

936
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,880
you forced people to come up with a new 
grading scheme.

937
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:49,781
It's like,
no,

938
00:49:49,781 --> 00:49:51,730
they're not going to do that.
So.

939
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,593
Right,
because you come up with something 

940
00:49:53,051 --> 00:49:54,160
creative,
it's different.

941
00:49:54,161 --> 00:49:55,150
Well,
what do you do with that?

942
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,290
You say,
don't do that.

943
00:49:56,291 --> 00:49:58,630
That's not what I want.
Even if it's a great thing,

944
00:49:58,631 --> 00:49:59,111
it's like,
yeah,

945
00:49:59,111 --> 00:50:01,180
you have to take your great thing and go
somewhere else with him.

946
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:02,463
You know,
I've got five minutes to mark your damn 

947
00:50:03,881 --> 00:50:04,990
paper.
So.

948
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,580
All right.
All right.

949
00:50:06,581 --> 00:50:08,440
So.
So anyways,

950
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:09,470
the,
this,

951
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:10,303
the,
this capacity for abstraction is 

952
00:50:11,381 --> 00:50:12,214
divorced almost completely from 
embodiment and that's a good thing 

953
00:50:14,741 --> 00:50:15,574
because that allows us to experiment,
but it's a bad thing because actually 

954
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,550
doing the embodiment turns out to be 
very difficult.

955
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,473
It's like your body's got all these 
habits built into it that you've been 

956
00:50:24,911 --> 00:50:27,800
working on for a long time.
Here's another piece of advice.

957
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,660
Do not practice things that you don't 
want to become because one of the things

958
00:50:32,661 --> 00:50:33,740
that happens,
let's say

959
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:36,693
you you,
you take Danish speakers and you've 

960
00:50:38,541 --> 00:50:39,374
played Danish backwards to them and you 
do a scan of brain activity so their 

961
00:50:42,621 --> 00:50:43,454
brains lighting up like mad because they
don't know how to listen to Danish 

962
00:50:45,471 --> 00:50:46,304
backwards.
So you get a whole bunch of brain 

963
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:48,793
involved in a new task,
but then as you practice the task and 

964
00:50:53,421 --> 00:50:56,790
routinize it,
less and less brain is involved.

965
00:50:56,810 --> 00:50:57,643
So what happens is the activation,
and this is in your standard right hand 

966
00:51:00,081 --> 00:51:00,914
male and the reason I'm using that as an
example because that's the kind of 

967
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,513
simplest default brain in a sense.
Women are more diffusely organized and 

968
00:51:08,061 --> 00:51:08,894
so it's harder to exactly talk about 
their neurological structure and in a 

969
00:51:12,411 --> 00:51:14,960
simple way,
but in a right handed male.

970
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,730
What happens is the,
the activity starts to shift to the left

971
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:20,833
and then it shifts backwards and as it 
does so the amount of tissue that's 

972
00:51:23,361 --> 00:51:27,020
activated get smaller and smaller and 
smaller and smaller until you've built a

973
00:51:27,021 --> 00:51:29,900
little machine that takes care of that 
sort of thing.

974
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:32,690
But the thing about that machine is that
it's a little machine,

975
00:51:32,691 --> 00:51:36,380
it's a habit and it's actually there.
It's built into you.

976
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,610
So be careful what you practice because 
if you practice it enough,

977
00:51:40,611 --> 00:51:42,410
then it becomes.
It's like it's you,

978
00:51:42,411 --> 00:51:45,950
it's the default you.
And then if you want to change it,

979
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:50,360
you can't just undo that stupid machine.
It's there permanently.

980
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,373
What you have to do is you have to build
another middle machine that's shuts it 

981
00:51:54,141 --> 00:51:57,230
off and then another machine that does 
the other thing,

982
00:51:57,231 --> 00:51:58,064
and then if you get stressed,
the little machine that shuts the first 

983
00:51:59,841 --> 00:52:01,880
machine off will stop working.
In fact,

984
00:52:01,881 --> 00:52:04,100
your stupid habit will come.
So.

985
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:05,803
So you know,
people used to talk about the 

986
00:52:06,981 --> 00:52:10,430
development of character and there was 
something about that that was absolutely

987
00:52:10,431 --> 00:52:11,264
right,
because character is how you build 

988
00:52:13,491 --> 00:52:17,090
yourself across time and it really,
really matters.

989
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:19,990
Only practice what you want to become.
If you,

990
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,790
if you practice other things developed,
then you'll become them.

991
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:23,990
Not,
that's not so good.

992
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:27,303
Okay,
so back to this now gray and Sokolov in 

993
00:52:31,421 --> 00:52:32,254
vinegar it over.
We're going to talk about them for a 

994
00:52:33,041 --> 00:52:33,431
minute.
Now.

995
00:52:33,431 --> 00:52:37,750
They used to talk about animals,
they were mostly thinking about animals,

996
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,140
rats,
mostly as having an expectancy model,

997
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:46,150
and so you take a rat,
you throw them in a new environment.

998
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,100
What does he do?
Well,

999
00:52:48,101 --> 00:52:48,934
the first thing he does is freeze 
because God only knows what's out there 

1000
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:55,060
and so he's like paralyzed rat.
He's just seen the Medusa.

1001
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:59,260
He's paralyzed and then if nothing 
attacks him,

1002
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:00,363
he starts to calm down a bit and then 
you start sniffing because rats are all 

1003
00:53:03,341 --> 00:53:08,341
smell and he sniffs around and he's 
trying to detect cats.

1004
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:11,470
Say now rats have such a good sense of 
smell.

1005
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:15,790
If a rat eat something that makes it syc
will never eat it again.

1006
00:53:15,791 --> 00:53:19,720
But if a rap smells the breadth of a rat
that ate something that made him sick,

1007
00:53:19,721 --> 00:53:22,000
he won't eat that either.
Right?

1008
00:53:22,001 --> 00:53:24,500
So rats,
a man,

1009
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:25,543
they can smell things so that.
And animals are built around the smell 

1010
00:53:27,781 --> 00:53:29,430
brain.
So there are a lot different than us.

1011
00:53:29,431 --> 00:53:30,330
We,
we have.

1012
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:34,590
Did I tell you about the,
the t shirts study of symmetrical men.

1013
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,060
Oh,
that's a funny one.

1014
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:39,180
Yeah.
So we know that.

1015
00:53:39,181 --> 00:53:42,150
One of the things that signifies 
physical beauty as symmetry,

1016
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:43,673
right,
because the reason for that is that all 

1017
00:53:45,301 --> 00:53:46,134
things considered symmetrical,
people are more healthy than 

1018
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:49,913
asymmetrical.
Asymmetry indicates that something's 

1019
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:55,140
gone wrong somewhere in the process of 
development.

1020
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:56,303
So we like symmetry in beauty and a
and that's fine and that's all the way 

1021
00:54:02,611 --> 00:54:04,560
across the animal kingdom.
So butterflies,

1022
00:54:04,561 --> 00:54:05,394
there are butterflies that won't mate 
with another butterfly if it deviates 

1023
00:54:07,801 --> 00:54:10,560
from cemetery.
Some absurdly tiny amount.

1024
00:54:10,561 --> 00:54:15,210
Like really it's micro,
it's micro measurement deviation.

1025
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:18,250
I guess they have a butterfly template 
and if you know the,

1026
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:21,600
the potential mating butterfly doesn't 
match.

1027
00:54:21,601 --> 00:54:23,290
It's like flipped her off,
you know,

1028
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:27,270
you're not getting anywhere so,
so that's fine.

1029
00:54:27,271 --> 00:54:29,600
But cemetery.
So this researcher,

1030
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:30,443
God only knows what possessed him.
He took a bunch of men ranging from 

1031
00:54:33,451 --> 00:54:34,970
symmetrical,
asymmetrical,

1032
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:35,813
you know,
judged by a panel and then he had the 

1033
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,273
shower and then he had them wear a tee 
shirt for like four hours and then all 

1034
00:54:41,941 --> 00:54:42,774
of them.
And then he gave these tee shirts to 

1035
00:54:43,561 --> 00:54:44,520
women and said,
okay,

1036
00:54:44,521 --> 00:54:45,610
rate these,
the,

1037
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:47,610
the,
the scent of the t shirt from,

1038
00:54:47,611 --> 00:54:49,890
you know,
positive today.

1039
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:50,743
Negatives,
well the women overwhelmingly preferred 

1040
00:54:52,171 --> 00:54:54,900
the symmetrical guys,
so yeah,

1041
00:54:54,901 --> 00:54:55,740
no kidding.
Okay.

1042
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:58,050
So you just bloody well never know 
what's,

1043
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,320
what's behind that attraction,
you know,

1044
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,130
we know something.
Symmetry is a big one,

1045
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,690
but there's a bunch of other ones too.

1046
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,270
Yep.
That was just wondering.

1047
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:11,440
I know
you're like,

1048
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,630
oh yeah,
there's a bunch of things.

1049
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,513
Yeah.
So,

1050
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,140
um,
hi,

1051
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,060
here's another study.
This is a cool one.

1052
00:55:20,061 --> 00:55:24,080
So this is one of the few psychological 
fact.

1053
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:26,540
We don't have many psychological facts,
you know,

1054
00:55:26,541 --> 00:55:28,400
we have a lot of hypotheses about 
things,

1055
00:55:28,401 --> 00:55:30,890
but this is as close to a fact as we've 
ever gone.

1056
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,290
So back,
you know,

1057
00:55:33,291 --> 00:55:38,150
decades ago the Israelis children were 
raised in and those were basically,

1058
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,433
um,
they were basically daycare for kids 

1059
00:55:43,701 --> 00:55:44,730
group daycare,
but they,

1060
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:45,643
the kids were more separated from their 
parents then they might be in a regular 

1061
00:55:48,171 --> 00:55:50,300
daycare anyways.
Oh,

1062
00:55:50,301 --> 00:55:51,134
the Israeli kids were in these boots and
so then we have detailed marriage 

1063
00:55:55,011 --> 00:55:58,880
records of the kids and so you know,
that people very seldom Mary,

1064
00:55:58,910 --> 00:55:59,743
their siblings and they're very seldomly
in a sexual relationship with their 

1065
00:56:03,471 --> 00:56:04,520
siblings.
And you might say,

1066
00:56:04,521 --> 00:56:05,354
well why is that it's the case across 
cultures with with very specific 

1067
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:11,870
exceptions like often high ranking 
nobility can,

1068
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,060
you know,
they have an option,

1069
00:56:14,090 --> 00:56:18,530
but generally speaking there's a 
powerful incest taboo as well as between

1070
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:20,510
parents and children.
So,

1071
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:22,403
so some research and decided,
well how do you know who your sibling 

1072
00:56:25,421 --> 00:56:26,380
is?
You know,

1073
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:27,343
roughly speaking,
what exactly is it that's not turning 

1074
00:56:31,151 --> 00:56:32,410
you on,
let's say?

1075
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:33,813
Well,
so they checked out the cupboard some 

1076
00:56:34,661 --> 00:56:35,494
records and they found that Israeli 
children who were raised in the same 

1077
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:42,940
Kabuto never married each other.
Whatever happened,

1078
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,290
seemed to,
you know,

1079
00:56:44,291 --> 00:56:46,480
it was as if that close,
close

1080
00:56:48,370 --> 00:56:49,203
contact in the very early years 
triggered whatever the sibling anti 

1081
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:55,360
response is.
And that was that.

1082
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:58,330
It's probably smelled.
That would be my guest.

1083
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:03,360
Now there's also another study,
one of the things they found with mice,

1084
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:09,280
I hope it's mice,
is that mice will not make.

1085
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:10,800
Is that right?
I can't.

1086
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:12,390
Okay.
I'm going to garble this up,

1087
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,580
but it doesn't matter because the point,
the underlying point is valid,

1088
00:57:15,581 --> 00:57:17,170
even though I'm going to mess up the 
details.

1089
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:21,460
Animal studies indicated,
if I remember correctly,

1090
00:57:21,461 --> 00:57:22,294
that mice will not mate with other mice 
who have an rh factor that would 

1091
00:57:27,071 --> 00:57:31,750
increase the probability of a 
miscarriage and neither will women.

1092
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:33,341
So women,
well,

1093
00:57:33,341 --> 00:57:38,020
not with mice obviously,
but women women do not like the smell of

1094
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:38,854
men who have rh factors that in 
combination with theirs would produce 

1095
00:57:41,861 --> 00:57:43,210
sub optimal,
um,

1096
00:57:43,970 --> 00:57:44,803
offscreen.
And when you ask them why they don't 

1097
00:57:46,331 --> 00:57:49,170
like the smell,
they say it smells like my brother,

1098
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:50,890
something like that.

1099
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,520
So anyways,
so anyways,

1100
00:57:54,521 --> 00:57:55,780
that's quite remarkable.
Now,

1101
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,950
back to the rats and the expected 
Seymour.

1102
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:01,420
Okay,
so we already know that

1103
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:06,640
you can get an orienting response out of
a human being if something deviates from

1104
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:09,430
expectancy.
Now people started studying this in rats

1105
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:13,180
and the original conceptualization was 
expectation.

1106
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:17,320
So you have an expectation of how the 
world is going to lay itself out.

1107
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:21,190
That's your model and nanny of the world
deviates from that.

1108
00:58:21,191 --> 00:58:22,024
Then you have an orienting reflex and 
what the orienting reflex does is 

1109
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:26,463
protect you from predation.
That's the first level of the orienting 

1110
00:58:29,861 --> 00:58:30,970
response.
It's really,

1111
00:58:30,971 --> 00:58:31,804
really primitive.
It's mediated only by a few neuronal 

1112
00:58:34,091 --> 00:58:34,924
connections.
So it's unbelievably rapid and then 

1113
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,504
after that there's anxiety and the 
proclivity to explore that both gets 

1114
00:58:42,311 --> 00:58:46,510
activated.
So it's first protective.

1115
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:51,130
Then you orient towards the managing.
You're walking down the street here,

1116
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,450
a really loud noise behind you.

1117
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:54,490
It's like really loud so it startles 
you.

1118
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:58,870
Well you go into a crowd so that if a 
tiger jumped on your back,

1119
00:58:58,871 --> 00:59:02,980
it would be hard for it to get your neck
and then you know,

1120
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:03,873
tenths of a second later you'll turn.
You'll assuming you don't get attacked 

1121
00:59:06,761 --> 00:59:07,594
by a tiger,
you'll swivel and turn and orient all 

1122
00:59:10,211 --> 00:59:11,044
your senses towards the locale that was 
specified by the sound because you have 

1123
00:59:14,501 --> 00:59:15,334
stereo at a stereo auditory system and 
you can localize events in space using 

1124
00:59:21,421 --> 00:59:22,610
now.
So you already am towards it.

1125
00:59:22,611 --> 00:59:25,100
That's part of the orientation reflex.
It's a reflex.

1126
00:59:25,101 --> 00:59:25,934
It's not voluntary.
So and then once you got your eyes 

1127
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:30,583
trained on it and your ears,
then you start to explore it and then 

1128
00:59:33,801 --> 00:59:35,360
you might get,
you might phrase,

1129
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:39,770
you might get out of there,
which is a panic response.

1130
00:59:39,771 --> 00:59:40,604
That's another thing that can be 
triggered by the orientee reflects 

1131
00:59:42,171 --> 00:59:44,720
different circuit or you might think,
well,

1132
00:59:44,721 --> 00:59:45,500
what's going on over there?

1133
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,030
It looks interesting and then you go 
approach it.

1134
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:53,050
Now those two,
the exploratory part is mediated in part

1135
00:59:54,231 --> 00:59:55,700
by the Hypothalamus,
which is a very,

1136
00:59:55,701 --> 00:59:56,534
very old system and it has a whole 
section about half of it is devoted to 

1137
01:00:00,381 --> 01:00:01,214
the circuitry that you would use to 
figure out what was going on if 

1138
01:00:03,471 --> 01:00:06,740
something that you didn't understood 
happened and then you have a whole other

1139
01:00:06,741 --> 01:00:07,574
circuit that's Hipaa Campbell and make 
delek that regulates the exploratory 

1140
01:00:11,451 --> 01:00:12,284
circuit that says,
be careful because while you're 

1141
01:00:13,881 --> 01:00:14,714
gathering information,
you might get killed and the anxiety 

1142
01:00:17,511 --> 01:00:21,350
circuit takes primacy generally speaking
over the exploratory circuit,

1143
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:25,760
and the reason for that is you don't 
want to get information and be dead.

1144
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:28,640
So caution is the watchword.
Now,

1145
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,560
the other thing that you might think 
about,

1146
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:33,260
which is an extremely useful thing to 
think about,

1147
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:34,633
okay,
let's go back to that diagram I showed 

1148
01:00:35,871 --> 01:00:37,820
you with the hierarchy,
right?

1149
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:38,653
So you got the motor actions at the 
bottom and you've got the high level 

1150
01:00:41,451 --> 01:00:43,520
abstractions at the top.
Okay?

1151
01:00:43,521 --> 01:00:47,750
So you're tickling the baby and somebody
comes home and says,

1152
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:50,870
if you tickle the baby this way,
then the baby has more fun.

1153
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:52,093
And so how do you respond to that?
Well maybe you're a little peeved 

1154
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:55,543
because you're doing perfectly fine with
this baby and you know someone's coming 

1155
01:00:57,711 --> 01:01:01,370
in,
altering your tickling micro personality

1156
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:03,800
and you know if you're irritable you'll 
say,

1157
01:01:03,801 --> 01:01:04,634
well why didn't you just go off and 
they'll find a baby of your own to play 

1158
01:01:06,441 --> 01:01:07,670
with?
And if you're not,

1159
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,190
and if you're not that irritable,
you might say,

1160
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:11,623
well,
okay,

1161
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,690
show me what to do.
You know there'll be a tinge of negative

1162
01:01:14,691 --> 01:01:16,280
emotion.
They're generally speaking,

1163
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:18,230
depending on how the person has 
approached it,

1164
01:01:18,231 --> 01:01:23,231
but your self concept can probably 
handle a micro change to you're tickling

1165
01:01:24,081 --> 01:01:24,914
routine.

1166
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,310
Okay?
So that's going to produce only a little

1167
01:01:28,311 --> 01:01:29,144
bit of anxiety and irritation.
And the reason for that is that the 

1168
01:01:32,091 --> 01:01:32,924
threat to you is proportionate to the 
magnitude of the system that's being 

1169
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:45,200
modified by the challenge.
Now this is really useful to know,

1170
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:46,520
okay,
practically,

1171
01:01:46,521 --> 01:01:48,620
and this is why,
so let's say

1172
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:51,343
you're having an argument with your 
partner and you say you're a stupid 

1173
01:01:54,741 --> 01:01:57,800
person and you've always been a stupid 
person,

1174
01:01:57,801 --> 01:02:00,550
and as far as I can tell as far into the
future,

1175
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:03,410
as I can see,
you're going to remain a stupid person.

1176
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:04,933
So what are they supposed to do?
What are they going to do when you say 

1177
01:02:06,741 --> 01:02:09,260
that?
They're going to cry,

1178
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:10,913
like if you mean it,
they're going to get angry if you mean 

1179
01:02:13,881 --> 01:02:17,660
it and they don't like you very much.
And why is that?

1180
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:19,370
Well,
it's like it's.

1181
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,150
It's a salt basically.

1182
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:21,983
The only way really the only thing that 
you can do in a situation like that is 

1183
01:02:24,721 --> 01:02:27,210
walk away,
ignore it,

1184
01:02:27,211 --> 01:02:30,630
respond in kind or in degenerates into 
violence,

1185
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:33,030
not see it because there's no 
discussion.

1186
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:34,940
You haven't left the person anywhere to 
go.

1187
01:02:34,970 --> 01:02:38,750
You've gotten right to the top of their 
hierarchy and said everything about used

1188
01:02:38,751 --> 01:02:39,584
wrong and worse than that,
all the mechanisms that we could use to 

1189
01:02:42,691 --> 01:02:46,770
correct it won't work.
So those are fighting words,

1190
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:48,660
so don't do that unless you want to have
a fight.

1191
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:51,150
So then you might say,
well what would you do instead?

1192
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:55,410
And the answer is deliver the least 
amount of information you possibly can.

1193
01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:56,703
And so let's say you come home and your 
person is watching tv and you were kind 

1194
01:03:01,101 --> 01:03:03,510
of hoping they'd greet you at the door.
You can't.

1195
01:03:03,570 --> 01:03:06,360
You shouldn't break down into tears and 
say you're a stupid person.

1196
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:07,373
You've always been a stupid person that 
you're couldn't be a stupid person in 

1197
01:03:09,271 --> 01:03:10,680
the future.
You should say,

1198
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:13,103
I have this peculiarity and that is that
when I come home I don't have enough 

1199
01:03:17,101 --> 01:03:21,600
confidence to just be happy.
I would like you to come and say,

1200
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:25,860
just shut the TV off for two minutes.
Come to the front door and say hello.

1201
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:29,700
Then you can go back and watch your TV.
Would it be okay if you did that?

1202
01:03:29,790 --> 01:03:32,070
And they'll think,
well,

1203
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:35,080
you'll have to pay for it somehow,
but then they'll,

1204
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:37,380
they'll probably do it.
And so.

1205
01:03:37,381 --> 01:03:38,214
But the thing is,
is you got to specify the routine that 

1206
01:03:40,621 --> 01:03:43,650
you want transformed at the highest 
possible level of resolution,

1207
01:03:43,651 --> 01:03:44,484
and you want to,
you want to recommend the minimal 

1208
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:51,210
necessary change that will satisfy you.
So you can't say,

1209
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:55,740
if you love me,
you know how to greet me at the door.

1210
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:58,260
Hi non-helpful.
Because they're stupid,

1211
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:01,230
right?
So are you.

1212
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:03,240
So you have to spell it out.
It's like,

1213
01:04:03,241 --> 01:04:06,360
what are you wanting to exactly what 
would make you satisfied?

1214
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:07,463
And then you have to have your person 
like grudgingly practice that a few 

1215
01:04:11,161 --> 01:04:15,630
times and you have to let them do it 
very badly and also in a bad temper.

1216
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:16,613
And then you have to reward them for it.
And then maybe three months later 

1217
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:20,843
they'll do it properly.
So you need to know that because that's 

1218
01:04:23,641 --> 01:04:24,474
what people are like.
It's very hard for them to learn new 

1219
01:04:25,921 --> 01:04:29,910
things and they're very resistant to it,
but they're very responsive to reward.

1220
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:31,433
So another thing,
this is partly what bf skinner figured 

1221
01:04:33,841 --> 01:04:34,674
out.
So when he was training rides and he 

1222
01:04:36,631 --> 01:04:37,464
wanted to do something,
one of the things he would do is he put 

1223
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:40,403
maybe he was going to train the robot to
climb up a little ladder and they mean 

1224
01:04:44,681 --> 01:04:48,150
he could get rats to climb ladders and 
then climb across the little monkey bars

1225
01:04:48,151 --> 01:04:50,160
and then spin around three times and 
then you know,

1226
01:04:50,161 --> 01:04:50,994
whack a ball and then eat something like
ego and incredibly complex behavior out 

1227
01:04:54,451 --> 01:04:55,284
of Ras.

1228
01:04:55,320 --> 01:05:00,030
And the way he did that was patients.
So he put the ladder in the cage and the

1229
01:05:00,031 --> 01:05:04,600
rat would just run around doing wrap 
things and then it would put its hand on

1230
01:05:04,601 --> 01:05:07,710
the,
on the first rung and skinner would give

1231
01:05:07,711 --> 01:05:10,140
it a pallet.
And so he did,

1232
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:10,993
you know,
after even once the rats going to be 

1233
01:05:13,141 --> 01:05:13,974
like standing in the immediate vicinity 
of the ladder and then the frequency 

1234
01:05:18,011 --> 01:05:18,844
with which it's going to go like this,
it's just increased so that he does it 

1235
01:05:20,891 --> 01:05:22,150
again,
Bang Pallet.

1236
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:24,370
Well soon the rabbit is just going like 
this,

1237
01:05:24,371 --> 01:05:25,204
right?
So then you wait until the trials the 

1238
01:05:27,521 --> 01:05:29,710
other hand.
So you give it a pellet then,

1239
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:33,000
well then it's going like this and then 
because it's going to get bored,

1240
01:05:33,001 --> 01:05:35,260
it will go like this.
It'll hit the next stair bang.

1241
01:05:35,261 --> 01:05:38,470
You give it a pellet suiting the routes,
climbing and doing all the little things

1242
01:05:38,471 --> 01:05:39,304
you want it to do.

1243
01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:41,800
Now the problem with that is you have to
be patient.

1244
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:44,620
You have to wait until the rat does what
you want.

1245
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,140
Okay?
That's more relationship advice.

1246
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:48,183
Wait until the rock.
That was what you want and then reward 

1247
01:05:50,961 --> 01:05:55,810
it and it's unbelievably useful and it's
also extraordinarily positive.

1248
01:05:55,811 --> 01:05:56,644
I mean I'm being
comical in so far as I can manage that 

1249
01:06:01,331 --> 01:06:02,164
about the situation,
but people love reward and they love 

1250
01:06:05,570 --> 01:06:08,320
attention.
People love attention more than anything

1251
01:06:08,321 --> 01:06:10,210
else.
And so if you're.

1252
01:06:10,211 --> 01:06:11,044
What will you watch through the day and 
when your partner does something that's 

1253
01:06:14,441 --> 01:06:15,790
good,
say man,

1254
01:06:15,791 --> 01:06:17,830
that was good,
or something like that.

1255
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:20,560
You can be inventive and then they'll do
it more.

1256
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:25,000
And if you do that a whole bunch,
like for a year there'll be doing things

1257
01:06:25,001 --> 01:06:29,440
that are good for you just all the time,
but you have to be patient,

1258
01:06:29,441 --> 01:06:30,274
which is very annoying and you have to 
suppress your response to only respond 

1259
01:06:34,241 --> 01:06:36,100
to negative things,
you know,

1260
01:06:36,101 --> 01:06:39,640
because what we know about the 
expectancy models is that

1261
01:06:41,490 --> 01:06:45,850
a deviation from expectation produces a 
burst of negative emotions,

1262
01:06:45,851 --> 01:06:46,684
you know,
so you come home and the whole house is 

1263
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,630
clean,
but there's like,

1264
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:50,583
I don't know,
the dog has shed on the rug or 

1265
01:06:54,131 --> 01:06:54,520
something.

1266
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:55,720
And the person who overlooked,
that's like,

1267
01:06:55,721 --> 01:06:56,554
you're not going to see the clean house,
you're going to see that rug with the 

1268
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:00,100
dorm for on it.
You're going to say,

1269
01:07:00,101 --> 01:07:02,760
why didn't you clean up the rug with the
dog for?

1270
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:03,603
And they're going to say,
good luck getting me to clean up the 

1271
01:07:05,231 --> 01:07:07,220
house again.
And you know,

1272
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:08,103
because the thing is,
is the exception stands out and what's 

1273
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,273
done doesn't.
And the reason for that is you can just 

1274
01:07:13,901 --> 01:07:16,900
ignore what stuff because it's done.
It doesn't get in your way.

1275
01:07:17,050 --> 01:07:17,883
So it gets invisible really quickly.
So you really got to watch that 

1276
01:07:21,701 --> 01:07:24,130
tendency.
One of the things neat you said was that

1277
01:07:24,131 --> 01:07:24,964
if you really want to punish someone,
you don't punish them when they do 

1278
01:07:27,311 --> 01:07:31,360
something wrong because they expect that
that's not a punishment.

1279
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:33,970
They expect that they might even be 
relieved by it.

1280
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,640
You want to punish them when they do 
something right,

1281
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:38,343
because then you'll really hurt them.
And so that's something to think about 

1282
01:07:40,841 --> 01:07:42,220
in your.
If you're in a relationship,

1283
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,590
man,
if someone's done something right,

1284
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:46,203
do not punish them.
You do that two or three times and 

1285
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:51,100
that's it and you're not going to get 
them do to do that anymore.

1286
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:55,300
So judiciousness,
watch what they're doing.

1287
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:57,490
If something happens that good,
that's good,

1288
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,370
notice it and you know if they've done a
bunch of things,

1289
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:02,710
don't concentrate on the things they did
wrong.

1290
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:06,030
That's not smart.
It's really hard on them too.

1291
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:07,630
Like this.
In some sense,

1292
01:08:07,631 --> 01:08:10,030
this sounds manipulative and selfish,
you know,

1293
01:08:10,031 --> 01:08:13,340
because I'm teaching you how to train 
your partner,

1294
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:14,393
but you should also teach them how to 
train you because it would be really 

1295
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:20,570
nice if you could come home and the 
person would say,

1296
01:08:20,571 --> 01:08:20,740
what?

1297
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:22,050
What did you do today?
And you say,

1298
01:08:22,051 --> 01:08:23,420
you know,
here's a bunch of things I did,

1299
01:08:23,421 --> 01:08:24,410
and they said,
they say,

1300
01:08:24,411 --> 01:08:25,244
well,
this looks really good and that was 

1301
01:08:26,181 --> 01:08:27,560
great.
Why don't you do some more of that?

1302
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:28,760
And you're like,
oh boy,

1303
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:32,150
it was a great day.
And so you know,

1304
01:08:32,390 --> 01:08:36,740
you can train them to train you properly
and that's a really helpful thing,

1305
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:38,690
especially if you do it over a few 
years,

1306
01:08:38,691 --> 01:08:39,524
you know you can.
That's how you have a good relationship 

1307
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:43,730
because you're both clueless as hell to 
begin with.

1308
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:46,850
You don't know even what would make you 
happy,

1309
01:08:46,851 --> 01:08:48,950
much less what would make the other 
person happy.

1310
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:50,083
And so you've got to figure these things
out bit by bit and then you have to 

1311
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:57,970
inform each other and then you have to 
be patient enough to let your partner do

1312
01:08:58,221 --> 01:09:00,860
these things really badly.
I'll give you another example.

1313
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:05,480
Sometimes sometimes I,
I see couples sporadically in my,

1314
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:11,590
in my clinical practice,
I'm not a couple's counselor and so,

1315
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:14,750
but sometimes when I'm working with 
someone,

1316
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,990
there's an issue that needs to be 
discussed with,

1317
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:19,070
with both people because otherwise it's 
just stupid.

1318
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:22,610
And one of the things I often recommend 
to people,

1319
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:24,133
especially once they have kids,
is that they set aside to use an 

1320
01:09:28,161 --> 01:09:30,410
anachronistic phrase,
date,

1321
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:32,030
date nights.
Well,

1322
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,400
everyone hates that idea.
Like they say,

1323
01:09:34,401 --> 01:09:35,270
well,
you know,

1324
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,180
they'll just say that I'm not doing 
that.

1325
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:40,310
That would be one objection.
We're just not doing that,

1326
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:41,413
you know,
that's what we did before we got 

1327
01:09:42,591 --> 01:09:43,840
married.
Um,

1328
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:46,101
they'll say,
well,

1329
01:09:46,101 --> 01:09:46,934
my partner would never go for that.
They've got a bunch of excuses why that 

1330
01:09:50,301 --> 01:09:54,380
isn't going to work.
And so I've heard all those excuses.

1331
01:09:54,381 --> 01:09:56,900
I know all of them,
and then maybe I convinced them,

1332
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:57,734
yeah,
yeah,

1333
01:09:57,770 --> 01:09:58,070
sure.

1334
01:09:58,070 --> 01:09:59,720
I know this is stupid.
It's awkward.

1335
01:09:59,721 --> 01:10:00,470
It's,
it's,

1336
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:04,700
it's a artificial that's okay,
just try it once.

1337
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:05,593
So then they go and try it and then they
come back and they say we had an 

1338
01:10:07,581 --> 01:10:09,380
absolutely miserable kind.
Really.

1339
01:10:09,381 --> 01:10:12,500
We had a miserable time.
We couldn't agree on what movie to go to

1340
01:10:12,501 --> 01:10:13,490
and then,
you know,

1341
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:15,720
she took me to her movie and I really 
didn't like it.

1342
01:10:15,721 --> 01:10:18,050
And so we fought all the way home.
We're never doing that again.

1343
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:19,753
And I say,
well really you've got 30 years for 100 

1344
01:10:22,791 --> 01:10:24,680
days,
that's 12,000 days.

1345
01:10:24,681 --> 01:10:26,540
Okay,
so you're not going to do that.

1346
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:27,433
You're going to spend the next 12,000 
days without having any real romantic 

1347
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:34,220
evenings and interactions with your 
spouse.

1348
01:10:34,221 --> 01:10:36,740
That's your plan.
And I liked doing,

1349
01:10:37,010 --> 01:10:38,780
I liked doing arithmetic with my 
clients.

1350
01:10:38,781 --> 01:10:43,430
Say they hate that hate or if it's like,
well no,

1351
01:10:43,431 --> 01:10:44,920
that sounds like a bad idea.

1352
01:10:45,010 --> 01:10:45,561
I said,
okay,

1353
01:10:45,561 --> 01:10:47,870
well would you like some romance in your
life?

1354
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:50,770
Are you just done with that?
I'll really like,

1355
01:10:50,870 --> 01:10:51,703
you know,
people can go for a long time with no 

1356
01:10:53,271 --> 01:10:54,650
romance at all.
Say,

1357
01:10:54,651 --> 01:10:56,960
well no,
maybe we'd like some of that.

1358
01:10:56,990 --> 01:10:59,980
Well how much once a year?
Well,

1359
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:01,580
no,
once a month.

1360
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:03,350
Well,
no,

1361
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:07,280
once every two weeks while sometimes 
people are really busy,

1362
01:11:07,281 --> 01:11:07,881
it's like,
okay,

1363
01:11:07,881 --> 01:11:11,210
that beats the hell out of zero.
Once a week,

1364
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:12,320
twice a week.
Okay.

1365
01:11:12,321 --> 01:11:13,550
Whatever.
We're gonna we're gonna.

1366
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,910
Start with a range.
Okay.

1367
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:16,133
What would a good evening look like?
Like if you could both get exactly what 

1368
01:11:19,051 --> 01:11:19,884
you wanted,

1369
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:22,053
what would it look like?
Well then they have to think about that 

1370
01:11:23,531 --> 01:11:24,364
because the previous theory was my 
stupid partner should know what I like 

1371
01:11:28,091 --> 01:11:30,160
and that's what their partner is 
thinking too.

1372
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:31,840
It's like good luck with that because 
no,

1373
01:11:31,841 --> 01:11:33,880
they don't have a clue.
Especially if they're men,

1374
01:11:33,881 --> 01:11:34,714
they don't have a clue.
So you have to tell them what you want 

1375
01:11:37,631 --> 01:11:40,180
and how they could deliver it and vice 
versa,

1376
01:11:40,181 --> 01:11:43,690
which is very awkward and horrible.
And then you have to practice it for six

1377
01:11:43,691 --> 01:11:44,524
months because you know what?
It takes a lot of practice to do 

1378
01:11:46,841 --> 01:11:51,010
something sophisticated really well and 
then if you do that it's like poof.

1379
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:54,790
You got it for the rest of your life.
So it's worth the aggravation.

1380
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:58,840
You know when the first time the rap 
puts its pop on the ladder,

1381
01:11:58,930 --> 01:12:01,210
it's just sort of doing it accidentally.

1382
01:12:01,630 --> 01:12:02,463
You can't expect it to do it well and 
that's exactly how to view your own 

1383
01:12:06,401 --> 01:12:08,230
progress and the progress of your 
partners.

1384
01:12:08,231 --> 01:12:12,780
Like let them do it badly for awhile.
At least they're doing it so.

1385
01:12:12,781 --> 01:12:14,350
And if you think they should do it 
faster,

1386
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:15,203
well look real hard and see how easy it 
is to change your own behavior because 

1387
01:12:18,071 --> 01:12:20,140
it's really hard to change your own 
behavior.

1388
01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:21,213
Everybody says I'm going to exercise 
three times a week and new year's and 

1389
01:12:23,771 --> 01:12:24,604
it's like no one does.
They bind the memberships and then they 

1390
01:12:27,491 --> 01:12:28,324
feel guilty for having them,
but they don't actually go to the gym 

1391
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:33,730
and that's a perfect example of how 
difficult it is to transform behavior.

1392
01:12:34,930 --> 01:12:35,763
Okay,
so back to the diagram here at 

1393
01:12:39,670 --> 01:12:41,530
expectation.
So

1394
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:45,323
the early models of expectation where 
cognitive models and the idea was that 

1395
01:12:48,331 --> 01:12:49,164
the rat makes a little model of the 
world and then he operates it in that 

1396
01:12:52,110 --> 01:12:56,340
world according to what he expects.
Now there's a problem with that model.

1397
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:57,233
There's a bunch of them.
The first is now we know that animals 

1398
01:12:59,191 --> 01:13:02,790
don't make comprehensive models of the 
world and that's a huge problem.

1399
01:13:03,210 --> 01:13:04,043
The problem is,
well,

1400
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:04,883
what did they get rid of and how,
but the way you get rid of that problem 

1401
01:13:07,561 --> 01:13:08,394
is that you introduced motivation into 
the equation and it's interesting 

1402
01:13:11,311 --> 01:13:12,144
because the behaviorist,
so I always thought of animals as blank 

1403
01:13:14,671 --> 01:13:18,630
slates and so they never really took 
motivation seriously as a contributor to

1404
01:13:18,631 --> 01:13:23,631
cognitive modeling,
but and it's also the case that probably

1405
01:13:24,001 --> 01:13:26,280
ever since the,
the enlightenment,

1406
01:13:26,281 --> 01:13:27,114
people have thought about emotion and 
motivation as forced as opposed to 

1407
01:13:30,391 --> 01:13:31,224
rationality.

1408
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:32,313
You know,
so you were rational in so far as you 

1409
01:13:33,361 --> 01:13:36,090
didn't let your emotions and your 
motivations influence you,

1410
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:38,220
but that's a.
that's a foolish theory.

1411
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:39,413
There are times when it's inappropriate 
for certain purposes to let certain 

1412
01:13:42,571 --> 01:13:44,880
motivations interfere with your 
observations,

1413
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:46,103
but generally speaking,
you never think about anything without 

1414
01:13:49,531 --> 01:13:51,390
being motivated.
Because why would you?

1415
01:13:52,110 --> 01:13:52,943
Like?
There's a trillion things you could 

1416
01:13:53,701 --> 01:13:54,900
think of and you're not going to think 
of.

1417
01:13:54,901 --> 01:13:55,734
Most of them.
You have to have a reason to think of 

1418
01:13:57,661 --> 01:13:58,494
them and the reason is is that while all
the time you're operating in some sort 

1419
01:14:01,561 --> 01:14:02,394
of motivational structure and you can 
sort of model them using the same kind 

1420
01:14:05,311 --> 01:14:09,420
of hierarchy that we used to model the 
personality as such.

1421
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,770
So I'll give you an example.

1422
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:19,600
So let's think of some basic motivations
and emotions.

1423
01:14:20,980 --> 01:14:21,813
Those are good categories by the way,
because there's no such thing as 

1424
01:14:24,341 --> 01:14:27,100
motivations and there's no such thing as
emotions.

1425
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:31,720
The things we loosely categorize into 
motivations and emotions each have their

1426
01:14:31,721 --> 01:14:32,554
own brain circuitry and so there are 
similarities between them and there are 

1427
01:14:36,371 --> 01:14:38,170
differences.
They're not clean categories,

1428
01:14:38,171 --> 01:14:39,004
but we're going to use the terminology 
anyways because we don't have a better 

1429
01:14:41,171 --> 01:14:42,004
one for my purposes.
You can roughly define a motivation as 

1430
01:14:46,841 --> 01:14:51,841
opposed to a emotion as a motivation is 
really something that establishes,

1431
01:14:52,690 --> 01:14:54,940
you could say a goal,
but it doesn't.

1432
01:14:54,941 --> 01:14:55,774
It establishes one of these.
It doesn't establish a goal and it 

1433
01:14:58,781 --> 01:15:01,690
doesn't drive behavior.
So what it does,

1434
01:15:01,691 --> 01:15:03,220
let's say you're hungry and it's 
nighttime.

1435
01:15:03,221 --> 01:15:04,054
You want to have a peanut butter center,
so imagine you're sitting there typing 

1436
01:15:06,131 --> 01:15:06,964
away and all of a sudden you this little
image of having something to eat creeps 

1437
01:15:11,711 --> 01:15:12,450
into your head.

1438
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:13,283
It's not usually quite specific.
It's there's something that you would 

1439
01:15:15,521 --> 01:15:17,300
like dig so you think,
oh,

1440
01:15:17,310 --> 01:15:21,370
I could really use some popcorn.
Let's say she typing away and the stupid

1441
01:15:21,371 --> 01:15:25,120
popcorn thing keeps popping up and 
finally you know,

1442
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:27,880
your whole body's starting to get into 
the popcorn and you think,

1443
01:15:27,881 --> 01:15:28,571
oh,
to hell with it.

1444
01:15:28,571 --> 01:15:29,404
I'll go make some popcorn.
And so what's happened is that your 

1445
01:15:32,381 --> 01:15:34,090
hypothalamus,
roughly speaking,

1446
01:15:34,091 --> 01:15:34,924
has,
is monitoring your internal body state 

1447
01:15:36,491 --> 01:15:38,920
and it thinks that you need some maybe 
need some salt,

1448
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:43,990
but maybe you need some folk and so it's
gonna start popping up,

1449
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:45,303
not a dry.
It's not like all of a sudden you're a 

1450
01:15:46,661 --> 01:15:47,430
robot,
you know,

1451
01:15:47,430 --> 01:15:52,430
like a popcorn and seeking robot and 
you're laying out your chained together.

1452
01:15:53,380 --> 01:15:57,130
I'm conditioned popcorn making and 
eating routines.

1453
01:15:57,131 --> 01:15:57,964
That isn't.
What happens is that what happens 

1454
01:15:59,771 --> 01:16:00,604
instead is that you start to envision a 
new state of being and that state of 

1455
01:16:04,811 --> 01:16:05,644
being has a goal which is you eating 
some popcorn and it has you where you 

1456
01:16:08,951 --> 01:16:09,784
are,
which is in an insufficient state of 

1457
01:16:11,090 --> 01:16:11,923
popcorn,
and then what's happening as well is 

1458
01:16:14,051 --> 01:16:15,430
that this,
the,

1459
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:16,713
the motor processes that you would use 
to implement that are also disinhibited 

1460
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:23,320
there.

1461
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:25,700
There you already know how to do it.
They get disinhibited,

1462
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:27,910
so or you could think of them as getting
primed.

1463
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:29,830
They're not,
they're getting disinhibited,

1464
01:16:29,831 --> 01:16:30,664
but you can think of it as being primed 
and at some point that becomes 

1465
01:16:33,551 --> 01:16:37,570
overwhelmingly overwhelming enough,
say pressure from the Hypothalamus,

1466
01:16:37,571 --> 01:16:40,120
which is really what's bloody well in 
control says,

1467
01:16:40,121 --> 01:16:40,780
yeah,
Yeah,

1468
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:45,780
enough like Internet surfing off to the 
popcorn and so you leap up and then what

1469
01:16:45,891 --> 01:16:46,724
do you do?
You reorient the way you're looking at 

1470
01:16:47,921 --> 01:16:48,754
the world.
Everything in the world becomes low 

1471
01:16:50,441 --> 01:16:51,274
resolution or even zero,
except those few things that are 

1472
01:16:54,551 --> 01:16:57,220
relevant to your new quest down the 
stairs.

1473
01:16:57,221 --> 01:16:59,050
You Go,
you find the right pen,

1474
01:16:59,110 --> 01:17:02,710
you find the popcorn getting irritated.
If you can't find it right,

1475
01:17:02,711 --> 01:17:03,544
because now you see it's interesting 
because your emotions align along your 

1476
01:17:07,031 --> 01:17:07,864
goals.
As long as you're pursuing a beeline to 

1477
01:17:10,761 --> 01:17:13,490
your goal and everything's laying itself
out,

1478
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:16,850
not as you expect,
but as you want,

1479
01:17:17,390 --> 01:17:20,540
then your emotions stay positive,
but as soon as something deviates,

1480
01:17:20,541 --> 01:17:21,680
then you're irritated.

1481
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:25,430
And the reason for that is that like 
let's say you can't find the popcorn pad

1482
01:17:26,150 --> 01:17:27,740
while your brain is computing.
Well,

1483
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:31,220
something like this.
This is obviously not how it works,

1484
01:17:31,221 --> 01:17:32,054
but it's an x amount of energy and 
matter from popcorn means it has x 

1485
01:17:37,041 --> 01:17:37,874
value.
If you expand a whole bunch of energy 

1486
01:17:40,581 --> 01:17:45,510
running around in your clueless state 
trying to acquire popcorn,

1487
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:46,373
you can easily get to the point where 
you've expended more energy and time 

1488
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:52,190
than the popcorn delivers.
And if you do that for a month,

1489
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:53,630
then you die.
So.

1490
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:54,993
So it's perfectly reasonable for you to 
get irritated when the path links to 

1491
01:17:58,461 --> 01:18:03,080
your destination increases radically.
And you might get even more irritated if

1492
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:05,240
you can't find any popcorn.
And then it's like,

1493
01:18:05,241 --> 01:18:06,074
oh no,
I have to dispense with the popcorn 

1494
01:18:07,881 --> 01:18:10,880
micro personality.
And it's all irritated because you know,

1495
01:18:10,881 --> 01:18:11,714
it sort of alive,
it's irritated that you have to squash 

1496
01:18:13,551 --> 01:18:14,384
it and then you have to come up with,
well maybe I could have a peanut butter 

1497
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:17,410
sandwich,
you know,

1498
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:18,343
pop up comes a new little micro 
personality that orients itself towards 

1499
01:18:21,771 --> 01:18:22,604
the goal.

1500
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:26,540
And so all the time you're doing that,
you're always in a motivated state.

1501
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:31,700
Now it's not a drive because it's not 
deterministic,

1502
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:33,163
but it does have a behavioral element.
You have all these [inaudible] and sub 

1503
01:18:36,231 --> 01:18:38,630
routines.
They're are stored in your body,

1504
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:39,464
you know,
all your,

1505
01:18:39,570 --> 01:18:40,403
your,
your body capacity or your skills and 

1506
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:44,413
you know which set of those you're 
likely to use if you're going to do x 

1507
01:18:47,421 --> 01:18:49,370
thing.
And so those get prepared.

1508
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:54,080
And then your perceptions,
real orient towards the new goal.

1509
01:18:54,081 --> 01:18:56,750
It's like a hunting goal.
You're fixated on it.

1510
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:00,410
Then your emotions orient long that.
So as long as things are going well,

1511
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:02,630
you're happy,
you're hopeful.

1512
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:04,490
Things are proceeding.
That's positive emotion,

1513
01:19:04,491 --> 01:19:05,060
that's dope.
Um,

1514
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:05,893
energetically mediated.
And if things aren't going well that 

1515
01:19:07,731 --> 01:19:08,960
it's either,
well,

1516
01:19:08,961 --> 01:19:09,794
it's any amount of negative emotion for 
mild irritation to like full blown 

1517
01:19:12,471 --> 01:19:13,304
temper tantrum.

1518
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:15,200
So,
so that's.

1519
01:19:15,470 --> 01:19:18,020
And you're okay now.
That's the simple story.

1520
01:19:19,640 --> 01:19:21,590
The complex story is,
okay,

1521
01:19:21,591 --> 01:19:23,210
you're hungry,
you're thirsty,

1522
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:24,920
you're tired,
you're hot,

1523
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,840
you're cold,
you're lonely,

1524
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,700
you need to play.
Okay?

1525
01:19:28,701 --> 01:19:30,980
So let's say you've got,
for the sake of argument,

1526
01:19:30,981 --> 01:19:33,920
let's say you have eight fundamental 
motivational systems.

1527
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:38,600
Now who cares how many?
It's a finite set under 20.

1528
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:41,000
It depends on whether you include anger,
is anger,

1529
01:19:41,001 --> 01:19:44,000
motivation or emotion is pain,
motivation or emotion?

1530
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:47,680
We don't care because they're not formal
categories.

1531
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,060
So anyways,
there's this,

1532
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:51,680
there's a,
there's a set number of them,

1533
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:56,330
and then so they have to run to 
satiation.

1534
01:19:57,050 --> 01:19:59,810
And so what satiation means is they set 
up an end state.

1535
01:20:00,260 --> 01:20:02,840
You perform the routines,
you achieve the end state,

1536
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,480
the system shuts down,
it's satiated.

1537
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:08,010
Now you'll experience that as 
satisfaction,

1538
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,100
not as pleasure.
Now you think,

1539
01:20:11,101 --> 01:20:12,090
well,
what's the difference?

1540
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:12,750
It's,
it's,

1541
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:13,583
it's,
it's,

1542
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:14,780
it's tight,
it's,

1543
01:20:14,930 --> 01:20:17,100
it's complicated.
But it's important.

1544
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:19,373
The kind of positive emotion that people
really like is associated with the 

1545
01:20:22,081 --> 01:20:25,470
search and the hope not with the 
acquiree,

1546
01:20:25,950 --> 01:20:27,690
because what happens when you acquire 
is,

1547
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:30,120
well,
you're no longer in this state,

1548
01:20:30,121 --> 01:20:32,630
which has a,
uh,

1549
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:36,060
an impulse to action in it.
But that's exciting.

1550
01:20:36,061 --> 01:20:36,880
That's fun.
You know,

1551
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:37,713
you're on the track of something.
It's like you're alive while you're 

1552
01:20:39,451 --> 01:20:41,460
searching for something,
but then you find it.

1553
01:20:41,461 --> 01:20:42,001
It's like,
good,

1554
01:20:42,001 --> 01:20:44,430
you need to find it,
but then the whole thing disappears.

1555
01:20:44,431 --> 01:20:46,260
And you're sitting there thinking,
well,

1556
01:20:46,261 --> 01:20:49,560
I've just graduated now what?
Right?

1557
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:51,270
Because that's what will happen when you
graduate.

1558
01:20:51,271 --> 01:20:51,811
It's like,
Hey,

1559
01:20:51,811 --> 01:20:53,460
you're a student,
you've got status,

1560
01:20:53,461 --> 01:20:57,120
you've got a,
you've got a hierarchy of values,

1561
01:20:57,121 --> 01:21:00,900
you've got a way of orienting yourself 
in the world and you have an identity.

1562
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,280
It's like,
so you're,

1563
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:03,960
you're in there and everybody's happy 
about it.

1564
01:21:03,961 --> 01:21:06,340
So then one day you graduates like 
success.

1565
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:07,950
Well,
really it was like,

1566
01:21:08,010 --> 01:21:09,330
poof,
that's gone.

1567
01:21:09,331 --> 01:21:10,164
And the next thing you know,
you're like handing out coffee at the 

1568
01:21:12,541 --> 01:21:15,260
local starbucks.
So what you're doing,

1569
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:16,103
you get the point.
You've experienced this all the time in 

1570
01:21:17,341 --> 01:21:18,570
your life.
You hit a pinnacle,

1571
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:21,780
you've attained something,
but the problem is is that

1572
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:26,670
now what?
You have to conjure up a whole new you,

1573
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:30,240
so some of it is sat satisfying,
you've accomplished the goal,

1574
01:21:30,241 --> 01:21:32,160
but some of it's just a big pain in the 
neck.

1575
01:21:32,161 --> 01:21:33,210
It's like,
oh,

1576
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:38,240
student me is disappeared and now it's 
frantically searching for employment me,

1577
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:43,470
and that means doesn't have the status 
and and it is in this space,

1578
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:46,350
a much more radical uncertainty,
so,

1579
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:47,483
so don't be thinking that getting that,
getting to where you want to go is what 

1580
01:21:50,671 --> 01:21:51,504
you want.

1581
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:55,500
What you want is to bloody well make 
sure that the voyage is worth it.

1582
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:59,430
Now and it's very interesting because 
people are really,

1583
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:00,593
really,
really wired up this way and I think 

1584
01:22:02,611 --> 01:22:04,770
it's because we're so radically 
exploratory,

1585
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:06,383
so when you're,
when you're proceeding towards a valued 

1586
01:22:09,961 --> 01:22:13,080
goal,
let's call that a cue,

1587
01:22:13,081 --> 01:22:17,250
that goal attainment is about to occur.
It's going to occur in some chain.

1588
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:20,700
A leads to b leads to c leads to d and 
so on.

1589
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:23,520
That's your like a hound on a trail.
It's,

1590
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:24,870
it's positive.
It's like,

1591
01:22:24,871 --> 01:22:25,670
yeah,
this is working.

1592
01:22:25,670 --> 01:22:26,431
Yeah.
This is working.

1593
01:22:26,431 --> 01:22:27,270
Yeah,
this is working.

1594
01:22:27,390 --> 01:22:29,370
That's positive.
It's moving you in hand,

1595
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:32,190
and that's really where you experienced 
a lot of your positive emotion.

1596
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:33,960
That's dope.
Up near GP mediated.

1597
01:22:34,290 --> 01:22:35,123
That's the system you'll kick with 
cocaine or any of the other drugs of 

1598
01:22:38,011 --> 01:22:42,000
abuse that people use that don't put 
anxiety.

1599
01:22:42,510 --> 01:22:46,320
It's a very,
very desirable motivational state.

1600
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:47,573
I read a while back,
somebody who said you can buy anything 

1601
01:22:50,281 --> 01:22:51,114
but you can't buy wanting anything,
and that's a staggeringly interesting 

1602
01:22:56,281 --> 01:22:57,660
comment because you think,
well,

1603
01:22:57,870 --> 01:23:01,380
you know he's wanting a positive state.
Well you don't have it,

1604
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:04,020
so that's kind of annoying and you 
think,

1605
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:05,230
well no,
I don't want to launch things.

1606
01:23:05,231 --> 01:23:06,370
I want to have them.
It's like,

1607
01:23:06,371 --> 01:23:09,130
yeah,
don't be so sure about that.

1608
01:23:10,210 --> 01:23:11,043
So one of the things,
one of the ways people have figured out 

1609
01:23:12,491 --> 01:23:13,324
how to deal with that is that they 
decided to want something that they 

1610
01:23:15,191 --> 01:23:16,024
can't get.
And that's actually extraordinarily 

1611
01:23:18,071 --> 01:23:20,670
smart and it's a deep archetypal idea.
So here,

1612
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:23,080
here's an example.
You've Seen Pinocchio,

1613
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,000
right?
Okay.

1614
01:23:25,030 --> 01:23:25,863
So Nokia was about a puppet marionette.
Does that mean someone else is pulling 

1615
01:23:29,561 --> 01:23:31,060
the strings?
Right?

1616
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:34,510
We don't know who,
sometimes it's virtually Satan himself.

1617
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:39,130
You remember the Stromboli?
There's another character just after him

1618
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:41,710
is the coachman,
the coachman.

1619
01:23:41,950 --> 01:23:46,450
He's like King of the thieves and he 
ends up pulling Pinocchio strikes.

1620
01:23:46,810 --> 01:23:47,643
So there's one scene in the Disney movie
where the coachman reveals himself and 

1621
01:23:52,061 --> 01:23:54,220
he's completely ready,
is really big teeth.

1622
01:23:54,490 --> 01:23:55,323
He's a,
he's a satanic figure and he scares the 

1623
01:23:56,861 --> 01:23:57,694
Fox and the cat who are like low level 
criminals who think they're bad but you 

1624
01:24:00,730 --> 01:24:02,440
know,
have never really met bad.

1625
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:04,300
He just scares that right into the 
corner.

1626
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:05,493
And so it's all of a sudden this person 
opens up and reveals the architect 

1627
01:24:08,261 --> 01:24:11,800
behind and then closes back down,
pulling Pinocchio strengths.

1628
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:14,230
Okay,
now he's a married man.

1629
01:24:14,290 --> 01:24:15,310
Well,
you know,

1630
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:18,790
the first question that arises is who's 
pulling your strings?

1631
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:22,240
And that's a really good question.
One of the things young said was,

1632
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:25,540
people don't have ideas.
Ideas have people.

1633
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:28,330
And you know,
you can think about that for about three

1634
01:24:28,331 --> 01:24:32,680
months and it should make you afraid the
whole time because as soon as you,

1635
01:24:32,890 --> 01:24:35,080
as soon as you,
as soon as you get that,

1636
01:24:35,081 --> 01:24:35,914
you think,
oh,

1637
01:24:36,940 --> 01:24:37,773
oh,
like let's say you're an idiot log of 

1638
01:24:38,981 --> 01:24:39,814
some sort,
because some of you probably are 

1639
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:45,490
Socialists Fascist environmentalist,
something that has just on the end.

1640
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:48,100
It's like you think those are your 
ideas.

1641
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:52,870
They're not your they're tools and 
that's fine.

1642
01:24:52,871 --> 01:24:55,360
If you want to be a tool of those ideas,
you go right ahead,

1643
01:24:55,361 --> 01:24:56,194
but you don't know where those ideas are
leading and they could well be leading 

1644
01:25:00,491 --> 01:25:01,750
somewhere.
You do not want to go.

1645
01:25:01,751 --> 01:25:02,584
Now the plus side is you don't have to 
take any responsibility for it because 

1646
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:05,673
you know you're just.
You're just drifting in an ocean of 

1647
01:25:07,781 --> 01:25:08,614
thought.
But one of the things that I learned 

1648
01:25:10,511 --> 01:25:11,344
from young was you should figure out 
just exactly which ideas are possessing 

1649
01:25:13,991 --> 01:25:14,824
you and then you should decide if those 
are your ideas and the probability that 

1650
01:25:18,521 --> 01:25:19,540
they are a zero.

1651
01:25:19,870 --> 01:25:23,200
They're not your ideas.
It's hard to have your own ideas.

1652
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:25,660
You have to derive them from your own 
experience,

1653
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:27,620
you know,
and when you,

1654
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:30,460
especially when you're not very old,
you don't have that much experience,

1655
01:25:30,461 --> 01:25:31,294
and so you can,
you can grab books full of ideas and 

1656
01:25:34,240 --> 01:25:37,180
claim them for your own,
which is not acceptable.

1657
01:25:37,540 --> 01:25:40,480
You can use those ideas to inform your 
ideas,

1658
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:43,720
but they're not your ideas.
You're just a puppet,

1659
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:45,093
you know,
in the Pinocchio movie is very 

1660
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:46,474
interesting that way because he's a 
puppet of forces that are really not on 

1661
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:51,160
his side.
Seriously.

1662
01:25:51,161 --> 01:25:53,020
No one on his side.
So.

1663
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:53,830
Okay.
Anyways,

1664
01:25:53,830 --> 01:25:56,560
back to the Pinocchio Movie.
Give me one sec.

1665
01:25:56,920 --> 01:25:59,980
So Japan doesn't have a son now.
Japan was a good guy,

1666
01:25:59,981 --> 01:26:00,651
right?
He said,

1667
01:26:00,651 --> 01:26:02,980
Tony Maker.
He's got this little warm cabin.

1668
01:26:03,050 --> 01:26:05,030
It's cozy.
He's a good guy,

1669
01:26:05,390 --> 01:26:07,100
he's friendly,
he has a little cat.

1670
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:09,920
He pays attention to his little fish.
She takes care of that.

1671
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:12,800
So we know Japan is a good guy and he 
makes this property.

1672
01:26:12,801 --> 01:26:14,810
Thanks band.
I've got a puppet,

1673
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:16,850
but maybe I'd rather have something 
real.

1674
01:26:17,060 --> 01:26:17,893
That's a good question for parents.
You want to pop it or do you want 

1675
01:26:20,721 --> 01:26:23,600
something real?
And answer is generally,

1676
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:26,480
often all just have a puppet as long as 
it does exactly what it.

1677
01:26:26,490 --> 01:26:27,323
Maybe it be a medical school puppet 
because that's certainly one good form 

1678
01:26:30,561 --> 01:26:33,540
of puppet.
So okay,

1679
01:26:33,541 --> 01:26:34,320
so Japan.
Oh,

1680
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:35,960
decides because he's a good guy.
He thinks,

1681
01:26:35,961 --> 01:26:36,261
no,
no,

1682
01:26:36,261 --> 01:26:39,170
I don't want this thing to have strings.
I want it to be its own thing.

1683
01:26:39,350 --> 01:26:41,660
I want it to be a tournament's 
individual.

1684
01:26:41,661 --> 01:26:42,740
Real.
Okay.

1685
01:26:42,741 --> 01:26:44,840
So what does he do?
He wishes,

1686
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:48,230
right?
What does he wish on a star?

1687
01:26:48,290 --> 01:26:51,200
Why do people wish on stars of all the 
crazy things?

1688
01:26:53,030 --> 01:26:54,230
Well,
it's a divine thing,

1689
01:26:54,231 --> 01:26:55,460
right?
It's a divine thing.

1690
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:57,140
It's like there's heaven.
It's all.

1691
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:58,273
It's the infinite.
You go out at night and you see the 

1692
01:27:00,651 --> 01:27:01,970
stars,
which you can't in the city,

1693
01:27:01,971 --> 01:27:06,380
but you go out somewhere dark and you 
see the stars and it's like it's you and

1694
01:27:06,381 --> 01:27:08,060
the infinite,
and it really is.

1695
01:27:08,330 --> 01:27:09,163
It's a perfect representation of your 
relationship with the infinite because 

1696
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:15,830
the university is about as an infant as 
you need,

1697
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:19,610
and it's going to give you a sense of 
awe and that's partly why archaic people

1698
01:27:19,611 --> 01:27:22,340
thought that God was in the sky.
It's like it's not.

1699
01:27:22,430 --> 01:27:24,080
They weren't stupid.
These people,

1700
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:28,630
they thought God is what fills you with 
awe.

1701
01:27:29,090 --> 01:27:31,520
So you look at the guy and you think,
wow,

1702
01:27:31,521 --> 01:27:35,570
you know,
that's something and it's an.

1703
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,720
It's an instinct.
It's not a cognitive construction.

1704
01:27:38,721 --> 01:27:39,554
So anyways,
you aim at it starts this twinkling 

1705
01:27:41,511 --> 01:27:42,770
thing in the darkness,
right?

1706
01:27:42,770 --> 01:27:45,260
It's the light in the darkness and it's 
above.

1707
01:27:45,950 --> 01:27:50,950
It's above the worldly environment.
It's something transcendent,

1708
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:53,380
and so that's what you better wishes on.
It's like,

1709
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:57,080
I'm going to aim high.
That's what he says.

1710
01:27:57,110 --> 01:27:58,790
Aim High and he thinks,
well,

1711
01:27:58,791 --> 01:28:00,980
it's not very likely,
but I might as well aim high.

1712
01:28:01,730 --> 01:28:06,080
That's a very good piece of advice.
You want to aim so high you can't attain

1713
01:28:06,081 --> 01:28:08,380
it because then you've got something 
worth it might be.

1714
01:28:08,390 --> 01:28:09,223
Think that's such perverse.
That's such a perverse per piece of 

1715
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:13,033
advice.
It's why would you chase something you 

1716
01:28:14,031 --> 01:28:15,620
can't have?
Well,

1717
01:28:15,621 --> 01:28:16,454
the answer might be because of the 
chasing is worth it and then you might 

1718
01:28:21,231 --> 01:28:21,621
think,
well,

1719
01:28:21,621 --> 01:28:22,580
what's worth it?
Well,

1720
01:28:22,581 --> 01:28:27,290
I can give you a hint about that too.
It's like develop your character because

1721
01:28:27,291 --> 01:28:29,960
what you've got is what you carry with 
you wherever you go,

1722
01:28:30,590 --> 01:28:34,820
and it's way better to be able to do 
things than to be rich because if you're

1723
01:28:34,821 --> 01:28:36,710
rich,
well then that disappears.

1724
01:28:36,710 --> 01:28:37,543
Poof,
you're poor.

1725
01:28:37,790 --> 01:28:38,623
But if you can do things short of being 
demolished and even then people are 

1726
01:28:42,681 --> 01:28:44,330
unbelievable and overcoming those 
things.

1727
01:28:44,331 --> 01:28:47,660
It's like you're.
You're on the way.

1728
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:51,200
Here's an interesting experiment we did 
with with undergraduate women,

1729
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:54,740
so there's this idea in evolutionary 
psychology.

1730
01:28:55,610 --> 01:28:59,360
It's called hyperthermia and 
Hyperthermia is the tendency of women to

1731
01:28:59,361 --> 01:29:02,790
choose mates who are slightly older than
them on it's about four years on average

1732
01:29:02,791 --> 01:29:07,791
cross culturally and who are higher in 
the status hierarchy than they are.

1733
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:09,593
Okay?
It's very well documented tendency and 

1734
01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:16,410
people who are cynical about that think 
women want wealth and I thought,

1735
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,180
well,
it's not a bad theory because it kind of

1736
01:29:18,181 --> 01:29:20,820
evens the scales.
It's like you're going to have a family,

1737
01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:21,803
you're basically a chimpanzee baby 
clings to its mother's for for 5,000 

1738
01:29:27,481 --> 01:29:28,314
miles in the,
in the three or four years that it's 

1739
01:29:30,121 --> 01:29:30,930
doing the clinging.

1740
01:29:30,930 --> 01:29:32,670
It's like it's a major league 
impediment,

1741
01:29:33,030 --> 01:29:34,380
you know,
and if you're a new mother,

1742
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:35,933
your,
your life is so much more complicated 

1743
01:29:37,711 --> 01:29:38,544
than it is when you're a single that 
it's not even the same conceptual 

1744
01:29:40,831 --> 01:29:41,664
universe.
It's a major league responsibility and 

1745
01:29:45,211 --> 01:29:47,070
it slows you down.
So then you might think,

1746
01:29:47,071 --> 01:29:47,904
well the logical thing to do would be to
balance the scales a little bit and 

1747
01:29:50,071 --> 01:29:51,570
that's perfectly reasonable.
But I thought,

1748
01:29:51,571 --> 01:29:53,250
Nah,
I bet your women are smarter than that.

1749
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:54,773
I bet you can fool them.
And the pickup artists do that all the 

1750
01:29:57,811 --> 01:30:02,420
time because they mimic status.
So you,

1751
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,380
you can follow them,
but they're not.

1752
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:06,060
They're smart.
So what we did,

1753
01:30:06,630 --> 01:30:08,640
I never published this be for a bunch of
reasons,

1754
01:30:08,641 --> 01:30:10,740
but okay.
So what we did was we took,

1755
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:13,130
we took pictures of the same guy,
you know,

1756
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:14,970
just kind of an average looking.
He's all right.

1757
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:20,430
And we had four stories about them and 
one story was a poor,

1758
01:30:20,431 --> 01:30:22,590
useless guy.
That's an easy story,

1759
01:30:22,591 --> 01:30:23,424
right?
You know,

1760
01:30:23,610 --> 01:30:25,590
sits on his couch,
plays video games.

1761
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:27,390
Each cheetos covered with dust.
