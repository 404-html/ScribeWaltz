1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:00,903
Special privileges for me to welcome all
of you to fins first event besides 

2
00:00:04,541 --> 00:00:05,374
illusion,
challenging the way we see marine 

3
00:00:06,581 --> 00:00:07,414
sustainability is also my great pleasure
to welcome our two speakers this 

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,960
evening,
Dr.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,320
Arthur Hanson and Dr.
Jordan Peterson.

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:15,723
I'll be speaking a little bit more about
each of these gentlemen later on in the 

7
00:00:18,191 --> 00:00:19,310
program.
Um,

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,950
but what I would like to say now is from
my experience working with Dr.

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,830
Peterson and from what I've seen and 
heard about Dr.

10
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:29,320
Arthur Hansen is there to true 
renaissance men.

11
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:31,660
And we are very excited to have him here
this evening.

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,970
So before I get to our speakers,
I'm going to tell you a little bit about

13
00:00:36,971 --> 00:00:37,804
Finn.
Finn is not your conventional 

14
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,713
environmental organization.
All of our executive members have a 

15
00:00:43,991 --> 00:00:47,620
background in psychology as opposed to 
engineering,

16
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:48,483
environmental studies or biology.
Now this leads to some special benefits 

17
00:00:52,931 --> 00:00:53,764
that we have.
I'm going to tell you about three 

18
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:59,380
different,
oh well the special benefits are that,

19
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,100
um,
we can use our knowledge of the brain,

20
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:03,963
emotion and behavior to develop 
innovative angles on how to publicize 

21
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:09,694
the problem of marine life decimation.
So I'm going to tell you about three 

22
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:13,564
different psychological concepts that 
we've tried to integrate into our 

23
00:01:16,691 --> 00:01:19,120
advertising over the past couple of 
months.

24
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:22,863
So the first is that images of cute 
animals induced positive emotion and 

25
00:01:26,681 --> 00:01:27,514
narrow attentional focus.
That's probably not what you were 

26
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:37,460
expecting to see fred.
The fish doesn't quite do it for you,

27
00:01:37,461 --> 00:01:41,840
does he?
So we had to be a little bit creative.

28
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:42,674
We had to approach this problem that 
fish and their appearance don't really 

29
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,730
draw that fuzzy emotion from you that 
you really want to help them out.

30
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:56,440
That's probably a lot better.
So we took the approach that if,

31
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,283
I don't know if any of you have pets,
but you knew that when their food bowls 

32
00:02:02,241 --> 00:02:03,800
bull,
they're pretty happy.

33
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,960
Now if you take that food away,
like for example,

34
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:12,380
if fish were to suddenly be gone,
which is one of their food sources,

35
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,630
not so happy,
now you add a slogan to it and there you

36
00:02:17,631 --> 00:02:19,370
go.
That's one of our first advertisements.

37
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,323
So the second concept that I'm going to 
go over is one that we've actually 

38
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,950
borrowed from social psychology 
research.

39
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,890
And that's something that's called the 
door in the face technique.

40
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,253
So the gist of this technique is that 
you initially make a large request from 

41
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:40,340
an individual that's probably going to 
be shut down.

42
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:43,923
Okay?

43
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,070
That's probably going to be the answer 
that you're going to get.

44
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,430
So then you follow up this request with 
a much smaller,

45
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:54,460
more reasonable one.
So the behind that is that an individual

46
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:04,990
is more likely to agree to the second 
more reasonable request.

47
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,213
What is preceded by an outlandish one 
versus has it had it been asked on its 

48
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:11,404
own?
So the final concept that I'm going to 

49
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:15,484
go over,
it's going to require a little bit of 

50
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:17,614
background knowledge,
which I'm going to discuss and it's an 

51
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:20,764
angle that we decided to take about the 
health benefits that you receive when 

52
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:26,590
you ingest fish or possibly fish oil.

53
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,440
Now I imagine that many of you know who 
this is.

54
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:33,660
This is Tsai.
Uh,

55
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,550
he's best known for his dancing Gangnam 
style.

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,833
If you don't know him,
you can ask your students on Monday or 

57
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:43,330
potentially your children tonight.
They're very familiar with him.

58
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:47,860
So gangnam style is essentially a,
well,

59
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:52,180
it refers to a district in Seoul,
South Korea,

60
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,853
and the people who live there,
they have a very affluent lifestyle and 

61
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:58,690
they achieve this wealth pretty much 
overnight.

62
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,680
They didn't exactly have to work for.
So because of this,

63
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,233
it's often related to this aphorism with
great power comes great responsibility 

64
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:10,683
because of the fact that they didn't 
have to work for their wealth and it 

65
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:13,264
came overnight.
They don't really have a sense of their 

66
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:15,694
social responsibility.
So we decided to take this and related 

67
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:22,060
to fish.
When it comes to eating fish,

68
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:22,923
we're all live in Gangnam style.
Basically what this means is that we 

69
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:30,400
were born into a world that has oceans 
that were for this great resource.

70
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:32,500
It was,
we were rich with fish,

71
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:36,640
but because of this we didn't really 
develop at the same time,

72
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:40,840
that sense of responsibility that we 
have to maintain our oceans and maintain

73
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:42,250
their since sustainability.

74
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,383
So now to the psychological concept is 
the offer is and that we decided to use 

75
00:04:49,681 --> 00:04:52,290
it wasn't enough.
We wanted to take it one step further.

76
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,120
That's what we're always doing are 
really,

77
00:04:54,121 --> 00:04:57,990
really pushing.
So when you eat fish it helps with early

78
00:04:57,991 --> 00:05:01,650
brain development and the prevention or 
treatment of brain related problems.

79
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,143
So again,
referring to the food chain like we did 

80
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,150
before,
how cats they fish.

81
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:11,390
We had to think who really wants a good 
healthy brain zombies Zambizi brains and

82
00:05:14,911 --> 00:05:17,940
they want them to be good as opposed to 
unhealthy.

83
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,510
And we're lucky because in Toronto we 
have a lot of zombies.

84
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,340
So you add that to the fact that people 
like to dance Gangnam style.

85
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,270
And now just to summarize and make sure 
that you're following me,

86
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,560
I have zombies who need good brains and 
because of that they need fish.

87
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,873
You add that to dancing gangnam style.
You add that to the aphorism that we 

88
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:41,764
developed about fish and uh,
how we're all living Gangnam style and 

89
00:05:47,351 --> 00:05:49,660
the next logical progression that we 
were going to do.

90
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,810
Zombies dancing,
gangam style,

91
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,910
growing fish shirts with the catch 
phrase at the end.

92
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,610
Now you'd be surprised to know that we 
were actually beating to the punch.

93
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,620
There was already a Zombie,
the dances,

94
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:01,454
Gangnam style and he does a pretty good 
Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley as 

95
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,100
well.
So we had to we this idea,

96
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,580
but on a serious,
no.

97
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,623
Um,
this truly has been one of the most 

98
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:17,420
rewarding but challenging projects I've 
had the opportunity to work on.

99
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:18,943
You soon learn that one 10th of the 
battle is pulling together the correct 

100
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:22,574
data.
The rest is communication and finding 

101
00:06:24,531 --> 00:06:25,364
ways to make people listen.
Something that I quickly learned while 

102
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:29,474
growing up and trying to get my parents 
to see things my way is that everyone 

103
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:33,734
has a different perspective and way of 
communicating that we all may speak a 

104
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:37,664
particular language when it comes to 
explaining a problem or inspiring 

105
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:41,774
action.
Different things make sense and push 

106
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:44,534
different people.
For some it is art such as image or 

107
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:48,734
dance.
For others as it is an equation or a 

108
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:54,410
graph.
For some it is comedy and even others.

109
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,453
Reading and logic is fin school to use 
all of these mediums to raise public 

110
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:01,730
awareness about the decimation of marine
life.

111
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,493
Then with the help with every believer,
we want to inspire change in Canada's 

112
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:07,454
ocean management policy.
Now this is something that we do not 

113
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:15,311
plan to do by ourselves either.
We hope to create links not only between

114
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:17,540
departments within the University of 
Toronto,

115
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,793
but also between all forms of 
postsecondary institutions across 

116
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:22,064
Canada,
the arts and design schools as well as 

117
00:07:24,561 --> 00:07:27,740
science and research institutions.
In this way,

118
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,520
we can reach out not only to communities
geographically across Canada,

119
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,370
but also to the communities of 
likeminded reasoning.

120
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,273
So on that note,
I would like to introduce now our first 

121
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:42,080
speaker,
Dr.

122
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,913
Jordan Peterson.
He earned his phd in psychology at 

123
00:07:46,461 --> 00:07:47,294
Mcgill University and following his post
doctor doctoral fellowship at Mcgill's 

124
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:51,643
Douglas Hospital,
served as a professor of psychology at 

125
00:07:53,991 --> 00:07:56,240
Harvard.
Four years later,

126
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,133
he came to the University of Toronto 
where he is a professor with two main 

127
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:00,824
areas of study,
the psychology of belief and the 

128
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:05,270
assessment and improvement of 
personality.

129
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,093
His work has been supported by all three
of the main Canadian granting agencies 

130
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,820
as well as the Rotman Business School 
Center for integrative thinking.

131
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,223
He has authored and coauthored over 70 
scientific articles including one book 

132
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,400
maps of meaning the architecture of 
belief and soon to be a second 42 Dr.

133
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,550
Peterson holds multiple order and 
teaching awards,

134
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,503
including a nomination for the Levinson 
teaching prize at a Harvard in 1998 and 

135
00:08:33,771 --> 00:08:34,604
nominations by Tvo as one of Ontario's 
best university lectures each year from 

136
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:43,940
2005 to 2008 in addition to his clinical
practice,

137
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,430
Dr.
Peterson serves as a business consultant

138
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:51,350
and executive coach for senior partners 
of large law firms in Toronto and is the

139
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:54,800
vice president of a personality 
assessment and remediation company.

140
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,303
He's also a frequent guest panelist on 
Tvo is the agenda and a popular source 

141
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:03,330
of information for other TV shows,
radio programs,

142
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:04,164
and printed articles.
Please welcome a man who through the 

143
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,830
years has inspired thousands of students
to pursue their dreams and instilled the

144
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:14,010
belief and the members of fin that we 
can accomplish anything,

145
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,870
so why not immediately started trying

146
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,980
[inaudible] thanks Christine.

147
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,273
Anyways,
it looks to me like that's what we're 

148
00:09:40,361 --> 00:09:45,361
facing over the next few decades.
It's kind of an evocative phrase.

149
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,990
This,
he seems empty anyways because of course

150
00:09:49,991 --> 00:09:51,850
you can't see what's beneath the 
surface,

151
00:09:51,851 --> 00:09:56,851
but before the depredations of people,
it was an amazing resource.

152
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,150
I started to learn about this and I'm 
going to walk you through what I learned

153
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:05,984
because I think it's a reasonable way of
introducing everyone to the basic 

154
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:16,180
elements of familiarity that are 
necessary to understand what's happening

155
00:10:16,341 --> 00:10:20,660
in the oceans.
I guess sometimes I've noticed that it's

156
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:21,494
useful when you're teaching people not 
to know a lot more than your audience 

157
00:10:24,861 --> 00:10:27,920
does because if you start to develop 
great expertise in an area,

158
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:31,580
then you forget what people don't know 
and it's easy to speak about things that

159
00:10:31,581 --> 00:10:34,340
aren't easy to fall on.
You shouldn't have any problem with that

160
00:10:34,341 --> 00:10:38,210
tonight because as I said,
I'm a relative beginner in this area and

161
00:10:38,211 --> 00:10:41,540
a lot of the things I learned were 
really quite obvious things,

162
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,730
especially in retrospect,
but,

163
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,980
um,
I didn't know them.

164
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,473
I got an opportunity to start 
familiarizing myself with this 

165
00:10:50,391 --> 00:10:51,224
particular issue because I was fortunate
enough to work with the Canadian 

166
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,630
subcommittee,
um,

167
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:57,923
that the secretary general of the UN set
up about three years ago on the 

168
00:11:01,371 --> 00:11:05,090
secretary general was interested in 
producing a report and this is the final

169
00:11:05,091 --> 00:11:05,540
report.

170
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,373
Resilient people are resilient planet.
And it was sort of a followup to the 

171
00:11:09,171 --> 00:11:10,004
1992 Brundtland Commission,
which was the first real worldwide 

172
00:11:13,971 --> 00:11:18,230
attempt to bring some order and 
intelligence to ecological issues,

173
00:11:18,231 --> 00:11:19,064
some with a certain degree of success.
Now that was followed up in Brazil in 

174
00:11:23,301 --> 00:11:26,870
2012 with an ecological slash economic 
meeting.

175
00:11:26,871 --> 00:11:31,850
That wasn't precisely a raving success,
but this was the document that served as

176
00:11:31,851 --> 00:11:35,360
lead up to the 2012 20th anniversary of 
the,

177
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,433
of the Brundtland Commission.
And the reason I was asked to serve on 

178
00:11:39,411 --> 00:11:41,900
this committee was because the people 
who ran it,

179
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,840
it was headed by Jim ball silly who ran 
Raymond Corporation.

180
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,093
The people who ran it didn't think that 
the underlying narrative of the report 

181
00:11:51,321 --> 00:11:54,160
was appropriate for the modern day.
In some sense it,

182
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:56,800
it sort of felt like it had been written
in 1984,

183
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:58,900
which is actually quite a long time ago 
now.

184
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,213
Um,
there was a lot of north versus south 

185
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:03,220
ideology in it.

186
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,413
Um,
an ideology that's less relevant now 

187
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:06,604
that the less developed world is 
developing at an incredible rate and 

188
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,503
there was a lot of left versus right 
ideology and it when it seems more 

189
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,524
appropriate in the modern world to know 
that problems of this magnitude have to 

190
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:21,040
be solved by everyone regardless of 
their political orientation.

191
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,773
And,
uh,

192
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:28,020
there was a lot of underlying the 
underlying implicit idea that the planet

193
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,670
would be better off without the people 
on it,

194
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:34,300
which is not a position that I hold and 
I,

195
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:36,910
which I also think is a dangerous one to
promote.

196
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,660
And so I had the opportunity to rephrase
the underlying structure of the document

197
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:45,634
to some degree,
to the degree that that's possible when 

198
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,870
you're working with multiple committees,
but,

199
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:53,230
but at least in part to stress some of 
the really great things that people have

200
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,480
accomplished over the last two decades.

201
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,010
And I want to start with that because 
it's necessary to put things in context.

202
00:13:00,011 --> 00:13:00,844
You know,
I mean,

203
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,670
we're assaulted by apocalypse is all the
time.

204
00:13:03,671 --> 00:13:06,760
I mean,
I'm 50 years old now and I mean I can,

205
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,653
I've lived through at least five 
probable apocalypse is none of which 

206
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,423
thankfully it occurred.
And the problem with that is that it's 

207
00:13:14,831 --> 00:13:15,664
easy to get apocalypse overdose and in a
sense and to feel that you're assaulted 

208
00:13:20,711 --> 00:13:21,544
by catastrophes from so many directions 
that the only logical thing to do is to 

209
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:25,504
ignore them.
Now I don't think that's true because 

210
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,953
people have been getting their act 
together in multiple dimensions and 

211
00:13:31,481 --> 00:13:34,960
quite remarkable weights.
And so I'll detail some of those.

212
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:40,350
In 1970 approximately 900 of the 3.5
billion people currently alive,

213
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:42,274
we're hungry.
The same number were hungry in 2008 

214
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,953
however,
the population had doubled during that 

215
00:13:48,881 --> 00:13:49,510
period.

216
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:53,770
So the proportion of hungry people have 
during the most rapid expansion of human

217
00:13:53,771 --> 00:13:56,740
population in history.
That's pretty remarkable.

218
00:13:56,741 --> 00:13:57,574
And it's not what people pr predicted 
because the most dire environmental 

219
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,073
estimates in the late 1960s were 
predicated on the idea that by the year 

220
00:14:06,161 --> 00:14:06,994
2000,
with the six or 7 billion people that 

221
00:14:08,771 --> 00:14:11,670
were likely to be around it,
there would be widespread starvation.

222
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:12,963
Quite the contrary.
People are better fed than they ever 

223
00:14:14,651 --> 00:14:15,520
have been.
In fact,

224
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,310
there are more obese people in the world
now than there are hungry people,

225
00:14:18,311 --> 00:14:21,490
which is really some kind of 
accomplishment even though it's,

226
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,920
you know,
damning in a sense with faint praise.

227
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,513
Um,
in 1981 about 52% of the world's 

228
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:32,020
population,
2 billion of 4.5

229
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:37,140
lived under the new World Bank,
poverty cutoff estimates of a dollar and

230
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,850
quarter a day.
By 2005,

231
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:40,684
that finger had decreased to 25% and 
current estimates indicate that this 

232
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:49,240
figure is moving down where it's at 2% 
of the total world population per year,

233
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,940
assuming one point percent which is 
conservative,

234
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:58,210
the percentage below the poverty cutoff 
by now may have fallen to 15%.

235
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,133
So that's a staggering achievement.
The proportion of people living in 

236
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:03,704
poverty in East Asian Pacific has 
decreased by more than 50% since 1990 

237
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:11,390
and this after rates and already have in
the previous two decades,

238
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,613
lifespan has increased dramatically.
We have the spectacle in Africa now 

239
00:15:16,251 --> 00:15:17,084
where I read the economist a week and a 
half ago that there are enough cell 

240
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:22,880
phones in Africa now so that three out 
of four people have them.

241
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:27,110
And that's brought tremendous economic 
advantages to the people of Africa,

242
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,993
a contributing part to the fact,
which is almost impossible to believe 

243
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:35,900
that the sub Saharan African countries 
are now the fastest growing economies in

244
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:36,734
the world.
And so we're actually in a position 

245
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:39,524
maybe for the first time in human 
history where the only reason for 

246
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:42,344
starvation and hunger is political.
So there's also been a staggering 

247
00:15:47,061 --> 00:15:47,894
decrease in the number of antidem 
democratic or totalitarian states over 

248
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:52,160
the last 30 years.

249
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:57,230
And it's partly because in some sense 
the whole idea of totalitarianism,

250
00:15:57,231 --> 00:16:00,440
whether it's on the left or the right,
has lost its essential validity.

251
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:01,723
Even the dictators themselves don't 
believe in there in the justifications 

252
00:16:04,521 --> 00:16:06,650
they put forward for their abuse of 
power.

253
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:07,723
And so what we've seen happening is 
horrible governments toppling one after 

254
00:16:11,151 --> 00:16:13,670
another,
which really a miraculous rate,

255
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,460
you know,
and that's all on top of the collapse of

256
00:16:16,461 --> 00:16:17,294
the Soviet Union and the demolition of 
the Iron Curtain and all these things 

257
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:25,430
that for someone my age seem absolutely 
miraculous,

258
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,293
not,
not dimension of course the opening up 

259
00:16:27,441 --> 00:16:29,660
of China.
So you know,

260
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,530
three cheers for the human race,
it's pretty damn good that we've managed

261
00:16:33,531 --> 00:16:35,930
to put those sorts of successes 
together.

262
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,793
Mean the UN had a millennium goal in 
2000 to cut poverty in the world by 

263
00:16:40,371 --> 00:16:41,204
half,
by 2015 they figured they hit that by 

264
00:16:43,131 --> 00:16:47,780
2011 so you know,
these things or just any,

265
00:16:47,781 --> 00:16:48,614
any,
any person with any sense would regard 

266
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:51,880
that fundamentally as miraculous.

267
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,713
It's,
it's massive economic productivity 

268
00:16:55,221 --> 00:16:58,250
increases combined with massive 
population increases.

269
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:00,530
I mean,
so you know,

270
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:06,280
it's not all gloomy and so the UN and 
the initial UN report had virtually none

271
00:17:06,381 --> 00:17:08,660
of that in there.
I think that's a real mistake.

272
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:10,490
You don't,
because human beings,

273
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,653
you know,
we've got waste management problems and 

274
00:17:12,921 --> 00:17:14,940
there's a lot of us and we eat a lot.
But you know,

275
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,290
we're also trying as hard as we can to 
put things together as fast as we can.

276
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,610
You know,
all things considered,

277
00:17:19,611 --> 00:17:22,640
there's always unreasonable people.
But you know,

278
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,743
for a bunch of creatures that only 
separated from chimpanzees 7 million 

279
00:17:27,141 --> 00:17:27,861
years ago,
you know,

280
00:17:27,861 --> 00:17:28,694
we're not doing that bad.
We didn't even understand oceanic be 

281
00:17:31,581 --> 00:17:33,140
called the g at all,
you know,

282
00:17:33,141 --> 00:17:36,020
for acceptance into the last hundred 
years.

283
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,380
So we are trying to learn things as fast
as we can.

284
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,333
So you know,
credit where credit's due and there's a 

285
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:43,850
lot of credit do.

286
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:49,160
And it's also really important not to 
make the case that everything's terrible

287
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,770
because it's,
it's a,

288
00:17:50,771 --> 00:17:53,670
it's a low resolution,
thoughtless case,

289
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:54,893
you know,
when you have to concentrate on things 

290
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,410
and differentiate between them.
So you know,

291
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,244
the difference between things that are 
problems and things that aren't because 

292
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:02,694
of everything's a problem.
Well you might as well just sit at home 

293
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:07,020
and drink gin because there's nothing 
you can do about it.

294
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,450
But you know,
the truth of the matter is,

295
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:13,200
is that when we put our minds together,
we can actually fix things pretty fast.

296
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,423
And part of the necessity that precedes 
fixing things is to become informed 

297
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:18,864
enough so that you understand at least 
to some minimal degree what you're 

298
00:18:20,881 --> 00:18:21,714
talking about.
So I'm hoping that to some minimal 

299
00:18:23,821 --> 00:18:25,560
degree,
I know what I'm talking about him.

300
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,930
If I'm not,
I'm hoping that Arthur Hansen,

301
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:32,931
who's a real expert on these matters,
will correct me so well,

302
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:34,740
what's still bad in the world?

303
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,770
Well,
corruption still bad and it's a,

304
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,650
it's a cause of suffering that's 
definitely under addressed,

305
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:41,484
I think often for political reasons.
And there's no doubt that we have a 

306
00:18:44,071 --> 00:18:46,680
pollution problem.
And I would say that's basically a waste

307
00:18:46,681 --> 00:18:47,514
management problem.
It's the kind of problem that faces 

308
00:18:49,231 --> 00:18:53,190
really it a any creature because all 
creatures have to deal with their waste.

309
00:18:53,191 --> 00:18:54,024
And of course,
maybe we produce a bit more of it than 

310
00:18:55,741 --> 00:18:58,500
we should because we're pretty smart and
we build lots of things.

311
00:18:58,501 --> 00:18:59,334
But you know,
it is part and parcel of living in a 

312
00:19:01,561 --> 00:19:06,030
universe where the primary forces 
thermodynamic deterioration,

313
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,950
you know,
it's a hell of a thing to fight.

314
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:12,600
So it's not because we're innately evil 
that we produce byproducts.

315
00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:16,500
It's because life is very complex and 
difficult to sustain and we want to live

316
00:19:16,501 --> 00:19:17,334
longer.
No wonder and we'd rather than everyone 

317
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:20,400
didn't suffer any more than they had to.

318
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,060
And that's probably a good thing too.
So we've got our reasons.

319
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,150
However,
when I was going through all of this,

320
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,790
you know,
there was a couple of things that really

321
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:34,020
stuck out for me and one of them was the
oceanic problem because,

322
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,330
well,
there was a bunch of reasons.

323
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,283
The first was because I thought the data
indicating that what we were doing was 

324
00:19:40,951 --> 00:19:41,784
damaging was really in controvertible as
opposed to many of the issues that you 

325
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:49,740
hear about from time to time or maybe 
constantly,

326
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:50,843
it's very,
very clear that we're overfishing and 

327
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,623
overfishing dramatically and that we're 
doing other things to the oceanic 

328
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,124
environment that are definitely not in 
our medium or longterm interest to say 

329
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:04,074
nothing about the creatures themselves.
I also thought that oceanic the oceanic 

330
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:08,874
management problem was an appropriate 
problem to consider from a more 

331
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:14,040
practical perspective.
I mean,

332
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,100
I thought a lot about global warming and
um,

333
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,420
I'm not going to talk much about global 
warming because that isn't what I'm here

334
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:22,080
to talk about.

335
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,913
But one of the things I did realize 
about global warming rapidly was that 

336
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,623
the error in the estimates of the likely
warming of the planet over the next 60 

337
00:20:31,801 --> 00:20:32,634
years are so large,
even if they're done by the best 

338
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:38,370
scientists,
they're so large that even if we stopped

339
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:41,160
using anything that produced carbon 
dioxide now,

340
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,950
we would never know if that actually 
helped.

341
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,110
And when I looked at that,
I thought,

342
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:46,944
well,
how in the world are you going to sell 

343
00:20:47,591 --> 00:20:50,170
something like that?
Even if it works,

344
00:20:50,171 --> 00:20:52,390
you can't tell if it worked.
Plus,

345
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:56,230
you know that the time course of 
improvement is over multiple decades and

346
00:20:56,231 --> 00:21:01,231
everyone uses hydro carbon energy.
So it's a real killer to try to address.

347
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:05,560
It seemed to me that it was more logical
in some ways to focus on problems.

348
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:06,394
It had a shorter horizon and some what 
more immediate returns because that way 

349
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:11,704
you can tell if all the effort that 
you're putting into solving the problem 

350
00:21:14,501 --> 00:21:15,334
is actually having some sort of positive
consequence and the oceanic management 

351
00:21:18,851 --> 00:21:20,500
problems seem to fit into that too.

352
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,333
It was wasn't intractable,
it wasn't a problem that was rapidly 

353
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:28,750
disappearing on its own.
Like world poverty seems to be,

354
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,703
I don't think you could speed that up 
and the disappearance of poverty any 

355
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:35,500
more than it's been sped up,
it's sorta hit maximum improvement.

356
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:36,723
So it's sort of falls into the category 
of solvable problem with potentially 

357
00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:42,850
proper interventions.
The other thing is,

358
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:45,940
as far as I can tell,
there's no losers to fixing this.

359
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,470
You know,
the,

360
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:48,304
the oceanic mismanagement problem is of 
such magnitude with the exception of 

361
00:21:52,721 --> 00:21:56,890
certain species that if we keep up our 
rate of fishing for the next 20 years,

362
00:21:56,891 --> 00:21:58,930
there's not going to be an awful lot 
left.

363
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:02,800
And that's not going to be very good for
the large corporations that you know,

364
00:22:02,801 --> 00:22:03,634
that,
that make their economic living off the 

365
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:06,724
oceans.
And it's can be a real hard on us if we 

366
00:22:07,871 --> 00:22:08,704
want to eat.

367
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,880
And then of course there's the loss of 
the beauty and the diversity and,

368
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,013
and also the potential to truly 
transform the nature of the ecosystems 

369
00:22:17,561 --> 00:22:19,960
of the ocean in a way that really won't 
be good.

370
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,123
I mean,
our planet's covered two thirds by 

371
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:23,374
oceans and that's a lot.
And like we're messing with them in a 

372
00:22:25,631 --> 00:22:28,390
really serious way.
And part of the reason for that is,

373
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:29,224
you know,
fish or fish and they've got scales and 

374
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:31,594
they're not that brainy and we're going 
after them with like 21st century 

375
00:22:34,481 --> 00:22:35,950
technology.
You know,

376
00:22:35,951 --> 00:22:39,970
we use planes to spark them and sonar to
find out where they are and,

377
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,960
and you like ultrasonic mapping to,
to,

378
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:44,863
to check out the structure of the bottom
of the ocean and massive nets and like 

379
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,640
those bloody things don't have a chance.
And that's not so good.

380
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,670
You know,
it's inappropriate use of technology.

381
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,560
Now.
There's some real reasons for it.

382
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,320
Now,
as I said,

383
00:22:59,321 --> 00:23:03,100
I'm a layperson and I read a lot.
I probably read it called 40 books and a

384
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:03,934
whole pile of papers on this topic and 
others and some of them were really 

385
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:07,804
helpful and these are some of them.
The end of the line is a great book and 

386
00:23:10,871 --> 00:23:13,170
these are very straightforward books to 
read there.

387
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:16,240
They're very engaging,
unnatural history to see.

388
00:23:16,241 --> 00:23:20,140
I love that the most important fish in 
the sea that's about this little herring

389
00:23:20,141 --> 00:23:23,050
like fish that lives off the Atlantic 
coast called the Manhattan,

390
00:23:23,051 --> 00:23:27,040
which is kind of an in an inedible oily 
beast of a herring.

391
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:30,820
And it it at least one time numbered in 
the hundreds of billions.

392
00:23:30,821 --> 00:23:34,120
It might've been the most plentiful 
animal on the surface of the planet,

393
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,103
maybe outnumbering all the other fish 
and it's at the very bottom of the food 

394
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,290
chain and people can't really eat it,
but everything else does.

395
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,123
Uh,
one of the things we're doing with the 

396
00:23:42,941 --> 00:23:44,050
Manhattan,
which seems,

397
00:23:44,051 --> 00:23:46,610
you know,
really not all that bright is vacuuming,

398
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,430
vacuuming them up,
like Mr.

399
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:50,263
Burns from the simpsons and grinding 
them into fish fertilizer and spreading 

400
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:54,830
them all over the ground.
You know,

401
00:23:54,831 --> 00:23:57,410
when we have all sorts of other ways of 
making fertilizer.

402
00:23:57,411 --> 00:23:58,740
And so,
you know,

403
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,820
we're stripping the whole bottom of the 
food chain out of the Atlantic coast.

404
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:04,910
And a lot of that seems to have to do 
with political corruption in the eastern

405
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:06,920
US states.
So it's a,

406
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:09,190
it's a remarkable book,
cod.

407
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,740
I love that too.
Mark Kurlansky,

408
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:14,150
he's a great author and you know,
reading about the devastation to the cod

409
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:14,984
fishery in the east coast is just enough
to make the bottom fall out of your 

410
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:20,840
heart because it was so damn dumb.
You know,

411
00:24:20,841 --> 00:24:21,674
everybody knew it was coming and people 
pretended that it wasn't an we 

412
00:24:24,261 --> 00:24:25,094
devastated rich resource that was really
the pride of the country and also a 

413
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,670
mainstay of,
of the world economy for five,

414
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:33,110
600 years,
you know?

415
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:38,180
So it's a great book and I'm showing you
those books because that source material

416
00:24:38,181 --> 00:24:41,390
for a lot of what I'm going to tell you 
now,

417
00:24:41,391 --> 00:24:42,224
the first thing I learned about the 
oceans was that the oceans aren't that 

418
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:48,200
big,
not when you're talking about what lives

419
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:49,034
in them.
Because the ocean is actually have two 

420
00:24:50,361 --> 00:24:51,194
kinds of structure and one structure 
they call the pelagic zone and it only 

421
00:24:54,591 --> 00:24:58,310
extends 50 miles from the shore.
So it's like this little skinny,

422
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,323
you know,
offshoot of the continents essentially 

423
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:05,990
maybe a note as the continental shelf.
And it's only about 500 feet deep.

424
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:10,280
Now that's important because because 
it's only that deep light can get to the

425
00:25:10,281 --> 00:25:11,114
bottom from the sun.
And so you need light for things to 

426
00:25:13,851 --> 00:25:15,260
grow,
especially plants.

427
00:25:15,261 --> 00:25:16,094
And if plants can't grow then the 
animals can't eat anything and then 

428
00:25:18,411 --> 00:25:19,340
there aren't any animals.

429
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,910
So it turns out that all the,
all the life fundamentally,

430
00:25:22,911 --> 00:25:23,481
you know,
with,

431
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:27,470
with a bit of an exception is within 50 
miles from shore.

432
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,590
And so,
and,

433
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,760
and,
and in these areas that are only,

434
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:33,430
you know,
500 feet deeper last.

435
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,110
Now if you look at this map,
the light blue areas,

436
00:25:36,111 --> 00:25:39,290
there are the pelagic zone.
And you know,

437
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:40,124
they look pretty big up in the Arctic.
Remember this is all stretched out 

438
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:44,480
because it's not a very intelligent 
projection,

439
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,700
but all the dark blue stuff,
man,

440
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:49,730
that's deep,
two miles deep on average.

441
00:25:49,731 --> 00:25:52,610
And it can be 11,000
feet deep and places.

442
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,520
And the problem with that is it's really
dark.

443
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,550
No light gets down there.
It's really cold.

444
00:25:58,551 --> 00:26:01,640
It's not much above freezing.
It's really high pressure,

445
00:26:01,641 --> 00:26:04,310
like higher pressure than the surface of
Venus.

446
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,600
And so it's not that hospitable for life
and there's not a lot around there.

447
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,060
And you know,
the problem with that,

448
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,620
at least in part as well,
a,

449
00:26:12,621 --> 00:26:15,530
that's most of the ocean and be,
it's mostly empty,

450
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:19,460
but because it's cold and dark,
the things that do live there,

451
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:23,330
well they're not very well understood,
but they also grow very fast.

452
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,180
So if you do fish them and who we are 
fishing them,

453
00:26:26,181 --> 00:26:27,014
then you know,
you fish them and it's like harvesting 

454
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:31,820
the trees that grow up in the Arctic,
you know,

455
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,310
they take forever to grow back.
So,

456
00:26:34,311 --> 00:26:36,980
and as we fished out the pelagic zone,
which were,

457
00:26:36,981 --> 00:26:37,814
which were doing at a fairly rapid rate,
we've increasingly turned to the 

458
00:26:40,671 --> 00:26:41,504
neuritic zone with,
especially with trawlers that can now 

459
00:26:44,011 --> 00:26:46,530
reach 2000 meters down to the bottom of 
the ocean.

460
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:47,760
And,
um,

461
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:50,040
you know,
it's not high quality food.

462
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:50,874
Generally speaking.
But the problem too is we don't 

463
00:26:52,351 --> 00:26:56,100
understand it well and it seems quite 
easy to devastate.

464
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:59,580
So anyway,
so that's a useful thing to know is that

465
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,653
there really isn't that much food 
bearing ocean and that a lot of the 

466
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:05,520
planet is sorta covered by water that's 
too dark,

467
00:27:05,521 --> 00:27:06,354
deep and cold to be of a lot of use.
Here's the things that really broke my 

468
00:27:11,341 --> 00:27:12,930
heart.
I think reading this,

469
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,123
um,
because one of the things that these 

470
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:20,601
books taught me was just how much there 
was before we took it.

471
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:25,320
And like I said,
I'm not an anti human in any way,

472
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:30,240
but the way this struck me was that it 
was a catastrophic aesthetic and,

473
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:32,640
and,
and spiritual loss,

474
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:36,120
a loss of,
of the absolute bounty of the planet and

475
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:40,560
this sort of thing that that evokes in 
the viewer or the experience or the same

476
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:41,394
sort of thing that maybe is evoked when 
you look up at the sky and see the vast 

477
00:27:43,891 --> 00:27:48,450
array of stars sort of spread out before
you was the magnificence of nature.

478
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,283
And we're denying ourselves at the 
privilege of experiencing that 

479
00:27:52,351 --> 00:27:55,440
increasingly.
So let me tell you what it was like when

480
00:27:55,441 --> 00:27:57,300
the Europeans first came to North 
America.

481
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,223
You want to remember that this is even 
after the native Americans had done a 

482
00:28:01,051 --> 00:28:04,770
fair bit of fishing and also after the 
Europeans had already pretty much fished

483
00:28:04,771 --> 00:28:08,350
out their water's completely sturgeon 
law.

484
00:28:08,351 --> 00:28:09,184
Sturgeon's a prehistoric fish.
It's been around about 60 million years 

485
00:28:11,641 --> 00:28:14,040
or so,
and they get really long and big.

486
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:16,020
They get so big you have to haul them 
out of rivers.

487
00:28:16,021 --> 00:28:16,854
With Oxen,
they can wait 1200 pounds and there are 

488
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,270
hardly any on the Atlantic coast 
anymore.

489
00:28:21,271 --> 00:28:22,104
I don't know if there are any,
there's some steel in northwestern 

490
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,160
Canada.
They live in the Fraser River,

491
00:28:26,161 --> 00:28:27,710
for example.
Um,

492
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:31,290
this was the potomac river in 1760 
potomac.

493
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:36,291
I guess sturgeon and shad are in such 
prodigious numbers that in one day,

494
00:28:37,021 --> 00:28:37,854
within the space of two miles,
only some gentlemen in canoes caught 

495
00:28:42,211 --> 00:28:45,960
about 600 of the former that was 
sturgeon with hooks,

496
00:28:45,961 --> 00:28:46,794
which they let down to the bottom and 
drew up at adventure when they perceive 

497
00:28:49,241 --> 00:28:51,930
them to rub against the fish and of the 
ladder.

498
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:52,823
Shad about 5,000
had been caught in one single hole of 

499
00:28:55,681 --> 00:28:56,514
the net,
so it was possible to cute cat 600 

500
00:28:59,221 --> 00:29:00,054
sturgeon in one day.
I'd want imagine that 600 sturgeon are 

501
00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:07,851
caught now in the whole world in a year.
Alloway for herring in 1728 this is from

502
00:29:09,091 --> 00:29:09,924
William Byrd when they spawn all streams
and waters are completely filled with 

503
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:17,460
them and one might believe when he sees 
such terrible amounts of them that there

504
00:29:17,461 --> 00:29:22,200
was as great a supply of herring as 
there is water in words.

505
00:29:22,201 --> 00:29:23,034
It is unbelievable indeed indescribable 
as a whole so incomprehensible what 

506
00:29:27,991 --> 00:29:30,770
quantity is found there.
One must be hold oneself.

507
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:31,703
There are medieval pictures of the 
herring run near the coast where people 

508
00:29:35,371 --> 00:29:36,204
would put a Hallberg,
which was a kind of double headed ax 

509
00:29:38,161 --> 00:29:38,994
with on a on a pole in the water and it 
would stand because there were so many 

510
00:29:42,221 --> 00:29:45,910
herring around at the hearing themselves
were packed in so tightly that the thing

511
00:29:45,911 --> 00:29:46,744
would stay up in the water will you 
would the hell of it is not much unlike 

512
00:29:51,731 --> 00:29:52,564
a place or turd bought some being two 
yards long and one wide and a foot 

513
00:29:55,811 --> 00:29:56,530
thick.

514
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,363
The plenty of better fish.
So they had plenty of better fish than 

515
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:00,843
halibut.
When the Europeans first came to North 

516
00:30:02,591 --> 00:30:05,890
America make them little esteemed except
the head and fins,

517
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:06,724
which studer baked is very good.
These halibut's be little set by while 

518
00:30:10,061 --> 00:30:10,894
Bass Bass is in season thorn back and 
skates is given to the dogs being not 

519
00:30:14,891 --> 00:30:15,724
counted worth addressing in many places.
You should also know that when the 

520
00:30:18,381 --> 00:30:19,214
Europeans first came to North America,
salmon and lobster fell in the same 

521
00:30:22,211 --> 00:30:23,044
category.
So there were laws in New England about 

522
00:30:25,421 --> 00:30:29,740
how many lobster you could feed.
Convicts are slaves in a week because it

523
00:30:29,741 --> 00:30:30,371
was,
you know,

524
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:33,790
it was like feeding them bugs as far as 
the new Englanders were concerned.

525
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,100
You know,
in salmon was so plentiful,

526
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:36,934
it was basically a junk fish.
So these things that we now regard 

527
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:43,070
essentially is delicacies,
especially why wild salmon were there.

528
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:43,903
An absolutely unbelievable numbers.
So I lived in Boston for a little while 

529
00:30:48,311 --> 00:30:51,430
and I used to go up to the coast.
There is a place there called Cape Band,

530
00:30:51,431 --> 00:30:52,264
which was up where the whaling 
communities used to be because it was a 

531
00:30:54,611 --> 00:30:58,330
big whaling area and we used to go to 
this beautiful beach that was like seven

532
00:30:58,331 --> 00:31:02,140
miles long and 300 yards wide and it was
an absolutely pristine,

533
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:05,980
gorgeous place and made the history of 
the area,

534
00:31:05,981 --> 00:31:06,814
recounts the nate,
what happened to the beach after nor 

535
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,033
easters and ignore Easter is like a 
hurricane except it's the northern 

536
00:31:13,511 --> 00:31:16,240
version of a hurricane.
And he said after our good nor Easter,

537
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:17,074
which happened around Boston,
pretty often the beach there would be 

538
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,610
covered with shellfish and other fish,
three feet deep and a hundred yards wide

539
00:31:24,611 --> 00:31:28,710
and seven miles long.
So why after there was a nor'easter,

540
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,583
the whole area would reek for months 
because of all the rotting fish and 

541
00:31:32,221 --> 00:31:33,160
self,
shellfish.

542
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,233
I went to Cape and to the beach one time
after a nor eastern walked about three 

543
00:31:38,621 --> 00:31:40,690
miles,
I found one starfish,

544
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:44,530
an empty lobster trap and a half dead 
horseshoe crab.

545
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:47,680
And that was it.
And normally walking on that beach,

546
00:31:47,681 --> 00:31:48,514
there was nothing at all.
So that's the degree to which the area 

547
00:31:51,581 --> 00:31:54,560
had been essentially devastated.
Um,

548
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:55,563
priest,
Andrei Bernaul dads with Christopher 

549
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,320
Columbus throat,
that voyage,

550
00:31:59,321 --> 00:32:01,900
they saw that there were many turtles 
and very large,

551
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:02,823
but in those 20 leagues they saw very 
many more for the sea was thick with 

552
00:32:05,771 --> 00:32:06,604
them and they were of the largest,
so numerous that it would seem that the 

553
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:12,790
ships would run aground on them.
And we're as if bathing in them,

554
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:13,893
the Indians value them highly in regard 
them as very good to eat unhealthy and 

555
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:17,374
savory.
Figured there were something on the 

556
00:32:19,211 --> 00:32:20,044
neighborhood of two to 400 million 
turtles in the Caribbean and they're 

557
00:32:22,961 --> 00:32:23,970
pretty much all gone.

558
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:25,623
Uh,
sea otters from San Francisco to the 

559
00:32:27,911 --> 00:32:28,744
Santa Clara estuary.
The ground appeared covered with black 

560
00:32:31,691 --> 00:32:35,650
sheets due to the great quantity of 
orders which were there,

561
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,353
the disappearance of orders,
because they were almost completely 

562
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,853
wiped out,
eliminated kelp forests because the 

563
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:43,250
order's eight,
the urchins,

564
00:32:43,251 --> 00:32:44,084
which grains don't.
The Kelp and removing the Kelp forest 

565
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:47,354
swiped out steller sea cow,
which was a 30 foot marine animal 

566
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,700
similar to the manatee,
except much larger.

567
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:57,230
It was wiped out the content along 
habitat and hunting,

568
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:58,363
uh,
28 years after it's identification by 

569
00:32:59,991 --> 00:33:02,510
Europeans,
um,

570
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,910
from California,
a late 1850s,

571
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:05,744
a thousand gray whales a day passed 
along the shore between December 15th 

572
00:33:08,991 --> 00:33:13,130
and February 1st.
So there are valid reports from all over

573
00:33:13,131 --> 00:33:13,964
the world before the whaling industry 
really kicked in of whales being about 

574
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:18,014
as common as porpoises are now when you 
see them swarming around the front of 

575
00:33:21,591 --> 00:33:22,280
boats.

576
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,380
So there were whales absolutely 
everywhere.

577
00:33:24,381 --> 00:33:27,180
So you imagine that a thousand today for
a,

578
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,053
for basically a three month period.
So pairing 1776 when the main body has 

579
00:33:35,361 --> 00:33:36,194
arrived,
it's breadth and depth is such as to 

580
00:33:37,581 --> 00:33:38,414
alter the very appearance of the ocean.
It is divided into distinct columns of 

581
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:45,650
five or six miles in length and three or
four broad,

582
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,933
well the water before them curls up as 
if forced out of it's been sometimes 

583
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:52,580
they st for this base of 10 or 15 
minutes.

584
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,790
Then rising into the surface and a great
weather,

585
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:56,624
reflective variety of splendid colors 
like a field be spangled with purple 

586
00:33:59,961 --> 00:34:03,890
golden easier.
The whole water seems alive and it seems

587
00:34:03,891 --> 00:34:07,760
so blocked with them to a great distance
that the numbers seems inexhaustible.

588
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,253
The,
there were so many turtles swimming 

589
00:34:10,461 --> 00:34:11,294
towards the islands in the Caribbean is 
that when the sailors used to get lost 

590
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:15,590
in the fog,
if they were close enough,

591
00:34:15,591 --> 00:34:16,424
they could,
they could sail to land by hearing the 

592
00:34:18,051 --> 00:34:21,770
turtles splash in the water.
Along with the herring,

593
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,173
the herring schools of great magnitude.
There were immense number of creditors 

594
00:34:27,111 --> 00:34:30,290
because of course the herring is a 
primary food for other fish.

595
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:34,040
And so there were massive schools of 
sharks and so on that would come along,

596
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:38,690
feed on them,
had doc from Goldsmith and 18,

597
00:34:38,691 --> 00:34:39,524
10 the annually visit the British coast 
and shows that sometimes extend along 

598
00:34:43,491 --> 00:34:47,750
the shore a hundred miles in length and 
300 miles in breadth

599
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:53,000
in 1855 43 fishing schooners from 
beverly,

600
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:57,620
Massachusetts caught more cod south of 
Nova Scotia on the Scotian shelf.

601
00:34:57,621 --> 00:34:58,454
So these are just sailing ships than the
entire Canadian fleet caught there in 

602
00:35:01,791 --> 00:35:05,190
1999,
six years later,

603
00:35:05,191 --> 00:35:06,024
34 schooners landed more card on the 
Maine coast between Penobscot Bay in 

604
00:35:09,481 --> 00:35:10,314
Grand Manan that we're caught in the 
entire Gulf of Maine from Cape Cod to 

605
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,430
Canada in 1999.

606
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,013
So,

607
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,533
well,
if you read those books that I showed 

608
00:35:19,891 --> 00:35:20,724
you,
they're just full of accounts of 

609
00:35:22,171 --> 00:35:25,830
precisely.
That sorta makes painful reading.

610
00:35:25,831 --> 00:35:26,664
You know,
there's Kurlansky also wrote a book 

611
00:35:28,921 --> 00:35:29,754
called,
uh,

612
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,710
the big oyster,
which is about New York.

613
00:35:31,711 --> 00:35:34,020
And he talked about what Chesapeake Bay 
used to be like.

614
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:35,703
Uh,
Kurlansky claims that the average sized 

615
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:42,930
oyster 300 years ago was as big as a 
dinner plate and had to be cut into four

616
00:35:42,931 --> 00:35:43,764
pieces before it could be water.
And so chesapeake bay was an absolutely 

617
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:49,014
staggering masterpiece of natural plenty
and it's pretty much been reduced to 

618
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:56,550
nothing as well.
So it makes pretty painful reading.

619
00:35:56,551 --> 00:35:58,980
And one of the things I also learned 
about this,

620
00:35:58,981 --> 00:36:00,510
and I'll talk about this a little bit 
later,

621
00:36:00,511 --> 00:36:01,344
is you know,
when you hear estimates of fish stock 

622
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:03,624
depletion,
you hear things like 95% since the 

623
00:36:05,311 --> 00:36:06,660
beginning of the 20th century.

624
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,110
But lots of these writers claimed that 
the fish stocks had already been reduced

625
00:36:10,111 --> 00:36:13,470
by 95% or more by the beginning of the 
20th century.

626
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:18,570
So we're looking at a 95% reduction in a
95% reduction.

627
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,360
So you know,
that kind of hurts.

628
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:25,050
Now there's a lot of reasons for this.
One of them is called the tragedy of the

629
00:36:25,051 --> 00:36:27,120
Commons.
And the tragedy of the Commons is,

630
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:28,163
well,
imagine that there's a field on which 

631
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:30,564
anybody can graze their sheep.
While the logical thing to do is to get 

632
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:34,374
your sheep out there and let them eat 
all the grass before the next guy gets 

633
00:36:36,391 --> 00:36:38,610
his sheep out there.
And he told the groks.

634
00:36:38,611 --> 00:36:39,444
Right.
And so the tragedy of the Commons is 

635
00:36:41,011 --> 00:36:45,330
that when there's no fixed ownership of 
a resource,

636
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:46,283
it makes sense economically for the 
person who gets first access to the 

637
00:36:49,411 --> 00:36:51,270
resource to take as much of it as they 
can.

638
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,210
Because anything they leave,
at least in principle,

639
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:57,480
it's going to be taken by someone else.
And historically,

640
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,270
until at least 1978 the open ocean was 
only seven miles off shore.

641
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,433
That's where the,
where the national jurisdiction and did 

642
00:37:06,631 --> 00:37:08,400
it.
The rest of the sea was regarded as,

643
00:37:08,401 --> 00:37:11,580
you know,
a free charactery in a sense.

644
00:37:11,581 --> 00:37:14,280
So people can take whatever they wanted 
and you know,

645
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,980
you can see that as a legal and a 
structural problem.

646
00:37:16,981 --> 00:37:21,981
So that's one of the main contributors,
another contributor right now to,

647
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:29,040
to the continued decimation of the 
world's fish stocks.

648
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:29,874
And one of the things that makes 
regulation difficult is what's being 

649
00:37:33,211 --> 00:37:35,400
described as technological creep.
So he say,

650
00:37:35,401 --> 00:37:36,230
it might say,
well,

651
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,063
you know,
maybe you can limit your boat to 40 the 

652
00:37:38,761 --> 00:37:41,640
boats that are allowed to fish to 40 
feet in length or something like that.

653
00:37:41,641 --> 00:37:45,330
Instead of these massive factory boats 
that go out and you know,

654
00:37:45,331 --> 00:37:48,510
sit on the ocean for months and vacuum 
up everything in their trail.

655
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,330
The problem with technological creek,
which sounds like a,

656
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,403
you know,
maybe some kind of computer programmer 

657
00:37:53,701 --> 00:37:54,534
who's looking lurking in the bushes,
is that even your 40 foot keeps getting 

658
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,060
outfitted with better and better 
technology,

659
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,710
right?
Because as you know,

660
00:38:04,711 --> 00:38:08,430
how fast our technology increases and so
you can have the same size boat that you

661
00:38:08,431 --> 00:38:09,264
had 10 years ago and the things like 10 
times as deadly as it was because you 

662
00:38:12,601 --> 00:38:13,434
know,
you're outfitted with the latest gear 

663
00:38:14,641 --> 00:38:17,430
and you can understand why the fishermen
are driven to that.

664
00:38:17,431 --> 00:38:18,264
But it's another structural problem that
that adds to this general overall 

665
00:38:23,341 --> 00:38:25,070
problem.
Um,

666
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,010
the use of this sort of space age 
technology has had a pretty catastrophic

667
00:38:29,011 --> 00:38:30,210
consequence too.
So,

668
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:32,910
um,
we're doing something that call,

669
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,170
let's see,
I've got to,

670
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,180
yeah,
fishing down the food chain.

671
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:39,130
And so the way the food chains are set 
up is there's like,

672
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,320
you know,
plankton at the bottom and neat whatever

673
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:42,570
they can get their little hands on.

674
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,130
And they're often a,
you don't actually have handsome,

675
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,533
you know,
they also useful to synthesis and 

676
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,113
they're there at the bottom of the food 
chain is billions of the things being 

677
00:38:50,981 --> 00:38:51,731
whales,
eat them,

678
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:54,340
some whales and then you know,
little fish eat those.

679
00:38:54,341 --> 00:38:56,700
And then bigger fish eat the little fish
and bigger fish eat,

680
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,660
you know,
the medium size fish and so on,

681
00:38:58,661 --> 00:39:01,620
all the way up to things like sharps and
swordfish and tuna and,

682
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,810
and human beings.
Now what we're basically doing,

683
00:39:04,811 --> 00:39:07,360
we tend to like the fish that are higher
up on the,

684
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,350
on the food chain.
So we,

685
00:39:09,351 --> 00:39:12,940
we tend to like the taste of predatory 
fish cause they're hard muscle.

686
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,900
And now the problem with that is that 
the higher you are,

687
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:17,763
you are up in the food chain,
the fewer there can be of you in part 

688
00:39:20,021 --> 00:39:20,854
because you know your,
your primary sources of food or limited 

689
00:39:23,501 --> 00:39:25,960
by this,
by this pyramid phenomena.

690
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,213
As we've got better and better from a 
technological perspective at catching 

691
00:39:30,311 --> 00:39:31,930
fish.
What's happened is we keep,

692
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,853
we are fishing down the food chain.
We go from the great big fish at the 

693
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:37,300
top,
like the sharks,

694
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:41,860
about 70 million a year of which right 
now are killed for shark fin soup.

695
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,481
And that's,
yeah,

696
00:39:42,481 --> 00:39:44,410
it's a lot of sharks.
70 million a year,

697
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:45,723
you know,
we're gonna run out of sharks and no 

698
00:39:46,511 --> 00:39:48,700
time flat if we keep things up at that 
rate.

699
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:49,893
And so we fished down the food chain,
we take the big predators first and 

700
00:39:52,961 --> 00:39:55,930
they're the most valuable fish.
And then we go after what they go after.

701
00:39:55,931 --> 00:39:58,540
And then we go after what that fish has 
gone after.

702
00:39:58,541 --> 00:39:59,374
And we go out farther afield and we go 
out into the deep ocean and we find 

703
00:40:02,321 --> 00:40:03,154
places that no one's fished before,
but we're so damn good at it now that 

704
00:40:06,581 --> 00:40:07,414
the time to exhaustion of the new fish 
species from the time we discovered is 

705
00:40:10,901 --> 00:40:14,020
about 15 years.
So we can discover a new species,

706
00:40:14,021 --> 00:40:16,450
which is often given,
even if it's half the inedible,

707
00:40:16,451 --> 00:40:17,284
it's given a real market,
we'll name we go after it was facing 

708
00:40:19,781 --> 00:40:22,340
each technology and wipe it down to more
than two,

709
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,870
less than 85% if it's previous numbers 
within 15 years,

710
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,390
we're really deadly.
And so,

711
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,070
you know,
as soon as we discover something,

712
00:40:30,071 --> 00:40:30,904
plus there's so many of us that the 
things in serious trouble and pretty 

713
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:34,930
much no time flat

714
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,423
there is,
there has been a global decline in the 

715
00:40:42,651 --> 00:40:47,120
world's catch ever since about 1998 if 
you control for Red China's data,

716
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,730
because the Chinese,
from what I've been able to determine,

717
00:40:49,731 --> 00:40:52,010
tend to inflate their production 
numbers.

718
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,920
I mean,
that's a standard trick and totalitarian

719
00:40:54,921 --> 00:40:56,540
states.
But there are,

720
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:59,530
even though we switch our switching to 
different species and,

721
00:40:59,531 --> 00:41:01,250
and you know,
we're pretty damn good at that.

722
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:05,720
We haven't been able to halt the decline
in overall catch despite the fact that,

723
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,530
you know,
our technology is improved a lot.

724
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:10,490
We're going after other species and 
that's not a good thing.

725
00:41:10,491 --> 00:41:13,250
And the other thing that's really worth 
noting about fish,

726
00:41:13,251 --> 00:41:14,084
and this is one of the things that 
convinced me that there really was a 

727
00:41:15,801 --> 00:41:18,140
problem was you guys might know about 
the,

728
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,980
the bat that was made by a star,
Stanford biologist,

729
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,083
Paul Erlick and an economist whose name 
I don't remember in about 1968 and Paul 

730
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,900
Erlick had written this book called the 
Population Bob,

731
00:41:29,901 --> 00:41:31,010
where he predicted that,
you know,

732
00:41:31,011 --> 00:41:32,840
we're all going to starve to death by 
the year two.

733
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,633
And the economists always disagree with 
the biologist because economists think 

734
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:40,210
we're real smart and can think our way 
out of everything.

735
00:41:40,211 --> 00:41:42,980
And you know,
so far they've been,

736
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:44,990
you know,
reasonably right.

737
00:41:44,991 --> 00:41:46,100
The biologist say,
well,

738
00:41:46,101 --> 00:41:46,934
it's just a time thing.
We'll Melle Mel fussell when eventually 

739
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:50,893
and who knows?
But this economist Bet Erlick that by 

740
00:41:54,231 --> 00:41:58,430
the year 2000 and commodity prices would
have gone down instead of up.

741
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:00,650
Cause Eric's idea was everything's 
getting scarce.

742
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:01,484
So from 1968 to the year 2000 all of our
commodities which are somewhat scarce 

743
00:42:05,361 --> 00:42:08,510
are going to increase in price.
Well Erlick got stomped.

744
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:13,550
The commodity prices plummeted between 
1968 and 2000 so the economist had them,

745
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:17,300
you know,
beat him in no uncertain terms.

746
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,540
But the one thing that didn't work out 
that way is seafood.

747
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:23,240
I mean things like card used to be 
cheap,

748
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:25,460
right?
Seafood used to be cheap fish and chips.

749
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,590
That was the cheapest thing you could 
buy on the menu.

750
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:28,903
Well it's not like that anymore.
See food is expensive and you know 

751
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:34,640
bloody well when something gets 
expensive that there actually isn't that

752
00:42:34,641 --> 00:42:37,370
much of it anymore.
It's a really good marker.

753
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,640
So you know,
we have global decline,

754
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,710
global catch,
declining figures,

755
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:43,663
allied with pretty hard economic data.
That fish is a lot more expensive than 

756
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,370
it used to be.
Plus we're harvesting,

757
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,413
we're harvesting species that people 
wouldn't have even considered edible a 

758
00:42:53,331 --> 00:42:54,290
hundred years ago.
I mean,

759
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:55,124
200 years ago they were complaining 
about halibut and feeding it to their 

760
00:42:57,441 --> 00:42:58,274
dogs.
It's like that's a high quality fish by 

761
00:42:59,781 --> 00:43:04,490
our standards.
So there's no doubt that this is a real,

762
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:05,383
this is a real phenomenon.
And there's other awful things that 

763
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:12,220
really are kind of difficult to tolerate
when you read about them.

764
00:43:12,221 --> 00:43:17,221
And trawling is one of them in here.
Here's a nice description of trolling.

765
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,473
Um,
basically what a troll does is it's a 

766
00:43:23,331 --> 00:43:24,164
huge net that's put behind a really big 
boat and the net is weighted down and 

767
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,984
has rollers.
There's a bunch of different kinds of 

768
00:43:31,131 --> 00:43:31,964
them.
It has rollers and you put it on the 

769
00:43:33,081 --> 00:43:33,914
bottom of the ocean,
sort of digs down to a depth of about 

770
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:38,690
eight inches.
And then you just drag the thing and you

771
00:43:38,691 --> 00:43:42,110
drag it till the net fills up and well,
what does it fill up with?

772
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,540
Well,
whatever's down there,

773
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:45,770
coral.

774
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:47,040
Okay.

775
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:47,873
So,
especially now that they're fishing out 

776
00:43:49,231 --> 00:43:51,600
the deeper areas of the ocean,
all the corals coming up,

777
00:43:51,601 --> 00:43:54,720
300 pound chunks of it.
Maybe they figured it takes 10,000

778
00:43:54,721 --> 00:43:57,540
years to grow.
And you know that's habitat for,

779
00:43:57,541 --> 00:44:00,420
for fish.
You run a trawler over an area,

780
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,460
there's nothing left of it.
It takes everything.

781
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:04,290
You haul it up,
what happens?

782
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:07,910
You take your 10% of the damn fish 
that's in there that you want to eat and

783
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,640
you throw 90% back because that's what 
you have to do by law.

784
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:14,580
So the bycatch,
so to speak,

785
00:44:14,581 --> 00:44:18,210
which is what you don't want his 90% 
back,

786
00:44:18,211 --> 00:44:19,044
it goes into the water.
Now remember I showed you the 

787
00:44:21,331 --> 00:44:22,164
continental shelf,
there's not that much of it while we've 

788
00:44:23,611 --> 00:44:24,444
trolled most of it.
So in that isn't stopping in the 

789
00:44:26,971 --> 00:44:27,804
trawlers are getting bigger.
There's something they call the super 

790
00:44:29,521 --> 00:44:32,490
trawler that was heading down to despite
a lot of,

791
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:33,483
you know,
public outcry because the Australians 

792
00:44:34,651 --> 00:44:36,480
are fairly sensitive about this sort of 
thing.

793
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:37,643
You know,
they get bigger and bigger and bigger 

794
00:44:38,761 --> 00:44:40,610
all the time.
And that's partly because they're,

795
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:41,693
you know,
cause they can and partly because 

796
00:44:42,961 --> 00:44:44,790
they're chasing and diminishing 
resource.

797
00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:47,000
So you imagine what would happen if you,
you know,

798
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,270
went through a,
you know,

799
00:44:48,271 --> 00:44:53,271
a nice bit of grassland or National Park
with a net 300 feet high and it was,

800
00:44:53,641 --> 00:44:55,980
you know,
drag through by tractors.

801
00:44:55,981 --> 00:44:57,810
You just take everything,
trees,

802
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,070
deer,
Moose,

803
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,510
birds,
insects,

804
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:02,910
everything.
Pull out the things you can eat,

805
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,560
let everything else rock Jesus.
If it was happening on the land,

806
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:09,960
people would be shorting out and running
around in circles screaming.

807
00:45:09,961 --> 00:45:10,794
But it's happening on the,
at the bottom of the ocean and no one 

808
00:45:12,331 --> 00:45:14,880
can see it.
And it's not just happening once.

809
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:15,863
There's lots of places in the North Sea 
which used to be clear and is no longer 

810
00:45:19,201 --> 00:45:21,480
clear.
It's muddy because of the trawling,

811
00:45:21,481 --> 00:45:24,330
at least in part because of the 
disturbance of the ocean floor.

812
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:27,540
That place is being trolled like three 
or four times.

813
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:29,370
So,
you know,

814
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:31,830
obviously that's not going to work for 
very long.

815
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,230
So here's our,
here's the description.

816
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,213
Picture,
a 2000 horsepower trawler targeting 

817
00:45:37,351 --> 00:45:38,184
place or soul pulling,
a beam trawl mounted with a rotating 

818
00:45:41,131 --> 00:45:41,964
tickler with rotating tickler chains 
across the featureless fans and gravels 

819
00:45:46,231 --> 00:45:47,064
of the southern North Sea.
The weight in troll and its chains 

820
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:55,850
designed to beat flat fish out of the 
sheltering mud smashes up everything.

821
00:45:55,891 --> 00:45:59,610
It does not catch particularly the 
burrowing animals in the sediment,

822
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:02,220
disturbing them at depths of up to six 
inches.

823
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,533
European Union scientists have 
calculated that up to 16 pounds of 

824
00:46:06,301 --> 00:46:07,134
marine animals are killed by being 
trawls to produce one pound of 

825
00:46:10,891 --> 00:46:13,620
marketable soul,
sea urchins,

826
00:46:13,621 --> 00:46:16,680
hermit crabs,
brittle stars and razor shells or killed

827
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:20,400
or having part of their shells opened,
made vulnerable to predators.

828
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:23,280
Starfish tend to be the survivors losing
a leg or two,

829
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:24,390
but escaping the net.

830
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:25,583
The winter and heavily traveled areas 
are usually crabs which move in from 

831
00:46:28,561 --> 00:46:29,394
other areas to eat damaged creatures and
worms that take over from the easily 

832
00:46:32,911 --> 00:46:33,744
damaged by valves.
Scientists have concluded that most 

833
00:46:37,351 --> 00:46:38,184
parts of the southern North Sea have 
been disturbed by a beam trial at least 

834
00:46:41,671 --> 00:46:42,504
once a year.
The damage caused by phishing is 

835
00:46:44,611 --> 00:46:45,444
estimated at 100,000
times greater than that of oil or gas 

836
00:46:48,811 --> 00:46:52,740
exploration.
So it's pretty much total devastation.

837
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,620
So you know,
that's kind of distressing.

838
00:46:56,110 --> 00:46:56,943
Um,
and they estimate about 25% of the 

839
00:46:58,981 --> 00:47:01,440
world's total catch is hauled in by 
trawls.

840
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:02,813
So that just doesn't seem like a 
particularly intelligent way of going 

841
00:47:06,151 --> 00:47:06,984
about things now because the whole shelf
has been trawled and there's not a hell 

842
00:47:10,141 --> 00:47:12,330
of a lot left there.
They've developed trawls and can go down

843
00:47:12,331 --> 00:47:15,360
to 2000 meters and 2000 meters.
You know,

844
00:47:15,361 --> 00:47:16,890
that's getting to be a mile and a half.

845
00:47:16,890 --> 00:47:20,460
That's,
that's close to the average depth of the

846
00:47:20,461 --> 00:47:23,730
deepest part of the ocean.
Now when you go way down in the ocean,

847
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:24,803
there's not a lot there as I said,
but there are places in the ocean floor 

848
00:47:27,031 --> 00:47:27,864
that are seen mouths.
So they sort of poke up and when they 

849
00:47:29,921 --> 00:47:30,754
poke up,
currents come up to them and there's a 

850
00:47:32,741 --> 00:47:33,574
lot of food on the sea mount areas and 
they can map those out really nicely 

851
00:47:36,101 --> 00:47:37,270
now.
And with the deep sea trials,

852
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,850
they just go over the sea mounts and 
take everything that's there.

853
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:43,960
So and perceives or are also pretty 
devastating,

854
00:47:43,961 --> 00:47:44,794
especially when you combine them with 
spotting new airplanes because the 

855
00:47:47,051 --> 00:47:49,480
spotting airplanes go off the coast and 
they find a,

856
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,130
you know,
a school and then the scenes,

857
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,860
the savings come in and they take the 
whole school.

858
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:55,323
So you know,
that's also not really particularly a 

859
00:47:58,571 --> 00:48:00,550
promising thing to be happening.

860
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:01,953
So then the next problematic form of 
fishing seems to be maybe longline 

861
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:07,923
fishing.
And so long lines are pretty much 

862
00:48:10,211 --> 00:48:13,990
exactly what they sound like.
They're very long fishing lines and very

863
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:18,670
long means up to 40 miles long and with 
30 hooks per mile.

864
00:48:18,671 --> 00:48:21,400
And so that's 1200 hooks.
And so,

865
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:22,263
you know,
they're often catching the kind of fish 

866
00:48:24,101 --> 00:48:26,530
that you'd like to eat.
But the catch a lot of other things too,

867
00:48:26,531 --> 00:48:27,364
like tens of thousands of seabirds and 
tens of thousands of turtles and all 

868
00:48:31,661 --> 00:48:34,540
sorts of things in sharks and all sorts 
of things that you know,

869
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:36,970
will eat anything that's on a baited 
hook.

870
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:40,510
So the bike catch problem with longline 
fishing is also horrendous.

871
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:43,930
So that's Kinda,
that's Kinda,

872
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:47,290
you know,
miserable to apprehend as well.

873
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,011
And then,
you know,

874
00:48:50,011 --> 00:48:50,844
there's this thing I mentioned a little 
bit earlier about the Manhattan and 

875
00:48:52,981 --> 00:48:53,740
that's,
that,

876
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:54,573
that was a very distressing book to read
because they're the Manhattan because 

877
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:00,870
they're at the bottom of the food chain 
down,

878
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:01,704
you know,
down,

879
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,690
down,
near where the little fish are there.

880
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:04,770
Oh,
it Manhattan.

881
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,570
Interestingly enough,
our vegetarian,

882
00:49:06,571 --> 00:49:09,230
most fish aren't vegetarian,
but these guys are vegetarians.

883
00:49:09,231 --> 00:49:11,660
So that's what puts them at the bottom 
of the food chain.

884
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:15,480
They also take a lot of garbage out of 
the water because they're vegetarian.

885
00:49:15,481 --> 00:49:18,090
And so if there's Algal blooms or 
something like that,

886
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:18,983
which there often is because of nitrogen
runoff from fertilizers from the land 

887
00:49:21,811 --> 00:49:22,644
and the Manhattan,
we'll go in there and cleaned it up and 

888
00:49:24,271 --> 00:49:25,104
then all the other official eat them.
But they take the Manhattan out to turn 

889
00:49:27,151 --> 00:49:29,460
them into fertilizer.
And as I said already,

890
00:49:29,461 --> 00:49:31,500
you know,
that seems to be served at least in part

891
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:32,334
by corruption in the east coast states.
They do the same thing in Denmark with 

892
00:49:35,971 --> 00:49:36,804
this thing called the Sandy Hill.
And it's another one of these ugly 

893
00:49:38,461 --> 00:49:40,020
little things that,
you know,

894
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:43,020
people wouldn't normally eat,
but everything else does.

895
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:45,840
And there's a lot of them.
They're sort of like the Manhattan,

896
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:47,790
they breed like mad,
but um,

897
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:48,683
they've been catching them,
catching those up a store and do it and 

898
00:49:50,491 --> 00:49:52,400
often burning them for oil.
So.

899
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:53,843
MMM.

900
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:56,410
Well,
and then there's us,

901
00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:57,370
you know,
Canada,

902
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:00,430
Canada is by no means an ecological 
paradise.

903
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:02,890
Like we like to pride ourselves on the 
idea that,

904
00:50:02,891 --> 00:50:03,724
you know,
were there sort of great north with our 

905
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,960
massive forests in our care for the 
environment.

906
00:50:07,961 --> 00:50:10,660
Most of that's pretty much rubbish.
So for example,

907
00:50:10,661 --> 00:50:15,340
we have a far a smaller portion of our 
territory devoted to,

908
00:50:15,390 --> 00:50:16,223
to national parks in the American Stu,
despite the fact that what 95% of the 

909
00:50:20,141 --> 00:50:24,040
country is basically uninhabited.
So that's a pretty shocking statistic.

910
00:50:24,041 --> 00:50:24,874
And the Americans have done a much 
better job at managing their fisheries 

911
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:28,880
than us.
And you know,

912
00:50:28,881 --> 00:50:29,714
we should have been shocked into what 
embarrassed action in 1992 when this 

913
00:50:34,461 --> 00:50:37,250
happened.
So,

914
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:38,413
you know,
the cod fishery off the grand banks and 

915
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:41,204
being there for 400 years and it was 
really one of the world's remarkable 

916
00:50:44,661 --> 00:50:46,160
treasures.
And,

917
00:50:46,161 --> 00:50:49,310
uh,
around before,

918
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:51,980
I guess 1978,
the,

919
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:55,490
the limit to national sovereignty I 
think was seven miles.

920
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:58,310
It's far as seven miles.
I can't remember exactly what,

921
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:01,160
and you know,
the Spanner Spaniards and the Portuguese

922
00:51:01,161 --> 00:51:01,994
and,
and lots of European fishing boats were 

923
00:51:03,531 --> 00:51:04,364
in the grand banks fishing like mad,
which of course they'd been doing for 

924
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,233
really almost 600 years.
The Basques might've even got there 

925
00:51:10,641 --> 00:51:11,474
before Christopher Columbus and not told
anybody because they like to have all 

926
00:51:15,231 --> 00:51:16,160
those fish,
you know,

927
00:51:16,161 --> 00:51:20,000
and basks they're pretty sneaky people.
So anyways,

928
00:51:20,001 --> 00:51:20,834
you know,
so the Canadian government made a big 

929
00:51:22,221 --> 00:51:25,850
fuss about the fact that all these 
foreigners were out there taking out the

930
00:51:25,851 --> 00:51:26,684
card and they were part of the,
the political force that got the 

931
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:33,830
national sovereignty zone extended to 
200 miles off shore.

932
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:37,430
So the candidate had manage its own cod 
stocks.

933
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:39,560
And of course we do it responsibly.
Well,

934
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:40,603
the first thing that happened was the 
federal government modernize the 

935
00:51:42,621 --> 00:51:45,440
Newfoundland fishing fleet and equipped 
it with,

936
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,630
you know,
really outstanding boats in.

937
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:50,480
The second thing that happened was we 
took all the fish.

938
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:54,920
And so by net while you see what 
happened by basically by 1992,

939
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:58,490
so 2 billion fish,
that's the estimate.

940
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:02,300
That's a lot of fish equal in weight to 
the entire Canadian population.

941
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:05,180
And these cod man,
they were magnificent animals.

942
00:52:05,181 --> 00:52:07,370
They figured the ones that were there,
um,

943
00:52:07,371 --> 00:52:08,204
when the Europeans first came over to 
North America or something like five 

944
00:52:10,851 --> 00:52:13,730
feet lane in length,
more or less on average and teeth,

945
00:52:13,731 --> 00:52:16,250
three feet around.
These were big fish.

946
00:52:16,251 --> 00:52:17,084
You know,
they're both the size of a person and 

947
00:52:18,501 --> 00:52:19,334
they came and massive,
massive schools and no one really knows 

948
00:52:22,251 --> 00:52:23,690
why they haven't come back.
There's,

949
00:52:23,691 --> 00:52:26,180
there's a couple of hypothesis.
One is,

950
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:30,110
you know,
fish in schools are like zebras.

951
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:34,940
You don't see zebras loans,
zebras rate roaming the Serengeti,

952
00:52:34,970 --> 00:52:35,803
you know,
what you see as big clumps of zebras 

953
00:52:37,641 --> 00:52:40,850
because they're herd animals and they 
really are herd animals,

954
00:52:40,851 --> 00:52:43,190
which means the herd is their 
environment.

955
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:47,870
And so they can't live away from a heard
more or any less than people can.

956
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,210
And it looks like cod.
You're sort of like that.

957
00:52:50,211 --> 00:52:54,140
And other fish that live in schools.
So for example,

958
00:52:54,141 --> 00:52:56,690
one of the things that happens with cod 
schools is that,

959
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:57,883
first of all,
there's a lot of subspecies of cod and 

960
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:00,703
we don't know how old the schools are,
but some of the schools might be who 

961
00:53:03,351 --> 00:53:04,184
knows 150,000
years old as super organisms and they 

962
00:53:07,251 --> 00:53:11,990
seem to actually kind of know the ocean 
in which they swim as a collective unit.

963
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,060
And so they know where to go eat and 
they know where,

964
00:53:14,061 --> 00:53:14,894
you know,
they know their habitat and more 

965
00:53:16,731 --> 00:53:20,300
importantly the card arrange themselves 
in schools so that the big Carter in the

966
00:53:20,301 --> 00:53:21,134
middle and the little card or sort of 
outside and then the predators pick off 

967
00:53:24,231 --> 00:53:27,390
the little card but are useless anyways 
because there are too young to breed.

968
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:28,403
So the school is structured so that the 
main Carter protected second when the 

969
00:53:32,611 --> 00:53:35,760
card May,
they actually use the school as a mating

970
00:53:35,761 --> 00:53:36,594
structure.
So they organize their mating routines 

971
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:39,533
on the outside of the school structure.
And so what that implies is that if you 

972
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,104
blow out the structure of the school,
then the God don't know what to do and 

973
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,920
that's one potential reason they haven't
really managed to come back.

974
00:53:49,921 --> 00:53:50,754
There's others,
one being perhaps that if you really 

975
00:53:52,861 --> 00:53:53,694
devastate a population,
then maybe you change the ecological 

976
00:53:56,611 --> 00:53:57,444
conditions of the environment.
Because it turns out that the way an 

977
00:54:00,601 --> 00:54:05,580
ecosystem sets itself up is dependent to
some degree on which creature gets their

978
00:54:05,581 --> 00:54:08,460
first sort of which creature gets there 
in what order.

979
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,593
And so if you wipe population like the 
car down low enough than other animals 

980
00:54:13,351 --> 00:54:16,290
move in to get the niche and now set the
card can't come back.

981
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,300
Now there's other theories too,
you know,

982
00:54:18,301 --> 00:54:20,160
some of which have to do with ocean 
warming,

983
00:54:20,161 --> 00:54:25,161
but the point is we've left the car loan
kind of because people are still allowed

984
00:54:25,981 --> 00:54:28,230
to fish a lot more for cod than you'd 
think.

985
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:30,480
We've kind of left them alone for 20 
years.

986
00:54:30,481 --> 00:54:33,990
And the consequences being pretty 
minimal,

987
00:54:33,991 --> 00:54:36,090
especially for an animal that you know,
fish,

988
00:54:36,091 --> 00:54:38,490
they lay a lotta eggs.
It's not like they're,

989
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:41,940
it's not like they are,
they're not able to reproduce.

990
00:54:41,941 --> 00:54:44,400
They certainly know how to do that.
So,

991
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:45,601
so,
you know,

992
00:54:45,601 --> 00:54:47,550
you think we might learn something from 
this,

993
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:49,560
but it doesn't really appear that we 
did.

994
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:50,543
And the other thing that really struck 
me as mind boggling when I was going 

995
00:54:54,361 --> 00:54:57,270
through this material was exactly 
Canada's record,

996
00:54:57,271 --> 00:55:00,300
which was so embarrassing and it was 
again,

997
00:55:00,301 --> 00:55:01,134
it was like a personal blow.
So in 90 then I'm going to pretty much 

998
00:55:04,921 --> 00:55:05,910
fold up with this.

999
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:09,300
In 1992 which was about when the cod 
fishery collapsed,

1000
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:14,960
the Canada promised to protect 20% of 
its oceanic territory.

1001
00:55:15,391 --> 00:55:19,230
So the idea was to put aside chunks of 
oceanic territory,

1002
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,060
sorta like national parks,
you know,

1003
00:55:21,061 --> 00:55:21,894
where the animals that live there and 
the ecosystems would be protected so 

1004
00:55:25,621 --> 00:55:27,720
that they could come back.
Because you know,

1005
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:29,940
fish come back pretty fast if you leave 
them alone.

1006
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:33,180
I read something very amusing about this
very fact.

1007
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,530
Um,
you know,

1008
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:36,450
how you heard,
and maybe this is wrong,

1009
00:55:36,451 --> 00:55:40,020
but I read it several places,
you know how you heard that the whole,

1010
00:55:40,021 --> 00:55:40,854
uh,
Gulf of Mexico oil spill was such a 

1011
00:55:43,831 --> 00:55:45,990
catastrophe for fish?
Yeah.

1012
00:55:45,991 --> 00:55:46,824
Well there were more fish the year after
this field in the year before and the 

1013
00:55:49,921 --> 00:55:52,830
reason for that is no one fished.
So that's,

1014
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:54,840
you know,
that's a pretty peculiar statistic,

1015
00:55:54,841 --> 00:55:56,220
but it shows you two things.

1016
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:57,690
A,
how many fish we take,

1017
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:58,673
and B,
how damn fast the fish can come back if 

1018
00:56:00,451 --> 00:56:02,980
you leave them alone.
The same thing happened in the North Sea

1019
00:56:02,981 --> 00:56:06,360
in World War II was pretty much fished 
out before World War II,

1020
00:56:06,361 --> 00:56:10,080
but no one was fishing during World War 
II because of German u boats.

1021
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:13,110
There was a lot of fish in the North Sea
again after World War II.

1022
00:56:13,111 --> 00:56:16,170
So leave the things alone for awhile.
They can come back.

1023
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:17,303
Canada promise to protect at least 20% 
of its oceanic territory by 2012 in 

1024
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:24,214
writing,
in a series of major international 

1025
00:56:26,501 --> 00:56:27,334
forums where cannabis signed treaties in
1990 to 2002 2003 and 2005 so not only 

1026
00:56:35,591 --> 00:56:36,424
did we promise,
we promised frequently and in writing 

1027
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:40,563
less than 1% is currently protected 
despite the fact that Canada has one of 

1028
00:56:43,751 --> 00:56:48,160
the longest international coastlines in 
the world and is also home to multiple,

1029
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:49,083
you know how there are ecological zones 
because each little geographic area has 

1030
00:56:52,571 --> 00:56:54,340
its own peculiar characteristics.

1031
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:55,173
And so really what you need is you need 
to set aside a protected area that are 

1032
00:56:58,541 --> 00:57:01,330
sort of representative and have all 
these different ecological zones.

1033
00:57:01,331 --> 00:57:03,850
And we have plenty of those ecological 
zones.

1034
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:04,923
Zero action.
1% of our oceanic territory is 

1035
00:57:08,231 --> 00:57:09,490
protected.
That's it.

1036
00:57:09,491 --> 00:57:10,324
And you can fish in 95% of that.
So what we've done in the aftermath of 

1037
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:18,760
the great cod catastrophe looks to me to
be pretty much absolutely nothing.

1038
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:22,390
And what's weird about that,
and at least in part,

1039
00:57:22,391 --> 00:57:23,224
I mean Kevin is a complicated place,
but the Australians have actually 

1040
00:57:26,531 --> 00:57:31,531
protected 20% of their oceanic area and 
have promised 20% more recently.

1041
00:57:31,601 --> 00:57:36,601
And they actually seem to mean it,
which is about a third as much territory

1042
00:57:36,611 --> 00:57:37,444
as Australia actually has.
So it is actually possible to set aside 

1043
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:44,110
what are essentially national parks in 
the,

1044
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:47,290
in the ocean and let the damn fish come 
back.

1045
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:48,123
And in principle at least,
that would also be good for the 

1046
00:57:49,931 --> 00:57:53,350
fishermen because they can hang around 
the edges of the parks and you know,

1047
00:57:53,351 --> 00:57:56,770
the fish don't know where the boundaries
are and they can scoop them up once they

1048
00:57:56,771 --> 00:57:57,604
breed again.
So it's a rather cataclysmic and 

1049
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:04,510
staggering Sagat of insane 
mismanagement.

1050
00:58:04,511 --> 00:58:06,640
And you know,
if it's not,

1051
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:07,743
there's not much point in pointing the 
finger one place or another because you 

1052
00:58:10,481 --> 00:58:13,150
know,
it's pretty much everybody's fault.

1053
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:17,710
But it sure seems to me to be one of 
those things that you got to think about

1054
00:58:17,711 --> 00:58:20,350
as being odd.
It's,

1055
00:58:20,351 --> 00:58:21,184
it's,
it's hauntingly foolish because all of 

1056
00:58:24,461 --> 00:58:27,610
that could be there.
And why wouldn't that be a good thing?

1057
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:28,983
And you know,
if there was the political will in 

1058
00:58:30,821 --> 00:58:33,190
Canada,
it could be done because other countries

1059
00:58:33,191 --> 00:58:34,024
have done it.
And for some reason this is just not an 

1060
00:58:35,951 --> 00:58:37,240
on the radar issue.

1061
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:40,510
Even though it's a real issue,
this is actually happening.

1062
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:43,390
It's really not good.
It's happening a lot.

1063
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:46,590
It's going to get worse.
We're not going to have a lot of fish to

1064
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,433
eat.
The oceans are going to be a pretty 

1065
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:52,960
barren and dismal place and we could 
actually do something about it.

1066
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:58,410
So,
so that's why I decided to do this talk,

1067
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,480
even though I don't really know a lot 
about the oceans,

1068
00:59:04,481 --> 00:59:07,660
you know,
I didn't seem to me that the situation.

1069
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:08,913
And so he's dangerous talking about 
things when you sort of know something 

1070
00:59:11,801 --> 00:59:12,634
and most of the adult.
But it seems to me that the situation 

1071
00:59:16,001 --> 00:59:16,834
with the oceans is so obviously not good
that you actually don't have to be an 

1072
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:26,291
expert to notice.
And so what can be done about it?

1073
00:59:26,421 --> 00:59:27,021
Well,
you know,

1074
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:29,420
the only,
I think the marine protected areas are a

1075
00:59:29,421 --> 00:59:30,140
good idea.

1076
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:30,973
It looked,
you know that we have examples of 

1077
00:59:32,481 --> 00:59:36,860
countries doing it and it seems to work.
Everyone's already figured out that it's

1078
00:59:36,861 --> 00:59:39,980
a pretty good idea.
With regards to national parks on land,

1079
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:43,250
no one seems to really dispute that.
Although we know we could have some more

1080
00:59:43,251 --> 00:59:44,084
national parks.
So what's the big problem about having 

1081
00:59:47,331 --> 00:59:48,590
them out in the ocean?
You know,

1082
00:59:48,591 --> 00:59:52,520
and to preserve some of the coastline,
to let the fish have a fighting chance.

1083
00:59:52,521 --> 00:59:54,200
Unless this,
we don't want to have them around,

1084
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:59,590
you know,
and what we're facing in some ways while

1085
00:59:59,991 --> 01:00:03,740
they're starting to process jelly fish 
for food,

1086
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:05,143
because as we get rid of the fish that 
the whole ecosystem starts to turn back 

1087
01:00:09,171 --> 01:00:14,171
to what it was like 400 million years 
ago before there were any fish and there

1088
01:00:15,081 --> 01:00:15,914
were lots of invertebrates and you know,
we could have an ocean full of 

1089
01:00:18,681 --> 01:00:19,514
invertebrates and I hear they press up 
into hockey stick hockey pucks size 

1090
01:00:23,751 --> 01:00:25,130
disks pretty nicely.

1091
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:26,203
They don't have a lot of taste.
And I suppose you'd have to be a pretty 

1092
01:00:28,311 --> 01:00:29,144
good chef to make them animal,
but we probably won't run out of 

1093
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:35,910
jellyfish during our life.
So I dunno,

1094
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:40,240
maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to pen 
and note to your mp or to the,

1095
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:44,120
to the Minister of fisheries or,
and just note that,

1096
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:45,493
you know,
destroying a resource that we could 

1097
01:00:47,841 --> 01:00:48,674
actually enjoy aesthetically and 
practically w destroying that seems to 

1098
01:00:55,881 --> 01:00:59,750
be not in anybody's best interest and 
that it's actually happening at a pretty

1099
01:00:59,751 --> 01:01:03,590
rapid rate.
So I guess that's partly what Finn is,

1100
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:08,770
emmy out and partly why I decided to do 
this talk and also to get involved in,

1101
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:11,180
to invite Dr.
Hanson who's going to,

1102
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,280
who really knows what he's talking 
about,

1103
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:14,383
who's going to speak next.
So we should take a 10 minute break and 

1104
01:01:17,661 --> 01:01:20,390
then we'll return and have darker Henson
speak.

1105
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:25,030
There'll be a question and answer period
at the end of the F at the end of Doctor

1106
01:01:25,031 --> 01:01:27,010
Hanson's talking.
Thank you.

1107
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:32,220
[inaudible].
