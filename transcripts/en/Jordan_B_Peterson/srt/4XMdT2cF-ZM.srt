1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,180
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,740
I'm in Australia and New Zealand off to
New Zealand in the next couple of days

3
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:12,360
and I thought I'd bring you up to date
with a story that's been breaking there

4
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:17,361
that's of some substantial interest
in a certain degree of absurdity.

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,860
A group they're known as Auckland Peace
Action released a press release on

6
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:26,520
Monday 11th of February,

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,520
2019 stating quote Jordan
Peterson threatens everything
of value in our society,

8
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,730
which I had to admit was rather impressive
because that's not an easy thing to

9
00:00:38,731 --> 00:00:42,180
manage. Anyways, I'll read
you a little bit of it.

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,480
What happened after the release was that
a journalist Sean Plunkett interviewed

11
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:53,361
the author or the spokesperson of this
particular press release and then we had

12
00:00:54,931 --> 00:00:56,670
a chance to talk the next day.

13
00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:01,170
And so what you're going to see in this
video is me reading the press release.

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,910
Then you're going to see
Sean interviewing iris,

15
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,100
Quiznos Yak hope I've got that
reasonably right of Oakland peace action.

16
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:15,690
And then you're going to see the full
interview that I had with Sean the next

17
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:18,870
day.
So here goes Jordan.

18
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:22,590
Peterson threatens everything
of value in our society.

19
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,980
In the lead up to Jordan
Peterson's visit to New Zealand,

20
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:30,360
we have a duty to condemn his
sexist, queer, phobic, racist,

21
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:32,550
and deeply reactionary views.

22
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,660
Says Iris [inaudible] of
Oakland Peace Auction.

23
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,850
Jordan Peterson, professor of
psychology at the University of Toronto,

24
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,530
turned right wing media celebrity is
in New Zealand to promote his book.

25
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:49,170
12 rules for life.
This book,

26
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:54,230
while offering superficially useful life
advice to an audience of disaffected

27
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:55,590
white men,

28
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,900
promotes the reactionary misogynistic
view of the world utterly in opposition to

29
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:05,400
New Zealand values. Well, we as
a country have many problems.

30
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:08,310
We can be justly proud of our
values of gender equality,

31
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:13,311
egalitarianism and social inclusivity
says Ms Krizia's Houk Jordan Peterson is

32
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:18,810
actively trying to undermine these values.
This is distinctly unhelpful.

33
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,180
Um,
I won't Redo the rest of it.

34
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,120
You can find it at scoop
politics if you're interested.

35
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,750
And now we'll turn to Shaun's interview
with Iris and his analysis of her

36
00:02:31,261 --> 00:02:32,100
claims.

37
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,910
The Iris, your group has come out
with a press release yesterday.

38
00:02:36,911 --> 00:02:41,350
They got some coverage and sang Jordan
Peterson threatens everything of value

39
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,380
and our society.
Why?

40
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:50,380
Why does telling kids to clean their
room up represent the end of civilization

41
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:51,214
as we know,

42
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,530
telling kids to clean their room
is probably not a bad thing.

43
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,650
It's true. Comes subset of, you know,

44
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,780
are pretty fast from old
Jordan Peterson was doing.

45
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,910
Not really,
that's what this book's about.

46
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,480
That's what he's promoting on us too.

47
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,590
I would say not a few can.
Like,

48
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:25,620
I mean if you take a look at some of
what's actually said in the book and in

49
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:27,560
many of a media comments
he's made elsewhere,

50
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:32,180
it seems quite clear that he has
some seriously problematic of yours.

51
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,930
Okay.
So let's see.

52
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,490
Let's begin with the kind of surface
interview with Camille Paglia. Um,

53
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:45,930
we're in heat a six of what?
Seed? Seed first. Well, you know,

54
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,460
he believes that and discussions
with me and he knows how to,

55
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,490
he knows where he stands.
More waste because

56
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,490
kinds of guests of honor or something.
It's Blacksburg refer to physical thoughts

57
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,890
can put,
uh,

58
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,440
may not be putting barriers around social
interaction between each other because

59
00:04:08,511 --> 00:04:13,511
there's the implicit and underlying
reality that if things get out of control

60
00:04:14,151 --> 00:04:15,500
with me and have a conversation,

61
00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:20,501
there was the possibility of physical
violence and he sees that subconscious

62
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,600
check on how far or how if you like
bitchy a conversation can get these team

63
00:04:26,901 --> 00:04:31,901
could by that knowledge I don't see
does does that vary suggestion or idea,

64
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,790
which I know a lot of people agree with.

65
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,500
Does that threaten Western civilization
and the very foundations in everything

66
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:40,760
of value in our society?

67
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,550
Well, can I just speak about wish I
weren't sick it off western civilization,

68
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,220
but if you consider something like say,

69
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,790
I mean consider basically
how that's going,

70
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,850
how that kind of statement
is going to be raped.

71
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,400
No, I think it's going to be
read by me and saying, yeah,

72
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:04,400
we need to think about
denying the differences,

73
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,990
the biological and I guess behavioral
differences between sexes and we need to

74
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,110
talk about these things honestly and
openly if we're going to make progress on

75
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:15,470
some of the issues of
gender in our society.

76
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,860
All right,
but on the Cultural Mueller where frankly,

77
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,080
homosexuals are still getting beaten up,

78
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,240
we have ridiculous rates of
domestic partner violence. Franklin

79
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,520
just want to check

80
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,250
you have a beaten his wife
or beaten up a homosexual?

81
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,600
No.

82
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,990
Has he ever advocated people beat
their wives will beat homosexuals?

83
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,400
I don't believe he has.

84
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,280
No. Okay, so that'd be a nine right?

85
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,960
Can I please,
can I please continue?

86
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,300
Yeah.

87
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,770
The effect of the allows platform,

88
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,950
there are many people paying
attention to him. Yeah.

89
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,450
If you're making statements
and social situation,

90
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,830
it was vitally important that you kind of,

91
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,180
that's the statements you make cannot be
misread and in such a way as to promote.

92
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,850
I would say, look, everyone's made you,

93
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,970
everyone has made kind of,
if you don't,

94
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:23,260
if you do it repeatedly,

95
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,430
that's all he does.

96
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,680
Or do you think he may be?
He should be shut down.

97
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:40,400
Do you think his ideas are too dangerous
and he shouldn't be allowed to speak in

98
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,234
New Zealand?

99
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,450
The leafy should be shops down.
Here's why we're not doing

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,950
the issue.
How is that his ideas,

101
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,740
his ideas are rather more
problematic thing. I feel your pain,

102
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,490
which, which ideas? Which
ones specifically that you
should clean your room.

103
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,270
That you should hold your shoulders back.

104
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,720
That you should take
responsibility for your own life.

105
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,580
That people shouldn't be compelled
by governments to use words,

106
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,730
particular words in
particular circumstances.

107
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,030
Okay, but one of those particular
words in particular circumstances. Yes,

108
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:13,650
I agree with it.

109
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:18,650
It'd be ridiculous to make some government
to force effectively took you use

110
00:07:19,631 --> 00:07:22,100
government excuse for free,
some governmental force to do that

111
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:27,730
are being read in the media,
including by some people.

112
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:29,121
Yeah.

113
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:32,450
Well he can't be responsible
for the stupidity of people
reading the statements.

114
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,313
Kenny,

115
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,870
again, as I was saying, so do you think
that still are not responsible for,

116
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:39,591
do you think that,

117
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:42,350
do you feel that people are never
responsible for where your fixes or things

118
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:43,184
like that?

119
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,320
Well, yeah. No, not particularly.

120
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:49,030
But I'd also say that it would seem to
me from my observation is the impact that

121
00:07:49,031 --> 00:07:50,990
Jordan Peterson has had on people's lives.

122
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,470
That has been overwhelmingly
positive for a huge number of people,

123
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,510
which is why it's so incredibly popular.

124
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,930
I would point to out so she can say the
same thing about a lot of special smoke

125
00:08:00,931 --> 00:08:03,100
from if they have a very positive
effect on the lives of many.

126
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,840
Are you saying that he's a fascist?

127
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:05,571
No,

128
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:10,571
I'm not saying I am saying I am saying
but he's exploiting all the same kind of

129
00:08:10,841 --> 00:08:11,280
basis.

130
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,510
No exposing anything.

131
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,680
He doesn't compel anyone to go to his
talks to look at his stuff on youtube.

132
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,200
How's it exploiting anyone?

133
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,400
I'm not saying, I mean exploiting in
terms of he is using the same chip.

134
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,680
Like he is using the
same basic psychological
mechanisms to build his base.

135
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,151
Well what base?

136
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:31,610
He's just saying what he thinks
and people happen to be interested.

137
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,130
I used to just thinking he's running some
campaign to destroy the Western world.

138
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:41,883
Hardly.

139
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,790
I just think that he is a
very irresponsible man who is,

140
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,150
well, let's talk about, let's
talk about responsibility.

141
00:08:50,151 --> 00:08:53,360
Shall we and your group or can p section.
Um,

142
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:58,200
you would like people to go and see sit
and films and you're happy to physically

143
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:00,450
into say to stop them
seeing certain films.

144
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:05,451
And in fact your Wellington branch bought
fake bombs to create a terror at in

145
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:10,460
2018 at a film festival and stopped people
watching a film about being Gary and

146
00:09:10,461 --> 00:09:11,294
right.

147
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,810
Is that right,
iris?

148
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,240
Correct.
So you're putting a very negative,

149
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,410
well, let's just faked, I was
just saying some facts, ma'am.

150
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,300
So what do you think is a
greater threat to our society?

151
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,770
Threatening to plant fake bombs in a movie
theater and telling people they can't

152
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:36,350
go and see a movie because
your group doesn't like it.

153
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:40,130
Do you think that's a greater threat
to our society than Jordan Peterson?

154
00:09:40,131 --> 00:09:43,280
Book out a horn, say pay some money
and come and see me. If you want

155
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,960
Jordan piece,
so certainly create a free society.

156
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,380
I can tell you that I've got like I can
tell you that what you're saying about

157
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,360
trans people,
those queer people about a woman.

158
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,520
I've never seen him say
anything negative about women,

159
00:09:59,521 --> 00:10:00,890
trans people or Queer people.

160
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:05,790
I've never seen them be homophobic
or misogynistic. And I believe me,

161
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:08,880
I've watched a lot of what
Jordan Peterson says and does.

162
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,350
I've never once anywhere
seen him being misogynistic,

163
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,820
homophobic,
or transphobic.

164
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,940
Can you point me to an
example where he has been

165
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:26,670
rs?

166
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,970
What do you mean by in this case,
do you mean by an example?

167
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:36,030
We an example where he in any way is
misogynistic, homophobic or transphobic.

168
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,690
So you do not feel that kind of say
you do not feel that effectively saying

169
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,250
you do. Just to be clear, you
don't feel that same with women,

170
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,330
a woman we lipsticks to work in
order to a sexually provocative.

171
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,730
He's not saying that. He's never
said that. What do you see the Iris,

172
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:58,320
what do you see it? Irises if
we need to, if we except Eh,

173
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,890
we've got to have some rules. He
understands the biology of men and women.

174
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:08,410
And he says, uh, main need to respect
women's boundaries. And he is always very,

175
00:11:08,411 --> 00:11:10,900
very clear about that.
But he says,

176
00:11:10,901 --> 00:11:13,270
if we're going to have a
d sexualized workplace,

177
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:14,920
if we're going to have a seat of rules,

178
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:19,900
let's be very clear about what those rules
are. He would argue that my cap, right,

179
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:24,970
that my cap is designed as a sexual
display in its pure, in, in a,

180
00:11:24,971 --> 00:11:26,200
in an academic sense,

181
00:11:26,201 --> 00:11:31,201
people put on on makeup or
have traditionally put on
makeup as a sexual display.

182
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,360
And he said,
okay,

183
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,740
if we're going to have workplaces where
six and any sort of sort of interaction

184
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:42,850
of that nature between the gin, the,
the gene does is off the agenda.

185
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:47,380
Maybe we need to think about makeup in
the workplace. He is not accusing woman,

186
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:50,770
he's not slapped shaming and
he's not sitting there saying,

187
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,020
woman bring it on themselves.
He's just,

188
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,590
we need to be realistic about
what the rules and boundaries are.

189
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,430
Okay,
so a question for you if you will.

190
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,580
So Jordan Peterson,
Jordan Peterson,

191
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:10,370
which clearly I have, which you clearly
feel are, you know, are not problematic.

192
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:10,791
Well,

193
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:14,110
no millions of people think is not
problematic and millions of people think,

194
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:18,310
seem to think he's saying stuff that
no one's had the balls to say for for a

195
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,140
while and they're on board with them.

196
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,380
No one set of both to say
is really pretty passe,

197
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,020
isn't it? That's what I'd say. Your
movement prides itself on doing. Hmm.

198
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,720
Yes. But we aren't saying
it simply to, you know,

199
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,550
because no one else has
the balls to say it.

200
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,610
We say it's because we generate genuinely
believe in our political positions

201
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,610
and I'm sure that that Jordan
Peterson genuinely believes in his,

202
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:44,980
and actually to be honest,

203
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:49,480
they seem more strip mainstreaming and
less of a threat to society than buying

204
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:52,390
fake bombs to scare people out of
going to see a movie in New Zealand.

205
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,570
Just out of curiosity,
how do you feel about,

206
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,850
say I didn't know are bombing
civilians have on society?

207
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,680
Because the is what we're
fundamentally apart.

208
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,780
Okay. Does, does, are you saying
Jordan Peterson bomb civilians?

209
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,850
No, I'm not. What I'm saying.

210
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,260
The why when we're talking about your
press release about Jordan Peterson.

211
00:13:12,261 --> 00:13:13,094
What'd you bring that up?

212
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,420
Well why do you keep on
bringing up stuff about toe?

213
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,600
Cause it's your group that put out the
press release and it's your group that

214
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:22,570
bought fake bombs and said that people
shouldn't go and see a movie you didn't

215
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:23,650
like in a free country.

216
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,653
Well

217
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,840
like if you're going to

218
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:46,920
iris,

219
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,880
I might just be suggesting that your
press releases a little bit over the top.

220
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,100
Are you prepared to admit that
on the back of this interview?

221
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:01,790
No, simply because I simply, because
I'm living kind of on a daily,

222
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,210
daily,
on a fairly regular basis,

223
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,230
what's the Georgian peace talks
are having on his fan base.

224
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:12,750
We are getting repeated consistent
harassment from rebel from frankly Jordan,

225
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,990
from Jordan Peterson fans.

226
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,280
Because if I say sorry,

227
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,810
so Jordan Peterson.

228
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,403
Yes.

229
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,080
Give me an example.
Give me an example.

230
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:37,020
Okay. Source the person
really swift. Frankly,

231
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,033
we uh,

232
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:44,630
look,

233
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:48,560
we got an email from him from frankly
what appears to be a white nationalist.

234
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:53,500
Yeah. We take a look at this. This if
we take a look at a whole bunch of, oh,

235
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,010
frankly,
not the videos.

236
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:00,040
Yeah. Peterson Nazi videos. No. No.

237
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,560
Okay. So what's he gonna do
with that email from the Nazi?

238
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,370
Well, the fact of the matter is that his
fan base, I was saying fan base thing.

239
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,610
I did not, I'm part of his
fan base. I'm not a Nazi.

240
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,680
I'm not suggesting that you are.

241
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:21,420
What would you suggest to anyone who is
does like what he sees is a Nazi? No,

242
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:22,540
that seems pretty wild.

243
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:27,800
What I am suggesting is
what he has created certain
certain subset of the fence,

244
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,040
which may not be the same subset of the
Europe, so I'm pretty sure they ams. Yes.

245
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,390
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

246
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:37,500
It's behaving in,
it's behaving and frankly quite discreet.

247
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,810
Does the subset of his fans that represent
the threat to everything of value in

248
00:15:41,811 --> 00:15:43,670
our society, not Jordan Peterson. Right.

249
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,433
Okay.

250
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,370
Right. But you can say, why didn't
you say that in your press release?

251
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,080
It was Jordan Peterson.

252
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:53,800
He represented the three to
everything of value in our society

253
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,780
because the Jordan Peterson was
calling for us tends to coalesce.

254
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,490
He is encouraging.

255
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,650
Oh he's not,
he's just saying what he thinks.

256
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,190
All right,
so just out of curiosity or I just got to,

257
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,880
where do you draw the line as to what?

258
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,830
Like where do you draw the line as to
responsibility for what you've said?

259
00:16:10,831 --> 00:16:13,680
So yeah, I mean surely you
can't say, look you can't say,

260
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:17,810
but he'll absolutely no responsibility
for the behavior of people who um,

261
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:23,050
effectively the behavior of
people who listen to them and

262
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,013
well I'd be more,

263
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,270
I'd be more worried about the consequences
of buying a fake bomb to scare

264
00:16:28,271 --> 00:16:30,420
someone out of a movie
theater to be honest. Ours

265
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,340
and I had decided,
I think nice nicely on this word as well.

266
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,690
Look,
I think we can all agree that vest,

267
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:45,010
that fet action was soulless
and first we are not like,

268
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,100
and as a result of that you'll notice
that we have not done that again.

269
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,950
Jordan Peterson on Barbara hand handles
only doubling down on his positions.

270
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,063
Yeah.

271
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,900
Many more resources.
A much wider base of support.

272
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:05,400
Yeah. Are you going to visit here and
try and, and protest outside his talk?

273
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,120
Any number of things?
These are things to be doing

274
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:16,360
line or are you going to plan fighting
foams? The places he speaking.

275
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,410
Okay.
That's just unfair.

276
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,450
Oh, okay. Wow.

277
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,240
We've done it once.

278
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,240
I've clearly stated sort of towards a
bad idea and if we don't some teams to

279
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,770
repeat tips.
Okay.

280
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,260
Well RSRs yeah,

281
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,400
as far as we're concerned.
So best thing we can do in order to,

282
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,630
the best thing we can do in
order to counteract speak,

283
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:45,690
just to make people aware
of what his views are.

284
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,000
What are you said and
how else fan base behaves

285
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,260
and all these views are very reasonable
and seem to be having a positive effect

286
00:17:52,261 --> 00:17:56,880
on the massive number of people who were
saying IRS. Well cause it's the truth.

287
00:17:56,881 --> 00:17:58,380
Iris,
I thank you for your time.

288
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:02,970
That's Iris Christianne
of Oakland Pace Action.

289
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,960
So that's that.

290
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:11,020
The Auckland Peace Action
Group did release it.

291
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:14,360
Another press release on the 14th stating

292
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:19,790
Auckland Peace Action is issuing a
statement to publicly correct the record

293
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:24,791
about a protest action that occurred
in Wellington in 2018 there's action

294
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:29,990
occurred at the screening of the film,
Ben Gurion at the dark edge film festival,

295
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:34,490
both Oakland Peace Action and our sister
organization Peace Action Wellington

296
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:39,730
opposed to showing of this film as it is
subject to an international boycott on

297
00:18:39,861 --> 00:18:44,861
behalf of Palestinian civil society
organizations at both Wellington and

298
00:18:45,651 --> 00:18:46,700
Auckland screenings.

299
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:51,800
The screenings were disrupted by
activists with noisemakers and alarms.

300
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,120
Subsequently,

301
00:18:53,121 --> 00:18:57,290
the dark edge director alleged that
there was a fake bomb at the Wellington

302
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:02,180
screening and this was reported by
new hub. This was a complete lie.

303
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:06,170
There was never,
ever any fake bomb of any sort whatsoever,

304
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:10,550
and z police attended both protests and
we're fully aware that the items in the

305
00:19:10,551 --> 00:19:13,490
theaters were noisemakers
as we're the theater goers.

306
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,330
The theater was not evacuated
and no one was arrested.

307
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:22,460
So it appears that at least as far as
Auckland peace action is concerned that

308
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,220
Sean overstated the case in that lecture.

309
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:30,500
In any case the next day I had a
chance to talk to him directly.

310
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,530
And so now we're going to
segue directly into that.

311
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,260
Your face. Let's get the pronouns out
of the way. What would you prefer?

312
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:43,000
I call you professor, Dr. Jordan.
Jordan's spine. Jordan's fine.

313
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,790
I like it that way as well. Um, Jordan,

314
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,600
my first question for you and the
reaction here in New Zealand, um,

315
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,770
to the very idea that you're coming here
or that you're fronting on this show

316
00:19:53,771 --> 00:19:57,750
today. I just got to say, and I've
watched you for a couple of years,

317
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:02,080
you are one of the most
hated people online.

318
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:05,740
Why do you think it is
that while people hate you?

319
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,920
I'm hated by a very small minority
of very noisy and committed people.

320
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,080
Yeah. And so, um,

321
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:18,150
they're noisy and committed and so they
can make a lot of racket and they are

322
00:20:18,271 --> 00:20:22,500
very good at it and often the profit
often professionally trained to do so.

323
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:27,510
And they're very casual with there. What
would you call it? Epithets. I mean,

324
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:32,550
I was listening to you introduced me
and you, you listed off about 20, um,

325
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:36,120
terrible things that I might be
many of which were contradictory,

326
00:20:36,121 --> 00:20:38,430
but that doesn't seem
to make any difference.

327
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,240
Well,
it's so hilarious you,

328
00:20:40,241 --> 00:20:45,241
you kind of get your celebrity gets co
opted from people on all sorts of parts

329
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:50,290
of the political and extremes of
the political spectrum, doesn't it?

330
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,600
Well, I think there's some of that. Um,

331
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:57,020
I don't know if it gets co-opted too
much on the radical left, let's say.

332
00:20:57,021 --> 00:21:01,340
Although I certainly face the majority
of my opposition from the radical left,

333
00:21:01,341 --> 00:21:04,880
but the radical right types
are not very fond of me either.

334
00:21:04,881 --> 00:21:09,881
There was a new book written called
Dianetics by a rather reprehensible

335
00:21:10,071 --> 00:21:11,900
individual named Fox Day.

336
00:21:11,901 --> 00:21:15,410
And if you want to find out what the
ethno nationalists think about me,

337
00:21:15,411 --> 00:21:19,790
that's pretty good read. I wouldn't
call it precisely complimentary.

338
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,960
Hmm.
Look on a personal level,

339
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:26,961
and I'm someone who has fallen foul
of the vagaries of Twitter pylons,

340
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:32,100
but what's directed at you? Is it
a whole different level, Jordan?

341
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,990
And you've admitted, I know that
you have or not struggled, but you,

342
00:21:35,991 --> 00:21:38,910
you admit your, you've had episodes
of depression in your life.

343
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,700
I know people who have been horribly
affected by the most minor pylon on social

344
00:21:44,701 --> 00:21:45,360
media.

345
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,360
How do you as an individual
take or channel that hatred
to Gooden and I imagined

346
00:21:50,971 --> 00:21:52,440
that affects your family as well?

347
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:56,890
Well, part of it is that I have
a pretty solid family. You know,

348
00:21:56,891 --> 00:21:58,690
I have lots of people behind me,

349
00:21:58,691 --> 00:22:03,310
like my wife is firmly behind
me without hesitation. Um,

350
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:09,060
my children are behind me and they're
smart and mature and my parents are behind

351
00:22:09,251 --> 00:22:11,910
me and I have a good
set of friends. And, um,

352
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:17,430
also generally I try not to talk
about things that I don't know.

353
00:22:17,981 --> 00:22:22,450
Something about which also
helps. Yeah. So, and I'm,

354
00:22:22,451 --> 00:22:27,451
I'm not impressed with the sorts of
ideological positions that have been put

355
00:22:27,551 --> 00:22:30,910
forth, especially by the left wing
radical types in the universities.

356
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:36,010
And I understand what they're
doing and why reasonably well. And,

357
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:36,850
um,

358
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:41,850
I feel that whatever vitriol happens to
be directed at me is trivial in terms of

359
00:22:42,251 --> 00:22:47,251
its danger in comparison
to the overwhelming social
danger that these ideologies

360
00:22:49,121 --> 00:22:53,380
are producing. And so better to do
something about it now than to wait.

361
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,190
Hmm. Oh, so, and I,

362
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:00,220
social media world that is dominated
by extremism and hatred and vitriol,

363
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:04,290
uh, people I know who
have have watched you, uh,

364
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:09,340
literally dumbstruck by your ability
to remain civil and to engage in debate

365
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:16,250
without getting angry at those who,
who often absolutely lambasted you.

366
00:23:16,251 --> 00:23:19,910
I think I've only seen there was a debate
you did with Stephen Fry where, uh,

367
00:23:19,911 --> 00:23:23,860
an American pastor had to go and
I think I saw some five there.

368
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:27,440
I think you were genuinely upset,
but you seem to have a remarkable,

369
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,430
remarkable ability to play the ball,
not the man or woman.

370
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,940
Well, that, that debate the monk
debate that you're talking about.

371
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:40,880
Mostly I was upset about the
foolishness, you know, um, the,

372
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:45,910
the person I was debating with Cole called
me an angry white and it just struck

373
00:23:47,031 --> 00:23:47,864
me as so,

374
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:53,020
so rhetorically foolish and
inflammatory and unnecessary.

375
00:23:54,831 --> 00:23:57,530
All of those things at the
same time. Uh, first of all,

376
00:23:57,531 --> 00:24:00,530
he was in Canada and not
in the United States.

377
00:24:00,531 --> 00:24:03,830
And those sorts of statements actually
don't go over very well in Canada.

378
00:24:03,831 --> 00:24:08,360
And my race had absolutely nothing to
do with what we were talking about.

379
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:13,340
And so it was just the kind
of troublemaking statement
that does nothing but

380
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,630
make things worse.

381
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:19,660
And I'm never happy when I see people
behaving in a manner that only makes

382
00:24:20,931 --> 00:24:25,190
things worse. And so
that, that I felt even,

383
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:28,790
it's a funny thing,
I can't say exactly felt bad for him,

384
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:33,230
but I thought it was so foolish of him
to undermine his own credibility in that

385
00:24:33,231 --> 00:24:33,590
manner.

386
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:38,590
It was just this sort of performance
that removes all patients,

387
00:24:38,751 --> 00:24:42,740
you know, a bad rhetorical statement
and unnecessary racist comment,

388
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:46,910
a rhetorical flourish that had nothing
but counterproductive consequences.

389
00:24:46,911 --> 00:24:49,730
As you can see by the youtube commentary,

390
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,760
added nothing at all that
was productive to the debate,

391
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,680
didn't address the issues at hand,

392
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,900
was a cheap method of scoring
points, uh, a way of playing victim.

393
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,800
I mean, it was all together. Um, uh, uh,

394
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:05,480
second grade performance.
And,

395
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:09,530
and because he had academic
pretensions was a professor.

396
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:14,740
I have a lot less patience for professors
and professional journalists than I do

397
00:25:14,871 --> 00:25:19,340
for, you know, other people because, well,
because they're, they're supposed to,

398
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,473
well that's,

399
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,550
I thought Stephen Fry was brilliant
in that debate. I used to,

400
00:25:23,551 --> 00:25:27,090
man started outside. You didn't
agree with a lot of what you said,

401
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,990
but he was going to stand next year and
fight your side. And he also said I'm,

402
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:36,340
the world would be a much better place
if everyone was less convinced of how

403
00:25:36,341 --> 00:25:37,174
right they were.

404
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:39,800
Yeah.
Well Steven Fry is really something,

405
00:25:39,801 --> 00:25:43,460
it was a pleasure to meet him and he's uh,
he's quite the remarkable person.

406
00:25:43,461 --> 00:25:46,190
So that was one of the very
good things about that evening.

407
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:49,590
Hmm. We're going to take a bright Jordan
and then I want to talk to you about an

408
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:54,000
interview I did yesterday and if that's
typical of the stuff that you get.

409
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:58,500
Yeah, that was great. The interview
man, we would talk to Jordan B.

410
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:02,460
Peterson here on magic talk back and just
to see, and we would talk to Jordan B.

411
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,030
Peterson cultural phenomenon.
And according to Oakland Peace Action.

412
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:10,410
The biggest threat to New Zealand's
way of life and civilization that, oh,

413
00:26:10,411 --> 00:26:12,830
I don't know. We've seen
since the last earthquake. Uh,

414
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,660
they came out earlier this week
and through a lot of labels, uh,

415
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,750
at Dr. Peterson and the spokesman,

416
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:23,550
Iris or spokesperson Iris came on
with me yesterday, some of these,

417
00:26:23,551 --> 00:26:28,551
so I could ask them to well provide
the proof of their accusations.

418
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:32,670
Um, I didn't think he did that
well or they did that well, Jordan.

419
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:37,760
Uh, well it was quite the remarkable
interview. I think that, uh,

420
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,000
I don't know how many people have
watched it or listened to it,

421
00:26:41,001 --> 00:26:45,270
but I suspect quite a few and it's
no wonder because it was, it was, um,

422
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:50,280
a real feat of journalistic persistence,

423
00:26:50,281 --> 00:26:53,640
I would say on your part,
you didn't let your,

424
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:59,460
your interviewee off the hook for a moment
and there wasn't much content there.

425
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:03,900
There was a lot of exactly the same sort
of thing that's been happening for the

426
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:06,840
last two years.
It's really quite appalling.

427
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:11,430
And that what seems to happen generally
in the journalistic sphere on the

428
00:27:11,431 --> 00:27:15,000
negative side for me is that
there's a list of epithets that are,

429
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:20,280
it's like all the radical leftists have
a list of epithets that are sort of add

430
00:27:20,281 --> 00:27:24,810
hand. Maybe they have them on a little
sticky on their computer, misogynist,

431
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:29,540
homophobe, Islamophobe
transphobes a bigot, racist. Uh,

432
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:33,030
then there's often some
either Nazi, uh, uh,

433
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,240
Oh,
don't forget you

434
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:40,110
location [inaudible] or
there's Jewish shill,

435
00:27:40,111 --> 00:27:42,590
which is another one that comes
up now and then, and then, um,

436
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:46,530
the idea seems to be that if you don't
agree with what someone says that you

437
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:50,220
just lay out the longest possible list
of Pejorative, that your imagination,

438
00:27:50,221 --> 00:27:54,210
your collective imagination can
generate and hope that one of them is

439
00:27:54,211 --> 00:27:58,980
sufficiently true in some sense because
of something you once said that it

440
00:27:58,981 --> 00:28:03,680
sticks and you're done. And it's,
it's getting downright Dell. I mean,

441
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:08,010
but what seems to be that
liberal journalists throughout
the Western world have

442
00:28:08,011 --> 00:28:11,010
been lining up to try and take you down?

443
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,640
Oh yeah. Well, I mean,

444
00:28:13,641 --> 00:28:17,540
I've had a fair number of journalists
who've been supportive, supportive of me.

445
00:28:17,541 --> 00:28:20,390
Now, whether or not they
are on the liberal side,

446
00:28:20,391 --> 00:28:23,570
there's certainly not on the
radical left side. Um, yes,

447
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,070
this has been happening pretty
much nonstop for two years. Um,

448
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:30,800
and they're basically out of
insults as far as I can tell,

449
00:28:30,801 --> 00:28:32,870
which in some sense disarms them,

450
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:37,040
but they're actually getting rather dull
to read because it's always the same

451
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:37,920
old thing.
Ang,

452
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:41,300
although the person you interviewed
yesterday did have a new twist,

453
00:28:41,301 --> 00:28:45,230
which was greatest threat to
the civilization of New Zealand,

454
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:49,130
which was really quite impressive
as far as pejorative went.

455
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,140
Alright.
So we've dealt with,

456
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:57,900
and now you're in Australia now has the,
if you like,

457
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:01,590
the virulent opposition to
you for whatever reason,

458
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,870
is it starting to subside?

459
00:29:03,871 --> 00:29:07,080
And I know they haven't been protest
as I understand so far in Australia.

460
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,190
Uh, there was a few in Adelaide,
but, uh, about 25 and, and,

461
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:16,650
and they, it wasn't exactly clear
what they were protesting. Um,

462
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:22,110
they seem to be more, uh,
concerned about homosexual rights,

463
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:26,340
um, which I don't really know
what that has to do with me,

464
00:29:26,341 --> 00:29:31,020
but it had to do with whatever they
were interested in. Uh, protesting,

465
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,510
but there was nothing in
Melbourne at all though.

466
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,750
There was quite a large
police presence at the venue.

467
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,600
While there were a lot of people there,
there's about 5,500 people,

468
00:29:39,601 --> 00:29:44,480
but there wasn't a single protester. And
I would say that yes, overall, the, um,

469
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:49,760
very elance and also the frequency
of the hip pieces in the media is,

470
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:55,950
has declined rather precipitously in
the last three or four months. Um,

471
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,870
I think it's because,
well,

472
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:03,930
because it's become dreadfully repetitious
and because no smoking pistol of any

473
00:30:04,751 --> 00:30:06,430
sort has emerged,
you know,

474
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:11,080
people have gone over virtually everything
I've said to students for the last 20

475
00:30:11,081 --> 00:30:16,081
years because almost all of it is recorded
and scoured my Twitter feed and my

476
00:30:17,321 --> 00:30:20,680
Facebook and you know,
all this social media, um,

477
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:25,990
platforms that are usable and haven't
been able to find anything so far that's

478
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:29,540
of sufficient reprehensive bility to,
um,

479
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,990
take my reputation out

480
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,230
the dots so that we have Jordan come on.

481
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,930
Well, it's not just a bit
weird. It's very weird,

482
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,020
but you know,
it's not something I,

483
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,043
let's say.

484
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,620
Alright.
Um,

485
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:53,600
I want to go back two years and in many
ways I look at you and if I was going to

486
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:57,170
put you in a fibril, you're the guy
who said the emperor has no clothes,

487
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:01,700
the emperor of wokeness of political
correctness of third wave feminism.

488
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:06,530
Did you plan two years ago
to be where you are now?

489
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:10,190
I cultural phenomena,
global cultural phenomenon.

490
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,350
Was it all part of some,

491
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:16,760
some clever manipulation
of modern social media?

492
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:20,840
Or did you just stand up and say,
I'm not going to do this?

493
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:22,680
Well,

494
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,280
I mean, I was writing a book and I
was hoping it would be successful.

495
00:31:26,281 --> 00:31:28,170
So there was that.
And you know,

496
00:31:28,171 --> 00:31:33,120
I had been experimenting quite
substantially with, um, with, uh,

497
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:34,500
youtube,
putting my,

498
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:38,490
my lectures from the university on Youtube
and some lectures that I had done for

499
00:31:38,491 --> 00:31:42,690
a small television show and they
were developing a certain following.

500
00:31:42,691 --> 00:31:47,691
So I had about a million views Po far
before the political controversy hit.

501
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:52,470
But no, I mean, there's no way
of predicting what happened.

502
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:56,580
It's completely unpredictable phenomenon.
But a phenomenon,

503
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:01,610
but I can't say that I said what I felt
like saying as carefully as I possibly

504
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:06,420
could and I'd pretty much had
enough of it. I mean, seriously,

505
00:32:06,421 --> 00:32:08,670
I've had enough of it and,
um,

506
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,550
I'm not happy with the radical leftists.

507
00:32:11,551 --> 00:32:15,150
I think the postmodern philosophy is,
um,

508
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:19,830
what intellectually Vapid,
nihilistic, malevolent,

509
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:24,150
destructive, arrogant and
narcissistic, impractical as well.

510
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,290
All at the same time.

511
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:29,760
I think that what's happening to the
humanities and social sciences is borders

512
00:32:29,761 --> 00:32:34,110
on fraudulently criminal.
If it hasn't already passed the line.

513
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:39,260
And I'm absolutely no friend whatsoever
of radical leftist utopians I feel that

514
00:32:41,271 --> 00:32:41,660
there's,

515
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:46,660
after a hundred years of evidence of
complete bloody catastrophe on the side of

516
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:49,160
the radical left,
um,

517
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:53,900
it's time for us to wake up and notice
that something has gone wrong on that end

518
00:32:53,901 --> 00:32:54,734
of the spectrum.

519
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:59,720
And I don't see any responsibility
being taken for that at all. You know,

520
00:32:59,721 --> 00:33:04,310
I've called publicly for the moderate
leftist types who might have some sympathy

521
00:33:04,311 --> 00:33:06,980
for, to draw some lines.
It's like, all right,

522
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:12,050
we know that things can go too far
on the left when exactly where,

523
00:33:12,051 --> 00:33:14,090
where is it that you go too far?

524
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:18,870
Now my sense it's with the equity
doctrine, which I think is, um,

525
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,800
not really emotionally powerful.
Unfortunately. It doesn't have that,

526
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:28,550
that kick that's necessary to make
something really stick in the memory.

527
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:31,650
But I think the idea of
equality of outcome is, um,

528
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:34,670
dangerous beyond comprehension.

529
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:38,700
Oh, Ron, I want to talk about a few
things going on in New Zealand, which is,

530
00:33:38,701 --> 00:33:40,200
you know,
part of the culture war.

531
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:43,060
We are part of the global
community and we connected online.

532
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,580
A fist up we have a cabinet,
um, the Labor Party, uh,

533
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,120
the largest member of a part of our
coalition government. It has a quota,

534
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:55,480
a male female quota for cabinet posts.

535
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,420
What Canada too. Yeah.
What do you think of that?

536
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:02,190
All right, thanks. I think there's
absolutely no excuse for it.

537
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,720
I think that it's an, it's
a, you know, the, the,

538
00:34:04,721 --> 00:34:08,700
the radical leftists are always yammering
on about biological essentialism,

539
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,000
which they are so associated with
something it can to fascism. You know,

540
00:34:12,001 --> 00:34:15,930
the idea that there are mutable biological
characteristics that define people

541
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:19,860
and yet they're the first people to
insist that if you're going to have a

542
00:34:19,861 --> 00:34:24,270
cabinet that is let's say both
competent and representative,

543
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:28,350
that you have to divide it
according to identity categories.

544
00:34:28,351 --> 00:34:32,600
And first and foremost,
perhaps the ones of sex and,

545
00:34:32,601 --> 00:34:37,601
and to pick your cabinet by Genitalia
is not an acceptable technical move.

546
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:43,580
And exactly the same thing happened in
Canada where 25% of our major parties,

547
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,900
elected officials who are female,

548
00:34:45,901 --> 00:34:49,350
but 50% of the cabinet members
or members ended up being female.

549
00:34:49,351 --> 00:34:53,940
And all that means what that certainly
means is that the [inaudible],

550
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:58,770
the most qualified people were not
selected because it's statistically

551
00:34:58,771 --> 00:35:03,510
impossible for them to have been selected.
It was cheap virtue signaling.

552
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,380
And,

553
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:09,380
and it's also technically impossible
even from the perspective of the leftist

554
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:14,670
themselves with their intersectionality
because they insist that people have to

555
00:35:14,671 --> 00:35:19,671
be judged in relationship to their
oppression on multiple dimensions

556
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:21,630
simultaneously.

557
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,820
And I've done some back of the envelope
mathematical calculations and if you

558
00:35:26,821 --> 00:35:29,310
have 10 dimensions that mark you out,

559
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,860
let's say as in terms of your,

560
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,590
of the group affiliations
that characterize you,

561
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:39,700
then you're the only person like
that the world. So as you multiply,

562
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:44,160
all you have to do is do the math as you
multiply the number of groups that have

563
00:35:44,161 --> 00:35:49,140
to be given favored status because if
there hypothetically oppressed situation,

564
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:54,590
then you make it increasingly impossible
for equality of outcome to even be to,

565
00:35:56,131 --> 00:36:00,600
to, to be something that can
be practically implemented
without a bureaucracy of,

566
00:36:00,601 --> 00:36:02,460
of terrifying proportions.

567
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:06,420
We also have a ministry of Women's
affairs in New Zealand and the Minister of

568
00:36:06,421 --> 00:36:08,550
women's of feasible,
the minister for a woman is,

569
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:13,551
she's known suggested recently that they
were too many white old men on boards

570
00:36:15,851 --> 00:36:16,471
in New Zealand,

571
00:36:16,471 --> 00:36:20,940
the private and public companies and
just suggested that they needed to move

572
00:36:20,941 --> 00:36:23,850
aside so there could be more diversity.

573
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,520
Your response to that suggestion?

574
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:32,730
Well, um, what, what's her racial
and ethnic background just out of

575
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:36,210
hear you? I think she's born
in America. Julianne. Gina.

576
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:41,410
She's a member of green potty. Yeah.
Is she white? Yes. Well maybe it,

577
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,790
it's time for her to bloody well move
aside and let someone who isn't white have

578
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:47,010
her position.
All right,

579
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,350
so you've done a great job
with Julianne Jeans. Instance.

580
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:54,490
There's also, look, they've tried this
in Scandinavia where they put, you know,

581
00:36:54,491 --> 00:36:58,510
they've put quotas for females on boards
and part of the idea was that if you

582
00:36:58,511 --> 00:37:03,220
did that that you would increase the
rate at which women would move through

583
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:08,400
managerial and administrative status
rankings and that has had zero success.

584
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:14,160
This suggestion also is Jordan,
that actually women can somehow um,

585
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:18,490
up the financial performance
of companies sure.

586
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:21,990
That you don't believe
they'd stats that resonance.

587
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:26,650
No evidence for that. What, what,
what elevates the financial, uh,

588
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,860
productivity of companies is quite clear.
Trait conscientiousness,

589
00:37:30,861 --> 00:37:34,450
which is a marker for integrity
and trustworthiness and diligence,

590
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:39,410
diligence and due to fullness is a very
good predictor of long term economic

591
00:37:39,411 --> 00:37:40,244
productivity.

592
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:45,370
And so his general cognitive ability
and that holds across sexes and races.

593
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,690
And the reason for that,

594
00:37:47,691 --> 00:37:52,691
and this is the non racist and nonsexist
way of looking at the world by the way,

595
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:58,750
is that there is far more dif difference
between individuals within groups than

596
00:37:59,061 --> 00:38:03,440
there are between groups. Because
look, the fundamental racist,

597
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,330
sexist,
uh,

598
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:10,540
ethnocentric proposition is that there
are more differences between groups of

599
00:38:10,911 --> 00:38:14,100
people then there are within
groups of people. Yeah.

600
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:16,640
That's essentially the racist doctorate.
Yeah.

601
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,920
And so we need some black
people because you know,

602
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,630
all those black people are the same.

603
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,690
And unless we have a voice
or two from a black person,

604
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:28,900
then we don't have that set of
identity issues represent it.

605
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:31,873
Well,

606
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:37,050
it's just simply not the case because
most of the diversity comes at the level

607
00:38:37,721 --> 00:38:39,610
of individual personality and temperament.

608
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,090
And the literature on that is crystal
clear. You know, these, these,

609
00:38:43,091 --> 00:38:47,020
these are pseudo intellectual claims
made by people on the radical left and

610
00:38:47,021 --> 00:38:51,610
they're very dangerous because they're
easily shifted into the sorts of things

611
00:38:51,611 --> 00:38:55,090
that the radical right likes
to enjoy, which is, oh, I see.

612
00:38:55,270 --> 00:39:00,270
There are immutable differences between
Gen the sexist and the races and there

613
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:05,600
are substantial import.
And that we, we, we,

614
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:10,150
we, we are, we need to take them
into account when we're, uh,

615
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:12,100
uh, what, what,

616
00:39:12,101 --> 00:39:16,570
what would you just say formulating such
things as immigration policy. So no,

617
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,230
there's no evidence that
those claims are correct and,

618
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:23,860
and there's counter evidence for much of
it for so example in, in Scandinavian,

619
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:27,120
and this is,
this is as close to psychological factors,

620
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:32,130
any thoughts that exist is that as
you increase equality of opportunity,

621
00:39:33,311 --> 00:39:37,110
which means you open the doors for more
and more people and especially in let's

622
00:39:37,111 --> 00:39:39,640
say with regards to sex. Um, and,

623
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:42,610
and that's had a big effect because of
course there's far more women in the

624
00:39:42,611 --> 00:39:44,860
workforce than there than there once was.

625
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:50,010
You increase the degree to which
outcomes differ on multiple dimensions.

626
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:54,250
And that's partly, there's a variety
of reasons for that. At least a dozen.

627
00:39:54,251 --> 00:39:57,820
And they're all important,
one of which is that women,

628
00:39:57,821 --> 00:40:01,780
especially once they hit their
thirties prefer to work part time.

629
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,630
And that's not bad or wrong.

630
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:08,110
And it's certainly not an
indication of systemic sexism.

631
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:12,130
So the radical types like
to have one explanation.

632
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,270
Everyone isn't exactly the
same with regards to outcome.

633
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:19,570
Therefore the system is
a corrupt patriarchy.

634
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,480
It's like you can learn
that in one minute in a,

635
00:40:22,481 --> 00:40:26,800
in a propaganda course in university
and then you have an answer for every

636
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:27,910
problem that ever be,

637
00:40:27,911 --> 00:40:31,930
sets you politically for the rest of
your life and there's no excuse for it.

638
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,940
It's appalling scholarship.

639
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,910
I want to come back to that point.
The other thing, Bill proposed,

640
00:40:37,911 --> 00:40:42,911
bill we hit before at parliament is the
idea of six self identification to make

641
00:40:43,071 --> 00:40:48,071
it easier for people to alter their
birth certificates if they choose to

642
00:40:48,621 --> 00:40:53,621
identify as anything other
than the sex they were born as.

643
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:56,900
You'll views on on that
sort of legislation.

644
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,870
Well,
the first thing I would say,

645
00:40:58,871 --> 00:41:02,410
it might be useful to really
address some important problems.

646
00:41:02,411 --> 00:41:06,700
That would be the first thing is you're
dealing with an absolutely tiny minority

647
00:41:06,701 --> 00:41:09,520
of people.
Not that that's completely without import.

648
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:14,470
But the second thing is it has to be
thought through and it's not, I mean,

649
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,290
I don't know if you've been following,

650
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,391
oh,

651
00:41:18,391 --> 00:41:23,391
we just having a little hiccup there
and we're talking to Dr. Jordan B.

652
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:26,310
Peterson, who's joining us
from Scott, from Sydney,
Jordan. We were talking about,

653
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:31,580
so six self od did vacation, uh, changes
or proposed reforms in New Zealand.

654
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:34,280
You see it firstly,
it's a number

655
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,790
of people affected and seeking.
Did you say we need to think it through?

656
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:42,350
In what way? Well, one of the
things that's happened for example,

657
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:44,150
so really what this is,

658
00:41:44,151 --> 00:41:49,151
is an attempt by a certain
ideological movement too,

659
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:54,820
to put forth the insistence that sex
is only a sociological construct,

660
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:01,900
that it's only something learned and
so that it can be changed at whim,

661
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,550
which is also a strange thing
because if it's learned,

662
00:42:04,551 --> 00:42:08,060
it can't really be changed at whim.
And also if it's learned,

663
00:42:08,061 --> 00:42:09,170
it could be unlearned,

664
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:12,740
which is something that the people who
are putting this legislation forward

665
00:42:12,741 --> 00:42:17,000
aren't really thinking through because
that opens up the opportunity for people

666
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:22,001
who would like to reform people who
would like to change their gender back to

667
00:42:22,671 --> 00:42:26,060
say normative behavior. Because if
it's learned, it can be unlearned.

668
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:31,430
But more importantly,
sex roles are not only learned there,

669
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:35,810
partly learned and there's plenty of
biological differences between men and

670
00:42:35,811 --> 00:42:38,960
women and,
and many of them aren't trivial,

671
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:42,020
like men and women are more the
same than they are different.

672
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,530
But the differences are
quite market at the extremes.

673
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,420
And so what we're seeing partly as a
consequence of this now is the movement of

674
00:42:50,421 --> 00:42:55,400
say Trans Women into female sports. You
saw this in Minnesota just the other day,

675
00:42:55,401 --> 00:42:59,100
I think it was Minnesota where I knew Lee,
um,

676
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:05,290
transition trans woman has been shattering
the weightlifting records for women

677
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:11,770
and Commonwealth Games competitor.
It was a form of mind. Yes,

678
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:16,190
it's absolutely insane. You know, I mean,

679
00:43:16,191 --> 00:43:20,390
first the fact that it's allowed to
begin with is beyond comprehension.

680
00:43:20,391 --> 00:43:22,520
It's a real sign of cultural insanity.

681
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,570
And the second is that psychologically
it's almost incomprehensible.

682
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:31,571
I can't imagine how you could be a man
who transformed himself into a woman and

683
00:43:34,101 --> 00:43:35,810
all the ways that that's possible.

684
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:41,050
And then decided to go compete in it
at a high level sports arena with women

685
00:43:41,721 --> 00:43:46,721
who've been training their whole lives
to hit the peak of their ability and then

686
00:43:46,881 --> 00:43:51,410
to absolutely bloody demolish them,
say after a year of work.

687
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:55,790
And then to tout that as some
sort of victory for the oppressed.

688
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,590
It's completely what's narcissistic
beyond comprehension. And it's,

689
00:44:00,591 --> 00:44:02,180
it's, it's, well,

690
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:07,100
it's a sign of what happens when you
don't carefully think things through.

691
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:11,420
All sorts of unexpected consequences
tend to manifest themselves.

692
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:15,650
And you'll see the same thing happening
now with rapid onset gender dysphoria

693
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:20,780
and the treatment of very young people
with very powerful hormonal and surgical

694
00:44:20,781 --> 00:44:25,460
techniques designed to permanently alter
their psychophysiological structure.

695
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,450
And like,

696
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:31,200
we're going to pay for this in a big way
in 15 years when these kids grow up and

697
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:36,201
hit adulthood and start tossing out
lawsuits as they certainly will.

698
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:37,810
And should we're,

699
00:44:37,811 --> 00:44:41,430
we're going to look back and wonder just
exactly what the hell was wrong with us.

700
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:44,610
So it's, it's, it's, it's, well,

701
00:44:44,611 --> 00:44:49,611
it's driven by this ideology that that's
been formulated by people like Judith

702
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,470
Butler who absolutely insist because
they have no biological knowledge,

703
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:57,120
which whatsoever that all the differences
between men and women are socially

704
00:44:57,121 --> 00:45:00,420
constructed,
which is absolutely not true.

705
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:03,920
Absolutely. In general terms, Jordan,

706
00:45:03,921 --> 00:45:07,880
and we have it in this country and indeed
everywhere we look at the millennial

707
00:45:07,881 --> 00:45:11,810
generation, they get a bit of
stick here. The cold snow flakes,

708
00:45:11,811 --> 00:45:14,780
they seem to get outraged not on the,
on their own behalf,

709
00:45:14,781 --> 00:45:17,720
but on behalf of others
at the drop of a hat.

710
00:45:17,721 --> 00:45:22,721
And they use social media as elsewhere
in the world to call out the things they

711
00:45:23,271 --> 00:45:25,880
find offensive or the feelings.

712
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:31,460
Do you think there is a
collective generational
psychosis occurring because of

713
00:45:31,461 --> 00:45:32,360
social media?

714
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,320
Um,

715
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:40,270
I don't know if the millennial
generation is any less sane than the baby

716
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:40,781
boomers.

717
00:45:40,781 --> 00:45:45,010
I mean the baby boomers had plenty of
trouble and they cost plenty of grief and

718
00:45:45,011 --> 00:45:48,700
misery in the 1960s and experimented,
you know,

719
00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:53,730
crazily with psychedelic drugs and a wild
lifestyle and promiscuous sex and all

720
00:45:54,041 --> 00:45:54,791
of those things.

721
00:45:54,791 --> 00:45:58,900
And I don't think that the millennials
are any worse or any better.

722
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,730
I do think that,
um,

723
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:06,030
there is a small subset of them who are
rather dependent and rather narcissistic

724
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:13,270
and who are being encouraged in both
of those by reprehensible adults in

725
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:18,040
positions of authority primarily in the
universities to make the most of their

726
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,110
victim hood feelings and status.

727
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:25,470
And I do think that the
social media platforms also
allow for a disproportionate

728
00:46:28,241 --> 00:46:33,241
effect of social effect of people
who have extreme views that also in

729
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:36,670
combination with the,
with the increasing death of the,

730
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:39,430
of the standard collective media,

731
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:42,460
which is increasingly
desperate for attention.

732
00:46:42,461 --> 00:46:47,320
And so we'll spend more and more attention
paying to people who paying spends

733
00:46:47,321 --> 00:46:51,250
more and more time paying attention to
people who have extreme views on the

734
00:46:51,251 --> 00:46:52,084
right end of life.

735
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,300
Making that

736
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:00,440
well, it's, it's possible.
Well, I bet. I mean,

737
00:47:00,441 --> 00:47:04,670
I've certainly been represented as an
extreme figure and that's really something

738
00:47:04,671 --> 00:47:04,910
that,

739
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:09,200
apart from the fact that I'm adamant in
my opposition to the radical leftists,

740
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:11,600
which is rather rare among intellectuals,

741
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:15,830
which brings us rather nicely,
Jordan, to what I'm talking about.

742
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:20,390
I asked people to call and use today
and it was remarkable the variety and

743
00:47:20,391 --> 00:47:23,990
number of people who sent me messages and
rang and said simply reading your book

744
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,990
had changed their life.
And uh,

745
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:29,980
can I just put a call out if you want to
talk to Jordan, we've got quarter, hour,

746
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:32,110
hour, 808 four four, seven, four, seven.

747
00:47:32,111 --> 00:47:36,430
If you'd like to ask a question or seem
the mason jar or just say something to

748
00:47:36,431 --> 00:47:40,870
Jordan, you can ring in now are 808
four four, seven, four, seven Jordan,

749
00:47:40,871 --> 00:47:42,010
it also seems to me,

750
00:47:42,011 --> 00:47:45,430
as much as I see all the hatred against
you and the controversy around you

751
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,050
online,
Geez,

752
00:47:47,051 --> 00:47:50,590
there's a lot of love there and there's
a lot of positivity and you seem to be

753
00:47:50,591 --> 00:47:53,080
engaging and smiling
and with young people,

754
00:47:53,890 --> 00:47:55,780
there's some good stuff happening here,
isn't there?

755
00:47:56,770 --> 00:47:59,890
Oh yeah, way, way more
than the, like the, the,

756
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:04,980
the vitriol vitriolic aspect of it
is only a sporadic bother to me.

757
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:07,750
Um,

758
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:12,750
usually in the aftermath of a
particularly difficult interview with a

759
00:48:12,761 --> 00:48:15,790
journalist, but the tour, I mean,

760
00:48:15,791 --> 00:48:19,750
I've been to about 140
cities now around the world,

761
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:22,390
and the average audience size is,
well,

762
00:48:22,391 --> 00:48:26,950
it's varied between 20 508,000, um, with,

763
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:31,190
I would say an average of about
2,500 to 3000. And they're,

764
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,550
the events are unbelievably,
yeah. Positive.

765
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:39,390
So most of the time I'm surrounded
by nothing but positive responses.

766
00:48:39,731 --> 00:48:44,590
And when I go out on the
street, no, wherever I go,

767
00:48:44,591 --> 00:48:48,220
you know, in a typical hour all
be stopped by six or seven people.

768
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:52,060
They're usually young men
because the media has convinced.

769
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:56,210
Yeah, I actually was going
to say yesterday we had
justice been a young woman and

770
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,280
middle aged women and
middle age men ringing in.

771
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:03,000
Well, that's good. I think that's changed
to some degree because of the book. But,

772
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:03,570
um,

773
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:07,410
all of the interactions that I have with
people on the street or in airports or

774
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:12,190
so on, they're all incredibly positive.
People are very polite. They come up, uh,

775
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:16,020
they're usually apologetic for
interrupting. They introduced themselves.

776
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:20,610
They tell me that watching my lectures
are listening to the audio or reading the

777
00:49:20,611 --> 00:49:24,570
book has changed their life. They usually
tell me a story about what's changed.

778
00:49:24,571 --> 00:49:25,300
They have a better time.

779
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,960
What office do that in real time right
now. Um, Jordan, say hello to Rachel.

780
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:33,050
Hello Rachel. Oh, cure to Jordan. Um,

781
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:37,610
I'm doing nervous to be talking
to you and I'm gonna not very,

782
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:40,580
very good at being precise in Westminster
and when I keep it very brief and just

783
00:49:40,581 --> 00:49:43,860
say thank you as all I wanted to say.
Um,

784
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:48,880
I'm one of the people whose life has been
changed immeasurably by your book and

785
00:49:49,341 --> 00:49:54,170
your lectures and everything that you
stand for has really had a massive

786
00:49:54,171 --> 00:49:57,340
positive influence on me. So I just
wanted to tell you how grateful I am.

787
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:59,500
I was. So, what's changed?

788
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:05,560
Uh, it would take a very long time to get
into it, but I have struggled with, uh,

789
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:09,500
mental health issues for the
majority of my life since puberty.

790
00:50:09,501 --> 00:50:14,270
I'm 30 now and I've been through
every type of treatment, counseling,

791
00:50:14,271 --> 00:50:18,290
therapy, medication, everything
you can think of and you know,

792
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,260
things have helped me briefly for a
little while and got better and then got

793
00:50:21,261 --> 00:50:23,160
worse again. But your book, um,

794
00:50:23,870 --> 00:50:28,370
I guess it's the adoption of personal
responsibility more than anything. And,

795
00:50:28,371 --> 00:50:33,140
and the more responsibility I take on,
the more I find I'm able to in,

796
00:50:33,141 --> 00:50:36,530
the more I'm able to get myself out
there and put myself in situations I

797
00:50:36,531 --> 00:50:40,130
wouldn't have normally had the confidence
to. I'm standing up straighter.

798
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,530
I'm not that great at
keeping my room tidy yet,

799
00:50:42,531 --> 00:50:46,700
but I'm working on it a little things,
everything just bit by bit.

800
00:50:46,701 --> 00:50:48,830
The more I take on, the
more, the bigger it gets.

801
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:52,800
Yes. Well that's a good rule.
That's a good rule. You know,

802
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,840
that's a good psychotherapeutic rule
is the more that you take on without

803
00:50:56,841 --> 00:50:59,840
overloading yourself, you know, because
you have to be sensible about it.

804
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:05,240
The more you find that you have
abilities that will manifest themselves,

805
00:51:05,241 --> 00:51:09,980
that had been hidden up to that point
because of fear and avoidance and so more

806
00:51:09,981 --> 00:51:12,770
power to you as far as I'm concerned.

807
00:51:12,771 --> 00:51:15,950
And I'm very glad to hear that what
I've been doing has been helpful.

808
00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:18,350
Good on your Rachel. Mary, welcome.

809
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:23,520
Um, thank you very much for
this opportunity. I'm doctor,

810
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:29,040
I was staring into the
abyss and now I'm not.

811
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:33,290
Um, I moved through my life. It was fleet.

812
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:38,490
Consider every action and reaction,
uh,

813
00:51:38,491 --> 00:51:41,660
treat myself like I'm someone,
a kid for four.

814
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:47,300
It's been a revelation
to me encountering you.

815
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,140
I was in a very,
very,

816
00:51:49,141 --> 00:51:52,420
very top slice and somehow
I found you online.

817
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:55,360
I don't know if it was
through Dave Rubin or,

818
00:51:55,730 --> 00:52:00,630
or who Shapiro or, or, um, I'm
not quite sure how it happened,

819
00:52:00,631 --> 00:52:03,150
but I've seen the Ilitches have,
I'll listen to it.

820
00:52:03,151 --> 00:52:07,240
You mentioned meaning your
elixirs on Genesis. Um,

821
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:11,880
and it's just been a remarkable turnaround
in my life and my family's life.

822
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:14,460
Um,
and I just want to say thank you.

823
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,580
Hey Man, I'm thrilled
to hear it. So do you,

824
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:20,490
do you have any sense of
what in particular did it,

825
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:22,710
like what was it that struck you?

826
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:29,330
I think it just depends on the store
way that you spoke and it was just such

827
00:52:29,581 --> 00:52:33,360
plain English. It was, as
you described previously,

828
00:52:33,361 --> 00:52:36,960
that was some rules are I
sort of sort of cliches,

829
00:52:36,961 --> 00:52:40,650
but they hadn't been spoken
of in a very long time.

830
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:46,200
And it was as the previous coolest state,
that positional responsibility, the,

831
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:51,910
the taking care of oneself and
it just struck such a chord.

832
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:56,460
It was, I knew some of the things that
you were saying, I'd heard them before,

833
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:01,670
but I hadn't had them in a very long time.
My father used to say, yeah, I'm strike.

834
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,650
We just showed his bag and,
and finally there was a game,

835
00:53:04,651 --> 00:53:07,730
but it was being seen in a different
way. And it, yeah, it wasn't

836
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:13,300
I why Aa, that's, that's
the thing. And that's what I
tried to do with my lectures.

837
00:53:13,301 --> 00:53:15,880
And partly because I'm a
behavioral psychologist,

838
00:53:15,881 --> 00:53:18,940
it's like we have all
these more rules and,

839
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:20,890
and people are told the rules,

840
00:53:20,891 --> 00:53:25,891
but they're very seldom
given a multidimensional of
why the rules are necessary.

841
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:28,740
You know,

842
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:32,020
it's while you should do it because that's
what people do or that's because you

843
00:53:32,021 --> 00:53:32,220
know,

844
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:35,850
that's what good people do or it's your
responsibility and all those things are

845
00:53:35,851 --> 00:53:36,211
true.

846
00:53:36,211 --> 00:53:41,211
But the explanation of why it's true and
how it's related to the responsibility

847
00:53:43,201 --> 00:53:46,800
that gives your life meaning
and also improves the world,

848
00:53:46,801 --> 00:53:50,070
your family and the community,
that's, that's often lacking.

849
00:53:50,071 --> 00:53:53,780
And so that's what I was trying to
provide and in as clear and, and,

850
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:58,320
and in English, as clear as I
could manage it. And so, you know,

851
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:03,210
it, I've tried to make it practical and
useful for people and I'm really very,

852
00:54:03,211 --> 00:54:06,840
very happy to hear that it's
worked for you and for your family.

853
00:54:06,841 --> 00:54:11,520
I'm thrilled to hear it as I always
am when I hear a story like that. Um,

854
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,490
pizza joins us now.
Welcome Peter.

855
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:18,260
Well, you're doing, yeah. Hello. Um,

856
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:20,080
hello.
How are you doing Peter?

857
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:21,890
Very, very little hay. Um,

858
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:27,610
have you in a moment of self
reflection head a little bit on,

859
00:54:27,771 --> 00:54:32,310
on this amazing and astounding
following you created and,

860
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:37,220
and one did where it's going to end up
because at the risk of sending oxymoronic,

861
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:41,420
you're probably the closest thing to
secular humanist. Here's to a messiah.

862
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:46,540
Well,
I thought about that.

863
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:49,990
I wouldn't say precisely
in those terms. Um, I mean,

864
00:54:49,991 --> 00:54:54,100
one of the things I did learn from
studying Carl Young years ago was that if

865
00:54:54,101 --> 00:54:57,790
you're going to talk about archetipal
stories, which I do all the time,

866
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:02,770
did you have to be very careful not to
confuse yourself with the archetype,

867
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:04,470
you know? And so I'm, I'm,

868
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:09,690
I'm very cognizant of the danger
of the kind of popularity that I'm

869
00:55:09,851 --> 00:55:13,930
experiencing. And I do mean the
danger because the higher you fly,

870
00:55:13,931 --> 00:55:15,950
the faster you can fall.
And,

871
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:20,560
and you have to be very careful to
ensure that you're not increasing the

872
00:55:20,561 --> 00:55:22,550
probability of that.
Um,

873
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:27,920
I try to make sure that I credit other
people with many of the ideas that I,

874
00:55:27,921 --> 00:55:29,360
I've formulated and,

875
00:55:29,361 --> 00:55:33,040
and because I've learned a lot from
reading the great clinicians and,

876
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:38,350
and philosophers have the last say 150
years and from my clinical practice and

877
00:55:38,351 --> 00:55:39,250
so on.
And so,

878
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:43,810
and I think of this endeavor
not as something that I'm doing,

879
00:55:43,811 --> 00:55:48,811
but as something that we're
all collectively engaged
in because I know that you

880
00:55:49,751 --> 00:55:50,050
know,

881
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:55,050
that there's an old idea that every person
is a center of the world and that the

882
00:55:55,061 --> 00:56:00,061
weight of the world for better or worse
ways upon the shoulders of each person.

883
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:03,940
And I really believe that's true.
And so if you know that,

884
00:56:03,941 --> 00:56:08,941
then it keeps the ego TISM
and the arrogance down partly
out of sheer terror and

885
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:13,330
it makes it much more
effective to deal with people.

886
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:17,770
Like when I'm lecturing in front of an
audience, I'm not lecturing to them,

887
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:22,630
you know, I'm lecturing with them,
talking about problems that we all have,

888
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:27,400
including me and aims that we all
hold, need to develop, including me.

889
00:56:27,401 --> 00:56:31,480
And you have to include yourself, so
to speak, among the centers and the,

890
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:35,910
and the reprehensible types in order
to communicate with people properly.

891
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:41,070
I do my best to ensure that I'm starkly
aware of my shortcomings and false,

892
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:44,650
that every moment I can possibly manage.

893
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:49,920
And I have family and friends who also
help keep what I'm doing and check and to

894
00:56:51,101 --> 00:56:54,430
make sure that it's not going sideways
in some manner. That's, you know,

895
00:56:54,431 --> 00:56:58,630
where I'm taking things for granted or
becoming arrogant or any of that. And so,

896
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:03,580
so far that's worked out well and
hopefully it will continue to.

897
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:06,070
Joe,
welcome to the program.

898
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,180
Oh, hi Joe. Thanks for
talking with me. Uh, Jordan.

899
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:11,760
Okay.

900
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:12,900
Hi Joe.
How are you doing?

901
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,290
Good,
thank you.

902
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:19,290
So I'm a young academic in New
Zealand and one of the problems,

903
00:57:19,301 --> 00:57:23,380
well one of the stations I would say we
haven't needed this days is focused on

904
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:28,750
race and gender.
So I'm,

905
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:33,100
I would call a centrist position,
um, somewhat liberal minded.

906
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:38,490
But what advice would you give a
young academic pushing against the,

907
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:42,520
what I see is the file if the
gender of the universities.

908
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:44,851
Well,

909
00:57:44,851 --> 00:57:48,600
the first thing I would say is there a
lot more moderate types of your store

910
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:49,590
then you think.

911
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:54,510
And so if you're a careful person and
you're thinking things through and you

912
00:57:54,511 --> 00:57:57,240
have things to object to,
you can be sure,

913
00:57:57,270 --> 00:58:01,740
virtually sure that a majority of people
agree with you even though there are

914
00:58:01,741 --> 00:58:06,300
two. Um, how loud let's say, uh,

915
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,820
to, to speak up. Um,

916
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:13,170
I would say get your thoughts in order,
you know, so you know what you stand for.

917
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:18,410
And then I would also say don't agree
with anything that you don't agree with

918
00:58:18,690 --> 00:58:22,170
because all that'll happen. Yeah.
And you're a young academic.

919
00:58:22,171 --> 00:58:27,171
All the will happen if you compromise
your intellectual Saul like increment by

920
00:58:29,161 --> 00:58:34,161
increment over the next 10 years is
that you will end up alcoholic and,

921
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:36,480
and bitter,
hating your job,

922
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:41,660
despised by your undergraduates and
absolutely sick of your existence.

923
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:46,620
And it's like you gotta keep that
really firmly in mind because every time

924
00:58:46,621 --> 00:58:50,910
you're called upon to stand forth
or something you believe in, it's a,

925
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:56,210
it's a test of character and courage and
it's easy to put it off because it's a

926
00:58:56,491 --> 00:59:00,750
lot of trouble. You know, it's a lot of
conflict and you might think, Oh God,

927
00:59:00,751 --> 00:59:03,720
do I really have to go through with this?
I've got other things to do.

928
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:05,760
And if the answer is,
well,

929
00:59:05,761 --> 00:59:10,560
I better stand up for what I believe
in now because if I keep letting it go

930
00:59:10,561 --> 00:59:13,230
increment by increment
for the next 10 years,

931
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:18,000
I'm going to end up in a position that
that is absolutely dreadful. You know,

932
00:59:18,001 --> 00:59:22,910
you'll be much older than you need to
be and all of the thrill that should be

933
00:59:22,911 --> 00:59:27,740
part of teaching young people and doing
research and staying on the cutting edge

934
00:59:27,741 --> 00:59:28,460
of knowledge.

935
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:33,110
All of that will have been taken away
by the India logs who already know

936
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:37,940
everything and insist that they get
to regulate what you think and say.

937
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:41,110
So good to have the small fights.
One by one

938
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:45,200
value of the lucky last is the
coolest Jordan's split yet.

939
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:48,960
Yes.
Talk to Jordan Peterson.

940
00:59:48,961 --> 00:59:51,960
You are awesome man are already
booked and we were following you.

941
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:55,770
I'm a student of psychology
philosophy myself.

942
00:59:55,771 --> 01:00:00,771
I did a degree and I'm doing my
post here and a lot of what you say,

943
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:05,340
you know, there's a wee bit of
each in there and um, you know,

944
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:10,280
and I totally agree because we live
in a, sorry, where like for me,

945
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:12,980
I often say what I think and
I have to moderate there,

946
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:17,180
but particularly today in our society,
when you do that,

947
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:22,000
you're in way more trouble for
offending someone or something and all.

948
01:00:22,001 --> 01:00:26,090
I love the fact that you kind of get it
out there and I wish that you know it,

949
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:30,150
it'll be handy to just didn't get it out
and people can hear and get over one.

950
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:34,730
One question I was wanting to
ask you though. I mean I'm a,

951
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:40,820
I'm a Christian, but I studied,
um, mock is, she really is,

952
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,560
and I read his book and I feel those
books. I, you went to stoicism.

953
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:46,943
Um,
not,

954
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:51,810
I wouldn't say specifically lots of people
who have been studying stoicism have

955
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:54,360
talked to me and suggested
that I should be.

956
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:59,660
The overlap I think is that the stoic
virtues have been radically underplayed in

957
01:01:01,171 --> 01:01:02,750
our society.
Um,

958
01:01:02,970 --> 01:01:07,520
because we have this idea that life is
easy and that we should be happy and

959
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:11,070
well, first of all, life isn't easy
and perhaps we should be happy.

960
01:01:11,071 --> 01:01:13,020
But there's lots of times
when we're not going to,

961
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:18,930
I hate to break this up, both coming up
to the news. We've got calls stacked up.

962
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:24,900
I'm hoping to meet you when you come here
and I'd like to invite you now if you

963
01:01:24,901 --> 01:01:29,220
get any spare time and you'll share
jewel to come into the studio because

964
01:01:29,221 --> 01:01:32,250
literally our boards are full with
people who want to talk to you.

965
01:01:32,251 --> 01:01:37,020
I also want to thank you enormously for
your time today and for assuring us that

966
01:01:37,021 --> 01:01:38,190
you will not,
you know,

967
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:42,600
they to the visit will not lead to the
downfall of New Zealand's civilization as

968
01:01:42,601 --> 01:01:43,100
we know it.

969
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:43,933
Well,
I hope not.

970
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:47,030
I hope not because I think you have
quite a civilization and it would,

971
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,580
I'd hate to be the bringer
of its downfall. So

972
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:53,650
well, hope that tap lovely
talking to you, Jordan.

973
01:01:53,651 --> 01:01:55,030
Thank you very much for your time.

974
