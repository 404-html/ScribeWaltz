1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,860
I thought I'd do something different 
today,

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,143
so I haven't given this talk before.
I'm going to tackle the issue of free 

3
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:09,250
speech.
From a left wing perspective,

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:13,720
it's actually dead simple to provide a 
left wing rationale for free speech.

5
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,990
It should be self evident to people who 
are pursuing social justice,

6
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,380
that the most potent weapon in their 
artillery is the ability to communicate.

7
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:24,940
What do people who lack power have other
than their ability to speak on their own

8
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:25,774
behalf and isn't it on their behalf?
That the right to speak must be most 

9
00:00:28,781 --> 00:00:31,390
jealously guarded.
Anyway,

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,180
I thought I would begin with a crucial 
observation.

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:35,763
There's a fundamental structural reason 
why our political system has developed 

12
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:39,124
both a left and a right wing,
and that's the tendency for scarce 

13
00:00:41,621 --> 00:00:43,930
resources to become unequally 
distributed.

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,730
So let's discuss that.
In my clinical practice.

15
00:00:48,731 --> 00:00:49,564
I once had a client,
an older guy in his eighties he'd come 

16
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,790
to me after his wife had died because he
was lonesome,

17
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,930
but also because he was obsessed mostly 
with mathematical ideas.

18
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,340
Sasha
[inaudible],

19
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:11,460
he and
I showed it to a woman in our department

20
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:18,411
who was also very [inaudible] start by 
the moment you saw it didn't pretty have

21
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:23,070
the same effect on me because I'm not 
someone who sees,

22
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,003
I'm not mathematically gifted enough to 
seek beauty in symbol that represents 

23
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:30,320
that sort of thing.
Anyways,

24
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,573
I got to know him pretty well and was 
actually in some sense he was paying me 

25
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,703
to uh,
you just kind of a car to me because I 

26
00:01:39,201 --> 00:01:41,000
certainly heard it as much or more from 
him.

27
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,010
And he did for me is Greece.
And I also help him like,

28
00:01:45,011 --> 00:01:45,844
hey,
come to terms with this mathematical 

29
00:01:46,661 --> 00:01:47,494
obsession.
He put the stop thinking about 

30
00:01:48,221 --> 00:01:49,054
mathematical issues,
but that was more or less just the way 

31
00:01:50,681 --> 00:01:51,400
he was.
I mean,

32
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,220
he was wired that way.
Um,

33
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,130
and you know,
we felt bad about the substance,

34
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,650
but if you're an obsessive genius,
that's just life.

35
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,513
You know,
there are people like that and they're 

36
00:02:02,111 --> 00:02:05,050
not that common and it's a good bit.
There are some of them and he was one of

37
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:07,750
them.
He had been a psychology.

38
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,613
Stupid is you are.
Then he switched into economics and 

39
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,970
tried to learn how big his fortune,
but she had been quite successful up and

40
00:02:15,971 --> 00:02:20,920
he introduced me to some concepts that I
have encountered which shocked me.

41
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,373
It shocked me because the concepts to be
introduced me to [inaudible] 

42
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,293
fundamental,
a fundamental importance and I couldn't 

43
00:02:31,091 --> 00:02:31,924
believe that I had gone through so much 
education and so much further education 

44
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:41,720
and research and develop a certain 
expertise in statistics.

45
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:45,010
Although I know statistical expert 
without encountering cause.

46
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,120
This said ideas and he introduced me to 
web hasn't been come to be known as,

47
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,413
oh it's the work of bill friend.
They'll fred old pareto who was an 

48
00:02:55,581 --> 00:02:58,910
Italian economist and also the work of 
Derek,

49
00:02:58,911 --> 00:03:00,250
the solo price.

50
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,790
Who is someone who is studying 
scientific productivity?

51
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,880
That's the 1960s he wrote a book called 
big signs,

52
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:09,180
little science.
I tried to get a copy of it,

53
00:03:09,181 --> 00:03:11,750
go on Amazon,
try addition again.

54
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,480
I believe the first edition fled to the 
south of France.

55
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,010
They never were selling for about 630 
bucks,

56
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,233
which is quite staggering.
And it shows you how interested people 

57
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:21,934
are and after to get a piece of work.
And so I'll tell you about just all 

58
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,383
price first and then I'll tell you about
[inaudible] and the three of 

59
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:29,883
distribution.
So just old price was interested in 

60
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,713
scientific productivity and basically 
index scientific product candidate by 

61
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,880
looking at how many sites and get papers
to him.

62
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,770
Scientists publish it and side of the,
Sir I'll set up with precise,

63
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,670
but there they're also obsessed with 
their seismic publication record because

64
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,690
well,
they,

65
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,850
they liked status just like the next 
person.

66
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:57,010
And a status has to be measured and,
and uh,

67
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,430
and track and communicated partly 
because,

68
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,743
well,
you have to promote people and you have 

69
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:04,610
to assess them and you have to hire 
them.

70
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,230
So you'd have to rank order them.
And so if you all keep track of people's

71
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:10,630
accomplishments that you do that for 
under stupidly,

72
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,920
and then you don't hire or promote or 
replace the proper people.

73
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:15,754
So the scientific community has 
organized itself very well and keeps 

74
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:20,254
very tight to trap.
I'll different metrics of research post 

75
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:25,923
let's say.
And so one of the most would be number 

76
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:32,280
of papers published peer reviewed 
journals and that's a pretty good one.

77
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:33,114
As it turns out,
pure nominator is actually as it turns 

78
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:36,034
out,
a very excellent index of scientific 

79
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,790
quality.
Um,

80
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:40,683
partly because generally speaking,
quality and quantity in a productive 

81
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:46,030
field are quite tightly correlated and 
reasonably how it is.

82
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,103
Well,
it's kind of obvious the more you 

83
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:51,450
practice at something,
the better the tenant to get out.

84
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,610
So quantity quality tends to be typing 
into interlake,

85
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:55,743
but there are other indexes like the 
quality of the journal that you publish 

86
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:04,150
in and that's indexed by the average 
number of citations that give,

87
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:06,030
given the paper might get.
And Psyche,

88
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,670
she copies an indication of impact,
right?

89
00:05:08,671 --> 00:05:09,504
If no one was sites your word,
like 80% of published humanities papers 

90
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,910
at zero citations,
a polling people writing those papers,

91
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:27,940
there's published in journals,
a is buying them zero people read them,

92
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,580
scan,
cat scan.

93
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,390
He said it's a financial scampi does for
a very,

94
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:37,950
very expensive and that was just 
published them because they're expensive

95
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,560
and libraries and path to buy divided.
And so the library is by them,

96
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,323
even though they wouldn't release,
doesn't know insights that they staff 

97
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,083
the is the feminine,
they increase the ratio of noise to 

98
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,150
signal and we subsidize that.
It's no longer to television.

99
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,630
It's one of the reasons because the bees
are dying,

100
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,590
probably not fast enough.

101
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:01,790
[inaudible]

102
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:08,210
free to fire up,
let's say more classical approach,

103
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,400
the heart of the university and they no 
mistake about if you get universities,

104
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,503
you've got the tech stuff and somebody 
could stuff that can be parceled out 

105
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,700
either other agencies and existence to 
take care of that humanity humanities at

106
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,543
the heart of the university we lose the 
university university and now it's a 

107
00:06:25,591 --> 00:06:26,424
terrible thing,
but it's not as terrible as having them 

108
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,823
continue on the path that they're 
authorized down language back to 

109
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,673
productivity.
So this Sol price was curious about who 

110
00:06:38,251 --> 00:06:43,251
is productive and what the differences 
in productivity were.

111
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,423
And he had he,
he hoped data being average number of 

112
00:06:47,761 --> 00:06:48,594
publications that a phd student had.
And this was in the early sixties upon 

113
00:06:52,051 --> 00:06:54,420
graduation,
how the rates have gone up since then,

114
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,390
but I've already graduation,
we're pretty sure that the,

115
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,250
you mentioned some tape to say in terms 
of what we're discussing,

116
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,380
grace of God so that the median number 
of publications,

117
00:07:04,381 --> 00:07:07,110
which is the typical number don't be 
hours number,

118
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:07,350
right?

119
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,080
The typical number that people would 
produce was one,

120
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,520
one publication and then you might say,
well okay fine,

121
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,613
the medium person published one,
how many people publish to and hash it 

122
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:26,991
out was half as many as publish one.
And then the other question was,

123
00:07:27,271 --> 00:07:29,350
well how many people publish straight?
He has those houses.

124
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:33,970
Then he has published two and four was 
half as many as three.

125
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,833
Five is half as many as four.
And so what you see isn't it scattered 

126
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:42,270
the rapid drop off of productivity,
but as you,

127
00:07:42,271 --> 00:07:46,880
as you move upward in number of 
publications and there's a,

128
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,630
there's a side effect to that.
So,

129
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,880
so imagine breath.
What happens is if you're,

130
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,660
if you're graphing come rip people out 
of a particular number of publications,

131
00:07:54,661 --> 00:07:55,494
you have the vast majority of people 
that have one pop as many to half as 

132
00:07:59,611 --> 00:08:01,470
many of these that as three,
four,

133
00:08:01,471 --> 00:08:03,730
five and then you'd get out of,
so here in the how,

134
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,140
maybe like 10 or maybe 20 and those 
people are,

135
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,183
well,
they're super geniuses in her field 

136
00:08:09,331 --> 00:08:11,460
right there.
They're unbelievably smart girl,

137
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,580
unbelievably fast.
There are unbelievably productive

138
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,563
and it was hard to them.
And so price being an observation about 

139
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,440
the scientific productivity and it's a 
terrible,

140
00:08:25,441 --> 00:08:29,860
terrible observation.
It's a hate fact.

141
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:33,863
He observed that if you took a domain of
scientific productivity and you were 

142
00:08:38,161 --> 00:08:40,380
trying to figure out who did it for 
doctor work,

143
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,303
he answered grossed out.
It was the square root of the number of 

144
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,473
disparities,
the number of people who are operating 

145
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:49,590
in that particular specialization 
produced half of the publications.

146
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,950
Now it's worthwhile thinking this 
through.

147
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:55,050
So let's say you're a candidate,
people in a particular,

148
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,890
this also employs applies to the 
employee productivity.

149
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,930
Incorporations pilate saying general 
rehearsal.

150
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,740
So if you got 10 employees,
three of them do have to work.

151
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,933
Well that's not surprising.
You have people who don't do any 

152
00:09:07,941 --> 00:09:08,774
anymore.
You have some people who don't solve in 

153
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,420
the work that they actually cost you 
money.

154
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,820
It's that,
that's the estimate.

155
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:16,890
There's four,
if I remember correctly,

156
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:21,950
65% of managers at that negative 
mentality you to become,

157
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,020
well,
it's hard growing company,

158
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:27,390
it's easy to save one and they,
and they fail all the time.

159
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,430
Okay,
so you have 10 free.

160
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:31,810
You have to work on that because it 
seems so bad.

161
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,440
Well,
if you have 25 five you have to work.

162
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:35,603
That's getting rough.
Do you have a hundred is 10 if you have 

163
00:09:37,781 --> 00:09:38,614
a thousand

164
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:43,630
well it's hard to any,
it's third.

165
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,060
So what does that mean?
It means that

166
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,490
productivity is distributed in a manner 
that was described by bill,

167
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,260
frito retail.
And that's the free or distribution.

168
00:09:58,890 --> 00:09:59,723
And when you looked at the distribution 
of income and the distribution of 

169
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:04,960
wealth,
it's prudent Mr View,

170
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,383
which means that almost everyone has not
and a few people have a little bit and 

171
00:10:11,571 --> 00:10:13,740
then even fewer people have a little bit
more than that.

172
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:16,410
And there's some people,
they'll ace for example,

173
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:18,160
Carlos Slim,
um,

174
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,300
Jeff Bezos who have more money than God
anyway,

175
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:24,713
say,
well that's a consequence of improper 

176
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:31,920
social structure.
And the right response to that is no,

177
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:32,754
it's not.
It's actually something more akin to 

178
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,970
international law.
It governs the same distribution,

179
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,930
garners the size of cities.
That's an interest to take.

180
00:10:41,931 --> 00:10:45,270
It also governs decisive planetary 
bodies.

181
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,280
That's harder to blame on the 
patriarchy.

182
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,533
But
he also seems to govern the 

183
00:10:55,231 --> 00:10:56,064
distribution,
every single thing that you would be 

184
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,930
produced creatively.

185
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,480
So for example,
and I mean everything,

186
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:05,470
it's really quite staggering.
So if,

187
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,520
if it applies to a number of hockey 
goals score for example,

188
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:11,820
um,
set,

189
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:12,663
set something like Wayne Gretzky,
I read if you took away all his is 

190
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:16,824
actually gold,
you'd still have more points than any 

191
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,860
occupated never late and so ill and get 
a shot.

192
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,560
That's really interesting it because 
they didn't tell us 1%.

193
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,281
No,
it's spot.

194
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:27,114
It's like one 10th of one 10th of 1% of 
all the people who play hockey get into 

195
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,310
the NHL like no one.
Right.

196
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,213
Give it up.
It's not,

197
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:38,460
it does happened.
And you're like the allergenic Gel guy.

198
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,970
Like you're a superstar and then there's
some son of a bitch like the redskins.

199
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,220
We'll just stay home piece in all of 
these,

200
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,230
in all of these,
still making some pre production.

201
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:57,410
I can tell you people were kind of 
brands like either it old fashion.

202
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:02,200
So you can talk about Pablo Castle.
He's an interesting character.

203
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,960
Yeah,
they're long productive lives.

204
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:05,794
Right.
Hit it.

205
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,850
If I remember correctly,
it's nineties.

206
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:12,730
Why may I know how many,
how many more hard macassar produced and

207
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:13,391
you know,
you might get,

208
00:12:13,391 --> 00:12:15,820
these are just sketches that he was like
just thrown off,

209
00:12:15,821 --> 00:12:20,821
but don't make that go onto the online,
the castle archive.

210
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,880
We're 50,000 of them have to be 
documented and I can give you the way,

211
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:28,330
my punchline.
But so,

212
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,203
so,
so I thought about it and then I did 

213
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,440
some research to find out how many 
artworks,

214
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,430
this crazy character,
but bruce,

215
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:41,431
and the answer was 65,003 day,
every single day for 65 years.

216
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,460
So I try
to do right.

217
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,270
I mean he wasn't just obsessively 
producing artworks,

218
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,113
although he was there like a huge 
proportion of those things were 

219
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:55,060
masterpieces,
right?

220
00:12:55,061 --> 00:12:57,310
So this was no pike of this guy.
He was,

221
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:01,010
he was something else.
And then Bach is a good example.

222
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,320
Care as far as,
well,

223
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:03,643
um,
he wrote so much music then it wouldn't 

224
00:13:06,821 --> 00:13:07,654
take a capias 45 years of eight hour 
days just to copy what he had to 

225
00:13:15,731 --> 00:13:18,610
propose.
So these people are,

226
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:21,790
they're off the scale with regards to do
what they do.

227
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,410
You know,
when you see the same thing,

228
00:13:23,411 --> 00:13:26,760
if you're looking at pat with numbers 
and that sort of thing and so,

229
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,620
so depressed.
She is,

230
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,973
this is,
this is a really interesting all of 

231
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,970
that.
The question is two questions.

232
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:38,290
Why in the world is the world set up 
like that?

233
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,230
That's the first question.
And the second question is

234
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,563
what would make,
since it makes everything radically 

235
00:13:45,761 --> 00:13:48,610
unfair in a sense,
at least with regards to distribution,

236
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:49,683
maybe,
maybe it's,

237
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:50,603
it's good because those people are 
producing things like that and the rest 

238
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,510
of us,
at least in principle get oily.

239
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:57,490
But nonetheless,
there was a big problem with in terms of

240
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,630
inequality,
of,

241
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:01,360
of distribution ability and all of these
things.

242
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,400
Why,
why is that the case?

243
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,430
Well,
here's one reason.

244
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,570
So in this is something I've worked on,
at least in part with my,

245
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,520
with my client.
Um,

246
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,490
who else would have a theory on societal
revolutions,

247
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,440
which I think was pregnant,
intelligent theory.

248
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,630
Um,
he introduced me to a,

249
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,800
a field of inquiry that I had never 
heard about.

250
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:24,683
People were holding,
he caught on physics and I didn't know 

251
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:29,500
there were quantum physicists,
but there are,

252
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,110
and sometimes they're very productive 
and the other ones are

253
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,053
the economy businesses figured out that 
you could model the distribution of 

254
00:14:38,771 --> 00:14:39,604
money in a population,
usually the same equations that you 

255
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:46,120
could log in with the distribution of a 
gas into a vacuum.

256
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,633
So,
so there's a deep interpret like 

257
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,480
phenomena driving the distribution of 
money.

258
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,313
And so,
and here's how it works while you guys 

259
00:14:59,091 --> 00:15:00,740
are hopefully to the mall,
right?

260
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,640
And so,
but often just basically a random walk.

261
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,830
I mean,
you know how to play it off when you buy

262
00:15:06,831 --> 00:15:10,380
it an you can as fast as you can.
And the first it was the luckiest,

263
00:15:10,381 --> 00:15:11,214
the way it is.
That's basically the health and all the 

264
00:15:12,441 --> 00:15:13,490
work.
You know,

265
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,440
there's a lot of company,
are you going to say a skill?

266
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:20,340
There's sort of a modicum of stupidity,
stupid play you lose.

267
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,230
But barring that,
it's random walk and you know that,

268
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:25,064
cause we played 10 monopoly games,
it's very unlikely that you're going to 

269
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:28,844
win more than your random sharer.
So let's think about what happens in an 

270
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,193
office.
The first thing that happens is you 

271
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:40,601
start from a position of equity.
Everybody has exactly the same amount of

272
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:43,640
money and then you engage in brandon 
training,

273
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,740
essentially chicken,
the guys,

274
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,550
right?

275
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,900
And so what happens?
Well,

276
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:50,360
what happens is,
so here's the graph.

277
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,600
One Bar,
here's number of people,

278
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,380
or people are playing,
they all have exactly the same amount of

279
00:15:57,381 --> 00:15:58,214
money,
think it's like $2,000 to begin with or 

280
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:00,284
something like that.
Then you started shaking your ducks and 

281
00:16:02,301 --> 00:16:03,134
then go starts to happen is a few people
start to granted it more and a few 

282
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:07,643
people start to lose a bit more.
And what happens to the waiters is that 

283
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,510
they become more resilient,
right?

284
00:16:13,511 --> 00:16:17,330
They can take more losses than the 
people who are starting to lose.

285
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,230
And so what happens is the distribution 
flattens out.

286
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,870
Couple of people get more of the word 
money.

287
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:28,380
One person pulls up if the lead,
some people get less money and the loser

288
00:16:28,381 --> 00:16:31,730
starts to develop and you keep shaking 
the dice as soon.

289
00:16:31,731 --> 00:16:34,190
What happens is they hang,
someone gives zero.

290
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,680
Now zero is a terrible number and you 
can see this in all sorts of ways.

291
00:16:39,681 --> 00:16:41,750
For example,
if you're trying to start a business,

292
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:42,973
zero customers is really the wrong 
number of customers who have as way 

293
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:49,910
harder to get your first customer,
but to eat your second year customer,

294
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,520
you know it's way easier to get your 
hundred and second customer,

295
00:16:52,521 --> 00:16:55,730
then your third customer,
massive easier part of the guys.

296
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:56,564
Who the hell wants to buy something from
you if you haven't sold something to 

297
00:16:58,431 --> 00:17:01,400
someone else.
You know people use social proof and you

298
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:04,630
aren't saying,
well I'm new and revolutionary and they,

299
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,270
well that's all well and good for you,
but just so damn wait,

300
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,670
I'm going to take the risk of being 
wrong vibe and the product.

301
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,970
If I'd rather people buy it,
then I can say,

302
00:17:13,971 --> 00:17:15,350
well these other hundred people bought 
it.

303
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:18,320
So I thought it was okay,
which is a reasonable justification.

304
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,930
But otherwise they have to say,
well,

305
00:17:20,931 --> 00:17:22,750
you know,
I wouldn't have gotten the lamp and just

306
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:24,110
a few exciting.
It's like,

307
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:24,944
yeah,
you're fire.

308
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,800
So,
so carbon is very,

309
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:28,634
very difficult to get away from zero now
and normally it's impossible because as 

310
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:32,984
soon as you hit zero and we run into a 
problem that you don't have when you 

311
00:17:36,111 --> 00:17:41,111
even have a $20 and the problem is you 
cannot invest zero to making more money.

312
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,600
You're done.
You Stack up at zero,

313
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,463
you're done.
And so zeros were off number while we 

314
00:17:48,351 --> 00:17:52,560
keep playing,
someone walks away with all the money.

315
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,133
Yeah,
you've been complaining about the rules 

316
00:17:55,201 --> 00:17:56,034
of the game,
but you know the funny thing is people 

317
00:17:57,611 --> 00:18:01,140
will play even if they know they know 
what the outcome's going to be.

318
00:18:01,141 --> 00:18:03,700
One plutocrat walk away.

319
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,440
We called houses,
parks here and we'll track,

320
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:14,990
but then we were watching all this is to
recast the game and play once more.

321
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:19,600
The tables will often turn that my 
client's hypothesis,

322
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,750
which I thought was very good one.
What's that?

323
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,580
That's what happens in society because 
that's why they moved towards repletion.

324
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,840
That's kind of our society in some 
sense,

325
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:31,670
which is that you play on the hate 
logging off.

326
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,630
You could assume these are random and 
trading game.

327
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,360
It's not exactly around the trading 
game,

328
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,203
but you,
you've been Martin on quite nicely at 

329
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,510
around three day.
What happens is eventually,

330
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,373
you know,
some people have oic everything and 

331
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:46,580
almost every one stacks up and zero.
And the problem with zero is that you've

332
00:18:46,681 --> 00:18:51,480
got nothing to lose if I don't flip the 
damn board over and start a new game.

333
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,510
And that's especially true if your male 
as their evening.

334
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,343
It's true if your males,
because may all need status and the 

335
00:18:58,741 --> 00:19:01,800
reason they need status is because 
females don't like men with no status.

336
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:07,370
So that's a fundamental rule.
So the correlation between

337
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:11,903
male socioeconomic status and access to 
me or is this roughly about 26 which is 

338
00:19:16,261 --> 00:19:17,094
a standard guy,
the high correlation for the social 

339
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:20,790
sciences,
massive correlation.

340
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:21,624
You hardly see the only correlation I've
ever seen higher than that as the 

341
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:27,780
relationship between inequality and male
on male homicide,

342
00:19:27,781 --> 00:19:30,460
which is about 0.8 which is,
it comes from all of them.

343
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,740
So as any quality cram side,
men start to kill each other and they're

344
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:38,490
young men and the Carolina men and they 
do it status disputes.

345
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,270
And then you have within race and it's,
it's,

346
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,630
it's you say read to me,
I see something,

347
00:19:45,631 --> 00:19:47,660
bring it back.
We're trying to save face for,

348
00:19:47,661 --> 00:19:48,494
tried to print up a,
the status soon if we're not careful 

349
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,520
because we're impulsive because our 
future is that right?

350
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,520
We have a short time horizon all we'd 
gone to certain reputation.

351
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:01,190
It's like it's your big buddy and so you
ended up dead or maybe I ended up da,

352
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,030
it's a toss up.
And so what happens?

353
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,793
You get sharp for second degree murder.
There's not enough prosecutors to go 

354
00:20:08,161 --> 00:20:08,994
after you.
So company argued down to mass 

355
00:20:10,801 --> 00:20:13,140
slaughter.
You can argue self defense.

356
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,970
You're pointing to prison for three 
years.

357
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,080
He served 18 months and when you come 
out,

358
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:20,000
no blood in one messes with you.
Right?

359
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,680
Right.
That's a harsh economics.

360
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:23,920
The calculation.
I,

361
00:20:23,921 --> 00:20:26,070
it's an effective one.
And so,

362
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,910
but one of the consequences of quality.

363
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:33,930
So we did research using this,
this,

364
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,150
this recalled the creative achievement 
questionnaire.

365
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,870
And I developed with a student that by 
name Shelly Carson,

366
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:44,370
when our is teaching in Boston and he 
should be done point of popular nature.

367
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,950
Um,
when you're thinking about creativity,

368
00:20:47,951 --> 00:20:48,784
there's two ways to think about it.
You can think about creativity as a 

369
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:51,754
process.
You don't have to be how creatively can 

370
00:20:54,381 --> 00:20:57,960
you pay and that would be associated to 
some degree with your Inq,

371
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:58,803
especially if their verbal Iq and also 
with this trade is big five personality 

372
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:06,130
traits don't as openness,
which is a fundamental,

373
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,550
fundamental,
deep,

374
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,473
vital,
ultimately recruited personnel on the 

375
00:21:10,831 --> 00:21:11,664
tree.
And basically people who are creative 

376
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:14,763
are good at generating exemplars.
Either other category or between 

377
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:22,990
Catholics in can you can,
I can test your creativity right back.

378
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,700
It's,
it's actually quite straight forward.

379
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:25,534
So for example,
if I go out to you guys to pull out a 

380
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:27,754
piece of paper and write down his name,
where it says you could have that began 

381
00:21:30,221 --> 00:21:31,054
with the letter s in three minutes,
does the number of words you generated 

382
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:39,190
would be correlated with your creative 
capacity in about 23.4 and you think,

383
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:40,024
well that's not very high,
but actually that's higher than is 

384
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:44,530
generated in both the 95% social science
studies.

385
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,920
So it's flaky.
Well,

386
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,003
small effects are just help a lot more 
effective than you think for a variety 

387
00:21:50,501 --> 00:21:52,690
of reasons.
Partly because of the extreme is now.

388
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,153
Um,
and I can do a bandage off if I sat 

389
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,710
down,
write down as many uses as you can for a

390
00:21:59,711 --> 00:22:00,544
brick three minutes.
And then I sorted globally in terms of 

391
00:22:03,611 --> 00:22:04,444
how many uses you came up with,
but how comparatively rare you're 

392
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:12,610
useless work compared to the rest of the
population that was being scored.

393
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:13,020
Now,
you know,

394
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:18,020
it would have to be sensible to happen 
yet plausible use for a brick rarity and

395
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:23,010
fluency seem to make a lot of what 
constitutes degree pivoted.

396
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,450
So that be measured for you?
Well but

397
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,390
and that's kind of normally distributed 
like,

398
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,010
like intelligence.
We are interested in some something else

399
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,320
you've got straight ticket can be 
defined in different ways.

400
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,650
So we are interested in creative 
achievement accomplishment,

401
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,870
right?
So not only could you think creatively,

402
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:44,560
but you've actually produced something 
in the world as a consequence.

403
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,950
And you can debate about which is the 
better definition of creativity.

404
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,903
It doesn't matter.
You can have both definitions and 

405
00:22:50,921 --> 00:22:51,754
they're useful for different purposes 
and we chose the greater achievement 

406
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,370
definition because that was good.
We're curious about,

407
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,740
and so what we did was we thought we 
thought as many dimensions as we thought

408
00:23:01,901 --> 00:23:05,770
were reasonable in creative and so that 
was like

409
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:11,380
dance music,
theater inventions,

410
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,820
cooking,
you know,

411
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,380
no architectural innovation,
um,

412
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,910
fiction writing,
nonfiction writing,

413
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,580
I don't remember all 13 but you get a 
picture and then we had,

414
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:28,803
we,
we develop an eight point scale of 

415
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,623
levels of achievement and we have them 
generally by experts and then we rank 

416
00:23:35,261 --> 00:23:37,240
order them in terms of their being 
probability.

417
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,073
So category zero bus,
I have don't training or talent in this 

418
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:44,020
area.
And kind of [inaudible] was like,

419
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:49,080
well I have an reputation and so and so 
did we have people fill out the Erin and

420
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,073
we go down to the distribution and what 
we bought was pre don't yesterday you 

421
00:23:53,751 --> 00:23:55,350
should have,
that was before I do a premium.

422
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,273
Distributions were,
but he must've followed out and making 

423
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:01,124
the scale in some stance because 
everyone who's a social scientist 

424
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,800
basically everything is normally 
distributed.

425
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,110
It's just wrong.
Many things.

426
00:24:09,111 --> 00:24:09,944
Our peritoneal distributed as a bring 
out everything when people produce 

427
00:24:13,431 --> 00:24:17,120
creatively is distributed.
And that gets really,

428
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:18,320
really,
really,

429
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:22,640
really important because you see,
one of the things that shows you is that

430
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,623
whatever's going on in the income 
distribution doesn't just characterize 

431
00:24:26,691 --> 00:24:27,524
income distribution.
So you can't just blame it stupidly on 

432
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:35,060
unfair social circumstance.
It's also the case that every society,

433
00:24:35,061 --> 00:24:38,480
every study I was studying has a 
peritoneal distribution of income.

434
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,990
Now how steep it is.
Dot varies to some degree.

435
00:24:41,991 --> 00:24:44,420
As a consequence of things like social 
policy,

436
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,463
that's very,
very difficult to get away from the 

437
00:24:46,731 --> 00:24:48,430
[inaudible] distribution.
With that,

438
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,560
we don't know how to get away from it.
That's,

439
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,830
that's the real truth about you don't 
know how to get away from it anyways,

440
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,673
but that creative gene press here,
what we found was that I think it was 

441
00:24:57,801 --> 00:24:58,634
60% of people had a score of zero zero.
If they haven't done anything creative 

442
00:25:06,651 --> 00:25:08,680
in any of the 13 dimension,
look,

443
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:11,000
it's not that surprised that.
How many of you have written the book?

444
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,970
Well not.
And if you have written that,

445
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:14,804
you certainly hit publish it.
And if you didn't publish it and no 

446
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:21,650
boss,
no one really wants,

447
00:25:21,651 --> 00:25:22,484
it's pretty hard.
And then you write the minutes and 

448
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,673
rejection ready first tried to get 
publications like 99% I mean there's 

449
00:25:27,981 --> 00:25:30,650
like a million folks accomplished a year
as I think,

450
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,543
I can't remember.
It's like 2,500 the 10,000 copies or 

451
00:25:34,401 --> 00:25:36,440
something horrible like that,
you know it.

452
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,730
Steve became,
gets all the money

453
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:42,330
and this brings us to the reasons for 
such thing.

454
00:25:42,331 --> 00:25:45,170
So I have a friend who's his office and 
he's,

455
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,930
he's not seeing his pain,
but he does three,

456
00:25:47,931 --> 00:25:48,764
well,
he's written his the gear for Oh 20 

457
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,280
years.
[inaudible]

458
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:58,300
has done a business,
but he's Brendan the edge of the radical

459
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,220
distribution.
He hasn't really hit the big time year,

460
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:06,050
but he's pushing most level is just 
there.

461
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,020
They just start.
They just started like artists to start.

462
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,740
So we talked about this.
It's like we'll work it out.

463
00:26:12,741 --> 00:26:16,250
What's going on here?
Why does all the money flow to like five

464
00:26:16,251 --> 00:26:17,690
people?
And he said,

465
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:20,390
well think about this.
Think about geographically,

466
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,613
although in a strange manner,
think about real estate territory in 

467
00:26:25,491 --> 00:26:26,324
relationship to books.
And then think about going from the 

468
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:29,294
airport and then think about going to 
the airport bookstore and then think 

469
00:26:32,301 --> 00:26:35,420
about the best seller stand.
One,

470
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:35,961
two,
three,

471
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:36,794
four,
five,

472
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,860
down to 50,
the top five.

473
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,970
Everyone bought us them.
And then think,

474
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,760
well,
there isn't just one of those towns

475
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:51,690
and that's like 70% of the selling real 
estate and territory.

476
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,550
And it's overwhelming dominated by 
person up in the left hand corner.

477
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,530
Is it very often,
Steven King,

478
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:02,760
whose name everyone knows who's worth 
everyone can predict,

479
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,800
makes the choice easy.
You know,

480
00:27:04,801 --> 00:27:06,120
you're preoccupied,
man,

481
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,043
you're on a flight somewhere.
You don't want to say 10 minutes 

482
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:13,190
figuring out what you're going to read 
it like the plague

483
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,700
basis,
tens of billions of doors.

484
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:21,630
And that's how it goes for everything.
So here's another example.

485
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,050
So click about composers.
Um,

486
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,670
it turns out though

487
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,530
five composers,
Bach,

488
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,850
Beethoven,
and Mozart,

489
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,013
and Haydn
proposed the worst and they talked with 

490
00:27:39,141 --> 00:27:44,141
95% of the perform classical repertoire 
composers DMP,

491
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:50,770
right?
And it's hard to composers [inaudible]

492
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:56,240
if you don't have to worry about 
classical music you've been listening to

493
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,640
and any look at those,
those people's

494
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,343
useful conversations.
And what'd you find out is that 5% of 

495
00:28:05,821 --> 00:28:09,330
what they propose,
it's 95% of the playtime.

496
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,343
So it's like hardly any composers at all
composed all the music that everyone 

497
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:18,330
listens to and God was hardly any of the
music that they can post.

498
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,860
And that's,
that's why.

499
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,023
And so when the economists,
this sort of thing called the matthew 

500
00:28:26,911 --> 00:28:30,180
principle,
which is an interesting nomenclature,

501
00:28:30,181 --> 00:28:32,670
it's from US stealing by Christ in the 
New Testament.

502
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:38,090
Don't think he has many economically
one of them.

503
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,580
It's a vicious,
vicious said,

504
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,680
some very vicious things in the New 
Testament,

505
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,533
you know,
which is one of the things that need to 

506
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,670
lend some credence in my estimation is 
did you pick this?

507
00:28:49,671 --> 00:28:50,660
Those things,
would it be

508
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,520
to those who have everything more will 
be given from almost nothing.

509
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,490
Everything will be taken away.
It's like that's the matching principle.

510
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,533
That's the freedom principle.
Success breeds success and that's how 

511
00:29:07,741 --> 00:29:11,040
the world works.
What's the problem with that?

512
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,853
Zero you don't want to tell you too much
of a problem because it isn't like 

513
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:26,280
actually zero but it's close to zero.
You know there was an article and yet

514
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:32,300
some report or just started to go and he
didn't do it.

515
00:29:32,301 --> 00:29:33,880
It's overwhelming.
It's called like survey.

516
00:29:33,881 --> 00:29:37,780
But you surveyed a bunch of people to 
see what proportion of people could come

517
00:29:37,781 --> 00:29:38,614
up with $500 in an emergency.
And the answer was in shockingly low 

518
00:29:43,391 --> 00:29:48,060
number of people or overextended and you
don't have any excess bunny at CAC.

519
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,310
So I'm going to leave when people who 
were,

520
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:56,680
they weren't as zero,
which is a very rough place to be law.

521
00:29:56,681 --> 00:30:01,681
You don't want people to stack up at 
zero because what happens is that I,

522
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,500
one of the things that happens is that 
the male violence,

523
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,663
let us start to call it.
So you think young man and he status 

524
00:30:11,801 --> 00:30:13,240
that they also need opportunity.

525
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,860
They also need something to aim for it,
right?

526
00:30:14,861 --> 00:30:15,694
They need all of that.
And if they're in a place where the 

527
00:30:17,111 --> 00:30:19,900
inequality,
whenever any three steam,

528
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,990
it gets hard for them to move out of the
zero position.

529
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:23,973
And the district to do it.
Something to do it by any needs 

530
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,853
whatsoever.
And so what seems to happen is that as 

531
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:29,764
society becomes more and more on equal,
the pressure on young women and girls 

532
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:37,000
and you can pageant well what sort of 
young men and becomes viable the first,

533
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,100
and this is where you can have it up in 
the other,

534
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,920
what would you call them?
Variables that predict violence.

535
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:46,210
Maybe impulsive guy,
maybe the guy who drinks too much,

536
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,143
take it.
The guy who was fond of swarm him 

537
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,113
against the wall three or four times 
when he was drunk when he was three and 

538
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,530
damaged his brain.

539
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:54,663
You know,
anybody who's impulsive and liable to 

540
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:58,180
his self,
the future,

541
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:01,780
it's hard to be even more hyper 
motivated by in hopes of violence.

542
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,793
As adults,
we can call the client and they are 

543
00:31:04,661 --> 00:31:07,470
applying here and I'll be speaking out.
We've got,

544
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:08,523
like if you go back 80 95 you know,
in age 95 the average person in the 

545
00:31:12,341 --> 00:31:13,174
western world lived on $1 a day and you 
want to take while the calder fucking 

546
00:31:17,501 --> 00:31:18,790
warrant more back then it's like,
no,

547
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:19,360
no,
no,

548
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,800
today's dollars.
But back then everyone had nothing thing

549
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:24,723
and have a few people have some,
I mean you can arrange that then didn't 

550
00:31:27,611 --> 00:31:32,611
live like any of you live now you've got
running water.

551
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:36,990
If you've got central eating,
you've got rely on shelter,

552
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:40,790
you've got an infinite amount of 
information at your fingertips had every

553
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:44,800
moment it's like you're filthy rich,
you are filthy rich.

554
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,533
Money has bought everything that you can
have except sas because that's 

555
00:31:49,691 --> 00:31:51,400
comparitor.
So,

556
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,293
but the good thing to know because
otherwise he might think of yourself as 

557
00:31:56,231 --> 00:31:59,290
poor and if you're not,
you might be relatively core

558
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,223
but usually means you have to wait three
years to get the thing that the rich 

559
00:32:04,241 --> 00:32:05,074
guys have now.
But it's just not that big of a 

560
00:32:06,861 --> 00:32:10,210
catastrophe.
So anyways.

561
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,133
Okay.
So you is followed with societies with 

562
00:32:14,711 --> 00:32:15,544
regards to creative products tend to 
tilt so that people stack up at the low 

563
00:32:20,061 --> 00:32:23,530
end.
And if you people start up idea and then

564
00:32:23,531 --> 00:32:26,590
things start to be stabilized,
that's the big problem.

565
00:32:26,591 --> 00:32:29,810
So like I tried this,
I bought this,

566
00:32:29,811 --> 00:32:30,644
this was swell.
Societies run out there haven't been 

567
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,453
trading game until it,
most people have zero and a few people 

568
00:32:35,351 --> 00:32:37,770
have everything.
And then the revolution comes in.

569
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,860
The board selected.

570
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,320
Everybody wants to start it.
Yeah.

571
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,730
So I'm assuming that if there's anything
left in the wrong,

572
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,880
right.
And so there's a Marxist flavor to that.

573
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:51,950
And of course mark's pointed out that 
capital candidate to accumulate,

574
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,800
enhance with fewer and fewer people.
The thing he got wrong,

575
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,510
and this is an important thing to 
understand,

576
00:32:56,511 --> 00:32:59,440
is that although there is the 1% and 
even born,

577
00:32:59,441 --> 00:33:00,274
it was the one 10th of 1% who have 
almost all the resources that the 1% 

578
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,520
have,
right?

579
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,070
They that exists,
that it's always there,

580
00:33:07,071 --> 00:33:09,080
but it's not the same people.
That's,

581
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,180
that's one of the things mark's got 
seriously draw.

582
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,043
It's not the same people.
Most family fortunes only not for three 

583
00:33:14,061 --> 00:33:15,410
generations.
Right?

584
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:18,320
Because I don't know,
you guys should have money sometimes.

585
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,280
Did you keep it?

586
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:24,860
No problem.
And I the other people is it?

587
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:30,100
Yes.
[inaudible] all the way.

588
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,653
We're willing to Dole it out with just 
that quickly because you have a lot of 

589
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,470
money.
You just spent large homes,

590
00:33:36,471 --> 00:33:37,304
money equally stupidly.
And let's for somebody who really knows 

591
00:33:39,531 --> 00:33:40,364
how to deal with money,
those people are really quite rare and 

592
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:43,454
so family fortunes dispersed and very 
rapidly and the typical fortune 500 

593
00:33:46,821 --> 00:33:48,770
company,
you only got us about 30 years.

594
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:53,680
So although the distribution is the way 
that I describe it,

595
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:57,350
the constituent elements of the 
distribution turnover quite rapidly.

596
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:00,420
So I think if you're,
what is it?

597
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:05,110
I think you'll have a 10% chance of 
always that healthy stuff.

598
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:10,190
I think you have a 10% chance of being 
top 1% for a piece,

599
00:34:10,191 --> 00:34:11,024
one year of your life on average and a 
40% chance of being in a top 10% for at 

600
00:34:15,651 --> 00:34:17,330
least one year on average.

601
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,970
So we know when people move up and down 
throughout the life of,

602
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:20,903
another thing to keep in mind,
which is very important and no one ever 

603
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:24,044
talks about this,
is that most of the reason that people 

604
00:34:26,991 --> 00:34:27,824
have money and said they're all right 
because young people don't have any 

605
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:30,944
money,
but they're young or old people and 

606
00:34:32,631 --> 00:34:33,464
we're waiting on in particular cause all
the alternate don't have over and have 

607
00:34:35,691 --> 00:34:39,200
most of the money right now because the 
old man dies conveniently.

608
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,090
And
now you know the problem that people,

609
00:34:43,091 --> 00:34:43,924
all my that role.
And so just the typical overs as me to 

610
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,310
take credit me on the court and he got 
to be,

611
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:51,860
well,
yes you could think about that yourself.

612
00:34:51,861 --> 00:34:52,910
If you're young,
it's like,

613
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,900
okay,
you're now $20 million from afternoon 85

614
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,330
it's like,
what are you gonna take?

615
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:00,861
So,
you know,

616
00:35:00,861 --> 00:35:03,140
to some degree it depends on how you 
calculate.

617
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,610
Well,
right.

618
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:05,870
So,
okay,

619
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,940
so what's the point of all of that?

620
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:15,770
It all keeps us and it's actually a 
fundamental problem.

621
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:19,070
And even if you're a conservative 
person,

622
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,660
you might say,
well,

623
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:21,494
it's a fundamental problem because at 
the inequality gets out of Canada to 

624
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:26,720
Valerie and society starts cause you 
stabilize.

625
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,350
And you know,
the one that conservatives,

626
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,193
Republicans say they're a cop on crime.
Progressive Conservatives for that 

627
00:35:33,171 --> 00:35:34,420
matter,
how dry.

628
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,500
It's like,
well what drives the risk by your crime?

629
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,110
They all are final homocide.
Let's say we know what it is.

630
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,120
It's inequality.
The correlation is,

631
00:35:42,121 --> 00:35:43,160
like I said before,
gate,

632
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,930
it's all of it.
It's all of it.

633
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,070
That's what drives the status 
competition.

634
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,400
And just interviewed Dr. Martin Daly 
who's,

635
00:35:50,401 --> 00:35:52,440
uh,
who's evolutionary psychologist,

636
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:56,310
staff mcmaster that being from this 
place and

637
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:58,870
he,
you know,

638
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:01,140
he didn't know the Brown works with this
sort of research.

639
00:36:01,141 --> 00:36:04,670
So I've been re released that in one 
week and he wrote a book recently called

640
00:36:04,671 --> 00:36:06,900
the killing to competition is very high 
school.

641
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,880
He talks about being on the 11th it 
says,

642
00:36:08,881 --> 00:36:13,140
a rational strategy for uncertain 
environment where there's a lot of chaos

643
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:15,630
and a lot of equality.
It's worth reading.

644
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,840
You know,
he's very strongly biological,

645
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,390
biologically oriented,
the evolutionary psychologists,

646
00:36:21,391 --> 00:36:22,051
very,
very highly.

647
00:36:22,051 --> 00:36:23,340
Incredibly.
My estimation,

648
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:24,623
but last two chapters deal with social 
contributors to inequality and I don't 

649
00:36:30,811 --> 00:36:31,644
think that that is separately.
They're very powerful part of this book 

650
00:36:33,241 --> 00:36:35,640
because I don't think it deals with the 
fundamental issue.

651
00:36:35,641 --> 00:36:37,230
I'm trying to tell him,
cause I'm the medical issue.

652
00:36:37,231 --> 00:36:40,440
If there's something going on here,
it's like a natural law.

653
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,080
There's producers,
there's wide disparity,

654
00:36:42,081 --> 00:36:42,914
has an outcome.

655
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,930
Now the question is,
well,

656
00:36:45,931 --> 00:36:48,660
what should we do about it and answer,
isn't it nothing?

657
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,550
Because if you let her drive him to his 
conclusion,

658
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,670
then all hell breaks loose and yeah,
even if you're rich,

659
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:54,520
you think,
okay,

660
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,160
you're and you're down in Central 
America,

661
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,950
even in Columbia.
Do you want to be rich in Columbia?

662
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,450
Well Great.
You have to.

663
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:04,740
You don't get to go outside instead of 
inside the confines of your compound.

664
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,160
You're in a Ga.
Nice.

665
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,680
You know you're going to people in their
computers for family,

666
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:13,500
but fundamentally this jail,
he's got a huge house.

667
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,690
Hooray.
More clean as far as like

668
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,733
a fence around the barb wire.
You've got guards everywhere and can 

669
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:24,040
help your kids having to go out.
They get kidnapped.

670
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,530
She was like,
are you rich?

671
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,210
Well,
I don't think so.

672
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,530
I haven't been Montreal.
I was poor.

673
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,660
You're speaking.

674
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,160
I just have a students,
you know,

675
00:37:32,161 --> 00:37:32,994
students up a site map and I didn't 
spend much time in my heart because I 

676
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,080
wasn't looking place.
But Montreal,

677
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,460
peaceful,
right?

678
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,650
Great infrastructure,
great streets,

679
00:37:43,651 --> 00:37:45,060
life.
You're safe.

680
00:37:45,061 --> 00:37:47,550
There were three in the morning,
you can go anywhere in the city.

681
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,473
There's always something going on.
Often experiental cost public 

682
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,000
essentially like in many European 
cities.

683
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,770
Hell,
you're rich.

684
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:57,790
Well,
part of the reason you're reaching under

685
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:01,560
circumstances like that is because the 
inequality hasn't gotten out of control.

686
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,203
And so you know,
we need to figure out how to define 

687
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:05,184
wealth too,
because wealth is not just what you 

688
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:07,890
happen to possess.

689
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:14,890
That might be sas and status is useful,
but status and wealth,

690
00:38:14,891 --> 00:38:17,430
they're not the same thing.
Okay,

691
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:20,760
so now the issue is,
well,

692
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,313
there's a problem.
The problem is in quality goods are 

693
00:38:24,811 --> 00:38:27,270
unequally distributed and that's not 
fair.

694
00:38:27,271 --> 00:38:29,580
You know those additional problems that 
go along with that.

695
00:38:29,581 --> 00:38:34,130
Because one problem is is that if you 
happen to be in the top 1%,

696
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:35,143
it's easy.
Your check is your from your children's 

697
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:39,300
who also quite off the socioeconomic 
live.

698
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,473
Now it's not as easy as people think and
there's a reasonable probability that 

699
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:48,730
you'll fall and some of it is actually 
due to intelligence because it turns out

700
00:38:48,731 --> 00:38:52,900
that on average intelligence people have
more money than unintelligent people,

701
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:53,763
which hard becomes a surprise and 
conscientious people have more money 

702
00:38:56,561 --> 00:39:00,190
than I'm conscientious people,
which also hardly comes as a surprise.

703
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,450
And if you haven't become as your 
parents and you're more likely,

704
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:06,670
if you can tell yourself not as 
intelligent as them,

705
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,713
cause you addressed to the me,
even even the unequal distribution of 

706
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:13,750
intelligence sorts itself out across 
time.

707
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:15,363
But you show up there,
you still have what you might describe 

708
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:19,930
as a technically unfair advantage.
Okay,

709
00:39:19,931 --> 00:39:20,764
so you've got a distribution problem,
you got to technically unfair 

710
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,243
opportunity problem and it's reasonable 
to point those up and that's what the 

711
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:30,910
left does,
right?

712
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:33,850
That's what the leftover food,
it's functioning properly.

713
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,170
It says,
look,

714
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:36,790
we've got to keep the day,
I mean,

715
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:37,643
quality the Gini Coefficient,
let's say you're got to give you the 

716
00:39:40,171 --> 00:39:42,010
call.
He flattened out because we won't have a

717
00:39:42,011 --> 00:39:42,844
civil society without it.
And we'll meet people at the blog who 

718
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,070
could be productive and useful and we 
will get an opportunity and then we will

719
00:39:49,071 --> 00:39:51,790
get to enjoy all the cool things they 
might have made were invented.

720
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,200
And that's,
that's why I'm,

721
00:39:53,201 --> 00:39:54,880
that's a good point.
And you know,

722
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,440
when people say,
yeah,

723
00:39:56,441 --> 00:39:58,720
but if you flatten out the damn 
distribution too much,

724
00:39:58,721 --> 00:40:02,140
then you remove people's incentives and 
you don't want to do that too much.

725
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,100
And it's like,
yeah,

726
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,750
that's right.
True.

727
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:09,010
So you've got truth,
a truth be and o questionnaire as well,

728
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:11,280
which true ratings.
Right?

729
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,093
Well that brings us to the next one.
So I'm going to talk to some things 

730
00:40:17,201 --> 00:40:18,034
about right,
but here's what I'm going to tell you 

731
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,080
some things about last week.
So the first thing I'm going to do is to

732
00:40:22,081 --> 00:40:26,830
tell you about why people are like that.
And we've even,

733
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:30,670
and other labs [inaudible] labs first.
In fact,

734
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:31,853
um,
have you investigated the relationship 

735
00:40:33,191 --> 00:40:35,150
between the fundamental biological 
tempered,

736
00:40:35,151 --> 00:40:38,890
what's included intelligence and 
political?

737
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:39,923
That's called a viewpoint.
It's better to get an opinion or 

738
00:40:42,461 --> 00:40:44,440
attitude,
the idea of a viewpoint.

739
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:45,563
It gives you,
see,

740
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:46,563
when you guys look at the world,
you don't see the world and just see 

741
00:40:48,941 --> 00:40:52,570
that tiny little fragment of the world 
that you find valuable,

742
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,210
right?
If a rose to complicate it,

743
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:58,810
and I can know how many of you have seen
the famous invisible gorilla video,

744
00:40:58,811 --> 00:40:59,644
but you know,
there's a bunch of people playing 

745
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:05,800
basketball team 0.3 of them wanting and 
what I craved them,

746
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,050
it has the bouncing balls back and forth
between them.

747
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:11,410
You're supposed to count the number of 
times the way t passes basketball.

748
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,250
They feel a visual screen.
These,

749
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,620
these six people,
they're dense around this.

750
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,620
The best of all,
you're counting,

751
00:41:17,621 --> 00:41:18,940
you're thinking,
you're pretty damn smart.

752
00:41:18,941 --> 00:41:20,120
It just,
and you can count

753
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000
stands the screen and beats his chest 
for like 15 seconds and says songs off.

754
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,183
And then the experimenter baskets,
you did you notice anything strange and 

755
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,210
was saying no.
And he says,

756
00:41:35,211 --> 00:41:36,890
well,
how many passes did you say?

757
00:41:36,891 --> 00:41:38,380
16 and you think,
ah,

758
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:42,020
and then he says,
did you see the gorilla?

759
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,270
And he'd say,
what are luck?

760
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:45,030
Or talk to them.
You say what her role.

761
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:46,243
And so then you rerun the tape and sure 
enough quick power palatable ran 

762
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:52,670
hundreds girl right in the of the screen
you are just not very bright.

763
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,303
Three blind.
We are so large and the points were so 

764
00:41:58,281 --> 00:41:58,640
mine.

765
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,780
It's so focused in know we're kind of 
like a panel on a piece of paper.

766
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:07,790
You know human consciousness is likable.
The ball point portal that Canon,

767
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:10,550
it's writing but it's just barely making
contact.

768
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,650
Yeah.
What's enough to write and move on,

769
00:42:12,651 --> 00:42:13,484
which is not trivial but that's how 
focused we are and we're focused on the 

770
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:19,290
things that we find before.
But then question,

771
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:21,900
yes,
why don't we find the things we find the

772
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,813
portal and pardon and ask her.
That means at least in part Kimber 

773
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,750
kimber filters for you.
So for example,

774
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:31,340
an example,
if you're high in openness,

775
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:33,640
you're going to be attracted to duty.
You'd be attracted.

776
00:42:33,641 --> 00:42:35,240
Hispanics.
Could he trapped with ideas?

777
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:36,163
If you're an extrovert and it's like the
whole world is a part of it and you're 

778
00:42:38,121 --> 00:42:38,954
the entertainment if you're,
their audit is like key things that are 

779
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:45,230
game away from him cause you're 
agreeable.

780
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:47,600
It's relationships.
You want to take care of things,

781
00:42:47,601 --> 00:42:50,360
you want a formal relationships.
If you're conscientious,

782
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,313
it's like an eagle lake view,
a heat away due to the relative 

783
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:57,880
industries orderly.
And then not only did they,

784
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:02,510
does that cover your attitudes,
but it also filters things for you.

785
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,300
So you see the world through your 
temperament.

786
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:08,060
You can filter news through your 
temperament,

787
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,093
right?
And so well part of that is because 

788
00:43:11,301 --> 00:43:13,070
there's different niches in the world.
It's like,

789
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:13,933
you know,
maybe you're an entertainer is when 

790
00:43:14,631 --> 00:43:15,464
people like to fight,
you're part of the city you can be 

791
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:17,894
relied on.
So when people ask you to help them 

792
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,600
move,
which is the going from,

793
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:22,990
you know,
maybe you were agreeable.

794
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:23,833
So you know,
if someone needs to have a talk about 

795
00:43:25,251 --> 00:43:27,020
something that's bothering them,
that you're there,

796
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:30,500
maybe you're disagreeable or there's 
someone wants to blunt truth,

797
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,060
then you'll come and talk to you.

798
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,133
And so these are all places that you can
fit in the social structure and in the 

799
00:43:36,171 --> 00:43:38,770
world.
So that's where I lose that 30 again,

800
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,250
you know,
more power to it.

801
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:45,490
It's great people come equipped in the 
world with different tools and the tools

802
00:43:45,711 --> 00:43:48,470
allow them to do different things.
And that's what diversity is.

803
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,513
It's real diversity,
not that idiot diversity that was 

804
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:57,340
showing us
right in place of real diversity.

805
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,220
All right,
so are your,

806
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:04,150
the way you are now,
you know Tara is high character,

807
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:06,380
you know it can be both.
So for example,

808
00:44:06,381 --> 00:44:08,990
if you have a child who's high in 
neuroticism,

809
00:44:08,991 --> 00:44:09,824
let's say,
and you can tell if you have a child 

810
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:14,600
left out because there more fussy,
it's hard to calm them down.

811
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:17,540
They started or easily to a noise.
They're more,

812
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:20,710
you know,
in more cautious of strangers.

813
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,313
If something new,
the famous study by drove the get use 

814
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,410
robots to test kids.

815
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:31,160
See how they describe it that way.
Precisely.

816
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:36,270
He wrote all of a sudden Ronnie in his 
room with these reflect to your rules,

817
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,820
maybe wave line slash sheet and somebody
can use the extra virgin.

818
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:44,330
Not at all my courses and just,
you know,

819
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,990
interact with the devil and the more 
timid ones with hard to be heard.

820
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,700
Your parents,
mothers,

821
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:53,123
no man.
And that was adamant as early a six 

822
00:44:55,021 --> 00:44:55,854
months.
Now what Kagan found was that if the 

823
00:44:59,221 --> 00:45:00,054
people who have what he called inhibited
children were diligent in encouraging 

824
00:45:05,131 --> 00:45:05,964
them to get out and explore the world,
that their level of negative emotion 

825
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,740
could move towards normalization over a 
number of years.

826
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,370
But they never became truly fearless 
people.

827
00:45:17,371 --> 00:45:18,510
You know,
you could modify.

828
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,970
And of course if you have a kid like 
that and you miss,

829
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,150
treat them and make the regarding to 
very uncertain and you take away all the

830
00:45:24,151 --> 00:45:24,984
security from them,
then you can turn them into a complete 

831
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:30,240
neurotic wreck and they'll never 
recover.

832
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:31,650
And so,
and so,

833
00:45:31,651 --> 00:45:34,140
you know,
the same applies for extroversion and at

834
00:45:34,141 --> 00:45:36,770
the same applies for conscientiousness 
and agreeableness.

835
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:39,450
These things are deeply,
deeply rooted in people.

836
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,040
Now you can move them around to some 
degree,

837
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:42,960
but first of all,
why would you,

838
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:46,230
except maybe it's nice to have a kid 
feeling more emotionally stable.

839
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:51,450
Um,
it's okay if that diversity exists and

840
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,150
it's useful to know that it can be 
easily automated.

841
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:59,420
That's part of you.
The reason that's useful to know if,

842
00:45:59,421 --> 00:46:01,910
because one of the things that you want 
to know,

843
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:02,753
if you want to be successful,
find a damn job that suits your 

844
00:46:04,891 --> 00:46:05,724
cameraman because it's easier than 
changing their temperament to suit the 

845
00:46:09,211 --> 00:46:10,044
job.
So if you're is meredith and I had made 

846
00:46:12,191 --> 00:46:15,270
the commotion,
I would say say owes no problem.

847
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,050
And if you're like our radical 
extroverts,

848
00:46:19,051 --> 00:46:21,330
like computer programming,
probably not.

849
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,433
You're going to be the guy who's 
wandering around chatting to all the 

850
00:46:24,631 --> 00:46:26,770
other programmers and annoying the hell 
out of them.

851
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,633
The,
they're introverted and they can be 

852
00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:29,323
conscientious as well.
They want to do is be alone in the 

853
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:35,160
border until go away like joe you.
So,

854
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,640
okay,
so back to holy text.

855
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,073
Well,
it turns out that temperament predicts 

856
00:46:41,101 --> 00:46:46,101
political belief very nicely.
Now at the level of only predicting,

857
00:46:47,311 --> 00:46:49,470
say party affiliation or voting 
behavior,

858
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,840
you can give up 10% of the various 
political weight,

859
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:56,610
which doesn't sound like much,
but just lansing to throw the election,

860
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,830
right?
Because you know the hinge on time,

861
00:46:58,870 --> 00:46:59,703
90 markets the best presses up the u s 
but if you do a detailed analysis of 

862
00:47:03,211 --> 00:47:04,044
people's political beliefs,
so you differentiate how much farther 

863
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:11,751
than you you're voting behavior,
you can get like 30% of the variance.

864
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:12,623
It starts to get to viciously powerful,
powerful enough to make the assumption 

865
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,583
that the primary determinant of 
political belief is temporal and the 

866
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:21,293
primary each other,
the cameraman is biology and so you're 

867
00:47:23,671 --> 00:47:28,671
biologically pre disposed to be whatever
card you are.

868
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:30,550
Now you might say,
well,

869
00:47:30,551 --> 00:47:34,810
what about the well known where young 
people tend to be more liberal,

870
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:35,644
less bleeding in young people or do 
people tend to be in a more 

871
00:47:38,051 --> 00:47:40,150
conservative?
Part of the reason for that is if people

872
00:47:40,151 --> 00:47:44,550
get more conscientious as they age and 
so that it doesn't destroy it up.

873
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:47,810
I bought the system at all.
Now the reason that's useful to know,

874
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:48,810
he said,
you know,

875
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:52,270
if you're aware laughy and you're 
talking to someone who's right way,

876
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:55,750
you're not just talking to some blind 88
you to see the obvious truth.

877
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:56,853
You're talking to someone who's 
different than you and there's reasons 

878
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:02,680
that they're given.
It happens at different niche and occupy

879
00:48:02,681 --> 00:48:04,540
a different edge.
And that's a real niche.

880
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,030
It's real.
So here's an example.

881
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,500
Are you trying to predict 
entrepreneurial behavior for a long time

882
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:16,450
learned to do it or it's successful and 
he's nor obvious who entrepreneurs are?

883
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,640
You know,
are they the same as executives?

884
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:23,200
They say there's managers.
So they have to say is an industry,

885
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:27,310
is it the same as your first two 
professors are artists?

886
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:29,740
None of that.
It's all true though.

887
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:30,603
They're the same as ours.
So why don't you drivers are creative 

888
00:48:33,311 --> 00:48:35,320
people.
They're high in openness.

889
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:39,000
Now what that means is they're pretty 
damn good at coming up with eye gaze and

890
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:41,830
moving sideways and reading inside.
Cause if they have to,

891
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,770
but they generally aren't very good at 
all.

892
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:47,260
Everyone companies,
what do you want to run?

893
00:48:47,261 --> 00:48:50,900
The company is someone who's 
conscientious and conscientious people.

894
00:48:50,901 --> 00:48:53,830
They'll do what they're supposed to do.
If they know what it is,

895
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:57,760
they're not jumping all over the place.
They want to track to walk out.

896
00:48:58,130 --> 00:48:58,963
Right?
So if you have someone installing gas 

897
00:49:00,131 --> 00:49:04,150
pipes where there's not supposed to be 
any leaks cause otherwise they explode.

898
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:08,260
You want some obsessive conscientious 
got who wants to get with exactly right.

899
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:10,810
You don't want some Korean guy who wants
to make like a coach

900
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,990
consultant.
Entrepreneurs are afraid of him.

901
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:21,170
They're liberals and the managers and 
administrators on the conservative yet.

902
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:22,413
And so you need liberal place to start 
companies to be creative and you need 

903
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:32,380
conservative types to run.
And so that's kind kinda nice.

904
00:49:32,381 --> 00:49:35,200
You know,
how many creative types need compared to

905
00:49:35,201 --> 00:49:36,034
how big managerial types has the same 
problem as how many fingers do you need 

906
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:40,563
in the political sphere versus how many 
conservatives and actually conveys it 

907
00:49:44,111 --> 00:49:46,720
depends on circumstances.
Okay,

908
00:49:46,721 --> 00:49:50,530
so now we'll go into more deeply.
So heres the predictors,

909
00:49:50,531 --> 00:49:53,230
the fundamental predictors of political 
belief up.

910
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:56,290
Just a little conservative for now.
I say that just left and right.

911
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,480
I'll tell you about the flooding from 
prep types of,

912
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:02,380
but we'll just say the conventional left
to right distribution,

913
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:07,690
the right waivers are low in openness.
That's the creativity dimension,

914
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:10,000
right?
They can't think of very many uses for a

915
00:50:10,001 --> 00:50:11,470
break.
If you ask them,

916
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,513
he use this,
well you can't do 

917
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,240
[inaudible] [inaudible] I can change 
anything.

918
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,210
Creative guy,
he's going to get all sorts of like it's

919
00:50:22,211 --> 00:50:23,200
a hack,
you know,

920
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:28,610
and so on.
And so conservatives are low in openness

921
00:50:28,611 --> 00:50:29,444
and high in conscientiousness,
conscientiousness fractionated into 

922
00:50:32,331 --> 00:50:33,164
industriousness in order,
but he does and they're particularly 

923
00:50:34,881 --> 00:50:37,940
high in orderliness.
So that's the conservative,

924
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,540
not a very creative or and you know,
confection.

925
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,433
Here's some other things.
Let's say I'm ordering traditional 

926
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:51,700
hierarchical kid dutiful hi candidate 
here,

927
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:53,150
tactical,
conventional,

928
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:54,590
narrow,
predictable.

929
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:57,600
Now some of those things,
especially if you're labeled,

930
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:02,650
you say none of that for us.
Traditional hierarchical,

931
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,810
Jill doing it full or orderly.
It's like,

932
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:08,750
well do you want things in order or not?
You know what,

933
00:51:08,751 --> 00:51:12,080
the traffic lights working one of the,
his throw one time so to speak.

934
00:51:12,081 --> 00:51:14,210
You are with things to do what they're 
supposed to do.

935
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:15,103
So like while that the ordinary people 
out or do you want to go do something 

936
00:51:17,751 --> 00:51:19,300
exciting to get the hell away from them?

937
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:24,950
They have to have point now you could 
get to order and that's for sure and you

938
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:29,040
can get to anything.
That's the thing is that there's kickass

939
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:33,950
cookies at the end of the temperamental 
distributions to neurotic dog.

940
00:51:33,951 --> 00:51:35,870
Good.
Too conscientious.

941
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:39,440
You give a no on the obsessive side.
Maybe develop an eating disorder,

942
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:43,250
too agreeable everyone.
I'm sacrificing myself for everybody.

943
00:51:43,251 --> 00:51:44,084
It's like team,
you're resentful and bitter because it 

944
00:51:45,201 --> 00:51:50,201
can't stand up for yourself
to friend prison

945
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:59,370
incarceration.
It's like William Straight.

946
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:02,180
If you're bad,
you go off the rails because people make

947
00:52:02,181 --> 00:52:03,250
loud.
We want to be happy.

948
00:52:03,251 --> 00:52:03,721
He's like,
well,

949
00:52:03,721 --> 00:52:08,721
how many do you want to be
impulsive and there's no trace of it.

950
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:13,080
Someone who's an addict is they only 
money?

951
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:13,993
Why?
Because the world is such a wonderful 

952
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:15,670
place.
You find.

953
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:19,570
I just find that happy people are 
impulsive as a year.

954
00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:20,423
Notice if you're one of those people who
like to drink because it energizes you 

955
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:25,123
and you know who's probably 10% of the 
people in your life that it's like a 

956
00:52:27,741 --> 00:52:30,320
dream to be energized because most of 
you just to relax,

957
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:31,690
but some of you get energized.

958
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:35,180
It's like to make good decisions when 
you're in that habit is no,

959
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:38,320
happiness means rapport.
You can grab Napkins,

960
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,030
you content.
Sometimes that's what good idea,

961
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:40,913
but sometimes it's read it knowledge.
So don't be thinking then you know you 

962
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:45,253
can't get to happen.
It's like he'd get ready to be to 

963
00:52:46,971 --> 00:52:50,030
happen.
So you know they're,

964
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:50,953
they assess it.
Any virtue that becomes a virus and 

965
00:52:53,811 --> 00:52:57,710
that's where I began with the lows and 
the damn conservatives have to talk.

966
00:52:58,420 --> 00:52:59,091
Right?
Okay.

967
00:52:59,091 --> 00:52:59,924
So if you think you got a company,
you want to figure out how many 

968
00:53:01,501 --> 00:53:05,440
advantages versus how many entrepreneurs
who need and that's what that is.

969
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,980
And some circumstances there isn't a 
balance.

970
00:53:09,110 --> 00:53:09,943
You can't say,
well you need like 40% free people and 

971
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,333
60% conscientious me.
And the reason you can't say that it's 

972
00:53:16,641 --> 00:53:20,750
because the environment is a giant snake
and it continues.

973
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:21,583
It's giant eternal surfer and you're on 
it's back and you don't know which way 

974
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,184
it's going to move.
If you fall off and fall off the left 

975
00:53:28,081 --> 00:53:31,410
side of you die off right side,
you die and still run.

976
00:53:31,411 --> 00:53:34,020
You want to do is stay approximately in 
the middle.

977
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:37,780
And so when you need is one side 
pulling,

978
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:40,980
pulling,
pulling.

979
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,530
And what you hope is that by holding 
each other,

980
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,393
you say in the name of the damn snake 
and then you think about how can you 

981
00:53:47,021 --> 00:53:47,854
decide a pole and the answer is low,
but then maybe you killed the other 

982
00:53:53,941 --> 00:53:57,440
person or they kill you and they need 
them.

983
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:59,580
As it turns out,
or maybe your dad,

984
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:02,210
that doesn't seem like a very good 
solution again,

985
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,440
that that's actually the frog you're 
trying to solve.

986
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,360
And so you can,
you can,

987
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,380
you can become slaves to the other side.
You can impress the other side.

988
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:15,470
You can find with the other side or,
or you can talk,

989
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:17,680
okay,

990
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:20,560
that's the alternative.
You can talk and you're going to talk to

991
00:54:20,561 --> 00:54:23,140
those annoying people who aren't white 
kidney.

992
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:27,340
And one of the advantages to those who,
even people who aren't like,

993
00:54:27,341 --> 00:54:28,420
you know,
pleadings,

994
00:54:28,421 --> 00:54:29,254
you don't know

995
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:34,040
all those people.
You get along so well,

996
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:38,270
you're already like with you,
you can't remember anything from them.

997
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:40,130
They just know what the same thing as 
you know.

998
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,060
No,
that's fine.

999
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:45,030
Do you know everything you need to know?
So how do you know?

1000
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:46,463
Where do you want?
Give me whether or not you know 

1001
00:54:48,321 --> 00:54:53,321
everything you need to know who suffer.
So what you're suffering and you are.

1002
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:57,993
Then I would suggest you probably have 
something to learn because maybe if you 

1003
00:55:00,801 --> 00:55:02,570
learned that you wouldn't have to do 
that.

1004
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:04,880
Why?
But they're not going to say,

1005
00:55:04,881 --> 00:55:05,714
well,
since you were a new mobile soccer so 

1006
00:55:07,191 --> 00:55:09,260
much,
you should talk to someone who knows the

1007
00:55:09,261 --> 00:55:10,094
things you don't because then we'll try 
some things you don't know and then you 

1008
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:17,060
won't suffer so much.
And an ask the purpose of free speech.

1009
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:20,750
Okay,
so let's retracted with it now.

1010
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:23,790
You wouldn't use her problems.
Well obviously.

1011
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:27,170
Why don't you just tragic and shorter.
We have a problem.

1012
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:31,700
Poor people have problems.
Rich people have problems.

1013
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:34,910
What are the things?
It's actually quite sad about socialists

1014
00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:35,883
and perhaps about catalyst as well.
And both Roddick can overestimate the 

1015
00:55:39,441 --> 00:55:42,770
degree to which money can solve 
fundamental existential crawls.

1016
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:48,100
It actually can't own install.
This is quite clear on that too.

1017
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:51,373
Why don't you make enough money so 
you're not suffering from absolute 

1018
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:58,570
[inaudible],
which means that bill collectors chasing

1019
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:03,250
you around the get your life miserable.
Then additional button on we call it.

1020
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:07,670
And so when you get that baby at anybody
out to work in class,

1021
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:09,250
they go higher than that.
Yeah.

1022
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:11,990
We might still be resentful because 
there are legal or Richard and you.

1023
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:13,880
But did you get more money?
Doesn't help.

1024
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:18,950
Why?
Well why would you still die?

1025
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:20,503
Maybe you ain't no longer.
Maybe they can help you in catch later 

1026
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,850
for an extra year.

1027
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:28,743
Divorce.
Well it doesn't help me get along with 

1028
00:56:29,861 --> 00:56:30,694
your wife.
It doesn't help you necessarily get 

1029
00:56:31,901 --> 00:56:33,370
along with your kids.
No,

1030
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:34,263
it doesn't prevent him from dying or the
of various diseases doesn't make it my 

1031
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:42,260
similar while sometimes lots of times it
doesn't.

1032
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:47,050
Once you solve your basic economic 
problems cause she do,

1033
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:50,320
just to repeat,
what does he have running water,

1034
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:56,910
shelter
and access to the information you're up.

1035
00:56:57,370 --> 00:57:01,990
Stitches you can be to except to the 
comparitor your basic problems.

1036
00:57:01,991 --> 00:57:03,650
Our soul.
Again,

1037
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:07,870
the 90th percentile and maybe you want 
to hit the nine ninth to like one or two

1038
00:57:07,871 --> 00:57:08,704
of you,
but most of the problems I used to be 

1039
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:11,793
saul.

1040
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,193
Okay.

1041
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:18,920
Anyways,
people find problematic,

1042
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:20,630
right?
Life is suffering.

1043
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:26,140
That's a fundamental rule.
The rule is exactly her job.

1044
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,720
She transcendence,
which is a very straight,

1045
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:33,860
very surreal to say,
why do you think

1046
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:43,600
here's how animals,
here's the equipment,

1047
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:47,930
you're not stupid hunting as 
unbelievably intelligent.

1048
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,080
It's not the same kind of intelligence 
that we have.

1049
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:55,160
So the mosquitoes I'm riding the giant 
circuit to,

1050
00:57:55,161 --> 00:57:55,994
it's flipping everything.
Some of the ceos are talking about the 

1051
00:57:57,491 --> 00:58:00,480
dog and so how do we manage that?
Well there,

1052
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:04,930
I mean is made and cruise a whole slew 
of mosquitoes.

1053
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:11,080
No patch if it was feels or at all died 
except for one I didn't know [inaudible]

1054
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:17,720
you just keep going and so many,
many mosquito eggs,

1055
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:20,270
art of mosquitoes way of thinking,
right?

1056
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:23,470
Because what the mosquito was doing is 
producing small parents.

1057
00:58:23,471 --> 00:58:28,110
I was south,
which of those are going to survive?

1058
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:32,130
They're slightly different.
And then you know,

1059
00:58:32,131 --> 00:58:35,180
her wonderfulness white,
he said,

1060
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:38,030
why don't scale.
And you go back and tell you why we need

1061
00:58:38,031 --> 00:58:38,864
the deep and I need a yard.
So mosquitoes produce as much as areas 

1062
00:58:46,431 --> 00:58:48,690
of themselves and they're,
most of them died.

1063
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,553
And then one mosquito lives.
That's how they propagate themselves 

1064
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:54,580
through time.
So

1065
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:01,300
human beings the opposite thing.
[inaudible]

1066
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,313
very deep,
very number limit wrap up his or our 

1067
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:07,843
salt water into educated.
And we do that because our children are 

1068
00:59:13,061 --> 00:59:16,880
capable of producing,
bearing sometimes sat in front of me.

1069
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:20,030
So you know,
you play,

1070
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,550
did you get [inaudible] happen?
The Bar,

1071
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:25,040
you can send me out to her off that.
And in part because you know,

1072
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:27,530
give him a paid promotion but you're not
there.

1073
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,473
So that's what an idea is.
An idea is I'm avatar you and moral and 

1074
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:34,473
even think about this from an 
evolutionary perspective because the 

1075
00:59:36,471 --> 00:59:37,304
prefrontal Cortex,
which is the whole of your capacity to 

1076
00:59:39,621 --> 00:59:42,140
think abstractly,
grows the lower court.

1077
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:42,983
Yes.
An order for Texas to thinking that 

1078
00:59:44,181 --> 00:59:46,860
enables you to voluntarily [inaudible] 
world.

1079
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:49,450
And so what you do when you fake is 
generate,

1080
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:54,440
I'm strapped versions of yourself,
test them in a fictional environment,

1081
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:55,633
figure out which ones are stupid and 
likely to die and then don't act those 

1082
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:05,510
out
then at that than others.

1083
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:07,123
But nonetheless,
the technical person doesn't act out 

1084
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:12,303
their stupidest ideas.
And so we internalize the Darwinian 

1085
01:00:15,591 --> 01:00:16,424
process.
We think we pretty spare minutes of 

1086
01:00:18,471 --> 01:00:20,840
ourselves.
We killed them all for ourselves.

1087
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:21,973
And then when you're coming out,
the ones that you take your most likely 

1088
01:00:23,331 --> 01:00:26,730
to survive pretty damn smart.
So yeah,

1089
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:31,100
chaos.
But he has limitations.

1090
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:33,920
Limitations.
Well,

1091
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:37,070
we talked about one
camera.

1092
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:39,920
You know,
if you're a local person,

1093
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,020
phoned openness.
This is one of the things that drives me

1094
01:00:42,021 --> 01:00:46,700
crazy about conservatives.
So concerns are blind to bub.

1095
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,920
They're so fun.
Like I remember Harper,

1096
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,230
this is going to be one of the dumbest 
things he said.

1097
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:53,270
He was talking about harvest.

1098
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:59,120
He makes sense each hold like limousine 
artists that were

1099
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,260
what?
Sponging off the public purse.

1100
01:01:03,261 --> 01:01:04,094
You know these French artists,
it's like there's like three rich 

1101
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,760
artists to Canada,
right?

1102
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:09,143
The probability that you're going to get
Richard as an artist is so low that I 

1103
01:01:13,311 --> 01:01:14,144
didn't know.
You're like,

1104
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,231
you're like,
I'm you.

1105
01:01:15,231 --> 01:01:17,770
You're like you.
You're like an accident.

1106
01:01:17,771 --> 01:01:18,604
If you're,
if you're an artist and he would make 

1107
01:01:20,281 --> 01:01:23,150
enough money to survive,
it's impossible.

1108
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:26,390
There's no rich artists.
So,

1109
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:28,300
but the conservatives,
they don't think,

1110
01:01:28,301 --> 01:01:31,220
they don't see that because they don't 
see the contribution that artists make.

1111
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:34,420
You're blind to it.
And so I can give you exactly what,

1112
01:01:34,421 --> 01:01:39,421
how open people work and how they 
contribute to the public good.

1113
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,660
If he had a large city like Wilson,
you,

1114
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:46,340
you don't look at these trashy areas 
that are kind of cool and the old people

1115
01:01:46,341 --> 01:01:50,630
go there and the reason they go there is
because that's the frontier.

1116
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:53,030
And that's what,
when people go to the frontier,

1117
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,730
the Korean type status,
their niche is the frontier.

1118
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:58,190
There's for all tiers everywhere.
There's four in science.

1119
01:01:58,191 --> 01:02:00,890
Does Frontier [inaudible] frontier as 
literature.

1120
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:01,813
There's frontiers in cities and the 
frontier in the cities where there's 

1121
01:02:04,701 --> 01:02:09,000
other Lemar chaos then order.
But there's potential artistic type.

1122
01:02:09,001 --> 01:02:10,200
Sniff that out.
And I as part of,

1123
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:11,043
if they can only afford rent there,
don't just go hang out with your 

1124
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:17,210
neighbor.
They go,

1125
01:02:17,211 --> 01:02:18,620
hey hon and rough name because they 
think,

1126
01:02:18,621 --> 01:02:21,070
hey this,
they can sniff out

1127
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:23,693
galleries and maybe we start to go to 
coffee shops and then they start to do 

1128
01:02:25,711 --> 01:02:29,580
cool things and it starts to get cold.
And then the legs helping people who are

1129
01:02:29,581 --> 01:02:32,430
still kind of open go here and hay out.
They think that's cool.

1130
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:33,323
And then the entrepreneurial capital was
tied to start to notice and they start 

1131
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:41,910
the road safe and they have a place 
judge requires the artistic chased,

1132
01:02:41,911 --> 01:02:42,340
the Reiki.

1133
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:43,930
They don't have anybody cause they know 
how to

1134
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:50,100
improve some of the carbon for the city.
And so that's what creative people do.

1135
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:52,970
Beauty has an incredible,
incredible value.

1136
01:02:52,990 --> 01:02:54,620
Think about Europe.
You came,

1137
01:02:54,621 --> 01:02:58,000
it's a blend.
Two as a people or cities,

1138
01:02:58,010 --> 01:03:01,830
there's the garden,
they're European cities.

1139
01:03:01,831 --> 01:03:02,664
Men,
like were you saying about the hundreds 

1140
01:03:06,481 --> 01:03:08,570
of millions or billions of dollars that 
those dams,

1141
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:12,750
European step in Fargo cities,
you think about the return on investment

1142
01:03:12,751 --> 01:03:13,840
that they gathered,
you know,

1143
01:03:13,930 --> 01:03:14,763
I mean places like France and Spain have
more tourists then people all the time 

1144
01:03:18,690 --> 01:03:20,690
because people are going there from all 
over the world,

1145
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:23,460
bathing beauty.
Also,

1146
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:29,160
it's useful to talk to them open types 
and do appreciate what they have Prof.

1147
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:30,503
So anyways,
you're blinded by your camper 

1148
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:35,660
conservatives camps and beauty,
uh,

1149
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:37,253
liberal types,
especially if they're low in order to 

1150
01:03:38,671 --> 01:03:40,680
get us,
they can't see the value of diligence or

1151
01:03:40,681 --> 01:03:41,460
duty.

1152
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:44,700
So I ran it the right fingers,
traditional,

1153
01:03:44,701 --> 01:03:45,870
hierarchical,
the other gym,

1154
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:46,850
beautiful,
orderly,

1155
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:48,450
hygienic,
puritanical,

1156
01:03:48,451 --> 01:03:50,640
conventional,
narrow and predictable.

1157
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:51,653
The hygienic and puritanical thing that 
you could get up and down that's 

1158
01:03:54,151 --> 01:03:56,100
associated with disgust,
sensitivity.

1159
01:03:56,490 --> 01:03:57,323
There aren't really,
people are very sensitive to the US and 

1160
01:03:59,221 --> 01:04:00,054
part of the reason that the hyper 
conservative types are exclusionary is 

1161
01:04:04,081 --> 01:04:08,130
because they build walls around 
themselves to prevent contamination.

1162
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:10,680
And we'll get back to that.
And there's reasons for that.

1163
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:12,950
It's not arbitrary prejudice all the 
way.

1164
01:04:12,951 --> 01:04:16,590
It can be arbitrary prejudice.
Unfortunately it's more complicated that

1165
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:19,770
left fingers radical fluid,
mercurial,

1166
01:04:19,771 --> 01:04:23,130
Carolyn's chaotic,
unsanitary and promiscuous,

1167
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:28,500
12th of and he's doing it depends on 
your perspective.

1168
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:33,090
It's a little harder on the old sexually
transmitted disease.

1169
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:39,180
You know
how many people did age killed?

1170
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:44,010
About 400 million.
I think that's a fairly high increase in

1171
01:04:44,011 --> 01:04:44,844
pain,
I would say so it's not like there's 

1172
01:04:47,641 --> 01:04:48,474
nothing serious at the bottom of these 
various is there's something damn 

1173
01:04:50,791 --> 01:04:51,624
serious at the bottom of them and 
there's real room for flora of have 

1174
01:04:55,401 --> 01:04:58,110
informed opinions.
All right,

1175
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:00,780
so you got the conservative tax low in 
openness,

1176
01:05:00,781 --> 01:05:01,614
high in conscientiousness.
You want something done to their people 

1177
01:05:03,421 --> 01:05:04,650
to do it.
They're liable.

1178
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:07,800
They're traditional or hierarchical.
You have Velma structures,

1179
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:09,500
their guilt,
native soldiers.

1180
01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:12,180
It's very brilliant,
corrupt military accomplishment.

1181
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:14,520
Conscientiousness is a good grip crew of
race.

1182
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:17,090
It's a good predictor of manager of the 
bakery.

1183
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:24,550
The next test doesn't predict creative 
production,

1184
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:27,820
openness.
Openness is actually slightly need.

1185
01:05:27,821 --> 01:05:29,380
If he call me and we started ticketing 
product,

1186
01:05:29,381 --> 01:05:31,060
did it as far as we can tell because 
sorry,

1187
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:31,943
support,
mostly diligent rather than their 

1188
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:35,890
artistic the sciences and dealt with 
through the process.

1189
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:36,490
You know,
it's,

1190
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:37,323
it's a fact that you can grind it out,
which just part of why it's so damn 

1191
01:05:39,311 --> 01:05:43,500
powerful.
So they're gonna say,

1192
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:48,600
well why,
why would openness and conscientiousness

1193
01:05:48,731 --> 01:05:52,180
go together?
You political belief because they're not

1194
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:53,740
coordinating those,
there's traits.

1195
01:05:53,970 --> 01:05:54,803
It doesn't seem to be any real reason 
why they should clump together to 

1196
01:05:57,281 --> 01:06:01,360
determine the clinical to be turn in 
political opinion viewpoint.

1197
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,880
I was thinking about this a lot and I 
thought,

1198
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:05,340
well,
you know,

1199
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:10,090
the older people they like,
they like the Jack in the box,

1200
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:13,440
jump out the blocks and if they don't 
want the box to stay closed,

1201
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:15,610
they want all the possibility and the 
box does spring out.

1202
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:19,240
And so they can do cool things with it.
And if you're go to conscientiousness,

1203
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:20,620
they're going disgust,
sensitivity.

1204
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:22,660
So we are a character of borders between
things.

1205
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:23,823
So on the one hand,
they're not afraid of the absence of 

1206
01:06:25,721 --> 01:06:26,554
borders.
And I'm have to be like the exciting 

1207
01:06:27,881 --> 01:06:28,714
things that happens to the barbers are 
transgressed against and I were 

1208
01:06:31,181 --> 01:06:31,721
thinking,
well,

1209
01:06:31,721 --> 01:06:34,540
that pump conservative types,
they're high in conscientiousness.

1210
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:36,360
It's like they like orders that's 
ordered.

1211
01:06:36,361 --> 01:06:40,900
They like to be protected from 
contamination and the overall in this,

1212
01:06:40,901 --> 01:06:42,820
so they don't get any thrown with the 
Jack in the box,

1213
01:06:42,821 --> 01:06:45,010
jumps up the box.
They just think that they should stay in

1214
01:06:45,011 --> 01:06:47,920
the box for long it long.
And then I thought,

1215
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:48,873
well that's interesting.
You know I mentioned that works every 

1216
01:06:50,201 --> 01:06:53,560
single level of analysis.
It's like the conservative types,

1217
01:06:53,561 --> 01:06:57,100
like the border around concepts,
three main title identities,

1218
01:06:57,130 --> 01:07:00,000
sexual identity,
it's holes,

1219
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:03,070
private property towels,
provinces,

1220
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,090
states.

1221
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:05,283
I thought,
well that's what happened in the last 

1222
01:07:06,071 --> 01:07:07,780
election.
That's what happened.

1223
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:11,530
The trial because what did he say?
Let's feel the wall.

1224
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:12,693
It's about the borders.
Well that's what's happening to Europe 

1225
01:07:14,411 --> 01:07:16,330
to it's the borders.
Yeah,

1226
01:07:16,331 --> 01:07:17,560
that's right.
That's exactly right.

1227
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:21,250
That's what politics is about.
It's about borders between things.

1228
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:23,890
And if the fundamental argument is,
well,

1229
01:07:23,891 --> 01:07:25,570
she's worse.
She opened her clothes.

1230
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:26,553
And the answer that is,
it depends on the circumstances because 

1231
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:33,030
we're driving and johnny sermon,
Kevin Number,

1232
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:36,160
which weeks where you turn.
And sometimes here's what happens.

1233
01:07:36,161 --> 01:07:38,350
If you open the borders,
grace,

1234
01:07:38,770 --> 01:07:39,603
let's say you woke up from accidentally.
So this is what happened to the native 

1235
01:07:41,771 --> 01:07:44,440
Americans.
They are warriors,

1236
01:07:44,770 --> 01:07:46,390
let's say,
and his family.

1237
01:07:46,391 --> 01:07:47,530
And she'll go,
well,

1238
01:07:47,531 --> 01:07:50,020
you know the Spaniards and showed out 
for off on.

1239
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:50,873
We have the social side,
particularly rough time for the native 

1240
01:07:55,600 --> 01:07:56,380
Americans.
And you know,

1241
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:58,150
we conquered the entire territory.

1242
01:07:58,150 --> 01:07:58,983
But no man,
they had horses and armor and the need 

1243
01:08:01,261 --> 01:08:03,250
for having a crisis at the time.
And so,

1244
01:08:03,251 --> 01:08:04,530
you know,
that was bad luck,

1245
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:05,433
but that wasn't the real problem.
The real problem is that the Spanish 

1246
01:08:08,921 --> 01:08:09,754
were filled with the absolutely filthy,
like all the European city dwellers of 

1247
01:08:13,271 --> 01:08:15,030
the time packed.
And can you,

1248
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:17,580
he's living with animals,
Roy.

1249
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:21,320
The disease developed immunity to 
diseases.

1250
01:08:21,321 --> 01:08:22,980
So yeah,
when we got small parts,

1251
01:08:23,010 --> 01:08:23,843
but to die,
they book very horrible for chicken pox 

1252
01:08:27,981 --> 01:08:31,850
and we lived through the,
and you can make her mom's like healthy.

1253
01:08:31,851 --> 01:08:32,684
You were,
but you were well armed against 

1254
01:08:34,461 --> 01:08:36,020
pathogens.
Well,

1255
01:08:36,130 --> 01:08:38,420
not the North Americans,
not the Americans.

1256
01:08:38,421 --> 01:08:40,550
Not at all.
There's hardly any disease here.

1257
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:41,743
So the Spanish showed up,
not even 5% of the native American 

1258
01:08:45,801 --> 01:08:48,290
style.
Right.

1259
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:49,993
Think about that.
So many of them died and the puritans 

1260
01:08:52,641 --> 01:08:54,860
showed up,
which was a long time out with Hispanic,

1261
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:55,733
showed up.

1262
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,160
The native Americans were happy to see 
them to the Internet,

1263
01:08:58,190 --> 01:08:59,690
going to be able to take off their 
crops,

1264
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:03,640
guessing like the third of European sky.
Yeah.

1265
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:08,420
I thought it was a border issue to break
because the racks came in off the shifts

1266
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:12,270
and it sailed somewhere else.
30% of the European startups,

1267
01:09:12,290 --> 01:09:13,130
black player.
Well,

1268
01:09:13,131 --> 01:09:13,964
that's not good compared to 95% all in 
the borders to see what the hell 

1269
01:09:18,501 --> 01:09:21,140
happens.
It's dangerous.

1270
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:22,520
You know,
liberal types.

1271
01:09:22,521 --> 01:09:23,354
No,
no,

1272
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:24,940
not all.
Wonderful.

1273
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:27,570
Now the liberals will say,
well,

1274
01:09:27,571 --> 01:09:29,090
I'll just hold on a minute.
It's like,

1275
01:09:29,091 --> 01:09:29,924
yeah,
yeah,

1276
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:33,950
there's some danger in close quarter in 
open borders,

1277
01:09:33,951 --> 01:09:35,870
but they won't say that because they 
can't see that.

1278
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:37,750
But if they were sensitive and we'd say,
yeah,

1279
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:41,750
we buy the argument that there's danger 
in open borders.

1280
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:47,150
I think of all the drivers just soak the
borders between everyday was like,

1281
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:49,970
yeah,
fluency and thought.

1282
01:09:49,970 --> 01:09:50,803
You here to talk about the relationship 
with the fluency in thought and the 

1283
01:09:53,541 --> 01:09:57,050
ability to think divergently and 
creativity.

1284
01:09:57,051 --> 01:09:58,100
It's like,
Whoa,

1285
01:09:58,110 --> 01:10:01,250
become old and borders between things,
between concepts,

1286
01:10:01,251 --> 01:10:03,140
between people,
between towns.

1287
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:04,933
We're not going to have any new ideas,
but I'm going to get anything new 

1288
01:10:06,941 --> 01:10:07,774
happening.
We're hungry to go find a stranger from 

1289
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:10,664
another culture and welcome them in and 
find out what they held her up to a 

1290
01:10:12,871 --> 01:10:15,080
train and come and get all the cool 
stuff.

1291
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,920
That's a problem.
If we caused the borders to type it,

1292
01:10:18,921 --> 01:10:19,754
then what's going to happen is we're 
going to stay that safety regarding to 

1293
01:10:23,211 --> 01:10:24,560
stand to say,
Bro,

1294
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:27,350
look the same.
We talk the same and then the damn snake

1295
01:10:27,351 --> 01:10:30,260
is going to move and every single one of
us is going to fall off.

1296
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,120
It's like,
yeah,

1297
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:37,760
well sort of service and gavel open the 
borders staff and the liberals say

1298
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:42,920
closed borders debt and the right,
both of them are right.

1299
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:43,813
That's the thing.
They're both right and that's why we 

1300
01:10:47,481 --> 01:10:49,580
need to talk to each other.
You see,

1301
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,133
because we can't out.
So figure out how to stay on the 

1302
01:10:54,861 --> 01:10:57,740
secretary of the snake without talking 
to them.

1303
01:10:58,250 --> 01:10:59,083
Now you've got your biases,
your cognitive biases that are built 

1304
01:11:01,311 --> 01:11:02,144
into you,
and so you're blind to all solve the 

1305
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:06,390
world and so you're going to sit down 
and fit.

1306
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:10,600
If you're thinking you actually break 
yourself into avatars,

1307
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:12,470
cards,
and you give all those appetizers,

1308
01:11:12,471 --> 01:11:13,304
the voice,
and then you let them how she knows and 

1309
01:11:15,301 --> 01:11:16,650
the woman,
where did she go?

1310
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:20,670
So even when you were thinking you're 
basically engaged in dialogue,

1311
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:22,390
it's just what you're doing it 
internally.

1312
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:23,573
But you have limits on that because 
unless you're very good at figuring 

1313
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:26,514
that,
you probably don't want it because 

1314
01:11:26,791 --> 01:11:28,420
people aren't going to do the thinking 
there.

1315
01:11:28,421 --> 01:11:29,254
They're really good at jumping into 
predetermined to conclusions and very 

1316
01:11:31,741 --> 01:11:34,290
bad thing because it's hard to think 
it's annoying.

1317
01:11:34,470 --> 01:11:36,900
It's just stressful that it's 
technically difficult.

1318
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:39,720
It requires training.
You have to be able to write,

1319
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,600
you have to be able to think clearly.
I feel to formulate an argument you have

1320
01:11:42,601 --> 01:11:43,434
to read.
It's like it's really hard to think and 

1321
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:50,540
sold as much as could just fly over your
built a priori temperamental soldiers,

1322
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:53,490
which is what people do to to a great 
degree.

1323
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:55,590
But when I say you can figure to some 
degree,

1324
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:58,230
well good.
So that means there's forms of death and

1325
01:11:58,231 --> 01:12:00,600
misery then you can avoid with some 
degree of,

1326
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:03,870
of you tell them,
but you're full of biases.

1327
01:12:03,871 --> 01:12:04,704
You're going to miss this.
This is part of why married people live 

1328
01:12:07,081 --> 01:12:09,420
longer and you never narrative someone.
They're annoying.

1329
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:10,313
You could think differently than you,
but that's so helpful if you listen to 

1330
01:12:12,601 --> 01:12:13,434
them because they can have two brains.
Two brains actually get you through the 

1331
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:17,124
royal families of one grade if the 
brains are communicating and if they 

1332
01:12:19,951 --> 01:12:21,120
have some differences,
right,

1333
01:12:21,121 --> 01:12:22,590
because then you're not just producing 
the same.

1334
01:12:23,490 --> 01:12:28,490
So if I open myself up to someone else 
and talk to them it in dialogue,

1335
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:31,193
then be correct.
The errors in my thinking and then 

1336
01:12:33,721 --> 01:12:34,554
perhaps less less chance of suffering 
and dying and so the reason that you 

1337
01:12:40,741 --> 01:12:41,574
have to engage your Donald Donald's 
because that lifts you out of your a 

1338
01:12:43,921 --> 01:12:44,754
parochial view and helps you clarify the
world and clarify how to act in the 

1339
01:12:50,791 --> 01:12:53,810
world with all these different people 
that you have to get along with.

1340
01:12:53,910 --> 01:12:54,743
That's part of it,
but also to survive just in the world 

1341
01:12:57,570 --> 01:13:00,930
and make a little sidebar.
Here is something that we can talk about

1342
01:13:00,931 --> 01:13:01,764
more in future.
I have been thinking about those damn 

1343
01:13:04,291 --> 01:13:08,880
postmodernists
pernicious,

1344
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:09,983
horrible idea is true that any text has 
an infinite number of potential 

1345
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:16,403
interpretations and then therefore 
there's no way of determining which 

1346
01:13:19,891 --> 01:13:23,850
interpretation is correct.
Now the problem with that interpretation

1347
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:24,773
because it in some perverse sense is 
true because there are so many 

1348
01:13:29,221 --> 01:13:34,221
phenomenon the delay themselves before 
you even the world that you can construe

1349
01:13:34,281 --> 01:13:37,890
it involved in different ways,
but here's for the wrong.

1350
01:13:43,630 --> 01:13:45,510
They say you can interpret it that same 
way.

1351
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:48,690
Therefore you're traveling the world in 
a way because the world is like a text.

1352
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:52,450
If it has multiple potential donation,
but looking for

1353
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:56,250
some of those interpretations will kill 
you.

1354
01:13:56,970 --> 01:13:59,520
Someone goes into her,
patients will make you suffer.

1355
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:02,660
Some of those are patients will make 
people around you suffer.

1356
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:05,850
Some of those interpretations will make 
people hate you.

1357
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:10,350
Some of those interpretations will make 
people refuse to cooperate with you.

1358
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:11,633
So you say,
well there's this multiplicity of 

1359
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:17,500
interpretations,
but it's constrained by the necessity of

1360
01:14:17,501 --> 01:14:19,840
preserving yourself.
Preservative,

1361
01:14:19,841 --> 01:14:22,200
dyadic relationships,
preservative,

1362
01:14:22,210 --> 01:14:23,260
progams,
social,

1363
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:26,080
social contexts.
So happy in a manner.

1364
01:14:26,081 --> 01:14:30,850
So pursuing your own selfish interests 
definitely stabilized old damn game.

1365
01:14:30,910 --> 01:14:33,790
And also when you act in the actual 
world,

1366
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:37,240
it doesn't slap you so hard across the 
face that you perish.

1367
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:38,583
And so yes,
there are home with the DMP 

1368
01:14:40,420 --> 01:14:41,253
certifications,
but there is a very tiny fraction of 

1369
01:14:44,071 --> 01:14:46,870
them that actually have any functional 
utility.

1370
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:48,113
So I'm the runs completely be the 
nihilistic argument related to 

1371
01:14:53,711 --> 01:14:56,310
multiplicity.
That's at the basis of postmodernist.

1372
01:14:56,770 --> 01:14:57,603
They know what's at the basis of 
postmodernism cause that's why they 

1373
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:00,244
turned the Marxism Dornier themselves.
Because you can't do anything if you're 

1374
01:15:02,981 --> 01:15:05,980
a postmodernist because there's no 
proper solution.

1375
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:09,460
So anyways,
back to free speech.

1376
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:14,103
You have to think because if you don't 
think you die but you're too stupid to 

1377
01:15:17,531 --> 01:15:18,930
pick rod,
you are,

1378
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:21,760
you have to talk to other people because
they tell me why you're stupid.

1379
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:24,100
And then if you listen,
you're not quite so stupid.

1380
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:27,550
Now you go and die for often.
So that's the bottom line.

1381
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:28,563
And they might say,
well who should I talk to them and 

1382
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:30,373
answered as well.
If you talk to people that you agree 

1383
01:15:31,421 --> 01:15:32,254
with,
you don't burn anything cause they are 

1384
01:15:32,811 --> 01:15:33,644
to think the same way you do.
And unless you're 100% correct and I 

1385
01:15:36,941 --> 01:15:39,790
will be very,
very hesitant about including that.

1386
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:43,240
If you're still suffering and I her 100%
correct,

1387
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:44,610
then you've got to go find out an 
entity.

1388
01:15:44,611 --> 01:15:45,444
Have you talked to,
because maybe they'll point something 

1389
01:15:46,931 --> 01:15:49,000
out to you that you seriously,
seriously,

1390
01:15:49,001 --> 01:15:52,030
seriously needs to know.
And so you know,

1391
01:15:52,050 --> 01:15:55,120
our culture of Western civilization,
let's say roughly speaking,

1392
01:15:55,330 --> 01:15:56,200
it's a good culture.

1393
01:15:56,980 --> 01:15:58,450
You know,
like I'm the utopian,

1394
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,433
it's got its problems.
If you compare it to a hypothetical 

1395
01:16:01,991 --> 01:16:06,430
utopia is hell on earth except we're 
not.

1396
01:16:06,431 --> 01:16:09,970
Hypothetical.
Utopia actually tries to manifest itself

1397
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:12,490
because Ben didn't find out what really 
is.

1398
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:14,073
But that is how you compare a society.
What you do is you take a society and 

1399
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:18,433
say,
well how are we good compared to like 

1400
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:23,170
other societies and actress?
Well,

1401
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:25,930
you won't be hampered skill you guys 
like that.

1402
01:16:25,931 --> 01:16:28,690
They could go wherever they want and so 
when they go,

1403
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:29,853
well they go to that tiny handful of 
countries that has the lacy that's 

1404
01:16:35,951 --> 01:16:38,650
tightly associated with free speech.
Why?

1405
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:42,490
Because basically we can solve our 
problems that we have.

1406
01:16:42,550 --> 01:16:44,260
We don't have any,
we got a loss,

1407
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:47,770
but we can solve a why cause we figured 
something out.

1408
01:16:47,790 --> 01:16:48,623
We figured out that there's nothing more
important than free speech because 

1409
01:16:53,111 --> 01:16:54,190
that's what thinking is.

1410
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:57,610
That's the logos that sits at the bottom
of our culture,

1411
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:58,473
right?
The divine word that transforms chaos 

1412
01:17:01,361 --> 01:17:05,620
into order continually and you are 
taking half,

1413
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:09,730
not individually precisely.
Although you do as an can,

1414
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:10,573
participate in conversation,
communication with other soul and also 

1415
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:21,320
sad you straight.
If you're not afraid,

1416
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:24,960
then you suffer and die and so when 
people around,

1417
01:17:26,110 --> 01:17:29,920
because lots of people laying that down.
But if you're nodding at that end,

1418
01:17:29,930 --> 01:17:31,920
if you're ready to get it done,
you should really

1419
01:17:37,090 --> 01:17:42,090
be hearing is it the task stuffy and 
where the work to bring it to a hall,

1420
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:45,500
making her song case for that.
I think it's a terrible case.

1421
01:17:45,501 --> 01:17:50,501
I think it's a profoundly flawed chase 
because it's predicated on the idea that

1422
01:17:50,511 --> 01:17:53,640
you've already done everything you could
to improve phase.

1423
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:55,633
So I would say well before you transform
yourself into the ultimate judge of 

1424
01:18:00,621 --> 01:18:01,454
being,
you should try to get your act together 

1425
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:05,810
to some degree and see if you can draw 
things around.

1426
01:18:05,811 --> 01:18:10,580
You can render your final judgment and 
how you do that.

1427
01:18:10,670 --> 01:18:13,160
Well,
what does that mean?

1428
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:16,830
What do you no,
no,

1429
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:17,664
no.
That's where things aren't right that 

1430
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:20,973
sex,
the other and go on as well for you and 

1431
01:18:23,490 --> 01:18:25,500
I'm going to work for your family.
It could be,

1432
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:28,050
or your community or your country or the
world

1433
01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:34,940
you can be trying to solve.
Then he asked us a couple,

1434
01:18:34,941 --> 01:18:37,650
are you touring assault?
That's not the right person,

1435
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:40,850
right?
First two years are trying to solve them

1436
01:18:40,851 --> 01:18:45,851
with all your heart and mind and soul.
And that is no,

1437
01:18:45,950 --> 01:18:49,580
I spent six hours a day wasting time,
which is pretty much standard.

1438
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:54,080
And you got no right to say anything at 
all except started getting bacteria.

1439
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:58,520
And so it's time for everyone,
right?

1440
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:04,090
That's the right response is that 
orients you property towards Ba and then

1441
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:04,933
being humble,
knowing that you don't have your act 

1442
01:19:06,321 --> 01:19:07,154
together.
Then maybe you open your eyes when you 

1443
01:19:08,511 --> 01:19:09,530
say todd,
just more things.

1444
01:19:09,531 --> 01:19:11,210
I don't know what.
I'm stupid.

1445
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:12,950
And there's some people who are 
different from me.

1446
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:13,873
Maybe if I talk to them,
listen to mostly cause you wouldn't 

1447
01:19:16,431 --> 01:19:19,070
believe when people will bloody will 
tell you if you listen to them.

1448
01:19:19,071 --> 01:19:24,071
It's just absolutely unbelievable
experience listening to people.

1449
01:19:25,461 --> 01:19:28,820
Cause I'm a clinical psychologist cause 
it's like there's a dos nfc.

1450
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:29,693
No.

1451
01:19:32,120 --> 01:19:32,953
Once you get the problem,
88 theological presuppositions and they 

1452
01:19:35,541 --> 01:19:39,200
start talking about the reality that 
they're actually in contact with.

1453
01:19:39,410 --> 01:19:43,790
They're endlessly revealing and remark 
and you learn.

1454
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:44,633
And you mentioned listening to what a 
good deal that is because you're not 

1455
01:19:47,811 --> 01:19:50,030
very smart and he was suffering.
And so you know,

1456
01:19:50,031 --> 01:19:51,620
if you could learn something from 
someone,

1457
01:19:51,980 --> 01:19:54,820
especially someone different than you,
it's like wow,

1458
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,660
it's a good day math in sixth grade.
Okay.

1459
01:19:58,910 --> 01:20:00,070
So,
okay,

1460
01:20:00,120 --> 01:20:00,953
so

1461
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:06,170
back to the left lane.
Well,

1462
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:09,020
right.
What do you are,

1463
01:20:14,990 --> 01:20:15,823
you know,
disintegrated or I don't pick up after 

1464
01:20:19,141 --> 01:20:23,890
themselves
because sometimes we need that.

1465
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:28,350
And then so there were no,
just a sec conservatives.

1466
01:20:28,650 --> 01:20:33,030
Well,
I know they've got the blinders on,

1467
01:20:33,031 --> 01:20:36,910
man.
They're just not that exciting this page

1468
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:44,340
and make it a little discriminatory.
They like things to stay where they are,

1469
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,100
so they're not that much fun to party 
with.

1470
01:20:46,350 --> 01:20:51,350
You want something done?
Well,

1471
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:56,090
they're equal and you know,
they're hauling the people that you want

1472
01:20:56,100 --> 01:20:58,560
to be false sterilized,
hypodermic needles,

1473
01:20:58,561 --> 01:20:59,394
for example.

1474
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:08,180
So let's appreciate political 
distribution and let's understand that.

1475
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:11,310
You need to say on the dark in there.
I'm snake.

1476
01:21:11,790 --> 01:21:12,623
Okay,
so I'll close with a little more 

1477
01:21:14,551 --> 01:21:18,720
elaboration on the left.
The main rationale for free speech,

1478
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:24,690
that was something like free speech is 
being used by fascists

1479
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:30,200
or as far as politically correct.
Radical left is conservative.

1480
01:21:30,550 --> 01:21:33,330
Everything because he used to impress 
the oppressed.

1481
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:35,273
They got a one size fits all solution.
It's corporate intellectually and it's 

1482
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:43,440
pathological world and that's part of,
it's just too easy.

1483
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:46,860
I the side of the oppressed that needs 
to be a good person.

1484
01:21:46,940 --> 01:21:47,773
It's like,
you know,

1485
01:21:48,420 --> 01:21:49,253
first of all,
what makes you think you're on the side 

1486
01:21:50,711 --> 01:21:52,260
of your pressed?
Really,

1487
01:21:52,730 --> 01:21:53,563
you really dare to claim
it's not so easy to be on the side of 

1488
01:21:57,441 --> 01:21:58,274
the deal press.
It takes a hell of a lot of work to be 

1489
01:22:00,331 --> 01:22:01,164
on the side of the oppressed and you can
do sergeants in the face of people that 

1490
01:22:04,351 --> 01:22:05,280
you think you,
hey,

1491
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,880
that's not on the side.
You'll laugh.

1492
01:22:08,160 --> 01:22:10,950
That's no matter to say,
why am against poverty?

1493
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:27,920
[inaudible]

1494
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:39,640
oh,
[inaudible]

1495
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:44,253
you a word.
If there was some controversy company 

1496
01:22:50,851 --> 01:22:51,684
come to visit,
there's a little article in the 

1497
01:22:53,021 --> 01:22:58,021
newspaper.
Somebody who was your professor said was

1498
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:01,880
reprehensible.
I was making the space on safe,

1499
01:23:02,230 --> 01:23:07,230
but you can tell
presuppositions and get down to the,

1500
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:14,403
and so
I tweeted out with top off the linfield 

1501
01:23:19,211 --> 01:23:24,211
college to violate some safe space.
It's a satirical show.

1502
01:23:29,090 --> 01:23:32,460
They got wind of it.
That's a pretty vicious tweet.

1503
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:42,350
Doesn't matter the venue,
I mean serious

1504
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:57,550
of all the people who should be in favor
of free speech,

1505
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:02,330
it shouldn't be the people who are 
hypothetically on the side of the people

1506
01:24:02,331 --> 01:24:06,880
press.
Why the radical left precept position is

1507
01:24:06,881 --> 01:24:09,850
everything's a hyper dominant patriarchy
and the people at the park,

1508
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:11,410
all the power.
Okay,

1509
01:24:11,411 --> 01:24:14,380
well then the people at the top,
whenever they want,

1510
01:24:14,381 --> 01:24:16,750
they own the newspapers,
they own TV stations.

1511
01:24:16,810 --> 01:24:19,120
They only advertisements.
They only corporations.

1512
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:20,940
They can say wherever they want,
whenever

1513
01:24:23,050 --> 01:24:25,800
they don't need to be protected.
Obviously they have a little,

1514
01:24:25,950 --> 01:24:28,840
and I'm speaking from a logical 
framework,

1515
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:29,733
right?
Well who needs for connection if they 

1516
01:24:31,031 --> 01:24:35,170
want to speak for obviously the people 
who are up the water.

1517
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:38,200
Okay,
so let's review the evidence.

1518
01:24:40,570 --> 01:24:44,890
Social movements of the 20th century.
What's the way mantra,

1519
01:24:44,920 --> 01:24:48,700
speak truth to power?
That means you've got,

1520
01:24:48,910 --> 01:24:49,743
you have to be able to speak to speak 
out and hypothetically not going to be 

1521
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:56,830
in power.
Things like,

1522
01:24:56,831 --> 01:24:59,560
hey,
that's a lot of what you've got on half

1523
01:25:01,470 --> 01:25:05,170
my core aid,
but why people are you kidding?

1524
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:08,890
He's got a lot of courage.
That guy and he's conquered.

1525
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,470
Know he's,
he's a show both.

1526
01:25:11,530 --> 01:25:13,450
He started my butt.
That's version of vital

1527
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:18,373
comedians,
like definitely got Walter play because 

1528
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:21,440
they're good at,
they're good at social critics.

1529
01:25:21,441 --> 01:25:24,040
You know,
so far you got to speak truth to power.

1530
01:25:24,041 --> 01:25:26,700
Well then you better be able to speed 
that.

1531
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:29,140
That's the fundamental issue.
So,

1532
01:25:29,970 --> 01:25:31,740
okay,
so you're left your,

1533
01:25:32,050 --> 01:25:35,350
you want to slap it on the inequality,
the Rhogam and you think,

1534
01:25:35,351 --> 01:25:36,184
well Geez,
I'm going to be able to talk about this 

1535
01:25:36,971 --> 01:25:37,720
at least.

1536
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:41,260
And then you think,
well let's,

1537
01:25:41,530 --> 01:25:44,220
let's restrict free speech and many 
things.

1538
01:25:44,290 --> 01:25:46,300
Here's a,
here's a lesson from the military.

1539
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:48,560
If you make a weapon here,
meb,

1540
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:52,020
how's it been 15 years?
So you know,

1541
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:56,380
the logical conclusion to that is 
something like kind of be slightly carry

1542
01:25:56,390 --> 01:26:00,850
both which weapons you made it and so 
what's the lesson for their free speech?

1543
01:26:01,190 --> 01:26:02,710
Trump haters.
It's like

1544
01:26:05,090 --> 01:26:07,880
you guys are the ones who think that 
everyone else has to power.

1545
01:26:08,690 --> 01:26:09,523
You start restricting free speech,
which you're doing what you're doing it 

1546
01:26:13,130 --> 01:26:14,660
radically,
continually,

1547
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:17,870
no stall.
It's like you think for a moment.

1548
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:20,270
If those people who have the power and 
the,

1549
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:22,760
let's say the crooked people who have 
the power,

1550
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:25,160
just to clarify it,
you just take that,

1551
01:26:25,161 --> 01:26:28,400
they're not going to get a lot better at
that than me real quick here.

1552
01:26:28,401 --> 01:26:30,310
So glad they're naive and it's doing 
even funny.

1553
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:35,810
They're going to be those.
Every single one he used to oppress free

1554
01:26:35,811 --> 01:26:38,770
speech is going to be a bat.
You would force it.

1555
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:41,600
You can imagine.
And so then you wonder,

1556
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:43,790
well,
people that are pushing us west whatsapp

1557
01:26:43,810 --> 01:26:46,740
with are naive.
Is that whole?

1558
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:47,633
Are they going to eat or are they 
willfully blind or are they actually 

1559
01:26:50,671 --> 01:26:53,610
malevolent,
but they actually aiming at,

1560
01:26:54,990 --> 01:26:59,820
now I'll go with naive because that's 
the simplest explanation,

1561
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:02,820
but I wouldn't rule out the other ones.
All right,

1562
01:27:02,821 --> 01:27:07,620
so let's look at the 20th century
suffered.

1563
01:27:07,621 --> 01:27:08,880
Yes,
women's rights.

1564
01:27:09,530 --> 01:27:12,690
How did that come about?
Freedom of speech,

1565
01:27:13,650 --> 01:27:14,483
labor unions,
the powerful did not want the labor 

1566
01:27:17,341 --> 01:27:19,350
unions to organize.
How did that come upon?

1567
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:23,640
Freedom of speech,
all of civil rights for black people and

1568
01:27:23,641 --> 01:27:24,680
Mexicans,
but Mexicans,

1569
01:27:24,681 --> 01:27:26,460
civil rights movement isn't as well 
know.

1570
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:27,353
How'd that come about?
How about constitutional protection for 

1571
01:27:30,691 --> 01:27:31,524
free of fees?
What are the students who it started in 

1572
01:27:34,301 --> 01:27:37,120
that absolute grassy s virtually

1573
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:42,300
[inaudible].
The free

1574
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:49,430
speech movement started in 1964 
[inaudible] 65 after.

1575
01:27:49,730 --> 01:27:51,020
Why?
Well,

1576
01:27:51,021 --> 01:27:51,854
there was a ban on normal standard 
campus political activities and so the 

1577
01:27:55,931 --> 01:28:00,050
students fought for the right to free 
speech and academic freedom and the one,

1578
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:05,210
well,
they weren't since they're on the left,

1579
01:28:05,211 --> 01:28:06,140
those people,
right,

1580
01:28:06,141 --> 01:28:08,120
they were already ally.
If it's a civil rights movement,

1581
01:28:08,330 --> 01:28:09,163
they became the leaders of the students 
move with him as he had them anti war 

1582
01:28:11,151 --> 01:28:14,570
movement to other movements which 
depending on free speech.

1583
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:19,630
What about the environmental movement or
the lgbt movement with all,

1584
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:24,640
it's not dependent on free speech for 
obviously these were can you support rex

1585
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:26,713
marginalized people?
All they had was their capacity to 

1586
01:28:29,781 --> 01:28:34,030
formulate an argument to make a sad 
sacks if they didn't have the power.

1587
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:35,120
Right?
Right.

1588
01:28:35,230 --> 01:28:38,600
Lackeys they didn't have the power.
That's the honey claim,

1589
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:43,260
so we're powered and they have,
they have the power to speak German.

1590
01:28:43,310 --> 01:28:47,210
That's actually power.
Its real power and so if you're normally

1591
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:50,180
side,
if you will crest like you claim,

1592
01:28:50,990 --> 01:28:51,823
then you should be standing up as 
diligently as you possibly can for free 

1593
01:28:55,611 --> 01:28:56,444
speech because it's the most powerful 
weapon you have to write the societal 

1594
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:05,580
that you're hypothetically and perhaps 
realistically concerned about.

1595
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:09,030
We have to discuss inequality for 
example.

1596
01:29:09,090 --> 01:29:09,923
You have to discuss it long enough until
we figure out how saw everything from 

1597
01:29:14,941 --> 01:29:15,774
stacking up at one end of the 
distribution and then everyone else 

1598
01:29:19,540 --> 01:29:22,020
hitting zero,
and this is going to be a big problem.

1599
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:23,470
So example,

1600
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:26,693
yeah,

1601
01:29:27,010 --> 01:29:30,640
the Tesla guys,
they're building on top of the sarcoma,

1602
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:32,890
but they're not stupid.
You know,

1603
01:29:33,220 --> 01:29:37,310
you ain't going to stop there.
We're building a condoms.

1604
01:29:37,430 --> 01:29:40,450
He goes,
they're building robots and robots.

1605
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:44,560
Autonomous Robots are first going to 
take the shape of a car.

1606
01:29:44,830 --> 01:29:49,830
An autonomous car is no more a car.
Then the car was a horse drawn carriage.

1607
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:50,913
They're not the same thing.
They're not even close to the same 

1608
01:29:53,261 --> 01:29:54,094
thing.
And they're going to produce societal 

1609
01:29:55,481 --> 01:29:57,930
transformations that are so radical 
lifter unmanageable.

1610
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:00,730
But I can tell you one of the 
transformations that going to occur,

1611
01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:05,680
what's the most common source of 
employment for Man in North America?

1612
01:30:06,580 --> 01:30:09,390
Driver,
right?

1613
01:30:09,550 --> 01:30:12,310
And so for instance,
the autonomous robots show up,

1614
01:30:12,370 --> 01:30:16,180
which isn't going to be very long then 
why all those people going to do,

1615
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:19,720
and the answer is they're going to stack
up at zero.

1616
01:30:20,350 --> 01:30:22,300
And that's what's already happened in 
the United States.

1617
01:30:22,301 --> 01:30:24,610
In particular in the rust belts.
I mean,

1618
01:30:24,611 --> 01:30:26,170
that's why trump got elected,
right?

1619
01:30:26,171 --> 01:30:31,000
Because the Damn Democrats here,
absolute stupidity abandoned the working

1620
01:30:31,001 --> 01:30:35,380
class who make important to represent 
well,

1621
01:30:35,410 --> 01:30:38,530
it's not good.
They're going to be dispossessed people.

1622
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:43,000
It's going to be a big problem and we 
need to figure out how to solve it.

1623
01:30:43,090 --> 01:30:45,280
And so we need an active laugh.
We need the left.

1624
01:30:45,281 --> 01:30:50,281
It actually stands for not postmodernism
and not daredevil,

1625
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,780
murderous,
reprehensible.

1626
01:30:52,810 --> 01:30:55,570
Marxism like that has to go

1627
01:30:56,590 --> 01:31:01,590
[inaudible]

1628
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:11,760
Rodney Times attracting Nazis.
It doesn't seem to be terrific,

1629
01:31:20,660 --> 01:31:23,360
but in any case,
that's an accusation,

1630
01:31:23,361 --> 01:31:24,194
that's b level.
But here's something strange at 

1631
01:31:28,970 --> 01:31:29,781
mcmaster.
You know,

1632
01:31:29,781 --> 01:31:32,780
there's that big demonstration against 
me and uh,

1633
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:35,600
there's of students there,
maybe they were students,

1634
01:31:35,601 --> 01:31:37,430
they were professional protest,
your gripes.

1635
01:31:37,910 --> 01:31:38,743
And if they were students,
they haven't been educated by the 

1636
01:31:41,351 --> 01:31:46,351
professors
doctor into what's essentially a call.

1637
01:31:47,050 --> 01:31:51,650
And they showed up with a big banner.
It had a hammer and sickle on.

1638
01:31:52,970 --> 01:31:54,080
It's like,
what the hell?

1639
01:31:54,980 --> 01:31:55,870
No,
I'm serious.

1640
01:31:55,871 --> 01:31:58,700
Like this is not funny.
It's not funny.

1641
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:02,830
The circle was mostly used to cut off 
people's heads.

1642
01:32:04,110 --> 01:32:06,750
What are in the 20th century was no 
cocktail and chill.

1643
01:32:07,620 --> 01:32:10,200
Yeah.
You still got North Korea to deal with.

1644
01:32:10,510 --> 01:32:12,010
Oh,
that wasn't real communism.

1645
01:32:13,510 --> 01:32:14,630
Oh,
your city is,

1646
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:15,553
well,
you see plenty of examples of real 

1647
01:32:16,361 --> 01:32:17,194
communism,
so I would say you'd have to tell them 

1648
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:20,113
university circumstance,
I'll problem because people will know 

1649
01:32:22,571 --> 01:32:26,950
more dare to go and do a protest without
blood hammer and sickle,

1650
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:29,740
the name of the gear to go in a Nazi 
uniform.

1651
01:32:31,020 --> 01:32:31,853
What do you mean by social scientists in
universities identified themselves as 

1652
01:32:36,401 --> 01:32:37,840
Marxists.
It's like,

1653
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:42,880
why the hell is that acceptable?
What does it take for us to learn?

1654
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:46,780
Or obviously a couple of you,
your desk and the Cold War,

1655
01:32:47,530 --> 01:32:49,570
nuclear thermal,
nuclear annihilation,

1656
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:52,540
while one is

1657
01:32:55,390 --> 01:32:56,223
anyways,

1658
01:33:00,530 --> 01:33:01,363
oh,
mnemonics calling investigations that 

1659
01:33:02,241 --> 01:33:03,074
I've done trying to get to the bottom 
have indicated to me that there's 

1660
01:33:08,690 --> 01:33:12,080
something to the notion of being eternal
human soul.

1661
01:33:12,410 --> 01:33:15,590
Now you'd called a metaphor if you want.
That's fine.

1662
01:33:15,700 --> 01:33:16,371
Matt,
for us,

1663
01:33:16,371 --> 01:33:18,700
turn out to be extraordinarily powerful 
days.

1664
01:33:20,390 --> 01:33:22,970
How is this sold?
Conceptualized?

1665
01:33:23,990 --> 01:33:27,880
Conceptualized is either prophetic 
voice,

1666
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:33,140
so [inaudible] Jewish conceptualization 
or as the logos and what is that?

1667
01:33:34,430 --> 01:33:35,263
Well,
it's the voice that restructures in 

1668
01:33:38,060 --> 01:33:38,893
equitable social societies.
That's the prophetic voice that makes 

1669
01:33:42,161 --> 01:33:45,740
the horse,
that transforms the chaos of potential,

1670
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:46,633
which is everywhere around us,
into Howard Bloom order in which that 

1671
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:55,270
soul manifests itself.
So the society,

1672
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:57,890
we can be guided by it.
This term,

1673
01:33:58,610 --> 01:33:59,443
all through communication,
term free speech limitation on that is 

1674
01:34:05,241 --> 01:34:06,074
to put a limitation,
I would say on the Holy Spirit itself 

1675
01:34:10,610 --> 01:34:13,870
and not the sin that cannot be forgiven.

1676
01:34:14,790 --> 01:34:15,360
Okay.

1677
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:20,360
And so why would say wait,
stop allowing people to do this.

1678
01:34:24,580 --> 01:34:28,950
Then you don't remember.
No one's brandon left,

1679
01:34:29,260 --> 01:34:31,010
right?
Whatever

1680
01:34:32,750 --> 01:34:33,583
you can possibly do is dependent on your
ability to communicate what you believe 

1681
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:44,480
as clearly as possible.
It's your holy duty to do that.

1682
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:50,320
And anyone who interferes with that
interferes with the proper on the phone.

1683
01:34:51,401 --> 01:34:56,401
We going to be,
it's up and it's a catastrophe.

1684
01:34:57,660 --> 01:34:58,493
Have

1685
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:04,120
universities in shed and the humanities 
specifically are the worst offenders.

1686
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:13,840
Thank [inaudible] uh,
I don't actually have a question.

1687
01:36:11,271 --> 01:36:12,104
I was just wondering if you could 
comment on kind of the before and after 

1688
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,960
of your life from the point where video 
games,

1689
01:36:17,961 --> 01:36:21,330
political correctness,
you just want to tell a little anecdote,

1690
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:25,970
a little story about
the vortex.

1691
01:36:25,971 --> 01:36:30,971
You got sucked into
the first part.

1692
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:39,130
Mostly it's surreal.
It was

1693
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:48,180
surreal.
Oh,

1694
01:36:48,350 --> 01:36:53,120
first of all,
these videos as upset,

1695
01:36:53,330 --> 01:36:56,020
I need to
design

1696
01:36:57,820 --> 01:37:02,820
apps to church people,
the Apple Watch things at the same time

1697
01:37:09,110 --> 01:37:09,943
I started to toy with youtube because I 
have a little bit of exposure on public 

1698
01:37:14,201 --> 01:37:19,201
health issue for Ontario and they get a 
from the course.

1699
01:37:19,730 --> 01:37:20,563
Um,
and so I put those on youtube and you 

1700
01:37:23,151 --> 01:37:24,740
know,
people watch them a little bit.

1701
01:37:24,741 --> 01:37:26,970
And then I started from my lectures on 
the two of them.

1702
01:37:27,380 --> 01:37:28,213
I thought that was cool school,
crappy videos and that sort of thing 

1703
01:37:33,741 --> 01:37:34,574
through,
which was,

1704
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:38,270
you know,
it's a Frankenstein Monster,

1705
01:37:38,271 --> 01:37:39,104
like
[inaudible] [inaudible] set up my 

1706
01:37:43,261 --> 01:37:44,094
patriarch accounting because I was 
curious about how cruel people can 

1707
01:37:46,251 --> 01:37:47,084
monetize their products.
And Patriarchal seems like the 

1708
01:37:48,611 --> 01:37:51,310
electricity thing.
So I thought I'd explore it.

1709
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:55,370
Best thing to do with that is to get 
involved in all

1710
01:37:58,690 --> 01:38:03,480
views over three years.
And I had about 10,000 subscribers.

1711
01:38:03,481 --> 01:38:05,250
We were talking,
you know us a lot.

1712
01:38:05,730 --> 01:38:07,240
That's a long view with a man.
If I sold,

1713
01:38:07,820 --> 01:38:09,900
we sold a million copies and B,
you know,

1714
01:38:09,901 --> 01:38:14,901
I can do touchdown dances in that.
You would catch that with dances,

1715
01:38:15,090 --> 01:38:16,290
ecstasy.
You never see.

1716
01:38:20,520 --> 01:38:24,260
And so
in September,

1717
01:38:24,270 --> 01:38:28,470
October I be picking on political 
correctness for quite a while back,

1718
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:31,680
I was writing a book which is going to 
be published in February.

1719
01:38:31,681 --> 01:38:36,480
It's called 12 the 12 things everyone 
don't hope for life.

1720
01:38:36,750 --> 01:38:39,230
An antidote to chaos.
Okay.

1721
01:38:39,510 --> 01:38:40,343
Coming down from the facility,
one of those jobs it's called chapters 

1722
01:38:43,321 --> 01:38:44,154
in that book is called [inaudible].
The children that they're skateboarding 

1723
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:51,380
and it's all political correctness and 
it's always obsessing me.

1724
01:38:51,461 --> 01:38:52,800
Cause if you know,
since you get into that,

1725
01:38:52,801 --> 01:38:55,910
it's just takes over your life.
And uh,

1726
01:38:56,580 --> 01:38:58,810
I got news,
how would this bill see?

1727
01:38:58,850 --> 01:38:59,683
16 then I investigated it.
I also had a couple of clinical clients 

1728
01:39:03,571 --> 01:39:04,404
would be drinking beyond your limit of 
tolerance by politically correct people 

1729
01:39:07,351 --> 01:39:09,470
in your workplace.
Who are really harassing the hell out of

1730
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:13,980
the name of sensible people.
And so all of that working together when

1731
01:39:13,981 --> 01:39:18,981
I thought I was not sleeping one night 
and I can either write it or I could get

1732
01:39:19,330 --> 01:39:20,163
video,
how to make video and see if like my 

1733
01:39:21,791 --> 01:39:23,760
cell phone,
it goes to this political practice,

1734
01:39:23,770 --> 01:39:24,603
your university and also just what's 
going to make it mandatory for their 

1735
01:39:28,201 --> 01:39:29,010
human resources.

1736
01:39:29,010 --> 01:39:33,450
People to either go auntie unconscious 
bias training,

1737
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:38,600
which I think is reprehensible.
And so I've made one video tell me about

1738
01:39:40,770 --> 01:39:41,603
why I thought bill CC scheme is 
dangerous and that we maybe have one 

1739
01:39:43,981 --> 01:39:48,960
vote antivirus trig and unconscious bias
and uh,

1740
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:50,073
you know,
then I was a little clearer and I 

1741
01:39:52,230 --> 01:39:55,570
thinking and I thought that was that.
Well,

1742
01:39:55,780 --> 01:39:56,960
you know,
listen to people who watched it.

1743
01:39:57,900 --> 01:39:58,880
That's your job to feature.

1744
01:40:01,950 --> 01:40:06,950
And then it's been a tornado since then 
and some of it's great.

1745
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:11,550
Like this is great.
Some of it's not so great,

1746
01:40:12,300 --> 01:40:16,320
you know,
it was very worrisome or being for about

1747
01:40:16,321 --> 01:40:17,154
two months.
Mostly I would say on behalf of my 

1748
01:40:18,451 --> 01:40:23,451
family because
my job was in Germany,

1749
01:40:24,490 --> 01:40:25,323
right?
Severes here I got my two warning 

1750
01:40:27,031 --> 01:40:29,220
letters from the university which were 
full of lies.

1751
01:40:29,470 --> 01:40:30,303
Most of the admissions,
admissions with truth and I know how 

1752
01:40:34,530 --> 01:40:37,170
companies,
corporations and she's fired people.

1753
01:40:37,171 --> 01:40:40,470
They send three letters of warning and 
then if they take action,

1754
01:40:40,770 --> 01:40:41,603
that's what they were doing going down 
the hr tactic and then which they were 

1755
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:46,313
continually going down except that I 
know about the support and so what 

1756
01:40:51,031 --> 01:40:52,610
happened to begin with was the 
journalists,

1757
01:40:52,670 --> 01:40:53,503
they didn't and a good guy,
but some of them actually read the 

1758
01:41:00,011 --> 01:41:03,180
material while I was waiting on my baby 
and thought,

1759
01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:05,800
oh,
he's actually just telling people what's

1760
01:41:05,801 --> 01:41:08,680
actually in the legislation and they 
were journalists

1761
01:41:10,870 --> 01:41:13,960
who handed it to be more conservative 
about free speech.

1762
01:41:14,140 --> 01:41:14,973
Then rose and so going to watch the 
journey was started after you my 

1763
01:41:18,761 --> 01:41:19,594
favorite and then the social justice 
warriors play their role because they 

1764
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:24,160
came up with a free speech rally and 
again,

1765
01:41:24,230 --> 01:41:28,800
a variety of cinematically
describing that's

1766
01:41:31,030 --> 01:41:34,230
not strategically viable phase.

1767
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:41,333
This is quite educated.
I wouldn't say cynical and dark heart 

1768
01:41:46,441 --> 01:41:51,070
rate every time that as social justice 
warriors you cannot me,

1769
01:41:51,550 --> 01:41:54,610
all I have to do is stand back 
[inaudible] himself.

1770
01:41:55,710 --> 01:41:59,270
I was somewhat confusing,
although expressing no get faster

1771
01:42:02,010 --> 01:42:04,090
tobacco.
There's a good example of that.

1772
01:42:04,190 --> 01:42:05,023
Like I could just sit back and let
the performance of her because I knew 

1773
01:42:12,201 --> 01:42:13,034
that a very large number of people that 
watch it and it was a very large number 

1774
01:42:16,421 --> 01:42:17,860
of people did it.
And so like

1775
01:42:19,870 --> 01:42:22,700
great.
I

1776
01:42:27,490 --> 01:42:30,930
most of the rest of it is just surreal.
I know I do words.

1777
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:32,813
Um,
I don't really have any idea what's 

1778
01:42:34,541 --> 01:42:35,374
happening.

1779
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:40,690
It's very difficult for me to pick the 
proper level of analysis.

1780
01:42:40,870 --> 01:42:44,800
I do real deep at the fundamental level 
of analysis.

1781
01:42:45,350 --> 01:42:48,640
There's the social movements at the 
deepest levels feel about,

1782
01:42:48,820 --> 01:42:49,653
but I still talking about
what's happening in Alaska somewhere 

1783
01:42:53,291 --> 01:42:56,320
between philosophical and theological.
Um,

1784
01:42:57,640 --> 01:42:58,473
we're in a moment of crisis.
The things can go either way and I'm 

1785
01:43:02,531 --> 01:43:03,364
hoping that they go through traffic and 
I'm hoping that what I'm doing is 

1786
01:43:09,010 --> 01:43:12,820
facilitating that turned to be very 
careful with what I say.

1787
01:43:13,200 --> 01:43:17,440
And,
and

1788
01:43:19,690 --> 01:43:24,280
then the close is the,
I decided a long time ago that there,

1789
01:43:24,460 --> 01:43:25,293
I learned a long time ago that there are
two ways of forgiving yourself through 

1790
01:43:27,710 --> 01:43:32,710
like why you,
you decide that you want use your layers

1791
01:43:34,271 --> 01:43:35,104
to get it.
That's a lot better than not doing 

1792
01:43:36,851 --> 01:43:40,090
anything.
This is the critical year into like,

1793
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:43,420
except that's not going to use your 
language to get what you want.

1794
01:43:45,550 --> 01:43:47,220
Okay,
here's another,

1795
01:43:48,070 --> 01:43:53,070
you'd use your language to state what 
you observe and decentralized as clearly

1796
01:43:55,881 --> 01:44:00,290
as you possibly can and let whatever is 
going to have.

1797
01:44:01,460 --> 01:44:02,293
So that's what I tried to.
So this is all what's happened and 

1798
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:08,083
fundamentally it's okay with me because 
already decided that whatever the 

1799
01:44:11,271 --> 01:44:14,240
outcome was of doing that was going to 
be okay.

1800
01:44:15,610 --> 01:44:16,443
It's an act of faith.
It's Dick after faith action because 

1801
01:44:19,551 --> 01:44:22,460
you've decided that the world run better
on truth or false.

1802
01:44:22,810 --> 01:44:23,643
If you're going to stand on truth,
that's a decision that you speak the 

1803
01:44:27,231 --> 01:44:30,680
truth and you let the cards fall where 
they fall.

1804
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:36,280
And so I was watching where they fall 
and I'm trying to stay intact and so far

1805
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:45,380
it's working.
So thank God

1806
01:44:47,130 --> 01:44:52,130
Eric.
[inaudible]

1807
01:44:56,710 --> 01:45:01,130
yeah,
maybe we could go,

1808
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:02,533
let's,
let's make it a little bit though 

1809
01:45:03,150 --> 01:45:05,000
because people want to know what the 
hell's going on.

1810
01:45:05,001 --> 01:45:08,260
So how about 20 hours but time is it,
it's almost like,

1811
01:45:09,050 --> 01:45:09,883
okay,
how about 20 after is that I'm doing 

1812
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:12,153
okay cause I won't be intelligible after
with open dialogue between the only 

1813
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:23,800
thing that helps keep communication 
between could do to get a few clients.

1814
01:45:24,920 --> 01:45:29,100
How do you connect the people who are 
cleaning certain ways to find,

1815
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:31,873
okay,
well first of all I wouldn't say that 

1816
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:35,570
necessarily come down,
right?

1817
01:45:35,780 --> 01:45:39,590
So there's an analogous problem in 
clinical psychology,

1818
01:45:39,770 --> 01:45:40,603
which is how,
what do you do to help someone who 

1819
01:45:42,411 --> 01:45:45,500
doesn't want to be helpful and answer?
It's,

1820
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:49,100
I could use a new guest of quote against
that.

1821
01:45:49,101 --> 01:45:52,460
It's another harsh one.
Don't cast pearls before swine.

1822
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:56,120
I took me a long time just going to 
escape.

1823
01:45:57,530 --> 01:46:00,410
And what it means is that you deem 
valuable.

1824
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:04,340
What's valuable by offering it to people
who will not appreciate.

1825
01:46:05,870 --> 01:46:06,703
If you can engage to Donald's a summer 
and go find someone that you can engage 

1826
01:46:10,780 --> 01:46:13,550
with and maybe,
and you might say,

1827
01:46:13,551 --> 01:46:15,290
well what about those people?
And I would say,

1828
01:46:15,291 --> 01:46:16,124
what the best thing to do with them,
the first day of the series you live in 

1829
01:46:21,771 --> 01:46:22,604
again and burry the desk.
And the second answer is the only way 

1830
01:46:27,021 --> 01:46:32,021
that you get a person a self if I can 
help is by example.

1831
01:46:33,860 --> 01:46:37,430
So you'll walk away from people you 
cannot communicate with,

1832
01:46:38,050 --> 01:46:38,883
you,
communicate with people who you can 

1833
01:46:39,861 --> 01:46:44,090
communicate with and you try to put your
life in the water and then,

1834
01:46:45,710 --> 01:46:49,800
and then you hope that some of the wake 
up and some of the well,

1835
01:46:50,550 --> 01:46:52,670
so.
Yep.

1836
01:46:54,330 --> 01:46:58,070
[inaudible]

1837
01:47:00,930 --> 01:47:03,300
thank you very much for your speech 
tonight is fantastic.

1838
01:47:03,810 --> 01:47:06,180
Um,
my question was dre simple.

1839
01:47:06,240 --> 01:47:07,073
Um,
it has to do with your crowd funding 

1840
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:10,853
academic research,
which we recently did on Coco for 

1841
01:47:13,980 --> 01:47:15,510
earlier,
I believe it said,

1842
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:21,560
and you raised more than doubles so far.
Your original goal is now $162,000,

1843
01:47:22,921 --> 01:47:24,840
which is amazing.
Um,

1844
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:27,630
and I hope the organizers of this event,
we'll post the links,

1845
01:47:27,660 --> 01:47:30,720
we can get more money.
But if your question is,

1846
01:47:30,870 --> 01:47:35,870
this is the first time I've ever seen a 
university research funded by the public

1847
01:47:36,540 --> 01:47:40,320
at large as opposed to through one of 
the Canadian research councils,

1848
01:47:40,321 --> 01:47:41,154
which usually are,
there's a community and there's a 

1849
01:47:42,211 --> 01:47:43,044
different process.
To me it seems like it's precedent 

1850
01:47:45,121 --> 01:47:46,820
setting is not willing.
Right.

1851
01:47:46,910 --> 01:47:49,010
How would you think this will change the
pattern,

1852
01:47:49,340 --> 01:47:51,180
uh,
research funding in Canada?

1853
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:52,700
Well,
that's a good question.

1854
01:47:52,701 --> 01:47:53,534
I mean,
one of the things I haven't talked 

1855
01:47:55,460 --> 01:47:56,530
about,
first of all,

1856
01:47:56,531 --> 01:47:58,540
if that's how I'm my campaign,
right?

1857
01:47:58,820 --> 01:48:02,990
It's the real community is now they 
asked me if they could run it and I said

1858
01:48:02,991 --> 01:48:04,370
yes,
but I,

1859
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:09,080
I don't believe I would've done it on my
own because it seemed like,

1860
01:48:15,610 --> 01:48:16,443
what did it seem like?
It seems in some sense by capitalizing 

1861
01:48:19,481 --> 01:48:22,370
on misfortune know and so,
so anyway,

1862
01:48:22,371 --> 01:48:23,890
so they did it.
I'm happy about that.

1863
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:24,873
But when they decided to do it,
I talked to a number of people that I 

1864
01:48:27,431 --> 01:48:30,850
know about what this could conceivably 
me.

1865
01:48:30,910 --> 01:48:31,743
And one of the things that we thought 
about was setting up a system whereby 

1866
01:48:36,130 --> 01:48:37,960
other professors could do the same 
thing.

1867
01:48:37,961 --> 01:48:40,140
I've been researchers,
no doors,

1868
01:48:40,150 --> 01:48:40,983
some sites like set up,
I think there's one called the spear 

1869
01:48:42,740 --> 01:48:43,573
mint.com I passed right by the way,
but it does fine with these sorts of 

1870
01:48:47,171 --> 01:48:48,390
things.
Um,

1871
01:48:49,170 --> 01:48:50,003
it might be worth investigating whether 
this is say a reasonable and Broccoli 

1872
01:48:55,030 --> 01:48:55,863
precedent,
but it isn't obvious to me that I have 

1873
01:48:57,821 --> 01:49:00,580
the time to investigate that old enough 
to figure out how to do it.

1874
01:49:00,910 --> 01:49:03,520
And that's part of what I'm trying to 
figure out right now.

1875
01:49:03,610 --> 01:49:04,443
So I'm going to be talking to people 
over the next couple of months in all 

1876
01:49:06,940 --> 01:49:08,770
likelihood.
I have some,

1877
01:49:09,010 --> 01:49:09,843
some supporters who are reasonably well 
capitalized and they are interested in 

1878
01:49:16,120 --> 01:49:18,220
working to allow that sort of thing to 
happen.

1879
01:49:18,820 --> 01:49:20,710
But it's very complicated.
I am,

1880
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:22,113
I'm already walking by and so I know the
answer is I don't know what sort of 

1881
01:49:26,050 --> 01:49:28,960
precedent and step.
I do know that it's going to keep,

1882
01:49:28,990 --> 01:49:31,690
my graduate students were waiting for 
the next three years.

1883
01:49:32,050 --> 01:49:35,900
So with any luck I'll apply for another 
grant this fall and yet,

1884
01:49:35,950 --> 01:49:38,600
and then I'll have more money than I 
would that would be funding.

1885
01:49:38,680 --> 01:49:39,513
So I hope that,

1886
01:49:48,020 --> 01:49:48,853
uh,
I'd like to thank you for posting your 

1887
01:49:51,401 --> 01:49:54,290
videos.
The lectures on the young and archetypes

1888
01:49:54,310 --> 01:49:57,130
president of the lion king is worthwhile
if anyone's interested.

1889
01:49:57,910 --> 01:50:01,510
My question though is about the limits 
and restrictions on free speech.

1890
01:50:01,780 --> 01:50:05,500
So honestly we're opposed to anyone who 
wants to restrict free speech.

1891
01:50:05,501 --> 01:50:06,334
However,
how do we deal with issues like death 

1892
01:50:08,021 --> 01:50:11,290
threats or dishonest or pernicious to 
advertise?

1893
01:50:12,190 --> 01:50:13,023
Yeah.
Well are you saying we've already dealt 

1894
01:50:13,991 --> 01:50:16,240
with that pretty nicely.
Like there are,

1895
01:50:16,270 --> 01:50:18,730
there are limits to coerce a speech to 
the be,

1896
01:50:18,970 --> 01:50:21,440
I think he was home law actually has 
dealt with that very,

1897
01:50:21,441 --> 01:50:23,620
we see I'm a great admirer of English 
common law,

1898
01:50:23,830 --> 01:50:26,290
English common wise and the whole legal 
system.

1899
01:50:26,291 --> 01:50:27,690
Right.
So just so you know,

1900
01:50:27,700 --> 01:50:28,533
cause you should've jumped because our 
legal system is to come follow it up by 

1901
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:33,790
me.
What would you call it?

1902
01:50:33,820 --> 01:50:34,653
Intro mission of French civil law 
precepts into the English common law 

1903
01:50:38,051 --> 01:50:40,630
system,
which is catastrophe in my estimation.

1904
01:50:40,870 --> 01:50:41,703
Under English common law,
you have all the rights there are and 

1905
01:50:44,741 --> 01:50:47,470
are granted to you by the government you
have.

1906
01:50:48,280 --> 01:50:49,113
And then what's happening in English on 
laws when you have some rights and 

1907
01:50:51,510 --> 01:50:53,800
rights,
common had scrapped because you know,

1908
01:50:53,860 --> 01:50:56,350
you don't know where one right ends the 
other who begins.

1909
01:50:56,440 --> 01:50:57,273
And so then we gave each other the court
and then the court decides roughly 

1910
01:50:59,801 --> 01:51:00,634
speaking where the line should be drawn 
and then the law of builds organically 

1911
01:51:03,791 --> 01:51:06,270
across content.
And how do we,

1912
01:51:06,280 --> 01:51:10,900
now that it's come up with all sorts of,
we could call the limitations on,

1913
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:11,913
I wouldn't say free speech precisely 
because I don't really believe that 

1914
01:51:14,261 --> 01:51:15,760
that's what they are,
but I'm like,

1915
01:51:15,761 --> 01:51:18,670
you can't outrun death threats.
So,

1916
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:19,593
and I guess it's partly the paradoxical 
situation where sometimes what you're 

1917
01:51:23,021 --> 01:51:23,854
doing with your free speech is 
interfering with the continuation of 

1918
01:51:27,041 --> 01:51:30,220
free speech,
in which case you should be saw.

1919
01:51:30,270 --> 01:51:31,780
It's something like that.
And so,

1920
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:32,673
you know,
there should be limits on seditious 

1921
01:51:34,511 --> 01:51:38,080
speech of some sort because that's 
treasonable speech.

1922
01:51:38,081 --> 01:51:38,914
You know?
And I guess if what you're doing is 

1923
01:51:40,841 --> 01:51:41,674
oriented towards demolishing the 
structure upon which your own freedom 

1924
01:51:46,031 --> 01:51:49,360
depends,
then something has to be there has to be

1925
01:51:49,361 --> 01:51:51,610
eliminated.
Now where did evidence should be?

1926
01:51:51,640 --> 01:51:55,200
Well that's a tough one but that's,
but a lot of that card would be seven.

1927
01:51:55,230 --> 01:51:56,063
You know,
there's lots of things you can't ever 

1928
01:51:57,210 --> 01:52:00,160
get France you can incite to criminal 
activity,

1929
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:02,800
right?
And you can't blatantly lie if you are a

1930
01:52:02,801 --> 01:52:06,900
commercial vendor,
in fact been tobacco for example.

1931
01:52:06,901 --> 01:52:09,640
And it has to be certain in the Supreme 
Court and your ass,

1932
01:52:09,820 --> 01:52:13,900
you have to put warnings on your tobacco
product that's compelled speech,

1933
01:52:13,901 --> 01:52:14,734
which was what I was objecting to.
It feel see 16 but outside of the 

1934
01:52:17,261 --> 01:52:22,261
commercial domain there hasn't been any 
attempt to compel speech.

1935
01:52:22,691 --> 01:52:26,380
And that's how it should.
So I think those things have to agree to

1936
01:52:26,381 --> 01:52:30,190
be dealt with on a case by case basis 
because the devil's in the details.

1937
01:52:30,340 --> 01:52:31,173
And that's also why English common law,
such a staggeringly brilliant 

1938
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:38,350
contribution to world culture.
And you know,

1939
01:52:38,380 --> 01:52:39,820
if you want to think,
well,

1940
01:52:39,821 --> 01:52:41,260
is there any of your collectors for 
that?

1941
01:52:41,261 --> 01:52:42,490
It's like,
yeah.

1942
01:52:42,790 --> 01:52:46,070
Most countries that we're founded on 
English

1943
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:51,070
common law are rich
in the Americas.

1944
01:52:51,710 --> 01:52:55,170
Founded my friends core funded by 
Portugal ports,

1945
01:52:55,290 --> 01:52:56,123
founded by Por [inaudible] rich.
So any sligo structure now that's my 

1946
01:53:02,190 --> 01:53:04,060
home was a great book,
Huh?

1947
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:08,950
What was it called?
The wealth and poverty of nations.

1948
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:11,800
It was written by a Harvard professor 
who analyzed,

1949
01:53:11,980 --> 01:53:12,813
he was very generous about why some 
countries in the Americas we were 

1950
01:53:14,561 --> 01:53:15,394
pouring,
some are rich because they all have 

1951
01:53:16,481 --> 01:53:19,030
natural resources,
what's going on.

1952
01:53:19,510 --> 01:53:21,460
And so,
and then other countries like Japan,

1953
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:23,033
you know,
we need the resources and the rich are 

1954
01:53:28,120 --> 01:53:28,953
functioning.
Legal System said is the ultimate 

1955
01:53:30,580 --> 01:53:33,990
attachment resources.
So it was becoming an yep.

1956
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:39,520
[inaudible]

1957
01:53:40,450 --> 01:53:45,320
this relates to Sam Harris has been set.
We will like it,

1958
01:53:45,350 --> 01:53:46,850
but I'm just gonna go with it if you 
don't mind.

1959
01:53:47,820 --> 01:53:50,300
Uh,
so why can't be subjective?

1960
01:53:50,360 --> 01:53:51,350
I,
you know,

1961
01:53:51,351 --> 01:53:54,620
luther and still fit into your 
methodological perspective.

1962
01:53:57,090 --> 01:53:59,880
Well see the thing about a question like
that,

1963
01:53:59,950 --> 01:54:00,783
this is the truth.
This is the truth about any question 

1964
01:54:03,511 --> 01:54:08,280
like that.
When you say is a equivalent to be,

1965
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:12,520
the answer is it depends on how you 
define it in your hands.

1966
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:15,920
Now you'd find you'd be like,
it's a weasel answer in some sense,

1967
01:54:15,921 --> 01:54:16,754
but it's actually the correct answer 
because I can't answer that question 

1968
01:54:19,611 --> 01:54:20,444
without knowing what you specifically 
mean by illusion and specifically 

1969
01:54:25,941 --> 01:54:30,410
meaning about the subject.
Now and I would also say the question is

1970
01:54:30,690 --> 01:54:35,690
not that I didn't call because
they are referring to is not homogenous.

1971
01:54:36,231 --> 01:54:39,620
It's heterogeneous
of eyes,

1972
01:54:40,230 --> 01:54:41,220
you know,
radiation,

1973
01:54:41,450 --> 01:54:42,283
something like harvey was something like
a unity after call and some of that of 

1974
01:54:47,990 --> 01:54:48,823
yours in some sense a losery.
Did he get in the same way that the 

1975
01:54:54,321 --> 01:54:56,530
desktop on your computer isn't an 
illusion.

1976
01:54:56,531 --> 01:54:59,690
The representation of the actual 
computational processes,

1977
01:55:01,400 --> 01:55:03,260
it's more illusory.
It its function.

1978
01:55:05,060 --> 01:55:07,150
If you're thinking about illusion as 
some,

1979
01:55:07,370 --> 01:55:08,203
you see you have to define the physical 
arena in which you were formulating the 

1980
01:55:11,931 --> 01:55:12,860
concepts before.

1981
01:55:12,860 --> 01:55:14,490
We could have a proper discussion of 
that.

1982
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:15,553
Now that I would say the simple truth 
that Ari and here too is that 

1983
01:55:23,510 --> 01:55:28,510
civilizations that act as if human 
beings have freewill seem to work.

1984
01:55:30,530 --> 01:55:33,710
Now that's a pragmatic didn't habits,
right?

1985
01:55:33,790 --> 01:55:34,623
Sounds scientific,
but I'm a pragmatist so that is pretty 

1986
01:55:37,401 --> 01:55:41,270
far from me.
And so from a shorthand perspective,

1987
01:55:41,271 --> 01:55:42,104
I would say
if something is functional and it's 

1988
01:55:45,631 --> 01:55:46,464
based on the particular first principle,
the first principle is true enough and 

1989
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:52,913
that's where I think about free will and
not sort of thing about the idea of the 

1990
01:55:54,811 --> 01:55:58,050
soul.
Now I'm not saying that constitutes that

1991
01:55:58,070 --> 01:56:01,410
exhaustive analysis of freewill core of 
the soul.

1992
01:56:01,590 --> 01:56:02,423
It is,
but it's a good first pass 

1993
01:56:04,771 --> 01:56:09,771
approximation.
[inaudible]

1994
01:56:14,360 --> 01:56:16,080
um,
I saw him on your q and a's.

1995
01:56:16,120 --> 01:56:19,800
I hope this isn't too unrelated but it's
probably what we keep it lighter.

1996
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:20,753
Um,
you said that you're a big fan of a 

1997
01:56:22,501 --> 01:56:27,501
guilty pleasure for trailer park boys,
a brief sort of article,

1998
01:56:33,930 --> 01:56:37,050
well your hair characters and maybe the 
tie back to free speech.

1999
01:56:37,051 --> 01:56:42,051
How a show that is so crude and 
offensive managers to be making the most

2000
01:56:42,250 --> 01:56:43,083
positive

2001
01:56:51,310 --> 01:56:56,310
here.
Um,

2002
01:57:03,200 --> 01:57:08,200
well I'm from northern Alberta.
I don't know if you know the movie.

2003
01:57:08,810 --> 01:57:10,830
Um,
rhubarb.

2004
01:57:14,260 --> 01:57:17,600
I went foobar it's actually about the 
people that I grew up with.

2005
01:57:18,620 --> 01:57:23,060
Pete to some degree having us watch for 
the border

2006
01:57:24,650 --> 01:57:25,483
probably eight years ago because they 
have one of my old friends and we were 

2007
01:57:31,160 --> 01:57:34,670
scared of swatches.
You know,

2008
01:57:35,170 --> 01:57:37,610
I,
there's something about,

2009
01:57:37,670 --> 01:57:40,790
I went to the class guys,
I think they're fighting,

2010
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:42,710
they have great senses of humor and 
something,

2011
01:57:42,711 --> 01:57:43,544
I read this,
one of the ways the working class guys 

2012
01:57:45,771 --> 01:57:50,160
compete is through observing
for restaurants.

2013
01:57:50,230 --> 01:57:54,680
I heard lots of rough places,
rail crews and that sort of thing.

2014
01:57:55,110 --> 01:57:58,370
And what keeps guys alive in situations 
like that?

2015
01:57:58,371 --> 01:58:02,360
Is there a certain sense of humor and 
the training of our employees is a great

2016
01:58:02,361 --> 01:58:05,510
example that I think it's hilarious that
the Canadian government funds it.

2017
01:58:08,220 --> 01:58:13,220
Yeah.
And this is also the simpsons.

2018
01:58:14,710 --> 01:58:19,710
It's absolutely reprehensible in all of 
its details except for its container,

2019
01:58:22,420 --> 01:58:26,470
the simpsons.
The family is central to this instance,

2020
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:28,200
right?
Well to say about homeowners,

2021
01:58:28,220 --> 01:58:29,310
like loves his family,
who,

2022
01:58:29,370 --> 01:58:30,203
anything for his family and 
fundamentally they're oriented towards 

2023
01:58:33,501 --> 01:58:34,334
each other.
And so it's always a calming because 

2024
01:58:37,250 --> 01:58:40,820
there anyhow.
And so that's what gives best what makes

2025
01:58:40,821 --> 01:58:44,530
the simpsons just mean spirited.
It's not mean spirited.

2026
01:58:44,531 --> 01:58:46,370
It's great.
Saqqara everyone's,

2027
01:58:46,380 --> 01:58:51,380
he held the Joe and the characters are,
are essentially moral and it's the same,

2028
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:58,140
somewhat lesser degree.
It's like,

2029
01:58:58,250 --> 01:59:00,760
because the stories when it's working,
the story is,

2030
01:59:00,761 --> 01:59:03,280
well two things.
It's about impulsive,

2031
01:59:03,700 --> 01:59:08,500
male stupidity,
also friendship.

2032
01:59:09,070 --> 01:59:12,120
And it really is about friendship.
Even the enemies are friends.

2033
01:59:12,460 --> 01:59:13,293
And so the creative subject have done 
this remarkable job of walking the line 

2034
01:59:17,711 --> 01:59:22,240
between satirical,
like English to meet needs.

2035
01:59:22,430 --> 01:59:24,360
It's great car,
but they have,

2036
01:59:24,450 --> 01:59:29,450
they have their characters,
the characters completely reprehensible.

2037
01:59:29,860 --> 01:59:34,380
Right?
So that's part of why I left the street,

2038
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:35,593
goes to Vegas.
I think unbelievably funny because you 

2039
01:59:37,841 --> 01:59:42,140
watch it then have this documentary like
aspect is easy,

2040
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:48,920
but these are real people.
Conky episode down.

2041
02:00:06,260 --> 02:00:11,260
I have a bucket list
to be invited on the trailer park.

2042
02:00:19,680 --> 02:00:20,513
Okay.

2043
02:00:21,080 --> 02:00:23,610
Um,
I just have a question about,

2044
02:00:23,850 --> 02:00:24,683
uh,
your plane's on political belief and 

2045
02:00:28,261 --> 02:00:30,870
direct correlation to big five 
personality.

2046
02:00:31,110 --> 02:00:32,660
Um,
I,

2047
02:00:32,700 --> 02:00:36,780
you mentioned that there's truth ain't 
truth be fighting it out in this between

2048
02:00:36,781 --> 02:00:38,550
the right and the left.
Um,

2049
02:00:38,580 --> 02:00:39,413
what do you mean pass the treaty?
Which is what I see is emerging is the 

2050
02:00:44,131 --> 02:00:47,190
libertarian movement,
which isn't really in either category.

2051
02:00:49,400 --> 02:00:50,233
The first answer is I don't know enough 
about libertarians to say because we 

2052
02:00:54,111 --> 02:00:55,690
haven't been able to sample it off the 
boat.

2053
02:00:55,700 --> 02:01:00,700
You get a sense now I shouldn't say that
the 23 correct types are not causing,

2054
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:02,833
just so everyone knows the biggest 
English or for the politically correct 

2055
02:01:05,721 --> 02:01:07,790
heights is that they're very high in 
agreeableness.

2056
02:01:08,250 --> 02:01:08,861
Anyone say,
well,

2057
02:01:08,861 --> 02:01:11,620
I don't see very
real.

2058
02:01:11,690 --> 02:01:16,160
People are only agreeable to say like,
so if you're in their desk,

2059
02:01:16,510 --> 02:01:17,343
then you're gay.
But if you're outside the nest or a 

2060
02:01:19,461 --> 02:01:22,370
snake and so they're very agreeable 
behaves,

2061
02:01:22,371 --> 02:01:24,320
but they're not very agreeable to 
snakes.

2062
02:01:24,380 --> 02:01:26,540
And most people are snakes.
So,

2063
02:01:27,100 --> 02:01:27,933
so,
but the is my suspicion is that there 

2064
02:01:30,211 --> 02:01:33,080
are high in openness and high in 
conscientiousness.

2065
02:01:33,460 --> 02:01:34,940
I don't know.
I really don't know.

2066
02:01:35,420 --> 02:01:38,330
They may also not be very agreeable 
because they're kind of like,

2067
02:01:38,331 --> 02:01:39,600
leave me the hell times,

2068
02:01:40,030 --> 02:01:41,890
which kind of goes with the sort of 
people that I,

2069
02:01:41,980 --> 02:01:44,520
I'm agreeable,
I'm quite agreeable with the guests.

2070
02:01:45,410 --> 02:01:48,980
I find it really hard,
disagreeable types,

2071
02:01:48,981 --> 02:01:49,814
basically telling him to screw off and 
that can be really useful because that 

2072
02:01:53,180 --> 02:01:58,180
is what you should do.
I suspect that the Libertarians are more

2073
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:00,610
disagreement.
Okay.

2074
02:02:04,050 --> 02:02:07,220
[inaudible]

2075
02:02:09,330 --> 02:02:10,163
ah,
so you expressed some concern about 

2076
02:02:11,630 --> 02:02:14,990
losing your job at University of Toronto
and I was just wondering,

2077
02:02:15,260 --> 02:02:18,680
given that you're picture on income,
excuse my own salary,

2078
02:02:19,960 --> 02:02:20,793
is there a threshold at which you would 
consider resigning and pursuing a 

2079
02:02:23,371 --> 02:02:26,060
youtube just being oppression of youtube
as your primary?

2080
02:02:27,290 --> 02:02:27,891
Well,
you know,

2081
02:02:27,891 --> 02:02:30,170
I thought about that,
but as I said earlier,

2082
02:02:30,171 --> 02:02:31,004
I like to do both things at the same 
time and right now there's no reason to 

2083
02:02:35,001 --> 02:02:36,920
do that.
I have this great

2084
02:02:38,450 --> 02:02:41,260
professor and I should also say on 
behalf of when students like,

2085
02:02:41,270 --> 02:02:42,103
look,
I went back to teach in January and I 

2086
02:02:43,701 --> 02:02:46,940
was not in very good shape.
I have real health crisis in December,

2087
02:02:47,120 --> 02:02:49,640
which I think was unrelated to this.
We're not,

2088
02:02:50,780 --> 02:02:53,420
but I was reading on in good shape and 
I,

2089
02:02:53,720 --> 02:02:54,553
I had been,
it had been recommended to me by my 

2090
02:02:56,961 --> 02:02:57,650
chair.

2091
02:02:57,650 --> 02:02:58,483
I'm not returned to teaching 
independently of what was going on at 

2092
02:03:01,311 --> 02:03:02,890
the university.
There's no damn way.

2093
02:03:03,390 --> 02:03:05,560
I just like,
no,

2094
02:03:05,800 --> 02:03:06,633
I wasn't,
but I wasn't clear to me how much 

2095
02:03:09,110 --> 02:03:11,730
additional stress,
I'm just going to kill the target.

2096
02:03:12,290 --> 02:03:13,123
Or the students were extraordinarily 
well and he knows the students at the 

2097
02:03:17,451 --> 02:03:21,170
university trav and most students,
most of them are kids,

2098
02:03:21,171 --> 02:03:22,620
are first generation immigrants,
right?

2099
02:03:22,621 --> 02:03:23,454
It's like they're on a bloody political 
bandwagons frame from their economic 

2100
02:03:27,171 --> 02:03:31,370
future there post powered by the dreams 
and desires of their parents,

2101
02:03:31,430 --> 02:03:34,540
and I'm working in south down to the 
tailbone.

2102
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:36,320
I'm trying to get her degree in new up 
here.

2103
02:03:36,321 --> 02:03:38,830
It'd be functioning.
And so I liked the undergraduates.

2104
02:03:39,130 --> 02:03:42,410
It a small percentage of it.
Is Paris laws the same?

2105
02:03:42,411 --> 02:03:47,060
Damn,
no.

2106
02:03:52,660 --> 02:03:54,880
I don't even know how many of them are 
students for now.

2107
02:03:55,090 --> 02:03:57,480
And then there's the administrative 
person,

2108
02:03:57,960 --> 02:04:01,120
a fair number of the sites who are 
politically correct,

2109
02:04:01,210 --> 02:04:05,980
but the university itself is actually 
quite conservative in the small sisense.

2110
02:04:06,140 --> 02:04:06,973
Now that's annoying sometimes because 
I'm right radical from a creative 

2111
02:04:10,451 --> 02:04:14,220
perspective.
And so I find we have some constraints,

2112
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:15,393
whatever.
I got nothing to complain about this 

2113
02:04:17,380 --> 02:04:18,700
with the rest of,
it's a highly,

2114
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:20,890
highly privileged job and thrilled to 
have.

2115
02:04:20,930 --> 02:04:24,880
I'm lucky to have it fortunate.
I like teaching young people.

2116
02:04:25,090 --> 02:04:25,923
It's a great privilege to do it.
And so I don't see any reason to stop 

2117
02:04:29,530 --> 02:04:32,860
and I think there can be both.
And so far that's working.

2118
02:04:33,280 --> 02:04:37,860
So as long as the loan,
which is my libertarian aside,

2119
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:38,040
as

2120
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:40,150
long as I left alone by the university 
and my gender,

2121
02:04:40,190 --> 02:04:43,320
yeah.
Then I can have my cake and eat it too.

2122
02:04:43,950 --> 02:04:48,950
And so that's a good deal.
Um,

2123
02:04:53,160 --> 02:04:58,160
so earlier in your speech and you 
mentioned how the length generally

2124
02:05:01,140 --> 02:05:04,890
kind of come to the aid of who they 
perceive at as oppressed.

2125
02:05:04,980 --> 02:05:06,240
Right.
Uh,

2126
02:05:06,270 --> 02:05:09,730
so I kind of view,
uh,

2127
02:05:09,870 --> 02:05:14,010
the rights as being sort of a price on 
the left to myself.

2128
02:05:14,610 --> 02:05:15,443
Uh,
do you think my perception is correct 

2129
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:22,230
and if so,
why do you think that the social justice

2130
02:05:22,231 --> 02:05:25,680
type don't also see it like I did?
Yeah.

2131
02:05:25,681 --> 02:05:26,311
Well,
you know,

2132
02:05:26,311 --> 02:05:27,910
we're in a time of cat,
right?

2133
02:05:27,930 --> 02:05:32,930
Isn't that [inaudible] times things 
reverse in twists and,

2134
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:39,833
and we're in many and I believe that 
where I do believe that that's 

2135
02:05:43,990 --> 02:05:48,990
[inaudible] main process has emerged
is the left or pressing the right,

2136
02:06:00,190 --> 02:06:01,023
I think it's more like the left has 
gained the routing color as being 

2137
02:06:07,270 --> 02:06:08,103
incremental control over many 
institutions as a consequence of 

2138
02:06:12,271 --> 02:06:17,271
inappropriate public subsidy.
So there not that many of them.

2139
02:06:19,850 --> 02:06:24,850
There are whole disciplines that are 
pathologically etiological possess,

2140
02:06:27,020 --> 02:06:27,853
which like the ethnic studies waiting 
studies types where the studies in 

2141
02:06:31,441 --> 02:06:32,274
particular it's complaining of hospital
and increasingly the humanities are 

2142
02:06:37,751 --> 02:06:42,751
being pulled into that vortex that have 
postmodernism two thirds of the way down

2143
02:06:44,411 --> 02:06:45,780
to Marxism.
Underneath that,

2144
02:06:47,160 --> 02:06:48,450
the problem is,
is that

2145
02:06:49,980 --> 02:06:50,813
set up a system where people are,
that orientation can draw a stable cell 

2146
02:06:58,590 --> 02:07:01,470
for decades.
There's thousands of them,

2147
02:07:01,530 --> 02:07:04,950
hundreds of thousands perhaps and do 
nots.

2148
02:07:05,370 --> 02:07:09,600
But we're on what they say demo on which
is the underlining of the patriarchy,

2149
02:07:10,140 --> 02:07:12,210
which is a reprehensible term.
By the way.

2150
02:07:12,270 --> 02:07:13,103
It's a wrongful oversimplification of 
the estate and it's also profoundly the 

2151
02:07:17,221 --> 02:07:18,054
ungrateful because although the 
Patriarchy is an oppressive structure 

2152
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:26,720
obviously because any social community 
requires conformity or it's not a social

2153
02:07:26,731 --> 02:07:27,564
community,
it's also staggered in a productive and 

2154
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:35,530
for example provides them with a degree 
of safety and security.

2155
02:07:35,531 --> 02:07:36,364
This unthinkable.
Well they pursued their fifth call 

2156
02:07:41,221 --> 02:07:45,310
agenda.
We've got to stop.

2157
02:07:46,120 --> 02:07:49,490
It's not acceptable and the way we 
started in parties,

2158
02:07:49,900 --> 02:07:53,450
Harrods,
don't let your children take you.

2159
02:07:53,451 --> 02:07:54,284
Never of course

2160
02:07:55,810 --> 02:08:00,810
[inaudible].

2161
02:08:03,380 --> 02:08:05,780
One of the things that I've been 
thinking about doing this,

2162
02:08:07,210 --> 02:08:09,500
and this would be a great crowd source 
project.

2163
02:08:09,790 --> 02:08:10,623
I would like to make up a technical,
if I can do a technical analysis of 

2164
02:08:16,480 --> 02:08:21,480
postmodern slash Marxist slash social 
justice terminology,

2165
02:08:21,711 --> 02:08:26,110
you'd be working on that already.
And then great course descriptions,

2166
02:08:26,390 --> 02:08:30,460
how of course descriptions raging fires 
and publish them.

2167
02:08:31,170 --> 02:08:32,003
And so then with brain corridor,
universities and colleges by social 

2168
02:08:35,621 --> 02:08:36,454
justice infiltration and to do this and 
that and produce a manual for parents 

2169
02:08:42,371 --> 02:08:43,204
and high school students that would say 
who not to take courses in which horses 

2170
02:08:47,651 --> 02:08:48,484
and you avoid because I think that 
starving them out is the right approach 

2171
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:55,480
and it's going to be difficult because 
they'll take your,

2172
02:08:56,270 --> 02:09:00,940
and I've been an admirer of 10 but the 
system's gone sideways,

2173
02:09:00,950 --> 02:09:02,910
that there was a way of exploiting it 
and,

2174
02:09:02,911 --> 02:09:04,540
and,
and it's being exploited.

2175
02:09:04,600 --> 02:09:05,433
I mean the,
I don't know how many of you guys fall 

2176
02:09:07,141 --> 02:09:07,974
real peer review cat.
I would recommend that one player that 

2177
02:09:11,261 --> 02:09:15,100
you want to see what the pathological 
humor,

2178
02:09:15,190 --> 02:09:16,023
these spoilers are up to you as soon as 
described the real peer review and it's 

2179
02:09:20,981 --> 02:09:23,290
like you,
it's,

2180
02:09:23,620 --> 02:09:28,320
it's far more observant than to on
so,

2181
02:09:29,260 --> 02:09:34,260
so I don't remember what your question
basically is the oppressor to right.

2182
02:09:38,110 --> 02:09:39,720
Uh,
and then like recognize some,

2183
02:09:39,730 --> 02:09:40,563
well the left,
he has a little pressing the 

2184
02:09:42,461 --> 02:09:47,461
universities and the universities are 
oppressing the culture now with that and

2185
02:09:49,361 --> 02:09:53,560
that translates to some degree into what
you're disruptive.

2186
02:09:54,240 --> 02:09:55,900
