1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,273
So back in February,
I received the following letter from a 

2
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:10,680
student at Linfield college and 
according to its website

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:13,043
with campuses in Mcminnville,
Portland and a prestigious online 

4
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:16,914
program.
Linfield college is a premier choice in 

5
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:23,100
the Pacific northwest for a high quality
traditional liberal arts education.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,593
Want to learn more,
contact us for details about her degree 

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,330
and certificate program offerings.
A student there who I won't name,

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,370
um,
sent me the followup letter.

9
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,990
Dear Dr. Peterson,
I'm an undergraduate student at Linfield

10
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:41,520
college in Mcminnville,
Oregon.

11
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,303
The international students for Liberty 
Conference recently granted me a small 

12
00:00:45,841 --> 00:00:46,674
sum to organize pro liberty events on 
campus with an emphasis on the 

13
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:51,564
importance of free speech.
I'm writing to ask you if you're 

14
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,253
accepting speaking invitations at this 
time and if your schedule sometime 

15
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:02,670
between now and may would allow it to 
help narrow down my options.

16
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:04,853
I would like to offer you $1,500 and an 
invitation to speak here this spring 

17
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:09,510
semester.

18
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,330
Your travel and accommodation costs will
also be covered.

19
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,030
I perceived Linfield as an institution 
at an ideological crossroads.

20
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,343
I feel it is my responsibility to pick 
the most effective voice possible for 

21
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:23,634
helping lynnfield chart a course that 
will ensure its future as a place of 

22
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:30,930
reason and academic integrity.
After listening to many of your lectures

23
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:31,764
and interviews,
I believe your message is ideal for our 

24
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:34,524
campus.
Honest and productive argumentation is 

25
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:38,094
one of your specialties.
Lynnfield would greatly benefit from 

26
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:42,900
being introduced to your ideas on the 
subject.

27
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,360
We are a small college of roughly 2000 
students situated in quiet wine country.

28
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,093
Your work continues to have a deep 
impact on my personal and intellectual 

29
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:54,870
growth.
I'd be honored to hear from you.

30
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,960
Thank you for your time and 
consideration.

31
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,143
So after considering it for awhile,
I agreed to come and speak at Linfield 

32
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,663
College.
On March 18th I received a note from an 

33
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,210
invitation student,
the inviting student who said,

34
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,740
good morning Dr. Peterson.

35
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,240
I would be overjoyed to confirm a date.
So we went about doing that.

36
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,760
On April 7th he replied to me again to 
update me.

37
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,623
He said,
the talk will be held in Ice Auditorium 

38
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,163
in Melrose Hall.
April 24th beginning at 7:00 PM I'm 

39
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:32,814
referring to the event simply as a talk 
with Jordan Peterson because his 

40
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:39,150
speaking style allows for a lot of 
fluidity in topic.

41
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,763
However,
the core theme to the event is the 

42
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:45,600
importance of freedom of speech,
especially in higher education.

43
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,513
Some of the administration slash student
government have began to fret about the 

44
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:53,730
potential for people to feel open,
quote,

45
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,240
offended and oppressed.
Closed quote by Peter since talk.

46
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,490
It's more pushback than I expected at 
Linfield,

47
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,620
but I don't think it's a cause for 
concern.

48
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,413
I'm fighting hard to keep their worries 
at bay and there's a very supportive 

49
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:11,380
group of students and community members 
who have my back free speech.

50
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,483
We'll win.
On April 17th the following article 

51
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,980
appeared in the student newspaper,

52
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,440
Bye Kelly or Neil,
editor in chief.

53
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,580
It's called hate symbol on ball riles 
campus.

54
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:30,090
The Lindsay of young Americans for 
liberty groups,

55
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:30,983
free speech ball outside of Walker Hall 
on April 12th received attention from 

56
00:03:34,861 --> 00:03:37,530
students and faculty when a student drew
pepe the frog,

57
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,040
which has recently been appropriated by 
white supremacist groups.

58
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,940
Linfield college posted a picture of the
ball on it's an instagram account,

59
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,870
but it was later removed because of the 
frogs association with alt right groups.

60
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,290
As soon as it was pointed out that the 
photo included the image,

61
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,243
the instagram post was removed,
President Thomas helped set the free 

62
00:03:57,511 --> 00:03:58,344
speech ball event.
The first event in the speak freely at 

63
00:04:01,051 --> 00:04:01,884
series at linfield encourage students to
express themselves by writing and 

64
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:07,290
drawing on the ball to promote free 
speech.

65
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,720
Pepe the frog is a popular Internet mean
that is often appeared in humorous ways.

66
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,153
The Anti Defamation League has listed 
pepe the frog on it to heat symbols 

67
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,263
database.

68
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:19,823
I only heard about it second hand and I 
understand that it is a place for free 

69
00:04:22,681 --> 00:04:25,470
speech,
but in all reality it was certainly done

70
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,304
in very poor taste.
Junior John Christianson set according 

71
00:04:30,361 --> 00:04:33,810
to its website,
the y a l mission is to open quote,

72
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,010
identify,
educate,

73
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,873
train,
and mobilize youth activists committed 

74
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:38,244
to winning on principle.
Our goal is to cast the leaders of 

75
00:04:41,131 --> 00:04:43,680
tomorrow and reclaim the policies,
candidates,

76
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,080
and direction of our government.
Close quote,

77
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,750
a member of y,
a l drew.

78
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,613
The pepe the frog on the ball,
but asked to remain unidentified open 

79
00:04:53,611 --> 00:04:55,920
court.
I knew the person who drew peppy.

80
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,980
He didn't draw it to be negative.
He drew it to be funny.

81
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,170
Close quote,
senior Parker Wells,

82
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,093
a member of y a l said he continued.
We understand some groups appropriated 

83
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,170
the image,
but any image can be appropriated.

84
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,950
Well said his goals with the free speech
ball.

85
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,173
We're to get people thinking about the 
rights to free expression and to bring 

86
00:05:17,341 --> 00:05:21,240
more attention to the y a l group.
He said,

87
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,090
I understand that it's necessary to set 
limits,

88
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:27,660
but I don't think this cartoon fraud is 
a limit to set for free speech.

89
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,093
I find it unfortunate that people can't 
enjoy this event because of the frog 

90
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:34,740
image
as a part of it.

91
00:05:34,741 --> 00:05:35,574
Speak freely.
Series y a l is bringing Dr. Jordan 

92
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,390
Peterson to campus on Monday,
April 24th the group is also showing the

93
00:05:42,391 --> 00:05:45,840
documentary the red pill on Tuesday,
May 2nd

94
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:50,030
professor of English Rashmi.
Dot.

95
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,930
Valor stats set open quotes.
All right,

96
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,773
fine.
Both the invitation of Jordan Peterson 

97
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:55,874
and the screening of the documentary,
the red by the young Americans for 

98
00:05:58,431 --> 00:06:00,530
Liberty Club.
Extremely problematic.

99
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,410
Problematic because neither peterson 
northern film,

100
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,140
we'll be promoting dialogues about 
gendered inclusions,

101
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:10,880
but rather be promoting a dangerous and 
offensive logic of gendered exclusions.

102
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,350
Dr. Butler staff continued the promotion
of such exclusionary practices,

103
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,900
greatly threatened safe spaces for our 
students,

104
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:20,734
staff and faculty who belonged to 
marginalized groups and violates our 

105
00:06:23,651 --> 00:06:26,710
ethos of upholding mutual respect on our
campus.

106
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,263
The president's diversity committee,
we're holding discussion at 5:30 PM on 

107
00:06:33,151 --> 00:06:36,210
Monday in the pioneer reading room 
titled Free Speech,

108
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,060
what it is and what it is,
not the discussion.

109
00:06:39,061 --> 00:06:43,230
We'll examine free speech and members of
the Linfield community are encouraged to

110
00:06:43,231 --> 00:06:44,064
attend.
So that's the end of that newspaper 

111
00:06:46,081 --> 00:06:46,914
article.
So I read that it was forwarded to me 

112
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,710
soon after I tweeted the following 
message.

113
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,320
Open quote,
I'm violating some more safe spaces.

114
00:06:58,321 --> 00:07:01,980
Suit Linfield College.
April 24th

115
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,383
well on April 19th I received a letter 
from the student who would organize my 

116
00:07:09,571 --> 00:07:11,100
talk.
He said,

117
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,490
things have gone nuclear.
This email.

118
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,080
The one I'm going to read to you was 
just sad to all of Lynnfield.

119
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,873
One of the stipulations they are 
referring to is the contract which they 

120
00:07:23,251 --> 00:07:24,084
rejected because it was a day late.
Our Club is currently looking for space 

121
00:07:27,151 --> 00:07:30,300
in downtown in Mcminnville to hold 
Peterson's talk in step.

122
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,860
The media is likely getting involved.
I'm sorry for this insanity.

123
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,220
We tried very hard to keep things civil 
here,

124
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:42,210
so here is the letter sent out to the 
entire community

125
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,403
Lynnfield community.
I am writing on behalf of the Linfield 

126
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:52,220
cabinet as officer in charge,
what President Peli is out.

127
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,533
I want to let the Linfield community 
know that the a s l c associated 

128
00:07:57,891 --> 00:07:58,724
students of Linfield college has 
determined it will not fund Dr. Jordan 

129
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:02,943
Peterson appearance next week because 
stipulations for the event were not met 

130
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:07,940
by the requester,
young Americans for liberty.

131
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,660
Since the authorization parameters,
we're not satisfied.

132
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,613
The college will not host the event on 
April 24th among the stipulations was 

133
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:17,654
that the event was to be a private 
linfield college only event by his own 

134
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:22,094
tweet yesterday to 107,000 followers.
Dr. Peterson indicates he would be open 

135
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:29,090
quote,
violating more safe spaces.

136
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,450
Sued Linfield College,
close quote,

137
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:38,090
likeminded supporters from outside our 
community have responded affirmatively.

138
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,033
Our policy on anti harassment protection
and academic freedom states that open 

139
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:45,704
quote,
Andy harassment policies are not 

140
00:08:47,391 --> 00:08:48,224
intended to limit the free exchange of 
opinions or the vigorous debate over 

141
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:53,240
ideas.
However,

142
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,100
intimidation,
harassment,

143
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,943
exploitation,
and the use or threat of force are 

144
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:01,110
incompatible with the preservation of 
this freedom.

145
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,170
The letter continues based on the 
speaker's own words.

146
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,063
This event no longer presents the 
possibility of academic inquiry within 

147
00:09:10,281 --> 00:09:12,950
the Linfield community.
Our policy is clear,

148
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,240
open quote,
harassment and intimidation preclude the

149
00:09:17,241 --> 00:09:21,230
very possibility for maintaining an 
atmosphere of academic freedom.

150
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:22,843
We cannot welcome speakers when the 
stipulations for their appearances are 

151
00:09:25,641 --> 00:09:26,474
not met and who attend,
who intend to violate the safety of our 

152
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:33,110
community.
Respectfully,

153
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,330
Susan Egg Ref Kip in hand.

154
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,380
So I wrote a letter to Susan Agra,
Kevin Hamm.

155
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,580
Now you understand that by this time the
flights had been arranged,

156
00:09:45,581 --> 00:09:48,340
the accommodation had been arranged,
everything was in place,

157
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:50,710
and of course they had known about this 
for a long time.

158
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:52,203
Dear Susan,
I received a copy of your letter to the 

159
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:56,554
Linfield community this morning as well 
as an indication that my long scheduled 

160
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:02,680
talk at Linfield has been canceled.
That is fine,

161
00:10:02,681 --> 00:10:03,514
I suppose except that the plane tickets 
have been booked and the hotel 

162
00:10:06,251 --> 00:10:07,084
reservations have been made as well as 
three days taken out of my schedule at 

163
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:11,194
my expense.
I think you are treating me and the 

164
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:19,531
student group who invited me in a manner
that is absolutely reprehensible as well

165
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:21,520
as cowardly,
an underhanded.

166
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:25,750
I have made arrangements to come to 
linfield which is extremely distant from

167
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:28,420
me and out of the way in good faith.

168
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,303
Now you cancel it with a plethora of 
specious reasons including your anti 

169
00:10:34,451 --> 00:10:35,284
harassment policy.
Although I have harassed no one nor 

170
00:10:37,481 --> 00:10:38,890
intimidated,
exploited,

171
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,873
or threaten force had I not previously 
received notice of the controversy 

172
00:10:44,201 --> 00:10:47,260
around my arrival,
which is in my opinion on warranted,

173
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,140
I would not have tweeted my intent to 
open quote,

174
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,020
violate safe spaces,
close quote,

175
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,860
which is a satirical comment in case it 
needs to be said.

176
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,993
Obviously you were looking for any 
excuse no matter how trivial to cancel 

177
00:11:01,121 --> 00:11:05,080
this event.
You also note that open quote,

178
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,003
this event no longer presents the 
possibility of academic inquiry within 

179
00:11:09,551 --> 00:11:14,050
the Linfield community close quote,
I might point out that Linfield,

180
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,003
it's a college,
not a community and that ideas need to 

181
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:21,610
be discussed in a college.
You also state that open quote,

182
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:22,653
anti harassment policies are not 
intended to limit the free exchange of 

183
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,060
opinions or the vigorous debate over 
ideas,

184
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:31,510
close quote and then proceed to do 
exactly that.

185
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,423
You also mentioned that you have 
received support from open quote like 

186
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:40,120
binded supporters,
close quote from outside your community,

187
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,343
which is hardly surprising or 
informative given that they were 

188
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:44,704
likeminded.
You also suggest that because the 

189
00:11:47,381 --> 00:11:48,214
contract was delayed one day,
that constitutes sufficient grounds for 

190
00:11:50,951 --> 00:11:51,784
cancellation even though you knew well 
that the event was booked and finalized 

191
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:59,260
and it's such delays are by no means 
unheard of in such situations.

192
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,633
You might also note that aghast invited 
to your college might expect to be 

193
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:07,180
treated with a modicum of consideration 
and respect.

194
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,033
Here's what I plan to do.
I'm going to make a video tomorrow 

195
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:14,980
morning at the latest reading this 
letter on Youtube,

196
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,530
explaining that by invitation has been 
revoked.

197
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,040
What that means for me and the nature of
the reasons given.

198
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,880
I will also read this letter of response
from me.

199
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,630
It should be watched by about 150,000 
viewers,

200
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,523
many of whom I imagine we'll be 
lynnfield alumni supporters and 

201
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:33,004
students.

202
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,860
I'm perfectly willing to see what they 
all have to say.

203
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,390
Then we can let the dust settle where it
may sincerely,

204
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,950
Dr. Jordan B.
Peterson,

205
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,800
professor of psychology at University of
Toronto.

206
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,860
I received absolutely nothing in 
response.

207
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,570
I've got no,
uh,

208
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,063
he didn't even have the decency to send 
me a notification explaining their 

209
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,090
rationale.
Nothing.

210
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,880
So I was treated as far as I'm concerned
with,

211
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,103
with uh,
well let's call it unprofessionally and 

212
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:04,600
leave it at that.
So what's the story now?

213
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,100
The organizing students tried to book an
alternative venue.

214
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:13,210
They didn't have enough money to rent a 
suitable theater or lecture hall.

215
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,710
I told them that they could use my 
honorarium to pay for the space,

216
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,860
which they did.
The yamhill valley news.

217
00:13:20,861 --> 00:13:21,694
register.com posted this update April 
20th off campus venue found for 

218
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,264
controversial speaker.
Linfield college is student government 

219
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:36,010
organization this week with drew 
permission for a newly organized club,

220
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,053
young Americans for liberty to bring a 
controversial speaker to campus for a 

221
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:41,470
free public talk.
Monday,

222
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,840
the group has responded by lining up an 
off campus location for the presentation

223
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:48,883
featuring Jordan Peterson,
I Canadian professor whose campaign 

224
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:53,144
against gender neutral pronouns is 
considered offensive by some do the 

225
00:13:57,321 --> 00:13:58,154
transgender population.
Peterson has been rebooked for seven to 

226
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:02,174
9:00 PM at the falls event center housed
in the former chapel on the evergreen 

227
00:14:06,051 --> 00:14:11,051
aviation and space museum campus.
So on with the show,

228
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,593
and you can figure out what I think of 
the linfield administrators who pulled 

229
00:14:16,851 --> 00:14:18,500
this stunt on your own.

230
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:20,980
Thanks for watching.
