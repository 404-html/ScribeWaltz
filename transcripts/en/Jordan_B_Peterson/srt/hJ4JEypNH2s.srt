1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,180
Okay,

2
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:19,140
so today I'm talking to Dr James W 
pennebaker.

3
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,000
He is professor of psychology at the 
University of Texas at Austin,

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:29,360
and the Executive Director of Project 
Twenty Twenty one aimed at rethinking 

5
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,980
undergraduate education at that 
university.

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,090
His cross disciplinary research is 
related to linguistics,

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,300
clinical and cognitive psychology,
communications,

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,820
medicine,
and computer science.

9
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:47,810
He and his students have explored 
natural language use group dynamics and 

10
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,150
personality in educational and other 
real world settings.

11
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,660
He has demonstrated that physical health
and work performance can be improved by 

12
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,531
simple writing or talking exercises.
Dr Pennebaker has received numerous 

13
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:06,021
awards and honors has written or edited 
more than 250 scientific articles as 

14
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:11,541
well as nine books,
including more recently expressive 

15
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:14,190
writing words that heal and the secret 
life of pronouns.

16
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,340
He also happens to be one of my favorite
psychologists.

17
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,760
Welcome Dr Pennebaker.
I'm very much looking forward to talking

18
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:22,440
to you guys to be here.
Thank you.

19
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,940
Great.
So,

20
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,160
um,
as you may know what,

21
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:28,320
because I think we've talked about this 
a little bit before.

22
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:33,620
I developed some computer online,
computerized writing programs with my 

23
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,690
colleagues,
one of which we call future authoring.

24
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,040
One's passed,
all three ones present,

25
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:43,050
all threatening.
There are a suite of writing program 

26
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,210
said they were heavily influenced in 
their design by your research.

27
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,600
Um,
my lab's been interested in narrative 

28
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,241
for a long time and also in,
in clinical work and also in the 

29
00:01:53,241 --> 00:01:54,470
application of psychology,
uh,

30
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,810
in the,
in the real world setting and the 

31
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,431
practical setting.
And I spent a lot of time developing 

32
00:02:01,431 --> 00:02:04,791
tests to help employers screen for 
employees and we got pretty good at 

33
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:07,170
that.
But while I was doing that,

34
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:12,171
I was constantly bombarded with 
questions from managers of middle 

35
00:02:12,171 --> 00:02:16,791
managers usually have medium sized and 
large corporations telling me that it 

36
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:19,890
was all well and good if we could hire 
better employees,

37
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:24,891
but they wanted to know what they could 
do with their poorer performing 

38
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:24,891
employees,
uh,

39
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:27,990
because that was a continual,
an intractable problem.

40
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:29,130
And I thought,
well,

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
you don't have that much interaction 
with them and it's not that easy to 

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,611
solve people's problems.
So there's probably not a lot you could 

43
00:02:37,611 --> 00:02:40,521
do,
but I kinda got sick of telling people 

44
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:41,120
that over and over.
And so I scoured the literature.

45
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,460
It was at that point,
probably about 15 years ago,

46
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:49,461
10,
15 years ago that I came across your 

47
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,471
research on expressive writing,
so maybe you could start by telling us 

48
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:55,730
what you,
what you learned and how you went about 

49
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:55,730
it.

50
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,950
A little bit of background.
I'm a social psychologist by training,

51
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:00,160
so

52
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,170
I.
I don't have any clinical training.

53
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:07,171
I'm a.
most of my career has just been 

54
00:03:07,171 --> 00:03:10,081
stumbling upon one idea after another as
opposed to approaching anything with a 

55
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:15,420
clear set up where it was going.
I had been looking at mind body issues.

56
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:19,180
I've always been interested in how 
psychological factors influence physical

57
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:24,181
health and mental health and I came 
across a fighting years ago that just 

58
00:03:24,181 --> 00:03:28,441
bugged me and that was people who have 
had a major traumatic experience in 

59
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:32,170
their lives that were much more likely 
to get sick and people who had not.

60
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,010
Now that that was an old finding,
but as I dug in more deeply,

61
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:39,640
what I discovered was people who had a 
trauma and kept it secret.

62
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,880
We're far more likely to have health 
problems than people who had the same 

63
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,031
trauma,
but who talked with others about it and 

64
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:51,751
it made me wonder what if we brought 
people in the lab and had them actually 

65
00:03:51,751 --> 00:03:52,270
write about it,
some kind of trauma,

66
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:57,271
ideally one they hadn't talked to other 
people about would that influence their 

67
00:03:57,401 --> 00:04:00,430
health and that was really the 
underlying idea.

68
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:05,430
So the very first study was done in 1983
and we brought in about 50 people.

69
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:14,010
Some of them were asked to write about 
the most dramatic experience of their 

70
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:14,110
lives.
The other half were asked to write about

71
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:19,111
superficial topics.
I'm simplifying this study some and they

72
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:21,550
wrote for four days,
15 minutes a day,

73
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,720
and they also gave us permission to 
track their student health center 

74
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,600
records.
These were college students and this was

75
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:33,601
at a private college where the student 
health center was right next to the 

76
00:04:33,601 --> 00:04:34,020
dorms.
Well,

77
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:39,030
what we discovered was that those people
who were asked about traumatic 

78
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:42,751
experiences ended up going to the 
student health center at about half the 

79
00:04:42,751 --> 00:04:46,501
rate as people in our control condition.
The ones who had regretted about 

80
00:04:46,501 --> 00:04:51,361
superficial topics over the next three 
to six months and this was a really 

81
00:04:51,361 --> 00:04:53,370
studying,
finding it was,

82
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,620
you know,
what I kind of hoped would occur,

83
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:58,530
but I never,
uh,

84
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,510
I was so thrilled that it actually 
worked.

85
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:07,030
And then we did another study that was 
very similar and here again,

86
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:12,031
we had half the people write about 
traumas have right about superficial 

87
00:05:12,031 --> 00:05:12,970
topics and they just,
they,

88
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,340
they wrote about trauma or superficial 
topics.

89
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,690
By a flip of the coin.
We decided which are the two topics 

90
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,020
they'd write about and this time we drew
blood before we,

91
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:27,460
uh,
assign them to condition again after the

92
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,460
last day of writing.
And then six weeks later and the blood 

93
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,330
was essay by a group of people at Ohio 
state looking at immune function.

94
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:39,870
And again,
we found that writing about traumatic 

95
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,971
experiences associated with enhanced 
immune function and also reductions in 

96
00:05:41,971 --> 00:05:46,600
doctor visits.
And this now takes us to about 1988.

97
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:50,140
And by then other labs started to see 
what we were doing.

98
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:54,790
And it's the,
the whole technique started to take off.

99
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:00,240
And then over the years,
more and more including my own found 

100
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,390
generally positive effects,
not always,

101
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:07,010
but generally they're writing about 
upsetting experiences had this saluatory

102
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:12,011
affected and influenced both health,
physical health and mental health.

103
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:17,350
And then later various labs found to be 
related to all sorts of things 

104
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,830
associated with,
uh,

105
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,120
increased,
uh,

106
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:23,630
memory,
cognitive functioning and so forth.

107
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,680
So,
so

108
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,930
if I remember correctly as well,
when you were doing the earliest 

109
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,890
studies,
you were also influenced by Freud's idea

110
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,520
of catharsis.
And that was the idea that if,

111
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,730
if people had a traumatic or unpleasant 
experience,

112
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:44,090
if they were encouraged to express the 
emotions that were associated with that 

113
00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:45,960
experience,
that that would be curative.

114
00:06:45,961 --> 00:06:48,270
That was partly Freud's hypothesis,

115
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,390
but it was a little bit.
It's important to.

116
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,460
It is absolutely consistent with,
with Freud's initial idea.

117
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:04,170
And what was interesting is because most
people listening to this podcast,

118
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:10,260
we'll hear Catharsis and they will think
that Catharsis means blowing off steam 

119
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:14,820
venting.
And that's not actually what Freud 

120
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:14,980
actually meant.
And it's interesting in Europe,

121
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:18,940
catharsis has a completely different 
meaning than it does in North America.

122
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,590
So in North America we view it as 
venting Freud and Jung and Europeans,

123
00:07:23,591 --> 00:07:28,591
you'd Catharsis as connecting emotions 
and thoughts and that is actually what I

124
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:30,830
was doing.
I really,

125
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I had assumed that Freud meant venting 
and we had found actually that people 

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,351
who just blew off steam,
who he just expressed emotions actually 

127
00:07:40,351 --> 00:07:41,800
didn't show any health improvements.
It was only

128
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:43,470
what stick analysis.
Right.

129
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:46,500
And that was really fascinating about 
the research.

130
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:48,540
So maybe you can tell us a bit about 
that too.

131
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,070
Well,
I wasn't initially again,

132
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,590
uh,
I have never.

133
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,880
I had never been at a and been 
interested in psychotherapy in here.

134
00:08:02,561 --> 00:08:06,700
All of a sudden I was doing a study that
was essentially glorified psychotherapy,

135
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:11,970
which garbage speaking to clinicians.
And then the question was why does 

136
00:08:12,161 --> 00:08:15,340
writing about an upsetting experience 
bringing about these changes?

137
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:20,580
And it's not a straightforward question,
but there's not a straightforward 

138
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,380
answer.
And my lab and others started looking at

139
00:08:23,381 --> 00:08:28,381
all sorts of possibilities and looking 
at markers of inhibition,

140
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,030
you know,
the people holding back,

141
00:08:31,031 --> 00:08:34,540
we're more prone to illness.
And what this did was to loosen them up.

142
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:39,190
We didn't find good evidence for that.
Other people had other hypotheses and at

143
00:08:39,191 --> 00:08:44,191
some point I started looking at what 
people were actually saying and I got 

144
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:48,660
groups of people,
students who are in clinical psychology 

145
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,650
to write the essays that people wrote in
on all these different dimensions and 

146
00:08:52,931 --> 00:08:57,931
what I found was that relying on people 
to read these essays and come up with 

147
00:08:57,931 --> 00:09:02,661
some kind of deep understanding or even 
predicting if a person would benefit or 

148
00:09:02,661 --> 00:09:03,960
not just didn't work.

149
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,780
It was too hard.
The stories were really traumatic.

150
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:09,470
They actually depressed a lot of the 
people who were in our system who,

151
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:14,630
who were reading the essays.
So it occurred to me it would make much 

152
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:18,450
more sense to come up with some 
objective marker of reading these essays

153
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:20,760
and a computer program would be what I 
needed.

154
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,760
Well,
it turns out back then,

155
00:09:23,761 --> 00:09:28,761
this was now the early nineties.
There was no such program and 

156
00:09:28,761 --> 00:09:32,411
fortunately I'd take it a little 
computer science in college and one of 

157
00:09:32,411 --> 00:09:32,580
my graduate students,
Martha Francis,

158
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:37,581
had actually done some done her 
undergraduate degree in computer 

159
00:09:37,581 --> 00:09:41,091
science.
And so I asked Martha to essentially 

160
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:48,380
help me to a computer program that could
go through and analyze the the language 

161
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:54,290
of an essay,
and the idea behind it is really quite 

162
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:57,591
simple.
You have the computer go in and look at 

163
00:09:57,591 --> 00:10:00,441
each word and you would compare each 
word in the essay with some master list 

164
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:02,070
of words.

165
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,470
So we would,
let's say we're looking for anger words.

166
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:07,710
We want the computer to count up all the
words associated with anger.

167
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,740
So we'd have this dictionary of anger 
words.

168
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,280
And to get that dictionary we had to 
make that ourselves.

169
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,980
We had to look in dictionaries,
thesauruses.

170
00:10:16,981 --> 00:10:19,950
We had to have students generate anger 
words.

171
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,400
And then we had all these rules of what 
account,

172
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:26,520
what makes for an egg award versus not.
But once you have that list,

173
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,160
you go through and you have the computer
look at each word,

174
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:32,510
compare it with a master list,
and anytime it finds it anger word,

175
00:10:32,511 --> 00:10:35,160
it just adds it up.
And at the end it adds up.

176
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:38,370
All the anger words divided by the total
number of words,

177
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,220
and it produces the percentage of total 
anger words.

178
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:46,510
In an essay,
and we did this now for not just anger 

179
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,340
words or sad words,
guilt words,

180
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:52,400
negative emotion words in general,
but we did positive emotion words and 

181
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,211
then cognitive words,
words that suggested cause and effect 

182
00:10:56,211 --> 00:10:59,880
like cars because effect,
rationale where such as that,

183
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,960
and then as long as we were doing it,
we added more and more dimensions.

184
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,470
We,
you know,

185
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,230
we had pronouns and prepositions and 
articles,

186
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:08,050
etc.
Etc.

187
00:11:08,051 --> 00:11:13,051
And wE ended up with about.
Now there's probably 80 different 

188
00:11:13,051 --> 00:11:16,161
dimensions,
but when we went back and started 

189
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,200
looking at essays,
we found that certain dimensions of 

190
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,450
writing really predicted health 
improvements.

191
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:28,180
Now we found that the use of positive 
emotions was associated with health 

192
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:32,241
improvement.
So if you cAn write an essay about the 

193
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:33,240
worst thing in your life and still use 
positive emotions,

194
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:37,290
it's a marker that you're going to show 
health improvements.

195
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,990
The effects are pretty small negative 
emotion words using a moderate number of

196
00:11:42,991 --> 00:11:46,650
negative emotions is weakly related to 
doing better as well.

197
00:11:46,651 --> 00:11:51,510
But what turned out to be far stronger 
was use of cognitive words.

198
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:56,511
Whereas like,
because effect where it's like 

199
00:11:56,511 --> 00:11:59,680
understand and realize no,
these are words that we now know are 

200
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,920
markers of people working through a 
problem.

201
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,840
Let me ask you a question about that 
because I saw it a lot about that.

202
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,330
I thought that was really aN interesting
idea.

203
00:12:09,331 --> 00:12:10,250
So,
um,

204
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,650
this question has to do with the 
function of memory.

205
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:19,330
So it's,
it's pretty obvious that we don't and 

206
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,850
count store what's the equivalent of a 
videotape of the entire domain of 

207
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:27,390
sensory experience when we're 
interacting with people.

208
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,100
Um,
and,

209
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,760
and it just so obvious as well that that
isn't how memory works and that memory 

210
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,001
is modifiable across time.
And so here's a hypothesis for you and 

211
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:42,480
you tell me what you think about this.
It seems to me that the purpose of 

212
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,271
memory is so that you can remember the 
good things that happened to you in the 

213
00:12:47,271 --> 00:12:51,831
past and how they occurred and duplicate
them in the future and remember the bad 

214
00:12:52,201 --> 00:12:57,201
things that happened and figure out why 
and change your course of lights and 

215
00:12:57,201 --> 00:12:59,940
your pathway in the future so that they 
occur less frequently.

216
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,940
And so the cause and effect analysis 
would be something like the adjustment 

217
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:09,231
of a,
of a pathway map and it sort of reminds 

218
00:13:09,231 --> 00:13:11,940
me of the work that was done with rap 
memory because the hippa campus seems to

219
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:16,941
store or something like cognitive maps 
and maps almost by definition are are 

220
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:23,130
are representations of ways to get from 
one place to another and so you could 

221
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:27,231
say maybe that you go from one place to 
another and you fall into a hole and 

222
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:32,340
that's very traumatic and so you,
you remember the pathway and how you got

223
00:13:32,341 --> 00:13:37,341
there and analyze it and reconstruct a 
different potential future causal 

224
00:13:38,161 --> 00:13:41,100
pathway so that you don't have to fall 
into the same hole twice.

225
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,350
You know,
I don't know what you think about that,

226
00:13:43,351 --> 00:13:43,560
but.

227
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:49,300
Well I think that actually I think that 
works is true both the way you describe 

228
00:13:52,021 --> 00:13:57,021
it,
but also on a much broader metaphorical 

229
00:13:57,021 --> 00:13:57,021
level.
So for example,

230
00:13:57,021 --> 00:14:00,981
a person who falls into an emotional 
hole that their life is going well and 

231
00:14:00,981 --> 00:14:05,961
then their girlfriend dumps them and 
they go and get drunk in a bar and wreck

232
00:14:10,051 --> 00:14:14,250
their car.
That experience is incredibly,

233
00:14:14,251 --> 00:14:18,300
incredibly complex and it,
unlike the rat,

234
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,400
what the human mind has to figure out 
what in the world went on with my 

235
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,620
girlfriend,
why did she leave me?

236
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:28,350
What did I do?
Why did I go get drunk?

237
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:33,351
Have I been drinking too much and right.
If to process that requires tremendous 

238
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:39,531
cognitive capacity and what happens is 
if it's something were humiliated about,

239
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:43,880
were really reticent to talk to other 
people about it and we.

240
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:48,970
So we add languages,
a really efficient way to process 

241
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,070
complex issues.
Yes.

242
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,740
Shared language,
you know?

243
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:57,270
Well,
so what I found in my clinical practice 

244
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:57,570
very frequently is that I,
I think with,

245
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:01,880
with people who are traumatized,
they often encounter.

246
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,700
this is something else I wanted to ask 
you both.

247
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,820
They often have an encounter with 
malevolence as well as a,

248
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,410
as a,
as an encounter with just catastrophe.

249
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:11,990
So it's not only did something bad 
happens to them,

250
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,340
it's often something bad that's been 
consciously directed that the by another

251
00:15:16,341 --> 00:15:19,190
person and they have a really hard time 
mapping that,

252
00:15:19,191 --> 00:15:21,260
especially if there is somewhat naive 
people,

253
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,730
but then the other people who are 
mentally affected by such things and can

254
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,230
recover are those who have no one to 
listen to them because people,

255
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,440
it seems to me that most people think by
talking and unless you have someone to 

256
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:40,541
talk to,
you actually don't get to think through 

257
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:41,120
it and draw the appropriate,
let's call them cause the lessons.

258
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:46,720
So,
and then you also made this comment 

259
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:46,720
about,
you know,

260
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,010
let's say the classic example I like to 
use is that,

261
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:54,070
you know,
maybe you're a premed student and you 

262
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:54,980
write the medical,
the g,

263
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,600
what is it,
what's the one for,

264
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:59,300
for medical entrance kept.
Yeah,

265
00:15:59,301 --> 00:15:59,750
yeah,
yeah.

266
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:04,751
So you know,
you consider yourself as a pretty solid 

267
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:06,020
student and that's a core element of.
You're like,

268
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:09,590
it's a predicate of the multiple maps of
your life that you use.

269
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,940
And then you write the end cap and you 
end up with 20th percentile scores.

270
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:19,330
And so then what happens is that not 
only is your map of the future now 

271
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:23,831
rendered null and void,
but so is your map of you as a predicate

272
00:16:23,991 --> 00:16:28,991
for president actions and also 
everything about yourself that you 

273
00:16:28,991 --> 00:16:33,011
thought held true in the past has to be 
reexamined and so it's something like 

274
00:16:33,011 --> 00:16:37,850
the the degree of trauma is 
proportionate to the amount of the area 

275
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,810
that have map that's disturbed by the,
by the,

276
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,700
by the unfortunate,
unexpected,

277
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,710
and sometimes the malevolent event.

278
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:49,520
ANd so then the other thing I was 
thinking about with regards to this,

279
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:53,390
and I think this is more germane to the 
immunological element,

280
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:58,420
is so it's obviously very,
very difficult for the mind to compute 

281
00:16:58,821 --> 00:17:03,821
how dangerous the environment is because
the environment in some senses 

282
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:08,410
infinitely dangerous.
And you never know when something small 

283
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,621
happens to you.
If it's the harbinger of something 

284
00:17:11,621 --> 00:17:13,841
that's terrible.
So because an ache in your side can be 

285
00:17:13,841 --> 00:17:15,440
the cancer that kills you.
So you might ask yourself,

286
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:20,570
given the complexity of,
of framing in an unexpected event,

287
00:17:20,571 --> 00:17:24,800
how do you ever manage it?
And so part of it's temperamental,

288
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:29,801
so if you're higher in neuroticism,
things hit you harder and part of it is 

289
00:17:29,801 --> 00:17:34,121
based on your observed competence.
But the other part I think is something 

290
00:17:34,121 --> 00:17:37,901
like,
it's something like the brain computes 

291
00:17:37,901 --> 00:17:41,960
the proportion of times that you failed 
in the past compared to the performer to

292
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:45,020
the times that you've succeeded and 
calculates.

293
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,360
I liked that name,
danger in depths,

294
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:52,510
and then it raises up your average 
cortisol levels in correspondence to how

295
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:58,461
dangerous the general environment as 
being because that puts you on alert 

296
00:17:58,461 --> 00:18:03,110
more.
And the problem with the advantage to 

297
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,110
being on alert is that,
well,

298
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,990
if anything else negative happens,
you're more ready to act.

299
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:11,790
But the negative consequences is the 
cortisol is toxic and in reason,

300
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,010
you know,
in high doses across time.

301
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:19,011
And it also suppresses immunological 
function and it also tends to suppress 

302
00:18:19,011 --> 00:18:23,661
prefrontal functioning as well because 
the prefrontal cortex is more involved 

303
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:28,761
in low,
medium to longterm planning and less in 

304
00:18:28,761 --> 00:18:29,220
short term emergency preparation 
activities.

305
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:32,760
So I'd also like to know if you know 
that,

306
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:35,160
that those ideas ring,
ring a bell.

307
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,170
So they do that.
There's an interesting.

308
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,560
So the,
there's another dimension that ties into

309
00:18:43,561 --> 00:18:48,561
this and that is sleep,
so we know that sleep is intimately 

310
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:50,280
related to cortisol is related to 
depression,

311
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:52,460
is related to immune function,
is related to,

312
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,500
you know,
all of these systems are inter 

313
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,231
correlated and the person who is dealing
with an upheaval that they're trying to 

314
00:19:01,591 --> 00:19:04,160
understand what they'd had,
don't have somebody to talk to,

315
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:08,670
end up not sleeping as well and part of 
it is they're trying to process all this

316
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:13,671
additional information and this ties 
into the idea of working memory that 

317
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,250
they have less working memory.
They're not Sleeping as well.

318
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:23,090
Cortisol is is higher there and they are
also worse friends,

319
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:29,100
so when you talk to them,
they're distracted.

320
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:34,101
They're not paying attention and so all 
of these things are working together to 

321
00:19:36,331 --> 00:19:41,331
undermine the person.
Now their cortisol hypothesis is a 

322
00:19:41,331 --> 00:19:42,660
wonderful hypothesis.

323
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:47,190
The killer problem is that the studies 
that have been done with cortisol and is

324
00:19:47,191 --> 00:19:52,191
linked to writing and trauma have been.
you'd have to stand back and look at the

325
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,040
overall studies.
It kind of squint and there's a weak 

326
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,521
evidence to support it,
but it's not as clean as I wish it were.

327
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,560
Of course,
this has been the problem with,

328
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:10,100
with the writing and research,
but it's also the problem of all 

329
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:10,810
clinical research that theory is,
you know,

330
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:15,830
once you start getting real data,
and this is not just self reports of p 

331
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,830
of a client said,
oh yeah,

332
00:20:16,831 --> 00:20:20,460
that was really great.
When you start to get a hard data,

333
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,810
everything is kind of off the table that
the effect sizes are very,

334
00:20:24,811 --> 00:20:26,280
very modest.
Either way.

335
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:29,370
That's true of medical outcomes as well 
for medical disease.

336
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:30,170
Yeah.

337
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:32,080
So,
okay,

338
00:20:32,081 --> 00:20:37,081
so you're the downward spiral that you 
sort of described there too,

339
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,240
could also account for,
could also account for the negative 

340
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,370
health consequences post trauma.
I mean,

341
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:48,390
so you can imagine,
first of all is that the traumatized 

342
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,440
person is going to be more reactive to 
two additional trauma,

343
00:20:50,441 --> 00:20:53,200
but also that as they,
as they,

344
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:57,670
as the effects of their failure cascade,
say across their friendship,

345
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,270
interfere with their,
uh,

346
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,500
educational function,
interfere with their sleep.

347
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:07,770
The quality of their life overall is 
going to decline and that should also 

348
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:10,450
produce multiple small stressors that 
are going to compromise something,

349
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:15,540
including say that the decreased sleep 
and maybe also alterations and appetite 

350
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:20,581
and those might accumulate across time 
and produced the negative health 

351
00:21:20,581 --> 00:21:23,690
consequences as well.
And don't forget the little smoke more.

352
00:21:23,691 --> 00:21:25,270
Drink board,
take more drugs,

353
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:27,280
stop exercising.
Yes.

354
00:21:27,281 --> 00:21:30,100
Kids out there.
When you have a trauma,

355
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,840
uh,
take care of yourself.

356
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:32,980
You're right,
right,

357
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,640
right.
Yes,

358
00:21:33,641 --> 00:21:34,780
yes.
Yeah.

359
00:21:34,781 --> 00:21:35,200
Well,
I mean,

360
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:37,780
the first thing I do with my clinical 
clients generally speaking,

361
00:21:37,781 --> 00:21:42,781
is make sure that they're getting enough
sleep and try to reregulate they're 

362
00:21:42,781 --> 00:21:46,970
sleeping and also to make sure they eat 
breakfast at least because that,

363
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:52,050
that without those two things,
it's very difficult for someone to get 

364
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:52,180
themselves back on the straight and 
narrow.

365
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:57,630
So.
So now when we designed the self 

366
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,110
authoring program,
I think I had read,

367
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:02,740
I think it was researched by Laura King,
but I don't remember.

368
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:07,770
Somebody had taken your,
your writing exercises and applied them 

369
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:11,581
to the future.
Had people write about the future 

370
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:11,581
instead of the past and found similar 
effects.

371
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:12,730
Was that Laura King?
Do you remember?

372
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:18,990
What was interesting was that study you 
would think having people write what she

373
00:22:22,201 --> 00:22:22,310
did

374
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:27,460
I thought was she'd have people write 
about the past versus right about the 

375
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,641
future versus both.
And her idea was that having them write 

376
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:34,640
about both would be best because way 
therapy sometimes works in that way.

377
00:22:34,641 --> 00:22:39,641
so let's just work through your issues 
and what are the implications for the 

378
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:43,571
future.
She found That writing about both 

379
00:22:43,571 --> 00:22:46,750
actually wasn't very effective,
that having them write about the future 

380
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,740
was beneficial or just the pass was 
beneficial.

381
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:54,160
And since then there've been a lot of 
other studies looking at having people 

382
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,870
write about positive effects and,
or just negative.

383
00:22:56,871 --> 00:23:01,871
And what is generally found is that 
writing about positive effects is also 

384
00:23:01,911 --> 00:23:04,430
beneficial for health.
But the

385
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:08,120
kind of indicates is the thinking has 
been official for health.

386
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,690
I think that's,
that's true.

387
00:23:10,691 --> 00:23:12,800
And it's also like,

388
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,520
you know,
the best studies as I stand back and 

389
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:18,740
look at the kind of,
the broad,

390
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:19,890
uh,

391
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,640
panorama of cover search is giving 
people instructions to write really 

392
00:23:27,391 --> 00:23:32,391
loosely in the sense of here you write 
about the most traumatic experience of 

393
00:23:32,391 --> 00:23:37,011
your life,
but in a lot of people haven't had 

394
00:23:37,011 --> 00:23:37,011
traumas or maybe you've come to terms 
with traumas,

395
00:23:37,011 --> 00:23:40,350
but friday about those topics that are 
waiting upon you the most right now.

396
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:45,410
They may be positive,
may be negative if they may be most or a

397
00:23:45,411 --> 00:23:46,700
little bit of both.
And,

398
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:50,990
and essentially that's what I encourage 
people to do is to,

399
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,590
if you're having trouble sleeping,
you know,

400
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:58,810
set aside 15 minutes and just explore 
your thoughts and feelings about issues 

401
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:03,190
that are weighing on you.
Maybe something that you don't want to 

402
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:04,310
talk about or something you don't really
even want to address.

403
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,490
Yeah.
Yeah.

404
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,910
Well when we,
when we set up the run you by the latest

405
00:24:09,911 --> 00:24:13,630
research on the future authoring program
because you don't know about all of it.

406
00:24:13,631 --> 00:24:18,631
But um,
so basically what we've done with the 

407
00:24:18,631 --> 00:24:22,051
future authoring program,
which is the one with which now we've 

408
00:24:22,051 --> 00:24:25,290
administered to thousands of university 
students in different locales with very,

409
00:24:25,541 --> 00:24:29,080
very stable results.
And the results are quite remarkable,

410
00:24:29,081 --> 00:24:30,350
I think.
Um,

411
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,120
so the way the thing is structured is we
first get people to consider six 

412
00:24:36,221 --> 00:24:38,330
important dimensions of their life.
So we're,

413
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:43,350
we're kind of construing the individual 
as something that's distributed across 

414
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:43,850
dimensions,
practical dimensions.

415
00:24:43,851 --> 00:24:48,851
So those are um,
intimate relationship friendships,

416
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:53,590
family,
career education,

417
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:59,310
um,
time spent outside of work and use of 

418
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:01,210
drugs and alcohol because that's a 
rabbit hole.

419
00:25:01,211 --> 00:25:06,211
People can really go down and having a,
at least an idea of how you should 

420
00:25:06,211 --> 00:25:10,651
handle intoxicating substances is better
than just going into it blindly.

421
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,820
So the first thing we get people to 
write about and loosely following,

422
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:20,970
following that idea,
it's like a free association idea and 

423
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:20,970
psych gwen analysis,
right?

424
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,000
It's like,
but it also,

425
00:25:22,001 --> 00:25:25,030
I think,
frees people up to make mistakes because

426
00:25:25,031 --> 00:25:26,860
they get uptight if they have to do it 
right.

427
00:25:26,861 --> 00:25:27,640
You have to say,
look,

428
00:25:27,641 --> 00:25:29,590
you don't have to do it right.
You can do it badly.

429
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:34,800
It's better than not doing it at all,
so we have them write about to envision 

430
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:42,300
what they would like to take it,
have what they wanted on each of those 

431
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:42,300
domains,
so like,

432
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,200
okay,
it's three to five years down the road.

433
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:50,470
Imagine you're taking care of yourself 
and and as if you were someone you cared

434
00:25:50,471 --> 00:25:54,220
about and that things were set up 
optimally for you,

435
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,740
hypothetically,
what would that look like?

436
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:02,160
And what I found in my clinical practice
very frequently is that people are 

437
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,840
afraid of specifying their future 
because they're afraid of hope,

438
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:10,680
but also there's an avoidance element 
which is that once you specify your 

439
00:26:10,721 --> 00:26:15,721
criteria for success,
you've also specified your criteria for 

440
00:26:15,721 --> 00:26:15,721
failure.

441
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,850
If you keep things vague and ill 
defined,

442
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,880
then you can stumBle along without ever 
really noticing that you're lost and 

443
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,110
it's a really bad strategy in the medium
to longterm,

444
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,240
but I think it's effective as a means of
of well itself.

445
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:34,810
It's effective self deception in the 
short term anyways.

446
00:26:34,811 --> 00:26:39,811
they do that first and then we get them 
to write for 15 minutes with with no 

447
00:26:39,911 --> 00:26:43,060
concern for spelling or grammar,
which I think we took directly from your

448
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:47,480
and just just sketch out what life could
be like three,

449
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,880
three years down the road if they had 
what would be good for them.

450
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:56,400
All right,
so now that that also gives them 

451
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:56,960
something to aim for it.
And so one of,

452
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,280
one of the things that we've,
we've,

453
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:04,490
we've been thinking through with regards
to having something to aim for is the 

454
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:07,260
fact that the systems that utilize 
dopamine,

455
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,620
the incentive reward systems,
which,

456
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:13,380
which basically produced most of the 
positive emotion that have the kind that

457
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:18,381
people really liked only respond in 
relationship to a specified goal.

458
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:24,170
So you,
you feel an incentive reward kit when 

459
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:27,171
you're moving towards a value target.
And so if there's no value target,

460
00:27:27,301 --> 00:27:32,301
there's no positive emotion in lights 
except in consequence of direct 

461
00:27:32,641 --> 00:27:37,641
pleasure's sake.
But there's no ongoing excitement or 

462
00:27:37,641 --> 00:27:39,900
enthusiasm about tackling hard problems,
for example,

463
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:44,130
because there's no evidence that those 
are related to a value destination.

464
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:47,020
And it's the entire dopaminergic system 
that,

465
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:47,560
that,
that,

466
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,760
that responds to that.
And that's of course the system that 

467
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,701
cocaine and drugs like that effect.
And so then we do something else which 

468
00:27:55,701 --> 00:27:56,490
we've introduced more recently,
which is we say,

469
00:27:56,491 --> 00:27:57,800
okay,
now look you,

470
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:02,820
you specified the positive pole and that
gives you something to to run towards.

471
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,440
NoW we want you to think through the 
ways that the faults that you have and 

472
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:15,110
and they and the resentment and anger 
that you hold for whatever it is that 

473
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:19,911
you're angry about and resentful about 
an unhappy about and to consider your 

474
00:28:19,911 --> 00:28:24,210
bad habits and imagine where those could
drag you three to five years from now if

475
00:28:24,211 --> 00:28:26,160
you let them take the upper hand.

476
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:29,370
And so people write about that for 15 
minutes and we think,

477
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:34,371
well,
that gives them a negative pole to run 

478
00:28:34,371 --> 00:28:36,330
away from like a hell to run away from 
under heaven to run towards.

479
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:41,800
And there's some good evidence from the 
animal literature that animals that are 

480
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,080
running away and running towards.
At the same time,

481
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,840
our run faster,
they're more motivated.

482
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,850
And then in the second half they lay out
a,

483
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:54,380
a well articulated longterm 
implementable plan and we try to get 

484
00:28:54,841 --> 00:28:56,490
them to deeply articulated,
say,

485
00:28:56,491 --> 00:28:57,060
well,
you know,

486
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:02,720
drake it into eight goals,
rank order the goals if you attain goal 

487
00:29:03,211 --> 00:29:05,670
number one,
why would that be good for you?

488
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,600
Why would it be good for your family?
Why would it be good for broader 

489
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,841
society?
what would you do with obstacles or 

490
00:29:14,841 --> 00:29:14,841
rose?
Okay.

491
00:29:14,841 --> 00:29:17,991
So that's the pad.
And now at the university of rotterdam 

492
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,600
at the business school there.

493
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,310
So it's the rotterdam school of 
management.

494
00:29:23,311 --> 00:29:27,780
I've been working with mckayla,
shippers there and her colleagues.

495
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,930
We've run about 7,000
people through that now.

496
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:36,350
And they,
the research indicates there's a bunch 

497
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,020
of interesting things.
Um,

498
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:42,800
overall it's raised grade point average 
about 20 percent and drop drop dropout 

499
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,980
rate about 25 percent,
which is absolutely phenomenal.

500
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,770
Was larger effects that we would have 
imagined.

501
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,990
But the effects are quite interesting 
because,

502
00:29:49,991 --> 00:29:50,640
you know,
most,

503
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:55,720
most interventions you rate if there's a
distribution of performance,

504
00:29:55,870 --> 00:30:00,870
you,
you intervene and you raise the higher 

505
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:00,870
performing people even higher,
you know,

506
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,920
absent a ceiling effect.
Performance.

507
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:09,490
This has the opposite of stack,
it raises the lower end up and so at.

508
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:14,850
At rotterdam,
the students that were most positively 

509
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:18,331
affected were the ones who were 
performing the worst and there are the 

510
00:30:18,331 --> 00:30:21,640
way we divided them up by gender and and
ethnicity,

511
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,800
so male,
female obviously,

512
00:30:23,801 --> 00:30:28,480
but then we divided them into ethnic 
hollander's,

513
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:33,570
so mostly caucasian natives and then non
western ethnic minorities.

514
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:39,930
So the males were underperforming the 
females and then it was female dutch 

515
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:44,650
natives,
male dutch natives,

516
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,050
female nonwestern,
ethnic minorities,

517
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,200
male non western ethnic minorities.
There was a big gap between the dutch 

518
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,711
females said that non western ethnic 
minority men within two years of 

519
00:30:55,711 --> 00:30:59,470
completing the program,
non-ethnic western minority men past the

520
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:03,220
dutch women even though women also 
increased a little bit.

521
00:31:03,221 --> 00:31:08,221
Yeah.
So and then we replicated that more 

522
00:31:08,221 --> 00:31:10,621
recently in Canada at a little college 
called mohawk college and we found there

523
00:31:10,751 --> 00:31:15,751
that men were underperforming women 
again and then we divided them into how 

524
00:31:16,871 --> 00:31:19,750
well they were doing in high school 
before they came into college.

525
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:25,170
And the worst performing males were the 
ones who were doing poorly in university

526
00:31:25,541 --> 00:31:30,541
before they hit college or the sorry,
the males who were in high school and 

527
00:31:30,881 --> 00:31:35,881
who had the worst grades,
were those who improved most with the 

528
00:31:35,881 --> 00:31:37,770
use of the future authoring program and 
they all,

529
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:42,780
they did the whole thing in an hour 
badly in one session.

530
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,070
That's very impressive.
Could you send me a copy of that?

531
00:31:48,071 --> 00:31:49,630
I'd,
I'd love to see that.

532
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:50,410
No problem.

533
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,990
Copy the mohawk paper yet because it 
hasn't been released,

534
00:31:54,991 --> 00:31:57,390
but I can send you.
I'll send you the rest of them.

535
00:31:57,391 --> 00:31:57,870
But yeah,

536
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,700
that's be assaults because these are the
issues.

537
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:05,740
Of course I'm dealing with right now on 
here at the university of Texas trying 

538
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,320
to find out,
you know,

539
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:11,410
most of the interventions that we're are
looking at is essentially a mean at a 

540
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:16,480
lower social class.
Kids who are coming to college for the 

541
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,991
first time,
who faced so many obstacles that the 

542
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:21,470
upper middle class students aren't even 
aware exist.

543
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,950
Well we're,
we're,

544
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,270
we're trying to think through why this 
works.

545
00:32:25,271 --> 00:32:27,310
You know.
And so part of it is,

546
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:29,490
I think,
and I've thought this through a lot,

547
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:34,500
and part of it is I think that schools 
before college never require really 

548
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:41,150
require kids to make a decision and they
don't teach them how to make decisions.

549
00:32:41,151 --> 00:32:44,690
They never teach them that their life is
theirs to master,

550
00:32:44,691 --> 00:32:46,910
let's say,
and that they have to make a plan,

551
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:52,070
but that the plant has to serve them.
We also have a suspicion that maybe men 

552
00:32:52,161 --> 00:32:55,010
will work unless they have their own 
plan.

553
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,950
Maybe that's associated with trait 
agreeableness,

554
00:32:57,951 --> 00:32:59,990
although we were still investigating 
that,

555
00:32:59,991 --> 00:33:04,991
but there is no doubt that these,
at least as far as our research has 

556
00:33:04,991 --> 00:33:09,041
shown that these interventions,
the future planning interventions seem 

557
00:33:09,041 --> 00:33:12,070
to have a more salutary effect on men.
But the men are under performing,

558
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:12,570
you know.

559
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:15,830
So for some reason the women don't have 
the same problem,

560
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:20,831
but it's something like males won't work
unless they have their own reasons to 

561
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:26,420
which,
which wouldn't surprise me given that 

562
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:26,420
males are more disagreeable than 
females.

563
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,710
So it's certainly possible.
But you know,

564
00:33:28,711 --> 00:33:31,640
the,
the effects on dropout at mohawk college

565
00:33:31,641 --> 00:33:36,170
for walloping about 50 percent decrease 
in the first semester,

566
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:36,860
and we,
of course,

567
00:33:36,861 --> 00:33:41,861
that's when kids always drop out.
So there's something about having a 

568
00:33:41,861 --> 00:33:41,990
plan.
So we are thinking to that,

569
00:33:41,991 --> 00:33:46,991
what's happening is,
and this kinda goes back to your 

570
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:47,200
comments about both positive and 
negative emotion,

571
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:52,680
it's,
it seems to be something like 

572
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,251
uncertainty reduction and so and so that
reduces the effect of doubt,

573
00:33:54,861 --> 00:33:57,500
let's say.
And also tagging,

574
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,540
you know,
having the person designed a future,

575
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:04,541
they also want tags success with 
positive emotion and that carries them 

576
00:34:04,541 --> 00:34:07,230
forward potentially through obstacles.
So

577
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:12,490
yes,
it'd be very interesting to analyze the 

578
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:12,580
essays that these people wrote using,
uh,

579
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,270
using our computer program.

580
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,180
Yeah.
Well,

581
00:34:15,181 --> 00:34:16,650
you know,
I think we may have done that,

582
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,900
if I remember correctly,
we may have done that with,

583
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:20,070
uh,
with the,

584
00:34:20,071 --> 00:34:21,510
uh,
rotterdam study,

585
00:34:21,511 --> 00:34:26,511
but I'd have to look because we've used 
your l rwc a couple of times to look for

586
00:34:26,701 --> 00:34:28,570
the same sort of phenomena.
Um,

587
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:34,010
we've also done that to look at whether 
or not we could extract out big five 

588
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:38,181
traits from,
for writing samples and that's also 

589
00:34:38,181 --> 00:34:38,181
possible.

590
00:34:38,181 --> 00:34:42,190
So sometimes I'm less sanguine about the
big five approach because language and 

591
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,810
self reports are really,
really different animals.

592
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,350
Yeah.
well,

593
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:55,000
I'd like to talk to you now if you would
about,

594
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,990
um,
about your now you,

595
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:02,040
you,
you did the computer analysis and words 

596
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,040
and that got you interested in different
categories of words.

597
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,690
Correct.
And a whole book on pronouns.

598
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:08,440
Part of the reason I want to talk to you
about pronouns,

599
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:10,210
apart from the fact that I'm interested 
in this,

600
00:35:10,211 --> 00:35:15,211
I'd been embroiled in a political 
controversy in Canada for the last five 

601
00:35:15,211 --> 00:35:18,790
months that they,
there's been legislation here formulated

602
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:20,820
at the federal level.
It's already in place,

603
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:25,360
provincial level mandating the use of 
what had been called preferred pronouns.

604
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:30,570
And I don't know if that's come to the 
university of Texas at austin or not 

605
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:31,930
yet,
but the idea is that people have,

606
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,840
um,
a nonspecific gender,

607
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:39,870
let's say,
have the right to choose pronouns by 

608
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:42,921
which other people will address them.
And that's actually been mandated and 

609
00:35:42,921 --> 00:35:44,010
canadian law,
which is something I'd been objecting to

610
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:49,130
sephora asleep because I don't believe 
the government should mandate language 

611
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,610
content.
I think it's a massive error,

612
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,980
but.
But anyway,

613
00:35:51,981 --> 00:35:56,981
so I have a specific interest in 
pronouns and I know also the pronouns 

614
00:35:56,981 --> 00:36:00,150
are in a closed linguistic categories,
so they don't change that frequently.

615
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:05,510
But he wrote a whole book describing why
pronouns were so significant from a 

616
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:05,550
psychological perspective.

617
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:08,050
Right?
And it's more,

618
00:36:08,051 --> 00:36:13,051
it's not just pronouns,
it's a whole class of words called 

619
00:36:13,051 --> 00:36:14,950
function words.
And if you look at any text,

620
00:36:14,951 --> 00:36:19,240
are you listening very carefully?
Most of what we convey our,

621
00:36:19,241 --> 00:36:24,241
what we call content words.
These are nouns and regular verbs and 

622
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,730
adjectives.
Most adverts,

623
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,400
and they're there,
the guts of what we're talking about,

624
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:36,100
but we have all these little words,
articles and the prepositions to have 

625
00:36:36,251 --> 00:36:37,720
for pronouns.
He,

626
00:36:37,721 --> 00:36:38,470
she,
they,

627
00:36:38,471 --> 00:36:39,650
it,
et cetera.

628
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:44,140
And in english,
there's only about 180 common pronouns.

629
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:47,500
Now the average person has vocabuLary of
100,000

630
00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:52,501
words,
but only less than one half of one 

631
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:56,290
percent of those words are these 
function words.

632
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:59,230
Yet they account for 60 percent of all 
the words we use,

633
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:04,290
they are,
they control how we talk and what they 

634
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:07,880
are specifying is how we connect with 
one another they are,

635
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:13,060
and how we connect with our topic and 
how we think about ourselves and our 

636
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,710
group.
And by analyzing these function words,

637
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:20,050
you get a really good sense of who a 
person is and that that's the underlying

638
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:25,140
theory of the work I've been doing for 
the last several years using this 

639
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,510
computer program,
which is linguistic inquiries,

640
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,140
word count l,
iwc,

641
00:37:29,141 --> 00:37:34,141
which I pronounced luke.
And the loop program is really just a 

642
00:37:34,141 --> 00:37:36,430
dumb program that it mostly is looking 
at these function words.

643
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:38,840
So.
So tell us some things that you've found

644
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:42,120
with specific words.
So,

645
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:43,740
so,
um,

646
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:49,180
let's start off with,
with the most commonly used spoken word,

647
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:54,210
which is the word I,
I tells us so much about people.

648
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:59,550
And if you go into your email,
you're going to see that you use it 

649
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,400
sometimes.
Sometimes in an email you will.

650
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:06,150
So for example,
people who are depressed use the word I 

651
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,560
more than when they're not depressed.
People who are suicidal,

652
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:13,620
is it even more so,
one of our first studies was looking at 

653
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,310
poet,
so either committed suicide or didn't.

654
00:38:14,311 --> 00:38:19,311
And we analyze their poetry.
The suicidal poets did not use more 

655
00:38:19,311 --> 00:38:23,791
negative emotion words.
They didn't make more references to 

656
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:24,010
death.
They used the word I more and why?

657
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:29,280
Because pronouns,
including telling us where we're paying 

658
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,500
attention or if you used the word I 
yourself focused and we,

659
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:36,690
and you know,
as a clinician that what are the 

660
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,310
theories of depression is that it's a 
disease of self focused at people are so

661
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,320
ruminative and looking inwards.
So much

662
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,530
so.
So let me ask you,

663
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,480
let me ask you a question about that.
So if that seems related to the,

664
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:52,840
to the psychometric finding that self 
consciousness is a facet of neuroticism.

665
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:57,310
Uh,

666
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:01,110
let me ask you one other question along 
with that.

667
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:06,260
but,
so because self conscIousness seems to 

668
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,661
load with the negative emotions,
but also one of the things that I often 

669
00:39:08,661 --> 00:39:12,591
recommend to my clinical clients who are
socially anxious because I've watched 

670
00:39:12,631 --> 00:39:15,270
how they interact and because they get 
so focused,

671
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:18,630
they don't look at other people.
They don't look at theIr face,

672
00:39:18,631 --> 00:39:23,631
for example,
and that's thinking about how other 

673
00:39:23,631 --> 00:39:26,250
people are looking at them and they're 
busy thinking about what to say next,

674
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:31,520
and so what happens is they stopped 
looking at the face of the people that 

675
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,330
they're there,
they're talking to or listening to them,

676
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:38,630
and so then they're extraordinarily 
awkward and so what I've done is instead

677
00:39:38,731 --> 00:39:41,550
of telling people to stop thinking about
themselves,

678
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:45,240
the set,
when you enter a conversation really,

679
00:39:45,241 --> 00:39:50,241
really focused on the other people push 
you attention outward because that seems

680
00:39:50,461 --> 00:39:55,020
to activate their unconscious and 
automatize professional,

681
00:39:55,021 --> 00:40:00,021
let's say social skills and then you can
flow with the conversation.

682
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:04,760
That's exactly right,
and and to build on this,

683
00:40:04,761 --> 00:40:08,240
the idea of people who are leaders and 
status,

684
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:13,330
if you look at the two people you can,
you can tell with remarkable accuracy 

685
00:40:13,341 --> 00:40:17,240
who's the higher status by the person 
who uses fewer eyes.

686
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,820
The high Status person doesn't use the 
word I much.

687
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:24,960
The lower status person does it because 
the high status person is looking out at

688
00:40:25,431 --> 00:40:27,650
the world and the lower status person 
is.

689
00:40:27,651 --> 00:40:32,060
Your pointed out is looking inward and 
you could take this to the bank,

690
00:40:32,061 --> 00:40:35,180
go look at your emails and you'll see 
when you're writing to someone of higher

691
00:40:35,181 --> 00:40:37,360
status,
you tend to use I'm or,

692
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,470
and when you're writing to someone with 
lower status,

693
00:40:39,471 --> 00:40:42,650
you use it less so it's so.

694
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,790
Okay,
so let me.

695
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,700
Okay.
Let me tell you another observation that

696
00:40:46,701 --> 00:40:49,130
I had.
You tell me what you think about this.

697
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,320
I'm going to tell you what to tell you 
about a,

698
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:56,630
an observation from animation first.
So I've done some very in depth analysis

699
00:40:56,631 --> 00:41:01,631
of various disney movies including the 
lion king and the lion king involves on 

700
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:08,040
a child and then an adolescent lion who 
matures and so and the animators also 

701
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:17,200
represented his father.
Now his father has a very interesting 

702
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,730
face because it looks like this,
like it's,

703
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:22,040
it's,
it's focused forward and kind of staring

704
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:27,070
almost.
You were almost predatory because of 

705
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:27,070
predatory gaze.
Gazes locked on someone else,

706
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:27,960
but.
And then the,

707
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:33,260
the adolescent lion who's kind of naive 
and imbecilic in some sense is like this

708
00:41:34,071 --> 00:41:39,071
all the time.
And so it seems to me that there's a 

709
00:41:39,071 --> 00:41:42,611
relationship between immaturity and and 
self focus and maturity and outward 

710
00:41:43,731 --> 00:41:46,280
focus and in the lion king,
where when,

711
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,490
when the adolescent lion undergoes this 
initiation,

712
00:41:49,491 --> 00:41:54,491
right,
his face changes into one like this and 

713
00:41:54,491 --> 00:41:55,070
do one of determination.

714
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:59,300
And the other thing that,
that seems related to this is that,

715
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,020
you know,
when,

716
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:01,940
when people are speaking in front of a 
group,

717
00:42:01,941 --> 00:42:06,941
they often get self conscious and they 
feel all the eyes on them and that makes

718
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:12,491
them self conscious.
And one of the things that I've 

719
00:42:12,491 --> 00:42:14,381
recommended to people who want to speak 
to groups is never to speak to the 

720
00:42:14,381 --> 00:42:17,441
group,
just to look at one individual and then 

721
00:42:17,441 --> 00:42:19,340
another individual and then another 
individual because that,

722
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,680
well that seems to foster communication,
but it also blows out the probability of

723
00:42:24,681 --> 00:42:26,700
becoming self conscious.
So

724
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,360
that's exactly.
That's exactly right.

725
00:42:28,361 --> 00:42:32,170
In fact,
I have recommended to teacher trainers.

726
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:35,380
So here's what you do at my university 
for teacher training.

727
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,310
You give a a practice lecture and you 
have the,

728
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:44,110
the camera is in the audience looking at
you.

729
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:49,380
That's the wrong way to do it.
The way that you should train teachers 

730
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,321
is put a camera behind the teacher at 
the audience and point out afterwards,

731
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,190
look,
they're not.

732
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:57,890
That guy's not paying attention to you.
That person is and the net.

733
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:00,470
In other words,
not making yourself focus,

734
00:43:00,471 --> 00:43:04,190
making you that.
If you're training the teacher training,

735
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,640
a public speaker doing exactly what 
you're saying,

736
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:11,940
you should give them the view of the 
what the audience looks like and not 

737
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,170
what you look like.
That's the exact wrong training.

738
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,370
Absolutely.
Okay,

739
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:19,500
so tell me what you think about this.
When I'm lecturing,

740
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,620
I pay attention to the people who are 
paying attention.

741
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,070
Now,
most of the time,

742
00:43:26,071 --> 00:43:28,380
most people in my lectures are paying 
attention,

743
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:30,150
at least a reasonable proportion of 
them,

744
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,670
but the ones that aren't,
well,

745
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:35,370
I don't know why they're not here,
but there's lots of reasons.

746
00:43:35,371 --> 00:43:37,560
They might've had a bad night.
They might be overtired,

747
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,330
they may have taken the chorus by 
mistake.

748
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:44,360
I mean god only knows,
but if I paid attention to the students 

749
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:47,700
that are paying attention,
then I can read off their faces.

750
00:43:47,701 --> 00:43:50,940
How the audience is thinking,
especially if I glance around,

751
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:55,970
but it's that intense communication from
individual to individual but seems to 

752
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:59,130
make a lecturer or an interview or a 
conversation really compelling.

753
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:04,900
That's exactly right.
And I think that's the secret to what 

754
00:44:04,941 --> 00:44:09,941
are the secrets to being a good teacher 
and a good speaker is really being able 

755
00:44:10,011 --> 00:44:12,830
to watch.
And when also to the judge,

756
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:14,940
when all of a sudden you're starting to 
lose,

757
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:16,100
you know,
you're,

758
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,980
you're also doing little experiments the
whole time.

759
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:20,090
Uh,
you know,

760
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:25,091
one of the things that people who are 
relatively new is they start to lose 

761
00:44:25,091 --> 00:44:26,840
people and then they start speaking more
quickly,

762
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:30,140
which of course is precisely the wrong 
thing to do

763
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:32,010
and they start less attention

764
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,040
because they get self conscious and want
to hide from the audience.

765
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:38,400
And then they get into a loop and things
just go,

766
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,240
you know,
the,

767
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:42,880
the worst speakers I'd ever seen stand 
at the front of the,

768
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:46,920
of the audience with your head down and 
mumble at their feet.

769
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,840
It's just painful.
I mean.

770
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:51,480
okay.
Okay.

771
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:53,250
So that's very interesting.
So,

772
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:54,510
okay,
so you talked about,

773
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:59,950
you talked about dominance.
What else have you learned about 

774
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:00,220
specific words?
Um,

775
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:01,930
well,
a couple more things about.

776
00:45:01,931 --> 00:45:05,890
I mixed with some others.
One is his honesty,

777
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:11,100
so the ability to detect deception 
versus honesty as a function of how 

778
00:45:11,531 --> 00:45:16,531
people talk and what we find is that 
we've done many studies where we induced

779
00:45:17,201 --> 00:45:22,201
people to lie and tell the truth and 
then we look at the transcripts of the 

780
00:45:22,201 --> 00:45:25,961
two.
When we find iS when people tell the 

781
00:45:25,961 --> 00:45:28,621
truth,
they tend to use it more that they're 

782
00:45:28,621 --> 00:45:30,720
owning what they're saying and the 
person who was lying is psychologically 

783
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:35,011
distancing,
distancing themselves from what you're 

784
00:45:35,011 --> 00:45:35,011
saying.

785
00:45:35,011 --> 00:45:36,730
And then there's another feature is when
you're telling the truth,

786
00:45:36,731 --> 00:45:41,731
you tend to use more words that are.
We used to call them exclusive words or 

787
00:45:42,251 --> 00:45:45,400
differentiation words where you use 
words like except,

788
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:50,520
but without exclude word for you making 
a distinction between west inner 

789
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:55,080
category and not in a category that 
these exclusive kind of words are.

790
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:01,910
You're being more honest because you're 
saying what you did but also what you 

791
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:06,160
didn't do.
And that's a really complex cognitive 

792
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,731
tasks.
Whereas if you're lying and you didn't 

793
00:46:08,731 --> 00:46:11,521
do any of it,
just say what you did not do is just 

794
00:46:11,521 --> 00:46:16,240
beyond the capabilities of most people.
So both,

795
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:21,350
uh,
I were usage in these exclusive words 

796
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:21,620
together do a pretty good job.
And,

797
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:24,510
and another one is also focusing on 
details.

798
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:27,130
So if you do there with political 
speeches.

799
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:29,380
Oh yeah.
And there had been some,

800
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:32,020
there's been some nice research on that 
as well.

801
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:34,030
Jeff hancock,
for example,

802
00:46:34,031 --> 00:46:36,880
is not.
Stanford has played with this idea quite

803
00:46:36,881 --> 00:46:41,881
a bit when he was looking at all of the 
rhetoric about what weapons of mass 

804
00:46:41,881 --> 00:46:46,210
destruction during the bush 
administration that their,

805
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:51,380
that what he found was the 
administrators were being using 

806
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:52,870
deceptive language,
uh,

807
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,190
prior to,
uh,

808
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,610
to the u.
S were before prior to our going to war.

809
00:46:57,810 --> 00:46:58,100
Huh.

810
00:46:58,950 --> 00:46:59,940
So,
so,

811
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:04,950
so that opens up a whole completely 
appalling,

812
00:47:05,171 --> 00:47:10,171
an interesting scenario.
It's like me increasingly people are 

813
00:47:10,171 --> 00:47:13,110
using computer programs to analyze 
personality and that sort of thing by,

814
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:16,690
by analyzing people's behavior on the 
web.

815
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:18,630
That's exactly right.
And,

816
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,040
and we've been done,
been doing this a lot with,

817
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:21,830
with,
uh,

818
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,400
a political figures and if,
in fact I'm one of my graduate students 

819
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:28,090
and like caitlyn,
Jordan,

820
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:30,760
how we've been,
we have a website,

821
00:47:30,761 --> 00:47:35,290
it's called birdwatchers word 
watchers.wordpress.com.

822
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:36,730
And like,
go in there,

823
00:47:36,731 --> 00:47:41,320
you can see our analysis of trump.
And actually this whole election from,

824
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,420
from,
uh,

825
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:47,910
from my perspective as a scientist,
this has been a phenomenal electoral 

826
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:51,070
season as a human being.
Not so much,

827
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:52,240
but

828
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,360
I'm going to get you,
when we're done here,

829
00:47:55,361 --> 00:47:57,610
I'll email you and you could give me 
some links.

830
00:47:57,611 --> 00:48:02,611
Okay.
That I can put in a description here 

831
00:48:02,611 --> 00:48:02,611
where people can go look this sort of 
thing up.

832
00:48:02,611 --> 00:48:04,030
You bet.
So that's interesting.

833
00:48:04,031 --> 00:48:09,031
So can you,
can you actually rank order politicians 

834
00:48:09,031 --> 00:48:09,520
in terms of the probability that they're
telling the truth?

835
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,730
I'm not.
So we have,

836
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,940
yes,
I could,

837
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:23,120
but I'm not sure I trust it very much 
because one of the interesting issues 

838
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:27,531
about deception is you've got some 
people who are deceptive,

839
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:32,780
who are deceptive,
but they honestly believe they're 

840
00:48:33,061 --> 00:48:34,980
telling the truth.
And I think,

841
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:38,130
I think trump actually falls into that 
category.

842
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:41,580
I think he actually believes what he 
says.

843
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:46,850
Eddie might say just the opposite 10 
minutes later and he'll believe that as 

844
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:46,850
well.

845
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:47,290
Yeah.
So do you suppose?

846
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:47,680
No.
Okay.

847
00:48:47,681 --> 00:48:50,320
So that's interesting because I've seen 
in,

848
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:54,460
in poorly written undergraduate essays 
you commonly see,

849
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:59,700
I think about it as fracturing at 
different levels of the linguistic 

850
00:48:59,700 --> 00:48:59,700
hierarchy.
So you know,

851
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:01,550
if you listen to his schizophrenia 
speak,

852
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:04,270
they're actually fractured at the level 
of the frames.

853
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:10,230
And then if you listen to a manic speak,
they're more like fractured out the 

854
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:12,100
level of the sentence or the paragraph 
they can say a whole paragraph.

855
00:49:12,101 --> 00:49:14,860
And then the next paragraph they'll say 
something completely different.

856
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:20,130
It contradicts the first paragraph,
but there's no awareness of the 

857
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:22,000
contradiction and poorly written 
undergraduate essays.

858
00:49:22,001 --> 00:49:27,001
There'll be a claim made on page one and
then a claim made john made on page two 

859
00:49:27,001 --> 00:49:29,710
that are completely antithetical.
And you know,

860
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:35,060
it isn't self evident that you become 
conscious of paradoxes in your thinking 

861
00:49:36,011 --> 00:49:41,011
unless you act out both propositions 
simultaneously and it produces a 

862
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:44,800
conflict because you can hold paradoxes 
recommendation without ever knowing it.

863
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:50,150
And so maybe maybe what happens with 
someone who who does that sort of 

864
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:55,330
contradictory speech is temperamentally,
they're very confident.

865
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,520
So they might be assertive,
for example,

866
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:03,400
something like that and maybe also low 
end or high end stress tolerance.

867
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:05,550
So they're not anxious.
People are,

868
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:08,680
they're assertive and they don't really 
care so much what other people think.

869
00:50:08,681 --> 00:50:13,681
So they come across continually as 
confident and so that would be more 

870
00:50:13,681 --> 00:50:16,240
temperamental confidence which is,
which is a form.

871
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:19,570
It's a funny thing because it's not 
exactly the same as telling the truth,

872
00:50:19,571 --> 00:50:24,571
but it is something more like believing 
what you say or believing in what you 

873
00:50:24,571 --> 00:50:24,571
say.

874
00:50:24,571 --> 00:50:29,140
That's right.
And what I think that the text approach 

875
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:31,910
is better at is when a person knows damn
well they're telling,

876
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:33,870
telling a lie,
and,

877
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:39,070
and that's when our tails do better.
There's another phenomenon is called a 

878
00:50:40,401 --> 00:50:45,401
performative.
That's one of my favorite that you can 

879
00:50:45,401 --> 00:50:48,000
you hear.
And that is performatives are used in 

880
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:52,820
linguistics and they're usually a phrase
and they might be something like,

881
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,210
let me assure you,
or as I said before,

882
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:01,360
or believed me when I say,
and if you have a performative,

883
00:51:01,521 --> 00:51:06,521
it makes the entire sentence and you're 
not able to detect if it's true or not.

884
00:51:08,991 --> 00:51:13,991
So you can't establish the truth value.
Let me assure you that this is a glass 

885
00:51:14,391 --> 00:51:15,740
of water.
Now,

886
00:51:15,741 --> 00:51:17,630
is that true or not?
Well,

887
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,680
it's.
Yes,

888
00:51:18,681 --> 00:51:20,690
actually it is because I want,
you know,

889
00:51:20,691 --> 00:51:22,820
I want to assure you that a glass of 
water,

890
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:25,910
it's true because I want to assure you 
that,

891
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:28,290
that it is,
even though it's not,

892
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:33,830
what happens is consciously we don't 
know we do this,

893
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:39,040
but it's almost so our brain is kind of 
trying to protect us and we throw these 

894
00:51:40,221 --> 00:51:45,221
up and I have another webpage that has a
number of performatives that you see in 

895
00:51:47,031 --> 00:51:52,031
president after president where the 
president says something that the 

896
00:51:52,031 --> 00:51:54,260
beginning sets it up.

897
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:56,480
So it's performative and then the second
half.

898
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:58,320
Sure enough,
isn't it?

899
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,540
It is a lie.

900
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:01,150
Yeah.
Well,

901
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,650
so do you suppose that.
Okay,

902
00:52:02,651 --> 00:52:03,960
that's interesting.
So do you,

903
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:09,210
do you suppose that.
So is the performative a marker for,

904
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,380
for,
for deceit,

905
00:52:12,381 --> 00:52:12,870
isn't it,

906
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:13,440
is it,
is?

907
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,860
I think it is,
yeah.

908
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:19,120
So I think it is and it's edited fact.
In fact,

909
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:23,200
trump's great.
His best word is believe me.

910
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:25,790
So,
um,

911
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:29,290
I know more about the army than the 
generals,

912
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:30,610
believe me.
Right,

913
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,510
right.
Was quite interesting.

914
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:35,290
He is,
and it's,

915
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:38,380
it is.
It's a form of performative,

916
00:52:38,381 --> 00:52:43,381
which is he's really saying please 
believe me that I know more that the 

917
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,180
doctor,
that he doesn't use it that way,

918
00:52:46,181 --> 00:52:48,110
but that's what it essentially is.
So it's,

919
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:53,560
it kind of makes you wonder if he thinks
that if people believe in that makes it 

920
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:53,560
true.
Yeah,

921
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,660
exactly.
It's a funny thing because there is some

922
00:52:56,661 --> 00:52:58,220
truth to the idea that

923
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,090
true things are what other people 
believe.

924
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:07,890
No,
obviously you don't want to go too far 

925
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:08,700
down that road,
but there is something,

926
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:12,810
I mean because for example,
a contract holds no truth unless there's

927
00:53:12,811 --> 00:53:17,811
consensus around it.
So whenever the reality is dependent on 

928
00:53:17,811 --> 00:53:22,791
everyone agreeing to do the same thing,
then consensus is actually a very good 

929
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:25,650
marker for truth,
you know,

930
00:53:25,651 --> 00:53:27,540
because there's lots of situations where
you say,

931
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:29,970
well if we agree on all this then it's 
going to be true.

932
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:33,030
That's what a contract is.
So,

933
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,330
so it's,
it's almost as if using words like that,

934
00:53:36,331 --> 00:53:41,331
it's an attempt to establish a contract 
where no contract can genuinely be 

935
00:53:41,521 --> 00:53:46,521
established.
I mean we can have a contract about 

936
00:53:46,521 --> 00:53:46,590
whether or not Iran has weapons of mass 
destruction,

937
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:51,680
but we can certainly have a contract 
about whether or not we'll go to war 

938
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:51,680
over it.

939
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,020
Yeah.

940
00:53:54,490 --> 00:53:56,550
With regards to two interesting words.

941
00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:59,460
Well there's a,
there's a whole.

942
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:05,500
We could go for hours on this actually.
So another one that I've been quite 

943
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:09,501
interested in is using these groups of 
words and looking at how to people 

944
00:54:10,561 --> 00:54:14,640
connect and in terms of these function 
words.

945
00:54:14,641 --> 00:54:19,641
So what we could do is we can actually 
calculate the percentage agreement we 

946
00:54:19,641 --> 00:54:23,100
have in our use of pronouns.
Prepositions are those articles,

947
00:54:23,101 --> 00:54:28,101
conjunctions and so forth.
And we call this language style 

948
00:54:28,101 --> 00:54:29,520
matching.
And the closer to people are in their,

949
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:33,330
in their use of these words,
in any given conversation,

950
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:38,750
uh,
the more they are in tune with each 

951
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:38,750
other

952
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:39,550
being on the same wavelength.

953
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:45,230
That's exactly right.
And it's not necessarily liking one 

954
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:48,360
another,
it's been absolutely paying attention to

955
00:54:48,361 --> 00:54:53,361
one another.
So two people in the midst of an 

956
00:54:53,361 --> 00:54:54,870
argument tend to entrain really closely,
just like two people madly in love.

957
00:54:55,470 --> 00:55:00,470
Now we've done analysis of transcripts 
of a speed dates and what we find is we 

958
00:55:01,771 --> 00:55:06,771
actually can predict who will go into 
subsequent date at race somewhat higher 

959
00:55:06,771 --> 00:55:07,500
than the people themselves.

960
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:10,910
So what's happening is the rapid 
establishment of mutual limitation.

961
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:14,540
That's exactly right,
exactly what happens from the australian

962
00:55:14,541 --> 00:55:16,610
perspective when two children start to 
play.

963
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:22,420
That's exactly right.
And we've looked at a.

964
00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:24,990
One that I particularly liked was we 
studied,

965
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:30,020
we looked at 86 dating couples.
He's a freshman in college and freshman 

966
00:55:30,211 --> 00:55:33,780
in college are in notoriously unstable 
relationships,

967
00:55:33,781 --> 00:55:38,730
which from my perspective is perfect for
research and wait to be in our studies.

968
00:55:38,731 --> 00:55:43,230
They had to do instant messaging at 
least daily with each other.

969
00:55:43,231 --> 00:55:48,231
And to give Us 10 days of their igms,
which they did and what we did,

970
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:51,430
and we also ask them how good is your 
relationship?

971
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:54,000
How likely will you be together in 
several months?

972
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:59,570
And what we found was that we did a 
shockingly good job at predicting who's 

973
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:03,240
still be together.
Those people who were just average gut,

974
00:56:03,241 --> 00:56:07,710
their their style matching score,
their average treatment score,

975
00:56:07,711 --> 00:56:10,470
and we just got the top half,
80 percent.

976
00:56:10,471 --> 00:56:12,570
We're still together.
Three months later,

977
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:14,910
if they were in the bottom half,
only 50 percent.

978
00:56:14,911 --> 00:56:19,911
We're still together.
And self-reports people's self reports 

979
00:56:21,631 --> 00:56:26,631
about their relationship was absolutely 
unrelated to whether or not they were 

980
00:56:26,631 --> 00:56:29,070
still together.
That's like dancing videos.

981
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,780
I've already started it.

982
00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:34,310
That's exactly right.
So,

983
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:39,600
so what that really means in some sense 
is that it this way is that the two 

984
00:56:41,401 --> 00:56:44,880
people come together and the two of 
them,

985
00:56:45,210 --> 00:56:48,270
it's as if they're making something,
they make something jointly,

986
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:52,290
that they're both acting out so that 
they're uniting into something central.

987
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:55,440
Then you might think too that in order 
for that to happen,

988
00:56:55,770 --> 00:56:57,780
they have to be paying close attention 
to each other.

989
00:56:58,830 --> 00:57:03,830
And so you can't train with someone 
unless you pay close attention to them 

990
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:08,340
and certainly one of the best markers 
for the utility of the relationship is 

991
00:57:08,701 --> 00:57:10,800
going to be whether or not the people 
pay attention to each other.

992
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:15,870
Right?
Finding that's why children are so 

993
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:16,160
absolutely desperate for adult 
attention.

994
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:19,430
That's their currency.
That's exactly right.

995
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:21,840
Wow,
that's really cool.

996
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:23,460
Well,
if you go to another one,

997
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:28,670
because I've got another one,
a few,

998
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:35,530
three or four years ago,
I started working with much bigger 

999
00:57:35,530 --> 00:57:35,960
dataset.
So this was with,

1000
00:57:35,961 --> 00:57:38,000
uh,
about 25,000

1001
00:57:38,001 --> 00:57:43,001
college students who have been admitted 
to my university over four years and I 

1002
00:57:44,091 --> 00:57:49,091
got their admissions essays and these 
essays are people's explaining why they 

1003
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:50,300
want to come to the university,
you know,

1004
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:54,050
how they have overcome a difficult time 
or something like that.

1005
00:57:54,051 --> 00:57:57,940
So each person wrote two essays and a,

1006
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:03,750
we went through and started to do some 
kind of a general analysis of word.

1007
00:58:03,751 --> 00:58:08,751
You're focusing on these function worms 
and found that there was a central 

1008
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:12,591
dimension to language.
And this is a fundamental dimension and 

1009
00:58:12,591 --> 00:58:16,110
it's when I'm calling it is analytic 
versus narrative thinking.

1010
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:21,800
People high on analytic thinking are 
using high rates of articles and 

1011
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:25,521
prepositions at the other end of this 
dimension are people who are using high 

1012
00:58:25,521 --> 00:58:26,940
rates of pronouns on zillow,
reverbs,

1013
00:58:26,941 --> 00:58:28,290
conjunctions,
negotiations,

1014
00:58:28,291 --> 00:58:33,291
and so forth.
it is a coherent dimension and that any 

1015
00:58:33,291 --> 00:58:38,151
texts is,
can be put along this continuum and in 

1016
00:58:38,151 --> 00:58:38,910
fact,
it's like a fingerprint.

1017
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:40,820
People who,
you know,

1018
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:46,020
use words at this level tend to do so in
other,

1019
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:50,790
in other emails,
other emails or natural conversation,

1020
00:58:50,791 --> 00:58:55,791
et cetera.
So are the narrative people using 

1021
00:58:55,791 --> 00:58:55,791
metaphors?
Yeah,

1022
00:58:55,791 --> 00:58:57,420
they probably would have.

1023
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:00,710
So tell me how you would tell the 
difference.

1024
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:02,400
Well,
as I said before,

1025
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:07,440
before we get into metaphors,
metaphors are going to take us down a 

1026
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:07,440
rabbit hole.
So let's,

1027
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:07,440
uh,
let's,

1028
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,230
let's,
before we fall down the hole,

1029
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:11,140
let me just point out this analytic 
thinking.

1030
00:59:11,141 --> 00:59:16,141
What's so cool about it is we were able 
to track these students grades over the 

1031
00:59:16,141 --> 00:59:19,681
next four years of college.
And the higher they were on analytic 

1032
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:21,130
thinking,
the better they did in college.

1033
00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:24,570
And in terms of grades,
it was correlated about point two.

1034
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:28,610
And it didn't matter if they were 
physics majors or fine art majors,

1035
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,700
if they were in engineering,
psychology,

1036
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:33,500
uh,
music,

1037
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:36,020
uh,
social work that this,

1038
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:41,110
you could take this to the bank.
The more analytical person is in their 

1039
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:42,110
essay,
the better they do in college.

1040
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:45,500
And part of it is as colleges based on,
on analytic thinking.

1041
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:48,440
But it's also correlated with 
intelligence.

1042
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:50,720
It's correlated with sat,
which,

1043
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,290
uh,
probably about point three,

1044
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:55,560
point three five.
Oh yeah,

1045
00:59:55,590 --> 00:59:57,490
that's pretty good.
That's it.

1046
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:00,120
It's really quite striking.
And what's interesting is,

1047
01:00:00,121 --> 01:00:05,121
is that we can now use this as kind of a
remote sensor to get a sense of how 

1048
01:00:05,841 --> 01:00:08,180
smart somebody is.
So for analyzing,

1049
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:11,150
you're a dangerous man.
I'm a dangerous man.

1050
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,660
Parents.
yeah.

1051
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:17,940
Yeah.
So that's another one that we've been 

1052
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:19,180
playing with many other things.
We've been doing a lot of work on author

1053
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:22,970
identification.
So we published a cool article,

1054
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:24,980
one of my graduate students,
Ryan Boyd,

1055
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,180
and I've been focusing on last,
uh,

1056
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:33,210
last play or a play that was attributed 
to shakespeare with people didn't know 

1057
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:35,630
if it was or not.
And we were able to do some really smart

1058
01:00:35,631 --> 01:00:39,740
analysis showing pretty clearly that it 
was written by shakespeare,

1059
01:00:39,741 --> 01:00:42,350
probably coauthored with another guy,
John Fletcher,

1060
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:47,830
and we,
and we looked at some other manuscripts 

1061
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:50,130
that have been called into question that
have come out of the 17th century it.

1062
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:54,440
so we know we've been taking this work 
in all of these different directions.

1063
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:56,370
Cool.
Okay.

1064
01:00:56,371 --> 01:01:01,371
So let's close thIs off by.
Why don't you tell us something about 

1065
01:01:01,371 --> 01:01:02,700
what you're doing with regards to 
revamping,

1066
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:07,990
um,
undergraduate education at the 

1067
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:09,801
university of Texas and what you and 
what your aims are and also why it was 

1068
01:01:09,801 --> 01:01:10,230
that you were.

1069
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:17,420
Exactly.
It all gets into my analysis of 

1070
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:22,211
language.
I was doing all of this work trying to 

1071
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:24,320
understand could I get a say a group of 
initially to people,

1072
01:01:24,321 --> 01:01:29,321
but then it's been five people to 
interact with one another on the 

1073
01:01:29,321 --> 01:01:33,641
computer and if so,
can I track how they are interacting 

1074
01:01:34,581 --> 01:01:39,581
with each other and get a sense of how 
the group was working and working with 

1075
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:45,071
some computer scientists.
We were able to come up with a really 

1076
01:01:45,071 --> 01:01:45,830
slick program to do that.
Then it occurred to me,

1077
01:01:45,831 --> 01:01:50,831
would it be interesting to do that in a 
large class because I taught a large 

1078
01:01:50,831 --> 01:01:52,070
introductory psychology class with a 
colleague of mine,

1079
01:01:52,071 --> 01:01:56,000
sam gosling,
and we had 500 students in the class.

1080
01:01:56,001 --> 01:02:01,001
We had them bring a laptop to class one 
day and we were able to break the class 

1081
01:02:01,161 --> 01:02:03,290
into small groups of five each.

1082
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:08,890
They could interact with each other and 
we were able to track how they were 

1083
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:14,590
interacting and we get feedback to the 
group trying to get the group to work 

1084
01:02:14,590 --> 01:02:19,241
better,
so we using this style matching and we 

1085
01:02:19,241 --> 01:02:21,491
can tell people whether or not people,
the members of the group were paying 

1086
01:02:21,491 --> 01:02:23,580
attention attention to each other or 
someone was talking too much.

1087
01:02:23,581 --> 01:02:26,400
We could ask him to not talk so much and
so forth,

1088
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:32,540
and it worked.
The next semester we realized we could 

1089
01:02:33,151 --> 01:02:38,151
use this idea and revamp the class from 
top to bottom where we got rid of the 

1090
01:02:38,461 --> 01:02:40,770
textbook,
so all readings were online.

1091
01:02:40,771 --> 01:02:43,320
We'd have a quiz at the beginning of 
every class.

1092
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:48,330
We would have break the class into 
interactions more frequently.

1093
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:52,020
Another word started to rethink the 
class from top to bottom,

1094
01:02:52,021 --> 01:02:54,990
and then we moved it into an online 
class so that we,

1095
01:02:55,050 --> 01:03:00,050
we were able to broadcast out and we 
switched the format of the class.

1096
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:03,870
It was like a tv show,
so we were behind a desk,

1097
01:03:03,871 --> 01:03:08,700
we'd have fake news,
we'd have at least one of us would be in

1098
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:10,640
front of the green screen and some 
other,

1099
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:15,990
the place it used to be able to use to 
know what I meant.

1100
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:19,740
But I know as soon as I said that,
I realized I can't use that anymore,

1101
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:23,010
but this idea of one of us would be on,
on,

1102
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:23,630
on,
uh,

1103
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:27,060
in front of a scene somewhere on earth,
you know.

1104
01:03:27,061 --> 01:03:28,150
So.
So,

1105
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:29,680
uh,
what else?

1106
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:30,960
No,
I would say,

1107
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:32,550
sam,
where are you?

1108
01:03:32,551 --> 01:03:37,551
It looks like you are in a balloon today
and so it looks like he's in a balloon 

1109
01:03:37,621 --> 01:03:39,450
and so forth.
In any case,

1110
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:44,700
the point was we turned this into a 
television show and it,

1111
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:49,590
what we found was that by broadcasting 
this out to the 1500 students,

1112
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:55,130
we sent it up because there was testing 
every day that students were in class 

1113
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:59,730
every day they were focusing more on the
materials,

1114
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:04,970
they were more engaged and it turns out 
that their average performance went up 

1115
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:08,550
compared to when we taught it in the 
past and more impressively,

1116
01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:13,650
we people who took our,
our online class did better in the other

1117
01:04:13,651 --> 01:04:18,651
classes they were taking that semester 
class and the classes they took the 

1118
01:04:18,651 --> 01:04:23,311
semester afterwards and uh,
it wasn't huge.

1119
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:29,060
It was like a difference between a three
point one versus a three point two five.

1120
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:36,830
And we reduced the disparity between 
upper middle and lower middle class 

1121
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:40,821
students in terms of their performance.
So that historically we found one letter

1122
01:04:40,861 --> 01:04:44,700
grade between the upper middle and lower
middle class students and now and now we

1123
01:04:44,701 --> 01:04:46,700
had reduced it to point four letter 
grade.

1124
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:52,420
That's what was happening with the,
with the future authoring program.

1125
01:04:52,770 --> 01:04:53,610
That's right.
And that's.

1126
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:58,700
And we heard that differential effect 
on,

1127
01:04:58,810 --> 01:05:01,630
on the lower performing students.
Well,

1128
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:06,540
it turns out we came across some 
previous research that had found similar

1129
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:10,290
effects,
but it deals with frequent testing.

1130
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:15,710
The idea is kids who come from lower 
middle class backgrounds by and large 

1131
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:18,490
went to crappy high schools and in these
high schools,

1132
01:05:18,491 --> 01:05:19,600
these were,
by the way,

1133
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:21,780
our kids are all smart.
They're are always.

1134
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:24,820
Most of them are the top seven percent 
of their high school class.

1135
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:27,160
But if they were at a crappy high 
school,

1136
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:32,880
they learned to get by by memorizing 
because the tests were memorization 

1137
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:37,651
test.
And so these kids were great at 

1138
01:05:37,651 --> 01:05:39,181
memorizing and then they come to a real 
university where you're not tested on 

1139
01:05:39,181 --> 01:05:39,850
memorization.
You have to think conceptually.

1140
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:45,110
Right?
And historically when we taught those 

1141
01:05:45,110 --> 01:05:45,110
classes,
the classes,

1142
01:05:45,110 --> 01:05:48,700
we had the usual three or four tests 
over the course of the semester,

1143
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:54,660
I would always get students in my office
walking in after the first test saying I

1144
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:57,880
have never made a b in my life and I 
just failed your first test.

1145
01:05:57,881 --> 01:05:59,980
That's impossible.
How is this even possible?

1146
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:05,040
And I say,
how did you study while I had 

1147
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:05,040
flashcards?
I did this,

1148
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:05,540
I memorized this,
and I said,

1149
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,980
I told you memorization.
Does it work?

1150
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:14,010
You have to think conceptually,
and that doesn't mean anything to these 

1151
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:17,791
kids,
but now you've got a test every day and 

1152
01:06:17,791 --> 01:06:19,000
you fail that first test,
pow,

1153
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:21,970
you fail the second test power and all 
of a sudden you're realizing,

1154
01:06:22,330 --> 01:06:27,330
wow,
it's treated with memorizing doesn't 

1155
01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:27,330
work.

1156
01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:30,770
Okay.
So you think what's happening is that 

1157
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:30,770
they're learning that memorization 
doesn't work faster.

1158
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:33,470
That's exactly right.
That's really funny.

1159
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:36,600
And,
and they use these skills in their other

1160
01:06:36,601 --> 01:06:39,720
classes because they realized 
memorization is not working in the other

1161
01:06:39,721 --> 01:06:40,530
classes either.

1162
01:06:40,610 --> 01:06:42,530
So how do they catch onto the.
Okay,

1163
01:06:42,531 --> 01:06:44,780
so now they know that memorization 
doesn't work.

1164
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:48,230
How do they figure out what does work?
Well,

1165
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:51,530
it's been interesting moving to the 
online world.

1166
01:06:51,710 --> 01:06:56,710
We create all of these videos,
which basically there's a video on how 

1167
01:06:56,710 --> 01:07:00,851
to take,
how to study and there's another video 

1168
01:07:00,851 --> 01:07:01,970
on how to take a test and another video 
on um,

1169
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,950
you know,
have you managed your time?

1170
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:06,830
In other words,
now we,

1171
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:11,950
we understand the problem a lot better 
than we did before and so students are 

1172
01:07:11,950 --> 01:07:14,720
taking advantage of these resources and 
ended up doing better.

1173
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,370
Huh?
That's cool.

1174
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:18,870
So how long have you been doing now?

1175
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:24,980
So after.
So we started the class the first year 

1176
01:07:25,861 --> 01:07:30,861
in 2011 and then in the years afterwards
I started talking to people at the 

1177
01:07:33,871 --> 01:07:35,970
university of Texas and elsewhere about 
kennedy,

1178
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:38,400
the big picture of education,
which was,

1179
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:41,370
what the hell are we doing in education 
right now?

1180
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,890
You know,
the world has changed.

1181
01:07:44,090 --> 01:07:45,230
I've been asking myself,

1182
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:46,070
uh,
no,

1183
01:07:46,220 --> 01:07:49,100
but the world's changed.
Why do we have three hour courses?

1184
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:51,200
There's no logic for a three hour 
course.

1185
01:07:51,201 --> 01:07:55,310
Why do we have a semester that goes from
the 1st of January to sometime in may.

1186
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:58,610
There's no reason for that.
Why don't we have a half hour course?

1187
01:07:58,670 --> 01:08:02,090
Why don't we have a seminar course?
In other words,

1188
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:05,180
why do we put things together with the 
way we do?

1189
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:09,830
And it turns out there's really good 
reasons because in the early 19 hundreds

1190
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:15,020
when you need it in a standardized way 
of talking about credit and so forth,

1191
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:21,280
and then we built computers to program 
this in and we built buildings that we 

1192
01:08:21,921 --> 01:08:26,921
knew how to use time and space and 
location and and so that your computer 

1193
01:08:29,691 --> 01:08:34,691
will tell you this class is going to 
meet in this room at this time and your 

1194
01:08:34,691 --> 01:08:36,020
final exam will be at this place and 
this place.

1195
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,120
We don't need all of that.
Well,

1196
01:08:38,121 --> 01:08:43,121
that's analogous to the conservation of 
a physical structure and evolution.

1197
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:45,640
That's exactly right.
And we don't.

1198
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:50,540
And and what's interesting is the 
university of Texas computer,

1199
01:08:50,570 --> 01:08:54,620
the read that the registrar uses can't 
have make a half hour course.

1200
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:57,260
It can't,
it can't change the semester.

1201
01:08:57,410 --> 01:09:01,520
It can't do any of these things at a 
modern student information system.

1202
01:09:01,521 --> 01:09:05,630
Computer costs an unbelievable amount of
money.

1203
01:09:05,631 --> 01:09:10,631
And so what I'm doing is I am working 
with the university and the entire 

1204
01:09:10,971 --> 01:09:14,390
infrastructure to start to rethink 
everything.

1205
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:18,200
What should be the curriculum?
We don't need all these required courses

1206
01:09:18,201 --> 01:09:20,420
that we used to have.
It makes no sense,

1207
01:09:20,650 --> 01:09:25,650
but you know,
a lot of our requirements made a lot of 

1208
01:09:25,650 --> 01:09:27,380
states 50 years ago and a lot of our 
classes were flushed out classes.

1209
01:09:27,381 --> 01:09:32,381
We don't need flunk out clAsses anymore 
and we can come up with with really 

1210
01:09:32,381 --> 01:09:35,720
brief classes,
half our classes to learn a basic skill.

1211
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:38,630
For example,
we have a requirement.

1212
01:09:38,631 --> 01:09:42,380
You have to have a statistics course to 
take upper division psychology classes.

1213
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:44,990
Do you really need the statistics score 
as well?

1214
01:09:45,530 --> 01:09:50,530
Most of it you don't,
and if I asked my people teaching 

1215
01:09:50,530 --> 01:09:50,530
statistics,
asking them,

1216
01:09:51,290 --> 01:09:54,860
do the statistics you're teaching,
are they relevant to today?

1217
01:09:54,861 --> 01:09:56,210
And they all say,
oh no,

1218
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:58,640
not at all.
I mean I don't use analysis of variance.

1219
01:09:58,641 --> 01:10:01,190
I don't use t tests.
I use linear regression.

1220
01:10:01,191 --> 01:10:02,630
I use this,
I use that,

1221
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:07,780
but we can't teach that in.
My view is if you're going to take my 

1222
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:11,681
upper division class,
you better know correlations and you 

1223
01:10:11,681 --> 01:10:14,360
kinda know correlations up and down.
I could teach a correlation.

1224
01:10:14,490 --> 01:10:19,490
Of course.
That would be a point seven our corps 

1225
01:10:19,490 --> 01:10:22,360
and download it and take it anytime.
I don't care where you take.

1226
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:22,970
Yeah.
Well,

1227
01:10:22,971 --> 01:10:26,060
one of the,
I mean I've been using youtube a lot for

1228
01:10:26,061 --> 01:10:27,370
the last three years,
you know,

1229
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:32,390
when I put started putting my lectures 
online just just with an ipad,

1230
01:10:34,521 --> 01:10:35,560
you know,
um,

1231
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,780
and by,
by the beginning of 2016,

1232
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:42,650
I've collected about a million views and
I thought,

1233
01:10:43,630 --> 01:10:44,080
oh

1234
01:10:44,470 --> 01:10:49,470
that's,
that's a whole different thing than I 

1235
01:10:49,470 --> 01:10:52,511
thought it was.
I thought youtube was for cute cat 

1236
01:10:52,511 --> 01:10:54,541
videos.
And then I started thinking it through 

1237
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:54,541
what I thought,
oh no,

1238
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:57,691
look,
here's the situation map for the first 

1239
01:10:57,691 --> 01:11:00,991
time in human history,
the spoken word has as much staying 

1240
01:11:00,991 --> 01:11:05,341
power and reach as books.
No more reach you could publish faster 

1241
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:09,700
and it can be broken up and communicated
and all sorts of chunks.

1242
01:11:09,701 --> 01:11:12,130
It's like,
this is absolutely revolutionary.

1243
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:16,590
It seems to me that while you're in a 
race against time,

1244
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:20,790
that's exactly right because this is the
new world order and it's,

1245
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:26,090
you know,
it's like every other part of our world 

1246
01:11:26,090 --> 01:11:29,301
right now where we're dealing with the 
future of ai and the future of,

1247
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:36,980
of,
of everything that this really messes 

1248
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:40,521
with the world order because so much of 
what we can teach can be put up there 

1249
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:42,450
and it,
you know,

1250
01:11:42,451 --> 01:11:47,451
because the correlations haven't changed
a hell of a lot in the last hundred 

1251
01:11:47,451 --> 01:11:48,480
years.
You don't need to update your lecture on

1252
01:11:48,481 --> 01:11:49,840
correlations,
right?

1253
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:55,590
One really good lecture on correlations,
more $10,000.

1254
01:11:55,890 --> 01:11:59,140
That's also very frightening.
That's exactly right.

1255
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:01,150
And,
but then

1256
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,580
we do need,
you know,

1257
01:12:03,690 --> 01:12:04,570
we,
you know,

1258
01:12:04,571 --> 01:12:09,571
we're talking now 15th century,
we do need a guild mentality.

1259
01:12:09,581 --> 01:12:14,380
If you're going to become a therapist,
a scientist or this or that,

1260
01:12:14,650 --> 01:12:17,530
you need to have some serious lack of 
experience.

1261
01:12:17,531 --> 01:12:22,330
You need to have some serious experience
doing things in addition to learning how

1262
01:12:22,331 --> 01:12:27,310
to think and to get some smart feedback 
on how to think,

1263
01:12:27,311 --> 01:12:32,311
how to,
how to come up to get up to the level to

1264
01:12:33,341 --> 01:12:38,150
understand what's involved in trying to 
make a new size to make new advances.

1265
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:43,450
It's an incredibly exciting time and I'm
working with all parts of the 

1266
01:12:43,450 --> 01:12:46,840
university.
I have 200 people working with me.

1267
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:49,270
I've got various,
you know,

1268
01:12:49,330 --> 01:12:51,370
we were dealing with a development 
studio,

1269
01:12:51,371 --> 01:12:54,910
working on new ways of thinking of on 
online and other technologies.

1270
01:12:54,911 --> 01:12:58,990
I've got a big research methods group 
trying to find out what even works.

1271
01:12:58,991 --> 01:13:01,120
We don't even know what works and what 
doesn't.

1272
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:06,510
We're having to deal with extended 
campus in terms of how we can push out 

1273
01:13:06,510 --> 01:13:06,860
our,
our,

1274
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:11,980
our classes,
our information to the world in a way 

1275
01:13:11,980 --> 01:13:14,560
that has some kind of financial value to
the university.

1276
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:18,310
So we in this office

1277
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:23,450
guys,
when you guys been thinking about 

1278
01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:23,450
accreditation,
because it seems to me that the business

1279
01:13:23,620 --> 01:13:28,620
is the big issue.
The thing is is the ability to 

1280
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:32,900
disseminate valuable information was 
once the university.

1281
01:13:32,901 --> 01:13:34,700
In some sense how to hammer lock on 
that.

1282
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:38,890
That's gone no more.
That's the thing that the.

1283
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:44,060
The impediment to mass education at the 
moment in some sense is the problem of 

1284
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:48,940
mass accreditation.
Universities still have a hammer 

1285
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:49,790
marketing out,
but there's no reason that they need to.

1286
01:13:50,210 --> 01:13:55,210
So I'm curious,
when you're thinking about the mass 

1287
01:13:55,210 --> 01:13:56,060
distribution of education material,
what have you been thinking about?

1288
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:03,480
The problems and the complexity is this 
are unbelievable,

1289
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:08,481
so some of it is the,
the nationwide bureaucracy,

1290
01:14:09,211 --> 01:14:14,211
so there are accrediting agencies that 
that don't know how to use deal with 

1291
01:14:14,291 --> 01:14:19,291
fractional credit,
don't know how to deal with a variable 

1292
01:14:19,291 --> 01:14:21,661
calendar.
We've got financial aid issues because 

1293
01:14:21,661 --> 01:14:22,540
they're based on these old systems as 
well.

1294
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:27,840
We're dealing with intellectual property
in terms of who owns the ip of a class,

1295
01:14:28,481 --> 01:14:32,650
is it the instructors at the university,
can university resell it?

1296
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,050
How do we rethink this?
You know,

1297
01:14:35,051 --> 01:14:38,080
the idea of having free open classes is 
great,

1298
01:14:38,081 --> 01:14:43,081
but it's not a very good business model 
and this has been one of the problems 

1299
01:14:43,081 --> 01:14:45,991
with coursera and edx and you're putting
your videos on online for free because 

1300
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,600
the reality is the costume

1301
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:53,480
patrion,
you know,

1302
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,420
hey,
you know about patriotism?

1303
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:57,230
No,
it does really interesting.

1304
01:14:57,231 --> 01:14:58,590
It's a,
it's a platform that,

1305
01:14:58,750 --> 01:14:59,150
that,
that,

1306
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:04,300
that,
that was developed because of the 

1307
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:05,180
difficulties that creative people were 
having and monetizing their production.

1308
01:15:06,170 --> 01:15:11,170
And so with patrion,
people can voluntarily buy a monthly 

1309
01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:15,431
subscription if they find that the 
content that you're producing is worth 

1310
01:15:15,431 --> 01:15:19,871
supporting [inaudible],
then they can donate monthly to your 

1311
01:15:19,871 --> 01:15:23,951
patriot on account and they can either 
do that on a monthly basis or they can 

1312
01:15:23,951 --> 01:15:26,870
pay you a donation per video that you 
put up.

1313
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:32,890
And that's been a very,
I thought with my youtube content 

1314
01:15:32,890 --> 01:15:36,311
because I wanted to professionalize what
I was doing to some degree to hire a 

1315
01:15:36,311 --> 01:15:36,311
film crew and,
and to increase,

1316
01:15:36,311 --> 01:15:39,930
improve the audio and all of that.
And I threw up a.

1317
01:15:40,190 --> 01:15:45,190
I'm a patriot account online last april 
when I found out about the technology.

1318
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:49,640
just a curiosity and I got about,
I don't know,

1319
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,570
60 or 70 people subscribing in the first
month,

1320
01:15:53,571 --> 01:15:58,571
so that was kind of interesting and it's
enabled me to hire a film crew and that 

1321
01:15:59,361 --> 01:16:04,361
sort of thing.
But it's quite interesting because the 

1322
01:16:04,361 --> 01:16:04,880
patriot on people,
although there's some perks they get,

1323
01:16:04,910 --> 01:16:06,430
like I said,
the higher donors,

1324
01:16:06,431 --> 01:16:09,320
a signed copy of,
of one of my books for example,

1325
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:13,790
but mostly they don't get access to any 
content that everyone doesn't get access

1326
01:16:13,791 --> 01:16:14,660
to,
but people,

1327
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:20,080
people have a strong sense of 
reciprocity and they're not completely 

1328
01:16:20,241 --> 01:16:22,850
comfortable with the idea of getting 
something for nothing.

1329
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:26,540
And now the patriot on account is being 
extraordinarily useful.

1330
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:26,990
To me.
It's,

1331
01:16:26,991 --> 01:16:27,580
it's,
it's

1332
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:28,970
very interesting.
Yeah,

1333
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:32,910
we'll do it now.
For example,

1334
01:16:33,450 --> 01:16:38,450
you know,
and these are issues that we're 

1335
01:16:38,450 --> 01:16:39,921
struggling with at the university in 
terms of how do we do it because to do 

1336
01:16:40,471 --> 01:16:45,330
one of our courses is really quite 
expensive and you know,

1337
01:16:45,390 --> 01:16:46,140
talk,
you know,

1338
01:16:46,141 --> 01:16:46,830
10,
20,

1339
01:16:46,831 --> 01:16:51,831
$30,000
and trying to figure out the model for 

1340
01:16:52,111 --> 01:16:57,111
it.
The one thing that we can do is we can 

1341
01:16:57,111 --> 01:16:57,111
give university credit,
so that's,

1342
01:16:57,111 --> 01:16:57,990
that's,
that's one,

1343
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:00,900
that's one hold that we have,
but it,

1344
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:04,350
no,
it really does deal with a broader issue

1345
01:17:04,351 --> 01:17:09,351
and in our society which is,
is knowing the and knowing that and 

1346
01:17:10,941 --> 01:17:15,941
knowing how to think sufficient to get 
by in the real world or do you need the 

1347
01:17:15,951 --> 01:17:20,951
official credential and hopefully we 
both yes or no.

1348
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:30,250
If it was a just world,
just knowing the material would be 

1349
01:17:30,250 --> 01:17:34,340
sufficient.
It gives you no rapid way of telling the

1350
01:17:34,341 --> 01:17:35,160
charlatans from.

1351
01:17:35,620 --> 01:17:36,580
That's,
that's the,

1352
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:41,650
that's the big issue and that's,
that's the big issue is that as the 

1353
01:17:41,650 --> 01:17:46,481
credential becomes more important,
the knowledge becomes less important 

1354
01:17:46,481 --> 01:17:47,890
because you can use that credential to,
to,

1355
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:49,790
to,
to play the system.

1356
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:51,800
That's right.
That's exactly right.

1357
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:55,720
So these are the kinds of things that,
that I've been dealing with and I,

1358
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,600
you know,
trying to change a giant bureaucracy,

1359
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:04,840
turns out it's not real easy and it has 
all these built in assumptions that,

1360
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:11,470
that are part of the structure.
Not only not only part of the cognitive 

1361
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:15,040
apparatus,
but actually built right into the 

1362
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:15,040
infrastructure.
That's exactly right,

1363
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:17,900
and what I've found is the people at the
university had been very supportive.

1364
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:21,050
I thought for sure I would run into 
major obstacles,

1365
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:23,300
faculty,
students,

1366
01:18:23,330 --> 01:18:25,400
administrators,
even the legislators,

1367
01:18:25,401 --> 01:18:30,401
because this is a public university are 
all really supportive and even though 

1368
01:18:30,401 --> 01:18:35,321
I've got support all around,
it's still just like swimming through 

1369
01:18:35,321 --> 01:18:40,121
molasses because they're all of these 
rules and regulations that had been 

1370
01:18:40,121 --> 01:18:42,980
there sometimes for a hundred years 
that's no longer serve a purpose.

1371
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:43,680
You know,
that's,

1372
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:45,050
you know,
maybe you know,

1373
01:18:45,051 --> 01:18:50,051
maybe you don't know about the typical 
fortune 500 company over the last 30 

1374
01:18:50,051 --> 01:18:53,270
years and the typical family fortune 
three generations.

1375
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:59,470
It's for the reasons that you just 
described is what happens is that the 

1376
01:18:59,470 --> 01:19:04,400
structure itself becomes so 
anachronistic that not even the people 

1377
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:08,021
within it can change it.
something comes along that's that's 

1378
01:19:08,021 --> 01:19:12,250
younger and it's built on different 
presuppositions and just takes it out 

1379
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:13,970
and the probability that that's going to
happen to the universities,

1380
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:19,000
in my opinion,
is overwhelmingly high because of 

1381
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:19,640
exactly the sorts of things that you 
described.

1382
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:24,660
It's structural.
it's built for a different century from 

1383
01:19:24,850 --> 01:19:29,850
the late 18 hundreds.
Well it is and actually if you think 

1384
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:34,571
about it,
university started in the 14 hundreds 

1385
01:19:34,571 --> 01:19:36,880
and it's amazing that they have survived
as well as they have.

1386
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:38,690
That's for sure.
That's for sure.

1387
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,270
Well look,
it was really good talking to you.

1388
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:47,020
I've enjoyed as much though.
I'd been a great admirer of your 

1389
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:48,440
research and I don't say that lightly 
because.

1390
01:19:48,441 --> 01:19:49,010
No,
thank you.

1391
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:54,340
There's a handful of psychologists that 
have had a profound effect on me and 

1392
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:57,701
you're certainly one of them and I would
also say you're a spectacular rarity 

1393
01:19:57,701 --> 01:19:58,710
among social psychologists in my 
estimate.

1394
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:03,710
I know that's a nasty thing to say,
but being partly a social psychologist,

1395
01:20:03,711 --> 01:20:07,980
I guess I'm allowed to say it to talk to
you again at some

1396
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:12,980
point in the future,
maybe six months down the road or 

1397
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:15,441
something because you have all sorts of 
things that people need to know about 

1398
01:20:15,441 --> 01:20:16,830
and this is a really good way of telling
people about them,

1399
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:22,340
so I'll email you and get some,
if you could think of three or four 

1400
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:24,240
links and a little description that 
you'd like to go along with them,

1401
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:29,720
put them on,
put them in the description of the 

1402
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:31,581
video.
I'll tell you when both the podcast and 

1403
01:20:31,581 --> 01:20:32,130
the video will be up,
but that will be very soon.

1404
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:36,960
Send me an email and I will.
We'll do that.

1405
01:20:37,100 --> 01:20:39,000
Right.
Very nice talking with you.

1406
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:41,040
Nice talking with you as well.
Thanks so much.

1407
01:20:41,060 --> 01:20:41,850
Alright,
bye.

1408
01:20:41,851 --> 01:20:42,150
Bye.
