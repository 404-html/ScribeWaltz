1
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,280
[inaudible]
oh,

2
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,720
[inaudible]
oh,

3
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:33,020
can I have everybody's attention please?
All right.

4
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:34,820
So first of all,
thank everybody for coming.

5
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,550
I really appreciate seeing all of your 
faces here.

6
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,693
It makes me happy and it's kind of a 
sign that we're in the process of 

7
00:02:40,851 --> 00:02:43,640
reclaiming sanity on our campus that you
guys all showed up to this.

8
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:45,220
So thank you.
Thank you.

9
00:02:45,221 --> 00:02:46,054
[inaudible].
I'm just going to lay some quick ground 

10
00:02:52,251 --> 00:02:53,930
rules for the event.
Um,

11
00:02:53,931 --> 00:02:55,570
so first of all,
I want to thank Senator Frist,

12
00:02:55,571 --> 00:02:56,404

00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,320
for all their support.
Uh,

15
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:03,154
after this I'm going to give the mic 
over to professor offer Manco and he's 

16
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:07,980
going to announce Dr. Peterson.
Uh,

17
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,410
photography is allowed but no flash 
photography please.

18
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,573
Uh,
no signs are allowed besides a regular 

19
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:16,600
sheet of paper.
Um,

20
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,230
Peterson is going to speak until 8:00 PM
after which we will have a short q and a

21
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:23,740
until eight 30 and everybody's going to 
line up on this side.

22
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,650
I will be holding the microphone.
Actually,

23
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:29,140
we might not be able to use a microphone
since we only have one.

24
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,580
Um,
okay.

25
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,800
We should have a microphone for 
questions starting at eight.

26
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:35,220
I'll have you all line up down here and 
uh,

27
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,220
we will be over at about eight 30 and 
after the q and a event,

28
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:41,710
you guys are all free to leave.
So thank you very much.

29
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,970
Here's professor over Minko

30
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:50,650
[inaudible].
Good evening

31
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,890
[inaudible] and welcome to our talk 
today,

32
00:03:52,891 --> 00:03:55,140
which is called political indoctrination
on campus.

33
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,423
I am Richard Ever Manco associate 
professor of political science and 

34
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,643
co-director with John Sharpless.
Distinguish mental gentlemen right here 

35
00:04:02,641 --> 00:04:03,474
from the history department.
We are the CO directors of the Center 

36
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,760
for the study of Liberal Democracy,
the center along with uh,

37
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:09,594
the young Americans for liberty and the 
undergraduate political theory 

38
00:04:11,131 --> 00:04:13,920
association organized this lecture 
today.

39
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,680
If you'd like to be in the loop 
regarding other events,

40
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:19,920
you can look us up on the inner tubes.
Um,

41
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,203
and like I said,
our talk today is called political 

42
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,513
indoctrination on campus.
And I'm grateful to welcome Dr. Jordan 

43
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,013
Peterson as our speaker this evening.
Dr. Peterson is professor of psychology 

44
00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:33,630
and clinical psychologists from Toronto,
Canada.

45
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,860
He cut his teeth as a professor of 
psychology at Harvard University and now

46
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:38,694
as a professor at the University of 
Toronto where hopefully he enjoys the 

47
00:04:41,911 --> 00:04:44,550
full protection of a robust tenure 
tenure policy.

48
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,460
He's the author of two books,
maps of meaning,

49
00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:51,210
which is on my nightstand right now,
and 12 rules for life,

50
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,830
an antidote to chaos.

51
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,060
Dr. Peterson is also the author or 
coauthor of over 100 scientific articles

52
00:04:57,061 --> 00:05:00,900
on issues such as alcoholism,
aggression in the neurology of political

53
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,970
consciousness.
As I understand the titles,

54
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:03,804
because I didn't read 100 articles in 
2013 Dr. Peterson began recording his 

55
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:08,990
lectures,
uh,

56
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:11,670
personality and its transformations,
maps of meaning,

57
00:05:11,671 --> 00:05:14,520
the architecture of belief and uploading
them to youtube,

58
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,300
which had been very popular.
I will admit publicly that I listened to

59
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:21,840
many of his podcasts this past summer 
while on long training runs.

60
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,380
They don't do much for pace,
but they keep you going for a long time.

61
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,833
Talk to Peterson made something of a 
public splash in 2016 when he made a 

62
00:05:32,011 --> 00:05:34,410
couple of youtube videos criticizing 
Canada's bill.

63
00:05:34,411 --> 00:05:35,244
See 16 which adds gender expression and 
identity as a protected class under the 

64
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,990
Canadian Human Rights Act.
Dr. Peterson argued that a person can be

65
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:46,290
prosecuted for refusing to use preferred
pronouns.

66
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,740
A similar law has recently been passed 
in California,

67
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,550
which of course raises the issue of 
forced speech and the first amendment.

68
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:58,460
After these videos,
a Dr. Peterson acquired some notoriety.

69
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,713
His Youtube channel has gathered more 
than 450,000 subscribers and his videos 

70
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:05,570
have received more than 25 million 
views.

71
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:10,370
As of October,
2017 his classroom lectures on mythology

72
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:14,840
were turned into a wildly popular 13 
part TV series on TV Ontario.

73
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,590
Dr. Peterson also has a biblical lecture
series on Tuesday evenings,

74
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:19,723
which are almost always sold out and if 
any reason to move back to Toronto for 

75
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,530
me,
that would be one of them.

76
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,170
Finally,
I learned that like me,

77
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:28,004
Dr. Peterson hails from Alberta,
I assume he's a right thinking man and 

78
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:34,280
Dustin Edmonton Oilers Fan,
ladies and gentlemen,

79
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,210
Dr. Peterson

80
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,360
[inaudible].
Okay.

81
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,300
Thank you very much for inviting me.
Can you hear me at the back?

82
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,400
Yeah,
that's good.

83
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,053
All right,
well we might as well get right into 

84
00:07:05,321 --> 00:07:10,321
this.
So I want to go as deeply underneath the

85
00:07:11,801 --> 00:07:14,470
problem as I can possibly manage 
tonight.

86
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:15,304
So I'm going to marry some of my
ideas about what you might describe as 

87
00:07:22,451 --> 00:07:27,451
the grammatical structure of belief with
some more overtly political analysis,

88
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,593
concentrating on what actually what 
constitutes ideology because w one of 

89
00:07:36,241 --> 00:07:37,770
the things that I've been trying to 
figure out,

90
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,150
and I guess this is

91
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,643
part of my attempt to wrestle with some 
of the actual problems that the 

92
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:48,961
postmodernist pose because I don't mean 
as people or as thinkers,

93
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:49,834
I mean conceptually because you always 
have to give the devil his due so to 

94
00:07:53,411 --> 00:07:54,244
speak.
And there are elements of postmodern 

95
00:07:56,531 --> 00:07:57,364
thought like the idea that there's an 
infinite number of interpretations for 

96
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:04,870
any finite set of facts that actually 
happened to be true.

97
00:08:04,871 --> 00:08:07,850
And there are,
they're quite problematic and it's,

98
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,773
it's for good reasons as well as bad 
reasons that postmodernism has become 

99
00:08:12,101 --> 00:08:12,934
such a dominant strain of thought.
And so it's necessary to take it 

100
00:08:16,511 --> 00:08:18,940
seriously.
And I've been trying to,

101
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,860
one of the things I've been trying to 
figure out is,

102
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,113
is there a reasonable way of 
distinguishing a philosophy from an 

103
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,254
ideology in the pop?
The postmodernist answer to that is 

104
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:32,050
basically know that it's ideology all 
the way down,

105
00:08:32,051 --> 00:08:33,940
like the turtles all the way down there.

106
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,240
You'd never escaped from the,
from the grip of your,

107
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,970
of your viewpoint in some sense.
And,

108
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,510
and there's some truth in that,
but there's not enough truth.

109
00:08:43,511 --> 00:08:44,344
That's the thing.
And one of the hallmarks I would say of 

110
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,124
both poss postmodern Andy ideological 
thinking is the proclivity to reduce 

111
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:56,250
very complex phenomena to single causes.
But anyways,

112
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,353
so we're going to,
we're going to go underneath things as 

113
00:08:59,101 --> 00:08:59,934
far as we possibly can.
So the first thing that I'd like to 

114
00:09:02,431 --> 00:09:05,610
point out is,
or like to discuss is the actual problem

115
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:06,444
that we're,
that we're all trying to solve in some 

116
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:08,874
sense,
including the ideologues who claim to 

117
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:13,890
have the,
let's say,

118
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:16,350
interests of either the working class or
the were,

119
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:20,640
or the oppressed upper most in their,
in their imagination,

120
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:23,100
in their heart or in their intellectual 
concerns.

121
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,533
Um,
and there's absolutely no doubt that 

122
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,013
there is oppression and,
and that there's no shortage of 

123
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:31,080
suffering in the world.

124
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,913
And I do think that's not only the 
fundamental but also the fundamental 

125
00:09:35,371 --> 00:09:39,480
reality of the world.
And this is an existential theme.

126
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,660
It was developed at least to some degree
by Martin heidegger.

127
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,630
Heidegger had a concept that he called 
thrownness,

128
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:47,590
which is an interesting,
um,

129
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,530
an interesting idea.
And thrownness is,

130
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,483
is a brief description of the arbitrary 
nature of human being or even of being 

131
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:03,210
itself and the arbitrary nature it can 
be.

132
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:05,070
It can be his,
the word he used for that,

133
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,800
which is a German word,
can be translated in other ways.

134
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:11,670
It can be translated as abandoned or 
dereliction or dejection,

135
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,800
which obviously are much harsher words 
than mere thrownness thrown.

136
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:16,683
This is more of a detached term.
But what it means is that it's a 

137
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:21,564
characteristic of human conscious 
experience to be underpinned by 

138
00:10:26,731 --> 00:10:27,564
arbitrary realities that have nothing to
do in some sense with your choice as a 

139
00:10:32,851 --> 00:10:33,390
being.

140
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:37,920
And so some of the elements of being 
thrown are that you're born into certain

141
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:42,420
time rather than a different time.
That seems like it's an irrational fact.

142
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:43,254
That's how young would describe it,
Carl Young as it's an irrational fact 

143
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:49,500
because there's no real way of 
accounting for it from a,

144
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,020
from a causal perspective,
not,

145
00:10:52,021 --> 00:10:56,310
not subjectively speaking and you're 
born a certain race and you're born with

146
00:10:56,311 --> 00:10:58,020
a certain level of intelligence,
let's say.

147
00:10:58,021 --> 00:11:00,690
Although that can be impaired certainly 
with enough effort.

148
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,093
Um,
and you're born in a certain culture 

149
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:06,234
with a certain language and at a certain
socioeconomic it has certain 

150
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:09,984
socioeconomic class and with a certain 
degree of attractiveness and those are 

151
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:15,240
things that are all handed to you in 
some sense they,

152
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,050
they make up the,
in some sense they make up the axiomatic

153
00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:19,884
structure of your being and some of them
are advantageous and others are 

154
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,910
disadvantageous and you're stuck with 
the end.

155
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:32,030
That really is a problem partly because 
life in and of itself is a problem and a

156
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:33,234
problem of suffering.
But also because it seems quite evident 

157
00:11:36,181 --> 00:11:39,630
that well,
or at least that you could make a strong

158
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:43,650
case that the,
the talents and catastrophes of life are

159
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:44,484
by no means equally distributed.
And so in some sense there seems to be 

160
00:11:47,671 --> 00:11:48,504
an intrinsic,
we might regard it from the perspective 

161
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:54,940
of the standards of human justice and 
perhaps human mercy as well as something

162
00:11:54,941 --> 00:11:55,774
intrinsically unfair,
unjust about the structure of existence 

163
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,374
itself.
Now I like the existentialists take on 

164
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:06,990
that because
what the existentialists do is attribute

165
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,863
that inequality and injustice and say 
unfairness to the structure of being 

166
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:14,710
itself and pose that as the central 
problem of life.

167
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:18,460
And I find that very realistic.
I like this painting by Van Gogh.

168
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:20,860
I think it does a very good job of 
expressing that.

169
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,083
You know,
he's an old man and he's obviously 

170
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:25,504
sorrowful and you know,
he's not rich as you can tell by his 

171
00:12:28,411 --> 00:12:30,580
shoes.
And like it's rough and,

172
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:35,980
and he's a nexus of,
of oppression and perhaps,

173
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:38,803
oh,
a nexus of oh oppression in that he may 

174
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:43,880
have served as an oppressor,
but also someone who's suffering,

175
00:12:43,881 --> 00:12:44,714
you know,
pressed as a consequence of the 

176
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:48,680
conditions of his life.
And so then the question might be,

177
00:12:48,681 --> 00:12:50,420
well,
why is life like that?

178
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:53,180
And that's where and what might be done 
about it.

179
00:12:53,181 --> 00:12:55,760
And that's where the differences really 
start to arise.

180
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,953
So we can start from the perspective of 
the fact that life presents a universal 

181
00:13:00,831 --> 00:13:04,130
problem to those of us who are alive and
conscious.

182
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,580
Now
there are various,

183
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,273
what would you call the Metta theories 
that account for the existence of this 

184
00:13:13,951 --> 00:13:14,784
suffering.
My interpretation of the story of 

185
00:13:17,191 --> 00:13:18,024
Genesis essentially,
which in some sense describes the 

186
00:13:21,241 --> 00:13:23,040
introduction of suffering into the 
world.

187
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:23,874
Is that what,
what seems to happen in the story of 

188
00:13:26,281 --> 00:13:31,281
genesis is that human beings originally 
emerge is a mythological representation.

189
00:13:31,651 --> 00:13:35,190
So to deep fictional representation,
that's one way of thinking about it.

190
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,203
Keeping in mind as you might,
that fiction can be more true than 

191
00:13:39,511 --> 00:13:40,344
truth,
which is partly why we're so attracted 

192
00:13:41,731 --> 00:13:42,564
to it because fiction distills truth and
presents it in a much more concentrated 

193
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:47,694
form than,
than a mere description of everyday 

194
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,440
reality.
And in the genesis story,

195
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,070
there's a,
there seems to be an association between

196
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,670
the development of vision and self 
consciousness and the awareness of death

197
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:00,504
and the awareness of good and evil.
Those things happen pretty much at 

198
00:14:02,731 --> 00:14:04,050
exactly the same time.

199
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,600
And the consequence of that awareness 
of,

200
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,010
um,
uh,

201
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,670
are that self consciousness is a dawning
awareness of vulnerability.

202
00:14:11,671 --> 00:14:12,504
You remember in the story of Genesis 
when Adam and eve opened their eyes or 

203
00:14:15,241 --> 00:14:19,260
have their eyes opened as a consequence 
of falling prey to temptation,

204
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,520
the scales fall from their eyes and they
realize that they're naked and then they

205
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:26,040
immediately cover themselves up.
And of course,

206
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:29,250
the question is what does it mean to 
realize that you're naked?

207
00:14:29,251 --> 00:14:32,790
And there's a variety of complex quest 
answers to that.

208
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,620
One is that,
well,

209
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,753
if you're naked,
common nightmares to be naked in front 

210
00:14:37,861 --> 00:14:38,694
of a crowd.
And the reason that that's a nightmare 

211
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:45,030
is because while people don't like to 
have their full vulnerability exposed to

212
00:14:45,031 --> 00:14:49,080
the judgmental I of the crowd and for 
good reason like everybody has,

213
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,670
um,
what would you say?

214
00:14:50,671 --> 00:14:51,504
It may be inbuilt sense of shame about 
their fundamental inadequacy in 

215
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:57,410
relationship to the difficulties of 
life.

216
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:02,030
And so the story of Genesis,
which I think is a foundational story.

217
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,210
Well I don't think it's a foundational 
stories.

218
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,053
Obviously a foundational story,
foundational story of Western culture 

219
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:14,980
suggest that it's mankind's knowledge of
its own nature that leads to not only to

220
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:18,330
suffering but to work.
You know,

221
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:19,183
because once you realize that you're 
vulnerable and that that vulnerability 

222
00:15:21,411 --> 00:15:22,244
never really goes away,
you always have to prepare it for the 

223
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,214
future.
Because even if you solve the problems 

224
00:15:26,901 --> 00:15:28,940
that are right in front of you this 
moment,

225
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:30,043
that doesn't mean that you've solved the
plethora of problems that are likely to 

226
00:15:33,201 --> 00:15:35,930
pop up for you tomorrow and next week,
next month,

227
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:37,140
the next year.
And,

228
00:15:37,141 --> 00:15:40,790
and that in some sense are beyond your 
ability to finally solve.

229
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,193
So,
but there's a different viewpoint I 

230
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,520
think that comes out of the Marxist 
perspective.

231
00:15:46,521 --> 00:15:50,000
And I'm going to talk to you about 
Marxism and postmodernism,

232
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:54,260
both of which I regard as various 
strands of the same ideology.

233
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,150
Um,
and as I said,

234
00:15:56,151 --> 00:15:59,190
I'll define why I think are ideological.
And the,

235
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,413
the,
the thing that strikes me so clearly 

236
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:02,924
about the Marxist perspective is that 
the finger is always pointed at 

237
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,830
inadequate social order as the root 
cause of suffering.

238
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,220
And that just seems to me to be,
I don't know,

239
00:16:13,221 --> 00:16:14,054
it's,
it's so naive that it's difficult to 

240
00:16:15,681 --> 00:16:17,870
understand why people can possibly fall 
for it.

241
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,780
Maybe it's partly because there's some 
hope embedded in it,

242
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:21,850
right?
There's,

243
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:23,630
there's an idea that,
well,

244
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,493
suffering might be transcended if we 
could just organize our societies 

245
00:16:26,781 --> 00:16:28,790
properly,
but it seems to me,

246
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,860
number one,
that that's highly unlikely.

247
00:16:30,861 --> 00:16:32,900
A number two,
as Dostoyevsky pointed out,

248
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,003
even if we did organize our society so 
that no one had anything to worry about 

249
00:16:36,981 --> 00:16:39,230
from a material perspective.
So everyone,

250
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:40,064
let's say had enough bread and shelter 
that we're the kind of insane creatures 

251
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:48,191
that would blow that apart and fragment 
that sort of static utopian perfection.

252
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,170
Just so something strange and 
interesting might happen.

253
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:55,130
And I think that's a really,
that's a really devastating critique.

254
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:58,430
And you know,
the dusty ft formulated that back in the

255
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,533
late 18 hundreds he had thought through 
the consequences of communist utopia 

256
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:06,470
before it even manifested itself as a 
political force.

257
00:17:06,471 --> 00:17:10,760
And I think put his finger on exactly at
least one of its primary weaknesses.

258
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,120
So you know,
if we were delivered from suffering,

259
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:14,954
it's not necessarily clear that we would
be happy about that because one of the 

260
00:17:17,721 --> 00:17:18,554
things that does characterize human 
beings is this intense desire for 

261
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,230
experience that transcends the 
normative.

262
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:25,064
You know,
and people will go out and look for 

263
00:17:26,151 --> 00:17:29,450
difficult things to do just for the sake
of doing difficult things.

264
00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:30,284
They climb mountains and they engage in 
extreme sports and they put their lives 

265
00:17:33,681 --> 00:17:34,514
in danger.
And there's no technical reason for 

266
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:36,890
that.

267
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:37,723
And it doesn't seem like a very 
intelligent thing to do from the pure 

268
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:43,910
perspective of self preservation.
But we're certainly cape capable of it.

269
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,590
And the problem,
the Marxist seemed to lay the reason for

270
00:17:48,591 --> 00:17:52,060
suffering at the foot of inadequate 
social structure.

271
00:17:52,061 --> 00:17:53,520
And,
but they go farther than that.

272
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:56,940
They also described the social structure
as it exists.

273
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:57,774
And this is where the idea of the 
patriarchy is derived as far as I'm 

274
00:18:00,151 --> 00:18:03,570
concerned,
as something that is necessarily

275
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:10,110
an upper class or an oppressive class 
against the oppressed class and what the

276
00:18:10,111 --> 00:18:10,944
people who fit in those different 
categories can vary with classic 

277
00:18:13,381 --> 00:18:16,140
Marxism.
It was the rich against the poor,

278
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,550
the poor against the rich,
right?

279
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:20,010
The bruce was he against the 
proletariat.

280
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:20,844
And that's being transformed,
I would say by the postmodernists using 

281
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:25,404
a fairly self evident sleight of hand 
into identity politics where the 

282
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,333
oppressed oppressor narrative just takes
different forms according to the 

283
00:18:38,311 --> 00:18:42,240
identity that happens to be plugged into
the same mediational structure.

284
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:45,960
And what seems to happen as a 
consequence of that.

285
00:18:45,961 --> 00:18:48,390
And I mean,
there's pretty good data about this with

286
00:18:48,391 --> 00:18:51,750
regards to the Genesis of um,
uh,

287
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:52,643
intense intergroup conflict.
One of the things that predicts intense 

288
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,003
intergroup conflict,
like the conflict in a Robonda and 

289
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:00,240
certainly also happened in Nazi Germany,
is that,

290
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,663
um,
genocidal activities are often marketed 

291
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:08,310
as preemptive strikes against an 
oppressor class,

292
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:09,144
right?
And so that would have been the Jews in 

293
00:19:09,901 --> 00:19:12,180
Germany and in,
in Rwanda,

294
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,640
um,
the same narrative emerged.

295
00:19:14,641 --> 00:19:19,380
It's very common to,
to dichotomize this society as oppressor

296
00:19:19,381 --> 00:19:20,214
and oppressed and then for the oppressed
to rise up and take out the so called 

297
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:24,654
oppressors even before anything of any 
of any particular violence occurs 

298
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:29,814
because of this enhanced sense of 
victimization and the moral high ground 

299
00:19:33,391 --> 00:19:34,224
that it seems to provide that logic 
being something like if we're being 

300
00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:41,760
oppressed and we have every right to 
defend ourselves,

301
00:19:41,761 --> 00:19:42,594
so to speak,
even against threats that are only in 

302
00:19:44,941 --> 00:19:46,590
some way imaginary.

303
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,423
Now,
I don't want to get too cut and dried 

304
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,733
about that because you know,
it certainly is the case that there 

305
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:56,040
isn't a political or economic system in 
the entire world that lacks corruption.

306
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,293
And so the idea that this,
the social structure is in part corrupt 

307
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,264
enough so that everyone who is embodied 
in that social structure doesn't 

308
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:10,040
necessarily have an equal chance to 
manifest their gifts.

309
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:10,874
Say it rise to the top is certainly true
because human beings are completely 

310
00:20:14,071 --> 00:20:18,240
incapable of producing perfect social 
structures for a variety of reasons.

311
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,510
Our own blindness,
the fact that we inherit structures that

312
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:25,110
we don't really understand that are all 
demanded in band in one way or another.

313
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,440
And so there's always an element of 
truth to critical claims that if we just

314
00:20:30,901 --> 00:20:33,390
got our act together better from a 
social perspective,

315
00:20:33,391 --> 00:20:35,310
that everything would be more fair.
And just,

316
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:40,290
but to say that is not too similar 
caneously justify the claim that all the

317
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:41,124
reasons that human beings are suffering 
and that life is unfair and unjust is 

318
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:48,160
because the social structure is corrupt 
and right.

319
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,993
You gotta think in multivariate terms.
If you have any degree of intelligence 

320
00:20:51,731 --> 00:20:52,564
at all and for any complex phenomena,
there's generally a multitude of causes 

321
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:57,454
and they are not easy to differentiate.
I mean that's partly what's social 

322
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:03,940
scientist is do is to take a look at a 
complex outcome.

323
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,833
Suffering certainly being one of those,
and to look at the potential 

324
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:08,824
contributors of multitude of factors.
Now it's very difficult cause those 

325
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:15,880
factors are not easy to categorize and 
they overlap and so on and so forth.

326
00:21:15,881 --> 00:21:20,881
But you have to be pretty,
what would you say,

327
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,440
motivated and stupid?
I would say both at the same time,

328
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:30,460
to use a univariate hypothesis,
two to co,

329
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:34,720
two to account for a complex phenomena.
I don't care what the phenomena is.

330
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:35,943
And so that's another hallmark of video 
logical thinking is that the causal 

331
00:21:38,891 --> 00:21:41,320
story collapses into a single dimension.

332
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,333
You see that often in psychopathology to
where you know people who get obsessive 

333
00:21:46,301 --> 00:21:51,010
about something can't shake like a 
particular idea that possesses them.

334
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:55,240
Paranoid people are like that.
And people who have eating disorders,

335
00:21:55,241 --> 00:21:56,074
especially anorexia like that is their 
entire value structure collapses into 

336
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:00,364
the dimension of thin equals beautiful 
and good and it's very rigid and black 

337
00:22:04,841 --> 00:22:07,060
and white and it does the Mab solutely 
no good.

338
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,730
So now some of the problems with,
with the Marxist perspective seems to be

339
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:16,040
that um,
victim hood,

340
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:16,874
that sense of enhanced victim hood tends
to produce an intense sense of 

341
00:22:19,211 --> 00:22:20,044
resentment.
And that's a very bad idea because 

342
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:24,310
resentment is a very toxic and violent 
emotion.

343
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,473
It's also very ungrateful,
which is one of the things I would 

344
00:22:27,251 --> 00:22:28,084
really say about,
especially the radical left student 

345
00:22:30,221 --> 00:22:32,740
types,
especially at Ivy League universities.

346
00:22:32,741 --> 00:22:33,574
I mean it's really quite a spectacle to 
see people at places like Yale come out 

347
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:42,910
and agitate as a consequence of the 
realization of their own oppression when

348
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,150
by any reasonable standard,
current or historical,

349
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:49,770
they're probably in the top one 100th of
a percent,

350
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,673
perhaps better than that of all the 
people who have ever lived anywhere 

351
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,173
ever.

352
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,100
And so it really,
it's really,

353
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,383
it's really quite staggering to me that 
the top 0.001% can express their 

354
00:23:03,761 --> 00:23:04,594
resentment about the top 0.0001% in such
strident terms without noticing that 

355
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:16,201
exactly the same claims of privilege 
apply to them by as long as all you have

356
00:23:16,751 --> 00:23:19,850
to do is transform the,
the,

357
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,773
the been in which you're doing the the 
privilege comparisons and that becomes 

358
00:23:23,891 --> 00:23:26,200
immediately self evident.
And you know,

359
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,100
the fact that as Americans,
let's say hours North American since I'm

360
00:23:30,101 --> 00:23:30,934
a Canadian,
that were staggeringly privileged 

361
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:35,440
compared to the rest of the world is 
certainly a consequence of the,

362
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:39,820
of what you might describe as the 
arbitrariness of our political borders.

363
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,103
And so,
but to forget that when you're claiming 

364
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,070
a particular brand of oppression for 
yourself seems to me to be

365
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,390
very ungrateful at the least.
And certainly motivated,

366
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:51,224
let's say politically because I think it
justifies your expression of hatred for 

367
00:23:54,021 --> 00:23:58,280
those that tiny fraction of people who 
are still better off than you.

368
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,413
And also a degree of historical 
ignorance that's absolutely staggering 

369
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:06,050
in its magnitude and a complete 
indictment of our education system,

370
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:09,050
which should be indicted in every 
possible way.

371
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:14,560
So now the Marxists might claim to their
benefit,

372
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:20,980
let's say
with this worldview of class struggle as

373
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:22,694
being the primary driver of human 
history and the well off 

374
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:30,320
socioeconomically because that's pretty 
much the only way they defined well off,

375
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:31,154
which is also something I take great 
objection to because there's lots of 

376
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,143
hierarchies in the world and there are 
many important hierarchies and not all 

377
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:39,944
of them can be reduced to socioeconomic 
status by any stretch of the 

378
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:43,514
imagination.
Imagine if you are 80 years old and you 

379
00:24:45,621 --> 00:24:47,240
had $20 million,
you know,

380
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,283
you might be perfectly happy to get rid 
of all that money if you could be 18 

381
00:24:51,231 --> 00:24:51,920
again.

382
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:52,790
So it's,
and you know,

383
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:53,624
one of the best predictors of wealth in 
North America is actually age because 

384
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,153
you know,
young people haven't actually had much 

385
00:24:59,301 --> 00:25:00,134
time to make money,
whereas old people have had quite a bit 

386
00:25:01,731 --> 00:25:02,564
of time.
But the problem with being old enriches 

387
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:04,843
that you're still old.
And that actually turns out to be quite 

388
00:25:07,971 --> 00:25:11,210
as serious problem because no matter how
rich you are,

389
00:25:11,211 --> 00:25:12,044
you eventually die and so the money is 
the money has a very delimited if 

390
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,013
delimited effect with regards to 
addressing the fundamental problems of 

391
00:25:21,351 --> 00:25:22,184
the suffering of life and we know 
perfectly well from the empirical 

392
00:25:25,011 --> 00:25:29,360
perspective that once you have enough 
money so that the bill collectors aren't

393
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,194
chasing you around.
Essentially something like the 

394
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:33,224
beginnings of a middle class existence 
or maybe the upper end of the working 

395
00:25:35,871 --> 00:25:39,740
class than additional money has 
absolutely no bearing whatsoever on your

396
00:25:39,741 --> 00:25:40,574
psychological wellbeing and that's 
actually an indication of the 

397
00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:47,690
limitations of material comfort,
let's say as a medication for the,

398
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:50,180
for the suffering that's attended on 
life.

399
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,043
It's another thing that's very weak 
about the Marxists and I think very 

400
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:54,973
interestingly contradictory because 
they're very anticapitalist in their 

401
00:25:58,641 --> 00:25:59,474
structure,
but they're so damn materialistic that 

402
00:26:00,741 --> 00:26:04,670
it's absolutely mind boggling because 
the Marxists are actually more convinced

403
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:07,730
that money is useful than most 
capitalists as far as I can tell,

404
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:08,564
because they believe that that money is 
in fact the solution to all life's 

405
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:13,004
problems.
The problem is is that just the right 

406
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:15,374
people don't have the money.
And I think that's a staggeringly naive 

407
00:26:17,991 --> 00:26:22,340
perspective because there's many,
there's many problems in life that money

408
00:26:22,341 --> 00:26:25,520
just cannot solve and there's a fair 
number of them in that it actually makes

409
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:28,370
worse.
So anyways,

410
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,670
having said all that,
you could also still make the case.

411
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:36,780
I used to work for a Socialist Party in 
Canada when I was a kid about sixth bout

412
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,633
time,
I was 14 till the time I was about 17 

413
00:26:39,411 --> 00:26:42,320
before I figured out what was wrong.

414
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:46,080
Not so much socialism per se,
but with ideology per se.

415
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,153
And I actually admired the socialist 
leaders that I had the fortune to be 

416
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,103
introduced to because at that point they
were very much a voice for the working 

417
00:26:57,331 --> 00:26:58,164
class.
A lot of union leaders and people like 

418
00:26:59,311 --> 00:26:59,950
that,
you know,

419
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:03,490
they're classic Democratic Socialists on
the Labor end of the distribution.

420
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:04,324
And it's absolutely necessary for labor 
and the working class to have a 

421
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,374
political voice,
something the Democrats might keep in 

422
00:27:09,331 --> 00:27:10,164
mind.
So when maybe they wouldn't lose their 

423
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:15,480
elections quite so frequently.
I really think it's appalling,

424
00:27:15,481 --> 00:27:16,314
you know,
because it's necessary for the working 

425
00:27:17,431 --> 00:27:18,264
class to have a political voice.
So and to have that transformed into 

426
00:27:21,151 --> 00:27:24,150
identity politics is a real catastrophe.
Anyways.

427
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,133
I think that the people that I met,
many of them were genuinely concerned 

428
00:27:29,611 --> 00:27:31,770
with the problems of the working class 
and you know,

429
00:27:31,771 --> 00:27:32,760
more power to them.

430
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,920
And so I think there are people on the 
left who,

431
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,143
who genuinely are trying to make a 
difference for people who could use a a 

432
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,663
fair shot at opportunity in life.
But at the same time I noticed that a 

433
00:27:45,691 --> 00:27:49,260
tremendous number of the p of especially
the lower and worker,

434
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:50,603
a party worker protest or types were 
more peevish and resentful than 

435
00:27:54,661 --> 00:27:55,494
goodhearted and kind.
And it was about that time that I came 

436
00:27:57,931 --> 00:28:02,931
across George Orwell's famous critique 
of left wing thinking and in the UK when

437
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:04,854
in a book called road to Wigan Pier,
where he basically made the claim that 

438
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:10,680
the socialists that he knew,
especially the middle class ones,

439
00:28:10,681 --> 00:28:13,620
didn't give a damn about the poor.
They just hated the rich.

440
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,880
And that's,
I mean,

441
00:28:14,881 --> 00:28:15,714
that is something we're thinking about 
for a very long period of time because 

442
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,600
hatred actually turns out to be a very 
powerful motivation,

443
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,380
you know?

444
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,213
And,
and if you think about the sorts of 

445
00:28:24,361 --> 00:28:25,194
things that happened in the Soviet Union
and all these places that were supposed 

446
00:28:27,661 --> 00:28:29,070
to be worker's Paradise,
this,

447
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,173
if you look at the outcome and you had 
to infer whether it was goodness of 

448
00:28:33,571 --> 00:28:34,404
heart and kind heartedness and care for 
the working man that produced the 

449
00:28:37,711 --> 00:28:40,320
genocides or outright bitter,
resentful,

450
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,183
resentment and hatred,
it's a lot easier to draw a causal path 

451
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,260
from the negative emotion to the 
outcome.

452
00:28:46,261 --> 00:28:49,710
Then from the positive kind hearted 
benevolence to that,

453
00:28:49,711 --> 00:28:53,160
you just don't get gulags out of 
benevolence.

454
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,023
That's just not how it works.
So I think the bloody historical 

455
00:28:56,581 --> 00:28:58,120
evidence is clear.
Um,

456
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:01,320
although I have read the most 
convoluted,

457
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,870
pathological,
pathetic,

458
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,120
twisted rationalizations of what 
happens,

459
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:10,890
stay installing this Russia that you 
could possibly manufacturer,

460
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,993
it's as if an a stack of corpses that 
would reach halfway to the moon isn't 

461
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:19,470
enough evidence for the pathology of a 
certain form of belief.

462
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:23,070
So some people can't be convinced by 
anyone's death,

463
00:29:23,071 --> 00:29:25,470
but their own,
I suppose so.

464
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:30,840
So you know,
now I want to talk about postmodernism a

465
00:29:30,841 --> 00:29:31,674
little bit.

466
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,720
Well,
it seems to me that's my Michel Foucault

467
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,090
in the middle and a more reprehensible 
individual.

468
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:39,924
You could hardly ever discover or even 
dream up no matter how twisted your 

469
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:49,330
imagination and Fuko and Dara dye would 
say.

470
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:50,164
There's more.
But I would say they're the two 

471
00:29:51,341 --> 00:29:53,620
architects of the,
of the,

472
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:56,230
of the postmodernist movement.
And in brief,

473
00:29:56,231 --> 00:29:57,064
I think what they did was in the late 
sixties and early seventies they were 

474
00:30:00,221 --> 00:30:01,054
avowed Marxist some way,
lot way after anyone with any shred of 

475
00:30:05,801 --> 00:30:08,320
ethical decency had stopped being a 
Marxist.

476
00:30:08,321 --> 00:30:09,154
By that time,
even John Paul Sartre had woken up 

477
00:30:11,171 --> 00:30:15,220
enough to figure out that the Soviets 
hadn't ushered in the Kingdom of Heaven,

478
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:16,403
know he had evidence stretching back 45 
years that he could have attended to if 

479
00:30:19,181 --> 00:30:20,830
he would have been willing to open his 
eyes,

480
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,870
talk about bad faith,
which was his crutch,

481
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,550
ethical critique,
essentially.

482
00:30:25,551 --> 00:30:26,384
It's something quite staggering.
The postmodernists knew that they were 

483
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:30,124
pretty much done with regards to pushing
their classic Marxism by the late 

484
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,160
sixties and early seventies because the 
evidence that Stellan us Russia not only

485
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:39,994
stalinists certainly lennon was no,
no saint by any stretch of the 

486
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:43,954
imagination that the killing certainly 
got underway while he was still alive 

487
00:30:46,841 --> 00:30:50,170
and and continued after Stellan was dead
as well.

488
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:53,770
Although perhaps with not the same 
degree of brutality and efficiency.

489
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:56,950
And then there is of course Maoist China
where the estimates,

490
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:58,523
you know,
nobody knows how many people died under 

491
00:30:59,801 --> 00:31:04,360
Mao,
but the estimates are run as high as 100

492
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,193
million people,
which actually turns out to be quite a 

493
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:09,910
few people in the fact that we can't 
keep count accurately,

494
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,103
you know,
without an error margin of something in 

495
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:16,540
the tens of millions just tells you 
exactly how horrible the situation was.

496
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,110
They transformed the Marxist dialogue 
of,

497
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:22,123
of rich versus poor into oh pressed 
versus oppressor and Fuko in particular 

498
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,303
who never fit in anywhere and who was an
outcast in many ways an a bitter one in 

499
00:31:30,341 --> 00:31:31,174
as suicidal one his entire life did 
everything he possibly could with is 

500
00:31:34,451 --> 00:31:35,284
staggering Iq to figure out every 
treacherous way possible to undermine 

501
00:31:38,651 --> 00:31:42,250
the structure that wouldn't accept him 
in all his peculiarity.

502
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,293
And it's no wonder because there'd be no
way of making a structure that could 

503
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:49,420
possibly function if it was composed of 
people who were as peculiar,

504
00:31:49,421 --> 00:31:54,340
bitter and resentful as Michel Fuko.
So you couldn't imagine this functioning

505
00:31:54,341 --> 00:31:57,790
society that would be composed of 
individuals with his particular makeup.

506
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,073
In any case,
he did put his brain to work trying to 

507
00:32:01,571 --> 00:32:05,710
figure out a way how to resurrect 
Marxism under a new guys,

508
00:32:05,711 --> 00:32:07,240
let's say,
and B,

509
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:11,740
how to justify the fact that it wasn't 
his problem,

510
00:32:11,741 --> 00:32:12,574
that he was an outsider.
It was actually everyone else's problem 

511
00:32:15,761 --> 00:32:19,480
and he did a pretty damn good job of 
that and laid the groundwork for this.

512
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,490
For the,
what would you call it,

513
00:32:21,491 --> 00:32:22,324
the rise of the marginalized against the
center and Darin is thinking is very 

514
00:32:26,471 --> 00:32:27,880
much the same.
You know dare.

515
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:28,983
Even though Fuco and Derrida hated each 
other and and regarded each other as 

516
00:32:32,711 --> 00:32:35,470
intellectual charlatans,
which was about the only thing either of

517
00:32:35,471 --> 00:32:38,410
them was ever really correct about,
so

518
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:46,520
Dara Dad was also an in some ways is 
even more treacherous thinker because he

519
00:32:46,821 --> 00:32:47,654
makes the claim in some sense that I 
think a political system has a center 

520
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,260
around which the majority congregate.

521
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,150
Let's say it's,
it's,

522
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:00,050
it's quite similar to two ficos analysis
and that there are,

523
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:03,920
there are people who are outside the 
category system and then,

524
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:08,240
which is obviously true because no 
matter how you categorize people,

525
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:11,240
there are certain people inside the 
category in certain people outside.

526
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,970
That's actually why you categorize 
things,

527
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,073
right?
Because of every category holds every 

528
00:33:16,311 --> 00:33:18,380
entity.
Then every,

529
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:21,800
every cognitive operation is infinitely 
complex.

530
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:26,310
You can't manage that way to categorize.
You have to include and exclude.

531
00:33:26,311 --> 00:33:27,144
It's in the very nature of 
categorization and you can't just scrap 

532
00:33:29,991 --> 00:33:33,560
categorization because without 
simplification and categorization,

533
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,540
you actually can't function in the 
world.

534
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,310
You just die,
right?

535
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:38,144
You die of excess stress.
It's something like something like that 

536
00:33:40,551 --> 00:33:44,000
happens to schizophrenia people because 
their category systems breakdown,

537
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,023
they're completely incapable of 
functioning in the world as a 

538
00:33:46,671 --> 00:33:50,040
consequence of that anyways.
Um,

539
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,470
then you know,
uh,

540
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,333
Derrida went and Fuko as well went a 
step farther and this is one of the 

541
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:57,560
incredibly crooked elements of their 
thinking.

542
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,130
I think another slight of hand,
which was well category systems,

543
00:34:01,131 --> 00:34:04,040
exclude political systems,
exclude economic systems,

544
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:04,874
exclude any hierarchy of value excludes 
obviously because if there was a 

545
00:34:08,961 --> 00:34:09,794
hierarchy of value,
some things are more valuable than 

546
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:12,284
others and the less valuable things are 
excluded because otherwise it wouldn't 

547
00:34:15,171 --> 00:34:17,620
be a hierarchy of value.
But the,

548
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,493
the next claim they essentially make is 
that the reason that those hierarchies 

549
00:34:21,261 --> 00:34:25,970
of value are constructed isn't to 
produce whatever it is that's a value,

550
00:34:25,971 --> 00:34:26,804
but to exclude and to maintain the 
structure of power that's intrinsic to 

551
00:34:31,251 --> 00:34:33,660
the hierarchy of value.
And that's a,

552
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:38,000
that's an unbelievably crooked claim 
because there are multiple reasons why a

553
00:34:38,001 --> 00:34:40,330
hierarchy of value might be put into 
place there.

554
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:43,190
Hierarchies of beauty and there's 
hierarchies of competence,

555
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:46,700
hierarchies of intelligence and,
and attractiveness and,

556
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:51,380
and athletic ability and musical talent.
There's multiple hierarchies.

557
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:54,680
And in order for those things to exist 
at a high order,

558
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,480
in order for us to,
to,

559
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,940
to,
to laud,

560
00:34:58,690 --> 00:34:59,600
uh,
what would you say?

561
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,780
Musical genius,
we have to excuse all the people.

562
00:35:02,781 --> 00:35:03,614
We have to exclude all the people who 
can only squawk their clarinet from the 

563
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:10,550
hierarchy because otherwise you don't 
have any music and there's no option,

564
00:35:10,551 --> 00:35:11,384
there's no direction.
And so to claim that the purpose of the 

565
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:18,230
hierarchy is to exclude,
it's unbelievably crooked and it's,

566
00:35:18,231 --> 00:35:22,520
it's central claim for both,
for both [inaudible] and Darin.

567
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:25,280
It's one of those slights of hands that 
people don't quite notice,

568
00:35:25,281 --> 00:35:27,590
but that have absolutely catastrophic 
effects.

569
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,500
Now for foucault and Derrida,
they,

570
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,770
you could,
here's how you could imagine their world

571
00:35:33,771 --> 00:35:35,150
essentially.
Um,

572
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:36,561
you know,
for the,

573
00:35:36,561 --> 00:35:38,980
for the philosopher Hobbes,
um,

574
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,220
life was nasty,
brutish and short,

575
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:44,520
and people were at each other's throats 
in the state of nature,

576
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:47,520
right?
But hubs really thought about that as a,

577
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,280
as a,
as the chaos of individuals.

578
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:51,443
And he believed that a central authority
had to exert force in order to organize 

579
00:35:55,261 --> 00:35:58,830
that intrinsic chaos so that some degree
of peace could rate.

580
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:02,100
It's kind of the opposite of John Shock 
Russo's theory,

581
00:36:02,101 --> 00:36:04,860
which was that human beings were 
intrinsically good and,

582
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:08,610
and the state,
the government was intrinsically bad and

583
00:36:08,611 --> 00:36:11,820
that all of what made people evil derive
from the state.

584
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,043
Um,
I would say if you put hobbes and 

585
00:36:14,641 --> 00:36:17,130
Rousseau together,
you actually get the truth,

586
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,413
even though they do seem to be coming at
it from opposite perspectives because 

587
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:21,804
people are actually good and evil.
And so social structures are also good 

588
00:36:25,261 --> 00:36:26,640
and evil.
And you know,

589
00:36:26,641 --> 00:36:30,000
it's paradoxical and we don't like 
paradoxical categories,

590
00:36:30,001 --> 00:36:31,940
but that's still how it is.
What,

591
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,760
what foucault and Derrida and the 
postmodernists did was that they kind of

592
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:36,594
added the collective element to that.
So they're hobbsy and world isn't a 

593
00:36:39,091 --> 00:36:39,924
world of individuals struggling against 
one another in the initial state of 

594
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:44,910
warlike nature.
It's,

595
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:45,983
it's groups of individuals bound by 
whatever their identity happens to be 

596
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:53,280
struggling against each,
each other for power.

597
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,310
Because in the postmodern,
neo Marxist universe,

598
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,173
there's nothing but power.
And there's a variety of reasons for 

599
00:37:00,121 --> 00:37:00,954
that.
Partly it's because the postmodernists 

600
00:37:03,661 --> 00:37:07,560
don't admit that there are any standards
outside of arbitrary opinion.

601
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:08,763
Essentially.
They don't really believe in the real 

602
00:37:10,321 --> 00:37:12,720
world,
which is why they can generate critiques

603
00:37:12,721 --> 00:37:13,980
of science,
for example,

604
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:14,814
which is increasingly characterized is 
nothing but part of the euro centric 

605
00:37:18,481 --> 00:37:19,314
patriarchies um,
what would you call desire to impose 

606
00:37:22,081 --> 00:37:22,914
their power structure on the rest of the
world despite the fact that it also 

607
00:37:25,771 --> 00:37:28,520
makes planes fly in computers operate 
and,

608
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,120
and well,
you know,

609
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:31,710
yeah,
exactly.

610
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,230
So,
and it's a rare bloody,

611
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:37,650
um,
social justice warrior that doesn't have

612
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:38,993
an iphone or a android that wouldn't 
work if quantum mechanics wasn't 

613
00:37:42,181 --> 00:37:43,014
actually correct.
Because the fact that quantum matt 

614
00:37:45,371 --> 00:37:48,720
mechanics is correct is one of the 
reasons why these unbelievably,

615
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:52,000
highly developed pieces of technology 
actually function.

616
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,990
So they bitch and whine about the 
patriarchal,

617
00:37:55,290 --> 00:38:00,150
patriarchal underpinnings of Eurocentric
Science and use the gadgets all the time

618
00:38:00,151 --> 00:38:02,040
to aggregate,
to complain about it.

619
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:05,880
So it's really pretty appalling.
So anyways,

620
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:07,770
anyways,
the worldview of the,

621
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:08,693
of the postmodern neo marxists is that 
everybody is basically not an 

622
00:38:12,181 --> 00:38:13,370
individual.
Um,

623
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:17,790
cause that's really a fiction and a 
eurocentric patriarchal fiction at that,

624
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:20,970
but a member of whatever their identity 
group happens to be.

625
00:38:20,971 --> 00:38:25,380
And there's no real possibility of 
communication between identity groups,

626
00:38:25,381 --> 00:38:28,290
hence phenomena like cultural 
appropriation.

627
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,513
Um,
and so it's a war of all groups against 

628
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:32,874
all groups and it's all,
it's nothing but a struggle for power 

629
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:35,763
and there's no higher order ethic to be 
referred to because for the 

630
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:41,230
postmodernists,
um,

631
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,390
there is no such thing as a higher order
ethic.

632
00:38:43,391 --> 00:38:45,460
There is no such thing as a uniting 
narrative.

633
00:38:45,461 --> 00:38:47,800
That's,
that's a hallmark of their thinking.

634
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,633
Now of course,
that doesn't work out in practice 

635
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:52,780
because without an ethic or a higher 
order value,

636
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,093
there isn't anything you can do with 
your life because you keep undermining 

637
00:38:56,351 --> 00:38:59,080
yourself.
If everything's just a women subjective,

638
00:38:59,081 --> 00:39:02,710
there's and there's no hierarchy of 
values than what the hell do you do when

639
00:39:02,711 --> 00:39:03,544
you get up in the morning.
If one thing isn't better than the 

640
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:06,634
other,
you might as well just lay there and 

641
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:08,434
smother yourself with a pillow would be 
a lot easier than opening your eyes and 

642
00:39:11,261 --> 00:39:15,160
struggling in the world so so it's 
completely,

643
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:19,450
it's a self defeating philosophy and I 
think that's part of the reason why it's

644
00:39:19,451 --> 00:39:20,284
more or less self evident that it's a 
mask for the continuation of Marxism 

645
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:27,850
because at least Marxism has as one of 
its advantages at direction.

646
00:39:27,851 --> 00:39:28,840
It's an ethic,
right?

647
00:39:28,841 --> 00:39:29,674
You have something to struggle against 
even though what you're struggling 

648
00:39:31,481 --> 00:39:35,620
against is certainly one of the things 
that you actually rely on and second,

649
00:39:35,621 --> 00:39:36,454
something that you have to oversimplify 
in a very ungrateful and resentful way 

650
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:43,240
to justify fighting against it to begin 
with.

651
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,620
And that's especially true in western 
cultures because as pathological as they

652
00:39:47,621 --> 00:39:48,454
certainly are,
which is approximately as pathological 

653
00:39:50,381 --> 00:39:51,214
as all of you are,
there are a lot less pathological than 

654
00:39:53,351 --> 00:39:54,184
almost everything that's ever happened 
and pretty much everything that's 

655
00:39:57,611 --> 00:39:59,530
currently happening elsewhere in the 
world.

656
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:00,543
And you can kind of tell that by the 
fact that people tend to come to 

657
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:05,320
immigrate to the West rather than the 
reverse.

658
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,430
Now,
you know,

659
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:09,010
the postmodern neo Marxists would have 
an answer to that,

660
00:40:09,011 --> 00:40:09,844
which would be the only reason the west 
functions is cause it's raped the rest 

661
00:40:12,461 --> 00:40:14,770
of the,
of humanity and the planet.

662
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,800
But you know,
the less said about that,

663
00:40:20,021 --> 00:40:25,021
the better.
And Marx was wrong about this too.

664
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:28,640
The proletarians have nothing to lose,
but our chains,

665
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:31,940
that actually wasn't true.
They lost their food.

666
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:36,480
Yeah.
Yeah.

667
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,780
You might see that happening again in 
Venezuela where they,

668
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:40,703
where they're having a hard time in the 
middle class are having a hard time 

669
00:40:43,081 --> 00:40:43,914
getting toilet paper,
which has a lot less funny than it 

670
00:40:45,451 --> 00:40:48,510
sounds.
They lost their families.

671
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,340
That's good.
They lost their land.

672
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:54,570
They lost their freedom.
They lost.

673
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:58,410
They lost their right to exist without 
pain.

674
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:02,520
They lost the right to honestly suffer 
and talk about it,

675
00:41:02,521 --> 00:41:04,710
which is a terrible thing to lose,
lose.

676
00:41:04,711 --> 00:41:08,400
And then they lost their lives.
So that was wrong.

677
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:12,300
And he can smile all you want about it.
But it wasn't very cute.

678
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,700
This is nice.
I saw this on twitter today.

679
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,713
When Karl Marx died in 1883 the average 
Englishman was three times richer than 

680
00:41:19,801 --> 00:41:24,801
he was when weren't.
Mark's was born in 1818 that's world GDP

681
00:41:24,841 --> 00:41:28,290
per person in 19 1990 international 
dollars.

682
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:30,990
And you'll see that there's an 
unbelievable spike.

683
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:33,950
And it happened at about 1895 was,
let's,

684
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:34,784
let's put it this way.
It was precisely and exactly the 

685
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:41,240
opposite of what the Marxists predicted.
But you know,

686
00:41:41,241 --> 00:41:43,400
when your predictions fail and you're an
idiot log,

687
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:44,234
you just gerrymander the axioms of your 
theory because otherwise you'd have to 

688
00:41:47,181 --> 00:41:48,014
drop the damn thing.
And then you're plunged into a state of 

689
00:41:50,391 --> 00:41:52,700
existential chaos,
which is no joke.

690
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:56,090
And you have to reformulate yourself.
So you know,

691
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:56,943
you,
you don't want to underestimate the 

692
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,240
difficulty of doing that.
But,

693
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:00,663
but it's still relatively amusing,
especially when you consider that that 

694
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,653
unbelievable increase in gross domestic 
product per person actually happened 

695
00:42:09,381 --> 00:42:14,090
despite the best efforts of the Marxists
to prevent it from happening.

696
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,193
And so God only knows we were,
we would be if 120 million people 

697
00:42:18,891 --> 00:42:19,724
weren't sacrificed painfully and 
pointlessly in the 20th century to this 

698
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:26,150
idiot God of socialist utopia.

699
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:29,270
It was turned out to be murderous beyond
comprehension,

700
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:34,190
postmodernism and attitude of 
skepticism,

701
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:37,590
irony toward a skepticism towards 
everything.

702
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,503
But postmodernism,
I might add irony toward rejection of 

703
00:42:41,931 --> 00:42:42,764
grand narratives.
That's a lot bigger a problem than you 

704
00:42:44,751 --> 00:42:49,130
think because actually the things that 
unite people are grand narratives.

705
00:42:49,131 --> 00:42:50,360
You know,
a narrative is a,

706
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:54,350
as a cognitive structure that orients 
you towards an ideal.

707
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,820
That's what a narrative is.
You know,

708
00:42:55,821 --> 00:42:57,830
if you go see a movie,
which is a narrative,

709
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:00,050
the hero is up to something.
First of all,

710
00:43:00,051 --> 00:43:02,270
there is a hero because why the hell go 
to the movie?

711
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:05,990
Otherwise you don't want to watch a 
bunch of people bumble around randomly.

712
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,120
There's no,
you're not interested in that at all.

713
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,150
You want to see someone who has a 
problem to solve and who at,

714
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,120
who's applying an ethic to the solution 
of that problem.

715
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,530
It can be a bad ethnic.
That would be an Antihero,

716
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:18,170
right?
Could be a pathological ethic.

717
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:21,770
That's a good object lesson anyways,
but it's certainly an ethic.

718
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:26,930
And so it's grand narratives that unite 
people and when the postmodernist become

719
00:43:26,931 --> 00:43:27,764
skeptical about the grand narrative is 
what that essentially means is that 

720
00:43:30,351 --> 00:43:33,410
they're demolishing the,
the hyper truths.

721
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:35,420
I would say the fictions,
the,

722
00:43:35,421 --> 00:43:35,960
the,
the,

723
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,793
the true fictions that unite us as 
people and stop us from being at each 

724
00:43:40,431 --> 00:43:45,431
other's throats,
enable us to compete and to cooperate in

725
00:43:45,681 --> 00:43:48,620
a peaceful and productive manner,
at least some of the time,

726
00:43:48,621 --> 00:43:52,460
which is a miracle in and of itself and 
should be regarded as such.

727
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,361
Right?
I mean,

728
00:43:53,361 --> 00:43:54,194
we're so blind in the west to the 
miraculous nature of our culture that 

729
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:58,671
it's,
well,

730
00:43:58,671 --> 00:44:01,520
it's a consequence of being privileged,
let's say.

731
00:44:01,521 --> 00:44:04,370
Although I hate that word,
we could call it fortunate.

732
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:05,563
You know,
when I am in Herzliya leak came to 

733
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,384
Holland,
one of the things that's really struck 

734
00:44:09,381 --> 00:44:11,830
me when I read her book infidel,
um,

735
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:17,680
she was very taken aback by the fact 
that you could stop by a bus,

736
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:20,623
a bus stop,
and there'd be a little digital display 

737
00:44:22,881 --> 00:44:23,714
there that said when the bus was coming 
and when the digital display said the 

738
00:44:27,471 --> 00:44:28,304
bus was coming,
then the bus would show up and she just 

739
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,334
couldn't accustom yourself to that.
It was like an existential produced 

740
00:44:34,531 --> 00:44:35,364
existential terror.
And it's no wonder because you just 

741
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:39,990
think about how bloody impossible that 
is.

742
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,200
That's impossible.
I mean the Dutch could manage it because

743
00:44:43,201 --> 00:44:43,981
they manage,
you know,

744
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:46,140
a dozen impossible things before 
breakfast.

745
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:48,930
They live under water for God's sake.
So,

746
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:50,483
but you know,
she was also absolutely amazed that you 

747
00:44:52,651 --> 00:44:56,340
could go ask policemen for help and they
wouldn't just hurt you and take all your

748
00:44:56,341 --> 00:44:56,970
money.

749
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:59,070
And that is also another form of 
miracle.

750
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,990
The kind of thing that we just take for 
granted,

751
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,010
skepticism towards ideologies and 
universalism.

752
00:45:05,011 --> 00:45:06,990
Well,
we can scrap the ideology part,

753
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,080
including objective notions of reason,
human nature,

754
00:45:10,081 --> 00:45:11,970
social progress,
absolute truth,

755
00:45:11,971 --> 00:45:15,750
and objective reality.
And it's an unbelievably corrosive,

756
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:20,160
it's an unbelievably corrosive system of
thought because first of all,

757
00:45:20,161 --> 00:45:23,910
it defines hierarchy as power.
And that's actually technically wrong.

758
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:24,863
Even friends to wall who's been studying
chimpanzee hierarchies has established 

759
00:45:28,411 --> 00:45:29,244
quite clearly that the most brutal and 
powerful Elfa chimp is not the one who 

760
00:45:33,511 --> 00:45:36,350
establishes the most stable dominance 
hierarchies,

761
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,293
or let's call them social hierarchies 
because the brutal tyrant chimp gets 

762
00:45:41,011 --> 00:45:45,180
torn apart by two subordinate chimps,
three quarters as strong as him.

763
00:45:45,181 --> 00:45:46,014
As soon as he turns a blind eye,
the more stable hierarchies even among 

764
00:45:49,351 --> 00:45:51,030
chimps,
are ones that are,

765
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:53,100
that are governed by someone.

766
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:53,963
You know,
when a chimp that's got some physical 

767
00:45:55,351 --> 00:45:56,184
power in some capacity for intimidation,
but who's perfectly capable of 

768
00:45:59,371 --> 00:46:00,204
establishing reciprocal relationships 
with other male and female chimps so 

769
00:46:03,901 --> 00:46:06,150
that he's got friends and allies around 
them,

770
00:46:06,151 --> 00:46:08,370
it stabilizes it's rules,
so to speak.

771
00:46:08,371 --> 00:46:13,140
So the idea that hierarchies in,
in functioning societies are primarily a

772
00:46:13,141 --> 00:46:16,530
consequence of power,
is cynical beyond belief,

773
00:46:16,531 --> 00:46:19,110
apart from being wrong.
So,

774
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:22,800
and it also destroys the idea of a 
hierarchy of competence,

775
00:46:22,801 --> 00:46:23,634
which I really think is one of the 
reasons for the theory to begin with 

776
00:46:27,031 --> 00:46:31,080
because we know even from the empirical 
data that in Western societies,

777
00:46:31,081 --> 00:46:33,570
the best two predictors of longterm life
success,

778
00:46:33,571 --> 00:46:34,404
our intelligence and conscientiousness,
and they do a pretty good job of 

779
00:46:38,641 --> 00:46:39,474
predicting longterm life success 
accounting for about 25 to 30% of the 

780
00:46:42,271 --> 00:46:43,104
variance,
which is a lot by social science 

781
00:46:44,611 --> 00:46:45,444
standards and it's kind of a testament 
to the integrity of our societies that 

782
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:52,770
complex jobs tend to be filled by 
intelligent,

783
00:46:52,771 --> 00:46:53,604
hardworking people and thank God for 
that because who the hell do you want 

784
00:46:56,461 --> 00:46:57,294
running them?

785
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,400
You don't want to be doing that 
randomly.

786
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:00,293
Most of those things are incredibly 
complex and difficult and so you better 

787
00:47:02,791 --> 00:47:03,624
have disciplined people who were willing
to work 60 hours a week and who are 

788
00:47:07,561 --> 00:47:08,394
super smart governing those things are,
or the lights go off and they should be 

789
00:47:11,251 --> 00:47:14,520
off right now because it's impossible to
keep a power grid functioning.

790
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,593
It's not like it.
It's not like entropy isn't trying to 

791
00:47:17,911 --> 00:47:20,490
tear it to bits at every second,
right?

792
00:47:20,491 --> 00:47:21,324
There are thousands of people out there 
working madly to stop this thing from 

793
00:47:24,601 --> 00:47:27,150
doing what it should be doing,
which is to fail.

794
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,430
And so competence is everywhere and it's
abs.

795
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:31,293
I mean you think about how many 
competent people have to be working 

796
00:47:33,581 --> 00:47:36,130
behind the scenes so that you can all 
come here,

797
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,173
you know,
in your leisure fundamentally and sit 

798
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:41,200
for two hours peacefully in a lecture.

799
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,033
It's absolutely beyond belief.
So I think that they were after the 

800
00:47:45,641 --> 00:47:48,490
destruction of the idea of competence 
itself and we're getting,

801
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:49,324
we're walking down that road very,
very rapidly as well as trying to 

802
00:47:52,091 --> 00:47:55,300
destroy the idea of the world.
And that's part of the,

803
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,460
what would you call it,
the attempt to,

804
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:01,630
to insist that there's no such thing 
outside the text,

805
00:48:01,631 --> 00:48:03,700
which was one of Derrida's great 
statements.

806
00:48:03,701 --> 00:48:04,534
There's no such thing outside the text.
And what he meant by that in some sense 

807
00:48:07,211 --> 00:48:11,320
was everything is interpretation and 
there is a manner in which that's true,

808
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:14,520
but it's not the kind of final truth 
that the postmodernists likes.

809
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:15,453
Like to think it is,
there are a little too tangled up in 

810
00:48:17,501 --> 00:48:19,030
language.
So,

811
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:24,530
and that's not a good thing.
So here's where we're at with regards to

812
00:48:26,021 --> 00:48:26,854
the um,
to the spread of postmodern neo Marxist 

813
00:48:30,161 --> 00:48:30,670
ideas.

814
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:31,780
And these are,
see,

815
00:48:31,781 --> 00:48:32,614
I've been trying,
you know how you can identify the right 

816
00:48:35,321 --> 00:48:36,154
wingers you don't want to hang around 
with because they talk about white 

817
00:48:38,381 --> 00:48:40,960
supremacy and maybe they have a 
swastika.

818
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,390
It's like that's a little sign saying if
you're a conservative,

819
00:48:43,391 --> 00:48:44,224
move away from those people.
And most conservatives do that in the 

820
00:48:47,801 --> 00:48:49,750
aftermath of Charlottesville.
For example,

821
00:48:49,751 --> 00:48:53,230
Shapiro immediately distanced himself 
from the radical right.

822
00:48:53,231 --> 00:48:54,064
And William Buckley did the same thing 
in the 1960 [inaudible] 1970s when he 

823
00:48:57,701 --> 00:48:59,860
divorced himself from the John Birch 
society.

824
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,830
Conservatives are pretty good at putting
borders around things.

825
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:03,843
In fact,
that's a good definition of a 

826
00:49:04,661 --> 00:49:06,430
conservative.
I'm serious.

827
00:49:06,431 --> 00:49:07,264
I'm serious.
Like conservatives like to have borders 

828
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:11,350
around things,
whereas liberals think,

829
00:49:11,351 --> 00:49:14,200
well if you have too many borders,
information can't flow.

830
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,153
And that's true.
And the Conservatives say no borders 

831
00:49:17,651 --> 00:49:21,160
chaos and the chaos and the liberals say
too many borders,

832
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:22,270
stagnation.

833
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:25,450
And those are both right,
so you have to argue about how thick the

834
00:49:25,451 --> 00:49:27,310
borders should be.
But anyways,

835
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:28,413
liberals have a hell of a time drawing 
borders and that means they can't 

836
00:49:31,031 --> 00:49:35,920
separate themselves from the radical 
leftists who have absolutely no interest

837
00:49:35,921 --> 00:49:38,800
whatsoever in sustaining the genuine 
liberals.

838
00:49:38,801 --> 00:49:43,210
They just use them as useful idiots to 
take a phrase from the Soviet Union.

839
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:45,370
And here are the hallmarks,
I think,

840
00:49:45,371 --> 00:49:46,204
of the pathological left.
I think that if someone is pushing this 

841
00:49:50,411 --> 00:49:53,740
quaternary on you,
then you should,

842
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:57,970
you should be very suspicious of them in
every possible way and you should resist

843
00:49:57,971 --> 00:50:00,760
it as much as you possibly can.
Diversity,

844
00:50:00,761 --> 00:50:02,590
inclusivity,
well,

845
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:03,910
you know,
those are,

846
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:06,250
those are the minor demons of the 
radical left.

847
00:50:06,251 --> 00:50:07,840
Let's say equity.
It's like,

848
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:10,390
no,
we're not going there.

849
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:14,140
That's equality of outcome,
not equality of opportunity and equality

850
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:14,974
of outcome.
I'll tell you why in a bit is an 

851
00:50:16,841 --> 00:50:18,730
absolutely pathological idea.

852
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:21,910
There's nothing about it that's good.
It's impossible to implement.

853
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,870
It's fundamentally motivated by 
resentment and it's a lie.

854
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:27,363
So I liked fact that those three make 
the acronym die though because that 

855
00:50:30,591 --> 00:50:33,590
seems to be approximately appropriate.
So,

856
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:37,953
and then the worst of the bunch is white
privilege because as far as I'm 

857
00:50:40,251 --> 00:50:42,890
concerned,
there's absolutely no difference between

858
00:50:42,891 --> 00:50:45,650
that statement and an outright racist 
slur.

859
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:48,410
They're the same thing.
So,

860
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:51,110
and it's quite straight forward.
Why it's not,

861
00:50:51,111 --> 00:50:53,180
it doesn't take a bloody genius to 
figure this out.

862
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:58,420
I mean what constitutes racism?
It's the description of the hypothetical

863
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:01,820
qualities of group to all the 
individuals who compose that group.

864
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:03,013
So white privileged.
It's like even the people who are 

865
00:51:05,841 --> 00:51:08,810
interested in intersectionality you'd 
think would have some problem with that.

866
00:51:08,811 --> 00:51:09,644
It's like what about all the poor white 
people while they're more privileged 

867
00:51:12,261 --> 00:51:14,210
than the poor people who aren't white I 
suppose.

868
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:15,740
But,
but you know,

869
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:18,860
that's a pretty bloody week argument in 
my estimation.

870
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,200
And to call it privilege is also 
something.

871
00:51:21,201 --> 00:51:22,034
And to associate it with race per se is 
also something extraordinarily 

872
00:51:24,621 --> 00:51:26,540
interesting.
And we'll get into that a little bit.

873
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:30,230
So let's talk about diversity.
Okay,

874
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,270
well first of all,
we have to define it.

875
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:33,733
You know,
and Jonathan Hyde has been trying to 

876
00:51:34,551 --> 00:51:35,384
define it as diversity of opinion.
I think it might be useful to define it 

877
00:51:38,511 --> 00:51:39,344
as diversity of personality because 
there's actually more variability in 

878
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:42,974
personality within groups of people 
regardless of the groups than there is 

879
00:51:46,191 --> 00:51:48,440
between groups of people.
So that should be said.

880
00:51:48,441 --> 00:51:49,274
Again,
there's more variability within groups 

881
00:51:51,321 --> 00:51:52,154
of people then between groups of people 
and to state otherwise is to state 

882
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:58,730
something that is in fact categorically 
racist.

883
00:51:58,910 --> 00:51:59,840
Because if I said,
well,

884
00:51:59,841 --> 00:52:03,350
there's more difference between groups 
of people than within groups,

885
00:52:03,351 --> 00:52:07,250
then I'm saying that each racial group 
is an entity unto itself,

886
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,460
which could be true but happens to 
actually not be.

887
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:11,893
So the diversity definition is really 
quite interesting in right now that's 

888
00:52:15,501 --> 00:52:17,540
being defined by race,
sex,

889
00:52:17,541 --> 00:52:20,090
or gender,
sexual orientation and disability.

890
00:52:20,091 --> 00:52:24,650
Although there's a very large number of 
other potential dimensions of,

891
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:29,690
of difference that could be included in 
the list of oppressed versus oppressor.

892
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:32,660
That's actually why intersectionality 
has emerged,

893
00:52:32,661 --> 00:52:34,700
you know,
because people figured out,

894
00:52:34,701 --> 00:52:35,870
well,
you know,

895
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,790
you're having a harder time if you're 
black,

896
00:52:37,791 --> 00:52:38,624
let's say,
and you're having a harder time if 

897
00:52:40,701 --> 00:52:44,390
you're a woman,
depending on how you define harder time,

898
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,850
um,
but you're even having a harder time.

899
00:52:46,851 --> 00:52:49,130
If you're a black woman,
there's an intersection there.

900
00:52:49,131 --> 00:52:49,761
It's like,
okay,

901
00:52:49,761 --> 00:52:52,370
fine.
Well where are we going to stop with the

902
00:52:52,371 --> 00:52:54,530
intersections?
I figured out the other day,

903
00:52:54,531 --> 00:52:55,364
if you,
if each of those categories could be 

904
00:52:56,841 --> 00:53:00,110
differentiated into a hundred sub units,
you know,

905
00:53:00,111 --> 00:53:02,090
who knows how many there are with 
gender,

906
00:53:02,091 --> 00:53:02,924
sex,
there's an infinite number of them 

907
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:04,514
apparently.

908
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:05,773
Um,
then you need six dimensions before 

909
00:53:07,161 --> 00:53:07,994
you're down to one in a billion.
So six dimensions of intersectionality 

910
00:53:10,851 --> 00:53:13,160
brings you down to the level of the 
individual,

911
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:16,400
which is the flaw in,
what would you call it?

912
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:17,740
Uh,
uh,

913
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:22,670
identity politics theory manifesting 
itself as an internal contradiction.

914
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:24,770
So I think that's very funny.
If you push,

915
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:28,350
if you push intersectionality to its 
final frontier,

916
00:53:28,351 --> 00:53:30,930
you break down every one to the level of
the individual,

917
00:53:30,931 --> 00:53:31,764
which is actually what I think western 
culture figured out about 4,000 years 

918
00:53:34,501 --> 00:53:38,670
ago is that the ultimate minority is the
individual and the only,

919
00:53:38,671 --> 00:53:39,504
and the fairest society is one where 
individuals are allowed to rise to the 

920
00:53:42,811 --> 00:53:45,000
level of their ability.
Because how,

921
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:45,863
what are you going to do?
You're going to co-vary out all their 

922
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:48,960
differences.
It's impossible.

923
00:53:48,961 --> 00:53:53,961
It's technically impossible.
There's given postmodern logic itself.

924
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:57,720
There's an infinite number of ways to 
categorize a finite number of facts.

925
00:53:57,870 --> 00:53:58,703
So how are you going to determine which 
dimensions of difference are the ones 

926
00:54:01,201 --> 00:54:03,660
that should be adjusted for the 
individual?

927
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:07,680
Since there's an unlimited number of 
dimensions of variability,

928
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:09,180
intelligence,
height,

929
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:10,830
attractiveness,
age,

930
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,440
personality,
there's five dimensions of personality,

931
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,870
socioeconomic class,
right?

932
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:19,260
Degree of historical oppression.
You know,

933
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:22,920
I that can be seriously multiplied 
endlessly.

934
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:25,380
So what are you going to do control for 
all those?

935
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,490
It's like,
good luck.

936
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:27,443
That's never going to happen.
And then diversity in the service of 

937
00:54:29,821 --> 00:54:31,590
what exactly?
You know,

938
00:54:31,591 --> 00:54:32,424
the idea that a group of people that's 
racially diverse is better at problem 

939
00:54:36,361 --> 00:54:37,194
solving.
Then a group of people who isn't there 

940
00:54:38,221 --> 00:54:40,770
isn't a shred of evidence to support 
that idea.

941
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:43,410
It's a presupposition,
a supposition,

942
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:47,020
and it also brings you back to something
like racial essential.

943
00:54:47,021 --> 00:54:49,590
Is it right?
I mean so,

944
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:52,950
so in every possible way logically and 
practically,

945
00:54:52,951 --> 00:54:53,784
it's a nonstarter and I think the 
diversity issue is irrelevant anyways 

946
00:54:57,781 --> 00:54:58,614
because I think the fundamental reason 
that the postmodern neil marks has 

947
00:55:01,951 --> 00:55:02,784
pushed diversity is because it's another
way that they can attack the power 

948
00:55:05,371 --> 00:55:08,580
structure that they regard as 
patriarchal and oppressive say,

949
00:55:08,581 --> 00:55:11,070
well,
it's in the service of the working class

950
00:55:11,071 --> 00:55:11,910
and the oppressed.

951
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:12,743
It's like we already covered that a 
little bit with regards to the Marxists 

952
00:55:15,631 --> 00:55:16,464
claims to be working on the side of the 
working class when in fact what really 

953
00:55:19,531 --> 00:55:20,364
happened was that many of them,
perhaps most were killed and the ones 

954
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:26,820
that weren't killed were certainly at 
least made extraordinarily miserable,

955
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,040
which may be is even better than killing
them.

956
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:30,600
If you're particularly malevolent

957
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:34,663
today and see one of the things that's 
happening that's quite pathological is 

958
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:41,450
and very interesting is that the 
postmodernists,

959
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:46,190
and this is I think a direct consequence
of training of activists in universities

960
00:55:46,191 --> 00:55:48,170
and the universities have more to be 
ashamed of,

961
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:50,390
then you could list in a two hour 
lecture.

962
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:51,703
I think someone estimated today that 
about 4,000 colleges and universities 

963
00:55:55,011 --> 00:55:57,290
will go bankrupt in the u s and the next
10 years.

964
00:55:57,291 --> 00:55:59,480
And as far as I'm concerned,
the faster the better.

965
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:00,763
So,
so the Toronto District School Board 

966
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:09,430
announced recently that it will now give
priority to the hiring of diverse staff,

967
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:13,250
especially in racialized backgrounds.
Why in,

968
00:56:13,251 --> 00:56:15,350
I don't know.
I suspect it's because of the pope.

969
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:18,350
People who wrote the damn policy are 
functionally illiterate,

970
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:19,663
but you'd certainly think that if you 
looked at the intelligence of their 

971
00:56:22,011 --> 00:56:27,010
policies and so what's that priority to 
the hiring of diverse staff,

972
00:56:27,011 --> 00:56:28,900
especially in racialized backgrounds.

973
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:29,733
What the hell did that mean?
I tweeted that if you weren't going to 

974
00:56:31,631 --> 00:56:35,500
hire straight white CIS is,
it's,

975
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:36,363
I guess this gendered is the same thing,
but we use it just because it's such a 

976
00:56:38,951 --> 00:56:39,784
hateful phrase.
If you're not going to hire a straight 

977
00:56:41,801 --> 00:56:42,634
CIS gendered men as teachers,
why the hell do you let them into the 

978
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:48,040
faculties of education to begin with?
The amount as well,

979
00:56:48,041 --> 00:56:51,040
just exclude them before they waste four
years on your,

980
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,113
what would you call them?
Ideologically rigid pseudo educational 

981
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:58,090
nonsense,
equity.

982
00:56:58,091 --> 00:57:01,330
This is something I really like.
There's the little happy thing,

983
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,720
equality of opportunity on the left 
versus equity on the right.

984
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:07,510
You see the little kid gets to lift up 
and eat the apple.

985
00:57:07,511 --> 00:57:10,690
Isn't that lovely?
But what happens really inequity is that

986
00:57:10,691 --> 00:57:11,524
everyone gets to have exactly the same 
depth of grave and they're perfectly 

987
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:17,890
equal when they're six feet under.

988
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,050
And if you not,
if you don't believe that,

989
00:57:20,051 --> 00:57:23,410
then you can look at what happened in 
the Ukraine in the 1930s during the hall

990
00:57:23,411 --> 00:57:24,244
on the door when the Russians decided 
that with the Soviets decided that it 

991
00:57:28,391 --> 00:57:29,224
was perfectly reasonable to ascribe 
class guilt to the successful farmers 

992
00:57:33,281 --> 00:57:37,120
and wipe them out and then starve 6 
million Ukrainians to death,

993
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:42,270
thus establishing a certain equality.
This woman,

994
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:43,383
she's,
I remind this is the shakespeare quote 

995
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:47,560
one,
I think it's from Richard the third,

996
00:57:47,561 --> 00:57:48,394
but I'm not exactly sure one can smile 
and smile and smile and still be a 

997
00:57:52,091 --> 00:57:53,560
villain.
And you know,

998
00:57:53,561 --> 00:57:56,680
she's a lovely looking old grandmotherly
type of creature.

999
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:57,514
But that doesn't mean that everything 
that she did wasn't pathological beyond 

1000
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:02,860
belief and it was her,
her,

1001
00:58:02,861 --> 00:58:04,340
what would you call them?
Uh,

1002
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:07,300
a second rate,
pseudo intellectual,

1003
00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:08,373
uh,
opinionated meanderings that produced 

1004
00:58:10,421 --> 00:58:11,370
the,
the,

1005
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,390
the concept of white privilege.

1006
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:14,463
And what she did was make a list of all 
the ways that she felt that she was 

1007
00:58:18,101 --> 00:58:21,640
particularly privileged in society.
That was her bloody methodology.

1008
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:22,683
And that's the sort of methodology that 
these pseudo disciplines that have 

1009
00:58:25,031 --> 00:58:25,864
invaded the universities get away with 
because the rest of the faculty are too 

1010
00:58:28,811 --> 00:58:32,860
damn timid to stand up and say the 
emperor has no clothes.

1011
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:33,993
Better stand up and say something about 
it pretty soon because you can bloody 

1012
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,504
well be sure that they're coming for the
physicians and the evolutionaries 

1013
00:58:39,970 --> 00:58:40,803
biologists and psychologists next.
And they're not weak and they're well 

1014
00:58:43,991 --> 00:58:46,990
organized.
And so it's a very terrible thing.

1015
00:58:46,991 --> 00:58:47,824
So anyways,
the papers rely on personal examples 

1016
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:51,603
because we know how it methodologically 
rigorous that is of unearned advantage 

1017
00:58:55,091 --> 00:58:57,550
as Mac.
But that whole methodology thing,

1018
00:58:57,551 --> 00:59:01,150
that rigorous methodology,
that's just another manifestation of the

1019
00:59:01,151 --> 00:59:01,984
euro centric patriarchy.
So you don't have to be concerned about 

1020
00:59:04,241 --> 00:59:07,810
your damn methodology when you have your
personal experience to rely on.

1021
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,540
And so here's the privileges.
I can't.

1022
00:59:10,541 --> 00:59:11,374
If I wished to arrange,
arrange to be in the company of people 

1023
00:59:13,481 --> 00:59:14,950
of my race,
most of the time,

1024
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,233
if I should need to move,
I can be pretty sure of renting or 

1025
00:59:17,831 --> 00:59:18,664
purchasing housing in an area which I 
can afford in which I would want to 

1026
00:59:21,201 --> 00:59:22,034
live.
I can be pretty sure that my neighbors 

1027
00:59:23,241 --> 00:59:27,080
in such a location will be neutral or 
pleasant to me unless they know that I'm

1028
00:59:27,081 --> 00:59:29,570
the author of the fundamental paper on 
white privilege.

1029
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:34,100
I can go shopping alone most of the 
time,

1030
00:59:34,101 --> 00:59:36,710
pretty well assured that I will not be 
followed or harassed.

1031
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:37,311
It's like,
well,

1032
00:59:37,311 --> 00:59:40,700
the first thing is,
is lot of those so called privileges are

1033
00:59:40,701 --> 00:59:41,534
just the consequence of living in a 
reasonably civilized society and apply 

1034
00:59:44,091 --> 00:59:44,924
to pretty much everyone.
And the second thing is is that there's 

1035
00:59:47,211 --> 00:59:48,044
no reason to associate this with race.
That's another one of these absolutely 

1036
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:55,610
pathological sleights of hand.
How about we call it majority privilege.

1037
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:59,990
You think that's not the case for the 
majority members of every society that's

1038
00:59:59,991 --> 01:00:02,060
ever function that's actually been 
functional?

1039
01:00:02,061 --> 01:00:02,894
Obviously there's a majority advantage.
If there wasn't a bloody majority 

1040
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:08,150
advantage,
people wouldn't make societies the whole

1041
01:00:08,151 --> 01:00:08,984
point of making a society so that the 
people within the society have the 

1042
01:00:13,101 --> 01:00:15,410
advantages.
So now you might say,

1043
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:16,244
well,
when people are being integrated into 

1044
01:00:17,421 --> 01:00:18,920
this society,
they should be given.

1045
01:00:18,921 --> 01:00:22,550
Those advantages are provided with those
advantages when they join the club,

1046
01:00:22,551 --> 01:00:24,500
so to speak,
as rapidly as possible.

1047
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:25,483
And obviously that's the case.
But to attribute this level of civility 

1048
01:00:28,911 --> 01:00:32,900
and safety to some hypothetical 
construct like white privileges,

1049
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,870
well it's exactly what you'd expect from
people who,

1050
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:37,063
who,
whose response to the idea of 

1051
01:00:38,571 --> 01:00:39,404
methodology is,
but that's just a social construct like 

1052
01:00:41,781 --> 01:00:42,950
everything else is,

1053
01:00:45,630 --> 01:00:48,810
there's the class enemies from the 
Ukraine,

1054
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:49,710
the Kulaks,
right.

1055
01:00:49,711 --> 01:00:50,544
They were the farmers who were 
productive in the 1920s and before had 

1056
01:00:53,491 --> 01:00:56,130
mirror recently emerged from the peasant
class.

1057
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:57,063
They were all rounded up and shot and 
raped and robbed and then sent to 

1058
01:01:00,091 --> 01:01:05,091
Siberia to freeze to death or to die of 
some infectious disease because to them,

1059
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:10,380
guilt was attributed as a consequence of
their membership of a class.

1060
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,770
And I can tell you if there are people 
around you that are attributing guilt to

1061
01:01:13,771 --> 01:01:15,780
you because of your membership in a 
class,

1062
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,610
they are not your friends.
In fact,

1063
01:01:17,611 --> 01:01:18,444
they're the friends of no one and 
they're contributing to this intense 

1064
01:01:20,761 --> 01:01:24,180
state of political polarization and 
racial disharmony.

1065
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:27,810
That seems to be me to be expanding at 
an exponential rate.

1066
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:28,793
It's not good.
I really liked this juxtaposition of 

1067
01:01:31,291 --> 01:01:32,124
pictures.
So when the Soviets collectivize the 

1068
01:01:34,141 --> 01:01:36,660
farms in the Ukraine,
they take,

1069
01:01:36,661 --> 01:01:40,740
took all the grain that the Ukrainians 
had had had produced,

1070
01:01:40,741 --> 01:01:41,574
which wasn't very much because they'd 
collectivize the farms and they shipped 

1071
01:01:44,071 --> 01:01:45,060
it all to the cities.

1072
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:46,103
And then the rule was that if you are a 
starving Ukrainian woman who had 

1073
01:01:48,541 --> 01:01:52,680
children and you went out in the field 
and you picked up individual half rotten

1074
01:01:52,681 --> 01:01:55,560
bits of grain to feed your kids,
that that was,

1075
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:58,740
that was a,
no offense punishable by death.

1076
01:01:58,890 --> 01:01:59,723
You were supposed to turn that in to the
local authority so they could ship that 

1077
01:02:02,161 --> 01:02:05,640
to the city too.
So on the one hand you have nice picture

1078
01:02:05,641 --> 01:02:06,474
here of the bags of grain that we're 
heroically going into the cities and in 

1079
01:02:08,941 --> 01:02:09,774
the other hand you have a picture of the
bodies that were the cost of doing 

1080
01:02:12,661 --> 01:02:13,710
precisely that.

1081
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:17,710
So let's look at the failures of this 
system.

1082
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:20,640
Well you,
you could list them forever.

1083
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:23,100
The death of the cool acts that was 
right off the bat,

1084
01:02:23,101 --> 01:02:24,660
which is why I use it.
It was very,

1085
01:02:24,661 --> 01:02:27,540
very early in the,
in the collectivization process.

1086
01:02:27,541 --> 01:02:30,460
Then the Ukrainian famine,
which I mean,

1087
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,313
I don't know how often that's taught in 
high schools in the United States and 

1088
01:02:33,601 --> 01:02:34,434
Canada,
but I would suspect never is the answer 

1089
01:02:36,271 --> 01:02:37,104
to that,
the rise of the Gulag state because it 

1090
01:02:39,061 --> 01:02:39,894
turned out that the bloody Soviet Union 
couldn't function unless they enslaved 

1091
01:02:42,661 --> 01:02:46,230
everybody and made them work the death 
of tens of millions.

1092
01:02:46,231 --> 01:02:49,200
It's uncountable.
The 56 crackdown on Hungary,

1093
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:52,510
the 68 invasion of Czechoslovakia,
not dimension,

1094
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:53,483
the whole Cold War that put the whole 
goddamn world at risk from 1962 to 1989 

1095
01:02:57,991 --> 01:03:02,430
and that still rear is rearing its ugly 
head with our current dispute with North

1096
01:03:02,430 --> 01:03:05,760
Korea,
which is the last remaining,

1097
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:10,790
let's call it ghoulag like Soviet state,
so there's the death counts.

1098
01:03:11,310 --> 01:03:14,580
Perhaps that's a relatively conservative
estimate,

1099
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:19,590
eight to 61 million in the Soviet Union.
It was quite a margin of error,

1100
01:03:19,591 --> 01:03:21,900
wouldn't you say?
That's the red terror,

1101
01:03:21,901 --> 01:03:22,734
the great purge,
the national operations of the end kvd 

1102
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:28,140
later the KGB,
the great purge in Mongolia,

1103
01:03:28,200 --> 01:03:32,340
Soviet killings during World War II,
the People's Republic of China,

1104
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:34,560
land reform,
land reform.

1105
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:36,030
That's how,
that's how you,

1106
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:37,013
that's what you call it.
When you take land that grows food and 

1107
01:03:38,971 --> 01:03:41,430
turn it into land that's just full of 
corpses.

1108
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:42,413
That's land reform and the suppression 
of counter-revolutionaries the great 

1109
01:03:46,111 --> 01:03:48,270
leap forward.
That was a good one.

1110
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:50,880
The great proletarian cultural 
revolution,

1111
01:03:50,881 --> 01:03:51,714
Cambodian,
the killing fields and then a list of 

1112
01:03:53,461 --> 01:03:54,294
other countries.
Every single place where these 

1113
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:56,783
pathological ideas were put into 
practice became what you might describe 

1114
01:04:00,751 --> 01:04:01,584
as the literal equivalent of hell on 
earth so rapidly that it was a kind of 

1115
01:04:05,101 --> 01:04:07,650
miracle in and of itself.
And yet we still,

1116
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:08,550
you know,
what is it,

1117
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:09,383
one out of five social scientists in 
American universities regard themselves 

1118
01:04:12,661 --> 01:04:13,620
as Marxists.

1119
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:15,240
It's like,
what the hell?

1120
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,070
Really,
really?

1121
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:20,790
What is going on with that?
I don't understand that in the least.

1122
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:25,980
You know,
I don't understand why that pathological

1123
01:04:25,981 --> 01:04:26,814
ideology that's so murderous,
so intensely murderers and so closely 

1124
01:04:30,121 --> 01:04:34,760
tied to the genocides from a causal 
perspective can,

1125
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:40,050
cannot have accreted to at the same,
what would you call an honorable,

1126
01:04:40,690 --> 01:04:41,523
uhh,
honorable state that Nazi-ism has 

1127
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:46,350
accrued to itself.
What's going on?

1128
01:04:46,351 --> 01:04:48,270
Why?
Why don't we see it that way?

1129
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:50,520
I don't understand that.
I mean,

1130
01:04:50,521 --> 01:04:51,354
maybe it's because of the hypothetical 
universal utopia that the damn Soviets 

1131
01:04:54,691 --> 01:04:55,524
were aiming at.
Maybe you could get away with that in 

1132
01:04:56,911 --> 01:05:01,380
1895 you know,
or maybe after world war one when things

1133
01:05:01,381 --> 01:05:02,214
were brutal and the monarchies of Europe
were collapsing and everything was 

1134
01:05:05,221 --> 01:05:08,250
chaotic,
you didn't know that your Utopian ideas,

1135
01:05:08,251 --> 01:05:10,830
we're going to result in an absolute 
catastrophe,

1136
01:05:10,831 --> 01:05:11,664
but it's a hundred years after that now 
almost to the day and when the evidence 

1137
01:05:14,971 --> 01:05:17,410
is clearly in I'm a Marxist,
it's no,

1138
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:18,393
you're just jealous because you don't 
make as much as a bloody investment 

1139
01:05:21,131 --> 01:05:23,800
banker.
So that's why you're a bloody

1140
01:05:26,170 --> 01:05:29,170
Marxist.
Fewer paid four times as much.

1141
01:05:29,171 --> 01:05:31,990
You'd be a capitalist so fast it would 
make your head spin.

1142
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,333
I'm going to talk for 15 more minutes 
because we started a little late and I 

1143
01:05:40,891 --> 01:05:43,050
do want to get through this.
So what's the problem?

1144
01:05:43,051 --> 01:05:43,884
Well,
we already discussed it and I want to 

1145
01:05:44,821 --> 01:05:47,040
show you a different way of 
conceptualizing it.

1146
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:51,660
This is based on some of the work that 
I've done on archetypes and I think of,

1147
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:54,180
I think of archetypes,
has images,

1148
01:05:54,181 --> 01:05:57,030
stick representations of the axioms of 
thought.

1149
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:00,960
That's a reasonable way of,
or maybe of the axioms of being itself.

1150
01:06:00,961 --> 01:06:04,200
There are categories of being pain is a 
category of being,

1151
01:06:04,201 --> 01:06:06,570
for example,
a suffering limitation.

1152
01:06:06,571 --> 01:06:07,404
Finitude.
Those are all categories of being and 

1153
01:06:09,181 --> 01:06:10,014
they're very realistic.
They're the fundamental elements of 

1154
01:06:12,361 --> 01:06:14,100
existence.
Essentially.

1155
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:17,700
It's a different different in some sense
than a materialist view point,

1156
01:06:17,701 --> 01:06:18,534
you know,
because the materialists make the claim 

1157
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:21,083
and perfectly reasonable in some sense 
that the fundamental realities are 

1158
01:06:24,001 --> 01:06:24,834
material,
but they're only the fundamental 

1159
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:30,390
realities in some sense if you define 
them that way,

1160
01:06:30,391 --> 01:06:31,224
not that that isn't useful and not that 
you can't derive objective truth that's 

1161
01:06:34,951 --> 01:06:35,784
pragmatically useful from that,
but the fundamental realities of life 

1162
01:06:39,391 --> 01:06:41,790
have a lot more to do with motivation 
and emotion,

1163
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:43,560
especially with regards to suffering.

1164
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:46,920
And so that is the unsolved problem of 
human existence.

1165
01:06:46,921 --> 01:06:47,754
And we talked about the different ways 
of conceptualizing that and I want to 

1166
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:54,900
walk you quickly through some of my 
thinking about the root,

1167
01:06:54,901 --> 01:06:59,220
the true roots of of suffering and human
vulnerability.

1168
01:06:59,221 --> 01:07:03,120
And I think of this as an antidote to 
ideological possession.

1169
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:07,110
I think that this is the fundamental map
of religious belief.

1170
01:07:07,111 --> 01:07:08,640
And I'll walk you through it very 
quickly.

1171
01:07:08,641 --> 01:07:09,474
And that what happens,
what happens in the case of an ideology 

1172
01:07:13,111 --> 01:07:13,944
is an ideology takes a fragment of a 
religious belief system and expands it 

1173
01:07:18,091 --> 01:07:18,924
up into a totality and has its motive 
power because it draws on these 

1174
01:07:22,441 --> 01:07:27,030
underlying religious slash archetipal 
narratives for its power.

1175
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:28,510
So for example,
you know the,

1176
01:07:28,770 --> 01:07:31,290
the idea of the future socialist utopia 
is very,

1177
01:07:31,291 --> 01:07:34,110
very similar to the idea of the Kingdom 
of heaven on earth.

1178
01:07:34,111 --> 01:07:35,070
It was always,
you know,

1179
01:07:35,071 --> 01:07:37,620
that's a cardinal element of,
of,

1180
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:38,693
of the three western major religions.
So here's a way of conceptualizing 

1181
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:44,633
existence.
And each of these levels of 

1182
01:07:46,231 --> 01:07:49,470
conceptualization have their own 
symbolic representations.

1183
01:07:49,471 --> 01:07:50,304
And you can see these what portrayed 
consistently throughout the narratives 

1184
01:07:55,731 --> 01:07:56,564
that we use to guide our existence.
Even the ones that we don't understand 

1185
01:07:59,211 --> 01:08:00,590
explicitly,
they come up in,

1186
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:01,753
in,
in movies and in and in books and in 

1187
01:08:03,951 --> 01:08:04,784
myths and the stories we tell each other
and in our dreams and our imagination 

1188
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:08,773
constantly.
So they're really the categories of the 

1189
01:08:10,161 --> 01:08:10,994
imagination.
And so the first category and the one 

1190
01:08:13,791 --> 01:08:16,220
that's most difficult to,
I called the dragon

1191
01:08:16,220 --> 01:08:19,670
of chaos.
It's sort of the outer most circle.

1192
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,590
That's a good illustration of it.
They're the dragon is a very large,

1193
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:25,453
a very common symbol worldwide.
And an anthropologist slash biologist 

1194
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:32,720
who I recently read called it a sneak 
cat bird,

1195
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:34,670
which I really liked.
Um,

1196
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:37,100
and he thought about it as an amalgam of
the,

1197
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:39,410
of the idea of Predator,
you know,

1198
01:08:39,411 --> 01:08:40,244
because our tree dwelling ancestors and 
after that we're basically prayed on 

1199
01:08:43,610 --> 01:08:44,443
burt by birds of prey by predatory cats 
and by snakes and so well and God only 

1200
01:08:48,921 --> 01:08:51,950
knows how much,
how many times fire did the men as well.

1201
01:08:51,951 --> 01:08:55,010
So a fire breathing tree,
cat tree,

1202
01:08:55,011 --> 01:08:55,844
snake bird is a,
is a very good representation of the 

1203
01:08:58,641 --> 01:09:02,240
category of everything that's out there 
in the unknown that can do you in.

1204
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:03,463
And that become elaborated over the 
course of time into the idea of the 

1205
01:09:05,931 --> 01:09:09,380
dragon that hoards gold or that hoards 
virgins for that matter.

1206
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:12,920
The idea being that human beings are 
half pray and half Predator.

1207
01:09:12,921 --> 01:09:13,754
And so that we have to make a 
representation of that which exists 

1208
01:09:17,241 --> 01:09:19,790
beyond our comprehension that can do 
[inaudible].

1209
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:22,340
And so that's the,
the dragon of chaos,

1210
01:09:22,341 --> 01:09:23,174
let's say.
But also come to understand that 

1211
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:25,994
confronting that voluntarily is the 
appropriate way to gather new 

1212
01:09:28,821 --> 01:09:29,654
information and to survive.
And that's really the fundamental human 

1213
01:09:32,391 --> 01:09:33,224
story,
fundamental human stories to go boldly 

1214
01:09:36,261 --> 01:09:37,094
where no one has gone before and what 
you encounter are the terrible dragons 

1215
01:09:41,481 --> 01:09:44,180
that exist beyond your field of 
comprehension.

1216
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:45,223
And if you can manage that forthrightly,
then you gathered the kind of 

1217
01:09:47,781 --> 01:09:50,930
information and riches that enables you 
to develop yourself,

1218
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:53,540
character logically,
and to benefit your community.

1219
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:57,650
That's the fundamental story of mankind,
the fundamental positive story.

1220
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:00,350
And that's the underpinning of the hero 
mythology.

1221
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:01,573
So,
which is a lovely antidote to 

1222
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:05,150
ideological presupposition.

1223
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,840
So that's the outer most,
the,

1224
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:09,043
the outer most reality you would say.
That's the unknown unknowns that Donald 

1225
01:10:12,830 --> 01:10:13,460
Rumsfeld,
uh,

1226
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:14,293
referred to and nested inside that are 
the terrible things about life that you 

1227
01:10:18,561 --> 01:10:20,350
actually encounter,
that you,

1228
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:23,600
they're not the hypothetical things that
might get you there.

1229
01:10:23,601 --> 01:10:26,570
The actual things that you encounter 
that you don't know.

1230
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:29,180
And some of those are positive and some 
of those are negative,

1231
01:10:29,181 --> 01:10:29,690
you know,
and,

1232
01:10:29,690 --> 01:10:34,130
and that can even flip because sometimes
your life is turned upside down by let's

1233
01:10:34,131 --> 01:10:38,480
say by a rejection from someone you love
should be a good example of the terrible

1234
01:10:38,481 --> 01:10:40,670
mother that's the great mother on the 
outer ring.

1235
01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:42,123
Um,
but that can mature you and make you 

1236
01:10:43,731 --> 01:10:46,030
wake up as well.
And so the,

1237
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:48,470
the encounter with,
with these,

1238
01:10:48,590 --> 01:10:51,680
with the things that transcend your,
what would you call it,

1239
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:54,830
your competence or also things that can 
make you grow and mature.

1240
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:56,263
So you could think of the great mother 
as nature and the great father as 

1241
01:10:59,751 --> 01:11:03,500
culture and the individual as the person
who is enveloped by culture.

1242
01:11:03,501 --> 01:11:04,334
And by nature,
when you move to the fringes of your 

1243
01:11:06,291 --> 01:11:08,840
culture,
you encounter nature itself.

1244
01:11:08,841 --> 01:11:11,060
And that's the case,
let's say geographically,

1245
01:11:11,061 --> 01:11:13,070
but it's also the case conceptually,
right?

1246
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:14,580
Because if you're the master

1247
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:17,730
of a field of endeavor,
which is a geographical metaphor,

1248
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:21,720
you move towards the fringes so that you
can stand on the unknown,

1249
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:22,853
encounter something that's new,
transform what's new and inhabitable 

1250
01:11:25,921 --> 01:11:29,010
territory and extend the dimension of 
human capacity.

1251
01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:33,090
And so it works on a practical 
geographical level of representation,

1252
01:11:33,091 --> 01:11:35,370
but also on a,
on a,

1253
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,353
on an abstract level.
And so you can also think about it as a 

1254
01:11:39,451 --> 01:11:40,284
person on an island in an ocean.
That's a good way of thinking about the 

1255
01:11:42,841 --> 01:11:43,674
human condition.
Except the person has two elements and 

1256
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:47,273
the island has two elements.
And so does the ocean and the persons 

1257
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:50,693
two elements are classically speaking,
the good and evil that wars in their 

1258
01:11:54,781 --> 01:11:57,630
heart.
Because it isn't so self evident exactly

1259
01:11:57,631 --> 01:11:58,464
where your enemy is.
And it might be the class structure 

1260
01:12:00,121 --> 01:12:00,954
that's oppressing you,
but it might be the snake in your own 

1261
01:12:02,911 --> 01:12:03,720
heart.

1262
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:04,553
And it's certainly the case that if you 
read people like Viktor Frankl and 

1263
01:12:06,841 --> 01:12:07,674
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn just to take it 
start who were very perspicacious 

1264
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:17,300
interpreters of the catastrophes of Nazi
as Admin and and the Soviet Union,

1265
01:12:17,850 --> 01:12:18,683
both of their conclusions was.
The fundamental problem with both both 

1266
01:12:21,301 --> 01:12:24,900
of those systems is that the individuals
within the systems allowed themselves to

1267
01:12:24,901 --> 01:12:27,570
be corrupted by what was in their own 
hearts.

1268
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:30,690
And so one of the things that's 
absolutely horrible,

1269
01:12:30,691 --> 01:12:31,524
I think about the Marxist and 
postmodernist viewpoint is that it 

1270
01:12:34,261 --> 01:12:39,261
doesn't attribute any of the pathology 
that's all all projected onto the social

1271
01:12:39,331 --> 01:12:41,940
world to the individual,
him or herself.

1272
01:12:42,210 --> 01:12:44,490
And you might say,
well that's where the fundamental battle

1273
01:12:44,491 --> 01:12:45,324
takes place.
And I would also say that the idea that 

1274
01:12:47,970 --> 01:12:48,803
existence is a battle between good and 
evil and it's the battle of the soul is 

1275
01:12:52,081 --> 01:12:56,250
a consequence of the symbolic 
realization of Western civilization.

1276
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:57,293
That the evil that has to be confronted 
most forthrightly as actually the 

1277
01:13:00,271 --> 01:13:04,350
individual that obtains that evil that 
obtains to the individual.

1278
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:08,850
And that it's primarily an ethical issue
at the individual level.

1279
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,130
And that's what you take responsibility 
for.

1280
01:13:11,131 --> 01:13:11,964
It.
If you forget that you projected on to 

1281
01:13:13,051 --> 01:13:13,884
other people,
you take no responsibility for it and 

1282
01:13:15,781 --> 01:13:17,760
you end up thinking that you're the good
guy.

1283
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:18,893
And you probably shouldn't think that 
because if you thought for about 15 

1284
01:13:21,691 --> 01:13:24,570
minutes about all the stupid things that
you've done in your life,

1285
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:25,613
you could add malevolent things as well.
You could figure out for yourself quite 

1286
01:13:28,801 --> 01:13:29,634
quickly that the probability that you're
the saint and that everyone else is the 

1287
01:13:32,521 --> 01:13:33,660
villain is,
is,

1288
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:38,220
is only an indication of precisely how 
villainous you are.

1289
01:13:39,330 --> 01:13:40,163
So,
and then with regards to the social 

1290
01:13:41,281 --> 01:13:42,114
structure,
well obviously it's pathological and 

1291
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:45,810
tyrannical and corrupted,
deceitful,

1292
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:46,860
you know,
it's,

1293
01:13:46,860 --> 01:13:47,693
it's partly a structure of the dad and 
people are corrupt to some degree and 

1294
01:13:51,571 --> 01:13:52,590
willfully blind.

1295
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:55,620
And so that's an archetypal truth.
That's part of the throne.

1296
01:13:55,621 --> 01:13:57,000
This,
that we discussed earlier,

1297
01:13:57,180 --> 01:13:58,013
you have this infrastructure that 
surrounds you both physical and 

1298
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:04,020
conceptual and you're,
it's beneficiary and its victim.

1299
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:07,990
It's partly pathological and corrupt.
It's always been that way.

1300
01:14:07,991 --> 01:14:12,310
And you're damn lucky that it isn't just
purely corrupt because that's frequently

1301
01:14:12,311 --> 01:14:13,144
the case.
And so what your job is not to whine 

1302
01:14:15,071 --> 01:14:17,590
about the fact that it's corrupt,
that's self evident.

1303
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:21,910
You're job is to straighten yourself up 
enough so that you can straighten up the

1304
01:14:21,911 --> 01:14:22,744
culture.
And that's the old motif of rescuing 

1305
01:14:25,241 --> 01:14:27,700
your father from the belly of the whale,
let's say,

1306
01:14:27,701 --> 01:14:28,534
which is part of the necessary process 
by which people become fully developed 

1307
01:14:33,131 --> 01:14:33,964
individuals.
What you're supposed to be doing in 

1308
01:14:34,961 --> 01:14:36,580
university,
in the humanities.

1309
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:41,980
You don't just study the great ideas of 
Western culture [inaudible] you just,

1310
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:42,843
you,
you study the pathology of history and 

1311
01:14:44,831 --> 01:14:46,240
know that it's about you.

1312
01:14:46,510 --> 01:14:47,343
And then maybe you try to culture 
yourself and discipline yourself to the 

1313
01:14:50,291 --> 01:14:51,124
point where you have enough of an 
internal ethic so that when you take 

1314
01:14:54,431 --> 01:14:58,210
your place in the patriarchy,
for lack of a better word,

1315
01:14:58,270 --> 01:15:01,570
you're going to be a force for good 
rather than a force for evil.

1316
01:15:01,690 --> 01:15:02,523
And then maybe the damn thing tilts a 
bit towards the good instead of the 

1317
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:06,453
catastrophe.
And then maybe you've done something 

1318
01:15:08,081 --> 01:15:11,890
that's worthwhile and then nature.
Well,

1319
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,233
you know,
if you,

1320
01:15:13,390 --> 01:15:14,223
it's very easy to romanticize nature,
especially if you're a city dweller 

1321
01:15:17,711 --> 01:15:19,540
who's never had to,
you know,

1322
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:20,763
wander out in the northern woods in the 
middle of the summer and get eaten by 

1323
01:15:23,471 --> 01:15:24,304
black flies and mosquitoes starving to 
death while trying to track down an 

1324
01:15:27,521 --> 01:15:30,910
animal.
It's very easy to romanticize nature.

1325
01:15:30,911 --> 01:15:31,744
Of course,
cancer and other diseases tend to 

1326
01:15:33,431 --> 01:15:36,130
disabuse you of the pure beauty of 
nature.

1327
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:39,400
And nature is a very,
very destructive force.

1328
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:40,234
It's,
it's against us all the time as well as 

1329
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:45,220
for us.
And another thing that's really not well

1330
01:15:45,221 --> 01:15:46,054
balanced in our society is the anti 
humanism that's become part and parcel 

1331
01:15:50,020 --> 01:15:54,370
of radical discussions everywhere.
Human beings are regarded as a cancer on

1332
01:15:54,371 --> 01:15:56,410
the planet.
To quote the,

1333
01:15:56,710 --> 01:15:58,480
what was that?
The club of Rome,

1334
01:15:58,780 --> 01:15:59,613
um,
worrying about the population explosion 

1335
01:16:01,451 --> 01:16:02,284
and we're all guilty because we're 
destroying things as fast as we can 

1336
01:16:04,361 --> 01:16:06,460
possibly manage.
It's like Jesus,

1337
01:16:06,550 --> 01:16:08,980
everything around us is always trying to
kill us.

1338
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,410
Most of the time we're just trying to 
stay alive.

1339
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:13,300
I mean,
we're not perfect.

1340
01:16:13,301 --> 01:16:17,020
We're corrupt and sora social structures
and people get greedy and careless.

1341
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:18,153
But it's not like nature's all shining a
wonderful young lady waiting in the 

1342
01:16:23,051 --> 01:16:23,884
wilderness to embrace us positively.
It's the old hag that's going to kill 

1343
01:16:27,401 --> 01:16:31,390
you every possible way and you need to 
defend yourself against that.

1344
01:16:31,390 --> 01:16:32,223
And you know,
human beings have only been in a 

1345
01:16:33,491 --> 01:16:34,324
position since 1960 since we ever had 
any conceptualization of our potential 

1346
01:16:39,341 --> 01:16:42,130
to change the planet on a planetary 
scale.

1347
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:44,710
It's been like four generations.
You know,

1348
01:16:44,711 --> 01:16:45,544
back in the 1890s Thomas Huxley was 
commissioned by the English parliament 

1349
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:51,633
to,
to investigate the carrying capacity of 

1350
01:16:54,761 --> 01:16:56,890
the oceans and his,
he was a great biologist.

1351
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:57,903
His report was that there are so damn 
many fish in the ocean that every human 

1352
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:02,074
being could fish every day for the rest 
of his life and catch everything he 

1353
01:17:05,291 --> 01:17:08,230
possibly could and we wouldn't put a 
dent in it.

1354
01:17:08,740 --> 01:17:09,381
And that's,
you know,

1355
01:17:09,381 --> 01:17:10,214
that's only 120 years ago.
We only woke up to the fact that we 

1356
01:17:12,921 --> 01:17:16,520
became a planetary force in 1960 it's 
like,

1357
01:17:16,521 --> 01:17:19,100
what the hell do you expect from people?
You know,

1358
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:23,900
we're trying to get ourselves together 
as fast as we can and might be decent of

1359
01:17:23,901 --> 01:17:24,734
us to stop with the anti human rhetoric,
which is only going to lead to a bad 

1360
01:17:28,131 --> 01:17:28,870
end.

1361
01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:31,190
You know,
if human beings are nothing but a cancer

1362
01:17:31,191 --> 01:17:32,024
on the planet,
then it's the bloody hero who 

1363
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:33,914
obliterates them.
Isn't that because it's the hero who 

1364
01:17:35,391 --> 01:17:36,224
gets rid of cancer?
And when people watch the school 

1365
01:17:39,471 --> 01:17:41,360
shooters in the mass shooters and they 
think,

1366
01:17:41,361 --> 01:17:42,194
well,
what is it that motivates people like 

1367
01:17:43,311 --> 01:17:44,144
that in which they can figure out about 
half an hour if they did the proper 

1368
01:17:46,851 --> 01:17:48,920
reading,
just read what they wrote.

1369
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:52,490
Human beings are a cancer on the planet 
being as evil.

1370
01:17:52,491 --> 01:17:53,324
Intrinsically,
I'm going to take out everything I can 

1371
01:17:55,550 --> 01:17:56,383
to show my displeasure with the 
structure of reality and then I'm going 

1372
01:17:59,181 --> 01:18:02,270
to shoot myself just to show you how 
little I care.

1373
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:05,480
And if you can't understand that,
then you haven't looked very deeply into

1374
01:18:05,481 --> 01:18:08,060
your own heart because there could be a 
time in your life.

1375
01:18:08,061 --> 01:18:08,894
Believe me,
where something terrible enough happens 

1376
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:13,040
to you so that you'll be able to 
understand that perfectly.

1377
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:19,700
Here's the Christian representation of 
the same thing,

1378
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:22,640
right?
So the great mothers on the outside,

1379
01:18:22,641 --> 01:18:25,550
that's nature and then the fathers in 
the middle.

1380
01:18:25,551 --> 01:18:28,610
And in that representation,
which I really liked,

1381
01:18:28,611 --> 01:18:29,444
that's from 13th century,
you see God the father who's a 

1382
01:18:32,391 --> 01:18:33,224
representation of culture holding the 
suffering individual who similar 

1383
01:18:37,131 --> 01:18:37,964
caneously transcends his suffering.
That's the goal to be the suffering 

1384
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:44,240
individual who simultaneously transcends
his suffering.

1385
01:18:44,450 --> 01:18:47,300
That's why all those people on the 
inside of the open virgin,

1386
01:18:47,301 --> 01:18:51,290
which is what that sculpture is called,
our gazing at that image because they're

1387
01:18:51,291 --> 01:18:53,450
trying to figure out what the hell it 
means.

1388
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:56,210
While people have been gazing at it for 
2000 years,

1389
01:18:56,211 --> 01:18:57,044
trying to figure out what it means.
And one of the things that you can be 

1390
01:18:59,271 --> 01:19:00,104
sure of is that that story and what that
image represents is absolutely central 

1391
01:19:03,681 --> 01:19:05,780
to the integrity of Western 
civilization.

1392
01:19:10,930 --> 01:19:15,310
Five more minutes.
This is an image of,

1393
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:16,173
of,
I would call it the patriarchy and it's 

1394
01:19:18,031 --> 01:19:21,070
a lot of lovely image.
It's God the father and he's assimilated

1395
01:19:21,071 --> 01:19:21,904
to the sun because well,
because consciousness which is 

1396
01:19:25,481 --> 01:19:27,830
associated with light is the builder of 
culture.

1397
01:19:27,831 --> 01:19:28,670
And,
um,

1398
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:32,710
he rules over the walled city.
And so he's the centering idea.

1399
01:19:32,711 --> 01:19:34,960
You might say that that unites a 
culture.

1400
01:19:34,961 --> 01:19:37,510
That's another way of looking at it.
And he's got two hands.

1401
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:41,380
I described them as security and tyranny
altogether order.

1402
01:19:41,381 --> 01:19:43,720
And you know,
if you're in a university,

1403
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:45,910
the U of t students complain about this 
all the time,

1404
01:19:45,911 --> 01:19:48,060
they're 60,000 u of t student,
right?

1405
01:19:48,061 --> 01:19:48,894
They feel like numbers,
they feel ignored and no wonder because 

1406
01:19:51,631 --> 01:19:52,464
their numbers and they are ignored.
It's no wonder they didn't feel that 

1407
01:19:54,751 --> 01:19:56,520
way.
You know,

1408
01:19:56,521 --> 01:20:00,270
and there's huge classes of 1200 people 
and they get lost and they think,

1409
01:20:00,271 --> 01:20:01,104
God,
that's a pretty evil structure and 

1410
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:03,180
uncaring.

1411
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:04,020
It's like,
yeah,

1412
01:20:04,021 --> 01:20:06,360
that's exactly right.
But by the same token,

1413
01:20:06,630 --> 01:20:07,463
you know,
get to purchase four years of 

1414
01:20:08,461 --> 01:20:09,294
intellectual freedom and you have all 
these people who could at least in 

1415
01:20:11,701 --> 01:20:12,534
principle,
teach you something and you get an 

1416
01:20:13,771 --> 01:20:14,604
identity out of the deal.
And if you have half a half a bit of 

1417
01:20:16,981 --> 01:20:17,814
sense here in the library trying to read
great things and maybe you're not quite 

1418
01:20:20,191 --> 01:20:23,280
as dopey and useless when you come out 
as you were when you went in.

1419
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,900
And so it takes with one hand and gives 
with the other and you got to understand

1420
01:20:27,901 --> 01:20:30,450
that about your position in relationship
to society.

1421
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:33,090
It crushes you in molds you at the same 
time,

1422
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:37,260
it limits you and furthers your compute 
capability at the same time.

1423
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:38,273
And it's up to you to determine how to 
establish a harmonious and productive 

1424
01:20:40,981 --> 01:20:44,850
relationship with that because that's 
one of the fundamental demands of life

1425
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:50,530
that's sort of splits into these two 
things.

1426
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:55,300
That's the s the king who devours his 
son.

1427
01:20:55,330 --> 01:20:56,163
I love that picture and that's,
well that's a society that's become 

1428
01:20:59,231 --> 01:21:00,130
tyrannical,
right?

1429
01:21:00,131 --> 01:21:03,070
I'm the son of the king is the thing 
that regenerates the king,

1430
01:21:03,490 --> 01:21:07,300
the kings old and he's blind and he's 
stupid and he's corrupt and he has a son

1431
01:21:07,301 --> 01:21:10,180
and the son is lively and awake and 
alert and can see.

1432
01:21:10,450 --> 01:21:11,283
And if the father is not pathological,
then he tries to make the sun strong so 

1433
01:21:14,771 --> 01:21:17,500
that the son can grow up and revitalize 
the culture.

1434
01:21:17,710 --> 01:21:19,570
And if he's a tyrant,
weld any devours him.

1435
01:21:19,571 --> 01:21:23,350
And then he gets old and corrupt and 
everything goes to into chaos.

1436
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:28,800
And then there's the benevolent Kane 
who's got that properly balanced.

1437
01:21:29,441 --> 01:21:32,740
And you see in this picture he's got a 
globe but his hand with the cross on top

1438
01:21:32,741 --> 01:21:33,574
of it.
And that's means the same thing that 

1439
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:36,093
other symbolic image did,
which is that the proper society 

1440
01:21:39,161 --> 01:21:39,994
supports the suffering individual in his
or her attempts to transcend their 

1441
01:21:43,781 --> 01:21:47,110
suffering and attain a proper ethical 
perspective.

1442
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,700
And then the son of the father is the 
hero.

1443
01:21:51,701 --> 01:21:53,590
That's Hercules'.
I really liked that picture.

1444
01:21:53,591 --> 01:21:54,424
So Hercules' goes out into the darkness 
and he's got this container and maybe 

1445
01:21:57,461 --> 01:21:59,950
you can think of that container as a 
cultural artifact,

1446
01:21:59,951 --> 01:22:00,784
you know,
because the culture protects you from 

1447
01:22:02,231 --> 01:22:03,910
chaos.
And then the question is,

1448
01:22:03,911 --> 01:22:05,800
what are you supposed to do with that 
protection?

1449
01:22:06,070 --> 01:22:09,430
And the answer is you're supposed to 
wear the garb of the lion,

1450
01:22:09,431 --> 01:22:11,110
right?
That's the king of the beasts.

1451
01:22:11,111 --> 01:22:11,944
So that's supposed to be you and you're 
supposed to go out there into the 

1452
01:22:14,201 --> 01:22:15,034
darkness with your bloody eyes open so 
you can discover what's in the darkness 

1453
01:22:17,591 --> 01:22:20,200
and share with everyone else.
And he's got a club,

1454
01:22:20,201 --> 01:22:22,510
they're in his hands and the club was 
covered with eyes.

1455
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:23,373
Those are eyes not barbs.
And what that means is that you should 

1456
01:22:25,631 --> 01:22:26,464
bloody well pay attention and that well 
the other element of that it's not 

1457
01:22:29,921 --> 01:22:32,710
expressed in that image,
is that you should also speak carefully,

1458
01:22:32,711 --> 01:22:34,660
pay attention,
and speak carefully,

1459
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:35,793
and then you're the proper son of the 
proper farther and you can keep things 

1460
01:22:38,231 --> 01:22:41,170
functioning and that makes you into 
this,

1461
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:42,153
right?

1462
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:45,470
So the city is always threatened,
it's always corrupted,

1463
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:46,353
threatened,
and there's always something outside 

1464
01:22:47,561 --> 01:22:48,394
that's going to take it down always.
And that's what's represented by the 

1465
01:22:51,371 --> 01:22:52,204
Dragon.
That little twist and its tail is 

1466
01:22:53,501 --> 01:22:54,334
something that represents infinity and 
the courageous individual goes out of 

1467
01:22:57,281 --> 01:22:58,114
the damage city to confront the dragon 
of chaos and to gain something valuable 

1468
01:23:02,501 --> 01:23:03,334
as a consequence.
And that's what human are supposed to 

1469
01:23:06,041 --> 01:23:08,680
do.
That's our destiny.

1470
01:23:08,681 --> 01:23:09,514
That's our soul.
That's a better way of thinking about 

1471
01:23:11,321 --> 01:23:13,960
it.
And some of that terrible dragon is just

1472
01:23:13,961 --> 01:23:14,794
the catastrophe and suffering of life 
and our continual attempts to transcend 

1473
01:23:17,751 --> 01:23:18,584
it.
But a tremendous amount of it is also 

1474
01:23:19,871 --> 01:23:24,790
the malevolence and the evil that exists
in our own hearts and in society.

1475
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:27,670
And perhaps to some degree,
even in the world itself,

1476
01:23:27,850 --> 01:23:28,683
you're supposed to wake up and 
strengthen yourself and stand up 

1477
01:23:31,451 --> 01:23:32,284
properly and fortify yourself so that 
you're a light that can shine in the 

1478
01:23:35,651 --> 01:23:36,190
darkness.

1479
01:23:36,190 --> 01:23:39,610
And that's something that can withstand 
malevolence and tragedy.

1480
01:23:40,330 --> 01:23:42,070
And what,
what's your alternative?

1481
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:46,210
You're going to let life crush you and 
make you weak and make you resentful and

1482
01:23:46,211 --> 01:23:47,044
bitter and then murderous.
You'll take out your rage on everyone 

1483
01:23:49,751 --> 01:23:53,920
you can and it will only be limited by 
your capacity to obtain power.

1484
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:58,120
That's not a good thing.
And so it's this way or it's this way or

1485
01:23:58,121 --> 01:23:58,954
a way that leads directly to hell.
And we've certainly seen that plenty of 

1486
01:24:02,021 --> 01:24:02,854
times in the last hundred years and 
you'd think we might have learned our 

1487
01:24:05,321 --> 01:24:08,620
lesson,
but it takes a lot for people to learn.

1488
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:12,370
And we're in danger of repeating exactly
the same mistakes again.

1489
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:16,920
So,
you know,

1490
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:18,593
it's one thing to complain about the 
political polarization and it's another 

1491
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:24,490
thing to point fingers out.
The postmodernist send the Neo Marxists,

1492
01:24:24,491 --> 01:24:25,324
Steven though they,
they roundly deserve it in my 

1493
01:24:28,471 --> 01:24:29,304
estimation.
It's another thing to try to figure out 

1494
01:24:31,381 --> 01:24:34,530
what the proper alternative isn't.
The proper alternative is not,

1495
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:38,220
in my estimation,
to contribute to political polarization.

1496
01:24:38,730 --> 01:24:39,563
It's not good.
And it's not that the radical right is 

1497
01:24:41,281 --> 01:24:44,730
the solution to the radical left.
It's just another catastrophe.

1498
01:24:45,150 --> 01:24:47,430
And the only solution that I've been 
able to figure out,

1499
01:24:47,431 --> 01:24:50,340
and this is as a consequence of much 
reading and much thinking,

1500
01:24:50,341 --> 01:24:51,174
is that it's up to the individuals in 
our society is sort themselves out into 

1501
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:59,280
strengthen themselves,
to become wise and alert and to shoulder

1502
01:24:59,281 --> 01:25:02,070
the responsibility of being and the 
demand,

1503
01:25:02,071 --> 01:25:02,904
the ethical demand to pushback 
malevolence in their own hearts and in 

1504
01:25:05,401 --> 01:25:06,234
their society.

1505
01:25:06,510 --> 01:25:08,550
And I also believe that,
you know,

1506
01:25:08,551 --> 01:25:09,384
it's very difficult for people to 
respect themselves because they're weak 

1507
01:25:12,031 --> 01:25:14,670
and vulnerable and pathetic and 
malevolent.

1508
01:25:14,850 --> 01:25:16,950
And so it's no,
and they're not what they could be.

1509
01:25:16,951 --> 01:25:17,784
And they know it.
And so it's no wonder that people don't 

1510
01:25:19,141 --> 01:25:21,360
respect themselves and some of that 
nature.

1511
01:25:21,361 --> 01:25:24,000
And some of that's culture and some of 
it's individual weakness.

1512
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:25,253
But one of the things that I've learned,
and it's about the only optimistic 

1513
01:25:27,481 --> 01:25:28,314
thought I've ever come across,
is that if you have enough courage to 

1514
01:25:31,171 --> 01:25:32,004
forthrightly,
except the fact that you're vulnerable 

1515
01:25:33,991 --> 01:25:37,500
and malevolent and you're willing to do 
something about it to overcome it,

1516
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:38,513
you can develop enough respect for 
yourself so that the terrible weight of 

1517
01:25:41,101 --> 01:25:43,950
being will not make you mlevel intend 
corrupt.

1518
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:45,533
And I don't think that you have anything
better to aim for unless you want blood 

1519
01:25:47,971 --> 01:25:48,804
in the streets in a pathetic life.
And so you might as well straighten up 

1520
01:25:51,781 --> 01:25:52,614
and get your act together.
And maybe we've got some chance of 

1521
01:25:54,811 --> 01:25:55,644
getting through this intermediary period
of chaos that we all face and make 

1522
01:25:58,771 --> 01:26:01,050
something better out of it instead of 
something worse.

1523
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:04,430
So that's what have to say about that.

1524
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:05,750
So thank you.

1525
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:11,160
[inaudible]
I've talked to Peterson has agreed to do

1526
01:26:33,991 --> 01:26:35,740
with 30 minutes of question and answers 
still.

1527
01:26:35,750 --> 01:26:40,750
So,
okay.

1528
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:50,710
So why should just unplug it or shut off
the recording?

1529
01:26:52,470 --> 01:26:53,303
Okay.

1530
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,300
Oh yes,
yes.

1531
01:26:58,340 --> 01:26:59,173
Right.

1532
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:07,793
Sure.

1533
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:09,580
I'll repeat your question.

1534
01:27:13,690 --> 01:27:14,523
Okay.
So I heard that you decided not to do 

1535
01:27:16,521 --> 01:27:17,354
your,
uh,

1536
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:19,113
uh,
website thing to analyze the postmodern 

1537
01:27:21,261 --> 01:27:22,094
his forces and you said that you thought
that it would contribute more and 

1538
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:25,353
polarization.
I had lunch with a friend of mine 

1539
01:27:27,201 --> 01:27:28,034
earlier today who I hadn't seen in 70 
years on the radical left and it will 

1540
01:27:31,191 --> 01:27:32,024
probably be a victim of that kind of 
thing if you were to be successful on 

1541
01:27:34,651 --> 01:27:35,484
that are in many of them,
let's say the shut out of the 

1542
01:27:38,481 --> 01:27:39,750
university.
Um,

1543
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,900
so that seems right to me.
That's a bad way to go.

1544
01:27:41,901 --> 01:27:44,120
But what do you think of as the 
alternative?

1545
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:45,053
All right.
You've talked to a lot of people who 

1546
01:27:45,981 --> 01:27:49,520
were sort of in your intellectual orbit 
who are kind of fellow travelers.

1547
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:52,920
Do you think the answer is to talk to 
people who are further away from you and

1548
01:27:52,921 --> 01:27:54,650
have you tried to do that?
I'm sure many,

1549
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:57,040
many people made it would be your life.

1550
01:27:57,780 --> 01:27:58,920
Yeah.
You might say that.

1551
01:27:58,921 --> 01:27:59,754
Yeah.
Reluctant would be one way of putting 

1552
01:28:00,751 --> 01:28:01,770
it.
Yeah.

1553
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:03,780
Um,
so the question is,

1554
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:08,070
I had thought about making a website,
well the website was actually made,

1555
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:08,993
cause you know,
if I'm trying to decide whether to do 

1556
01:28:10,171 --> 01:28:11,610
something,
usually what I do,

1557
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:12,473
because it's really hard to figure out 
if you should do something just 

1558
01:28:13,891 --> 01:28:15,000
hypothetically.
Right.

1559
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:16,223
So one of the ways to figure out if you 
should do something is to do it almost 

1560
01:28:18,871 --> 01:28:22,470
completely and then it's there and then 
you're actually thinking about something

1561
01:28:22,471 --> 01:28:23,304
real.
And I talked to a bunch of people about 

1562
01:28:24,931 --> 01:28:25,764
it after it was built and thought that I
wasn't sure it would cause more that 

1563
01:28:30,811 --> 01:28:34,710
would do more good than harm.
So I put it on hiatus now.

1564
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:36,000
Um,
you know,

1565
01:28:36,001 --> 01:28:36,834
one of the unfortunate things that 
happened was that the University of 

1566
01:28:40,590 --> 01:28:42,660
Toronto Faculty Association accused me 
of making this website,

1567
01:28:43,050 --> 01:28:43,883
you know,
on the basis of things I'd said about 

1568
01:28:45,121 --> 01:28:47,430
three or four months ago without talking
to me about it.

1569
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:48,263
Because why would they talk to one of 
their faculty members being the Faculty 

1570
01:28:52,170 --> 01:28:53,010
Association.
Um,

1571
01:28:53,430 --> 01:28:54,780
and you know,
so I would,

1572
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:56,060
I would,
I,

1573
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:56,933
as I said,
I was wavering back and forth about 

1574
01:28:58,951 --> 01:29:03,190
whether to not to do this.
And then they came out and attacked me.

1575
01:29:03,191 --> 01:29:06,190
And the problem with that is that now if
I say I'm not going to do it,

1576
01:29:06,191 --> 01:29:08,740
it looks like they won.
And that's,

1577
01:29:08,770 --> 01:29:09,603
and first of all,
I don't see this as a win loss 

1578
01:29:10,931 --> 01:29:11,764
situation.
I don't like it to be construed that 

1579
01:29:13,331 --> 01:29:15,880
way.
But the truth of the matter is,

1580
01:29:15,881 --> 01:29:18,520
is that when the faculty association 
came out and said that,

1581
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,650
you know,
it would be wrong for me to do it,

1582
01:29:20,651 --> 01:29:22,380
my first response was,
well,

1583
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:25,120
you bastards all be doing it.
Now you can be sure of that.

1584
01:29:25,570 --> 01:29:28,090
But that's not a good,
that's not how to think,

1585
01:29:28,091 --> 01:29:28,360
right?

1586
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:30,580
That's how to react.
And so you don't do that.

1587
01:29:30,581 --> 01:29:33,430
You have your little emotional meltdown 
and then you,

1588
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:38,700
you think for like a month and you get 
people to talk to and you try to come at

1589
01:29:38,771 --> 01:29:41,350
it from a level headed perspective.
So,

1590
01:29:41,870 --> 01:29:43,060
uh,
I don't know.

1591
01:29:43,061 --> 01:29:47,050
I probably have most luck with youtube 
videos and I have a book coming out.

1592
01:29:47,390 --> 01:29:49,240
Uh,
I'm supposed to bring a flyer for all of

1593
01:29:49,241 --> 01:29:50,170
you,
but you know,

1594
01:29:50,230 --> 01:29:51,200
I forgot.
So,

1595
01:29:51,670 --> 01:29:53,770
um,
like I always do.

1596
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,390
So,
um,

1597
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:56,343
and hopefully that'll be helpful because
it's about individual responsibility 

1598
01:29:59,921 --> 01:30:00,800
fundamentally.
And,

1599
01:30:00,950 --> 01:30:04,090
and truth in particular,
which I think is,

1600
01:30:06,310 --> 01:30:07,870
what would you say?
Well,

1601
01:30:07,871 --> 01:30:08,704
if you want to adapt to reality,
which is kind of what you have to do 

1602
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:13,233
then falsifying it is probably not the 
most effective strategy as far as I can 

1603
01:30:17,351 --> 01:30:18,184
tell.
And it's certainly the case that if you 

1604
01:30:19,091 --> 01:30:19,924
allow yourself to speak bent words that 
you'll end up with a bent character and 

1605
01:30:23,651 --> 01:30:25,930
then God help you.
So,

1606
01:30:26,770 --> 01:30:27,603
you know,
I talked tonight about what I think are 

1607
01:30:28,811 --> 01:30:31,150
the words that are most dangerous,
diversity,

1608
01:30:31,151 --> 01:30:33,100
equity,
inclusivity,

1609
01:30:33,430 --> 01:30:35,980
white privilege.
So maybe you know,

1610
01:30:35,981 --> 01:30:36,814
the people who are watching the videos 
can think about how they might want to 

1611
01:30:40,541 --> 01:30:41,374
orient themselves in relationship to the
mid level bureaucrats in particular who 

1612
01:30:45,161 --> 01:30:45,994
are pushing this sort of thing forward 
with as much force as they can possibly 

1613
01:30:48,461 --> 01:30:51,630
manage.
So we'll see.

1614
01:30:52,140 --> 01:30:54,970
That's that's the plan at the moment.
Yep.

1615
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:02,610
You never know.
Hello,

1616
01:31:07,340 --> 01:31:08,230
any of the lecture

1617
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:14,470
or at least the ones who,

1618
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:21,920
I was wondering if you could talk about 
this.

1619
01:31:23,050 --> 01:31:23,883
Ideas that are not the cookie cutter one
left and the leftist students like I 

1620
01:31:29,461 --> 01:31:31,400
have today.
I'm talking about people like me,

1621
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:36,370
they board though they are some,
some of them steeped in Marxism.

1622
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:37,593
The do have validity in the sense that 
though we have this thrown this from 

1623
01:31:41,861 --> 01:31:42,694
heidegger,
there are power hierarchies and 

1624
01:31:45,161 --> 01:31:45,994
structures.
Though admittedly not all powerful that 

1625
01:31:48,341 --> 01:31:49,174
do define human interactions that do 
dominate people and that do in a sense 

1626
01:31:53,290 --> 01:31:56,500
or at least in their words,
alienate people from themselves.

1627
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:59,680
Probably the most prominent papers and 
the medium is message,

1628
01:32:00,130 --> 01:32:00,963
which is what I'm talking about,
which is the production of new 

1629
01:32:02,981 --> 01:32:03,814
technologies,
the technology itself and the content 

1630
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:07,433
producers.
We can think of newspaper articles in 

1631
01:32:09,221 --> 01:32:11,740
the newspaper,
the distribution of newspapers.

1632
01:32:11,770 --> 01:32:16,540
Is it self content as well and how that 
defines power structures within people?

1633
01:32:16,890 --> 01:32:17,723
Well,
the first thing is is that it's not 

1634
01:32:18,751 --> 01:32:19,584
particularly useful necessarily to 
conceptualize them as power structures 

1635
01:32:22,950 --> 01:32:26,220
because there are structures with 
multiple purposes and there are multiple

1636
01:32:26,221 --> 01:32:29,760
structures and so collapsing it to 
powers of very bad idea.

1637
01:32:30,330 --> 01:32:31,163
The second is that we're in a human 
beings are in a constant state of 

1638
01:32:34,771 --> 01:32:37,980
alienation from the world and from what 
they produce.

1639
01:32:37,981 --> 01:32:39,210
It's,
that's what human,

1640
01:32:39,270 --> 01:32:42,300
if you had to define human beings,
that would be the definition.

1641
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:46,530
Those creatures that are in a constant 
state of alienation from themselves,

1642
01:32:46,531 --> 01:32:49,950
culture and the world.
Now why that is exactly.

1643
01:32:49,951 --> 01:32:50,784
I don't know.
I think it has something to do with the 

1644
01:32:51,871 --> 01:32:52,704
fact that were self conscious,
but it's an existential reality rather 

1645
01:32:55,831 --> 01:32:56,664
than a,
an indication of the pathology of a 

1646
01:32:58,801 --> 01:33:01,800
given cultural construction.
You know that,

1647
01:33:01,801 --> 01:33:03,180
that's one of the reasons I really 
liked,

1648
01:33:03,210 --> 01:33:04,800
well,
Heidi groove in part,

1649
01:33:04,801 --> 01:33:07,800
but the existentialist in general,
they just throw that out in front of you

1650
01:33:07,801 --> 01:33:08,634
and say,
look,

1651
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:11,070
yes,
of course you have those problems.

1652
01:33:11,370 --> 01:33:12,203
Like that's it's always been that way.
The ancient Egyptians had a god that 

1653
01:33:15,811 --> 01:33:18,810
represented the corrupting,
their corrupt,

1654
01:33:18,930 --> 01:33:19,763
the corruption of the state,
and the corrupting influence that 

1655
01:33:21,841 --> 01:33:26,160
produced that corruption that was set 
and set is the set,

1656
01:33:26,161 --> 01:33:28,590
the word sad eventually becomes the word
Satan.

1657
01:33:28,650 --> 01:33:29,910
I mean,
we've known this,

1658
01:33:30,330 --> 01:33:31,163
the Mesopotamians knew this.
They had a god king knew who was the 

1659
01:33:33,811 --> 01:33:37,050
king of the monsters out of whose blood 
to human beings were made.

1660
01:33:37,410 --> 01:33:40,710
It's like the idea that we're alienated 
from what we create.

1661
01:33:40,711 --> 01:33:41,544
It's like,
yeah,

1662
01:33:41,550 --> 01:33:42,570
right.
Absolutely.

1663
01:33:42,571 --> 01:33:45,450
That's true.
So get up and do something about it.

1664
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:46,421
You know,
it's,

1665
01:33:46,421 --> 01:33:51,180
it's not like you're unique in your 
subjugation to the pathology of culture.

1666
01:33:51,450 --> 01:33:54,390
And it's also not the case that culture 
is only pathological.

1667
01:33:54,630 --> 01:33:57,480
That's the other thing that's so that's 
so disturbing.

1668
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,820
I mean,
you have glasses on,

1669
01:34:00,270 --> 01:34:01,290
that's a good thing.

1670
01:34:01,350 --> 01:34:03,780
You don't bump into walls,
you know,

1671
01:34:03,781 --> 01:34:06,150
and so,
and that's a cultural artifact,

1672
01:34:06,180 --> 01:34:07,013
you know,
and I'd be dead six times over if it 

1673
01:34:08,401 --> 01:34:11,100
wasn't for various medical 
interventions.

1674
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:12,810
And so,
you know,

1675
01:34:12,930 --> 01:34:13,763
leaving the fact that you're oppressed 
with a little bit of gratitude is a 

1676
01:34:16,890 --> 01:34:20,070
really wonderful thing.
And one of the things that just staggers

1677
01:34:20,071 --> 01:34:22,650
me about the,
the radical fringe that's,

1678
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:26,310
that's,
that's characterized by these ideas that

1679
01:34:26,311 --> 01:34:27,144
we discussed tonight.
They have absolutely no gratitude for 

1680
01:34:29,071 --> 01:34:31,530
anything.
And that's really something remarkable.

1681
01:34:32,070 --> 01:34:32,903
You know what it needs to say human 
being is intolerable unless he has two 

1682
01:34:36,061 --> 01:34:38,280
things.
Cleanliness and gratitude.

1683
01:34:38,580 --> 01:34:40,620
Well,
maybe they manage the first count,

1684
01:34:40,621 --> 01:34:42,960
although not always,
but they certainly do.

1685
01:34:43,830 --> 01:34:44,663
Sorry about that.
But they certainly don't manage this 

1686
01:34:49,161 --> 01:34:50,880
second.
So

1687
01:34:52,950 --> 01:34:53,783
Yup.

1688
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:58,010
You bring up article written

1689
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:58,843
in the day,
the car note papers published this 

1690
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:02,533
morning,
a letter to the editor by a farm of the 

1691
01:35:04,900 --> 01:35:07,010
student government,
the legislative affairs committee,

1692
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:10,160
um,
in which they make several clams,

1693
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:11,383
which I think you could use.
And what struck me as an attempt to 

1694
01:35:16,041 --> 01:35:16,874
slander you,
things that happened with the 

1695
01:35:19,221 --> 01:35:20,660
[inaudible] team building,
things like that.

1696
01:35:21,260 --> 01:35:23,760
But they make the assertion that you,
uh,

1697
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:24,733
essentially abuse or hide behind the 
banner or free speech in order to be 

1698
01:35:30,621 --> 01:35:35,621
safe or to allow ourselves
to not adopt the ideas thrown out.

1699
01:35:38,961 --> 01:35:43,130
But I think this could be extended to 
all types of speech in which the radical

1700
01:35:43,131 --> 01:35:43,760
lessons,

1701
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:46,700
I wouldn't say I'm hiding behind the 
banner of free speech.

1702
01:35:46,701 --> 01:35:47,534
Precisely.
So that would be the first error in 

1703
01:35:49,311 --> 01:35:50,144
that.
I don't think that you can characterize 

1704
01:35:51,531 --> 01:35:54,020
what I'm doing is hiding.
It isn't,

1705
01:35:54,110 --> 01:35:58,910
it isn't exactly,
it isn't exactly self evident that um,

1706
01:35:59,150 --> 01:36:01,490
the right to free speech has protected 
me.

1707
01:36:01,610 --> 01:36:04,070
I would say a certain amount of good 
fortune,

1708
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:05,143
a certain amount of caution with my 
words and a tremendous amount of public 

1709
01:36:07,971 --> 01:36:10,530
support is what's protected me.
Um,

1710
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:15,700
I also think that the ideological types 
who pen those pieces of nonsense have,

1711
01:36:16,421 --> 01:36:19,430
have a common,
what a constant theme is.

1712
01:36:19,550 --> 01:36:24,550
Anyone who disagrees with them is 
pathological in some manner and uses the

1713
01:36:25,431 --> 01:36:28,340
right of free speech to exercise that 
pathology.

1714
01:36:28,490 --> 01:36:29,323
Well,
you know,

1715
01:36:29,390 --> 01:36:31,160
no,
that's just,

1716
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:32,360
that's,
sorry,

1717
01:36:32,361 --> 01:36:35,150
that's not the case.
It's not the case.

1718
01:36:35,151 --> 01:36:35,984
And you know,
most of what's been leveled at me in 

1719
01:36:37,821 --> 01:36:42,821
terms of slurs are they're low 
resolution and ill informed.

1720
01:36:42,950 --> 01:36:44,240
You know,
I'm a trans fold by,

1721
01:36:44,241 --> 01:36:45,680
I'm a bigot.
What else?

1722
01:36:45,681 --> 01:36:47,660
I'm a racist.
I'm a Nazi.

1723
01:36:47,661 --> 01:36:48,494
That's a good one.
I'd been teaching about Nazi-ism for 30 

1724
01:36:51,261 --> 01:36:52,280
years,
you know,

1725
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:53,143
trying to tell people that they probably
would have been Nazi's had they been in 

1726
01:36:57,260 --> 01:36:58,093
Germany during the 1930s,
which is at actually trying to convince 

1727
01:37:00,861 --> 01:37:03,980
them of that,
which is something that you might need a

1728
01:37:03,981 --> 01:37:06,500
trigger warning for before you entered 
the class.

1729
01:37:07,220 --> 01:37:08,031
You know,
so it's,

1730
01:37:08,031 --> 01:37:09,920
it's,
it's palpably absurd,

1731
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:14,900
but it doesn't matter because if the war
of ideas is about power,

1732
01:37:14,901 --> 01:37:18,500
it doesn't matter whether you represent 
either side with any degree of accuracy,

1733
01:37:18,501 --> 01:37:20,630
it's just part of the hobbsy in 
nightmare.

1734
01:37:20,631 --> 01:37:24,770
And you know,
whoever spins the best story wins.

1735
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:27,590
So yeah.
Anyways,

1736
01:37:27,591 --> 01:37:28,424
I've been weirdly fortunate because 
every time the radicals have come after 

1737
01:37:32,961 --> 01:37:36,140
me and they really came after me last 
October,

1738
01:37:36,630 --> 01:37:39,800
um,
it's reversed every single time.

1739
01:37:40,430 --> 01:37:41,263
So,
and I'm not counting on that to 

1740
01:37:42,771 --> 01:37:47,000
continue,
but it's been rather blackley comical as

1741
01:37:47,001 --> 01:37:51,410
it's been occurring.
So these articles,

1742
01:37:51,411 --> 01:37:53,180
it's like,
as far as I'm concerned,

1743
01:37:53,830 --> 01:37:56,460
they're a dime a dozen.
I don't even have to read them anymore.

1744
01:37:56,850 --> 01:37:58,320
That's the thing about reading 
something,

1745
01:37:58,321 --> 01:37:59,154
an ideolog rights.
You just have to look at the first 

1746
01:38:01,261 --> 01:38:04,770
sentence and infer the rest.
You know it's true,

1747
01:38:04,771 --> 01:38:05,590
man.
It's actually,

1748
01:38:05,590 --> 01:38:06,423
this is one of the things that 
Solzhenitsyn did a brilliant job of 

1749
01:38:08,551 --> 01:38:10,740
analyzing in the Gulag archipelago.
He said,

1750
01:38:11,190 --> 01:38:14,980
that's the consequence of turning your 
God given sole over to human dogma.

1751
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:18,450
You're just a puppet for these ideas 
that are operating behind the scenes.

1752
01:38:18,570 --> 01:38:22,110
You think you have the ideas.
It's like think again.

1753
01:38:22,860 --> 01:38:23,693
They have you and they're doing with you
what the idea is want to have done with 

1754
01:38:27,481 --> 01:38:29,130
you.
And when they're done with you,

1755
01:38:29,131 --> 01:38:30,120
they'll discard you.

1756
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:30,953
You can be sure,
and you'll be lucky if there's anything 

1757
01:38:32,761 --> 01:38:35,370
left of you when that happens.
So,

1758
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:38,220
and the universities are absolutely 
complicit in this.

1759
01:38:38,221 --> 01:38:41,250
They take young people whose minds are,
are,

1760
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:43,890
who are looking for an identity and no 
wonder,

1761
01:38:44,310 --> 01:38:45,143
and they teach them this algorithmic 
idiocy that anyone with any brain could 

1762
01:38:48,241 --> 01:38:53,190
learn in a week that that dictums and 
dogma of the oppression versus,

1763
01:38:53,191 --> 01:38:54,360
oh,
pressed narrative,

1764
01:38:54,630 --> 01:38:56,310
God,
it's unbelievable.

1765
01:38:56,550 --> 01:38:57,383
You know,
a decent chat Bot could write most of 

1766
01:38:59,251 --> 01:39:01,590
the postmodern papers.
That's why,

1767
01:39:02,010 --> 01:39:04,680
that's why they,
that's why the typical humanities,

1768
01:39:04,681 --> 01:39:08,970
80% of humanities papers now garner zero
citations,

1769
01:39:09,090 --> 01:39:09,923
which means the only person who ever 
reads them as the person who wrote them 

1770
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:15,600
and even they don't do a very good job 
of reading them.

1771
01:39:16,290 --> 01:39:17,123
So

1772
01:39:17,930 --> 01:39:21,490
yeah.
Well,

1773
01:39:21,491 --> 01:39:25,210
for starters now I feel terrible for 
writing that article.

1774
01:39:25,340 --> 01:39:30,340
[inaudible]

1775
01:39:36,530 --> 01:39:37,363
no written with others and I would have 
hoped it would have come across as more 

1776
01:39:39,491 --> 01:39:40,690
of a thoughtful critique.

1777
01:39:43,150 --> 01:39:44,650
Are you,
are you actually serious?

1778
01:39:48,870 --> 01:39:49,681
Well,
I'm sorry,

1779
01:39:49,681 --> 01:39:50,514
I was a little hard on you.
I would say I'm more hard on your 

1780
01:39:54,651 --> 01:39:56,180
professors,
so

1781
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:58,750
it's fun in a glutton for punishment,
but anyway,

1782
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:01,400
it's very brave of you to be standing 
there by way

1783
01:40:06,030 --> 01:40:10,110
more about identity.
Really what you see then in the sense of

1784
01:40:10,111 --> 01:40:12,930
thrown this is it's a consequence of 
human nature.

1785
01:40:12,931 --> 01:40:13,764
Human nature creates higher fees and 
higher who's exclude or groups exclude 

1786
01:40:17,790 --> 01:40:18,623
necessary to sort.
But what we see with a lot of the 

1787
01:40:20,811 --> 01:40:25,260
sorting is that it's arbitrary and that 
it's not the arbitrariness of nature,

1788
01:40:25,261 --> 01:40:29,370
but rather the arbitrary of structures 
of society.

1789
01:40:29,460 --> 01:40:30,293
Like maybe nature lends itself to the 
creation of arbitrary structures within 

1790
01:40:35,101 --> 01:40:37,850
society.
I think that's fair.

1791
01:40:38,190 --> 01:40:39,023
Then people self identify with these 
categories and these categories maybe 

1792
01:40:42,630 --> 01:40:43,463
outdated or based on old understanding.
These are ultimately lead to greater 

1793
01:40:49,831 --> 01:40:54,100
estrangement.
So the question is how do people

1794
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:58,580
reckon with the parts of their identity 
that may or may not contribute

1795
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:01,670
to environments where people feel more 
estranged,

1796
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:02,513
more alone.
That's why you get educated is to 

1797
01:41:05,011 --> 01:41:07,680
separate the wheat from the chaff.
You know,

1798
01:41:07,681 --> 01:41:09,810
because you're a historical creature,
right?

1799
01:41:09,870 --> 01:41:10,703
I mean,
it's outside of you and inside of you 

1800
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:14,910
and some of it's dead and corrupt,
as you just said,

1801
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:17,430
and his strangers for no reason,
no,

1802
01:41:17,431 --> 01:41:19,500
no functional reason counter 
productively,

1803
01:41:19,980 --> 01:41:22,950
but until you can,
until you understand the structures,

1804
01:41:23,310 --> 01:41:24,143
for better or for worse,
you're in no position to to do anything 

1805
01:41:27,571 --> 01:41:28,404
but make them more fundamentally.
The purpose of a liberal education is 

1806
01:41:31,830 --> 01:41:36,830
not to turn you into an Avatar of 
capitalism or or,

1807
01:41:36,841 --> 01:41:41,280
or of or of democracy for that matter.
The purpose of a liberal education is to

1808
01:41:41,281 --> 01:41:45,720
enable you to comprehend the history in 
which you're embedded and then to act as

1809
01:41:45,721 --> 01:41:46,554
an agent to,
to reconstruct and revitalize that 

1810
01:41:49,561 --> 01:41:50,394
hierarchy.
But that's a serious matter like at 18 

1811
01:41:53,850 --> 01:41:54,683
say,
and right out of high school with no 

1812
01:41:57,631 --> 01:42:00,060
experience whatsoever in life and no 
real education.

1813
01:42:00,260 --> 01:42:01,093
You're in absolutely no position 
whatsoever to be protesting about the 

1814
01:42:04,141 --> 01:42:06,660
structure of the Western world.
It's like,

1815
01:42:07,350 --> 01:42:09,150
no,
sorry.

1816
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:11,033
You know your,
your observations about the fact that 

1817
01:42:12,931 --> 01:42:15,990
people are alienated by structures like 
absolutely.

1818
01:42:16,170 --> 01:42:19,110
Of course.
And it does sort and it sorts harshly.

1819
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:20,730
And of course,
because you're young,

1820
01:42:20,731 --> 01:42:21,564
you tend to be sorted near the bottom.
Except that I would point out that 

1821
01:42:24,181 --> 01:42:26,550
you're young and there's really 
something to that.

1822
01:42:26,940 --> 01:42:27,773
You know,
and you might think that you have no 

1823
01:42:28,381 --> 01:42:30,270
power because of that.
But I could say,

1824
01:42:30,271 --> 01:42:31,104
well,
you have all the power that youth gives 

1825
01:42:32,281 --> 01:42:37,281
you and that's not trivial.
So where power doesn't lie,

1826
01:42:37,591 --> 01:42:39,150
where it's obvious,
you know,

1827
01:42:39,180 --> 01:42:40,013
it really doesn't.
And people have more power than they 

1828
01:42:42,001 --> 01:42:43,500
think,
but they squander it.

1829
01:42:44,070 --> 01:42:47,910
And he often squandered on ideology when
they're not just wasting their time.

1830
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:49,353
So

1831
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:52,650
anyways,
it was very brave of you to stand up and

1832
01:42:52,651 --> 01:42:55,380
ask me a question and to take all of 
that criticism.

1833
01:42:55,600 --> 01:43:00,600
[inaudible]

1834
01:43:05,870 --> 01:43:06,703
none or religious,
the phrase the carefully positioned in 

1835
01:43:12,061 --> 01:43:15,400
the diagnostic atheism,
there is no literal gun in the objective

1836
01:43:15,401 --> 01:43:16,234
universe or at least no gut humans would
be interested in is intellectually hard 

1837
01:43:19,631 --> 01:43:20,464
of a sale.
Still there's good evidence for 

1838
01:43:22,091 --> 01:43:22,924
religious behavior,
has an advantage produced by natural 

1839
01:43:24,671 --> 01:43:28,360
selection.
Do you think that self critically acting

1840
01:43:28,630 --> 01:43:29,463
in a way as if God exists is efficient 
to leverage evolutionary wisdom or it 

1841
01:43:34,090 --> 01:43:35,560
must have religions,
articles of faith,

1842
01:43:35,830 --> 01:43:36,663
people,
Lehman defendant in the same manner as 

1843
01:43:38,051 --> 01:43:38,884
literal facts?

1844
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:45,280
That's a good question.
One of the things that I read when I was

1845
01:43:46,371 --> 01:43:47,480
reading Karl,
Yo,

1846
01:43:47,570 --> 01:43:48,403
he made this claim,
which I really liked was that whatever 

1847
01:43:50,430 --> 01:43:53,960
sits atop of your pinnacle of value is 
functionally equivalent to God.

1848
01:43:55,010 --> 01:43:56,810
That's good.
That's really smart.

1849
01:43:56,950 --> 01:43:59,240
Um,
and I like it smarter than it sounds,

1850
01:43:59,241 --> 01:44:00,074
which is the case with most of the 
things that you wrote because it 

1851
01:44:02,091 --> 01:44:02,924
actually does turn out that our category
systems are not so much about 

1852
01:44:06,441 --> 01:44:10,280
subdividing the material world into it's
appropriate entities,

1853
01:44:10,281 --> 01:44:11,114
but about carving up our experience into
categories of tools and obstacles so 

1854
01:44:15,231 --> 01:44:19,880
that we can attain certain valued goals.
And so we're always directing our action

1855
01:44:19,881 --> 01:44:20,714
towards the attainment of a goal.
And so that means we're immersed in a 

1856
01:44:23,031 --> 01:44:23,864
value structure.
And so young's point was whatever sits 

1857
01:44:26,301 --> 01:44:30,470
at the pinnacle of your value structure 
serves the function of God.

1858
01:44:30,770 --> 01:44:32,870
Now you might have a fragmented value 
structure,

1859
01:44:32,871 --> 01:44:36,110
which means in some sense that you're 
psychologically polytheistic.

1860
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:40,040
And the problem with that is that then 
you're a house divided amongst itself.

1861
01:44:40,130 --> 01:44:42,380
You're pulling in multiple directions 
simultaneously.

1862
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:44,300
Impulsive people are like that,
right?

1863
01:44:44,690 --> 01:44:45,523
And they don't understand themselves 
because one day they go left and the 

1864
01:44:48,020 --> 01:44:49,340
other day they go right.
And you know,

1865
01:44:49,341 --> 01:44:50,174
they,
they have no control over themselves at 

1866
01:44:50,991 --> 01:44:53,360
all.
Now you said,

1867
01:44:53,361 --> 01:44:55,070
well,
there's no objective God,

1868
01:44:55,310 --> 01:44:58,430
and that seems to be a reasonable 
hypothesis.

1869
01:44:58,790 --> 01:44:59,623
Um,
the question then I suppose becomes to 

1870
01:45:01,371 --> 01:45:03,770
what degree our subjective experience is
real.

1871
01:45:03,771 --> 01:45:06,110
And that's a matter of definition.
Um,

1872
01:45:06,860 --> 01:45:07,693
I think the religious impulse is an 
inevitable consequence of the fact that 

1873
01:45:11,121 --> 01:45:11,954
it's necessary for people to live inside
hierarchies of value and that we feel a 

1874
01:45:15,711 --> 01:45:20,510
sense of awe.
The sense of all we feel with regards to

1875
01:45:20,511 --> 01:45:21,344
the highest values is no not 
distinguishable from the existence of 

1876
01:45:24,861 --> 01:45:27,170
the value itself now.

1877
01:45:27,170 --> 01:45:31,190
And there's real advantages to the idea 
of a detached God in some sense.

1878
01:45:31,191 --> 01:45:35,390
And one of the things I've learned about
archaic concepts of sovereignty is that,

1879
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:36,753
um,
detaching the idea of ethical of ethics 

1880
01:45:40,161 --> 01:45:40,994
itself and ethical power from the holder
of power is an extraordinarily useful 

1881
01:45:45,351 --> 01:45:49,130
thing to do because otherwise the cane 
becomes the embodiment of the God.

1882
01:45:49,370 --> 01:45:52,430
And then the king can do no wrong.
Then you have a tyrant.

1883
01:45:52,760 --> 01:45:53,593
If the idea of power and sovereignty is 
detached from the individual and set up 

1884
01:45:59,331 --> 01:46:01,910
as a higher virtue that even the 
sovereign is,

1885
01:46:02,030 --> 01:46:04,250
is uh,
responsible to them.

1886
01:46:04,251 --> 01:46:06,350
The sovereign,
at least in principle,

1887
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:09,950
can never put,
put himself forward as absolute.

1888
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:11,173
And you can think about that just as a 
development of humans' capacity to 

1889
01:46:13,341 --> 01:46:14,390
abstract,
right?

1890
01:46:14,540 --> 01:46:15,373
We can abstract the idea of sovereignty,
we can abstract the idea of ethics and 

1891
01:46:18,171 --> 01:46:19,004
virtue.

1892
01:46:19,010 --> 01:46:22,100
We can,
we can hypothesize that as an ideal,

1893
01:46:22,190 --> 01:46:23,023
we can embody it as a personality,
which is actually quite useful because 

1894
01:46:25,641 --> 01:46:28,220
it's something we have to act out.
Now you might say,

1895
01:46:28,221 --> 01:46:30,890
well,
what relationship does that have to,

1896
01:46:31,520 --> 01:46:33,510
you know,
to the existence of,

1897
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:38,210
of something transcendent in the 
religious sense outside of that abstract

1898
01:46:38,211 --> 01:46:39,044
conceptualization.
And the answer to that is we don't know 

1899
01:46:41,930 --> 01:46:42,763
if you,
if you familiarize yourself with the 

1900
01:46:45,471 --> 01:46:49,160
writings of people who've had profound 
religious experiences,

1901
01:46:49,410 --> 01:46:50,243
it's chronically the case that they 
described encountering something that 

1902
01:46:53,221 --> 01:46:54,054
transcends and that they describe it as 
more real than anything they've ever 

1903
01:46:57,571 --> 01:46:58,890
encountered.
Now,

1904
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:02,850
whether or not that constitutes proof,
depends on how you define proof.

1905
01:47:03,210 --> 01:47:05,970
So I'm not making a case for it one way 
or another,

1906
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,480
but I mean young himself,
I mean when he talked about God,

1907
01:47:09,481 --> 01:47:11,730
when he was being careful,
he didn't talk about God.

1908
01:47:11,731 --> 01:47:12,564
He talked about the God image in man and
he was careful never to formally state 

1909
01:47:18,541 --> 01:47:21,840
that the fact that there's an image of 
the ideal in the soul,

1910
01:47:21,841 --> 01:47:22,674
let's say an archetype that that 
provided concrete proof that such an 

1911
01:47:26,791 --> 01:47:28,620
ideal existed,
you know,

1912
01:47:28,621 --> 01:47:29,454
in some transcendent manner.
But the world's a weird place and it's 

1913
01:47:32,101 --> 01:47:36,480
not something I would rule out.
So it's not like we understand the world

1914
01:47:36,481 --> 01:47:38,840
very well.
And materialists,

1915
01:47:38,850 --> 01:47:39,750
you know,
they try to,

1916
01:47:40,570 --> 01:47:40,920
yeah,

1917
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:41,753
they tried to encapsulate the entire 
world within the materialist philosophy 

1918
01:47:45,121 --> 01:47:45,954
and like more power to them.
It's been an unbelievably successful 

1919
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:50,333
tool,
but we haven't cracked consciousness in 

1920
01:47:53,101 --> 01:47:53,934
the least.
And there is something about 

1921
01:47:55,441 --> 01:47:56,274
consciousness that's world creating and 
there's something transcendent about 

1922
01:47:59,611 --> 01:48:03,270
consciousness and it also seems capable 
of a kind of infinite expansion.

1923
01:48:03,750 --> 01:48:06,270
And it isn't obvious why any of that is 
the case.

1924
01:48:06,330 --> 01:48:08,610
Not obvious at all.
So,

1925
01:48:10,290 --> 01:48:11,123
okay.
Yup.

1926
01:48:13,270 --> 01:48:15,760
Hello?
Okay.

1927
01:48:16,300 --> 01:48:17,630
Okay.
So,

1928
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:24,160
um,
okay.

1929
01:48:28,690 --> 01:48:29,523
Okay.
Before they were writing this stuff up 

1930
01:48:32,220 --> 01:48:33,053
for World War II was a critical theorist
criticizing Marxism itself and the 

1931
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:44,350
student
radicals in

1932
01:48:47,340 --> 01:48:50,080
Harvard,
mark up on the deck.

1933
01:48:50,830 --> 01:48:55,760
So those ideas seem to get bryce 
section,

1934
01:48:59,530 --> 01:49:02,950
you don't really see eye to eye with how
smarter

1935
01:49:05,730 --> 01:49:09,310
objective realities.
So I mean what do you make of that?

1936
01:49:09,311 --> 01:49:10,144
People can,
we have tactic reality but the truth is 

1937
01:49:14,540 --> 01:49:15,373
health and like they need like rebel 
against the majority to express their 

1938
01:49:20,311 --> 01:49:21,144
own throat.

1939
01:49:21,870 --> 01:49:22,381
Well,
okay,

1940
01:49:22,381 --> 01:49:24,840
so two things.
I mean there's been a number of attempts

1941
01:49:24,841 --> 01:49:26,730
to revise Marx's theory,
right?

1942
01:49:26,731 --> 01:49:27,564
And so you pointed to one that's the 
cultural theorists and that was after 

1943
01:49:30,511 --> 01:49:31,344
World War II when it became painfully 
obvious at least to the first round of 

1944
01:49:35,521 --> 01:49:36,354
people who were oriented towards the 
radical left but opened the rise that 

1945
01:49:39,811 --> 01:49:42,390
there was something rotten in the state 
of the Soviet Union.

1946
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:43,793
And so they did a,
they did their best to revamped the 

1947
01:49:47,891 --> 01:49:51,280
central doctrines of Marxism using 
[inaudible] and theory and so forth.

1948
01:49:51,430 --> 01:49:52,270
And yeah,
as you said,

1949
01:49:52,271 --> 01:49:53,104
they were very influential among the 
student radicals of the 60s and it was 

1950
01:49:56,111 --> 01:49:58,930
them that gave birth to the modern crop 
of say,

1951
01:49:58,931 --> 01:50:01,630
postmodern Neo Marxists.
I think that,

1952
01:50:02,170 --> 01:50:03,003
you know,
I couldn't cover all of that obviously 

1953
01:50:04,211 --> 01:50:05,740
in one lecture,
but your,

1954
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:08,110
your point is well taken.
Um,

1955
01:50:09,370 --> 01:50:10,203
now you had,
you ended that with a different 

1956
01:50:10,961 --> 01:50:12,850
question.
So,

1957
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:16,000
but I don't remember exactly what that 
question was.

1958
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,840
Oh,
there's just,

1959
01:50:18,330 --> 01:50:20,420
people will track the benefit.

1960
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:23,530
Oh yes.
Well look,

1961
01:50:23,531 --> 01:50:24,364
I mean look,
the ultimate minority is the individual 

1962
01:50:28,690 --> 01:50:32,920
and the individual always stands in 
opposition with his or her truth to that

1963
01:50:32,921 --> 01:50:33,754
of the mob.
So that's true is that it's very 

1964
01:50:36,611 --> 01:50:37,444
frequently the case that truth is held 
by something outside the general 

1965
01:50:41,261 --> 01:50:44,050
consensus.
Now false hood is too,

1966
01:50:44,280 --> 01:50:45,400
right?
So I mean if you,

1967
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:48,070
if you have a structure that's 
reasonably functional,

1968
01:50:48,190 --> 01:50:49,840
new,
like a little walled city,

1969
01:50:49,841 --> 01:50:53,380
and you've got a hundred people outside 
yelling about how pathological it is,

1970
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:54,393
99 of them would make it worse.
And one of them has something useful to 

1971
01:50:58,091 --> 01:50:58,924
say.
And so you can't just dispense with the 

1972
01:51:00,701 --> 01:51:02,320
minority,
so to speak,

1973
01:51:02,350 --> 01:51:03,183
because the majority of the minority is 
going to be wrong in their opposition 

1974
01:51:07,060 --> 01:51:11,950
because the one person in the minority 
who isn't wrong is absolutely vital.

1975
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:13,473
And that's the tension.
That's always the tension between the 

1976
01:51:15,581 --> 01:51:15,910
group.

1977
01:51:15,910 --> 01:51:19,420
That's partly the mythological hero 
really has two roles.

1978
01:51:19,421 --> 01:51:20,254
One is to go out and conquer the dragon 
of darkness and to gather information 

1979
01:51:23,831 --> 01:51:26,080
and to disseminate it.
But the second rule,

1980
01:51:26,081 --> 01:51:26,914
which is equally important,
is to stand up against the corrupt 

1981
01:51:29,561 --> 01:51:31,240
culture,
which is what horace does.

1982
01:51:31,241 --> 01:51:33,340
For example,
in the ancient Egyptian stories,

1983
01:51:33,880 --> 01:51:34,713
demolish what's,
what's corrupt and then rebuild 

1984
01:51:37,061 --> 01:51:38,980
something and it's in,
it's in.

1985
01:51:38,981 --> 01:51:39,814
It's uh,
what in the aftermath you do that 

1986
01:51:41,711 --> 01:51:43,030
psychologically too.
You know,

1987
01:51:43,031 --> 01:51:43,864
because you have an interpretive 
structure through which you view the 

1988
01:51:46,781 --> 01:51:47,614
world and now,
and then you run into something that's 

1989
01:51:50,170 --> 01:51:54,220
like a minority,
a fact that doesn't fit and but it's,

1990
01:51:54,250 --> 01:51:55,083
but it's actually a fact that it 
indicates that part of you needs to die 

1991
01:51:58,211 --> 01:51:59,044
and
encounter chaos and reconstitute 

1992
01:52:02,231 --> 01:52:03,064
yourself.
And that's why there is this dynamism 

1993
01:52:04,871 --> 01:52:05,704
between the group and the individual and
also why the individual is held in the 

1994
01:52:10,181 --> 01:52:11,014
west to be a power,
let's say that superordinate to the 

1995
01:52:14,201 --> 01:52:15,034
state.
The state has to recognize the validity 

1996
01:52:17,081 --> 01:52:19,210
of the individual because the individual
does,

1997
01:52:19,270 --> 01:52:22,090
in the final analysis,
hold the redemptive truth.

1998
01:52:22,690 --> 01:52:25,930
But to put that in minority groups,
that's a whole different issue.

1999
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:28,570
That's a slight of hand as far as I'm 
concerned,

2000
01:52:29,140 --> 01:52:31,400
so.
All right.

2001
01:52:31,770 --> 01:52:32,201
All right.
Well,

2002
01:52:32,201 --> 01:52:32,840
thank you.

2003
01:52:32,840 --> 01:52:37,840
[inaudible].
