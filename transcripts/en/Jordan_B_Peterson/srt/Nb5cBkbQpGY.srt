1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
Okay,

2
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,550
so one of the propositions that I set 
forth for you last week was that the 

3
00:00:21,131 --> 00:00:26,131
most real things are the things that are
most permanent across time and that 

4
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:33,030
manifest themselves in the largest 
number of situations and those are the 

5
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,770
things that you have to map successfully
in order to survive,

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,810
survive as individuals but survive as a 
species over a very long period of time.

7
00:00:40,811 --> 00:00:45,811
And so the question is,
one question is what are the constants 

8
00:00:47,261 --> 00:00:52,261
of experience if you are a follower of 
the evolutionary psychologists and to 

9
00:00:55,391 --> 00:01:00,391
some degree the evolutionary biologist,
but I would say more the psychologists 

10
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:06,450
like to be and caused me these.
They have a very afro centric view of 

11
00:01:09,191 --> 00:01:12,280
human evolution.
And the idea basically is that

12
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:19,130
after we diverged from the common 
ancestor between chimpanzees,

13
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,050
Bonobos,
and human beings,

14
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,540
we spent a tremendous amount of time in 
the African environment,

15
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,900
mostly on the velt.
Although we're not absolutely certain 

16
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,111
about that.
We're also very good in water human 

17
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:36,830
beings and we have some of the features 
of aquatic mammals.

18
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,760
So,
um,

19
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:44,110
while hairlessness being one of them,
women have a subcutaneous layer of fat 

20
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:46,520
or theater quite nicely adapted for 
swimming.

21
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:52,010
And so buckminster fuller,
who I wouldn't call it mainstream 

22
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,090
evolutionary psychologist,
hypothesized back in the seventies that 

23
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,631
we spent some period of time in our 
evolutionary history living on beaches 

24
00:01:58,631 --> 00:02:02,920
near the ocean.
And that idea really a echoes for me 

25
00:02:03,111 --> 00:02:07,850
because we like beaches a lot and it's a
great place if you want to get easy food

26
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,470
and we're pretty damn good at swimming 
for,

27
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:15,540
for terrestrial mammals,
and we are hairless and we do cry salt 

28
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,910
tears and there's a lot of evidence that
we end our feet.

29
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,620
If you think about our feet,
they're quite slipper.

30
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:21,500
Like I know we have stand up and all 
that and walk.

31
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:24,560
So that's part of the adaptation,
but we're pretty good at swimming.

32
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:30,220
So anyways,
the classical evolutionary psychology 

33
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,751
view is that we spent most of our time 
on the African Veldt in the critical 

34
00:02:34,751 --> 00:02:36,290
period of our evolutionary development,
let's say,

35
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:41,291
after we diverged from this common 
ancestor and that were adapted for that 

36
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:45,971
environment.
And one of the consequences of that is 

37
00:02:45,971 --> 00:02:49,421
the idea that we're,
that things have changed so much around 

38
00:02:49,421 --> 00:02:51,620
us that we're really not adapted to the 
environment that we're in anymore.

39
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,920
And I don't really believe that because 
I think that the idea that the primary 

40
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,811
forces that shaped our evolution shape 
them during that period of time call it 

41
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:05,950
us roughly a 7 million period,
year period of time,

42
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:06,700
something like that.

43
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:13,710
And that that was somehow a special time
for human evolution that's set our 

44
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,300
nature.
I don't believe that,

45
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,110
um,
I mean it's true to some degree,

46
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:25,111
but it's more useful to view the 
evolution of human cognitive processes 

47
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:30,541
over the entire span of evolutionary 
history and not necessarily give 

48
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:34,170
preference to any particular epoch.
And I certainly believe that the idea 

49
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:39,241
that we're no longer adapted to the 
environment because of our rapid 

50
00:03:39,241 --> 00:03:39,730
technological transformations,
it's simply not true.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And the reason I think that it's not 
true is because the fundamental 

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,790
constants of the environment,
let's say,

53
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:50,791
or it's more of the fundamental 
constitute constituent elements of 

54
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:54,211
being.
I think that's the right way to think 

55
00:03:54,211 --> 00:03:54,211
about it.
They're the same.

56
00:03:54,211 --> 00:03:57,660
They haven't changed a bit and there is 
no way of changing them as far as I can 

57
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,801
tell without us being radically and 
incomprehensibly different than we are 

58
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:06,580
and you know with with the rapid rise of
artificial intelligence and robotics and

59
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:11,581
all of that,
it's certainly possible that in 500 

60
00:04:11,581 --> 00:04:14,050
years will be completely will be so like
unlike the way we are now,

61
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:15,790
that we won't even be the same 
creatures.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,890
I don't think that's a particularly 
great outcome,

63
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,920
but it's certainly possible.
So what are the fundamental constituent 

64
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,780
elements?
While they're expressed in mythology,

65
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:28,120
but they're.
They're not merely symbolic.

66
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:29,800
I think it's the wrong way to think 
about it.

67
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,100
There are symbolic,
but they reflect a very deep reality and

68
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:37,840
they actually reflect the reality that's
not easily apprehensible directly by the

69
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:42,841
census.
Now your senses are tuned for a 

70
00:04:42,841 --> 00:04:44,290
particular duration.
That's roughly,

71
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:49,530
excuse me,
that's roughly the duration that you 

72
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:51,610
live,
let's say,

73
00:04:51,611 --> 00:04:53,680
but more importantly,
it's the duration.

74
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,980
Whatever that duration is across which 
meaningful actions take place and we 

75
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,460
kind of have some idea of what that 
duration is.

76
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:01,520
You know,
if you look at us,

77
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,100
a computer screen,
if it has a refresh rate of less than 60

78
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:07,420
hertz,
you can see it flickering,

79
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,610
but above 60 hertz you can't,
it's uniform.

80
00:05:09,611 --> 00:05:12,200
And with movies,
um,

81
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,530
anywhere between 20 and 50 frames a 
second,

82
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:17,020
is it enough to give you the illusion of
continual motion?

83
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,730
So,
you know,

84
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:23,790
we live in a universe that's above the 
10th of a second domain or maybe the 

85
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,540
hundredth of a second somewhere in there
anyways.

86
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:30,541
And I mean it's not like time isn't 
almost infinitely sub dividable at 

87
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:34,951
higher levels of resolution than that,
but we don't operate generally speaking 

88
00:05:34,951 --> 00:05:38,410
at higher temporal resolution than that.
And then,

89
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,280
you know,
we're,

90
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,170
we're our,
our,

91
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:44,560
our feeling of the,
of the felt moment seems to be,

92
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,860
I would say something approximating half
a second to a second,

93
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,350
you know,
I mean it's an estimate obviously,

94
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:55,351
but a second is a meaningful unit of 
time for a person and 100th of a second 

95
00:05:55,351 --> 00:05:58,230
really isn't in certainly a billionth of
a second isn't then you know,

96
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,790
we can think across hours and days and 
weeks and months,

97
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:04,490
but we really can't.
Once you start getting out into years,

98
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:09,491
it gets kind of sketchy and it's hard to
think more than five years down the 

99
00:06:09,491 --> 00:06:09,491
road.

100
00:06:09,491 --> 00:06:13,210
And the reason for that is that the 
particular is upon which you're basing 

101
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:16,250
your predictions are likely to change 
sufficiently over a five year period.

102
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:21,251
So that extending out your vision past 
that just exposes you to accelerating 

103
00:06:21,251 --> 00:06:21,980
error.
Right?

104
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,740
And that of course that's the problem 
with predicting the future period.

105
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:28,670
So we live in a time range that's about 
say a 10th of a second,

106
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:29,140
two,
three,

107
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,890
three years,
something like that.

108
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,980
Now I know it can expand beyond that,
but that's,

109
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,360
that's kinda where we're set in.
Our senses seemed to be tuned to those 

110
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,311
durations and,
and to be operative so that we make 

111
00:06:42,311 --> 00:06:43,740
proper decisions within those durations 
and,

112
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:48,810
and also from,
from a particular spatial positioning 

113
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:48,810
and so forth.
You know,

114
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:53,050
how your eyes see what's roughly,
maybe we could say a walkable distance 

115
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:55,910
in front of you,
something like that.

116
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:01,210
So,
and you didn't detect things and in the 

117
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,020
locale that enables you to immediately 
interact with things,

118
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:08,470
but it isn't necessarily the case that 
senses that are tuned to do that are 

119
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:13,001
also tuned to inform you directly about 
what the most permanent things about 

120
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,270
being itself are.

121
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,540
I think that those things have to be in 
third and there's some,

122
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,470
there's some supporting evidence for 
that kind of thing from a,

123
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,230
from psycho linguistics.
Um,

124
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,660
there,
there is a level of,

125
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,800
of categorization that we seem to 
manifest more or less automatically or 

126
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:32,930
implicitly.
So for example,

127
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,160
when children perceive animals,
they,

128
00:07:36,161 --> 00:07:41,161
they,
they perceive at the level of cat or 

129
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:41,161
dog.
They don't,

130
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:44,780
they don't perceive that the level of 
subspecies like cat or,

131
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:45,770
or,
uh,

132
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,000
or,
or uh,

133
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,710
let's say salmonoid,
you know,

134
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,910
there's,
there's this,

135
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:55,060
there's a natural,
I can't remember what they call that 

136
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,060
base category,
something like that.

137
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,810
It's usually specified by very short 
words that are easily learnable.

138
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,840
And so the linguistic system seems to 
map right onto the,

139
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:05,200
to the object recognition 
characteristics of the sensory systems 

140
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,970
that are built right into it.
And,

141
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:12,140
and if they weren't built into it,
we couldn't communicate easily because 

142
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,140
our natural categories,
I think that's it,

143
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,800
but it's probably wrong.

144
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,820
Our natural categories,
they have to be the same for everyone or

145
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:18,650
it would be very difficult for us to 
communicate.

146
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,200
Okay.
So having said all that,

147
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,210
then the question is,
well,

148
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:27,560
what are the most,
what are the most real categories?

149
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,610
And I think there's,
there's a real division in ways to think

150
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:34,190
about this because there's a scientific 
way of thinking about it.

151
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,800
And,
and in that case,

152
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:41,801
the most real categories are,
well mathematical equations certainly 

153
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:45,791
seem to be in the top category there,
the equations that describe the physical

154
00:08:45,831 --> 00:08:48,020
universe,
but then then the,

155
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:53,070
the hypothesis of the existence of such 
things as protons and electrons and you 

156
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:54,750
know,
the,

157
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,760
the,
the material elements that make up 

158
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,361
everything,
that's every element of being with the 

159
00:09:02,361 --> 00:09:03,590
possible exception of empty space,
um,

160
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,160
but in the,
in the mythological world to categories 

161
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,370
I think are more derived from Darwinian 
by the effect of Darwinian processes on 

162
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:16,500
cognitive and perceptual function.

163
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:22,140
So which is to say that we have learned 
to perceive and then to infer those 

164
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,470
things that are most necessary for us in
order to continue our existence,

165
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,930
propagate live well.
All of those things.

166
00:09:27,931 --> 00:09:30,780
And that would be true at the level of 
individual survival.

167
00:09:30,781 --> 00:09:32,820
And maybe it's also true at the level of
group survival.

168
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:37,821
Although you know the,
there's a tremendous debate among 

169
00:09:37,821 --> 00:09:41,001
evolutionary biologists about whether 
not selection can take place at the 

170
00:09:41,001 --> 00:09:44,601
level of the group anyways.
There are these basic level categories 

171
00:09:44,881 --> 00:09:49,881
that manifest themselves to you.
And then there's categories of the 

172
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,540
imagination that you have to infer up 
from the sensory domain,

173
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:56,541
and we do that partly in science by 
comparing our sensory representations 

174
00:09:56,851 --> 00:10:01,851
across people.
But we also do it by thinking 

175
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:01,851
abstractly,
conceptualizing abstractly,

176
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:07,010
and no.
One of the things that's interesting 

177
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,321
about abstractions,
it's not clear whether they're more or 

178
00:10:09,321 --> 00:10:09,450
less real than the things they're 
obstructed from,

179
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,630
you know,
this is a perennial debate among,

180
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:16,590
let's call them ontologists,
who were interested in the fundamental,

181
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,690
fundamental nature of reality itself.

182
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,840
In some sense,
independent of conceptual structures.

183
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,840
Our numbers more or less real than the 
things they represent.

184
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,560
It's a really hard question to answer 
because knowing like using numbers as a 

185
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:34,560
representational system gives you 
unbelievable power.

186
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:40,070
And there are mathematicians that 
believe that there isn't anything more 

187
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:40,070
real than mathematical representations.
Now,

188
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,810
it depends to some degree of course on 
how you classify reality.

189
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,900
That's the problem with a question like,
is a,

190
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,620
a equivalent to be.
The answer to that always is.

191
00:10:49,621 --> 00:10:52,590
Well it depends on how you define a.
and it depends on how you define be.

192
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,960
So generally it's not a very useful 
question,

193
00:10:54,961 --> 00:10:59,961
but you can still get the point that 
there's something very real about 

194
00:10:59,961 --> 00:11:01,050
abstractions,
incredibly real,

195
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:02,910
because otherwise why would you bother 
with them?

196
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:04,680
They wouldn't give you any handle on the
world.

197
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,040
So what's the,
what's the most useful or what's the 

198
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,221
most,
what's the broadest possible level of 

199
00:11:13,221 --> 00:11:16,011
abstraction and is there any use of any 
utility in thinking in that manner.

200
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:21,050
And I tried to make the case last time 
that that in the mythological world 

201
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:26,541
there are three categories or four 
depending on what you do with the 

202
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,911
strange fourth category,
because the fourth category is sort of 

203
00:11:29,911 --> 00:11:33,200
the category of uncategorizable entities
and so it's sort of the category of 

204
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:35,640
everything that not only do you not 
know,

205
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:37,440
but you don't know,
you don't know it hits,

206
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,380
or you can think about it as the 
category of potential.

207
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:45,530
I actually think that's the best way to 
think about it is that it's the dragon 

208
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,230
of chaos is the category of potential.
And I do believe that we're.

209
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,510
Our materialist view is essentially 
wrong.

210
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:56,570
I think that the proper way of looking 
at the at being is that being his 

211
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:59,230
potential and from that potential,
whatever consciousness is,

212
00:11:59,231 --> 00:12:02,780
extracts out the reality that we inhabit
anyways.

213
00:12:02,781 --> 00:12:07,781
That's certainly the mythological 
viewpoint and and but it's not just a 

214
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:07,781
mythological viewpoint.

215
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:08,470
It's,
it's the,

216
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,110
it's a sequence of ideas,
for example,

217
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:15,190
that deeply underlies the thinking of 
your own piaget and piaget by the way.

218
00:12:15,191 --> 00:12:18,880
It was very interested in reconciling 
the gap between religion and science.

219
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:21,760
That's really what he devoted his life 
to doing and so,

220
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:26,910
and there are other streams of 
philosophy and I would say heidegger 

221
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,420
that phenomenologists are,
are thinking along lines that are 

222
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:33,481
similar to this as well because 
heidegger was concerned not with the 

223
00:12:33,481 --> 00:12:35,220
nature of material reality,
but with being as such and,

224
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,550
and,
and so you can extract out the viewpoint

225
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,650
that I just described from,
from mythology,

226
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:45,910
but it isn't the only source of such a,
what would you call it?

227
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:51,030
A high hypotheses is probably the right 
idea.

228
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:52,840
So,
so the idea,

229
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,350
you can think about this as a 
bootstrapping process in some senses.

230
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:01,000
In order for anything to get going,
it has to bootstrap itself up and become

231
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:02,620
more and more complex as it does that.

232
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:07,620
So it's,
it's like this is the answer to the 

233
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:07,620
chicken and egg problem,
right?

234
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,500
Which was first the chicken or the egg.
Well,

235
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:11,770
neither something from which both the 
chicken and egg were derived,

236
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:12,630
right?
Because the,

237
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,660
the ultimate,
the ultimate answer to that is the 

238
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:17,660
answer to how there are things at all,
who knows,

239
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,810
but at some point there were neither 
chickens nor eggs,

240
00:13:19,811 --> 00:13:22,570
but there were the things that were the 
precursors to those things.

241
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,680
And so they spiraled upwards in some 
sense.

242
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:27,390
And those,
those,

243
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,000
uh,
initial,

244
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,000
uh,
prodo entities,

245
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,720
single celled animals for,
we need to go back farther than that.

246
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:35,440
But we could say,
well,

247
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:38,290
single cell animals differentiated over 
time.

248
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,040
Right?
And there's this looping process that,

249
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,920
that differentiates out into both the 
chicken and the egg.

250
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,470
So,
but what the question is,

251
00:13:47,471 --> 00:13:49,720
what do you need in order for that 
process to begin?

252
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:55,740
And that's really the question of what 
the fundamental constituent elements of 

253
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,801
reality are.
And the mythological hypothesis is that 

254
00:13:58,801 --> 00:14:02,041
there are three or four.
One is the fact that there has to be 

255
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:02,470
something that,
that,

256
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,440
that that manifests itself as an 
observer.

257
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:10,470
It's something like that.
Some kind of observer now where that 

258
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,180
process of observation starts in the 
phylogenetic chain is very,

259
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:15,340
very difficult to tell.
No,

260
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,270
we might say,
well,

261
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:21,271
there's certainly no possibility of a 
conscious observer until there's a 

262
00:14:21,271 --> 00:14:24,691
differentiated nervous system.
But then prior to the emergence of 

263
00:14:24,691 --> 00:14:28,231
differentiated nervous systems,
there were animals that were complex 

264
00:14:28,231 --> 00:14:29,590
enough to react with the environment in 
a manner that,

265
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,000
well,
single celled animals,

266
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:32,350
they're quite complex.
I mean,

267
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,210
some of them are unbelievably 
complicated.

268
00:14:34,211 --> 00:14:36,280
You know,
they can move themselves through space,

269
00:14:36,281 --> 00:14:38,320
they can orient,
they can follow chemical trails.

270
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,930
They're not,
they're not stupid by any stretch of the

271
00:14:40,931 --> 00:14:41,680
imagination.

272
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:45,880
Now,
to what degree they have being,

273
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,920
you know,
as something they could represent.

274
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:52,921
Well we don't have to speculate on that,
but the elements of conscious being are 

275
00:14:53,451 --> 00:14:55,100
there.
So you need,

276
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:58,500
you need a being.
You need that.

277
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:03,620
The structure of that being through 
which the the entirety of being itself 

278
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:07,640
is interpreted and you need the 
surround.

279
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,700
It's something like that and so I 
conceptualize that is something that 

280
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,020
knows that's the knower,
what it knows,

281
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:20,080
that's the interpretive structure and 
that which needs to be known or you 

282
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:25,151
could come.
You could conceptualize that as the 

283
00:15:25,151 --> 00:15:27,790
individual in explored territory,
nested inside unexplored territory.

284
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,480
That's another way of thinking about it 
or you can think about it as the 

285
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,241
individual inside culture and the 
individual culture has nested inside 

286
00:15:37,241 --> 00:15:42,191
nature.
That's another way of looking at it or 

287
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,201
you can think of it as the knower and in
order surrounded by chaos.

288
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,940
That's another way of thinking about it,
but all these things,

289
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:52,230
you know,
they're all attempts to articulate the 

290
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,821
same underlying structure.
You see that in narratives continually 

291
00:15:54,821 --> 00:15:57,860
and I think Pinocchio is a very good 
example of that because in Pinocchio you

292
00:15:57,861 --> 00:16:02,861
have the culture that's Japan and Japan 
always obviously creative,

293
00:16:03,501 --> 00:16:08,501
but also insufficient and dad,
which is why he ends up in the belly of 

294
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:12,311
the whale.
You have the blue fairy who's whose 

295
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:12,311
mother nature.
For all intents and purposes,

296
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:16,961
the negative feminine doesn't Manifest 
Itself Much in a Pinocchio story except 

297
00:16:16,961 --> 00:16:19,550
implicitly in the form of the whale.
The thing at the bottom,

298
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:24,551
the which is more like the dragon of 
chaos than something feminine that 

299
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:28,121
swallows up the the swallows up culture,
but you have nature or culture,

300
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,810
Japan,
nature,

301
00:16:29,811 --> 00:16:34,811
the blue fairy,
and then the puppet Pinocchio and you 

302
00:16:34,811 --> 00:16:36,740
know from a strictly scientific 
perspective,

303
00:16:36,741 --> 00:16:41,741
we think of human beings as nothing but 
the children of nature and culture and 

304
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:43,930
that pushes you towards a kind of 
deterministic view.

305
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,230
What causes your behavior?
Well,

306
00:16:45,231 --> 00:16:47,780
it's either nature or culture because 
there isn't anything else,

307
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:53,140
but that isn't how the mythological 
story lays itself out because it says 

308
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,411
there is something else and that's 
whatever your consciousness is and that 

309
00:16:56,411 --> 00:17:00,101
consciousness seems to be able to work 
with nature and culture in a non 

310
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:04,181
deterministic manner in order to bring 
well in order for what?

311
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,410
In order to bring itself forward.
I mean,

312
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:14,411
and that's really what's interesting 
about that I think is that it isn't 

313
00:17:14,411 --> 00:17:18,490
obviously just the plot of Pinocchio.
It's virtually the plot of any story is 

314
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:19,490
the story of the development of the 
individual.

315
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,640
Now the story is order chaos,
higher order,

316
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,770
roughly speaking,
so you can get variance of that.

317
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:32,771
You can get order,
collapses into disorder and nothing is 

318
00:17:32,771 --> 00:17:34,160
resolved.
That's a tragedy,

319
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,790
right,
and and you can get so,

320
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,780
so you don't have to have the entire 
story represented in this story,

321
00:17:41,781 --> 00:17:45,200
but you get fragments of it.
It's a classic you shaped story and what

322
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:50,201
it is is the story of the development of
the individual across time as a 

323
00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:53,960
consequence of his or her adventures in 
time and space and every story is 

324
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,941
exactly that and those are 
representations of the manner in which 

325
00:17:58,941 --> 00:18:02,370
you come to be in the world for better 
or for worse.

326
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,550
It's differentiated so the individual 
has a negative and a pause.

327
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:09,480
Development and culture has a negative 
and a positive element to nature does as

328
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:13,980
well and that makes the potential for 
plots much broader.

329
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:19,550
But,
and I think it's also very useful to 

330
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,400
know that entire story because I think 
it's one of the things that protects you

331
00:18:20,401 --> 00:18:21,810
against ideology.
It's like,

332
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:24,270
okay.
Whereas if someone tells you a political

333
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:27,180
story or a story of any sort,
you can always ask,

334
00:18:27,181 --> 00:18:28,650
well,
where are the missing characters?

335
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:33,890
Human beings are terrible.
They've erected a culture that's 

336
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:33,910
destroying the planet,
and nature has been,

337
00:18:33,911 --> 00:18:36,990
if you know benevolent and and pristine,
it's like,

338
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:37,830
yeah,
fair enough.

339
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:42,950
Accurate,
but you're missing half the characters 

340
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:42,950
because humans aren't,
aren't just terrible.

341
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:47,780
Rip Patients,
creatures and culture is not just a 

342
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,480
destructive force.
And nature is by no means on our side.

343
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,330
So where's the missing characters?

344
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,720
You need all of the characters in the 
representation to get it right.

345
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:57,750
And I really believe this to be true.
So for example,

346
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,870
if you want to protect yourself against 
trauma,

347
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:04,490
as you move forward in life,
you have to be very aware of the three,

348
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:09,520
three negative characters.
You have to know that the human 

349
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,280
individual has an adversarial element 
that's malevolent right to the core.

350
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,760
And if you don't know that and you will 
run across someone who's malevolent,

351
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,760
you will end up damaged.
So because first you won't build it,

352
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:23,770
defend yourself.
You'll just be like a ripe fruit tree 

353
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:23,770
for the plucking.
And second,

354
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:27,830
the mere existence of someone like that 
will pose such a threat to the way that 

355
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,490
you've organized the world,
that it might collapse on you,

356
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,640
that happens to people all the time.
So it really matters whether you know 

357
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,280
these categories and it matters that you
know,

358
00:19:35,281 --> 00:19:37,020
that culture can become tyrannical.

359
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:42,020
It really,
but that it's also your father that's 

360
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:42,020
given you everything and it matters that
you know,

361
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:46,910
everything good comes from nature and 
that we need to live in harmony with 

362
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:49,971
nature to some degree,
but that it's also held band on our 

363
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:51,840
destruction every second.
And it's very paradoxical.

364
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,060
It's,
it's a hard thing to reconcile with,

365
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,690
with,
with,

366
00:19:54,691 --> 00:19:55,450
uh,
with,

367
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:00,460
uh,
a thought structure like modern science 

368
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,871
that's based on a strict logic that 
always says something can't be itself 

369
00:20:02,871 --> 00:20:03,840
and its opposite at the same time.
But you know,

370
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:08,820
human beings can certainly be something 
and it's opposite the at the same time.

371
00:20:08,821 --> 00:20:12,620
And anything truly complex can have that
and does have that bench.

372
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,730
Or if someone offers you a new job,
you think,

373
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:16,200
well that's positive.
It's like,

374
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:17,010
no,
it's not.

375
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:22,940
It's positive and negative and complex.
It might be the solution to your 

376
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:26,871
problem,
but at the same set time it's going to 

377
00:20:26,871 --> 00:20:26,871
generate a whole host of other problems.

378
00:20:26,871 --> 00:20:28,260
So lots of times we're,
we're,

379
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,320
we're encountering entities in some 
sense that have internally paradoxical 

380
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,390
structure and we have to deal with that 
entire set of paradoxes or,

381
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,450
or we don't survive.
It's really a matter of survival.

382
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,740
Okay,
so,

383
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,320
so I'm,
I'm,

384
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,450
and then you know,
there's this overarching symbol which is

385
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:50,451
the dragon of chaos,
which is potential itself and it's the 

386
00:20:50,451 --> 00:20:50,770
potential from which all of these 
categories emerge.

387
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,150
And so the,
the,

388
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:58,830
the most abstract category of our 
imagination is that which is beyond our 

389
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,990
understanding the category of that which
is beyond our understanding.

390
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:07,230
And that seems to me to be represented 
because we can only use the 

391
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,590
representational structures that we 
evolved,

392
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:13,950
is that it's represented in our 
paradoxical representation of the 

393
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:17,110
Predator and the treasure that lies 
beyond the perimeter.

394
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:20,950
That perimeter perimeters of our safe 
societies.

395
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,990
So what's out there beyond?

396
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,130
Well,
we don't know,

397
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,460
but we need to know because we need 
always to deal with what we don't know.

398
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:32,670
So weirdly enough,
we have to come up with a category of 

399
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:35,041
what we don't know in order to start 
formalizing a theory about how we might 

400
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,150
progress towards it and interact with 
it.

401
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,110
It's very paradoxical idea and there's a
paradoxical answer,

402
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:41,500
right?
It's,

403
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:46,501
it's the terrible Predator that lurks in
the unknown that also harbor is 

404
00:21:46,501 --> 00:21:47,170
something of great value.
Perfect.

405
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:49,120
Perfect.
That's exactly right.

406
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,500
That's exactly right.
And,

407
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,680
and I think that that is a reflection of
the fact that human beings are Predator 

408
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,190
animals and prey animals at the same 
time.

409
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:00,460
So what's out there in the,
in the terrible darkness,

410
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,540
something that can destroy you but also 
something that you absolutely need.

411
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:08,530
So how do you,
how do you prepare yourself for that?

412
00:22:08,531 --> 00:22:10,180
And that's the ultimate question of 
life.

413
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,900
It's not how do you deal with death,
although death is a sub component of the

414
00:22:13,901 --> 00:22:18,901
terrible unknown,
I would say it's how do you deal with 

415
00:22:18,901 --> 00:22:21,541
that which is beyond your understanding,
which is constantly manifesting itself 

416
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,430
in the world and that,
and that manifests itself every time you

417
00:22:24,431 --> 00:22:27,040
categorize something and the thing 
escapes from the category.

418
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,150
And that happens most in interpersonal 
relationships because people are so damn

419
00:22:31,151 --> 00:22:32,710
complicated,
you get them figured out,

420
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:37,740
boxed in,
you even make a contract that neither 

421
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:37,740
review,
we'll jump outside the box,

422
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,910
but you jump outside the box 
continually.

423
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:45,120
And that's why a relationship requires 
constant negotiation and 

424
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,331
reconceptualization because you do not 
exhaust the person with your perceptual 

425
00:22:48,331 --> 00:22:53,161
categories.
And of course you don't exhaust the 

426
00:22:53,161 --> 00:22:53,161
world with your perceptual categories 
ever.

427
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:58,530
This is partly why the existentialists,
they have this concept called 

428
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:02,461
alienation.
And the idea was that human beings 

429
00:23:02,461 --> 00:23:02,461
become alienated from their creative 
products.

430
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,880
So,
and that is,

431
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:08,940
and here's why it happened.
So imagine a Henry Ford makes the 

432
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:09,430
assembly line,
right?

433
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:12,880
So for it has no idea what's going to 
happen when he makes the assembly line,

434
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:16,510
like because he's just trying to figure 
out a fast way to make cars or he thinks

435
00:23:16,511 --> 00:23:21,511
that what he's making his cars.
So he thinks he's making an assembly 

436
00:23:21,511 --> 00:23:22,150
line for cars and he thinks he's making 
cars.

437
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,500
And you think,
well,

438
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,700
what's wrong with that?
Well,

439
00:23:24,701 --> 00:23:27,400
first of all,
the assembly line absolutely transformed

440
00:23:27,401 --> 00:23:29,140
the entire planet,
right?

441
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:34,350
Because it,
it brought in the era of mass cheap 

442
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:34,420
manufacturing.
It's like it just,

443
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,080
it was way more than he thought it was.
And then did he make a car?

444
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:45,210
Well,
a car is something that hypothetically 

445
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:45,560
takes you relatively effectively from 
point a to b.

446
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,110
It was really a replacement for the 
horse and buggy.

447
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:53,770
I mean,
they have the first cars looked like 

448
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:53,770
that.
They were horseless carriages.

449
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:53,870
Well,
did he make a car?

450
00:23:53,871 --> 00:23:54,950
Well,
God is God.

451
00:23:54,951 --> 00:23:59,951
It's hard to tell what Henry Ford made.
He made a very effective way for 

452
00:23:59,951 --> 00:24:01,430
transforming the atmosphere.
Right.

453
00:24:01,431 --> 00:24:06,431
And the fact that it also happened to 
take you from point a to point b might 

454
00:24:06,431 --> 00:24:08,900
be completely irrelevant compared to the
fact that it was the internal combustion

455
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:12,900
engine and its rapid distribution 
completely changed the constituent,

456
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:13,410
the,
you know,

457
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:18,420
the,
the fundamental chemical structure of 

458
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,490
the atmosphere itself.
It completely transformed cities.

459
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:22,880
It blew out the rural community.
Everyone moved to the cities,

460
00:24:22,881 --> 00:24:27,881
right?
It made all the cities built around the 

461
00:24:27,881 --> 00:24:30,851
automobile.
But then it had this tremendous 

462
00:24:30,851 --> 00:24:31,130
political and economic significance too.
So I mean,

463
00:24:31,131 --> 00:24:32,900
part of the reason that because you 
think,

464
00:24:32,901 --> 00:24:36,830
well is a car is a way to get from point
a to point b,

465
00:24:36,831 --> 00:24:37,520
but no,
no,

466
00:24:37,521 --> 00:24:38,540
it's not a machine.

467
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:42,470
It's also the embodiment of an idea and 
it's a very strange idea.

468
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:47,620
A collectivist society would have never 
invented the car because the car is 

469
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:51,800
predicated on the idea that you could 
own a conveyance that would get only you

470
00:24:51,801 --> 00:24:55,970
and only you from somewhere to somewhere
else without ever asking anybody for any

471
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:01,360
permission.
And so the funny thing is is when you 

472
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,361
build something like that,
those presuppositions are built into it 

473
00:25:04,361 --> 00:25:05,750
and then when you export that say to 
Soviet Russia,

474
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:10,990
you don't get to.
They can't just take the car and leave 

475
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:11,870
the political implications behind the 
car.

476
00:25:11,871 --> 00:25:16,871
The mere fact that you step into one and
drive it is an indication that you're 

477
00:25:16,871 --> 00:25:21,521
accepting the political ideological 
presuppositions that are part of the 

478
00:25:21,801 --> 00:25:25,640
fact that that thing even exists and so 
well that's alienation.

479
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:30,641
It's like even something you make,
you think what you have control over 

480
00:25:30,641 --> 00:25:32,090
what you make because you've made it.

481
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,320
You understand.
It's like,

482
00:25:33,321 --> 00:25:33,860
no,
you don't.

483
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:39,130
You understand a tiny fraction of it.
You launch it out in the world man and 

484
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:42,340
the snakes inside of it,
the Hydras and high inside of it 

485
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,290
multiply their heads massively 
constantly and you and you and you can't

486
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:47,360
really keep track of it,
and so,

487
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,560
so even even in your relationship with 
created entities,

488
00:25:51,561 --> 00:25:55,700
you still see the reemergence of this 
underlying fundamental substructure,

489
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,740
right?
Even inside it's the,

490
00:25:57,741 --> 00:26:02,741
it's the garden of Eden.
There's always a snake inside the thing 

491
00:26:02,741 --> 00:26:02,741
that's walled in always,
always,

492
00:26:02,741 --> 00:26:07,631
always.
Even God himself could not get rid of 

493
00:26:07,631 --> 00:26:08,060
the snakes in the garden.
And partly what that means is that,

494
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,640
you know the garden is a conceptual 
system.

495
00:26:10,641 --> 00:26:13,580
It's the conceptual system within which 
people exist.

496
00:26:13,581 --> 00:26:16,040
That's Eden is a,
is a walled garden.

497
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:21,460
Paradise means walled garden and it's 
walled because a walled garden is where 

498
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,570
people live because the wall is culture 
and the garden is nature natured.

499
00:26:23,571 --> 00:26:27,380
We always lived in a structure that said
Amalgam of nature and culture,

500
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:31,220
so we set it up so it's paradisical as 
long as we're unconscious,

501
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:36,340
but we can't manage it because there's 
always something chaotic that's coming 

502
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,430
in that we will interact with.
That's human beings.

503
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:42,730
You put a snake in the garden.
It's the first bloody thing we're going 

504
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:42,730
to talk to,
and for better or worse,

505
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:43,920
it makes us conscious and awake.

506
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:49,160
It makes us aware of our mortality.
It does all sorts of terrible things to 

507
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:49,920
us,
but it doesn't matter because that's,

508
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,190
that's the path that human beings have 
what chosen,

509
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:56,680
because that's the implication in that 
story and it's,

510
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,700
it's very difficult.
It's a very difficult thing to answer 

511
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,551
because we certainly choose each other 
for self awareness and consciousness and

512
00:27:05,461 --> 00:27:07,740
intelligence.
And I don't know if you're,

513
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,240
if you're choosing a mate,
there's an arms race in human beings.

514
00:27:12,241 --> 00:27:17,241
We're choosing intelligent mates.
Especially that's especially the case 

515
00:27:17,241 --> 00:27:18,000
for women in relationship to men.
So,

516
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,640
um,
so that,

517
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,200
the idea that that's a choice.
Well,

518
00:27:22,201 --> 00:27:27,201
that's partly why it's eve that makes 
out himself conscious in the garden of 

519
00:27:27,201 --> 00:27:27,201
Eden,
right?

520
00:27:27,201 --> 00:27:30,621
She offers him the apple,
she's the one that makes him self 

521
00:27:30,621 --> 00:27:33,321
conscious and I think that's actually 
accurate because the evidence from the 

522
00:27:33,321 --> 00:27:36,861
evolutionary biologist is that human 
sexual female sexual selection was what 

523
00:27:36,861 --> 00:27:39,270
are the driving factors that 
differentiate us from chimpanzees.

524
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:44,390
It's a major factor.
Chimpanzee females are not selective 

525
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,450
maters.
They go into estrus,

526
00:27:45,451 --> 00:27:50,451
they'll mate with anything.
What happens is the dominant males 

527
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:52,440
chased the subordinate males away and so
they end up leaving more offspring,

528
00:27:52,441 --> 00:27:57,441
but it's not a consequence of selection 
on the part of the females in human 

529
00:27:57,441 --> 00:27:57,441
beings.
It's completely different.

530
00:27:57,441 --> 00:28:01,530
Concealed ovulation and intense 
selection pressure from women on men.

531
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:06,680
You have twice as many female ancestors 
as you have male ancestors and people 

532
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,670
could never have have a hard time 
working that out arithmetically,

533
00:28:08,671 --> 00:28:11,730
but it's not that problematic.
You just think on average,

534
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:15,870
every woman had one child,
half of men had none,

535
00:28:15,871 --> 00:28:20,871
and the other half had to.
And that's approximately correct if you 

536
00:28:20,871 --> 00:28:23,610
average across the entire history of 
human sexuality.

537
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:27,660
So human males in particular are subject
to a vicious selection,

538
00:28:27,661 --> 00:28:32,661
pressure on the part of females,
and I also think that's partly why 

539
00:28:32,661 --> 00:28:36,530
nature is represented symbolically as 
female among human beings,

540
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:39,660
because after all,
nature is what selects.

541
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:44,660
There's no better definition of nature 
then that which selects so now.

542
00:28:46,441 --> 00:28:47,430
So.
So here's,

543
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,500
here's why I want to talk to you about 
the brain a little bit,

544
00:28:49,501 --> 00:28:54,501
because if you make the radical case,
let's say that these are actually the 

545
00:28:54,501 --> 00:28:56,520
categories of reality and we're going to
say,

546
00:28:56,521 --> 00:28:57,570
well,
reality is what?

547
00:28:57,571 --> 00:28:59,370
Select for this,
for the sake of,

548
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,930
for this,
for the sake of argument,

549
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,860
then the than our,
our neurological structures and our 

550
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,880
physical structure should be adapted to 
that reality.

551
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:09,540
It's,
it's,

552
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,360
it's a,
it's a necessary conclusion from that.

553
00:29:12,361 --> 00:29:13,830
So then the question is,
well,

554
00:29:13,831 --> 00:29:15,960
are they,
and as far as I can tell,

555
00:29:15,961 --> 00:29:18,390
the answer to that is yes.
And so we'll,

556
00:29:18,391 --> 00:29:23,391
we'll go through the,
the neuropsychological evidence quite 

557
00:29:23,391 --> 00:29:27,590
rapidly.
The first bit of evidence is that you 

558
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:27,590
have two hemispheres.
Why?

559
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:33,710
One deals with the unknown and the other
deals with the known that sale Conan 

560
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:33,710
Goldberg.
That's,

561
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:38,150
that's hypothesized completely 
independently of any of this underlying 

562
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:41,211
mythological substructure,
which is really important thing to note 

563
00:29:41,211 --> 00:29:42,340
because if you're trying to determine 
whether

564
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,260
or not something is true,
valid,

565
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:49,030
if the constructs upon which you base 
your thinking are valid and true,

566
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:54,330
there's rules for doing that and one of 
the rules is you have to be able to 

567
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,680
detect the existence of the categories 
using multiple methods of,

568
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:57,680
of,
uh,

569
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,880
of,
of what using multiple methods.

570
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,540
It's the multi-method multitrack Matrix,
technically speaking,

571
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,770
it was established as a technique by two
psychologists named crone,

572
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,450
back C,
r o n b,

573
00:30:10,451 --> 00:30:12,040
a,
c h and meal M,

574
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:16,060
e e h l Paul Meehl back in the 19 
fifties when psychologists,

575
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:21,061
we're trying to figure out how do you 
determine if something actually has an 

576
00:30:21,061 --> 00:30:24,301
existence like anger or anxiety as 
something that you could study 

577
00:30:24,301 --> 00:30:24,430
scientifically.
And the answer is,

578
00:30:24,431 --> 00:30:29,431
well,
you have to be able to measure it 

579
00:30:29,431 --> 00:30:30,610
multiple ways and all those measurements
have to read the same way.

580
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,020
And then the question is,
well,

581
00:30:32,021 --> 00:30:34,540
what do you mean by multiple ways?

582
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:37,930
Because his sight and vision is sight 
and hearing different.

583
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:41,500
While somewhat and somewhat the same,
but you know,

584
00:30:41,501 --> 00:30:46,501
you do,
you make them as different as you can 

585
00:30:46,501 --> 00:30:46,501
manage,
let's say,

586
00:30:46,501 --> 00:30:46,660
and our sensory systems are quite 
different.

587
00:30:46,661 --> 00:30:48,820
Smell,
molecular signature,

588
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:52,540
sound is auditory are you know,
auditory pressure,

589
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:55,600
you need a,
a gas around you or some liquid in order

590
00:30:55,601 --> 00:30:57,700
for that to occur.
Site uses light,

591
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:57,980
you know,
we're,

592
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:01,960
we're using different inputs that 
converge and allow us to say,

593
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:06,961
well,
if we get convergent information across 

594
00:31:06,961 --> 00:31:08,881
these multiple measurements,
then we'll assume that the thing we're 

595
00:31:08,881 --> 00:31:11,730
perceiving is real.
We even extend that in science because 

596
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:15,121
we say if you take your multiple 
measurement system and you take your 

597
00:31:15,121 --> 00:31:16,450
multiple,
multiple measurement system and then you

598
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:21,451
compare them will only allow what's 
constant across both those comparisons 

599
00:31:21,451 --> 00:31:25,651
to be real.
And so that's the multi-method multi 

600
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:26,020
trade matrix process essentially.

601
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:31,470
And my sense is that the.
So I think that the pattern that I'm 

602
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:34,360
describing to you,
it's manifested itself evolutionarily.

603
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:39,361
It manifests itself at the mural in the 
literal logical space and it manifests 

604
00:31:39,361 --> 00:31:42,640
itself in the conceptual space and the 
probability of all three of those things

605
00:31:42,641 --> 00:31:46,240
happening at the same time.
Without there being something valid,

606
00:31:46,241 --> 00:31:51,241
there is lessons with each level of 
interpretation you manage to stack on 

607
00:31:51,281 --> 00:31:53,350
top of one another.
So that's the,

608
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:54,550
that's the method.
Well,

609
00:31:54,551 --> 00:31:58,720
so let's think about the brain a little 
bit and I'll tell you a little bit about

610
00:31:58,721 --> 00:32:03,721
how the brain works and uh,
and you know,

611
00:32:04,961 --> 00:32:07,300
a lot of this stuff I'm telling you 
right now is quite old.

612
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:08,200
Actually.
Most of it was,

613
00:32:08,201 --> 00:32:10,900
worked out in the 19,
in the 19 eighties,

614
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:13,750
but it's been remarkably stable as far 
as I can tell.

615
00:32:13,751 --> 00:32:16,930
In some sense we're filling in the 
details and not in every sense,

616
00:32:16,931 --> 00:32:19,210
but in some sense we're filling in the 
details.

617
00:32:19,211 --> 00:32:20,080
Okay.
So you take,

618
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:23,160
this is from Alexander Luria,
who was the,

619
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,200
the greatest,
perhaps the greatest neuropsychologist 

620
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:28,270
who ever lived.
He was a Russian,

621
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:30,780
a more work mostly after the second 
world war,

622
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:35,810
mostly on people who had brain damage 
and he was interested in trying to 

623
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:35,810
outline the,
the,

624
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,030
the,
the,

625
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,130
the,
the overarching picture of

626
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:45,130
brain function.
And so he did that partly by looking at 

627
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:48,671
its function,
but also partly by looking at its 

628
00:32:48,671 --> 00:32:50,651
structure,
trying to get both of those things 

629
00:32:50,651 --> 00:32:50,651
working simultaneously.
And so we'll,

630
00:32:50,651 --> 00:32:52,640
we'll go through a brief picture of how 
the brain works.

631
00:32:52,641 --> 00:32:57,641
And so one of the ways of so you can,
you can look at the brain from front to 

632
00:32:57,641 --> 00:33:02,381
back and you can divided roughly into 
two sections and one section has to do 

633
00:33:02,381 --> 00:33:06,131
with sensory processing and that's 
roughly the back half and one section 

634
00:33:06,131 --> 00:33:09,731
has to do with motor output.
Now those things aren't as clearly 

635
00:33:09,731 --> 00:33:11,610
differentiated as you might think 
because you.

636
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,690
There's very little sensation without 
motor output.

637
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,470
Maybe the,
the part that closest to an exception is

638
00:33:18,471 --> 00:33:19,370
smell,
I would say.

639
00:33:19,371 --> 00:33:21,770
But you at least have to breathe in,
you know,

640
00:33:21,771 --> 00:33:24,320
and when an animal is actively searching
out a scent trail,

641
00:33:24,321 --> 00:33:25,070
it's breathing in.

642
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:30,070
So it's,
it's using its motor output constantly 

643
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,471
to modify the sensory stream.
It's really difficult to dissociate the 

644
00:33:32,471 --> 00:33:32,720
two.
And when you're looking at something you

645
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:37,721
know,
it kind of feels to you like you're a 

646
00:33:37,721 --> 00:33:38,450
passive recipient of sense data,
but you're no such thing.

647
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:43,220
Your eyes are moving back and forth in 
multiple ways all the time,

648
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:46,130
including the ways that you can control 
voluntarily.

649
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:51,160
So there's multiple involuntary systems 
that are moving your eyes in multiple 

650
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,461
ways.
And really what you're doing is feeling 

651
00:33:54,461 --> 00:33:54,461
the,
the array of,

652
00:33:54,461 --> 00:33:58,990
of electromagnetic,
of the electromagnetic spectrum with 

653
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:02,021
your eyes.
You're feeling it and you're actively 

654
00:34:02,021 --> 00:34:04,331
exploring.
If you're not a passive recipient at 

655
00:34:04,331 --> 00:34:04,580
all.
So even in sensation,

656
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:09,760
you can't purely pull sensation out for 
motor processing and say I'm getting 

657
00:34:10,011 --> 00:34:15,011
untrammeled unbiased sense data because 
you can't look at something without 

658
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:19,850
focusing and you can't focus without 
wanting to look at something.

659
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,460
You can't just lie there with you while 
you could,

660
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:24,590
with your eyes have crossed.
But you know,

661
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:29,740
that's sort of like,
imagine you dropped a video recorder 

662
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,030
from an airplane and it just spun around
in an unfocused manner.

663
00:34:32,031 --> 00:34:34,990
Well that's the world sampled randomly.
You know,

664
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,530
why?
What are you gonna do with that?

665
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,910
Nothing.
And you know,

666
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:39,800
you're,
you're concentrating on the,

667
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:44,890
on the,
on the auditory stream constantly and 

668
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:46,280
segregating out some things and 
suppressing others.

669
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,990
Like if you listen in the classroom,

670
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,660
you can hear

671
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:58,180
probably four or five different types of
mechanical noise going on at the same 

672
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:02,231
time.
Most of the time in the classroom that 

673
00:35:02,231 --> 00:35:05,671
silent,
you don't hear it like you don't hear 

674
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:05,671
your fridge,
except when it turns on or off,

675
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:06,350
right?
Is Zero that out.

676
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,200
And so you're very selective in your 
perception.

677
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:14,780
So you can't really technically separate
out motor output from sensory input.

678
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:19,781
And that's really useful to know because
it destroys the idea that you're just a 

679
00:35:19,781 --> 00:35:24,420
pat,
you know that there's a world of 

680
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,051
sensation out there that's imprinting 
itself on you and that's how you get 

681
00:35:26,051 --> 00:35:26,660
your information,
which is really the.

682
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:31,550
That's the fundamental presupposition of
the empiricists of the raw empiricists.

683
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:36,850
There's a world of sense data out there.
You sample it randomly and that's what 

684
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:36,850
informs you.
It's like,

685
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:41,141
yes,
except that you're always an active 

686
00:35:41,141 --> 00:35:44,400
harvester of the information so you 
can't get rid of the interpretive 

687
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:44,400
structure a priority.

688
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,890
That was a manual count by the way,
who first established out in his 

689
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:52,311
critique of pure reason.
You can't get away from the fact that 

690
00:35:52,311 --> 00:35:53,550
you're actively harvesting the data so 
you can say,

691
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,200
well,
where does human structure come from?

692
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,780
The census data,
that sort of the blank slate idea.

693
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:02,610
It's like no wrong because a blank slate
cannot process information.

694
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:05,220
You're actively engaged right at the 
beginning,

695
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,370
so that's another example of the knower 
and the unknown,

696
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,300
you know,
working in a cyclical manner because you

697
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:16,960
interact with something you divided up 
into you,

698
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:21,990
you and the world roughly speaking,
and I mean you really make it that way 

699
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:25,590
because you build yourself out of the 
information and then of course that 

700
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:28,611
makes you a more differentiated 
processor with a broader range of 

701
00:36:28,611 --> 00:36:29,130
skills.
Then you interact with the unknown.

702
00:36:29,131 --> 00:36:34,131
Again,
you gather more information at 

703
00:36:34,131 --> 00:36:34,131
differentiates the world.

704
00:36:34,131 --> 00:36:37,430
It makes you a more differentiated 
harvester and then so it's just 

705
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,940
continually cycling and that 
consciousness,

706
00:36:38,941 --> 00:36:43,941
the logos,
the knower is that thing that's doing 

707
00:36:43,941 --> 00:36:45,780
that harvesting and you can never say 
it's not there.

708
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,410
Now what happens is that it's in it's 
nascent form to begin with,

709
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,160
low resolution,
nascent for low resolution knower,

710
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,910
low resolution category system,
low resolution world,

711
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:02,360
but that's enough to kick it and to 
start a differentiated and that happens 

712
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,400
as you develop as an individual because 
you start out as a single celled 

713
00:37:07,411 --> 00:37:12,411
organism for all intents and purposes,
a very low resolution thing in a very 

714
00:37:12,411 --> 00:37:16,791
low resolution world.
And that differentiates itself across 

715
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:16,860
time.
But exactly the same thing happened over

716
00:37:16,861 --> 00:37:18,870
evolutionary time.
So,

717
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:23,160
so there isn't a time when those three 
elements aren't there.

718
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:26,040
For all intents and purposes,
they're always there.

719
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,270
They're permanent.
Okay?

720
00:37:27,271 --> 00:37:28,740
So anyways,
back to the brain,

721
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,080
since century unit,
that's the,

722
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,370
that's the,
uh,

723
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,560
the back half,
roughly speaking,

724
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:37,980
huge chunk of that is devoted to visual 
processing in human beings,

725
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:38,430
right?

726
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,370
Most animals organized around smell,
not us,

727
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:46,550
somewhat stale because smell is a very 
powerful evoker of memories and it has a

728
00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:52,281
direct relationship with emotional 
systems because you need to know if 

729
00:37:52,281 --> 00:37:53,400
something is edible or inevitable,
terrible or,

730
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:55,260
or good very,
very rapidly.

731
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,600
But human beings are organized around 
vision.

732
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:01,380
So we have a massive,
massive amounts of our cortex devoted to

733
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:05,130
differentiated visual processing.
Now the motor unit,

734
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,160
so what you have is each of these little
zones here.

735
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,130
So for example,
look at the back here,

736
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:15,480
that's the primary visual area and the 
secondary visual area.

737
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:20,840
And then this is the primary auditory 
area in the middle of the brain here on 

738
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,110
the outside and the secondary auditory 
area.

739
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,150
And then the,
uh,

740
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,710
the,
the uh,

741
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:29,670
this is for body representation,
the primary area and the secondary area.

742
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:33,570
And you can think about those,
those areas of primary,

743
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,770
primary,
secondary,

744
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:35,740
and then tertiary

745
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:40,980
primary does the base level processing,
tertiary expands that up into more 

746
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:45,571
abstract representate or secondary 
expands that up into more abstract 

747
00:38:45,571 --> 00:38:48,370
representations and tertiary are the 
areas where the sensors come together.

748
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:51,780
And that's really what you seem to be 
most conscious of,

749
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:57,140
right action in the tertiary areas 
because you don't really see the world 

750
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:01,651
as a separate.
You can think about the auditory stream 

751
00:39:01,651 --> 00:39:02,050
separate from the visual stream and all 
of that,

752
00:39:02,051 --> 00:39:03,550
and you can think about touch 
separately,

753
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:06,880
but you attended it consciously 
experienced things as a unity,

754
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,400
as a comprehensive unity of all the 
senses simultaneously,

755
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:17,080
so consciousness seems to occur only at 
most of the time at the highest level of

756
00:39:17,081 --> 00:39:22,081
integration and you would have 
associated consciousness more with the 

757
00:39:22,081 --> 00:39:25,561
tertiary areas where the,
where the senses are talking to one 

758
00:39:25,561 --> 00:39:28,771
another.
Now it's more complicated than that 

759
00:39:28,771 --> 00:39:30,370
because there's obviously subcortical 
structures all the way down to the spine

760
00:39:30,371 --> 00:39:32,920
that are involved heavily in what 
consciousness is.

761
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:37,090
It's not merely a consequence of 
cortical activity,

762
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:42,640
you know,
we tend to think that because human 

763
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,401
beings have massively expanded cortical 
structures and we think of ourselves as 

764
00:39:44,401 --> 00:39:46,690
the most conscious creatures and that's 
reasonable,

765
00:39:46,691 --> 00:39:50,530
but you can take an awful lot of cortex 
off someone and they're still conscious.

766
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:55,920
In fact,
you can leave them with almost no brain 

767
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,830
at all and they're still conscious.
So we really have a rough time trying to

768
00:39:56,831 --> 00:39:59,800
figure out what consciousness is and how
it's related to brain structure.

769
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:06,240
So anyways,
so that's the sensory and the motor 

770
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:08,390
unit,
you have the,

771
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:11,740
the primary unit,
the secondary unit,

772
00:40:11,741 --> 00:40:13,930
and the promoter or the prefrontal 
Cortex,

773
00:40:13,931 --> 00:40:16,910
and the prefrontal cortex is 
particularly in a huge human beings.

774
00:40:16,911 --> 00:40:21,670
So imagine that it's this primary and 
secondary areas that allow you to,

775
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,750
to first of all to act voluntarily and 
then two,

776
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,840
and then to play around in some sense 
with your actions,

777
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,940
you know,
like imagine that,

778
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:36,690
imagine that you're a child building 
with Legos and you can think with the 

779
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:40,411
legos without,
without really having to think 

780
00:40:40,411 --> 00:40:40,411
abstractly,
right?

781
00:40:40,411 --> 00:40:42,190
Because you can play around and build 
different sorts of structures and so you

782
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:47,191
can think at the level,
at a level of motor output without 

783
00:40:47,191 --> 00:40:50,821
having to depend on abstraction.
But if you develop the prefrontal cortex

784
00:40:51,341 --> 00:40:56,341
here,
which emerged out of the motor and 

785
00:40:56,341 --> 00:40:56,341
premotor areas over the course of 
evolution.

786
00:40:56,341 --> 00:40:57,760
So it's a differentiation of those 
structures.

787
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:03,210
So this is dealing with the real world.
This is dealing mostly with the real 

788
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,110
world,
but starting to abstract and,

789
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,780
and experiment a little bit.
And then this one,

790
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,130
this part deals with abstractions,
pure and simple.

791
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:11,590
So you know,
I can,

792
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:14,830
I can,
I can lift this and then I can play with

793
00:41:14,831 --> 00:41:19,831
lifting it and then I can put it aside 
and think about it abstractly.

794
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,780
I can think about all the different 
things that I might do with it.

795
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:23,170
I say,
well,

796
00:41:23,171 --> 00:41:24,820
I could throw it,
I can take it apart.

797
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,370
I could throw,
I could toss it near,

798
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,660
I could juggle it,
I could use it as a doorstop,

799
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,610
right?
I could kick it across the room.

800
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:35,850
And so basically what I'm doing there is
I'm using my prefrontal Cortex to 

801
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:40,061
generate an abstract representation of 
the world and then to plot out motor 

802
00:41:40,061 --> 00:41:44,111
strategies before implementing them.
And that's basically what abstract 

803
00:41:44,111 --> 00:41:45,740
thought is very,
very fundamentally.

804
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,060
It's,
it's,

805
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:52,660
it's the hypothesis of abstract action 
and then the analysis of the outcome and

806
00:41:53,271 --> 00:41:57,770
then the implementation into action.
And I think that there's something about

807
00:41:57,771 --> 00:42:02,771
that that actually defines the 
difference between intelligence and 

808
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:03,890
conscientiousness because weirdly 
enough,

809
00:42:03,891 --> 00:42:06,170
you know,
the correlation between intelligence and

810
00:42:06,171 --> 00:42:10,820
conscientiousness is zero.
No relationship whatsoever.

811
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:14,930
Which is quite strange because 
conscientious people plan and so forth.

812
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:19,931
But I think what it is is that 
intelligence is an indicator of the 

813
00:42:19,931 --> 00:42:23,360
effectiveness of abstraction and 
conscientiousness is an indicator of the

814
00:42:23,361 --> 00:42:26,270
probability of implementation and those 
are very,

815
00:42:26,271 --> 00:42:31,271
very different problems and you don't 
just go from abstraction to 

816
00:42:31,271 --> 00:42:32,150
implementation because if you did,
you wouldn't be able to think,

817
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:32,900
right.

818
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:38,110
The thinking has to be torn away from 
the implementation or what you're doing 

819
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:41,810
isn't thinking it's just acting so and 
so.

820
00:42:41,811 --> 00:42:46,811
I think that accounts for the 
psychometric independence of those two 

821
00:42:46,811 --> 00:42:50,580
phenomena.
It's annoying because you can think up 

822
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:54,461
something that you should do and you 
won't do it because there's no 

823
00:42:54,461 --> 00:42:56,570
deterministic causal pathway from the 
conception to the action.

824
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:01,780
So that's kind of annoying.
It seems to take something like 

825
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,070
willpower in order to transform the 
abstraction into an implementation and 

826
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:10,510
we don't understand that very well.
It's easy to understand the resistance 

827
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:13,460
to doing it because Mo,
the default position of your body should

828
00:43:13,461 --> 00:43:14,600
be something like,
no,

829
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:17,940
it never do anything except eat,
you know,

830
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:22,400
because doing something requires the 
expenditure of energy and resources.

831
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:25,370
And so unless you have a really good 
rationale for it,

832
00:43:25,371 --> 00:43:30,371
you should probably not do it.
And so the body is sort of intransigent 

833
00:43:30,371 --> 00:43:30,550
by nature.

834
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,920
It's an oversimplification.
You have to come up with a good reason 

835
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,080
to impella it into motion and you 
should,

836
00:43:36,081 --> 00:43:41,081
because you have to pay for action,
you have to pay for it with energy and 

837
00:43:41,081 --> 00:43:45,641
resources.
So there should be resistance against 

838
00:43:45,641 --> 00:43:45,641
it,
but it's still annoying.

839
00:43:45,641 --> 00:43:45,800
So,
okay,

840
00:43:45,801 --> 00:43:47,660
so that's one way of thinking about the 
world,

841
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:50,270
the world,
something to sense and the world,

842
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:55,280
something to act upon.
And so the brain has fundamental 

843
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,010
divisions of sensing and acting upon.
But there,

844
00:43:57,210 --> 00:44:02,210
it's a constantly interacting loop.
You can't separate them really anymore 

845
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:04,370
than we are separating them 
conceptually.

846
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:10,240
Now on the motor strip

847
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:13,690
here,

848
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:21,630
the body is represented and this was 
discovered at the Montreal neurological 

849
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:22,180
institute,
um,

850
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:24,460
when,
when,

851
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:27,490
when brain surgery was been doing,
was being done on,

852
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:30,250
on,
on people generally who had epilepsy or,

853
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:32,280
or some other terrible brain illness.

854
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:35,220
You have brain surgery when you're 
awake,

855
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,890
which is a rather horrifying thing to 
know about.

856
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:43,190
But the reason for that,
generally speaking is so that something 

857
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:45,540
isn't taken out that you need.
Now,

858
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:48,750
one of the things that happened while 
people were having brain surgery done,

859
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:50,700
and this would have been,
I believe,

860
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:55,230
I don't remember the exact time between 
the thirties and the fifties,

861
00:44:55,231 --> 00:44:56,800
I believe,
um,

862
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,600
and I think it was hab.
If I remember properly,

863
00:45:00,601 --> 00:45:02,910
who was one of Canada's great 
neuropsychologists,

864
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:09,040
do brain stimulation while people were 
having brain surgery and they could map 

865
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,460
out the way the body was represented on 
the cortical surface.

866
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,740
And so you imagine there's two 
representations.

867
00:45:13,741 --> 00:45:17,190
There's,
there's a sensory representation of your

868
00:45:17,191 --> 00:45:22,191
body on the cortical surface and there's
a motor representation of your body on 

869
00:45:22,191 --> 00:45:23,670
the cortical surface.
Those are both called.

870
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,190
The representations are called 
[inaudible].

871
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,200
Monkey will either.
They're like the body has been laid out 

872
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:30,720
on this strange strip or the strip of 
tissue.

873
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,420
You can look up the whole monkey lie 
online and see what they're like,

874
00:45:33,421 --> 00:45:38,421
but I'll show you a.
they're sort of stretched out weirdly 

875
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:43,100
long here.
That would be the motor one.

876
00:45:43,101 --> 00:45:45,290
And then along here,
that would be the sensory one.

877
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:50,560
And you can Kinda,
you can kind of detect with your own 

878
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,360
consciousness how your body is 
represented in your brain.

879
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:55,490
So for example,
um,

880
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:59,360
can I get you to stand up if you would 
turn around?

881
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:03,680
Okay.
So how many fingers on your back?

882
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:06,420
Okay.

883
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,800
Alright.
Why low resolution?

884
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:13,250
He's like a row on his back is like a 
low resolution,

885
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,740
a array of pixels.
Right?

886
00:46:15,741 --> 00:46:20,741
And so it's virtually impossible.
You just don't have enough sensory 

887
00:46:20,741 --> 00:46:22,460
tissue on your back to make that.
You could tell I was pushing,

888
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,640
but it could have been a bad.
It could have been five fingers.

889
00:46:25,641 --> 00:46:30,641
It doesn't matter.
Maybe your pixel is this big or 

890
00:46:30,641 --> 00:46:30,641
something like that.
Right?

891
00:46:30,641 --> 00:46:35,260
And so,
but if I put a finger on your lip like 

892
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:35,360
that,
man,

893
00:46:35,361 --> 00:46:38,630
you've got it right now or on your 
tongue because your tongue,

894
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:43,660
there's more sensory representation of 
your tongue than your entire trunk and 

895
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:43,910
well,
why?

896
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:45,710
Well,
you don't want to bite your tongue that,

897
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,620
that's a big problem.
You have to be able to talk.

898
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:52,250
You want to really differentiate what 
you're eating.

899
00:46:52,251 --> 00:46:54,230
If you're eating fish,
you don't want to eat the bones.

900
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:59,230
So.
And you know when your tongue is 

901
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:00,470
unbelievably crazily sensitive and you 
know that too,

902
00:47:00,471 --> 00:47:05,471
that if you have a tooth pulled,
your tongue will investigate that area 

903
00:47:05,511 --> 00:47:07,180
for like six months.
You're,

904
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:12,350
you're sitting there,
your attention wanes and your tongue is 

905
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:15,731
in there like mapping like mad mapping,
that little hole to update your body 

906
00:47:15,731 --> 00:47:15,731
representation.
Right?

907
00:47:15,731 --> 00:47:20,651
And it's just this crazy thing that is 
unbelievably well represented.

908
00:47:20,961 --> 00:47:25,961
Set from the sensory perspective and 
also from the motor perspective because 

909
00:47:25,961 --> 00:47:26,750
you could manipulate your tongue like 
crazy.

910
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:31,990
It's like a quarter of your motor output
system is devoted to tongue 

911
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:34,660
manipulation.
Right?

912
00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:38,320
And so here's a,
here's a picture of the homonculus.

913
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:40,960
This is a motor homunculus.
So,

914
00:47:40,961 --> 00:47:45,961
and that's how,
that's what your brain thinks of your 

915
00:47:45,961 --> 00:47:45,961
body,
that that's a good way of thinking about

916
00:47:45,961 --> 00:47:46,510
it.
And so that's what a human being is like

917
00:47:46,511 --> 00:47:48,310
in terms of his or her output.

918
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:51,700
And so what you see,
if you look at a sensory homonculus,

919
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,890
it's quite similar except the feet are 
bigger.

920
00:47:53,891 --> 00:47:58,891
The Genitalia or bigger.
Logically they don't have much motor 

921
00:47:58,891 --> 00:47:59,290
utility,
but they have a lot of sensor utility.

922
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,960
But the rest of it's quite similar,
so there's,

923
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:04,120
you know,
the motor and the sensory homonculus are

924
00:48:04,121 --> 00:48:09,121
quite similar.
But I'm going to talk about the motor 

925
00:48:09,121 --> 00:48:09,121
homunculus because it's sort of the 
action representation.

926
00:48:09,121 --> 00:48:10,600
Well,
so what are human beings like?

927
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,740
Well,
we're all hands.

928
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:16,850
That's the first thing you know,
and if you,

929
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,940
if you do that,
there's no,

930
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,900
it's unbelievably high resolution and 
your fingertips and,

931
00:48:21,901 --> 00:48:22,630
and,
and the,

932
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:27,960
and the sensory.
But we can manipulate our hands like 

933
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,080
crazy.
Like they're unbelievably articulate it.

934
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:34,620
Right?
And that's the thing that makes us able 

935
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:34,620
to change the world.
It makes us what dolphins aren't.

936
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:39,780
And so a huge part of our brain is 
devoted towards being able to move our 

937
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:39,780
hands.

938
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:42,280
Now it enables us to take things apart,
put them together.

939
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:45,820
And then once we learned to take things 
apart and put them together,

940
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,270
we can talk about how we do that.
And that's a lot of what we're doing.

941
00:48:49,271 --> 00:48:51,280
And that's the hands in the mouth and 
the tongue.

942
00:48:51,281 --> 00:48:54,490
Roughly speaking.
Here's how I took something apart.

943
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:57,460
Chaos.
Here's what I made out of it.

944
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,290
Order,
here's how I did it.

945
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:02,620
And then you received that and you're 
happy about it,

946
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:07,770
and then you can do the same thing.
And that's imitation facilitated by 

947
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:08,230
language.
It's like,

948
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:12,400
here's what I did with my body.
I'm propagating the cross space.

949
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:15,640
You're taking it,
mapping it onto your body.

950
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:17,530
Now you can do the same thing.
Yeah.

951
00:49:17,531 --> 00:49:18,430
And that's,
you know,

952
00:49:18,431 --> 00:49:20,950
it might be simple like this is how you 
pick up a rock,

953
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:26,250
but it might be complicated,
like here's how you go after the dragon 

954
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:26,250
of chaos.

955
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:30,990
Right?
And so that's sort of maps onto that 

956
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:33,990
hierarchy,
this thing that we've talked about in 

957
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:36,370
some detail this,
when you're telling a story to people,

958
00:49:36,371 --> 00:49:38,080
when you're informing them about 
something,

959
00:49:38,081 --> 00:49:40,840
you can talk to them at a very high 
level of resolution,

960
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:44,740
which you do with your child.
Here's how you slice up some Broccoli,

961
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,620
right?
But then you move up the obstruction and

962
00:49:47,621 --> 00:49:52,621
say,
here's how you act like a civilized 

963
00:49:52,621 --> 00:49:52,621
person at the dinner table.
Right?

964
00:49:52,621 --> 00:49:54,580
And that's part of being a good person.
So you can tell stories about,

965
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:57,700
I just went and saw logan,
which I really liked.

966
00:49:57,701 --> 00:49:58,750
By the way,
it's super violent,

967
00:49:58,751 --> 00:50:00,660
but I really did like it.
It's,

968
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:03,670
it's got a very elegant mythological 
structure,

969
00:50:03,671 --> 00:50:07,810
which is not surprising,
but there's a scene in this logan movie.

970
00:50:07,811 --> 00:50:08,470
He,
he,

971
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,160
he,
uh,

972
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:14,220
it's not a spoiler.
He has this child with him who has not 

973
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:18,661
been,
who's been raised roughly in the 

974
00:50:18,661 --> 00:50:18,760
laboratory and she has absolutely no 
table manners.

975
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:23,910
And so they're sitting at the dinner 
with some people that they've run into 

976
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:27,560
and she's eating like a total barbarian.
And of course everybody's eyebrows race.

977
00:50:27,561 --> 00:50:30,170
Like where did this person come from?
So the,

978
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:35,260
the fact that that high order behavior 
isn't there is something that's of 

979
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:37,990
extraordinary interest to everyone.
And so you know,

980
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,880
you,
you teach your children micro strategies

981
00:50:40,881 --> 00:50:45,881
and you teach the macro strategies.
Some of the macro strategies you're 

982
00:50:45,881 --> 00:50:49,121
teaching them,
you don't even understand you because 

983
00:50:49,121 --> 00:50:52,511
you know,
you know the strategies they're built 

984
00:50:52,511 --> 00:50:52,511
into you because of an evolutionary 
process,

985
00:50:52,511 --> 00:50:54,230
roughly speaking.
And you say things like,

986
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:56,090
it doesn't matter whether you win or 
lose.

987
00:50:56,091 --> 00:50:59,270
It matters how you play the game and you
don't understand what that means.

988
00:50:59,271 --> 00:51:04,271
Although you know it's right and you try
to act that out for your children and 

989
00:51:04,271 --> 00:51:06,830
they incorporate it in their action,
even though they can't represent that,

990
00:51:06,831 --> 00:51:11,831
they cannot come up with a fully 
articulated representation of what that 

991
00:51:11,831 --> 00:51:12,740
means,
and so they're like children,

992
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:13,910
the [inaudible] children.

993
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:20,080
Children can only play by themselves to 
begin with while they're integrating 

994
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,980
themselves internally.
Then they start to play in parallel with

995
00:51:21,981 --> 00:51:24,290
other children,
so you'll you're to.

996
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:27,230
You play your game.
That child plays his or her gait,

997
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,960
little interaction,
but you can't unite the games.

998
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:35,650
Then you're between two and four.
You start to be able to unite the games 

999
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:36,650
and you can either do that by acting 
them out.

1000
00:51:36,651 --> 00:51:38,360
You can do this even with a younger 
child,

1001
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:43,190
they can catch peekaboo very rapidly,
but once you're between two and four and

1002
00:51:43,191 --> 00:51:45,470
you start getting linguistic,
you could start saying,

1003
00:51:45,471 --> 00:51:50,471
well,
let's play this game and that means 

1004
00:51:50,471 --> 00:51:51,110
we're going to unite our attention 
towards a particular goal.

1005
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:55,610
We're gonna unite our motor activity and
maybe cooperate and compete towards that

1006
00:51:55,611 --> 00:51:58,820
goal.
So beginning of of the social structure,

1007
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:00,560
so the beginning of the social 
structure,

1008
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:03,440
and you get really good at that between 
two and four,

1009
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,140
but you don't necessarily know what 
you're doing.

1010
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:11,260
You can't say it.
So Piaget's experiments indicated that 

1011
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:15,011
if you take children,
maybe they've got to the point where 

1012
00:52:15,011 --> 00:52:15,170
they can play quite a social game.
Maybe they're five or six,

1013
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:20,260
they're playing marbles.
You take them out of the game and you 

1014
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:20,260
say,
okay,

1015
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:20,360
tell me the rules of the game of 
marbles.

1016
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:23,690
They give incoherent representations.
Why?

1017
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:27,620
Because their behavior is more 
sophisticated than their representation.

1018
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:29,810
You see,
as soon as you understand that,

1019
00:52:29,811 --> 00:52:33,140
that is a wild thing to understand 
because it answers the question.

1020
00:52:33,141 --> 00:52:38,141
For example,
how can you have dreams that tell you 

1021
00:52:38,141 --> 00:52:39,050
things you don't know?
You think,

1022
00:52:39,051 --> 00:52:40,760
well,
how the hell can that possibly be?

1023
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:45,850
You're coming up with the damn dream.
How can the dream tell you things you 

1024
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:46,670
don't know?
Or analogously?

1025
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:50,810
How can people tell stories that contain
information that they don't understand?

1026
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:54,470
And the answer is the information is 
coded in our behavior.

1027
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,080
Okay,
so we'll go back to a chimpanzee troop.

1028
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,890
All the chimpanzees in the troop,
no,

1029
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:05,950
the dominance hierarchy structure,
but if you take a chimpanzee out from 

1030
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:08,720
the truth and say,
what's the dominant structure?

1031
00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:12,410
The chimpanzee is gonna do whatever it 
chimpanzee does.

1032
00:53:12,411 --> 00:53:17,411
It's not going to have a little 
conversation with you about the nature 

1033
00:53:17,411 --> 00:53:21,251
of the dominance hierarchy so it can act
out its knowledge and it might even be 

1034
00:53:21,251 --> 00:53:25,841
able to represent it as an image,
but it can't articulate it.

1035
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,530
Well,
why would we be any different?

1036
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:32,220
We aren't obviously because we're more 
complex than we understand,

1037
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:37,640
so the fact that we're more complex than
we understand means that we contain 

1038
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,200
information that we cannot articulate.
Why can't that reveal itself?

1039
00:53:40,201 --> 00:53:42,960
It does all the time.
You have a revelation.

1040
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:44,420
It's,
Aha,

1041
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,410
I get it.
Well,

1042
00:53:46,411 --> 00:53:47,890
what is that?
It's you.

1043
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:52,940
Maybe you're in psychotherapy and we 
talk about some things about your past 

1044
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:52,940
and we say,
well,

1045
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:52,940
this happened.

1046
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:53,430
Then this happened.
Then this happened.

1047
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,240
I said,
look,

1048
00:53:54,241 --> 00:53:57,120
there's a pattern whap,
and it's overwhelming.

1049
00:53:57,121 --> 00:54:02,121
It's like now there's a concordance 
between your knowledge and the things 

1050
00:54:02,121 --> 00:54:03,420
that you're acting out,
and that's what comes as a revelation.

1051
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,420
So one of the things that happens in 
exodus,

1052
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:08,470
Moses is leading his people through the 
desert,

1053
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:11,700
classic u shaped story.
They're in a tyranny to begin with,

1054
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:13,110
right?
So that's the.

1055
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:16,140
That's the insufficient present.
That's the old order.

1056
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:19,320
And then they crossed the water,
the destructive water.

1057
00:54:19,321 --> 00:54:20,670
That's chaos.
Like the flood.

1058
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:24,000
Then they're out in the desert wandering
without direction.

1059
00:54:24,001 --> 00:54:27,210
They start worshiping idols,
they're wandering without direction,

1060
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:32,940
and then Moses goes up on the mountain,
which is by the way,

1061
00:54:32,941 --> 00:54:37,941
what happens in Logan,
just because if you're going to go see 

1062
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:37,941
it,
you might as well know that because it's

1063
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:42,071
a journey up the mountain.
He goes up the mountain and he gets 

1064
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:42,420
rules revealed to him.

1065
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:47,900
Well,
the way the story is structured is 

1066
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,551
stored nearly interesting because Moses 
takes this people away from this tier 

1067
00:54:49,771 --> 00:54:54,771
Annette tyrannical structure,
but they don't go from tyranny to 

1068
00:54:54,771 --> 00:54:56,880
paradise to the promised land in one 
move.

1069
00:54:56,881 --> 00:55:01,881
That isn't how it works.
They have to go from a tyranny to 

1070
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:04,701
absolute chaos where everyone is 
fighting and killing each other and 

1071
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:08,240
having a terrible time of it and half 
starving and and having to pass through 

1072
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:12,891
the Red Sea like it's.
They go from tyranny to catastrophe 

1073
00:55:12,891 --> 00:55:16,820
before they go to higher order,
and Moses doesn't even make it to the 

1074
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:18,990
place of higher order.
If he dies before he gets there,

1075
00:55:18,991 --> 00:55:23,991
so it's,
it's quite the catastrophe and the 

1076
00:55:23,991 --> 00:55:26,031
Israelites are all confused when they're
out in the desert because even though 

1077
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:26,031
they were in a tyranny and they were 
slaves,

1078
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,900
now they're nowhere and they don't know 
anything.

1079
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:32,900
It's not good.
And so a lot of them actually start 

1080
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,541
thinking about how good the damn tyranny
was compared to wandering around in the 

1081
00:55:35,541 --> 00:55:39,831
desert,
which is exactly what happened to the 

1082
00:55:39,831 --> 00:55:42,200
Soviet Union in Russia.
Now there's huge nostalgia for the 

1083
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,500
Stalinist era.
So these stories,

1084
00:55:43,501 --> 00:55:45,960
they are always true.
They're always happening.

1085
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:51,470
So anyways,
what happens to Moses is that the story 

1086
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:53,280
is quite interesting.
So the Israelites start to fight amongst

1087
00:55:53,281 --> 00:55:58,281
themselves,
which of course they do because there's 

1088
00:55:58,281 --> 00:56:00,560
no higher order authority.
And so then Moses sits and judges the 

1089
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:05,840
like literally like a judge,
he sits for hours everyday and the 

1090
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,630
squabbling Israelites come up and say,
you know,

1091
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:08,940
he did this to me.
I know you did this to me,

1092
00:56:08,941 --> 00:56:12,270
and so then Moses has to figure out 
who's right and who's wrong.

1093
00:56:12,271 --> 00:56:17,271
And he's doing this for like hours and 
hours for days and days for weeks and 

1094
00:56:17,271 --> 00:56:17,280
weeks for months.

1095
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:19,650
It's like the origin of English common 
law.

1096
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:25,250
It's exactly what happened with common 
law because in common law what happens 

1097
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:26,230
is that you have all the rights.
There are,

1098
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,260
if you to have a dispute,
you go before the judiciary,

1099
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,570
you sort out the dispute.
That becomes a precedent.

1100
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:36,580
Now that's part of the body of laws.
The body of laws is what you act out.

1101
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:38,320
That's why it's a body.
Well,

1102
00:56:38,321 --> 00:56:42,520
that's what Moses does.
So he's sitting there making judgments,

1103
00:56:42,521 --> 00:56:44,560
very,
very finely tuned,

1104
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:49,890
discreet moral judgements.
You know how difficult that is when two 

1105
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:51,460
people have a dispute to try to figure 
out how to mediate between that,

1106
00:56:51,461 --> 00:56:53,740
you don't know who's lying,
who's telling the truth.

1107
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,740
You don't know exactly what an 
acceptable solution would be like.

1108
00:56:56,741 --> 00:57:01,741
It's really ridiculously hard work.
So he walks through this entire process 

1109
00:57:01,741 --> 00:57:06,661
of continual judicial intermediation.
Then he goes up the mountain and what 

1110
00:57:06,661 --> 00:57:06,690
does he get?

1111
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:08,530
Tablet of rules.
Well,

1112
00:57:08,531 --> 00:57:09,880
why?
Well,

1113
00:57:09,881 --> 00:57:14,881
he spent his 10,000
hours investigating the structure of 

1114
00:57:15,251 --> 00:57:18,610
morality in a practical way and it goes,
Bang,

1115
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,390
this is what we've been doing.
These are the rules.

1116
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:27,480
It's not like there's no rules to begin 
with and those are opposed because that 

1117
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,500
wouldn't work.
It doesn't work that way.

1118
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:35,310
You have to take how people are,
extract out what the pattern of what 

1119
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:37,630
they are is reflect that back to them.
Well,

1120
00:57:37,631 --> 00:57:39,610
that's,
that's the story of Moses and it's,

1121
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:40,780
it's,
it's a myth.

1122
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:44,680
It's a metal story.
It's a story about how rules come to be.

1123
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,070
We act a certain way.
We have certain kinds of expectations.

1124
00:57:48,071 --> 00:57:50,230
We have certain kinds of disputes out of
that,

1125
00:57:50,231 --> 00:57:53,740
a pattern,
a pattern way of being emerges.

1126
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:56,140
Then we map the pattern way of being.
We say,

1127
00:57:56,141 --> 00:57:57,190
well look,
here's the rules.

1128
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,090
There's 10 of them or however many you 
want to extract.

1129
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:02,020
Right?
I mean it's,

1130
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:05,200
it's a moving target in some sense.
Don't kill other people.

1131
00:58:05,201 --> 00:58:08,470
That's a bad idea,
don't steal what other people have,

1132
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,310
honor your parents,
etc.

1133
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:11,530
Etc.
I mEan these are.

1134
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:14,740
You could come up with a different basic
set of rules,

1135
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:17,770
but there'd be some overlap and those 
aren't bad to begin with.

1136
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:20,650
There were far more rules than that,
but those were the central ones.

1137
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,380
And so then you mIght say,
hey,

1138
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:28,800
if you took all 10 of those rules and 
you tried to extract out one rule from 

1139
00:58:28,811 --> 00:58:33,811
them,
that would be at the top of the 

1140
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:33,811
hierarchy,
what would that be?

1141
00:58:33,811 --> 00:58:36,490
And in western culture,
the idea there is that do unto others as

1142
00:58:36,491 --> 00:58:40,600
you would have them do unto you is the 
rule that it's the mega rule that guides

1143
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:42,660
all other rules,
sort of like the one ring in the,

1144
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:44,110
in the lord of the rings.

1145
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:49,000
And so it's this consistent pattern of 
abstraction of ethical guidelines.

1146
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:53,680
So okaY,
so well and so that maps onto,

1147
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:55,420
well there's a,
there's a micro,

1148
00:58:55,450 --> 00:59:00,450
there's a micro level that you instruct 
people at and that then there's a more 

1149
00:59:00,911 --> 00:59:05,911
abstract level that you instruct them 
out and then there's a more abstract 

1150
00:59:05,911 --> 00:59:09,121
level while maybe at that point you 
can't exactly directly instruct them 

1151
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:11,270
your number in the pinocchio story.
Japan,

1152
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:16,340
oh,
sits pennock or the cricket gemini sits 

1153
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:19,620
pinocchio down and tries to lecture to 
him about what the highest level of 

1154
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:22,310
moral virtue is.
A sounds like a complete fraud.

1155
00:59:22,311 --> 00:59:27,311
He sounds like a propaganda artist.
He's a soapbox preacher and pinocchio 

1156
00:59:27,311 --> 00:59:31,820
doesn't understand them at all.
why has to be acted out now?

1157
00:59:31,821 --> 00:59:34,820
Maybe as a parent you can be a model for
emulation,

1158
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,550
which is so you're a mortal for 
imitation.

1159
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:42,700
What you say matters,
but it doesn't say as much matter as 

1160
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:42,700
much as what you do.

1161
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:45,020
Maybe it would if what you said and what
you did were the same.

1162
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,000
That's the ideal situation,
right?

1163
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:49,100
That's what you want to do.
If you're a parent,

1164
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:51,440
if you say one thing and act 
differently,

1165
00:59:51,441 --> 00:59:56,441
your kids will torture you to death and 
they're right to do it too because 

1166
00:59:56,441 --> 01:00:00,311
you're confused and confusing them,
makes them anxious and aggressive and 

1167
01:00:00,311 --> 01:00:00,890
they will go after you.
consistency,

1168
01:00:00,891 --> 01:00:02,360
consistency,
consistency.

1169
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:05,120
And if you can't provide it,
he will drive them crazy.

1170
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:06,250
So you,
you,

1171
01:00:06,251 --> 01:00:09,410
you want to bring your words and your 
actions into alignment.

1172
01:00:09,830 --> 01:00:14,830
Right?
And that's part of the development of 

1173
01:00:14,830 --> 01:00:14,830
wisdom.
So.

1174
01:00:14,830 --> 01:00:15,530
Okay,
so back to the brain.

1175
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:22,200
All right,
so there's,

1176
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:27,240
there's the motor homunculus.
So now what I want to tell you about 

1177
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,240
that is you just think about what this 
thing is like.

1178
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:33,440
It's taking the world apart and it's 
talking about it.

1179
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:36,440
So that's what a human being is like.
And that,

1180
01:00:36,441 --> 01:00:39,080
to me that's kind of an image of the 
mythological hero.

1181
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:42,890
It's the thing that can speak magic 
words and take the world's apart.

1182
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:48,130
Take the world apart.
Now in one of the stories I'm going to 

1183
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:49,100
tell you today,
which is the story of the enuma elish,

1184
01:00:49,101 --> 01:00:51,260
which is the oldest written story that 
we have.

1185
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:56,620
It's a mesopotamian story and it's from 
the same pool of stories that the 

1186
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:58,670
creation account in genesis was 
extracted.

1187
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,980
It isn't obvious what the temporal 
sequence was,

1188
01:01:00,981 --> 01:01:05,981
but imagine there was a pool of stories 
in the middle east that were of 

1189
01:01:05,981 --> 01:01:09,070
indefinite age,
tens of thousands of years and in needs 

1190
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:10,670
of the more developed in a slightly 
different way.

1191
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:13,040
Although the themes underneath were 
similar.

1192
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:18,400
There are great parallels between the 
mesopotamian creation account and the 

1193
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,340
first part of the creation account in 
genesis,

1194
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:24,700
so it was discovered in the late 19 
hundreds and isis just destroyed a huge 

1195
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:29,810
treasure trove of that sort of 
manuscripts.

1196
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,660
So just so you know,
so at nineveh,

1197
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:37,990
so we can.
We can thank the war in the middle east 

1198
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:40,751
for the destruction of a huge,
a huge treasure house of irreplaceable 

1199
01:01:40,751 --> 01:01:45,671
human knowledge.
And a lot of that's happening that's 

1200
01:01:45,671 --> 01:01:45,671
happening very,
very frequently.

1201
01:01:45,671 --> 01:01:48,560
It's an absolute bloody disgraceful 
catastrophe.

1202
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:53,240
So anyway,
so you know that that's the human being.

1203
01:01:53,241 --> 01:01:54,050
Lips,
tongues,

1204
01:01:54,051 --> 01:01:55,670
hands,
and the face.

1205
01:01:55,671 --> 01:02:00,671
Your face is also extraordinarily 
amenable to voluntary manipulation,

1206
01:02:01,761 --> 01:02:06,140
so you can learn to move single neurons 
in the tissue underneath your eyes.

1207
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:11,530
That's how that's how high resolution 
your faces and that's partly because 

1208
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:14,980
it's a broadcast screed,
which is why people are always looking 

1209
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:14,980
at it.

1210
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:15,380
RighT,
and that's why if you watch a movie,

1211
01:02:15,381 --> 01:02:20,381
it's always concentrating on people's 
faces because they're just broadcasting 

1212
01:02:20,381 --> 01:02:24,290
what they're broadcasting their stories 
constantly and we're looking at their 

1213
01:02:25,171 --> 01:02:26,700
faces.
What are you looking at?

1214
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:28,500
What are your eyes pointing at?
What are you up to?

1215
01:02:28,501 --> 01:02:30,750
What's your emotional expression?
What are you going to do next?

1216
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:35,751
What do you think about me?
Where are you going and you're brought 

1217
01:02:35,751 --> 01:02:37,590
like you find someone who has had too 
much plastic surgery.

1218
01:02:37,591 --> 01:02:42,591
Uncanny because their face is dead 
because you cannot tell what they're up 

1219
01:02:42,591 --> 01:02:43,820
to there they've got.
This is all and be like aspect.

1220
01:02:43,821 --> 01:02:46,500
It's terrifying and people like that.
Look,

1221
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:51,530
people like that got killed.
That's why we're not like that or they 

1222
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:55,491
didn't meet.
It's like you want to know what that 

1223
01:02:55,491 --> 01:02:55,491
other person is up to,
and I told you already.

1224
01:02:55,491 --> 01:02:55,950
That's how the whites of our eyes 
evolved,

1225
01:02:55,951 --> 01:02:56,190
right?

1226
01:02:56,780 --> 01:03:01,780
I don't you remember that story.
Gorillas don't have that distinction 

1227
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:05,211
between the irs and the whites.
Not like human beings and our eyes are 

1228
01:03:05,211 --> 01:03:08,421
very sharp and one thing we really want 
to know is what are you looking at and 

1229
01:03:08,421 --> 01:03:09,240
why?
What are you up to?

1230
01:03:09,241 --> 01:03:10,740
And if I can tell what you're looking 
at,

1231
01:03:10,741 --> 01:03:15,741
I can infer what you're going to do and 
you want to broadcast that well,

1232
01:03:15,751 --> 01:03:17,670
except when you don't want to broadcast 
it,

1233
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:22,700
but you know,
most of the time you want to be pretty 

1234
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:25,131
transparent to other people because 
otherwise they won't trust you and if 

1235
01:03:25,131 --> 01:03:25,290
they don't trust you,
they won't cooperate with you,

1236
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:30,500
they won't compete with you.
And the probability that they'll come 

1237
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,991
after you is extraordinarily high 
because you'll be evil predator in no 

1238
01:03:32,991 --> 01:03:34,350
time flat.
So,

1239
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:40,220
okAy,
so we'll take a look at the brain from 

1240
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:42,330
another perspective.

1241
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:49,100
Now,
a lot of this I got from alcoa conan 

1242
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:49,100
goldberg,
um,

1243
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:50,730
well,
that's not exactly right.

1244
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,010
I had laid up,
laid this out before that,

1245
01:03:53,011 --> 01:03:58,011
but I found out and goldberg's readings 
afterwards and he was a student of 

1246
01:03:58,011 --> 01:04:00,420
lyricists and he was trying to account 
for the y.

1247
01:04:00,421 --> 01:04:05,421
We had different hemispheres roughly 
speaking because it's not self evident 

1248
01:04:05,421 --> 01:04:09,021
that we should.
They're actually somewhat separate 

1249
01:04:09,021 --> 01:04:09,570
consciousnesses and they they,
they communicate,

1250
01:04:09,571 --> 01:04:14,571
but the communication isn't complete.
It's like our brain is modularized and 

1251
01:04:14,571 --> 01:04:18,210
unified at the same time and you can 
think about it like a meeting of people.

1252
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:23,660
Why do you want it mod your mod 
muellerized while so if one person goes 

1253
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:23,910
down,
all of them don't.

1254
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,740
That's one one reason.
So at some separation of function,

1255
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:30,540
why else?
Well,

1256
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:36,230
each little module can do its own 
creative thing independently of the 

1257
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:39,810
others and that's useful and then there 
can be communication between them and so

1258
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:45,440
there's,
there's utility in modularity and 

1259
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,991
there's utility and integration and part
of what we're trying to work out on the 

1260
01:04:47,991 --> 01:04:51,171
global political scene right now is how 
modular things should be and how 

1261
01:04:51,171 --> 01:04:54,531
integrated they should be,
and the erp and the community rushed 

1262
01:04:54,531 --> 01:04:57,771
into integration and that's bothering 
people dreadfully because they feel that

1263
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:01,230
the advantages of modularization have 
been washed away.

1264
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:06,530
You saw that and maybe they're right 
because you saw what happened when 

1265
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:06,530
Greece collapsed,
right?

1266
01:05:06,530 --> 01:05:07,830
And Greece is very,
very corrupt,

1267
01:05:07,831 --> 01:05:09,600
incredibly corrupt.
and Germany,

1268
01:05:09,601 --> 01:05:12,270
whatever else you might think about 
Germany is not corrupt,

1269
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:16,980
and so the eec tried to bring Greece and
Germany together.

1270
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:19,360
That didn't work.
There was no unity there.

1271
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:23,830
The modularity was actually useful and 
the fact that Greece was so destabilized

1272
01:05:23,831 --> 01:05:27,610
and Italy also very corrupt and Spain 
also very corrupt,

1273
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,640
was very shaky just about brought the 
whole thing down.

1274
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:35,780
It it.
The argument is the modularity would 

1275
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:36,190
have been better conserved.
Well,

1276
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:36,940
who knows,
right?

1277
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:39,760
Because modularity is useful and so it's
integration,

1278
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:43,840
but full integration seems to be a 
mistake and sodas,

1279
01:05:43,841 --> 01:05:45,460
full modularity.
How do you get that?

1280
01:05:45,461 --> 01:05:46,870
Right?
We don't know.

1281
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:49,990
That's why we're arguing about it and 
right now there's a backlash.

1282
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:54,130
We're pulling away from the integration 
and you you can see why too,

1283
01:05:54,131 --> 01:05:57,160
because in 2008 when the american 
economy collapsed,

1284
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:59,200
the world economy just about collapsed.

1285
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:01,640
That seems like a bad idea.
You know,

1286
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:05,500
you might want some,
some separate nest so that if one system

1287
01:06:05,501 --> 01:06:10,501
malfunctions and goes down,
the whole bloody thing doesn't go into 

1288
01:06:10,501 --> 01:06:11,110
flames.
And so we don't know.

1289
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:13,270
We don't know how to manage that.
It's a really,

1290
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:17,590
really complicated problem,
so anyways.

1291
01:06:17,591 --> 01:06:18,460
Okay,
so how did the,

1292
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:20,380
how does the brain work?
Well,

1293
01:06:20,381 --> 01:06:25,381
the left roughly speaking in 
right-handed males and the reason that 

1294
01:06:25,381 --> 01:06:30,211
I'm concentrating on right handed males 
is because there are simpler in their 

1295
01:06:30,211 --> 01:06:34,141
neurological structure.
Women have a more complicated 

1296
01:06:34,141 --> 01:06:36,901
neurological structure and lefthanded 
people tend to have a more complicated 

1297
01:06:36,901 --> 01:06:40,681
neurological structure,
so we'll just say that we'll just go 

1298
01:06:40,681 --> 01:06:43,960
with the standard model to begin with 
and you can assume that the same systems

1299
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:49,440
are there in every person,
but they're not laid out on the 

1300
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:49,660
hemispheric structure quite as neatly,
but they're still there,

1301
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:52,240
so it's sort of like these are 
tendencies.

1302
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:54,550
So for example,
if you're a.

1303
01:06:55,210 --> 01:07:00,210
So there's a tendency for the right 
hemisphere to specialize for what's 

1304
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:03,271
relatively unknown and the left 
hemisphere to specialize for what's 

1305
01:07:03,271 --> 01:07:05,980
relatively mastered and you can think 
about it this way too,

1306
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:10,860
left,
right?

1307
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:14,010
It's something like that.
Okay,

1308
01:07:14,310 --> 01:07:14,640
so

1309
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:20,470
large scale,
low resolution abstractions tend to be 

1310
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:20,600
the province of the right high 
resolution,

1311
01:07:20,601 --> 01:07:23,540
detailed knowledge structures tend to be
the province of the left.

1312
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:28,750
The left is linguistic.
That's where the detailed structures 

1313
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:28,750
manifest themselves.
In articulation,

1314
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:33,350
but the fundamental difference between 
the left and right isn't language versus

1315
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:39,530
non language.
The fundamental distinction is 

1316
01:07:39,530 --> 01:07:42,350
relatively explored and mastered versus 
relatively unexplored and not mastered,

1317
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:46,280
and that's both in terms of structure.
The right hemisphere has a less granular

1318
01:07:46,281 --> 01:07:48,350
structure.
It's less differentiated.

1319
01:07:48,650 --> 01:07:51,050
It's also responsible mostly for 
negative emotion,

1320
01:07:51,051 --> 01:07:54,080
especially in the prefrontal part,
and the reason for that is,

1321
01:07:54,290 --> 01:07:59,290
well,
how do you encounter what's absolutely 

1322
01:07:59,290 --> 01:07:59,840
unknown?
Imagination and emotion,

1323
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:05,260
right?
I told you that little experiment that 

1324
01:08:05,260 --> 01:08:06,890
you could do if you're alone in a house 
and you hear a strange noise at night in

1325
01:08:06,891 --> 01:08:09,320
a room,
turn off the lights and put your hand in

1326
01:08:09,321 --> 01:08:09,770
the room.

1327
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,710
It's like your brain will just flash off
monsters like mad.

1328
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,740
You know?
You'll be nervous because that what's in

1329
01:08:15,741 --> 01:08:18,080
that room,
something to make you nervous.

1330
01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:20,390
That's a very low resolution category,
right?

1331
01:08:20,391 --> 01:08:25,391
It's like it's a.
It's some indeterminant manifestation of

1332
01:08:25,581 --> 01:08:27,560
the category of things that might hurt 
you.

1333
01:08:27,950 --> 01:08:30,440
Very low resolution,
but a very smart category.

1334
01:08:30,441 --> 01:08:31,760
It's like,
don't put your hand in there.

1335
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:34,040
You put your hand in there and you watch
your imagination.

1336
01:08:34,041 --> 01:08:39,041
It's like monsters.
It'll generate monsters like matt and 

1337
01:08:39,041 --> 01:08:39,041
that's what the right hemisphere is 
doing.

1338
01:08:39,041 --> 01:08:43,571
It's saying what's in there is an 
exemplar of the category of things that 

1339
01:08:43,571 --> 01:08:45,140
are dangerous.
Here's a bunch of images of those things

1340
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:48,710
and that thing in there is going to 
partake of that essence.

1341
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:51,890
That's a and that's a very low 
resolution hypothesis.

1342
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:54,200
That's kind of what horror movies do 
with people.

1343
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:54,500
You know.

1344
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:58,820
They sort of lead them through that 
initial process and so and so.

1345
01:08:58,821 --> 01:09:03,821
That's what the right way.
The right hemisphere seems to me to be 

1346
01:09:03,821 --> 01:09:06,521
dominated by dominated by subcortical 
processes was the left hemisphere is 

1347
01:09:06,521 --> 01:09:11,351
reversed.
The cortex is more or less got dominion 

1348
01:09:11,351 --> 01:09:14,410
and so the right hemisphere,
well we'll walk through this 

1349
01:09:14,410 --> 01:09:17,531
neurologically,
but the right hemisphere is responds 

1350
01:09:17,531 --> 01:09:20,630
rapidly to what's unknown and that's 
subcortical is the hippocampus,

1351
01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:25,670
is is doing an awful lot of that.
Noting a mismatch and then it's using 

1352
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:29,951
the right hemisphere to to abstractly 
represent what the possibility space is 

1353
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:37,030
in relationship to unexpected things and
then the right hemisphere is tracking 

1354
01:09:37,161 --> 01:09:42,161
that continually.
What those unexpected things are and 

1355
01:09:42,161 --> 01:09:44,741
coming up with models of what you 
haven't yet mastered and that's kept 

1356
01:09:44,841 --> 01:09:49,841
separate from the left hemisphere,
which already has functional models and 

1357
01:09:49,841 --> 01:09:53,711
you don't want to blast the left 
hemisphere continually with the 

1358
01:09:53,711 --> 01:09:56,340
normalist information because you blow 
out its structure and then you don't 

1359
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:56,340
know what to do.

1360
01:09:56,340 --> 01:10:00,640
So the right hemisphere generates new 
models in some sense out of nothing,

1361
01:10:01,970 --> 01:10:06,970
and then when the time is right,
taps information into the left 

1362
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:08,930
hemisphere slowly so that it doesn't 
disrupt its function too much and that's

1363
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:12,320
a lot of that seems to happen when 
you're dreaming by the way it happens at

1364
01:10:12,321 --> 01:10:14,840
night.
So and what happens with the dreams.

1365
01:10:14,841 --> 01:10:19,841
You think about how dreams work as you 
might think of dreams as part of that 

1366
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:22,670
process where ideas come to be so 
they're low resolution to begin with,

1367
01:10:22,671 --> 01:10:27,671
mostly a majestic,
really highly emotional and incoherent 

1368
01:10:27,671 --> 01:10:31,460
less coherent.
Why you can't be coherent less.

1369
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:32,810
You know what to do,
a,

1370
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:33,440
b,
c,

1371
01:10:33,441 --> 01:10:34,010
d,
e,

1372
01:10:34,011 --> 01:10:36,260
f if that's working,
you've got coherence.

1373
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:38,270
But if you're dealing with something you
don't know,

1374
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:40,760
you have to muck about with your 
category structures.

1375
01:10:41,180 --> 01:10:43,460
And that's what dreams do,
and you know,

1376
01:10:43,461 --> 01:10:48,461
when you're interpreting a dream,
one of the things you watch for is the 

1377
01:10:48,461 --> 01:10:48,461
dream.

1378
01:10:48,461 --> 01:10:49,070
The dream presents this.
And then this.

1379
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:50,690
That's called metonymy.
By the way,

1380
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:54,290
from a literary perspective.
And what that implies is this is related

1381
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:57,500
to this in some way.
Why else would they be co activated?

1382
01:10:58,220 --> 01:10:58,970
You know,
people sAy,

1383
01:10:58,971 --> 01:11:00,020
well,
dreams are random.

1384
01:11:00,021 --> 01:11:01,820
That's the stupidest theory I've ever 
heard.

1385
01:11:01,821 --> 01:11:05,330
Like white noise is random.
Dreams are not random.

1386
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:08,840
They're hard to understand,
but they're anything but random.

1387
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:11,840
They're more random than real life.
Well,

1388
01:11:11,841 --> 01:11:16,650
that's because what you don't understand
these really random and you're organized

1389
01:11:16,651 --> 01:11:21,651
and there has to be an intermediary that
sort of quasi random between the more 

1390
01:11:21,651 --> 01:11:23,090
you'll never get from one to the other,
and dreams,

1391
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:24,570
fantasies,
myths,

1392
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:29,571
all of that is part of that process that
it stretches you out beyond what you 

1393
01:11:29,571 --> 01:11:32,490
know into the absolute unknown.
And so,

1394
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:37,920
and you're hemispheres are 
differentially specialized for that.

1395
01:11:37,921 --> 01:11:42,921
So roughly speaking,
right hemisphere operation and 

1396
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:49,551
unexplored territory,
that's a really good way of thinking 

1397
01:11:49,551 --> 01:11:49,551
about it.

1398
01:11:49,551 --> 01:11:50,610
You need a system that tells you what to
do when you don't know what to do.

1399
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:55,970
A huge part of the subcortical 
structures of doing that to unknown 

1400
01:11:55,970 --> 01:11:56,280
freeze.
Then what?

1401
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:59,640
Imagine right,
freeze emotion.

1402
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:03,060
Imagine then explore,
then differentiate,

1403
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:05,700
then master.
That's the process.

1404
01:12:05,701 --> 01:12:08,580
That's the process of learning and what 
you're doing is you're.

1405
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:13,700
You're transforming low resolution 
representations of what's frightening 

1406
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:16,860
into high resolution representations 
that enabled you to master it,

1407
01:12:16,950 --> 01:12:20,760
to take the world park and to make 
ingenious things out of it.

1408
01:12:20,761 --> 01:12:25,761
So there's this very cool part of the 
mesopotamian creation myths so that the 

1409
01:12:25,761 --> 01:12:29,250
major hero whose name is martech,
confronts the dragon of chaos.

1410
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:34,310
Tiamat who's feminine,
and he cuts her into paces and he makes 

1411
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:36,000
the world out of her pieces and one of 
his names,

1412
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:36,990
there's,
he had 50,

1413
01:12:36,991 --> 01:12:41,991
60 names and I think that was,
those were amalgams of tribal gods and 

1414
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:47,180
one of the names was he who makes 
ingenious things out of the conflict 

1415
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:47,180
with taya matt.

1416
01:12:47,180 --> 01:12:50,490
It's absolutely perfect.
That's exactly what human beings do,

1417
01:12:50,690 --> 01:12:55,690
right?
We confront that terrible predatory 

1418
01:12:55,690 --> 01:12:59,690
potential that lies outside our domain 
of experience and we make ingenious 

1419
01:12:59,690 --> 01:13:04,281
things out of it and then we talk about 
how we did it and then we model how we 

1420
01:13:04,281 --> 01:13:08,241
did it,
and that's the basis of our ethics and 

1421
01:13:08,241 --> 01:13:08,241
our morality and the way that that ties 
into think about.

1422
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:13,400
One of the things we talked about was 
that the mythological hero was a 

1423
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:16,251
representation,
not of the being that was at the top of 

1424
01:13:16,251 --> 01:13:19,431
the dominance hierarchy,
but of the being that was at the top of 

1425
01:13:19,431 --> 01:13:19,500
the set of all possible dominance 
hierarchies.

1426
01:13:19,770 --> 01:13:21,390
Okay,
so here's the cool equation.

1427
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:27,350
The hero who goes out into the unknown 
to who make contact with the dragon and 

1428
01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:31,461
to bring back the treasurer is the same 
thing that wins the battle across sets 

1429
01:13:31,461 --> 01:13:34,020
of dominance hierarchies and that's how 
the two things come together.

1430
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:36,060
Right?
It's so brilliant.

1431
01:13:36,061 --> 01:13:39,750
It's so absolutely brilliant,
and so it's the mythological hero.

1432
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:43,020
Mythological hero is the representation 
of what's,

1433
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:48,230
again,
not at the top of one dominance 

1434
01:13:48,230 --> 01:13:48,230
hierarchy,
but at the top of all of them.

1435
01:13:48,230 --> 01:13:49,740
That's the eye that's above the pyramid.
Why the eye?

1436
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:52,860
Because it pays attention and that's 
what you do.

1437
01:13:53,170 --> 01:13:56,250
Like none of this is.
This is not fiction,

1438
01:13:56,970 --> 01:13:59,250
it's method truth.
It's a right way to think about it.

1439
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:02,790
Look,
let's say you're socially anxious.

1440
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:08,300
Okay?
So what happens when you're socially 

1441
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:08,300
anxious?

1442
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:09,690
You go to a party,
your heart's beating.

1443
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:12,850
Why the party is a monster.
Why?

1444
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:15,430
Because it's judging you and it's 
judging you.

1445
01:14:15,490 --> 01:14:18,970
It's putting you low down the dominance 
hierarchy because that's what a negative

1446
01:14:18,971 --> 01:14:22,750
judgment is and that interferes with 
your sexual success.

1447
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:27,370
And that means that you're being harshly
evaluated by nature itself,

1448
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:32,820
right?
So you are confronting the dragon of 

1449
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:32,950
chaos when you go into the social 
situation.

1450
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:35,500
And so what do you do?
You like this,

1451
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:37,930
right?
You hunch over and that's low dominance.

1452
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:39,520
I'm no threat.
It's like whoa,

1453
01:14:39,521 --> 01:14:41,440
that's not going to get you very far,
you know,

1454
01:14:41,441 --> 01:14:43,370
but that's a logical thing to do.
And in the,

1455
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:46,540
in the face of a tyrant.
So I'm no threat.

1456
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:48,400
You know,
you look at the king and your dad,

1457
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:52,630
I'm no threat and hunched over.
And then what's happening internally,

1458
01:14:52,750 --> 01:14:54,220
howard,
what are people thinking about me?

1459
01:14:54,220 --> 01:14:56,860
What are people thinking about me or am 
I looking stupid?

1460
01:14:57,010 --> 01:14:58,210
Am I looking foolish?
Geez,

1461
01:14:58,211 --> 01:14:59,410
I'm awkward.
I hate being here,

1462
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:00,520
man.
I'm sweating too much.

1463
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:02,890
It's all internalized,
right?

1464
01:15:02,891 --> 01:15:06,940
It's all self focused.
The isn't work.

1465
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:10,090
the eye isn't working.
What do you tell people?

1466
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:15,780
Stop.
Don't stop thinking about yourself 

1467
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:16,060
because you can't.
It's like,

1468
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:18,550
don't think of a white elephant,
white elephant,

1469
01:15:18,551 --> 01:15:19,210
white elephant,
white,

1470
01:15:19,211 --> 01:15:24,211
elephant.
You can't tell someone to stop thinking 

1471
01:15:24,211 --> 01:15:24,211
about something because they get caught 
in the loop.

1472
01:15:24,211 --> 01:15:26,260
What you do with socially anxious people
as you say,

1473
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,860
look at other people.
Look at them.

1474
01:15:30,370 --> 01:15:31,600
Right?
Why?

1475
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:36,960
Because if you look at them,
you can tell what they're thinking and 

1476
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:36,960
then you.
Unless you're.

1477
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:38,800
Unless you're terribly socialized and 
some people are,

1478
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:43,950
some people have no social skills and so
the reason they can't go to a party is 

1479
01:15:43,950 --> 01:15:44,560
because they don't even know how to 
introduce themselves.

1480
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:48,550
Like they're just no one ever taught 
them how to behave and so they're really

1481
01:15:48,551 --> 01:15:53,551
good candidates for behavior therapy 
because you walk them through the 

1482
01:15:53,551 --> 01:15:58,321
process of how you actually manifest the
procedures that are associated with 

1483
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:01,720
social acceptability,
but most people aren't like that.

1484
01:16:01,721 --> 01:16:05,020
They have the ability,
so if they're really introverted in high

1485
01:16:05,021 --> 01:16:10,021
in neuroticism,
they can usuaLly talk quite well to 

1486
01:16:10,021 --> 01:16:10,021
someone one on one.
Why?

1487
01:16:10,021 --> 01:16:12,130
Because they looked at them on.
If I look at you,

1488
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:17,340
it's another thing to do.
If you're ever speaking to a group of 

1489
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:17,820
people,
never speak to the group of people there

1490
01:16:17,821 --> 01:16:22,821
that doesn't exist.
You talk to individuals and then they 

1491
01:16:22,821 --> 01:16:25,990
reflect for you the entire group because
they're all in trained.

1492
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:31,300
You look At one person,
they broadcast what everyone's thinking 

1493
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,040
and you know how to talk to one person,
so it's easy.

1494
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:37,610
So as soon as you focus on the person,
not you,

1495
01:16:37,790 --> 01:16:39,580
you push your attention outward.

1496
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:44,580
Use your.
I push your attention outward and you 

1497
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:46,921
start watching.
Well then all your automatic mechanisms 

1498
01:16:46,921 --> 01:16:48,460
kick in and you start being awkward 
because if we're talking and I'm looking

1499
01:16:48,461 --> 01:16:53,461
here,
I don't know what you're going to do 

1500
01:16:53,461 --> 01:16:55,060
next and I'm going to put disjunctions 
into the like,

1501
01:16:55,090 --> 01:16:58,060
they're like a bad chords and the melody
of our,

1502
01:16:58,390 --> 01:17:03,390
of our conversation,
and the reason is I'm not paying 

1503
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:06,421
attention,
so that's why the I is the thing at the 

1504
01:17:06,421 --> 01:17:09,301
top of the pyramid,
it's like the thing that enables you to 

1505
01:17:09,301 --> 01:17:11,630
win the set of all possible dominance 
hierarchies is the I pay attention.

1506
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:14,150
Pay attention.
That's the critical issue.

1507
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:16,730
That's why the egyptians worshiped 
horace.

1508
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:19,970
That's why horace was the thing that 
rescued osiris from the.

1509
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:22,700
From the depths.
it's the capacity to pay attention.

1510
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:24,470
What do you pay attention to?
Most?

1511
01:17:25,670 --> 01:17:30,670
What?
Your right hemisphere signals as 

1512
01:17:30,670 --> 01:17:30,670
anomalous.

1513
01:17:30,670 --> 01:17:31,490
It attracts your attention.
It's like this isn't going quite right.

1514
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:36,950
I'm not looking at that wrong.
That's what you look at.

1515
01:17:37,190 --> 01:17:39,620
That's what you look at.
What's not going right,

1516
01:17:39,621 --> 01:17:40,700
because that's.
See,

1517
01:17:40,701 --> 01:17:42,680
that's the terrible monster that might 
eat you,

1518
01:17:42,681 --> 01:17:45,170
but it's also the place you get all the 
information,

1519
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:50,860
so that's why it's useful to have 
discussions with your enemies because 

1520
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:55,451
they will tell you things you do not 
know and that's such a great thing 

1521
01:17:55,451 --> 01:17:56,840
because if you don't know them well,
you're not very smart,

1522
01:17:56,841 --> 01:17:58,040
are you?
You know,

1523
01:17:58,041 --> 01:17:59,600
there may be a time when you go 
somewhere,

1524
01:17:59,770 --> 01:18:04,770
that's the thing you need to know and 
maybe your enemy will tell you why 

1525
01:18:04,770 --> 01:18:06,500
you're such a fool,
a bunch of other things that aren't true

1526
01:18:06,501 --> 01:18:09,920
to,
but even one thing that's accurate,

1527
01:18:09,921 --> 01:18:10,460
it's like,
yeah,

1528
01:18:10,461 --> 01:18:15,461
thanks very much man.
Maybe I'll do Some work on that and I 

1529
01:18:15,461 --> 01:18:15,530
won't have to carry that forward.
So.

1530
01:18:15,531 --> 01:18:18,950
And then that's part of the reason again
why the terrible predator.

1531
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:21,380
It's always the terrible predator that 
has the gold.

1532
01:18:21,381 --> 01:18:24,290
It's like it's the person who delivers 
the message you do not want to hear.

1533
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,540
So it's rough,
it's rough,

1534
01:18:26,930 --> 01:18:29,180
but it doesn't matter.
Life is rough.

1535
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:33,260
Okay,
so how are these specialized?

1536
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:39,360
The right hemisphere operation and 
unexplored territory and that unexplored

1537
01:18:39,361 --> 01:18:43,260
territory emerges whenever what you're 
doing doesn't work.

1538
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:48,830
You know,
you can conceptualize it as that which 

1539
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:51,321
is beyond the walls of the city,
but the city is a category structure 

1540
01:18:51,321 --> 01:18:53,220
abstractly,
abstractly,

1541
01:18:53,670 --> 01:18:58,670
but there's no difference between the 
barbarians that invade the world's city 

1542
01:18:59,370 --> 01:19:04,370
and the things that happened in the 
world that damaged your category 

1543
01:19:04,370 --> 01:19:04,600
structure there.
They're the same thing from a,

1544
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:06,000
from a practical perspective,

1545
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:16,260
okay?
Right hemisphere operation and 

1546
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:16,260
unexplored territory,
negative emotion,

1547
01:19:16,260 --> 01:19:18,460
inhibition of behavior.
That's this.

1548
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:23,670
That's anxiety.
That's what happens when the medusa 

1549
01:19:23,670 --> 01:19:23,670
looks at you.
You turned to stone,

1550
01:19:23,670 --> 01:19:24,700
right?
That's the basilisk in Harry Potter.

1551
01:19:24,850 --> 01:19:26,470
It freezes you.
Why?

1552
01:19:26,890 --> 01:19:29,140
You're moving forward according to a 
schema.

1553
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:34,590
If you're moving fruit forward,
property you're getting to where you 

1554
01:19:34,590 --> 01:19:37,681
want to go,
and the schema is being validated 

1555
01:19:37,681 --> 01:19:39,691
simultaneously.
I'm moving forward and the map is 

1556
01:19:39,691 --> 01:19:40,150
correct.
Something happens that's unexpected.

1557
01:19:40,151 --> 01:19:42,430
What should you do?
Stop.

1558
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:45,550
What else are you going to do?
He stopped first.

1559
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:47,920
Then the predator can't see you,
right?

1560
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:50,350
That's the freezing reaction of a prey 
animal,

1561
01:19:50,770 --> 01:19:51,640
so it's.
It's,

1562
01:19:51,690 --> 01:19:53,140
it's,
it's built very,

1563
01:19:53,141 --> 01:19:55,720
very deeply into very,
very old circuits.

1564
01:19:55,721 --> 01:20:00,721
Do that fact,
if it's a real orienting reflects to 

1565
01:20:00,721 --> 01:20:03,481
something that's normal,
she'll go like this and that's to stop 

1566
01:20:03,481 --> 01:20:04,870
the thing that will jump on your back 
from carrying out your throat and that's

1567
01:20:04,871 --> 01:20:06,010
really,
really fast.

1568
01:20:06,011 --> 01:20:11,011
It's almost as fast spinal snake 
reflects circuitry extraordinarily fast 

1569
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:15,030
and that you know that's conserved over 
and evolutionary span.

1570
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:20,480
That predator defense system is at the 
bottom of your cognitive apparatus.

1571
01:20:20,521 --> 01:20:21,960
Everything's been built on that.

1572
01:20:25,160 --> 01:20:28,790
It's a low resolution pattern,
a higher resolution pattern.

1573
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,190
That's the same pattern is built on top 
of that.

1574
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:36,460
Then a higher resolution pattern.
That's the same pattern is built on top 

1575
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:40,121
of that and so on,
but that initial architecture is 

1576
01:20:40,121 --> 01:20:43,601
duplicated across the levels of 
differentiation of the nervous system 

1577
01:20:43,601 --> 01:20:45,920
and that's partly why these symbols can 
be so archaic and still be accurate.

1578
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:49,610
it's still the way the world works.
negative emotion,

1579
01:20:49,611 --> 01:20:51,830
inhibition of behavior,
image processing,

1580
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:54,890
right?
Because image hang about images is there

1581
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:56,660
fast,
you know,

1582
01:20:56,780 --> 01:20:59,300
a picture is worth a thousand words.
Okay.

1583
01:20:59,301 --> 01:21:00,970
You get the picture,
you know,

1584
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:03,530
get the picture is actually something 
you say to someone.

1585
01:21:03,531 --> 01:21:05,210
If you say,
do you understand?

1586
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:07,190
Right?
To get the picture is very,

1587
01:21:07,191 --> 01:21:09,680
very fast.
So the right hemisphere managers,

1588
01:21:09,681 --> 01:21:13,190
that holistic thinking,
that's that low resolution thinking that

1589
01:21:13,191 --> 01:21:16,160
generalizes across instances,
pattern recognition,

1590
01:21:16,161 --> 01:21:18,710
pattern generation and gross motor 
action.

1591
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:22,010
Yeah,
freeze and get the hell out of there.

1592
01:21:22,011 --> 01:21:27,011
That's gross motor action.
The right hemisphere is very good at 

1593
01:21:27,011 --> 01:21:27,590
that.
That's why if you're right handed,

1594
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:30,340
use your.
If you're right handed,

1595
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:35,420
you use your left hemisphere to manage 
the really fine motor details,

1596
01:21:35,421 --> 01:21:36,500
right?
You write with it,

1597
01:21:36,950 --> 01:21:39,200
you write with it,
and because that's very,

1598
01:21:39,201 --> 01:21:39,590
very.

1599
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:47,200
If you're right handed,
you tend to use your left hand to open 

1600
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:47,540
the top of jars,
right?

1601
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,730
You use your left hand.
That's a gross motor action.

1602
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:51,980
I mean sometimes people are more 
lateralized than not,

1603
01:21:52,310 --> 01:21:54,950
but the left hemisphere specialized for 
the fine grain.

1604
01:21:54,951 --> 01:21:57,680
Things that you know very well.
that's exactly yet.

1605
01:21:57,980 --> 01:21:59,270
okay.
The left hemisphere,

1606
01:21:59,690 --> 01:22:04,690
well the left hemisphere,
which is associated with positive 

1607
01:22:04,690 --> 01:22:07,901
emotion by the way,
that's specialized for operation 

1608
01:22:07,901 --> 01:22:11,610
unexplored territory.
So now what we might say is that you 

1609
01:22:11,610 --> 01:22:12,230
spend your whole life trying not to have
the right hemisphere turn on

1610
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:17,310
because why would you want that?
That's where the monsters pop up.

1611
01:22:17,550 --> 01:22:22,550
So you stay in explored territory,
but maybe you also tentatively expand 

1612
01:22:22,591 --> 01:22:25,860
its borders and the left hemisphere 
seems to be involved in that too.

1613
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:30,990
So if you're curious about something,
it's usually something usually something

1614
01:22:30,991 --> 01:22:34,560
minor enough so that it won't blow your 
entire category structure if you explore

1615
01:22:34,561 --> 01:22:35,040
it.
Now,

1616
01:22:35,041 --> 01:22:37,260
sometimes you get unlucky and you're 
like,

1617
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:42,590
eve in the garden of eden,
you go have a little chat with this 

1618
01:22:42,590 --> 01:22:45,480
little snake that seems to be of no 
significance whatsoever,

1619
01:22:45,481 --> 01:22:47,880
and it feeds you something.
The apple,

1620
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:51,330
it feeds you something and bang,
everything falls apart,

1621
01:22:51,390 --> 01:22:52,820
right?
You claps and you're,

1622
01:22:52,850 --> 01:22:56,100
you're out there in history.
You're no longer in your old paradise.

1623
01:22:56,700 --> 01:23:00,150
So activation of behavior.
Yeah,

1624
01:23:00,151 --> 01:23:03,810
well that's because positive emotion is 
associated with movement forward.

1625
01:23:03,811 --> 01:23:07,450
like if you're where you want to be and 
things are going well,

1626
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:10,630
then your behavior should be activated 
so that you go and get things.

1627
01:23:10,631 --> 01:23:13,480
Now,
one of the negative consequences of that

1628
01:23:13,481 --> 01:23:16,420
is that if you're really in a good mood,
really happy,

1629
01:23:16,421 --> 01:23:21,421
you're going to be impulsive and make 
mistakes because you hear these dough 

1630
01:23:21,421 --> 01:23:22,510
headed.
that's a very minor word.

1631
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:28,140
people who are always pushing happiness 
as the as the key measure for for 

1632
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:29,530
successful existence.
It's so

1633
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:35,550
ill informed that it's embarrassing that
that even happens.

1634
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:39,900
Positive emotion makes people impulsive.
Maniacs for example,

1635
01:23:39,990 --> 01:23:41,920
which is really if that's mania,
right?

1636
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:44,490
Bipolar disorder.
If you're manic,

1637
01:23:44,491 --> 01:23:47,580
you're one happy person,
way too happy.

1638
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:52,760
Everything is great.
Nothing but wonderful things that are 

1639
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:56,331
beyond your imagination.
You are going to happen to you and 

1640
01:23:56,331 --> 01:23:59,241
they're going to happen fast and so 
you're down to the mall to buy 

1641
01:23:59,241 --> 01:24:02,451
everything you can possibly get your 
hands on because you have 100 uses for 

1642
01:24:02,451 --> 01:24:06,441
everything and then a week later,
you know you crash into your depressive 

1643
01:24:06,441 --> 01:24:09,630
episode and you realize that you're 
$150,000

1644
01:24:09,631 --> 01:24:11,910
in debt and you've alienated everyone 
that you know.

1645
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:14,130
It's like that's untrammeled positive 
emotion.

1646
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:15,780
So how about no,

1647
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:21,670
you're the appear index of positive 
emotion is no way of determining whether

1648
01:24:21,671 --> 01:24:24,400
or not a system is working properly.
Even your own system,

1649
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:27,340
you need a balance between positive and 
negative emotions.

1650
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:32,700
Plus positive emotions are absolutely 
exhausting because if you're in a manic 

1651
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:37,501
episode,
it's like it's time to get everything 

1652
01:24:37,501 --> 01:24:37,501
good right now,
fine,

1653
01:24:37,501 --> 01:24:40,120
but you won't sleep for a week and then 
you die because you just burned yourself

1654
01:24:40,121 --> 01:24:45,121
to a crisp and so to be overwhelmingly 
enthusiastic about everything sounds 

1655
01:24:46,001 --> 01:24:51,001
like a real blast and I've seen full 
blown mannix and they're having plenty 

1656
01:24:51,001 --> 01:24:54,181
of fun,
but it is not a pleasant thing to 

1657
01:24:54,181 --> 01:24:56,470
behold.
They're just all over the place and you 

1658
01:24:56,470 --> 01:24:56,830
know,
yeah,

1659
01:24:57,010 --> 01:24:59,470
it's really not good.
It's really not good.

1660
01:24:59,471 --> 01:25:04,471
You need a balance between these two 
systems because the whole world isn't 

1661
01:25:04,471 --> 01:25:07,540
explored territory bursting with nothing
but promise.

1662
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:09,130
That's not the world.

1663
01:25:09,670 --> 01:25:14,670
The world is that the bounded space a 
little bit without absolute horror show 

1664
01:25:15,371 --> 01:25:20,371
going out around the periphery and both 
of your both systems need to be active 

1665
01:25:21,070 --> 01:25:26,070
in order to keep you balanced.
People do unfortunately sustain damage 

1666
01:25:26,070 --> 01:25:30,901
sometimes to the left Prefrontal cortex 
responsible for positive emotion or the 

1667
01:25:30,901 --> 01:25:33,220
right prefrontal cortex responsible for 
negative emotion,

1668
01:25:33,610 --> 01:25:36,190
and if you sustain right hemisphere 
prefontal damage,

1669
01:25:36,191 --> 01:25:41,191
it makes you inappropriately happy and 
impulsive and your and your life just 

1670
01:25:41,191 --> 01:25:44,941
goes.
You just spiraled downhill because you 

1671
01:25:44,941 --> 01:25:47,791
make nothing but impulsive decisionS and
you know what the world world 

1672
01:25:47,791 --> 01:25:51,511
consequence of that is.
you know you get drunk and be impulsive 

1673
01:25:51,511 --> 01:25:55,591
for one night.
You can learn what the bloody 

1674
01:25:55,591 --> 01:25:57,331
consequences of that are.
You try living like that for a month 

1675
01:25:57,331 --> 01:26:00,840
independently of iq.
That's the other thing that's so 

1676
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:04,111
interesting.
You can blow out your left prefrontal 

1677
01:26:04,111 --> 01:26:05,900
cortex and not much of a decrease,
especially in crystallized intelligence,

1678
01:26:06,350 --> 01:26:09,320
but the fact that you're running on 
nothing but sorry,

1679
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:14,380
your right hemisphere,
you're running on nothing but positive 

1680
01:26:14,380 --> 01:26:14,630
emotion is going to argue.
You write it into the ground and then if

1681
01:26:14,631 --> 01:26:19,631
you're perhaps even more unlucky and you
lose the left prefrontal cortex,

1682
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:24,800
then you're permanently depressed 
because there's nothing but

1683
01:26:27,470 --> 01:26:31,340
the unexplored manifesting itself.
We know that if you take depressive,

1684
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:34,400
depressed people and you do eeg 
analysis,

1685
01:26:34,401 --> 01:26:37,310
that they have predominant lifting,
predominant,

1686
01:26:37,340 --> 01:26:41,750
resting right hemisphere eeg activation,
and so,

1687
01:26:43,220 --> 01:26:48,220
so that's roughly.
So why is this well unknown territory 

1688
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:49,460
known territory you think,
well,

1689
01:26:49,461 --> 01:26:50,750
is that real?
Well,

1690
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:52,880
it's real enough.
So that's how your brain evolved.

1691
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:56,210
That seems pretty damn real.
So then we can think about it.

1692
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:58,730
Sub cortically and we might as well do 
that.

1693
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:02,840
This is mapped out on the hippocampus 
more,

1694
01:27:02,870 --> 01:27:07,870
most particularly by Jeffrey gray who is
influenced by soul glove and vinegar,

1695
01:27:08,391 --> 01:27:10,070
dover,
who were also students have luria,

1696
01:27:10,520 --> 01:27:15,520
Jeffrey Gray used cybernetic theory that
was developed by norbert wiener and 

1697
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:17,600
which has an ai,
uh,

1698
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:20,480
which he was the father Of artificial 
intelligence.

1699
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:25,960
And some of that was actually integrated
as well into peer jetty and thought 

1700
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:27,740
because piaget and white wiener,
norbert,

1701
01:27:27,741 --> 01:27:30,350
wiener and luria,
if I remember correctly,

1702
01:27:30,351 --> 01:27:34,100
all went to the same conference back in 
the early 19 twenties,

1703
01:27:34,430 --> 01:27:36,650
mid 19 twenties and heard norbert wiener
speak.

1704
01:27:36,890 --> 01:27:41,890
So that's how cybernetic theory got 
built into some of these underlying 

1705
01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:43,310
theories and sort of manifested itself 
everywhere.

1706
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:48,380
So gray gray uses a model very much like
this derived from cybernetic theory,

1707
01:27:48,381 --> 01:27:50,540
and so here's the idea,
how does the brain work?

1708
01:27:50,990 --> 01:27:52,250
You have a target in mind

1709
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:59,000
and you aCt too to manifest the target,
you act to transform the world into the 

1710
01:27:59,101 --> 01:28:04,101
target and then you compare the 
consequences of your actions to the 

1711
01:28:04,101 --> 01:28:04,101
target.
And if they match,

1712
01:28:04,101 --> 01:28:05,700
then that's a good thing.
And if they don't match,

1713
01:28:05,701 --> 01:28:07,770
then that's what they were negative 
emotion comes from.

1714
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:09,210
Okay,
so how does that work?

1715
01:28:09,270 --> 01:28:11,310
The hippocampus seems to be central to 
that.

1716
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,710
So it detects mismatch.
So.

1717
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:16,770
So in the classic behavioral theory,
no.

1718
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:21,240
So this would be Grazed theory.
You have your expectations of the world.

1719
01:28:21,270 --> 01:28:24,750
So that would be your model and you have
your sensor input,

1720
01:28:24,751 --> 01:28:29,751
which iS the real world.
And then the hippocampus is mapping one 

1721
01:28:29,751 --> 01:28:31,400
onto the other,
one from a top downstream,

1722
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:34,260
one from a bottom uPstream and saying 
match,

1723
01:28:34,290 --> 01:28:35,130
match,
match,

1724
01:28:35,131 --> 01:28:37,230
match,
and as long as everything matches,

1725
01:28:37,231 --> 01:28:40,080
then the hippocampus.
This is an oversimplification,

1726
01:28:40,350 --> 01:28:45,350
keeps the subcortical emotional systems 
inhibiteD because you don't need them 

1727
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:49,380
except for maybe my mild positive 
emotion to keep you moving forward.

1728
01:28:49,740 --> 01:28:54,740
If there's a mismatch that's anxiety,
the anxiety system gets disinhibited 

1729
01:28:55,090 --> 01:28:56,810
because it's on.
It doesn't get activated,

1730
01:28:56,820 --> 01:28:58,740
gets disinhibited,
that freezes you,

1731
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:00,960
and all the other motivational systems 
are prime.

1732
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,360
God only knows what you're going to have
to do next.

1733
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:07,470
Okay,
so then if you make a mistake,

1734
01:29:07,530 --> 01:29:10,320
given that scheme,
you have to modify the world in order to

1735
01:29:10,321 --> 01:29:13,410
rectify the mistake.
You have to modify your motor outputs so

1736
01:29:13,411 --> 01:29:17,070
that you put the world back in order,
and that's basically grays model,

1737
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:22,700
but gray model is insufficient because 
gray presumes that what you're comparing

1738
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:27,030
your expectation with is the real world,

1739
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:30,420
but you don't have access to the real 
world.

1740
01:29:30,421 --> 01:29:35,421
What really happens is that your brain 
compares the model of the world that you

1741
01:29:35,941 --> 01:29:37,770
want to have happen,
so it's desired,

1742
01:29:37,790 --> 01:29:42,120
not expected with the model of the world
that you think is happening.

1743
01:29:42,190 --> 01:29:47,190
There are both models.
There's no direct contact with the 

1744
01:29:47,190 --> 01:29:47,970
truth,
and so what that means,

1745
01:29:47,971 --> 01:29:52,080
and this is what's horrible about this,
is that if your model fails,

1746
01:29:52,081 --> 01:29:57,081
it doesn't only mean that you have to 
adjust your expectation and change your 

1747
01:29:57,081 --> 01:30:01,461
motor activity.
It means you might have to bloody well 

1748
01:30:01,461 --> 01:30:04,131
retool your perceptions well,
that's a lot more horrifying than just 

1749
01:30:04,131 --> 01:30:06,360
having to change your motor output.
If you will be trained me,

1750
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:10,930
then I have to see you differently and 
you know I've.

1751
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:15,020
If we've interacted a long time,
I've built up a hell of a model of you.

1752
01:30:15,050 --> 01:30:17,130
You know,
it's taken a tremendous amount of effort

1753
01:30:17,131 --> 01:30:22,131
to generate and I may have used that 
model as a predicate for all sorts of 

1754
01:30:22,131 --> 01:30:26,241
other plants,
which is what you do with an intimate 

1755
01:30:26,241 --> 01:30:28,851
relationship.
And so then if you do something that 

1756
01:30:28,851 --> 01:30:31,940
indicates our true mismatch,
it isn't only that I have to adjust my 

1757
01:30:31,940 --> 01:30:34,350
actions.
God only knows what I'm going to have to

1758
01:30:34,351 --> 01:30:36,990
retool.
I may even have to retool my perceptions

1759
01:30:36,991 --> 01:30:39,750
of myself.
I'm a lot more gullible than I thought I

1760
01:30:39,751 --> 01:30:40,740
was,
for example,

1761
01:30:40,860 --> 01:30:43,440
and god only knows what the implications
of that are.

1762
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:48,600
If you,
if you're close to me And you could do 

1763
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:48,600
this to me,

1764
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:53,110
is that my flaw and environment?
Am I carrying that into other 

1765
01:30:53,110 --> 01:30:54,710
relationships?
It's an absolute catastrophe and so gray

1766
01:30:54,711 --> 01:30:59,711
actually underestimated the degree of 
severity of mismatch because he only 

1767
01:30:59,711 --> 01:30:59,711
said,
well,

1768
01:30:59,711 --> 01:31:04,460
it was motor output and and and re and 
re world adjusting.

1769
01:31:04,461 --> 01:31:09,461
That would have to be repaired.
Not perception because like most 

1770
01:31:09,461 --> 01:31:12,671
behavior,
see the behaviors had this idea of 

1771
01:31:12,671 --> 01:31:12,671
stimulus,
right?

1772
01:31:12,671 --> 01:31:13,910
The stimulus produces the response.
It's like,

1773
01:31:13,911 --> 01:31:16,130
okay,
what stimulus?

1774
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:17,390
Well,
they never went there.

1775
01:31:17,660 --> 01:31:20,270
They just assumed that the stimulus 
spoke for itself,

1776
01:31:20,450 --> 01:31:25,450
but it doesn't.
That's the fundamental weakness of 

1777
01:31:25,450 --> 01:31:27,881
behavioral theory is that the reason 
they could get rid of the mind was 

1778
01:31:27,881 --> 01:31:29,780
because they hid it invisibly inside the
idea of the stimulus,

1779
01:31:29,781 --> 01:31:32,690
which is all of a sudden,
not just something that was a sense,

1780
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:36,860
like a piece of sense data,
but that had motivation built into it.

1781
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:37,970
Well,
no,

1782
01:31:38,690 --> 01:31:42,260
you know you can't do tHat.
The motivation.

1783
01:31:42,590 --> 01:31:45,620
You can put the motivation into object,
but then it's no longer an object.

1784
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:50,230
It's something completely different.
Okay,

1785
01:31:50,350 --> 01:31:51,580
good.
Let's stop there.

1786
01:31:51,581 --> 01:31:56,581
When you come back,
I'm going to tell you a bunch of 

1787
01:31:56,581 --> 01:31:56,581
stories.
Okay,

1788
01:31:56,581 --> 01:31:58,990
so we'll break for 15 minutes.
So imagine what happens.

1789
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:00,010
The civilization

1790
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:04,420
develops and develops out of an amalgam 
of tribal organizations,

1791
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:08,200
and so each of those tribes has their 
own god,

1792
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:11,980
which has their own sort of imaginative 
universe and their attempt to make sense

1793
01:32:11,981 --> 01:32:16,981
out of the moral landscape of being and 
underneath all of those representations 

1794
01:32:17,831 --> 01:32:22,831
is a pattern and the reason there's a 
pattern there is because all of those 

1795
01:32:22,831 --> 01:32:24,490
tribes are made up of people and so 
there's going to be.

1796
01:32:24,491 --> 01:32:27,880
It's like there's a domain within which 
variation is going to occur.

1797
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:32,350
So if we're going to set up a structure 
that works across time,

1798
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:36,670
it's going to at least be roughly 
predicated on the same structures that a

1799
01:32:36,671 --> 01:32:41,671
dominance hierarchy is predicated on.
It's going to be predicated on tHe same 

1800
01:32:41,671 --> 01:32:43,600
patterns of interactions that would 
characterize a chimpanzee troop.

1801
01:32:43,990 --> 01:32:44,460
You know,
there's,

1802
01:32:44,490 --> 01:32:46,270
there's this basic biological,

1803
01:32:48,630 --> 01:32:53,630
what would you call it?
There's a realm of biological necessity 

1804
01:32:53,630 --> 01:32:57,051
that constitutes the boundary space 
within which human interactions that 

1805
01:32:57,051 --> 01:32:57,180
have to take place.
I mean,

1806
01:32:57,330 --> 01:33:01,290
I can't be so violent that I kill 
everyone in my tribe that's not gonna be

1807
01:33:01,291 --> 01:33:03,700
very helpful because I'm in tribal 
creatures,

1808
01:33:03,701 --> 01:33:05,970
so without the tribe,
what am I going to do?

1809
01:33:06,390 --> 01:33:11,390
And so I have to be vaguely acceptable 
to other people because otherwise 

1810
01:33:11,390 --> 01:33:12,990
they'll kill me even if I'm really,
really powerful,

1811
01:33:12,991 --> 01:33:17,991
they'll take me down.
And so because I have to deal with you 

1812
01:33:17,991 --> 01:33:21,771
and you and you and you and you were 
going to modify each other continually 

1813
01:33:21,771 --> 01:33:22,260
and,
and within parameters.

1814
01:33:22,261 --> 01:33:24,780
Now the parameters are wide,
but they're not nonexistent.

1815
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:27,750
And you know,
you can see what those parameters are.

1816
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:31,740
Genuinely if you look at something like 
a wolf pack or a chimpanzee troop,

1817
01:33:31,830 --> 01:33:36,830
because those are stable across really,
the structure itself is stable across at

1818
01:33:38,370 --> 01:33:40,680
least hundreds of thousands of years,
if not millions of years.

1819
01:33:40,920 --> 01:33:42,870
And so there's a,
there's um,

1820
01:33:43,230 --> 01:33:46,060
so frans de waal shows,
for examPle,

1821
01:33:46,061 --> 01:33:47,460
that with the chimpanzee troops,

1822
01:33:49,350 --> 01:33:53,130
if you have a pr,
he studied them mostly at the arnhem zoo

1823
01:33:53,190 --> 01:33:56,160
and I would recommend his writings 
highly diwal d,

1824
01:33:56,161 --> 01:33:58,200
e,
w a l,

1825
01:33:58,540 --> 01:34:03,540
m.
He's interested in the prototypical 

1826
01:34:03,540 --> 01:34:06,651
moral behavior among chimpanzees.
It's a very interesting study and what 

1827
01:34:06,651 --> 01:34:11,331
he's showed for example,
is that if you have a particularly the 

1828
01:34:11,331 --> 01:34:12,840
the dominant dominance hierarchy and 
chimpanzees is male,

1829
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:17,920
a female dominance hierarchy to that 
overlaps the mail and some of the 

1830
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:18,660
females are more dominant than many of 
the males,

1831
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:22,530
but the fundamental structure looks like
it's patriarchal,

1832
01:34:22,531 --> 01:34:26,130
roughly speaking among chimpanzees.
If you put a really rough,

1833
01:34:26,190 --> 01:34:28,380
tough barbaric,
brutal dictator,

1834
01:34:28,381 --> 01:34:30,720
chimpanzee at the top,
his,

1835
01:34:30,810 --> 01:34:35,810
his reign tends to be unstable and 
violent because he isn't good at 

1836
01:34:35,810 --> 01:34:39,390
negotiating social support and so he 
doesn't have any.

1837
01:34:40,020 --> 01:34:44,070
And so that means two chimpanzees that 
are friends can take them out.

1838
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:45,390
And so that's what happens.

1839
01:34:45,630 --> 01:34:50,630
And so the desk bought chimp is an 
unstable leader and they've all shown 

1840
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:55,700
that the more stable chimp leaders are 
more chimpanzee.

1841
01:34:55,701 --> 01:34:59,120
Attarian I guess Would be right word.
It's not humanitarian.

1842
01:34:59,300 --> 01:34:59,910
They,
they,

1843
01:35:00,020 --> 01:35:03,090
they do know they have friends and you 
know,

1844
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:07,580
friendship is predicated on reciprocity 
even among chimpanzees.

1845
01:35:07,940 --> 01:35:12,470
And so if a predicate of power is 
reciprocity,

1846
01:35:12,471 --> 01:35:15,680
then that's one of the things that 
alleviates the dictatorial tendency.

1847
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:18,100
So anyways,
so my,

1848
01:35:18,170 --> 01:35:21,950
my point is when a great civilization 
emerges,

1849
01:35:21,951 --> 01:35:24,200
it emerges from the amalgam of tribal 
groups,

1850
01:35:24,650 --> 01:35:29,650
but,
and each of the tribal groups has their 

1851
01:35:29,650 --> 01:35:29,650
own ethic.
But that ethic is,

1852
01:35:29,650 --> 01:35:31,640
isn't the ethics aren't entirely 
separate from one another.

1853
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:35,120
That's why tribes can trade because they
do trade,

1854
01:35:35,150 --> 01:35:35,750
they,
they,

1855
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:38,450
they interact with one another.
It's kind of half.

1856
01:35:38,860 --> 01:35:42,410
I remember,
here's how here too,

1857
01:35:42,411 --> 01:35:46,640
for separated tribes begin to trade 
because you don't know,

1858
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:51,880
you meet each other,
cross the river and it's like you got 

1859
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:54,620
your bows and arrows and someone makes a
mistake and it's like warfare and so,

1860
01:35:54,950 --> 01:35:58,100
but you don't want to start the damn war
because maybe you'll die.

1861
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:03,100
So you're sitting there with your bow 
and arrows watching these guys and now 

1862
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:05,270
you know they're there and so then you 
go back to your tribe and you think,

1863
01:36:05,271 --> 01:36:10,271
oh man,
what the hell are we going to do about 

1864
01:36:10,271 --> 01:36:10,271
this?
And one solution is,

1865
01:36:10,271 --> 01:36:10,271
well,
let's find out where they are.

1866
01:36:10,271 --> 01:36:11,200
And then we'll go in there at night and 
we'll like,

1867
01:36:11,210 --> 01:36:13,580
we'll kill a bunch of theM are will wipe
them out or something like that.

1868
01:36:13,581 --> 01:36:17,030
Or another solution might be did you see
all the neat stuff they had?

1869
01:36:17,450 --> 01:36:22,450
And so then what do you do is you find a
border area and you go and you put some 

1870
01:36:22,450 --> 01:36:26,150
things out there that are valuable and 
you run away and then you watch from the

1871
01:36:26,151 --> 01:36:31,151
trees and you see what happens when 
these other people discover these 

1872
01:36:31,151 --> 01:36:34,991
valuable things that you left there.
And if they're like little under 

1873
01:36:34,991 --> 01:36:38,710
psychopathic side,
they pick it all up and giggle and run 

1874
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:38,710
away.

1875
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:39,380
And that's the end of that.
But if they have any sense,

1876
01:36:39,650 --> 01:36:44,650
what they do is they leave some cool 
stuff on the ground too and then they 

1877
01:36:44,650 --> 01:36:46,070
run off and then you can go pick up 
their cool stuff and leave.

1878
01:36:46,071 --> 01:36:50,750
And then it's like step one in the trust
process and then maybe you do that,

1879
01:36:50,780 --> 01:36:51,980
you know,
for a year.

1880
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:55,700
And it starts to fall into a cadence.
And then maybe you know,

1881
01:36:55,970 --> 01:36:58,100
you get a little closer when you're 
washing,

1882
01:36:58,130 --> 01:37:03,130
watching in the bush.
And then maybe one day you have enough 

1883
01:37:03,130 --> 01:37:03,130
courage to kind of,
you sending your biggest ugliest guy out

1884
01:37:03,130 --> 01:37:03,920
there.
And you know,

1885
01:37:03,921 --> 01:37:06,980
they do the same and you know,
they look at each other and finally they

1886
01:37:06,981 --> 01:37:11,981
shake hands or something like that and 
trade and then well then you've got a 

1887
01:37:11,981 --> 01:37:14,951
trading relationship established and so 
you can see in that the emergence of a,

1888
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:20,590
what would you call it,
negotiated consensual moral structure 

1889
01:37:20,590 --> 01:37:22,040
that allows trading to take place.

1890
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:25,160
And there's gonna be rules emerge right 
away,

1891
01:37:25,161 --> 01:37:30,161
which is well,
you better leave me something that's of 

1892
01:37:30,161 --> 01:37:32,870
approximately equal value or I'm not 
going to play the game again.

1893
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:36,380
That's the thing that's so cool is that 
if we only play a game once,

1894
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:39,890
I can do whatever I want.
And so that's,

1895
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:44,920
that's what psychopaths do.
They play with game once and then they 

1896
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:45,890
go play with someone else.
But if we're going to play the same game

1897
01:37:45,891 --> 01:37:50,330
over and over and over,
it's like the dominance hierarchy across

1898
01:37:50,331 --> 01:37:55,331
time.
There's a different rule for playing a 

1899
01:37:55,331 --> 01:37:57,821
game once.
Then there is for playing a game a 

1900
01:37:57,821 --> 01:37:57,821
thousand times

1901
01:37:57,821 --> 01:38:00,510
and if we're in a relationship,
the game we want to play is one that can

1902
01:38:00,511 --> 01:38:04,110
be duplicated a thousand times and 
there's really tight constraints on that

1903
01:38:04,111 --> 01:38:08,910
and so that's the origin that you could 
consider that the biological,

1904
01:38:09,180 --> 01:38:12,720
it's not even biological exactly.
It's predicated in biology,

1905
01:38:12,721 --> 01:38:14,970
but it's a consequence of continual 
interaction.

1906
01:38:15,210 --> 01:38:18,240
The ethic emerges.
It's like the rats that I told you about

1907
01:38:18,241 --> 01:38:21,330
that you knoW the,
the rats that play with each other,

1908
01:38:21,331 --> 01:38:24,690
the big roundhouse to let the little rat
win 30 percent of the time or the little

1909
01:38:24,691 --> 01:38:27,570
rat won't play anymore and so because 
the little rat,

1910
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:31,320
that's the biological,
the biological framing,

1911
01:38:31,321 --> 01:38:33,870
the limitation is the little rat doesn't
want to lose all the time.

1912
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:37,050
That just produces negative emotion.
It's not fun.

1913
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:42,080
It's not motivating.
So why would the little rat go play 

1914
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:42,080
again?
So the,

1915
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:46,551
the,
the constraints on our interactions are 

1916
01:38:46,551 --> 01:38:49,251
our biological constraints and they 
manifest themselves in a patterned way 

1917
01:38:49,251 --> 01:38:53,181
across time and there isn't any 
difference between you and me 

1918
01:38:53,181 --> 01:38:53,181
interacting across time.

1919
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:57,900
Then there is between you and me acting 
say in the next hour or so with everyone

1920
01:38:57,901 --> 01:38:59,820
in this room,
it's the same thing.

1921
01:38:59,940 --> 01:39:03,150
It's just continual human interactions 
and the ethic emerges from that.

1922
01:39:03,630 --> 01:39:07,080
Now different groups are going to code 
that ethic differently,

1923
01:39:07,081 --> 01:39:08,880
so they're going to come up with 
different images,

1924
01:39:08,881 --> 01:39:11,430
stick representations,
and different stories.

1925
01:39:12,330 --> 01:39:17,330
Now,
one of the things they're trying to 

1926
01:39:17,330 --> 01:39:17,330
figure out is,
well,

1927
01:39:17,330 --> 01:39:18,570
let's do,
let's do it in the tribal way.

1928
01:39:18,990 --> 01:39:23,990
You have to do this inside the tribe to 
you have 100 people and 10 of them are 

1929
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:29,340
leaders in one way or another,
and then out of that 10,

1930
01:39:29,341 --> 01:39:29,760
you think,
well,

1931
01:39:29,761 --> 01:39:33,870
who's the who's the best person?
So you have to have a hierarchy of value

1932
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:37,140
to determine what the most important 
aspect of the ethic is,

1933
01:39:37,470 --> 01:39:42,470
and it's going to be something like 
trust because that's the predicate for 

1934
01:39:42,470 --> 01:39:42,470
continued interaction.

1935
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:44,880
Trustworthiness,
it's not any real,

1936
01:39:44,950 --> 01:39:47,040
really,
really any different than honesty.

1937
01:39:47,370 --> 01:39:49,410
It's not really any different from 
telling the truth.

1938
01:39:49,830 --> 01:39:54,830
So there's a really powerful necessity 
for honesty to emerge as a,

1939
01:39:55,770 --> 01:39:58,410
as a canonical value carrying might 
emerge,

1940
01:39:59,310 --> 01:40:02,280
um,
power might emerge,

1941
01:40:02,310 --> 01:40:04,890
right?
The ability to exert physical power,

1942
01:40:04,891 --> 01:40:07,410
especially in places where war is a 
continual,

1943
01:40:07,890 --> 01:40:09,570
uh,
is continually likely.

1944
01:40:09,571 --> 01:40:14,571
And in lots of tribal landscapes,
it's just nonstop tribal trade in 

1945
01:40:14,571 --> 01:40:14,850
warfare.
So,

1946
01:40:15,090 --> 01:40:20,090
but,
but you can see how different ethics 

1947
01:40:20,090 --> 01:40:20,090
would eMerge as,
as canonical depending to some degree on

1948
01:40:20,090 --> 01:40:24,801
the situation.
But trust is a really crucial one 

1949
01:40:24,801 --> 01:40:24,801
because without that there's no 
relationships.

1950
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:30,380
Okay,
so you've got tribe and it's got its 

1951
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:30,380
tribal gods and its and its traditions 
and all of that.

1952
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:35,010
It's representation of the,
of being in its images and stories.

1953
01:40:35,011 --> 01:40:37,080
And then you've got try b and you've 
tried seeing,

1954
01:40:37,130 --> 01:40:40,290
you've got tribe d and now they're all 
coming together.

1955
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:44,460
So what happens exactly?
Well,

1956
01:40:45,870 --> 01:40:50,630
the tribes can go to war or they can 
talk and we're,

1957
01:40:50,750 --> 01:40:53,530
we're thinking about a communication 
that might be extending across

1958
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:56,260
thousand years.
You have your beliefs.

1959
01:40:56,261 --> 01:40:58,990
I have my beliefs,
I can overwhelm you,

1960
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:04,080
I can subsume you,
but even then I'm likely to get 

1961
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:04,690
indigestion from doing it.
It's very,

1962
01:41:04,691 --> 01:41:09,691
very difficult to wipe out a set of 
beliefs without wiping out all of the 

1963
01:41:09,691 --> 01:41:12,490
people and that kind of nullifies the 
utility of unification.

1964
01:41:13,390 --> 01:41:18,390
The more there are a view,
the better you can defend yourself 

1965
01:41:18,390 --> 01:41:21,190
against other organizations that are 
trying to be larger.

1966
01:41:21,340 --> 01:41:26,340
So there's a powerful self preservation 
impetus to cooperation and so one of the

1967
01:41:27,611 --> 01:41:32,611
things you see happening in the 
development of the stories in the old 

1968
01:41:32,611 --> 01:41:32,611
testament,
for example,

1969
01:41:32,611 --> 01:41:35,590
we know this about genesis in particular
that there were at least this is.

1970
01:41:35,710 --> 01:41:39,250
This is relatively recently,
so say for 3000 years ago,

1971
01:41:39,790 --> 01:41:41,380
not 50,000
years ago.

1972
01:41:41,890 --> 01:41:44,890
There were two different stories.
There's two different stories in,

1973
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:50,070
in the genesis account told by two 
different storytellers and people who 

1974
01:41:50,441 --> 01:41:55,441
are very good at textual analysis of 
being able to separate them and they 

1975
01:41:55,441 --> 01:41:55,450
were put together.

1976
01:41:56,530 --> 01:41:57,940
I don'T remember when.
again,

1977
01:41:57,941 --> 01:42:02,080
it's probably about something between 
2000 and 3000 years ago.

1978
01:42:02,260 --> 01:42:07,260
They were put together by what appeared 
to be a single editor and so he took 

1979
01:42:07,260 --> 01:42:09,730
these disparate accounts and tried to 
organize them into something that looked

1980
01:42:09,731 --> 01:42:14,731
like a logical narrative and that was 
part of the process by which different 

1981
01:42:14,731 --> 01:42:19,410
tribal representations of the world were
brought into something under which the 

1982
01:42:20,021 --> 01:42:25,021
tribes as you as a unit could 
simultaneously exist so you can think 

1983
01:42:25,021 --> 01:42:26,910
about it as a competition between 
images,

1984
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:31,920
stick representations across time,
and then the emergence of some unifying 

1985
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:35,941
narrative that that captures the key 
elements of all of them well enough to 

1986
01:42:35,941 --> 01:42:40,621
bring them into some sort of union and 
it has to be a story with motivational 

1987
01:42:40,621 --> 01:42:45,061
power because otherwise no one will call
it non to it and it has to be a story 

1988
01:42:45,061 --> 01:42:48,640
that keeps uncertainty at bay because 
otherwise it doesn't have any utility.

1989
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:53,760
So it has to be a functional story.
So I'm going to tell you a story like 

1990
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:55,240
that and just the story of marduk and 
it's the mesopotamian story.

1991
01:42:55,690 --> 01:43:00,690
And mesopotamia is one of the earliest 
civilizations and it emerged as a 

1992
01:43:00,690 --> 01:43:03,550
consequence of the amalgam of.
Of middle eastern tribes.

1993
01:43:03,820 --> 01:43:08,820
So the over a very long period of time,
you could thank the gods of all of these

1994
01:43:09,131 --> 01:43:11,830
tribes were worrying in an abstract 
space,

1995
01:43:11,890 --> 01:43:16,890
in a conceptual space,
and that would be the space of 

1996
01:43:16,890 --> 01:43:16,950
argumentation and conflict.
And out of that a,

1997
01:43:17,060 --> 01:43:22,060
a story emerged and this is the medical 
story and it's one of a host of similar 

1998
01:43:22,421 --> 01:43:24,400
medical stories that came out of the 
middle east,

1999
01:43:24,401 --> 01:43:26,650
one of which is the account in genesis.
Okay?

2000
01:43:26,651 --> 01:43:31,651
So here's The story.
So there are two primary day at east to 

2001
01:43:33,401 --> 01:43:37,270
begin with,
app suit and tie I'm at now.

2002
01:43:37,271 --> 01:43:39,730
In order to understand that,
well,

2003
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:43,000
here's how the mesopotamians 
conceptualize the world.

2004
01:43:45,790 --> 01:43:49,870
There was a,
let's call it a disc that salt water.

2005
01:43:50,830 --> 01:43:51,500
Well,
why?

2006
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:57,160
Well,
what happens when you go to the end of 

2007
01:43:57,160 --> 01:43:57,160
the continent?
Salt water everywhere,

2008
01:43:57,160 --> 01:43:57,440
right?
So wherever you go,

2009
01:43:57,650 --> 01:44:02,650
you run into salt water.
So that's the desk that surrounds 

2010
01:44:02,650 --> 01:44:02,650
everything.
Now,

2011
01:44:02,650 --> 01:44:05,390
why Is it a disk?
The world is a dome on a desk.

2012
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:07,610
Why?
Well,

2013
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:09,260
say you're standing in the middle of a 
field.

2014
01:44:09,860 --> 01:44:14,860
What does the world look like?
Dome on a disk.

2015
01:44:16,190 --> 01:44:18,440
So it's a phenomenal logical 
representation.

2016
01:44:19,190 --> 01:44:22,310
So the bottom of the dome is the ground 
on which you stand.

2017
01:44:22,490 --> 01:44:26,810
What happens if you dig deep water,
fresh water.

2018
01:44:27,770 --> 01:44:31,930
So the dome of the land is on a disk of 
fresh water.

2019
01:44:32,540 --> 01:44:34,280
What happens if you go to the edge of 
the land?

2020
01:44:34,340 --> 01:44:39,340
You run into saltwater.
The dome of the land is on a disk of 

2021
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:39,500
fresh water,
on a disk of salt water.

2022
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:42,140
Okay?
Those are the two gods.

2023
01:44:42,380 --> 01:44:47,380
Timeout is god and salt.
Water and absolute has guarded 

2024
01:44:47,380 --> 01:44:50,610
freshwater and it's.
It's happened stamps in some sense 

2025
01:44:50,610 --> 01:44:54,011
because that's the masculine and the 
feminine and they could be attributed 

2026
01:44:54,011 --> 01:44:55,780
all sorts of different geographical 
areas.

2027
01:44:55,781 --> 01:44:56,630
So for example,

2028
01:45:00,350 --> 01:45:02,030
see if I can think of a good example.

2029
01:45:06,410 --> 01:45:08,270
It doesn't matter.
We'll just leave that for now.

2030
01:45:09,510 --> 01:45:09,920
Okay?

2031
01:45:10,540 --> 01:45:12,830
Okay.
So the two primary gods are absent,

2032
01:45:12,831 --> 01:45:17,831
and timeout.
Timeout is female and absolute is male 

2033
01:45:17,831 --> 01:45:21,550
and there are locked together in an 
inseparable embrace.

2034
01:45:22,030 --> 01:45:23,350
Okay?
So how do you understand that?

2035
01:45:23,620 --> 01:45:26,980
Easy yin and yang?
It's the same idea.

2036
01:45:27,130 --> 01:45:28,780
Here is,
here's another representation.

2037
01:45:28,781 --> 01:45:33,781
This is a cool one.
I've got a couple of them here that are 

2038
01:45:33,781 --> 01:45:34,270
really cool.
This is from China,

2039
01:45:36,190 --> 01:45:41,190
so this is.
So this is foxy and new.

2040
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:43,060
I think I've got that right,
but I,

2041
01:45:43,061 --> 01:45:45,700
I just love that reference is so 
insanely cool.

2042
01:45:45,701 --> 01:45:50,701
This representation.
So you see sort of the primary mother 

2043
01:45:51,521 --> 01:45:56,521
and father of humanity emerging from 
this underlying snake like entity with 

2044
01:45:56,521 --> 01:45:59,690
it's tails tangled together.
I think that's a ripper.

2045
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:04,800
I really do believe this,
although it's very complicated to 

2046
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:05,110
explain why I really believe that's a 
representation of dna,

2047
01:46:06,490 --> 01:46:08,980
so and that,
that representation,

2048
01:46:08,981 --> 01:46:12,340
that entwined double helix that is 
everywhere.

2049
01:46:12,550 --> 01:46:17,550
You can see it in our australian 
aboriginal art and I'm using the 

2050
01:46:17,550 --> 01:46:20,911
australians as an example because they 
were isolated in Australia for like 

2051
01:46:20,911 --> 01:46:20,911
50,000
years.

2052
01:46:20,911 --> 01:46:24,160
They're the most archaic people that 
were ever discovered and they have clear

2053
01:46:24,161 --> 01:46:26,830
representations of these double helix 
structures in their art.

2054
01:46:27,310 --> 01:46:29,650
So.
And those are the two giant serpents out

2055
01:46:29,651 --> 01:46:31,960
of which the world is made.
Roughly speaking.

2056
01:46:32,230 --> 01:46:34,750
It's the same thing.
You see that in the staff of asclepius,

2057
01:46:34,751 --> 01:46:37,060
which is the healing symbol that the 
physicians use.

2058
01:46:37,061 --> 01:46:40,060
Although usually that's only one snake,
but sometimes it's too.

2059
01:46:40,450 --> 01:46:41,410
So,
so,

2060
01:46:42,130 --> 01:46:42,880
so that's,
uh,

2061
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:46,000
that's a chinese representation.
And then there's a,

2062
01:46:46,540 --> 01:46:50,190
there's this,
that's the representation.

2063
01:46:51,540 --> 01:46:53,460
We talked about the egyptian story the 
other day,

2064
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:56,490
right?
We talked about isis and those cyrus.

2065
01:46:58,050 --> 01:47:03,050
So there they are cobras.
Their tails are twined together because 

2066
01:47:03,050 --> 01:47:03,050
he,
they emerge out of that.

2067
01:47:03,050 --> 01:47:07,620
That's the dragon of chaos that 
manifests itself as culture in nature.

2068
01:47:07,980 --> 01:47:10,920
That's the representation.
That's unbelievably cool.

2069
01:47:11,550 --> 01:47:13,050
So,
okay,

2070
01:47:13,051 --> 01:47:15,030
so anyways,
back to back to,

2071
01:47:15,031 --> 01:47:17,250
uh,
to the mesopotamian story.

2072
01:47:17,730 --> 01:47:21,510
So absent entire amount or they're 
primordial deities,

2073
01:47:21,930 --> 01:47:25,680
nature and culture there in twined 
together and they give rise to the,

2074
01:47:25,890 --> 01:47:28,890
to the,
to their first category of children.

2075
01:47:29,130 --> 01:47:34,130
and those are the,
I think you could think about them as 

2076
01:47:34,130 --> 01:47:36,660
the elder gods.
Now what do they represent?

2077
01:47:36,661 --> 01:47:41,661
Well,
the question is what did the gods 

2078
01:47:41,661 --> 01:47:43,131
represent and they represent.
They represent sort of like primary 

2079
01:47:43,131 --> 01:47:43,890
modes of being.
It's something like that.

2080
01:47:43,891 --> 01:47:47,430
So think about aries or mars' the god of
war.

2081
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:50,150
Well that's,
that's a representation of single minded

2082
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:55,160
aggression.
And then you can think about error oss 

2083
01:47:55,160 --> 01:47:57,750
or venus,
which is a primary representation of 

2084
01:47:57,750 --> 01:47:57,750
sexuality.
And you might say,

2085
01:47:57,750 --> 01:47:59,340
well why are those deities?
Well,

2086
01:47:59,341 --> 01:48:04,341
that's simple.
They live forever and they control you 

2087
01:48:04,341 --> 01:48:05,340
and their personalities.

2088
01:48:05,820 --> 01:48:08,010
So that's that for that.
It's like,

2089
01:48:08,070 --> 01:48:13,070
yes,
obviously you know and you know that 

2090
01:48:13,070 --> 01:48:13,200
you're under the sway of anger.
You're not in control of yourself.

2091
01:48:13,201 --> 01:48:16,050
If you're under the sway of of erotic 
possession,

2092
01:48:16,051 --> 01:48:21,051
you make a fool out of yourself.
you're a tool of the power that drives 

2093
01:48:21,051 --> 01:48:22,620
the,
the continuation of the species forward.

2094
01:48:22,770 --> 01:48:27,770
Hunger is the same thing.
Any primordial motivational drive we've 

2095
01:48:27,770 --> 01:48:30,330
conceptualized in this class as a 
personality,

2096
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:33,350
but those are transcendent personalities
and their returnal.

2097
01:48:33,450 --> 01:48:36,060
They there forever.
And so that's why the greeks,

2098
01:48:36,061 --> 01:48:41,061
for example,
thought that human beings were just the 

2099
01:48:41,061 --> 01:48:43,190
play things of the gods.
And the idea is echoed in the 

2100
01:48:43,190 --> 01:48:46,011
mesopotamian story.
So then you can think about it sort of 

2101
01:48:46,011 --> 01:48:48,270
neuro developmentally as well,
is that out of out of nothing,

2102
01:48:48,660 --> 01:48:53,660
out of culture and nature emerges.
Say the two year old two year old is a 

2103
01:48:53,660 --> 01:48:57,711
battle ground of primary motivational 
forces and something like that is being 

2104
01:48:57,711 --> 01:49:00,870
hinted at in the mesopotamian creation 
story.

2105
01:49:00,990 --> 01:49:05,990
The first,
the first progeny of the fundamental 

2106
01:49:06,330 --> 01:49:11,330
union of chaos and order app suit and 
tie math is the proliferation of these 

2107
01:49:11,330 --> 01:49:16,280
primary motivational forces.
They're sorta like the titans or the or 

2108
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:16,370
the,
uh,

2109
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:19,160
what did what it was that the greek gods
kept in the,

2110
01:49:20,060 --> 01:49:21,330
in,
underneath the mountain.

2111
01:49:21,331 --> 01:49:24,000
That's zeus.
What's the name of that?

2112
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:27,960
They're like prime.
There are earthquakes and fires and that

2113
01:49:27,961 --> 01:49:30,110
sort of thing.
They're primordial forces.

2114
01:49:30,120 --> 01:49:30,960
Okay.
Anyways,

2115
01:49:31,020 --> 01:49:34,440
so these children are produced and what 
happens?

2116
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:40,280
They're very noisy.
They run around doing all sorts of 

2117
01:49:40,280 --> 01:49:42,231
things.
You could think about them as grown up 

2118
01:49:42,231 --> 01:49:42,231
to year olds causing all sorts of 
trouble.

2119
01:49:42,231 --> 01:49:46,100
The first thing they do is kill appsu 
and make their home on his corpse.

2120
01:49:47,620 --> 01:49:52,620
That's brilliant.
Now the story doesn't say much about 

2121
01:49:52,620 --> 01:49:52,620
aps.
Who?

2122
01:49:52,620 --> 01:49:52,660
Other than that,
the culture,

2123
01:49:52,690 --> 01:49:57,690
daddy,
a prop primary culture data is not 

2124
01:49:57,690 --> 01:49:58,540
elaborated up that much in the 
mesopotamian story.

2125
01:49:58,750 --> 01:50:03,750
And I think that's probably because at 
the time of the mesopotamian 

2126
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:07,591
civilization was new enough so that we 
really hadn't mapped the mythology of 

2127
01:50:08,471 --> 01:50:10,450
culture.
The egyptians did that much more.

2128
01:50:10,451 --> 01:50:13,510
And I know I told you that story first,
but that's just how it goes.

2129
01:50:13,810 --> 01:50:18,810
So the elder gods make their,
their home on the corpse of absolute 

2130
01:50:19,480 --> 01:50:20,440
well,
what does that mean?

2131
01:50:20,860 --> 01:50:21,530
Well,
that's,

2132
01:50:21,650 --> 01:50:25,870
that's sort of how he is.
You inhabit the corpse of culture,

2133
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:28,480
right?
It's the dad passed and,

2134
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:31,630
but,
but it's not just the dead past.

2135
01:50:31,660 --> 01:50:35,680
One of the things that's very cool about
the mesopotamian story is that the elder

2136
01:50:35,681 --> 01:50:39,800
gods are foolish enough to kill it.
It's the death of god by the way.

2137
01:50:39,801 --> 01:50:44,801
It's,
it's no different from what nisha 

2138
01:50:44,801 --> 01:50:44,801
pronounced.
This has been going on for a very,

2139
01:50:44,801 --> 01:50:47,410
very long time.
This collapse of belief systems,

2140
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:53,850
they kill it carelessly because they 
don't understand what it is that they 

2141
01:50:53,850 --> 01:50:54,200
need to survive it,
kill it carelessly,

2142
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:56,590
carelessly,
and then they try to live on the corpse.

2143
01:50:58,780 --> 01:51:00,190
I think that's what the postmodernists 
do,

2144
01:51:00,191 --> 01:51:03,070
by the way,
because they assume we have this,

2145
01:51:03,100 --> 01:51:08,100
this tremendous system of value.
That's been built up across time and it 

2146
01:51:08,261 --> 01:51:13,261
sustains us and everyone is criticizing 
it and criticizing and trying to destroy

2147
01:51:14,291 --> 01:51:19,291
it as well.
We live in it's corpse and that will 

2148
01:51:19,291 --> 01:51:23,850
nourish us forever.
It has to be replenished and there's 

2149
01:51:23,850 --> 01:51:26,410
nothing in the postmodernist philosophy 
that can act to replenish anyways.

2150
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:32,010
They kill app.
So what happens when you kill order?

2151
01:51:33,460 --> 01:51:35,690
Chaos comes back.
Tie a math.

2152
01:51:36,280 --> 01:51:37,450
Now this is time out

2153
01:51:40,710 --> 01:51:41,100
here,

2154
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:43,990
feminine,
but also the dragon.

2155
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:45,310
So it's,
it's,

2156
01:51:45,340 --> 01:51:50,340
it's you think out of this fundamental 
reptilian treasure bearer culture and 

2157
01:51:52,971 --> 01:51:56,380
nature emerge and they can pull back 
into that very rapidly.

2158
01:51:56,381 --> 01:51:58,690
So here's an example.
You've all seen sleeping beauty.

2159
01:51:58,780 --> 01:52:03,780
I presumed the.
How many of you have seen sleeping 

2160
01:52:03,780 --> 01:52:03,780
beauty?
The disney film?

2161
01:52:03,780 --> 01:52:04,090
How many of you haven't?
Okay,

2162
01:52:04,091 --> 01:52:07,810
so there's a couple that habit.
There's a scene in sleeping beauty where

2163
01:52:07,811 --> 01:52:11,650
the evil queen has,
has imprisoned the prince who's going to

2164
01:52:11,651 --> 01:52:14,590
wake sleeping beauty up.
So he's the logos so that he's the,

2165
01:52:14,620 --> 01:52:19,620
he's the heroic individual or he's that 
element of her consciousness that wakes 

2166
01:52:19,620 --> 01:52:19,620
her up.
You can read it either way.

2167
01:52:20,470 --> 01:52:23,440
She's got him trapped in a dungeon.
So she's the kind of ultimate,

2168
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:25,840
ultimate eatable mother,
you know,

2169
01:52:26,110 --> 01:52:30,190
she's the mother that has her 40 year 
old son in the basement who's overweight

2170
01:52:30,191 --> 01:52:35,191
and unhealthy and watch and watching 
video games and being covered with 

2171
01:52:35,191 --> 01:52:36,130
cheeto dust and she always liked feeds 
him sandwiches so we won't leave,

2172
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:36,880
you know.

2173
01:52:36,940 --> 01:52:37,840
And she says,
oh,

2174
01:52:37,841 --> 01:52:42,841
it's good thing you didn't go out in the
world and make some poor woman 

2175
01:52:42,841 --> 01:52:42,841
miserable.
So anyway,

2176
01:52:42,841 --> 01:52:47,261
so that's the evil queen.
He's got the hero trapped in the 

2177
01:52:47,261 --> 01:52:47,261
dungeon.
So he goes out,

2178
01:52:47,261 --> 01:52:51,710
he escapes,
and then she goes after them to try to 

2179
01:52:51,710 --> 01:52:52,520
bring them back and turns into the 
dragon.

2180
01:52:52,550 --> 01:52:55,580
That's what happens in sleeping beauty.
So that's that reversion of the,

2181
01:52:55,820 --> 01:52:58,460
of the arChetype into it's even more 
primordial force.

2182
01:52:58,850 --> 01:53:00,700
so anyway,
so timeout.

2183
01:53:00,710 --> 01:53:05,710
Matt is kind of an amalgam of feminine 
nature and also this more underlying 

2184
01:53:05,710 --> 01:53:06,330
primordial assemble.
So anyway,

2185
01:53:06,331 --> 01:53:09,350
she is not happy.
She is not happy that these,

2186
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:12,410
her children killed her husband.
And so she thinks,

2187
01:53:12,411 --> 01:53:14,570
oh well enough for these creatures.
We're gonna,

2188
01:53:14,780 --> 01:53:16,790
we're gonna do the men.
So flood myth,

2189
01:53:17,060 --> 01:53:20,120
it's the same idea.
So what happens in the story of noah,

2190
01:53:20,121 --> 01:53:23,390
this happens worldwide,
is that human beings get all corrupt and

2191
01:53:23,391 --> 01:53:25,850
make a lot of racket and break all sorts
of rules,

2192
01:53:25,851 --> 01:53:26,840
and god thinks,
oh well,

2193
01:53:26,841 --> 01:53:28,580
you know,
now for you,

2194
01:53:28,640 --> 01:53:30,470
we'll just bring in a flood and wipe it 
all out.

2195
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:34,850
That's chaos returning.
You destabilize order too badly.

2196
01:53:35,390 --> 01:53:40,390
There's a flood and that brings with it 
all sorts of new things because it's 

2197
01:53:40,390 --> 01:53:40,390
water,
but it just drowns you,

2198
01:53:40,820 --> 01:53:45,820
drowns you.
Now noah is a good man so he can ride 

2199
01:53:45,820 --> 01:53:48,641
out the flood.
He's the hero that can go down into the 

2200
01:53:48,641 --> 01:53:51,701
chaos and then back up because he,
he hasn't let go of his morality despite

2201
01:53:52,581 --> 01:53:54,890
the fact that the entire society has 
disintegrated.

2202
01:53:55,220 --> 01:54:00,220
So he sAves everything.
So it's like moses crossing the red sea 

2203
01:54:00,220 --> 01:54:01,130
and then coming out the other side.
Same,

2204
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:04,970
same sort of idea anyways,
so tie amount.

2205
01:54:05,300 --> 01:54:10,300
She's a,
she's not happy and these gods are 

2206
01:54:10,300 --> 01:54:10,300
careless to it.
Impulsive.

2207
01:54:10,300 --> 01:54:12,920
They're making a lot of noise and their 
activity disturbs her.

2208
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:15,680
You know,
when you can see echoes of that fear,

2209
01:54:16,790 --> 01:54:19,730
that mythological fear in modern 
consciousness,

2210
01:54:19,731 --> 01:54:22,100
because we tell ourselves the same 
story,

2211
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:23,270
right?

2212
01:54:23,690 --> 01:54:27,350
The story is if we keep running around 
making enough racket,

2213
01:54:27,650 --> 01:54:30,350
mother nature is going to take offense 
and wipe us out.

2214
01:54:30,380 --> 01:54:35,380
And that's the story that's at the 
bottom of the sort of apocalyptic 

2215
01:54:35,380 --> 01:54:36,140
element of the global warming.
Um,

2216
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:37,660
uh,
uh,

2217
01:54:38,270 --> 01:54:40,340
apocalypse.
It's like if we,

2218
01:54:40,341 --> 01:54:43,040
if we mock about badly enough,
nature will take its revenge.

2219
01:54:43,250 --> 01:54:43,760
Okay,
fine.

2220
01:54:43,761 --> 01:54:44,750
It's true.
It's true.

2221
01:54:44,751 --> 01:54:46,730
It's so,
it's a story that's always been true.

2222
01:54:47,060 --> 01:54:51,020
So anyways,
the gods are making a lot of noise there

2223
01:54:51,021 --> 01:54:54,080
being impulsive and then they make the 
fatal error of killing app suit.

2224
01:54:54,081 --> 01:54:56,090
And that's a big mistake.
And so taya,

2225
01:54:56,110 --> 01:54:57,260
matt,
thanks all right.

2226
01:54:57,261 --> 01:55:00,190
Now for this,
she wakes up and she thinks I'm going to

2227
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:01,310
wipe them all out.
Now the,

2228
01:55:01,340 --> 01:55:02,900
these gods,
they are gods say,

2229
01:55:02,901 --> 01:55:07,470
I mean they're not trivial characters,
but they're pretty worried because there

2230
01:55:07,510 --> 01:55:09,440
are gods but tie.
matt is their mother.

2231
01:55:09,441 --> 01:55:11,480
She gave birth,
she is mother nature.

2232
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:16,340
And if she's angry about it then the 
jigs up.

2233
01:55:16,370 --> 01:55:21,370
And so what time does is she prepares 
this army of monsters and that they're 

2234
01:55:21,370 --> 01:55:21,890
described,
there's,

2235
01:55:21,980 --> 01:55:26,980
I think,
13 different kinds of monsters in their 

2236
01:55:26,980 --> 01:55:26,980
chi,
merrick images,

2237
01:55:26,980 --> 01:55:27,950
they're images of,
you know,

2238
01:55:28,250 --> 01:55:29,570
they're,
they're like dragons,

2239
01:55:29,571 --> 01:55:32,750
they're half snake and half bird,
half animal,

2240
01:55:32,751 --> 01:55:37,751
and they're monstrous images and there's
sort of the mesopotamians attempt to 

2241
01:55:38,180 --> 01:55:41,990
images typically represent those things 
that might come forward as an onslaught.

2242
01:55:42,350 --> 01:55:43,860
And so generates a whole

2243
01:55:44,430 --> 01:55:49,430
13 major monsters and then puts a whole 
army behind him and she elects one of 

2244
01:55:49,591 --> 01:55:53,040
them king who is his name as had 
monster.

2245
01:55:53,220 --> 01:55:55,440
So he's,
for all intents and purposes,

2246
01:55:55,441 --> 01:55:59,250
he's an early representation of sate and
he's like king of the bad guys.

2247
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:01,460
And it's,
it's important to know about him because

2248
01:56:01,461 --> 01:56:03,720
if something happens later in the story.
So,

2249
01:56:04,380 --> 01:56:09,380
so timeouts,
preparing her army of monsters to chi 

2250
01:56:09,380 --> 01:56:14,190
maris to wipe out the,
the gods.

2251
01:56:14,310 --> 01:56:16,680
And so they're like shorting out about 
this.

2252
01:56:16,681 --> 01:56:19,440
But while they're doing it,
they're still making a lot of rocket and

2253
01:56:19,441 --> 01:56:21,850
living the high life and absolutes 
corpse and,

2254
01:56:22,140 --> 01:56:24,690
and propagating.
And while they're doing that,

2255
01:56:24,691 --> 01:56:29,691
they send out one god after another to 
combat time out and they all come back 

2256
01:56:30,690 --> 01:56:33,480
failed.
So whatever these elder gods are,

2257
01:56:33,481 --> 01:56:38,481
whatever they represent,
they're not whatever it is that can 

2258
01:56:38,481 --> 01:56:41,460
confront chaos successfully and prevail 
there powers,

2259
01:56:41,550 --> 01:56:44,220
but they're not whatever that is,
that ultimate power.

2260
01:56:44,490 --> 01:56:48,330
And that's what the mesopotamians were 
trying to figure out who or what is king

2261
01:56:48,331 --> 01:56:53,310
of the gods and king of the gods is the 
thing that confront chaos and regenerate

2262
01:56:53,311 --> 01:56:54,720
order.
So,

2263
01:56:56,340 --> 01:57:00,200
so they keep producing new gods and one 
day they produce martin,

2264
01:57:00,650 --> 01:57:05,650
he's bored in martech is a whole new 
category of god and every one of the 

2265
01:57:05,650 --> 01:57:07,170
gods knows it and he's got some very 
strange attributes.

2266
01:57:07,171 --> 01:57:11,520
One of them is he could speak magic 
words and so when martin speaks,

2267
01:57:11,521 --> 01:57:14,430
the night sky transforms into the sky 
and vice versa.

2268
01:57:14,431 --> 01:57:16,590
So he's,
he's the verbal capacity.

2269
01:57:16,710 --> 01:57:21,710
It's a massive discovery.
It's a massive discovery by the 

2270
01:57:21,710 --> 01:57:23,370
mesopotamians because it's the first 
time we know of that,

2271
01:57:23,371 --> 01:57:28,371
the idea that it's the capacity for 
communicative speech as the primary 

2272
01:57:28,371 --> 01:57:30,450
daddy should be at the top of the 
dominance hierarchy.

2273
01:57:30,630 --> 01:57:33,480
It's one of the most remarkable 
discoveries of the ages,

2274
01:57:33,810 --> 01:57:35,820
and he also has eyes all the way around 
his head.

2275
01:57:36,570 --> 01:57:40,050
So martech is the thing that can speak 
and see,

2276
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:42,480
and it's the thing that's.
So all the gods think,

2277
01:57:42,481 --> 01:57:44,010
wow,
well this is a whole new thing,

2278
01:57:44,011 --> 01:57:49,011
man.
How about you go out and combat tie 

2279
01:57:49,011 --> 01:57:49,011
matt?
Well,

2280
01:57:49,011 --> 01:57:53,690
it doesn't sound like much of a picnic.
You know the logical thing for any 

2281
01:57:53,690 --> 01:57:53,690
sensible god to say his.
How about no,

2282
01:57:53,910 --> 01:57:55,680
but marta doesn't say that.
He says,

2283
01:57:55,710 --> 01:57:57,120
look,
I'll make you guys a deal.

2284
01:57:58,290 --> 01:58:00,930
You get yourself together in a whole,
you know,

2285
01:58:01,080 --> 01:58:06,080
and you have a vote for all intents and 
purposes and you vote me king of the 

2286
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:10,170
gods and allow me from here on end to 
determine destiny's.

2287
01:58:10,171 --> 01:58:11,760
That's exactly what the rest of the team
and say,

2288
01:58:11,910 --> 01:58:15,270
he gets the tablet of destiny and he's 
now in control of it.

2289
01:58:15,271 --> 01:58:20,271
So the mesopotamians are working out 
this idea that it's the thing that can 

2290
01:58:20,271 --> 01:58:23,751
see and that can talk.
That should be the thing that guides 

2291
01:58:23,751 --> 01:58:24,750
destiny.
Especially if destiny involves having to

2292
01:58:25,200 --> 01:58:29,250
go into combat with chaos itself and 
restructure the world,

2293
01:58:29,550 --> 01:58:32,100
and so martin says,
those are the terms,

2294
01:58:32,370 --> 01:58:37,370
I'll do it,
but I'm king of the gods and they all 

2295
01:58:37,370 --> 01:58:37,370
think,
well at the fool is going to go up there

2296
01:58:37,370 --> 01:58:38,080
and get killed anyway,
so you know,

2297
01:58:38,100 --> 01:58:41,710
what do we have to lose?
And so they agree and so martin goes out

2298
01:58:41,711 --> 01:58:42,370
to combat

2299
01:58:42,370 --> 01:58:47,370
time out and he takes a net and a sword 
and he,

2300
01:58:47,860 --> 01:58:50,140
if I remember correctly,
he fills her with a wind,

2301
01:58:50,141 --> 01:58:53,290
which is I believe,
part of the manifestation of this voice,

2302
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:56,170
this voice idea.
He fills her with a wind.

2303
01:58:56,290 --> 01:58:59,890
He encapsulates her in a net.
Now think about what that means.

2304
01:59:00,190 --> 01:59:05,190
You know,
psychologists even used this word 

2305
01:59:05,190 --> 01:59:07,620
phrase,
normal logical net and a normal logical 

2306
01:59:07,620 --> 01:59:11,431
net is this is the network of concepts 
that you use to encapsulate something 

2307
01:59:11,861 --> 01:59:16,861
new in idiation structure.
And so the idea of putting something in 

2308
01:59:16,861 --> 01:59:18,550
a net is to put boundaries around it,
right?

2309
01:59:18,790 --> 01:59:21,730
And to constrain it.
And so some of that's actually,

2310
01:59:21,790 --> 01:59:25,240
well you can capture a predator in a net
and then cut it up,

2311
01:59:25,540 --> 01:59:28,560
but there's no difference between that 
there.

2312
01:59:28,700 --> 01:59:31,210
There's a,
there's a tight analogy between that and

2313
01:59:31,480 --> 01:59:35,080
encapsulating something novel in a 
conceptual network,

2314
01:59:35,230 --> 01:59:37,690
which then enables you to cut it up into
something useful.

2315
01:59:37,900 --> 01:59:39,070
Okay?
So that's what happens.

2316
01:59:39,550 --> 01:59:40,740
Martin goes out,
he,

2317
01:59:40,750 --> 01:59:45,750
he confronts timeout,
he overcomes the monsters and he kills 

2318
01:59:45,750 --> 01:59:48,340
king.
And so and then he makes,

2319
01:59:48,341 --> 01:59:49,870
he cuts time,
hit into pieces,

2320
01:59:50,020 --> 01:59:55,020
and he makes the world.
And that's the world that human beings 

2321
01:59:55,020 --> 01:59:59,040
live on.
And he makes the human beings to serve 

2322
01:59:59,040 --> 01:59:59,040
the gods.
Okay?

2323
01:59:59,040 --> 02:00:01,990
So that's the first part of the story.
Now we also kills king knew and he makes

2324
02:00:01,991 --> 02:00:03,910
human beings out of the blood of king 
knew.

2325
02:00:04,480 --> 02:00:05,920
Now that's a hell of a story,
right?

2326
02:00:05,921 --> 02:00:10,480
Cause king who was king of the demons 
and human beings are the creature that's

2327
02:00:10,481 --> 02:00:12,790
made out of the blood of the king of the
demons.

2328
02:00:12,970 --> 02:00:15,040
And it's a very similar idea to the 
idea,

2329
02:00:15,280 --> 02:00:20,280
the later sort of egyptian and judaeo 
christian ideas that there's a satanic 

2330
02:00:20,280 --> 02:00:23,080
element to being that is also 
characteristic of human beings.

2331
02:00:23,081 --> 02:00:24,840
And part of that is,
well,

2332
02:00:24,850 --> 02:00:28,180
what's the difference between human 
beings and every other element of being?

2333
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:31,390
And the answer to that is,
human beings can deceive you,

2334
02:00:32,710 --> 02:00:37,710
right?
We're the only creatures that can do 

2335
02:00:37,710 --> 02:00:37,710
that.
We're capable of deception,

2336
02:00:37,710 --> 02:00:39,700
voluntary deception.
We're capable of malevolence.

2337
02:00:40,270 --> 02:00:45,270
And so that's echoed as well in the 
story in genesis because when adam and 

2338
02:00:45,270 --> 02:00:47,320
eve eat the apple,
they wake up,

2339
02:00:47,321 --> 02:00:52,321
the scales fall from their eyes.
They recognize that they're naked and 

2340
02:00:52,321 --> 02:00:52,321
they know the difference between good 
and evil,

2341
02:00:52,390 --> 02:00:55,660
which means they can do evil.
And I took me a long time to figure that

2342
02:00:55,661 --> 02:00:56,080
out.
Why?

2343
02:00:56,081 --> 02:01:01,081
What that meant?
So imagine because there is a causal 

2344
02:01:01,081 --> 02:01:03,331
sequence,
say the snake offers you something that 

2345
02:01:03,331 --> 02:01:03,331
you ingest,
it wakes you up.

2346
02:01:03,331 --> 02:01:08,150
The scales fall from your eyes.
So now you can see the first thing you 

2347
02:01:08,150 --> 02:01:09,040
do is you realize that you're naked.
What does that mean?

2348
02:01:09,370 --> 02:01:11,050
Well,
human beings stand upright.

2349
02:01:11,210 --> 02:01:15,700
They're the most vulnerable part of us 
is front and center to be hurt,

2350
02:01:15,701 --> 02:01:18,520
but also to be judged right.
To be naked is to be.

2351
02:01:18,640 --> 02:01:21,520
That's terrifying.
You want to not die.

2352
02:01:21,940 --> 02:01:26,940
You want to cover yourself up,
and so that's the recognition of 

2353
02:01:26,940 --> 02:01:26,980
nakedness.
but then you might say,

2354
02:01:26,981 --> 02:01:31,981
well,
why does the knowledge of good and evil 

2355
02:01:31,981 --> 02:01:33,601
emerge from that?
As soon as you know you're naked and 

2356
02:01:33,601 --> 02:01:33,700
vulnerable,
you know how to hurt other people.

2357
02:01:34,390 --> 02:01:39,390
You're not a predator anymore because 
they'll just tear you apart and eat you 

2358
02:01:39,390 --> 02:01:40,070
like they don't want you to suffer.
Although they don't care.

2359
02:01:40,330 --> 02:01:42,890
They don't want you to suffer.
They just want to eat you.

2360
02:01:43,310 --> 02:01:48,310
But once I know what hurts me,
I know what hurts you and then I can 

2361
02:01:48,310 --> 02:01:50,420
turn that into an art and people have 
done that,

2362
02:01:50,630 --> 02:01:55,630
and so that's,
that's why the knowledge of evil comes 

2363
02:01:55,630 --> 02:01:55,630
immediately as a consequence of the 
knowledge of,

2364
02:01:55,890 --> 02:01:58,880
of nakedness,
and that's associated with the same idea

2365
02:01:59,150 --> 02:02:02,570
that human beings are made out of the 
blood of kengo nasty stories,

2366
02:02:02,571 --> 02:02:03,590
but very,
you know,

2367
02:02:03,591 --> 02:02:08,591
they're,
they're messing with the fundamental 

2368
02:02:08,591 --> 02:02:08,591
structure reality.
They want to get this right.

2369
02:02:08,591 --> 02:02:13,300
Okay,
so one of the cool things about this 

2370
02:02:13,300 --> 02:02:13,300
story,
so okay,

2371
02:02:13,300 --> 02:02:13,300
so that's martin.
Now,

2372
02:02:13,300 --> 02:02:17,750
here's what's so interesting about that.
The mesopotamians,

2373
02:02:17,751 --> 02:02:22,751
they've got this story about the deities
and how they organized themselves to 

2374
02:02:22,751 --> 02:02:25,040
respond to the emergence of chaos and 
how to master you.

2375
02:02:25,260 --> 02:02:30,260
You go after it.
You declare yourself the thing at the 

2376
02:02:30,260 --> 02:02:31,550
top of the dominance hierarchy,
your eyes and speech.

2377
02:02:31,700 --> 02:02:35,540
You go out there voluntarily,
you encapsulate the chaos,

2378
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:38,430
you cut it into pieces and you make the 
world that makes you talk.

2379
02:02:38,431 --> 02:02:43,431
God brilliant,
bloody absolutely phenomenally 

2380
02:02:43,431 --> 02:02:43,880
brilliant.
So what happens?

2381
02:02:44,180 --> 02:02:46,070
That's what's happening in the heavenly 
domain.

2382
02:02:46,071 --> 02:02:48,050
Let's say what happens in the eaRthly 
domain,

2383
02:02:48,670 --> 02:02:51,370
the the emperor of the mesopotamians is 
martin.

2384
02:02:51,490 --> 02:02:56,490
He's the.
He's the manifestation of martech on 

2385
02:02:56,490 --> 02:02:57,380
earth and he has to be a good marduk.
That's this because he might say,

2386
02:02:57,381 --> 02:02:58,640
well,
why should you be king?

2387
02:03:00,020 --> 02:03:00,840
Well,
the Answer to that is,

2388
02:03:00,841 --> 02:03:01,970
well,
your most powerful.

2389
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,610
Now that's not going to work.
Some other weasels will take you out.

2390
02:03:05,510 --> 02:03:07,220
Why should you be king?
Well,

2391
02:03:07,221 --> 02:03:09,800
because you pay attention and you speak 
properly and you keep chaos.

2392
02:03:09,801 --> 02:03:14,801
At bay,
and you make ingenious things happen as 

2393
02:03:14,801 --> 02:03:17,051
a consequence.
So that's what the bloody mesopotamians 

2394
02:03:17,051 --> 02:03:18,110
were trying to work out.
What should be sovereign and why?

2395
02:03:18,710 --> 02:03:23,710
Okay,
so what did they do in the new year's 

2396
02:03:23,710 --> 02:03:24,050
ceremony?
So imagine that there are there.

2397
02:03:24,120 --> 02:03:26,240
They're the king is in a walled city,
right?

2398
02:03:26,241 --> 02:03:29,180
So that's the kings at the top of the 
dominance hierarchy.

2399
02:03:29,181 --> 02:03:33,080
He's the eye at the top of the pyramid 
in a walled city with chaos outside.

2400
02:03:33,260 --> 02:03:35,630
Chaos is outside.
That's the domain of tire.

2401
02:03:35,631 --> 02:03:39,380
Matt at the new year's ceremony,
the old year,

2402
02:03:39,500 --> 02:03:41,150
we know about that.
We still have this idea.

2403
02:03:41,330 --> 02:03:44,630
The old year is an old man.
The new year's about to be born.

2404
02:03:44,930 --> 02:03:48,080
There's an intermediary period of chaos 
that's new year's eve,

2405
02:03:48,110 --> 02:03:53,110
right?
That's the intermediate period of chaos 

2406
02:03:53,110 --> 02:03:53,110
where all the rules are temporarily 
suspended,

2407
02:03:53,110 --> 02:03:55,670
which is why you can go out and party 
like there's no tomorrow,

2408
02:03:55,671 --> 02:03:58,280
new year's eve,
and before the new year is born,

2409
02:03:58,940 --> 02:04:03,940
the mesopotamian emperor and all of his 
rent knew and the people go outside the 

2410
02:04:03,940 --> 02:04:07,220
city on new year's eve and they take 
statues that represent the gods and they

2411
02:04:07,221 --> 02:04:09,160
act out the,
the,

2412
02:04:09,161 --> 02:04:10,610
um,
the,

2413
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:15,880
the,
the story that I just told you with the 

2414
02:04:15,880 --> 02:04:15,880
statues.

2415
02:04:15,880 --> 02:04:18,670
And aS part of that,
the emperor has to take off all his 

2416
02:04:19,460 --> 02:04:24,460
garbs,
his garments that make him king and 

2417
02:04:24,460 --> 02:04:24,460
kneel in front of the priest.
And the priest,

2418
02:04:24,460 --> 02:04:26,030
if I remember cOrrectly,
slaps him with a glove.

2419
02:04:26,031 --> 02:04:31,031
It's something like that and tells him 
that he has to tell everyone why in the 

2420
02:04:31,031 --> 02:04:35,650
last year he wasn't a very good marduk 
and how he's going to do better in the 

2421
02:04:35,650 --> 02:04:35,650
future.
Which is exactly by the way,

2422
02:04:35,650 --> 02:04:36,770
what you do when you make your new 
year's.

2423
02:04:37,140 --> 02:04:38,550
Um,
what do you call those?

2424
02:04:39,600 --> 02:04:44,600
Yes.
The ones who immediately break the next 

2425
02:04:44,600 --> 02:04:44,600
day.
But it's the same.

2426
02:04:44,600 --> 02:04:47,601
It's this renewal idea and it happens 
that it happens in the depths of 

2427
02:04:47,601 --> 02:04:49,560
darkness in the middle of the winter 
before the light comes back.

2428
02:04:49,740 --> 02:04:51,180
Right?
That's why it's set up that way.

2429
02:04:51,540 --> 02:04:53,460
So,
so anyways,

2430
02:04:53,461 --> 02:04:58,461
and so that,
so as long as the emperor is a good 

2431
02:04:58,461 --> 02:04:59,310
mark,
then that's why he gets to be emperor.

2432
02:04:59,311 --> 02:05:00,600
and if he's not a good mark,
then,

2433
02:05:00,601 --> 02:05:01,920
well,
someone else should be emperor.

2434
02:05:02,250 --> 02:05:04,350
So,
so thAt's how that works.

2435
02:05:10,520 --> 02:05:12,200
And there's some representations of it 
day.

2436
02:05:12,380 --> 02:05:16,700
So there's,
there's a time out there,

2437
02:05:17,840 --> 02:05:20,570
sort of a spirit matter combination.
Winged dragon,

2438
02:05:20,600 --> 02:05:22,370
right?
The thing that we've seen so many times,

2439
02:05:22,610 --> 02:05:24,530
and there's marduk,
he's got angel wings.

2440
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:25,850
Um,
uh,

2441
02:05:25,870 --> 02:05:28,790
why the wings?
I don't know exactly why the wings,

2442
02:05:28,791 --> 02:05:32,210
I mean he's obviously being assimilated 
to the idea of a bird.

2443
02:05:32,420 --> 02:05:34,400
I don't know if the idea of

2444
02:05:34,700 --> 02:05:39,700
the far seeing capacity of the bird was 
there for the mesopotamians it's highly 

2445
02:05:39,700 --> 02:05:44,501
probable,
but also the bird is something that 

2446
02:05:44,501 --> 02:05:45,110
flies up above everything else.
And that can see for long distances.

2447
02:05:45,111 --> 02:05:47,750
So it's an aerial spirit.
It's close to god and all of that.

2448
02:05:47,751 --> 02:05:48,020
So,

2449
02:05:48,380 --> 02:05:51,560
so there is a very primordial 
representation of the same thing.

2450
02:05:51,770 --> 02:05:56,770
Look how much imagination does it take 
to see that that's the story of human 

2451
02:05:57,231 --> 02:05:58,850
beings in countering the unknown.

2452
02:06:01,710 --> 02:06:02,940
You know,
when you know the code,

2453
02:06:02,941 --> 02:06:04,590
it just seems self evident.
Yes.

2454
02:06:04,591 --> 02:06:06,390
Well there is.
he's got his bow and arrow,

2455
02:06:06,720 --> 02:06:08,880
you know,
and he's out there fighting the monsters

2456
02:06:08,881 --> 02:06:12,180
of the unknown and that's part,
that's how human beings have survived.

2457
02:06:12,181 --> 02:06:12,980
You see?
Yeah.

2458
02:06:13,640 --> 02:06:14,220
Yeah.
That's.

2459
02:06:14,250 --> 02:06:16,770
And then see here,
he's writing this great big snake.

2460
02:06:16,771 --> 02:06:20,670
So that's another representation of the 
same kind of thing.

2461
02:06:22,380 --> 02:06:27,380
Okay.
So let me just think for a minute and 

2462
02:06:27,380 --> 02:06:27,630
figure out what I want to do next.
If I want to go somewhere next.

2463
02:06:27,631 --> 02:06:30,720
I guess what I'll do right now is I'll 
just show you some additional pictures.

2464
02:06:31,170 --> 02:06:34,750
So we've laid out the conceptual world 
to some degree right on,

2465
02:06:34,910 --> 02:06:37,820
and I mentioned that you can think about
it as the,

2466
02:06:38,360 --> 02:06:40,920
the potential itself.
That'S the dragon of chaos.

2467
02:06:40,921 --> 02:06:45,921
And then nature,
which has a positive and a negative 

2468
02:06:45,921 --> 02:06:46,620
element creation and destruction and 
culture,

2469
02:06:46,621 --> 02:06:49,110
which has a positIve and negative 
emotion element.

2470
02:06:49,260 --> 02:06:54,260
They're reversed a because it's the 
positive element of culture that 

2471
02:06:54,260 --> 02:06:57,291
protects you against the negative 
element of nature and the negative 

2472
02:06:57,291 --> 02:07:00,471
element of our culture can be destroyed 
by the new coming in from the,

2473
02:07:00,840 --> 02:07:05,840
from the natural world,
and then the will individual positive 

2474
02:07:05,840 --> 02:07:05,940
and negative as well.
That's the.

2475
02:07:06,210 --> 02:07:11,040
That's the entire story roughly speaking
and I showed you it's manifestations and

2476
02:07:11,041 --> 02:07:16,041
figures like this,
so you have this is called the open 

2477
02:07:16,041 --> 02:07:19,401
virgin or they're opening virgin because
that those two halves can be closed,

2478
02:07:20,431 --> 02:07:25,431
so there's mother nature,
roughly speaking or the mother of god 

2479
02:07:25,431 --> 02:07:29,420
and depending on how you look at it and 
inside her nature culture,

2480
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:34,520
the patriarchy,
the culture supports the suffering 

2481
02:07:34,520 --> 02:07:37,611
individual who voluntarily accepts death
and mortality as the price to be paid 

2482
02:07:38,471 --> 02:07:40,570
for being.
That's what that image represents.

2483
02:07:40,740 --> 02:07:43,300
It's.
It's absolutely unbelievable.

2484
02:07:43,420 --> 02:07:48,420
And then you see all these people at the
side here are gazing uncontrollably at 

2485
02:07:48,420 --> 02:07:52,081
this image,
which is of course exactly what's 

2486
02:07:52,081 --> 02:07:53,911
happened over the last 2000 years,
at least in part of the world because 

2487
02:07:53,911 --> 02:07:53,911
there's.

2488
02:07:53,911 --> 02:07:57,790
There's a tremendous idea encapsulated 
inside that image and the image.

2489
02:07:57,820 --> 02:08:02,820
The idea is something like the voluntary
acceptance of suffering is key to it's 

2490
02:08:02,820 --> 02:08:04,250
transcendence and that's,
that's a,

2491
02:08:04,480 --> 02:08:07,210
that's a crucial psychotherapeutic 
truth,

2492
02:08:07,330 --> 02:08:08,890
right?
Things that bother.

2493
02:08:08,891 --> 02:08:11,650
You need to be confronted voluntarily.
You have to accept them.

2494
02:08:11,680 --> 02:08:13,090
You have to accept that.
You think,

2495
02:08:13,091 --> 02:08:14,350
well,
how far does that go?

2496
02:08:14,620 --> 02:08:17,980
While we don't know,
it works in small things that works with

2497
02:08:17,981 --> 02:08:19,690
phobias,
it works with traumas.

2498
02:08:19,900 --> 02:08:23,620
Traumas are usually associated with 
death or disease or malevolence.

2499
02:08:23,710 --> 02:08:28,710
So that's pushing it pretty far.
There doesn't seem to be a limit to the 

2500
02:08:28,710 --> 02:08:32,431
due to the idea that the voluntary 
confrontation with the things that are 

2501
02:08:32,431 --> 02:08:36,871
terrifying is curative.
There doesn't seem to be a limit to 

2502
02:08:36,871 --> 02:08:39,571
that.
There's an example in the story of 

2503
02:08:39,571 --> 02:08:39,571
exodus when moses is leading the 
israelites through the desert,

2504
02:08:39,571 --> 02:08:44,570
um,
they fragment because while they're out 

2505
02:08:44,570 --> 02:08:44,710
of tyranny,
so they don't know what to do.

2506
02:08:44,710 --> 02:08:46,330
It's all chaotic.
And you know,

2507
02:08:46,390 --> 02:08:48,040
this moses character,
yeah,

2508
02:08:48,041 --> 02:08:53,041
he got them out of Egypt,
but now they're in the desert and 

2509
02:08:53,041 --> 02:08:53,041
there's nothing to eat and like why 
should they listen to him?

2510
02:08:53,041 --> 02:08:57,751
And so they start worshiping all sorts 
of idols and that's kind of like the 

2511
02:08:57,751 --> 02:08:59,170
fragmentation of what holds them 
centrally together.

2512
02:08:59,500 --> 02:09:02,560
And so what does god do?
He is not very happy about that.

2513
02:09:03,700 --> 02:09:06,700
So he sends a bunch of poisonous snakes 
into the desert to bite the ball.

2514
02:09:07,540 --> 02:09:12,540
Any thanks enough for these people.
And that's chaos returning right in the 

2515
02:09:12,540 --> 02:09:13,940
form of these poisonous snakes.
And so the,

2516
02:09:14,020 --> 02:09:19,020
the israelites are kind of sick and 
tired of being bitten by a poisonous 

2517
02:09:19,020 --> 02:09:19,020
snake.
So they go back to moses and they say,

2518
02:09:19,020 --> 02:09:19,330
well,
you know,

2519
02:09:19,890 --> 02:09:24,890
I know we've wandered off the path here 
and we didn't think you were the 

2520
02:09:24,890 --> 02:09:24,890
greatest guy there for awhile,
but you know,

2521
02:09:24,890 --> 02:09:27,340
maybe you could have a little chat with 
god and see what he could do about these

2522
02:09:27,341 --> 02:09:28,210
poisonous snakes.

2523
02:09:28,210 --> 02:09:33,210
And so,
so moses in treats god to do something 

2524
02:09:33,210 --> 02:09:33,820
about the snakes and what god tells 
people to do.

2525
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:35,380
It's the strangest thing.
He says,

2526
02:09:36,670 --> 02:09:41,670
make a snake in the image.
Make a broad snake and put it on a post 

2527
02:09:41,890 --> 02:09:46,890
and have everyone look at it.
And everyone who goes to look at the 

2528
02:09:46,890 --> 02:09:47,020
snake won't be bitten by the poisonous 
snakes anymore.

2529
02:09:47,550 --> 02:09:48,480
It's so,
it's,

2530
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:51,730
it's,
it's crazy.

2531
02:09:51,731 --> 02:09:52,990
That idea.
It's crazy.

2532
02:09:53,320 --> 02:09:58,320
So,
and I'll tell you something else else 

2533
02:09:58,320 --> 02:09:58,320
that's very interesting.
So in the,

2534
02:09:58,320 --> 02:10:01,750
in the christian story,
christ assimilates himself to that snake

2535
02:10:01,751 --> 02:10:05,550
that was put on the post in the desert 
says exactly the same thing that,

2536
02:10:05,750 --> 02:10:10,750
that,
that has to be looked at because that's 

2537
02:10:10,750 --> 02:10:11,260
the pathway to salvation.
Roughly speaking,

2538
02:10:11,350 --> 02:10:16,350
it's exactly the same idea.
It's the worst thing that can possibly 

2539
02:10:16,350 --> 02:10:19,771
happen.
So you look upon it and meditate upon 

2540
02:10:19,771 --> 02:10:19,771
it.

2541
02:10:19,771 --> 02:10:20,890
And that's the key to transcending it.
Well.

2542
02:10:20,891 --> 02:10:23,350
So that's the idea that's encapsulated 
in that image.

2543
02:10:24,010 --> 02:10:25,390
So it's,
you know,

2544
02:10:25,391 --> 02:10:30,391
it's no wonder that these ideas had to 
be expressed in images because they're 

2545
02:10:30,391 --> 02:10:33,460
so unbelievably complicated that they're
almost incomprehensible.

2546
02:10:33,740 --> 02:10:38,740
So they'd come out first in the image 
and they come out first in the story 

2547
02:10:38,740 --> 02:10:38,900
because they're just.
And plus,

2548
02:10:38,901 --> 02:10:43,901
they're so difficult to believe what the
last thing you would think if you are 

2549
02:10:43,901 --> 02:10:47,881
being bitten by a poisonous snakes was 
that you should make a bronze image of 

2550
02:10:47,881 --> 02:10:49,040
one and put it on a stick so that you 
could go look at it.

2551
02:10:49,041 --> 02:10:50,630
I mean,
there's a magical element to that,

2552
02:10:50,631 --> 02:10:54,500
but it's psycho therapeutically.
Exactly right.

2553
02:10:54,590 --> 02:10:58,610
So I had this client and she had a dream
about what she was.

2554
02:10:58,640 --> 02:11:00,650
She was having a really rough time and 
she,

2555
02:11:00,710 --> 02:11:05,710
she was a pretty good dreamer.
She had this dream that she was walking 

2556
02:11:05,710 --> 02:11:08,741
down a road by,
there's a ocean on one side and there 

2557
02:11:08,741 --> 02:11:09,530
was a sort of sand dunes on the other 
side.

2558
02:11:10,040 --> 02:11:15,040
And she looked up and there was this guy
with a huge python that had,

2559
02:11:15,890 --> 02:11:17,990
that had been out there showing it to 
everyone.

2560
02:11:18,350 --> 02:11:23,350
And uh,
she took a look and he invited her to 

2561
02:11:23,350 --> 02:11:24,200
come and take a look at the snake.
But she refused and walked on.

2562
02:11:24,620 --> 02:11:27,800
And so she told me that dream.
She was also quIte imaginative.

2563
02:11:27,801 --> 02:11:28,520
So I said,
look,

2564
02:11:28,521 --> 02:11:30,140
let's,
let's try something.

2565
02:11:32,270 --> 02:11:34,580
First of all,
tell me about the snake handler.

2566
02:11:35,030 --> 02:11:35,720
And she said,
well,

2567
02:11:35,721 --> 02:11:37,820
he's kind of a charlatan.
He's a show off.

2568
02:11:37,821 --> 02:11:39,080
He's a,
he's a fake.

2569
02:11:39,320 --> 02:11:44,090
And I'm afraid that if I went up to the 
crowd and where the snake was,

2570
02:11:44,091 --> 02:11:46,210
that they would force me to touch it.
And so I,

2571
02:11:46,250 --> 02:11:47,240
I thought,
okay,

2572
02:11:47,241 --> 02:11:48,590
so that's why you walked by,
said,

2573
02:11:48,591 --> 02:11:49,640
okay,
so let's play a game.

2574
02:11:49,641 --> 02:11:53,120
So you sit there and bring that dream 
image to mind.

2575
02:11:53,121 --> 02:11:54,890
Close your eyes,
bring the dream image to mind,

2576
02:11:54,891 --> 02:11:59,891
but let's play with it a little bit.
It's like young technique of active 

2577
02:11:59,891 --> 02:11:59,891
imagination.
Let's play with it a little bit.

2578
02:11:59,891 --> 02:12:01,660
So go up there,
you know,

2579
02:12:01,670 --> 02:12:06,670
imagine that you go up there and you 
kind of have to do this like you're 

2580
02:12:06,670 --> 02:12:06,670
daydreaming,
you know,

2581
02:12:06,670 --> 02:12:11,110
you can't force it.
You have to play with it like you would 

2582
02:12:11,110 --> 02:12:14,260
when you're daydreaming,
which is you're kind of half doing it 

2583
02:12:14,260 --> 02:12:14,660
voluntarily and it's half manifesting 
itself.

2584
02:12:14,810 --> 02:12:17,720
It's kind of a gateway between you and 
the collective unconscious.

2585
02:12:17,721 --> 02:12:20,720
That's another way of thinking about it.
And anywayS,

2586
02:12:20,721 --> 02:12:21,200
I said,
okay,

2587
02:12:21,201 --> 02:12:26,201
so go up there and the first thing we're
going to do is figure out what are you 

2588
02:12:26,201 --> 02:12:28,520
going to do if the crowd tells you that 
you have to touch the snake or get close

2589
02:12:28,521 --> 02:12:33,521
to it because she needed a defense 
because it isn't up to other people to 

2590
02:12:33,521 --> 02:12:33,540
force her to do that.
So we,

2591
02:12:33,600 --> 02:12:35,880
we practiced what she might say,
no,

2592
02:12:35,900 --> 02:12:37,280
I'm,
I'm comfortable here.

2593
02:12:37,281 --> 02:12:38,660
I'm just going to stand in the 
background.

2594
02:12:38,810 --> 02:12:40,580
Just didn't look at it and get 
accustomed to it.

2595
02:12:40,790 --> 02:12:43,790
I don't need you to push me forward.
And so she felt pretty good about that.

2596
02:12:43,970 --> 02:12:45,800
So that kind of armed her with a 
defense.

2597
02:12:45,801 --> 02:12:48,530
So then she could pretend to go up And 
take a look at the snake.

2598
02:12:48,530 --> 02:12:48,950
And I said,
well,

2599
02:12:48,951 --> 02:12:53,951
the first thing you should do is take a 
look at the snake handler and see if 

2600
02:12:53,951 --> 02:12:56,090
he's who you think he is.
And so she did that in her imagination.

2601
02:12:56,091 --> 02:12:56,690
She said,
no,

2602
02:12:56,691 --> 02:12:58,670
he's,
he doesn't seem to be sharp at all.

2603
02:12:58,671 --> 02:13:00,850
He's got this snake that is is,
you know,

2604
02:13:00,860 --> 02:13:05,860
something he takes care of.
And he just has come out here to show 

2605
02:13:05,860 --> 02:13:06,830
the people,
let people look at this snake.

2606
02:13:06,831 --> 02:13:08,230
And so she said,
son,

2607
02:13:08,280 --> 02:13:08,690
I said,
well,

2608
02:13:08,691 --> 02:13:13,691
is he,
is he someone that you can trust or 

2609
02:13:13,691 --> 02:13:16,331
someone you shouldn't trust?
You have to ask both those questions 

2610
02:13:16,331 --> 02:13:16,730
because otherwise you're leading the 
witness,

2611
02:13:16,731 --> 02:13:21,731
right?
You don't want to tell people what to 

2612
02:13:21,731 --> 02:13:24,131
think.
You have to let them figure it out for 

2613
02:13:24,131 --> 02:13:24,131
themselves.
So,

2614
02:13:24,131 --> 02:13:24,131
and she said,
no,

2615
02:13:24,131 --> 02:13:24,950
I think he's somebody that that can be 
trusted.

2616
02:13:24,951 --> 02:13:25,520
And I said,
okay,

2617
02:13:25,521 --> 02:13:30,521
well,
so what do you think that you could go 

2618
02:13:30,521 --> 02:13:30,521
up there and,
and,

2619
02:13:30,521 --> 02:13:30,521
and,
you know,

2620
02:13:30,521 --> 02:13:31,050
maybe lay your hands on the snake and 
touch this.

2621
02:13:31,350 --> 02:13:36,350
And she said she wasn't sure about it,
but we went through it and she was able 

2622
02:13:36,350 --> 02:13:37,590
to do it.
And so it's the same.

2623
02:13:38,980 --> 02:13:41,440
So she had to,
she had to make contact.

2624
02:13:41,441 --> 02:13:43,420
She had to voluntarily make contact 
with,

2625
02:13:43,620 --> 02:13:46,600
with the terrible snake that's at the 
bottom of being.

2626
02:13:46,750 --> 02:13:49,360
that's at the bottom of the tree of 
existence.

2627
02:13:49,930 --> 02:13:51,160
Right?
That's where the snake is.

2628
02:13:51,161 --> 02:13:52,600
It's wrapped around the tree.
Well,

2629
02:13:52,601 --> 02:13:53,320
why?
Well,

2630
02:13:53,321 --> 02:13:58,321
partly because we lived in trees and 
that's where the damn snakes were down 

2631
02:13:58,321 --> 02:13:59,320
there on the ground where we didn't 
know,

2632
02:13:59,860 --> 02:14:02,290
right?
And that's the divine tree of being that

2633
02:14:02,860 --> 02:14:04,510
and so,
well,

2634
02:14:04,570 --> 02:14:07,690
you have to get the hell out of the tree
and go confront the snakes.

2635
02:14:07,750 --> 02:14:10,060
And then that's the,
that's the way out,

2636
02:14:10,120 --> 02:14:13,000
at least in principle.
So that's kinda what that means.

2637
02:14:13,940 --> 02:14:14,310
Um,

2638
02:14:17,440 --> 02:14:17,920
show you.

2639
02:14:18,350 --> 02:14:19,940
Here's another image of the same thing.

2640
02:14:22,760 --> 02:14:26,420
What I like about this.
See the fact that the,

2641
02:14:26,550 --> 02:14:28,580
the,
the culture of the patriarchy,

2642
02:14:28,581 --> 02:14:30,310
god,
the father will say here is,

2643
02:14:30,330 --> 02:14:34,460
is holding the,
the suffering individual in his arms and

2644
02:14:34,461 --> 02:14:36,110
that's encapsulated by nature.
It's,

2645
02:14:36,350 --> 02:14:41,350
it's very much like the story in 
pinocchio where Japan auto pinocchio 

2646
02:14:41,350 --> 02:14:46,241
wasn't able to go down into the depths 
to confront the terrible monster at the 

2647
02:14:46,241 --> 02:14:48,080
bottom of being without having support 
from his father.

2648
02:14:48,081 --> 02:14:50,270
Even though his father ended up trapped 
inside the whale.

2649
02:14:50,271 --> 02:14:52,460
If he wouldn't have been supported to 
begin with,

2650
02:14:52,820 --> 02:14:54,620
he wouldn't have been able to do it.
And you know,

2651
02:14:54,621 --> 02:14:57,020
I've really seen this and I've really 
seen this in people.

2652
02:14:57,260 --> 02:15:00,050
It's a hell of a thing not to have the 
confidence of your father.

2653
02:15:00,680 --> 02:15:02,450
It's really,
really hard on people.

2654
02:15:02,630 --> 02:15:07,630
You know.
If your father is someone who says to 

2655
02:15:07,630 --> 02:15:07,630
you,
you can do it.

2656
02:15:07,630 --> 02:15:08,900
I really believe that you can do it.
I'll support you in what you're doing.

2657
02:15:09,110 --> 02:15:12,530
I think that you can sort it out and 
then alex towards you in that way.

2658
02:15:12,680 --> 02:15:15,380
That's a gift that really almost no one 
else can provide you with.

2659
02:15:15,500 --> 02:15:20,500
Mothers obviously provide.
I think they provide the same kind of 

2660
02:15:20,500 --> 02:15:23,471
gift,
but earlier you know because the mother 

2661
02:15:23,471 --> 02:15:25,661
has to take care of the infant when the 
infant is just completely dependent and 

2662
02:15:25,661 --> 02:15:29,891
so,
and this is erickson's idea to Eric 

2663
02:15:29,891 --> 02:15:32,440
Erickson is the mother is,
is the person who establishes the 

2664
02:15:32,440 --> 02:15:34,610
relationship that allows the developing 
person to manifest trust.

2665
02:15:34,611 --> 02:15:37,400
Real truck while you're being carried 
for crying out loud,

2666
02:15:37,401 --> 02:15:40,760
you know you can be dropped and the 
mother is also the source of food,

2667
02:15:40,970 --> 02:15:42,800
but the father seems to be something 
like the.

2668
02:15:43,130 --> 02:15:48,130
And I'm being.
I'm obviously parsing these things 

2669
02:15:48,130 --> 02:15:51,131
farther apart than they can be need to 
be because the farther can play a 

2670
02:15:51,131 --> 02:15:51,890
nurturing role in the mother complained,
encouraging role,

2671
02:15:51,891 --> 02:15:52,710
but we'll.

2672
02:15:52,750 --> 02:15:57,750
We'll keep it simple for now.
The father seems to be the thing that 

2673
02:15:57,750 --> 02:15:57,750
supports and encourages.
It says,

2674
02:15:57,750 --> 02:15:57,920
well,
yeah,

2675
02:15:57,921 --> 02:16:02,921
you know,
you're little and small and all of that 

2676
02:16:02,921 --> 02:16:02,921
and you're subject to destruction and 
and,

2677
02:16:03,110 --> 02:16:05,510
and bullying and social pressure and all
that,

2678
02:16:05,511 --> 02:16:08,750
but I know you can do it.
I know you can do it and there's a force

2679
02:16:08,751 --> 02:16:13,751
in that that's unbelievable and people 
who don't have that half a have a hell 

2680
02:16:13,751 --> 02:16:17,201
of a time.
IT's actually one of the things that's 

2681
02:16:17,201 --> 02:16:19,331
quite fun about doing psychotherapy 
because you get people who have damaged 

2682
02:16:19,331 --> 02:16:21,720
father figures.
It's harder with a damaged mother figure

2683
02:16:21,721 --> 02:16:24,140
a because it's so bloody deep.
You know?

2684
02:16:24,141 --> 02:16:29,141
I had a client who I just,
I just thought she was a remarkable 

2685
02:16:29,141 --> 02:16:29,650
person,
but her relationship with her was really

2686
02:16:29,651 --> 02:16:30,820
disrupted.
That was really,

2687
02:16:30,821 --> 02:16:33,040
really hard to.
She say she would.

2688
02:16:33,100 --> 02:16:38,100
She,
she told me it was like something had 

2689
02:16:38,100 --> 02:16:38,100
been torn out of her at an early age 
that couldn't be replaced.

2690
02:16:38,100 --> 02:16:40,330
It's because you just can't be someone's
mother,

2691
02:16:40,331 --> 02:16:42,100
you know,
it's really hard.

2692
02:16:42,430 --> 02:16:46,210
You're just Not there enough for that,
but you can sort of be someone surrogate

2693
02:16:46,211 --> 02:16:51,211
father that's a,
that's a role you can play later and 

2694
02:16:51,211 --> 02:16:51,520
that's what educators do at least to 
some degree,

2695
02:16:51,521 --> 02:16:56,521
although now they're trying to be 
mothers and providing safe spaces and 

2696
02:16:56,521 --> 02:16:56,530
all of that,
which is not really all that appropriate

2697
02:16:57,100 --> 02:17:02,100
so that.
So the father is an encouraging figure 

2698
02:17:02,100 --> 02:17:04,981
and allows the Individual at least in 
principle to support the catastrophe of 

2699
02:17:04,981 --> 02:17:08,780
being voluntarily.
And so anyways,

2700
02:17:08,781 --> 02:17:09,430
so those,
you know,

2701
02:17:09,431 --> 02:17:14,431
those images,
they're just be are brilliant beyond 

2702
02:17:14,431 --> 02:17:14,431
belief.
Absolutely brilliant.

2703
02:17:14,431 --> 02:17:15,700
Beyond belief.
Okay,

2704
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:17,560
well that's probably a good place to 
stop.

2705
02:17:18,370 --> 02:17:20,860
And so,
so we've got through the,

2706
02:17:21,490 --> 02:17:23,590
the to fund these two fundamental 
stories,

2707
02:17:23,591 --> 02:17:25,150
remembering the egyptian story.

2708
02:17:25,750 --> 02:17:30,750
You have much more development of the 
figure of cyrus who's equivalent to 

2709
02:17:30,750 --> 02:17:34,600
absolute and the egyptian sort of walked
through how the state becomes corrupt 

2710
02:17:34,600 --> 02:17:39,361
and deteriorates and what the individual
has to do in relationship to the state 

2711
02:17:39,361 --> 02:17:42,010
as well as in relationship to the chaos 
itself.

2712
02:17:42,250 --> 02:17:45,280
So in the mesopotamian story,
it's mostly ab.

2713
02:17:45,281 --> 02:17:49,480
Sue's dad and marta makes a new society 
out of the pieces,

2714
02:17:49,481 --> 02:17:52,420
but it's pretty damn implicit.
It's not detailed.

2715
02:17:52,421 --> 02:17:54,090
Whereas by the time the egyptians come 
along,

2716
02:17:54,110 --> 02:17:54,610
they say,
well,

2717
02:17:55,030 --> 02:17:56,620
oh,
cirrus was great.

2718
02:17:56,800 --> 02:17:59,710
He's corrupted by seth.
He has an evil brother,

2719
02:17:59,711 --> 02:18:01,780
so that's the tyrannical element of the 
state.

2720
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:06,960
He's overcome by the evil brother,
which is the tendency of every 

2721
02:18:06,960 --> 02:18:08,830
bureaucratic system.
EverywherE things fall apart.

2722
02:18:08,831 --> 02:18:11,020
Chaos comes back up.
The hero is born,

2723
02:18:11,290 --> 02:18:15,070
takes on the corruption of the state and
it goes into the underworld,

2724
02:18:15,071 --> 02:18:20,071
which is like confronting matt,
but I likE to have the stories in 

2725
02:18:20,071 --> 02:18:23,581
parallel because one of them is the 
confrontation with absolute unknown 

2726
02:18:23,581 --> 02:18:23,581
tire.

2727
02:18:23,581 --> 02:18:25,300
Matt and the other is the revivification
of the state.

2728
02:18:25,301 --> 02:18:29,350
Even though the stories also overlap and
so in the egyptian story,

2729
02:18:30,540 --> 02:18:33,690
so just like marduk was the,
uh,

2730
02:18:33,700 --> 02:18:38,700
the mortal for the emperor,
the combination of osiris and horus was 

2731
02:18:38,700 --> 02:18:41,980
the model for the feral and then there 
was an idea that emerged out of Egypt.

2732
02:18:42,010 --> 02:18:45,100
This was called the democratization of 
osiris and it's,

2733
02:18:45,160 --> 02:18:50,160
I think part of what gave rise to the 
entire judeo christian idea set of ideas

2734
02:18:50,951 --> 02:18:53,950
because the jews hypothetically came out
of Egypt,

2735
02:18:53,951 --> 02:18:58,951
right?
So their thinking is very deeply 

2736
02:18:58,951 --> 02:19:01,021
influenced by Egypt and ideas.
the pharaoh was the amalgam of osiris 

2737
02:19:02,171 --> 02:19:06,550
and horus and they amalgam of osiris and
horus was his immortal soul.

2738
02:19:06,551 --> 02:19:11,551
The pharaohs immortal soul.
And the pharaoh was allowed to use the 

2739
02:19:11,551 --> 02:19:12,070
symbolism of the conjunction of osiris 
and horus.

2740
02:19:12,370 --> 02:19:14,350
But as the egyptian society is 
developed,

2741
02:19:14,620 --> 02:19:17,410
the aristocracy started to get to use 
that symbol.

2742
02:19:18,040 --> 02:19:23,040
So it started moving down the hierarchy,
the idea that it wasn't only that the 

2743
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:26,920
pharaoh was osiris and horus,
it was then it was the aristocracy.

2744
02:19:27,380 --> 02:19:29,000
And then by the time the greeks came 
along,

2745
02:19:29,001 --> 02:19:32,300
it was all men who were part of the 
political structure.

2746
02:19:32,810 --> 02:19:35,540
And then by the time the christians came
along,

2747
02:19:35,541 --> 02:19:36,190
it was no,
no,

2748
02:19:36,200 --> 02:19:37,850
wait a minute,
this applies to everyone,

2749
02:19:38,210 --> 02:19:39,260
men,
women,

2750
02:19:39,350 --> 02:19:44,350
and not only male and female alike,
but also not just star work,

2751
02:19:45,530 --> 02:19:48,710
upholders of the state,
but criminals,

2752
02:19:48,711 --> 02:19:50,390
tax collectors,
prostitutes,

2753
02:19:50,391 --> 02:19:52,670
outcasts,
everyone had this,

2754
02:19:52,910 --> 02:19:53,750
oh,
cyrus,

2755
02:19:53,990 --> 02:19:56,720
horace,
soul inside of them,

2756
02:19:56,930 --> 02:20:01,930
and we're entitled to be treated as if 
they were intrinsically valuable as a 

2757
02:20:03,021 --> 02:20:08,021
consequence of that.
And that's the bedrock as far as I'm 

2758
02:20:08,021 --> 02:20:11,141
concerned.
that's the bedrock idea upon which 

2759
02:20:11,141 --> 02:20:13,331
western civilization is predicated.
It's the sovereignty of the individual 

2760
02:20:13,610 --> 02:20:15,860
and the individual is sovereign.
Why?

2761
02:20:16,400 --> 02:20:18,890
The individual is the eye that's up 
above the pyraMid.

2762
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:23,050
The individual is the thing that can 
dominate sets of dominance hierarchies.

2763
02:20:23,070 --> 02:20:25,610
The individual is the thing that plays 
the game,

2764
02:20:25,611 --> 02:20:28,000
but the metagame,
the individuals,

2765
02:20:28,010 --> 02:20:30,350
the thing that revivified the dead 
culture,

2766
02:20:30,650 --> 02:20:35,650
the individual is the thing that that 
goes out to combat chaos and generate 

2767
02:20:35,650 --> 02:20:39,080
something valuable as a consequence.
And that's why it's sovereign.

2768
02:20:39,100 --> 02:20:44,100
Invaluable.
Now it's the foundation of our legal 

2769
02:20:44,100 --> 02:20:44,260
system and our culture.
So,

2770
02:20:45,200 --> 02:20:48,110
so I think about it as the,
as a new emergence,

2771
02:20:48,260 --> 02:20:49,880
as an emergent property of 
enlightenment,

2772
02:20:49,881 --> 02:20:53,780
ideals is dangerous because that's 400 
years.

2773
02:20:54,440 --> 02:20:59,440
Who cares about 400 years.
This is forever and forever is a lot 

2774
02:20:59,440 --> 02:21:03,410
more from grounding than 400 years.
It's not a set of rational ideas.

2775
02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:05,930
It's way,
way deeper than that out.

2776
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:09,020
So.
Okay,

2777
02:21:11,330 --> 02:21:13,670
good enough.
We'll see you in a week.
