1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,050
Well Dave and I are here today to talk 
about Patrion.

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,123
And so all start,
we've been engaged in lengthy series of 

3
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:08,604
email exchanges with all of the people 
in our network and no one is happy at 

4
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:14,424
all with what's been happening.
And so we've been determining what our 

5
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:21,060
options are and we looked at subscribes 
to our,

6
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:24,480
but it looks like paypal decided to cut 
funding out from them.

7
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:25,314
And so it doesn't look like moving to an
alternative provider and an alternative 

8
00:00:28,981 --> 00:00:32,040
commercial pro provider that's out of 
our bailiwick,

9
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,660
out of our control is going to be 
viable.

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,093
So Dave,
why don't you describe what we talked 

11
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:37,734
about today?

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:38,783
Yeah.
Well first I think we should just make 

13
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:41,064
it very clear for everybody how 
significant what happened to Carl 

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,673
Benjamin Sargon of a cod is it doesn't 
matter what you think of him or whether 

15
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:50,334
you agree with him or any of that stuff.
The banning of him for doing something 

16
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:58,440
that was not on the Patriot,
on platform that wasn't even done on his

17
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:03,441
channel because of a word he said,
where he was using the word against the,

18
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:04,703
uh,
the alt right or the Neo Nazis or 

19
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:11,190
whatever you want to call them,
is a massive move of that line of what's

20
00:01:11,191 --> 00:01:12,024
acceptable.
Now there's all sorts of debates we can 

21
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:16,470
have and we've had them of what lines 
should be,

22
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:17,304
if there should be lines at all,
but the fact that this guy got booted 

23
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,980
with no chance of recourse with no 
warning,

24
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:23,963
just just like that.
It's just an extension of everything 

25
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:28,010
else that we've all been talking

26
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,933
also.
And also given that it's also the case 

27
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:34,490
that he didn't break patrons,
rules of engagement,

28
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,713
the ones that they stated and that Kanye
had talked to you about the fact that 

29
00:01:39,231 --> 00:01:43,130
that wasn't going to happen and that 
Patrion hasn't responded well to this.

30
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,513
Well,
look,

31
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:49,520
Jack Conti came into my studio in my 
home and said he,

32
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,690
he said a phrase that I had never heard 
before.

33
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:55,020
Maybe you had heard it before.
Manifest observable behaviors.

34
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:56,640
So you had never even heard that phrase 
before,

35
00:01:56,641 --> 00:01:57,241
right?
I thought,

36
00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:59,310
I thought maybe this was just something 
that went past me.

37
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:00,144
Okay.
Now of course manifest observable 

38
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,390
behavior,
mob mob you can make,

39
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,310
I mean that's,
there's a real,

40
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,010
there's a real beauty there.
But,

41
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:08,844
but so the point was that it had to be 
about behavior and then in their terms 

42
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:12,774
of service,
it also had to be about what was 

43
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:14,664
happening on platforms.
So every firewall here of what would 

44
00:02:18,081 --> 00:02:22,920
have been acceptable patrion failed.
And they've put us in a position where,

45
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,023
look,
I told you I called you last Saturday 

46
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:28,080
and when this was really catching fire 
and I said,

47
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:28,943
you know,
Patrion is about 65 to 70% of my rep 

48
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,360
that's,
I have a company now with employees,

49
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,141
you know,
full timers,

50
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:34,974
part timers.
I was actually considering deleting it 

51
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:38,154
right then and there,
which no one in their right mind would 

52
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:41,670
do.
No business person would do.

53
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:43,650
And I've,
I've taken big risks in the past.

54
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:46,380
You know,
before I was on Patrion we were at,

55
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:48,960
or tv I,
me and my producer and my director,

56
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,940
we all quit our jobs,
lost our health insurance,

57
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:52,920
all that to join patriots.
So I'm not,

58
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,530
I like taking risks,
but then I realized,

59
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:56,364
all right,
we have to figure out a plan and that's 

60
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,860
exactly why we're doing this,
right?

61
00:02:58,861 --> 00:02:59,190
Yeah,

62
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,620
yeah.
Well,

63
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,720
and we would have moved faster,
but we,

64
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,003
well,
and I did set up a subscribes to our 

65
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:04,834
account,
although I never quite finished setting 

66
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:07,084
it up,
partly because subscribes star seem to 

67
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:12,010
fall apart almost immediately under 
attack.

68
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,263
And,
and also it wasn't obvious that I also 

69
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:16,114
read the terms of agreement and it 
wasn't obvious that we weren't going to 

70
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:20,200
be just in exactly the same situation 
again.

71
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,453
And there's only so many mistakes you 
can make before the mistakes start to 

72
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:24,814
become fatal.
So we want it to come up with a serious 

73
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:27,930
and,
and,

74
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:28,630
and,
and,

75
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,040
and,
and stable solution.

76
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:33,970
And I have been working on for months,
literally for months,

77
00:03:33,971 --> 00:03:34,804
it's been six months.
I'd been working on a system to allow 

78
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,543
authors and other people who engage 
publicly on intellectually issues to 

79
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,680
interact more effectively with their 
readers and viewers and listeners.

80
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,273
And it occurred to me this week that 
with a bit of modification that that 

81
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:58,600
could serve exactly the function that 
we're hoping it would serve.

82
00:03:58,601 --> 00:03:59,434
So what we're going to try to do as fast
as we possibly can is to set the system 

83
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:06,610
up on a subscriber model that's 
analogous to Patrion.

84
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,560
It'll have a bunch of additional 
features,

85
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:10,090
which I don't want to talk about right 
now,

86
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:12,400
and I don't want to over promise,
but the system is,

87
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,623
is because the system is new,
but we're gonna try to get that rolled 

88
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:20,380
out as fast as we possibly can.
So,

89
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,473
and we have a number of people who are 
interested in hypothetically interested 

90
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,670
in moving their,
their subscription service over to it.

91
00:04:27,671 --> 00:04:32,590
Dave and I are very seriously planning 
to do this as soon as we can do it in an

92
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:34,700
intelligent way.
And so what,

93
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,251
you know,
by the way,

94
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:38,920
one of the interesting things here,
and we haven't talked about this,

95
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:40,930
but I'm guessing you were experiences 
just like mine,

96
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,063
the amount of emails that I have 
received and kind of course tweets and 

97
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:46,870
everything else,
but most of the emails from developers,

98
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,870
from investors,
from regular people,

99
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:52,030
from engineers,
I mean just anyone going,

100
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,073
this is the one,
because you know the issue with all of 

101
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:59,140
these free speech things is it's like 
you don't want to swing too early before

102
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:02,020
you realize that the problem's gotten to
critical mass as,

103
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,300
but then most likely you're going to 
swing too late.

104
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,330
The lines will have so far that we may 
be on the outside of them.

105
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:10,990
And that's why this one I think was so 
interesting because Carl,

106
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,880
you know,
years ago,

107
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:13,893
five or six years ago when I started 
waking up to what was going on with the 

108
00:05:16,211 --> 00:05:18,400
left obviously,
and then all of the free speech stuff,

109
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,510
everyone said you've got to talk to 
Sargon of Akkad easy guide.

110
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,970
So this is the guy that's been ahead of 
all of it.

111
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,300
So are going to was like,
he was big.

112
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,150
He was very helpful to me when I was 
first under attack,

113
00:05:30,151 --> 00:05:33,420
you know,
and he's a brave God and,

114
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,613
and so,
and it's a real mistake what patron has 

115
00:05:36,091 --> 00:05:38,220
done to him.
And as I said,

116
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:41,160
everybody in our network is extremely 
upset about it.

117
00:05:41,161 --> 00:05:43,080
Like we've been sending emails back and 
forth,

118
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,310
well probably with 30 or 40 people.
And so as Dave said earlier,

119
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,323
we wanted to make this video today to 
let everybody that we're communicating 

120
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:56,151
with know that we have not been sleeping
on this front man.

121
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,550
People are trying to figure out what to 
do.

122
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:01,790
So this stops happening and,
and so,

123
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:02,863
and we have a good plan and we're going 
to try to implement it as soon as 

124
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:06,284
possible.
So if I would ask everybody who's 

125
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:08,444
listening to be in a reasonably patient,
imagine that this will take somewhere 

126
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:15,050
between a week and a month to sort out 
properly.

127
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:16,443
We're going to try to get something up 
in the next week hopefully before 

128
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:21,750
Christmas if we can't manage that,
you know,

129
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,900
cause when you implement something like 
this,

130
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,440
there are technical complications that 
might emerge that you don't foresee.

131
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,633
But I don't want people to get the 
impression that we're taking this 

132
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,730
lightly or lying down and that we're not
looking for a,

133
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,300
uh,
a permanent alternative because we are,

134
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:40,790
and I think we can come up with a better
alternative.

135
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,860
And that's the plan.

136
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:43,811
Yeah,
that,

137
00:06:43,811 --> 00:06:44,644
that's exactly what I would say.
I would just add that it was like we 

138
00:06:46,721 --> 00:06:48,340
were,
we were waiting for a moment.

139
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,920
You know,
we've watched these doors slowly closing

140
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:51,880
on us.
All of us,

141
00:06:51,881 --> 00:06:53,590
whether it's twitter,
whether it's facebook,

142
00:06:53,591 --> 00:06:55,300
who's getting banned,
who's getting shadow,

143
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:57,250
banned payment processing,
everything else.

144
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,430
And we are taking this as seriously as 
possible.

145
00:07:00,431 --> 00:07:01,264
Of course,
you know,

146
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,253
Jordan,
who's working harder than anyone on the 

147
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:04,204
face of the planet.
Somehow you manage to also partly build 

148
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:09,240
the platform over the course of the past
year.

149
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,420
And in the middle of all of that,

150
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,343
I knew that this,
we knew that this was lurking in the 

151
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:15,030
background and that this was going to be
a problem.

152
00:07:15,031 --> 00:07:15,864
And Dave,
you've spent lots of time talking to 

153
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,633
investors and developers about building 
alternatives to these platforms that 

154
00:07:22,751 --> 00:07:23,584
seem to be willing to throw their weight
around it and increasingly arbitrary 

155
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,370
manner.
But it's not like it's a simple thing to

156
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,253
do.
People want somebody to say enough is 

157
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:33,331
enough.
And I,

158
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:35,780
I've mentioned this in a live stream I 
did the other day,

159
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:38,080
but you know,
I've watched my patrion dropped.

160
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,630
We've lost around 600 patrons,
I think about 5,000 bucks a month.

161
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:42,464
But in a weird way,
I've actually been inspired by it 

162
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:46,120
because I'm watching.
Yeah,

163
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,063
great for themselves.
So it's like on one hand people are 

164
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:52,460
emailing me and they're saying,
I'm dropping my patronage and I'm really

165
00:07:52,461 --> 00:07:54,740
pissed and it's not about you and I want
to support you.

166
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,630
And on the other hand,
my business side is going,

167
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,520
that's not great.
But yeah,

168
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,350
but we will,
we will solve this thing.

169
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,620
I have nothing.
Anyway.

170
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,040
I've lost a thousand subscribers and I 
feel exactly the same way.

171
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:05,551
It's like,
well,

172
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:08,250
they're telling patron to go to hell.
And you know,

173
00:08:08,251 --> 00:08:11,250
it's,
it's not so good for me on the financial

174
00:08:11,251 --> 00:08:12,084
front,
although that's not too big a 

175
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:16,040
catastrophe at the moment.
They're taking the right stand and,

176
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,670
and encouraging us,
let's say,

177
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:20,490
or encouraging someone to do something 
about this.

178
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:21,600
So anyways,
yeah,

179
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,530
that's what I like.
I like what you said.

180
00:08:23,531 --> 00:08:26,100
If we can just ask you guys to be 
reasonably patient,

181
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,983
we're talking to everybody that you can 
think of and some people that you can't 

182
00:08:29,981 --> 00:08:30,870
think of.
We're,

183
00:08:30,871 --> 00:08:31,780
we're going to fix this.

184
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:32,950
Yeah,
yeah.

185
00:08:32,951 --> 00:08:33,784
Well we're going to,
or at least we're going to do our best 

186
00:08:34,871 --> 00:08:36,880
to fix it.
There's going to be some bumps along the

187
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:37,690
way,
man,

188
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:40,510
because we're now,
we have to speed this process up to,

189
00:08:40,511 --> 00:08:42,730
so you'll have to consider this a Beta 
version,

190
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,920
but at minimum we hope to provide,
uh,

191
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,023
an easy way of switching to a new 
subscription service within the next 

192
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:52,210
very short while.
So,

193
00:08:52,211 --> 00:08:53,044
and thank you everyone for your 
continued patients and your continued 

194
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:57,954
support and your attention.
And your thoughts and your reaction to 

195
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:02,820
all of this and,
and it's,

196
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,880
it's very much appreciated and it does 
help us,

197
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,500
I would say maintain motivation to 
continue doing this constantly.

198
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,810
You know,
the fact that I have all these patrons,

199
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:13,644
subscribers certainly is one of the 
reasons that I tried to put my youtube 

200
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,953
channel.
I wouldn't say first and foremost 

201
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:22,820
because it's had to take a backseat to 
this lecture tour.

202
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,663
But man,
it's way the hell up there on my 

203
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:26,790
priority list.
Absolutely.

204
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,930
And it gives us all sorts of flexibility
to do all sorts of things.

205
00:09:29,931 --> 00:09:32,790
That gave me a little bit of flexibility
to join you on this tour.

206
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:33,624
So I'm incredibly humbled and 
appreciative of everybody that does 

207
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:38,130
that.
Fjord and I will,

208
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:40,560
I will see you in a couple of days in 
west Palm Beach.

209
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,970
He's leading steak.
I will take you out for a steak.

210
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:43,710
Good,
good,

211
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,543
good.
Well I found a good steak place here so 

212
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,810
we will,
I'm looking forward to seeing it.

213
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,820
Dave [inaudible] the tour a cause we're 
going to continue the tour in in uh,

214
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,550

Yup.

215
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,700
Great.

220
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,843
Well,

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,800
not so far,
but,

222

but I have some connections to you log

00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,940
We'll get this up right away.
Great.

225
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,230
Okay.

226
00:10:25,231 --> 00:10:26,064
Bye.
