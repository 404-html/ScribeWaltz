00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,893
Hello everybody,
my name is Angelo and I am your Mc for 

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,360
the evening and uh,
on behalf of the UBC free speech club,

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,553
we would like to welcome you and thank 
you for attending our third Dr Jordan b 

4
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:12,174
Peterson event.

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,750
Thanks.
Now.

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,370
I know you were all very excited to hear
the man,

7
00:00:22,371 --> 00:00:24,980
so I'm going to keep these opening 
remarks very short.

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,413
The UBC free speech club is devoted to 
the sanctity of liberty in our society 

9
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:34,130
and the necessity to keep liberty safe 
from those who want to destroy it within

10
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:34,964
just the York club has grown to over a 
thousand members and is now in the 

11
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:37,784
process of incorporation so that we may 
continue to bring speakers and host 

12
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:42,044
events such as this one.
None of that would be possible without 

13
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:50,060
Dr. Peterson who has inspired countless 
students all over North America to start

14
00:00:50,061 --> 00:00:53,900
speaking up on their campus.
And in fact this club's sprung up around

15
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:58,040
the same time when Dr Peterson publicly 
came out against bill.

16
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:03,041
See 16
now is just over a year ago.

17
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,470
And since then,
his philosophy of cleaning your room and

18
00:01:06,471 --> 00:01:07,304
sorting yourself out has a better than 
influenced the lives of countless 

19
00:01:10,491 --> 00:01:12,980
people.
He's an accomplished psychologist,

20
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:13,843
professor and author.
His book maps of meaning is an 

21
00:01:16,221 --> 00:01:19,160
analytical window into the myths and 
cultures of humankind.

22
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:23,000
And now he's written a new book,
it's called 12 rules for life and had to

23
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:23,834
go to chaos.
And it's available for preorder on 

24
00:01:25,491 --> 00:01:29,270
Amazon with the release date of January 
23rd 2018.

25
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:31,190
And on that note,
uh,

26
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:34,790
on behalf of the UBC free speech club,
we would like to introduce you all to Dr

27
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:35,623
Jordan b Peterson.

28
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,810
Well,
thank you very much for that.

29
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,960
That's,
that's quite something.

30
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,493
Alright,

31
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,001
there's a house,
Mike,

32
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:11,170
Right?
I don't need this one.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,680
Perfect.

34
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,513
Okay.
Well then let's just move it out of the 

35
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:17,370
way,
right?

36
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,853
So I'm going to talk to you tonight 
about the ideological nexus of 

37
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:21,764
postmodernism and Marxism and I want to 
get into it fairly deeply so you can 

38
00:02:27,531 --> 00:02:29,260
have a thoughtful,
thoughtful,

39
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,153
a talk and then discussion afterwards.
So it's a confusing topic because it's 

40
00:02:36,471 --> 00:02:38,960
not obvious by any stretch of the 
imagination.

41
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:41,960
Why postmodernism.
And and neo Marxism,

42
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:46,940
Marxism proper would be aligned because 
postmodernism is an anti grand narrative

43
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:47,774
philosophical movement and Marxism is a 
grand narrative and so the fact that 

44
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:52,694
those two things seem to coexist in the 
same space needs definitely needs some 

45
00:02:55,641 --> 00:02:59,060
explanation and it's a very tricky thing
to get to the bottom of

46
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,803
so we won't get to the bottom of it,
but we'll get farther to the bottom of 

47
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:06,574
it.
Then I've got before and hopefully 

48
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:09,820
farther than many of you have got 
before.

49
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,500
So let's see what we can figure out 
here.

50
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,560
So I'm going to start with some.
Some definitions all returned to them as

51
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:18,690
we continue.
You know,

52
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,533
with philosophical movements,
there are often not named by the major 

53
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,220
thinkers in the movement.
They're sort of named afterwards.

54
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:32,580
The name covers a very large range of 
ideas and actions and perceptions.

55
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,340
Like it's not that easy.
People talk about existentialism,

56
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,100
for example.
It's not that easy to come up with a one

57
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:41,740
paragraph summary of what constitutes 
existentialism.

58
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,450
My sense for the existentialists is that
it's a.

59
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,950
it's,
it's fundamentally a movement.

60
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,930
It's predicated on the idea,
at least in,

61
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,890
in the psychological sense that,
um,

62
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,093
you know,
Freud tended to attribute human 

63
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:58,120
suffering and mental disorder to 
childhood trauma.

64
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,670
Um,
it's more complex than that,

65
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:02,830
but that'll do for,
for a quick overview,

66
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:03,664
but the existentialists thought that 
there was enough suffering intrinsic in 

67
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:10,570
life so that it wasn't insanity.

68
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,310
That was the question.
It was sanity.

69
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,270
It was how it was possible for people to
be saying and,

70
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,393
and,
and,

71
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,180
and let's say normal,
for lack of a better word,

72
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,350
given that there was brutality and 
malevolence intrinsic in life,

73
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:26,590
and the fact that you had to rise up as 
an individual and,

74
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,633
and stand in relation to that 
relationship to that is part and parcel 

75
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:33,454
of what constitutes existentialism.
And there's all sorts of different 

76
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:38,080
people who were thinkers who were 
existentialist.

77
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,273
Some of them atheistic,
some of them deeply religious like 

78
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:44,650
Dostoevsky,
but so it's not.

79
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,753
I'm using that as an example to show you
how difficult it is to bring a set of 

80
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:53,120
thinkers under one umbrella.
You're bound to over simplify,

81
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:53,983
but
we'll go ahead and oversimplify 

82
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,860
postmodernism.
You can think about it as an attitude of

83
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:00,694
skepticism,
irony towards and rejection of grand 

84
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,100
narratives,
ideologies and universalism,

85
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,310
including the idea of the objective,
notions of reason.

86
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,000
That's a big one.
Human Nature.

87
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,550
That's a big one.
Social Progress,

88
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:19,630
absolute truth in objective reality.
All those things being questioned.

89
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,063
Um,
I kinda think of the head joker at the 

90
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,640
top of the postmodern hierarchy as 
Derrida.

91
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,850
Foucault is often mentioned as are a 
number of other people.

92
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,253
Um,
here's some other attributes of 

93
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:34,714
postmodern thinking.
There's a recognition of the existence 

94
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:40,150
of hierarchy,
that's for sure.

95
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,130
And there's an echo of that idea,
the recognition of hierarchy in the term

96
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:48,310
patriarchy because of course patriarchy 
is a recognition of hierarchy.

97
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:50,800
Now it's a very particular kind of 
recognition,

98
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:51,903
but the postmodernists also tend to 
define hierarchy as a consequence of 

99
00:05:57,831 --> 00:06:01,040
power differential.
And so the world day envisioned,

100
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,960
as far as I can tell,
it's something like a,

101
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:06,590
it's a sociologically hobbsy in 
nightmare.

102
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,230
So hobbes thought of the philosopher 
Thomas Hobbes,

103
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:10,064
thought of the natural state of human 
beings as every individual in some 

104
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:14,804
sense,
at the throat of every other individual 

105
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,310
so that the basic state of man,
mankind,

106
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,603
unlike the Rousseau's state of say 
virgin innocence and the Primitive 

107
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:32,021
Garden of paradise was an all out war of
everyone against everyone else and that,

108
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:36,530
that required the imposition of the 
social order to keep peace essentially.

109
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:38,200
So it's a,
it's a fairly dark view of,

110
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,240
of humankind.
Russo on the other hand,

111
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:42,074
we think of people as intrinsically good
and the social order as intrinsically 

112
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,824
tyrannical,
you can actually think about hobbes and 

113
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:49,760
Rousseau in some sense of,
as,

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,833
as,
as opposites that need to be paired 

115
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:56,120
together in order to get a relatively 
comprehensive view of human nature.

116
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,463
Well,
the postmodern view is like the hobbs 

117
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,993
and view in some sense,
except you want to replace the 

118
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:04,590
individual with,
with,

119
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,840
with pyramids of,
of social organization.

120
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:12,800
So hierarchies of social organization 
that are based on group identity,

121
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,053
um,
and that the landscape in which those 

122
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:20,951
pyramids exists is one of unbroken 
enmity and inability to communicate.

123
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,120
So it's a very dark view as far as I'm 
concerned and I.

124
00:07:24,121 --> 00:07:27,080
I think it's fundamentally wrong in many
ways.

125
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:27,914
I mean it,
it's right in that there are groups of 

126
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:30,524
people and there is some difficulty in 
communication between them and that 

127
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:39,440
power is an element in the formation of 
hierarchies,

128
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,500
but you can't reduce hierarchy or group 
relationship to those premises.

129
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,450
It's too simplified because people also 
cooperate.

130
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:51,740
We're also not groups.
Men,

131
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,570
we,
many of us belong to many groups,

132
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:58,780
so it's to the actual situation is far 
too complex to reduce it to that degree,

133
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,693
to reduce it to that degree.
Even though you can come up with a good 

134
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:04,514
explanatory story if you do so,
it doesn't capture the nuances and 

135
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,090
they're not just nuances.
It doesn't capture the essence.

136
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,273
Now,
the thing is is that when you make the 

137
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:18,980
presupposition that the reason that 
hierarchies exist is because of power,

138
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,430
then essentially what you do is turn 
every hierarchy into a tyranny.

139
00:08:22,431 --> 00:08:23,990
And so if you,
if there is a hierarchy,

140
00:08:23,991 --> 00:08:25,490
then you assume it's a tyranny.
Well,

141
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:26,324
that's really the patriarchy.
The Patriarchy is hierarchy assumed as 

142
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:29,804
tyranny,
and that's also just not true except in 

143
00:08:32,031 --> 00:08:35,450
pathological hierarchies.
So for example,

144
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,853
we know from the psychological 
literature that the best predictors of 

145
00:08:39,261 --> 00:08:40,094
longterm life success,
our intelligence and conscientiousness 

146
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,990
in in western countries at least.

147
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,380
Well,
that's what you'd hope for,

148
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,750
right?
More or less,

149
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,013
if you,
if you wanted even just set up a 

150
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:50,414
society,
even if you weren't particularly smart 

151
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:56,400
or hard working,
you might want to set up a society where

152
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,473
intelligence and hard work,
we are good predictors of success 

153
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:02,220
because then the people who were smart 
and hardworking would produce a bunch of

154
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:05,010
things that you could have if you could 
trade for them.

155
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:08,340
And of course that is actually the 
situation that most of us are in.

156
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,490
So,
and of course,

157
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,353
the other thing about people who 
believed that hierarchies in the West 

158
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:15,324
are only composed of power and tyranny,
is that their own actions belie that 

159
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:24,090
because whenever they make a decision to
interact with that hierarchy,

160
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:28,770
they attempt or to make a purchase or,
or to make a trade,

161
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:30,250
let's say,
or to obtain a service,

162
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,910
a service of any importance.

163
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,833
Let's say a medical service,
they are going to definitely act as if 

164
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,023
there are less and more competent people
within that hierarchy and seek out the 

165
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:45,430
ones that are more competent obviously,
but you don't do if the,

166
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,450
if the hierarchy is only composed of 
tyranny and power,

167
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:51,450
there's no point looking for competence.
But anyways,

168
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:53,340
in the west and in functioning 
societies,

169
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,210
hierarchies are basically predicated on 
competence and not power.

170
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,440
And,
and you might say,

171
00:09:58,441 --> 00:09:59,820
well that's pretty naive.
It's like,

172
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:01,380
no,
actually it's not very naive.

173
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,100
Um,
I'm not saying at all that inappropriate

174
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:05,934
powerplays don't play a role in 
corrupting hierarchies of competence 

175
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,253
that happens.
But generally what happens is if the 

176
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,700
hierarchies of competence get corrupted 
enough by power,

177
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:17,070
then they crumble because they can no 
longer function.

178
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,650
So the,
you know,

179
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:22,140
the evidence that are hierarchies of 
competence.

180
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:25,110
Work is everywhere because everything 
around us works all the time.

181
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,163
Ion.
Here's the elite tells to two 

182
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,950
interesting stories in her book,
infidel,

183
00:10:28,951 --> 00:10:31,140
which is a great book by the way.
Um,

184
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,850
she came from Africa and from a country 
that wasn't very functional.

185
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:36,684
And when she came to Holland,
she said there were two things that 

186
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:40,090
really amazed her,
um,

187
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,180
and this really struck me because,
you know,

188
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:43,014
now,
and then you get lucky and you can see 

189
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:47,490
the world you live in from an outsider's
perspective,

190
00:10:47,491 --> 00:10:48,324
right?
You get to see through someone else's 

191
00:10:49,051 --> 00:10:50,430
eyes.
Um,

192
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,323
she said the first thing that knocked 
her off her feet was waiting for a bus 

193
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:55,950
in,
in Amsterdam,

194
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,260
and on the,
you know,

195
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,680
she's standing at the bus stop and 
there's a pole there and there's digital

196
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:02,514
sign on the pole and the digital science
says when the next bus is going to come 

197
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,370
and counts down.
And then when it hits zero,

198
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,200
the bus appears and she,
she just,

199
00:11:10,201 --> 00:11:11,034
she just,
she absolutely could not believe that 

200
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:13,530
that would happen.

201
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,423
That there could be a sign that told you
when the bus would come and that it 

202
00:11:17,821 --> 00:11:20,520
would change and the bus would actually 
appear.

203
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:21,690
And you think,
well,

204
00:11:21,691 --> 00:11:22,560
yeah,
no,

205
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:25,260
that's a miracle man.
That's an absolute miracle.

206
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,280
It is.
It is.

207
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:28,140
You got to think that through,
you know,

208
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:32,400
the amount of timing and organization 
and and and and reliability,

209
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,520
mechanical reliability and sociological 
or social organization and dedication on

210
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:38,934
the part of the bus drivers in the 
entire company and the organization if 

211
00:11:40,921 --> 00:11:41,754
the whole city and the state to make 
that possible is absolutely beyond 

212
00:11:44,911 --> 00:11:46,710
belief,
especially when it's time to,

213
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:51,210
well perhaps not the second but to 10 
seconds or something like that.

214
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:55,720
That is absolutely beyond belief and her
inability to comprehend.

215
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:59,740
That was the correct response.
And then the other things she was amazed

216
00:11:59,741 --> 00:12:03,280
by was that you could go talk to 
policemen and they would help you.

217
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,623
That was just,
that was just a no go for her because 

218
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,613
for her,
her experience was policemen were there 

219
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:14,440
to shake you down and hurt you.
And so you think,

220
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:15,274
well,
you know,

221
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,960
well,
I won't.

222
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:21,140
I won't dwell on that point any longer.
The point is,

223
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:21,974
is that it's absolutely ridiculous blind
to make the assumption that the 

224
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:34,861
hierarchies in functioning Western 
democracies are fundamentally predicated

225
00:12:35,081 --> 00:12:36,900
on power and tyranny.
And then,

226
00:12:36,901 --> 00:12:38,980
you know,
I can use a biological example too,

227
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,940
which would place me outside of the 
postmodern realm of argument because the

228
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,010
postmodernists don't believe in biology,
but,

229
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,070
but they act like they do because they 
all die.

230
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,113
So,

231
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,190
so,
uh,

232
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:00,520
this primatologist named.
Well,

233
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:01,840
I'll tell you two stories.
Okay.

234
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:03,340
Because these are,
these are really useful.

235
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:04,174
So the ones about rats,
and I got this story from Jaak Panksepp 

236
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:07,803
who is a great neuroscientists.
He wrote a book called affective 

237
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:10,594
neuroscience,
which by the way is on my reading list 

238
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,813
that's on my website.
It's a really good book affect of 

239
00:13:15,101 --> 00:13:16,720
neuroscience.
He's a great scientist.

240
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,980
He was one of the people who he learned 
that he learned that rats laugh.

241
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:21,933
They laugh out ultrasonically like bat.
So if you're gonna you take a look with 

242
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:26,380
a pencil eraser,
they laugh,

243
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,243
but you have to record it and then slow 
it down and then you can hear them and 

244
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:31,090
you might think,
well,

245
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:31,990
rats laugh,
like,

246
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,970
who wants to eat?
Get a grant for that.

247
00:13:33,971 --> 00:13:35,410
What kind of idiocy is that?
It's like,

248
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:35,981
no,
no,

249
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:36,761
no.
Just don't,

250
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:38,770
don't,
don't get ahead of yourself here,

251
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,710
you know,
he was showing that,

252
00:13:40,711 --> 00:13:44,050
that that capacity for social 
interaction,

253
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,913
for social interaction that was mediated
by physiological touch activated the 

254
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,660
same,
excuse me,

255
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,753
activated the same circuits in rats,
that it doesn't people and that those 

256
00:13:58,331 --> 00:14:02,410
are actual biological circuits,
and we share them even with rats.

257
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,300
Now,
rats are quite similar to human beings.

258
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:09,010
As it turns out,
I could say especially postmodernists,

259
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:09,844
but I won't.

260
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:13,670
And uh,
and,

261
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,490
and so the fact that,
that,

262
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,353
you know,
the little rats giggle when you tickle 

263
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:19,990
them is actually extraordinarily 
important.

264
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,260
He also identified
surprising.

265
00:14:25,841 --> 00:14:26,674
I've been talking too much lately.
He also identified the primary place 

266
00:14:31,381 --> 00:14:32,214
circuit and mammals.
And that's a big deal too from a 

267
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,850
scientific perspective.
That's like discovering a new continent,

268
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,180
like discovering a whole brain system 
that people really didn't know existed.

269
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,850
That's a big deal.
So here's a little story about rats.

270
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,300
Young rats like to engage in rough and 
tumble play,

271
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:49,690
especially juvenile males.
It's also the case for puppies.

272
00:14:49,691 --> 00:14:52,010
If you've ever had a puppy,
dogs are like that.

273
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:52,844
They liked to wrestle and it's one of 
the things that male human beings tend 

274
00:14:56,241 --> 00:14:58,040
to do with their offspring and it's a 
really,

275
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:58,874
really good thing like rough and tumble 
play with children really helps 

276
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:02,434
socialize them because it helps them 
figure out the difference between touch 

277
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,323
and even rough touch and pain because 
one of the things you're doing when 

278
00:15:10,881 --> 00:15:13,010
you're rough and tumble playing with the
little kid is you know,

279
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:14,810
you throw them up in the air and you're 
wrestling around.

280
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:15,883
I built my.
I had two couches when my kids were 

281
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,374
little that were sort of face to face,
so we built this little wrestling ring 

282
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:23,990
and I used to go in there and pound them
half to death every night.

283
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,670
You know,
so they love that.

284
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:28,730
I mean they get so excited about that.
They love that so much.

285
00:15:28,731 --> 00:15:29,564
It's just crazy.
But the reason for that is like you're 

286
00:15:31,401 --> 00:15:32,234
stretching out their bodies and you're 
showing them that they can't put their 

287
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:37,900
thumb in your eye and you're teaching 
them to be graceful and,

288
00:15:37,901 --> 00:15:38,734
and,
and you're teaching them the difference 

289
00:15:40,221 --> 00:15:44,090
between something new that's happening 
to the body and something painful.

290
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,043
You're really teaching them to dance and
it's this really complicated 

291
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:48,794
physiological dance that,
that is indicative of a socialized 

292
00:15:51,981 --> 00:15:54,650
being.
That's partly why women like men who can

293
00:15:54,651 --> 00:15:55,900
dance by the way,
um,

294
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,090
because it shows that you can pay 
attention to someone else first of all,

295
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,933
that you're coordinated,
but even more importantly that you can 

296
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:03,404
take the fact of your coordination and 
coordinate that with someone else's 

297
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:07,634
coordination.

298
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,953
So,
and that's very primal and 

299
00:16:09,771 --> 00:16:10,604
physiological.
It's built right into your body and 

300
00:16:12,561 --> 00:16:14,600
rough and tumble play helps without a 
lot.

301
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,170
Anyways.
Rats also like too rough and tumble play

302
00:16:18,171 --> 00:16:22,730
for much the same reasons and sort of 
sort of pretty much all social mammals.

303
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,773
So you can tell that rats like it.
See how do you know if a rat likes 

304
00:16:26,711 --> 00:16:27,410
something?
Well,

305
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:28,243
he'll work for it.
And one of the ways you can figure out 

306
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:31,880
if a rat wants to work for something is 
that,

307
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,030
you know,
you get them in a state where maybe he's

308
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,953
desperate for whatever he's working for 
and you can put a little spring on them 

309
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,760
and figure out how hardy poles to go 
somewhere.

310
00:16:40,761 --> 00:16:41,594
He knows where he's going to get that 
and then you can measure the force that 

311
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:44,624
he's willing to apply and that gives you
a rough estimate of his motivation or 

312
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:49,670
maybe ask the bar press like a,
you know,

313
00:16:49,671 --> 00:16:50,504
like a cocaine addicted rats to,
to receive the reward and you can count 

314
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:55,484
rate of bar pressing and you can get an 
estimate of how excited the route is to 

315
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,750
go do whatever it is the rats going to 
do.

316
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,583
And so panksepp used to put rats in,
pair them one riot against the other in 

317
00:17:06,141 --> 00:17:09,980
kind of a play arena,
not a very big thing and uh,

318
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,000
and the juvenile males and they would 
work to do that.

319
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,320
Okay.
So they liked it.

320
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:18,950
And then maybe one rat was 10 percent 
bigger than the other.

321
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,053
And then when you paired them,
the big rat would beat the little rat 

322
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,880
because 10 percent weight advantage was 
enough to make the bigger rep dominant.

323
00:17:25,881 --> 00:17:26,714
Okay.
So then they established basically 

324
00:17:27,651 --> 00:17:28,484
dominance and submission.
You might think about that as a power 

325
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:32,390
relationship.
And to some degree it is,

326
00:17:32,391 --> 00:17:35,240
but it's more complicated than that.
And this is very important.

327
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:40,241
So,
so the rats play together once and the a

328
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,930
big route pins the little rat really 
very much like wrestling,

329
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,360
like rats wrestle,
just like people wrestle 'em.

330
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:53,020
And if you pair them together,
then the big rat campaign,

331
00:17:53,021 --> 00:17:53,801
the little rat,
okay.

332
00:17:53,801 --> 00:17:56,740
So now you got dominant rats,
subordinate rat,

333
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,720
roughly speaking.
And,

334
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,920
but then you see if you stop the 
experiment there you'd think,

335
00:18:02,921 --> 00:18:05,320
well the rats play to establish 
dominance and submission.

336
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,530
But the thing is is that rats don't just
play once,

337
00:18:08,531 --> 00:18:09,370
they played many,
many,

338
00:18:09,371 --> 00:18:10,204
many times.
And that's also the case with human 

339
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:15,430
beings is that you don't just play once,
you play many,

340
00:18:15,431 --> 00:18:16,264
many times and there is a difference 
between the rules of a game and the 

341
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:23,620
rules of a set of games.
And that's so unbelievably important.

342
00:18:23,621 --> 00:18:25,450
So you keep that in mind because we'll 
return to that.

343
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,660
So anyways,
the next time the two rats get together,

344
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,230
the little rat house to ask the big 
route to play because the rule basically

345
00:18:32,231 --> 00:18:35,560
is subordinate entity asks dominant 
entity to play.

346
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,870
And so the little rat does what mammals 
do to play,

347
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:42,850
you know,
they kind of put their paws down and put

348
00:18:42,851 --> 00:18:44,980
the rear end up,
bit up in the air.

349
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,680
You see dogs do that.
And unless you're completely clueless,

350
00:18:47,681 --> 00:18:48,514
you know that,
that doesn't mean he's going for your 

351
00:18:49,751 --> 00:18:50,584
throat,
means he wants you to whack them on the 

352
00:18:52,271 --> 00:18:54,670
side of the head so he can sort of 
pretend to bite you.

353
00:18:54,671 --> 00:18:55,530
You know,
it's,

354
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,750
it's pretty obvious if you've played 
with dogs and children.

355
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,550
So,
um,

356
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,733
yeah.
And I make that comparison because dogs 

357
00:19:02,711 --> 00:19:04,330
and children understand each other,
right?

358
00:19:04,331 --> 00:19:07,180
They're pack animals,
they followed the same basic rules.

359
00:19:07,181 --> 00:19:09,070
They know how to play.
They can become friends,

360
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,750
otherwise you wouldn't have them as 
pets.

361
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,370
I mean the dogs,
not the children.

362
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,850
Um,
so anyways,

363
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,620
the little rat asks the big role to play
in big rep thing.

364
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,211
So yeah.
Yeah.

365
00:19:19,211 --> 00:19:20,210
Okay.
Are they will play,

366
00:19:20,211 --> 00:19:22,840
they wrestle and you pair them multiple 
times.

367
00:19:22,841 --> 00:19:24,430
Well,
if you compare them multiple times,

368
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:27,030
what you find is the less the big rat 
lets the little rat win,

369
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:27,873
30 percent of the time the little rat 
won't ask the big rat to play anymore 

370
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,080
and that you think,
well,

371
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:34,120
who cares what?
Like why is that important?

372
00:19:34,121 --> 00:19:35,770
It's like,
it's really important.

373
00:19:35,771 --> 00:19:39,270
That's a really important discovery 
because it shows you that the,

374
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,293
that even rats have a set set a sense of
fair play that emerges across iterated 

375
00:19:44,441 --> 00:19:45,640
games.
It's,

376
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:46,563
it's,
it's inevitable.

377
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:50,230
It's evidence for the biological 
instantiation of a social morality.

378
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,940
It's a big deal,
man.

379
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:54,010
That's a big discovery.
And,

380
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,710
and it shows you that even at the level 
of rats,

381
00:19:56,711 --> 00:19:59,210
they're very social animals by the way.
Um,

382
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,173
the interactions between rats are,
are mediated by something like a sense 

383
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,220
of fairness or justice.

384
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,480
And so that's extremely cool because,
you know,

385
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,383
we tend to think of animals as having 
dominance hierarchies and that's 

386
00:20:12,521 --> 00:20:14,380
predicated on power.
And that idea,

387
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:17,380
even though the bloody postmodernists 
don't believe in biology,

388
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,900
they extend that analogy up to human 
beings.

389
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,390
It's just not true.
Okay?

390
00:20:22,391 --> 00:20:23,270
Well,
at the same time,

391
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,120
turns out to be true with chimpanzees.
So Frans de Waal,

392
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,720
who's a,
a Dutch primatologist,

393
00:20:28,721 --> 00:20:29,554
a very smart one too.
He's been interested in the biological 

394
00:20:31,451 --> 00:20:33,380
basis of morality as well.
Um,

395
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,380
and he really,
he's written a lot of good books on,

396
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,820
on,
on primate behavior.

397
00:20:36,821 --> 00:20:39,220
Chimps in particular.
Chimps are brutal creatures,

398
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,180
man.
Like they go to war a.

399
00:20:41,181 --> 00:20:45,250
and so if you have a chimp territory out
in the jungle,

400
00:20:45,251 --> 00:20:48,850
then the juveniles will,
the males in particular,

401
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,770
the band together in groups of four or 
five.

402
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,440
There's often but not always a female or
two with them.

403
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,693
And if they come across chimps from 
another troupe that aren't within their 

404
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,790
hierarchy,
let's say they will,

405
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,500
if they're,
if they outnumber them because they,

406
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:03,334
they can't really count,
but they can estimate magnitude 

407
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:07,270
visually.
It's not the same as counting.

408
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,310
Um,
but if they outnumber them,

409
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:10,144
they will tear them to pieces.
And chimps serve at least twice as 

410
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:15,670
strong as a really well developed human 
male.

411
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,600
And so they can tear you up pretty good.
And chimps are perfectly capable.

412
00:21:19,601 --> 00:21:23,080
They hunt,
they're carnivorous like human beings.

413
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,270
And they hunt,
they hunt colobus monkeys,

414
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:26,104
often they weigh about 40 pounds and 
they'll basically eat them alive at the 

415
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,460
monkey screaming away like mad because 
you know it's in pain because it's being

416
00:21:33,461 --> 00:21:37,210
eaten and that doesn't slow the chimps 
down a bit.

417
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,810
There's no cross species empathy 
stopping them from having their snack.

418
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,213
And so chimps are very brutal creatures 
and it isn't obvious they have a lot of 

419
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:49,420
internal inhibition of the regression at
all.

420
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:53,530
Most of the inhibition is sociological.
It's out in the hierarchy.

421
00:21:53,531 --> 00:21:54,364
And so the reason chimps aren't always 
aggressive with one another is because 

422
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,993
they know who can pound them and and who
will gang up on them and who won't be 

423
00:22:00,701 --> 00:22:04,660
established their hierarchy anyways.
You know,

424
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,290
you think about a champ hierarchy and 
you're talking about a fairly strong and

425
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,630
aggressive creature.
You might think it's biggest,

426
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:12,220
ugliest,
meanest,

427
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,310
most vicious,
irritable,

428
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:19,780
unpleasant chimp that rises to the top.
But all that's kind of the postmodernist

429
00:22:19,781 --> 00:22:22,540
view of human society.
But that's not the case.

430
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:23,374
It happens sometimes.
But what happens in has documented this 

431
00:22:26,321 --> 00:22:27,154
quite nicely,
is that tyron chimps lead unstable 

432
00:22:30,551 --> 00:22:32,050
regimes.
Now,

433
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,043
you know,
that might sound familiar because the 

434
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:38,020
same thing of course is true human 
beings and why is that?

435
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:39,280
Well,
it's because you know,

436
00:22:39,281 --> 00:22:40,114
people don't like tyrants and chimps 
don't like them that much either and 

437
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,740
chimps are actually quite reciprocal and
their social interaction,

438
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:47,500
so they don't just dominate each other.

439
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,570
They groom each other,
they have friendships,

440
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,493
they can track social relationships over
very long periods of time now and they 

441
00:22:54,371 --> 00:22:58,870
do that and so they engage in reciprocal
interactions,

442
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,770
let's say prosocial reciprocal 
interactions and you might think,

443
00:23:02,771 --> 00:23:06,790
well what's the,
what's the weak point of the biggest,

444
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:08,950
ugliest,
toughest chimp in the troop?

445
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,100
And that is he doesn't have any friends.
And so,

446
00:23:12,101 --> 00:23:12,934
you know,
maybe as a bad day he's a little hung 

447
00:23:15,281 --> 00:23:19,840
over or whatever for meeting fermented 
bananas or whatever is partying with and

448
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,650
to have the slightly less ugly,
slightly less mean.

449
00:23:23,651 --> 00:23:24,484
Chimps decide,
well this is a good time to take them 

450
00:23:25,991 --> 00:23:26,824
out and they tear them to pieces.
And so one of the things do all his 

451
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:31,444
pointed out quite nicely is that if you 
want to have a stable chimp dominance 

452
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,790
hierarchy,
let's call it a regime,

453
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,070
the stable ones aren't ruled by the 
tyrants tyrants get taken out by,

454
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,970
by paired up friendship dyad,
something like that.

455
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,950
So that's really worth thinking about 
too,

456
00:23:48,951 --> 00:23:50,570
you know,
because

457
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:55,463
because it indicates that even in 
creatures that have less complex 

458
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,633
sociological orders and they do because 
one of the things that predicts how 

459
00:24:03,841 --> 00:24:04,674
complex your social order is,
how big your brain is compared to your 

460
00:24:07,051 --> 00:24:09,300
body,
it's encephalization essentially.

461
00:24:09,301 --> 00:24:10,134
And the more encephalitis creature,
the larger the social groups that 

462
00:24:12,901 --> 00:24:13,734
contract.
And of course human beings are very 

463
00:24:14,731 --> 00:24:17,220
highly encephalitis.
So we have quite complicated group,

464
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,273
um,
we have quite complicated group 

465
00:24:19,951 --> 00:24:20,784
organizations,
but even in simpler group organizations 

466
00:24:23,311 --> 00:24:27,190
like the chimps,
it isn't the tyrant who rule stable.

467
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:30,900
And that turns out to be also incredibly
important.

468
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,240
Okay.
So,

469
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:33,973
so,
so much for the idea that power is the 

470
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:37,650
only game in town.
Then you got to ask.

471
00:24:37,651 --> 00:24:39,240
The question is,
well,

472
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,750
this is actually a postmodern question.
So you know,

473
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:43,823
one of the things Derek just said that 
the main postmodern joker is that by 

474
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:50,080
categorizing you,
you,

475
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:50,943
you privilege one concept and you,
you force other concepts out to the 

476
00:24:54,241 --> 00:24:55,074
margins.

477
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,160
And so he believed that when you 
constructed a hierarchy of power,

478
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,770
that the hierarchy of power,
privilege,

479
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:05,040
certain people and marginalized others,
and you know,

480
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:09,060
that's really not that brilliant 
observation as far as I'm concerned.

481
00:25:09,061 --> 00:25:12,300
It's rather commonplace.
All it means is that when you categorize

482
00:25:12,301 --> 00:25:13,134
something that there are things that are
in the category and whole bunch of 

483
00:25:15,301 --> 00:25:16,134
things that aren't.
And so you actually can't categorize 

484
00:25:18,121 --> 00:25:20,250
anything,
which means you can't perceive anything,

485
00:25:20,251 --> 00:25:21,084
which means you can't think or live 
without making some things in the 

486
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,910
middle.
And everything else on the outside.

487
00:25:26,911 --> 00:25:27,744
It's part of categorization itself.
And so maybe the postmodernist would go 

488
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:34,890
far enough to question the utility of 
categorization itself.

489
00:25:34,891 --> 00:25:37,050
And I think to some degree they do do 
that.

490
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,153
But,
um,

491
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:42,330
the point here is that
if you,

492
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,120
you have to ask why it is that you 
would,

493
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,013
if you were a postmodernist yourself,
why it is that you would privilege the 

494
00:25:56,351 --> 00:25:57,184
idea of power above all else.
It's exactly what is it that you're 

495
00:25:59,651 --> 00:26:03,190
pushing to the margin.
And so that's something that we're going

496
00:26:03,191 --> 00:26:04,210
to talk about.
Now,

497
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,220
here's one thing you might push to the 
margin.

498
00:26:06,221 --> 00:26:11,221
Let's say that you believe that 
hierarchies are a consequence of power.

499
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,263
Well then you push competence to the 
margin and then applying the postmodern 

500
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,340
mark modernist logic,
you might say,

501
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,353
well,
the reason you're privileging power is 

502
00:26:20,651 --> 00:26:24,250
so that you can produce so that you can 
push competence to the margin.

503
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,490
And so you want to keep that in mind 
too,

504
00:26:27,491 --> 00:26:30,760
because that's going to become important
as we discussed the relationship between

505
00:26:30,761 --> 00:26:31,594
postmodernism and Marxism.
Maybe you're after the destruction of 

506
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,190
the idea of competence itself.

507
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,090
All right,
so postmoderns,

508
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,610
and we talked about it a little bit.
We'll return to it.

509
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,500
Now we're going to talk a little bit 
about Marxism.

510
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,020
I've got a quote here from mark's.
The proletarians have nothing to lose,

511
00:26:52,021 --> 00:26:54,400
but they're changed.
Uh,

512
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,040
well.
That was pretty good for like 18,

513
00:26:56,041 --> 00:26:57,810
80 or 80,
90 or whenever it was.

514
00:26:57,811 --> 00:26:58,644
He wrote it.
Somewhere around that period of time it 

515
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,613
turned out the proletarians had a lot 
more to lose the interchange they had 

516
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:04,644
their lives and their families to lose.
That was demonstrated amply as a 

517
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:10,980
consequence of the,
what would you call it,

518
00:27:10,981 --> 00:27:11,814
the sociological movements that were put
into place when the Marxist 

519
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:19,650
presuppositions began to govern 
societies like the Soviet Union.

520
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,270
So,
all right,

521
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,690
so let's take the same postmodernist 
approach.

522
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:30,470
So here's some basic tenants of Marxism.
It's Berge Lousy against proletariat.

523
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,460
The bridge was the year,
the capitalists,

524
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:34,680
the property owners,
those sorts of people,

525
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,630
the proletariat,
the working class,

526
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,520
for all intents and purposes.

527
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:43,230
The basic idea is that history itself is
nothing but the,

528
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,010
what would you call it?
The documentation of the struggle of one

529
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:50,490
class against the other.
Okay.

530
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,430
No,
that's wrong,

531
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,820
but it's okay because it's too simple,
obviously.

532
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,013
It's obviously too simple.
There's all sorts of motivations that 

533
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:02,590
people have.
Some of them are economic,

534
00:28:02,591 --> 00:28:07,140
some of them are associated with power,
but that's okay.

535
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,993
We will leave that.
Let's let's give the devil his due and 

536
00:28:09,391 --> 00:28:09,841
say,
well,

537
00:28:09,841 --> 00:28:10,591
yeah,
fair enough.

538
00:28:10,591 --> 00:28:13,620
There is still a fair bit of tension 
between the haves and the haves and have

539
00:28:13,621 --> 00:28:17,400
nots and maybe that was even more 
intense in previous societies than it is

540
00:28:17,401 --> 00:28:18,390
now.
And it's no,

541
00:28:18,391 --> 00:28:20,760
there's no doubt that economics plays a 
role in,

542
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:24,330
in virtually everything that human 
beings do in a fairly significant role.

543
00:28:24,331 --> 00:28:25,164
So let,
let's,

544
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,380
let's accept that as a potential theory.
It's,

545
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,840
it's simple,
but maybe it's practically useful.

546
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,090
And then there's kind of an offshoot of 
that theory,

547
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:34,110
which is that,
well,

548
00:28:34,111 --> 00:28:34,944
if you're a Marxist,
that means you have sympathy for the 

549
00:28:36,451 --> 00:28:37,350
working class.
Right?

550
00:28:37,351 --> 00:28:38,970
Because that's what you're saying all 
the time.

551
00:28:38,971 --> 00:28:39,781
It's like,
well,

552
00:28:39,781 --> 00:28:41,670
the poor working class,
they're all oppressed.

553
00:28:41,671 --> 00:28:43,800
The poor,
poor proletariat,

554
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,900
you know.
And then you're also saying,

555
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:46,734
well,
we're the good guys because we're 

556
00:28:47,821 --> 00:28:48,654
standing on the side of the oppressed.
And so then you might also ask what 

557
00:28:51,511 --> 00:28:54,450
you're marginalizing when you claim that
you're the good guys,

558
00:28:54,451 --> 00:28:55,284
because one of the things that you would
be marginalizing is all of the ways in 

559
00:28:57,721 --> 00:29:01,320
which you're not the good guys,
but we can leave that aside for a moment

560
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:02,430
too.
So,

561
00:29:02,431 --> 00:29:05,060
but there's the claims is that,
you know,

562
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,680
there's the working class against the 
ruling class.

563
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:09,523
Another claim is the ruling class is the
ruined class because they exploit the 

564
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,200
working class basically stealing their 
excess labor from them.

565
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,820
Um,
another very,

566
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:18,990
very,
uh,

567
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,160
what,
uh,

568
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,800
surfacely attractive claim that lacks 
any reasonable justification,

569
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,953
you know,
because it's predicated on the idea of 

570
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:32,874
the world as a zero sum game.
And clearly the world is not a zero sum 

571
00:29:35,701 --> 00:29:38,070
game.
So when someone creates wealth,

572
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:41,470
when someone is wealthy,
it can be at least at times because they

573
00:29:41,471 --> 00:29:42,304
created it,
not because they swiped it from someone 

574
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:44,680
else.
I think,

575
00:29:44,681 --> 00:29:46,810
you know,
you can think of someone like Bill Gates

576
00:29:46,811 --> 00:29:50,190
or Steve Jobs is a good example of that.
Um,

577
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:51,671
you know,
they're,

578
00:29:51,671 --> 00:29:56,671
they're what they produced pad to value 
that far exceeded what they garnered.

579
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:57,754
As a consequence of their production,
even though what they garnered was 

580
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,990
fairly substantial.
So anyways,

581
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:03,100
but we'll get,
like you said,

582
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:04,840
we're going to give the devil his due.
Okay.

583
00:30:04,841 --> 00:30:05,674
It's the bourgeoisie against the 
proletariat will accept that it's class 

584
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:11,290
warfare is the primary historical mover.

585
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,153
No problem now,
but here's what I'm not willing to give 

586
00:30:14,831 --> 00:30:16,810
away so easily.
Uh,

587
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,033
we have sympathy for the working class 
primarily and we're good because of 

588
00:30:22,181 --> 00:30:23,530
that.
Now I'm not gonna.

589
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,230
Just give that away.
So simply.

590
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,243
So let's investigate that a little bit.
Let's see if we can actually figure it 

591
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,160
out.
If that's true.

592
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:35,670
We'll say a use a pragmatic approach 
because I'm a pragmatist in that William

593
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:37,923
James,
Sansa,

594
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,230
um,
uh,

595
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:43,720
or maybe you can think about even more 
deeply in anciently.

596
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:44,554
Uh,
there's a statement in the New 

597
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,200
Testament,
I think it's by their fruits,

598
00:30:47,201 --> 00:30:51,160
you shall know the fine.
So we're going to walk down that road

599
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,493
before we do that.
So now that's another thing you have to 

600
00:30:54,851 --> 00:30:56,230
keep in mind.
Before we do that,

601
00:30:56,231 --> 00:30:58,930
I want to make one more detour.
Okay?

602
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:02,050
So I like making detours and then 
tangling the oil back together,

603
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,183
so I want to give you a bit of a history
of theories of suffering and I'm going 

604
00:31:07,691 --> 00:31:08,524
to compare the Marxist theory of 
suffering to the Judeo Christian theory 

605
00:31:11,741 --> 00:31:14,370
of suffering and the Judeo Christian 
would be.

606
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,203
And the reason I'm doing that is because
I think the Judeo Christian theory of 

607
00:31:17,651 --> 00:31:21,610
suffering is actually one of the 
foundation stones of our entire culture.

608
00:31:21,611 --> 00:31:25,180
And so it actually matters why you think
they're suffering.

609
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:30,310
And so the story that describes the 
entry of suffering into the world,

610
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,160
that mythological story is the story in 
Genesis,

611
00:31:33,161 --> 00:31:33,994
the story of Adam and eve and basically 
what happens in the story of Adam and 

612
00:31:36,551 --> 00:31:37,384
Eve as Adam and Eve are unconscious to 
begin with and they're sort of in this 

613
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:44,020
paradise will state there's no death or 
at least there's no knowledge of death.

614
00:31:44,021 --> 00:31:48,970
There's also no knowledge of self.
And then eats the apple that the serpent

615
00:31:48,971 --> 00:31:53,971
gives her and the scales fall from her 
eyes and she gives the apple to Adam and

616
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:57,910
he eats it as well.
So she makes him self conscious.

617
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:58,893
They both wake up,
the first thing that happens is they 

618
00:32:00,281 --> 00:32:03,760
realize that they're naked and they 
cover themselves up,

619
00:32:03,761 --> 00:32:04,594
and the second thing that happens as a 
consequence of that realization is that 

620
00:32:06,971 --> 00:32:07,804
they come to know the difference between
good and evil and I mean that's an 

621
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:11,973
insanely complicated story that's 
dealing with a re absolutely in 

622
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:20,380
comprehensible number of complex 
phenomena simultaneously,

623
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:21,214
but it basically goes something like 
this is that to be aware that you're 

624
00:32:26,051 --> 00:32:26,884
naked is to be aware of your fragility 
and your mortality when when you have a 

625
00:32:32,381 --> 00:32:34,630
nightmare about being naked in front of 
a crowd,

626
00:32:34,631 --> 00:32:36,940
it means that you're exposed to the 
crowd.

627
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,160
All your flaws,
all your mortal vulnerability is exposed

628
00:32:40,161 --> 00:32:42,710
to the crowd,
for for for them to see,

629
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:45,260
for you to be ashamed of,
for them to judge.

630
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:46,603
That's partly why we're all close.
That's partly why human being a human 

631
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:53,120
white clothing is a human universal.
There's many human universals,

632
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:55,040
by the way,
clothing is one of them,

633
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,170
although it's used for many different 
purposes,

634
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,453
so Adam and eve cover themselves up and 
so because they've realized that 

635
00:33:01,251 --> 00:33:03,320
they're,
that they're vulnerable,

636
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:05,570
they're naked and vulnerable.
That self consciousness,

637
00:33:05,571 --> 00:33:06,404
human beings are self conscious animals.
We're really the only self conscious 

638
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:10,454
animals.
Other animals have the glimmerings of 

639
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:13,904
self consciousness.
Some of them can identify themselves in 

640
00:33:15,921 --> 00:33:17,090
a mirror,
for example,

641
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,953
but we have whole theories of ourselves.
We have whole articulated verbal and 

642
00:33:22,071 --> 00:33:22,904
philosophical theories of what a human 
being is and what we each are as 

643
00:33:25,901 --> 00:33:26,490
individual.

644
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:29,150
So really those aren't in the same 
conceptual universe.

645
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,930
It's a whole different.
It's a qualitatively different issue.

646
00:33:32,931 --> 00:33:35,240
In the case of human beings were self 
conscious,

647
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,210
selfconsciousness loads on trait,
neuroticism,

648
00:33:38,211 --> 00:33:39,044
technically speaking,
which means that self consciousness is 

649
00:33:40,821 --> 00:33:41,654
primarily something that manifests 
itself in the form of negative emotion 

650
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:47,540
and we all know that you're onstage.
You get self conscious.

651
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,850
Is that a good thing?
No.

652
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:52,250
You can give.
So self conscious that your tongue tied,

653
00:33:52,251 --> 00:33:53,150
right?
It's not good.

654
00:33:53,151 --> 00:33:53,984
You don't want to be self conscious 
onstage or maybe ever you get self 

655
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,720
conscious in the in the face of someone 
you're trying to impress.

656
00:33:59,721 --> 00:34:01,340
He turned all red.
You Stammer.

657
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,373
It's like self consciousness is a rough 
business and it's no wonder because you 

658
00:34:05,151 --> 00:34:05,984
know yourself for the for the fragile 
fool that you are and it's even worse 

659
00:34:09,561 --> 00:34:13,220
than that because see,
it took me a long time to figure out why

660
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:14,203
it was that when Adam and eve woke up,
they also develop the knowledge of good 

661
00:34:16,881 --> 00:34:17,390
and evil.

662
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:19,940
I just couldn't figure that out because 
it didn't make sense to me.

663
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:20,983
Why?
How selfconsciousness knowledge of 

664
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:23,624
vulnerability and the knowledge of good 
and evil we're tangled together or even 

665
00:34:27,351 --> 00:34:29,240
really what the knowledge of good and 
evil meant,

666
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,550
but I figured it out.
Eventually I thought,

667
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,271
oh,
I get it.

668
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:35,090
I get it.
It was like a real revelation to me.

669
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,720
As soon as you know you're vulnerable,
you know the difference between good and

670
00:34:38,721 --> 00:34:39,554
evil,
because as soon as you know you're 

671
00:34:40,761 --> 00:34:42,680
vulnerable,
then you know everyone else is.

672
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,320
And as soon as you know that everyone 
else is vulnerable,

673
00:34:45,321 --> 00:34:46,154
you know how to hurt them.
And so that means you consciously know 

674
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:54,650
how to bring suffering into being and 
that's the knowledge of good and evil.

675
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:57,860
And you know that because let's say that
you're really good at torturing people,

676
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,753
hadn't,
there's no doubt a number of people in 

677
00:34:59,871 --> 00:35:00,704
the audience who are actually quite good
at that and maybe you all have a bit of 

678
00:35:03,441 --> 00:35:05,520
an affinity for it.
Um,

679
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,273
if you're married,
I'm sure your partner would testify to 

680
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:09,674
that.

681
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:15,680
So if you're going to hurt someone,
what do you think essentially is,

682
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:17,510
okay,
what would really hurt me?

683
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:18,441
Then you think,
well,

684
00:35:18,441 --> 00:35:19,970
I'll just do that to them.
And it's like,

685
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,601
that's,
that's,

686
00:35:20,601 --> 00:35:22,580
that's a,
that's a good theory.

687
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:25,810
It's a very sophisticated.
So anyways,

688
00:35:25,811 --> 00:35:26,391
so,
okay,

689
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:27,620
so what happens?
Adam and eve,

690
00:35:27,621 --> 00:35:29,480
wake up,
they weren't supposed to do this.

691
00:35:29,481 --> 00:35:32,000
God told them that they are going to be 
sorry if they did that,

692
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,163
but they did it anyways because that's 
what people are like and because we 

693
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,183
learn things that knock us out of our 
present paradises we're curious and we 

694
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:46,490
won't leave things alone and maybe 
things are not so bad and then you,

695
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:49,530
you know,
ask some questions that maybe you're not

696
00:35:49,531 --> 00:35:50,364
so happy about asking.
Once you find the answer and you fall 

697
00:35:52,711 --> 00:35:53,544
out of your little paradise into history
and you gotta work to set things right 

698
00:35:56,491 --> 00:35:58,060
again.
Anyways,

699
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,333
God gets wind of this and,
and he chases Adam and eve out of the 

700
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,930
garden of Eden,

701
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:09,780
but he said some interesting things when
he chases them out,

702
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:10,620
he says,
all right,

703
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:16,080
now you know,
what's the consequences of that?

704
00:36:16,081 --> 00:36:16,831
And he says,
Dad,

705
00:36:16,831 --> 00:36:19,190
if you're going to have to work.
Oh,

706
00:36:19,191 --> 00:36:20,800
that's cool.
That's really cool.

707
00:36:20,801 --> 00:36:22,160
Well,
he is God after all.

708
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:23,600
It also,
he,

709
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,640
he's.
He knows what he's talking about.

710
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,220
He says,
you're going to have to work.

711
00:36:28,221 --> 00:36:31,490
So why would you have to work now that 
you knew you were vulnerable?

712
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,140
Well,
the answer to that is,

713
00:36:33,141 --> 00:36:34,340
well,
if you know you're vulnerable,

714
00:36:34,341 --> 00:36:37,250
that stretches out into the future,
you know you're going to die,

715
00:36:37,251 --> 00:36:38,084
you know that you're fragile.
It's like maybe all your problems are 

716
00:36:40,941 --> 00:36:42,530
solved right now.
You're all sitting here,

717
00:36:42,531 --> 00:36:43,910
you're safe,
you're not hungry,

718
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:47,960
you don't want anything to drink,
etc. But what about tomorrow?

719
00:36:47,961 --> 00:36:50,780
What about next week or next month or 10
years from now?

720
00:36:50,781 --> 00:36:51,614
It's like,
just because you got all your problems 

721
00:36:52,391 --> 00:36:53,224
solved for this second doesn't mean 
you've got them solved for the rest of 

722
00:36:56,241 --> 00:36:58,130
your iterations through time.

723
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,733
So you got to work and the work is the 
sacrifice of the president for the 

724
00:37:02,201 --> 00:37:04,810
future.
And so that's exactly right.

725
00:37:04,811 --> 00:37:08,350
You have to work now you see?
See what's interesting aBout that,

726
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,640
and this is the theory that I was,
oh,

727
00:37:09,641 --> 00:37:12,520
and then of course god tells that eve,
well,

728
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,200
you've really,
you know,

729
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,093
screwed things up to,
you're going to have these big brain 

730
00:37:17,051 --> 00:37:19,600
babies and,
and that's a big problem.

731
00:37:19,601 --> 00:37:20,434
You're going to suffer in childbirth and
then they're going to be dependent on 

732
00:37:23,891 --> 00:37:25,150
you forever.
And because of that,

733
00:37:25,151 --> 00:37:28,390
you're going to be dependent on this.
man that you just woke up and that's not

734
00:37:28,391 --> 00:37:29,860
going to be very pleasant for either of 
you,

735
00:37:29,861 --> 00:37:30,694
but tough luck and so that's it.
That's the curse in some sense and it's 

736
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,030
exactly right,
but the thing is,

737
00:37:37,031 --> 00:37:37,864
there's a theory in there.
There's an interesting theory of 

738
00:37:40,031 --> 00:37:40,864
suffering that's implicit in that story 
and the theory of suffering is that 

739
00:37:43,871 --> 00:37:47,260
suffering is built into the structure of
self conscious being.

740
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:51,640
It's built right into the structure,
so if you're a self conscious being,

741
00:37:51,641 --> 00:37:54,880
that's your lot.
It isn't someone else's fault.

742
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:58,600
It isn't a consequence of sociological 
oppression.

743
00:37:59,110 --> 00:37:59,943
It isn't the consequences of the fact 
that our society isn't organized 

744
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,693
properly.

745
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,750
It's just part of being.

746
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:10,270
All right,
so that's a big deal because that's a.

747
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,670
That's an important theory because one 
of the questions is,

748
00:38:12,671 --> 00:38:14,560
well,
what we know why is there suffering,

749
00:38:14,561 --> 00:38:16,840
but what are you going to do about it?
And it's a big.

750
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,733
It's a lot different if it's just the 
Way it is for you and if it's actually 

751
00:38:21,911 --> 00:38:23,880
your fault that he's suffering,
those are,

752
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,100
or maybe it's the group's fault that 
you're suffering.

753
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:30,530
Those are major.
Those theories are really,

754
00:38:30,531 --> 00:38:33,860
really different and then in the second 
story in cain and abel,

755
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:40,530
cane make sacrifices to try to get it in
good with god enabled,

756
00:38:40,531 --> 00:38:45,430
make sacrifices and sacrifices are kind 
of archaic from our perspective.

757
00:38:45,431 --> 00:38:46,264
They're burnt offerings so the smoke 
goes up where god can detect it because 

758
00:38:48,731 --> 00:38:52,820
he's up there somewhere up there where 
the stars are and uh,

759
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:56,470
god rejects cane sacrifices and we don't
really know why,

760
00:38:56,471 --> 00:39:00,790
but it kind of looks like cain is a 
second grader and then god king goes and

761
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:01,624
complains to god and says like,
what kind of stupid universe did you 

762
00:39:03,731 --> 00:39:04,210
make here?

763
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:08,230
I'm breaking myself and half trying to 
get things together,

764
00:39:08,231 --> 00:39:13,150
making the proper sacrifices and 
nothing's going well for me and abel.

765
00:39:13,151 --> 00:39:13,781
Well,
you know,

766
00:39:13,781 --> 00:39:17,080
he's everything he touches turns to 
gold.

767
00:39:17,081 --> 00:39:19,510
Everyone loves him.
He's even a really good guy.

768
00:39:19,511 --> 00:39:23,440
It's like so annoying.
What's up with this place you built?

769
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:24,603
And god tells kane don't become an and 
telling me that the entire fabric of 

770
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:31,330
reality is wrong because it isn't 
working out for you.

771
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,510
Says sin crouches at your door.
Like a,

772
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,720
like a sexually aroused predatory cat.
That's basically the metaphor that,

773
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,013
that god uses and he says,
and you let it in and had it and let it 

774
00:39:44,141 --> 00:39:44,974
have its way with you,
and that's really an interesting way of 

775
00:39:47,891 --> 00:39:50,410
putting it because what god says to cain
is that,

776
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,053
you know,
you're all bitter and resentful and 

777
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:53,913
really it's no wonder because you know,
things aren't going well for you and 

778
00:39:56,891 --> 00:40:00,670
then you've got able who's over shining 
you in every way and uh,

779
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:03,550
but it's your fault,

780
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,953
this terrible thing waited at the door 
and you let it in and then you entered 

781
00:40:10,851 --> 00:40:11,684
into a creative union with it and you 
produced something as a consequence and 

782
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,413
that's this tormented spirit that you 
have now and it's polluting your 

783
00:40:19,671 --> 00:40:24,020
relationship with reality.
And that's why things aren't working out

784
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:24,943
very well for you.
So go put yourself together before you 

785
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:32,591
come and tell me just exactly what's 
wrong with the structure of reality.

786
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:34,303
And cain isn't very happy about that 
because really is that really what you 

787
00:40:36,501 --> 00:40:37,650
want to hear,
right?

788
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:38,563
Like you have more misery than is 
necessary because you really didn't put 

789
00:40:43,401 --> 00:40:44,234
your act together and you know it and 
you've done it creatively and so kayden 

790
00:40:49,521 --> 00:40:50,570
goes and kills abel.

791
00:40:51,870 --> 00:40:52,703
That's the story of how resentment 
enters the world and it's the first 

792
00:40:55,831 --> 00:40:56,664
story in the judeo christian canon,
let's say about actual human beings 

793
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:03,480
because adam and eve were made by god so
they don't really count.

794
00:41:03,481 --> 00:41:04,314
Cain and abel were born and so that's 
something so there's a reaction to 

795
00:41:08,011 --> 00:41:08,791
suffering,
right?

796
00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:09,624
The necessIty of sacrifice and the 
consequence of the necessity of 

797
00:41:12,001 --> 00:41:15,390
sacrifices that some sacrifices work and
others don't,

798
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:18,540
and then if your sacrifices aren't met 
with the,

799
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,790
with the good will of god,
let's say,

800
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:23,010
well then that makes you angry.
Well,

801
00:41:23,011 --> 00:41:23,844
of course it does.
You can take god out of this story if 

802
00:41:25,561 --> 00:41:26,394
you want.
If you're not happy with that kind of 

803
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:32,010
mythological or narrative statement,
but it doesn't really matter because the

804
00:41:32,011 --> 00:41:34,190
whole point is is that if you make 
sacrifices,

805
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:35,024
especially if they're second rate,
things aren't going to go very well for 

806
00:41:37,341 --> 00:41:38,174
you and you're going to get bitter and 
resentful and murderous and maybe 

807
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:43,100
genocidal and it's really interesting,
you know,

808
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:47,330
because cane has descendants and if you 
bug,

809
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,210
if you transgress against them,
they don't just kill you.

810
00:41:50,211 --> 00:41:53,750
They killed seven of you and then his 
later descendants kill 49 of you.

811
00:41:53,751 --> 00:41:58,700
There's this exponential growth of 
murderousness as a consequence of canes,

812
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:03,350
primary,
primal fratricide,

813
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:07,430
and then the next story is the flood.
And that's not an accident.

814
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:10,190
There's nothing in those stories is an 
accident.

815
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,890
Okay,
so now you've got two different theories

816
00:42:12,891 --> 00:42:16,610
about the nature of suffering.
You've got the one I just laid out,

817
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:21,320
it's called the foundational story of 
suffering and malevolence,

818
00:42:21,321 --> 00:42:22,154
and you have the marxists story,
which is while there's an oppressed 

819
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,353
people and the reason they're oppressed 
and suffering is because of the 

820
00:42:27,051 --> 00:42:30,560
oppressors are oppressing them.
Those are not the same theories.

821
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,710
Right?
And there's a utopianism that's implicit

822
00:42:33,711 --> 00:42:34,544
in marxism,
which is if you could just get the damn 

823
00:42:36,861 --> 00:42:39,380
old pressers to stop oppressing the 
oppressed,

824
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:40,453
then the utopia would arrive.
And so not only are the oppressors 

825
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:46,970
responsible for the suffering of the 
poor,

826
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:52,040
they're also responsible for the fact 
that the utopia isn't here for everyone.

827
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:53,323
And so how reprehensible can you get?
Well then that certainly justifies that 

828
00:42:59,411 --> 00:43:04,300
degree of malevolence justifies pretty 
much anything you'd like to do to them.

829
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:05,493
So anyways,
so let's take this apart in a little 

830
00:43:06,941 --> 00:43:11,941
more detail.
Don't do the marxists.

831
00:43:12,171 --> 00:43:13,004
Have sympathy for the working class.
George orwell was interested in this 

832
00:43:17,481 --> 00:43:21,980
question and so he wrote this book 
called wiggins road to wigan pier,

833
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:25,730
which I would highly recommend it.
So on a reading list I've made,

834
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,980
it's on my website.
You can check that out.

835
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,560
Those are books that have been 
particularly influential to me.

836
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,753
And so orwell was a socialist.
he wrote the book for the left book 

837
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:37,874
club,
which published a kind of a socialist 

838
00:43:40,281 --> 00:43:42,590
book once a month or.
Well,

839
00:43:42,591 --> 00:43:45,530
by the time he wrote this book,
he was already awake.

840
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:51,740
No buy in the 19 twenties after the 
russian revolution.

841
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,753
No one really knew what to make of what 
was happening in what would become the 

842
00:43:55,671 --> 00:43:57,100
soviet union,
right be.

843
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:00,740
It was after world war.
One planet was in ashes,

844
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,113
pro intents and purposes.
The old aristocratic order was 

845
00:44:05,571 --> 00:44:06,404
crumbling.

846
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,253
Um,

847
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,113
it was a horror show and these 
revolutionaries came out with these new 

848
00:44:12,411 --> 00:44:16,370
ideas and tried to give the in 
principle,

849
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,233
give the working class a break and 
everybody watched to see what would 

850
00:44:19,371 --> 00:44:20,204
happen then,

851
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:21,983
um,

852
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:23,743
the honest people and the intellectuals 
watched and I separate them for a 

853
00:44:27,111 --> 00:44:28,510
reason.
Um,

854
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:31,140
but by 1920,
21,

855
00:44:31,141 --> 00:44:32,700
22,
something like that,

856
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,570
it was obvious already that something 
was rotten in the state of Denmark.

857
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,433
Malcolm muggeridge went over to the 
soviet union to check out how the 

858
00:44:40,021 --> 00:44:40,854
collectivization of the farms was going 
and he found out it was actually pretty 

859
00:44:43,741 --> 00:44:45,930
murderous,
right?

860
00:44:45,931 --> 00:44:46,764
Because what the,
what the communists did was roundup all 

861
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,433
the successful farmers and rape them and
kill them and steal everything they had 

862
00:44:51,781 --> 00:44:55,110
and send them off to siberia,
which turned out actually to be a pretty

863
00:44:55,111 --> 00:44:58,560
bad idea.
Now you think you think about it,

864
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:03,360
those people were serfs not very long 
before a couple of generations at most,

865
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,373
they were so not much more than slaves 
and some of them had risen up to the 

866
00:45:07,411 --> 00:45:08,244
point where the media had a nice brick 
house and a couple of cows and maybe a 

867
00:45:10,501 --> 00:45:11,334
person working for them or too,
and there was a small proportion of the 

868
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:15,383
agriculturalists in the soviet union 
that we're producing most of the food 

869
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:19,763
and that's just how it goes because 
that's a prieto distribution issue in 

870
00:45:22,591 --> 00:45:25,830
any field where there's human 
productivity,

871
00:45:25,831 --> 00:45:28,830
a small proportion of the people produce
almost all of the output.

872
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,053
It's actually the square root of the 
number of people in the field produce 

873
00:45:32,221 --> 00:45:34,320
half the output.
So if you have 100 farmers,

874
00:45:34,321 --> 00:45:35,154
ted of them produce half the food,
but if you have 10,000 to 100 of them 

875
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,990
produce half the food.
Okay?

876
00:45:39,991 --> 00:45:42,720
So what happens when you kill all the 
good farmers?

877
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,760
You starve 6 million ukrainians to death
in the 19 thirties.

878
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:49,163
And you know,
that's not something that's all that 

879
00:45:50,311 --> 00:45:52,200
widely known,
but if you want to

880
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:56,700
provide some additional fodder for your 
nightmares,

881
00:45:56,701 --> 00:45:57,534
you could go online and read about what 
happened to the ukrainians in the 19 

882
00:46:00,061 --> 00:46:02,810
thirties.
So underneath the,

883
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:03,773
under the collectivization principles.
So let's say you're a mother and you 

884
00:46:06,971 --> 00:46:10,350
were starving to death and so are your 
children and you know,

885
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:14,660
the communists had come in and forcibly 
collectivized you and then they took all

886
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,800
the grain that your collective farm and 
producing,

887
00:46:16,801 --> 00:46:18,230
they shipped it all to the city say.

888
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:20,040
And so that's all done.
And you think,

889
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:20,821
okay,
you know,

890
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:21,654
the city's got eight.
So then you go out in the field to pick 

891
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:28,320
up the grains that the harvesters missed
so that you can,

892
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:30,330
you know,
the ones that they'd be lying there,

893
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,520
they're not so good.
There's not that many of them.

894
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:33,403
you go out and glean,
you pick up the seeds that weren't 

895
00:46:35,221 --> 00:46:39,480
picked up a so you can feed your kids so
they don't die.

896
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:42,360
And so what's the punishment for that 
death?

897
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:44,303
Because you were obliged under the 
collectivization orders to turn in any 

898
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:48,683
additional grains that you happen to 
pick off the ground to the authorities 

899
00:46:52,111 --> 00:46:53,850
so that they can be,
well,

900
00:46:53,851 --> 00:46:55,890
who knows,
but at least so you.

901
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:58,200
So they could be shipped to the cities,
I suppose,

902
00:46:58,201 --> 00:47:01,110
which is of course absurd because of 
course that would never happen,

903
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:04,230
but it was mostly so that you could just
actually die.

904
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:06,450
So.
Okay.

905
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:09,210
Anyways,
back to the road to wigan pier.

906
00:47:09,211 --> 00:47:10,044
Now

907
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:16,950
I'm going to read you a little bit about
about from the book.

908
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:21,980
So orwell went out to this mining town 
in the northern uk and coal miners

909
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:26,483
had sympathy for the working class.
He really worked on that hiS whole life 

910
00:47:28,861 --> 00:47:32,950
because he was a middle class,
upper middle class,

911
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,083
snobby type englishman,
and he knew it and he tried really hard 

912
00:47:38,531 --> 00:47:39,364
to overcome that.
He,

913
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,320
he,
he,

914
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:44,590
he served in the spanish civil war.
He wandered around as a tramp.

915
00:47:44,591 --> 00:47:46,900
He worked in,
in low end restaurant.

916
00:47:46,901 --> 00:47:50,410
He worked as a low end worker in 
restaurants in paris and in london.

917
00:47:50,411 --> 00:47:51,244
He has a very good book,
I think it's called down and out in 

918
00:47:53,391 --> 00:47:54,224
paris and london that describes that he 
was seriously committed dude and really 

919
00:47:58,181 --> 00:47:59,014
a smart guy.
And so he's going up to these terrible 

920
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:03,843
towns in the northern uk where the coal 
miners worked and have their families 

921
00:48:06,881 --> 00:48:09,220
and you know,
they had hard lives.

922
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:11,890
They had hard lives and that's just say 
it,

923
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,300
nothing,
you know,

924
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:14,163
the coal miners that he met,
they didn't have any teeth by the time 

925
00:48:17,111 --> 00:48:17,944
they were 30.
He said the women he talked to you said 

926
00:48:20,711 --> 00:48:21,544
teeth or just a misery.
It's better to get rid of them as soon 

927
00:48:23,441 --> 00:48:25,020
as you can.
Um,

928
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:26,450
and,
and,

929
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:29,950
and they went and the man went and mined
coal and that was rough.

930
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,784
You know,
they all have black lung by the time 

931
00:48:31,571 --> 00:48:34,780
they were 40 and they were,
they were done fundamentally.

932
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:37,460
But here's a,
just a bit,

933
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:39,520
a bit of a story about how hard their 
lives were.

934
00:48:39,521 --> 00:48:44,521
So they had to go in the mines during 
the day so that they never saw the day.

935
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:45,964
So that's one thing.
They had to go to the mines and then 

936
00:48:47,081 --> 00:48:47,914
they ended like not coal off the walls.
That's hard with hammers and picks and 

937
00:48:52,391 --> 00:48:55,000
all of that and they had to move it,
but that was.

938
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:57,730
That was their job,
but there was the commute,

939
00:48:58,150 --> 00:48:58,983
so here is the commute.
So imagine that the typical tunnel was 

940
00:49:01,001 --> 00:49:02,860
about that high,
something like that,

941
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:05,260
and the typical coal miner was about 
that high.

942
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:06,483
Lots of problem maybe because you've got
to walk through those tunnels to get to 

943
00:49:08,381 --> 00:49:11,740
work so you have to walk like this.
Then the question might be,

944
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:14,200
well,
how far do you have to walk to work?

945
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,273
And that answer is three and a half 
miles and that's how far you have to 

946
00:49:18,161 --> 00:49:18,994
walk back from work after you put your 
eight hour shift in the coal mine and 

947
00:49:23,051 --> 00:49:27,850
the you don't get paid for the commute.
And so orwell said that was more or less

948
00:49:27,851 --> 00:49:32,290
like climbing a small mountain in the 
morning before you went to work and then

949
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:35,050
climbing another one at night before you
went home.

950
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:36,880
And so that was just.

951
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:38,350
I mean,
believe me,

952
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:41,050
I'm telling you very little about how 
tough their lives were,

953
00:49:41,051 --> 00:49:41,884
but that gives you a little flavor.
I said one day like that for a modern 

954
00:49:44,501 --> 00:49:45,334
person,
you're just your dad or you wish you 

955
00:49:46,721 --> 00:49:51,721
were dead anyways,
and so orwell talks about going up there

956
00:49:51,791 --> 00:49:52,624
to stay in terrible places he lived in 
while he was up there and the terrible 

957
00:49:55,781 --> 00:49:59,260
food he ate and and the miserable and 
wretched scenes that he saw.

958
00:49:59,261 --> 00:50:01,420
And here's one of the miserable richard 
scenes.

959
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,690
He's on a train through the 
neighborhoods.

960
00:50:04,691 --> 00:50:05,524
He says,
the train bore me away for the monster 

961
00:50:07,991 --> 00:50:09,250
scenery of slag.
Heaps,

962
00:50:09,251 --> 00:50:13,660
chimneys piled scrap iron fall canals,
paths of singery mud,

963
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:16,930
criss cross by the prince of clogs.
This was march,

964
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:18,183
but the weather had been horribly cold 
and everywhere there were mounds of 

965
00:50:21,491 --> 00:50:22,324
black and snow.
As we move slowly through the outskirts 

966
00:50:25,211 --> 00:50:26,044
of the town,
we passed row after of little gray slum 

967
00:50:28,671 --> 00:50:29,504
houses running at right angles to the 
embankment at the back of one of the 

968
00:50:33,771 --> 00:50:34,120
houses.

969
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:34,953
The young woman was kneeling on the 
stones poking a stick up the lead and 

970
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:40,520
waste pipe which ran from the sink 
inside him,

971
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:44,930
which I suppose was blocked.
I had time to see everything about her.

972
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,170
Her sack apron,
her clumsy clogs her arms,

973
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:52,190
reddened by the cold.
She looked up as the train passed,

974
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,710
and I was almost near enough to catch 
her eye.

975
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:56,563
She had around pale face,
usual exhausted face of the slum girl 

976
00:51:00,111 --> 00:51:04,490
who's 25 and looks 40 thanks,
two miscarriages and drudgery and at war

977
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:07,610
for the second in which I sought the 
most desolate,

978
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:11,930
hopeless expression I've ever seen.
It struck me.

979
00:51:11,931 --> 00:51:15,020
Then we meaning the middle class at that
time,

980
00:51:15,021 --> 00:51:15,854
our mistake,
and when we saY that it isn't the same 

981
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:18,674
for them as it would be for us,
and then people bread in the slums can 

982
00:51:21,261 --> 00:51:22,094
imagine nothing but the slums for what I
saw on her face was by no means the 

983
00:51:25,731 --> 00:51:26,564
ignorant suffering of an animal.
She knew well enough what was happening 

984
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:31,670
to her,
understood as well as I did,

985
00:51:31,730 --> 00:51:34,910
how dreadful of destiny it was to be 
kneeling there in the bitter cold.

986
00:51:35,090 --> 00:51:39,200
On the slimy stones of a slum backyard 
poking a stick up,

987
00:51:39,201 --> 00:51:40,580
a follow drain pipe.

988
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:43,613
All right,
so orwell rates the first part of the 

989
00:51:47,581 --> 00:51:48,414
book and it details the lives of these 
people and then he makes an argument he 

990
00:51:52,771 --> 00:51:54,480
says was like,
how can you read about this?

991
00:51:54,481 --> 00:51:58,160
How can you know about this without 
having some sympathy for

992
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:03,990
redistribution schemes and social and 
socialist ideas.

993
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:07,170
And so he's actually asking himself this
question.

994
00:52:07,171 --> 00:52:09,150
It's not just a rhetorical question.
He's,

995
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:10,860
I mean,
he's a serious guy,

996
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:11,430
right?
He went,

997
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:12,263
he goeS up there and he tells you a 
story that you have to have a heart of 

998
00:52:15,361 --> 00:52:16,950
stone if you,
if you don't,

999
00:52:16,951 --> 00:52:18,390
if you read that you don't think,
man,

1000
00:52:18,391 --> 00:52:20,700
something should be done about this.
It's really awful.

1001
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:21,743
So he set up this situation where your 
sympathies are completely with the 

1002
00:52:27,121 --> 00:52:32,121
people that he's describing,
but socialism wasn't all that popular in

1003
00:52:32,651 --> 00:52:33,750
britain at that time.
And,

1004
00:52:34,110 --> 00:52:34,943
and so,
and socialists weren't all that popular 

1005
00:52:37,691 --> 00:52:40,810
with orwell.
He didn't really like them that much and

1006
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:42,640
he was trying to figure out why that 
was.

1007
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,320
So this is what he wrote in the second 
part of the book.

1008
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:50,090
Now this card have been a lot of 
trouble.

1009
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:53,930
they didn't want to publish this damn 
book after he wrote the second part.

1010
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:55,703
Oh,

1011
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:59,710
but he fought with him and he got it 
published and it's a classic and,

1012
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:00,583
and people still read it and you should 
read it because it's a great book and 

1013
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:04,093
orwell's great writer and orwell is 
another one of those people and 

1014
00:53:07,631 --> 00:53:10,050
intellectuals who woke up pretty early.
You know,

1015
00:53:10,051 --> 00:53:10,884
orwell wrote animal farm and 1984.
He wrote 1984 and 1940 eIght wrote 

1016
00:53:16,331 --> 00:53:18,790
animal farm approximately around the 
same time.

1017
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:23,290
He knew what was happening under stalin 
and he wasn't afraid to say it,

1018
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:27,660
but it was a that in some sense fell on 
deaf ears,

1019
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:28,883
especially among the intelligentsia.
And there's complicated reasons for 

1020
00:53:31,231 --> 00:53:32,350
that.
But.

1021
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:34,483
But it wasn't like the facts weren't 
there for people to see them if they 

1022
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:38,580
wanted to.
And has already said muggeridge.

1023
00:53:38,581 --> 00:53:39,414
Malcolm muggeridge had made it pretty 
clear in the 19 twenties and that was 

1024
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:44,340
widely publicized by the way,
throughout the uk.

1025
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,353
What was happening during d kula,
the kulaks being the farmers that I 

1026
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:51,420
talked about earlier,
who,

1027
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:56,750
who had committed the unspeakable sin of
crawling out of their surf status over a

1028
00:53:58,531 --> 00:53:59,364
couple of Generations to the point where
they weren't mirror property and half 

1029
00:54:03,721 --> 00:54:04,554
starved,
so this is what oracle had to say about 

1030
00:54:07,861 --> 00:54:08,760
socialists.

1031
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:12,550
It might be sad,
however,

1032
00:54:12,551 --> 00:54:13,384
that Even if the theoretical oriented 
book train socialist is not a working 

1033
00:54:18,101 --> 00:54:18,934
man himself,
at least he has actually by a love of 

1034
00:54:21,941 --> 00:54:25,810
the working class.
He's endeavoring to shed his joie status

1035
00:54:25,811 --> 00:54:27,610
and fight on the side of the 
proletariat.

1036
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:31,750
Obviously that must be his motive.
What is it?

1037
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,113
Sometimes I look at the socialist,
the intellectual tract writing type of 

1038
00:54:37,811 --> 00:54:38,644
socialist with his pullover is fuzzy 
hair and his marxist quotation and 

1039
00:54:42,941 --> 00:54:45,220
wonder what the devil is.
Motive really is.

1040
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,520
It's really difficult to believe that 
it's a love of anybody,

1041
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,700
especially if the working class from 
whom he is of all people,

1042
00:54:51,701 --> 00:54:52,534
the furthest removed.
The truth is that too many people 

1043
00:54:56,231 --> 00:54:57,064
calling them socialists revolution does 
not mean a movement of the masses with 

1044
00:55:01,361 --> 00:55:04,870
which they hope to associate themselves.
It means instead of set of reforms which

1045
00:55:04,871 --> 00:55:05,704
we,
the clever ones are going to impose on 

1046
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:11,560
them the lower orders.
On the other hand,

1047
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:15,940
it would be a mistake to regard the book
train socialist as a bloodless creature,

1048
00:55:15,941 --> 00:55:16,774
entirely incapable of emotion,
though seldom giving much evidence of 

1049
00:55:20,861 --> 00:55:21,694
affection for the exploited
is perfectly capable of displaying 

1050
00:55:26,201 --> 00:55:30,010
hatred,
sort of queer theoretical in vacuum.

1051
00:55:30,011 --> 00:55:32,080
Oh,
hatred against the explorers.

1052
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:36,370
Hence the grand old social sport of 
denouncing the bourgeoisie.

1053
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:37,643
It is strange how easily almost any 
socialist writer can lash himself into 

1054
00:55:40,991 --> 00:55:44,860
frenzies of rage against the class too,
which by birth or by adoption,

1055
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:48,280
he himself almost invariably belongs.

1056
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:51,893
No,
I worked for the ndp when I was a kid 

1057
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:55,163
and I had privileged access to the 
leadership for provincially and 

1058
00:55:58,851 --> 00:56:00,770
federally for reasons that I won't go 
into.

1059
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:01,933
And I thought that
many of them were honorable people who 

1060
00:56:06,491 --> 00:56:09,130
were really striving to give the working
class of voice.

1061
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:12,550
And I believe that the working class 
needs a voice,

1062
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:16,570
a political voice for obvious reasons.
Um,

1063
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:18,213
I think the democrats in the United 
States have made it absolutely dreadful 

1064
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:26,311
abysmal mistake replacing their working 
class,

1065
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:31,920
political ethos with identity politics.
We're going to talk about that and,

1066
00:56:32,171 --> 00:56:33,004
uh,

1067
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,460
and I don't think the situation has 
changed that much.

1068
00:56:39,461 --> 00:56:42,100
I think one of the things that's 
happened in the United States is that

1069
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:44,733
world stability and peace in some ways 
has been purchased at the expense of 

1070
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:54,450
north american working class wellbeing 
now because the chinese have gotten rich

1071
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:58,360
compared to 30 years ago,
40 years ago,

1072
00:56:58,361 --> 00:57:00,800
50 years ago,
the,

1073
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,730
the indians have gotten rich again,
same comparison basis.

1074
00:57:03,731 --> 00:57:04,564
There's more middle class people in 
India now than there are on the United 

1075
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:07,800
States.
Um,

1076
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:08,973
the trade arrangements that have been in
north America allowed for the rise of 

1077
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,690
middle classes globally.
At the same time,

1078
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:17,583
they opened up the working class in 
north America to competition from those 

1079
00:57:20,561 --> 00:57:23,170
low wage sources.
And maybe that's a good deal.

1080
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,310
It's hard to say,
right,

1081
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:29,110
because it's not such a bad thing that 
the chinese aren't starving and it's not

1082
00:57:29,111 --> 00:57:29,944
such a bad thing that the indians aren't
starving and that those societies are 

1083
00:57:32,531 --> 00:57:35,200
transforming themselves.
actually into communities that are quite

1084
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:36,910
wealthy,
it's like hooray for that.

1085
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:39,220
It's an absolutely miraculous 
transformation.

1086
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:43,900
It's the most rapid growth of human 
wealth in the history of humanity,

1087
00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:45,123
so we should be pretty happy about that,
but we should also remember at least to 

1088
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:53,431
some degree who's paid the price for it
and so as far as I'm concerned,

1089
00:57:55,421 --> 00:57:58,090
the working class needs a voice

1090
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:00,303
and

1091
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:03,130
it isn't obvious that they have one at 
the moment.

1092
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:07,360
Having said that,
however,

1093
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:10,330
it isn't obvious to me at all

1094
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:17,750
that the people who purport to stand for
the working class actually do so or that

1095
00:58:19,261 --> 00:58:22,710
if they do so that the reason they do so
is because they're all compassionate and

1096
00:58:22,711 --> 00:58:23,544
sympathetic and loving and kind and st.
Like I'm more convinced by orwell's 

1097
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,530
argument.
So back to the mdp,

1098
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:34,650
the people I met at the leadership 
level,

1099
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,150
a lot of them I had a fair bit of 
admiration for,

1100
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,880
but as I worked with the party over 
about a five year period,

1101
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:43,493
there's this contradiction that kept 
emerging for me and that was that I 

1102
00:58:46,621 --> 00:58:49,980
didn't really like the low level party 
functionary activist types.

1103
00:58:49,981 --> 00:58:52,500
Like they just weren't personally 
appealing to me.

1104
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:57,680
They seem peevish and resentful and then
at the same time I was going to college,

1105
00:58:58,350 --> 00:58:59,183
I was about 17.
I got elected to the senate on the 

1106
00:59:01,921 --> 00:59:02,754
college board of governors and at that 
time alberta was conservative 

1107
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:07,530
politically,
right.

1108
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:09,740
It still is of course,
but they.

1109
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,030
It was part of the progressive 
conservative

1110
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:14,663
empire because they ruled alberta 
forever and all the board of governor 

1111
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,220
members were basically nominees,
right.

1112
00:59:22,221 --> 00:59:23,054
TheY were conservative nominees.
So these were conservative people and I 

1113
00:59:25,201 --> 00:59:26,034
was an ndp member and I thought I'd 
worked for small businessman to who 

1114
00:59:29,541 --> 00:59:30,830
weren't mdp.
They were,

1115
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,810
they were conservative.
It can never figure that out.

1116
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:33,673
I'll tell you about that in a minute.
But I had a bad case of cognitive 

1117
00:59:37,191 --> 00:59:38,024
dissonance because they actually turned 
out that I admired the people on the 

1118
00:59:40,071 --> 00:59:42,850
board of governors and they were mostly.
It was in grand prairie.

1119
00:59:42,851 --> 00:59:44,900
It's not a very big place and it's not 
very old.

1120
00:59:44,901 --> 00:59:49,190
And so if you were reasonably successful
in grand prairie,

1121
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,053
the probability that you would inherited
your money from the aristocrat 

1122
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:56,000
aristocracy was like zero.
Cause there wasn't one,

1123
00:59:56,001 --> 00:59:56,834
right,
it's the whole damn town was 50 years 

1124
00:59:58,521 --> 01:00:02,390
old,
so if you had any influencer or wealth,

1125
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:03,283
you are a small businessman,
small to middle sized businessmen and 

1126
01:00:05,421 --> 01:00:06,254
you'd.

1127
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:08,200
You knew what you were doing.

1128
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:11,310
And I actually admired these people.
I thought,

1129
01:00:11,311 --> 01:00:12,144
well that's not very good.
I mire them and I don't share their 

1130
01:00:14,761 --> 01:00:16,560
political views.
And then there's these other people with

1131
01:00:16,561 --> 01:00:20,340
whom I hypothetically share political 
views and I don't admire them at all.

1132
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,220
What's going on?
And then I read road to wigan pier and I

1133
01:00:23,221 --> 01:00:24,450
thought,
oh,

1134
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:29,310
that's it.
They don't like the poor.

1135
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:34,110
They just hate the rich.
It's not the same thing.

1136
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:35,303
It's not the same set of motivations.
And so let's say that you're a 

1137
01:00:38,761 --> 01:00:42,510
postmodernist and you privileged 
compassion for the oppressed.

1138
01:00:43,330 --> 01:00:43,621
Think,
well,

1139
01:00:43,621 --> 01:00:46,530
what are you pushed to the margins?
Well,

1140
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:51,030
what are you doing with all your hatred 
and your resentment and your evil?

1141
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:56,060
It's like you don't have any of that.
That's a bad theory.

1142
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:58,420
That's a really bad theory.

1143
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:01,100
Okay,
so fine.

1144
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:02,810
So you can say,
well yeah,

1145
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:05,480
you can say that,
but I don't buy it.

1146
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:06,343
I still think that the people who stand 
to speak for the oppressed are in fact 

1147
01:01:10,281 --> 01:01:14,090
motivated by empathy and sympathy.
Their hearts are in the right place.

1148
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,430
See,
I don't really buy that either because I

1149
01:01:16,431 --> 01:01:17,264
don't really think generally speaking,
that it's a credible claim for someone 

1150
01:01:21,471 --> 01:01:24,380
to make that their heart is in the right
place.

1151
01:01:25,610 --> 01:01:26,443
Now you can ask that of yourself and if 
you think your heart is in the right 

1152
01:01:28,731 --> 01:01:30,860
place,
well more power to you.

1153
01:01:30,861 --> 01:01:31,590
You know,
I,

1154
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:34,760
I,
I can't see the halo from here.

1155
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:35,623
However,
and so given that you're just as 

1156
01:01:41,001 --> 01:01:41,834
malevolent as your neighbor or maybe 
even more so and that that's actually 

1157
01:01:47,001 --> 01:01:51,140
pretty malevolent given the intrinsic 
nature of human beings.

1158
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:52,303
I cAn't help but wonder what you're 
doing with all those traits that you're 

1159
01:01:55,131 --> 01:01:56,470
not admitting to,

1160
01:01:58,460 --> 01:01:59,293
but you can.

1161
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,220
You could even object.
Well,

1162
01:02:02,221 --> 01:02:03,054
you know,
that's a pretty pessimistic view of 

1163
01:02:04,081 --> 01:02:06,900
humankind.
It's not by the way,

1164
01:02:06,901 --> 01:02:08,430
it's just not naive,
but anyways,

1165
01:02:08,431 --> 01:02:10,650
you could object that and you can say 
no.

1166
01:02:10,651 --> 01:02:14,400
Actually,
the weight of moral authority is in fact

1167
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:15,593
on the left,
even the radical left with those who 

1168
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:22,110
identify the oppressed and who are 
working to better their conditions.

1169
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,353
Okay,

1170
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:29,600
fair enough.
So then let's say,

1171
01:02:29,601 --> 01:02:31,670
well,
let's give those people some power

1172
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,153
and if they're actually motivated by 
compassion and empathy and desire for 

1173
01:02:37,221 --> 01:02:38,054
the working class,
if you give them power and you give the 

1174
01:02:40,621 --> 01:02:44,180
ideas power,
then as those ideas unfold in real time,

1175
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:45,373
you're going to find out like,
did things get better for the working 

1176
01:02:48,411 --> 01:02:49,490
class,
let's say?

1177
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:52,760
Or did they get worse?
Because we could.

1178
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:55,070
We could consider that like an 
experiment.

1179
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:59,180
We could consider the outcome proof.
I don't know what else you would do.

1180
01:02:59,181 --> 01:03:00,014
I don't know how else you would.
You would come to your decision because 

1181
01:03:02,781 --> 01:03:04,670
it's just theory until you see it 
happen.

1182
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:08,830
Now,
nature said back in the 18,

1183
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:11,000
late 18 hundreds that

1184
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:14,633
after he said that god was dead,
and I suppose that would also Mean the 

1185
01:03:17,851 --> 01:03:21,040
theory that of suffering that I outlined
at the beginning.

1186
01:03:21,041 --> 01:03:24,210
That is that the basis of judeo 
christian civilization,

1187
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:27,270
that god was dead in,
that people had killed him,

1188
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:30,150
and that we'd never find enough water to
wash away the blood.

1189
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,240
It's a paraphrase,
but I got the basic message right,

1190
01:03:33,241 --> 01:03:34,074
and he also said there'll be two 
consequences of that nihilism because 

1191
01:03:39,661 --> 01:03:40,494
there's no transcendent meaning and a 
move to totalitarianism because people 

1192
01:03:43,501 --> 01:03:44,334
can't tolerate nihilism.
He said the most likely pathway to 

1193
01:03:48,451 --> 01:03:52,200
totalitarianism would be communism.
Essentially.

1194
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:57,290
He didn't quite use those words,
but he meant that he,

1195
01:03:57,450 --> 01:04:01,950
the words are close enough.
He said socialism,

1196
01:04:01,951 --> 01:04:04,250
but I'm going to use communism to 
distinguishing it,

1197
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:06,390
distinguish it from democratic 
socialism,

1198
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:07,583
and he said that probably tens of tens 
of millions of people would die in the 

1199
01:04:10,681 --> 01:04:13,890
20th century as we played out that 
experiment and then he said,

1200
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:15,960
but it might be worth it if we learned 
something from it.

1201
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:20,040
Rough man.
I mean,

1202
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:23,790
and and unbelievable like I cannot 
figure out how in the world he knew that

1203
01:04:23,791 --> 01:04:26,640
that was going to happen.
Especially so far in advance,

1204
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:27,503
but dostoevsky knew the same thing.
He wrote this book called the devil's 

1205
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:32,910
are the possessed.
You could read that,

1206
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:36,540
that's a great book.
It takes about 150 pages to get going,

1207
01:04:36,990 --> 01:04:41,130
but once it like everything,
everything snaps together after that,

1208
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:44,670
you know,
and then it moves and it's basically his

1209
01:04:44,671 --> 01:04:49,671
prophecy about it's an examination of 
the kind of person who had arisen in the

1210
01:04:49,951 --> 01:04:54,780
aftermath of the death of god in Russia 
who would lead the communist revolution.

1211
01:04:54,930 --> 01:04:57,150
That's essentially it.
It's brilliant.

1212
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:57,751
It's,
it's,

1213
01:04:57,751 --> 01:05:02,751
it's terrifying and it's a great intro 
to solzhenitsyn's gulag archipelago,

1214
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:03,863
which describes what did happen when 
those sort of people took over the 

1215
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,470
revolution.
So let's look at what happened after the

1216
01:05:10,471 --> 01:05:12,810
revolution and we might say,
well,

1217
01:05:12,811 --> 01:05:13,644
this,
how about we replicate the experiment a 

1218
01:05:14,971 --> 01:05:15,804
few times because you know how it is.
If you're running this scientific 

1219
01:05:17,921 --> 01:05:18,754
experiment,
you want to find out what something 

1220
01:05:21,491 --> 01:05:23,950
does.
If you allow it to behave,

1221
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:24,903
you don't want to just run it once 
because while maybe there was something 

1222
01:05:27,161 --> 01:05:29,950
specific about those conditions that 
lead to the outcome.

1223
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:33,880
You want to generalize it across 
multiple circumstances.

1224
01:05:33,881 --> 01:05:34,840
So we might say,
well,

1225
01:05:34,841 --> 01:05:37,610
let's take this set of ideas and let's,

1226
01:05:39,950 --> 01:05:40,783
let's run it on large scale over very 
long period of time in a variety of 

1227
01:05:43,641 --> 01:05:46,850
exceptionally diverse cultures and 
languages.

1228
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:51,900
So let's do that.
Okay,

1229
01:05:51,901 --> 01:05:52,734
well we could first start with the,
with the soviet people even now because 

1230
01:05:58,921 --> 01:05:59,754
it's like the 100 anniversary of the 
russian revolution are celebrating 

1231
01:06:02,761 --> 01:06:03,900
lennon.
it's like,

1232
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:07,260
that's not good.
that's like celebrating hitler.

1233
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:10,470
okay,
I'm dead serious about that.

1234
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:11,993
It's not good.
And the fact that people can dare to 

1235
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:15,744
think that that's okay means that 
there's something wrong with the way 

1236
01:06:18,631 --> 01:06:19,464
that we look at history.
Landon was a monster and if you want to 

1237
01:06:23,671 --> 01:06:24,504
know about that,
you can read solzhenitsyn's writings 

1238
01:06:25,801 --> 01:06:28,590
about lending because they communist 
apologist say,

1239
01:06:28,591 --> 01:06:29,450
well,
it wasn't landing.

1240
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:30,293
Len was a good guy.
He was all motivated by love of the 

1241
01:06:32,551 --> 01:06:34,080
working class.
It's like,

1242
01:06:34,081 --> 01:06:34,914
well,
his henchmen was stolen and if you're 

1243
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:40,350
hansman is stolen,
you're not a good guy.

1244
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:41,823
And and lenin was around during the 
early collectivization and if you read 

1245
01:06:46,441 --> 01:06:47,274
what he wrote,
you'll find out that he is perfectly 

1246
01:06:48,721 --> 01:06:49,554
willing to have any number of people die
as long as his ideological system could 

1247
01:06:53,101 --> 01:06:56,490
be brought into big.
So there's no celebrating lennon.

1248
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:57,533
There's no.
We're cool young marxist hip 

1249
01:06:59,491 --> 01:07:04,140
revolutionaries and he's our idol.
It's like there's none of that.

1250
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:08,160
Not if you know anything,
not if you're decent,

1251
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:11,393
whether it's death of the kulaks I told 
you about that there was a ukrainian 

1252
01:07:13,591 --> 01:07:15,630
famine that's 6 million.
Go there.

1253
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:18,780
There was the rise of the gulag state 
because it turned out that Russia,

1254
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:21,960
the soviet union couldn't run on the 
principles that it had,

1255
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:27,000
that it had a laid down as sacrosanct.
It just didn't work.

1256
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:27,834
So you had to enslave everybody and run 
your economy as a slave state 

1257
01:07:32,011 --> 01:07:32,844
essentially.
And try not to kill the people into 

1258
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,073
gulags so fast that you can't suck some 
productive labor out of them is the 

1259
01:07:41,571 --> 01:07:44,630
death of tens of millions of people.
We don't even know.

1260
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:45,523
The estimates range from 15 to $60 
million and like we won't get too picky 

1261
01:07:50,961 --> 01:07:51,794
even about the numbers because after the
first 10 million you kinda made your 

1262
01:07:54,681 --> 01:07:55,514
point and the fact that we don't know 
between 15 and 60 is actually an 

1263
01:07:59,991 --> 01:08:01,580
indication of the horror

1264
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,473
of it

1265
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:09,060
because our count is off by tens of 
millions and that's only within the last

1266
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:10,863
century and then there was the 1956 
crackdown on Hungary and the 19 eight 

1267
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:16,573
invasion of czechoslovakia.
Then there was the whole like thermo 

1268
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:23,750
nuclear holocaust thing that was going 
on at the same time and the fact that in

1269
01:08:23,751 --> 01:08:24,584
1962 and in 1984,
we were seconds away from complete 

1270
01:08:29,031 --> 01:08:29,990
annihilation,
right.

1271
01:08:29,991 --> 01:08:30,824
During the cuban missile crisis,
the keys were in the intercontinental 

1272
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:37,700
ballistic missile release systems and 
castro,

1273
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:41,960
as he admitted to jimmy carter case,
any of you are castro fans,

1274
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:43,183
which you shouldn't be.
That he was perfectly willing to have 

1275
01:08:46,461 --> 01:08:49,340
Cuba annihilated if it would've meant 
the defeat of the United States.

1276
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:56,930
And then in 1984 approximately,
I may have the date exactly wrong.

1277
01:08:57,390 --> 01:08:58,790
The russians received

1278
01:08:59,060 --> 01:08:59,720
an indication

1279
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:00,553
from their early warning systems that 
the americans had launched five thermal 

1280
01:09:03,101 --> 01:09:03,934
and nuclear missiles and one russian 
decided that it was a mistake and 

1281
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:13,850
refused to launch the retaliation and he
just died about two weeks ago.

1282
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:15,350
So,
you know,

1283
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:19,160
that was pretty close.
And uh,

1284
01:09:20,330 --> 01:09:23,120
so that was experiment number one.
Let's say that that wasn't good,

1285
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:25,640
that experiment,
let's put it that way.

1286
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:30,810
IT wasn't good.
It was exactly the antithesis of good.

1287
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:36,080
It was precisely the antithesis of good,
but that wasn't all.

1288
01:09:36,461 --> 01:09:37,294
I mean,
there's the people's republic of China 

1289
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:41,830
has a different country,
like seriously,

1290
01:09:41,831 --> 01:09:42,940
a different country,
right?

1291
01:09:42,941 --> 01:09:45,220
Different tradition,
different language.

1292
01:09:47,410 --> 01:09:50,590
How many people died in China under mao?
No one knows.

1293
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:52,773
Same issue with the soviet union.
Although myra was a bigger monster than 

1294
01:09:56,741 --> 01:09:57,940
stalin.
And that's,

1295
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:00,340
that's impressive.
You know,

1296
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,233
because there's hitler,
there's stalin and mao and of the three 

1297
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:09,940
mile was probably the worst.
He's still revered in China.

1298
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:13,720
Maybe that accounts for their affinity 
for North Korea,

1299
01:10:13,870 --> 01:10:18,490
which could still destroy us.
All the remnants of that horrible state.

1300
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:23,320
Maybe 100 million people died in China 
during the great leap forward.

1301
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:25,720
That's a hell of a leap forward.
Well,

1302
01:10:25,721 --> 01:10:27,250
maybe it wasn't a 100 million,
you know,

1303
01:10:27,251 --> 01:10:30,340
maybe it was only $40 million,
but as I said before,

1304
01:10:31,630 --> 01:10:33,520
when you're counting in the tens of 
millions,

1305
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:34,373
your points already made.
And then there was Cambodia and the 

1306
01:10:36,851 --> 01:10:37,684
killing fields and Bulgaria at east 
Germany and Romania and the democratic 

1307
01:10:40,931 --> 01:10:41,764
people's republic of Korea.
That's North Korea and Vietnam and 

1308
01:10:44,321 --> 01:10:45,970
Ethiopia,
Hungary,

1309
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:47,800
et cetera,
et cetera,

1310
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:48,693
et cetera.
There was never a successful communist 

1311
01:10:51,341 --> 01:10:55,590
state.
Cuba I suppose came closest,

1312
01:10:55,591 --> 01:10:56,820
but it was radically,

1313
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:58,083
um,

1314
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:02,550
the soviets poured money into Cuba.
So that doesn't really count.

1315
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:08,330
So then the first question was,
well,

1316
01:11:08,331 --> 01:11:12,360
are these marxists motivated by love or 
hatred?

1317
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:18,810
Well,
is it love or hatred that produces $100,

1318
01:11:18,831 --> 01:11:19,800
million dead people?

1319
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:21,173
Yeah.

1320
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:26,900
Is that enough evidence or not?
And if it's not enough evidence,

1321
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:29,300
if you think to yourself,
well that's not enough evidence,

1322
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:34,630
it was never really given its proper,
a proper try.

1323
01:11:36,610 --> 01:11:37,510
it's like,
well,

1324
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:40,150
what would have been a proper try?
See,

1325
01:11:40,151 --> 01:11:42,970
I always think when I hear someone say 
that I know what you think,

1326
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:49,320
you think in your delusional arrogance,
did you understand the marxist doctrines

1327
01:11:49,761 --> 01:11:50,594
better than anyone else ever has,
and that if you were the one 

1328
01:11:53,031 --> 01:11:57,370
implementing those doctrines,
you would have ushered in the utopia.

1329
01:11:58,090 --> 01:12:01,230
That's what you mean when you say that,
and

1330
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:05,670
no,
they're say,

1331
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:08,630
and there's an idea in the new testament
that there's a sin.

1332
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:12,370
It's a sin against the holy ghost.
If you commit that sand,

1333
01:12:12,371 --> 01:12:17,140
no one really knows what it is
that you can't be forgiven,

1334
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:18,490
and I would say,
well,

1335
01:12:18,970 --> 01:12:19,803
if you want a candidate for the sin 
against the holy ghost and the 21st 

1336
01:12:22,721 --> 01:12:25,420
century,
the statement

1337
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:28,293
communism,
real communism was never tried with the 

1338
01:12:31,451 --> 01:12:35,050
underlying idea that if you had been the
person implementing it,

1339
01:12:35,051 --> 01:12:35,884
it would have worked.
I think that's a pretty good contender 

1340
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:41,710
for something for which you should never
be forgiven.

1341
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:45,863
Okay.

1342
01:12:46,130 --> 01:12:47,720
Alright,
so that's marxism.

1343
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:53,260
So let's go on to postmodernism.
We talked a little bit about it.

1344
01:12:59,810 --> 01:13:00,890
Now,
hypothetically,

1345
01:13:01,820 --> 01:13:02,653
it's an attitude of skepticism,
irony towards rejection of grand 

1346
01:13:05,481 --> 01:13:07,520
narratives,
ideologies and universalism.

1347
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:11,360
CriT criticizes objective notions of 
reason,

1348
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:13,190
human nature,
social progress,

1349
01:13:13,191 --> 01:13:14,024
absolute truth in objective reality.
It's predicated on the idea that the 

1350
01:13:18,091 --> 01:13:18,924
reason that you categorize especially 
the reason that you categorize is to 

1351
01:13:23,011 --> 01:13:26,010
marginalize you.
Categorize,

1352
01:13:26,011 --> 01:13:28,050
to marginalized,
to obtain power.

1353
01:13:28,210 --> 01:13:33,210
Power is pretty much all there is.
There's other elements of postmodernism.

1354
01:13:34,791 --> 01:13:38,600
One of them is that human nature is 
merely a social construct.

1355
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:42,650
See the reason for that as far as I'm 
concerned,

1356
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:44,390
and this is a postmodern critique as 
well,

1357
01:13:44,391 --> 01:13:47,870
I'm going to move the center to the 
margin and the margin to the centers.

1358
01:13:48,230 --> 01:13:51,500
Why would you think that human nature is
only a social construct?

1359
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:52,781
Well,
here's why.

1360
01:13:52,781 --> 01:13:55,570
It's because that means you could 
construct it any way you want to.

1361
01:13:56,790 --> 01:13:59,760
That was a very common idea among this,
among the communists.

1362
01:13:59,761 --> 01:14:00,594
You know they.
That's why michael wanted to wipe out 

1363
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:03,473
chinese history.
That's why the red guard went around in 

1364
01:14:05,131 --> 01:14:05,964
China and tried to destroy everything,
every element of china's history prior 

1365
01:14:10,171 --> 01:14:14,500
to approximately 1960 at that great 
culture.

1366
01:14:14,501 --> 01:14:16,660
Thousands and thousands of years old as 
well.

1367
01:14:16,661 --> 01:14:20,500
So you could bring in the new man,
but what does the new man.

1368
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:23,980
Well it was whatever slave mile happened
to fantasize about,

1369
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:27,490
or it was the utopian person.
You take your pick.

1370
01:14:27,491 --> 01:14:30,640
But like I said,
if you take a look at the corpses,

1371
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:34,240
you can pretty much figure out which of 
those two it was.

1372
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:40,320
So what's up with these people?
These deconstructionists postmodernists.

1373
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:43,090
What are they up to exactly?
Well,

1374
01:14:43,091 --> 01:14:44,200
here's the first thing

1375
01:14:48,670 --> 01:14:53,380
they came about pretty much when marxism
was no longer credible,

1376
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:57,940
no longer tenable as an intellectual set
of intellectual propositions.

1377
01:14:57,941 --> 01:15:00,220
Now,
if you were a french intellectual,

1378
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:01,953
you had to have a lot of corpses piled 
at your feet before you were willing to 

1379
01:15:04,241 --> 01:15:08,650
think that you were wrong.
So here's an example,

1380
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:09,903
I don't remember his name.
He was the architect of the killing 

1381
01:15:12,941 --> 01:15:15,280
fields in Cambodia,
wasn't pol pot.

1382
01:15:15,281 --> 01:15:17,830
It was one of his advisors.
Unfortunately,

1383
01:15:17,831 --> 01:15:20,890
I can't remember his name.
He took his phd at the bomb

1384
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:23,373
and he developed the thesis in the 
sorbonne what marxists thesis that the 

1385
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:32,260
cities were parasites on,
on the land.

1386
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:33,753
You know,
it's an extension of the whole 

1387
01:15:34,241 --> 01:15:37,960
bourgeoisie proletarian thing.
The cities were full of bourgeois types,

1388
01:15:37,961 --> 01:15:38,794
educated and educated parasites 
essentially who were doing nothing but 

1389
01:15:42,491 --> 01:15:47,491
stealing what was rightly the farmers,
so when he came back to Cambodia,

1390
01:15:49,930 --> 01:15:54,670
he put that into action and emptied out 
the cities and put all the intellectuals

1391
01:15:54,671 --> 01:15:57,070
and the city dwellers either to death or
to work,

1392
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:57,933
which generally resulted in death and 
killed about one six to one quarter of 

1393
01:16:02,561 --> 01:16:06,100
the population,
but he got his phd from the bomb

1394
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:08,453
and that's a good story because that's 
exactly how complicit the western 

1395
01:16:12,701 --> 01:16:13,534
leftist intellectuals were in 
facilitating the horrors of the 20th 

1396
01:16:17,501 --> 01:16:20,410
century and it's not like we've learned 
anything since then.

1397
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:21,303
Quite the contrary,
but just gone underground and that's 

1398
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:25,623
what I see.
That's what I see when I see 

1399
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:30,790
postmodernism.
So what happened was

1400
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:39,120
despite the affinity of western 
intellectuals for marxism,

1401
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:44,710
maybe because they weren't paid as much 
as bankers,

1402
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:47,110
let's say if we're being cynical about 
it,

1403
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:48,273
because I've often thought that if you 
paid sociologists as much as investment 

1404
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:53,230
bankers,
they'd be capitalist very rapidly.

1405
01:16:56,020 --> 01:17:00,640
Which is also to say that you may 
underpay intellectuals at your peril and

1406
01:17:00,641 --> 01:17:01,474
you know that's actually dangerous 
because one of the things that's 

1407
01:17:03,341 --> 01:17:04,174
happening is that as the universities 
have become corporatized and corrupted 

1408
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:08,164
in a variety of ways,
more and more of the professors or 

1409
01:17:10,161 --> 01:17:11,370
adjuncts,
right?

1410
01:17:11,371 --> 01:17:12,710
I think it's up to 30,
40,

1411
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:14,240
50 percent,
something like that.

1412
01:17:14,241 --> 01:17:15,074
Now they've got no tenure,
they've got no job security and they're 

1413
01:17:16,971 --> 01:17:17,804
paid like $24,000 a year.
It's not a good idea to radicalize the 

1414
01:17:21,391 --> 01:17:24,000
people that are teaching your children.
But anyways,

1415
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:27,673
yeah,

1416
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:30,033
by the end of the sixties,
so much data on the catastrophic 

1417
01:17:35,861 --> 01:17:36,694
failures of communism had accrued that 
even the most intransigent of french 

1418
01:17:41,741 --> 01:17:45,310
intellectuals had to admit that the jig 
was up.

1419
01:17:47,290 --> 01:17:52,290
but that's a problem because that's the 
whole ideology,

1420
01:17:52,421 --> 01:17:55,450
right?
That's the whole raison d'etre.

1421
01:17:55,990 --> 01:18:00,990
He says in his terrible alberta french,
you're going to just give that up.

1422
01:18:02,081 --> 01:18:06,490
What are you goIng to do after that?
Well,

1423
01:18:06,491 --> 01:18:11,491
what happened was postmodernism was 
invented and so it's a slight of hand as

1424
01:18:11,831 --> 01:18:13,910
far as I can tell.
So and,

1425
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:16,660
and with postmodernism identity 
politics,

1426
01:18:16,661 --> 01:18:21,661
and so the postmodern transformation is,
well,

1427
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,670
we're a little wrong with the working 
class thing.

1428
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:25,753
Turns out that communists killed them 
all and capitalists make them all rich 

1429
01:18:30,311 --> 01:18:33,100
and that's actually exactly the opposite
of what we predicted,

1430
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:38,110
but maybe there's still a way this could
be salvaged.

1431
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:42,880
How about if we,
we don't say working class capitalists,

1432
01:18:42,881 --> 01:18:46,250
we say oppressor or oppressed.
We'll just.

1433
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:50,633
Well just trends transformed the 
terminology a bit and we'll start 

1434
01:18:53,611 --> 01:18:54,444
thinking about all the other ways that 
people plural pressed and then and all 

1435
01:18:57,231 --> 01:19:00,140
the other ways that people are 
oppressors and then we can play the same

1436
01:19:00,141 --> 01:19:02,060
damn game under a new guys

1437
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:06,160
and now lord the postmodernists were 
marxists.

1438
01:19:06,190 --> 01:19:07,023
So let's make no mistake about that.
Darren himself said that postmodernism 

1439
01:19:10,091 --> 01:19:12,940
was a transformation of marxism.
I'm not making this up.

1440
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:14,950
The question is why?
Well,

1441
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:15,963
because you could say what?
Postmodernism is a valid philosophical 

1442
01:19:18,131 --> 01:19:21,370
school and we'll get into that for a 
minute and they make some valid claims.

1443
01:19:21,371 --> 01:19:22,390
One of them,
for example,

1444
01:19:22,391 --> 01:19:23,224
this is a central postmodernist claim,
is that there's an infinite number of 

1445
01:19:25,661 --> 01:19:26,494
ways of interpreting the world and that 
actually turns out to be technically 

1446
01:19:29,171 --> 01:19:31,960
correct.
Part of the reason that we've had a very

1447
01:19:31,961 --> 01:19:32,794
difficult time building robots,
ai robots that can operate in the real 

1448
01:19:36,371 --> 01:19:37,204
world,
is because perceiving the real world 

1449
01:19:38,411 --> 01:19:42,420
turns out to be so difficult that we 
really can't figure out how human beings

1450
01:19:42,421 --> 01:19:47,421
do it because it is susceptible to an 
infinite number of interpretations.

1451
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:48,533
So that's actually correct.
Now I'm not going to give the 

1452
01:19:49,730 --> 01:19:50,563
postmodernists a tremendous amount of 
credit for discovering that because it 

1453
01:19:53,461 --> 01:19:57,180
was discovered simultaneously in about 
five disciplines at pretty much the same

1454
01:19:57,181 --> 01:19:59,940
time,
but you give the devil his due,

1455
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:05,900
so.
So what's the logic?

1456
01:20:07,190 --> 01:20:07,861
Something like,
well,

1457
01:20:07,861 --> 01:20:08,010
there's

1458
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:10,260
an infinite number of interpretations of
the world.

1459
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:14,450
You can't tell which of those are 
canonically,

1460
01:20:14,451 --> 01:20:15,680
correct?
Correct.

1461
01:20:17,150 --> 01:20:21,170
The basic narrative of human struggle as
oppressor versus oppressed,

1462
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:22,903
we use category structures can constrain
that infinite number of interpretations 

1463
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:30,080
because the basic narrative is an 
oppressor versus oppressed.

1464
01:20:30,081 --> 01:20:34,790
We choose those narratIves that serve 
our function as old pressers,

1465
01:20:36,630 --> 01:20:38,190
so it's

1466
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:44,800
deeply cynical but credible,
you know,

1467
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:45,653
and you can say if you're not naive that
people are motivated by power and that 

1468
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:55,630
our interpretations of the world can be 
self serving.

1469
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:56,493
I mean we do want to serve ourselves 
after all because otherwise we die and 

1470
01:20:59,891 --> 01:21:00,724
so and we are centered in one place and 
so we can't see everything and we're 

1471
01:21:04,781 --> 01:21:09,781
biased so,
so there is the probability that the way

1472
01:21:09,941 --> 01:21:10,774
that we look at the world will be 
tainted by narrow self interest and 

1473
01:21:15,311 --> 01:21:20,311
maybe even tainted by ingroup interests 
beyond narrow individual self interest.

1474
01:21:20,471 --> 01:21:23,260
And we know thIs is true,
but it's also not all bad.

1475
01:21:23,261 --> 01:21:24,420
You know,
like we,

1476
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,980
a good person takes care of his or her 
family.

1477
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:29,980
What does that mean?
It means you prefer your family.

1478
01:21:29,981 --> 01:21:32,470
The outsiders are going to get rid of 
that.

1479
01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:33,603
It's a form of prejudice.
Like it really is like your choice of 

1480
01:21:37,001 --> 01:21:37,930
sexual partners.

1481
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,890
A form of prejudice,
right?

1482
01:21:39,891 --> 01:21:43,900
I mean maybe it should be distributed in
an egalitarianism manner.

1483
01:21:44,290 --> 01:21:45,123
Hey,
that would be a lot funnier if it isn't 

1484
01:21:49,931 --> 01:21:52,570
a possibility like in,
in,

1485
01:21:52,571 --> 01:21:53,470
in,
in,

1486
01:21:53,590 --> 01:21:57,580
in huxley's brave new world.
That was the rule you,

1487
01:21:57,640 --> 01:21:58,473
you shared yourself with whoever asked 
because it was rude not to and you know 

1488
01:22:01,511 --> 01:22:05,740
what it is actually rude not to.
It's seriously rude.

1489
01:22:06,220 --> 01:22:07,053
Now,
is that something you want to take away 

1490
01:22:07,451 --> 01:22:08,284
from people?
You want that to be distributed in an 

1491
01:22:10,121 --> 01:22:10,954
egalitarianism fashion.
How prejudiced are you when you choose 

1492
01:22:14,921 --> 01:22:19,570
someone to sleep with you choose that 
person and not everyone else.

1493
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:22,210
It's the ultimate in prejudice.
If you say,

1494
01:22:22,211 --> 01:22:23,410
well,
that's not prejudicial.

1495
01:22:23,470 --> 01:22:24,340
Oh yes,
it is.

1496
01:22:24,730 --> 01:22:27,370
Usually go for the most attractive 
partner you can find.

1497
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:29,073
Usually go for the healthiest partner 
you go for the best person you can find 

1498
01:22:32,141 --> 01:22:37,141
who could tolerate you prejudicial in 
every possible way so

1499
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:41,741
well,
so okay,

1500
01:22:41,741 --> 01:22:42,574
so your self serving and you construct a
view of the world that serves those 

1501
01:22:47,411 --> 01:22:50,890
selfserving causes and some of that has 
to do with power.

1502
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:52,593
Fair enough.
That doesn't mean it all has to do with 

1503
01:22:54,551 --> 01:22:55,384
power

1504
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:56,833
though.

1505
01:22:57,220 --> 01:22:59,560
It means that some of it has to do with 
power.

1506
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:00,633
It's like racism,
people are kind of racist or maybe 

1507
01:23:03,491 --> 01:23:04,324
people prefer their ingroup.
It's not that easy or maybe people 

1508
01:23:06,911 --> 01:23:07,744
prefer the familiar to the novel.
You know that I eat that the social 

1509
01:23:12,281 --> 01:23:13,114
psychologists have come up with implicit
association test that measures 

1510
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:16,653
unconscious bias.
We don't know what the hell that 

1511
01:23:18,401 --> 01:23:20,980
measures the people who invented that 
bloody thing.

1512
01:23:20,981 --> 01:23:22,630
They know we don't know what it 
measures.

1513
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:23,943
They know it's not reliable.
They know it's not valid enough to be 

1514
01:23:27,131 --> 01:23:29,470
used as an individual diagnostic 
instrument.

1515
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:30,573
That's technically the case.
They also know that you can't train 

1516
01:23:34,451 --> 01:23:35,284
people out of their unconscious biases 
because there is not much difference 

1517
01:23:38,021 --> 01:23:41,770
between the unconscious bias and 
instantaneous perception,

1518
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:47,510
but they don't really care.
I've I've written to mazda and banerji.

1519
01:23:48,070 --> 01:23:50,740
He's one of the inventors of the iet 
several times saying,

1520
01:23:50,950 --> 01:23:53,920
how about you come out in public and say
what you already know?

1521
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:57,130
Which is that people are misusing your 
damn test.

1522
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:59,740
Silence.
Well,

1523
01:23:59,741 --> 01:24:00,574
that's partly because her discipline,
social psychology is a corrupt 

1524
01:24:02,801 --> 01:24:06,550
discipline as the social psychologists 
have discovered over the last four years

1525
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:10,750
and be turning themselves inside out 
trying to rectify which they haven't

1526
01:24:12,810 --> 01:24:13,643
anyways,

1527
01:24:13,910 --> 01:24:14,743
we're giving the devil his due.
There's an infinite number of 

1528
01:24:16,851 --> 01:24:17,684
interpretations of the world and it's 
highly probable that you'll lay a self 

1529
01:24:20,411 --> 01:24:22,850
serving one on top of it.
Yes,

1530
01:24:22,851 --> 01:24:24,980
and also that will serve the interests 
of your group.

1531
01:24:24,981 --> 01:24:26,840
However you define that,
yes,

1532
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:29,810
but it only accounts for a fraction of 
your behavior.

1533
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:33,410
There's all sorts of other things that 
work as well and you don't get to reduce

1534
01:24:33,411 --> 01:24:36,290
all human motivations to one motivation 
power,

1535
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:37,720
and then you might also ask,
well,

1536
01:24:37,721 --> 01:24:40,430
why would you want to reduce all human 
motivations to power?

1537
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:41,473
It's so you can use power.
That's why you can justify the use of 

1538
01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:46,783
power that's force.
You don't have to engage in civilized 

1539
01:24:50,151 --> 01:24:50,984
debate.
You don't have to give a damn about the 

1540
01:24:51,741 --> 01:24:53,930
facts,
especially if you're not a postmodernist

1541
01:24:54,170 --> 01:24:55,850
because you don't believe in facts 
anyways,

1542
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:56,900
and you might ask,
well,

1543
01:24:56,901 --> 01:24:57,640
why don't you?
Hey,

1544
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:59,660
I'm not kidding.
I'm not kidding.

1545
01:24:59,810 --> 01:25:00,643
Postmodernists don't believe in facts.
They believe that the idea of fact is 

1546
01:25:04,941 --> 01:25:05,774
part of the power game that's place 
played by the white dominated male 

1547
01:25:10,161 --> 01:25:10,994
patriarchy to impose the theoretical 
structure of the patriarchy on the 

1548
01:25:15,111 --> 01:25:18,200
oppressors.
It's like I'm not making this stuff up.

1549
01:25:18,230 --> 01:25:19,130
It's embedded,
right?

1550
01:25:19,131 --> 01:25:19,964
In theory,
all you have to do is read it and you 

1551
01:25:21,771 --> 01:25:25,130
find this out so they don't believe in 
facts.

1552
01:25:25,131 --> 01:25:27,380
While facts would constrain the use of 
power,

1553
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:29,630
at least that's how it looks to me.

1554
01:25:32,150 --> 01:25:33,050
Okay,
so fine.

1555
01:25:33,051 --> 01:25:33,884
We gave the devil his due.
There's an infinite number of 

1556
01:25:35,331 --> 01:25:40,331
interpretations and you're likely to use
bias compression algorithms on the world

1557
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:43,670
and they're likely to be biased in your 
favor.

1558
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:45,633
True,

1559
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:47,993
but

1560
01:25:50,450 --> 01:25:51,350
only partly true.

1561
01:25:53,930 --> 01:25:54,763
And the difference between an idea log 
and the thinker is that a thinker knows 

1562
01:25:58,131 --> 01:25:58,964
the difference between things that are 
only partly true and things that are 

1563
01:26:02,361 --> 01:26:05,150
completely true.
Things are complicated.

1564
01:26:05,151 --> 01:26:09,020
Like I like to think everything is as 
complicated as a military helicopter.

1565
01:26:09,830 --> 01:26:10,663
You have to like,
I think it's eight hours of maintenance 

1566
01:26:12,291 --> 01:26:16,340
to keep those things in the air for one 
hour because they don't fly there rocks.

1567
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:19,640
They plummet.
It's really hard to keep them in the air

1568
01:26:19,730 --> 01:26:22,970
and they're full of parts and if you 
don't know all those parts,

1569
01:26:22,971 --> 01:26:26,000
you don't go in there and monkey about 
with them because just wreck it.

1570
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:27,103
And that's just a helicopter.
Like everything is way more complicated 

1571
01:26:31,251 --> 01:26:33,470
than the helicopter,
so you don't just go muck about in there

1572
01:26:33,471 --> 01:26:36,320
hoping you're going to make it better.
That isn't how it works.

1573
01:26:36,770 --> 01:26:37,300
You need to be

1574
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:39,340
competent.
Alright,

1575
01:26:39,370 --> 01:26:40,203
so look,

1576
01:26:40,990 --> 01:26:41,823
here's where the postmodernists sarong I
think there's three places and they're 

1577
01:26:44,850 --> 01:26:45,683
serious errors.
The first is that there is an infinite 

1578
01:26:49,091 --> 01:26:49,924
number of interpretations,
but there is not an infinite number of 

1579
01:26:51,821 --> 01:26:52,654
viable interpretation.
So there's a very finite number of 

1580
01:26:54,790 --> 01:26:57,970
viable interpretations and I don't think
that this is theory.

1581
01:26:58,600 --> 01:26:59,433
I think that game theorists have already
demonstrated this to some degree and 

1582
01:27:02,201 --> 01:27:04,750
it's going to be built into ai systems 
very rapidly.

1583
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,490
Okay,
so what are the constraints?

1584
01:27:06,850 --> 01:27:07,661
Okay.
First of all,

1585
01:27:07,661 --> 01:27:08,494
you can't have an interpretation that 
leads to immediately to your death or 

1586
01:27:11,531 --> 01:27:12,640
your dad.
Now,

1587
01:27:12,641 --> 01:27:14,530
if you want to be dead,
that's fine,

1588
01:27:14,531 --> 01:27:18,280
but if you don't want to be,
then you got a lot of limited options,

1589
01:27:18,340 --> 01:27:19,173
right?
You don't get to run naked across an 

1590
01:27:21,101 --> 01:27:25,060
eight lane freeway at night blindfolded 
because probably you'll be dead.

1591
01:27:25,390 --> 01:27:28,030
That's a bad interpretation.
Okay,

1592
01:27:28,031 --> 01:27:32,170
so you might say because you're fragile 
and vulnerable and mortal,

1593
01:27:32,410 --> 01:27:33,243
that there's a limited number of ways 
that you can look at the world that 

1594
01:27:36,101 --> 01:27:36,934
don't result in,
let's say death or serious damage or 

1595
01:27:40,031 --> 01:27:41,860
agony.
That's a bad thing.

1596
01:27:41,861 --> 01:27:44,530
Agony is a bad thing.
Most people agreed on that.

1597
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,260
So you're constrained by pain and 
anxiety.

1598
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:48,213
At least your interpretations are 
constrained by pain and anxiety and you 

1599
01:27:51,881 --> 01:27:56,290
know you can make pain worse or better 
by thinking about it to some degree,

1600
01:27:56,320 --> 01:28:00,220
but only to some degree.
When push comes to shove,

1601
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,290
pain is your master.

1602
01:28:03,870 --> 01:28:05,490
Okay?
So that's a big constraint.

1603
01:28:05,491 --> 01:28:07,360
That's a big,
big constraint.

1604
01:28:07,710 --> 01:28:08,543
Well,
but the constraints are worse than that 

1605
01:28:09,631 --> 01:28:11,780
because not only do you not

1606
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:13,953
get to have an interpretation of the 
world that produces anxiety and 

1607
01:28:16,161 --> 01:28:16,994
suffering right now,
but you don't get to have an 

1608
01:28:18,891 --> 01:28:19,724
interpretation of the world that if you 
iterated across time produces pain and 

1609
01:28:23,391 --> 01:28:25,370
suffering.
And so that's,

1610
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:27,500
that's a big problem because there's 
lots of.

1611
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:28,513
You could go out tonight and get 
yourself blind drunk on cocaine and 

1612
01:28:31,371 --> 01:28:33,800
sleep with hookers and you know,
maybe that,

1613
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:35,690
maybe that'd be a good night.
You know,

1614
01:28:35,870 --> 01:28:37,940
you might not think about it being so 
good tomorrow,

1615
01:28:37,941 --> 01:28:41,960
but then maybe your dad of aids in a 
year or maybe you're addicted to cocaine

1616
01:28:41,961 --> 01:28:44,330
or maybe you're a street alcoholic or 
whatever.

1617
01:28:44,331 --> 01:28:47,660
It's like as an iterable game,
that's a downhill.

1618
01:28:48,050 --> 01:28:50,330
And the thing is you play iterated 
games.

1619
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:52,400
You don't play one,
you play iterated games.

1620
01:28:52,401 --> 01:28:56,540
And so your interpretation of the world 
has to be one that will sustain multiple

1621
01:28:56,541 --> 01:28:57,374
iterations across time because you have 
to worry about 40 year old you and 60 

1622
01:29:02,191 --> 01:29:03,150
year old you.

1623
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:04,343
And that's a big problem.
That's a lot of use stretched over a 

1624
01:29:06,481 --> 01:29:07,314
long period of time.
And it's worse than that because it's 

1625
01:29:09,331 --> 01:29:12,390
not just you,
it's like you and your family,

1626
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:14,280
right?
And not only so,

1627
01:29:14,281 --> 01:29:17,670
not only do you have to take care of 
yourself now in a manner that allows you

1628
01:29:17,671 --> 01:29:22,470
to take care of yourself when you're 40,
you have to take care of yourself now in

1629
01:29:22,471 --> 01:29:27,270
a manner that takes care of you when 
you're 40 so that other people are happy

1630
01:29:27,271 --> 01:29:28,104
to have you around now and continually 
so that they'll cooperate and compete 

1631
01:29:31,921 --> 01:29:32,754
with you in a positive way.
And so that's getting ridiculously 

1632
01:29:36,421 --> 01:29:37,254
complicated.
It's not just you now when you in the 

1633
01:29:38,461 --> 01:29:39,294
future,
it's you surrounded by other people 

1634
01:29:41,011 --> 01:29:41,844
doing the same thing now and in the 
future and there's a lot of other 

1635
01:29:44,191 --> 01:29:47,100
people.
It can even just be you and your family,

1636
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:48,030
you know,
like,

1637
01:29:48,030 --> 01:29:52,740
like the psychopathic burglar mob that's
just not going to go so well,

1638
01:29:52,770 --> 01:29:53,010
right?

1639
01:29:53,010 --> 01:29:57,510
Other people are going to object and the
world's going to object and so fine.

1640
01:29:57,511 --> 01:29:59,520
There's an infinite number of 
interpretations,

1641
01:29:59,730 --> 01:30:02,460
but it doesn't mean there's an infinite 
number of viable interpretations.

1642
01:30:02,461 --> 01:30:04,050
In fact,
there are hardly any.

1643
01:30:04,140 --> 01:30:07,610
There are hardly any playable games.
Now piaget,

1644
01:30:07,910 --> 01:30:08,743
piaget,
the developmental psychologist who's a 

1645
01:30:09,841 --> 01:30:10,674
very smart guy,
he pointed out something very 

1646
01:30:12,781 --> 01:30:13,890
interesting.
He said,

1647
01:30:14,070 --> 01:30:14,903
now imagine you ran a set of iterated 
games as a competition and in one 

1648
01:30:19,201 --> 01:30:22,590
iterated game the rule was you bloody 
well do what I tell you to,

1649
01:30:23,430 --> 01:30:24,780
and the other one is,
well,

1650
01:30:24,781 --> 01:30:27,060
we'll all get together and decide how 
we're going to do this.

1651
01:30:27,061 --> 01:30:28,710
Okay,
now we run the competition.

1652
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:32,220
Uh,
piaget's claim is you do what I tell you

1653
01:30:32,221 --> 01:30:33,054
fails.
And the reason for that is I have to 

1654
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:38,130
impose force in order to keep you 
cooperating.

1655
01:30:38,430 --> 01:30:40,890
And the imposition of forest is a cost.

1656
01:30:41,190 --> 01:30:42,023
It's an efficiency cost.
And across time that efficiency cost is 

1657
01:30:45,181 --> 01:30:48,420
going to multiply.
And the equilibrated state solution,

1658
01:30:48,421 --> 01:30:51,090
which is the one where we all agree it 
winds.

1659
01:30:51,870 --> 01:30:54,840
Now that's worth thinking about.
You can think about that locally.

1660
01:30:54,841 --> 01:30:56,820
So you've got,
you're trying to organize your family,

1661
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:58,073
you have a little family conference 
about who's doing what in the household 

1662
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:01,463
and what do you.
If you want peace and harmony and an 

1663
01:31:03,571 --> 01:31:05,730
iterated game,
you get everybody to say,

1664
01:31:05,731 --> 01:31:06,564
well,
here's the tasks and we they have to be 

1665
01:31:08,491 --> 01:31:10,200
done.
People have to agree on that,

1666
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:11,041
and then you say,
well,

1667
01:31:11,041 --> 01:31:11,874
which task would you do?
You have to some how about you and you 

1668
01:31:14,581 --> 01:31:18,780
know which task would you do and 
everybody agrees and then you say,

1669
01:31:18,781 --> 01:31:19,614
well,
unless you can come up with a better 

1670
01:31:20,251 --> 01:31:22,050
solution,
that's the one we're going to go with,

1671
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:25,800
and then people can be a little 
resentful and angry about the conditions

1672
01:31:25,801 --> 01:31:26,634
of existence where they have to work,
but they can't really blame that on 

1673
01:31:29,281 --> 01:31:32,550
anyone else and maybe that's the best 
solution you could come up with.

1674
01:31:32,550 --> 01:31:35,130
And that was pIaget's idea of the 
equilibrium state.

1675
01:31:35,131 --> 01:31:40,131
It was like it's a voluntary agreement 
that can be iterated across time.

1676
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:44,460
That works at multiple levels of social 
organization.

1677
01:31:45,450 --> 01:31:46,980
Man,
that's a serious,

1678
01:31:46,981 --> 01:31:49,140
serious,
serious set of constraints.

1679
01:31:49,530 --> 01:31:50,700
And piaget,
by the way,

1680
01:31:50,710 --> 01:31:54,570
was looking for a way to reconcile 
science and religion.

1681
01:31:54,720 --> 01:31:55,553
He was looking for biological origin to 
morality and he thought he found it in 

1682
01:31:59,171 --> 01:32:02,320
the idea of the state and it's even 
deeper than that.

1683
01:32:02,321 --> 01:32:07,321
So imagine this equilibrium state ideas.
Actually there's something to it that if

1684
01:32:07,571 --> 01:32:11,980
you set the the state up property,
it will iterate across time so long that

1685
01:32:11,981 --> 01:32:14,140
it becomes a permanent part of the 
environment.

1686
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:17,080
Hierarchy is exactly.
That's exactly what the hierarchy is.

1687
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:22,200
Hierarchies are 350 million years old.
They're not the patriarchal invention of

1688
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:27,070
white european christian males in the 
last 300 years.

1689
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:29,770
There are 350 million years old.

1690
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:30,783
They're stable,
they're stable solutions to this 

1691
01:32:33,071 --> 01:32:33,904
iterated game problem and they've been 
around so long that we're actually 

1692
01:32:36,101 --> 01:32:36,934
adapted to the and that's part of the 
reason we have archetypal 

1693
01:32:39,431 --> 01:32:40,264
representations of the social structure.
So and then we also have archetypal 

1694
01:32:43,721 --> 01:32:48,721
representations of the relationship of 
the individual to the social structure.

1695
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:49,953
Your job as an individual in 
relationship to the social structure is 

1696
01:32:53,291 --> 01:32:58,291
to embody the social structure,
but also to serve as as its eyes and its

1697
01:32:58,511 --> 01:33:03,511
mouth so that can update itself when 
necessarily so you take on the mantle of

1698
01:33:04,511 --> 01:33:06,310
your father,
let's say,

1699
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:09,940
but he's dead.
He's the path he can't see.

1700
01:33:09,970 --> 01:33:13,060
You can see,
so you take the structure that's already

1701
01:33:13,061 --> 01:33:13,894
there and you modify it where it's 
necessary and that modification process 

1702
01:33:17,231 --> 01:33:18,064
is necessary or the state becomes too 
static and collapses and that's why the 

1703
01:33:21,581 --> 01:33:22,414
state has to be subordinate to the 
individual and that's what western 

1704
01:33:25,031 --> 01:33:29,110
culture has discovered and we can't just
let it go.

1705
01:33:29,111 --> 01:33:30,490
That's the idea.
The logos,

1706
01:33:30,491 --> 01:33:31,324
that's a big idea and you'd want to live
somewhere where you want to live 

1707
01:33:35,051 --> 01:33:37,480
somewhere where the individual is 
subordinate to the state.

1708
01:33:37,481 --> 01:33:38,170
It's like,
hey,

1709
01:33:38,170 --> 01:33:40,030
go right ahead.
There's lots of places like that,

1710
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:42,190
man,
emigrate go there.

1711
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:45,340
Ninety percent of the world's countries 
are like that.

1712
01:33:45,490 --> 01:33:46,900
If you want to live like that,
man,

1713
01:33:46,901 --> 01:33:51,250
go find out what it's like.
You don't see immigration going there.

1714
01:33:51,370 --> 01:33:52,210
That's for sure.

1715
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:55,083
Okay,
so that's a big mistake that the 

1716
01:33:56,010 --> 01:33:58,480
postmodernist made.
It's not trivial.

1717
01:33:58,481 --> 01:34:00,580
That's a big mistake,
but it's not the only one.

1718
01:34:01,270 --> 01:34:02,290
Well,
here's another one.

1719
01:34:02,740 --> 01:34:04,510
They don't like inequality.
Well,

1720
01:34:04,511 --> 01:34:05,344
who does?

1721
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:10,350
I'm against poverty.
You know,

1722
01:34:10,351 --> 01:34:13,020
that's like classic protest sign.
It's like,

1723
01:34:13,021 --> 01:34:17,190
really?
It's like I'm against torture.

1724
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:18,053
It's like it's so obvious.
You don't get any brownie points for 

1725
01:34:21,601 --> 01:34:22,434
being against poverty.
No one in their right mind is for 

1726
01:34:25,051 --> 01:34:28,160
poverty.
You,

1727
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:33,120
you ever watch the simpsons?
You ever see the republican party in the

1728
01:34:33,121 --> 01:34:33,954
simpsons,
they all meet in an old haunted castle 

1729
01:34:35,581 --> 01:34:36,414
at night with like lightening bolts 
going off and there's a vampire and a 

1730
01:34:38,941 --> 01:34:39,774
crazy texts and then even the simpson 
republicans don't sit around in the 

1731
01:34:43,921 --> 01:34:46,170
haunted tower at midnight saying,
hey,

1732
01:34:46,200 --> 01:34:51,200
we need more poverty.
Here's an interesting thing.

1733
01:34:56,651 --> 01:34:57,484
So one of the postmodernist claims is 
that diversity is necessary and they 

1734
01:35:00,681 --> 01:35:05,360
make it racial and they make it sexual.
They may get ethnIc and all of that.

1735
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,760
That's actually technically incorrect by
the way,

1736
01:35:07,761 --> 01:35:08,594
because

1737
01:35:10,100 --> 01:35:10,933
I study individual differences.
So those are the differences between 

1738
01:35:13,551 --> 01:35:16,190
people.
I know the literature.

1739
01:35:16,191 --> 01:35:19,930
So you know about James Morris memo 
right from google.

1740
01:35:19,950 --> 01:35:22,130
He wrote that partly because he was 
watching my videos,

1741
01:35:22,131 --> 01:35:22,964
which is why he wanted me to interview 
him and I'm a believer that there are 

1742
01:35:26,541 --> 01:35:27,374
biological differences in temperament 
between men and women apart from the 

1743
01:35:30,471 --> 01:35:31,304
other obvious differences and that 
they're actually not trivial and that 

1744
01:35:34,891 --> 01:35:35,724
they maximizing the societies that have 
the most have moved farthest to 

1745
01:35:39,441 --> 01:35:43,580
producing egalitarian states,
the scandinavian countries,

1746
01:35:43,730 --> 01:35:44,563
and that.
The reason for that is that there's two 

1747
01:35:45,471 --> 01:35:47,420
reasons why men and women,
different temperament.

1748
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:48,283
One is biological and the other is 
environmental and if you remove the 

1749
01:35:51,501 --> 01:35:53,360
environmental variation,
which you do,

1750
01:35:53,361 --> 01:35:54,194
if you make the state egalitarian,
you maximize the genetic variation and 

1751
01:35:58,310 --> 01:35:59,143
that's been demonstrated in the 
scientific literature over about four 

1752
01:36:01,821 --> 01:36:02,654
decades and no one wanted it or hope for
it and they weren't biased and looking 

1753
01:36:06,381 --> 01:36:07,214
for it because that was exactly the 
opposite of what social scientists 

1754
01:36:09,291 --> 01:36:10,124
wanted to find.
BecAuse social scientists lean heavily 

1755
01:36:11,901 --> 01:36:12,734
to the left and what they wanted to find
was you flatten out the state so that 

1756
01:36:15,831 --> 01:36:19,670
everyone has equal opportunity and the 
differences between people disappear.

1757
01:36:19,790 --> 01:36:20,623
That is not what happened.
The opposite happened that wasn't wrong 

1758
01:36:24,890 --> 01:36:27,530
and no one was happy about it and no 
one's happy about it.

1759
01:36:27,531 --> 01:36:31,460
Now you can actually tell when you've 
discovered something in a social science

1760
01:36:32,030 --> 01:36:37,030
because you're not happy about it,
but

1761
01:36:42,730 --> 01:36:43,563
if you take,
let's say there's a big difference 

1762
01:36:44,951 --> 01:36:47,440
between men and women in terms of trait,
agreeableness,

1763
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:50,500
compassion and politeness.
On average,

1764
01:36:50,501 --> 01:36:54,820
women are more agreeable than men and 
the difference is approximately this.

1765
01:36:54,821 --> 01:36:58,060
If you take random pairs of men and 
women out of the population,

1766
01:36:58,090 --> 01:37:00,730
let's say you had to make a bet on who 
was more agreeable.

1767
01:37:01,090 --> 01:37:04,120
if you bet that it was the woman,
you'd be right 60 percent of the time,

1768
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:07,780
well that's not that much means you'd be
wrong.

1769
01:37:07,781 --> 01:37:10,990
Forty percent of the time.
That's almost 50 percent of the time.

1770
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:14,260
So this is a big difference by social 
science standards,

1771
01:37:14,440 --> 01:37:17,050
but that's the magnitude of the 
difference.

1772
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:18,700
There are some differences that are 
bigger,

1773
01:37:18,701 --> 01:37:22,120
like the difference between men and 
women's interest in people versus things

1774
01:37:22,121 --> 01:37:24,640
is actually bigger than that.
that's the biggest difference we know,

1775
01:37:25,030 --> 01:37:27,700
but it's a big difference.
Let's say the agreeableness difference,

1776
01:37:27,701 --> 01:37:28,534
but still they the shared attributes of 
men and women far outweigh the 

1777
01:37:35,590 --> 01:37:36,423
attributes that differentiate them 
because you could ask are there more 

1778
01:37:40,091 --> 01:37:42,340
differences with any groups or between 
them?

1779
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:45,970
Now the postmodern answer to that is 
between them.

1780
01:37:46,990 --> 01:37:49,840
That's why you need diversity by group,
right?

1781
01:37:49,900 --> 01:37:50,733
That's why you need different races.
That's why you need different 

1782
01:37:52,151 --> 01:37:54,850
ethnicities and sexual preferences and 
all of that.

1783
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:56,820
Well,
that's wrong.

1784
01:37:58,130 --> 01:38:00,710
There's more differences within the 
groups than there is between them.

1785
01:38:00,711 --> 01:38:03,950
You don't get diversity by crossing the 
groups.

1786
01:38:03,951 --> 01:38:07,400
You get diversity by group,
by selecting across individuals.

1787
01:38:07,700 --> 01:38:08,533
In fact,
the idea that there is more differences 

1788
01:38:10,341 --> 01:38:11,174
between groups and there is between 
individuals is actually the fundamental 

1789
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:15,013
racist idea.
It's the fundamental racist idea which 

1790
01:38:17,751 --> 01:38:18,351
is,
well,

1791
01:38:18,351 --> 01:38:19,184
let's say you're asian oriental to use 
the old word to discriminate the one 

1792
01:38:25,341 --> 01:38:30,230
type of asian say from the other.
You're so different from me that there's

1793
01:38:30,231 --> 01:38:31,064
no overlap between our groups and you're
also so different and there's so little 

1794
01:38:35,031 --> 01:38:39,140
difference within your group that now 
that I know that you're not me,

1795
01:38:39,141 --> 01:38:41,480
you're not one of mine.
I actually know what you're like,

1796
01:38:42,890 --> 01:38:45,740
no,
technically that's incorrect.

1797
01:38:45,770 --> 01:38:48,380
That's wrong.
That isn't how you get diversity.

1798
01:38:52,930 --> 01:38:53,763
Now,
diversity is actually necessary because 

1799
01:38:55,001 --> 01:38:55,834
people differ in intelligence and a 
different temperament and the different 

1800
01:38:57,881 --> 01:38:58,714
skills and so you actually need 
diversity because otherwise you can't 

1801
01:39:01,091 --> 01:39:02,920
take advantage of all those differences,

1802
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:05,583
so you need diversity,
but you need genuine diversity and like 

1803
01:39:09,850 --> 01:39:10,683
what would genuine diversity mean?
If you're trying to put together a work 

1804
01:39:12,881 --> 01:39:14,110
team,
you want enough,

1805
01:39:14,170 --> 01:39:15,003
you want people have sufficient 
diversity so that they more or less so 

1806
01:39:18,521 --> 01:39:19,354
that you gathered together the 
appropriate talent to produce the 

1807
01:39:23,051 --> 01:39:25,900
implement that's necessary to work 
properly in the world.

1808
01:39:25,930 --> 01:39:29,950
That's a competence marker because 
otherwise your business is going to fail

1809
01:39:30,310 --> 01:39:34,690
and so the proper diversity with regards
to employment is the diversity that

1810
01:39:36,190 --> 01:39:39,280
meets the requirements of the business 
essentially.

1811
01:39:40,210 --> 01:39:45,210
obviously that's why you try to hire 
people carefully and not randomly.

1812
01:39:45,851 --> 01:39:46,684
Let's say

1813
01:39:49,710 --> 01:39:52,620
third error,
first errors.

1814
01:39:52,621 --> 01:39:55,870
There's only a finite number of valid 
interpretation.

1815
01:39:55,871 --> 01:39:56,704
Second error is that
there are real differences between 

1816
01:40:00,211 --> 01:40:01,044
groups of people,
but there's more difference within the 

1817
01:40:02,101 --> 01:40:03,120
groups.
Then between them.

1818
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:08,190
Third difference is social status and 
payment.

1819
01:40:08,370 --> 01:40:09,203
Especially in a free democratic 
capitalist society is based more on 

1820
01:40:12,391 --> 01:40:15,810
competence than on
power.

1821
01:40:16,140 --> 01:40:16,973
In fact,
we would say that when a person in a 

1822
01:40:19,801 --> 01:40:24,801
hierarchy starts to act like their 
position entitles them to power,

1823
01:40:25,590 --> 01:40:26,423
then that hierarchy has become corrupt.
Harvey weinstein is a good example of 

1824
01:40:30,361 --> 01:40:32,130
that.
I'm serious.

1825
01:40:32,131 --> 01:40:35,190
It's like he acts,
acted like a tyrant.

1826
01:40:35,191 --> 01:40:37,860
What happened to him?
It's not good.

1827
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:41,640
Not good for him.
What he did was not good,

1828
01:40:42,180 --> 01:40:44,310
but it's an indication.
It's revealed.

1829
01:40:44,311 --> 01:40:48,930
It's an indication that that misuse,
so he's competent,

1830
01:40:48,990 --> 01:40:52,860
fine.
He gets to have position because we need

1831
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:53,733
people who are competent,
but that doesn't mean you get to turn 

1832
01:40:55,340 --> 01:40:56,290
into a tyrant.

1833
01:40:56,440 --> 01:40:57,273
If you turn it into a tyrant,
then that overshadows your competence 

1834
01:41:00,070 --> 01:41:00,903
and you go as the definition of a 
functioning state and our state 

1835
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:07,690
essentially functions.
It's not perfect.

1836
01:41:07,780 --> 01:41:11,710
That's for sure,
but compared to what?

1837
01:41:12,670 --> 01:41:15,820
That's the issue compared to your 
hypothetical marxist utopia.

1838
01:41:16,210 --> 01:41:17,043
Well,
compared to your hypothetical marxist 

1839
01:41:18,310 --> 01:41:21,430
utopia,
I mean we're living in auschwitz,

1840
01:41:21,670 --> 01:41:22,503
but you're what?
Your actual marxist utopia is 

1841
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:27,393
indistinguishable from auschwitz,
so we're not listening to that 

1842
01:41:30,611 --> 01:41:31,444
comparison.
We're going to take a look at what we 

1843
01:41:32,681 --> 01:41:33,514
have and we're going to compare it to 
other places that actually existed in 

1844
01:41:37,061 --> 01:41:40,630
time and geographically and by those 
criteria.

1845
01:41:40,660 --> 01:41:43,030
It's like,
is there another time you'd rather live?

1846
01:41:44,850 --> 01:41:48,090
there's another place you'd rather live.
I mean the real place and real time.

1847
01:41:48,290 --> 01:41:50,370
I mean you want to live back in 18,
95.

1848
01:41:50,371 --> 01:41:51,204
Even in the western world where the 
average person lived on less than a 

1849
01:41:53,281 --> 01:41:54,930
dollar a day.
In today's money,

1850
01:41:56,010 --> 01:41:59,910
you want to live like those coal miners 
like the answer to.

1851
01:42:00,010 --> 01:42:01,860
That's no.
If you have any sense,

1852
01:42:01,861 --> 01:42:02,694
you should have some gratitude.
That's another problem with the 

1853
01:42:04,981 --> 01:42:08,340
postmodern neo marxists like zero,
zero,

1854
01:42:08,370 --> 01:42:11,250
zero gratitude.
It's all,

1855
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:13,290
oh my god,
I'm more pressed.

1856
01:42:15,150 --> 01:42:15,983
Of course you're oppressed,
but you're not oppressed by the 

1857
01:42:18,091 --> 01:42:19,800
patriarchy for god's sake,

1858
01:42:23,260 --> 01:42:25,930
so you have status in the hierarchy.
You might say,

1859
01:42:25,931 --> 01:42:27,970
well,
that's like a reward to your.

1860
01:42:28,130 --> 01:42:30,280
You're a high status person.
It's a reward.

1861
01:42:30,281 --> 01:42:34,210
The reward should be shared equally.
It's like a badge of merit that you get.

1862
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:38,530
It's a privilege.
It's not the reason that in a capitalist

1863
01:42:38,531 --> 01:42:39,364
society,
filthy selfish capitalists put you in a 

1864
01:42:42,311 --> 01:42:46,000
position so they can extract maximum 
productivity from you,

1865
01:42:46,990 --> 01:42:49,150
and that's exactly why you're there.
You get paid,

1866
01:42:49,151 --> 01:42:50,770
you get paid,
so you keep working.

1867
01:42:50,771 --> 01:42:51,604
Why do we want you to work?
BecAuse your work is actually valuable 

1868
01:42:54,161 --> 01:42:57,310
to us and so we're going to pay you so 
you don't quit.

1869
01:42:57,550 --> 01:42:59,650
It's not a reward because you're a good 
guy.

1870
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:02,650
it's not a privilege.
That's not what It is.

1871
01:43:02,651 --> 01:43:05,080
You don't hand those things out like 
merit badges.

1872
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:06,153
That's not how it works.
The society is setup on selfish 

1873
01:43:08,381 --> 01:43:09,214
principles.
We pay people who are competent so they 

1874
01:43:11,111 --> 01:43:14,320
won't stop striving because we want what
they can produce.

1875
01:43:15,070 --> 01:43:18,310
So you don't just distribute that like 
like it's a gift.

1876
01:43:18,311 --> 01:43:20,710
It's not a gift.
It's not a gift at all.

1877
01:43:20,740 --> 01:43:22,540
So that's another place where they're 
wrong.

1878
01:43:23,380 --> 01:43:24,213
Social status and payment is the 
consequence of the selfish desire of 

1879
01:43:27,881 --> 01:43:31,510
individuals and the group to extract 
resources of intellect,

1880
01:43:31,511 --> 01:43:32,344
creativity,
and industriousness from those who 

1881
01:43:34,601 --> 01:43:37,630
possess them in excess.
Now,

1882
01:43:37,631 --> 01:43:39,790
of course,
it's not 100 percent like that.

1883
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:42,070
There's the incompetent people who rise 
to the top,

1884
01:43:42,130 --> 01:43:42,963
you can fool people and you can 
manipulate them and you can act like a 

1885
01:43:45,131 --> 01:43:49,030
tyrant and you know,
we might say maybe the system is like 30

1886
01:43:49,031 --> 01:43:51,440
percent warped,
something like that.

1887
01:43:51,470 --> 01:43:52,303
It's not much more than that because we 
can account for people's success across 

1888
01:43:55,101 --> 01:43:57,980
life by looking at their individual 
differences,

1889
01:43:57,981 --> 01:43:58,980
intelligence,
con,

1890
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:01,490
conscientiousness,
emotional stability,

1891
01:44:01,610 --> 01:44:02,443
creativity.
We can do a pretty good job of 

1892
01:44:04,221 --> 01:44:07,580
predicting their trajectory.
So there's error,

1893
01:44:07,640 --> 01:44:08,870
some of its health,
right,

1894
01:44:08,871 --> 01:44:12,320
because sometimes you've got what you 
need but you get cut off at the knees or

1895
01:44:12,321 --> 01:44:15,660
your family members do or you know,
some tragic thing befalls you.

1896
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:17,233
There's a randomness in the system that 
accounts for a fair bit of it and then 

1897
01:44:20,091 --> 01:44:23,090
there's a certain amount of corruption.
Fair enough.

1898
01:44:25,010 --> 01:44:27,200
But not so much that the lights go off.

1899
01:44:29,150 --> 01:44:33,140
Okay.
What time is it?

1900
01:44:36,290 --> 01:44:37,123
Eight.
15.

1901
01:44:37,210 --> 01:44:41,000
And I started when.
Sorry,

1902
01:44:41,001 --> 01:44:44,120
it's been
6:30.

1903
01:44:44,510 --> 01:44:45,530
I should stop them.

1904
01:44:51,730 --> 01:44:56,730
Thank you.

1905
01:45:00,970 --> 01:45:04,020
I'm going to go for five more minutes 
and then I'll wrap this up.

1906
01:45:04,021 --> 01:45:07,090
I want to talk about intersectionality 
and,

1907
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:12,500
and white privilege a bit.
So.

1908
01:45:16,300 --> 01:45:17,680
So I first said,
well,

1909
01:45:17,710 --> 01:45:20,860
we analyzed marxism,
we analyzed postmodernism.

1910
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:23,473
I suggested that postmodernism was a way
for the marxist to keep going under a 

1911
01:45:26,871 --> 01:45:27,704
new guys.
I suggested that marxism was 

1912
01:45:29,601 --> 01:45:33,860
fundamentally based on hatred rather 
than sympathy and an empathy.

1913
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:38,240
I suggested that the corpses were the 
the evidence for that.

1914
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:42,290
I told you why I think postmodernism is 
fundamentally wrong.

1915
01:45:43,010 --> 01:45:43,843
Oh,

1916
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:48,170
now I want to talk to you a little bit 
about white privilege.

1917
01:45:50,610 --> 01:45:51,443
So

1918
01:45:52,420 --> 01:45:55,180
the first thing that I,
and I haven't got this quite figured out

1919
01:45:55,181 --> 01:45:56,014
yet,
I can't quite figure out why the 

1920
01:45:58,400 --> 01:46:00,750
postmodernists made the canonical 
distinctions.

1921
01:46:00,751 --> 01:46:03,630
They've made race,
ethnicity,

1922
01:46:03,930 --> 01:46:06,930
sexual proclivity,
sexual,

1923
01:46:06,990 --> 01:46:07,823
gender identity.
Let's say those are four dimensions 

1924
01:46:10,611 --> 01:46:11,444
along which people vary,
but there's a very large number of 

1925
01:46:13,701 --> 01:46:15,770
dimensions along which people vary,
right?

1926
01:46:15,771 --> 01:46:19,440
In fact,
given that there's an infinite number of

1927
01:46:19,441 --> 01:46:20,274
ways of interpreting the world,
you could immediately pointed out if 

1928
01:46:22,721 --> 01:46:25,780
there's an infinite number of dimensions
along which people vary.

1929
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:26,913
And so then the postmodern question is 
why would you privilege some of those 

1930
01:46:29,261 --> 01:46:31,540
dimensions over the other?
And I would say,

1931
01:46:31,541 --> 01:46:32,374
well,
because it sustains your bloody marxist 

1932
01:46:33,671 --> 01:46:34,840
interpretation.
That's why.

1933
01:46:34,841 --> 01:46:37,330
But you're not going to say that because
it marginalizes,

1934
01:46:37,540 --> 01:46:38,373
right?
You've marginalized that so you can 

1935
01:46:39,461 --> 01:46:40,294
ignore it.
So that's one of the fun things about 

1936
01:46:42,710 --> 01:46:43,543
organism.
You can.

1937
01:46:43,880 --> 01:46:48,290
You can.
I have a very vulgar image in my mind,

1938
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:53,280
but
I won't share that with you,

1939
01:46:53,281 --> 01:46:56,850
but you can infer it.
Here's some ways people differ.

1940
01:46:56,860 --> 01:46:58,110
Intelligence,
temperament,

1941
01:46:58,111 --> 01:47:00,300
geography,
historical time.

1942
01:47:00,301 --> 01:47:03,060
You live now in 100 years ago.
Attractiveness.

1943
01:47:03,061 --> 01:47:04,710
That's a big.
That's a big one.

1944
01:47:05,220 --> 01:47:07,290
That's a big one.
Would you imagine?

1945
01:47:07,291 --> 01:47:08,220
You could.

1946
01:47:09,430 --> 01:47:10,220
You won't.

1947
01:47:10,220 --> 01:47:14,300
We won't go there either.
Youth eat it's advantageous to be young.

1948
01:47:14,301 --> 01:47:16,550
You've got potential.
It's advantageous to be old.

1949
01:47:16,551 --> 01:47:17,960
You've got wealth.
Health,

1950
01:47:17,990 --> 01:47:21,470
that's a good one.
Sex women have advantages.

1951
01:47:21,471 --> 01:47:24,110
Men have advantages.
Maybe one has more than the other.

1952
01:47:24,111 --> 01:47:24,944
It's not self evident.
Women live about eight years longer 

1953
01:47:26,780 --> 01:47:28,100
there.
Multiorgasmic,

1954
01:47:33,910 --> 01:47:35,120
athleticism,
well,

1955
01:47:35,121 --> 01:47:36,610
family structure,
friendship,

1956
01:47:36,640 --> 01:47:37,473
education.

1957
01:47:38,820 --> 01:47:41,910
Well then there's the classic,
you know,

1958
01:47:41,911 --> 01:47:43,170
postmodern once,
race,

1959
01:47:43,171 --> 01:47:44,160
ethnicity,
et cetera.

1960
01:47:45,390 --> 01:47:48,420
Why not those other dimensions of 
variation.

1961
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:51,120
There's no evidence that they're less 
important.

1962
01:47:51,121 --> 01:47:51,954
In fact,
there's quite a bit of evidence that 

1963
01:47:52,621 --> 01:47:55,560
they're are more important.
so like why not consider them?

1964
01:47:55,770 --> 01:47:56,603
Then you get intersectionality.
This is one of the things that's really 

1965
01:47:58,591 --> 01:47:59,424
comical,
I think because the postmodernists 

1966
01:48:01,140 --> 01:48:03,390
identity politics types actually 
realized this.

1967
01:48:03,391 --> 01:48:04,320
They thought,
well,

1968
01:48:04,321 --> 01:48:05,580
okay,
race and gender.

1969
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:08,610
Fair enough.
What if you're.

1970
01:48:08,670 --> 01:48:10,580
What if you're a black woman?
Well,

1971
01:48:10,581 --> 01:48:11,414
that's a problem because,
well now you've got two dimensions of 

1972
01:48:15,031 --> 01:48:15,864
differentiation.
What the hell are we going to do about 

1973
01:48:16,951 --> 01:48:19,920
that and what if you're,
what if you're gay and black and female?

1974
01:48:20,940 --> 01:48:23,850
Well then what if you're not very bright
and gay and black and female,

1975
01:48:24,180 --> 01:48:27,900
and then what if you're ugly and not 
very bright and gay and black and female

1976
01:48:27,901 --> 01:48:30,090
and like you can keep playing that game.

1977
01:48:30,630 --> 01:48:31,463
You can keep playing that game and the 
infinite number of ways because there's 

1978
01:48:33,871 --> 01:48:36,120
an infinite number of ways to categorize
things.

1979
01:48:36,121 --> 01:48:37,950
As The postmodernist sorority pointed 
out,

1980
01:48:37,980 --> 01:48:41,100
and so the intersectionality theorists 
came along to plug the hole,

1981
01:48:41,101 --> 01:48:41,934
but they don't know where they're going.
They don't understand that the logical 

1982
01:48:44,821 --> 01:48:45,654
conclusion of intersectionality is 
individuality because there's so many 

1983
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:53,160
different ways of categorizing people's 
advantages and disadvantages.

1984
01:48:53,460 --> 01:48:55,770
If you take that all the way out to the 
end,

1985
01:48:55,771 --> 01:48:56,251
you say,
well,

1986
01:48:56,251 --> 01:48:58,020
the individuals,
the ultimate minority,

1987
01:48:58,320 --> 01:48:59,153
and that's exactly right,
and that's exactly what the west 

1988
01:49:00,511 --> 01:49:02,670
discovered and you know the intersection
list,

1989
01:49:02,671 --> 01:49:05,040
so get there if they don't kill everyone
first,

1990
01:49:08,340 --> 01:49:10,350
so onto white privilege.

1991
01:49:14,370 --> 01:49:18,630
So it's really interesting to find out 
where these ideas come from because it's

1992
01:49:18,631 --> 01:49:22,320
usually the scholarship is so awful,
you just cannot possibly believe it.

1993
01:49:22,321 --> 01:49:23,154
It's just absolutely.
It wouldn't end at the university of 

1994
01:49:26,311 --> 01:49:27,144
toronto in the psychology department,
the original paper on white privilege 

1995
01:49:30,930 --> 01:49:31,763
wouldn't have received a passing grade 
for the hypothesis part of a 

1996
01:49:35,970 --> 01:49:39,210
undergraduate honors thesis.
We're noT even close.

1997
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:41,820
There's no methodology at all.
The person who wrote it,

1998
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:45,150
it was called white privilege and male 
privilege,

1999
01:49:45,630 --> 01:49:46,463
a personal account of coming to see 
correspondences through work in women's 

2000
01:49:50,921 --> 01:49:52,660
studies.
Well,

2001
01:49:52,661 --> 01:49:54,190
first of all,
personal account.

2002
01:49:54,191 --> 01:49:55,001
It's like,
sorry.

2003
01:49:55,001 --> 01:49:55,834
No.

2004
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:01,333
So she,
she listed a bunch of ways that she 

2005
01:50:03,201 --> 01:50:04,034
thought she says these are personal 
personal examples of her unearned 

2006
01:50:06,891 --> 01:50:07,724
privilege or unearned privilege that she
saw as she experienced in the 19 

2007
01:50:10,941 --> 01:50:11,900
seventies,
19 eighties.

2008
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:12,913
So this part of the way,
so this idea is the opinion of one 

2009
01:50:15,081 --> 01:50:15,914
person who wrote one paper that has 
absolutely no empirical backing 

2010
01:50:19,461 --> 01:50:20,294
whatsoever,
which is a set of hypotheses which had 

2011
01:50:22,791 --> 01:50:25,760
never been subject to any statistical 
analysis.

2012
01:50:25,850 --> 01:50:27,830
Like if I asked you a bunch of 
questions,

2013
01:50:27,860 --> 01:50:30,950
it's not obvious how many questions I'm 
asking you because I could say,

2014
01:50:31,130 --> 01:50:33,290
how tall are you?
Or I could say,

2015
01:50:33,291 --> 01:50:36,170
if you're laying on the ground,
how extended would you be?

2016
01:50:36,270 --> 01:50:38,090
It's like that two questions.
It's like,

2017
01:50:38,091 --> 01:50:39,170
no,
it's one question.

2018
01:50:39,650 --> 01:50:43,610
It's just asked two ways and the way you
figure out if you ask someone a bunch of

2019
01:50:43,611 --> 01:50:45,890
questions,
how many questions you're asking them is

2020
01:50:45,891 --> 01:50:47,720
by doing something called a factor 
analysis,

2021
01:50:47,721 --> 01:50:52,721
which is kind of an elementary form now 
of social science investigation.

2022
01:50:52,970 --> 01:50:53,803
If you make a questionnaire,
you have to subject it to a factor 

2023
01:50:55,401 --> 01:50:58,190
analysis beCause you've got to find out 
how many questions you're asking because

2024
01:50:58,191 --> 01:51:00,710
you might think it's 60,
but it's probably not.

2025
01:51:00,711 --> 01:51:02,870
It's probably five.
That's the big five,

2026
01:51:02,900 --> 01:51:05,810
by the way anyways.
Who cares about that?

2027
01:51:05,870 --> 01:51:07,940
There's no such thing as methodology.
Anyways,

2028
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:12,380
that's all part of the oppressive white 
male european patriarchy,

2029
01:51:12,530 --> 01:51:13,363
so we can just not bother with that and 
we can pin a few notes about how we 

2030
01:51:16,611 --> 01:51:17,444
think the world is constructed and then 
we can screw up the entire political 

2031
01:51:20,991 --> 01:51:24,500
system two decades later.
Okay,

2032
01:51:24,501 --> 01:51:26,840
so here's your white privilege list.
Some of it,

2033
01:51:26,841 --> 01:51:27,674
there's like 50 things I can if I wish 
arrange to be in the company of people 

2034
01:51:30,801 --> 01:51:32,210
of my race,
most of the time,

2035
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:33,553
if I should need to move,
I can be pretty sure of renting or 

2036
01:51:35,091 --> 01:51:35,924
purchasing housing in an area which I 
can afford and in which I would want to 

2037
01:51:38,481 --> 01:51:39,314
live.

2038
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:41,240
That's actually a wealth thing by the 
way.

2039
01:51:41,450 --> 01:51:42,283
I can be pretty sure that my neighbors 
and such a location will be neutral or 

2040
01:51:44,601 --> 01:51:45,434
pleasant to me.
I can go shopping alone most of the 

2041
01:51:47,211 --> 01:51:48,044
time,
pretty well assured that I will not be 

2042
01:51:48,861 --> 01:51:49,694
followed or harassed.
I can turn on the television or open to 

2043
01:51:51,951 --> 01:51:52,784
the front page of the paper and see 
people of my waist race widely 

2044
01:51:55,911 --> 01:51:56,744
represented.
When I'm talking about our national 

2045
01:51:58,611 --> 01:51:59,444
heritage or about civilization,
I am shown that people of my color made 

2046
01:52:03,171 --> 01:52:06,140
it what it is.
There's 50 of those,

2047
01:52:06,141 --> 01:52:07,190
I think,
something like that.

2048
01:52:07,370 --> 01:52:10,890
Okay.
Is that white privilege?

2049
01:52:10,891 --> 01:52:12,640
Is that majority privilege?

2050
01:52:14,010 --> 01:52:15,360
It's the same tree.
You go to China,

2051
01:52:15,361 --> 01:52:16,530
you're chinese.
Is the same?

2052
01:52:16,531 --> 01:52:17,640
True.
If you're chinese,

2053
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:21,810
does the majority privilege benefits?
Majority privileges.

2054
01:52:21,811 --> 01:52:26,190
Like isn't that just part of living 
within your culture?

2055
01:52:26,430 --> 01:52:27,263
So let's say you live in your culture,
you're privileged as a member of that 

2056
01:52:30,451 --> 01:52:31,284
culture,
while obviously that's what the culture 

2057
01:52:32,941 --> 01:52:35,100
is for.
That's what it's for.

2058
01:52:35,670 --> 01:52:36,503
Why would you bother building the damn 
thing if it didn't accrue benefits to 

2059
01:52:39,061 --> 01:52:39,871
you?
Now you might say,

2060
01:52:39,871 --> 01:52:40,704
well,
one of the consequences that it accrues 

2061
01:52:42,270 --> 01:52:45,000
fewer benefits to those who aren't in 
the culture.

2062
01:52:45,380 --> 01:52:46,213
Yeah,
but you can immediately associate that 

2063
01:52:47,601 --> 01:52:50,150
with race.
You can't just do that.

2064
01:52:50,180 --> 01:52:52,550
Say it's white privileGed does many 
things.

2065
01:52:52,551 --> 01:52:53,384
It could be certainly could be well and 
the intersection of people have already 

2066
01:52:56,301 --> 01:53:00,440
figured out that there's many things 
that could be so like what the hell?

2067
01:53:00,530 --> 01:53:01,610
Seriously.
Well,

2068
01:53:01,611 --> 01:53:02,444
what's going on while we let these 
pseudo disciplines into the university 

2069
01:53:05,241 --> 01:53:06,074
because we're stupid and guilty 
seriously and they have no 

2070
01:53:10,011 --> 01:53:10,844
methodological requirements and plenty 
of power and plenty of time to produce 

2071
01:53:14,660 --> 01:53:15,493
nonsensical research and produce like 
resentful activists and now we're 

2072
01:53:19,341 --> 01:53:20,720
bearing the fruits of that.

2073
01:53:21,620 --> 01:53:24,620
It's not pretty so white privilege.
Well,

2074
01:53:24,621 --> 01:53:25,454
the other thing you might notice is that
to attribute to the individuals of a 

2075
01:53:30,151 --> 01:53:30,984
community,
the attributes of that community on the 

2076
01:53:33,531 --> 01:53:37,040
basis of their racial identity is called
racism.

2077
01:53:37,370 --> 01:53:41,000
That's what racism is.
There's no other way of defining it.

2078
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:42,193
It's attributing to the individual the 
characteristics of the group as if the 

2079
01:53:46,161 --> 01:53:49,730
group was homogenous.
Now the intersection people have already

2080
01:53:49,731 --> 01:53:50,564
decided that's not a fair game because 
there's so many differences between 

2081
01:53:53,361 --> 01:53:54,194
people,
but the postmodernist don't care about 

2082
01:53:55,701 --> 01:53:59,090
logical coherence because they regard 
logical coherence.

2083
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:02,420
Here it comes again as a creation of the
white,

2084
01:54:02,421 --> 01:54:03,254
european male patriarchal structure 
that's designed to oppress the 

2085
01:54:06,201 --> 01:54:08,930
oppressed,
and that's technically the case.

2086
01:54:09,170 --> 01:54:10,760
So logical,
incoherence,

2087
01:54:10,940 --> 01:54:12,290
it doesn't matter,
and you could say,

2088
01:54:12,291 --> 01:54:15,080
well,
if you act out your logically incoherent

2089
01:54:15,081 --> 01:54:15,914
ideas in the world,
you're going to run face first into a 

2090
01:54:17,571 --> 01:54:18,404
brick wall,
and the postmodern answer to that is 

2091
01:54:20,540 --> 01:54:23,930
there's actually no real world.
it's all interpretation.

2092
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:27,560
So there's no,
there's no having that discussion,

2093
01:54:27,710 --> 01:54:28,543
but the postmodernists don't care 
because they don't believe that 

2094
01:54:30,411 --> 01:54:32,960
discussion between people of different 
power groups as possible.

2095
01:54:32,961 --> 01:54:35,540
Anyways.
So here we are.

2096
01:54:36,140 --> 01:54:37,670
Well,
so I made a case tonight,

2097
01:54:38,130 --> 01:54:39,140
you know,
I'll go over it.

2098
01:54:39,170 --> 01:54:40,010
What's the case?

2099
01:54:43,910 --> 01:54:48,050
The postmodernists are wrong.
They're philosophically naive,

2100
01:54:49,390 --> 01:54:50,223
they're right about an infinite number 
of interpretations and wrong about a 

2101
01:54:52,961 --> 01:54:56,920
finite number of viable interpretations 
and that's like that's,

2102
01:54:57,220 --> 01:54:58,053
that's death.
That's the end of postmodernist theory 

2103
01:55:00,100 --> 01:55:02,110
and that's not the only way in which 
they're wrong.

2104
01:55:02,111 --> 01:55:04,510
They're wrong in a bunch of other ways,
but they're more subsidiary.

2105
01:55:04,780 --> 01:55:06,040
The marxists.

2106
01:55:08,520 --> 01:55:11,970
They're not just wrong,
they're wrong and murderous or wrong,

2107
01:55:11,971 --> 01:55:15,540
murderous and genocidal.
Unless you think murderous and genocidal

2108
01:55:15,660 --> 01:55:19,320
doesn't mean wrong and you,
you can think that there's lots of would

2109
01:55:19,321 --> 01:55:23,220
be revolutionaries who would be happy to
have blood running in the street if they

2110
01:55:23,221 --> 01:55:24,054
had their chance for revenge and the 
opportunity to move up the hierarchy of 

2111
01:55:27,331 --> 01:55:28,164
charity so you can.
You don't have to think that murder and 

2112
01:55:30,901 --> 01:55:31,734
genocide is wrong,
especially if the right people are 

2113
01:55:33,451 --> 01:55:34,860
murdered in genocide.
Right?

2114
01:55:34,861 --> 01:55:37,860
That's actually part of the part of the 
whole equation,

2115
01:55:38,130 --> 01:55:38,963
but if you're willing to think that 
murder and genocide on a mass scale 

2116
01:55:41,731 --> 01:55:45,180
across many cultures over decades is 
wrong,

2117
01:55:45,240 --> 01:55:46,073
then marxism is wrong and the 
postmodernist don't get to just come 

2118
01:55:50,521 --> 01:55:51,354
along and a dark marxism as a matter of 
sleight of hand because there are 

2119
01:55:55,201 --> 01:55:56,034
marches.
Theory didn't work out and they figured 

2120
01:55:56,971 --> 01:55:57,804
out a rationalization.
They don't get to get away with that 

2121
01:56:00,030 --> 01:56:02,820
because it's too dangerous.
It's too dangerous to the rest of us

2122
01:56:05,510 --> 01:56:06,343
and we don't,
and it isn't necessary for us who are 

2123
01:56:11,241 --> 01:56:12,074
trying with the small part of our hearts
that might be oriented towards the good 

2124
01:56:16,310 --> 01:56:17,143
to allow people who are manipulating us 
with historical ignorance and 

2125
01:56:20,331 --> 01:56:21,164
philosophical sleight of hand to render 
so god damn guilty about what our 

2126
01:56:25,011 --> 01:56:29,330
ancestors may or may not have done so 
that we allow our shame and our guilt to

2127
01:56:29,331 --> 01:56:30,164
be,
to be used as tools to manipulate us 

2128
01:56:33,171 --> 01:56:35,780
into accepting a future that we do not 
want to have.

2129
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:39,073
Then.
That's.

2130
01:56:40,610 --> 01:56:45,610
Thank you.

2131
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:09,560
Okay,
so we're just gonna do the uh,

2132
01:57:09,620 --> 01:57:11,030
we're gonna.
Move on onto the q and a now.

2133
01:57:11,031 --> 01:57:14,600
but before we do the venue wants to do a
little announcement.

2134
01:57:20,180 --> 01:57:21,220
Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen,

2135
01:57:21,221 --> 01:57:22,360
I'm sorry.
My name's cameron mcneil.

2136
01:57:22,370 --> 01:57:24,610
I'm the managing director here at the 
chan center.

2137
01:57:25,580 --> 01:57:26,413
As you are all leaving tonight,
please be where something has come to 

2138
01:57:29,271 --> 01:57:31,280
light tonight.
Outside the building,

2139
01:57:31,281 --> 01:57:35,690
there is an individual impersonating a 
ubc security guard.

2140
01:57:36,090 --> 01:57:39,380
It is not in the building.
It was in the rose garden.

2141
01:57:39,410 --> 01:57:41,210
There was no damage done.
Nobody was hurt,

2142
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:44,630
but there is an impersonator out there,
so just please be aware of that.

2143
01:57:45,230 --> 01:57:46,063
Thank you very much.

2144
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:50,850
So for those of you in the first two 
rows,

2145
01:57:50,851 --> 01:57:53,400
you can either line up here or at the 
mic over there and,

2146
01:57:53,401 --> 01:57:55,500
uh,
ask your questions

2147
01:58:06,420 --> 01:58:09,150
and also try to keep it short because we
don't have that much time.

2148
01:58:21,590 --> 01:58:22,910
Hello,
Jordan B.

2149
01:58:22,910 --> 01:58:23,960
Peterson.
I'm a huge fan.

2150
01:58:24,140 --> 01:58:24,973
I'm in your lectures.
Use the term postmodernism 

2151
01:58:27,531 --> 01:58:31,760
interchangeably with cultural marxism,
nihilism and moral relativism.

2152
01:58:32,210 --> 01:58:33,043
I wonder if you've considered or heard 
alternative beliefs that the term 

2153
01:58:35,001 --> 01:58:38,930
postmodernism is not necessary,
is necessarily always congruent on a one

2154
01:58:38,931 --> 01:58:39,764
to one scale of these other terms.
And some limited circumstances is 

2155
01:58:43,331 --> 01:58:44,164
positive.
Specifically the idea that when you use 

2156
01:58:46,271 --> 01:58:47,104
the term postmodernism to vilify as by 
some others referred to as pseudo 

2157
01:58:50,321 --> 01:58:51,154
modernism,
whereas as some would call what you 

2158
01:58:52,601 --> 01:58:55,720
endorsed to not be modernism,
but in fact metta modernism,

2159
01:58:55,960 --> 01:58:59,620
post millennialism or post 
postmodernism,

2160
01:58:59,621 --> 01:59:03,700
which unfortunately has a terrible name.
And then I have a brief,

2161
01:59:03,850 --> 01:59:04,683
uh,
definitions of those words if you need 

2162
01:59:06,791 --> 01:59:07,624
me to.

2163
01:59:08,270 --> 01:59:10,790
No,
as I said tonight,

2164
01:59:11,240 --> 01:59:15,200
you have to give the devil his due and 
so we'll do that.

2165
01:59:15,201 --> 01:59:16,034
So yes,
there is a very large number of ways of 

2166
01:59:17,781 --> 01:59:20,900
interpreting the world.
There's no doubt about that.

2167
01:59:22,580 --> 01:59:27,050
Yes.
People use biased interpretive lenses to

2168
01:59:28,190 --> 01:59:30,800
as means of interpreting the world to 
put their own

2169
01:59:33,330 --> 01:59:38,040
priorities forward without necessarily 
knowing that they're doing so and that,

2170
01:59:38,041 --> 01:59:38,874
that can corrupt them and society.
The psychoanalysts figured that out way 

2171
01:59:43,981 --> 01:59:46,380
before the postmodernist so they don't 
get any credit for that,

2172
01:59:46,440 --> 01:59:48,330
like really not.

2173
01:59:49,220 --> 01:59:50,370
Um,

2174
01:59:51,540 --> 01:59:53,430
so it's useful to keep those things in 
mind.

2175
01:59:54,790 --> 01:59:58,200
It's when they're put,
but when they're put forward is absolute

2176
01:59:58,290 --> 02:00:00,660
truth that disturbs me.
It's like,

2177
02:00:00,661 --> 02:00:02,670
yes,
people are probably racist.

2178
02:00:02,671 --> 02:00:03,504
They miGht even be implicitly racist,
although we don't know what that means 

2179
02:00:06,061 --> 02:00:06,894
and we don't know how it's related to 
their explicit behavior and we can't 

2180
02:00:09,151 --> 02:00:14,151
separate from ingroup preference or 
necessarily from reaction to novelty.

2181
02:00:14,340 --> 02:00:15,900
So it's a tricky business,
you know,

2182
02:00:16,380 --> 02:00:17,213
and we don't know how to separate 
stereotypical racial perceptions from 

2183
02:00:23,730 --> 02:00:24,563
perceptual heuristics.
We don't know how to do that because 

2184
02:00:26,521 --> 02:00:27,354
you're always oversimplifying the world 
because you're not smart enough to live 

2185
02:00:29,131 --> 02:00:31,290
in the world as it is.
You have to oversimplify it.

2186
02:00:31,770 --> 02:00:32,603
So yes,
there are times with postmodernism is 

2187
02:00:35,101 --> 02:00:35,934
useful.
Are used it quite usefully tonight to 

2188
02:00:37,681 --> 02:00:39,690
deconstruct postmodernism.
In fact,

2189
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:44,730
so but but way it's when it's turned 
into an absolute,

2190
02:00:44,731 --> 02:00:48,900
especially a moral absolute that it and 
winded allies itself with marxism,

2191
02:00:48,901 --> 02:00:49,920
it's like,
sorry guys.

2192
02:00:49,921 --> 02:00:51,560
No,
you don't like grand narratives.

2193
02:00:51,580 --> 02:00:53,750
You don't get to go there.
while that's where you.

2194
02:00:53,850 --> 02:00:57,180
that isn't where you went,
that's where you came from.

2195
02:00:57,181 --> 02:00:59,160
You've never,
you've never left there.

2196
02:00:59,460 --> 02:01:03,330
So
that's,

2197
02:01:03,810 --> 02:01:06,120
that's basically what I have to say 
about that.

2198
02:01:06,190 --> 02:01:07,023
Thanks.

2199
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:08,580
Hello,
Dr. Peterson.

2200
02:01:08,581 --> 02:01:12,270
Thank you very much.
Now my question is regarding adhd,

2201
02:01:12,780 --> 02:01:15,240
which is something I haven't heard you 
speak a whole lot about,

2202
02:01:15,241 --> 02:01:16,074
maybe a little bit now.
It seems to me that we are at least 

2203
02:01:20,190 --> 02:01:21,023
maybe just me,
do not quite understand adhd to what 

2204
02:01:24,421 --> 02:01:28,170
could be at full capacity maybe,
and because there's many,

2205
02:01:28,200 --> 02:01:31,890
many voices sayinG that it's an 
overdiagnosed overblown,

2206
02:01:31,891 --> 02:01:32,724
small mental variants that's prevalent 
in boys or it's just young boys being 

2207
02:01:36,571 --> 02:01:37,404
young boys and then there are some that 
would fight and advocate for a very 

2208
02:01:42,501 --> 02:01:47,360
different treatment in the academic 
world and I was wondering what you,

2209
02:01:47,390 --> 02:01:52,390
what your thoughts are on adhd itself
and on the,

2210
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:54,973
whether you think it's overdiagnosed and
maybe advice for me as someone who has 

2211
02:01:58,941 --> 02:01:59,774
been diagnosed with adhd on how to 
overcome it without maybe becoming 

2212
02:02:03,891 --> 02:02:07,010
completely reliant on prescribed 
medication.

2213
02:02:08,530 --> 02:02:10,660
Okay,
so first of all,

2214
02:02:10,750 --> 02:02:15,280
it's definitely overdiagnosed.
Second,

2215
02:02:16,250 --> 02:02:20,770
it's very unreliable.
Psychiatric diagnosis.

2216
02:02:20,890 --> 02:02:21,723
Many psychiatric diagnosis are 
unreliable and that's because 

2217
02:02:24,341 --> 02:02:27,820
psychiatric diagnosis aren't precisely 
scientific categories.

2218
02:02:27,821 --> 02:02:29,110
They're weird hybrids,
right?

2219
02:02:29,111 --> 02:02:31,330
First of all,
psychiatrists aren't scientists.

2220
02:02:31,331 --> 02:02:32,164
They're engineers.
Engineers are trying to do something 

2221
02:02:34,181 --> 02:02:35,014
rather than to describe the objective 
world and psychiatrists are trying to 

2222
02:02:37,391 --> 02:02:39,550
make people healthy.
Whatever that means.

2223
02:02:39,640 --> 02:02:42,670
It's actually partly ethical.
It's very complicated.

2224
02:02:47,580 --> 02:02:51,000
We don't know how to distinguish it from
temperamental variation,

2225
02:02:51,450 --> 02:02:52,283
so for example,
if you're high in openness and high in 

2226
02:02:53,551 --> 02:02:56,220
extroversion and low in 
conscientiousness,

2227
02:02:58,090 --> 02:03:00,010
low in agreeableness,
conscientiousness,

2228
02:03:00,011 --> 02:03:00,844
and and high in neuroticism,
you're likely to manifest symptoms of 

2229
02:03:04,751 --> 02:03:07,960
adhd.
It's because your exploratory,

2230
02:03:08,170 --> 02:03:10,480
you don't like to sit down.
You're full of ideas.

2231
02:03:10,481 --> 02:03:11,314
Your attention scatters across a wide 
variety of topics and you're not very 

2232
02:03:14,561 --> 02:03:15,394
stable.
Temperamental variation is also much 

2233
02:03:17,231 --> 02:03:18,790
more common among boys.

2234
02:03:21,470 --> 02:03:26,470
Panksepp showed same guy with rats that 
if you deprive young routes of rough and

2235
02:03:27,711 --> 02:03:28,544
tumble play,
which is what the young boys are 

2236
02:03:30,561 --> 02:03:31,394
deprived of in school,
let's say that they get hyperactive and 

2237
02:03:37,490 --> 02:03:38,323
then their prefrontal cortex is don't 
develop very well because they're not 

2238
02:03:40,251 --> 02:03:41,084
having the right kind of experienCes and
that you can treat that quite 

2239
02:03:42,921 --> 02:03:46,520
effectively with psychomotor stimulants 
like ritalin.

2240
02:03:47,690 --> 02:03:48,523
so that's kind of an interesting bit of 
scientific information that no one pays 

2241
02:03:51,501 --> 02:03:52,334
any attention to.
There is also absolutely no evidence 

2242
02:03:55,161 --> 02:03:55,994
whatsoever.
That longterm use of psychomotor 

2243
02:03:57,351 --> 02:04:00,350
stimulants produces increases in 
cognitive gain,

2244
02:04:00,410 --> 02:04:02,990
zero,
and there's plenty of evidence that it's

2245
02:04:02,991 --> 02:04:05,180
harmful.
So

2246
02:04:08,270 --> 02:04:10,220
then the second part of that was what 
about.

2247
02:04:12,550 --> 02:04:13,383
Yeah,

2248
02:04:13,590 --> 02:04:18,590
adjustments for in the academic world,
say that disability adjustments.

2249
02:04:19,081 --> 02:04:23,150
It's like that's such a rat's nest that 
I don't want to even discuss it.

2250
02:04:23,490 --> 02:04:27,120
I mean it it,
I'll discuss it for like 15 seconds.

2251
02:04:28,900 --> 02:04:32,710
There is a never endinG multiplication 
of disability.

2252
02:04:33,190 --> 02:04:34,023
That's what's happening right now.
The disability offices in the 

2253
02:04:36,251 --> 02:04:40,920
universities are like,
I know some people have it rough,

2254
02:04:40,940 --> 02:04:42,690
like believe me,
I know that I,

2255
02:04:43,400 --> 02:04:44,233
I,
I seriously know that I've dealt with 

2256
02:04:46,230 --> 02:04:48,420
extraordinarily damaged people in my 
life.

2257
02:04:50,250 --> 02:04:50,730
It,
you,

2258
02:04:50,730 --> 02:04:51,563
you're,
you're bloody hard pressed to find 

2259
02:04:52,631 --> 02:04:53,464
someone who doesn't have a serious 
problem or who doesn't have a serious 

2260
02:04:59,981 --> 02:05:02,740
problem in a close family member.
It's like,

2261
02:05:02,800 --> 02:05:06,400
where do you draw the line with regards 
to disability where you can't,

2262
02:05:07,480 --> 02:05:11,560
you can't.
They multiply just like lgbt identities.

2263
02:05:11,561 --> 02:05:13,120
Multiply.
Just knows.

2264
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:14,033
She really technically just like that.
Just like intersectionality cateGories 

2265
02:05:18,071 --> 02:05:19,880
of oppression multiply.
It's,

2266
02:05:19,881 --> 02:05:20,714
it's,
it's inevitable the way that you deal 

2267
02:05:23,291 --> 02:05:25,270
with it.
As you have objective standards,

2268
02:05:25,450 --> 02:05:28,510
you apply them to everyone.
Not because that's fair.

2269
02:05:28,720 --> 02:05:29,890
It's not fair.
If you,

2270
02:05:31,030 --> 02:05:34,000
if your criteria for fairness is that 
everyone has the same outcome,

2271
02:05:34,001 --> 02:05:36,520
it's not fair at all.
it's not even close to fair.

2272
02:05:36,940 --> 02:05:39,820
It's just less piratical radical than 
the alternatives.

2273
02:05:40,180 --> 02:05:41,013
Now we don't know that yet because we 
haven't seen the full range of the 

2274
02:05:43,571 --> 02:05:46,240
tyranny of the alternatives manifest 
itself.

2275
02:05:46,390 --> 02:05:49,180
Not in our culture,
but it certainly did in other cultures.

2276
02:05:49,630 --> 02:05:54,160
I think it's a bad idea now.
I don't want to be absolute about that.

2277
02:05:54,190 --> 02:05:59,190
Like
it's tricky,

2278
02:05:59,351 --> 02:06:02,350
you know,
because if you have a disability

2279
02:06:04,080 --> 02:06:04,913
that

2280
02:06:04,930 --> 02:06:05,763
would allow you to do the work in the 
university and in the workplace with a 

2281
02:06:09,821 --> 02:06:10,654
modification,
then perhaps the modification could be 

2282
02:06:13,661 --> 02:06:14,494
made,
but I think that was done a lot better 

2283
02:06:15,701 --> 02:06:18,460
when I was in the hands of the 
professors and not in the hands of these

2284
02:06:18,790 --> 02:06:23,500
crazy bureaucratic structures that have 
risen up around the disability issue.

2285
02:06:23,830 --> 02:06:24,663
Like they're one of the 10 things that 
are going to kill the universities or 

2286
02:06:27,431 --> 02:06:31,840
maybe have already killed them possibly 
because they may their walking corpses.

2287
02:06:31,841 --> 02:06:35,470
As far as I can tell zombies so and that
might be wrong,

2288
02:06:35,471 --> 02:06:40,360
but it's what it looks like to me
versus I want to say thank you so much.

2289
02:06:40,361 --> 02:06:44,050
Those an amazing talk and I was 
wondering if you could elaborate.

2290
02:06:44,051 --> 02:06:44,884
What I noticed a lot,
I go here to ubc is that a lot of 

2291
02:06:46,691 --> 02:06:50,380
students and young people,
they're often desensitized to,

2292
02:06:50,381 --> 02:06:51,214
for example,
the atrocities that communism or 

2293
02:06:52,991 --> 02:06:53,824
ideologies that forced terrorism and 
maybe it's some sort of stockholm 

2294
02:06:57,461 --> 02:07:01,670
syndrome that I'm seeing where it's like
people are just there,

2295
02:07:02,040 --> 02:07:03,670
they're trapped and they can't.

2296
02:07:03,940 --> 02:07:07,570
They feel in a way they can't do 
anything about it and then they start to

2297
02:07:08,110 --> 02:07:09,950
like,
like,

2298
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:10,833
like communism or they start to see more
socialists or adopt socialist policy 

2299
02:07:13,821 --> 02:07:16,840
that in the end we'll get them killed.
We'll get them hurt.

2300
02:07:17,380 --> 02:07:21,490
As long as you kind of elaborate on what
you think can be done about that or even

2301
02:07:21,491 --> 02:07:23,740
if something can be done in that 
respect.

2302
02:07:24,130 --> 02:07:25,840
Well,
I think something can be done.

2303
02:07:25,841 --> 02:07:29,560
I mean I've been trying to educate 
people about the horrors of

2304
02:07:31,540 --> 02:07:35,920
the nazi regime and the soviet in 
particular.

2305
02:07:35,921 --> 02:07:40,921
I've concentrated mostly on those two 
because that's good enough and trying to

2306
02:07:42,550 --> 02:07:46,120
let people know that it was through the 
fault of people,

2307
02:07:46,121 --> 02:07:48,880
much like them,
that those systems are rows and,

2308
02:07:50,530 --> 02:07:51,363
and that there are steps you can take to
limit the probability that you would 

2309
02:07:55,781 --> 02:07:56,614
participate in such a thing and that 
those steps are associated with trying 

2310
02:07:59,831 --> 02:08:00,664
to be truthful in your speech and 
actions because the stability of those 

2311
02:08:04,361 --> 02:08:09,040
systems depends on the willingness of 
individuals to lie and,

2312
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:10,113
and also on your willingness to take 
responsibility for the malevolence in 

2313
02:08:13,901 --> 02:08:17,650
your own heart that manifests itself in 
those social movements.

2314
02:08:19,450 --> 02:08:24,450
And so that when I don't,
when I do my lectures,

2315
02:08:25,451 --> 02:08:27,760
when I do talks like this,
when I put them on youtube,

2316
02:08:27,790 --> 02:08:28,623
what I'm trying to do is exactly that 
because that was the best pathway 

2317
02:08:33,281 --> 02:08:37,540
forward through such things that I could
think up over 20 years of thinking about

2318
02:08:37,541 --> 02:08:38,980
it.
Um,

2319
02:08:39,330 --> 02:08:40,163
you know,
one is so habituated to suffering that 

2320
02:08:48,161 --> 02:08:48,994
they can read the gulag archipelago,
which is actually quite hard to read 

2321
02:08:54,040 --> 02:08:56,770
without having an effect them like your 
psychopathic.

2322
02:08:56,771 --> 02:08:59,500
If that book doesn't affect you,
it should.

2323
02:08:59,740 --> 02:09:00,573
If you read it properly,
it affects you deeply and it's not the 

2324
02:09:03,701 --> 02:09:08,701
only example of that kind of literature.
So the people who are habituated aren't.

2325
02:09:09,640 --> 02:09:10,473
They've just been shown low resolution 
representations of things they don't 

2326
02:09:13,481 --> 02:09:17,890
understand that looked vaguely bad.
You don't know a damn thing about them,

2327
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:19,353
and our education system has done a 
tremendously appalling job of educating 

2328
02:09:24,221 --> 02:09:28,420
young people about the absolute 
catastrophe of radical left isn't now.

2329
02:09:28,420 --> 02:09:32,560
It's not much better with regards to say
the actions of the nazis,

2330
02:09:32,561 --> 02:09:35,620
although I would say on average people 
are more aware of that,

2331
02:09:35,800 --> 02:09:37,660
but they don't.
But it's shallow,

2332
02:09:37,661 --> 02:09:38,494
shallow knowledge.
So you make the knowledge deep and deep 

2333
02:09:42,101 --> 02:09:44,800
knowledge changes people and wakes them 
up.

2334
02:09:44,940 --> 02:09:45,773
You know?
I mean,

2335
02:09:45,970 --> 02:09:46,803
the only reason that I ever got 
convinced that they're that good and 

2336
02:09:48,941 --> 02:09:52,210
evil,
we're real more real than anything else.

2337
02:09:52,450 --> 02:09:54,670
It wasn't because I learned that good 
was real.

2338
02:09:55,870 --> 02:09:57,910
That's hard.
That's hard.

2339
02:09:57,940 --> 02:09:58,773
It's hard to learn that.
You have to find examples of 

2340
02:10:01,061 --> 02:10:02,620
transcendent good.
You know,

2341
02:10:02,680 --> 02:10:04,780
they're rare,
evil.

2342
02:10:05,740 --> 02:10:10,420
All you have to do is look,
read history a bit and read it like it's

2343
02:10:10,421 --> 02:10:15,421
about you and there's no way that you 
can do that without a transformation,

2344
02:10:17,260 --> 02:10:19,140
but people won't do it.
It's like you want.

2345
02:10:19,160 --> 02:10:23,350
Imagine yourself as an auschwitz guard.
That's a rough thing you see because you

2346
02:10:23,351 --> 02:10:24,330
have to figure out.

2347
02:10:25,180 --> 02:10:27,310
See young said,
if you confronted the shadow,

2348
02:10:27,370 --> 02:10:29,860
which is the dark side of people,
the aggressive side,

2349
02:10:29,861 --> 02:10:31,870
that malevolent side,
that it.

2350
02:10:31,960 --> 02:10:32,793
It really reaches all the down to hell 
and dante sort of was trying to put 

2351
02:10:37,761 --> 02:10:39,800
forward the same thing when he wrote the
inferno,

2352
02:10:39,860 --> 02:10:41,300
right?
With the levels of evil,

2353
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:42,193
right?
Because it was a voyage through the 

2354
02:10:42,981 --> 02:10:44,600
levels of evil,
right to the bottom.

2355
02:10:44,601 --> 02:10:47,540
He thought the bottom was betrayal.
it's pretty good.

2356
02:10:47,830 --> 02:10:49,010
The,
the most,

2357
02:10:49,100 --> 02:10:51,340
the,
the center of malevolence is be trail.

2358
02:10:51,470 --> 02:10:53,820
I liked that because to be trained 
someone,

2359
02:10:53,840 --> 02:10:56,630
you have to get them to trust you,
and trust is a moral virtue,

2360
02:10:56,631 --> 02:10:58,490
right?
especially if it's courageous trust,

2361
02:10:58,610 --> 02:10:59,443
because it it,
it puts you in alignment with other 

2362
02:11:00,831 --> 02:11:01,664
people and allows you to move forward 
into life and if you'd be trained that 

2363
02:11:03,771 --> 02:11:05,330
you really,
it's like a knife in the.

2364
02:11:05,640 --> 02:11:07,850
It's like knife in the heart through the
back,

2365
02:11:08,330 --> 02:11:10,520
especially if it's someone who loves,
loves you,

2366
02:11:10,521 --> 02:11:11,354
betrays you,
and especially if they be you for your 

2367
02:11:13,281 --> 02:11:15,680
virtues.
That's a really nice twist.

2368
02:11:16,190 --> 02:11:17,023
So

2369
02:11:18,980 --> 02:11:23,150
I believe because I think that people 
are capable of good,

2370
02:11:23,420 --> 02:11:26,960
that if they know enough about evil that
that will straighten them out.

2371
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:29,960
So,
but who wants that?

2372
02:11:30,280 --> 02:11:31,113
No,
this is one of the things I really like 

2373
02:11:31,941 --> 02:11:32,774
about young.
He's often regarded as a new age 

2374
02:11:34,581 --> 02:11:36,680
thinker.
That's wrong.

2375
02:11:37,460 --> 02:11:40,700
He's no new age thinker.
He knew that the,

2376
02:11:41,150 --> 02:11:41,983
the pathway to enlightenment was barred 
by the necessity of a passage through 

2377
02:11:47,271 --> 02:11:50,270
hell and that no one was going to do 
that.

2378
02:11:50,300 --> 02:11:53,930
That's why there isn't a world full of 
enlightened people,

2379
02:11:53,931 --> 02:11:54,764
you might say.
I think it was just a matter of doing 

2380
02:11:57,171 --> 02:12:02,150
nice things following your bliss,
let's say however you might put it.

2381
02:12:02,990 --> 02:12:07,040
Then why wouldn't everyone walk up the 
stairway to heaven?

2382
02:12:07,610 --> 02:12:10,910
That isn't how it works.
That's not how it works at all.

2383
02:12:11,180 --> 02:12:14,540
I don't think you can be convinced of 
the necessity for moral action until you

2384
02:12:14,541 --> 02:12:15,374
understand exactly how dark and terrible
things can get and that it's your fault 

2385
02:12:19,221 --> 02:12:22,640
that they're getting that way.
Who wants to think that?

2386
02:12:23,540 --> 02:12:27,140
So you can think it though,
but not,

2387
02:12:27,170 --> 02:12:28,700
not without it burning you.

2388
02:12:29,700 --> 02:12:31,410
So thanks so much,

2389
02:12:33,890 --> 02:12:36,680
lou.
Dr. Peterson a thank you for coming.

2390
02:12:37,100 --> 02:12:39,420
We appreciate it a lot.
Uh,

2391
02:12:39,430 --> 02:12:44,090
I wanted to get your opinion on 
censorship that we're seeing on the web.

2392
02:12:44,280 --> 02:12:45,560
Uh,
it's accelerating.

2393
02:12:45,561 --> 02:12:46,394
You were a very notable example.
You were locked out of your g male 

2394
02:12:48,820 --> 02:12:50,600
indian trump account.
Pardon me?

2395
02:12:52,100 --> 02:12:55,040
Yeah.
Trump's got a deleted by an in person,

2396
02:12:55,041 --> 02:12:57,170
you know,
now they're saying that perhaps this was

2397
02:12:57,171 --> 02:13:02,171
just a contractor and you know,
maybe someone from twitter who's gone in

2398
02:13:02,911 --> 02:13:03,744
a very far left direction.
A youtube has gone very far left 

2399
02:13:07,011 --> 02:13:09,320
direction.
I'm just wondering,

2400
02:13:09,321 --> 02:13:12,480
I've started an alternative to youtube 
called youtube.

2401
02:13:12,650 --> 02:13:14,330
Uh,
what kind of,

2402
02:13:14,490 --> 02:13:15,323
um,
what do you see for possible solutions 

2403
02:13:18,380 --> 02:13:22,850
and just your thoughts in generAl.
Here's a crazy thought,

2404
02:13:23,330 --> 02:13:24,163
but I'm going to tell it to you anyways.
So I Was just reading one of ray 

2405
02:13:27,021 --> 02:13:27,854
kurzweil's books,
I think it was called how to make a 

2406
02:13:29,271 --> 02:13:30,980
mind.
I really liked it actually.

2407
02:13:32,850 --> 02:13:36,220
It helped me understand how the brain 
compresses information because the world

2408
02:13:36,221 --> 02:13:40,170
is really complicated so you have to 
make a low resolution representations of

2409
02:13:40,171 --> 02:13:43,350
it to live in it.
And he actually explained to me in a way

2410
02:13:43,351 --> 02:13:46,500
that I hadn't really understood how the 
brain might do that neurologically.

2411
02:13:46,501 --> 02:13:47,790
So that was cool.
But you know,

2412
02:13:47,791 --> 02:13:50,700
kurtzweil is this guy who thinks that 
he's a smart guy,

2413
02:13:51,630 --> 02:13:56,250
very smart guy,
and he's invented a fair bit of high end

2414
02:13:56,251 --> 02:13:57,084
technical technological software and 
hardware and he's the guy that thinks 

2415
02:14:02,011 --> 02:14:03,690
that we're heading towards the 
singularity.

2416
02:14:03,691 --> 02:14:05,480
And so the singularity is,
you know,

2417
02:14:05,490 --> 02:14:06,323
how processing speed doubles every 18 
months and hard disk capacity every 

2418
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:11,873
year.
And there's a bunch of doublings going 

2419
02:14:13,471 --> 02:14:14,304
on,
a huge number of them and they 

2420
02:14:16,740 --> 02:14:20,550
accelerate exponentially.
And so it's probably,

2421
02:14:20,580 --> 02:14:21,413
we're probably three years away,
maybe even less then from building a 

2422
02:14:25,651 --> 02:14:26,484
computer that has the capacity to make 
as many calculations as reasonable 

2423
02:14:31,231 --> 02:14:35,610
estimates of the calculating capacity of
the human brain are currently set up,

2424
02:14:36,150 --> 02:14:38,940
18 months away,
two years away,

2425
02:14:38,941 --> 02:14:39,840
something like that.

2426
02:14:41,630 --> 02:14:42,463
And then we're 18 months away from 
having one that's twice that fast and 

2427
02:14:44,941 --> 02:14:47,730
then 18 months away from having one 
that's twice as fast as that.

2428
02:14:47,731 --> 02:14:48,564
So that's like say six years
and we've got something that's eight 

2429
02:14:52,651 --> 02:14:56,580
times as smart as a human being.
But there's a twist on that.

2430
02:14:56,581 --> 02:14:59,480
And this is kurtzweil twist,
which is as soon as you make a machine's

2431
02:14:59,481 --> 02:15:02,040
smart enough to make the next machine 
that's smarter than it,

2432
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:03,233
which is sort of what we're doing 
because computers are so fast that that 

2433
02:15:07,381 --> 02:15:08,214
will scale up to near infinite computing
power computing power almost 

2434
02:15:10,471 --> 02:15:13,500
instantaneously.
Now,

2435
02:15:14,170 --> 02:15:15,300
let me think.
No,

2436
02:15:15,301 --> 02:15:16,134
probably not.
And Alan Gates partner has written 

2437
02:15:20,281 --> 02:15:21,114
critiques of kurtzweil and you know,
you might think if something's 

2438
02:15:23,431 --> 02:15:25,820
impossible then it won't happen.
Even if you don't know why.

2439
02:15:25,821 --> 02:15:29,100
And there's reasons to,
to not think that that will happen.

2440
02:15:29,101 --> 02:15:29,934
But kurzweil's traced to back the 
doubling of computing power way before 

2441
02:15:34,291 --> 02:15:37,980
the existence of the transistor and it's
been ridiculously stable,

2442
02:15:38,220 --> 02:15:39,053
crazily stable,
so god only knows what we're coming up 

2443
02:15:42,241 --> 02:15:43,074
with here.

2444
02:15:43,530 --> 02:15:44,363
You know,
and you don't know what something have 

2445
02:15:45,481 --> 02:15:49,950
infinite computing power might be like,
like you seriously don't know.

2446
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:52,950
And there are serious people who are 
very,

2447
02:15:52,951 --> 02:15:54,660
very,
very worried about that.

2448
02:15:54,661 --> 02:15:55,950
They're very worried,
for example,

2449
02:15:55,951 --> 02:15:59,790
that companies like facebook and google 
will manage that first.

2450
02:16:00,300 --> 02:16:01,133
And you know,
tHose companies are already making 

2451
02:16:02,041 --> 02:16:06,090
censorship,
ai bots and that's not that smart.

2452
02:16:06,150 --> 02:16:08,880
It's sorta like making really fast 
robots that can shoot people.

2453
02:16:08,881 --> 02:16:12,180
It's not that smart.
And we're doing that to very rapidly.

2454
02:16:12,181 --> 02:16:13,014
And you know,
I know some guys who work in advanced 

2455
02:16:14,761 --> 02:16:16,340
ai,
you know how you look,

2456
02:16:16,380 --> 02:16:17,213
you watch the term terminator movies and
you see the robots that miss when they 

2457
02:16:19,891 --> 02:16:23,100
shoot at you,
like they're not very bright because the

2458
02:16:23,101 --> 02:16:25,230
bright ones not only shoot at where you 
are,

2459
02:16:25,231 --> 02:16:26,064
but they estimate where you're going to 
be when you make your escape moves and 

2460
02:16:28,051 --> 02:16:31,360
they shoot their simultaneously and 
their death rate is 100 percent.

2461
02:16:32,140 --> 02:16:36,430
And so there's no war against the 
robots.

2462
02:16:36,431 --> 02:16:37,690
I mean,
when those things get going,

2463
02:16:37,691 --> 02:16:38,524
they're going to be so much faster than 
us that will look like we're moving 

2464
02:16:40,511 --> 02:16:43,120
through molasses to them.
So

2465
02:16:47,030 --> 02:16:47,863
you know,
so maybe what we're deciding now with 

2466
02:16:49,011 --> 02:16:49,844
all of our individual decisions about 
censorship and the way that we're going 

2467
02:16:51,861 --> 02:16:52,694
to construct the world and all that is 
exactly what kind of super intelligence 

2468
02:16:55,371 --> 02:16:56,780
we're going to bring into being.

2469
02:16:57,690 --> 02:17:01,020
And I would suggest that we try to bring
one in that's good and moral rather than

2470
02:17:01,021 --> 02:17:05,100
one that's evil and demonic.
Right?

2471
02:17:05,850 --> 02:17:09,420
So what can we do about that?

2472
02:17:13,450 --> 02:17:15,340
The.
There's only one answer to that.

2473
02:17:15,341 --> 02:17:19,090
As far as I know that that works is gay 
rock together.

2474
02:17:20,530 --> 02:17:22,600
You're going to be the person who is 
working in ai,

2475
02:17:22,870 --> 02:17:25,330
right?
I know some of these people,

2476
02:17:25,900 --> 02:17:26,733
it better be good people because they're
going to build whatever they're like 

2477
02:17:29,110 --> 02:17:29,943
into their machines.
They better have their heads screwed on 

2478
02:17:32,321 --> 02:17:35,490
straight because they're going to get 
amplified like mad.

2479
02:17:35,770 --> 02:17:39,460
And I don't like What's happening with 
google and facebook and youtube.

2480
02:17:39,670 --> 02:17:40,503
They're building censorship bots 
predicated on a certain kind of 

2481
02:17:42,810 --> 02:17:43,643
ideology.
The kind of videology that we outlined 

2482
02:17:44,711 --> 02:17:47,530
today,
it's a very bad idea.

2483
02:17:52,730 --> 02:17:56,410
hopefully good people will stop that.
So then that,

2484
02:17:56,420 --> 02:18:00,440
what that means is that your moral 
obligation is to be good and the way you

2485
02:18:00,441 --> 02:18:05,441
do that is first by stopping being bad 
and everyone can do that a little bit.

2486
02:18:06,800 --> 02:18:11,800
So I hope that's what everyone does 
because the consequences of not doing it

2487
02:18:12,260 --> 02:18:14,540
are not going to be pleasant.
They never are.

2488
02:18:16,130 --> 02:18:16,963
Thank you.

2489
02:18:18,760 --> 02:18:19,593
Hi,
this question is about your biblical 

2490
02:18:21,010 --> 02:18:21,843
lecture series.

2491
02:18:22,540 --> 02:18:23,373
Um,

2492
02:18:23,770 --> 02:18:25,540
I liked that one because it's about 
genesis,

2493
02:18:25,541 --> 02:18:30,340
which is usually ignored as being where 
this post enlightenment society,

2494
02:18:30,341 --> 02:18:31,990
you don't need these ancient creation 
myths.

2495
02:18:32,560 --> 02:18:33,393
And also I thought revelations kind of 
gets the same treatment has been 

2496
02:18:36,910 --> 02:18:41,250
dismissed because it's the crazy 
hallucinogenic trip,

2497
02:18:41,800 --> 02:18:44,260
some isolated madman in the middle of 
the mediterranean.

2498
02:18:44,890 --> 02:18:47,050
So I was wondering if after you're done 
with genesis,

2499
02:18:47,051 --> 02:18:48,970
if you were thinking about doing 
revelations,

2500
02:18:49,270 --> 02:18:53,200
not without traversing the,
the geo geography in between.

2501
02:18:53,680 --> 02:18:55,240
Okay.
Yeah.

2502
02:18:55,241 --> 02:18:58,450
I want to walk through the whole thing 
if I can do that before they expire.

2503
02:19:00,820 --> 02:19:01,653
So I mean,
I've read it and thought about it and 

2504
02:19:04,440 --> 02:19:05,273
like it's such a strange book,
a because it's really big among the 

2505
02:19:08,021 --> 02:19:11,120
evangelical republican types and you'd 
think really,

2506
02:19:11,750 --> 02:19:14,930
really that's the book,
but you're relying,

2507
02:19:14,960 --> 02:19:16,640
have you read it?
It's,

2508
02:19:16,950 --> 02:19:17,783
it's,
it's,

2509
02:19:17,970 --> 02:19:20,790
it's,
it's A crazy hallucinogenic trip.

2510
02:19:20,820 --> 02:19:22,600
That's what revelation is now.

2511
02:19:22,660 --> 02:19:23,493
That's not to play it down because God 
only knows about crazy hallucinogenic 

2512
02:19:28,701 --> 02:19:30,560
trips,
that's for sure.

2513
02:19:30,710 --> 02:19:33,380
I mean there's,
there's accruing evidence.

2514
02:19:33,381 --> 02:19:34,214
I would say that a tremendous amount of 
the religious orientation of human 

2515
02:19:38,001 --> 02:19:38,661
beings,
you Know,

2516
02:19:38,661 --> 02:19:43,280
that deep mythological,
symbolic orientation is in no small part

2517
02:19:43,281 --> 02:19:44,114
a consequence of humanities 
experimentation with psychedelics 

2518
02:19:46,221 --> 02:19:47,980
substances.
I think that's,

2519
02:19:48,140 --> 02:19:52,580
that the evidence for that I think has 
become virtually an overwhelming.

2520
02:19:53,390 --> 02:19:56,060
So
anyways,

2521
02:19:56,061 --> 02:19:56,894
I will get there.
Maybe probably not because at the rate 

2522
02:19:59,901 --> 02:20:02,870
I'm going through the first stories,
it'll take me forever to get there,

2523
02:20:03,500 --> 02:20:05,120
but that's okay.
So.

2524
02:20:05,410 --> 02:20:06,120
Right.
Thank you.

2525
02:20:06,120 --> 02:20:06,953
Yep.

2526
02:20:08,980 --> 02:20:09,940
Dr. Peterson.
Thank you.

2527
02:20:09,941 --> 02:20:11,470
First of all,
it's great.

2528
02:20:11,471 --> 02:20:13,990
Pleasure being here.
It's awesome to see you live.

2529
02:20:14,050 --> 02:20:14,883
Um,
I basically got into your work's just 

2530
02:20:17,021 --> 02:20:19,450
earlier this year and I had an original 
question,

2531
02:20:19,451 --> 02:20:22,460
but your talk today kind of made me 
decide to change my mind and I was going

2532
02:20:22,461 --> 02:20:23,410
to ask,
um,

2533
02:20:24,160 --> 02:20:24,993
do you feel as though would you agree 
with me in the sentiment that the left 

2534
02:20:29,411 --> 02:20:30,244
has pushed so hard for total control of 
our society over the last however many 

2535
02:20:35,080 --> 02:20:37,420
years?
It's almost to a point where st 2013 was

2536
02:20:37,421 --> 02:20:38,254
a different time.
Would you say that because they pushed 

2537
02:20:42,551 --> 02:20:43,384
so hard,
they've created this backlash and the 

2538
02:20:45,461 --> 02:20:49,570
backlash created caused them to backlash
back again.

2539
02:20:49,571 --> 02:20:52,450
So they doubled down with their ideology
and then they get,

2540
02:20:52,990 --> 02:20:57,160
they lose another argument,
they lose another ideological war,

2541
02:20:57,190 --> 02:20:58,023
they lose,
lose another me more and they double 

2542
02:20:59,631 --> 02:21:02,410
down and then doubled down again and 
again.

2543
02:21:02,590 --> 02:21:05,710
And they can't seem to mean.
They can't seem to argue.

2544
02:21:05,890 --> 02:21:07,150
They can't see,
they can't,

2545
02:21:07,210 --> 02:21:09,190
they don't want to have an intellectual 
discussion.

2546
02:21:09,370 --> 02:21:12,730
And as an interpretation of what you 
were saying,

2547
02:21:12,970 --> 02:21:15,040
there is no,
there doesn't seem to be any,

2548
02:21:15,041 --> 02:21:17,980
any,
any care of what's right with them.

2549
02:21:18,010 --> 02:21:20,380
They just want power.
They just want,

2550
02:21:20,860 --> 02:21:22,950
they just want to win.
Um,

2551
02:21:22,990 --> 02:21:23,823
do you,
would you agree with the sentiment that 

2552
02:21:25,391 --> 02:21:26,224
they're burning themselves out and 
creating the mass red pilling of the 

2553
02:21:30,040 --> 02:21:32,140
conservative movement that we see going 
on?

2554
02:21:32,410 --> 02:21:35,620
Would you possibly think that maybe 
they've committed suicide and,

2555
02:21:36,040 --> 02:21:38,860
and talks like this,
people like yourself,

2556
02:21:38,920 --> 02:21:43,240
ben shapiro and others who talk to 
people like what?

2557
02:21:43,390 --> 02:21:46,090
The subjects that we do the taboo of 
nowadays,

2558
02:21:46,480 --> 02:21:49,820
um,
possibly that this,

2559
02:21:49,821 --> 02:21:54,490
this is the answer to defeat the,
the leftist stranglehold.

2560
02:21:54,500 --> 02:21:55,333
It's society.
I

2561
02:21:55,600 --> 02:21:57,110
will untangle some of that.
Okay.

2562
02:21:57,150 --> 02:21:59,320
So first of all,
well first of all,

2563
02:21:59,321 --> 02:22:00,154
the first observation is a really 
interesting one because you know that 

2564
02:22:02,650 --> 02:22:07,060
things can go out of hand very,
very rapidly and the reason they do that

2565
02:22:07,061 --> 02:22:09,220
is because of positive feedback loops.
Now,

2566
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:10,113
the thing that kurzweil talks about is a
positive feedback loop and intelligent 

2567
02:22:13,091 --> 02:22:13,924
machine makes another intelligent 
machine that makes another intelligent 

2568
02:22:16,271 --> 02:22:17,104
machine and that's a positive feedback 
loop and now can spiral upwards out of 

2569
02:22:20,951 --> 02:22:23,860
control very rapidly.
And that's when polarization is,

2570
02:22:23,861 --> 02:22:24,940
it's like,
I,

2571
02:22:25,290 --> 02:22:26,850
you,
you tap me,

2572
02:22:26,910 --> 02:22:30,240
I slapped you,
you punched me well up.

2573
02:22:30,241 --> 02:22:31,074
It goes well,
I think that's partly why in the new 

2574
02:22:33,481 --> 02:22:34,530
testament,
for example,

2575
02:22:34,531 --> 02:22:38,100
there's an injunction that says,
turn the other cheek,

2576
02:22:38,820 --> 02:22:41,250
resist not evil.
Why?

2577
02:22:42,630 --> 02:22:43,463
Because otherwise you get into a 
positive feedback loop and then you 

2578
02:22:45,391 --> 02:22:48,180
better look the hell out and things can 
tilt very,

2579
02:22:48,181 --> 02:22:49,020
very rapidly.

2580
02:22:49,290 --> 02:22:50,160
I mean,
all you have to do,

2581
02:22:50,190 --> 02:22:52,530
look at what happened in world war one.
No one expected that.

2582
02:22:52,531 --> 02:22:53,364
It waS like one,
one relatively minor member I think of 

2583
02:22:59,311 --> 02:23:01,290
the aristocracy,
if I remember correctly,

2584
02:23:01,291 --> 02:23:04,560
waS assassinated in one minor little 
Country.

2585
02:23:04,600 --> 02:23:05,433
It's like bang,
everything fell apart and that's 

2586
02:23:08,230 --> 02:23:09,690
positive feedback loops.
Right?

2587
02:23:10,200 --> 02:23:12,400
And so that's what we're in right now 
and we've got to be.

2588
02:23:12,610 --> 02:23:13,443
That's a really chaotic time and so I 
would say maintain self control and 

2589
02:23:18,781 --> 02:23:21,150
don't aim to win.
Amen.

2590
02:23:21,270 --> 02:23:23,340
Peace.
Because winning,

2591
02:23:23,341 --> 02:23:24,900
that's,
that's not peace.

2592
02:23:24,960 --> 02:23:27,480
It's better to aim for pace.
You know,

2593
02:23:27,570 --> 02:23:29,910
I've got this tart coming up in November
11th.

2594
02:23:30,770 --> 02:23:31,603
I'm quite worried about it because I 
know there's going to be protesters 

2595
02:23:33,631 --> 02:23:34,464
there and that they've been emboldened 
by the fact that they shut the torque 

2596
02:23:36,330 --> 02:23:37,163
down before and I want to make a video.
I'Ll probably do it tomorrow telling 

2597
02:23:40,261 --> 02:23:41,094
everyone that comes to that meeting to 
like watch their bloody step and stay 

2598
02:23:45,450 --> 02:23:50,450
out of the gutter because you just,
we're at,

2599
02:23:51,490 --> 02:23:52,260
we're at.

2600
02:23:52,260 --> 02:23:55,740
We're at a point now where under the 
wrong circumstances,

2601
02:23:55,800 --> 02:23:58,500
if the wrong person does the wrong 
thing,

2602
02:23:59,040 --> 02:24:01,200
that the consequences will be very 
great.

2603
02:24:01,230 --> 02:24:06,230
Now we can't predict which action is 
going to precipitate that and or even if

2604
02:24:07,831 --> 02:24:12,060
that will happen,
but it's chaotic enough so that it could

2605
02:24:12,061 --> 02:24:14,090
happen.
So you know,

2606
02:24:14,091 --> 02:24:18,540
so govern yourselves accordingly.
Now the problem is that there are people

2607
02:24:18,630 --> 02:24:21,330
who would be happy if there was blood 
running in the street.

2608
02:24:21,450 --> 02:24:24,690
They the same sort of people that shoot 
up high schools or kill innocent,

2609
02:24:24,990 --> 02:24:27,930
you know,
elementary school kids just to show what

2610
02:24:27,931 --> 02:24:30,870
they're made of and what they believe.
And that's a big problem.

2611
02:24:30,871 --> 02:24:34,380
But for the rest of us,
like hopefully calmer heads can prevail.

2612
02:24:34,560 --> 02:24:36,810
And so it really is important not to 
win.

2613
02:24:37,920 --> 02:24:38,753
It's like fighting with your wife.
You don't when you can't because you 

2614
02:24:43,141 --> 02:24:44,040
have to live with her.

2615
02:24:44,310 --> 02:24:45,143
I just can't win,
but maybe you can solve the problem and 

2616
02:24:47,671 --> 02:24:48,504
bring about peace and so you've got to 
practice doing that practice restraint 

2617
02:24:52,960 --> 02:24:53,793
now and remember too that these people 
that you're talking about who had 

2618
02:24:56,521 --> 02:25:01,521
radical leftist is most of the time,
they're not like they're 95 percent like

2619
02:25:02,071 --> 02:25:06,870
you and if you pull them out of the mob,
they're just like your neighbors.

2620
02:25:06,990 --> 02:25:10,620
Nineteen year old kid who's kind of 
clueless and rebellious.

2621
02:25:10,621 --> 02:25:13,950
Right.
And who you might even like you put them

2622
02:25:13,951 --> 02:25:15,510
in the mall,
but it's a whole different thing.

2623
02:25:15,511 --> 02:25:17,550
And so you got to remember that too.
Oh,

2624
02:25:17,590 --> 02:25:22,250
the fear of social isolation kind of.
You're saying no,

2625
02:25:22,260 --> 02:25:24,850
it's just that they're possessed by 
these ideas,

2626
02:25:24,851 --> 02:25:26,650
but,
but only partially,

2627
02:25:26,860 --> 02:25:30,670
you know,
you hardly find it full blooded.

2628
02:25:30,940 --> 02:25:34,240
Absolutely committed radical leftist 
activist,

2629
02:25:34,241 --> 02:25:36,190
you know,
like there are some but not very many.

2630
02:25:36,191 --> 02:25:37,024
Most of it is just fragmentary behavior 
and you have to remember that like when 

2631
02:25:41,111 --> 02:25:43,690
the students come out to protest me was 
a case,

2632
02:25:43,691 --> 02:25:45,010
particularly at mcmaster.

2633
02:25:45,010 --> 02:25:50,010
I have to remember these kids,
they're not much different than my kids.

2634
02:25:51,970 --> 02:25:55,390
They are when they're in a stupid mob 
behind a hammer and sickle flag,

2635
02:25:55,780 --> 02:25:56,590
you know,
but,

2636
02:25:56,590 --> 02:25:57,423
but,
but

2637
02:25:59,290 --> 02:26:04,290
you don't want to make a low resolution,
homogenous representation of them and so

2638
02:26:06,370 --> 02:26:07,930
and so you.
That's why,

2639
02:26:07,931 --> 02:26:09,400
again,
I think instead of winning,

2640
02:26:09,401 --> 02:26:12,610
you turn to your own development,
you turn to your own development,

2641
02:26:12,611 --> 02:26:13,444
you do what you can to stop doing the 
things that you're doing that aren't 

2642
02:26:16,301 --> 02:26:19,030
good because you're not going to hurt 
anybody if you do that.

2643
02:26:19,031 --> 02:26:19,864
All you're going to do is help and 
otherwise you'll participate in this 

2644
02:26:22,481 --> 02:26:27,160
polarization and that's unless you want 
that.

2645
02:26:27,320 --> 02:26:28,153
And you know,
there's a dark part of people that it's 

2646
02:26:30,130 --> 02:26:34,120
part of the part that voted for trump 
would like to burn things to the ground.

2647
02:26:34,450 --> 02:26:35,283
It's like to help.
I know how people felt when they went 

2648
02:26:36,851 --> 02:26:37,510
into the voting booth.

2649
02:26:37,510 --> 02:26:39,700
It was like hillary hillary to hell with
it.

2650
02:26:39,760 --> 02:26:40,930
Trump,
you know,

2651
02:26:40,931 --> 02:26:41,764
and that's,
that's a hell of a thing to say to hell 

2652
02:26:43,271 --> 02:26:44,470
with it.
You know.

2653
02:26:44,830 --> 02:26:45,663
Although I could,
I could certainly understand that 

2654
02:26:46,901 --> 02:26:47,734
sentiment.
So we have to be careful and all of you 

2655
02:26:52,001 --> 02:26:52,834
people who are here who are advocates of
free speech and who are theoretically 

2656
02:26:57,880 --> 02:26:58,713
happy to come hear me speak,
it's like I really do believe it are 

2657
02:27:00,641 --> 02:27:01,474
truly believed this and this is 
something I learned in part from social 

2658
02:27:03,521 --> 02:27:05,080
units and then part from you all missed 
that.

2659
02:27:05,440 --> 02:27:06,273
The way that you set the world straight 
is by constraining the malevolence in 

2660
02:27:10,661 --> 02:27:12,790
your own heart.
And that's no joke,

2661
02:27:12,791 --> 02:27:13,624
man.
That's no easy thing and that's a good 

2662
02:27:15,640 --> 02:27:16,473
voyage for people to go on if they want 
something difficult and worthwhile to 

2663
02:27:19,181 --> 02:27:20,410
do.
So.

2664
02:27:21,310 --> 02:27:22,143
Thank you very much.

2665
02:27:23,940 --> 02:27:25,650
Okay,
just a quick thing.

2666
02:27:26,280 --> 02:27:27,780
We're not going to have time for 
pictures,

2667
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:28,673
so you're.
Unless you're yours is the last 

2668
02:27:30,391 --> 02:27:31,320
question.
Okay.

2669
02:27:31,321 --> 02:27:34,050
So sorry to everybody else,
but you're the last one.

2670
02:27:34,230 --> 02:27:35,063
Okay.

2671
02:27:39,410 --> 02:27:40,890
Hi Dr. Peterson.
Thanks for coming.

2672
02:27:40,980 --> 02:27:41,813
Uh,
my question is a little bit off topic 

2673
02:27:44,041 --> 02:27:46,830
from everything else tonight,
but I really wanted to hear what you had

2674
02:27:46,831 --> 02:27:47,810
to say about it.
Um,

2675
02:27:48,660 --> 02:27:53,660
I work in residence life here at ubc and
in the community where I am,

2676
02:27:55,291 --> 02:27:56,124
we were recently effected by a suicide 
of someone who lived in our community 

2677
02:28:00,751 --> 02:28:01,584
and that I was upset about it,
not just because obviously it's a 

2678
02:28:03,541 --> 02:28:04,374
horrible thing to have happen,
but also because rez life in the 

2679
02:28:07,621 --> 02:28:08,454
university,
like they talk all this talk about self 

2680
02:28:10,171 --> 02:28:13,320
care and your mental health is so 
important to us.

2681
02:28:13,321 --> 02:28:15,700
But then things like this still 
happened.

2682
02:28:15,701 --> 02:28:18,750
So I wanted to know,
like if you think like,

2683
02:28:18,751 --> 02:28:21,030
what do you think the university should 
be doing?

2684
02:28:21,530 --> 02:28:22,070
Keep stuff

2685
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:23,330
like this from happening in the future?

2686
02:28:27,100 --> 02:28:27,933
Well,

2687
02:28:30,820 --> 02:28:31,653
it's not self evident that it's the 
university's responsibility and the 

2688
02:28:36,401 --> 02:28:38,620
reason for that.
I'm not saying it isn't.

2689
02:28:38,790 --> 02:28:39,520
Okay,
I'm,

2690
02:28:39,520 --> 02:28:40,353
I'm saying it's not self evident that it
is because different institutions can 

2691
02:28:44,291 --> 02:28:46,020
only do so many things,
you know,

2692
02:28:46,030 --> 02:28:46,863
and we were already requiring that the 
university is to educate and to act as 

2693
02:28:51,850 --> 02:28:56,800
substitute parents increasingly and to 
take on the role of judge,

2694
02:28:57,370 --> 02:28:58,203
jury and executioner as there are more.
What should be criminal cases are being 

2695
02:29:05,311 --> 02:29:07,230
handled within the university.
Say,

2696
02:29:08,200 --> 02:29:09,033
um.

2697
02:29:12,650 --> 02:29:15,230
Having said that,
you could ask the broader question is,

2698
02:29:15,231 --> 02:29:16,064
well,
what do you do to help people be 

2699
02:29:19,041 --> 02:29:23,380
sufficiently in love with life so that 
they don't wish to end it now?

2700
02:29:23,420 --> 02:29:24,253
And I've tried to puzzle through that 
for a long time and that's partly why 

2701
02:29:27,501 --> 02:29:29,030
I've written the things that I've 
written.

2702
02:29:29,180 --> 02:29:32,390
It's partly why I've produced the online
programs that I've produced,

2703
02:29:32,930 --> 02:29:36,800
you know,
and so we know that if you do,

2704
02:29:36,860 --> 02:29:38,930
if you have students do the future 
authoring program,

2705
02:29:38,931 --> 02:29:39,764
for example,
they're much less likely to drop out of 

2706
02:29:41,060 --> 02:29:43,970
university about 30 percent less likely 
and their grades go up.

2707
02:29:43,971 --> 02:29:48,440
And That's especially true if they're 
male and marginalized.

2708
02:29:48,620 --> 02:29:50,780
It has a bigger impact on those 
communities.

2709
02:29:51,290 --> 02:29:52,160
And so,
you know,

2710
02:29:52,161 --> 02:29:54,680
I've tried to get university's interests
now the data's there,

2711
02:29:54,681 --> 02:29:55,514
but they're not.
And it's very difficult to get a big 

2712
02:29:57,381 --> 02:29:58,370
bureaucracy to move.

2713
02:29:58,370 --> 02:30:02,000
A big,
big is immobile.

2714
02:30:02,840 --> 02:30:06,680
So I'm not sure there's anything they 
can really do about it.

2715
02:30:07,130 --> 02:30:07,963
It's certainly possible that the things 
that they're trying to do about it or 

2716
02:30:09,891 --> 02:30:11,340
making it worse,
you know,

2717
02:30:11,360 --> 02:30:14,070
that's another thing that you learn if 
you're a good social scientists.

2718
02:30:14,090 --> 02:30:14,923
Just like there was evidence,
and I don't know if this is still the 

2719
02:30:17,211 --> 02:30:19,160
case,
but there was good evidence.

2720
02:30:19,670 --> 02:30:23,210
I looked into this about 15 years ago.
Say you want to prevent suicides,

2721
02:30:23,211 --> 02:30:27,200
produce suicide hotline in your town and
you advertise it.

2722
02:30:27,260 --> 02:30:28,093
What happens?
Suicide rate goes up because you're 

2723
02:30:30,531 --> 02:30:32,900
advertising suicide,
right?

2724
02:30:33,050 --> 02:30:35,390
And lots of lots of interventions are 
like that.

2725
02:30:35,391 --> 02:30:36,224
It's really,
really hard to make thinGs better and 

2726
02:30:38,601 --> 02:30:40,970
it's really,
really easy to make them worse.

2727
02:30:41,510 --> 02:30:44,600
And so that's another problem.
You get these big bureaucracies,

2728
02:30:44,601 --> 02:30:45,434
let's say,
and there hypothetically motivated by 

2729
02:30:46,521 --> 02:30:49,070
positive intentions and I would say 
hypothetically,

2730
02:30:49,071 --> 02:30:51,470
again,
because it takes an awful lot of work to

2731
02:30:51,471 --> 02:30:53,630
help someone straightened out.
It's no joke,

2732
02:30:53,750 --> 02:30:57,890
especially if they're in real trouble 
and they put in place these

2733
02:30:59,690 --> 02:31:00,523
structures that are designed to help but
they don't ever evaluate them and they 

2734
02:31:03,591 --> 02:31:06,980
could easily be making it worse.
So.

2735
02:31:09,710 --> 02:31:11,930
So I don't have a straightforward answer
to that question.

2736
02:31:12,820 --> 02:31:14,870
Um,
I think that.

2737
02:31:16,710 --> 02:31:17,190
Well,
that's,

2738
02:31:17,190 --> 02:31:18,870
that's the only answer I have.
Yeah.

2739
02:31:18,960 --> 02:31:19,793
Thank you.
Okay.

2740
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:21,390
Yep.
Okay.

2741
02:31:21,391 --> 02:31:23,170
So that's the end of the show.
Uh,

2742
02:31:23,490 --> 02:31:24,323
if you're in the first two rows,
you can stick around and get some 

2743
02:31:25,861 --> 02:31:26,820
pictures.
Otherwise,

2744
02:31:26,821 --> 02:31:31,821
a drive safe and yeah.
Thank you.
