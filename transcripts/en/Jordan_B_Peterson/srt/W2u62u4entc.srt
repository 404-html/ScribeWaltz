1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,800
Good Morning Boys,
girls,

2
00:00:01,801 --> 00:00:06,330
and interested others.
I said a couple of days ago,

3
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:07,164
last week that I was going to produce 
three videos on political correctness 

4
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:11,580
and that the third one would be about 
tactics.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:12,923
So that's what I'm doing this morning.
I'll probably produce a number of 

6
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:16,704
relatively short videos on tactics 
because I think that that might be more 

7
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:22,350
effective way to,
to disseminate them.

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:27,150
And so by tactics,
what I'm trying to figure out is how the

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,013
rhetoric surrounding these issues can be
translated into effective action at the 

10
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:32,334
individual level.
So I'm hoping that people who want to 

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,850
play a tactical game with the,
with a PC extremists,

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,033
uh,
take it upon themselves as individuals 

13
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:45,660
to stand up against this and to 
hopefully do something about it.

14
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:47,670
And,
and that's not going to be an easy thing

15
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:48,504
to do.
And hopefully we can do it with some 

16
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:51,744
good humor and,
and some and some and a light touch and 

17
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:58,740
a bit of detachment and in a peaceful 
and thoughtful and rational way.

18
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,263
And so I'm going to propose a game today
that I've designed with some of the 

19
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:06,210
people who are helping me think this 
through.

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,530
And I'm gonna walk you through that.
All right.

21
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:14,880
So we're gonna start by talking about 
the PC game and the PC game is a form of

22
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:16,530
videology.
And,

23
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,393
uh,
what an ideology does is attempt to 

24
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:19,314
simplify the world in a very radical way
so that it indicates to it's holders 

25
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:25,050
that they have understanding even when 
they don't.

26
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,990
And that way it reduces uncertainty,
uncertainty,

27
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:28,824
and anxiety.
And it also helps them improve their 

28
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:34,260
short term regulation because if they 
can view themselves,

29
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:37,170
idiot logs can view themselves as proper
game players,

30
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,630
then they can feel good about their 
position in the world.

31
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,493
And so the purpose of the PC game,
which I think is technically a biased 

32
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:44,634
compression algorithm,
what it does is it takes the complexity 

33
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:49,650
of the world and compresses it to a few 
simple axioms.

34
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,080
Um,
and it does that.

35
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,700
It's a biased impression,
your algorithm,

36
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:54,534
I think because it doesn't accurately 
represent the complexity of the world 

37
00:01:58,081 --> 00:01:59,970
across,
it's the full array of,

38
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,120
of detail necessary to deal with it 
effectively.

39
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,620
Um,
all right,

40
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:06,780
so here are the rules of the PC game 
and,

41
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:08,880
and this is I think what's taught to 
students,

42
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:09,943
uh,
on mouse in universities now as an 

43
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,893
alternative to actual critical thinking 
and the development of a comprehensive 

44
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:20,430
and powerful and a functional individual
philosophy.

45
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,340
It's the alternative to wisdom.
That's one way of looking at it.

46
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:25,290
Okay,
so here are the rules of the PC game.

47
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,290
First of all,
what you do is identify an area of human

48
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:30,870
activity.
Could be any error of human activity.

49
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,130
Uh,
could be sports,

50
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:35,430
it could be writing,
it could be socioeconomic status,

51
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:37,440
it could be that the garnering of 
wealth.

52
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,413
It doesn't matter anywhere where people 
are doing something that can be 

53
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:43,560
identifiably,
um,

54
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,180
measured in terms of its outcome and 
evaluate along that way.

55
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:51,630
Then the next thing you do is you note 
that there's a distribution of success.

56
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:56,040
And of course there's a distribution of 
success in any human creative activity.

57
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,520
And it's partly because in most human 
domains of activity,

58
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,480
there are winner take all games.
That's called a pareto distribution.

59
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:05,980
You can look that up if you want.
P,

60
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:06,520
a,
R,

61
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,031
e,
t,

62
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:07,864
O,
but most domains of human creative 

63
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:11,800
achievement,
followup prieto distribution.

64
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:13,030
And that's why,
for example,

65
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:15,880
that a very small minority of people 
have most of the money.

66
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,143
Um,
it's also true that a small minority of 

67
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,713
authors write most of the books and a 
small minority of those who sell books 

68
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,550
have,
uh,

69
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:29,080
the biggest bestsellers and why a very 
small number of recordings,

70
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:31,780
for example,
audio recordings become successful.

71
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:34,840
And why a very small number of players 
dominate each game.

72
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:35,674
And it's very common.
So there's definitely a distribution of 

73
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:39,250
success in any domain of human activity.

74
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,083
So you note that then what you do is 
identify the people who are being 

75
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:43,564
successful as winners and the people who
are being relatively unsuccessful as 

76
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:48,430
losers.
Okay.

77
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,353
And then you claim that the losers are 
losing only because they are oppressed 

78
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:54,034
by the winters.
So you can dispense with things like 

79
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:57,520
competence and quality when you're doing
that.

80
00:03:57,521 --> 00:04:00,670
And that's really useful if you're an 
enemy of competence and quality.

81
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,953
So anyways,
you claim that the losers are losing 

82
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:04,720
because they're oppressed by the 
winners.

83
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,853
Then you claiming allegiance with the 
losers and so you put yourself on the 

84
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:11,710
side of those that you define as 
unfairly victimized.

85
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,263
Then that allows you to do two things.
One is to feel secure in your 

86
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:16,834
comprehensive explanation of the world.
And it also helps if you surround 

87
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:22,240
yourself with people who think exactly 
the same way you do,

88
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:23,074
because then that oversimplified and 
actually rather pathetic comprehensive 

89
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:29,800
explanation of the world never goes on 
challenged.

90
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,053
Then the next thing you do is revel in 
your moral superiority because what 

91
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,074
you've done as well as oversimplifying 
the world is placed yourself forever on 

92
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:39,364
the side of the morally righteous.
And you've been able to do that with a 

93
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:42,154
minimum of cognitive effort and no ass,
no actual expertise and no real desire 

94
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:46,834
to mate or no,
no commitment to making a positive 

95
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:50,830
change in the world.
Because that's a very,

96
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:51,664
very difficult thing.
It takes years to make a positive 

97
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:55,160
change.
Even at,

98
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:55,810
at,
uh,

99
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,710
uh,
uh,

100
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,840
kind of a minute level of the social 
structure.

101
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,170
So,
so you've oversimplified the world,

102
00:05:02,171 --> 00:05:03,004
you get to revel in your moral 
superiority and this is the real dark 

103
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:06,484
side of such movements is that whatever 
resentment you might have as a 

104
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:10,534
consequence of construing yourself as a 
victim or as identify or because of 

105
00:05:13,451 --> 00:05:17,410
identifying with victims that's 
generated a fair bit of resentment would

106
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:22,360
you can then target towards your newly 
discovered enemies and resentment fueled

107
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,480
targeting is a very dangerous 
phenomenon.

108
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,060
Um,
it's the sort of thing that,

109
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,313
well,
suffice it to say that it's a very 

110
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:31,234
dangerous phenomenon,
then what you do is repeat the game 

111
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,000
forever everywhere.
And it's,

112
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:40,600
it's a very good game in that regard 
because you can continually identify new

113
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:45,601
domains of human achievement and you can
continually multiply the categories of,

114
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,180
of winners and losers and you can do 
that outed and fund item essentially.

115
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:53,020
So that it's a game that you can never,
it's a game that will never end,

116
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:56,050
which is part of the reason why I'm 
doing what I can to try to put a stop to

117
00:05:56,051 --> 00:05:56,884
it,
or at least put a stop to its perceived 

118
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:00,290
validity.
It's really,

119
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,071
look,
I mean,

120
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:01,904
you can learn to play this game in about
two hours and that's what people are 

121
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:06,470
taught to do in many,
many university,

122
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,490
uh,
departments now.

123
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,520
And I think it's,
I think it's absolutely pathetic.

124
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,190
I think it's morally reprehensible.
I think it's,

125
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:13,900
uh,
it,

126
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,510
it abandons the principle of individual 
responsibility.

127
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,990
I think it's intellectually specious.
I think it's hollow.

128
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:23,030
I think it's badly motivated.
Uh,

129
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,953
there's almost no end to the number of 
bad things that can be said about this 

130
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:28,280
game.
Okay.

131
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,960
And,
and I think it's got out of hand,

132
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,033
so,
so why has it become necessary to do 

133
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:35,780
something about this now?
Well,

134
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,250
I,
as I said already,

135
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:38,750
I think it's gone too far.
Of course,

136
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:39,584
that's only my own personal opinion,
but I'm trying to stay attentive to the 

137
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,400
psychological underpinnings of the 
political landscape.

138
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:48,800
And it is my opinion that this has gone 
too far.

139
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:49,910
And,
um,

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,170
you know,
pc,

141
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,670
the PC movement was quite powerful in 
the 1990s,

142
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:58,760
although it disappeared back into the 
underworld from,

143
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,653
from which it emerged.
And I thought maybe at that point we 

144
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:02,384
were done with it,
but that was wrong because it's come 

145
00:07:04,011 --> 00:07:06,230
back with a vengeance,
especially in the last five years.

146
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,063
And I've been trying to sort of why that
is and here's why what I think's 

147
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,480
happening.
I think that the universities,

148
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,953
especially the radical left leaning 
departments and those would be the 

149
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:18,010
women's studies departments and,
and,

150
00:07:18,011 --> 00:07:20,240
and those,
those sorts of places.

151
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,513
Um,
there's other departments that I think 

152
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:26,360
are also primarily responsible.
Um,

153
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,830
there are estimates that about 20% of 
social scientists identify themselves to

154
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:34,850
use a cursed phrase as Marxists.
And,

155
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:35,481
uh,
you know,

156
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:36,314
I don't think that's a very good idea 
because Marxism produced the death of 

157
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:40,004
millions of people in the 20th century.
And if you don't think that Marxism was 

158
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,720
Marxism was directly responsible for 
that,

159
00:07:44,721 --> 00:07:45,554
then I would recommend that you read 
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn Gulag 

160
00:07:47,391 --> 00:07:50,570
archipelago.
Of course it's 2,700 pages long and it's

161
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:53,360
extraordinarily emotionally draining to 
read.

162
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,553
But Solzhenitsyn does an unbelievably 
good job of detailing out his argument 

163
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:03,311
for why the murderous excesses of places
like this Delonis Soviet Union and Mao's

164
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:04,214
China and Vietnam and Cambodia and all 
the other places where Marxist murders 

165
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:08,384
took place,
weren't aberrations in relationship to 

166
00:08:11,361 --> 00:08:14,630
Marxist ideas,
but the purest expression of the,

167
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,630
of the philosophy that was embodied 
inside that,

168
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,613
that doctrine.

169
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,453
So you can read that if you want.
It's one of the seminal books of the 

170
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:22,844
20th century and I don't think that you,
you can actually have a reasonable 

171
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:28,310
dialog about this sort of thing if 
you're not familiar with it.

172
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:29,144
Partly because Solzhenitsyn's book was 
one of the major causes of the collapse 

173
00:08:33,771 --> 00:08:34,950
of the Soviet Union.
Uh,

174
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,240
he,
he eradicated any shreds of intellectual

175
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:42,170
respectability that the doctrine upon 
which the Soviet Union had been built,

176
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,950
still maintained after,
after it's decades of,

177
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,820
of unbelievable murderous existed.
So I'd recommend that you read that,

178
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,003
um,
before you enter into this kind of 

179
00:08:52,341 --> 00:08:53,180
argument.
But,

180
00:08:53,181 --> 00:08:54,014
uh,
one of the things I'm going to do is to 

181
00:08:54,591 --> 00:08:58,230
start to make some videos about soldier 
Mitson and his writing so that everybody

182
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,633
has a chance to understand what it was 
that he was talking about because 2,700 

183
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:06,150
pages is a pretty long slog.
So anyways,

184
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,853
there have been many,
many left radical left leaning 

185
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,290
departments,
training people over the last 30 years.

186
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,980
I'm not only in how to think they've 
taught them how to play the PC game,

187
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:17,814
but they explain,
explicitly trained them how to become 

188
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:20,604
effective activists.
And if you go on women's studies 

189
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:26,070
websites for example,
I've done this with many such websites,

190
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:31,350
they proudly trumpet their training of,
of radical leftist activists and they're

191
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:32,310
very,
very good at it.

192
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:33,144
Make no mistake.
And so I think the universities have 

193
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:37,020
probably trained,
I don't know exactly how to generate the

194
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:39,780
estimates.
I think the lower bound is about 300,000

195
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:44,250
people and the upper bound might be 10 
times that trained them over the last 30

196
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,200
years.
Um,

197
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,690
and now they exist at many levels of the
social hierarchy and you know,

198
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:50,460
so at the top level of the social 
hierarchy,

199
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:51,294
there's our political structures and 
then you can fragment that into major 

200
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:54,744
organizations and fragment that into 
minor sub organizations and put the 

201
00:09:57,781 --> 00:09:59,220
individuals at the bottom of that.

202
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,800
Um,
I think that the,

203
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:05,730
the PC,
the PC game players have infiltrated our

204
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:09,210
institutions at many,
many levels of the hierarchy.

205
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,820
Um,
and they're also now writing legislation

206
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:12,654
at the top.
And now we've got a positive feedback 

207
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:14,874
loop going between the legislation,
legislative activities at the top and 

208
00:10:18,061 --> 00:10:18,894
the people who are acting as essentially
insurgents for this movement at all the 

209
00:10:21,631 --> 00:10:22,464
levels of the social hierarchy.
And it's producing an increasingly 

210
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:28,440
rigidified positive feedback loop.
I think it's also,

211
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:29,274
you could also think about it as an 
example of what has been described as 

212
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:34,930
the long march through the institutions.
Uh,

213
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,490
you can look this up on Wikipedia,
the long march through the institutions,

214
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:42,090
but we'll look first to say what to see.
What Herbert marcuse said about it.

215
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:43,803
Uh,
marcuse was a member of the Frankfurt 

216
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,253
School of critical theory,
which is a neo Marxist school of 

217
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:49,464
thought.

218
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,590
Um,
he commented about this idea of the long

219
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:54,620
march through the institutions,
which was a,

220
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,920
a student named Rudy Dukie in the 1960s 
generated this idea.

221
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,713
And here's the idea.
We have to work against the established 

222
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:06,570
institutions while working within them,
but not simply by boring,

223
00:11:06,571 --> 00:11:09,180
from within.
Rather by doing the job,

224
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,520
learning how to program and read 
computers,

225
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:14,430
how to teach at all levels of education,
how to use the mass media,

226
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:17,010
how to organize production,
how to recognize an issue,

227
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,320
planned obsolescence,
how to design,

228
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:20,940
et Cetera.
And at the same time,

229
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:23,220
preserve our consciousness in working 
with others.

230
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:24,990
And that means our political 
consciousness.

231
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:26,790
So,
you know,

232
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,850
this has happened and it's happened at 
least in part,

233
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,030
as a consequence of conscious planning.
And so,

234
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,320
um,
to me that,

235
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,490
to me,
that,

236
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,390
that seems a potentially very dangerous,
um,

237
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,370
because it doesn't take that many 
committed people.

238
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,840
Uh,
it doesn't take that large of a large,

239
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,713
uh,
committed minority to produce 

240
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:48,150
substantive changes in the society.
So,

241
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:48,691
and,
uh,

242
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:51,360
we see those changes happening now and I
think they're,

243
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,250
they're very detrimental to things as 
free speech.

244
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:55,084
And I regard free speech as a 
prerequisite to a civilized society 

245
00:11:58,121 --> 00:12:01,840
because freedom of speech means that you
can have combat with words.

246
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,703
That's what it means.
It doesn't mean that people can happily 

247
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,824
and gently exchange opinions.
It means that we can engage in combat 

248
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,573
with words and the battleground of ideas
and the reason that that's acceptable 

249
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,283
and why it's acceptable that people's 
feelings get hurt during that combat is 

250
00:12:16,811 --> 00:12:21,160
that the combat of ideas is far 
preferable to actual combat.

251
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,143
And it's also the only alternative 
because people have genuine 

252
00:12:24,071 --> 00:12:24,904
disagreements.
And if you don't let them talk them out 

253
00:12:26,171 --> 00:12:29,740
and reach some sort of consensus,
some court of negotiated settlement,

254
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:30,743
then then they can either swallow their 
opinions and become enraged or they can 

255
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:35,830
engage in actual combat.

256
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,873
And so I think anything that threatens 
freedom of speech threatens the 

257
00:12:39,131 --> 00:12:41,950
stability of the society.
And I think the PC accesses,

258
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,200
uh,
threatened freedom of speech.

259
00:12:44,201 --> 00:12:45,820
And I think they threatened it quite 
severely.

260
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,680
I already know people,
for example,

261
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:48,514
at the universities who are loath to 
teach anything to do with gender or 

262
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:53,470
sexual identity because they're afraid 
of saying the wrong thing.

263
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,200
And that puts a pall over,
over,

264
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,330
over free discussion at the university 
on,

265
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,090
on a whole array of vital issues.
So,

266
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,310
all right,
so having said that,

267
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,593
I've identified the PC game,
I've identified why I think it's 

268
00:13:06,881 --> 00:13:09,640
dangerous and why it spread so rapidly.
Um,

269
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,860
I think that now we need at least in 
part,

270
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:12,843
we need tactics to fight back.
And so one of the things I'm going to 

271
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:18,880
propose as a counter game and here's the
principles that I think the counter game

272
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,550
has to be able to,
um,

273
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,440
here's the features that the counter 
game has to have.

274
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,230
It has to play,
be playable everywhere.

275
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,510
Cause obviously the PC game is playable 
everywhere.

276
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,433
It has to make the point.
And the point is that there is 

277
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,500
widespread opposition to these pc ideas 
and that the opposition is,

278
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,100
is uh,
is,

279
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,000
is uh,
important and uh,

280
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,873
needs to be attended to carefully.
It has to spread fast and it would help 

281
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:48,490
if it was a bit humorous because it 
would be good if we could do this with a

282
00:13:48,491 --> 00:13:49,324
bit of detachment and um,
some rationality and some careful 

283
00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:56,350
argumentation and some playfulness and,
and some,

284
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,050
um,
well all of that would be real good.

285
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,280
But it's not an easy thing to manage 
because it's a serious business and um,

286
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,130
but you have to keep a light touch when 
you're doing this sort of thing.

287
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,993
That's one of the indications that 
you've actually attained some mastery 

288
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:11,230
over it.
So keep that in mind when,

289
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,073
when you're,
if you're interested in this sort of 

290
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:14,284
thing.

291
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:19,120
So I'm going to announce pokemon pc and 
I'd like to first say that of course the

292
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:19,954
good people who've produced the pokemon 
artifacts in the past and products have 

293
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:24,760
nothing to do with this.
And so,

294
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:25,933
um,
they can't be blamed for it and I hope 

295
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:32,731
they'll forgive me for using their 
terminology in a satirical and political

296
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:34,690
manner.
It can,

297
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,000
everyone can play.
It's all the rage.

298
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:41,140
It's spreading like wildfire.
Here are the rules to Pokemon PC.

299
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:45,010
First purchase your starter pack of 
Pokemon pc stickers.

300
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,730
So I've put them on Ebay.
I've ordered about 5,000 of them.

301
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,220
You can buy a starter pack of 50 or a 
hundred.

302
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,660
Um,
and if you feel like doing that,

303
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:54,494
then I would encourage you to do it.
I don't know if people will be 

304
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:56,954
interested in this,
but it's an experiment considered an 

305
00:14:58,581 --> 00:15:01,010
experiment.
If you're feeling really enthusiastic by

306
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:02,780
a couple of them,
give them to your friends.

307
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,640
Advanced players can purchase the 
accessory packs too,

308
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:09,290
and the accessory packs or larger 
stickers at least to begin with.

309
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:12,740
And I'll post them relatively quickly.
So here's the sticker.

310
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,790
So here's the design principles.
Uh,

311
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,960
we didn't want it to be black,
red and white,

312
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,000
like the antismoking stickers,
you know,

313
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:20,834
because that just seemed a bit much.
So we decided to make it look kind of 

314
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:25,130
peaceful and playful and you know,
it's,

315
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,700
it's green and purple and,
um,

316
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,890
it's not an,
it's not in an,

317
00:15:29,891 --> 00:15:30,724
in your face sort of thing.
And this doesn't have to be an in your 

318
00:15:32,451 --> 00:15:33,284
face sort of thing.
And so I liked the design and some of 

319
00:15:35,391 --> 00:15:37,030
the people who are advising and helping 
me.

320
00:15:37,031 --> 00:15:37,864
I've been working on that.
So that's what the PC stickers look 

321
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:41,324
like.
There are two inches by two inches and 

322
00:15:42,831 --> 00:15:43,664
we've designed them well.
I'll continue with the rules of the 

323
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,540
Pokemon pc game.

324
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,570
Okay,
so there's just starter packs there.

325
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,430
Ebay item one,
two,

326
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:57,431
(216) 702-3413 all of course post that 
on the,

327
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,500
on this youtube website there's a 
Snipley,

328
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,360
uh,
like it's like a bitly,

329
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:05,090
you a url for,
for that particular item.

330
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,160
The hundred sticker item is one,
two,

331
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:07,994
(216) 700-1902.
So you can buy 50 sticker packs or a 

332
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,990
hundred sticker packs and then you can 
start using them to play pc pokemon.

333
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:19,970
And here are the rules.
First,

334
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:23,420
take your starter pack of 50 to 100 
stickers to school or work.

335
00:16:23,421 --> 00:16:24,254
It can be carried conveniently in a 
backpack or a briefcase or under your 

336
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:29,480
shirt.
If you're a real double o seven type,

337
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,950
then wander the halls of your 
institution or workplace,

338
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,030
be stealth,
healthful.

339
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,540
And if you need to whistle nonchalantly 
so that people don't know what you're up

340
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:39,374
to,
you lose points if you get caught too 

341
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:41,780
early in the game.

342
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,750
Pay careful attention while you're doing
this.

343
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,840
And I would say always pay careful 
attention.

344
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,240
So this is the eye of horus,
by the way.

345
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:51,074
It's an old Egyptian God and the 
Egyptians worshiped at 10 attention as 

346
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:57,530
their highest daddy.
They regarded the careful attention that

347
00:16:57,531 --> 00:17:02,240
individuals paid as the antidote to the 
corruption in stagnation of the state.

348
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,950
So horace was an open eyed God who 
rescued his father from the underworld.

349
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:07,784
And so he's the god of attention.
And I guess I could think about him as 

350
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:13,940
the patron saint of the PC pokemon 
movement.

351
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,153
Okay,
then now you're in your institution or 

352
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:17,954
your workplace or your school and you're
wandering around and you're looking for 

353
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:21,044
posters that advertise the PC game.
Now to describe what the PC game is so 

354
00:17:24,261 --> 00:17:25,094
you can use your judgment about what 
posters are designed to support that 

355
00:17:27,891 --> 00:17:29,720
game.
And I would say do it carefully.

356
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,740
You know,
think about it.

357
00:17:30,741 --> 00:17:31,574
And don't just put the stickers 
everywhere because that reduces their 

358
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,780
utility.
Look at a poster.

359
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:36,614
Think if you think,
think and considered to see if it is 

360
00:17:39,471 --> 00:17:41,570
playing the game that I described it.
And if it is,

361
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,433
then stealthily remove one of your 
Pokemon pc stickers from your starter 

362
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:48,290
pack.
Remove the backing.

363
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,423
If you need eye protection while you're 
doing that because you're concerned 

364
00:17:51,601 --> 00:17:53,400
about the danger,
make sure that you wear it,

365
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,570
handled the sticker reverently then 
strike like the Cobra.

366
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,900
That's the sticker Cobra by the way.
Um,

367
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:01,763
and I found this guy on the right here,
Mano Mano is a Canadian Hero Mono the 

368
00:18:05,971 --> 00:18:08,670
Air Cobra.
So I guess he could be another,

369
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,470
he's our patron superhero,
I guess.

370
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:13,710
Mono the Air Cobra.
So you strike like mono the Air Cobra.

371
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,870
Canadian superheroes by the way,
are pretty rare.

372
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,303
So,
uh,

373
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,040
uh,
it's hard.

374
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,063
All right,
so take your pokemon pc sticker and 

375
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,000
carefully place it on the lower right 
side of the poster.

376
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:30,870
I've put an example down here.
You can see there's an example of proper

377
00:18:30,871 --> 00:18:32,310
placement,
um,

378
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,203
right there.
Put the PC sticker on the lower right 

379
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:37,800
part of the PC game poster.
Be a little subtle.

380
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:38,634
Okay.
Don't stick it.

381
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,620
Obviously in bone headedly in the 
middle,

382
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,970
you want to let the PC game poster 
continue to broadcast it's evil message,

383
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,013
but you want to register your opposition
and more importantly you want to show 

384
00:18:48,151 --> 00:18:49,980
that someone's paying attention,
okay?

385
00:18:49,981 --> 00:18:52,950
Because we need to show that people are 
paying attention to this sort of things.

386
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,263
I don't think that people who are 
playing these games are particularly 

387
00:18:55,861 --> 00:18:58,860
brave and so I think if proper attention
is called to what they're doing,

388
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,220
they might wander back into the darkness
that initially spawned them.

389
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,370
All right.
The next thing you do,

390
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:06,204
I would like you to do is photograph.
Use your cell phone to photograph the 

391
00:19:08,701 --> 00:19:12,660
newly modified poster and then I want 
you to prepare to upload that photo when

392
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:17,340
what I hope will be the pokemon pc app 
arrives and later in the video I'm going

393
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:18,174
to call for an app designer because I 
would like volunteers to help me design 

394
00:19:21,151 --> 00:19:23,820
an APP that has a certain number of 
features and more features.

395
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:25,860
If you have ideas for more features,
it's welcome.

396
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:28,620
So I would ask the APP producers to send
me a proposal.

397
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:29,783
Uh,
you could either do it as volunteers or 

398
00:19:30,871 --> 00:19:31,704
you could send me a budget and I'll see 
if I can scrounge up the money to pay 

399
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:36,900
for it.
I can certainly use the whatever revenue

400
00:19:36,901 --> 00:19:37,734
might be generated with the PC,
pokemon pc stickers to generate enough 

401
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,800
revenue maybe to develop the APP.

402
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,780
So there's an example of proper 
placement.

403
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,180
Be Nice and careful.
Stick it on the lower right hand,

404
00:19:48,181 --> 00:19:49,830
right hand side.
Um,

405
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,993
if,
if more than one of you come across the 

406
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:53,034
same poster,
I suppose you could put another sticker 

407
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:57,150
on there beside it that would register a
vote,

408
00:19:57,151 --> 00:19:59,420
but another vote say,
uh,

409
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,290
against the,
the content of that poster.

410
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:05,340
But don't use a bunch of stickers from 
your starter packs on the same poster,

411
00:20:05,341 --> 00:20:07,160
right?
So be subtle and,

412
00:20:07,161 --> 00:20:07,994
and,
and intelligent about all this and 

413
00:20:09,031 --> 00:20:11,850
careful and awake and tough and,
and,

414
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,713
uh,
all of the things that you should be if 

415
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:16,380
you're a good,
well functioning individual.

416
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:17,723
All right.
And then you disappear stealthily into 

417
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:20,910
the night.
Like Zorro.

418
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:21,803
I guess,
or maybe someone else so you can pick 

419
00:20:23,851 --> 00:20:25,340
your stealthily,
disappear or,

420
00:20:25,341 --> 00:20:26,174
and emulate them.
And it's good thing to emulate people 

421
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,434
that you admire.
And so pick somebody you admire and 

422
00:20:30,091 --> 00:20:32,130
emulate that sucker and that'd be a good
idea.

423
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,300
So then,
then 10 play again with another poster.

424
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,620
Yeah.
And again,

425
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:38,723
and then again and then again and then 
again as long as necessary for years if 

426
00:20:42,811 --> 00:20:44,130
necessary.
All right.

427
00:20:44,131 --> 00:20:45,870
Because this,
this is a long haul.

428
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,083
Uh,
this is a long haul process and this is 

429
00:20:49,271 --> 00:20:51,310
only the starting place as far as I can 
tell.

430
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,373
So I'm going to call for an APP designer
for all you people out there who have 

431
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,110
computer ability.
I,

432
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,953
I'd like you to design a pokemon pc app 
that can be used as a mobile 

433
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:01,444
application.
I would like it to be able to upload 

434
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:03,574
photos of Pokemon pc stickered posters 
and then I want it to link to Google 

435
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:09,880
maps.
I don't know how that might be done.

436
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,103
And what I would like to have happen is 
that we can get a comprehensive library 

437
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:15,184
of pc posters.
So that's why I want you to be very 

438
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:18,304
careful in what you select to sticker.
And that we could also make a map a now 

439
00:21:22,271 --> 00:21:24,430
of the,
of the distribution of these posters,

440
00:21:24,431 --> 00:21:28,780
because then we can find out where the 
layers of the PC game players are.

441
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,170
And then we can go on to the next 
version of Pokemon PC,

442
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,080
which I have to think through and which 
we'll announce later.

443
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:40,350
And so I would say thanks for playing
