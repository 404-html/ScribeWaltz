1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,660
We're going to go through quite a lot of
material today and it's a bit of,

2
00:00:03,661 --> 00:00:05,160
it will be reviewed,
but not very much.

3
00:00:05,161 --> 00:00:05,994
Okay.
So we started with this fundamental 

4
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:08,454
propositions here that you're viewing 
the world through a narrative framework 

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,500
and the narrative framework basically 
lays out the world for you as a place in

6
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:17,334
which you can act.
And the reason that you act is to make 

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,993
the state that you're in currently,
that that state that you're moving to 

8
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:26,130
next better than the state you're in 
now.

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,263
Now,
part of the reason that I had you write 

10
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:34,011
about your past was because the early 
cognitive scientists sort of took it for

11
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:39,090
granted that your model of where you are
now wasn't actually a model.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:39,953
It was just reality.
Cause you look out in the world and you 

13
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:42,534
can see the reality and there you are.
But that's not true because because 

14
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:48,540
you're,
you're,

15
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,523
you're as constrained with regards to 
the information that you have at hand 

16
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,440
about the present just as much as you 
are about the future or the past,

17
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,530
then you're,
your conceptualization of the present is

18
00:01:01,531 --> 00:01:02,730
also a model.

19
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,580
Just like your conceptualization of the 
future.

20
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:06,414
And the reason that's so important to 
know is that if when you're moving from 

21
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:12,000
point a to point b,
you make an error.

22
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:13,943
The error could be that you've predicted
the future or construed the future 

23
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:18,234
inaccurately.
But it could also be that you've 

24
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:22,710
construed the present or the past 
inaccurately.

25
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:23,843
And what that means is that you didn't 
start from where you thought you were 

26
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:27,600
starting.
You know,

27
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:29,280
and,
and that happens for example,

28
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:30,114
that'll happen if you're moving forward 
and you discovered that you have 

29
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:33,654
weaknesses of one form or another that 
you didn't know about when you made the 

30
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:40,040
original plan.
And that what that means is that your,

31
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:40,933
your current conception of yourself is 
sufficiently inaccurate so that you 

32
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:49,341
can't move from that conception to the 
future desired state without error.

33
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,573
And the other reason I'm telling you 
that is because one of what that also 

34
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:54,114
helps you understand is how broad the 
domain of potential error is when 

35
00:01:57,841 --> 00:01:59,760
something you don't understand happens.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,833
Because not only does it throw the 
future that you're conceptualizing into 

37
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:05,034
doubt,
it also throws the conceptualization of 

38
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:10,350
you as a being in the present into 
doubt.

39
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,483
And it's not obvious at all when you do 
the initial search where in which of 

40
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:19,290
those domains you're going to find the 
error or where.

41
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,510
And so it's error is a more complex 
problem than the,

42
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,980
than the cognitive scientists who are 
interested in the comparitor models of,

43
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,083
of cybernetic processing had an had ever
conceptualized cause they thought they 

44
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:34,584
kind of thought and behavior his terms,
which is while the world just presents 

45
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:38,334
itself to you as it is,
so you're not going to be making any 

46
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:41,694
errors of fundamental perception.
You just might be making areas of 

47
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:46,710
prediction,
but that's far too optimistic.

48
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,330
Now we also know that this fundamental 
narrative framework,

49
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,003
which gives you a sense of the value of 
your current position and a destination 

50
00:02:56,491 --> 00:02:58,770
because you're a mom,
you're a moving creature,

51
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,753
you're an active living creature that's 
interacting with the world and 

52
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:03,820
transforming it all the time.

53
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,310
Um,
there's also,

54
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,263
there are also constraints on which the 
narrative that you were going to 

55
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,740
conceptualize an act out can exist and 
the constraints are,

56
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,980
well they're piaget Yeti and constraints
in some sense.

57
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,240
Whatever it is that you're doing has to 
support you while you're doing it.

58
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,590
That's constraint number one.
And that means that you're,

59
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,463
you're,
the path you take has to fulfill 

60
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,293
whatever constitute the list of 
necessities that you can't move forward 

61
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:39,604
without.
And some of those we think of as basic 

62
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:44,020
needs.
Like you have to breathe and you have to

63
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:44,854
eat and you have to have sufficient,
you have to have sufficient water and 

64
00:03:48,601 --> 00:03:50,440
you have to have shelter and all those 
things.

65
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:51,191
And there's a,
you know,

66
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:55,660
the parameters within which those needs 
can be fulfilled are pretty broad,

67
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:56,494
but you know,
so you can't think of it necessarily as 

68
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,603
a simple problem or,
or that there are simple solutions but 

69
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,413
they're still obvious constraints.
And not only do you have to fulfill all 

70
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:08,134
those

71
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,980
fundamental obligations to yourself,
but you have to do it in a manner that's

72
00:04:12,981 --> 00:04:16,880
relatively non contradictory so that 
while you're pursuing one,

73
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:17,714
it doesn't decrease.
The chance that you're going to obtain 

74
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:20,114
another and you have to do it in a way 
that the way you do it now doesn't 

75
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:29,060
compromise you doing it next week or 
next month or next year.

76
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,610
That's where delay of gratification 
comes in.

77
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,773
And then you also have to do it in a way
that fulfills your basic needs in a non 

78
00:04:36,621 --> 00:04:37,454
contradictory manner over different 
spans of time and space while other 

79
00:04:41,301 --> 00:04:44,210
people are doing the same thing.
And so you think,

80
00:04:44,211 --> 00:04:46,670
see that's a very,
very tight set of constraints.

81
00:04:46,671 --> 00:04:47,504
And so the idea that that this narrative
could be anything is wrong because it 

82
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,213
it,
it has to serve many masters 

83
00:04:56,241 --> 00:05:00,050
simultaneously.
And I'm not saying there aren't multiple

84
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:00,884
solutions to that,
just like there are multiple ways of 

85
00:05:03,351 --> 00:05:04,184
playing or winning a game,
but it's a constrained set of 

86
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,390
possibilities.
So okay,

87
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:17,210
now the next proposition is that when 
you're moving from point a to point b,

88
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:22,130
there's basically there's two or three 
classes of things that can happen.

89
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,263
One is things that you don't want to 
have happen and that obviously is 

90
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,500
symbolically represented by the little 
blue unhappy face.

91
00:05:30,501 --> 00:05:31,334
And then there are positive things that 
can happen and the positive things are 

92
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:35,384
two fold in nature.
They have two fundamental elements and 

93
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,124
behaviorists never tell you this.
So it's one of the fundamental flaws in 

94
00:05:43,431 --> 00:05:44,300
behavioral theory.

95
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:50,410
Things that indicate that you're moving 
towards a desired goal are positive.

96
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,270
That's classic sophisticated behavioral 
theory.

97
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:59,570
Those are incentive rewards because an 
incentive reward indicates to you that a

98
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,423
consumer story reward is forthcoming and
there are different neuro biological 

99
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,750
systems that underlie those two types of
reward.

100
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,320
Conservatory reward basically produces 
satisfaction,

101
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,440
whereas incentive reward produces 
excitement,

102
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:14,030
hope,
and movement forward.

103
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,060
And it's actually the kind of reward 
that you liked better,

104
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:18,170
which is weird,
you know,

105
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,730
because you'd think that the most potent
reward would be consumed matory reward.

106
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,000
But people will work harder for 
incentive reward,

107
00:06:26,001 --> 00:06:28,430
then they will for consumer Tory reward.
And that's,

108
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:32,810
that's one of the things that makes 
people very peculiar creatures.

109
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:33,644
And I think part of the reason for that 
is that the incentive reward system is 

110
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:42,020
part of the broader seeking system as 
Jaak Panksepp describes it.

111
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:47,021
And so because the incentive reward 
system not only tells you that a reward,

112
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,990
like an expected reward might be 
forthcoming,

113
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:56,750
it also tells you that an unexpected 
reward might be forthcoming.

114
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,790
And the reason that's so important is 
because you actually view the world that

115
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:06,530
you don't understand partly through the 
lens of threat because of something that

116
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:09,620
you don't understand happens.
It might be dangerous,

117
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,260
but also through the lens of 
possibility.

118
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:14,360
Because if something you don't 
understand happens,

119
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,870
that means there's an indeterminate 
probability of reward.

120
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,810
And like these things turn out to be 
extremely important.

121
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:21,644
So for example,
if you're in a long term sexual 

122
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:24,644
relationship with a person,
the degree to which that relationship 

123
00:07:28,521 --> 00:07:31,100
might be sexually pleasurable will 
decline.

124
00:07:31,101 --> 00:07:31,934
And they're part of the reason for that 
is that there's the novelty disappears 

125
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,260
because novelty enhances incentive 
reward.

126
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:40,094
And so one of the things that you can do
to maintain the romance in a 

127
00:07:43,401 --> 00:07:44,234
relationship is to mix some novelty.
And however you might be able to do 

128
00:07:48,441 --> 00:07:50,810
that.
And that usually involves playing in one

129
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:53,180
form or another in a certain amount of 
creativity.

130
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,570
So it's not a trivial issue.
It's an important issue.

131
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,913
So anyways,
when when you're moving forward and you 

132
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:04,400
encounter something that indicates that 
you're going to achieve your goal,

133
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,503
the other thing that's happening at the 
same time is that the fact that that 

134
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:12,620
thing appears,
validates your entire perceptual scheme.

135
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,690
Right?
So a,

136
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:17,180
you're moving forward to the goal,
but b,

137
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,343
the whole plan that you're using to 
construe the world in order so that you 

138
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:25,490
can act so that you can move towards the
goal is also sufficiently.

139
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:26,324
Right.
And that's a big source of incentive 

140
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:32,501
reward.
Not only your conception of the present,

141
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,880
but the whole framework itself.
Your conception of the present,

142
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,840
the future and your choice about what 
behaviors to implement.

143
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,550
Yeah.
Yeah.

144
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,393
Okay.
I'm imagining you're in a relationship 

145
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,053
with young children or if your goal is 
to be on a fulfilling relationship and 

146
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,223
so to get from where you are to that 
Subaru ordinance involves going through 

147
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:17,070
some daily face might be faces.
So as you move towards your goal,

148
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,470
not always,
you're not always feeling,

149
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,240
oh no,
definitely not.

150
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,283
As you move towards a goal,
things you don't want and things you do 

151
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:28,830
want might be happening and if something
you don't want happens,

152
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,933
then it depends on the,
it depends on the relationship of the 

153
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:39,810
thing that didn't happen to your whole 
goal hierarchy and the problem is,

154
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:43,110
and that's where we're going to go next 
is when the unexpected thing happens.

155
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,320
Unless it's very simple,
which means that it can be modified here

156
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:50,154
and now with very little disruption,
then it has an incalculable effect on 

157
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:55,854
the integrity of the entire plant and 
that's that's why unexpected things in 

158
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:00,864
particular are a class of their own.
Now it's complicated a because normally 

159
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,010
when you're moving towards a goal,
if any obstacle appears,

160
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,873
it's unexpected obviously because partly
what you're trying to do when you lay 

161
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:16,674
out a good plan is to make sure that the
pathway doesn't have any obstacles in 

162
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:22,710
it,
so you almost never encounter,

163
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:23,544
just like you never encounter an 
incentive reward without also 

164
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:30,240
encountering a piece of evidence that 
your plan is good.

165
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:31,823
You never encounter an obstacle without 
also encountering evidence that your 

166
00:10:35,341 --> 00:10:38,460
plan is flawed.
And then the question is,

167
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,840
well,
how flawed?

168
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:40,973
And that's the big question.
And that's why there's a third category 

169
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:46,800
of events that occur as you're laying 
your plans,

170
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,173
as you're,
as you're laying your plans out in the 

171
00:10:49,321 --> 00:10:50,154
world and implementing them.
And that category is things you didn't 

172
00:10:53,671 --> 00:10:56,190
expect.
So not merely obstacles,

173
00:10:56,191 --> 00:10:57,024
but there things you didn't expect.
So now that's what this diagram 

174
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:02,634
basically indicates.
So as you're moving from the unbearable 

175
00:11:05,311 --> 00:11:07,410
present,
it's unbearable because you want to make

176
00:11:07,411 --> 00:11:08,244
it better,
which is also something to think about 

177
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:13,470
when you're considering why human beings
are constantly dissatisfied.

178
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,311
It's like,
well,

179
00:11:14,311 --> 00:11:17,790
if you weren't vaguely dissatisfied with
the present,

180
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,240
you wouldn't be doing anything to try to
change it into the future.

181
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:22,074
And so there's a certain amount of vague
that dissatisfaction that's actually a 

182
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,030
necessary motivator.

183
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,953
Now you know,
you hope that there are times when you 

184
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:32,610
think things are good enough for right 
now.

185
00:11:32,611 --> 00:11:35,370
So you can take a break from constantly 
walking up hill.

186
00:11:35,371 --> 00:11:40,320
But you can also see that if you were 
completely satisfied,

187
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:42,570
we know this from,
from animals like lions,

188
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:43,404
you know after a kill,
all the lions do is lay around until 

189
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:47,520
they've digested all the food.
You know,

190
00:11:47,521 --> 00:11:48,354
and they're probably satisfied.
But it isn't obviously the case that 

191
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,193
that's the best possible.
So as you're moving from the unbearable 

192
00:11:56,921 --> 00:11:57,754
present to the desired future,
you can think that positive things 

193
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:02,044
happen.
So those facilitate your movement 

194
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:04,834
forward and negative things happen and 
that interferes with your movement 

195
00:12:08,471 --> 00:12:11,770
forward.
Or you can think differently.

196
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:12,604
You can,
which is a slight reconceptualization 

197
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:18,640
you can say that predicted things happen
and that unpredicted things happen.

198
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,240
So that's a,
that's a slightly different shift,

199
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,074
right?

200
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,740
Because when you talk about unexpected,
unexpected,

201
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:31,450
obviously you're not referring to 
something that's only a manifestation in

202
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:32,284
the actual world.
It's also a relationship that you have 

203
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:35,614
with the thing in the world.
Because expected means not only does it 

204
00:12:38,981 --> 00:12:41,380
happen,
but you knew it was going to happen.

205
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:43,450
Whereas unexpected means not only does 
it happen,

206
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:46,330
but you didn't know.
So there's a subjective element and then

207
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:48,280
you could change that another way too.
Because,

208
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,533
and this is,
I think the most accurate way to think 

209
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:51,934
about it,
which is it's not expected and 

210
00:12:55,061 --> 00:12:55,894
unexpected.
It's desired an undesired and there the 

211
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:02,920
utility and making that transformation 
is,

212
00:13:02,921 --> 00:13:03,754
it brings motivation into the picture.
You're never only expecting or not 

213
00:13:08,321 --> 00:13:11,650
expecting,
you're wanting and not want.

214
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:12,843
Yup.

215
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:16,803
Huh?

216
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,920
Yes.
Sort of.

217
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,940
If you lay out a good plan,
you may say,

218
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:28,893
well,
here's 10 things that I don't want to 

219
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:33,760
have happen that are relatively high 
probability,

220
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,120
and then you could build a little sub 
plan around each of those.

221
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,330
That constitutes a micro strategy within
the plant.

222
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,493
But the way to,
the way to conceptualize that 

223
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,110
effectively is to think about this.
This isn't,

224
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,153
you don't have that plan ever.
You have a nested series of plants and 

225
00:13:53,261 --> 00:13:56,710
you're operating at one level of that 
nested series out of time.

226
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,110
Now,
if the,

227
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:03,910
if the expected and if it's an expected 
undesirable thing,

228
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,130
it usually affects a micro element of 
the plan.

229
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,163
Right?
And so that you can change that and fix 

230
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:12,880
it without too much effort.
If it's a macro element,

231
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,170
you know,
let's say,

232
00:14:15,171 --> 00:14:16,330
uh,
okay,

233
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,120
you fail a course.
That's one thing.

234
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,130
Another thing is,
uh,

235
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,083
east European cyber criminals hijack 
your hard drive and encode it and they 

236
00:14:27,581 --> 00:14:28,414
charge you $10,000
to decode it and then you don't have 

237
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:32,500
enough money to go to university.

238
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:33,851
It's like,
okay,

239
00:14:33,851 --> 00:14:37,060
well,
which of those events is more serious?

240
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,433
Well,
obviously failing the exam is not a 

241
00:14:40,841 --> 00:14:42,760
positive event.
It's a,

242
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:47,350
it's a somewhat unexpected event.
Likely if you were doing the work,

243
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,200
but it doesn't blow apart your entire 
plan.

244
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,330
Whereas the,
the,

245
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,760
the theft of all your resources is a 
macro failure.

246
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,283
Not only do you,
are you not getting from point a to 

247
00:14:58,881 --> 00:14:59,714
point B,
but the framework within which you're 

248
00:15:02,871 --> 00:15:07,070
conceptualizing point a and B is wrong,
but it might even be worse than that.

249
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:12,290
It's a super ordinate framework that 
blows apart 10 or 11 different plants.

250
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,813
So it's that it's complicated because 
things are never only predicted and an 

251
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,493
unpredicted,
their desired and undesired and then 

252
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,580
their desired and undesired to different
degrees.

253
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,170
And the degree depends on the place in 
the hierarchy where the unexpected thing

254
00:15:27,171 --> 00:15:29,270
is doing the disruption.
So,

255
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:30,104
but there's no way of getting towards 
that level of description without 

256
00:15:33,441 --> 00:15:37,190
starting off as if you're only 
implementing one plan at a time.

257
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,683
So this is,
this is an oversimplification that's 

258
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:44,990
necessary before we develop a 
sophisticated idea of,

259
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,330
of how it is that you're interacting 
with the world.

260
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,810
Okay.
So a desired outcome,

261
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,483
that's an incentive reward.
It makes you hopeful and positive and 

262
00:15:56,991 --> 00:16:00,620
alert and energetic and willing to move 
forward.

263
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:03,260
And it's what you want.
It's what you want.

264
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:05,750
It's a dopaminergic reaction 
fundamentally.

265
00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:09,890
Whereas if something that you happened 
that happens that you don't want,

266
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:14,260
well that's both threatening technically
because you,

267
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,253
it indicates that a punishment is likely
and you don't necessarily know the 

268
00:16:19,071 --> 00:16:19,904
magnitude of the punishment.
And it's also punishing in and of 

269
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,530
itself.
So those are,

270
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,310
that's obviously a category that you 
don't want to have happen.

271
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,950
And the other problem is it's not easy 
to bind it,

272
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,840
you know?
So look at it this way,

273
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:38,030
you have a relationship with someone and
it's kind of conflict laid,

274
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,703
you know,
and you think each time you have a 

275
00:16:41,091 --> 00:16:42,290
conflict,
do you think,

276
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,290
should I be in this relationship?

277
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,573
Well that's a big problem because you 
actually don't know how much conflict 

278
00:16:50,421 --> 00:16:53,900
should you have before you shouldn't be 
in a relationship.

279
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:59,660
And an answer to that is while you don't
know now there's actually some empirical

280
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:02,750
work on the topic so I can give you a 
provisional answer,

281
00:17:02,751 --> 00:17:07,080
which is quite interesting.
So there was a a research psychologist a

282
00:17:07,081 --> 00:17:07,914
while back who I thought I did a 
brilliant study and they had couples 

283
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:14,510
record positive events.
Just qualitatively,

284
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:15,344
how many positive interactions did you 
have with your partner during the day 

285
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:22,880
versus how many negative interactions?
I don't think they quantified the degree

286
00:17:22,881 --> 00:17:24,590
to which they were positive and 
negative.

287
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:29,150
They're just going to assume that across
multiple instances that would wash out.

288
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,283
And what they found was it's quite cool.
They found that if you had fewer than 

289
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:38,150
five positive interactions to every 
negative interaction,

290
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:41,630
the relationship was going to collapse.

291
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,410
So now you can start counting and see if
that's appropriate to you.

292
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,470
But the other thing they found,
which I thought was really lovely,

293
00:17:48,471 --> 00:17:49,304
was that if you had more than 11 
positive interactions to one negative 

294
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,770
interaction,
the relationship was also doomed.

295
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,020
And so you think you see,
you understand that,

296
00:17:58,021 --> 00:17:58,471
right?
You'd,

297
00:17:58,471 --> 00:17:59,304
everyone knows that because if someone's
wondering around treating you like a 

298
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:03,090
goddess,
regardless,

299
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:03,924
the first thing you're going to do is be
just contemptuous of them and then 

300
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,373
completely bored.
You want the person to harass you a bit 

301
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,900
just so that you learn something.
That's part of it.

302
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:13,763
So,
but so it's also evidence that there's 

303
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:17,430
actually someone there that you're 
interacting with,

304
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:18,264
you know,
because if someone just does everything 

305
00:18:20,581 --> 00:18:21,750
you want all the time,
well,

306
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:23,910
I mean that might sound like an ideal 
fantasy,

307
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:26,640
but you know perfectly well that if that
ever happened,

308
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:27,983
that's just,
you're just going to get completely 

309
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,280
tired of that instantly.
Plus there's no,

310
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,260
there's no life in the relationship.
Right.

311
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,200
Which is a big issue.
So yes,

312
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:41,410
there's also people who are too afraid 
to pick a fight with one another.

313
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:42,621
Right?
Right.

314
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,330
Arguably worse.
Right.

315
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:44,991
Well,
exactly.

316
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:45,824
Well,
the other thing too is you can be sure 

317
00:18:46,671 --> 00:18:48,830
that didn't have a relationship where 
there's no conflict.

318
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:53,810
Nothing is being decided because thought
is conflict.

319
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,910
Even if you do it by yourself,
you know.

320
00:18:55,911 --> 00:18:56,744
And so if,
if there are two of you in a boat and 

321
00:18:57,951 --> 00:19:00,140
you're trying to decide where you're 
going in the future,

322
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,080
it started like that self evident.
There has to be some,

323
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,053
you have to have an opinion and your 
partner has to have an opinion and 

324
00:19:07,011 --> 00:19:07,844
there's no reason at all to assume that 
those opinions either will be or should 

325
00:19:10,731 --> 00:19:12,830
be the same.
And then you know,

326
00:19:12,831 --> 00:19:13,664
you hope the relationship is solid 
enough so that it can withstand the 

327
00:19:17,391 --> 00:19:18,224
tension of the conflict.
One of the things you've said about 

328
00:19:20,031 --> 00:19:20,864
marriage,
which I thought was because you can get 

329
00:19:22,251 --> 00:19:23,084
a very nice job of trying to understand 
from a psychological perspective why in 

330
00:19:26,961 --> 00:19:28,940
the world you should bother being 
married,

331
00:19:28,941 --> 00:19:31,220
which is really a very interesting 
question.

332
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,630
You know,
and one of the things,

333
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:37,160
one of the things he said was that you 
don't need to tie two things together if

334
00:19:37,161 --> 00:19:39,680
they'll just stay together of their own 
accord.

335
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,440
So the fact that marriage is a,
your human universal,

336
00:19:42,441 --> 00:19:43,274
which it is,
indicates that there is enough tension 

337
00:19:45,531 --> 00:19:48,140
within intimate relationships,
scent,

338
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:50,870
scent,
centrifical tension to blow them apart.

339
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,650
And some of that's just because people 
are different and they clash.

340
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:58,100
But it's also because as you go through 
life in a single boat,

341
00:19:58,101 --> 00:20:00,770
you encounter huge waves and you know 
you might get swamped.

342
00:20:00,771 --> 00:20:01,604
So it's a big problem.
His point was that the marriage vow was 

343
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:09,791
necessary because if you're a response 
to,

344
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:12,963
okay,

345
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:17,200
potential conflict was I can leave,
you can't have the conflict.

346
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:18,780
Okay,

347
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,940
you can't have the conflict.
You know,

348
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:21,571
if,
if,

349
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:22,404
if on the other hand you're with someone
and you think there's no bloody way I 

350
00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:27,900
can get rid of you,
no matter what I do short of murder,

351
00:20:27,901 --> 00:20:30,360
I'm stuck with you for the next 30 
years,

352
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,920
then we better work this out.
And so that makes the,

353
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:39,150
he thought of that as a container within
which a transformation could take place.

354
00:20:39,151 --> 00:20:43,230
It was no chemical motif and that 
without that pressure,

355
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:47,770
people weren't going to be sufficiently 
motivated to really hash out problems.

356
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,990
And you know,
you can think of that,

357
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,093
think of that in whatever way you want.
But I thought it was an absolutely 

358
00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:54,730
brilliant observation.

359
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:00,080
Do you think that divorce is too readily
considered?

360
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,753
Well,
the problem is it doesn't solve the 

361
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,453
problem.
It doesn't solve any problems usually 

362
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:08,103
because for a variety of reasons.
One is it's probably you and not your 

363
00:21:12,341 --> 00:21:15,010
partner anyway,
or at least there's a 50 50 chance,

364
00:21:15,011 --> 00:21:15,844
and if it's you,
you're just going to bring your 

365
00:21:16,481 --> 00:21:19,810
stupidity to the next relationship and 
torture someone else to death,

366
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,390
you know?
So that's a big problem.

367
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,583
The next problem is,
is that if you can't work out the bugs 

368
00:21:25,811 --> 00:21:27,940
in this relationship,
why do you think you're going to be able

369
00:21:27,941 --> 00:21:28,774
to do it in the next relationship?
Especially now that you're older and 

370
00:21:30,761 --> 00:21:33,460
more set in your ways.
The third is,

371
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,690
well,
you know,

372
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,510
what about the kids?
The fourth is,

373
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,380
I don't know if you've ever seen people 
in a protracted custody battle,

374
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:42,783
but if you want to ruin your life,
that's a really good way of doing it 

375
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:45,904
because that'll take you out for about 
15 years and it'll cost you pretty much 

376
00:21:49,301 --> 00:21:52,930
all your money and it'll destroy your,
your closest relationships.

377
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:53,973
And I'll also make it virtually 
impossible for you to be happy with the 

378
00:21:55,931 --> 00:21:56,764
next person that you're with because 
they're going to be burdened by this 

379
00:22:00,011 --> 00:22:00,844
absolute catastrophe that's surrounding 
you with regards to how you organize 

380
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:05,650
your interrelationships with the people 
that you love.

381
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,800
So,
so generally speaking,

382
00:22:08,801 --> 00:22:11,980
I don't think that,
I don't think that it usually solves the

383
00:22:11,981 --> 00:22:12,771
problem.
Now it's,

384
00:22:12,771 --> 00:22:16,000
sometimes it does,
but my sense is it's probably introduced

385
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,460
more problems than it solved.
You know?

386
00:22:18,461 --> 00:22:19,294
So I mean,
one of the things you might know for 

387
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:21,394
example,
is that the only people who now get 

388
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:26,320
married are people who are relatively 
wealthy.

389
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:27,903
You know,
the fact that we've disrupted the 

390
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:34,021
structure of marriage as an institution 
since about 1965 say what that's meant.

391
00:22:34,571 --> 00:22:35,404
What that has meant is that it's,
it's benefits are now only available to 

392
00:22:38,651 --> 00:22:42,310
people who are privileged.
So you can look up the stats yourself,

393
00:22:42,311 --> 00:22:43,144
but if you're middle class and above,
the divorce rates haven't moved much 

394
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:51,331
since the early seventies if you're 
working class and below,

395
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,350
it's a complete catastrophe.

396
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,333
And what that's meant is that most ma,
many children who are in rougher socio 

397
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:00,644
economic straights are being raised by a
single person who has absolutely and 

398
00:23:04,931 --> 00:23:08,830
100% overwhelmed by their multiple 
commitments,

399
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,950
right?
Fulltime responsibility for children and

400
00:23:11,951 --> 00:23:15,310
generally in employment in a 
extraordinarily dismal,

401
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,340
low paying,
unstable and exploitative job.

402
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,590
So to me,
if you,

403
00:23:20,591 --> 00:23:21,424
if you're like you guys are,
you're all going to be middle class or 

404
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:24,730
above in all likelihood,
it's like,

405
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:25,564
it's fine for you.
It's not going to make a bloody bit of 

406
00:23:26,831 --> 00:23:28,300
difference,
all things considered.

407
00:23:28,301 --> 00:23:31,960
But for people who are poor,
it's just been a catastrophe.

408
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,540
So,
okay.

409
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,210
So yes,

410
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:45,970
okay.
There

411
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,080
it's all sorts of reasons.
I mean,

412
00:23:48,081 --> 00:23:50,240
first of all,
it's become socially acceptable,

413
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,673
right?
Divorce wasn't socially acceptable and 

414
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:54,370
you can say,
well that's,

415
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:57,080
that was pretty hard on people who 
wanted to get divorced.

416
00:23:57,081 --> 00:23:57,590
It's like,
yeah,

417
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:01,130
obviously any rule is hard on people 
that break it,

418
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:03,170
but that doesn't mean that there 
shouldn't be rules,

419
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,360
you know,
now what rules there should be.

420
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:07,440
That's a whole different issue.
Um,

421
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,510
out of wedlock childbirth has become a 
norm.

422
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:12,523
It was absolutely rare.
The 19 in the early 1960s vanishingly 

423
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:18,090
rare and that's become,
it's,

424
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,470
it's acceptable.
Even though all the evidence suggests,

425
00:24:21,471 --> 00:24:23,060
like if you actually look at the 
evidence,

426
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:27,740
it's absolutely clear that kids who have
two parents do better than kids who have

427
00:24:27,741 --> 00:24:29,870
one.
Now you know people,

428
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:30,704
when you tell people that,
they will tell you an anecdote about 

429
00:24:32,391 --> 00:24:33,224
someone they knew,
maybe their own parent who did a 

430
00:24:34,341 --> 00:24:37,160
wonderful job of raising them as a 
single person.

431
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,993
It's like the anecdotes are irrelevant.
What's relevant is the bulk of the 

432
00:24:41,181 --> 00:24:42,560
evidence.
Of course,

433
00:24:42,561 --> 00:24:46,310
there are situations where people are 
better apart than together,

434
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,473
and of course there are situations where
one person can do a better job than to 

435
00:24:50,361 --> 00:24:53,090
people who were at each other's throats,
but it's,

436
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:53,924
it's aggregate.
It's aggregated examples that you use 

437
00:24:56,811 --> 00:24:57,644
when you're doing a scientific survey 
and the results of those surveys are 

438
00:24:59,811 --> 00:25:01,460
crystal clear.
You know,

439
00:25:01,461 --> 00:25:05,150
the other thing that's going to happen,
it's going to happen very soon,

440
00:25:05,151 --> 00:25:07,280
is that there's going to be a very,
very,

441
00:25:07,281 --> 00:25:08,114
very,
very large number of elderly people who 

442
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:16,061
are alone and be an elderly and alone 
like no family.

443
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,760
That is not something you want to look 
forward to,

444
00:25:19,761 --> 00:25:20,594
especially when you start thinking that 
you're going to be elderly for like 40 

445
00:25:23,061 --> 00:25:25,220
years.
So you know,

446
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,083
because say say it starts around 65 I 
don't know how long you guys are going 

447
00:25:29,651 --> 00:25:30,484
to live,
but it's probably 95 is not an 

448
00:25:32,301 --> 00:25:35,180
unreasonable estimate and it might be 
longer than that.

449
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:36,763
So because you know,
we're adding about three months to the 

450
00:25:38,481 --> 00:25:42,320
total lifespan every year,
right?

451
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,423
That's the rate of technological 
improvement in relationship to overall 

452
00:25:46,221 --> 00:25:48,230
mortality.
So you know,

453
00:25:48,231 --> 00:25:53,231
and that the degree to which we're 
adding that extra lifespan is increasing

454
00:25:53,721 --> 00:25:55,340
each year.
You know,

455
00:25:55,341 --> 00:25:56,174
and it may hit get to the point where 
we're increasing lifespan a year every 

456
00:25:59,931 --> 00:26:00,950
year.
Now.

457
00:26:00,951 --> 00:26:03,680
I doubt it cause it'll probably,
it'll probably be an essay,

458
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,813
a Sim tote,
but it has been increasing for a very 

459
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:09,470
long period of time.
So,

460
00:26:09,471 --> 00:26:10,304
you know,
it's one thing to think about the 

461
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:13,784
maximization of day to day freedom when 
you're between say 15 and 40 45 after 

462
00:26:21,381 --> 00:26:23,060
that,
that's a whole different story.

463
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,953
And,
but modern people never think about the 

464
00:26:25,161 --> 00:26:27,320
last half of their life.
You know,

465
00:26:27,321 --> 00:26:28,970
so why?
I don't know,

466
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:31,880
but maybe they're afraid to or 
something.

467
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:34,460
But,
okay.

468
00:26:34,461 --> 00:26:37,070
So here's the other way of looking at it
is when you're,

469
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,263
so there's lots of ways of 
conceptualizing what you encountered 

470
00:26:40,511 --> 00:26:41,690
when you move into the world.

471
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,710
So we said,
well,

472
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,730
you know,
there's positive things you encounter,

473
00:26:44,731 --> 00:26:45,564
negative things,
there's expected things and unexpected 

474
00:26:47,251 --> 00:26:48,084
things.
There's desired things and undesired 

475
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:51,750
things.
And another way of thinking about it,

476
00:26:51,751 --> 00:26:55,830
which is more in some sense it's more a 
empirical,

477
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,410
is that you encountered tools and 
obstacles,

478
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,660
right?
And tools move you forward.

479
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,003
And tools are a funny thing because 
they're sort of half objective and half 

480
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:05,330
subject,
right?

481
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:09,120
There are thing,
but the thing is defined by their use.

482
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:13,590
But weirdly enough,
we tend to define thing by use.

483
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,540
You know,
and I mentioned this before,

484
00:27:15,541 --> 00:27:18,480
so most people,
when they're thinking about language,

485
00:27:18,481 --> 00:27:20,850
things that you use words to label 
things,

486
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,193
but it seems much more likely that we 
use categories as tools to act in the 

487
00:27:25,531 --> 00:27:28,050
world.
And so we don't see things,

488
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,520
we see the use of things or the fact 
that they get in our way.

489
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,863
And so you're trying to set up the world
so that what surrounds you are entities 

490
00:27:38,161 --> 00:27:42,480
that you can use to get what you desire 
and to eliminate obstacles.

491
00:27:42,481 --> 00:27:44,490
And in fact,
that's what you generally do if you're a

492
00:27:44,491 --> 00:27:45,540
good manager,
right?

493
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:48,270
A big part of being a good manager is to
first of all,

494
00:27:48,271 --> 00:27:49,104
lay out a plan for people.
That's a hierarchy and and where the 

495
00:27:52,741 --> 00:27:53,574
hierarchical levels don't conflict.
And the second thing is you get rid of 

496
00:27:55,891 --> 00:27:58,350
obstacles for them so that they can come
to you and say,

497
00:27:58,351 --> 00:27:59,184
well,
I can't do this because this isn't the 

498
00:28:00,241 --> 00:28:01,074
way your job is.
To get it out of the way so that they 

499
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:04,580
can move forward.
So on.

500
00:28:04,581 --> 00:28:07,290
It's a very good way of conceptualizing 
yourself as a manager.

501
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,693
So now part of there's obstacles that 
you understand and those would 

502
00:28:12,571 --> 00:28:15,810
correspond to the micro levels of the 
hierarchy,

503
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:16,920
right?

504
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,110
And then there's obstacles that you 
don't understand.

505
00:28:19,111 --> 00:28:21,360
And when they come up,
they just blow apart your whole plant.

506
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,840
So now associated with that expected 
unexpected,

507
00:28:27,091 --> 00:28:31,590
desired undesired tool.
Obstacle is a corollary,

508
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:36,591
which is all the things that you're not 
conceptualizing as tools or obstacles or

509
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:39,750
as things you don't know,
they're irrelevant.

510
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,273
And that's a really useful thing to know
because it means that whenever you're 

511
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:45,474
looking at the world,
it's like the world has a sea of snakes 

512
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,380
and you're only concentrating on one 
snake at a time.

513
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,890
But then if you make a mistake dealing 
with that single snake,

514
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,910
what happens is you're neck deep in 
snakes because all of the things,

515
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,640
the thing is when you make a mistake,
and this is a critical issue,

516
00:29:02,641 --> 00:29:07,140
when you make a mistake and you blow the
framework within which you're construing

517
00:29:07,141 --> 00:29:09,510
the world,
the Framework that narrows it for you,

518
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,733
what happens is that all the things that
you've been ignoring become potentially 

519
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:15,414
relevant.

520
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:16,703
And that's overwhelming.
And that's partly why your body reacts 

521
00:29:20,131 --> 00:29:23,520
as if it's under tremendous stress.
So for example,

522
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,770
you know how these things work.
And again,

523
00:29:25,771 --> 00:29:27,480
I think betrayals,
the best example,

524
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:32,690
if you have a partner and they be trey,
you then all the things that you thought

525
00:29:33,181 --> 00:29:34,014
were true about the mart and all those 
things you ignored as irrelevant turned 

526
00:29:37,441 --> 00:29:39,960
out not to be irrelevant at all.
So you know,

527
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:40,794
maybe the person told on a twice weekly 
basis that they were too busy studying 

528
00:29:44,621 --> 00:29:46,810
to spend any time with you.
And you know,

529
00:29:46,811 --> 00:29:47,644
you just put that down into the 
irrelevant zone after some coming to 

530
00:29:52,331 --> 00:29:54,040
terms with it.
And then you find out,

531
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,730
well that isn't what they were doing 
during that time.

532
00:29:57,731 --> 00:29:59,500
And then the next question is,
well,

533
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,410
what else did they tell you?
That wasn't the way it was.

534
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:05,110
And the answer to that is,
could it be anything?

535
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:08,620
It means every single thing about your 
relationship past,

536
00:30:08,621 --> 00:30:13,360
present and future has now been cast 
into the realm of potential relevance.

537
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,370
And almost all the relevance is 
negative.

538
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,653
And that's the descent into chaos.
So that's the best way to conceptualize 

539
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:21,124
chaos is because what happens is that 
your plan is what's narrows the world 

540
00:30:25,181 --> 00:30:27,970
for you and constrains that makes most 
of it irrelevant.

541
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,490
The parts that aren't relevant,
positive,

542
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,040
and the negative elements,
relatively rare.

543
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:35,770
That's what the intact hierarchical plan
does.

544
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:36,903
If you blow the hierarchical plan,
then all your nice little subdivisions 

545
00:30:40,151 --> 00:30:43,600
are now irrelevant and every little 
monster comes up to face you.

546
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:46,540
And that's the descent into the 
underworld.

547
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,330
Right.
And people do not like that.

548
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,253
And no wonder the reason they don't like
that is because it places them in a 

549
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:58,651
situation that's so complex that it 
could easily exceed their resources,

550
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:00,400
you know?

551
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,233
And so for example,
one of the things that happens to 

552
00:31:02,381 --> 00:31:05,530
elderly people sometimes this isn't 
precisely of betrayal,

553
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:06,364
is you know,
they've been with someone for 40 years 

554
00:31:08,081 --> 00:31:12,250
and the person dies while the 
probability that the partner will die in

555
00:31:12,251 --> 00:31:16,660
the following year is much elevated 
compared to their normal mortality.

556
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:21,070
And part of that is they just,
it's not that they're grieving.

557
00:31:21,071 --> 00:31:23,290
Exactly.
Although they are.

558
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,993
What's happened is that one of the 
fundamental axioms of the structures 

559
00:31:29,141 --> 00:31:29,974
that they use to encapsulate the world 
has been blown out and everything comes 

560
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:35,914
crashing down.
And so sometimes people just don't have 

561
00:31:39,251 --> 00:31:42,100
the resources to make it through that 
they're just done.

562
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,503
You know,
they don't know how to pick up the 

563
00:31:44,621 --> 00:31:46,480
pieces and start again.
You know?

564
00:31:46,481 --> 00:31:49,990
And at some point,
maybe God only knows at some point,

565
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:50,824
maybe that's not what you do.
Like I don't know what you do after 

566
00:31:53,051 --> 00:31:55,540
you're married 75 years and your partner
dies.

567
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,613
I mean,
maybe you have a party if it's been an 

568
00:31:57,551 --> 00:31:59,170
absolutely dreadful marriage,
but,

569
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,600
but in all likelihood,
you know,

570
00:32:01,601 --> 00:32:02,560
it's,
it's,

571
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:06,340
it's like a stroke that leaves you with 
only half your body.

572
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,440
It's not clear that you can recover from
it.

573
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,753
So,

574
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:14,883
oh,

575
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,090
that's a good question.
But I would say what,

576
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:23,660
I don't think it's exactly from the 
breaking of the framework.

577
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:24,763
I think what happens is that the 
framework breaks and then the person is 

578
00:32:27,741 --> 00:32:28,574
cast into such a state of physiological 
shock that the shark actually starts to 

579
00:32:33,561 --> 00:32:34,394
destroy them.
So like if I stress you enough for a 

580
00:32:37,461 --> 00:32:40,670
reasonable length of time,
you're going to blow out at your weakest

581
00:32:40,671 --> 00:32:42,800
point.
And that's a nice way to think about the

582
00:32:42,801 --> 00:32:45,110
genetics of pathology of 
psychopathology.

583
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:48,470
It's like everybody has a weakest point.
You know?

584
00:32:48,471 --> 00:32:51,020
It's like if you blow up a balloon 
enough,

585
00:32:51,021 --> 00:32:53,030
then it's going to blow out where it's 
the weakest.

586
00:32:53,031 --> 00:32:55,580
Well,
every one of you has a weak point.

587
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,533
You know,
some of you will have a threshold for 

588
00:32:58,341 --> 00:32:59,174
that weakness that's lower than others,
but generally if I push hard enough on 

589
00:33:03,081 --> 00:33:04,430
you,
you're going to,

590
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:05,720
something's going to happen.

591
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,553
You're going to,
you're going to get hypoglycemic and 

592
00:33:08,031 --> 00:33:08,864
then you're going to eat too much and 
then you're going to become obese or 

593
00:33:10,371 --> 00:33:11,204
you're going to turn to alcohol because 
it's a really useful antianxiety agent 

594
00:33:14,091 --> 00:33:15,550
for you.
Or you know,

595
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,393
you're going to develop some kind of 
other stress related illness may be 

596
00:33:18,321 --> 00:33:19,154
diabetes or you know,
you're going to develop an anxiety 

597
00:33:21,081 --> 00:33:21,914
disorder post traumatic stress disorder,
or maybe if you have a family history 

598
00:33:25,221 --> 00:33:26,054
towards psychosis,
you're going to develop delusions and 

599
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,710
paranoia.
It depends on,

600
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,730
it depends fundamentally on exactly 
where,

601
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,920
where,
where your most flawed in your,

602
00:33:36,921 --> 00:33:37,754
in your psychophysiological makeup.
I don't think you can necessarily 

603
00:33:40,791 --> 00:33:41,624
predict how that's going to happen.
Although you can sometimes if somebody 

604
00:33:44,721 --> 00:33:47,120
has a loaded family history,
you know,

605
00:33:47,121 --> 00:33:51,440
and even with with with uh,
illnesses like schizophrenia,

606
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,860
the standard models are always stress 
dye thesis.

607
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:55,963
There's a preexisting vulnerability 
which will not necessarily manifest 

608
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:02,090
itself unless the person is put under 
pressure.

609
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:05,330
You know,
and it's interesting to think we tend to

610
00:34:05,331 --> 00:34:08,960
think about stress in some sense as a 
psychological phenomenon,

611
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:11,270
but it's not really a psychological 
phenomena.

612
00:34:11,271 --> 00:34:16,271
Often even though it is related to the 
way in which you construe the world,

613
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:19,303
the complexity of the world is what 
stresses people that hasn't 

614
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:25,340
psychological cause the world is 
complex.

615
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,400
The psychological element is well are 
your,

616
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:33,410
is your tool kit kit generally adequate 
to deal with that complexity?

617
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,650
And some of that has to do with 
subjective factors,

618
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:37,843
you know,
and some of it has to do with familial 

619
00:34:38,751 --> 00:34:40,040
and social factors.
So,

620
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,453
okay.
So I've considered construed a normally 

621
00:34:48,971 --> 00:34:52,570
as normal or revolutionary using Thomas 
Kuhn's terms.

622
00:34:52,571 --> 00:34:53,404
And a normal bit of a normally is one 
that you can deal with without blowing 

623
00:34:56,381 --> 00:34:59,080
the framework within which you're 
working and so on.

624
00:34:59,081 --> 00:34:59,914
I hope everyone understands this.
I know I've gone over it a couple of 

625
00:35:01,691 --> 00:35:02,360
times,
but it's,

626
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,193
it's a very critical issue.
Does it make sense that the anomaly is 

627
00:35:07,361 --> 00:35:12,361
normal if it only disrupts subsidiary 
elements of the plant?

628
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,820
Is,
is everyone clear about what that means?

629
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,513
Yes.

630
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:31,230
There's a spectrum because there's a 
hierarchy and we'll,

631
00:35:31,231 --> 00:35:34,430
we'll look at the hierarchy again,
but the idea is that the,

632
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,450
the,
the stress,

633
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,333
the stress of the normally is 
proportionate to its position in the 

634
00:35:41,401 --> 00:35:42,234
hierarchy of plants.
The most stressful and normally blows 

635
00:35:44,761 --> 00:35:47,400
out your top level plan.
That's it.

636
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:50,100
That's,
that's a near death experience.

637
00:35:50,101 --> 00:35:52,310
It means everything that you hold.
That would,

638
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,283
I would be what would happen if the 
economy collapsed and your family was 

639
00:35:56,161 --> 00:36:00,630
killed in a car accident and your 
partner left you on the same day.

640
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:01,523
It would be something like that.
It's like the bottom drops out of 

641
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:05,490
absolutely everything,
you know?

642
00:36:05,491 --> 00:36:07,260
And that does happen to people now and 
then.

643
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:10,770
And we know what happens to people in 
situations like that,

644
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,230
depending on their level of resiliency 
because that,

645
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,123
that is another issue.
But one of the most common precipitants 

646
00:36:17,611 --> 00:36:21,240
of severe depression is unemployment.
You know when you might say,

647
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:22,800
well,
is that psychological?

648
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:23,783
It's like,

649
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,070
no.
I would say not really.

650
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:29,923
There's a psychological element in that 
you might not be as well prepared for 

651
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:37,730
about of an unemployment as you could 
conceivably be.

652
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:38,803
But if I have someone in my,
as a client who's depressed and 

653
00:36:41,661 --> 00:36:42,494
unemployed,
what I try to do is treat the 

654
00:36:44,511 --> 00:36:46,160
unemployment,
not the depression,

655
00:36:46,161 --> 00:36:47,840
because what the hell are they going to 
do?

656
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,360
You know?
How can you not be depressed when you're

657
00:36:50,361 --> 00:36:51,194
looking at a narrow way,
a world of narrowing opportunities 

658
00:36:53,631 --> 00:36:56,210
followed by losing your house and ending
up on the street.

659
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,073
It's like that's,
it's not exactly a psychological 

660
00:36:59,151 --> 00:36:59,984
problem.

661
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:10,250
Better limit.
How do you bring those levels?

662
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:11,891
Yeah.
Well,

663
00:37:11,891 --> 00:37:12,724
I mean one of the thing is it's like,
it's like being able to move on your 

664
00:37:15,161 --> 00:37:16,300
feet.
So let's say,

665
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:18,480
well,
let's say you want to have your,

666
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,550
the first question is,
can you have a meaningful life,

667
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,653
right?
Because we're going to start from the 

668
00:37:23,171 --> 00:37:28,060
proposition that unvarnished life is 
very dismal and dreadful,

669
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:29,500
right?
So if you're not prepared for it,

670
00:37:29,501 --> 00:37:32,110
we'll just grind you up and that will be
very painful.

671
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,273
Okay?
So we're going to use that as a 

672
00:37:33,581 --> 00:37:34,414
baseline.
The baseline isn't that you're going to 

673
00:37:35,651 --> 00:37:39,280
be secure and happy.
The baseline is there isn't much of you.

674
00:37:39,281 --> 00:37:41,860
You're very fragile and things will 
grind you into nothing.

675
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,660
That's a Buddhist stance,
right?

676
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:47,830
Cause the Buddhists say first dictum of 
Buddhism is life is suffering.

677
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,590
The first dictum isn't that life is 
happy.

678
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:54,250
So the Buddhists basically say chaos is 
the normative condition.

679
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,720
Okay,
so fine.

680
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,150
So you,
how do you do that?

681
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,950
How do you,
how do you deal with that?

682
00:37:59,951 --> 00:38:02,710
It's not how you fight against it or 
defend against it.

683
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:06,850
I don't think those are appropriate.
Conceptuals conceptualizations.

684
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:10,420
It's not positive illusions.
It's not defense mechanisms.

685
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:13,030
It's none of that.
Although you may also use that.

686
00:38:13,031 --> 00:38:17,680
What it is is do you have an intimate 
relationship that works?

687
00:38:17,681 --> 00:38:21,730
Do you have a family that's that's net 
work well together and strong?

688
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:22,923
Do you have some sort of interesting 
occupation that regularizes your 

689
00:38:26,741 --> 00:38:27,574
schedule gives you something productive 
to do on a longterm basis is stable and 

690
00:38:31,691 --> 00:38:32,680
productive,
right?

691
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,693
Do you have something that you find to 
do or maybe more than one thing outside 

692
00:38:37,661 --> 00:38:38,890
of work,
right?

693
00:38:38,891 --> 00:38:42,780
And Are you compromising your mental and
physical health by doing any things that

694
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:45,130
are particularly stupid?
And you know,

695
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,113
one of those,
I would like the top one of those I 

696
00:38:47,981 --> 00:38:49,720
would say is probably alcoholism.

697
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,183
So if,
if there's one thing you really want to 

698
00:38:52,841 --> 00:38:56,260
avoid that screws up your life,
it's drinking too much,

699
00:38:56,261 --> 00:38:59,050
it is unbelievably dangerous.
So,

700
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,090
so the first thing we might say is,
well,

701
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:04,900
let's optimize those.
While the more you optimize those,

702
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,153
the more the more pillars there are in 
your plant and they're only somewhat 

703
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:11,164
correlated.
So maybe you can lose one or maybe you 

704
00:39:14,111 --> 00:39:16,870
can even lose too.
It's going to knock you down,

705
00:39:16,871 --> 00:39:18,850
but it's not going to sink you.
You know?

706
00:39:18,851 --> 00:39:22,300
And then you might also want to have 
variants on those plans to some degree.

707
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:26,710
So like one of the things I mentioned 
earlier is that it's always nice to have

708
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:27,544
an an alternative to your current job at
hand because it stops you from being 

709
00:39:33,551 --> 00:39:34,384
vulnerable.
It also stops you from being a slave or 

710
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:36,664
a victim or maybe even stops you from 
being a tyrant because you've got some 

711
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:40,624
choice.

712
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:41,643
So you diversify your,
your hierarchy of plants essentially 

713
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:49,083
just like you do.
You can think about it as stock market 

714
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:53,170
investing in some sense it's a very 
analogous idea.

715
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,720
You don't put all your eggs in the same 
basket.

716
00:39:55,721 --> 00:39:58,840
You diversify across multiple 
portfolios.

717
00:39:58,841 --> 00:39:59,674
So if one sector gets knocked out,
hopefully it doesn't knock you 

718
00:40:02,951 --> 00:40:05,760
completely out of the gate.
So,

719
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,213
so,
and that's partly what a guide you 

720
00:40:08,081 --> 00:40:08,914
through in the F in the future authoring
program too because it asks you to 

721
00:40:11,351 --> 00:40:15,610
consider what I think are the main six 
dimensions of your life,

722
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,103
you know?
And so one of the things I do when a 

723
00:40:18,161 --> 00:40:22,300
client comes is I just do a rough walk 
through of those dimensions.

724
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:23,163
It's like,
does anybody care if you're alive or 

725
00:40:25,511 --> 00:40:26,620
dead?
You know?

726
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:27,850
So if,
do you have any friends?

727
00:40:27,851 --> 00:40:30,010
Do you have anybody that loves you?
Do you have an intimate relationship?

728
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,010
How are things going with your family?
Do you have a job?

729
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,290
Are you as educated as you are?
Intelligent?

730
00:40:35,291 --> 00:40:37,450
Do you have any room for advancement in 
the future?

731
00:40:37,451 --> 00:40:39,700
Do you do anything interesting outside 
of your job?

732
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:44,800
And if the answer to all those is no,
it's like you're not depressed,

733
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:47,800
my friend,
you just are screwed.

734
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:50,020
Really.
It's like if someone,

735
00:40:50,021 --> 00:40:53,710
like someone comes to me and they're 40 
and that's the issue,

736
00:40:53,711 --> 00:40:54,544
especially if they're also drinking,
it's like Humpty dumpty has hit the 

737
00:40:58,421 --> 00:41:02,020
floor and no one is going to put the 
pieces together because it's just,

738
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,590
it's too much.
It's too much people,

739
00:41:05,591 --> 00:41:06,424
you know what I mean?
It takes a whole lifetime to put those 

740
00:41:07,751 --> 00:41:08,584
things together.
And that's not a sudden that might have 

741
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:10,934
started as a psychological problem,
but by the time it's fully manifest in 

742
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:16,990
your 40 that's not a psychological 
problem.

743
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:18,580
It's just a complete catastrophe.

744
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:23,683
Okay.

745
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:28,170
Well I think sometimes antidepressants 
help and the reason they help his,

746
00:41:28,171 --> 00:41:31,050
cause they actually buffer the stress 
response.

747
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,273
So you know you're being ground down the
world because essentially what you are 

748
00:41:34,851 --> 00:41:35,900
is you're,
you're,

749
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,820
you're not even in the dominance 
hierarchy,

750
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,060
you're so low in the dominance hierarchy
or that you're not even in it.

751
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,770
Right?
You're an outcast fundamentally.

752
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,083
So maybe buffering the stress response 
will help the person just not die from 

753
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:51,680
that.
And then you start with one thing,

754
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,380
you know,
it's like you,

755
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,233
you lay out the potential areas for 
improval improvement on the table and 

756
00:41:59,301 --> 00:41:59,871
you say,
well,

757
00:41:59,871 --> 00:42:00,704
can we think of some small steps that 
you might take in one or more of those 

758
00:42:03,531 --> 00:42:08,390
domains to start putting something solid
underneath your feet?

759
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,660
But it's what happens,
I think,

760
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:12,494
is that as you lose those pillars,
the way that problems manifest 

761
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:20,690
themselves in your life becomes 
networked.

762
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,213
And so you might make progress here,
but some other catastrophe that's 

763
00:42:25,101 --> 00:42:27,200
looming over here is going to knock you 
down.

764
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:29,840
You know?
So yeah.

765
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,440
So there's that real happy,
happy.

766
00:42:43,381 --> 00:42:44,290
What about people?

767
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,090
No,
it means that you're,

768
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:46,983
you're better protected against being 
dreadfully miserable and swamp than you 

769
00:42:50,171 --> 00:42:51,004
would otherwise be.
So I would say you have to do those 

770
00:42:54,161 --> 00:42:57,220
things before you can even address the 
issue of being happy.

771
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:58,710
Right?
Because if,

772
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:59,543
if you don't have,
if you haven't established yourself in 

773
00:43:02,921 --> 00:43:05,110
one or one of,
or two of those domains,

774
00:43:05,111 --> 00:43:10,111
say there's some obvious things that you
could do to decrease the degree to which

775
00:43:10,181 --> 00:43:12,910
your life is negative that you haven't 
yet done.

776
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:14,103
So I would say you shouldn't even get to
the existential problem before you've 

777
00:43:16,601 --> 00:43:17,434
solved the practical problems.
And you may find that if you solve the 

778
00:43:20,351 --> 00:43:21,184
practical problems,
the existential problems would become 

779
00:43:23,231 --> 00:43:24,190
bearable.
Now,

780
00:43:24,191 --> 00:43:26,480
not necessarily.
No.

781
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,040
Because I might say,
well there's another class of people and

782
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:33,280
I would say this is one of the 
pathologies of being creative.

783
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:37,540
So if you're a high open person and you 
have all those things,

784
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,400
that's not going to be enough.

785
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,510
You're going to have to pick another 
domain where you're working on something

786
00:43:43,511 --> 00:43:44,344
that's positive and somewhat 
revolutionary because like the creative 

787
00:43:49,211 --> 00:43:50,044
impulse is for someone who's open.
We know it's a fundamental personality 

788
00:43:53,621 --> 00:43:54,880
dimension.
And I've watched,

789
00:43:54,881 --> 00:43:57,550
I'd have clients who are very high in 
openness and others who aren't.

790
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,960
And if the ones who are high in openness
aren't doing something creative,

791
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:07,000
then they're like dead sticks there.
They can't live properly.

792
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:09,790
So,
so you know that.

793
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,890
And I think those are the people,
for example,

794
00:44:11,891 --> 00:44:16,150
who benefit particularly from depth 
psychological approaches,

795
00:44:16,151 --> 00:44:20,170
especially young Ian approaches.
I think that all of ewing's clients were

796
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:22,930
high in openness because I've watched my
clients,

797
00:44:22,931 --> 00:44:26,710
I'll try union ideas out on them.
And if they're high in openness,

798
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,280
they worked like a charm.
It just fits right in with their psyche.

799
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:34,410
But if conservative people,
fundamentally conservative people low in

800
00:44:34,411 --> 00:44:37,110
openness and high in conscientiousness,
they,

801
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:42,060
it just doesn't click because the union 
approach is aesthetic and creative and,

802
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,280
and lots of people aren't either of 
those things.

803
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:47,580
So there was another question.
Yes.

804
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,800
Yeah.
But they fight.

805
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:53,870
Yeah.
Especially if you're orderly,

806
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:55,423
you know,
cause conscientiousness is partly 

807
00:44:56,511 --> 00:44:57,344
orderliness and part of the openness.
Hitler was like that he was extremely 

808
00:45:01,701 --> 00:45:02,534
orderly and extremely high in openness.
And one of the ways he solved that 

809
00:45:06,321 --> 00:45:08,000
problem was,
which was quite interesting,

810
00:45:08,001 --> 00:45:09,760
is that whenever there were art 
exhibits,

811
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:12,500
exhibitions in Nazi Germany,
there were two types.

812
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:13,573
There was the approved Nazi art,
which was very structured and 

813
00:45:16,791 --> 00:45:19,760
conventional and uh,
you know,

814
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:23,570
bordered on the propaganda stick.
And there was forbidden art,

815
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:26,510
which was really chaotic.
And like often it was a,

816
00:45:26,511 --> 00:45:27,344
the expressionists stuff for example,
which is really emotionally expressive 

817
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:31,453
but chaotic.
And Heather would have both exhibitions 

818
00:45:34,071 --> 00:45:36,530
going on at the same time and one of 
them would be forbidden,

819
00:45:36,531 --> 00:45:38,510
then the other would be approved,
you know.

820
00:45:38,511 --> 00:45:41,180
So,
but the problem with orderliness is that

821
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,270
you want everything to be in its 
category.

822
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:46,160
And no wonder we've,
we've,

823
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:49,190
we've described why that is.
But if you're open,

824
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:50,600
you're always thinking,
well,

825
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:53,120
maybe there's a better way of putting 
those things into a category.

826
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:55,460
And that's a,
that's a tough,

827
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:56,683
so orderly open.
People are always at odds with 

828
00:45:58,611 --> 00:45:59,480
themselves,
you know,

829
00:45:59,481 --> 00:46:00,314
so

830
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:04,243
industrial and high in openness but like
not necessarily like I can see by the 

831
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:14,340
[inaudible] but I also really old.

832
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,313
Yeah.
Well people like that are often 

833
00:46:16,011 --> 00:46:17,410
extremely successful.
Yeah.

834
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:18,530
Right,
right.

835
00:46:18,531 --> 00:46:19,364
And it looks like industriousness is the
part of conscientiousness that predicts 

836
00:46:22,131 --> 00:46:22,964
longterm life success.
And orderliness is the part that 

837
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,850
predicts conservative political 
attitudes,

838
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,810
but low openness is also associated with
conservative political attitudes.

839
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:38,300
So okay.
So okay,

840
00:46:41,611 --> 00:46:42,444
so,
so

841
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:46,110
the descent into the underworld,
that is basically what occurs.

842
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:49,350
It can occur at any level of your plant,
right.

843
00:46:49,351 --> 00:46:52,080
From the macro levels to the micro 
levels.

844
00:46:52,081 --> 00:46:52,914
And what happens is that it's a descent 
into chaos if the unexpected thing is 

845
00:46:56,341 --> 00:47:01,080
big enough to invalidate the framework 
that you're using to deal with the world

846
00:47:01,081 --> 00:47:03,000
at that moment.
Got It.

847
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:07,950
And then the degree to which you feel 
negative emotion is proportionate to the

848
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:09,023
importance of that plan to the 
organization of your perception and 

849
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:15,390
action.
So you could think about it as you could

850
00:47:15,391 --> 00:47:18,420
think about what you bring to bear on 
the world.

851
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,320
It's almost like you can think about it 
as how Google maps manages it.

852
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,680
You know how you can take Google maps 
and the,

853
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:27,360
obviously it's a cybernetic 
intelligence,

854
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:28,223
right?
The whole gps process because you say 

855
00:47:30,401 --> 00:47:35,170
I'm here and I'm going there,
and then it maps to rude out for you and

856
00:47:35,171 --> 00:47:38,830
if you go off route,
it goes through a little period of chaos

857
00:47:38,831 --> 00:47:40,030
and then it finds another route.

858
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,103
So it's really an intelligent system,
but you noticed that Google maps is 

859
00:47:44,711 --> 00:47:45,544
scalable,
so you can look at probably if you're 

860
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:53,131
going from here to Mississauga,
using a map of Canada is the wrong map,

861
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:54,993
right?
You want to scale the thing down until 

862
00:47:56,471 --> 00:47:57,304
you hit the level of resolution that 
both that best represents the situation 

863
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:03,580
so that you can move to where you want 
to go.

864
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:04,623
You can scale up and down in it,
and so finding out that the entire 

865
00:48:08,651 --> 00:48:09,484
country is being destroyed by nuclear 
bombs is going to be a much bigger a 

866
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:14,920
catastrophe in relationship to your 
plan.

867
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:15,883
Then finding out that there's a few 
obstacles in the street on your way to 

868
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,860
Mississauga that haven't been marked on 
the map.

869
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:24,240
And so,
so anyways,

870
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:27,290
you're going to be much more upset when 
the entire superordinate,

871
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:28,763
the low resolution plans are disrupted.
Then when the high resolution plans are 

872
00:48:31,901 --> 00:48:34,630
disrupted,
and that's partly how your mind,

873
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,753
part of the problem we're trying to 
solve here is how upset should you be 

874
00:48:39,071 --> 00:48:41,500
when something you don't want happens?

875
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:44,950
And the answer to that is that's 
virtually impossible to compute.

876
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:48,670
But then the problem is you have to 
compute it because if you don't,

877
00:48:48,671 --> 00:48:50,620
you'll burn yourself out with stress and
worry.

878
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:51,923
And that's not psychological,
that'll just kill you because it's 

879
00:48:54,311 --> 00:48:57,850
actually a physic psychophysiological he
damaging process.

880
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:58,893
So you have to constrain it.
And so here's some of the ways that you 

881
00:49:01,361 --> 00:49:02,890
constrain it.
One,

882
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,740
you're born with a baseline level of 
neuroticism.

883
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:07,383
So if you're higher in neuroticism,
you're gonna think that smaller things 

884
00:49:10,121 --> 00:49:13,570
are more catastrophic than someone who's
lower in neuroticism.

885
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:14,980
And you might say,
well,

886
00:49:14,981 --> 00:49:15,814
who's right?
And the answer is it depends completely 

887
00:49:18,221 --> 00:49:20,710
on the situation.
And it's random.

888
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:21,573
It's fundamentally random.
And that's why there's a normal 

889
00:49:23,021 --> 00:49:25,210
distribution.
On average,

890
00:49:25,211 --> 00:49:30,211
we would say that typical person is 
matched to the typical environment,

891
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:33,310
but sometimes the terrified people are 
going to be right.

892
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:35,200
And sometimes the people that you can't 
bother,

893
00:49:35,201 --> 00:49:36,670
no matter what you do are going to be 
right.

894
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:38,800
Okay?
So that's one,

895
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:40,450
it's crapshoot.
The second is,

896
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,240
um,
where are you in a dominance hierarchy?

897
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:45,093
Because one of the things your brain is 
trying to understand is how should you 

898
00:49:48,701 --> 00:49:49,534
regard yourself as an active and 
competent organism when you're facing 

899
00:49:52,391 --> 00:49:53,224
problems that you can't compute.
And the answer to that is we're not 

900
00:49:56,831 --> 00:49:57,664
going to solve that.
We're going to distribute the problem 

901
00:50:00,071 --> 00:50:03,370
into the social network and we're going 
to let everyone else solve it.

902
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:06,580
And so if you rise up in the dominance 
hierarchy,

903
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:10,450
your brain reacts as if the dominance 
hierarchy structure,

904
00:50:10,451 --> 00:50:15,130
which is composed of many,
many brains has run its computations and

905
00:50:15,131 --> 00:50:17,050
decided that you're pretty damn 
competent.

906
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:18,303
And so the way your brain responds to 
that is it cranks up your serotonin 

907
00:50:20,711 --> 00:50:23,380
production and decreases your 
neuroticism.

908
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:27,040
And it's perfectly reasonable 
computation because a,

909
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,153
if everybody says you're competent,
you're competent enough so that you're 

910
00:50:30,981 --> 00:50:34,310
going to get more rewarded for your 
competence than other people are,

911
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:36,800
and that's going to make you more secure
in your job.

912
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:40,430
And it's gonna make you more desirable 
and in demand among other people,

913
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:43,700
and that's going to give you access to 
resources you wouldn't otherwise have.

914
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:48,110
So,
and then there's a,

915
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:48,944
there's a correlated element to that,
which is sort of your level of self 

916
00:50:51,831 --> 00:50:52,664
esteem,
although that's very much associated 

917
00:50:53,961 --> 00:50:55,610
with,
with neuroticism.

918
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:58,610
People with high self esteem generally 
have low levels of,

919
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:00,500
of negative emotion.
It's not,

920
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:03,660
it's not clear that those are separable 
phenomena.

921
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:05,890
All right.
What time is it?

922
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:11,050
Two 45 all right,
well let's stop for 10 minutes.

923
00:51:11,051 --> 00:51:13,000
Okay.
And we'll,

924
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:15,400
yeah,
let's stop for 10 minutes.
