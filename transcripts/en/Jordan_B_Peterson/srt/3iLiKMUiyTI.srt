1
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,120
So I think the best way to continue to 
walk you through the,

2
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,263
the,
the thinkers that we're planning to 

3
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:21,904
cover is to do that with examples.
Some they stick better and they're more 

4
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,734
interesting and it's very difficult to 
understand you outside of a narrative 

5
00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:33,070
context.
And so I'm going to walk you through the

6
00:00:33,071 --> 00:00:35,440
lion king today.
How many of you have seen the lion king?

7
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,320
Yes.
So how many of you haven't?

8
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,031
Right.
Okay.

9
00:00:40,031 --> 00:00:40,864
So,
so you obviously were raised in a box 

10
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:44,290
somewhere out in the middle of the 
field.

11
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,140
So anyways,
you know,

12
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:47,561
it's,
it's,

13
00:00:47,561 --> 00:00:50,350
it's an amazingly popular animated 
movie.

14
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:54,580
I think it was the most highest grossing
animated movie ever made until frozen,

15
00:00:54,581 --> 00:00:58,720
which I actually absolutely detested.
But the lion king,

16
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,913
the lion king is actually consciously 
influenced by archetypes as well as 

17
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:05,890
unconsciously influenced by them.
So it's a bit of a cheat,

18
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:06,850
I would say in some sense.

19
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:07,960
But it doesn't,
I don't,

20
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,090
for the purposes that we're using it 
for,

21
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:13,570
I think it's just fine.
And so I'm partly,

22
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:14,643
what you might think about is that it's 
its relationship to archetipal themes 

23
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,713
that made it so overwhelmingly popular.
Same being the case with say books and 

24
00:01:24,161 --> 00:01:27,100
movies like Harry Potter or the entire 
Marvel series.

25
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,360
The Marvel series is quite interesting.
I know somebody who wrote for Batman and

26
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:33,760
for Wolverine,
I know Batman isn't a marvel comic,

27
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:37,420
but one of the things that he told me 
that was quite interesting was that once

28
00:01:37,421 --> 00:01:40,690
these characters take off and establish 
a life of their own,

29
00:01:40,691 --> 00:01:41,524
they have a backstory and which becomes 
part of the mythology that's 

30
00:01:43,781 --> 00:01:45,790
collectively held by the readers.
And if you,

31
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,013
you can invent an alternative universe 
where you can muck about with the 

32
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:51,340
backstory,
but otherwise you better stick with it.

33
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:52,174
Or the readers are going to write you 
and tell you that you've got the story 

34
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:54,280
wrong.

35
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,113
And so there's a bit of a collaboration 
between the writers and the readers 

36
00:01:57,731 --> 00:01:59,770
after these things take on a life of 
their own.

37
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,270
And so,
and of course the,

38
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,880
they,
they tend to,

39
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:08,080
the comic books in particular tend to 
tend towards mythological themes very,

40
00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:10,240
very rapidly.
And so anyways,

41
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,700
um,
Carl Young was a fascinating person.

42
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:16,870
I think you can read his biography,
autobiography slash,

43
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:18,280
biography,
which is called memories,

44
00:02:18,281 --> 00:02:19,114
dreams and reflections,
which in many ways I think is an 

45
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:24,970
unfortunate book because it's usually 
the only book that people read that that

46
00:02:24,971 --> 00:02:25,804
is more or less by young but,
and it is more popularly at popularly 

47
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:31,480
accessible,
which is probably a good thing,

48
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:33,270
but it's also,
uh,

49
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,160
it's not as rigorous as his other books.
And so,

50
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,403
um,
the problem with someone like young as 

51
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:39,274
you kind of have to read them as much as
you can in the original because 

52
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:44,470
interpreting him is not a very 
straightforward forward matter.

53
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,733
Um,
he was a very visionary person by which 

54
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:52,090
I mean he had an incredible visual 
imagination and he used that a lot.

55
00:02:52,091 --> 00:02:52,924
He used it in his therapy practice.
I believe that most of his therapy 

56
00:02:56,111 --> 00:02:58,750
clients were high in trade openness.
Um,

57
00:02:58,751 --> 00:03:01,030
I have lot of clients who are high in 
trait openness.

58
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,290
They kind of seek me out because I'm 
high in trade openness and you know,

59
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,120
they watch my videos and that sort of 
thing and they're interested in what I'm

60
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:11,350
doing.
And many of them are are astute dreamers

61
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:12,184
and prolific dreamers.
And many open people in my experience 

62
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:15,754
have archetipal dreams.
Whereas people who are lower and 

63
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:18,454
openness,
they either don't dream at all or they 

64
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:20,524
don't remember their dreams as much or 
they're not interested in them and 

65
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:26,020
they're not interested in the 
mythological underpinnings of them.

66
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:27,183
So I've,
I've taught psychology roughly speaking 

67
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,533
to many different types of people,
including lawyers and lawyers and 

68
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:35,164
physicians and they tend to be higher in
trait conscientiousness then in 

69
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:38,674
openness.

70
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:42,460
And they're much more interested in the 
practical applications of psychology and

71
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:45,400
maybe the big five theories than they 
are in the narrative underpinnings.

72
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:48,800
And you know,
people say that when they went to union,

73
00:03:48,801 --> 00:03:51,130
they had union dreams,
but I don't.

74
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,140
And then when they went to Freud,
they had Friday and dreams.

75
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:55,480
And I don't really believe that's 
exactly true.

76
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:57,310
I think it was a matter of selection 
bias,

77
00:03:57,311 --> 00:03:58,144
a priori selection bias on the part of 
the people who were likely to go see 

78
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,460
either of those two.
And so,

79
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:04,294
but I've been struck by some clients in 
particular how unbelievably continually 

80
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:09,994
they can generate deep archetypal dreams
with a really coherent narrative 

81
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:15,340
structure.
It's really phenomenal.

82
00:04:15,341 --> 00:04:16,174
And how revealing those dreams are 
problem with archetipal dreams is that 

83
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:20,260
they're not really personal,
right?

84
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,094
So if you're looking for a personal way 
out of a situation and archetipal dream 

85
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:24,814
doesn't help you that much because it 
gives you the general pattern rather 

86
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,750
than a specific solution to your 
problem.

87
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,380
But a good dream will do both at once.
Anyways.

88
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,940
A young was an astute student of 
Freud's,

89
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,810
uh,
we'll cover freud next.

90
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,240
Although generally in personality 
courses the,

91
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,483
the order is reversed Freud first and 
then you can because of their temporal 

92
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,380
of the temporal order of their thought.
But,

93
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:48,214
um,
I think it's better to start with young 

94
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,330
because it's,
it's as if you,

95
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:55,600
Freud excavated into the basement and 
then young excavated into many,

96
00:04:55,601 --> 00:04:58,240
many floors underneath the basement of 
the mind.

97
00:04:58,241 --> 00:04:59,074
And so from,
if you're transitioning from an archaic 

98
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,420
understanding of archaic modes of 
thinking towards Freud,

99
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:06,580
it's better to go through yield because 
young is,

100
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,773
I think,
I think Freud in theory is a subset of 

101
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:10,654
union theory.
Fundamentally just like Newtonian 

102
00:05:12,281 --> 00:05:17,200
physics is a subset of Einsteinian 
physics and I think that Freud knew that

103
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:20,560
even to some degree,
although he was very much opposed to any

104
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:24,280
sort of religious thinking,
mythological religious thinking,

105
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:25,114
I would say he was a real 19th century 
materialist and he didn't like the fact 

106
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:29,674
that humans work started to delve into 
religious themes in a manner that 

107
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:36,130
actually in some sense validated those 
themes.

108
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:36,963
And so that's actually why they split.
They split when you published a book 

109
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:43,690
called symbols of transformation,
human was also a deep student of nature.

110
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,823
Nature wrote a book called [inaudible],
which is kind of an old testament 

111
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:49,990
revelation,
poetry kind of book.

112
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:50,824
It's a strange one and I wouldn't 
recommend if you want to read Nietzsche 

113
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:55,480
that you start with that one,
but most people do.

114
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,660
But you get a seminar on thus spake 
Sarah through Sta,

115
00:05:59,661 --> 00:06:01,850
which is about,
I've got this wrong,

116
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:02,684
it's somewhere between 700 and 1100 
pages long and it only covers the first 

117
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:06,974
third of the book and thus spake Sarah 
Theaster is actually quite a short book 

118
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:10,993
and so well,
so you can imagine how much you had to 

119
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:14,534
know about Nicha to derive that many 
words out of that few words and nature 

120
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:19,880
was a,
well,

121
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:20,714
an absolute absolute genius and young 
was actually trying to answer the 

122
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:27,290
question that Nietzsche posed 
fundamentally,

123
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,610
which is why part of the reason why it's
incorrect historically to consider him a

124
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:33,710
freud and he was so niche.

125
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,543
It basically stated,
let's say explicitly that scientific 

126
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:39,884
empiricism slash rationalism had 
resulted in the death of the 

127
00:06:42,891 --> 00:06:45,350
mythological tradition of the west,
roughly speaking.

128
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:48,260
That's niche comment on the death of 
God.

129
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:49,094
And in that comment he also said that 
the fact that God was dead was going to 

130
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:53,414
produce tremendous ideational and social
historical upheavals that would result 

131
00:06:58,101 --> 00:06:58,934
in the deaths of millions of people that
that he didn't say all that in one 

132
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:02,541
place.
It's,

133
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,374
it's spread between,
part of it's in will to power and I 

134
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:08,900
can't remember the source of the other 
one.

135
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:09,973
Some of it's referenced in [inaudible],
but Nietzsche believed that in order to 

136
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:17,630
overcome that collapse of traditional 
values with the idea,

137
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:18,464
say of God as its cornerstone,
people would have to become creatures 

138
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:25,790
that could produce their own values as a
replacement,

139
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:30,490
that we would have to become capable of 
generating autonomous values and young.

140
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,470
But,
but that's easier said than done because

141
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:34,304
trying to impose a set of values on 
yourself is very difficult because 

142
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:37,454
you're not very cooperative and you know
that if you try to get yourself to do 

143
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:42,050
something that you don't want to do or 
that's hard,

144
00:07:42,051 --> 00:07:45,140
you just won't do it.
And so it's not like you can just invent

145
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:46,940
your own values and then go along with 
that.

146
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:47,774
That just doesn't work.
And so what young and the Floridians 

147
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,530
did,
Freud first I would say,

148
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,650
was to start looking into looking into 
people's fantasies,

149
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:55,484
autonomous fantasies,
unconscious fantasies to see if they 

150
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,784
could to,
and and discovered that values bubbled 

151
00:08:02,631 --> 00:08:05,660
up of their own accord into those 
fantasies.

152
00:08:05,661 --> 00:08:06,860
And you can imagine,
for example,

153
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:07,694
if you've become enamored of someone 
that you might start fantasizing about 

154
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:12,230
them.
And if you read off the fantasy,

155
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:14,420
then you can tell what you're after and 
what you're up to.

156
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,253
And so the motivational force composes 
the fantasy and fried was more 

157
00:08:19,371 --> 00:08:21,140
interested,
not in a personal sense.

158
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,080
So in,
in so far as your fantasies might reveal

159
00:08:24,081 --> 00:08:25,970
your personal history.
So for example,

160
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,820
if you have a burst of negative emotion 
in a clinical session,

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,833
there'll be a fantasy that goes along 
with that and an association of ideas 

162
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,260
that,
that,

163
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,960
that kind of manifest themselves of 
their own accord.

164
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:39,080
And they're not necessarily coherent,
logical third link by emotion.

165
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,110
That's the free association technique in
Freudian Psychology.

166
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:45,080
And they also might manifest themselves 
in dreams and fantasies.

167
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:48,980
And so Freud started doing the analysis 
of these spontaneous,

168
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:49,843
let's call them fantasies and Ewan 
linked that more Freud did this first 

169
00:08:53,391 --> 00:08:54,224
with the depaul oedipal complex,
but then you linked up spontaneous 

170
00:08:57,631 --> 00:08:59,730
fantasies and dreams with,
with myth,

171
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,623
mythology and fantasy across history.
And of course piaget did the same thing 

172
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,240
from a completely different standpoint.

173
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,253
So,
and that a lot of that's embedded in 

174
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:08,694
this movie,
so we might as well just walk through 

175
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:10,650
it.
So,

176
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:13,470
ah,
the first question might be,

177
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,940
well,
why is a lion and king,

178
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,470
right?
And because that'd be,

179
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:18,670
it makes sense to people that aligned 
could be a king.

180
00:09:18,671 --> 00:09:20,820
And of course a lion is an apex 
predator.

181
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,013
And so,
which means it's at the top of the food 

182
00:09:23,161 --> 00:09:24,210
chain,
roughly speaking.

183
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:27,480
And it's sort of golden like the sun.
So that's also useful.

184
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:28,314
And you know,
it has that main that makes it look 

185
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:30,264
majestic.
And of course it's very physically 

186
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:33,190
powerful and it's,
it's,

187
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:35,820
and,
and it's intimidating.

188
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,490
And so it's something that you run away 
from as well.

189
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:41,130
Right?
Or you're awestruck by the fact that,

190
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,113
you know,
it's like snail king just doesn't make 

191
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:44,160
any sense.
Right?

192
00:09:44,161 --> 00:09:45,580
But Lion King,
that works.

193
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,740
And you got to think about those things 
because it's not self evident why a lion

194
00:09:49,741 --> 00:09:50,970
would work as a king,
but a,

195
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,500
but a snail wouldn't.

196
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,910
But it fits in with your metaphorical 
understanding of the way the world works

197
00:09:56,911 --> 00:09:57,744
much better.
And so the lion king makes sense and 

198
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,313
well,
and when things like that that aren't 

199
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,773
rationally self evident makes sense.
You have to ask yourself in what 

200
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:10,320
metaphorical context do they make sense?
So you have the lion king.

201
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,570
Now the movie opens with a sunrise and 
the sunrise is equivalent to the dawn of

202
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:18,330
consciousness.
So that in many archaic stories,

203
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,680
the son was a hero like horace,
if I remember correctly,

204
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,690
was a solar king
Apollo in particular,

205
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:32,130
but Apollo Greek Greek myth.
The idea was that the sun was,

206
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,900
this was the,
uh,

207
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,033
the hero,
the hero who illuminated the sky in the 

208
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,573
day.
And so here are wisdom and illumination 

209
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:42,630
and enlightenment are all tangled 
together metaphorically.

210
00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:45,900
And then at night what would happen 
would be that son would fight with the,

211
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,853
with the dragon of darkness basically or
with evil all night and then rise again 

212
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:51,990
victorious in the morning.

213
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,940
And so it's a death and rebirth.
The minutes,

214
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:54,880
very,
very cold,

215
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,820
very,
very common mythological theme.

216
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,450
And the reason the sun is associated 
with consciousness as far as I can tell,

217
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,820
is that we're not nocturnal creatures,
right?

218
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:04,650
We are awake during the day and we're 
very,

219
00:11:04,651 --> 00:11:05,484
very visual.
Half our brain is devoted to visual 

220
00:11:06,901 --> 00:11:10,890
processing and to be a lightened and 
illuminated means to develop,

221
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:13,500
to move towards a higher state of 
consciousness.

222
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:17,580
And we naturally use light symbolism to,
to represent that,

223
00:11:17,581 --> 00:11:18,414
you know,
like the light bulb on the top of 

224
00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:20,460
someone's head.
You know,

225
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:24,180
you don't say I was in dark.
And when you learn something new,

226
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,313
and so again,
that fits into this underlying 

227
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:31,080
metaphorical substrate that that's I 
think deeply biologically grounded,

228
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,870
but also sociology,
socially grounded.

229
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,360
So it's a new day,
it's the start of a new day.

230
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:39,360
And a day day actually means like 
French.

231
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,960
Your Nae Means Day,
the day trek in some sense.

232
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:46,810
And how to comport yourself during the 
day is the fundamental question.

233
00:11:46,811 --> 00:11:48,990
And the day is the canonical unit of 
time.

234
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,440
And so you have to know how to comport 
yourself during the day.

235
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:53,274
And part of that,
a journey from consciousness into 

236
00:11:54,701 --> 00:11:55,870
unconsciousness.
And that's,

237
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,300
and that return.
So like a Paulo,

238
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,240
you,
you've,

239
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,200
you descend into unconsciousness and 
then reemerge.

240
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:04,150
And of course that's not metaphorical at
all.

241
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:04,984
That's exactly what you do.
You descend into the underworld of 

242
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:10,270
darkness and dreams and strange things 
happened out there.

243
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,860
And so,
and then you awake.

244
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:14,890
If you're fortunate or unfortunate,
depending on your state of mind,

245
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,560
you will wake in the morning and it's a 
new day,

246
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,040
right?
And so the dream world seems to help you

247
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,690
sort out your thoughts.
By the way,

248
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:25,150
if you keep people awake for an extended
period of time,

249
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,343
then they,
uh,

250
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,820
they,
they,

251
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,530
they lose their minds essentially.

252
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,633
The dream,
the unconsciousness and the dream state 

253
00:12:32,741 --> 00:12:35,170
seem absolutely critical.
And the maintenance of mental health,

254
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,004
although people don't exactly understand
why it looks like dreams might help you 

255
00:12:39,131 --> 00:12:41,800
forget because forgetting is really 
important.

256
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:42,663
You just can't wait.
You just can't remember everything that 

257
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:46,870
happened to you get so damn cluttered 
that,

258
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,970
that you'd,
you'd fall apart.

259
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,700
And so you reduce things to the just,
and when you're doing that,

260
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,743
you pack them.
It's like you compress them in some 

261
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:54,874
sense.
You pack them into a smaller space and 

262
00:12:56,111 --> 00:12:57,670
get rid of everything that isn't 
relevant.

263
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,640
And the dream seems to now be part of 
that.

264
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:01,474
It also seems to be a place where you 
deeply encode learning that might've 

265
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,713
been done that day,
which is something that Freud actually 

266
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:09,100
noted in his interpretation of dreams,
which is a great book.

267
00:13:09,101 --> 00:13:11,230
If you're ever going to read a book that
Freud wrote,

268
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,710
the interpretation of dreams is the 
proper one to read in my estimation.

269
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,100
It's a brilliant book and it laid the 
groundwork for a lot of what you did.

270
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,833
So anyways,
that's how the movie starts and the 

271
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:22,990
animals come out into the light.
And that's,

272
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,620
that's a metaphor for the dawning of 
consciousness to come out into the light

273
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:30,850
where you can see.
And so this is a baby giraffe and babies

274
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,770
emerge into the light,
roughly speaking.

275
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,060
And that's,
that's like I said,

276
00:13:34,061 --> 00:13:34,894
that that's a representation of,
of the emergence or expansion of 

277
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:39,850
consciousness.
And so this is how the movie starts.

278
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:42,310
It starts with very expansive music as 
well,

279
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,150
celebratory music.
And that's to indicate to you to set the

280
00:13:46,151 --> 00:13:46,984
tone for the movie,
but also to indicate to you that you're 

281
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,990
about to watch something of import.
And the opening scene is actually a real

282
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:53,824
scene of genius in my estimation.
The animators did a great job and it 

283
00:13:56,021 --> 00:13:57,610
goes along very nicely with the music.

284
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,650
And so you see this lit place and then 
you see this rock pride rock,

285
00:14:02,651 --> 00:14:04,810
I believe it's called in the middle of 
it,

286
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:06,580
and it's the center.
It's the center.

287
00:14:06,581 --> 00:14:08,740
It's like the spot that's marked by a 
cathedral,

288
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:11,410
which is an x or across,
and you're right in the middle of that.

289
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,740
And so it's the center of the light.
That's another way of thinking about it.

290
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:19,690
Or it's the center of the territory or 
it's the home or it's the fire in the in

291
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:22,540
the wilderness or it's the tree in the 
center where you live.

292
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:26,170
It's all of those things at once.
It's inhabited territory with you at the

293
00:14:26,171 --> 00:14:27,004
center and the,
the rock represents tradition because 

294
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,173
people tend to inscribe their traditions
on rock right or two to build them into 

295
00:14:35,351 --> 00:14:36,184
rock like the pyramid.
So you could think about that as a 

296
00:14:37,571 --> 00:14:39,310
pyramid,
as an Egyptian pyramid,

297
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,930
and it's the right way to think about 
it.

298
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:42,003
You could also think about it as a 
dominance hierarchy with the apex 

299
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,150
Predator at the top.
And that's the line.

300
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,420
So it makes sense that the lion would be
in the light on the rock.

301
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:51,590
That's a pyramid in the middle of the 
territory.

302
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:52,783
Right?
That makes sense to people 

303
00:14:53,331 --> 00:14:56,420
psychologically.
So because that's what the state is,

304
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,343
the state is a hierarchy with with 
something at the top that occupies a 

305
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:04,550
space that has been illuminated and made
safe by consciousness.

306
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:07,550
That's what the state is.
And that's all represented right away in

307
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:08,384
this movie.
And all the animals come to to observe 

308
00:15:11,421 --> 00:15:12,254
what's happening in the pyramid and at 
the top because they need to know what 

309
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:18,110
happens as at the top,
partly to organize their world.

310
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,123
That's the pyramid,
but also to see how the organizational 

311
00:15:21,501 --> 00:15:24,140
principle works.
And that's why they're all gathering.

312
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,243
And so they're gathering in the light in
the morning to observe something new 

313
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,490
that's going to be born that's of 
significant importance.

314
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:36,020
And that's the birth of the hero and 
this little bird here Zazu right?

315
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,590
It's the zoo is like horus,
the Egyptian God who was a falcon.

316
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,633
And an eye at the same time.
He is the king's eye in this king's 

317
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:45,530
eyes,
in this movie,

318
00:15:45,531 --> 00:15:48,260
right?
He flies up above outside of the pyramid

319
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:51,320
so he can see everything that goes on 
and reports to the king.

320
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:52,154
And so partly what that indicates is 
that the thing that's at the top of the 

321
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:55,964
pyramid needs to be an eye.
And that's partly why you see an eye on 

322
00:15:58,731 --> 00:16:01,280
the top of the pyramid on the back of 
the American dollar bill.

323
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,263
It's exactly the same idea.
Or if you look at the Washington 

324
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:05,930
Monument,
which is a pyramid at the top,

325
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,780
you see that it's capped with aluminum 
and you think,

326
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:09,710
well,
why aluminum?

327
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:12,740
And the answer to that was it was the 
most expensive metal at that time.

328
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,530
And so the notion is,
is that at the top of the pyramid,

329
00:16:15,531 --> 00:16:18,680
there's something that actually doesn't 
belong in the pyramid.

330
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,250
It's something that goes up above the 
pyramid and can see everything.

331
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,050
And so you could think about it this 
way,

332
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:26,510
is that you're going to be in a lot of 
pyramids in your life,

333
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,780
dominance hierarchies,
and different states and families.

334
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:33,440
And all of that and they'll arrange 
themselves into a hierarchy and there'll

335
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:34,274
be something at the top.
And the top is the thing that can do 

336
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:37,304
well across hierarchies.
So it's not stuck in any one pyramid at 

337
00:16:40,551 --> 00:16:44,600
10 it's partly associated with vision 
and the ability to see a long,

338
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:45,434
long distance also to see what you don't
want to see and to report that back to 

339
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:50,780
the king.
And so the king,

340
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,733
fundamentally,
as far as you guys are concerned from a 

341
00:16:53,991 --> 00:16:56,510
psychological perspective,
that's your Super Ego.

342
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:00,230
That's the Freudian perspective.
Or it might be the moral system by which

343
00:17:00,231 --> 00:17:03,860
you comport yourself,
but your eyes are the thing that updates

344
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:04,430
that,
right?

345
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,290
You need it to Orient Yourself in the 
world.

346
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,110
You need it to Orient Yourself among 
other people,

347
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,320
but your eye and your capacity to pay 
attention,

348
00:17:12,321 --> 00:17:13,154
especially to what you don't want to pay
attention to is the thing that 

349
00:17:15,681 --> 00:17:16,514
continually updates that model.
Exactly as piaget laid out with 

350
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:20,150
children.
So,

351
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,910
and all of that's packed into the 
imagery in the first,

352
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:24,770
you know,
few minutes of this movie.

353
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:27,410
And that's actually why it really relies
on imagery.

354
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,110
Why this isn't just a lecture by a 
psychologist.

355
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,930
You know when you go to see the movie,
it's because the images,

356
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,000
they say a picture is worth a thousand 
words,

357
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:35,834
but,
and there's thousands of pictures in 

358
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:38,174
this movie obviously,
but maybe a picture is worth more words 

359
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:43,250
than you can actually use to describe 
it.

360
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,940
If the picture is is profound enough.
And we have many,

361
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:47,774
many pictures like that and he deeply 
picture is virtually inexhaustible in 

362
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,950
terms of its semantically with regards 
to its explanation.

363
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,020
Images are very,
very dense.

364
00:17:58,021 --> 00:17:59,760
So anyways,
the animals all gathered.

365
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:03,210
Now the animals are also,
he had representations from the Freud in

366
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:04,044
perspective and the Ed is the part of 
your psyche from the Freudian 

367
00:18:06,571 --> 00:18:08,670
perspective,
that's animalistic and,

368
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,020
and,
and full of,

369
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,240
of,
of implicit drives,

370
00:18:12,241 --> 00:18:15,930
sexual and aggressive in particular as 
far as Freud was concerned.

371
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:16,943
And that's because those two drives say 
unlike thirst or hunger are much more 

372
00:18:20,581 --> 00:18:25,380
difficult to integrate into proper 
social being and tend to be excluded and

373
00:18:25,381 --> 00:18:28,590
left unconscious.
And so a lot of Friday and psychology,

374
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:29,424
and I would say psychology in general is
focused on the integration of sexual 

375
00:18:33,241 --> 00:18:35,880
impulses and aggressive impulses into 
the psyche.

376
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,890
I would also add to that anxiety because
anxiety is also a major problem.

377
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,630
Anxiety and negative emotion that's pain
like is also a major problem for people.

378
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:46,643
And so the animals represent those ed 
like impulses that have to be organized 

379
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:54,730
hierarchically before you can become an 
integrated being in precisely the piaget

380
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,501
had manner,
right?

381
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:56,880
Because Piaget would say,
well,

382
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,073
the child comes into the world with 
reflexes and maybe a more modern 

383
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:04,620
psychologists would also con concentrate
on the implicit motivations.

384
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,610
And those have to be organized inside 
the child into some kind of hierarchy of

385
00:19:08,611 --> 00:19:13,410
unity before the child can organize him 
or herself into the broader unity of the

386
00:19:13,411 --> 00:19:14,244
state.
And that's basically what's being 

387
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:17,010
represented here.
And so,

388
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,260
so Zazu the eyes of the king comes to 
checkout the king,

389
00:19:22,261 --> 00:19:25,920
and that's what's his name?
What's the king's name?

390
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,450
Mufasa.
Yeah.

391
00:19:27,451 --> 00:19:29,520
And he is,
he had a very regal looking person,

392
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,490
a lion,
and he stands up straight and tall.

393
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,323
And that means that he's high in 
Serotonin because Saratonin governs 

394
00:19:35,671 --> 00:19:37,050
posture reflection.
And if so,

395
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:39,510
if you're dominant and near the top of 
hierarchies,

396
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,470
you tend to expand so that you look 
bigger than than you could if you shrunk

397
00:19:43,471 --> 00:19:45,450
down.
And so if you're low dominant person,

398
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:49,770
you wander around like this so that you 
look small and weak and you don't pose a

399
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,390
threat to anybody.
But if you're at the top,

400
00:19:51,391 --> 00:19:54,240
you expand yourself so that you can 
command the space.

401
00:19:54,241 --> 00:19:57,300
And that's why he has that particular 
kind of regal posture.

402
00:19:57,301 --> 00:19:59,010
And if you look at his facial 
expression,

403
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,860
you see that it's quite severe.
He like he's,

404
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,040
he's capable of kindness,
but he's also harsh and judgmental.

405
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,830
And that's what society is like.
That's what the superego is like.

406
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,290
And what that means is that he's 
integrated his aggression.

407
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,333
And I've seen this happen in my clinical
clients when they come in and they're 

408
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:14,724
too agreeable,
they look like Simba looks later in the 

409
00:20:17,221 --> 00:20:20,940
movie when he's an adolescent and he's 
sort of like a deer in headlights.

410
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,190
Everything is coming in and nothing is 
coming out.

411
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,413
But when the person integrates their 
shadow and gets the aggressive part of 

412
00:20:27,301 --> 00:20:28,950
themselves integrated into their 
personality,

413
00:20:28,951 --> 00:20:31,290
their faces hardened.
And if you look at people,

414
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,840
you can tell because the people who are 
too agreeable,

415
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:36,330
look childlike and innocent and the 
people who will,

416
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:39,900
a hyper aggressive person will look mean
and cruel.

417
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,410
But
let's see if that's good.

418
00:20:43,411 --> 00:20:44,970
That's still working.
So,

419
00:20:44,971 --> 00:20:47,220
uh,
but I've seen people's face changes,

420
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:50,530
change face change in the course of 
therapy,

421
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,510
men and women.
So,

422
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,320
and what happens is they start to look 
more mature and it's more like they're,

423
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,800
they're judging the world as well as 
interacting with it properly.

424
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,720
Once they integrate that more 
disagreeable part of it,

425
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:04,030
it's very,
very necessary.

426
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:08,140
And that's part of the incorporation of 
the union shadow or the incorporation of

427
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,090
the unconscious from a Freudian 
perspective,

428
00:21:10,091 --> 00:21:13,420
but old Musap Musafa there,
he's already got that,

429
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,210
he's already got that covered.

430
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:18,190
So,
and he's capable.

431
00:21:18,191 --> 00:21:19,024
Like obviously he can smile and he's 
fully capable of the full range of 

432
00:21:21,971 --> 00:21:23,890
expressions,
but he's a tough looking character.

433
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,170
And now this they'll baboon here who's 
supposed to be basically just a fool.

434
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:30,004
When the story was first written,
he turned into what's essentially a 

435
00:21:31,961 --> 00:21:32,794
sharman across time.
And so he represents the self from the 

436
00:21:36,341 --> 00:21:37,174
union perspective.
Now the self is everything you could be 

437
00:21:39,371 --> 00:21:40,204
across time.
So you imagine that there's you and 

438
00:21:42,161 --> 00:21:44,830
there's the potential inside you,
whatever that is,

439
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,693
you know,
and potential is an interesting idea 

440
00:21:47,231 --> 00:21:51,640
because it's represents something that 
isn't yet real yet we act like it's real

441
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,400
because people will say to you,
you should live up to your potential.

442
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,653
And that potential is partly what you 
could be if you interacted with the 

443
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:02,200
world in a manner that would gain you 
the most information,

444
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:02,920
right?

445
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,050
Because you build yourself out of the 
information in the [inaudible] sense.

446
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,143
But it's deeper than that too,
because we know that if you take 

447
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,080
yourself and you put yourself in a new 
environment,

448
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,510
new genes turn on in your nervous 
system,

449
00:22:13,511 --> 00:22:14,344
they encode for new proteins.
And so you're full of biological 

450
00:22:17,441 --> 00:22:18,274
potential.
That won't be realized unless you move 

451
00:22:19,961 --> 00:22:23,890
yourself around in the world into 
different challenging circumstances.

452
00:22:23,891 --> 00:22:24,724
And that'll turn on different circuits.
So it's not merely that you're 

453
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:27,874
incorporating information from the 
outside world in the constructivist 

454
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:30,964
sense,
it's that by exposing yourself to 

455
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:33,424
different environments,
you put different physiological demands 

456
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,000
on,
on yourself,

457
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:41,980
all the way down to the genetic level.
And that manifests new elements of you.

458
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,290
And so one of the things that happens to
people,

459
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:46,810
and this is a very common cultural 
notion,

460
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:47,823
is that you should go on a pilgrimage at
some point to somewhere central in that 

461
00:22:51,281 --> 00:22:52,114
would be say like the Rock and the pride
rock and the lion king because you take 

462
00:22:55,511 --> 00:22:56,344
yourself out of your dopey little 
village and that's just the little 

463
00:22:58,421 --> 00:23:01,540
bounded you that everyone knows and that
isn't very expanded.

464
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,140
And then you go somewhere dark and 
dangerous to the central place.

465
00:23:05,141 --> 00:23:08,020
And while you do that,
you have adventures and they toughen you

466
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,063
and pull more out of you.
And like partly because you're becoming 

467
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,920
informed,
which means information,

468
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:18,220
it means you're becoming more organized 
at every level of analysis.

469
00:23:18,221 --> 00:23:21,910
But there's also more of you too.
And so that's a very classic idea.

470
00:23:21,911 --> 00:23:25,000
And then in cathedrals in Europe,
especially at charter,

471
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:27,430
there's a big maze on the floor,
a circular maize,

472
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,533
which is a symbolic representation of 
the pilgrimage for people who couldn't 

473
00:23:31,301 --> 00:23:32,134
do it.
And so it's a huge circle divided into 

474
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:35,980
quadrants,
which is a union Mandela.

475
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:40,120
And you enter the maize at one point and
then you have to walk through the entire

476
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:41,470
maze north,
east,

477
00:23:41,471 --> 00:23:44,320
west,
and south before you get to the center.

478
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:48,020
And the center is symbolized by a flower
that's carved in stone.

479
00:23:48,021 --> 00:23:49,340
It looks like this.
It's big.

480
00:23:49,341 --> 00:23:49,971
This means,
hey,

481
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:50,331
it's,
it's,

482
00:23:50,331 --> 00:23:51,164
it's,
it's large so that you can walk it and 

483
00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:55,490
that's a symbolic pilgrimage.
It takes you to the center.

484
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,460
That's the center of the Cross because 
it tended cathedral.

485
00:23:58,461 --> 00:24:01,850
And that's the point of acceptance,
of voluntary suffering.

486
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,910
That's what that means.
And so you walk through,

487
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:05,893
you can call that a circum ambulation.
You go to all the quarters of the world 

488
00:24:08,991 --> 00:24:11,300
to find yourself.
And so

489
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,990
well the self is,
is the baboon in this particular,

490
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:17,750
in this pr,
I think he's a mandrill actually in this

491
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:20,240
particular representation.
And he lives in the tree.

492
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,130
He lives in the tree of life.
It's a bale,

493
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:23,510
Bab tree,
and this particular,

494
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,463
so he's the spirit that inhabits the 
tree of life and he's the eternal wise 

495
00:24:28,671 --> 00:24:29,870
man.
That's a way of thinking.

496
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:31,550
So is the king,
but he's,

497
00:24:31,551 --> 00:24:35,090
he's sort of a superordinate king or an 
outside king in some sense.

498
00:24:35,091 --> 00:24:39,320
He's the repository of ancient wisdom.
And the king is the manner in which that

499
00:24:39,321 --> 00:24:41,420
wisdom is currently being acted out in 
the world.

500
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,150
And so their friends,
and that means that the king,

501
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:47,360
he's a good king because if they,
if the king was a bad king,

502
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,343
he would be alienated from himself and 
that would make him shallow and one 

503
00:24:51,771 --> 00:24:53,900
dimensional.
And that would make him a bad ruler.

504
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,210
No union with the traditions of the 
past.

505
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,253
To be a good ruler,
you have to rescue your father from the 

506
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:00,344
underworld and integrate that.
And of course that's a main theme in 

507
00:25:03,171 --> 00:25:05,210
this entire movie.
So

508
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,090
hey,
a new mystery to solve.

509
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,340
Okay,
so the hero was born and that's what the

510
00:25:38,341 --> 00:25:40,140
rising sun represents.
And everybody goes,

511
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,160
oh,
isn't that cute?

512
00:25:41,161 --> 00:25:44,490
And the reason for that is because 
you're biologically wired,

513
00:25:44,491 --> 00:25:48,270
especially if you're agreeable to 
respond with caretaking activity to cute

514
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:51,240
to cuteness and cuteness is button,
nose,

515
00:25:51,241 --> 00:25:52,680
big eyes,
small mouth,

516
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,950
roundhead symmetry and helpless 
movements.

517
00:25:55,951 --> 00:25:59,070
And you'll respond to that across the 
entire class of Mammalian,

518
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:01,860
of Mammalian creatures,
even maybe down to lizards.

519
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:03,150
You know,
isn't that cute?

520
00:26:03,151 --> 00:26:04,170
It's no,
it's a lizard.

521
00:26:04,171 --> 00:26:06,590
But you know,
so,

522
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,460
so,
so that's an archetype as well.

523
00:26:08,461 --> 00:26:11,730
That's the archetype of the vulnerable 
hero at bore,

524
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,010
the vulnerable hero,
newly born.

525
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,143
And that should invoke a desire mostly 
on the part of males to encourage and 

526
00:26:19,561 --> 00:26:22,290
mostly on the part of females to neuro 
to nurture.

527
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,160
But males and females are quite cross 
wired among human beings.

528
00:26:26,161 --> 00:26:28,380
And so there's encouragement from the 
women.

529
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,450
And there's also near nurturing from the
man.

530
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,780
And of course those,
those curves in some sense overlap.

531
00:26:33,781 --> 00:26:36,900
So there's more nurturing males and more
encouraging females.

532
00:26:36,901 --> 00:26:37,734
But that's roughly the archetype.
And so he looks cute and everybody goes 

533
00:26:40,471 --> 00:26:41,304
on.
And that's because the animators nailed 

534
00:26:42,511 --> 00:26:43,170
that.
They,

535
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:46,620
the essential features of cuteness and 
he's also in the light,

536
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,483
right?
And so then the Sharman mandrill 

537
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,180
basically baptizes him.
That's essentially what he's doing.

538
00:26:54,181 --> 00:26:56,460
And he uses something that's symbolic of
the sun,

539
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,443
which is this ripe fruit and fruits are 
symbolic of the sun because of course 

540
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:02,790
they need the sun to ripen and they're 
round like the sun.

541
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,460
And so,
and people know that they need light.

542
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,320
But and,
and so anyways,

543
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:08,154
the animators make a relationship 
between the fruit that the Shaman is 

544
00:27:11,971 --> 00:27:15,720
going to break and the sun.
And so he's also being baptized into the

545
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:16,554
sun and that means that he's being 
baptized into the light or that he's 

546
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,820
being transformed into a hero.

547
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,940
And so then everyone's happy and that's 
basically,

548
00:27:23,941 --> 00:27:24,774
you know,
the divine father in the divine mother 

549
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:28,980
and the divine son and the self who's 
taking care of that.

550
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:33,810
And there's a union between the baby and
the wise old man because the baby is all

551
00:27:33,811 --> 00:27:37,350
the potential that's realized in the 
self.

552
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,483
And there's an old idea that the way to 
full maturity is to find what you lost 

553
00:27:43,051 --> 00:27:46,170
as a child had regain it.
It's a brilliant idea.

554
00:27:46,171 --> 00:27:46,790
And that,
that,

555
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,720
that echoes through miss all over the 
world.

556
00:27:48,721 --> 00:27:52,740
And that means you have to regain your 
capacity once you're disciplined and you

557
00:27:52,741 --> 00:27:53,574
know how to do something,
you have to regain your capacity for 

558
00:27:55,261 --> 00:27:56,094
play and sort of for wide eyed wonder.
And that's maybe the child like part of 

559
00:27:59,641 --> 00:28:02,570
your spirit and the reintegration of 
that child,

560
00:28:02,571 --> 00:28:07,571
like part with the adult grownup part 
revivified as the adult grownup part and

561
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:11,520
allows the child to manifest itself in a
disciplined way in the world.

562
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,530
And so that's all being hinted that 
there.

563
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:17,910
And then they show the Sharman shows the
baby,

564
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:18,744
the newborn hero to the crowded.
It's very cool what happens in the 

565
00:28:21,391 --> 00:28:23,490
movie,
all the animals spontaneously,

566
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:24,324
Neil,
and I can give you an example of that 

567
00:28:25,711 --> 00:28:29,190
kind of spontaneous action in a crowd.
So imagine you're watching a

568
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:33,330
gymnastics performance,
right?

569
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,333
And it's like at a high level world 
class performance and someone comes out 

570
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:40,350
there and they do this routine that's 
just dead letter perfect.

571
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:41,184
You know,
and they stop and everybody claps like 

572
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:43,884
mad,
right?

573
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,753
And it's perfect.
And so then the next contestant comes 

574
00:28:46,951 --> 00:28:48,990
out and they're basically in real 
trouble because you know,

575
00:28:48,991 --> 00:28:52,710
this person just got 9.7 out of 10 and 
it was perfect.

576
00:28:52,711 --> 00:28:55,860
So how do you beat perfect.
And so will they come out there and then

577
00:28:55,861 --> 00:28:56,694
you watch them and you're right on the 
edge of your seat because what you see 

578
00:28:58,651 --> 00:29:03,210
them do is something extraordinarily 
disciplined just like the last person to

579
00:29:03,211 --> 00:29:03,600
yet.

580
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,433
But they push themselves into that zone 
that's just beyond their discipline 

581
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:08,124
capacity.
And you can tell every second you're 

582
00:29:09,601 --> 00:29:12,150
watching it that they're that close to 
disaster.

583
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,540
And so you're right on the edge of your 
seat and,

584
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:17,400
and you know that they're doing a high 
wire act without a net.

585
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,950
And so when they finally land 
triumphantly,

586
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,200
you'll all stand up and clap 
spontaneously.

587
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,273
And it's because you've just witnessed 
someone who's a master at playing a 

588
00:29:25,711 --> 00:29:26,544
game,
who's also a master at improving how to 

589
00:29:28,681 --> 00:29:29,514
play that game at the same time.
And people love that more than anything 

590
00:29:32,131 --> 00:29:32,964
to see that it's just absolutely 
overwhelming cause it's a testament to 

591
00:29:35,581 --> 00:29:39,810
the human spirit and you'll respond 
automatically and unconsciously to that.

592
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:40,644
And that's why that's an analogy to why 
the animals all spontaneously bow when 

593
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,833
now what happens is they sh he shows the
lion king and the sun breaks and shines 

594
00:29:50,981 --> 00:29:52,990
on that the hero at the same time.

595
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,033
So there's this concordance between an 
earthly event and as so called heavenly 

596
00:29:57,161 --> 00:29:59,380
event and human would call that 
synchronous.

597
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:04,540
That's his idea of synchronicity where 
something important subjectively is also

598
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:05,374
signified by something that appears in 
narrative keeping with that in the 

599
00:30:08,531 --> 00:30:09,364
outside world.
And it's one of the most controversial 

600
00:30:11,081 --> 00:30:11,914
elements of his theory,
but I've experienced a variety of 

601
00:30:14,261 --> 00:30:16,810
synchronous events and they often happen
in therapy,

602
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:17,973
especially around dreams,
but they're very hard to communicate 

603
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:23,980
because they're so specific to the 
context in which it occurs.

604
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:26,620
They're very difficult to explain.
So anyways,

605
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:30,610
it's the syncronous event that make 
drops all the animals to their knees.

606
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,593
So there's the sun coming out and 
there's shining on them and all the 

607
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,463
primates go mad for that.
And that's of course exactly what we do 

608
00:30:37,811 --> 00:30:41,500
when we applaud and then we switched to 
scar.

609
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:45,580
Now scar is Mufasa's brother evil 
brother.

610
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,460
The king always has an evil brother and 
so does the hero.

611
00:30:48,461 --> 00:30:49,294
The hero always has an adversary and the
reason for that is the king always has 

612
00:30:52,301 --> 00:30:55,900
an evil brother and that means that the 
state always has it.

613
00:30:55,901 --> 00:30:56,734
Tyrannical element.
And the tyrannical element exists for 

614
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:03,670
two reasons.
One is the state deteriorates of its own

615
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:06,670
accord and that's an entropy 
observation.

616
00:31:06,671 --> 00:31:09,940
What that means is that the state is a 
construction of the past,

617
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,953
right?
But the present isn't the same as the 

618
00:31:12,731 --> 00:31:13,564
past.
And to the degree that the past is 

619
00:31:15,701 --> 00:31:17,770
mismatched with the demands of the 
present,

620
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,060
then it's,
then it's,

621
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,880
then it's a tyrannical,
it's malfunctioning.

622
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,090
And so it's,
it's a continual problem with the state.

623
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:27,940
It's always two steps behind the 
environment.

624
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:32,410
And so then that means that the 
awareness of living people has to update

625
00:31:32,411 --> 00:31:34,630
the state.
And so elliot and Murcia,

626
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:36,640
Eliana,
who's a great historian of religions,

627
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,713
looked at flood stories from all over 
the world because there are flood 

628
00:31:39,761 --> 00:31:42,640
stories from all over the world,
partly because there are floods all over

629
00:31:42,641 --> 00:31:43,390
the world.

630
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,640
But that there's a psychological reason 
too.

631
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,420
So you imagine that New Orleans was 
wiped out by a hurricane,

632
00:31:49,421 --> 00:31:50,110
right?
A flood,

633
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:50,681
and you say,
well,

634
00:31:50,681 --> 00:31:52,540
that was an act of God,
but then you think,

635
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:54,040
wait a second,
wait a second.

636
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,010
They knew those damn dikes weren't going
to hold.

637
00:31:57,011 --> 00:31:58,810
They knew they weren't built strong 
enough.

638
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,170
They took the money that was allocated 
to the dikes and spent it badly.

639
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,310
And that was willful blindness.
And so you could say that it was God who

640
00:32:06,311 --> 00:32:08,020
caused the flood,
so to speak,

641
00:32:08,021 --> 00:32:08,854
metaphorically.
But you could also say that it was the 

642
00:32:10,211 --> 00:32:11,044
degeneration of the state and the 
willful blindness of the politicians 

643
00:32:15,311 --> 00:32:16,144
that caused the flood in Holland.
They build the dikes to withstand the 

644
00:32:18,911 --> 00:32:22,660
worst storm in 10,000 years in the use 
other than us.

645
00:32:22,661 --> 00:32:25,480
They built them to withstand the worst 
storm in a hundred years.

646
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,460
And they knew that that was 
insufficient.

647
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:30,130
And so the flood,
if there's a flood,

648
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:31,000
while you can say,
well,

649
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,980
that's an act of nature,
but you can also say,

650
00:32:32,981 --> 00:32:35,320
just wait a sec.
Maybe if there was a flood,

651
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:39,290
because we looked the other way and 
because our systems are out of date,

652
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:43,250
and that's why in flood stories there's,
there's a continual theme,

653
00:32:43,251 --> 00:32:44,084
which is the people get wiped out by the
flood because God judges them harshly 

654
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:52,880
for their senility and they're willful 
blindness.

655
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:56,660
And it's a story that's very much,
you'll have a flood in your life,

656
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,213
right?
It'll be a flood of chaos and you will 

657
00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:03,050
find a of one form or another.
And you'll find when you investigate the

658
00:33:03,051 --> 00:33:05,660
causes of the flood that some of it will
be,

659
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,300
and sometimes this is the case,
it's just random.

660
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,163
You just got singled out,
you got a terrible disease and that's 

661
00:33:11,721 --> 00:33:13,190
the end of you,
or something like that.

662
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:16,430
But there'll be other situations where 
the flood comes and you're surrounded by

663
00:33:16,431 --> 00:33:18,080
chaos and you'll look into it.
You'll think,

664
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,860
I knew this was coming.
I knew I wasn't paying attention.

665
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,873
I knew I hadn't sorted things out.
And the consequences of that will have 

666
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:27,163
cascaded and wiped you out.
And then you're in real trouble because 

667
00:33:29,631 --> 00:33:32,480
not only did you get wiped out,
but you also know it's your fault.

668
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:33,523
And that is not a good thing that makes 
you bitter and resentful and murderous 

669
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:38,690
would not happen.
So anyways,

670
00:33:38,691 --> 00:33:40,910
scar is scarred,
right?

671
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,013
So what that implies is he's had a 
pretty rough life and he's kind of 

672
00:33:44,121 --> 00:33:47,120
skinny and he said he was born in the 
low end of the gene pool.

673
00:33:47,121 --> 00:33:47,954
And so he has reasons to be resentful.
He's also hyper intelligent and 

674
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:51,854
rational.
And it's one of the things you see very 

675
00:33:53,421 --> 00:33:58,070
commonly about the evil adversary of the
state or of the individuals,

676
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,320
often intelligent and hyper rational.

677
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,423
And the best commentator on that was 
probably John Milton in paradise lost 

678
00:34:05,301 --> 00:34:08,420
because that's how he represents Lucifer
or Satan,

679
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:11,090
who's the spirit of rationality and 
enlightenment.

680
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:12,770
Strangely enough,
hence Lucifer,

681
00:34:12,771 --> 00:34:15,320
the bringer of light.
And the reason for that,

682
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:16,154
as far as I can tell them,
this is something that Milton figured 

683
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:18,554
out when he compiled all these ancient 
stories about evil and tried to make 

684
00:34:21,501 --> 00:34:22,334
them coherent,
was that the problem with irrationality 

685
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:29,660
with rationality is that it tends to 
fall in love with its own productions,

686
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:30,883
right?
And so then it comes up with a theory 

687
00:34:31,761 --> 00:34:34,730
and it makes that a totality and then it
won't let go.

688
00:34:34,731 --> 00:34:35,564
So the rational mind has a totalitarian 
element and we know that to some degree 

689
00:34:38,901 --> 00:34:39,734
because that kind of rationality seems 
more left hemisphere focused and the 

690
00:34:43,371 --> 00:34:44,204
left hemisphere tends to impose 
structured order on the world and be 

691
00:34:47,601 --> 00:34:49,370
updated by the right hemisphere.

692
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,700
And the right hemisphere generally 
updates it with negative information and

693
00:34:52,701 --> 00:34:55,850
with fantasy.
And so the left hemisphere will impose a

694
00:34:55,851 --> 00:34:56,684
coherent structure on the world,
which is really necessary for you to 

695
00:34:59,031 --> 00:34:59,864
live in it.
But the problem is there's a tension 

696
00:35:01,521 --> 00:35:02,354
between coherence and completeness.
And that's partly why you need two 

697
00:35:05,181 --> 00:35:06,014
hemispheres.
You need one to represent the world and 

698
00:35:07,671 --> 00:35:12,020
you need one to keep track of the 
exceptions and to feed those slowly into

699
00:35:12,021 --> 00:35:12,854
the representational system so that it 
so that it can stay updated without 

700
00:35:16,191 --> 00:35:19,520
collapsing into complete chaos.
So anyways,

701
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:20,443
scar and he's,
he's got this like droopy mouth in this 

702
00:35:23,241 --> 00:35:26,300
whiny,
arrogant voice and he feels hard done by

703
00:35:26,301 --> 00:35:28,270
and he's resentful and,
and in,

704
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:31,670
in classic hero stories are stories of 
the state as well.

705
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,430
The,
so this is an Egyptian take on it.

706
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,380
Oh,
Cyrus was,

707
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:38,920
was the god of the state and who later 
became Satan,

708
00:35:38,921 --> 00:35:40,500
that name became Satan.

709
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,660
Has It transformed through Coptic 
Christianity?

710
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,830
Oh,
cyrus had a brother named set and set.

711
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,980
He didn't pay attention to set enough 
attention.

712
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:53,340
Instead was always scheming,
scheming to overthrow the kingdom,

713
00:35:53,341 --> 00:35:57,960
just like scar is.
And the Egyptians said straightforwardly

714
00:35:57,961 --> 00:36:00,750
that the reason that oh cyrus got 
overthrown by sad,

715
00:36:00,751 --> 00:36:01,584
he got chopped into pieces and his 
pieces distributed throughout the state 

716
00:36:04,081 --> 00:36:04,914
in the mythological representation.
And those pieces were actually the 

717
00:36:07,741 --> 00:36:10,470
provinces of Egypt,
technically speaking.

718
00:36:10,471 --> 00:36:10,880
So,
and,

719
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,200
and that's what the Egyptians thought.
So that's quite cool.

720
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:18,000
But the Egyptian said explicitly that 
the reason that ocirus got overthrown by

721
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:20,670
set was because he was willfully blind,
old,

722
00:36:20,671 --> 00:36:22,230
senile,
and willfully blind.

723
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,213
Same idea as the flood myth.
You don't see that quite here because 

724
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:31,220
Mufasa is sort of on to set or to scar,
but scar is more treacherous than Mo.

725
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,303
Fasa believes and he gets that.
He gets at who Fossa by going through 

726
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:36,294
his son.

727
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,370
Bye Bye.
By playing on the,

728
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:42,180
on the impulsivity and juvenile 
qualities of his son.

729
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,373
And so obviously there's some antagonism
between these two as you can see by 

730
00:36:46,741 --> 00:36:51,120
their facial expressions there.
And there's the good example of scar.

731
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:51,954
You know,
he's got that droopy kind of whiny 

732
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:54,203
malevolent face and that malevolent 
voice that Jeremy Irons pulls it off so 

733
00:36:57,211 --> 00:36:59,880
incredibly well.
And he's,

734
00:36:59,881 --> 00:37:02,250
he's always skulking,
he's a creature of the night.

735
00:37:02,251 --> 00:37:03,084
He always skulks around.
He's not a creature of the day in any 

736
00:37:05,401 --> 00:37:07,200
sense of the word.
And you know,

737
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:08,543
obviously Mufasa is golden,
like the sun and scars dark like the 

738
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,590
night.
That's another thing,

739
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,970
another clue.
Another hint.

740
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,920
Okay,
there's the tree.

741
00:37:16,921 --> 00:37:19,170
That's the tree of life.
We already talked about that.

742
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,213
I think that represents the multiple 
levels at which you exist 

743
00:37:22,831 --> 00:37:25,350
simultaneously,
all the way from the Subatomic,

744
00:37:25,351 --> 00:37:27,390
all the way up to the cosmic,
so to speak.

745
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,160
And that's a different kind of 
dimension.

746
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:30,203
And that's the,
that's the place that the self inhabits 

747
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:34,530
and it can kind of move up and down 
those dimensions.

748
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:38,600
But anyways,
that the Sharman lives inside that tree.

749
00:37:38,601 --> 00:37:42,390
And,
and I was our first introduction to him,

750
00:37:42,391 --> 00:37:44,910
basically,
but he's the spirit of the ancient tree.

751
00:37:44,911 --> 00:37:46,710
That's another way of thinking about a 
very,

752
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:48,960
very common element in stories,
right?

753
00:37:48,961 --> 00:37:51,390
The spirit of the ancient tree.
And so,

754
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:52,650
all right,
so now,

755
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,510
uh,
Mufasa has taken,

756
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,450
taken Simba up to the top of the 
pyramid,

757
00:37:57,451 --> 00:37:58,370
right?
So that's the,

758
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,970
the aluminum place,
let's say,

759
00:37:59,971 --> 00:38:00,804
or the place of the eye where you can 
really see a long ways and he's 

760
00:38:03,811 --> 00:38:06,240
explaining to him what his kingdom is 
going to be.

761
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,420
And you see the sun of course appears at
that to begin with.

762
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:11,490
And that's another hint about being at 
the top.

763
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,830
That's the illuminated part of the 
pyramid.

764
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:14,993
And so they're up there talking.
And what Mufasa tells Simba is that his 

765
00:38:18,151 --> 00:38:20,940
kingdom is every place the light has 
touched.

766
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,133
And that's so brilliant.
So one of the things you'll notice if 

767
00:38:24,241 --> 00:38:27,000
you move into a new apartment,
you're like a cat.

768
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:27,923
Cats don't like changing houses and they
have to zoom around in every corner to 

769
00:38:30,871 --> 00:38:34,470
see exactly what the hell is going on 
there before they calm down.

770
00:38:34,471 --> 00:38:37,750
They need to know they can hide and 
where the potential dangers are.

771
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:38,943
And what you'll find if you move into a 
new place that you will not be 

772
00:38:41,021 --> 00:38:43,540
comfortable there until you've 
investigated,

773
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:47,590
potentially cleaned and repaired every 
single square inch of it,

774
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,610
the more attention you pay to it,
the more it will become yours.

775
00:38:51,611 --> 00:38:54,730
And that's far more than mirror,
like material ownership,

776
00:38:54,731 --> 00:38:55,564
which is also relevant.
But in order to feel comfortable 

777
00:38:57,971 --> 00:39:02,680
somewhere and to dominate that place,
to be in meshed in that place,

778
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:04,090
you have to attend to it.

779
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:04,923
You have to shine light on every corner 
and you have to do that with yourself 

780
00:39:08,201 --> 00:39:10,840
and with your relationships as well.
And so anyways,

781
00:39:10,841 --> 00:39:15,380
Mufasa tells Simba that his kingdom is 
everything that the light shines on.

782
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,100
And that's exactly right.
And then there's a metaphor there too,

783
00:39:18,101 --> 00:39:20,710
which is that what you've shown light 
on,

784
00:39:20,711 --> 00:39:21,544
which is what you've come to understand 
and master is surrounded by an other 

785
00:39:24,491 --> 00:39:27,130
world of all the things that you don't 
understand.

786
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,293
And some of those would be natural 
things and some of them would be 

787
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:30,784
tyrannical things.
And some of those would be things you 

788
00:39:32,561 --> 00:39:33,394
don't want to know about yourself,
but they're outside of where you've 

789
00:39:35,771 --> 00:39:36,604
managed to shine the light.
And so that's exactly what Mufasa tells 

790
00:39:38,951 --> 00:39:39,784
Simba.
He says,

791
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:42,040
we live in this pyramid,
we're at the top.

792
00:39:42,041 --> 00:39:45,550
There's a domain of light around it 
that's explored territory.

793
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,730
Outside of that,
there's explore unexplored territory.

794
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,773
And that's partly the unconscious 
because you fill it with fantasy and 

795
00:39:52,541 --> 00:39:57,460
it's partly what you just don't know.
And then move fossa tells Simba and it's

796
00:39:57,461 --> 00:40:01,780
sort of like God telling Adam and Eve in
the garden of Eden not to eat the apple.

797
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:05,770
Mufasa tells Simba there's this outside 
place that's dark,

798
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,100
that's not part of your kingdom and you 
should not go there.

799
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:12,580
And that's really interesting because 
Simba doesn't even know about that place

800
00:40:12,581 --> 00:40:13,414
yet.
And so Mufasa is doing something very 

801
00:40:15,521 --> 00:40:16,354
contradictory there.
It's like telling them that it exists 

802
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,183
and heightening his curiosity,
but also saying that he should go there 

803
00:40:22,571 --> 00:40:26,410
almost ensuring that that's exactly what
Simba is going to do.

804
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:31,420
You See this in the Pinocchio Movie to 
where Pinocchio is planning to jump into

805
00:40:31,421 --> 00:40:32,254
the ocean to go get uh,
Japan from the underworld and he's 

806
00:40:36,131 --> 00:40:38,170
following his conscience is along with 
them.

807
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:39,003
Jimminy cricket and the cricket is 
warning him about all the dangers that 

808
00:40:41,671 --> 00:40:45,460
he'll face down there and telling him 
that he will be fish food personally.

809
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,533
And while he's doing that,
Pinocchio ties a knot around his donkey 

810
00:40:49,271 --> 00:40:50,104
tail around rock so he can sink and the 
little cricket helps them tie the 

811
00:40:53,231 --> 00:40:54,064
naughts.
So while he's warning them about the 

812
00:40:55,571 --> 00:40:57,550
adventure he's going to undertake,
at the same time,

813
00:40:57,551 --> 00:41:00,670
he's encouraging to do it.
And there's that paradoxical thing,

814
00:41:00,671 --> 00:41:02,920
which is that if you go outside what you
know,

815
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:03,754
it will cause a fall because it'll 
damage your knowledge structures and 

816
00:41:06,821 --> 00:41:09,670
you'll go down into chaos and that can 
really destroy you.

817
00:41:09,671 --> 00:41:12,220
So you shouldn't do it.
But by the same token,

818
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:14,320
if you do do it and you do it 
successfully,

819
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:15,363
then the new you that arises can be 
stronger and more complete than the 

820
00:41:18,701 --> 00:41:19,480
previous youth.

821
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,760
So you should do it and you shouldn't do
it.

822
00:41:21,761 --> 00:41:24,190
And that's anyone sensible says,
look,

823
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:25,510
don't bother.
Right,

824
00:41:25,511 --> 00:41:27,610
but sensible isn't enough.
That's the thing.

825
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:31,210
You have to also be not sensible enough 
in order to live.

826
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:32,223
And your typical hero and potter's a 
really good example is always a rule 

827
00:41:35,331 --> 00:41:37,280
breaker always.
But he,

828
00:41:37,281 --> 00:41:38,114
you know,
the rules he breaks are like there's 

829
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:40,964
judiciousness behind the rule.
Breaking the hero breaks a rule in the 

830
00:41:44,601 --> 00:41:47,180
service of a higher good,
but he's still breaking the rules.

831
00:41:47,181 --> 00:41:48,014
And that's what puts him outside the 
boundary of the social of the social 

832
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,010
establishment.
So

833
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,553
now at this point,
Simba also gets introduced to scar and 

834
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:58,933
that,
that,

835
00:41:58,940 --> 00:41:59,773
that has two meanings.
One is that scar is the tyrannical 

836
00:42:02,001 --> 00:42:04,520
element of the state.
And so as a child,

837
00:42:04,521 --> 00:42:05,354
when you're being socialized,
you encounter the tyranny of the state 

838
00:42:08,121 --> 00:42:09,710
and one of the best,
you can't,

839
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,820
there's no way around it.

840
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,193
One of the best examples of that is that
children are always running around 

841
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:16,130
having fun and they're really bubbly 
and,

842
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:21,290
and impulsive and joyous and playful.
And that causes a lot of trouble because

843
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,710
positive emotion is very disruptive.
They'll run around and break things,

844
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,810
they'll hurt themselves and they'll get 
into trouble.

845
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,240
And so you're always saying,
calm down,

846
00:42:29,241 --> 00:42:30,380
sit down,
behave,

847
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,214
don't do that.
And it's not because they're crying or 

848
00:42:32,901 --> 00:42:33,734
angry,
it's because they're so damn happy and 

849
00:42:35,211 --> 00:42:39,500
impulsive that no one could stand them.
And so and so that's a tyranny.

850
00:42:39,501 --> 00:42:41,120
It's like that.
The state puts,

851
00:42:41,121 --> 00:42:43,550
puts pressure on you to regulate your 
emotions,

852
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,040
positive,
negative and positive,

853
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,290
and it crushes you.
It crushes the life out of you,

854
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:50,090
a lot of it.
And so you end up,

855
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:50,953
you know,
your age and you're all mopey because 

856
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,290
the whole,
especially because you've been forced to

857
00:42:54,291 --> 00:42:58,940
sit down in school for like 17 years,
you're all mopey and it's no wonder,

858
00:42:58,941 --> 00:42:59,774
you know,
you've had the spirit taken out of you 

859
00:43:00,741 --> 00:43:01,574
by the process of discipline,
but without that you'd be completely 

860
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:04,490
useless.

861
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,980
So it's another one of those 
paradoxical,

862
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,720
you know,
gifts.

863
00:43:08,721 --> 00:43:09,554
And,
and catastrophes that you encounter as 

864
00:43:11,421 --> 00:43:13,280
you move through life.
So anyways,

865
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:14,990
Simba,
look at how happy he is.

866
00:43:14,991 --> 00:43:15,621
You know,
I mean,

867
00:43:15,621 --> 00:43:17,780
he doesn't know a damn thing.
He's so naive.

868
00:43:17,781 --> 00:43:19,190
You can tell by,
oh look,

869
00:43:19,191 --> 00:43:20,900
it's so my uncle scar.
It's like,

870
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,093
you know,
and this is not a guy you smile at 

871
00:43:23,991 --> 00:43:24,824
clearly,
but he's all positive emotion and joy 

872
00:43:27,381 --> 00:43:28,214
and enthusiasm.
And that's not good because that means 

873
00:43:30,261 --> 00:43:32,570
this character can take serious 
advantage of it.

874
00:43:32,571 --> 00:43:36,590
And that's exactly what he does.
And so scarp pretends to be on his side,

875
00:43:36,591 --> 00:43:38,360
which is what a good pedophile always 
does,

876
00:43:38,361 --> 00:43:39,920
by the way.
And so,

877
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:40,810
you know,
you,

878
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:44,630
you take advantage of the child's 
trusting nature and openness in order to

879
00:43:44,631 --> 00:43:45,770
exploit them.
And that's,

880
00:43:45,771 --> 00:43:48,080
that's what horrible people do that all 
the time,

881
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:51,530
including the parents of children and 
other children themselves.

882
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,880
So,
you know,

883
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:54,350
there's this false,
I've been looking at,

884
00:43:54,351 --> 00:43:56,360
the animators are so damn brilliant,
hey,

885
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,910
look at that expression,
really like,

886
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,500
you know,
you just look at that and you think,

887
00:44:00,501 --> 00:44:02,120
well,
that's just a facial expression.

888
00:44:02,121 --> 00:44:05,360
But of course it's not.
Some damn animators worked a really hard

889
00:44:05,361 --> 00:44:06,194
to get that.
They're really observant and they 

890
00:44:07,791 --> 00:44:10,070
distill the facial looks,
look how big the face is,

891
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,120
right?
It covers the whole head and,

892
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,810
and they,
they've got the eyebrow lifts proper and

893
00:44:14,811 --> 00:44:18,740
they've got this horrible sanctimonious 
smile and the tilt of the head then,

894
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:19,813
you know,
and he sort of crushing him while he's 

895
00:44:21,051 --> 00:44:23,180
hugging them at the same time.
Really,

896
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:24,380
really.
And you know,

897
00:44:24,381 --> 00:44:25,214
it took a lot of thought for every 
single one of these frames to be put 

898
00:44:27,561 --> 00:44:28,340
together.
Right.

899
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:31,440
There's a tremendous amount of cognitive
effort that went that.

900
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,150
So none of this is accidental.

901
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:35,220
Yeah.
Well that pretty much says everything.

902
00:44:35,221 --> 00:44:36,054
It's like,
I hate that kid could hardly wait until 

903
00:44:38,251 --> 00:44:41,040
he's gone and didn't die.
Pull one over on them.

904
00:44:41,041 --> 00:44:41,874
You know,
it's a real testament to an adult's 

905
00:44:43,111 --> 00:44:47,640
genius when he can fool a kid.
So then Simba encounters the anima.

906
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:48,743
That's the anima,
the Union Anima and the Anima is the 

907
00:44:51,301 --> 00:44:54,900
feminine counterpart in the soul.
And she,

908
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,510
well yeah,
you could tell what she does to him,

909
00:44:57,511 --> 00:44:58,344
right?
Because she's got this super silly 

910
00:44:59,821 --> 00:45:00,654
ascend and what would you say?
Judgemental and Teasey look on her face 

911
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,990
and she's really tried to put him down 
and it's working like bad.

912
00:45:06,991 --> 00:45:10,050
He's not very happy about that at all.
And she's the thing,

913
00:45:10,051 --> 00:45:12,000
this is what the enema does,
the soul,

914
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,260
she's the thing that teaches the 
exploratory hero that,

915
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:19,020
that it's not everything it could be.
Right.

916
00:45:19,021 --> 00:45:21,780
And that's part of this can be read 
multiple ways,

917
00:45:21,781 --> 00:45:22,614
but it's part of the eternal tendency of
women to make men self conscious by 

918
00:45:26,671 --> 00:45:28,080
their sexual subjectivity.

919
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:31,740
That's part of it because that makes men
self conscious like nothing else.

920
00:45:31,741 --> 00:45:32,574
And it's also perhaps being one of the 
phenomena that's produced the 

921
00:45:35,341 --> 00:45:38,220
evolutionary arms race in this,
in this sex,

922
00:45:38,221 --> 00:45:41,850
is it among human beings that's caused 
our rapid cortical expansion and our,

923
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,760
our,
our quick movement away from chimpanzees

924
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,690
who aren't selective majors by the way.
So look at him.

925
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,250
Jesus,
he just want to slap him,

926
00:45:50,251 --> 00:45:51,120
right?
He's uh,

927
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,310
he's the son of a king,
so he's very,

928
00:45:53,311 --> 00:45:56,580
very privileged and he confuses his 
privilege with competence.

929
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:57,683
Richard,
of course all of you do because you are 

930
00:45:58,651 --> 00:45:59,484
all sons of the king,
which is why you can sit here in the 

931
00:46:00,961 --> 00:46:01,794
university and you confuse your 
privilege with competence as well 

932
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:06,203
because it's not,
has nothing to do with any of you that 

933
00:46:08,521 --> 00:46:10,710
the lights are on and it's place is so 
peaceful.

934
00:46:10,711 --> 00:46:12,810
Right?
But you take that for granted and it can

935
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:15,540
make you false and arrogant like,
like Jesus.

936
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,670
That's just so sad.
You look at that kid,

937
00:46:17,671 --> 00:46:19,900
you think he's,
he's in for real trouble,

938
00:46:19,901 --> 00:46:21,630
man.
He thinks he knows everything.

939
00:46:21,631 --> 00:46:24,330
And of course that he has a wrestling 
match with,

940
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,940
what's her name?
What's it,

941
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,680
was it Nala?
Yeah,

942
00:46:28,681 --> 00:46:31,620
it has a wrestling match with knowledge.
She just pins him every time.

943
00:46:31,621 --> 00:46:32,460
Right.
Gotcha.

944
00:46:32,461 --> 00:46:33,294
Again,
pinned the again and that's basically 

945
00:46:34,921 --> 00:46:35,754
right.
One of the things that happens with men 

946
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,130
when they meet a woman who they really 
desire and admires,

947
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,600
they project an ideal onto her 
immediately.

948
00:46:42,601 --> 00:46:44,580
That's an anima projection.
And then that Adam,

949
00:46:44,581 --> 00:46:47,520
a projection judges them and they act 
all inferior and stupid.

950
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:49,860
And it's partly because they are,
that's why.

951
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:51,083
And so then they go down in defeat 
constantly to this thing that they're 

952
00:46:54,661 --> 00:46:57,030
projecting,
which at least has some concordance with

953
00:46:57,031 --> 00:46:58,830
the actual woman,
but not that much.

954
00:46:59,220 --> 00:46:59,851
So,
okay,

955
00:46:59,851 --> 00:47:02,880
they keep wrestling and then they're on 
the fringe of the kingdom.

956
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:03,713
This wrestling match between this pairs 
of opposites takes them to the edge of 

957
00:47:07,261 --> 00:47:09,660
the kingdom and they end up in the 
elephants' graveyard.

958
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:10,920
Right?
And,

959
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,750
and there's,
there's bones everywhere.

960
00:47:12,751 --> 00:47:14,700
And so now they're out into the Kingdom 
of death.

961
00:47:14,701 --> 00:47:17,880
And what that means is that these two 
kids,

962
00:47:17,881 --> 00:47:19,890
as they've grown up,
encountered death,

963
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,440
right?
They go outside the light and it's very,

964
00:47:22,441 --> 00:47:25,320
very shocking for them.
They're very curious about it.

965
00:47:25,321 --> 00:47:28,380
Obviously they go to explore the 
skeletons and all of that,

966
00:47:28,381 --> 00:47:30,880
even though they were not to,
but their curiosity,

967
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:34,600
they can't stay away from death.
There are too curious about it.

968
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:37,150
And so they develop knowledge of death 
and that.

969
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,400
And then of course out there in the 
dead,

970
00:47:39,401 --> 00:47:41,860
lounds is where the hyenas are.
And that's exactly right.

971
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:43,510
Cause Hyenas are scavengers,
right?

972
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:45,460
And they can break bones with their 
teeth.

973
00:47:45,461 --> 00:47:47,890
They're really,
really quite the animal.

974
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:50,740
And you know,
you kind of have a shudder of repugnance

975
00:47:50,741 --> 00:47:53,050
when you see those things.
And I think it's partly,

976
00:47:53,051 --> 00:47:55,570
I mean,
we shared an evolutionary landscape with

977
00:47:55,571 --> 00:47:58,180
the ancestors of hyenas for a very,
very long time.

978
00:47:58,181 --> 00:47:59,830
And like vultures too,
you know,

979
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,450
you couldn't imagine something that 
would be more well designed to look like

980
00:48:04,451 --> 00:48:07,180
it was a horrible thing than a vulture.
Right.

981
00:48:07,181 --> 00:48:08,014
And there's this weird concordance and 
crows and ravens are like that to carry 

982
00:48:11,411 --> 00:48:12,250
an eaters.
You know,

983
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:13,503
eagles are kind of an exception,
but they look just as creepy as they 

984
00:48:15,881 --> 00:48:17,980
are,
which is really quite interesting.

985
00:48:17,981 --> 00:48:21,220
And of course hyenas fall into that 
category and they laugh too,

986
00:48:21,221 --> 00:48:22,330
which is,
you know,

987
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:23,403
really you,
you also have to laugh really with all 

988
00:48:25,691 --> 00:48:27,340
these other things you have going for 
you.

989
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:28,453
And anyways,
the hyenas and hyenas are enemies of 

990
00:48:30,371 --> 00:48:32,860
lions and they can take lions down their
tough things.

991
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:35,440
And you know,
they're not one hyena obviously,

992
00:48:35,441 --> 00:48:38,500
but a bunch of hyenas can give a line 
and pretty damn rough time.

993
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:39,753
And so,
and these little lines are really no 

994
00:48:41,771 --> 00:48:44,590
match for the hyenas.
And so they get threatened very,

995
00:48:44,591 --> 00:48:46,980
very rapidly.
And one of the hygienists,

996
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:49,030
of course,
it's just completely out of its mind.

997
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:50,283
And one of the things that's really 
interesting and you see this with the 

998
00:48:52,481 --> 00:48:54,760
muppets too,
there was often a puppet that was like a

999
00:48:54,761 --> 00:48:57,400
crazy puppet and its eyes would move in 
different directions.

1000
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:58,563
You know,
and one of the things that happens with 

1001
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:02,410
people who are schizophrenia as they 
show involuntary eye movements,

1002
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:03,513
and it's because you have a brain center
that controls your eyes voluntarily and 

1003
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:08,830
you have another one that controls them 
in voluntarily.

1004
00:49:08,831 --> 00:49:09,664
So you can see that look ahead and try 
to move your eyes smoothly back and 

1005
00:49:12,821 --> 00:49:13,510
forth.

1006
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:15,370
You can't do it.
You'll see that they jerk,

1007
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:16,660
hey,
but if you watch,

1008
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:19,360
put a finger in front of your face and 
then do this,

1009
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:20,463
they'll move perfectly smoothly.
And that's because you're using 

1010
00:49:22,391 --> 00:49:26,350
different eye control centers,
one voluntary and one more involuntary.

1011
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,990
And the involuntary one is actually more
sophisticated.

1012
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:33,460
And so in schizophrenia,
the involuntary eye control centers tend

1013
00:49:33,461 --> 00:49:36,100
to disrupt the voluntary eye control 
centers.

1014
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:39,640
And that's likely part of the 
hallucinatory process,

1015
00:49:39,641 --> 00:49:40,474
you know,
because you have the ego in the 

1016
00:49:41,691 --> 00:49:42,524
schizophrenia that's being disrupted by 
processes underneath fantasies and that 

1017
00:49:45,911 --> 00:49:49,090
sort of thing that looks like it's 
reflected in involuntary eye movements,

1018
00:49:49,091 --> 00:49:50,530
like,
like dream movements.

1019
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:51,693
So anyways,
so much for the crazy hyena and they're 

1020
00:49:54,011 --> 00:49:54,844
in real trouble now the kings I who's 
supposed to be keeping an eye on this 

1021
00:49:57,401 --> 00:50:00,220
and we're supposed to be watching Simba 
is trying to intervene,

1022
00:50:00,221 --> 00:50:03,190
but I mean look at him,
he's like delicious little bird.

1023
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:06,550
And so that's not working out very well 
anyways.

1024
00:50:06,551 --> 00:50:11,551
And then you see this immediate 
juxtaposition of the domain of death and

1025
00:50:12,011 --> 00:50:14,080
the hyenas with hell,
right?

1026
00:50:14,081 --> 00:50:15,490
And everyone looks at that and they 
think,

1027
00:50:15,491 --> 00:50:15,810
well,
they,

1028
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:16,643
they know exactly what that means.
It's no surprise to anyone that that 

1029
00:50:18,821 --> 00:50:19,654
happens.
And I suppose that's partly because on 

1030
00:50:21,731 --> 00:50:26,731
the velt where we evolved in large part,
but not by no means all part fire was an

1031
00:50:26,771 --> 00:50:28,940
ever present danger in the grasslands.
Right.

1032
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:30,500
And so,
and so,

1033
00:50:30,501 --> 00:50:31,940
uh,
that's a good,

1034
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:34,370
that's a good example of hail.
So,

1035
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:36,920
Huh.
Well

1036
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:39,343
I guess that's it.
We'll do some more of this when we meet 

1037
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,920
on Tuesday.
Bye.
