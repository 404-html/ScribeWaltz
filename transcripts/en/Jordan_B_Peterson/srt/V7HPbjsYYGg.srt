1
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,870
[inaudible] [inaudible]

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,030
I haven't seen people since the last 
time I was.

3
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,040
I was originally planning to speak to 
you about responsibility.

4
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:28,623
I wanted to suggest that you should be 
leery of trusting people whose primary 

5
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:34,744
concern here's to be their own rights or
the rights of the hypothetically 

6
00:00:38,711 --> 00:00:39,544
oppressed groups that they 
hypothetically could by no means 

7
00:00:42,011 --> 00:00:45,940
necessarily to speak for.
It's still want to do that.

8
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,830
It's better for young people to 
concentrate on the responsibility rather

9
00:00:50,831 --> 00:00:54,790
than the rights they've been cared for 
all their lives,

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,713
but other people being as of yet unable 
to give back to the world what it takes 

11
00:00:59,771 --> 00:01:00,604
to mature their survival.
It's not merely initiative obligation 

12
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:06,640
either.
Young people,

13
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,593
not only young people need meaning in 
their lives as well as do regard from 

14
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:12,304
others.
Meaning is to be following in 

15
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:14,974
responsibility.
People find meaning and the 

16
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:19,720
responsibility of their careers,
their families,

17
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:21,380
their friends,
the chairman,

18
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:24,580
the work they do for others,
the education they pursued,

19
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,533
the voluntary obligations they undertake
and the suffering they endeavor to 

20
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:29,974
reduce.

21
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:34,750
It's not the rights that are granted to 
you by others so that you can be awarded

22
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:35,584
your rewards and privileges that will 
make your limited and mortal life 

23
00:01:39,131 --> 00:01:41,470
worthwhile.
It is.

24
00:01:41,471 --> 00:01:42,304
Instead,
the sacrifices you make to the highest 

25
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:47,650
good that you can conceptualize and 
strive to attain.

26
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:53,130
Beware the peddlers of rights and wish 
to turn you into someone who is similar,

27
00:01:54,151 --> 00:01:54,870
Tanium,
asleep,

28
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:59,020
privileged and victimized.
Why narcissistic,

29
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,180
noisy,
demanding,

30
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,770
chronically unhappy and of little use to
themselves or other people.

31
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,703
Instead,
sort yourselves out shoulder your 

32
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:14,170
responsibilities,
make yourself useful to others.

33
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,573
Find the heaviest burden you can bear 
and bear it stoically forthrightly and 

34
00:02:20,411 --> 00:02:21,244
admirably.

35
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,280
Having dealt with that,
I'll turn it to something that I believe

36
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:30,730
is more pressing.
You're all here because you're concerned

37
00:02:30,731 --> 00:02:31,564
about the future.
I'm concerned about the future too 

38
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,780
because of that concern.
I feel it necessary to say a few words,

39
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,153
which I'm still trying to formulate 
properly about the newest form of 

40
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:45,520
political pathology to manifest itself 
in this.

41
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:46,354
Our district,
they confused in chaotic Western 

42
00:02:48,071 --> 00:02:50,020
society.
Truly.

43
00:02:50,021 --> 00:02:52,750
However,
I should not say newest.

44
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:58,420
I should stay say in stamp the 
resurgence of an exceptionally dangerous

45
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,283
logically and thoroughly discredited 
older ideal one the dude entire 

46
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:09,710
societies and huge populations to 
unnecessary suffering and the bloody and

47
00:03:09,711 --> 00:03:12,820
done fortunate and all too forgotten 
from 20th century.

48
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,853
The idea equality,
the reasonable value placed among other 

49
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:21,970
values,
but again the dog,

50
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,823
but he only made it to the highest place
and promoted blindly later with an 

51
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:28,150
undertone,
undeserved,

52
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:29,640
nuorder,
Devon's resentment,

53
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,140
jealousy spike in hate.

54
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,280
It's not just equality and it's more of 
Banal.

55
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,770
Next prestige is not merely equality of 
opportunity.

56
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:43,771
To say that I don't talk about what 
equity and quality of outcome,

57
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,140
the ultimate can rapid wolf in the most 
caring,

58
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:50,720
the sheep's clothing.
It's line of equity is being raised as a

59
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,620
group and it's the very social justice 
warriors,

60
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,573
the very postmodern,
neo Marxists activist activists whose 

61
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:59,260
words I despise.
We're waiving it everywhere.

62
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,560
The danger,
this presents can barely be overstated.

63
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:08,200
It needs to be stopped.
When I spoke at mcmaster university last

64
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,033
year,
the profane chapters students under the 

65
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,124
spell of the reprehensible professors,
ideological idiocy insisted 

66
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:19,330
repetitively.
This is where we draw the line.

67
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:24,310
This is where we draw the line.
This is where we draw the line referring

68
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:25,144
to my hypothetical bigotry and uncaring 
attitude towards the individuals they 

69
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,363
reported to represent.
Today I want to draw a line of my own 

70
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,240
and I encourage you to join me.

71
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,073
In doing so,
we have to bring the confused 

72
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,333
historically ignorant and resentful 
purveyors of the terrible doctrine of 

73
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,760
equality,
of outcome to a halt.

74
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:46,923
We have to draw a line before the 
functional structures that make up our 

75
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:53,200
society,
our underminded damaged beyond repair.

76
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,920
So I'm going to talk to you today about 
the great errors,

77
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:57,754
the self,
righteously caring attitude of the 

78
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:00,364
equity purveyors hide within the 
confines of their low resolution in 

79
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:08,050
cautious elder,
rhythmic ideological propaganda.

80
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,663
I cannot present a complete argument,
but I can at least help like the 

81
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:16,060
territory that must be mapped in more 
detail and publicize broadly

82
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,483
for Dan takes hypothetically well 
meaning people on the left had been 

83
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:22,834
beating the drum for a society where 
equality of opportunity is the norm by 

84
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,053
large.
This is also a goal supported by people 

85
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:32,200
in the political center and on the 
right.

86
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,640
Society is better served in individuals,
better provided with the means of moving

87
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:41,620
forward forthrightly and with hope when 
arbitrary impediments to the realization

88
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:45,550
of their abilities are eliminated to the
degree that is possible.

89
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:47,883
However,
even the elimination of inequities 

90
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,680
related to opportunity is something that
must be attempted with all new carer.

91
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,103
The ability to raise children 
thoughtfully and carefully and to 

92
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:02,420
provide them with high quality 
education,

93
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,283
social networks and the opportunity to 
develop their own skills and interests 

94
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,980
is not something equally distributed 
among all parents.

95
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:11,723
It's beans that some children will be 
provided with opportunities that others 

96
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,273
will lack.
Governmental or other organizations may 

97
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:19,940
attempt to provide redress for such 
inequality,

98
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,983
but that's done at some risk.
A substantial proportion of what has 

99
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:28,850
done positively for children and good 
families occurs at such a young age.

100
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,773
The government intervention,
however well meaning would mean 

101
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:35,830
invasion,
occupation and colonization of the sound

102
00:06:35,831 --> 00:06:39,380
salmon to a degree like they do produce 
negative consequences.

103
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,620
It's far outweigh whatever positive good
might be done.

104
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,490
A good rule is done.
It might be that nervous society,

105
00:06:45,491 --> 00:06:46,324
you should strive to do whatever good to
be done for disadvantaged children and 

106
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:50,510
their parents.

107
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,230
It does not civil tediously interfere 
with or make more difficult.

108
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,093
The Goodman is already being done by 
parents who are skilled and fortunate 

109
00:06:58,161 --> 00:06:58,994
enough to do the demanding job in an 
admirable and socially productive 

110
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:02,954
manner.
Substandard debate between those on the 

111
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:06,104
left interested in broad scale social 
interventions to improve life quality 

112
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:10,723
for those who are less fortunate and 
those on the right who wish to protect 

113
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:17,540
and maintain the integrity and the 
rights of the family must continue.

114
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:18,374
I'm cramming so that the dangers that 
lurk on the unmoderated extremes can be 

115
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:25,460
minimized.
We don't want to let any children suffer

116
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:29,060
unnecessarily.
We don't want the abilities and skills.

117
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:31,910
They might develop an offer to society 
to be wasted,

118
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,403
but we don't want impersonal,
large scale systems suffering from the 

119
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:38,264
pathologies of gigantism to interfere 
with the function of the basic family 

120
00:07:42,051 --> 00:07:42,884
unit,
which despite me to this inadequacies 

121
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:48,770
has yet to be replaced.
Even conceptually I anything remotely as

122
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:49,604
functional.

123
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,190
Okay.

124
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,023
The provision of universal secondary and
to a degree postsecondary education has 

125
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:57,174
11th the planes deal substantially.
The safety net provided by universal 

126
00:08:01,631 --> 00:08:05,720
healthcare plays the same role as does 
the offering of old age pension,

127
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,250
disability allowances,
unemployment insurance and welfare.

128
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:10,863
Although individuals across the 
political spectrum continue to debate 

129
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:14,434
the details of size and implementation 
associated with such benefits of income 

130
00:08:18,461 --> 00:08:21,760
redistribution,
there is substantial agreement among all

131
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:23,590
regarding the essential utility.

132
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,000
It might be also noted that there are 
conservative as well as liberal and left

133
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:33,970
wing arguments to be made in favor of 
some flattening of income inequality.

134
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,223
The data indicating that serious crime 
including most important they nail on 

135
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,393
male homicide,
maybe driven to levels that threatened 

136
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:43,654
social stability when inequality 
increases beyond some hypothetical 

137
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:47,734
optimum are solid and persuasive.
Thus there is a case to be made for 

138
00:08:51,941 --> 00:08:52,774
enhanced social stability through the 
intelligent of at least opportunity and 

139
00:08:57,091 --> 00:08:57,924
perhaps I didn't come stuff as well as 
the case that is made by more or less 

140
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:04,470
bleeding individuals on behalf of 
abstract fairness.

141
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:08,700
Nonetheless,
there are already questionable practices

142
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:11,910
associated with improvement of the 
quality of opportunity,

143
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,730
of equality,
of opportunity that it be set in place.

144
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:15,564
In addition to those over you noted,
these include most particular the so 

145
00:09:19,261 --> 00:09:20,094
called affirmative action programs that 
have become almost universally 

146
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:23,664
instantiated into higher replaced within
promotion processes that characterize 

147
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:27,684
most large,
large modern institutions in place 

148
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:35,640
theoretically to provide redress for 
historical inequalities.

149
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,553
Shows is the history of slavery that 
characterize the American black 

150
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:39,744
population some six generations ago.
Perhaps a case can be named for such 

151
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:45,474
things as well,
although they are associated with clear 

152
00:09:47,101 --> 00:09:47,934
dangers.
The most egregious of these is the 

153
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:50,514
insistence tied it.
Take me to the claims of those enamored 

154
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:55,644
with postmodern identity politics that 
certain group oriented aspects of human 

155
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:01,710
identities such as race,
sex,

156
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,693
and now sexual proclivity of gender 
identity are sufficiently real and 

157
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:09,030
important.
So the judgment of people on the grounds

158
00:10:09,031 --> 00:10:09,864
of the individual competence alone 
should be suspended in favor of ill 

159
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:13,974
defined.
Planes of social justice are the minor 

160
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:17,214
and these include statements in job 
postings indicating that applications 

161
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:21,234
from individuals with certain specified 
group level attributes are particularly 

162
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:26,004
welcome.
What dangers are associated with such 

163
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:31,230
practices?
Well,

164
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,153
the first is that specified particular 
welcome on the part of some groups 

165
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:36,954
clearly implies less welcome on the part
of others as the postmodern theorists 

166
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:41,754
who push such things forward would be 
first to point out such thinkers 

167
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,044
constantly make the claim that value 
structure is by necessity exclude and 

168
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:50,910
should be flattened.

169
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,743
For that reason they don't extend the 
same rationale to attempts to hire a 

170
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,490
preferentially.
However,

171
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,413
because the Marxism that lurks behind 
there hypothetically pure postmodern 

172
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,433
reasoning justifies identification of 
people by group identity and selection 

173
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,414
on that basis because of its insistence 
that the dialectic of oppressor and 

174
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:13,620
oppressed characterized as all so called
power structures.

175
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,503
The second problem is that only a very 
narrow subset of the wide range of 

176
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:19,644
potential group identities and therefore
group paid qualities can possibly be 

177
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:28,590
identified and rectified by such 
practices privileging those alphabets of

178
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:31,590
group identity above all others.
Again,

179
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:32,424
using the hollowing terminology of the 
postmodernists themselves means 

180
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:39,960
instantiate those and those and only 
those elements as vitally characteristic

181
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:44,961
of the individuals in question to 
encourage or select on the basis of race

182
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:47,334
and sex.
And the other is sacred descriptors of 

183
00:11:49,531 --> 00:11:50,364
the modern anti individual left is 
similar tediously to insist that those 

184
00:11:54,461 --> 00:11:57,640
are the categories upon which people 
should be judged.

185
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,133
It doesn't take much in the way of 
intelligence and insight to see how 

186
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:03,724
easily this process can be reversed and 
used in the opposite direction by those 

187
00:12:08,051 --> 00:12:08,884
on the radical right who might be 
inclined to insist that ration sex are 

188
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:13,534
precisely the relevant categories by 
which people should be judged for the 

189
00:12:17,351 --> 00:12:21,170
very purposes of exclusion and 
prejudicial discrimination.

190
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,970
Those on the left,
hypothetically oppose with sauce for the

191
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:26,800
goose is sauce for the Gander.

192
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,033
Such a reversal is making itself 
currently manifest in the increasing 

193
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:36,370
proclivity of those attacked,
for example,

194
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:41,430
for their quote white privilege and 
quote to start insisting on their racial

195
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:42,274
identity as a primary hallmark and to 
shift from guilt to overt claims of 

196
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:51,370
supremacy.
What else could we get possibly expect?

197
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,623
Something very similar happened with the
black power and black is beautiful 

198
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,374
movements in the late sixties and early 
seventies the third problem is the 

199
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:02,194
tendency for demands for equality of 
opportunity to devolve evermore rapidly 

200
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:07,354
in serious into demands for equity,
which has now become defined as 

201
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:12,820
equality,
not opportunity,

202
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:13,683
but the outcome itself.
This is happening currently at a rate 

203
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:21,460
that beggars belief give the absolute 
catastrophes that social,

204
00:13:21,461 --> 00:13:22,294
economic,
and political policies predicated on 

205
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:27,340
equality of outcome have produced in the
past.

206
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,470
What does equity mean?
It's predicated on two ideas,

207
00:13:32,471 --> 00:13:33,304
each more pernicious than the other.
The first is that all social 

208
00:13:36,101 --> 00:13:36,934
institutions must produce outcomes of 
whatever sort that are precisely equal 

209
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,870
across all possible group identities.

210
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,210
The second is that social institutions 
that do not produce those equal outcomes

211
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,600
do not produce them because of 
institutional racism,

212
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,730
sexism,
or other ism.

213
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,773
That is as well characteristic of the 
explicit and implicit prejudices of 

214
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:03,480
those individuals who make up the 
institutions of questions.

215
00:14:03,481 --> 00:14:04,314
Health.
There are a number of logical reasons 

216
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:09,940
why sex demands cannot be net and 
they're not desirable.

217
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:10,803
Even in principle.
Surrounding those logical reasons is a 

218
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:18,631
plethora of historical data indicating 
most recently in Venezuela that economic

219
00:14:19,841 --> 00:14:24,340
policies predicated on the idea of a 
radical equality are catastrophic.

220
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,533
Even genocidal.
We'll start with the logical reasons to 

221
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:33,820
determine whether or not a given 
institution is inequitable.

222
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,833
The institution is first stratified 
according to the hypothetical privilege 

223
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:39,694
and power get awards to different 
individuals who occupied different 

224
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:43,414
positions within it.
Then the demographic makeup of those 

225
00:14:47,591 --> 00:14:50,650
strata are analyzed along lines of 
racial,

226
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:51,484
ethnic and gender identity as well as 
sexual proclivity and contrast it with 

227
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,344
the demographics that have obtain in the
general population surrounding the 

228
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:01,640
institution.

229
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:02,980
Okay.

230
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,540
What is wrong with this

231
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,360
first

232
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:10,240
section?
Analysis are predicated on the idea that

233
00:15:10,241 --> 00:15:15,241
institutions primarily the function to 
distribute resources and reward.

234
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,983
That's only one of the many functions.
It's a hallmark of the kind of 

235
00:15:20,261 --> 00:15:24,220
ideologically rigid conceptualization,
the dry such assessments.

236
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,113
Then only one factor is ever considered.
This makes being right and being self 

237
00:15:29,381 --> 00:15:32,230
righteous above it,
a very straight forward manner,

238
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,543
radically and observing,
reducing the cognitive demands that a 

239
00:15:35,921 --> 00:15:38,410
truly comprehensive analysis would 
require.

240
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:39,483
Complex,
hierarchical social organizations are 

241
00:15:42,431 --> 00:15:43,264
not simply your mechanisms for 
distributing resources and rewards nor 

242
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:51,990
are they in case it needs to be said 
merely structures of power,

243
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:56,380
privilege and oppression.
They are in part of course both of these

244
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,860
until radica societies they be mostly 
me.

245
00:15:59,861 --> 00:16:03,270
Both of these,
my name is functional.

246
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,070
It's free societies

247
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,430
such as those that primarily 
characterize the west.

248
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,293
Despite it's flaws,
they are also structures of 

249
00:16:13,521 --> 00:16:18,521
responsibility and production.
The evidence for this is overwhelming by

250
00:16:19,161 --> 00:16:24,161
historical and current world standards.
People in the West will house and wealth

251
00:16:25,241 --> 00:16:26,900
stay.
In fact,

252
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,033
we're more currently threatened Michael 
obesity than by starvation with few 

253
00:16:32,181 --> 00:16:35,500
exceptions.
Everyone has indoor plumbing,

254
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,363
central heating,
access to education and connections to 

255
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:40,064
the worldwide web,
which provides on an entirely rely on a 

256
00:16:42,931 --> 00:16:47,931
basis more information at lower cost and
this ever been available previously.

257
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,450
The fact that the West does this with 
great efficiency comparatively speaking,

258
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,343
can be seen in the fact that immigrants 
move virtually without exception from 

259
00:16:58,141 --> 00:17:03,141
the great balls of dysfunctional to 
radica societies from all over the world

260
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,740
to the comparatively freedom productive 
countries of Europe,

261
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,890
North America,
Australia and New Zealand.

262
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,750
And not the reverse.

263
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,410
[inaudible]

264
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,113
are complex social tools of production 
make and do things and we'll report 

265
00:17:25,581 --> 00:17:26,414
bleed maybe and do things the people 
want regardless of what might be 

266
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:33,560
regarded as their consumers.
Triviality.

267
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:38,620
No centrally planned economy produces a 
selection of shampoos or toothbrushes or

268
00:17:39,501 --> 00:17:40,334
automatic and watch blinders were kite 
surfing kinds of things or lightweight 

269
00:17:43,431 --> 00:17:44,264
bicycles or video games.
A hardy minded and judgmental social 

270
00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:52,530
justice advocate might dispute this.
Such a hyper productionist trivial,

271
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,330
but it's still very likely to spend 
hours per day texting his or her friends

272
00:17:57,331 --> 00:17:58,164
and desirable political cliches on 
expensive I iphones and androids one 

273
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:04,074
minutes.
Meat is another man's poison is by no 

274
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:07,134
means clear.
Who should judge whether something that 

275
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,473
someone else desires.
Maybe acceptably produced in a world 

276
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,480
where absolute privation still exists.

277
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:17,880
Okay.

278
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,713
Because our hierarchical organizations 
make new things that people want and 

279
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:24,570
because the people differ in their 
competence.

280
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:25,404
In doing so,
different people experience different 

281
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:31,740
demand for their services.
We adjudicate such demand with pay.

282
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,693
This is the alternative to slavery.
If you are producing things that people 

283
00:18:37,801 --> 00:18:38,634
want,
then you are entitled to charge what 

284
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:41,454
people are willing to pay for your 
services or to refuse to provide such 

285
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:48,060
services at your whim.
If you choose,

286
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,920
you get this privilege because what you 
provide for other people as value and it

287
00:18:52,921 --> 00:18:57,150
is therefore useful for other people to 
encourage you to continue to provide it.

288
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,133
They don't have to buy your offering 
either anymore than you have to produce 

289
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:02,004
it.
Although that's not the very definition 

290
00:19:03,721 --> 00:19:07,110
of freedom is certainly constitutes an 
important element of freedom.

291
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:08,660
Okay.

292
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,800
Because some people are more confident 
making or doing those things,

293
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,650
they can demand a higher price for their
participation.

294
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,070
This is because of what they're 
offering,

295
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,140
not because of what they intrinsically 
deserve.

296
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,633
It may be the case that I'm early 
elements of identity determined to some 

297
00:19:27,081 --> 00:19:31,790
degree the differential probability that
any given individual will come to occupy

298
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:35,180
a place for he or she can offer the 
fruits of their labor.

299
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,103
But if there's also the case that their 
skill at production is a major 

300
00:19:38,331 --> 00:19:39,164
contributor,
this is the demonstrated empirically 

301
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,060
complex jobs,
administrative,

302
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,180
managerial,
nonacademic required,

303
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,103
high intelligence and high levels of the
big five personality trait 

304
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:50,863
conscientiousness that most careful of 
psychometric investigations into such 

305
00:19:54,831 --> 00:19:55,664
things have clearly demonstrated that a 
combination of intelligence and 

306
00:19:58,611 --> 00:19:59,444
conscientiousness,
which can both be accurately measured 

307
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:06,560
correlates at about 0.6 with longterm 
life success in such occupations,

308
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,663
some of the remaining variation in 
success can be attributed to random 

309
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:11,294
factors such as health and even 
counterproductive of fair systemic 

310
00:20:15,711 --> 00:20:16,544
prejudice alone with a fair degree of 
measurement error as productivity and 

311
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:22,280
success for notoriously hard to 
quantify.

312
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,240
Now,
nonetheless,

313
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,103
correlations of that magnitude are 
exceptionally rare in the social and 

314
00:20:27,021 --> 00:20:31,250
health sciences and they are not to be 
easily and carelessly dismissed.

315
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:32,623
The same thing can be said with regards 
to success and entrepreneurial and 

316
00:20:35,211 --> 00:20:36,044
creative endeavors,
which when complex also require 

317
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:42,200
intelligence but demand big five traits,
openness,

318
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,093
which is a dimension indexing capacity 
to produce novel ideas and perceptual 

319
00:20:46,521 --> 00:20:47,354
frames.
To the degree that traits obviously 

320
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:54,430
logically lead to productive success 
actually predict steps to success.

321
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:59,290
The systems in which success such 
success manifests itself can be regarded

322
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,860
as examples of fair and reasonable 
gauge.

323
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,233
It should also be pointed out that many 
said games exist so that people who are 

324
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:12,781
not conscientious or intelligent work 
creative still have the chance to win it

325
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,043
popularity and say it desire for vision,
time in the formulation of close 

326
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:21,260
interpersonal relationships are in the 
provision of safety,

327
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,123
insecurity,
these other domains of potential 

328
00:21:23,711 --> 00:21:24,544
achievement or differentially valued by 
people in accordance with their 

329
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:29,020
intrinsic traits of personality.

330
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:33,880
This means that a person who was 
primarily agreeable for example,

331
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:34,743
may well choose to maximize their 
engagement in interpersonal 

332
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:41,260
relationships out the cost of career or 
entrepreneurial success,

333
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:44,500
and who is to say that's not a 
reasonable trade off.

334
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,223
It is also the case that there are many 
more elements of group identity that 

335
00:21:49,961 --> 00:21:50,794
must be reasonably considered if the 
case could be made that the elements of 

336
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:56,290
race and sex,
et Cetera,

337
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,183
must be considered.
People are differentially successful 

338
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:04,660
because they are older.
Older people are wealthier.

339
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,890
Well,
why?

340
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,813
Well,
because they've had their whole life to 

341
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:10,690
generate wealth.
Is that fair or unfair?

342
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,480
Should it be rectified or is it 
reasonable?

343
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,540
There are younger.
They're better at sports.

344
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:17,374
If you're younger,
you're more likely to attract sexual 

345
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:19,744
partners if you're younger.
Some things are better for men and some 

346
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:23,274
things are better for women.
Some things are better for attractive 

347
00:22:25,691 --> 00:22:26,380
people.

348
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,213
Some things are better for people who 
are up the majority race or religion or 

349
00:22:30,221 --> 00:22:31,054
tribe or language.
Some things are more accessible to 

350
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:37,540
unattractive people,
so character acting,

351
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:39,610
for example,
falls into that category.

352
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:43,420
People have different interests.
People have different education.

353
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,343
People have different levels of mental 
and physical health and people 

354
00:22:46,841 --> 00:22:49,930
differentially regulate their use of 
drugs and alcohol.

355
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,793
Those are all dimensions upon which 
people can be categorized by group and 

356
00:22:54,071 --> 00:22:56,110
there's no reason to privilege,
race,

357
00:22:56,111 --> 00:22:57,910
sex,
sexual identity,

358
00:22:57,911 --> 00:23:01,770
gender identity,
gender expression and um,

359
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,830
above these other dimensions of group 
identity which are equally valuable,

360
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:12,340
which are equally valid and play into 
who we important role.

361
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,210
People judge different outcomes as a 
different worth,

362
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:19,030
love children's leisure,
power,

363
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:20,860
duty,
surface pleasure,

364
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,630
aesthetics,
novelty,

365
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,493
spirituality,
all of these factors and many more to 

366
00:23:26,591 --> 00:23:27,424
determine inequitable outcomes.
How then should people be properly 

367
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:34,300
categorized to ensure equity?

368
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,793
Even a small set of entities can be 
categorized in near infinite number of 

369
00:23:38,981 --> 00:23:39,814
ways.
Who's going to measure all these 

370
00:23:40,871 --> 00:23:41,704
differences?
Who's going to determine which of them 

371
00:23:43,991 --> 00:23:44,824
are important and which of a mark who's 
going to measure the outcomes and some 

372
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,153
of the up to complicate issues further,
who is going to determine whether they 

373
00:23:53,871 --> 00:23:58,640
are biologically instantiated,
socially constructed or mere choice?

374
00:23:58,670 --> 00:23:59,503
Apparently like gender.
Are they mutable or fixed and 

375
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:04,544
deterministic if they're immutable 
merely as a matter of choice as 

376
00:24:08,601 --> 00:24:10,350
legislation in Canada.
Now,

377
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,780
incest is,
for example,

378
00:24:11,781 --> 00:24:12,614
with regards to gender identity and 
gender expression that should those 

379
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:19,640
differences and also be regarded as 
relevant determinants of an equity.

380
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:20,863
If people could make change their hope 
categorization merely as a consequence 

381
00:24:24,261 --> 00:24:25,094
of an act of will,
why would you consider that a relevant 

382
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:30,260
category to determine levels of 
inequality?

383
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:34,070
Furthermore,
who's going to measure and determine the

384
00:24:34,071 --> 00:24:34,904
rewards?
Are we going to insist that everyone 

385
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:42,730
must be equally posture and outgoing,
equally assertive and enthusiastic,

386
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,993
equally private and introverted,
Carrington polite or demanding and 

387
00:24:47,991 --> 00:24:50,300
competitive,
industrious and orderly,

388
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,670
creative,
interested in ideas.

389
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,090
What are those outcomes?
Less important or less worthy of note,

390
00:24:56,091 --> 00:24:59,120
that corporate position or economic 
compensation,

391
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,880
are we going to swallow without 
question?

392
00:25:03,881 --> 00:25:04,714
The idea that career position in 
monetary gain or the old be Jenkin 

393
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:11,550
values that exist that should be 
considered that are worthy of merit.

394
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:16,950
It's a very strange thing for those on 
the radical left to insist that the very

395
00:25:17,081 --> 00:25:17,914
criteria by which large corporations 
judge the utility of individuals are 

396
00:25:22,031 --> 00:25:25,420
precisely those that should be used to 
assess equality of outcomes,

397
00:25:25,421 --> 00:25:30,040
fairness and diversity.
Let's say it again.

398
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:35,430
It isn't what you deserve for intrinsic 
reasons that determines your outcome.

399
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:40,120
It's the word that others attributed to 
your offerings.

400
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:45,210
Think of an offering on Ebay.
No sellers says,

401
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,563
I am Azur Bay Sham and my mother was had
mother has Alzheimer's and I'm not well 

402
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,174
educated but I tall and strong,
although not very attractive and I was 

403
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:58,330
bullied as a child but I'm quite 
musical.

404
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,193
Although I only have one print and I'm 
slightly overweight and prone to 

405
00:26:02,471 --> 00:26:03,304
anxiety,
so you have to pay the $50 for my 

406
00:26:05,711 --> 00:26:07,360
secondhand crock pot.

407
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:13,970
[inaudible]

408
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:19,603
they say,
instead I have this item and you don't 

409
00:26:23,421 --> 00:26:24,254
care who I am and I don't care who you 
are except that I would describe it 

410
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,340
honestly and ship it and you will pay 
for it.

411
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:36,500
You can agree on a mutually beneficial 
price that's trade.

412
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,510
The reward runs both ways.
Trade is not charity.

413
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,063
Trade is mutually beneficial.
Trade does not and cannot rectify 

414
00:26:47,071 --> 00:26:47,904
historical or biological injustices.
It can only hardly and momentarily 

415
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:53,754
satisfying.
The people engaged in the particular 

416
00:26:55,771 --> 00:26:56,604
trade.
Attempts to redistribute through trade 

417
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,593
tend to kick it back.
Look at that is the way people there 

418
00:27:03,781 --> 00:27:08,781
have now lost an average of 18 pounds.
Cuba can barely feed itself.

419
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,020
Everything is running down and barely 
functional.

420
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,393
I think one of the most comical things 
I've seen in recent years was the motor 

421
00:27:17,191 --> 00:27:22,191
convoy transferring Fidel Castro's 
damned corpse to the,

422
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,030
to the,
uh,

423
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,500
to the cemetery breaking down in the 
middle of the front

424
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,403
session.

425
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,180
Everything is run down in Belize,
functionable.

426
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,253
Why?
Because the problem of distribution is 

427
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:44,980
so complex that it has to be outsourced 
to the collective intelligence.

428
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,023
Knows person,
group of persons or imaginable 

429
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:54,400
computational device can perform the 
calculations of the price.

430
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:59,520
The measurements can even be made.
This is because of the price of anything

431
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,400
is dependent on the price of everything 
else.

432
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,760
And to make it worse is always shifting 
flawed as the free market system is.

433
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,013
We don't have anything better,
but let's say instead we transfer 

434
00:28:15,711 --> 00:28:18,160
determination of power,
status,

435
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:21,190
privilege and desire to a group of 
people.

436
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:22,683
What group,
how do we regulate their biases and 

437
00:28:25,331 --> 00:28:28,240
correct for the rape?
It's how do we limit their power,

438
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,840
how do we protect ourselves against 
their ideologies and hatred?

439
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:32,683
And entrance.
How do we discriminate the desire to 

440
00:28:35,531 --> 00:28:36,364
help the unfortunate from the wish to 
destroying the weld constituted and 

441
00:28:40,931 --> 00:28:41,950
successful?

442
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,563
We don't and we can't and we won't,
but we'll have those basket political 

443
00:28:50,711 --> 00:28:53,860
maneuvering,
most convinced of their righteousness,

444
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,670
least aware of their ignorance and 
limitations of knowledge.

445
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:58,783
And Sue,
most filled with resentment and hatred 

446
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,840
will instantly rise to dominate such 
positions.

447
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:09,010
And then all hell will break on it.
How do we know this?

448
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:14,400
Because it already happened and it 
killed 100 million people.

449
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:18,400
And maybe I'm told the others destitute 
and miserable,

450
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:23,520
and it just about destroyed the world.
We already ran this experiment and fail,

451
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:30,100
and then we ran it again and it fail.
And then we ran it again.

452
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:33,820
And then they fail.
And then we replicated the failure.

453
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:34,743
No one who was not eight,
your rent would dare to experiment 

454
00:29:38,291 --> 00:29:39,910
concepts,

which isn't youth purveyor as an equity.
You merchants of yesterday's poison.

457
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,240
Are you ignorant or 1100

458
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:57,760
[inaudible].
