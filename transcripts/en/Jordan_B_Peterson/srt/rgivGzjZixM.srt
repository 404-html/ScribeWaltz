00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:03,580
Hi everyone.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,760
Thanks for tuning in to the April,

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,550
2019 Q and a probably won't
do another one until June.

4
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm traveling almost
completely through May,

5
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:18,220
although it's getting easier
to do these on the road.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,720
Camera quality usually isn't as good,
so we'll see what happens.

7
00:00:22,721 --> 00:00:27,340
I like doing both, but be nice to do
it with the right equipment. So look,

8
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,390
before we get started, I've got a bunch
of things I'd like to tell you about.

9
00:00:31,391 --> 00:00:36,391
I hope that you're interested in the
first one and the oddest one I suppose is

10
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:43,201
the fact that I'm going to be debating
the renowned Marxist philosopher Slavoj

11
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,360
[inaudible],
who's a very well,

12
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:51,390
well known continental academic tomorrow
at the Sony Center in Toronto at seven

13
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:57,721
30 on the topic happiness
capitalism versus Marxism.

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,430
We've decided we'll live streaming this
event for those who might be interested

15
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:05,560
in marching the events as they unfold.

16
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,760
Tickets for the livestream
are available on my website,

17
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,390
Jordan peterson.com but I'll
put all the proper links below.

18
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,690
So if you pick up a livestream ticket,

19
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,380
you can view the debate at any
time up to 30 days afterwards.

20
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,400
We're also going to put the
debate eventually up on Youtube,

21
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:25,570
probably within a month.

22
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,350
So if you don't want to watch it live
well then you can always wait and watch it

23
00:01:29,351 --> 00:01:33,010
later. But if you want to participate
in it in so far as you can do that

24
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:34,000
electronically,

25
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,350
then I guess the livestream
idea is the right one.

26
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,570
We thought we'd run it
as an experiment anyways.

27
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,340
Maybe you can have a Peterson versus
Dziedzic party if that's the sort of party

28
00:01:45,341 --> 00:01:49,770
you're interested in on a Friday night.
I'd also like to know,

29
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:54,640
let you know that season two of the
Jordan would be Peterson podcasts has now

30
00:01:54,641 --> 00:01:58,090
started with the first three episodes up.

31
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:03,150
Two of them are 12 rules for life
lectures taken from my tour last year.

32
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,990
Uh, one of them from Seattle and one from
Portland as well as an interview with

33
00:02:07,991 --> 00:02:09,610
General Stanley McChrystal,

34
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:14,910
retired four star general and former
commander US forces Afghanistan.

35
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:21,420
We partnered this year with Westwood one
largest audio network in the u s and my

36
00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:25,570
daughter Mckayla is
going to serve as cohost.

37
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:29,470
So hopefully that allowed a little
bit of lightness and warmth.

38
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,950
And a little bit of humor
to the podcast and um,

39
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,330
we're hoping as a consequence
of partnering with Westwood One,

40
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,370
which also means by the way that the
podcast will now be ad supported. Um,

41
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:47,490
that that would help incentivize me to
make sure that I got a podcast out every

42
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,810
week.
It was a bit haphazard over the last year.

43
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,030
The broadcast was generally
a lower priority item and
we've decided this year to

44
00:02:55,031 --> 00:02:55,864
make it,

45
00:02:55,990 --> 00:03:00,790
well a top priority or perhaps at
least in the top five. Let's see.

46
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,190
So,
um,

47
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,970
and we hope we'll get higher production
quality out of it and be able to find a

48
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:09,940
larger audience.
And so I guess we'll see how that goes.

49
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:14,941
The initial feedback has been pretty
good with about 600,000 or so views per

50
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:21,070
episode, so that seems to be performing
quite nicely. So thank you all for that.

51
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,320
Jordan B. Peterson videos
on youtube, which will,

52
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:29,680
we'll also feature most of the podcast
content like it has in the past will

53
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:32,470
remain unmarried monetized as previously.

54
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,760
Now next we will get to the questions,
I promise.

55
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,480
I'm going to London in May to celebrate.

56
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:45,481
And promote the release of the May 2nd
standard paperback of 12 rules for life

57
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:49,590
into the UK, Australia,
New Zealand Indian,

58
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:54,130
and other international English markets,
not including US and Canada.

59
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:59,080
Yet preorders of that paper back can
be obtained at the penguin website.

60
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,610
I'll leave the links below.
I'm extremely excited.

61
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,670
One of the things I was really
excited about this year, you know,

62
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:11,730
I wrote the foreword to Alexander
Solzhenitsyn's abridged good Uyghur

63
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:17,680
archipelago. So that was, that
was, uh, I was a pretty good honor.

64
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:20,560
That was, uh, last week,
by the way, in New York.

65
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:23,860
I talked to his son
[inaudible] and we, we, uh,

66
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:29,010
spend about an hour discussing historical
material related to the Gulag and

67
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:31,120
that'll be released
with the audio version,

68
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:35,030
which I've read the forward because as
I said, I wrote the foreword and ignite,

69
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,850
I believe,
read the rest of the audio,

70
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,390
but that'll be released in audio book form
fairly soon along with that interview.

71
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,070
So that was extremely interesting.

72
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:47,071
He's a very accomplished man in his
own right as a pianist and conductor,

73
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:51,640
and it has a very successful
international career. So, um,

74
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,970
he has his father's intellect,
that's for sure.

75
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,240
So it's really exciting for me,

76
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,850
was very exciting for me to
do that forward. But it's,

77
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,110
I would say equally exciting to have
a paper back in the great tradition of

78
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,220
Penguin paperbacks,

79
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:10,480
which I've loved ever since I was old
enough to know the difference between

80
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,270
let's, no, let's rephrase that old enough
to start to read serious literature.

81
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,210
And so to have,
uh,

82
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:23,710
a paper come out on the Penguin label is,
well,

83
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,330
I just saw the first copy of it this
week. They sent it to me. It's, um,

84
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:32,380
hard to believe, man. It's,
uh, it's, uh, I think,

85
00:05:32,381 --> 00:05:35,470
I don't even how you think I even had
that as a dream. You know, I didn't,

86
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,950
I didn't think that was,
was there ever any likelihood of that?

87
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:42,880
So it's better than a dream come true in
some sense because it's a dream that I

88
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:46,810
never even suspected might occur.
That came true.

89
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:49,060
So that's good.
Anyways,

90
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,260
you can preorder that if
you're inclined to, uh,

91
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:58,150
it's discounted in price, of course, to
the, in comparison to the hardcover. Um,

92
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,320
maybe it'd bank a good gift for someone
you like suming you liked the book.

93
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,950
So
finally,

94
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,860
most of the time when I do a Q and,
a,

95
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:13,700
I also talk a little bit about two
programs that my colleagues and I have

96
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:14,211
developed.

97
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:19,211
One called self authoring Dotcom and
the other called understand myself.com.

98
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:23,660
And the first one is a set of writing
programs that help you write an

99
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:28,580
autobiography and a description of your
present personality and a plan for the

100
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:31,730
future and they're all laid out.

101
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:36,731
So that doing that is what guided and
scaffold and simplified so that you don't

102
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:43,550
have to answer the terribly
difficult question.

103
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:48,080
Who was I when I grew up till now?
All as one question.

104
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,400
Anyway,
a lot of people have used the programs,

105
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:56,660
there's tens of thousands of them now
and we have good evidence for the future

106
00:06:56,661 --> 00:06:58,100
authoring program in particular,

107
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:01,520
which helps people make a plan and
develop a vision and make a plan for the

108
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:04,070
future. That, for example,
among college students,

109
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:09,060
it decreases their dropout rate by
about 25%. It seems to have, um,

110
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,920
about the same effect on their
grade point average. So anyways,

111
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,820
these writing exercises, if there's
anything bothering you about your past,

112
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:21,100
you know, you can tell that because
you have negative memories. Um,

113
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,590
let's say of anything that happened
to you 18 months or previous,

114
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,220
shouldn't really mess around with
traumatic memories before they're about 18

115
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:31,340
months old. But if your past
still haunts you, you know,

116
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:34,910
if you can't stop thinking about it,
then there's,

117
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:38,450
there's things that have happened
to you that you don't understand.

118
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:43,250
You don't understand the causal pathways
that lead you down the path that you

119
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,020
are now afraid of or regret.

120
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,950
And they alarm systems that make up your,
the,

121
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,720
the parts of your brain that control
anxiety will never let you free of that

122
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:58,990
because their job is to alert you to
danger and past or present perhaps in case

123
00:07:59,091 --> 00:08:01,070
you encountered the same situation again.

124
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:05,570
And unless you've come up
with an elaborated causal
account of what put you at

125
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:06,290
risk,

126
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:10,640
then you're likely to suffer from
those anxiety related or trauma related

127
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:11,960
memories for your whole life.

128
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,760
So you can write the autobiography part
of self authoring dark come and asks you

129
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:20,750
to break your life into 70 parks and
write about the important positive and

130
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:25,670
negative experiences in each and analyze
them. And I've had plenty of people,

131
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,660
I'm not making a formal
scientific claim here by the way,

132
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,680
but there is good evidence that this
kind of riding does help people, um,

133
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:39,770
uh, come to terms with their past and
increase their psychological health.

134
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,250
We haven't done those studies specifically
on our program so I don't want to

135
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:44,180
claim that we have,

136
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:49,190
but I have had many people mentioned
that after completing the past authoring

137
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:49,910
program,

138
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:54,470
a lot of the things that they had bothered
them chronically had begin to recede

139
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:57,780
into the past they belonged.
So anyways,

140
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,260
we're offering those programs.
The self authoring program,

141
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:04,500
you can buy two for one,
there's a special on,

142
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,630
it's rather permanent special because
it seems to be very popular anyways.

143
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,170
That means you can buy one for you and
a friend and it's 20% off and so is

144
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:15,390
understand myself.com.

145
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,390
That's a personality test that
I developed with my colleagues.

146
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:23,730
That gives you a big five readout,
extroversion, neuroticism, agreeableness,

147
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:26,490
conscientiousness and openness.

148
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,860
I think I go to all five there and
10 of the aspects that make them up.

149
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:36,480
So it's very high resolution personality
test and it's been on the horse side is

150
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:38,010
not designed to make you feel good.

151
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:42,090
It's designed to actually tell you about
your strengths and weaknesses and look,

152
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:45,120
man, everybody has strengths
and weaknesses. So you know,

153
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:49,680
if there's a bit that's harsh in the,
in the test results, don't feel too bad.

154
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,930
It's not like you're
alone in that anyways.

155
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:56,931
The code for the 20% discount is may
and it's valid until the end of May.

156
00:09:58,501 --> 00:10:02,670
And so look these, these
programs, you know,

157
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,920
let's think about the future
authoring program. It's,

158
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,290
it's really a good thing to have
a plan for your life. You know,

159
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:14,070
you're not going to get what you need
and you want less the aim at it and you

160
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:14,280
know,

161
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,580
and aim at it unless he knew what it is
and you're not going to know what it is

162
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:20,670
unless you think about what it
is that you need and you want.

163
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:24,060
And it's hard for people to do that
and we're not trained to do that.

164
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:27,450
It doesn't happen to us in school.
It doesn't happen to us in university.

165
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:32,520
We liked the future authoring program
and this and the past authoring program

166
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:33,900
and the present authoring program.

167
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,220
They all the clinical evidence about
programs like this suggests that they work

168
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:43,221
very well and they're there
and you can do them badly.

169
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,290
That's the other thing that's kind
of cool is you don't have to get all

170
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,600
perfectionistic about it.

171
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:51,150
You don't have to write a perfect account
of your past and you don't have to

172
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,950
come up with the right plan for the future
because you're not going to anyways.

173
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,840
Cause what do you know about
what the future's going to bring?

174
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,690
It's still worthwhile to chart
a course though, you know,

175
00:11:00,691 --> 00:11:03,480
because it increases the probability
that you'll get what you want.

176
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:08,190
So you know, my, my
colleagues, Daniel Higgins,

177
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:12,510
he's at Harvard and, or
was it Harvard? He's a PA,

178
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:17,580
has a phd from Harvard and Bob Bob Peele
who just resigned or just retired from

179
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:19,314
McGill.

180
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,130
We built these programs over a couple
of years along with some of my graduate

181
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:26,490
students, particularly
Raymond Mar. And uh,

182
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,660
we think they've been really
useful for people. So, um,

183
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:35,370
and you know what,
we were trying to figure out low costs,

184
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,280
psychological interventions
that could be scaled,

185
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,960
that would not do people any harm that
they could do on their own with minimal

186
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,000
administrative overhead and cost.

187
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:49,020
And so that's the philosophy
that underlies them. So, um,

188
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:53,310
well that's enough of that.
I should also mention finally,

189
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,170
for those of you who might be interested,
I was in New York this week, um,

190
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:03,250
on Monday for example, um, I
taped 16 interviews with Dr Oz.

191
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,320
Now there's a man with energy.
I'll tell you we did that.

192
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,490
I was pretty much fried by the
end of that. His wife Lisa,

193
00:12:09,491 --> 00:12:14,150
who's very bright person and who
knows my work very well asked, uh,

194
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,500
wrote out all the questions that Dr
Oz used to interview me. And, uh,

195
00:12:18,501 --> 00:12:21,220
they were killer questions.
I had to think about every one of them.

196
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:23,200
And so we seem to have a good time.

197
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,910
There was a bit of a studio audience there
and they seem to like the discussion.

198
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:33,210
And so these will appear as 10 to 15
minute video clips either on Dr Oz's

199
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:39,760
broadcast show or on youtube or both.
And you know,

200
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:44,410
it never know. They might show up
on my channel as well. Um, but um,

201
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:49,210
before Warren they're coming and
hopefully, what did he call them?

202
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:53,230
He thought it would be useful if there
were good 10 minute clips of some of the

203
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,600
things that I've talked
about for people to access.

204
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:59,630
And so he's got a nice professional
studio and I like working with them. Um,

205
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:00,963
so,

206
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:06,080
well that was New York House did a talk
last night at the beacon theater, um,

207
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:12,070
which was sold out. So that's the
third time the beacon is sold out.

208
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:14,110
So I don't know what it
is about New Yorkers,

209
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:18,340
but they seem to like to talk about
sorrow and suffering and malevolence and

210
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,400
Russian communist camps and well,

211
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:26,200
maybe also the possibility of having a
reasonable and productive and meaningful

212
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:30,280
life. And that's really why people are
there. So it was a good, a good event.

213
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:35,140
And my daughter Mckayla,
um, opened the show.

214
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,250
So that was kind of fun.

215
00:13:36,251 --> 00:13:39,850
And she also did the Q and a because
there's a Q and a portion of its that was

216
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,480
different and it was cute warm as far as
I was concerned and she's kind of funny

217
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:50,530
and so that was helpful as
well. So anyways, um, uh,

218
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,010
as a lot of news,
hopefully it wasn't too much.

219
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,570
And so now I'll do my best
to answer your questions.

220
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,460
Um, I'm a little, no, I guess
I'm not quite ready yet.

221
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,970
Little nervous about the
debate was Dziedzic tomorrow.

222
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,980
I'm not a political philosopher,
you know,

223
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:12,940
and it's been a long time since I read
Mark's re-read the communist manifesto

224
00:14:12,941 --> 00:14:15,730
over the last couple of weeks
and tried to think it through.

225
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:20,500
And so I'm going to talk tomorrow about
the essence of the capitalist flow or

226
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:24,760
the communist philosophy. Um,
I don't think I've read a book.

227
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,300
Well,
we'll leave it at that.

228
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:33,700
I'm going to take it apart tomorrow at
the lecture and, uh, I hope I'm ready.

229
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,670
I've got 25 minutes to
make my case pretty short.

230
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,400
Shouldn't take a lot of
prep time if I'm careful,

231
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,970
but I can't waste any of
the time. And, and uh,

232
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:47,440
I'd really like to do a good job cause
I think it's an important debate.

233
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,390
No,
it's an important subject.

234
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,410
I don't know if it's going
to be an important debate.

235
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:55,040
I know a lot of people in
Europe will be watching it, so.

236
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,260
All right everyone, let's see,
um, what we've got here to,

237
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,730
to address,

238
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:07,670
have you had been allotted the
opportunity asked Michael Mix?

239
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,850
What would you have discussed with nature?

240
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,893
Well,

241
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,650
I think I would have discussed with them
what the psychoanalysts discovered in

242
00:15:21,651 --> 00:15:24,440
the 20th century or what they
claimed to have discovered, who,

243
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,670
which I believe was a genuine discovery.

244
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:34,910
See when nature announced the
death of God, which by the way,

245
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:39,370
as you may know from listening
to my lectures was not
precisely a triumphal, um,

246
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,500
wasn't an announcement of triumph.
It was announced.

247
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:47,510
It was a warning and the tolling
of bells of Sorrell. That's a,

248
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,670
that's a good way of, of thinking
about it. Even though Nisha was a

249
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,940
at styled himself as a vicious,

250
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,380
an intellectually vicious critic
of institutionalized Christianity,

251
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:01,610
which he certainly was.

252
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,540
He was also a strange friend to the faith.

253
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:10,460
I think in the most fundamental sense,
that's the truth.

254
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,240
He wrote some things about Christ, for
example, which were very positive. Um,

255
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:17,120
and I think the reason he,
I,

256
00:16:17,121 --> 00:16:21,890
he understood as well how important
the narrative substructure of the Judeo

257
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:24,650
Christian tradition was to the
maintenance of Western civilization.

258
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:29,670
He understood. He, here's one of the
people I learned that from, you know, um,

259
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,530
so
see,

260
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:37,260
so when Nietzsche announced the
death that God, he did it softly and,

261
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,870
and then he tried to think about what we
might be able to do about that because

262
00:16:41,871 --> 00:16:45,920
it was going to lead us down to bad
pathways. You'd the towards nihilism

263
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,950
and the belief or what would you call the
direct experience that because God was

264
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:56,000
dead, everything might be permitted
as, as Dostoyevsky pointed out,

265
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,590
or totalitarianism,

266
00:16:57,591 --> 00:17:02,450
which would arise as irrational
substitute for them dogmas of religion.

267
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,250
And he knew that, that both of those
would be catastrophic occurrences.

268
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,070
And so he was trying to figure
out what we could do too.

269
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:17,080
Heal ourselves I suppose as a consequence
of this great loss cause neat.

270
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,490
You also believed, well I mentioned
this, that you know, the belief in God,

271
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:26,220
just not something so simple as belief
and you know, a bearded man in the sky.

272
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:31,770
It's sad to even have to say that
and maybe it's not necessary but,

273
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,310
but at least you know more,

274
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,400
more profoundly that the death of the
idea that a universe ordered by something

275
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:49,230
that's akin to the living and
conscience and conscious and,

276
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,300
and intelligent.
Um,

277
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:57,690
it's rough to replace that with
pure random meaninglessness.

278
00:17:57,691 --> 00:18:01,600
And of course that's the pathway
denialism. Anyways, neat.

279
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:06,360
You thought we would have to create our
own values to replace those that would

280
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:11,250
fall because of the death of
Christianity and the psychoanalysts,

281
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:16,140
Freud and young, particularly
young. But Freud began at,

282
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,460
I think,
and you've made this explicit,

283
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,630
I think found a fatal flaw
and niches theorizing.

284
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:30,110
And maybe it's a fatal flaw in
relationship to modernism per se.

285
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,960
Even to the idea of rational thought
itself as master of its own house.

286
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,663
You're not,

287
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:43,080
you can't make your own
values and you can aim,

288
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,000
you can direct your life.
You can,

289
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:49,920
you can cooperate in determining
the values that you pursue,

290
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:55,490
but you cooperate with forces in yourself
that aren't you and can't be made you,

291
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,920
not, not in any straight forward way.
And it's easy to understand this.

292
00:19:01,921 --> 00:19:03,600
If you think about,
for example,

293
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:08,010
the fact that if you do something that
you shouldn't do or if you don't do

294
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:09,810
something that you should do,

295
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:15,030
that you'll lay awake in bed at night
and torment yourself about it and worry

296
00:19:15,031 --> 00:19:19,110
about it and consider yourself
an unworthy person. You know,

297
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:21,510
as if you believed in the idea of sin.

298
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,730
It's a very strange thing that there's
an ethic that calls to you from within

299
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:31,500
that you can't control that, that
holds you responsible for your actions.

300
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:36,060
Now it's just one of many
sub personalities in some
sense that are operative

301
00:19:36,061 --> 00:19:38,010
within people in it.
It depends,

302
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,070
I suppose on how integrated
the personality is.

303
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,900
The less integrated people
are more different depending
on what emotional state

304
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:47,490
they're in.
But you know with the,

305
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,690
the you that's overwhelmed with grief
or the you that's overwhelmed with,

306
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,400
with love or lust or,

307
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:58,620
or the you that's overwhelmed with anger
possessed by those things is really

308
00:19:58,621 --> 00:20:03,621
often by no means the same you that you
like to think of yourself as when you're

309
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,070
under full conscious control and,

310
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,870
and in your normal state of mind.

311
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,500
I mean even the idea of of
drunkenness intoxication,

312
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:20,040
that's possession by a spirit, right?
That's why whiskey is a spirit.

313
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,280
It's the spirit of Dionysius and you
drink and you become something that you

314
00:20:25,321 --> 00:20:28,290
normally aren't. You know,
they say in Vino Veritas,

315
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:33,291
but it's not necessarily reasonable to
believe that everything you do and say,

316
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:35,910
well you're intoxicated
by alcohol is true.

317
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:41,030
The point is that there are
multiple personalities that
work within you and they

318
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:45,090
have a fair bit of autonomy,
like a strange autonomy.

319
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,920
If you could just create your own values,

320
00:20:46,921 --> 00:20:50,890
you can imagine when some sense you'd
be doing what Ruskell Nicole tried to do

321
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:53,680
in crime and punishment,
which is a book I'd really recommend.

322
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,130
He believed that Nietzsche, an idea
that you could create your own values.

323
00:20:57,131 --> 00:21:01,930
And as a consequence, he decided
to murder a terrible old woman, um,

324
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,430
who was oppressing many of the people in
our neighborhood and seemed loved by no

325
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,810
one and hated by everyone.

326
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:12,160
And who is a vicious slave master to her,

327
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:16,810
not very bright,
nice and risk.

328
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:20,320
Melnikov thought that he could
do away with her, that would,

329
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,360
that would get him out of
some financial trouble.

330
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:24,100
And then he would do good
things with the money.

331
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,700
And that if he was a real superman in
some sense in the Nietzschean manner of

332
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:36,061
thinking that he could just dispense with
all the guilt that might logically be

333
00:21:36,281 --> 00:21:39,460
associated with murder. Because
after all, if there's no god,

334
00:21:39,461 --> 00:21:42,310
everything is permitted and
we can create our own values.

335
00:21:42,311 --> 00:21:47,311
And crime and punishment is
an unbelievably deep study
of what happens when you

336
00:21:48,251 --> 00:21:52,090
cross a line that you shouldn't have
crossed because of your own arrogance.

337
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:56,620
And so it was gone. The cough, this is
a thriller, this, this book, you know,

338
00:21:56,621 --> 00:22:01,000
a real detective story. Well, he, uh,
I hate, I'm not going to blow the plot,

339
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,770
but he,

340
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,940
he sort of successful in the murder.
It gets away with it,

341
00:22:06,941 --> 00:22:11,380
although it doesn't exactly turn out
the way he expects even the act itself.

342
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,190
And,

343
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:16,150
but what he discovers in the aftermath
of what he did is that he was no where

344
00:22:16,151 --> 00:22:20,770
near as in control of himself and his
personality and his emotional reactions.

345
00:22:20,771 --> 00:22:21,970
And he's as he thought,

346
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:27,180
and he tortures himself for a very long
time with very interesting psychological

347
00:22:28,211 --> 00:22:32,950
and social consequences as well as
driving the plot ahead very rapidly with

348
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:38,350
what's what he's done. Absolute start
traumatized disbelief at what he's done.

349
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,260
And so what I'd like to ask Nisha,

350
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:46,240
because that's the question that I'm
supposed to be answering is given the

351
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,090
mutability of man,

352
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:52,900
the fact that we are composed of multiple
sub personalities, which by the way,

353
00:22:52,901 --> 00:22:57,280
it was something that needs you actually
mentioned and that I believe that both

354
00:22:57,281 --> 00:23:00,370
Freud and noon relied on when they
were formulating their psychoanalytic

355
00:23:00,371 --> 00:23:05,320
theories, given the fact that we
aren't masters of our own houses.

356
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,800
And given the fact that we're
divided amongst ourselves.

357
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:15,870
How in the world is it possible for
us to develop our own values when,

358
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,170
when we're a massive internal
contradictions and were,

359
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,640
and each of those contradictions is a
consequence of something live trying to

360
00:23:24,641 --> 00:23:29,350
make its case made. You know, like
if you were your own creation,

361
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,630
whatever that might mean,

362
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,890
if you are in full control of your
own consciousness and emotions and

363
00:23:35,891 --> 00:23:36,790
motivations,

364
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:42,130
well then you certainly wouldn't be guilty
about things you didn't do or did do

365
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:47,040
because you could just revamp your
value structure at will to optimize,

366
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:51,230
let's say your emotional
state and you know,

367
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:54,290
it's good to some degree
to be able to do that,

368
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:58,220
to cheer yourself up and to
dampen your grief. But man,

369
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:01,040
you're not as in control of
yourself as you'd like to think.

370
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:06,041
And you're haunted by many things that
you could be in many things that you are.

371
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,110
One of the things that
really terrified me,

372
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:13,280
I think enough to change when I was to
change the way I was living when I was

373
00:24:13,281 --> 00:24:18,281
studying psychology was that encounter
with that psychoanalytic idea that you're

374
00:24:19,071 --> 00:24:22,100
not alone in your psyche.
You know,

375
00:24:22,101 --> 00:24:24,320
you can even tell that
if you're a student,

376
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:26,840
if you're trying to read
something that you have to read,

377
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:30,260
you know there's difference between
reading something you have to read and

378
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:33,320
something that you want to read. If you
want to read it, you can just read it.

379
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,690
If you have to read it,
you might not read it at all.

380
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:38,550
You might just procrastinate endlessly.
Uh,

381
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,200
even even if there's an important outcome,
like an exam,

382
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:47,180
even if the consequence of that exam
might be failing a course and destroying

383
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:48,290
your academic record,

384
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:53,120
you'll still find yourself very resistant
to read the paper unless you happen to

385
00:24:53,121 --> 00:24:56,420
be personally interested in it.
And that's so interesting too,

386
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:57,800
because even at that level,

387
00:24:57,801 --> 00:25:01,250
you're not the sort of person that
can create their own values. Man.

388
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:06,350
You can't even convince yourself to read
a piece of complex writing if you're a

389
00:25:06,351 --> 00:25:09,620
university student enrolled
in a course that you chose,

390
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,890
that that assignment is part of.

391
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,420
And so that's a pretty good indication
of just how many directions you're pulled

392
00:25:17,421 --> 00:25:21,170
in simultaneously. So I would really
like to discuss that with Nietzsche.

393
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,920
I would like to know what he thinks
thought about that. You know,

394
00:25:24,921 --> 00:25:29,060
maybe he thought that despite
our dissociate ability and
the multiplicity of our

395
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:29,900
personality,

396
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:35,500
that the possibility or the necessity
of creating our own value as soon as the

397
00:25:35,541 --> 00:25:39,540
only chance we had, but, but,

398
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:43,370
but what you see,
what I learned from Yom,

399
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:47,750
and this is the probably the most
profound thing I learned, I think

400
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,440
of all the things that I know perhaps
is that values aren't created.

401
00:25:55,201 --> 00:26:00,201
They're discovered and they're discovered
through a consultation with the parts

402
00:26:00,871 --> 00:26:03,810
of yourself that you're not conscious of,
that you're not fully conscious of,

403
00:26:03,811 --> 00:26:05,400
that aren't articulated,

404
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,990
that aren't fully articulated
elements of your primary personality.

405
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:15,260
You have to discover what your values
are and you're informed about that.

406
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:19,290
Well, partly by other people who will
object. If your values aren't appropriate,

407
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:23,370
but certainly by a dialogue with
yourself and with your conscience,

408
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,370
that's,
that's an a very important thing to know.

409
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:30,210
It's a part of the reason why I think
that you need to tell the truth because

410
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:38,770
you're forced to negotiate with yourself
to operate properly in the world.

411
00:26:39,171 --> 00:26:41,480
And if you've worked yourself,
let's say,

412
00:26:41,481 --> 00:26:45,900
or some elements of yourself by
engaging in self deception and lies,

413
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:49,140
and you're not now because of that,

414
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:53,340
you're not who you could be and you don't
live in the world as you should live

415
00:26:53,341 --> 00:26:57,780
in it. Then when you discuss with
yourself what your value should be,

416
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,460
it will be as if you're discussing it
with someone that you can't trust and

417
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:06,770
that's, that's not good. Like you.

418
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,030
You can't afford that.

419
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:13,450
Life is difficult and it contains many
pitfalls and unless you're careful and

420
00:27:14,751 --> 00:27:19,751
you sort yourself out properly and you
aim high and walk on the straight and

421
00:27:19,811 --> 00:27:20,644
narrow path,

422
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:26,170
you don't have a hope of understanding
where you should be and at what time,

423
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:31,120
when the crisis hits
and the crisis will hit.

424
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,530
So you want to get all those little sub
personalities in a line. If you can't,

425
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,470
it's part of the reason, for example,
why you thought you had an integrate.

426
00:27:38,471 --> 00:27:40,750
Your shout at which is the
dark part of your character.

427
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,860
He thought that was necessary or where
it would go and have a little autonomous

428
00:27:44,861 --> 00:27:48,040
life of its own may be manifesting itself,
for example,

429
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,400
when you're angry or drunk instead
of integrated into the rest of your

430
00:27:51,401 --> 00:27:52,234
personality,

431
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:57,300
like a properly disciplined player
in a complex and sophisticated game.

432
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,543
So,

433
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,373
hmm.

434
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,990
How lots of tough questions today.
Here's one from Basil.

435
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:26,990
I live in constant worry. My children
are going to be hit by a car, kidnapped,

436
00:28:26,991 --> 00:28:30,860
murdered, beaten up. It's
a torture. How can I stop?

437
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,433
Well,

438
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,430
I guess the first thing I
would say is that you should

439
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,920
reassure yourself, and I know that's
a paradoxical to think about it,

440
00:28:52,921 --> 00:28:56,580
that these things could
happen. You know, look,

441
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,780
I've never been surprised as a
clinician that people were anxious.

442
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,370
So what you say, it doesn't surprise me
except that the constancy part of it,

443
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,320
perhaps it's surprising because
children can get hit by cars, kidnapped,

444
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:15,240
murdered and beaten up. Um, and it
is a torture to contemplate that.

445
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,070
And so you might ask yourself,

446
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:22,340
not Bazell not why so much you're
living in constant worry that that could

447
00:29:22,501 --> 00:29:23,430
happen to your children.

448
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,660
But why everyone else isn't always
living in constant worry that that could

449
00:29:27,661 --> 00:29:32,430
happen. You know, because tragedy
can strike and it strikes children.

450
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:37,200
Apparently you're quite attached to
your children and so aren't very,

451
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:42,370
what would you say,
Suze by the realization

452
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:46,810
that something terrible could happen
to them now, you know, first of all,

453
00:29:46,811 --> 00:29:50,920
I might say you might want to go talk
to somebody professional about this,

454
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:51,521
you know,

455
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:56,521
because maybe you're depressed more
than you should be and maybe you have an

456
00:29:56,651 --> 00:29:58,690
anxiety disorder.
Um,

457
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,280
I'm not saying that that
is not a diagnosis and I
certainly couldn't derive that

458
00:30:03,281 --> 00:30:04,031
from what you said,

459
00:30:04,031 --> 00:30:08,530
but it's one of the possible things that
could contribute to this constant worry.

460
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:09,601
You know,
or,

461
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:14,601
or maybe you're physiologically ill
and less resilient than you should be,

462
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,340
maybe you're not eating enough.
Um,

463
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:22,240
one thing I would recommend to begin with
is to make sure that you just try this.

464
00:30:22,241 --> 00:30:24,040
I know it's surprising advice,

465
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:28,390
but try to eat a big breakfast for
like two weeks. See what happens,

466
00:30:28,391 --> 00:30:30,310
see if that drives the worry doubt.
Now.

467
00:30:30,311 --> 00:30:33,230
Then the next thing I would ask is
when does it happen? Like is it,

468
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,830
are these dreams or these
thoughts before you go to bed,

469
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:39,580
you wake up in the middle of the night
with these visions running through your

470
00:30:39,581 --> 00:30:44,080
head. Um, and again,
this has to do with food.

471
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,510
Is it more likely to
happen if you're hungry?

472
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,690
That's what something worth checking out
because the next time you get worried

473
00:30:49,691 --> 00:30:51,760
in the middle of the day,
you might try eating something.

474
00:30:51,761 --> 00:30:56,320
I would recommend something high protein,
high fat rather than high carbohydrate.

475
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,910
And just see if that helps.

476
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:01,480
Because that might indicate that some
of your worry is a consequence of

477
00:31:01,481 --> 00:31:05,080
hyperglycemia. And that's a lot
more common than people think.

478
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:09,160
So if it's dreams and visions at night,
you know,

479
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:13,870
one of the things you can do that's
counterproductive is you take one of those

480
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:17,860
fantasies that's torturing you,
you know, and that you're Oprah,

481
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:22,870
you're suppressing because you will be
suppressing it and let it play itself out.

482
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,490
You see what's happening is
that the parts of your mind,

483
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,010
the parts of your brain,
the parts of your psyche,

484
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,170
that our alarm system,

485
00:31:33,171 --> 00:31:38,171
so that's the anxiety systems are they're
trying to think something through and

486
00:31:39,581 --> 00:31:42,550
they're using fantasy to think it through,
right?

487
00:31:42,551 --> 00:31:44,360
And so this is actually a form of thought.

488
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:49,400
It's torturing you because it's reasonable
for the parts of your brain that are

489
00:31:50,021 --> 00:31:54,280
on the outlook for negative occurrences
to think, well, what if, what if?

490
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:57,370
What if?
That's what thinking is.

491
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:01,810
And sometimes you think positively what
f and sometimes you think negatively and

492
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,310
well you're

493
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:09,640
in all likelihood doing everything you
can to escape from these thoughts when

494
00:32:09,641 --> 00:32:11,170
they make themselves manifest.

495
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:16,570
But all that does is make the systems
that are producing those thoughts even

496
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:20,860
more likely to produce them. Because
now they think the alarm system thinks,

497
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,720
oh, well here's the danger, which is
basically the vulnerability of children.

498
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:30,670
And I'm trying to present,
um, the active agent,

499
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:35,940
the person who I inhabit with evidence
of this potential threat as a good alarm

500
00:32:38,471 --> 00:32:39,304
system.

501
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,310
And it turns out that they're so afraid
of the message that I'm delivering that

502
00:32:43,311 --> 00:32:45,920
they won't even listen to it.
Therefore,

503
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:49,700
that situation must be much
more dire than I suppose.

504
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,460
And I'm going to amp the APP.

505
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:56,740
I'm going to have to amplify and increase
the emotion of my statement and the

506
00:32:57,741 --> 00:33:00,710
repetitiveness of the thought.

507
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,860
And so that's just not helpful at all,
right?

508
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:07,970
Because what you've done is you've taken
a worry and you've now recategorized it

509
00:33:07,971 --> 00:33:11,360
as a worry that so terrible that
you won't even think about it.

510
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:16,630
And so now the alarm systems think that
you're being chased by he who can't be

511
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:18,254
named.

512
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,340
That's a good way of thinking about it
and a good allusion to something popular

513
00:33:22,341 --> 00:33:26,000
in culture. And so they're just
going to be screaming nonstop.

514
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:30,230
So what do you have to do? Well,
man, this is counterproductive,

515
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:33,310
but I'll tell you it
works next time you have,

516
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,880
there's a couple of things you could do.

517
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:39,260
You could start by bringing
to mind those fantasies.

518
00:33:39,261 --> 00:33:41,570
Sit down somewhere,
take some deep breaths,

519
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,840
try to calm yourself
down a little bit and let

520
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,140
those thoughts come forward.

521
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:53,000
You know what they are and then watch
them like you're watching a movie.

522
00:33:53,001 --> 00:33:54,950
Even if it's a horror movie,
watched them.

523
00:33:55,100 --> 00:34:00,100
Let the whole fantasy play out and see
what what comes out at the end now at at

524
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:06,020
even if it's, it's going to be
frightening to do this. Now look,

525
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:09,890
even if the vision is quite horrific,
right?

526
00:34:09,891 --> 00:34:11,570
The entire thought is quite horrific.

527
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:17,390
You have now indicated to your anxiety
systems that you have enough courage to

528
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:22,391
face the worrisome event and just
that alone should be helpful.

529
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:23,991
Now,

530
00:34:23,991 --> 00:34:28,610
you may have to do this multiple times
and you might have to do it with all the

531
00:34:28,611 --> 00:34:31,460
thoughts and you'll know that you're,

532
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,010
you know that you will have done it.

533
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:39,190
You'll know that you've done it enough
when doing it starts to become mundane

534
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,880
when all the emotion goes out of it.
And if you're particularly frightened,

535
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:47,840
that might take a long time. Now the other
thing that you might really consider,

536
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,570
this is something you
can do as an adjunct,

537
00:34:50,571 --> 00:34:53,780
is you should think about what
you would do if this would happen,

538
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:58,190
if this happened, you know, as
if it happened in real life.

539
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:02,210
And to take even the worst case
situation, you know? So let's say,

540
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:06,980
let's say that you received the news
that your child would was hit by a car.

541
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,990
Well, you know, you could receive news
like that. And then the question is, well,

542
00:35:11,991 --> 00:35:15,110
what would you do and what you should,
what should you do?

543
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:19,700
And the answer is you don't know.
You think that that would kill you.

544
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:23,030
You think that that
would be unbearable and,

545
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:27,590
and the end of the world, and it's
not surprising that you think that,

546
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:30,410
but it's not helpful.
You know,

547
00:35:30,411 --> 00:35:34,760
because people have to live
through catastrophe and you
have more than one child

548
00:35:34,761 --> 00:35:35,241
apparently.

549
00:35:35,241 --> 00:35:38,490
And I would presume as well that you
have a spouse and other people that love

550
00:35:38,491 --> 00:35:40,170
you and need you.

551
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,200
And so it isn't good that you would fall
apart and die in an apocalyptic dread

552
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:51,780
if something happened to one of the people
that you love because then you would

553
00:35:51,781 --> 00:35:54,750
leave all the other people
bereft of you as well.

554
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:59,880
And that's not helpful.
And so if your child was hit by a car,

555
00:35:59,881 --> 00:36:04,230
well what would you do? We have to think
it through. You know, you'd grieve,

556
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,890
you'd go to the hospital,
you'd have a terrible time,

557
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,790
you'd have a terrible year,
you know,

558
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:14,970
and that would be that.

559
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:19,970
And you'd have the funeral and you'd have
the loss of the child and all of that

560
00:36:21,001 --> 00:36:24,420
would be
awful.

561
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,740
But people live through that.
You know?

562
00:36:28,741 --> 00:36:33,060
And maybe you could have an aim and
aim would be that if that happened,

563
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:38,040
your determination would be to live
through it so that you could be there for

564
00:36:38,041 --> 00:36:42,990
the rest of your people and so that you
wouldn't fall apart and collapse because

565
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:48,230
the death of someone and the subsequent
utter collapse of a person closely

566
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:54,570
associated with them, that that second
event does not improve the first one.

567
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:55,860
It makes it worse.

568
00:36:55,861 --> 00:37:00,861
And it's incumbent upon you to develop
the psychological strength to be able to

569
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:06,291
tolerate what it is that your anxiety
alarm systems are tormenting you with.

570
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:11,610
And you know, you might think, well
that's impossible, but you know,

571
00:37:11,611 --> 00:37:15,870
it's not impossible because people live
through catastrophe and they do that in

572
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:18,540
large part are no small part by

573
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,520
by discovering that there are darker
and stronger forces within them,

574
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,050
then they might be willing to appreciate.

575
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:32,340
And that one of the consequences of
integrating those forces is that you have

576
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,640
the strengths and the cruelty
in some strange sense to endure,

577
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:42,600
right,
to dare continue to live,

578
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,740
even if the unthinkable happens.

579
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:52,310
And it's no simple matter to think
of that as a moral step forward.

580
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,750
But you know,

581
00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:00,960
people are called upon to be strong
and strong in the face of the worst

582
00:38:00,961 --> 00:38:05,700
catastrophe. And your psyche is
tormenting you with precisely that.

583
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,260
You know, it won't let you go. It'll
shake you like a dog shakes a ride.

584
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:14,580
It won't let you go
until you deal with it.

585
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,800
Deal with mortality,

586
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:21,390
even the mortality of your children and
you find within you what would allow you

587
00:38:21,391 --> 00:38:26,220
to withstand that damaged
you're not to with stand up.

588
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:31,820
And you do that by letting yourself
go where your thoughts take you,

589
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,880
even though you don't want to.

590
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:40,570
That's a trip into the abyss.
You know,

591
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:45,010
that's a trip into the underworld
and those are best taken voluntarily.

592
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,730
You're being dragged down there by
forces that are beyond your control.

593
00:38:48,731 --> 00:38:53,731
And the mythological motif is that those
who are pulled into the underworld by

594
00:38:54,581 --> 00:38:59,290
forces beyond their control do
not come out, not come out easily.

595
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,950
It can be the end.
You know?

596
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:07,990
So you go there courageously.
And so if you're a parent,

597
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,520
one of the places you have to go
courageously is to that place where your

598
00:39:12,521 --> 00:39:17,521
children are ill or dying or deceased.

599
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,500
You have to do that.

600
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:24,430
You haven't grown up
until you have done that,

601
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:27,400
even though it's a terrible thing.
So

602
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,640
that's how you could deal with that.
It's a rough man, but I'll tell you,

603
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,680
it's a lot better than living in constant
worry that your children are going to

604
00:39:38,681 --> 00:39:43,390
be hit by a car, kidnapped, murdered,
or beaten up. So you know, you're like,

605
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:46,850
you're in a situation that
characterizes the situation.

606
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,040
Many people in life,
you don't have a good choice.

607
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,040
You've got to rough choices.

608
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:58,300
You could go left and that's rough
and you can go right and that's rough.

609
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,890
And that's all you've got.

610
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:05,250
And I would say you have the freedom to
choose which of the two difficult paths

611
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:07,600
you're going to choose.

612
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:12,900
And the one that involves voluntary
confrontation with what tortures and

613
00:40:13,841 --> 00:40:17,860
torments you.
It's a terrible Predator of death.

614
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:21,760
That's the pathway that's going to lead.

615
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:23,150
Okay

616
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:28,150
back to the stability that not only you
need but that your family requires you

617
00:40:29,121 --> 00:40:33,470
to have.
So that's that.

618
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,760
And you guys,
you're asking tough questions tonight.

619
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,460
News of real atrocities committed
by humans, especially torture.

620
00:40:47,461 --> 00:40:51,630
Leave me physically shell shocked
and paralyzed as if I had PTSD.

621
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:57,030
Is there something wrong with me?
Well,

622
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,970
you're, you're more sensitive
than the typical person.

623
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:03,840
Perhaps you're more imaginative,
you know, maybe you're more open.

624
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:08,700
You could take a personality test and
find out what your personality traits are

625
00:41:08,701 --> 00:41:11,970
that probably be the best. That would
really be the best way of figuring it out.

626
00:41:11,971 --> 00:41:16,110
My guess is that you're extremely
high and compassion, which is a,

627
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:22,190
an aspect of agreeableness and it's
the maternal aspect fundamentally.

628
00:41:22,261 --> 00:41:26,610
And so you're, you're probably
very high and compassion. Um,

629
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:32,610
I have a personality test at a site called
understand myself. You could go there,

630
00:41:32,611 --> 00:41:34,280
understand.com

631
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:37,790
you can go there and you could do the
personality test and that will help tell

632
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:38,270
you.

633
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:43,010
I would say that you're very high in
compassion and I would guess the are also

634
00:41:43,011 --> 00:41:45,410
very high in trait neuroticism,

635
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,950
which is the trait that measures
sensitivity to negative emotion,

636
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,780
anxiety say and emotional pain and the
combination of high compassionate and

637
00:41:53,781 --> 00:41:58,460
high negative emotion
sensitivity would produce,

638
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:05,260
would increase the probability of someone
suffering from the consequences that

639
00:42:06,051 --> 00:42:10,640
you described. If that was also
allied by Hio with high openness,

640
00:42:10,641 --> 00:42:12,830
which is the creative
creativity dimension,

641
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:17,120
it would mean that you're someone who
can get really lost in the stories of

642
00:42:17,121 --> 00:42:21,110
other people. So high people are high
in openness like fiction for example.

643
00:42:21,111 --> 00:42:23,480
And the reason for that is that they,
they,

644
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:28,760
they're imitative in some
sense cognitively they
can really take on another

645
00:42:28,761 --> 00:42:33,260
character and they can take that on to
the exclusion of everything else so that

646
00:42:33,261 --> 00:42:37,420
they're deeply engrossed in
the, in the story. You know,

647
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,720
someone who's high in openness,

648
00:42:38,721 --> 00:42:42,410
you can kind of tell a person like
that because if they're reading a book,

649
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:45,860
Fiction Book and you call
their name even multiple times,

650
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:50,300
they may not respond because they're
so deeply embedded in the narrative and

651
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:53,900
have become the characters to such a
degree that they've shut off the outside

652
00:42:53,901 --> 00:42:57,920
world and they're living in their
mediated imagination, you know?

653
00:42:57,921 --> 00:43:02,510
And so that'd be my guess with regards
to your personality traits, um,

654
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,300
if it's really affecting you,

655
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:10,010
like your statement is quite
extreme as if I had PTSD,

656
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:14,090
um,
to develop PTSD,

657
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:18,170
generally exposure to
malevolence is necessary.

658
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:22,430
And so that element of your experience
is in keeping with that statement.

659
00:43:22,431 --> 00:43:24,710
But PTSD is,

660
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:30,600
is relatively rare and generally requires
a very intensely traumatic personal

661
00:43:31,461 --> 00:43:33,350
experience.
Now,

662
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:38,960
one of the predictors of the development
of PTSD after exposure to trauma is

663
00:43:38,961 --> 00:43:42,710
something called depersonalization.
And some of you may have experienced this.

664
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:48,040
The personalization tends to occur when
something happens to you that's so far

665
00:43:48,651 --> 00:43:52,250
outside the manner that
you conceptualize reality,

666
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,500
that you cannot believe
that it's happening.

667
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,270
And so the d realization is that all of
a sudden you're in a world that doesn't

668
00:43:59,271 --> 00:44:03,680
seem real because something
that isn't possible by your,

669
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:09,020
as a consequence of your philosophy,
let's say your perceptual structure,

670
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:14,080
your value structure has just occurred
and posed a unspecified threat to the

671
00:44:15,351 --> 00:44:18,560
integrity of your entire belief system,
which is really what,

672
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,120
what happens when you develop post
traumatic stress disorder is the value

673
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,010
hierarchy that regulates your neck.

674
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,390
Negative emotion gets destroyed at some
fundamental level by your encounter with

675
00:44:29,391 --> 00:44:32,430
something that you didn't
believe could possibly

676
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:34,410
exist.
Um,

677
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:41,060
I doubt that your response is
sufficient to produce PTSD.

678
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,810
Um,
if that is the case,

679
00:44:45,811 --> 00:44:50,811
then you're sensitive to anxiety at a
level that far exceeds the normal and it

680
00:44:53,011 --> 00:44:56,070
might be worth going to
talk to someone about that.

681
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,410
It's possible that like,

682
00:44:58,411 --> 00:45:01,200
I don't know because you haven't
provided me with any information.

683
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:06,120
I don't know what your mood is like.
Like, are you, are you, are you depressed?

684
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:11,330
Are you anxious all the time? Right? Um,

685
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,280
you wake up in the middle of the night
and worry about things, you know,

686
00:45:14,281 --> 00:45:19,281
because maybe there's something that's
broader that characterizes dysfunctions

687
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:24,870
in your negative emotion systems
that, um, might be addressed.

688
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:27,870
Maybe you're going through a
particularly rough time in your life,

689
00:45:27,871 --> 00:45:31,980
and so you're hypersensitive.
It's impossible to tell from the context.

690
00:45:31,981 --> 00:45:35,460
But at least now you know a little
bit more about what might be,

691
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:39,810
what might be a resulting
in your responses.

692
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:46,513
Okay.

693
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:54,640
Cod Boone Ham.
Dr. Peterson,

694
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,450
I recently found out that my
father was a former Kamir Rouge.

695
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:07,660
Now the Khmer Rouge exiled and kill
millions of people in Cambodia.

696
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:09,940
So this is a rough discovery.

697
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:15,220
I feel hurt that he was part of the horror
in Cambodia. How do I deal with this?

698
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:22,243
Yeah.

699
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:23,891
Oh,
you know,

700
00:46:23,891 --> 00:46:27,610
the first thing I'd recommend is that
you read a book and the book's called

701
00:46:27,611 --> 00:46:28,570
ordinary men,

702
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:33,310
and it's a story about how
ordinary men in Germany,

703
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,590
policemen were

704
00:46:37,180 --> 00:46:42,180
trained and encouraged to become cold
blooded murderers of naked pregnant women

705
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:49,300
in Poland during World War II. And
it's a, it's a horrifying book.

706
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,030
Um, and so you might think, well,

707
00:46:52,031 --> 00:46:55,630
why in the world would you read
a horrifying book of that nature?

708
00:46:55,631 --> 00:47:00,631
And I would say because it will help
you understand that people who did such

709
00:47:01,061 --> 00:47:04,120
things were in niches,

710
00:47:04,121 --> 00:47:08,950
phrase human all too
human and might help you

711
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:12,890
bridge the gap between

712
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:18,030
the father that you thought you
knew and the father that once was.

713
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:23,840
And to bridge the gap between you and
those two if you understand that the sorts

714
00:47:25,861 --> 00:47:30,861
of things that your father may have been
involved or in or the organization at

715
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:36,040
least that he was involved with.
If you understand that people,

716
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,270
including yourself,

717
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:44,100
have the propensity to behave in that
manner and that it's not something unique

718
00:47:44,591 --> 00:47:48,790
to your father, terrible though
it may be. If it's part of the,

719
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,470
what would you say?

720
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:56,110
The eternal proclivity
for malevolence and evil,

721
00:47:56,111 --> 00:47:59,320
that's part and parcel of
the human spirit. You know,

722
00:47:59,321 --> 00:48:03,880
as the Catholics have always insisted
with their doctrine of original sin,

723
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,010
then that may allow you

724
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:14,980
to understand the situation
of your father better.

725
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:20,140
So that's the first thing is that you
have to learn something about evil and you

726
00:48:20,141 --> 00:48:22,570
have to learn something about
how it possesses people.

727
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,950
And you have to learn something about
how it possesses ordinary people.

728
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:30,850
And that will mean you'll have to learn
something about how it might possess you.

729
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:34,240
And that's rough learning.
So you've got rough learning to do.

730
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:38,530
And then the next thing I would say is,
look,

731
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,520
it was a long time ago.
Um,

732
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:46,180
and what's your father been like for you?

733
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:51,880
You don't like maybe he's changed.
You know,

734
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,490
people can repent and,

735
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:00,040
and rejoin the world
that the Christian idea,

736
00:49:00,041 --> 00:49:01,540
which is remarkable.

737
00:49:01,541 --> 00:49:05,770
One is that there's no sin that you can
commit that so terrible that you can't

738
00:49:05,771 --> 00:49:09,970
be redeemed. Now people laugh at
that idea because they think, well,

739
00:49:09,971 --> 00:49:11,200
that means that you can,

740
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:16,370
they think cynically that that means
that you can be the worst and most

741
00:49:17,171 --> 00:49:20,020
impulsive center possible
throughout your entire life.

742
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:24,780
And then conveniently in the moments
before death, repent and you know,

743
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:27,310
enter the everlasting kingdom of God.

744
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:32,810
And unfortunately it's not that simple
because to repent and to be redeemed is

745
00:49:34,331 --> 00:49:39,331
to truly understand what you did to allow
the parts of yourself that did that to

746
00:49:40,511 --> 00:49:43,090
wither away and die or burn away,

747
00:49:43,091 --> 00:49:47,860
which I think is a better metaphor
because there's plenty of pain involved to

748
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:53,170
chart a new course and just swear by
everything that's wholly that you're going

749
00:49:53,171 --> 00:49:56,230
to stay on it.
And maybe your dad did that.

750
00:49:56,830 --> 00:50:01,830
And so in which case your job is to
find out how even now knowing something

751
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:09,220
about the evil that can possess
people and even people that you love,

752
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:10,690
even yourself,

753
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:15,010
you'll have to find it
within you to forgive.

754
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:20,550
If you determined that this man with all
the hidden complexity that you've now

755
00:50:22,901 --> 00:50:27,901
discovered is someone you love and so

756
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:32,720
good luck. Cause that's
a, that's a tough road.

757
00:50:32,721 --> 00:50:37,070
You've got to walk there.
So I'd like I said,

758
00:50:37,071 --> 00:50:42,071
I would say read ordinary men that'll
teach you something that you need to know.

759
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:50,890
The Greeks is by anonymous.

760
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:56,170
The Greeks had the maxim know thyself.

761
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,400
How did we come to know ourselves in
terms of our personalities and more

762
00:51:00,401 --> 00:51:04,830
importantly potential?
Well,

763
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:10,991
you know,

764
00:51:10,991 --> 00:51:14,680
one of the things I often told my
students and my clinical clients as well,

765
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:18,790
I guess I probably told my
family members this as well.

766
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:23,770
Some of the many ways that one of the
first ways to come to know yourself is to

767
00:51:23,771 --> 00:51:25,030
understand that you don't,

768
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:30,490
and that y'all still know the
people you love very well.

769
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:34,810
But we'll get to that.
You know,

770
00:51:34,811 --> 00:51:37,900
you can learn to kind of watch yourself
like you're watching a stranger,

771
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:42,310
but you have to adopt a position
is a position of radical humility.

772
00:51:42,311 --> 00:51:47,020
I would say both.
Both humility in two senses.

773
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:52,170
So one sense would be the humility
of recognizing your ignorance.

774
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:57,430
So you have to understand that you don't
know who you are and that's not easy to

775
00:51:57,431 --> 00:52:00,700
understand because you think you know,
but then you know,

776
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:05,020
you remember you can't control yourself
very well. You're not very disciplined,

777
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:08,650
you're full of flaws. Maybe you don't
know yourself as well as you think,

778
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:14,610
but it's hard to get low
enough to understand how
deeply it is the case that you

779
00:52:16,961 --> 00:52:21,130
are ignorant about who you are.
Now there's an upside to that too,

780
00:52:21,131 --> 00:52:24,340
which also is that you're also
ignorant about who you could be.

781
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,460
And so the discovery of that,
you know,

782
00:52:27,461 --> 00:52:32,461
is some reward for the horror of
determining who you actually are.

783
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:37,270
Then I would say, well, well then
he watched yourself, you know, and,

784
00:52:37,271 --> 00:52:39,340
and you attend to your
conscience and you see,

785
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,470
you watch yourself like
you're watching a stranger.

786
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:45,240
You watch what you say and you
listen and you think, well, what,

787
00:52:45,241 --> 00:52:46,570
what sort of person would say that?

788
00:52:46,571 --> 00:52:50,200
And how am I reacting emotionally
when I'm communicating in that manner?

789
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:53,830
You know, is that making me feel
stronger or weaker? Is it, is it,

790
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:58,240
is filling me with shame? Is it
helping my confidence? Um, am I,

791
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:02,620
am I laying out a lie?
Am I deceiving myself and other people?

792
00:53:02,621 --> 00:53:06,730
Am I adopting this personality at
parties that is designed to impress,

793
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:11,410
into amuse? And that comes across as
nothing but like self centered narcissism.

794
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:16,450
Um, what are my dark fantasies?
What are my aggressive fantasies?

795
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:19,510
Um,
what is it that I'm willing to do?

796
00:53:19,511 --> 00:53:22,990
What am I interested in so that
all spontaneously pursue it?

797
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:27,450
What do I procrastinate about and why?
What am I unwilling to do?

798
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,450
What do I think is good?

799
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:35,820
What do I congratulate myself
for accomplishing and what
do I be rate myself for?

800
00:53:35,821 --> 00:53:39,840
Failing to confront and to implement?

801
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,570
Those are all incredibly
complicated questions and
you don't know the answers to

802
00:53:45,571 --> 00:53:49,050
them. So that's, that's a start.

803
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:52,890
And then in terms of potential,
well,

804
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:56,430
he'll discover a little bit more about
your potential as you discover who you

805
00:53:56,431 --> 00:54:00,480
are, especially the darker parts of
yourself because then you'd discover your

806
00:54:00,481 --> 00:54:04,740
potential for mayhem. There's some
real utility in that, you know,

807
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,740
discovery that you're dangerous.
It's such a useful discovery.

808
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:13,530
It's actually something that
strengthens you. Because the first thing

809
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:20,170
that a realization like that
can in fact produce is the,

810
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:28,790
the ambition to incorporate that danger
into a higher order personality that

811
00:54:28,791 --> 00:54:33,050
dangerousness into a higher
order personality. And that
can make you implacable.

812
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:37,730
I can make you someone who can say
no when you need to say no. You know,

813
00:54:37,731 --> 00:54:40,880
that can make you someone who
won't avoid necessary conflict.

814
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:44,270
And so that's unbelievably useful.

815
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:49,040
And so that's one of the potentials
that you might discover. Um,

816
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:52,040
the other thing you do to
discover your potential is to,

817
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:55,430
while you challenge
yourself, you know, it's like

818
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,400
rule four in my book,

819
00:55:00,401 --> 00:55:04,470
12 rules for life is comparing yourself
to who you were yesterday and not to who

820
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:08,950
someone else's today. And that's kind of
a good way to start this. It's like, well,

821
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:11,350
okay,

822
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:15,820
take a bit of a look at yourself and
think about what's not so good that you

823
00:55:15,821 --> 00:55:16,750
could improve,

824
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:22,060
that you should improve by your own
standards and that you would improve.

825
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:26,720
You know, and say yourself
a little goal. Um, you know,

826
00:55:26,721 --> 00:55:31,280
maybe you're not studying at all
at your university or maybe you're,

827
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:34,670
maybe you're at work and you've got
this stack of paper there, you know,

828
00:55:34,671 --> 00:55:38,390
and you haven't looked at that damn stack
for like a month and you know that you

829
00:55:38,391 --> 00:55:42,830
should be and your boy bothering yourself
at night because you're avoiding that.

830
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,680
It's like maybe they go,

831
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:47,270
I've avoided that stack of
paper completely for one month.

832
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,840
I'm quite a coward when it comes to
whatever snakes might be hidden in that

833
00:55:50,841 --> 00:55:53,600
stack of paper.
How about tomorrow?

834
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:58,601
I just like put that stack of paper
in front of me on my desk and I like a

835
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:03,410
glance through it for 15 seconds.

836
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:06,350
See if I can do that. It's like, well,

837
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:10,940
you set yourself a goal of improvement.
You know, it's a humble goal because

838
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:13,330
okay,

839
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:16,480
really are you such a coward that the
best that you can bloody well managed

840
00:56:16,481 --> 00:56:20,950
after a month of avoidance is 15
seconds of exposure to a stack of paper.

841
00:56:21,370 --> 00:56:25,240
You know, it could easily be
you've avoiding it, you're
obviously afraid of it.

842
00:56:25,241 --> 00:56:29,770
And so the situation could be that
dismal and dire and you might think,

843
00:56:29,771 --> 00:56:34,060
well Geez,
it's no bombed my ego.

844
00:56:34,061 --> 00:56:38,020
It's no, it's no, it's not fostering the,

845
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:41,650
the strength of my ego
to recognize myself.

846
00:56:41,651 --> 00:56:46,030
Someone who could only
withstand 15 seconds of exposure
to that thing I'm afraid

847
00:56:46,031 --> 00:56:48,520
of.
And so that's a form of humility too.

848
00:56:48,521 --> 00:56:53,521
It's like there's things you could do to
improve and you know what they are and

849
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:57,100
there's small steps that you could take
that you might take that would put you

850
00:56:57,101 --> 00:56:59,200
in that direction.
And then the question is,

851
00:56:59,201 --> 00:57:03,040
are you big enough to take
those small steps? You know,

852
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:08,250
are you capable of grappling with the
fact that you're fundamentally flawed to

853
00:57:08,951 --> 00:57:12,850
the point where you have to break things
down into almost child like steps in

854
00:57:12,851 --> 00:57:17,610
order to manage them and answer to that
is yeah, you are. And that's the lot of,

855
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,390
I don't know if it's a lot of everyone,

856
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:25,860
most people have things they avoid,
you know, and they're afraid of.

857
00:57:25,861 --> 00:57:28,380
So I would say to some degree,
it's the lot of everyone,

858
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:32,040
people vary in the degree to
which they've conquered that.

859
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:35,730
Then you do meet people from time to time
who were extraordinarily disciplined,

860
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:39,120
but most of the time they've got
disciplined in exactly this manner.

861
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:43,470
It's through slow incremental improvement
and then you challenge yourself.

862
00:57:43,471 --> 00:57:46,110
It's like, well, could I do
this? That would be better.

863
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:49,080
Then you find out and then you think,
well,

864
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:52,530
is there something slightly larger and
more challenging that I could do that

865
00:57:52,531 --> 00:57:54,080
would be better?
And,

866
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:59,040
and you try it and you find out and as
you try it and you find out generally you

867
00:57:59,041 --> 00:58:02,460
get better at it and you can take
on larger and larger challenges.

868
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:07,550
That's why I suggested again at 12 rules
for life and also in maps of meaning is

869
00:58:08,221 --> 00:58:11,550
that you know,
you take responsibility for yourself.

870
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:14,250
That was part of standing up
straight with your shoulders back.

871
00:58:14,251 --> 00:58:18,720
It's like take on the world man,
but only in the,

872
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:22,140
in the, in the, what would you say?

873
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:26,280
Only at the level that you
can manage. You know, when,

874
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:28,950
when you're deeply,

875
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:33,060
when you were ignorant and biased
and deeply flawed and immature,

876
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:37,110
it's where everyone starts.
You don't want to take,

877
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:38,850
you don't want to bite off
more than you can chew,

878
00:58:38,851 --> 00:58:43,110
but it doesn't mean that you can't
wrestle was if part of reality,

879
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:44,370
you know,

880
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:49,370
some part that's small enough so that
you have a good shot at victory and then

881
00:58:50,311 --> 00:58:53,070
you attain victory over some
small part of the chaos.

882
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:57,390
And then you're the person
who is victorious over chaos.

883
00:58:57,690 --> 00:59:00,390
You're just a beginner,
but that's who you are.

884
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:05,630
And then maybe you can get unbelievably
good at that and maybe you can ally to

885
00:59:05,671 --> 00:59:06,330
that.

886
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:11,330
The ability to recast tyrannical
order into chaos and restructured into

887
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:14,690
something
deeper,

888
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:18,830
more profound and more
suitable for human habitation.

889
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,080
That's the other half of the hero myth,
right?

890
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:26,290
Half is to overcome chaos itself and half
is to confront tyranny where it needs

891
00:59:27,381 --> 00:59:32,381
to be confronted to allow the
chaotic di Di di degeneration.

892
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:34,903
No

893
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:40,260
can allow the chaos to emerge
in place of the tyranny.

894
00:59:40,261 --> 00:59:43,680
And then two can recast that
into the order that's proper.

895
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:45,253
And

896
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:51,290
you do that by challenging yourself
humbly at the level that you're able to

897
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:55,740
function. That's right. And
you can think of it, you know,

898
00:59:55,950 --> 01:00:00,180
it's easier to understand if you think
about a child that you're trying to rear

899
01:00:00,181 --> 01:00:05,181
properly and you want to make that
child help that child reveal their,

900
01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:12,630
their highest potential, whatever
that is, whatever that means.

901
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:17,700
And what you do is you don't set them a
series of impossible tasks and the hope

902
01:00:17,701 --> 01:00:19,590
of undermining their self confidence,

903
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:24,860
you form a relationship with them that
is predicated on your interest in their

904
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:27,480
highest mode of being.

905
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:32,460
And then you offer them challenges that
are precisely optimize to durability,

906
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:36,240
right? So they can do them,
but they have to stretch.

907
01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:40,410
The two elements of their ability would
be what they can do and what and how

908
01:00:40,411 --> 01:00:43,140
much they're capable of and
transforming what they can do.

909
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:48,180
And an optimal challenge is stretches you
to the end of what you can do and then

910
01:00:48,181 --> 01:00:52,350
into the domain of what you have,
how you can transform.

911
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:54,870
And so if you love a child,

912
01:00:54,871 --> 01:00:59,871
then you set them tasks of that nature
and maybe they have a reasonable chance

913
01:00:59,881 --> 01:01:00,571
of success.

914
01:01:00,571 --> 01:01:05,160
A 70% chance of success or an 80%
chance of success might depend on how

915
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:08,400
sensitive your child is.
You do the same thing for yourself,

916
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:13,760
but you have to be humble and wise enough
to understand that you might have to

917
01:01:13,801 --> 01:01:15,210
aim pretty damn low,

918
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:18,810
especially in those places where
you're not functioning well.

919
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:22,950
And it might be so embarrassing
that you can't even,

920
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:27,390
that you can't bring yourself to fathom
that that's actually who you are.

921
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:28,650
But you know,

922
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:34,280
young describe the fool archetipal figure
the of the trickster and the fool as

923
01:01:35,101 --> 01:01:37,470
the precursor to the savior,
to the redeemer.

924
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:42,680
And that's unbelievable bit of wisdom
because what you meant was that to put

925
01:01:43,531 --> 01:01:47,220
yourself together,
which is to follow the path of redemption,

926
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,020
the fall of the redeemer,

927
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:54,240
if the Redeemer is a type of personality
that you could in fact be inhabited by

928
01:01:54,241 --> 01:01:55,230
our manifest,

929
01:01:55,650 --> 01:02:00,630
then this first step towards that
is to allow yourself to be a fool,

930
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:06,000
right? It's because you
don't know what you're doing.

931
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,650
You have to admit that,

932
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:11,780
and there's going to be a loss
of ego or destruction of ego,

933
01:02:11,850 --> 01:02:15,330
arrogant ego that
necessarily accompanies that,

934
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:19,860
but you need the laws of that arrogant
ego because it's precisely interfering

935
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:22,080
with your movement forward.
You know,

936
01:02:22,081 --> 01:02:27,081
it's part of the adversarial process
mythologically speak and it stops moral

937
01:02:27,151 --> 01:02:27,984
progress.

938
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:33,000
You're too proud of who you think you are
to notice what you're like so that you

939
01:02:33,001 --> 01:02:36,660
could change properly. You don't want
to sacrifice that part of yourself,

940
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:41,580
it's probably associated with some
delusion that helps you maintain,

941
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:46,440
uh, what would you say? A positive,

942
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:51,120
although very fragile self image, you
know, in the absence of genuine effort,

943
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:55,590
um,
it's not to be recommended.

944
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:57,413
So,

945
01:02:58,940 --> 01:02:59,773
okay.

946
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:02,750
Do you know yourself by
watching and paying attention?

947
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:07,820
That's why the Egyptians worshiped Horace.
The eye as a god,

948
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,830
they knew that attention was important.

949
01:03:09,831 --> 01:03:12,440
And the Ms Damien's did the
same thing with their God.

950
01:03:12,441 --> 01:03:17,360
Marduk it's not thinking exactly,
it's not imagination,

951
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:21,740
it's just, it's watching. Like
you're like you're a snake.

952
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,400
A snake,
you know,

953
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:29,400
is a symbol of wisdom in part because
a steak is a symbol of many things.

954
01:03:29,621 --> 01:03:31,240
But wisdom is one of them.

955
01:03:32,290 --> 01:03:36,340
I suppose it's because encounters with
snakes that can I, if they're not fatal,

956
01:03:36,341 --> 01:03:37,540
they make you wise.

957
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:43,390
Because snake watches like cold bloodedly
with no emotional reaction just to see

958
01:03:45,881 --> 01:03:50,200
what's there, doesn't allow,
symbolically speaking,

959
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:55,330
doesn't allow what is wanting or desire
to interfere with what is observed.

960
01:03:57,130 --> 01:04:00,760
So you watch yourself like that
as if you don't know who you are.

961
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:03,700
Well,
that's the beginning.

962
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:07,420
And then you challenge
yourself continually

963
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:15,230
to see how far past yesterday you
could push today and tomorrow,

964
01:04:16,070 --> 01:04:21,070
and to continually experiment with
expanding the domains not only of your

965
01:04:21,981 --> 01:04:25,130
competence, but of your ability
to increase that competence.

966
01:04:25,131 --> 01:04:30,131
And it's not obvious to me the upper
limit to that is proportional to the moral

967
01:04:31,191 --> 01:04:35,030
effort that you put into it.
The more that's guided by,

968
01:04:36,110 --> 01:04:40,160
by the highest of all possible visions,
right?

969
01:04:40,161 --> 01:04:43,550
The alliance with the highest of
all possible conceivable good.

970
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:49,870
And the more it's motivated by the more
it's accompanied by truth in speech and

971
01:04:50,631 --> 01:04:55,490
action,
the more you will develop your potential.

972
01:04:55,640 --> 01:05:00,640
And I believe that potential to be as
an unlimited in the upward direction,

973
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,210
more unlimited in the upward direction,

974
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:10,010
then it is unlimited in the
direction that brings people to,

975
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:16,510
to the political and social hell's that
so often characterize the world that we

976
01:05:17,771 --> 01:05:22,390
inhabit. And so you also, I suppose,

977
01:05:22,391 --> 01:05:26,110
have to be willing to undertake
that as an adventure because

978
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:28,440
okay,

979
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:33,000
it's a hell of a thing to bear. That
kind of responsibility. You know,

980
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:37,140
it, it takes, it takes a
person out of the ordinary.

981
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:41,280
It takes them out of themselves and

982
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:46,263
yeah,

983
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:48,360
and there's an innate,

984
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:52,470
there's an alienation and isolation that
goes along with that NSA and a great

985
01:05:52,471 --> 01:05:54,420
sorrow,
all of that together.

986
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,990
But there's deep meaning
to be had in it and it's,

987
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:01,980
and there isn't anything
better that you can do. So

988
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:05,850
that's the answer to that question.

989
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,193
Okay.

990
01:06:21,540 --> 01:06:23,040
Anonymous asks,

991
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:28,940
how do you reconcile the fact that Nisha
is often taken to be a precursor to

992
01:06:28,941 --> 01:06:33,941
postmodern philosophers such as food
co do the postmodernists misuse Nicha.

993
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,433
Okay.

994
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:46,770
Well, Nietzsche is a precursor to
the postmodernists. Okay. I mean,

995
01:06:46,830 --> 01:06:47,910
he's a precursor to

996
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:55,330
virtually every strand
of serious literary,

997
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:58,210
philosophical and psychological thought

998
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:01,010
since Nicha.

999
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:07,450
So for the entirety of the 20th and
the 21st centuries. And to say that he,

1000
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:13,950
the only way nature could not influence
the postmodernist would be if he wasn't

1001
01:07:14,471 --> 01:07:16,600
a great philosopher,
which he was.

1002
01:07:16,930 --> 01:07:19,540
Or if they didn't know his writings,

1003
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:23,710
which they do to some
greater or lesser extent.

1004
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:29,080
The postmodernist read Nietzsche,

1005
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:34,150
I would say as someone who was
essentially triumphal about the death of

1006
01:07:34,731 --> 01:07:37,280
Christianity and about the rise of,

1007
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:38,753
okay,

1008
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:44,960
the individual human, let's say
as the locus of values, but,

1009
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:47,510
but first of all,
I don't think that's true.

1010
01:07:47,511 --> 01:07:49,900
I don't think Nietzsche was
triumphant about that at all. I,

1011
01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:55,270
I think that he was wise
enough to understand that
catastrophic price we would

1012
01:07:57,561 --> 01:08:00,380
pay for the breakdown of our

1013
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:03,350
Meta narrative.

1014
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:08,000
See that the postmodernists
disbelieve above all,

1015
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:12,110
perhaps mean if you needed
one phrase to define them.

1016
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:14,910
It is that they don't
believe in Metta narrative.

1017
01:08:14,911 --> 01:08:18,950
So stories that that bring
communities together.

1018
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:23,360
Now you know there's a problem with
disbelief and Mehta narratives because I

1019
01:08:23,361 --> 01:08:24,620
don't know where you stopped.

1020
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:29,390
Like how big does a narrative have to
be before it's a Meta narrative and

1021
01:08:29,391 --> 01:08:31,580
therefore no longer worthy of belief?

1022
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:35,120
Do you end up not believing
in any narrative whatsoever,

1023
01:08:35,121 --> 01:08:39,680
all the way down to the bottom, which
means your entire value arc is destroyed,

1024
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:44,860
which means technically that you would
be unable to act because you act within a

1025
01:08:44,961 --> 01:08:49,520
narrative framework that posits that
one thing is more important than another

1026
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:52,700
and therefore worth
moving actively toward.

1027
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:58,070
So you lose that whole structure
and while you can't lose it,

1028
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:01,550
you're, you're done. It's, it's
not even technically possible.

1029
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:06,050
You might be able to fragment it badly.
That happens in schizophrenia.

1030
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:10,940
You might be able to subvert the positive
elements of it or have it subverted as

1031
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:13,220
happens.
In the case of depression,

1032
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:17,330
you might lose faith in it as
happens with the nihilists,

1033
01:09:17,331 --> 01:09:22,331
but there's no demolishing your
faith in narratives all the way down.

1034
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:25,970
So they,

1035
01:09:26,110 --> 01:09:31,110
they misuse knee chip in that manner
because they take his criticism of,

1036
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:35,940
okay,

1037
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:40,940
his criticism of Christianity and his
statement about the death of God damn

1038
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,610
indicate that all narrative has now

1039
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:47,570
become invalidated

1040
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:57,260
and they offer nothing as an alternative.

1041
01:09:59,650 --> 01:10:04,650
Now need you at least offer the idea
that you could create your own values.

1042
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:10,290
It's not obvious to me that
the postmodernists have

1043
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:15,670
incorporated that element
of Nietzschean thought.

1044
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:22,560
I don't think they misused nature.
That's the funny thing.

1045
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,960
It's not based on a
misunderstanding of nature.

1046
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:33,820
His pronouncement of the death of God was
his conviction that the Meta narrative

1047
01:10:35,751 --> 01:10:40,751
had disintegrated and that
the consequences of that
would be disintegration all

1048
01:10:41,001 --> 01:10:45,560
the way down the structure and the
postmodernists believed that that

1049
01:10:45,561 --> 01:10:47,420
disintegration,
this is maybe

1050
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:51,830
see it isn't obvious that
needs to thought that that was,

1051
01:10:59,610 --> 01:11:03,660
he thought it was inevitable.
I don't know if you thought it was right.

1052
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:06,420
It's not always obvious reading Nietzsche,

1053
01:11:06,421 --> 01:11:11,010
if he believed that the reason that God
had died was as he put it because we had

1054
01:11:11,011 --> 01:11:13,380
killed him. You know there's a, there's a,

1055
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:17,970
there's an idea of criminality
there that are carelessness.

1056
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:23,310
You see the same thing echoed in the
old Mesopotamian myth Enuma Elish where

1057
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:28,810
that younger gods get careless and kill
the father upon whom the rest that's

1058
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:36,000
Appsu and because of that chaos comes
back in the form of Tiamat to destroy all

1059
01:11:36,001 --> 01:11:39,870
of them. That's the same story
Nisha told with the death of God,

1060
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:43,080
and he does treat

1061
01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:50,170
the fact that God is dead as a murder
that was undertaken by careless human

1062
01:11:51,321 --> 01:11:54,920
beings and seems to hold us
morally responsible for that.

1063
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:59,210
And I don't believe the
postmodernists or sensitive

1064
01:12:00,130 --> 01:12:00,963
or

1065
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:09,430
I don't believe that there,
I can't,

1066
01:12:09,490 --> 01:12:10,690
I can't get the word right.

1067
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:16,700
I don't believe they've
adopted that element of,

1068
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:20,270
of niches Sorrell let's say the postmodern

1069
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:27,180
description of the demolition of
the narrative is triumphalist.

1070
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:29,880
It means that the old,

1071
01:12:29,910 --> 01:12:33,660
this is where it gets oddly mixed
up with Marxism in my estimation,

1072
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:37,710
it means that the old power structure,

1073
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:40,890
which was by definition,
tyrannical and oppressive,

1074
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:43,500
no longer has any justification,

1075
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:48,800
and those who were alienated and isolated
by that set of presuppositions can now

1076
01:12:49,771 --> 01:12:52,800
compete and take their rightful place.

1077
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:57,420
And so they replace,
it's a funny thing,

1078
01:12:57,421 --> 01:13:02,421
they replaced the overarching narrative
with a landscape of warring smaller

1079
01:13:04,381 --> 01:13:06,480
narratives that are tribal.

1080
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:11,960
And they disguise that to some degree by
associating them with ethnic and racial

1081
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:17,070
and sexual characteristics. Right.
Which seem immutable in some sense.

1082
01:13:17,071 --> 01:13:18,150
And therefore not.
So,

1083
01:13:18,151 --> 01:13:22,500
obviously tribal is a very tricky game.

1084
01:13:24,210 --> 01:13:27,810
They don't seem too as they
should extend their skepticism,

1085
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,390
even if they were avid
followers of nature,

1086
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:35,810
to the narratives that make up the notion
that there's something coherent and

1087
01:13:35,821 --> 01:13:37,950
useful and super ordinate,

1088
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:42,600
let's say about group identity
predicated on race, ethnicity,

1089
01:13:42,601 --> 01:13:43,620
and sexuality.

1090
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:49,070
And so that's not precisely a misuse
of that is a misuse of nature.

1091
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:51,090
I suppose it's,

1092
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:56,420
it's the arbitrary determination
of where his prognosis of narrative

1093
01:13:56,971 --> 01:13:58,560
degeneration would stop.

1094
01:13:58,710 --> 01:14:02,700
The postmodernists say it stops at ethnic,

1095
01:14:02,701 --> 01:14:06,090
sexual and racial identity and

1096
01:14:07,670 --> 01:14:11,890
I don't see a justification for that. So
they're, they're misusing of that way.

1097
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:17,620
Um, I think the people who
use Nicha properly, we're,

1098
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:21,730
I think that was young predict
it only Freud to some degree.

1099
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,590
But Freud solution,
although useful,

1100
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:30,280
was not as deep as niche as your lungs,
you know,

1101
01:14:30,281 --> 01:14:35,110
young solution to get to the problem that
needs your post was that we had to go

1102
01:14:35,111 --> 01:14:39,610
into the abyss to rescue the
father who had collapsed and died.

1103
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:44,500
And that meant to go to the darkest
possible places to find the brightest

1104
01:14:44,501 --> 01:14:49,210
possible light.
And I believe that was correct.

1105
01:14:49,570 --> 01:14:51,850
I think he can we go,

1106
01:14:51,851 --> 01:14:56,530
Paleo has said the same thing about Eric
Noi moments works, especially two books.

1107
01:14:56,680 --> 01:15:01,060
One called the origins and
history of consciousness,

1108
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:06,210
which is a great book. And so on my
list of great books on my website,

1109
01:15:06,211 --> 01:15:08,280
which you could go take a look at it,
it's a hard book.

1110
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:11,100
It's quite a bit like
my book maps of meaning,

1111
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,560
like they're really the
same book in a funny way.

1112
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:17,430
There's three books that are the same
that were published in the 20th century.

1113
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:22,710
Um,
there's young symbols of transformation.

1114
01:15:22,711 --> 01:15:25,770
There's Eric Norman's,
um,

1115
01:15:26,610 --> 01:15:30,750
origins and history of consciousness.
There's my book maps of meaning.

1116
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:33,690
I'm not stating that they're all
have the same quality by the way.

1117
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,740
That would be a bit on the
presumption was side or,

1118
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:39,300
and I guess you could also
include Joseph Campbell's book,

1119
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:43,200
the hero with a thousand faces.
They're all trying to tell the same story.

1120
01:15:43,201 --> 01:15:48,201
And that story is precisely the
reclamation of the fractured and mortally

1121
01:15:50,791 --> 01:15:54,840
wounded father.
So that's gone in the final analysis,

1122
01:15:54,930 --> 01:15:58,170
although it can also be your own
father or the father within you,

1123
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:03,780
or the four that you could
be from the, from the,

1124
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:06,090
from the abyss into which he's fallen,

1125
01:16:06,410 --> 01:16:11,410
and then incent ancient mom archetypical
motif that that's required of each

1126
01:16:13,801 --> 01:16:14,640
individual.

1127
01:16:15,150 --> 01:16:20,150
It's an existential requirement for each
of us to rescue our fallen society from

1128
01:16:22,351 --> 01:16:27,351
the abyss into which it's
eternally plunging that
requires our attention and our

1129
01:16:30,421 --> 01:16:35,370
sovereignty and our citizenship and
their ability to adopt responsibility and

1130
01:16:35,371 --> 01:16:37,470
our willingness to work,

1131
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,440
to envision and work
towards a better future.

1132
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:44,410
One that's better for better
in the Piagetian sense,

1133
01:16:44,430 --> 01:16:48,780
better in an integrated sense, right?
Better for you, better for your family,

1134
01:16:49,050 --> 01:16:50,310
better for the community,

1135
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:53,790
and to think that through carefully
and to understand that that's,

1136
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:59,960
that the world is structured so that
you're either doing that or you're

1137
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:06,670
wasting your potential in a manner that
allows terrible things to enter the

1138
01:17:06,671 --> 01:17:09,260
world.
And for me,

1139
01:17:09,261 --> 01:17:12,560
it was really the second realization
rather than the first that was

1140
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:13,490
transformative.

1141
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:18,240
It wasn't so much that I believed
that I could do good, that

1142
01:17:20,490 --> 01:17:25,240
motivated me to begin to be
a conscientious person and,

1143
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:28,080
and dedicated to,
to something.

1144
01:17:29,130 --> 01:17:34,130
It was the realization that in
the absence of that I would be

1145
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:41,250
a conduit through which things that
should not be allowed into the world would

1146
01:17:41,251 --> 01:17:45,420
pour, would inevitably
poor, even by mere inaction,

1147
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:48,750
even by merely not being
who I could have bee.

1148
01:17:49,450 --> 01:17:54,450
And that after I had read literature
on totalitarian atrocity and on general

1149
01:17:57,991 --> 01:18:00,390
criminal psychopathology so deeply,

1150
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:05,750
I couldn't allow that to be
something I would partake in.

1151
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:10,230
It. It, it,

1152
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:13,890
it was wrong enough in my estimation.

1153
01:18:13,891 --> 01:18:17,730
It appeared wrong enough in
my estimation so that I was

1154
01:18:19,870 --> 01:18:24,870
properly cowed into the sort of submission
that might possibly make you attempt

1155
01:18:29,711 --> 01:18:31,060
to be a decent person.

1156
01:18:31,990 --> 01:18:36,130
And whether or not I'm a decent person
seems to be subject to a substantial

1157
01:18:36,131 --> 01:18:40,590
amount of debate, some of which
I take part in myself. Um,

1158
01:18:40,810 --> 01:18:41,980
but I would say that

1159
01:18:47,530 --> 01:18:49,960
like there's been some
effort put in that direction.

1160
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:56,490
How have I prepared for my debate was yet,

1161
01:18:56,630 --> 01:19:00,830
what are your goals for the
conversation? To be productive. Well,

1162
01:19:00,831 --> 01:19:05,120
I haven't prepared enough,
but I've got tomorrow,

1163
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:05,931
you know,

1164
01:19:05,931 --> 01:19:10,931
and you can do a lot with one day I
want to review some more of ZX youtube

1165
01:19:12,531 --> 01:19:17,070
videos. I want to go through
a couple of his books. Um,

1166
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:20,600
I've got some good lists
of what seems central,

1167
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:25,400
but what I've done so far, I really have
25 minutes to make my case, you know,

1168
01:19:25,401 --> 01:19:28,640
the rest of it's discussion and Q and a.

1169
01:19:28,641 --> 01:19:33,641
And I'm not too worried about that because
it's easier for me to answer on the

1170
01:19:33,981 --> 01:19:37,430
fly than to deliver a prepared argument.
Um,

1171
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:40,670
there's something more
involuntary about it, you know,

1172
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:44,510
something more habitual anyways,
I don't know the reasons precisely,

1173
01:19:44,511 --> 01:19:48,080
but it's definitely easier.
We've got 25 minutes to make my case.

1174
01:19:49,250 --> 01:19:50,083
And,
uh,

1175
01:19:52,340 --> 01:19:56,330
the way I prepared for that was that
I reread the communist manifesto and

1176
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:58,370
thought it through.

1177
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,930
And I've identified what
I think the fundamental,

1178
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:08,200
every philosophical tree ties or
every tree dies that purports to be

1179
01:20:08,221 --> 01:20:13,221
philosophical is predicated on a set of
assumptions or axioms that make up the

1180
01:20:14,970 --> 01:20:17,940
undeclared articles of
faith of the statement.

1181
01:20:17,941 --> 01:20:22,200
And so I've tried to identify what
those are. Some of them anyways,

1182
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:26,490
I won't have time to cover all of them.
So I've identified let's say five,

1183
01:20:26,520 --> 01:20:31,140
it's going to be somewhere between five
and 10 and then I've thought through

1184
01:20:31,141 --> 01:20:36,141
whether or not they were
credible as axioms and I,

1185
01:20:40,430 --> 01:20:41,263
yeah,

1186
01:20:41,930 --> 01:20:44,870
I don't,
I don't believe that.

1187
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:49,310
I don't think I discovered a single
axiom in the communist manifesto that was

1188
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:50,144
credible.

1189
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:51,660
Okay.

1190
01:20:51,660 --> 01:20:54,060
I,
I discovered what I discovered instead,

1191
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:59,070
I think is that that tract was written
by two people who could think but who

1192
01:21:03,221 --> 01:21:07,630
couldn't think about what
they were thinking because
the propositions that they

1193
01:21:07,631 --> 01:21:12,631
put forward are so uncritically accepted
by the writers of the track that it's

1194
01:21:14,861 --> 01:21:17,710
actually a kind of miracle.
You know,

1195
01:21:17,890 --> 01:21:21,280
I'll just give you one example and I will
bring this up tomorrow in the debate,

1196
01:21:22,990 --> 01:21:27,990
Marx and Engels cause angles also help
write the communist manifesto appeared to

1197
01:21:29,321 --> 01:21:34,321
presume that and also to hope for and to
wish for and to work in a revolutionary

1198
01:21:34,721 --> 01:21:37,300
manner towards ensuring that

1199
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:43,540
private property would be abolished
and that that means of production.

1200
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:49,610
So the entire economy in some sense
would be held by the dictatorship,

1201
01:21:49,850 --> 01:21:54,850
dictatorship of the proletariat and that
would be a consequence of the working

1202
01:21:55,401 --> 01:22:00,110
class seizing control. But there's no
real development of that as an idea.

1203
01:22:00,111 --> 01:22:03,530
It's like, well, seizing control,

1204
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:09,280
how and and who like and just because
is it really the case that just because

1205
01:22:12,111 --> 01:22:16,070
it's members of the working class that
have now seized control of the means of

1206
01:22:16,071 --> 01:22:16,880
production,

1207
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:21,590
that they're going to be benevolent in
a way that the capitalists weren't mean.

1208
01:22:22,130 --> 01:22:27,130
That seems to be psychologically naive
beyond even the capacity of marks.

1209
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,720
Um,
and I,

1210
01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:33,590
I have to watch the sarcasm because
I'm going to try to keep that and any

1211
01:22:33,591 --> 01:22:38,510
potential anger at a minimum tomorrow,
but to not think that through. It's like,

1212
01:22:38,511 --> 01:22:43,511
and then well really you're going to
centralize all the production and,

1213
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:44,390
and,

1214
01:22:44,390 --> 01:22:49,010
and that's going to result
in better decision making
in a distributed market who

1215
01:22:49,011 --> 01:22:53,630
are going to be these geniuses that will
run the centralized decision making of

1216
01:22:53,631 --> 01:22:55,910
the dictatorship of the proletariat,

1217
01:22:56,150 --> 01:23:01,150
assuming that it isn't the most malevolent
of the proletariat that's risen up to

1218
01:23:01,251 --> 01:23:02,360
take control,

1219
01:23:02,540 --> 01:23:06,460
which is the most likely outcome if
you're not absolutely naive about human

1220
01:23:06,461 --> 01:23:10,030
nature.
And so the fact that,

1221
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:14,740
and then they both presume that somehow,

1222
01:23:14,741 --> 01:23:18,910
and this is not specified either either
the dictatorship of the proletariat,

1223
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:24,300
I suppose perhaps because it would free
the working class from the in slave

1224
01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:30,090
shackles of their labor and motivate the
more effectively that although they do

1225
01:23:30,491 --> 01:23:32,080
not elaborate on that,

1226
01:23:32,081 --> 01:23:37,081
you're left to guess that an
era of super abundance material,

1227
01:23:37,571 --> 01:23:42,370
super abundance would manifest itself
in which everyone would have what they

1228
01:23:42,371 --> 01:23:47,371
needed so that they could pursue their
creative endeavors in freedom and that

1229
01:23:48,011 --> 01:23:50,920
would constitute the communist utopia.
It's like,

1230
01:23:51,780 --> 01:23:52,240
okay,

1231
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:56,950
there's so many unexamined assumptions
in that set of propositions that it's

1232
01:23:57,010 --> 01:23:59,650
almost impossible to
know even where to start.

1233
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:04,810
It's like I don't understand how this
hyper abundance was supposed to manifest

1234
01:24:04,811 --> 01:24:06,250
itself.
Um,

1235
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:12,060
it certainly didn't manifest itself
in any actual communist countries. Um,

1236
01:24:12,910 --> 01:24:15,610
it's especially peculiar because Mark's,

1237
01:24:15,611 --> 01:24:20,611
even in the communist manifesto admits
that one of the things that communism is

1238
01:24:21,161 --> 01:24:26,161
really good at doing is producing
a surplus of commodities,

1239
01:24:27,550 --> 01:24:28,150
but,

1240
01:24:28,150 --> 01:24:33,150
and these are material commodities and
because and and so that seems to me and

1241
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:38,410
paradox of cold contradiction
with the whole communist,

1242
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:41,850
what would you call it?
Ambition.

1243
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:45,720
Because if it's hyper abundance that's
going to bring about the Marxist Utopia

1244
01:24:45,721 --> 01:24:48,120
and eventual classless snus and

1245
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:52,530
capitalism is good at
producing hyper abundance,

1246
01:24:52,531 --> 01:24:56,850
why wouldn't you just let the capitalist
system run out until it produced

1247
01:24:57,270 --> 01:25:00,270
universal hyper abundance
and we'd have the utopia.

1248
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:04,650
Now the Marxist answer to that would
because would be that it would be because

1249
01:25:05,550 --> 01:25:10,550
the selfish capitalists for structural
and and class based reasons would keep

1250
01:25:13,321 --> 01:25:17,880
all the excess production to themselves.
But God,

1251
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:22,350
that's a lot of pessimism with regards
to those on the capitalist side and a lot

1252
01:25:22,351 --> 01:25:25,200
of optimism with regards to
those on the working class side.

1253
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:30,320
No real understanding whatsoever of
their common humanity and common flaws.

1254
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:35,280
And then the idea that the best
way to read history is as the

1255
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:40,080
struggle between the
proletariat and the bourgeoisie.

1256
01:25:41,130 --> 01:25:46,130
That strikes me as almost
impossibly one sided and naive.

1257
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:51,420
Um, I won't get into that tonight
because I'm going to discuss that quite

1258
01:25:51,421 --> 01:25:54,300
substantially tomorrow. But, um,

1259
01:25:55,020 --> 01:26:00,020
first of all there's lots of reasons
for conflict and class position might be

1260
01:26:00,031 --> 01:26:03,830
one of them, but it is by no means
the only one. And even it was,

1261
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:08,990
there's no reason to assume that that's
a natural and unique consequence of

1262
01:26:08,991 --> 01:26:09,830
capitalism.

1263
01:26:10,310 --> 01:26:14,030
And so the other thing that's
staggering about Marx's

1264
01:26:15,590 --> 01:26:20,590
communist manifesto is it's absolute
the absolute absence of any form of

1265
01:26:23,690 --> 01:26:26,750
biological conceptualization.
You know,

1266
01:26:26,751 --> 01:26:29,330
and maybe that's not surprising
given when it was written. You know,

1267
01:26:29,331 --> 01:26:34,331
it was pre Darwinian biology has
really exploded in the 20th century.

1268
01:26:34,431 --> 01:26:38,600
But I read that track now and I think,
well you just didn't,

1269
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:41,990
you just don't know
anything about human nature.

1270
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:46,640
And I don't mean the human nature
that's on the surface, you know,

1271
01:26:46,641 --> 01:26:49,430
that we only share it with
other human beings. For example.

1272
01:26:49,431 --> 01:26:52,250
I mean nature itself and the nature of,

1273
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:57,770
of social interactions in the structure
of social hierarchies and the nature of

1274
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:02,620
implicit motivation. You knew none
of that. And like that's actually,

1275
01:27:02,990 --> 01:27:07,990
that's actually a big problem 160 years
later when we do know something about

1276
01:27:09,741 --> 01:27:13,580
human psychology and so,
well,

1277
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:15,500
and then the other thing I hope to do,

1278
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:20,780
see I've probably taken 15 minutes up
just to answer that and I've only got 25

1279
01:27:20,781 --> 01:27:21,614
minutes in total.

1280
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:24,950
The other thing that I want to do is
just lay out some of the statistics that

1281
01:27:24,951 --> 01:27:29,951
have been gathered over the last 10 years
by people like Steven pinker and Hans

1282
01:27:30,830 --> 01:27:32,860
Rosling and Marion Tupe,

1283
01:27:32,861 --> 01:27:37,861
yet human progress and just point out
the magnitude of the absolute economic

1284
01:27:39,891 --> 01:27:44,891
miracle that's occurring all around the
world as millions of poverty stricken

1285
01:27:44,931 --> 01:27:49,931
people are lifted out of abject and
horrible privation at a rate that's an

1286
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:57,230
that's incomprehensible
and that was unforeseen.

1287
01:27:57,680 --> 01:28:02,420
And so I don't know what a
Marxists does with that. Deny it,

1288
01:28:02,421 --> 01:28:04,090
I suppose.
Um,

1289
01:28:04,370 --> 01:28:08,990
certainly the working class in the U
S and perhaps elsewhere in the western

1290
01:28:08,991 --> 01:28:13,991
world has taken us a certain relative
hit as a consequence of opening up

1291
01:28:14,151 --> 01:28:18,920
competition to the rest of the world
and then being exposed to competition by

1292
01:28:19,340 --> 01:28:22,850
third world working class
people who could, you know,

1293
01:28:22,851 --> 01:28:26,390
work for lower wages.
But the net consequence of that,

1294
01:28:26,391 --> 01:28:31,391
as far as I can tell is that it's not a
mere opinion on my part that things are

1295
01:28:32,751 --> 01:28:37,751
so much better economically now
than they were like when I was born.

1296
01:28:38,570 --> 01:28:43,050
That
you can only describe it as miraculous.

1297
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:46,230
I mean one example, just one
example is the child mortality rate.

1298
01:28:46,231 --> 01:28:51,090
Now Africa is now the same as it was in
Europe in 1952 like that's within the

1299
01:28:51,091 --> 01:28:56,091
span of a single life taught and that's
in the poorest place in the poorest area

1300
01:28:56,221 --> 01:29:00,990
of the world. It's absolutely
miraculous and so you know,

1301
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:05,100
know 10 statistics of
that magnitude and well,

1302
01:29:05,101 --> 01:29:08,040
I'm going to review them and
make sure I get this correct.

1303
01:29:08,041 --> 01:29:13,041
10 to just make the case that while all
the dismal consequences of capitalism

1304
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:17,100
have fundamentally failed
to manifest themselves,

1305
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:22,340
especially in comparison to the sins of
other forms of communal organization.

1306
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:24,960
And so then after that,

1307
01:29:24,990 --> 01:29:29,370
well he'll have a chance to make his case
and we're going to ask each other some

1308
01:29:29,371 --> 01:29:34,110
questions. And then the moderator and
the audience, Oh, participated questions.

1309
01:29:34,111 --> 01:29:39,111
And I hope I can have a good conversation
with Jesus yet because he's an

1310
01:29:39,571 --> 01:29:44,571
interesting thinker and it isn't even
clear to me why he identifies as a Marxist

1311
01:29:44,701 --> 01:29:49,701
because he's creative enough in his own
right in some sense to be his own man,

1312
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:56,190
you know, to be his own
thinker. And so anyways,

1313
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:57,060
that's how I've,

1314
01:29:58,230 --> 01:29:58,880
okay,

1315
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:02,900
that's how I've prepared well that,
you know,

1316
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:05,900
whatever preparation,

1317
01:30:06,620 --> 01:30:11,120
40 years of thinking and
argumentation might also constitute.

1318
01:30:13,410 --> 01:30:15,420
So, okay, so look,

1319
01:30:16,290 --> 01:30:21,000
it's nine 30 and I've got a big day
tomorrow because I have to prepare for a

1320
01:30:21,001 --> 01:30:26,001
debate with [inaudible] and I have to
do a good job because it's an important

1321
01:30:27,031 --> 01:30:31,030
topic and
it could have,

1322
01:30:34,190 --> 01:30:35,023
yeah.

1323
01:30:35,410 --> 01:30:39,880
Repercussions that are of sufficient
magnitude so that it should be taken with

1324
01:30:39,881 --> 01:30:41,500
the utmost seriousness.

1325
01:30:41,950 --> 01:30:46,330
I hope I can keep my sense of humor
and I can keep my anger under control.

1326
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:51,540
I hope I can listen to him as if
he is someone who knows something.

1327
01:30:52,241 --> 01:30:56,440
I don't, I hope we can have a productive
discussion. I hope I'm prepared properly.

1328
01:30:56,980 --> 01:31:01,980
I let you all know that you can pick
up livestream tickets for that event.

1329
01:31:02,170 --> 01:31:05,140
That's at seven 30 tomorrow night,
eastern standard time.

1330
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:10,000
If you go to my website, you can find
it under talks, you can find the link,

1331
01:31:10,001 --> 01:31:13,510
but I think I've already put it
in the description of this video.

1332
01:31:13,870 --> 01:31:16,150
So if you want to
participate in this live,

1333
01:31:16,510 --> 01:31:19,900
then you can electronically anyways.

1334
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:22,780
Otherwise we will put the lecture,

1335
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:28,080
the discussion or the debate up on
youtube within approximately four weeks.

1336
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:33,160
And so
that's that.

1337
01:31:34,330 --> 01:31:37,840
I guess. Thank you all for tuning in. Um,

1338
01:31:38,050 --> 01:31:40,690
those were good questions.
We didn't get too many of them,

1339
01:31:40,691 --> 01:31:42,460
but they were deep and uh,

1340
01:31:45,490 --> 01:31:46,323
okay.

1341
01:31:46,630 --> 01:31:51,400
And well worth answering and, and well
worth contemplating. And hopefully,

1342
01:31:51,401 --> 01:31:56,401
so that mutual act of con participative
contemplation that we all just engaged

1343
01:31:57,761 --> 01:32:01,840
in,
we'll have salutary effects on each of us.

1344
01:32:02,290 --> 01:32:06,930
That would be the hope. So best
of luck to all of you and, uh,

1345
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:12,250
good luck moving upwards.
We'll see you in June.
