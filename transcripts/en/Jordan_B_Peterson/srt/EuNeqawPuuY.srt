1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,480
Thank you all very much.
Thank you,

2
00:00:05,481 --> 00:00:10,481
Barbara for first and second for 
attending.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,080
So I'm going to try to do something very
difficult this evening.

4
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:23,180
I'm going to try to put the idea of the 
rights,

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,650
the right to free speech in the broadest
possible historical context.

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,680
I want to start with a comment though.
You know we have an idea of built into 

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,700
our human rights legislation that all 
the rights are equal in some sense,

8
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,740
and that can't be true because rights 
conflict with one another and when 

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,520
things conflict they have to be 
hierarchically organized and what that 

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,731
means is that there's.
There's an implication that there is a 

11
00:00:51,731 --> 00:00:55,151
hierarchy of rights as well as the 
hierarchy of responsibilities and that 

12
00:00:55,151 --> 00:00:58,601
it's also incumbent on us to determine 
the nature of that hierarchy and to 

13
00:00:58,601 --> 00:00:59,930
determine what constitutes the 
sovereign,

14
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:05,470
let's say the sovereign right and I 
would say you might think of that as a 

15
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:09,371
modern conundrum that would only be of 
interest to countries that have 

16
00:01:10,551 --> 00:01:12,560
formalized bills of rights,
for example,

17
00:01:12,561 --> 00:01:14,300
but it's not a new problem.

18
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,300
It's an extraordinarily old problem 
because there is no difference between 

19
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,180
determining the hierarchy of your rights
and determining how to live together 

20
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,050
successfully.
It is exactly the same problem.

21
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:32,190
One is only articulated in the legal 
forum and the problem of how we should 

22
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,240
live together in the most productive 
possible manner.

23
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,710
Everything considered is as old as 
mankind itself.

24
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:44,711
In fact,
I would say far older than now because 

25
00:01:44,711 --> 00:01:47,200
the same problem the devil's social 
animals weigh down the phylogenetic 

26
00:01:47,451 --> 00:01:51,380
chain and so this is an unbelievably 
archaic problem now.

27
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:57,070
Years ago when I started thinking,
I suppose in in earnest,

28
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:04,050
I was trying to address what I later 
recognized as a postmodern problem and 

29
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:10,810
the problem was this was in the late 
seventies and early eighties when the 

30
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,240
Cold War was madly raging because it 
peaked in 1962 and it peaked again in 

31
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,770
about 1984 votes.
And of course at that time people were 

32
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,131
very terrified about potential outcome 
of the Cold War and for very good 

33
00:02:24,131 --> 00:02:24,131
reason.

34
00:02:24,131 --> 00:02:25,430
And I was curious about.
I was curious about this,

35
00:02:25,431 --> 00:02:28,670
like insanely curious about it.
It was obsessing me.

36
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,890
I couldn't understand.
Two things,

37
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:36,010
I couldn't understand why the world has 
divided itself into two opposing 

38
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,210
narratives,
why that had happened at all,

39
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,730
and also why these narratives were of 
such importance to people apparently 

40
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,561
that we were willing to arm ourselves 
far beyond the teeth and risk massive 

41
00:02:48,141 --> 00:02:52,320
mutual annihilation to battle the battle
out.

42
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,070
The conflict between these two ways of 
looking at the world.

43
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,370
And I was curious.
I mean,

44
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:01,780
first the first question were these 
merely two ways of looking at the world 

45
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,270
now because you might think,
well,

46
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,380
there's,
there's no shortage of ways to live in 

47
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:09,380
the world.
That's a moral,

48
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,650
morally relativistic stance and there's 
something to that obviously because 

49
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:13,650
people,
different people,

50
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,290
different occupations and a different 
outlook and,

51
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:17,620
and so forth at different,
different political beliefs.

52
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,290
So there's obviously many ways that we 
can thrive in the world.

53
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:25,470
And so some degree of flexibility with 
regards to what constitutes your 

54
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,750
fundamental axioms,
obviously is,

55
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,900
is necessary.
Um,

56
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,160
but there's a deeper question and this 
is a very deep question.

57
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,950
I actually think it's the question at 
the bottom of the postmodern conundrum,

58
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:38,160
which is whether or not there are any,
um,

59
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,320
reliable Meta narratives,
let's say overarching narratives that 

60
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:43,320
can unite people in some fundamental 
way.

61
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:48,490
And so I was curious where were these 
just to arbitrary ways of looking at the

62
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:53,491
world both potentially equally valid and
where we are battling that out because 

63
00:03:53,591 --> 00:03:58,591
we didn't know and there was no other 
way to battle it out or was there 

64
00:03:58,591 --> 00:04:01,921
something deeper at stake?
Was it possible that one or the other 

65
00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:05,491
system was correct in some deep manner?
And I believe I do truly believe that I 

66
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,880
entered that

67
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,980
that universe of questions,
let's say with as openness of mind is 

68
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:16,390
possible because I actually wanted to 
find out the answer,

69
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:16,990
you know,
because.

70
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,030
Well,
it seemed to me the fundamental question

71
00:04:19,031 --> 00:04:24,031
that obviously we fought a whole cold 
war about it was the fundamental 

72
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:24,031
question.
Who was this?

73
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:26,650
It was the question everyone's minds 
should have been concentrated on.

74
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,600
And so I started to study deeply this,
this particular question.

75
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:32,650
The first question was,
well,

76
00:04:32,651 --> 00:04:35,050
what were beliefs made out of like what 
exactly is it?

77
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,160
What are.
What are we talking about when we talk 

78
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,160
about a belief,
what does it mean that you have beliefs,

79
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,750
our beliefs structured and also that was
a psychological question rather than a 

80
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,020
political or economic question and that 
took me a long time to figure out 

81
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,901
because I didn't know if the fundamental
mental question was going to be 

82
00:04:51,901 --> 00:04:54,331
sociological or political or economic or
psychological energy turned out to be 

83
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:56,790
psychological or perhaps it turned out 
to be spiritual.

84
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,820
That's another way of thinking about it 
and if,

85
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,560
if you could grasp beliefs,

86
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,970
what would constitute a credible belief 
and what would it mean for a belief to 

87
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:21,321
be credible?
And I can give you a little hint about 

88
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:21,321
that.
I learned this from Shawn Psj,

89
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,220
the developmental psychologists,
brilliant,

90
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:27,180
brilliant theorists,
genuine genius.

91
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:32,450
He was interested in how children 
organized games and he thought it's 

92
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:36,021
games,
the organ or the Organization of Games 

93
00:05:36,021 --> 00:05:37,560
by children as the precursor to adult 
interaction.

94
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,590
And he made some very interesting 
observations about games.

95
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,750
You know,
especially pretend games which are quite

96
00:05:42,751 --> 00:05:45,690
sophisticated because children will get 
together and play pretend games and what

97
00:05:45,691 --> 00:05:48,720
they'll do is they act out a simulation 
of the world.

98
00:05:48,721 --> 00:05:51,330
Maybe they play house,
they all get together and they cast each

99
00:05:51,331 --> 00:05:56,331
other in different roles and then they 
each act out those roles and they do 

100
00:05:56,331 --> 00:06:00,231
that and now in order to simulate 
something that they're going to have to 

101
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:00,231
adapt to.
But he has.

102
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:04,930
Jay noted a couple of things.
The first thing you noted was that 

103
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,170
children playing games can play the 
games in a group.

104
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,110
Thank you very much.
Can play a game in a group.

105
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,300
But if you take them out of the group 
and you ask them what the rules of the 

106
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:15,300
game are,
they don't know.

107
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,110
They can't articulate the rules of the 
game yet.

108
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,420
When you put them together in the group,
they can play the game.

109
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,850
And I thought,
oh that's just like adults.

110
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,100
You see because.
Because.

111
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:30,380
Well,
because we wouldn't need a psychology 

112
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:30,380
otherwise,
right?

113
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:30,380
Because we'd all be transparent to 
ourselves already.

114
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:35,410
So what that means is when we all get 
together and play a game like the one 

115
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:35,420
that we're playing in this room,
for example,

116
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,940
we all can play the game when we're 
together,

117
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,010
but if we brought us out and said,
well,

118
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:42,140
what are the rules,
we wouldn't able to articulate them.

119
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,560
And then I thought,
well that means that those rules evolve 

120
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,050
in a real sense.
Like they evolved in a behavioral 

121
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:50,050
competition and I thought,
well that's.

122
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,440
That's a lot like what's happening with 
animals.

123
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,480
If you look at how a chimpanzee troop is
organized or a wolf pack and social 

124
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,610
animals for that matter,
going way down the phylogenetic chain,

125
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,140
they have to interact with one another 
in a manner that that sustains the group

126
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:08,141
because otherwise they all die obviously
and it sustains the individuals within 

127
00:07:08,141 --> 00:07:10,250
the group and offers the individual some
some scope of action.

128
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:15,580
And so there's a set of implicit 
constraints on the manner in which 

129
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,150
creatures interact or they don't live.
And and Piaget also came to the same 

130
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:22,010
conclusion with regards to children's 
games.

131
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:27,310
And this is where he made a distinction 
that's so crucial because piaget was 

132
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:31,361
actually interested in bridging the gap 
between science and religion and I was 

133
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:32,160
his fundamental,
it's fundamental motivation,

134
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:37,161
although very few people know that and 
he was interested in bridging the gap 

135
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:40,541
between science and ethics and,
and he was interested in how ethics 

136
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:43,480
evolved as a,
as a concept and then as practically 

137
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,840
applicable as something that was 
practically applicable.

138
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,410
And he made some very interesting 
comments about games and said,

139
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:51,260
well look what,
what constitutes a good game?

140
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:52,910
Ah,
well,

141
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:58,270
one rule is everybody plays voluntarily.
That's a really good game.

142
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,610
And then he made another claim which was
quite cool,

143
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:04,760
which was imagine that you had a game a 
and B and b,

144
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:07,740
and they were competing against the 
target and in,

145
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:12,790
in game beat,
people were being forced to play in a 

146
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,950
game a people were playing voluntarily 
and then you track their track record 

147
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,100
with regards to competitors advantage.
Over time,

148
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,880
the game that people were playing 
voluntarily would win because the people

149
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:22,760
who were playing wouldn't have to waste 
any effort in enforcement costs.

150
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,900
I said,
Oh God,

151
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:28,901
that's so smart.
It's so smart because because you can 

152
00:08:28,901 --> 00:08:32,141
see the idea of the emergence of an 
ethic theory and not an ethic that's 

153
00:08:32,141 --> 00:08:32,360
rationally constructed.

154
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,320
It's an ethic that's actually emerging 
from the board.

155
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:36,660
I'm up now.
If the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche,

156
00:08:36,661 --> 00:08:41,661
he also pointed out that are,
that are epic actually emerged from the 

157
00:08:41,661 --> 00:08:41,661
bottom up.
It wasn't rational.

158
00:08:41,661 --> 00:08:44,300
It wasn't top down.
It wasn't enlightenment oriented.

159
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:49,301
Even though the enlightenment might've 
codifying it as part of a process of 

160
00:08:49,301 --> 00:08:53,420
notification that took place over a very
long period of time and so and then I 

161
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,740
read other things to say about the way 
that animals organized the troops.

162
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,420
This was later,
but it's relevant to our talk today that

163
00:08:59,421 --> 00:09:04,421
primatologist Frans de Waal for example,
is trying to find out what makes 

164
00:09:04,421 --> 00:09:05,250
chimpanzee troops stable across time.
And you know,

165
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:08,730
you kind of have this idea that a 
chimpanzee troop is driven,

166
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,770
let's say,
by the most dominant,

167
00:09:10,771 --> 00:09:12,660
powerful male,
the most aggressive,

168
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,260
cruel,
tyrannical chimpanzee dominates.

169
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:18,300
And that isn't what friends do all 
found.

170
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:23,630
What he found was that in order that 
those sorts of chimpanzee troops have 

171
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,801
leaders that meet very violent and 
because no matter how Thai radical you 

172
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,870
are as top Cim to chimps,
three quarters of your size can take you

173
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:34,200
out and they will and chimpanzees are 
unbelievably,

174
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,820
unbelievably brutal and very,
very strong and so tyrannical chimpanzee

175
00:09:38,821 --> 00:09:40,110
troops are unstable.

176
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,310
It's like that's how major league 
discovery now because it starts to.

177
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,520
It starts to open up the possibility 
that the ethic upon which functional 

178
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,800
states are predicated is far deeper than
any near story or any near rationality,

179
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:57,890
and that's a really exciting possibility
because what it means is that there 

180
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,640
might be something at the bottom of our 
ethic that's really there.

181
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,280
It's not just some arbitrary constructed
narrative.

182
00:10:02,281 --> 00:10:07,281
It's not just one set of ways to live in
the world among many and I would say I 

183
00:10:07,281 --> 00:10:08,590
would say,
and I tried to outline this partly in 12

184
00:10:08,591 --> 00:10:13,591
rules for life and more in detail in 
maps of meaning that the evidence on 

185
00:10:13,591 --> 00:10:17,151
that is already in is that there is a.
There is a convergence ethic that 

186
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:22,791
emerges from the bottom up over 
evolutionary spans of time over millions

187
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,830
of years,
over hundreds of thousands of years or 

188
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,421
tens of thousands of years as people 
learn how to act in a manner that 

189
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:33,870
sustains them as individuals now and a 
week from now,

190
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,340
a month from now,
a year from now,

191
00:10:35,341 --> 00:10:39,540
so it has to be iterative that sustains 
them and their families simultaneously.

192
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:44,690
It sustains them and their families and 
their communities across all those 

193
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,140
timeframes simultaneously and that's a 
very,

194
00:10:46,141 --> 00:10:51,141
very tight set of constraints and so 
there might be a very large number of 

195
00:10:51,141 --> 00:10:54,801
ways to interpret the world as the 
postmoderns postmodernists accurately 

196
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:56,640
have it,
but there are not a very large number of

197
00:10:56,641 --> 00:10:59,340
ways to exist successfully in the world.
In fact,

198
00:10:59,341 --> 00:11:04,341
it's extraordinary to constraint.
It's constrained by the necessity of 

199
00:11:04,341 --> 00:11:08,061
playing an iterative voluntary game and 
that's a tight constraint as any of you 

200
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:09,090
who are married.
No.

201
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,500
Right.
Well,

202
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,600
I mean,
I mean there's absolutely definitively 

203
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,730
because you see the marriages are very 
interesting balancing act because it has

204
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:19,950
to be good for you and it has to be good
for your wife,

205
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:24,951
let's say,
but it also has to be good for the two 

206
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:27,171
of you and it has to depend.
Maybe that's super ordinary to each of 

207
00:11:27,171 --> 00:11:30,321
you as individuals and it has to be good
for you in a way that's good for your 

208
00:11:30,321 --> 00:11:33,651
children and that has to work in society
and it has to be something that you can 

209
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,500
play out moment by moment and hour to 
hour,

210
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,600
day to day and month to month and week 
to week.

211
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:40,140
And you know,
you know perfectly well that there isn't

212
00:11:40,141 --> 00:11:43,320
much deviation from the straight and 
narrow path if you're going to play that

213
00:11:43,321 --> 00:11:48,321
game because there's just too many ways 
of falling into trouble and there's way 

214
00:11:48,321 --> 00:11:49,410
more ways of falling into trouble.
The North falling into trouble.

215
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,320
Okay?
So,

216
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,500
so that's the first thing.
So imagine this.

217
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:53,950
So this is the,
this is the idea.

218
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:54,390
So

219
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,950
the ethic emerges from the bottom up.
As we learn how to organize ourselves in

220
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:02,010
evermore complex society,
sustainable societies,

221
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,440
and we don't know what we're doing,
okay,

222
00:12:04,441 --> 00:12:09,441
but then what happens is because we are 
insanely curious and capable of self 

223
00:12:09,441 --> 00:12:10,890
recognition,
we start to tell stories about how it is

224
00:12:10,891 --> 00:12:13,740
that we're acting and the stories have 
two forms.

225
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:18,660
One story is about the structures that 
we exist in and that's the stories about

226
00:12:18,661 --> 00:12:20,610
other people and every stories about 
other people,

227
00:12:20,611 --> 00:12:25,611
right?
Because we live in a social world and 

228
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:25,611
you never see a story.
You never go to a movie,

229
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:29,451
you never read a novel that he isn't 
about society and no wonder because 

230
00:12:29,451 --> 00:12:31,800
that's our environment society.
So stories are about society and they're

231
00:12:31,801 --> 00:12:36,801
about how societies succeed and fail and
there about how individuals within that 

232
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:41,181
society succeed or fail.
Because what we're trying to do is to 

233
00:12:41,181 --> 00:12:41,181
watch her.

234
00:12:41,181 --> 00:12:43,010
So I mean again,
over the massive historical timeframes.

235
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:48,210
We're trying to watch how it is that we 
act when we act properly and figure out 

236
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:51,771
how to do it as individuals.
And the first way we do that is to coat 

237
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,250
it in stories.
That's what stories are for.

238
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,440
That's what great literature is for.
That's why there are great villains and 

239
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,921
great heroes and great literature 
because you want to know how to be a 

240
00:13:00,921 --> 00:13:04,011
great hero unless you want to be a great
villain and if you want to be a great 

241
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:07,581
hero,
you can learn from great villains the 

242
00:13:07,581 --> 00:13:07,830
opposite of how to act and so you get.
You get incredible,

243
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,160
incredibly sophisticated representations
emerging out of that process so that 

244
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,670
they take on an archetype of form,
so for example,

245
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:19,910
the the,
the motif of the hostile brothers which 

246
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,320
has developed into and Christianity into
the twin adversaries of Christ and Satan

247
00:13:22,321 --> 00:13:27,321
or Cain and Abel are the idea of the 
hero who thrives in the social world and

248
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,850
brings renewal to the cosmos,
so to speak,

249
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:34,851
against the deadly adversaries.
And that's exactly what you need to 

250
00:13:34,851 --> 00:13:34,851
know.
And again,

251
00:13:34,851 --> 00:13:39,351
it's not arbitrary.
It's not an arbitrary set of 

252
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,931
propositions.
It's predicated on the observation of 

253
00:13:41,931 --> 00:13:42,480
successful and unsuccessful patterns of 
behavior over very,

254
00:13:42,481 --> 00:13:43,250
very,
very,

255
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,320
very long stretches of time.
So there's a behavioral platform and 

256
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,660
then there's a narrative representation 
of that platform.

257
00:13:51,661 --> 00:13:56,661
Then the two things start to interact 
because once you have drama and 

258
00:13:56,661 --> 00:13:59,751
literature,
you can learn from drama and literature 

259
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:02,151
and ultra how you behave and your ethic 
becomes portable and then what happens 

260
00:14:02,151 --> 00:14:02,730
after that is that

261
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:11,130
what happens after that is that thinkers
who now have both the behavioral strata 

262
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,050
and the representational strata in front
of them,

263
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,280
the procedural ethic,
that behavioral ethic plus the story 

264
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:20,470
representation.
Step one,

265
00:14:20,471 --> 00:14:22,930
step back from that,
especially after it's written down.

266
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,090
This is why the Bible are of such 
critical importance because the pattern,

267
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:33,091
the dramatic patterns are then written 
down and then you can step back from 

268
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:34,390
them with your consciousness and you can
start to analyze them for their,

269
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:39,690
for the rule based content.
You see that emerging to some degree in 

270
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:43,351
the story of Moses.
That's actually what's laid out in part 

271
00:14:43,351 --> 00:14:45,751
in the story of Moses because Moses is 
leading his people through the desert 

272
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:49,140
and watching how they fight and watching
how they behave and then he has this 

273
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:49,140
tree,
so it's all very,

274
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,701
very dramatic.
Then he has this tremendous revelation 

275
00:14:53,701 --> 00:14:54,730
which is this is how we already act.

276
00:14:55,310 --> 00:15:00,310
Right?
And so what happens is the rules are 

277
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,240
codified on the basis of the observation
of the patterns that are already extent 

278
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,370
that are functional as the 
transformation of consciousness.

279
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:09,610
At that point you have your ethic,
which is far deeper than anything that 

280
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,181
you can imagine,
start to be articulated out into the 

281
00:15:13,181 --> 00:15:13,610
body of laws,
and that's the point at which you have,

282
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,860
let's say,
true philosophy and the beginning of the

283
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:20,861
body of laws.
It's called the body of laws for a 

284
00:15:20,861 --> 00:15:20,861
reason.
And so,

285
00:15:20,861 --> 00:15:25,270
oh,
I thought that was all just amazing to 

286
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,180
have who have to have observed them to 
think about that bottom up process.

287
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:31,490
Then I started reading a lot of 
religious mythology and I ran across 

288
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,651
this motif that was developed very in 
great detail by a Romanian Murcia,

289
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:38,450
Eliana,
who is a great scholar of religion.

290
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:43,451
So group wrote remarkable,
remarkable books including a history of 

291
00:15:43,451 --> 00:15:44,660
religious ideas,
which is highly recommended book.

292
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:49,660
And he talked about this interesting 
motif that I had run across and other 

293
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,710
writings on mythology and and,
and in religious stories,

294
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,500
which was the battle of the Gods in 
heaven across time.

295
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:56,900
And one of the things they pointed out 
was that if you,

296
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,300
if you looked at the development of 
religious system,

297
00:15:59,301 --> 00:16:04,301
so say the development of the religious 
system that came to dominate in 

298
00:16:04,301 --> 00:16:05,240
Mesopotamia when the Mesopotamian tribes
came together.

299
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,390
So imagine each of those tribes have 
their own gone,

300
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,170
right.
And then when they came together,

301
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:14,410
that was terribly fractious because you 
know what happens when different people 

302
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:17,291
with different gods get together,
it's suddenly it's ugly and it's no 

303
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,590
wonder because you know,
they each have an ethic and they,

304
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:23,630
they're living within the ethic and 
they're using it to structure their 

305
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:23,630
worlds.
But the ethics apparently Clyde.

306
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:28,480
And so what happens at the civilization 
level is that there's constant 

307
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,640
negotiation and cognitive transformation
within the individual populations,

308
00:16:31,641 --> 00:16:36,641
but that's represented over the large 
span of time as a battle between the 

309
00:16:36,641 --> 00:16:38,210
gods that represent the different tribes
in heaven.

310
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:42,290
And so then what happens across time as 
all those gods organized themselves into

311
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:46,400
a hierarchy and one God comes out on top
and that God is the Supreme God.

312
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,560
And then the society is like 
Mesopotamia,

313
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,050
Mesopotamia.
That also happened in ancient Greece.

314
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:56,500
They assume that they're sovereign is 
the person who acts out in a sovereign 

315
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,620
God because you might say,
well,

316
00:16:57,621 --> 00:17:00,260
where does the concept of sovereignty 
come from?

317
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:05,590
Right?
If it's not just brute force and it's 

318
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,020
not because brute force doesn't work,
it has to have some other basis.

319
00:17:06,021 --> 00:17:09,950
What's the basis of sovereignty?
What's the basis of authority?

320
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,930
Not Power Authority,
competence,

321
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,250
authority,
right?

322
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,400
Well how has that played out?
It's played out by the battle between 

323
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,360
ethics systems of ethics that are 
represented in religious language across

324
00:17:20,361 --> 00:17:25,361
vast epochs of time,
and then the societies of God's would 

325
00:17:25,361 --> 00:17:29,240
say organize themselves into a hierarchy
and they have a god at the top and 

326
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,520
that's actually laid right out in the 
Enuma elish for example,

327
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:36,521
which is the oldest creation story that 
we have and out of which it's derived 

328
00:17:37,251 --> 00:17:37,880
from the same.

329
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:43,570
What would you say?
Cultural substrate as the stories in 

330
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:43,570
genesis,
for example,

331
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:47,110
although it represents a variant,
the Mesopotamians had older gods 

332
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:51,090
aggregate themselves together because 
they were threatened by the unknown.

333
00:17:51,091 --> 00:17:53,970
That's what happens in the.
In the Mesopotamian creation myth,

334
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:57,960
the unknown gives rise to the gods.
They become very fractious and compete,

335
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,390
and then the unknown decides to destroy 
them again,

336
00:18:00,391 --> 00:18:03,090
like God destroying Noah.
It was people in the flood.

337
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:05,370
It's the same basic idea.
There's an idea there.

338
00:18:05,371 --> 00:18:10,371
The idea is that we emerge out of the 
unknown and we're always threatened by 

339
00:18:10,441 --> 00:18:12,810
it,
not only as individuals but as a group,

340
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:17,811
and that means that we need to figure 
out what it is that should guide us in 

341
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:19,110
order to continually confront the 
unknown and prevail.

342
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:24,290
And so what happens in Mesopotamia,
the gods all get together in a congress 

343
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:26,730
and they basically,
they elect a new God and he's a new kind

344
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:27,180
of God.

345
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:28,830
His name is Martin,
by the way.

346
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:32,520
He has eyes all the way around his head 
and so he pays attention.

347
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,550
That's not the same as thinking.
It's a different thing.

348
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,080
Attention,
it's the same thing.

349
00:18:37,081 --> 00:18:40,140
The Egyptians representative in worship 
with the eye of horus.

350
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,040
The idea that what you should do if you 
want to survive in this world and if you

351
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:49,041
want to play a voluntary game that 
everybody could participate in your 

352
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,100
bloody eyes better be open because they 
are the things that will save you,

353
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:52,560
and that's the tension and the other 
thing that mark did,

354
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,500
he spoke magic words and so when he 
spoke,

355
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,110
the night sky would appear.
The Day sky would appearance,

356
00:18:58,111 --> 00:19:03,111
so the Mesopotamians figured out in 
their great religious story that the 

357
00:19:03,111 --> 00:19:05,850
fundamental sovereign God was he who 
pays attention and speaks the truth,

358
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,050
and that's something that's something 
that's,

359
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,660
that's not something you punish people 
for,

360
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:13,920
right?

361
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,860
Because there's this.
This is the deepest idea of mankind.

362
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,640
It's developed in detail in Genesis,
in the Old Testament.

363
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:24,450
It's the fundamental idea of genesis 
that God uses the logos,

364
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:28,710
the word of God to cast hotel,
which we all face.

365
00:19:28,711 --> 00:19:30,240
That's what we face.
Potential.

366
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,750
You know that you know that the future 
is unstructured.

367
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,690
You have a.
You have a potential within you that can

368
00:19:36,691 --> 00:19:39,690
meet that and there's a potential that 
characterizes the future.

369
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,300
You meet it with eyes open,
end with truthful speech,

370
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,480
and that's what happens in genesis 
because God uses the logos which is 

371
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,580
truthful speech to cast the pre 
cosmogony potential into habitable order

372
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,910
and then he says it's good and there 
there's a hint there,

373
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,350
right?
Because you think,

374
00:19:55,351 --> 00:19:57,240
well,
is habitable order good?

375
00:19:57,241 --> 00:20:00,600
Because life is very difficult and it's 
a real question whether or not the order

376
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:05,601
that we inhabit is good,
and the hypothesis in the Old Testament 

377
00:20:05,601 --> 00:20:07,200
is that if truthful speech gives rise to
the order,

378
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:12,290
then that order will be good and that's 
really something man like that's really 

379
00:20:12,661 --> 00:20:13,830
something to apprehend.

380
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:19,040
It's fundamental theological 
presupposition that the way that you 

381
00:20:19,111 --> 00:20:24,111
take the potential upon which the cosmos
is predicated and cast to the into the 

382
00:20:24,111 --> 00:20:28,050
order that allows everyone to thrive is 
by using truthful speech.

383
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:33,770
Wouldn't be something if that was the 
case and the thing is you know it's the 

384
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:36,981
case.
You know you know it because you do not 

385
00:20:36,981 --> 00:20:37,350
admire yourself.
If you're deceitful,

386
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,200
you admire yourself.
When you have those rare moments in your

387
00:20:40,201 --> 00:20:44,670
life where you can actually stand up and
say what's true regardless of the cost,

388
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,880
and if you,
if you give that respect to other 

389
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,191
people,
if you treat them as if they're the 

390
00:20:53,191 --> 00:20:54,991
locale of the divine speech,
the casts potential into habitable 

391
00:20:54,991 --> 00:20:55,600
order,
then they like you,

392
00:20:55,810 --> 00:21:00,810
maybe they even love you and they get 
along with you when you could work with 

393
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:01,060
them and you can cooperate with them and
you can compete with them.

394
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:06,300
So not only is it the,
the fundamental axiom that regulates 

395
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,231
your relationship with yourself,
it's the fundamental axiom that 

396
00:21:10,231 --> 00:21:13,321
regulates your interactions with other 
people and if you do not give them that 

397
00:21:13,321 --> 00:21:17,670
that honor,
which is the presupposition for their 

398
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:17,740
natural.
Right?

399
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:22,770
Right.
Because the idea that you haven't 

400
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:22,770
natural,
right,

401
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:22,770
is the idea that you have some sort of 
intrinsic value.

402
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,170
If you don't treat people as if they 
have that intrinsic right,

403
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:29,260
they are not happy with you.
Even if they don't know why,

404
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:34,650
because everyone wants to be treated as 
if they have freewill and is if they 

405
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:37,870
confront potential and as if they're 
capable of making moral choices and that

406
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:42,930
they should be rewarded when they do 
things right and perhaps punished when 

407
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:46,111
they do things wrong.
Everyone wants that and everyone knows 

408
00:21:46,111 --> 00:21:49,021
it and so well.
So what does that all have to do with 

409
00:21:49,021 --> 00:21:49,021
free speech?

410
00:21:49,021 --> 00:21:50,480
Well,
yes.

411
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,030
Everything.
That's exactly right.

412
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:56,770
So free speech isn't free speech.
You know,

413
00:21:56,771 --> 00:22:00,150
people think of free speech is Kinda 
like a decoration,

414
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,100
something like that in your life and 
it's not that at all.

415
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,790
It's not the ability to speak truth to 
power,

416
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,250
although it is also that.
It's not that.

417
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:13,420
It's way more than that.
Free speech is how you think.

418
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:19,130
It's not thinking.
You know the word genesis relies on to 

419
00:22:19,391 --> 00:22:21,250
create cosmos,
let's say in the story.

420
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:26,430
By the way,
that's the image of God in which you're 

421
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:26,830
made male and female.
That gives you that fundamental value.

422
00:22:26,831 --> 00:22:28,990
That's at the core of our idea of 
natural,

423
00:22:28,991 --> 00:22:33,991
right?
It's not thinking it's speaking and the 

424
00:22:33,991 --> 00:22:34,630
reason for that is,
first of all,

425
00:22:34,631 --> 00:22:37,240
you can hardly think.
It's really hard to think.

426
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:39,040
You have to be trained,
like mad to think.

427
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:44,250
You have to be able to divide yourself 
internally into a couple of different 

428
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,551
people and then you have to let those 
people have a war in your head and that 

429
00:22:47,551 --> 00:22:50,620
means you have to develop characters,
have opinions in great detail,

430
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:55,621
opinions that might be contrary to your 
own and then you have to withstand the 

431
00:22:55,621 --> 00:22:58,981
tension of letting them have it out and 
you only see that thinking in great 

432
00:22:58,981 --> 00:22:58,981
literature.

433
00:22:58,981 --> 00:23:03,780
Like you see that in Dostoevsky.
He's an absolute master of that and you 

434
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:03,970
know,
you can think a little bit,

435
00:23:03,971 --> 00:23:07,840
but mostly you're biased and you have 
confirmation bias and you see things the

436
00:23:07,841 --> 00:23:12,841
way you see them and you have massive 
blind spots in your ignorance as hell 

437
00:23:12,841 --> 00:23:12,841
and you just.
You just,

438
00:23:12,841 --> 00:23:14,110
you just can't think.
But you can talk.

439
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,410
And the thing is if you talk,
other people will correct you.

440
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,140
That's the thing.
And that's thinking.

441
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:25,350
So if you get up and you have something 
to say and you say it stupidly because 

442
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:29,251
of course you will,
because what you know then other people 

443
00:23:29,251 --> 00:23:29,710
will tell you where you're wrong and 
then you can learn,

444
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,240
right?
And then everybody can think.

445
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,240
And so what that also means is that to 
be free,

446
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,180
to speak,
even to tell the truth means you have to

447
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:42,181
be free to be stupid and ignorant and 
malevolent and bitter because that is 

448
00:23:42,181 --> 00:23:46,951
who you are.
That is what you are because you're a 

449
00:23:46,951 --> 00:23:46,951
fraud.

450
00:23:46,951 --> 00:23:48,370
So the idea that

451
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:53,490
you know,
you can't use your free speech if it's 

452
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:53,490
offensive,
it's just,

453
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,380
it's an idea that is so you don't know 
if it's naive.

454
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:57,070
It does.
It's malevolence.

455
00:23:57,071 --> 00:24:02,071
It's a real battle.
Which of the which of those two things 

456
00:24:02,071 --> 00:24:04,591
are worse?
I would go with malevolence because it 

457
00:24:04,591 --> 00:24:07,021
detracts suck at it tax.
Something that's so absolutely 

458
00:24:07,021 --> 00:24:07,021
fundamental.
It's like,

459
00:24:07,021 --> 00:24:09,460
well of course people who are speaking 
freely are going to be offensive.

460
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,920
I mean,
have you ever had a serious discussion 

461
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:14,920
with anyone in your life?
And I'm in a serious discussion.

462
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,470
I mean this sort of discussion you have 
when you're with your wife,

463
00:24:17,471 --> 00:24:22,471
when you're wondering whether your 
marriage is going to survive or you or 

464
00:24:22,471 --> 00:24:25,591
with your kids when they've done 
something that is really not in their 

465
00:24:25,591 --> 00:24:26,170
best longterm interest,
I mean a serious discussion.

466
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,050
You can't even get off the ground 
without being offensive.

467
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:34,350
You can't get off the ground with 
defending yourself in a conversation 

468
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:37,681
like that.
You don't even want to admit how you 

469
00:24:37,681 --> 00:24:39,781
feel or how you think to yourself.
If you think you can have a difficult 

470
00:24:39,781 --> 00:24:43,651
conversation without offending people,
all that means is you're not having a 

471
00:24:43,651 --> 00:24:45,520
difficult conversation because for an 
easy conversation,

472
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:48,370
by definition,
no one gets upset about that.

473
00:24:48,371 --> 00:24:50,550
There's no real problem.
There's no real disagreement.

474
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,250
There's and there's no real,
real world problem to be solved.

475
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:59,550
It's just trivial.
It's like discussing last night sports 

476
00:24:59,550 --> 00:24:59,680
event.
There's nothing to it.

477
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,160
If you're going to have a conversation 
about something that matters in the 

478
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,370
world is made out of what matters.
That's a good thing to remember.

479
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,010
If you're going to have a discussion 
about what matters.

480
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:14,310
If you're really going to talk about 
everyone is going to be offended by 

481
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:17,891
that,
especially if there's something rotten 

482
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:18,680
in the state of Denmark and you happen 
to be the one that is pointing it out,

483
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,970
so then you think,
well,

484
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,320
your freedom of speech.

485
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,900
That's not about you being able to speak
truth to power.

486
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,080
That's about you being able to chart 
your destiny in the world and more than 

487
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,491
that,
it's even more important enough because 

488
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:33,491
you know life is hard.
If you don't get to think.

489
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,540
When you.
When you walk through your life,

490
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,720
you will fall into a pit.
There's no doubt about that because 

491
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,451
that's what thinking is for,
is to stop you from having any more 

492
00:25:43,451 --> 00:25:46,871
catastrophes that are absolutely 
necessary and it's a terribly difficult 

493
00:25:46,871 --> 00:25:46,940
process.
And so if,

494
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:52,150
if that's interfered with,
it isn't that you don't get to speak 

495
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:55,091
truth to power.
It's that you do not get to act in the 

496
00:25:55,091 --> 00:25:58,010
world in a manner that allows you to to 
eliminate endless,

497
00:25:58,011 --> 00:26:03,011
unnecessary,
hellish suffering and not just for you 

498
00:26:03,011 --> 00:26:03,710
but for you and your family and your 
community.

499
00:26:03,711 --> 00:26:05,690
And so the enemies of free speech.

500
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:09,920
They're the enemies of the process that 
turns potential into habitable order.

501
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:13,520
There are enemies of the divine 
principle and worse,

502
00:26:13,521 --> 00:26:15,760
they're their own enemies,
right?

503
00:26:15,761 --> 00:26:17,610
Because this isn't.
Well,

504
00:26:17,611 --> 00:26:19,920
some of us believe in free speech,
and some of us don't.

505
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,920
It's way deeper than that.
If you don't believe in free speech,

506
00:26:22,921 --> 00:26:25,530
you don't believe in the implicit 
divinity of mankind.

507
00:26:25,531 --> 00:26:27,690
You don't believe in the sovereignty of 
the individual.

508
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,300
You don't believe in sovereignty as 
such.

509
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:33,720
You're a totalitarian of some sort,
which means you attribute all the divine

510
00:26:33,721 --> 00:26:36,780
power to yourself and then we know where
that leads,

511
00:26:36,781 --> 00:26:41,781
right?
It doesn't matter whether it's on the 

512
00:26:41,781 --> 00:26:43,071
right or the left.
If we had any sense that we took a look 

513
00:26:43,071 --> 00:26:45,861
at 20th century history,
we know exactly things go and we could 

514
00:26:45,861 --> 00:26:50,061
easily choose not to go there.
And so when we see someone like Ryan 

515
00:26:50,061 --> 00:26:53,420
who's in prison by a reprehensible 
dictatorships that we have the gall to 

516
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:57,531
call our lis than what we see is a 
system that's not only hell bent on the 

517
00:26:59,011 --> 00:27:02,360
destruction of an innocent and good man,
but,

518
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:07,500
but directly antithetical to everything 
that all of us have.

519
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:12,830
Our society's put forward as necessary 
to the continual betterment of being 

520
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,020
itself.

521
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:23,430
No.

522
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,940
Am I being so absolutely appalled by the
Western world.

523
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:32,970
We need response to the attacks of 
totalitarians upon our freedom of speech

524
00:27:32,971 --> 00:27:35,400
though the what was done with Solomon 
Rushdie,

525
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:36,900
that was a big,
big,

526
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,280
big,
big mistake,

527
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,800
right?
Because it wasn't rushed.

528
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,840
It was the free speaking artistic 
tradition of the West and not only of 

529
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,290
the West,
right?

530
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,040
The free speaking,
artistic,

531
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:51,540
creative tradition upon which the cosmos
is properly established.

532
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,720
That's what it was and we all bow down.
We all bowed down with no resistance 

533
00:27:57,011 --> 00:27:59,130
whatsoever.
It was a massive error.

534
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,990
We're going to pay for that for a very 
long time.

535
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,510
We did the same thing with the Danish 
cartoons

536
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:12,170
and you don't want to think about these 
sorts of things is happening far away.

537
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,520
Nothing happens far away when it 
happened somewhere else.

538
00:28:15,521 --> 00:28:20,521
It's happening right here too,
and that's why we're all here today 

539
00:28:20,521 --> 00:28:21,970
because we recognize that at least on 
some level and we have to stop.

540
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,600
We need to stop being so naive about 
our,

541
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:30,660
let's say our moral relativism.
We need to take a look at history and 

542
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:33,841
biology in a very,
very fundamental way and we need to 

543
00:28:33,841 --> 00:28:36,631
really understand what our culture,
what our culture and cultures everywhere

544
00:28:37,131 --> 00:28:42,131
are predicated on,
and that is the idea that the sovereign 

545
00:28:42,131 --> 00:28:45,211
voice of the individual is the power 
that casts potential into habitable and 

546
00:28:45,401 --> 00:28:47,020
restructures,
tyrannical order,

547
00:28:47,021 --> 00:28:49,030
when it needs to be restructured.
Right,

548
00:28:49,031 --> 00:28:54,031
and that's what each of us are.
That's the divine presence in each of 

549
00:28:54,031 --> 00:28:56,881
us,
and I do believe that there is no more 

550
00:28:56,881 --> 00:28:56,881
fundamental truths than that.

551
00:28:56,881 --> 00:28:58,900
I don't believe that you can dig down 
underneath that.

552
00:28:58,901 --> 00:29:03,901
I think that's bedrock.
That's the foundation stone of the 

553
00:29:03,901 --> 00:29:04,420
house,
that's the cornerstone of the house,

554
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,170
and it requires everyone to courageously
confront the tyranny,

555
00:29:08,171 --> 00:29:11,920
that's them and the unknown that 
surrounds them and to work for their own

556
00:29:11,921 --> 00:29:16,921
benefit and for the benefit of their 
families and for the benefit of their 

557
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,771
communities and to do everything they 
can to benefit the world and to live 

558
00:29:19,771 --> 00:29:23,870
with true speech as the highest value.
That's how we sorted out the world and 

559
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:28,341
we can sort it out.
We are sorting it out at a very rapid 

560
00:29:28,341 --> 00:29:28,740
rate and we could do that much,
much more effectively.

561
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:33,510
I do believe that it's incumbent on us 
to understand the absolutely fundamental

562
00:29:33,511 --> 00:29:38,511
role that these processes take.
I know we're here today because we all 

563
00:29:38,511 --> 00:29:38,580
have at least an intimation of that.

564
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:43,580
Great.
We know that there's something about 

565
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,261
free speech that's central,
that we cannot allow a tax on it to go 

566
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:46,660
unchallenged,
no matter where they occur,

567
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:52,110
but it's very useful to have an 
articulated and to know that this is 

568
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:55,500
bedrock,
right and it's not something arbitrary 

569
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,200
and it's not a mere game that we're only
playing in the west.

570
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,730
None of that.
It's something.

571
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:02,790
It's the most fundamental truth that the
human race has ever discovered and we 

572
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:06,000
lose it at our absolute peril and it's 
not that it's worse than that,

573
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:11,010
the peril because there are worse things
than death and the worst things than 

574
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:14,851
death is hell.
And we saw plenty of that in the 20th 

575
00:30:14,851 --> 00:30:15,550
century and when we left freedom of 
speech go,

576
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,640
that's where we're headed and unless we 
want to go there,

577
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,760
then we should stop aiming for.

578
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:29,830
Thank you,

579
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:38,780
so thank you very much for the 
invitation.

580
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:39,930
Can I?

581
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:45,630
Thank you.
