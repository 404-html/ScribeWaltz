1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,650
Okay,

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:10,943
all right,
so I suggested to you last class that 

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,160
human beings world as a place of action 
through the lens of their social,

4
00:00:18,531 --> 00:00:22,520
cognitive,
biological,

5
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,800
substructure,
and I made that argument on the basis of

6
00:00:27,801 --> 00:00:28,634
the supposition that our primary 
environment was actually other people 

7
00:00:35,211 --> 00:00:36,044
and I mentioned to you,
I believe that those other people are 

8
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:44,291
arranged in hierarchies of influence and
authority or power or dominance,

9
00:00:46,071 --> 00:00:46,904
which is often how it's construed and 
that the dominance hierarchy as a 

10
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:53,210
structure is at least 300 million years 
old,

11
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,793
which makes it older than trees and it's
for that reason that you share the same 

12
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,273
neurobiology to govern your observations
of your position in the hierarchy as 

13
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:10,730
lobsters do,
which is a remarkable fact.

14
00:01:10,731 --> 00:01:11,564
You know,
it's remarkable that the lobster uses 

15
00:01:13,701 --> 00:01:14,534
Serotonin,
has the mechanism to adjudicate it 

16
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:18,174
status position,
and that modifying the Serotonin 

17
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:25,490
function in the lobster can produce 
changes in its behavior,

18
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,533
can,
can overhead the lobster overcome 

19
00:01:28,161 --> 00:01:29,330
defeat,
for example.

20
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,553
Which is very much equivalent to what 
happens to a human being when they take 

21
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,740
antidepressants.
You know,

22
00:01:36,741 --> 00:01:37,574
it's,
it's,

23
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:42,630
it's a good example of the conservation 
of biological structure by evolution and

24
00:01:42,921 --> 00:01:45,680
another,
a good illustration of the continuity of

25
00:01:45,681 --> 00:01:47,870
life on earth.
It's really amazing.

26
00:01:47,871 --> 00:01:50,420
But the other thing,
it is a testament to his,

27
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:53,780
the ancient nature of the social 
structure.

28
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:54,614
Now we tend to think of the social 
structure as something other than 

29
00:01:57,141 --> 00:01:58,670
nature,
right?

30
00:01:58,671 --> 00:02:03,010
Because society is,
I suppose mythologically opposed opposed

31
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,110
in a narrative way culture as opposed to
nature.

32
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,153
It's the town in the forest,
but the town has been around a long 

33
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:12,920
time,
so to speak.

34
00:02:12,921 --> 00:02:13,754
And the structure of the town is also 
part of nature in the dominance 

35
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:21,170
hierarchy is part of nature.
And because it's so ancient,

36
00:02:21,171 --> 00:02:22,004
you have to consider it as part of the 
mechanism that has played the role of 

37
00:02:26,631 --> 00:02:29,930
selection in the process of natural 
selection.

38
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,160
And so,
um,

39
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,653
roughly see what seems to happen is that
there is a plethora of dominance 

40
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,313
hierarchies,
especially in complex human communities 

41
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,153
and many of them are masculine and 
structure in that their dominance 

42
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:51,590
hierarchies that primarily men compete 
in or that has been the historical norm.

43
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:52,963
And that some men rise to the top based 
on whatever the dominance hierarchy is 

44
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:58,124
based on and they make their 
preferential mates and it's a good 

45
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:08,071
strategy for women to engage in because 
why and and many sorts of female animals

46
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:13,960
do precisely this is they let the males 
battle it out and then pick from the top

47
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:14,883
and or often the dominant males.
There's no choice on the part of the 

48
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:21,274
females.
It's the dominant males just chasing 

49
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:23,704
away the subordinate males.
But with humans it's usually the case 

50
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:31,000
that the females have the opportunity to
do at least some choosing.

51
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,780
And so we have,
if you think about that,

52
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:35,614
what that implies is that we have 
evolved to climb up dominance 

53
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:40,714
hierarchies and then I would say it's 
not exactly that even because there are 

54
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:45,634
many different dominance hierarchies.
And so the skills that you might use to 

55
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:50,284
climb up one might not be necessarily 
the same skills that you would use to 

56
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:54,034
climb up another.
And so then I would say what we evolve 

57
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,400
evolve for instead.
Um,

58
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,890
and I'm still speaking mostly on the 
masculine edge of things.

59
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,293
Historically speaking is the ability to 
climb up the set of all possible 

60
00:04:10,121 --> 00:04:12,160
dominance hierarchies,
right?

61
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,080
And that's,
that's a whole different idea.

62
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:14,914
It's like the average hierarchy across 
vast spans of time and I think it's for 

63
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:20,314
that reason that we,
among others that we evolve general 

64
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:24,394
intelligence because general 
intelligence is a general problem 

65
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:31,930
solving mechanism and it seems to be 
situation independent,

66
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:32,800
so to speak.

67
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,663
And of course there's been an arms race 
for the development of intelligence 

68
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:41,840
between men and women because each 
gender has to keep up with the other and

69
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,020
women have their own dominance 
hierarchies.

70
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,153
There's certainly no doubt about that.
And of course now men and women more 

71
00:04:49,661 --> 00:04:50,494
increasingly compete within the same 
hierarchies and we don't exactly know 

72
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:56,860
how to sort that out yet because it's an
extraordinarily new phenomena.

73
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,830
But in any case,
because of the,

74
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,113
uh,
the permanence of the dominance 

75
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:04,084
hierarchy,
it has come to be represented in 

76
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:11,140
fundamental narratives because human 
beings,

77
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:13,090
and this is something that we share 
everywhere.

78
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,940
It's the thing the Wall Street bankers 
shares with,

79
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,200
uh,
with the,

80
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:18,034
uh,
Kelly Harry Kung bushmen who are among 

81
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:23,734
the genetically speaking,
they seem to be very close to what the 

82
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:29,194
original,
most original human beings were like in 

83
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:35,650
Africa before the Diaspora for about 
50,000 years ago.

84
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,903
But,
you know,

85
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,773
both of those people,
despite their vast differences live in 

86
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:44,020
communities that have a hierarchical 
structure

87
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,030
that are composed of individuals that 
are embedded in a natural world,

88
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:50,143
you know,
the world outside of the dominant 

89
00:05:51,421 --> 00:05:52,254
Turkey.
And so that's the standard human 

90
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:54,904
environment I would say.
And so stories that rely on the 

91
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:58,274
representations of those environments 
and their interactions are what you 

92
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:07,721
might describe as universal stories and 
that's why people can understand them.

93
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:09,044
And I would say further,
and this is drawing substantially on 

94
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,583
say,
derivations of the work of Carl young 

95
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:17,390
because I think he delved into this more
deeply than anyone else.

96
00:06:17,391 --> 00:06:19,550
So a lot of this stuff is quite union in
its,

97
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,060
in its origins.
Um,

98
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,630
we,
we,

99
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,720
the commonality between human beings.
So you know,

100
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:30,554
you,
you have to have commonalities in order 

101
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:32,660
to communicate,
right?

102
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,310
Axiomatic commonalities because 
otherwise you have to explain everything

103
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:38,803
and so there's many things that human 
beings don't have to explain to one 

104
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:42,020
another.

105
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:46,370
We don't have to explain anger when we 
don't have to explain jealousy.

106
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:49,520
We don't have to explain fear,
we don't have to explain pain,

107
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,510
we don't have to explain joy.
We don't have to explain love,

108
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,533
et Cetera.
Those are built into us and so their 

109
00:06:56,211 --> 00:06:57,044
predicates of being human and you could 
say that those human predicates and the 

110
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:02,864
standard human environment produce 
standard narratives and then you could 

111
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:09,050
say even further,
and this is more of a leap,

112
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:09,884
I would say,
is that those who act out the role of 

113
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:15,134
the victor in those standard narratives 
are precisely the people who attain 

114
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:20,114
victory in life on and I would say 
biologically defined in that they make 

115
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:26,024
more attractive partners,
but also I believe that there's an 

116
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:29,504
alignment between human wellbeing,
which is a very weak word and 

117
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:39,550
participation in these metanarratives 
that drive success because,

118
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,423
well,
do you want to be a failure or a 

119
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:42,170
success?

120
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:42,950
Well,
you know,

121
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,783
it's hard to be a success.
You have to adopt a lot of 

122
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:46,184
responsibility and so you might be 
willing to take your chances as a 

123
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:51,170
failure,
but I can't exactly.

124
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,333
I'm not going to make the presumption 
that that's going to put you in this 

125
00:07:55,051 --> 00:08:00,051
situation other than one where you 
experienced a lot of frustration,

126
00:08:00,171 --> 00:08:01,550
anger,
disappointment,

127
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:02,384
depression,
pain and anxiety at the bottom of the 

128
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:06,134
heap,
and so generally that's not what people 

129
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:12,530
are aiming for.
Although under certain circumstances,

130
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:17,180
if people don't like responsibility and 
are willing to take their chances,

131
00:08:17,181 --> 00:08:18,014
they might take the irresponsibility and
it's apparent freedoms over the 

132
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:27,980
necessity of thinking things through the
medium and long run.

133
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,370
Anyways,
we stop here.

134
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:32,204
I suggested to you that one of the 
primary narrative representations was 

135
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:37,454
the known or culture or order.
I think there was a or the explored 

136
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:43,640
territory or the dominance hierarchy.

137
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,640
I think those things are basically 
interchangeable from a,

138
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:47,803
from a representational perspective,
and you know in the movie The lion king 

139
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,533
that's represented by pride rock,
which is the central place of 

140
00:08:56,701 --> 00:08:57,534
orientation founded on Rock,
which is the sort of thing that people 

141
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:01,854
embed their memories in.
That's why we make sculptures and 

142
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:05,424
gravestones and that sort of things.
Roc stands for permanent than to have 

143
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,773
rock under your feet is to be on a solid
foundation and that's a pyramid in some 

144
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:14,814
sense in that movie.
And the pyramid has topped by the king 

145
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:20,520
and Queen and their offspring.
So,

146
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,150
um,
that's,

147
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,290
that's the divine couple.
That's one way of thinking about it.

148
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:29,400
And Simba of course is the newborn hero 
and you know,

149
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,323
you,
you understand that even though it's 

150
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:36,420
lions and drawings of lions at that and 
animals are acting it out,

151
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,493
it's completely irrelevant to you that 
those characters happen to be animated 

152
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:43,620
and that what you're watching is a 
fiction.

153
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,903
So,
and I would say to you with regards to 

154
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:48,390
fiction,
you know,

155
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,960
you might say,
well is fiction true or not?

156
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:52,794
And the answer to that is yes and no.
It's not true in that the events 

157
00:09:58,861 --> 00:10:02,460
portrayed in fiction occurred in the 
world.

158
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,960
They didn't,
but they're fiction is true the same way

159
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:09,270
numbers are true.
I would say like,

160
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,000
you know,
if you have one apple and one orange and

161
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:12,834
one banana,
the common malady between all of those 

162
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,860
three is one and you might say,
well,

163
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:24,861
is one as real as one fruit is the 
abstraction one as real as one fruit and

164
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:29,640
I would say it depends on what you mean 
by real,

165
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,713
but representing things mathematically 
and abstractly gives you incredible 

166
00:10:34,471 --> 00:10:35,304
power and you could make the case that 
the abstraction is actually more real 

167
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:40,464
than the phenomena that it represents.
And certainly mathematicians would make 

168
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:45,060
that case.

169
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:50,010
They would say that mathematics is in 
some sense more real than the phenomenal

170
00:10:50,011 --> 00:10:51,300
world.
And you know,

171
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:55,500
you don't have to believe that mostly 
it's a matter of choice in some sense,

172
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:56,334
but you can't deny the fact that an 
abstraction has enough reality so that 

173
00:11:00,331 --> 00:11:03,120
if you're proficient in using it,
you can really,

174
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,700
you can change the world and,
and,

175
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:09,360
and in and in insanely powerful ways.
You know.

176
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:10,194
I mean,
all the computational equipment you 

177
00:11:11,121 --> 00:11:15,990
people are using are dependent on the 
abstractions one in zero essentially.

178
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:18,720
And I mean look at what emerges from 
that.

179
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,300
And so I would say with regards to 
fiction,

180
00:11:21,301 --> 00:11:24,900
if you take someone like Dostoevsky or 
we think it's a favorite of mine,

181
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:25,734
by the way,
I would highly recommend that you read 

182
00:11:26,971 --> 00:11:27,804
all five of his great novels because 
they are unparalleled in their 

183
00:11:30,901 --> 00:11:33,170
psychological depth.
Um,

184
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:35,190
and so if you're interested in 
psychology,

185
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:40,200
Dostoyevsky's the person for you,
tolstoy is more of a sociologist,

186
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:41,034
but Dostoyevsky man,
he gets right down into the bottom of 

187
00:11:43,831 --> 00:11:46,770
the questions and messes around,
uh,

188
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,050
a transformative reading.

189
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,500
Anyways,
Dostoyevsky's characters,

190
00:11:52,501 --> 00:11:53,334
this character named her skull and the 
cove is a character in crime and 

191
00:11:56,021 --> 00:11:56,854
punishment and risk.
And the coffee's a materialist 

192
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,160
rationalist,
I would say,

193
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:04,350
which was around rather new type of 
person back in the 18 eighties.

194
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,360
And he was sort of taken by the idea 
that God was dead and took and convinced

195
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:13,144
himself that the only reason that he,
that anyone acted in a moral way in a 

196
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:19,150
traditional way was because of 
cowardice.

197
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:19,984
They were unable to remove from them the
restrictions of mere convention and act 

198
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:30,640
in the manner of someone who rose above 
the norm.

199
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,900
And so he's tortured by these ideas.
He's half starving.

200
00:12:34,901 --> 00:12:35,734
He said,
law student who doesn't have enough to 

201
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:37,990
eat,
he doesn't have much money,

202
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:38,824
and so you know,
he's not thinking all that clearly 

203
00:12:40,331 --> 00:12:42,610
either and it's got a lot of family 
problems.

204
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:43,444
His mother's sick and she can't spend,
send too much money and his sister is 

205
00:12:46,691 --> 00:12:47,524
planning to engage in a marriage that's 
loveless to someone who's rather 

206
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:52,890
tyrannical,
who he,

207
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,743
she hopes will provide the family with 
enough money so that he can continue in 

208
00:12:56,831 --> 00:13:01,831
law school and they write him brave 
letters telling him that she's very much

209
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:02,674
in love with this guy,
but he is smart enough to read between 

210
00:13:05,111 --> 00:13:05,944
the lines and realize this,
that his sister is just planning to 

211
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:10,340
prostitute herself in,
you know,

212
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,710
in an altruistic manner.

213
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:16,770
And he's not very happy with that.
And then at the same time as all this is

214
00:13:16,771 --> 00:13:20,590
happening,
he becomes aware of this pawn broker who

215
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,010
he's,
you know,

216
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:27,180
pawning his last possessions too.
And she's a horrible person and not only

217
00:13:28,841 --> 00:13:29,674
by his estimation,
she pawns a lot of things for the 

218
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,330
neighborhood.
And people really don't like her.

219
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:39,090
She's grasping and cruel and deceitful 
and and resentful and like,

220
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,490
and she has this nice who's not very 
bright,

221
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,360
intellectually impaired,
whom she basically treats as a slave and

222
00:13:46,361 --> 00:13:48,590
beats all the time.
And so risk called Nicole,

223
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:49,993
you know,
involved in this mess and half starved 

224
00:13:53,411 --> 00:13:58,411
and a bit delirious and possessed of 
these strange new nihilistic ideas.

225
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,213
Decides that the best way out of this 
situation would be just to kill the 

226
00:14:03,851 --> 00:14:04,631
landlord.
The,

227
00:14:04,631 --> 00:14:07,750
a pawnbroker take her wealth,
which she,

228
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:11,050
all she does is keep it in a chest,
a free,

229
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:11,740
the nice.

230
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,573
So that seems like a good idea.
So remove one apparently horrible and 

231
00:14:17,201 --> 00:14:18,034
useless person from the world,
free his sister from the necessity of 

232
00:14:21,221 --> 00:14:22,054
this loveless marriage and allow him to 
go to law school where he can become 

233
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,960
educated and do some good for the world.
You know,

234
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:32,290
so one of the things that's lovely about
Dostoevsky is that he,

235
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:33,124
you know,
when sometimes when one person is 

236
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:38,260
arguing against another or when they're 
having an argument in their head,

237
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,830
they make their opponent into a straw 
mat,

238
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,693
which is basically they take their 
opponent and caricatures of their 

239
00:14:44,771 --> 00:14:45,604
perspective.
And try to make it as weak as possible 

240
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:49,690
and,
and laugh about it,

241
00:14:49,691 --> 00:14:50,524
and,
and then they come up with their 

242
00:14:51,981 --> 00:14:56,540
argument and destroy this Straw man and 
feel that they've obtained victory.

243
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:59,690
But it's a very pathetic way of 
thinking.

244
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:00,524
It's not thinking at all what thinking 
is when you adopt the opposite position 

245
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:06,734
from your suppositions and you make that
argument as strong as you can possibly 

246
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:11,624
make it.

247
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:15,530
And then you hit your perspective 
against that,

248
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,410
that strong iron man,
not the straw man.

249
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,870
And you argue it out,
you battle it out.

250
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:25,940
And that's what Dostoevsky does in his 
novels.

251
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:26,774
I mean,
he's the people who stand for the 

252
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:29,954
antithesis of what Dostoevsky Dostoevsky
actually believes are often the 

253
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,750
strongest,
smartest,

254
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:38,750
and sometimes most admirable people in 
the book.

255
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,530
And so he takes great moral courage to 
do that.

256
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:44,120
And uh,
you know,

257
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:44,954
in rascal of what he wanted to do was 
set up a character who had every reason 

258
00:15:48,651 --> 00:15:52,190
to commit murder,
every reasonable reason,

259
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,110
philosophically,
practically,

260
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,250
ethically,
even.

261
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,503
Well.
So ruskell Nicole goes and he kills the 

262
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,543
old lady with an ax and it doesn't go 
the way he expects it will because what 

263
00:16:05,601 --> 00:16:10,601
he finds out is that post murder risk,
golden cove and pre murder riscal Nicole

264
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,880
have are not the same people at all.

265
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,640
They're not even close to the same 
people.

266
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:17,474
He's entered an entirely different 
universe and Dostoevsky does a lovely 

267
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:21,794
job of describing that universe of 
horror and chaos and and and deception 

268
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:31,730
and and and suffering and terror and all
of that,

269
00:16:31,731 --> 00:16:35,930
and he doesn't even use the money.
He just buries it in an alley as fast as

270
00:16:35,931 --> 00:16:38,820
he can and then it doesn't want anything
to do with it again.

271
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,543
Anyways.
The reason I'm telling you all this is 

272
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:46,160
potentially to entice you into reading 
the book because it is an amazing,

273
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,640
amazing book,
but also because you might say,

274
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:52,210
well,
is risky is what happened to risk in the

275
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,120
cove?
True.

276
00:16:53,121 --> 00:16:55,970
Are the stories in that book?
True?

277
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:57,440
And the answer to that is,
well,

278
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,860
from a factual perspective,
clearly they're untrue.

279
00:17:00,861 --> 00:17:01,694
But then if you think of [inaudible] as 
the embodiment of a particular type of 

280
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:10,490
person who lived at that time and the 
embodiment of a certain kind of ideology

281
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,670
which had swept across Europe and really
invaded Russia in,

282
00:17:13,671 --> 00:17:18,350
which was actually a precursor,
a philosophical precursor to the Russian

283
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:22,640
revolution,
then Ruskell Niqab is more real than any

284
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,340
one person.
He's like a composite person.

285
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:26,443
He's like a person who's irrelevancies 
have been eliminated for the purpose of 

286
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,600
relating something about the structure 
of the world.

287
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:40,120
And so I like to think of those things 
as sort of met a real matter real.

288
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,243
They're more real than real.
And of course that's what you expect 

289
00:17:43,911 --> 00:17:47,630
people to do when they tell you about 
their own lives,

290
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,890
about their own day.

291
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,140
You don't want a factual description of 
every muscle twitch.

292
00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:00,890
You want them to distill their 
experiences down into the gist,

293
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:03,923
which is the significance of the 
experience and the significance of the 

294
00:18:06,811 --> 00:18:07,644
experience is roughly what you can 
derive from listening to the experience 

295
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:17,220
that will change the way that you look 
at the world and act in the world.

296
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:18,563
So it's valuable information and they 
can tell you a terrible story and then 

297
00:18:21,651 --> 00:18:25,020
that can be valuable because that can 
tell you how not to look in the world,

298
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,010
look at the world and act in it or are 
they can tell you a positive story.

299
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:29,844
You can derive benefit either way,
which is why we also like to go watch 

300
00:18:33,601 --> 00:18:36,480
stories about horrible psychopathic 
thugs.

301
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,280
Um,
you know,

302
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:39,114
and,
and hopefully we're learning not to be 

303
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:43,350
like them,
although there are additional advantages

304
00:18:43,351 --> 00:18:45,540
in that,
you know,

305
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,720
someone who you might be some say that 
someone who is incapable of cruelty is a

306
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:54,060
higher moral being than someone who is 
capable of cruelty.

307
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,580
And I would say in this follows younger 
as well,

308
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,870
that that's incorrect and it's 
dangerously incorrect because if you are

309
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:01,704
not capable of cruelty,
you are absolutely a victim to anyone 

310
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:09,810
who is.
And so part of the reason that people go

311
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:10,644
watch anti heroes and villains is 
because there's a part of them crying 

312
00:19:14,701 --> 00:19:17,820
out for the incorporation of the monster
within them,

313
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,270
which is what gives them strength of 
character and self respect.

314
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:26,010
Because it's impossible to respect 
yourself until you grow teeth and if you

315
00:19:26,011 --> 00:19:26,844
grow teeth,
then you realize that you're somewhat 

316
00:19:28,231 --> 00:19:29,064
dangerous and or maybe somewhat 
seriously dangerous and then you might 

317
00:19:33,511 --> 00:19:34,344
be more willing to demand that you treat
yourself with respect and other people 

318
00:19:37,861 --> 00:19:38,694
do the same thing.
And so that doesn't mean that being 

319
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:41,994
cruel is better than not being cruel.
What it means is that being able to be 

320
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:46,704
cruel and then not being cruel is better
than not being able to be cruel because 

321
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:52,794
in the first case you're nothing but we 
can naive and in the second case you're 

322
00:19:56,191 --> 00:19:57,024
dangerous but you have it under control 
and you know a lot of martial arts 

323
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:04,770
concentrate on exactly that as part of 
their philosophy of training.

324
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:08,040
It's like we're not training you to 
fight.

325
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,500
We're training you to be peaceful and 
awake and avoid fights.

326
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:17,170
But if you happen to have to get in one 
and the.

327
00:20:17,171 --> 00:20:18,004
I guess the philosophy also is,
is that if you're a competent at 

328
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:22,314
fighting,
that actually decreases the probability 

329
00:20:24,961 --> 00:20:28,320
that you're going to have to fight.
Because when someone pushes you,

330
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:32,010
you will be able to respond with 
confidence and with any luck,

331
00:20:32,011 --> 00:20:33,810
and this is certainly the case with 
bullies,

332
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,600
with any luck,
a reasonable show of confidence,

333
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:39,120
which is very much equivalent to a show 
of dominance,

334
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,940
is going to be enough to make the bully 
back off,

335
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,283
and so the strength that you develop in 
your monstrousness is actually the best 

336
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:52,150
guarantee of peace and that's partly why
young believed that it was necessary for

337
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:52,984
people to integrate their shadow and he 
said that was a terrible thing for 

338
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:59,230
people to attempt because the human 
shadow

339
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:01,563
which has all those things about 
yourself that you don't want to realize 

340
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,010
reaches all the way to hell.

341
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:06,993
And what he meant by that was it's 
through an analysis of your own shadow 

342
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:15,100
that you can come to understand why 
other people are capable and you as well

343
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,160
of the sorts of terrible atrocities that
characterize,

344
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,840
let's say,
the 20th century.

345
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,063
And without that understanding,
there's no possibility of bringing it 

346
00:21:23,561 --> 00:21:26,410
under control.
When you study Nazi Germany,

347
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:27,244
for example,
or you study the Soviet Union 

348
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,220
particularly under stelling and you're 
asking yourself,

349
00:21:33,221 --> 00:21:35,650
well,
what are these perpetrators like?

350
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,470
Forget about the victims.
Let's talk about the perpetrators.

351
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:42,160
The answer is they're just like you and 
if you don't know that,

352
00:21:42,161 --> 00:21:42,994
that just means that you don't know 
anything about people including 

353
00:21:45,191 --> 00:21:46,024
yourself,
and then it also means that you have to 

354
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:51,670
discover why they're just like you and 
believe me,

355
00:21:51,671 --> 00:21:52,504
that's no picnic,
so that's enough to traumatize people 

356
00:21:55,301 --> 00:21:56,134
and that's partly why they don't do it 
and it's also partly why the path to 

357
00:21:59,471 --> 00:22:03,190
enlightenment and wisdom is seldom trod 
upon.

358
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:07,090
Because if it was all a matter of 
following your bliss and doing what made

359
00:22:07,091 --> 00:22:07,924
you happy,
then everyone in the world would be a 

360
00:22:09,551 --> 00:22:11,980
paragon of wisdom.
But it's not that at all.

361
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,113
It's the.
It's a matter of facing the thing you 

362
00:22:14,861 --> 00:22:18,130
least want to face and everyone has that
old.

363
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,083
There's this old story in King Arthur 
where the night school off to look for 

364
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:23,134
the holy grail,
which is either the cup that Christ 

365
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,213
drank out of it,
the last supper or the cup into which 

366
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,130
the blood gushed from his side was 
poured when he was crucified.

367
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,990
The stories vary,
but it's.

368
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,943
It's basically a holy object like the 
phoenix in some sense that's 

369
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:42,640
representation,
a representation of transformation,

370
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,833
so it's a.
it's an ideal and so King Arthur's 

371
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,270
knights who sit at round table because 
they're all roughly equal.

372
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,403
Go off to find the most valuable thing 
and they and where do you look for the 

373
00:22:54,371 --> 00:22:57,100
most valuable thing when you don't know 
where it is?

374
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,353
Well,
each of the nights looks at the forest 

375
00:23:00,281 --> 00:23:01,114
surrounding the castle and enters the 
forest at the point that looks darkest 

376
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,780
to him and that's a good thing to 
understand because the gateway to wisdom

377
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,790
and the gateway to the development of 
personality,

378
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:17,470
which is exactly the same thing,
is precisely through the porthole portal

379
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,513
that you do not want to climb through.
And the reason for that is actually 

380
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:24,610
quite technical.
This is a union presupposition too,

381
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:25,900
is that,
well,

382
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,913
there's a bunch of things about you that
are under developed and a lot of those 

383
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:29,974
things are because there's things you've
avoided looking at because you don't 

384
00:23:32,951 --> 00:23:36,670
want to look at them and there's parts 
of you you've avoided developing because

385
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,890
it's hard for you to develop those 
parts.

386
00:23:38,891 --> 00:23:39,724
And so it's,
it's by virtual necessity that what you 

387
00:23:42,461 --> 00:23:46,280
need is where you don't want to look 
because that's where you've kept

388
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,630
it.
And so,

389
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,710
and that's why there's an idiosyncratic 
element of it for everyone.

390
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:52,783
Your particular place of enlightenment 
and terror is not going to be the same 

391
00:23:56,241 --> 00:23:57,074
as yours,
except that they're both places of 

392
00:23:58,821 --> 00:23:59,654
enlightenment and terror.
So their equivalent at one level of 

393
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:05,390
analysis and,
and different at another.

394
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,620
So anyways,
back to fiction and,

395
00:24:07,621 --> 00:24:08,190
and,
and,

396
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,023
and what it does is it distills truth 
and it produces characters that are 

397
00:24:14,271 --> 00:24:17,550
composites and the more they become 
compass,

398
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:21,320
it's the more they approximate a 
mythological character.

399
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:22,843
And so they become more and more 
universally true and more and more 

400
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,470
approximating religious deities.
But the problem with that is they become

401
00:24:30,471 --> 00:24:33,500
more and more distant from individual 
experience.

402
00:24:33,501 --> 00:24:34,334
And so with literature,
there's this very tight line where you 

403
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:43,940
need to make the character more than 
merely human,

404
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,080
but not so much of a god that,
you know,

405
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:49,850
one of the things that happened to 
superman in the 19 eighties,

406
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,270
superman started out,
he's got a heavenly set,

407
00:24:52,271 --> 00:24:54,620
a parents bought,
by the way in an earthly set of parents.

408
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,453
And he's an orphan like Harry Potter.
Very common theme is that when Superman 

409
00:24:59,931 --> 00:25:02,270
first emerged,
he could only jump over buildings.

410
00:25:02,271 --> 00:25:04,070
You know what I mean?
Maybe you could stop a locomotive,

411
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:04,904
but by the time the 19 eighties rolled 
around like he could juggle planets and 

412
00:25:08,271 --> 00:25:11,450
you know,
swallow hydrogen bombs and you know,

413
00:25:11,451 --> 00:25:12,860
he could do anything.
Well,

414
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:17,030
people stopped buying the superman 
comics because how interesting is that?

415
00:25:17,031 --> 00:25:20,970
It's like something horrible happens and
superman deals with it and,

416
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:25,100
and something else horrible happens and 
superman deals with it and it's like,

417
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,940
that's dull.
He turned into such an archetype.

418
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:32,060
He was basically the omniscient,
omnipresent,

419
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:37,200
omnipotent God.
And that's no fun.

420
00:25:37,201 --> 00:25:40,480
That's like Godwin's.
And then God wins again and then again,

421
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,323
God wins and you know,
so then they had to weaken him in 

422
00:25:44,021 --> 00:25:45,870
different ways with Kryptonite,
you know,

423
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,310
so green Kryptonite kind of made him 
sick and red Kryptonite I think,

424
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,370
kind of mutated him,
if I remember correctly.

425
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,203
And anyways,
they had to introduce flaws into his 

426
00:25:54,741 --> 00:25:55,574
character so that there could be some 
damn plot and not something to think 

427
00:25:58,611 --> 00:25:59,444
about.
You know,

428
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,343
there's a deep existential lesson in 
that in that your being is limited and 

429
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,290
flawed and fragile.
Um,

430
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,333
you're like the genie,
which is genius in the little tiny in 

431
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,630
the little tiny a lamp,
you know,

432
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:15,523
this immense potential but constrained 
in this tiny little living space as 

433
00:26:19,581 --> 00:26:22,400
Robin Williams said when he played the 
genie in Aladdin.

434
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,593
But the fact that you have limitations 
means that the plot of your life is the 

435
00:26:27,801 --> 00:26:31,910
overcoming of those limitations.
And that if you didn't have limitations,

436
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:35,270
while there wouldn't be a plot and maybe
there would be no life.

437
00:26:35,271 --> 00:26:39,290
And so that's part of the reason why 
perhaps you have to accept the fact that

438
00:26:39,291 --> 00:26:42,770
you're flawed and insufficient and,
and live with it.

439
00:26:42,771 --> 00:26:45,510
And consider it a precondition for 
being.

440
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:50,580
It's at least a reasonable.
It's a reasonable idea.

441
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,443
So anyways,
one of the main characters is the 

442
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:55,860
country,
the known,

443
00:26:55,861 --> 00:26:56,694
the explored territory.
We went over that a bit and it always 

444
00:26:59,311 --> 00:27:00,144
has two elements.
I mean your country is your greatest 

445
00:27:03,781 --> 00:27:08,781
friend and your worst enemy because it 
squashes you into conformity and demands

446
00:27:10,381 --> 00:27:11,214
that you act in a certain manner and 
reduces your individuality to that 

447
00:27:15,451 --> 00:27:20,451
element that's tolerated by everyone 
else and it it constrains your potential

448
00:27:20,701 --> 00:27:23,910
in a single direction and so it's really
tyrannical,

449
00:27:23,911 --> 00:27:24,744
but at the same time it provides you 
with a place to be and all of the 

450
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:35,390
benefits that have accrued as a result 
of the actions of your ancestors and all

451
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,820
the other people that you're associated 
with.

452
00:27:38,821 --> 00:27:39,654
So there's the good tyrant or the bad 
tyrant and the good king and those were 

453
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:46,194
archetypal figures and that's because 
they're always true and they're always 

454
00:27:49,111 --> 00:27:50,310
true simultaneously.

455
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,623
Which is partly why I object to the 
notion of the patriarchy because it's a 

456
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,650
mythological.
It's the.

457
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,500
It's the,
what do you call that?

458
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:01,950
It's the apprehension of a mythological 
trope,

459
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,813
which is that of the evil tyrant without
any appreciation for the fact that the 

460
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:11,040
archetype actually has two parts and the
other part is the wise king and you know

461
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:13,650
you can tell an evil tyrant story about 
culture,

462
00:28:13,651 --> 00:28:14,484
no problem,
but it's one sided and that's very 

463
00:28:17,251 --> 00:28:22,251
dangerous because you don't want to 
forget all the good things that you have

464
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:26,010
while you're criticizing all the ways 
that things are in error.

465
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:29,790
That's a lack of gratitude and it's a 
lack of wisdom and it's.

466
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,033
It's founded in resentment and it's.
It's very dangerous both personally and 

467
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:36,654
socially.

468
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,773
I told you that captain hook is a tyrant
because he's got this crocodile chasing 

469
00:28:43,561 --> 00:28:45,900
them in.
The crocodile has a clock in its stomach

470
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:48,120
and that's death.
It's like obviously,

471
00:28:48,121 --> 00:28:48,751
right,
tick,

472
00:28:48,751 --> 00:28:49,411
tick,
tick,

473
00:28:49,411 --> 00:28:50,244
tick,
and it's a crocodile and it's under the 

474
00:28:52,411 --> 00:28:54,120
water and it's already got a taste of 
him.

475
00:28:54,121 --> 00:28:54,954
So he's being chased around by death and
that makes him terrified and resentful 

476
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,280
and,
and cruel and bitter.

477
00:29:02,281 --> 00:29:05,970
And so he's a tyrant and he wants to 
wreak havoc everywhere.

478
00:29:05,971 --> 00:29:09,360
And then Peter Pan of course,
looks at Captain Hook and thinks,

479
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:14,361
why the hell should I grow up and to be 
a tyrant and sacrifice all the potential

480
00:29:14,851 --> 00:29:15,684
of childhood.
And the answer to that is the potential 

481
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:19,374
sacrifices itself.
If you don't utilize it as you mature 

482
00:29:22,111 --> 00:29:24,990
and you just end up a 40 year old last 
boy,

483
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,880
which is a horrifying thing to behold,
it's almost as if you're the corpse of a

484
00:29:29,881 --> 00:29:31,950
child,
the living corpse of a child.

485
00:29:31,951 --> 00:29:34,320
Because who the hell wants a six year 
old,

486
00:29:34,321 --> 00:29:35,154
40 year old.
You're a little on the stale side by 

487
00:29:37,411 --> 00:29:40,500
that point and not the world's happiest 
individual.

488
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:41,970
So you know

489
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,340
your potential is going to disappear 
because you age anyways.

490
00:29:45,341 --> 00:29:46,174
And so you might as well shape that 
potential in a particular direction and 

491
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:54,910
at least become something no matter how 
limited rather than nothing.

492
00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:00,540
So
Peter Pan,

493
00:30:01,371 --> 00:30:03,620
that's a great story.
It's a great mythological story.

494
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,233
So

495
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:10,030
well.
So let's talk about tyrants.

496
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,240
Well,
not only are they mythological figures,

497
00:30:13,241 --> 00:30:15,670
but they exist and they tend to be 
deified.

498
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,080
Stalin was a,
for all intents and purposes,

499
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:19,923
God the father in Soviet Russia,
although he was pretty much only the 

500
00:30:23,501 --> 00:30:28,480
worst elements of Old Testament God who 
was constantly smiling people and,

501
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:29,703
and wiping out populations and doing all
sorts of things that seem to be quite 

502
00:30:32,861 --> 00:30:35,520
nasty.
But nonetheless,

503
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,690
you know,
people worshiped him in many ways.

504
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:39,010
And,
and,

505
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:39,844
uh,
he's a representation of just exactly 

506
00:30:41,531 --> 00:30:43,990
what goes wrong when things really go 
wrong,

507
00:30:43,991 --> 00:30:46,630
when people stop paying attention and 
when they all lie.

508
00:30:46,631 --> 00:30:47,464
Because one of the things that 
characterized the communist state was 

509
00:30:50,291 --> 00:30:55,240
that no one ever got to say anything 
they actually believed ever.

510
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:59,590
And that was partly because one out of 
three people was an informer,

511
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,690
which meant if you had a family of six 
people,

512
00:31:01,691 --> 00:31:04,240
two of them were informing on the 
government about you.

513
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:07,420
And that included your own children and 
you.

514
00:31:07,421 --> 00:31:08,254
And if you were an informer,
you were often amply rewarded by the 

515
00:31:10,961 --> 00:31:11,794
state.
So that if you lived in an overcrowded 

516
00:31:13,301 --> 00:31:18,301
apartment building with three families 
in the same flat and you informed on the

517
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,800
woman down the hall that you didn't 
like,

518
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,783
she got shift shipped off to the old 
concentration camp and you got her 

519
00:31:24,731 --> 00:31:25,564
apartment.
And so that was a lovely society and it 

520
00:31:28,031 --> 00:31:31,030
only killed about 30 million people 
between 19,

521
00:31:31,031 --> 00:31:31,864
19 in 1959.
So that's what happens when the 

522
00:31:35,111 --> 00:31:38,320
archetipal structure gets tilted badly 
when people

523
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:43,570
forget that they have a responsibility 
to fulfill as citizens,

524
00:31:43,571 --> 00:31:44,404
as a wake citizens who are capable of 
stating the truth and the archetype 

525
00:31:48,071 --> 00:31:48,904
shifts.
So there's nothing left of the great 

526
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:54,730
father except the tyrant.
And let's not have that happen.

527
00:31:54,731 --> 00:31:55,564
I mean,
the one on the right is really 

528
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:59,710
interesting because consciously or 
unconsciously,

529
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:03,460
you know,
there's Stellan surrounded by what is,

530
00:32:03,461 --> 00:32:06,100
for all intents and purposes,
fire.

531
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,353
You know,
he looks like he looks like maleficent 

532
00:32:09,581 --> 00:32:12,610
in sleeping beauty when she shows up at 
Aurora's Christening,

533
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:13,643
you know,
she puts her arms up in the air and 

534
00:32:14,531 --> 00:32:16,480
green fire surrounds her.
It's like,

535
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,353
like he's surrounded by fire and there's
Lenin above him who's like king of the 

536
00:32:26,391 --> 00:32:29,630
fiery realm and that's for sure.
So I mean,

537
00:32:29,631 --> 00:32:30,464
all the terrors that happened in the 
Soviet Union didn't start understanding 

538
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,670
and they started under Lenin and Lenin 
was stolen,

539
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,680
was definitely Lenin's legitimate son,
let's put it that way.

540
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:44,450
So,
you know,

541
00:32:44,451 --> 00:32:45,284
this is another example of the 
tyrannical element of the great father 

542
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:51,620
and the sorts of things that can happen.
I mean,

543
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:57,310
I kind of got an evil kick out of this 
ad was quite old,

544
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,640
you know,
it's kitschy in some sense.

545
00:33:01,641 --> 00:33:02,670
And,
and you know,

546
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:03,523
it shows,
I don't think that's something you'd 

547
00:33:04,311 --> 00:33:05,144
ever see in a magazine today.
I'm 10 unusual stamps showing evil 

548
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:11,720
dictator,
you know?

549
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,130
Um,
well,

550
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,480
fair enough.
I mean,

551
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,373
that's what he was and that's the 
consequence and that's just a tiny bit 

552
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:23,750
of the consequence because the Nazis 
wiped out a very large number of people.

553
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:27,440
I'm often using compassion as a,
as a,

554
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,150
as a,
um,

555
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,430
as a justification.
So when they went after the mentally ill

556
00:33:34,431 --> 00:33:39,431
and the terminally ill and uh,
those who,

557
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:42,740
whose intelligence was compromised for 
biological reasons and,

558
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:44,503
and those who were too old,
they basically justified it by saying 

559
00:33:47,871 --> 00:33:48,704
that the enforced euthanasia was 
merciful and that you were actually 

560
00:33:52,671 --> 00:33:56,690
being a good person by complying with 
the requirements.

561
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:01,700
And so something to think about more 
mythological representations.

562
00:34:01,701 --> 00:34:03,140
I like these quite a bit.
So there's,

563
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,330
there Hitler,
as you know,

564
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,223
night of the faith essentially with,
I suppose that's a recreation of the 

565
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,641
Christian Holy Spirit dove,
you know,

566
00:34:13,641 --> 00:34:16,640
except its an eagle which is a bird of 
prey.

567
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,533
And uh,
and uh,

568
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,190
and uh,
what do you call those things?

569
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:20,990
A scavenger,
right?

570
00:34:20,991 --> 00:34:25,060
So that's kind of interesting,
but that's Hitler as knight of the,

571
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:27,300
of the blood,
roughly speaking.

572
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,540
And there,
this is an allied,

573
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,093
a war poster essentially that 
assimilates the Nazis to poisonous 

574
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,240
snakes.
And you know,

575
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,253
we don't like poisonous snakes very much
and it's probably because they've been 

576
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:43,214
preying on us for approximately $20 
million years because snakes and 

577
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:51,200
primates,
humans in particular co evolved.

578
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,423
And so the snake is a representation of 
that which lies outside the comfortable 

579
00:34:57,801 --> 00:34:59,780
domain,
and that can be,

580
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,240
you know,
a snake obviously,

581
00:35:02,241 --> 00:35:03,074
or it can be a an abstract snake and the
abstract snake is your enemy or an even 

582
00:35:09,111 --> 00:35:12,980
more abstract snake is the evil in your 
own heart.

583
00:35:12,981 --> 00:35:15,980
And this is going to be a bit of a leap 
for you,

584
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:16,814
but there's this ancient idea that 
developed in the West over thousands of 

585
00:35:21,321 --> 00:35:26,321
years,
far predating Christianity that at least

586
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,600
it's origins,
that the snake in the garden of Eden was

587
00:35:29,601 --> 00:35:32,300
also Satan.
Which is like what the hell?

588
00:35:32,301 --> 00:35:33,134
It's a very strange idea,
but the reason for that as far as I can 

589
00:35:35,991 --> 00:35:38,190
tell is that,
you know,

590
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,450
we have this circuitry that detects 
predators and a predator.

591
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,463
A good representation of a Predator is a
snake or a monster that incorporates 

592
00:35:46,501 --> 00:35:48,990
snake like features like a dragon or 
something like that,

593
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:52,800
or a dinosaur with lots of teeth or a 
shark that lives under the water.

594
00:35:52,801 --> 00:35:54,710
And we'll pull you down.
You know,

595
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:55,643
because I suspect a lot of our ancestors
met a nasty death at the hands of Nile 

596
00:35:58,741 --> 00:35:59,574
crocodiles while they were in the 
African Veldt going down to get some 

597
00:36:02,011 --> 00:36:04,070
nice water,
so you know,

598
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:07,570
that's the thing that jumps up and pulls
you under and you know,

599
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:11,610
not happens in your own life because 
things jump up and pull you under,

600
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,890
you know,
and use the same circuitry.

601
00:36:13,891 --> 00:36:14,724
We use the same circuitry to process 
unknown things that upset us as we once 

602
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:23,850
used to detect predators who were likely
to invade our space.

603
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,343
And so and,
and human beings are capable of 

604
00:36:27,181 --> 00:36:28,350
abstraction.
And so,

605
00:36:28,351 --> 00:36:29,184
you know,
you could think about the real Predator 

606
00:36:30,241 --> 00:36:34,080
that might invade your space and maybe 
that's a snake or a wolf or,

607
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,240
or some kind of monster,
you know,

608
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,410
and that's pretty concrete.
And biological chimps have that,

609
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:42,030
you know,
chimps don't like snakes.

610
00:36:42,031 --> 00:36:45,720
And so if you,
a chimp comes across a snake in the wild

611
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,880
than like a big,
let's say,

612
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:49,880
I don't know what live with chimps.
Uh,

613
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,793
I don't know if they're pythons,
but they have constrictors there 

614
00:36:52,351 --> 00:36:54,100
anyways.
So you know,

615
00:36:54,101 --> 00:36:58,500
maybe there's like a 20 foot constrictor
and this and the chimp like stays a good

616
00:36:58,501 --> 00:37:00,720
distance away from it,
but it won't leave.

617
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,960
And then it has this particular cry that
it outers that's called a snake ram wr.

618
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:08,940
Ay Ay.
And so it makes this noise,

619
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,760
which means something like,
Holy Shit,

620
00:37:11,761 --> 00:37:12,900
that's a big snake.

621
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:13,943
And I actually mean that because the 
circuits that primates use to utter 

622
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:22,530
distress calls are the same circuits 
that we use to curse.

623
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:25,890
Just so you know,
that's why people with Tourette Syndrome

624
00:37:25,891 --> 00:37:28,740
swear because like what,
what's up with that?

625
00:37:28,741 --> 00:37:32,160
How can you have a neurological 
condition that makes you swear?

626
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:36,030
Well,
it turns out that got her role as effect

627
00:37:36,031 --> 00:37:36,864
laden curses are mediated by a different
speech circuit and that's the speech 

628
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:45,150
circuit we share with the Predator 
alarms of other primates.

629
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:47,430
So that's pretty cool.
So anyways,

630
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,264
this is the chimp stands there and makes
this snake noise and then all bunch of 

631
00:37:52,261 --> 00:37:53,094
other chimps come running and you know,
some of them stay a fairways from the 

632
00:37:56,311 --> 00:37:57,144
snake and some of them get pretty close,
but they'll stand there and watch that 

633
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:02,580
snake for like 24 hours,
you know.

634
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:04,740
So they're fascinated by it.
And you know,

635
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:05,574
if you've handled snakes,
you can understand that fascination 

636
00:38:07,561 --> 00:38:10,450
because they're fascinating,
you know,

637
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,470
and they're numinous.

638
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,760
I would say that that's the right way of
putting it.

639
00:38:14,761 --> 00:38:18,780
A numinous is a word that means 
intrinsically meaningful,

640
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,190
like fire,
you know,

641
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,410
you can't look away from fire,
you know,

642
00:38:22,411 --> 00:38:23,910
if you're sitting in front of a 
fireplace,

643
00:38:23,911 --> 00:38:27,840
it's like you're staring at it and 
that's because you're all descended from

644
00:38:27,841 --> 00:38:28,674
the first mad chimpanzee who had some 
weird genetic mutation that made it 

645
00:38:33,901 --> 00:38:38,590
impossible for to stay away from fire.
It was like the first chimp arsonist,

646
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,793
you know,
and,

647
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,280
and he figured it out and well,
hey,

648
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:44,620
now he was a chimp with a stick with 
fire on it.

649
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:47,830
Like that's a mega chimp man.
And so,

650
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:48,873
you know,
we have that mutation in spades and no 

651
00:38:51,821 --> 00:38:54,490
wonder.
So anyways,

652
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:58,360
um,
so they,

653
00:38:58,361 --> 00:38:59,194
they make this,
they have this reaction to snakes and 

654
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:02,763
chimps that have never seen a snake.
If they're in a cage and you throw a 

655
00:39:05,141 --> 00:39:07,240
rubber snake in there,
it's like bang,

656
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:09,700
they hit the roof,
but then they look at the snake,

657
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:11,170
you know,
so it's like,

658
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:14,590
it's terrifying and fascinating at the 
same time.

659
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:17,500
And you should look at the snake because
you want to know what it does,

660
00:39:17,501 --> 00:39:19,750
but you should stay away from it because
it's a snake,

661
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,613
so you,
you're kind of screwed in terms of your 

662
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,860
motivations,
right?

663
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,870
One is get the hell away and the other 
is,

664
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:26,853
while don't,
don't let that thing do anything that 

665
00:39:28,811 --> 00:39:29,644
you're not watching.
And so that's really the reaction we 

666
00:39:32,171 --> 00:39:35,440
have to the unknown.
It's terrifying.

667
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:37,600
But we watch it.
And then,

668
00:39:37,601 --> 00:39:38,434
you know,
the Meta story is that not only do we 

669
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:41,920
watch it,
but we go explore it.

670
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,860
And so you might think,
well back in the garden of Eden,

671
00:39:44,861 --> 00:39:47,230
so to speak,
when we were living in trees,

672
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:50,650
the snakes used to come and eat us and,
and our,

673
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:55,270
our offspring more likely and you know,
we weren't very happy about that.

674
00:39:55,540 --> 00:40:00,540
And then we figured out how to maybe 
maybe by accident drop a stay a stick on

675
00:40:00,581 --> 00:40:04,690
a snake and that was a good thing 
because the snake didn't like that.

676
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:08,920
And then maybe the next thing we learned
a little later was to like actually take

677
00:40:08,921 --> 00:40:09,754
a stick and whack the snake with it.
And you can believe that the first 

678
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:18,490
primate who figured out that was just as
popular as the Guy Who mastered fire.

679
00:40:18,491 --> 00:40:21,880
And so we're pretty good at whacking 
state snakes with sticks,

680
00:40:21,881 --> 00:40:22,714
which is why a springfield has a snake 
whacking day that's devoted to nothing 

681
00:40:28,241 --> 00:40:29,530
but that.
Right?

682
00:40:29,531 --> 00:40:31,480
I don't know if you know that simpsons 
episode,

683
00:40:31,481 --> 00:40:33,970
but it's quite comical.
So.

684
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,373
Well.
So then you think about the snake as a 

685
00:40:36,521 --> 00:40:41,230
Predator and it's the thing that invades
the garden always because you just can't

686
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:44,080
keep snakes out of the damn garden no 
matter how hard you try.

687
00:40:44,081 --> 00:40:44,914
And then you think of snakes and maybe 
you think of medicine aches and like a 

688
00:40:48,281 --> 00:40:49,114
medicine ache would be also a predator,
but maybe that's the Predator that 

689
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:54,184
represents the,
the destructive spirit of the other 

690
00:40:56,801 --> 00:40:59,260
tribe because chimpanzees,
for example,

691
00:40:59,261 --> 00:41:02,950
are quite tribal and they definitely go 
to war with one another.

692
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:03,783
And so you think you abstract out the 
idea of the Predator to represent 

693
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,463
malevolence as such.
And then you take that one step further 

694
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,920
and you realize that the worst of all 
evil predators is the human capacity for

695
00:41:19,841 --> 00:41:22,120
evil.
And then at that point,

696
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,453
you know you're starting to,
I would say psychologize or 

697
00:41:25,841 --> 00:41:29,680
spiritualize,
the idea of danger and making it make it

698
00:41:29,681 --> 00:41:30,514
into something that's conceptual and 
something that's psychological and 

699
00:41:34,911 --> 00:41:39,150
something that you can,
you can face sort of on moss.

700
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,003
I mean,
one of the things people had to figure 

701
00:41:40,941 --> 00:41:41,774
out was how do you deal with danger?
And so you figure out how you deal with 

702
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:46,544
a specific danger,
but then because human beings are so 

703
00:41:48,861 --> 00:41:50,000
damn smart,
they thought,

704
00:41:50,001 --> 00:41:50,834
well,
what if we considered the class of all 

705
00:41:53,001 --> 00:41:53,834
dangerous things?
And then what if we considered a a mode 

706
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,514
of being that was the best mode of being
in the face of the class of all 

707
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:03,320
dangerous things.

708
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,670
Well,
that's a lot better.

709
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:07,550
You get,
you get solve all the dangerous problems

710
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:08,563
all at once instead of having to conjure
up a different solution for every 

711
00:42:11,661 --> 00:42:12,494
dangerous thing.
And that's basically as far as I can 

712
00:42:14,511 --> 00:42:18,620
tell where the hero's story came from.
And the hero story is basically,

713
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:20,870
you know,
there is a community.

714
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:24,170
It's threatened by the emergence of some
old evil,

715
00:42:24,171 --> 00:42:25,004
often represented by a dragon.
That's sort of typical say of the Lord 

716
00:42:28,311 --> 00:42:31,910
of the rings stories.
There's a hero,

717
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:34,340
often a humble guy,
but not always.

718
00:42:34,341 --> 00:42:39,200
Sometimes a night decides he'll go out 
there and chase down the snake,

719
00:42:39,201 --> 00:42:40,034
maybe even or the serpent or the dragon 
and maybe even in its layer and he'll 

720
00:42:43,641 --> 00:42:44,474
have a bunch of adventures on the way 
that transform him from useless naive 

721
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,633
hobbit into sword wielding hero and he 
confronts the Dragon and gets the gold 

722
00:42:55,731 --> 00:43:00,731
and frees the people that it had 
enslaved and then comes back transformed

723
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:04,280
to share what he's learned with the 
community.

724
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:04,851
It's like,
well,

725
00:43:04,851 --> 00:43:07,190
that's the human story fundamentally.
And that's,

726
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,353
that's our basic instinctive pattern.
And it's represented in narratives 

727
00:43:11,001 --> 00:43:13,610
constantly.
And that's partly what this sea,

728
00:43:13,611 --> 00:43:15,260
this has meaning,
you know,

729
00:43:15,261 --> 00:43:17,660
what this means?
Why,

730
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,610
why do you know?
Well,

731
00:43:19,611 --> 00:43:20,444
you know,
because it draws on symbolic 

732
00:43:21,681 --> 00:43:23,780
representations that you already 
understand.

733
00:43:23,781 --> 00:43:24,614
You understand that a mess of tooth 
snakes is not a good thing and that may 

734
00:43:30,051 --> 00:43:34,250
be the sensible thing to do is stomp 
them and

735
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:37,183
it's not like you need an instruction 
manual to figure out what the poster 

736
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,060
means.
And so,

737
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:42,283
you know,
that's two different representations of 

738
00:43:43,671 --> 00:43:46,240
Hitler that sort of the Pro Hitler 
representation.

739
00:43:46,241 --> 00:43:49,290
And I would say that's the Anti Hitler 
representation.

740
00:43:49,291 --> 00:43:50,990
And you know,
that's the real Hitler,

741
00:43:50,991 --> 00:43:53,630
who at this point does not look like a 
very happy clam.

742
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,830
So.
So that's the known.

743
00:43:56,831 --> 00:43:57,664
That's culture.
Now it's order and what's eternally 

744
00:44:00,651 --> 00:44:05,651
juxtaposed to culture and the known and 
the explored and order is the unknown.

745
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:12,200
And the unknown is a strange place.
The unknown is actually.

746
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:13,543
It's a physical place like the unknown 
is the place that when you're camping 

747
00:44:17,391 --> 00:44:18,224
and you're around a fire,
the unknown is everything outside the 

748
00:44:21,171 --> 00:44:23,990
circle of the light.
And you remember in the Lion King,

749
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,630
you may not remember when,
when,

750
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:30,080
when Mufasa,
that's the king,

751
00:44:30,081 --> 00:44:30,914
right?
Goes and takes Simba up to show him his 

752
00:44:33,331 --> 00:44:37,110
territory.
He says he is the king of everything.

753
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:40,110
The light touches.
And that's a very old idea.

754
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:43,020
And you guys had no problem with.
That was fine.

755
00:44:43,021 --> 00:44:45,480
That made sense.
And that I would be on the light was the

756
00:44:45,481 --> 00:44:48,090
darkness.
And that was the elephant graveyard.

757
00:44:48,091 --> 00:44:50,820
That was death.
That was the place of death and danger.

758
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:54,180
That's where the hyenas hung out.
And you weren't supposed to go there.

759
00:44:54,181 --> 00:44:55,260
And so of course,
Simba,

760
00:44:55,261 --> 00:44:56,094
because he's a rule breaking hero,
just like Harry Potter immediately goes 

761
00:44:59,401 --> 00:45:00,210
there.

762
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:01,060
And so,
you know,

763
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,810
that's like the forbidden fruit.
It's the same sort of idea.

764
00:45:03,811 --> 00:45:04,644
If you want someone to do something,
the best thing to do is tell them that 

765
00:45:09,601 --> 00:45:13,110
they shouldn't and not explain why,
you know.

766
00:45:13,111 --> 00:45:13,944
So for example,
if I said to you at the beginning of 

767
00:45:15,691 --> 00:45:17,400
this class,
look,

768
00:45:17,401 --> 00:45:18,234
I've got one rule here,
don't sit in that chair no matter what 

769
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:27,210
you'd be thinking the whole year,
especially if I reminded you just what's

770
00:45:27,211 --> 00:45:30,030
up with that chair.
Like that's chairs magical.

771
00:45:30,031 --> 00:45:32,040
All of a sudden you,
some of you might even,

772
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,830
while you probably wouldn't,
because this is a ridiculous example,

773
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:35,843
but maybe you know,
you come to class early and sit in that 

774
00:45:37,591 --> 00:45:40,020
chair just to see what would happen.
You know,

775
00:45:40,021 --> 00:45:43,140
and people are very curious.
And that's exactly what we're like.

776
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:45,360
And that's a very old story too,
right?

777
00:45:45,361 --> 00:45:47,040
It's like opening Pandora's box.

778
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,080
Don't open that box.
You'll be sorry.

779
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:49,914
It's like,
oh,

780
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:51,203
you know,
all of the horrors of the world fly out 

781
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:53,783
and believe me,
you will open Pandora's box many times 

782
00:45:57,601 --> 00:45:58,434
in your life because you know with your 
family or maybe your mate or maybe your 

783
00:46:03,481 --> 00:46:04,314
children,
you'll have this idea that they have a 

784
00:46:06,541 --> 00:46:10,740
box with things in it that you want to 
know about and you'll say,

785
00:46:10,741 --> 00:46:11,574
well,
I'm kind of curious about this 

786
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:15,720
particular event,
so why don't you tell me about it?

787
00:46:15,721 --> 00:46:17,030
And they say,
well no,

788
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,873
we probably really shouldn't open that 
box and you keep bugging him and then 

789
00:46:20,701 --> 00:46:21,534
they open it and then all sorts of 
things fly out that you didn't expect 

790
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:26,130
and then maybe you think,
hey,

791
00:46:26,131 --> 00:46:29,220
it would have been better if I would 
have just left that damn box closed,

792
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:30,413
but,
and you can do the same thing to 

793
00:46:31,681 --> 00:46:32,490
yourself.

794
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:35,460
Believe me.
And so the Pandora's box idea,

795
00:46:35,461 --> 00:46:37,200
the forbidden fruit idea.
That's,

796
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:38,483
that's a major league idea.
And part of the reason in the Judeo 

797
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,293
Christian tradition,
why people are saddled with the notion 

798
00:46:44,221 --> 00:46:49,221
of original sin is because hyper 
cortically developed chimpanzees without

799
00:46:50,221 --> 00:46:53,760
much sense.
Can't keep their hands off things.

800
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:54,863
And so they keep exploring even when 
they know better and every time they do 

801
00:46:59,761 --> 00:47:03,390
that,
they learn something that is,

802
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:07,200
that destroys the paradise that they 
currently inhabit.

803
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,350
Right?
Because there's plenty in the.

804
00:47:09,351 --> 00:47:11,280
And I never learned anything in your 
life.

805
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:12,143
It's of importance without it having a 
pretty damn destabilizing effect on you 

806
00:47:16,861 --> 00:47:18,600
at the moment of realization,
right?

807
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:22,680
You learn something happy.
It's like whatever,

808
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:23,580
you know,
that'll,

809
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,560
that means is that I was doing things 
right,

810
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,020
like it's nice and everything,
but it's not informative.

811
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,040
You do something and all hell breaks 
loose.

812
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:35,223
That'll make you think now it's for sure
you might never stop thinking for the 

813
00:47:38,321 --> 00:47:41,680
rest of your life.
So anyways,

814
00:47:41,681 --> 00:47:42,514
the unknown,
the unknown is that which surrounds the 

815
00:47:45,491 --> 00:47:47,530
known.
It's unexplored territory.

816
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:52,710
It's usually represented as female,
I think for a variety of reasons.

817
00:47:52,931 --> 00:47:54,130
And not,
not as female.

818
00:47:54,131 --> 00:47:55,690
Exactly.
It's not the right way to think about it

819
00:47:55,691 --> 00:47:56,524
as feminine.
And that's not the same thing because 

820
00:47:58,421 --> 00:48:03,421
feminine is a symbolic category,
whereas female is like an actual female.

821
00:48:03,971 --> 00:48:07,110
And so you don't want to confuse the 
metaphor with the,

822
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:09,460
with the,
with the actuality.

823
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:10,763
Um,
because we had these social cognitive 

824
00:48:12,761 --> 00:48:14,240
categories built in,
you know,

825
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:17,140
you might say masculine,
feminine and offspring,

826
00:48:17,141 --> 00:48:20,800
something like that.
We had to use what we could to represent

827
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:21,663
what we were attempting to figure out 
and we kind of mapped them onto the 

828
00:48:25,961 --> 00:48:30,010
external realities of being the best we 
could,

829
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:31,330
using what we could.

830
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:32,590
And so,
you know,

831
00:48:32,591 --> 00:48:33,424
nature is benevolent and it's fruitful.
All things come from nature and all 

832
00:48:38,681 --> 00:48:40,420
things come from the unknown,
right?

833
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:45,450
Because the known is already there.
It's the unknown that manifests the new,

834
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:48,070
right?
And so that's part of the reason for the

835
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,670
characterization of the unknown as 
feminine.

836
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:52,933
Um,
and then there's also the case that 

837
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:58,690
women play a massive role in sexual 
selection among human beings.

838
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:02,740
So that from an evolutionary 
perspective,

839
00:49:02,741 --> 00:49:05,560
you're twice as likely to be a failure 
if you're a man than you are.

840
00:49:05,561 --> 00:49:06,394
If you're a woman in that you have twice
as many female ancestors as male 

841
00:49:11,111 --> 00:49:12,310
ancestors and you think,
well,

842
00:49:12,311 --> 00:49:13,840
that's impossible,
but it's not.

843
00:49:13,841 --> 00:49:18,040
All you have to do is imagine that every
woman has one child,

844
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:21,520
half the men have to,
and the other half have zero.

845
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:26,470
And so end of problem,
and that's basically how it works out.

846
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:31,390
So women are more choosy maters than men
by a substantial margin.

847
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,053
There was a funny study done by the guy 
who established one of the big dating 

848
00:49:37,721 --> 00:49:38,554
sites and he looked at how women rated 
men and they rated the 50th percentile 

849
00:49:46,991 --> 00:49:47,824
man at the 15th percentile.
So 85 percent of men were below average 

850
00:49:52,061 --> 00:49:56,590
according to women's ratings.
Now men had their same arbitrary choices

851
00:49:56,591 --> 00:49:57,424
because of course they preferred younger
women to older women and they were more 

852
00:50:02,171 --> 00:50:03,590
swayed,
I would say by um,

853
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:05,403
by attractiveness,
but that didn't have nearly as big an 

854
00:50:07,511 --> 00:50:10,740
effect on their actually actual rating 
of,

855
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,780
of women.
So anyways,

856
00:50:12,781 --> 00:50:13,840
so,
you know,

857
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,510
from a,
from a Darwinian perspective,

858
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:20,980
nature is that which selects,
that's all it is.

859
00:50:20,981 --> 00:50:25,981
And so sexual selection plays a massive 
role in human evolution.

860
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,010
You know,
the fact that we have these massive

861
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:28,843
brains is very likely a consequence of a
positive feedback loop and sexual 

862
00:50:32,391 --> 00:50:34,160
selection,
you know,

863
00:50:34,161 --> 00:50:34,994
because otherwise that's the only time 
you can get really rapid changes in 

864
00:50:38,391 --> 00:50:42,200
evolutionary space where you get a 
process going.

865
00:50:42,201 --> 00:50:43,034
That reinforces itself.
So there's a little preference for 

866
00:50:45,411 --> 00:50:46,244
intelligence and then that produces more
intelligent men and women and then 

867
00:50:49,521 --> 00:50:52,050
there's a little more preference for 
intelligence and you know,

868
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:55,270
maybe then that turns into the ability 
to speak and,

869
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:56,143
or to master fire and then there's way 
more selection for intelligence in the 

870
00:50:59,421 --> 00:51:02,350
brain just goes like this,
you know,

871
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:07,280
and women have paid a pretty big price 
for that because your hips are basically

872
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:11,690
so wide that you can barely run and if 
they were any wider than you couldn't.

873
00:51:11,691 --> 00:51:12,524
And of course the,
the pelvic passageway through which the 

874
00:51:15,591 --> 00:51:20,591
baby travels is too small.
So it's really painful and dangerous and

875
00:51:20,721 --> 00:51:23,570
the baby's head has to compress quite a 
lot.

876
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:24,403
I mean they come out,
cone shaped often and then they're born 

877
00:51:27,801 --> 00:51:30,740
really young so you have to take care of
them forever.

878
00:51:30,741 --> 00:51:31,700
Like what the hell,
you know,

879
00:51:31,701 --> 00:51:34,460
a deer is born,
a fawn is born and it's like two seconds

880
00:51:34,461 --> 00:51:37,160
later it's standing and then it's 
running from a lion.

881
00:51:37,161 --> 00:51:38,480
It's like,
you know,

882
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:39,493
it's like 15 minutes later and a baby.
It's like you just lies there and you 

883
00:51:44,961 --> 00:51:47,630
know,
utters plaintive noises.

884
00:51:47,631 --> 00:51:48,464
That's all it can do,
and that does that for like 10 months 

885
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:56,210
before it could skitter away from a 
slothy if it was predatory,

886
00:51:56,211 --> 00:51:57,044
you know,
so you really got to take care of those 

887
00:51:58,851 --> 00:52:02,270
creatures.
And so that's a big price to pay.

888
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:05,180
That's a big price to pay for our 
critical evolution.

889
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:06,283
So anyways,
here's some of the symbolic 

890
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:11,720
representations represents 
representatives of the unknown,

891
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:15,460
the unconscious dot uneasy,
and four of the ID.

892
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:18,020
So that's sort of Freud's representation
of the unknown,

893
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:21,320
the terrors of the darkness.
That's the unknown.

894
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:23,173
The monsters that lurk there,
the source and the resting place of all 

895
00:52:26,511 --> 00:52:28,340
things.
The great mother,

896
00:52:28,341 --> 00:52:30,830
the Queen,
the Matrix which means mater,

897
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:33,380
which means mother,
the matriarch matter,

898
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:35,000
mother,
the container,

899
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:38,030
the Cornucopia,
the object to be fertilized,

900
00:52:38,031 --> 00:52:39,860
the source of all things,
the fecund,

901
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:43,460
the pregnant,
the strange,

902
00:52:43,461 --> 00:52:45,260
the emotional,
the foreigner,

903
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:48,350
the place of returned and rest.
The deeper the valley,

904
00:52:48,351 --> 00:52:50,240
the cleft,
the cave hell,

905
00:52:50,241 --> 00:52:53,690
death and the grave because it's beyond 
the moon.

906
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:57,980
Ruler of the night and mysterious,
dark and matter and the earth.

907
00:52:59,060 --> 00:52:59,893
And you know all this because when you 
watch a movie that's rife with symbolic 

908
00:53:03,651 --> 00:53:04,484
representations that draws on those 
underlying metaphors and they're 

909
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:08,880
natural,
I mean where does it,

910
00:53:08,881 --> 00:53:11,610
which live well in a swamp for God's 
sake.

911
00:53:11,611 --> 00:53:14,480
She doesn't live in the penthouse of a 
New York Tower.

912
00:53:14,481 --> 00:53:16,700
She lives at a swamp and it's dark 
there.

913
00:53:16,701 --> 00:53:18,800
And if the moon's up,
that's a better.

914
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:21,770
And maybe it could be a crescent moon or
maybe it could be a full moon,

915
00:53:21,771 --> 00:53:22,604
but you know,
which is live in the right place if 

916
00:53:24,591 --> 00:53:25,770
you're going to understand it

917
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:28,140
and you all,
you understand all of that.

918
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:32,940
And it's part of the structure of your 
imagination you could say.

919
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:38,360
And so it's part of the unspoken 
fantastical Ah,

920
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:42,630
imagination that unites all of us and 
that makes us specifically human.

921
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:44,943
There is a good representation of the 
underworld and the place of 

922
00:53:47,611 --> 00:53:50,820
transformation.
So that's hell in Isis.

923
00:53:50,821 --> 00:53:54,990
In Egypt was queen of the underworld and
the underworld generally has a queen and

924
00:53:54,991 --> 00:53:57,960
she usually shows up when order falls 
apart.

925
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:02,460
And so you go to the underworld.
When your life falls apart,

926
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,270
that's what it means.
And so when you see these stories of the

927
00:54:06,271 --> 00:54:08,290
hero,
you know,

928
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,510
journeying to unknown lands of terror 
and danger,

929
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,210
that's,
that's what happens to you.

930
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:16,980
It happens to you all the time.
You know you're,

931
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:21,300
you're in this little safe space like 
the hobbit in the Shire,

932
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:22,373
and then you know there's a great evil 
brewing somewhere and you can no longer 

933
00:54:26,101 --> 00:54:26,640
ignore it.

934
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:27,473
So off you go into the land of terror 
and uncertainty and better to go on 

935
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:34,680
purpose then accidentally,
that's for sure,

936
00:54:34,681 --> 00:54:38,760
because at least you can be prepared.
And we also know that if you're going to

937
00:54:38,761 --> 00:54:42,120
face a threat,
if you face it voluntarily,

938
00:54:42,121 --> 00:54:46,260
what happens is your body activates 
itself for exploration and mastery.

939
00:54:46,261 --> 00:54:50,010
But if you face it voluntarily,
same size threat,

940
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,180
then you,
you,

941
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,890
you,
you revert to pray,

942
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:56,370
pray mode and you're frozen.
And that's way,

943
00:54:56,371 --> 00:54:58,590
way,
way more stressful.

944
00:54:58,591 --> 00:54:59,424
It's way harder on your body and so it's
better to keep your eyes open and watch 

945
00:55:04,291 --> 00:55:06,400
for emergent threats because you all 
know,

946
00:55:06,401 --> 00:55:07,234
you know what you're not doing quite 
right and where your life is likely to 

947
00:55:09,451 --> 00:55:11,400
unravel.
You all have a sense of that.

948
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:14,970
And the best thing to do is to not 
ignore that,

949
00:55:14,971 --> 00:55:16,950
to pay attention to it,
to watch it,

950
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,590
and to take corrective action early.

951
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:23,610
And then you know,
you stay on top of things and things,

952
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:24,803
your little trip to the underworld might
be a few minutes long instead of a 

953
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:30,690
catastrophe that produces posttraumatic 
stress disorder,

954
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,900
knocks you out for four or five years 
and maybe you never recover.

955
00:55:34,350 --> 00:55:35,940
So.
And that's,

956
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:36,893
you know,
that's what these kind of symbolic 

957
00:55:37,801 --> 00:55:39,330
representations mean.
It's,

958
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,940
those are states of being that,
that,

959
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:47,190
that indicate being devoured and you can
be devoured by your own unconscious.

960
00:55:48,121 --> 00:55:49,710
Jesus.
That happens all the time.

961
00:55:49,711 --> 00:55:50,910
What does that mean?
Well,

962
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,193
you know,
and it's an autonomous thing in some 

963
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:55,141
sense.
You know,

964
00:55:55,141 --> 00:55:55,974
like if you,
if you get depressed or if you get 

965
00:55:57,421 --> 00:55:59,970
really anxious,
you don't have any control over that.

966
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:03,930
It's like it sweeps up over you and 
pulls you down.

967
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:08,400
Wydown well down is where you go when 
you're sad.

968
00:56:08,401 --> 00:56:09,750
You don't go up,
man,

969
00:56:09,751 --> 00:56:10,440
I'm up today.

970
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,490
Oh,
that's too bad.

971
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,200
No,
it's man.

972
00:56:13,201 --> 00:56:15,540
I'm down today.
And while that's partly this,

973
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:20,370
and it's partly because this is 
subordinate and it's partly because down

974
00:56:20,371 --> 00:56:24,580
is closer to the ground and farther from
the sky,

975
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:28,660
like there's all sorts of reasons you're
feeling down rather than op.

976
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:30,520
Op is where you're aiming,
right?

977
00:56:30,521 --> 00:56:31,090
Yay.
Mop.

978
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:33,070
You don't aim down.
Well,

979
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:34,653
the reason those phrases make sense 
because they're locked deeply into this 

980
00:56:37,661 --> 00:56:38,494
underlying structure of imagination.
And while those are the architects of 

981
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:45,830
the archetypal structures according to 
young and um,

982
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:50,740
I,
I think that he's far as I can tell

983
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:54,230
he's dead accurate.
Um,

984
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,900
and I think we understand the biology of
such things much better than we did.

985
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,240
So there is more representation.
She's,

986
00:57:01,241 --> 00:57:04,440
she's quite the friendly creature.
That's Kelly.

987
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:07,210
Um,
I like this representation better.

988
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,730
Those are heads by the way and hands.
Um,

989
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:12,860
so she sort of represents well,
very complex thing.

990
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:17,440
She represents death,
she represents transformation in this.

991
00:57:17,441 --> 00:57:19,930
I really liked this representation.
I think it's brilliant.

992
00:57:19,931 --> 00:57:20,764
So imagine that what the people were 
doing who formulated these 

993
00:57:22,541 --> 00:57:23,374
representations,
what they were trying to do was to make 

994
00:57:26,891 --> 00:57:30,940
a representation of the domain of threat
itself,

995
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:32,193
right?
So that they could deal with the idea 

996
00:57:33,131 --> 00:57:34,720
that because we can say,
threat,

997
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:35,801
well,
what is that?

998
00:57:35,801 --> 00:57:37,150
What the hell does that mean?
Well,

999
00:57:37,151 --> 00:57:40,660
threat is the category of all 
threatening things.

1000
00:57:40,661 --> 00:57:41,494
And so then you can think about threat 
and you can think about threat across 

1001
00:57:44,891 --> 00:57:45,724
all those individual instances and maybe
you can figure out how to deal with 

1002
00:57:48,281 --> 00:57:49,150
threat,
right?

1003
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:50,073
How,
what's the best way to be in the world 

1004
00:57:52,541 --> 00:57:55,180
so that you most effectively deal with 
threat.

1005
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:59,230
While that's sort of like,
apart from how do you deal with pain,

1006
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,110
that sort of like the ultimate question 
of human beings.

1007
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:04,450
You want to be terrified?
No.

1008
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,090
So you want to be in danger?
No.

1009
00:58:07,091 --> 00:58:07,924
So like,
you better figure out how to deal with 

1010
00:58:09,071 --> 00:58:10,180
threats.
So first of all,

1011
00:58:10,181 --> 00:58:11,014
you have to conceptualize it.
So we'll take a look at this 

1012
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:16,760
representation.
So now it's Kelly sheer.

1013
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,610
Her hair is on fire.
Well,

1014
00:58:18,611 --> 00:58:19,480
fire,
you know,

1015
00:58:19,481 --> 00:58:22,180
that's,
that's a numinous phenomena.

1016
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:26,320
Dangerous but transformative.
She's wearing a headdress of skulls.

1017
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:29,550
Um,
she has a weapon in this hand.

1018
00:58:29,551 --> 00:58:30,880
And,
and uh,

1019
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:34,360
she has a tiger's tongue.
She often has a snake around her waist.

1020
00:58:35,630 --> 00:58:37,990
Need none of these do,
but she often does,

1021
00:58:37,991 --> 00:58:39,400
but in this case,
the stem,

1022
00:58:39,401 --> 00:58:42,880
that's because snake,
we've already covered that.

1023
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,553
Well,
these things that looked like snakes 

1024
00:58:45,581 --> 00:58:48,250
here aren't you notice how her belly is 
concave?

1025
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:49,563
Well,
it's because she's just given birth to 

1026
00:58:50,621 --> 00:58:51,454
this unfortunate person that she happens
to be standing on and she's eating him 

1027
00:58:54,461 --> 00:58:58,960
intestines first and that's a fire ring,
which he is in,

1028
00:58:58,961 --> 00:59:00,940
and then it's got skulls on the inside 
of it.

1029
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:03,310
It's like,
what's that supposed to do?

1030
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:04,563
Well,
partly it's supposed to represent that 

1031
00:59:06,101 --> 00:59:08,380
which terrifies you.
It's like,

1032
00:59:08,381 --> 00:59:09,700
yeah,
fair enough,

1033
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:10,563
man,
because I don't imagine you saw those 

1034
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:12,814
things in there before I explain them,
but someone who was familiar with that 

1035
00:59:15,281 --> 00:59:16,114
image would know what it meant.
It's like some poor artist was sitting 

1036
00:59:19,121 --> 00:59:19,841
there thinking,
well,

1037
00:59:19,841 --> 00:59:21,860
how do I represent?
It's like,

1038
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:23,270
Bang,
Whoa,

1039
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:24,283
okay,
we'll put that down and then we won't 

1040
00:59:25,341 --> 00:59:26,960
look at it again.
So,

1041
00:59:26,961 --> 00:59:31,961
and then what do you do with this?
You make sacrifices to it and you think,

1042
00:59:32,031 --> 00:59:35,570
well that's kind of primitive,
you know,

1043
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:39,500
first of all,
well that doesn't really exist.

1044
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,710
Well it does.
If it's an amalgam of threat symbols,

1045
00:59:42,711 --> 00:59:45,350
I can tell you that it exists.
That's for sure.

1046
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:49,340
So it exists as an abstraction.
If nothing else do you offer it?

1047
00:59:49,341 --> 00:59:51,650
Sacrifices?
Well,

1048
00:59:51,651 --> 00:59:53,090
what the hell do you think you do?

1049
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:54,343
What do you do it in class?
Why aren't you like drinking vodka and 

1050
00:59:57,141 --> 00:59:59,120
snorting cocaine?
You know,

1051
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:04,160
because you could be doing that instead.
Here you are listening to me,

1052
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:06,680
you know,
slaving away in university,

1053
01:00:06,681 --> 01:00:08,030
you're young.
It's like,

1054
01:00:08,031 --> 01:00:10,580
really?
You've got nothing better to do than sit

1055
01:00:10,581 --> 01:00:11,414
there.
You know what you're willing to forego 

1056
01:00:14,181 --> 01:00:17,090
today's pleasure for tomorrow's 
advantage.

1057
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:18,103
And that's what sacrifice is.
And human being's discovered that 

1058
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:23,330
dramatically first.
You know,

1059
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:25,970
like we're,
we're apes for God's sake.

1060
01:00:25,971 --> 01:00:28,010
We didn't just leap up and think,
oh,

1061
01:00:28,011 --> 01:00:30,200
we better save for tomorrow.
You know,

1062
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:31,043
we took thousands of years for that idea
to emerge and it emerged in dramatic 

1063
01:00:35,481 --> 01:00:37,220
form and it was sort of like,
well,

1064
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:38,593
society is sort of like a god no.
What they weren't thinking this through 

1065
01:00:41,541 --> 01:00:42,374
is like,
if you're going to represent society 

1066
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:46,820
well,
it's like this masculine God.

1067
01:00:46,821 --> 01:00:48,620
That's always judging the hell out of 
you.

1068
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:50,840
That's everywhere,
all at the same time.

1069
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:51,381
It's like,
yeah,

1070
01:00:51,381 --> 01:00:52,220
yeah,
that's true.

1071
01:00:52,221 --> 01:00:54,290
Absolutely.
And what do you have to do with it?

1072
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,480
Well,
you have to give it what it wants.

1073
01:00:56,810 --> 01:00:57,643
Why?
Why do you have to give it what it 

1074
01:00:58,551 --> 01:01:02,180
wants?
Because it'll crush you if you don't.

1075
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:03,433
And that's exactly right.
And if you're lucky and you give it the 

1076
01:01:06,531 --> 01:01:10,610
right sacrifice,
then it will smile on you and you get to

1077
01:01:10,611 --> 01:01:12,470
have a good life.
And that was like,

1078
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:15,650
that was the major discovery of mankind.
Man.

1079
01:01:15,651 --> 01:01:20,240
That was the killer discovery.
It was like the discovery of the future,

1080
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:22,123
you know,
we discovered the future as a place and 

1081
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:27,710
it was a place that you could bargain 
with.

1082
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:30,440
You can bargain with the future.
Wow.

1083
01:01:30,441 --> 01:01:32,630
That's just what an idea that is.
You know,

1084
01:01:32,631 --> 01:01:34,310
it's,
it's so unlikely.

1085
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,820
Well,
how do you bargain with the future while

1086
01:01:37,821 --> 01:01:39,470
you give it what it wants?

1087
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:40,573
And you know,
some of that's you maintain your social 

1088
01:01:42,261 --> 01:01:46,190
relationship and you know,
you make yourself useful to other people

1089
01:01:46,191 --> 01:01:51,080
and you shape yourself so that you can 
cooperate with people and you,

1090
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:52,633
you don't act impulsively,
and maybe you squirrel something away 

1091
01:01:55,791 --> 01:01:58,850
for the next harvest,
even if you're hungry and you know,

1092
01:01:58,851 --> 01:02:03,851
and then the future isn't hell and you 
make the proper sacrifices.

1093
01:02:04,071 --> 01:02:04,904
And so if you sacrifice to Kelly,
then she turns into her opposite and 

1094
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:13,580
showers benevolence on you.
And that's mother nature,

1095
01:02:13,581 --> 01:02:14,414
right?
It's like,

1096
01:02:14,750 --> 01:02:16,850
look out for Mother Nature,
man,

1097
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:18,253
you know,
two weeks out in the right now and your 

1098
01:02:20,101 --> 01:02:23,430
dad and it's not pleasant.
And then if it's the spring,

1099
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:26,550
you'll last longer,
but the bugs eat you.

1100
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:29,640
And so that's not very fun either.
So nature,

1101
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:33,000
you know,
it's bent on your destruction,

1102
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:37,200
but if you treat it properly and 
carefully and make the right sacrifices,

1103
01:02:37,201 --> 01:02:42,201
then maybe one of her trees will offer 
you some fruit and that would be okay.

1104
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:44,730
And so,
believe me,

1105
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:47,100
lots of people died trying to figure 
that out.

1106
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:51,390
So here's another way of looking at it.
So I said,

1107
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:53,010
you know,
order and chaos,

1108
01:02:53,011 --> 01:02:55,080
known unknown,
unexplored territory,

1109
01:02:55,081 --> 01:02:57,090
unexplored territory.
I love this.

1110
01:02:57,091 --> 01:02:57,924
This is the Taoist symbol.
It's a symbol of being and being isn't 

1111
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:05,280
reality as you would conceptualize it as
a scientist.

1112
01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:10,610
It's more like reality as it manifests 
itself to you as a living thing,

1113
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:12,920
which is completely different.
You know,

1114
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:15,960
science extracts out all the 
subjectivity,

1115
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:17,213
all it is,
there is an array of objective facts of 

1116
01:03:19,201 --> 01:03:21,810
equivalent value and that's part of its 
method,

1117
01:03:21,811 --> 01:03:23,670
but that's not the world in which you 
live.

1118
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:27,420
The world in which you live is full of 
motivation and emotion.

1119
01:03:27,421 --> 01:03:31,290
It's full of terror and pain and joy and
frustration and,

1120
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,690
and other people.
That's for sure.

1121
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:36,480
And so that's the real world.
And so,

1122
01:03:36,481 --> 01:03:37,740
well that's what this is.

1123
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:39,240
It's,
it's the real world.

1124
01:03:39,241 --> 01:03:40,770
And what is it made out of?
Well,

1125
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:43,530
it's made out of all those things,
you know,

1126
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:46,300
that can get out of hand,
you know,

1127
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:47,423
because the explored territory and the 
known can get so damn tight that it's 

1128
01:03:51,271 --> 01:03:54,780
nothing but a tyrant.
And then it's all those things you don't

1129
01:03:54,781 --> 01:03:55,614
know.
And that's pretty exciting because you 

1130
01:03:56,641 --> 01:03:57,474
know,
you want to go find out some things you 

1131
01:03:58,291 --> 01:04:00,810
don't know and that adds a lot of spice 
to life.

1132
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:01,793
You want a little adventure.
You don't want to go out with someone 

1133
01:04:03,781 --> 01:04:07,470
who's so predictable that you know 
everything about them in a week.

1134
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:09,210
You know,
unless you're hyper conservative,

1135
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:12,330
you want to go out with someone who's 
got there a little erratic,

1136
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:15,390
like not too erratic.
Let's say they're a little dangerous,

1137
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,433
perhaps not too dangerous,
but some of that at least you want 

1138
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,700
predictability with a bit of 
unpredictability in there.

1139
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,260
Well,
that's exactly what this means.

1140
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:26,094
It's thick.
That's predictability with a little 

1141
01:04:27,481 --> 01:04:28,314
unpredictability in it.
And what that also means is that what 

1142
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:34,620
you know can be turned into what you 
don't know just like that.

1143
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,500
And now it's going to happen to you.
Lots of times in your life,

1144
01:04:37,501 --> 01:04:39,660
man,
when someone close to you dies,

1145
01:04:39,661 --> 01:04:41,550
suddenly it's like,
poof,

1146
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,940
order turns into chaos and now you're in
chaos.

1147
01:04:44,941 --> 01:04:47,100
And what the hell are you going to do 
there?

1148
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,113
And that's a good question because you 
need to know what to do there because 

1149
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:55,830
you're going to be there and it happens 
to you when your dreams fall apart,

1150
01:04:55,831 --> 01:04:56,664
you know,
I mean your dreams for your life or you 

1151
01:04:58,550 --> 01:04:59,383
know,
when you discover something awful about 

1152
01:05:00,571 --> 01:05:02,940
yourself that you didn't know or you 
know,

1153
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:05,640
it flips on you all the time and in 
small ways.

1154
01:05:05,641 --> 01:05:08,910
Sometimes you know,
you have a fight with a friend or in big

1155
01:05:08,911 --> 01:05:12,390
ways that,
that wipe you out for while indefinitely

1156
01:05:12,391 --> 01:05:16,710
sometimes because you can fall into 
chaos and never get out.

1157
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:18,970
You know,
that's the people who are trapped in the

1158
01:05:18,971 --> 01:05:19,804
belly of the beast.
It isn't necessarily that when you 

1159
01:05:21,941 --> 01:05:25,450
descend into chaos that you learn 
something and you get back out.

1160
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:29,470
You could just be stuck there suffering 
until you die.

1161
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:30,760
And that's,
you know,

1162
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:32,380
I wouldn't recommend that.
You know,

1163
01:05:32,381 --> 01:05:36,490
it's something to avoid.
But it happens to people all the time.

1164
01:05:36,670 --> 01:05:38,980
All the time.
You see them wandering around,

1165
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:42,550
you know,
shattered on the streets of Toronto,

1166
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:44,380
you know,
they're done.

1167
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:48,760
They're in chaos and there's so much 
chaos around them that you won't even go

1168
01:05:48,761 --> 01:05:52,150
near them.
The chaos spreads like eight feet around

1169
01:05:52,151 --> 01:05:54,220
them and so when you see someone like 
that,

1170
01:05:54,221 --> 01:05:55,054
you're like,
well first we're not going to look too 

1171
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:57,333
closely,
and people like that often don't like 

1172
01:05:58,961 --> 01:05:59,794
you to look at them because that also 
helps them remember where they are and 

1173
01:06:02,921 --> 01:06:06,520
that's no pleasant thing and you're 
going to just stay away from that.

1174
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:09,580
Maybe you'll cross the street,
maybe you'll keep your head down,

1175
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:10,803
whatever.
You're not going anywhere near that 

1176
01:06:12,221 --> 01:06:15,040
chaos and no bloody wonder.
You know,

1177
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:15,933
and,
and you don't think about it much after 

1178
01:06:17,531 --> 01:06:18,364
you pass it because it's a hell of a 
thing to think about and what are you 

1179
01:06:22,301 --> 01:06:24,760
going to do about it anyway so you don't
know what to do about it.

1180
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:27,610
You might just make it worse.
Well,

1181
01:06:27,611 --> 01:06:28,870
so chaos,
you know,

1182
01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:34,720
that's the other half of life and it can
turn into order sometimes better order.

1183
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:36,730
That's actually what you do when you 
explore,

1184
01:06:36,731 --> 01:06:37,900
right?
You explore,

1185
01:06:37,901 --> 01:06:40,120
you find out something new,
not too new,

1186
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:42,800
not to Pandora boxy,
you know,

1187
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:43,963
bite off as much as you can chew,
but no more and so that rearranges the 

1188
01:06:48,611 --> 01:06:49,444
way you look at the world,
but you're doing it voluntarily so you 

1189
01:06:51,371 --> 01:06:56,371
can kind of tolerate the recalibration 
and you strengthen the order,

1190
01:06:57,071 --> 01:06:57,340
right?

1191
01:06:57,340 --> 01:06:58,173
Because now you become more competent 
and I would say that you're trying to 

1192
01:07:02,231 --> 01:07:06,940
live on the edge between order and chaos
and I and I mean that's a real place.

1193
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:09,010
That's an actual.
It's a Meta place,

1194
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,730
but it's more real than places because 
it's so old.

1195
01:07:12,731 --> 01:07:16,120
It's such an old place.
It really exists and your nervous system

1196
01:07:16,121 --> 01:07:19,060
knows that it sees the world this way.
In fact,

1197
01:07:19,061 --> 01:07:19,894
the right hemisphere is roughly 
specialized for chaos and the left 

1198
01:07:22,901 --> 01:07:25,300
hemisphere is roughly specialized for 
order,

1199
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:26,343
which is why the left hemisphere tends 
to have the linguistic elements and why 

1200
01:07:29,651 --> 01:07:30,484
people are right handed.
And the right hemisphere has a more 

1201
01:07:32,231 --> 01:07:33,064
diffuse structure.
It's more associated with negative 

1202
01:07:35,231 --> 01:07:36,064
emotion and imagination and the to 
communicate between each other through 

1203
01:07:39,101 --> 01:07:39,934
the Corpus callosum and the right 
hemisphere appears to update the less 

1204
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:46,300
left hemisphere kind of slowly,
often in dreams.

1205
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:50,200
And so if you are hurt,
if your right hemisphere has hurt,

1206
01:07:50,201 --> 01:07:53,140
for example,
back here in the prior lobe,

1207
01:07:53,141 --> 01:07:56,680
then you lose the left part of your 
body.

1208
01:07:56,860 --> 01:08:00,400
You can't move it anymore,
but you also lose the idea that you have

1209
01:08:00,401 --> 01:08:03,520
a left part of your body.
So it's like blindness.

1210
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:07,300
It's a blindness to the left.
And so if someone comes along and says,

1211
01:08:07,301 --> 01:08:09,640
you know,
you're not moving your left arm,

1212
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:10,781
you're going to say,
yeah,

1213
01:08:10,781 --> 01:08:14,620
well my arthritis is bothering me to the
I moved it for six months.

1214
01:08:14,770 --> 01:08:16,520
Well,
arthritis is bothering today,

1215
01:08:16,521 --> 01:08:19,110
or you know,
you don't move your left foot like,

1216
01:08:19,111 --> 01:08:19,944
well,
you know,

1217
01:08:20,790 --> 01:08:22,970
uh,
I'm too tired.

1218
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,073
Well,
what's happened is the left hemisphere 

1219
01:08:25,460 --> 01:08:26,293
has a representation of the body and 
it's not being updated because the part 

1220
01:08:29,721 --> 01:08:33,710
of the brain that would notice that the 
left is gone because of a stroke.

1221
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:34,783
It isn't there anymore.
And so the left already has a model and 

1222
01:08:37,930 --> 01:08:38,763
it's not going to change.
Just it's hard to change your model of 

1223
01:08:41,241 --> 01:08:43,220
yourself.
You don't have a tooth pulled.

1224
01:08:43,550 --> 01:08:44,383
What happens?
It's like your damn tongue is in that 

1225
01:08:46,131 --> 01:08:49,910
hole for the next six months fiddling 
around constantly.

1226
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:53,990
And that's because you're rebuilding 
your neurological model of your body.

1227
01:08:53,991 --> 01:08:58,070
It's like try it out with your whole 
left side and see how well you do.

1228
01:08:58,520 --> 01:08:59,353
You know.
So this guy named Ramachandran was 

1229
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:05,860
experimenting with people like this and 
one of the things he did was Kinda.

1230
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:06,793
He was checking their balance and you 
can do that by irrigating the ear with 

1231
01:09:11,541 --> 01:09:13,760
cold water and that makes people go like
this,

1232
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:17,300
makes their eyes move back and forth 
because it upsets the vestibular system.

1233
01:09:17,301 --> 01:09:18,134
And what he found was that if he,
if he poured cold water in the left ear 

1234
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:25,130
of someone with right parietal damage 
who had left neglect,

1235
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:29,510
that they'd all of a sudden sort of wake
up catastrophic Lee,

1236
01:09:29,511 --> 01:09:30,344
they'd have a terrible reaction to the 
fact that they were paralyzed on the 

1237
01:09:33,591 --> 01:09:37,730
left and they would know that it had 
happened and cry.

1238
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:41,330
And it made all sorts of distress and no
wonder,

1239
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:42,553
and then like 20 minutes later they 
snapped back into their damaged mode of 

1240
01:09:47,991 --> 01:09:52,991
being and they would not deny because 
that isn't really what it is,

1241
01:09:53,521 --> 01:09:54,354
is that they couldn't update the model,
they just didn't have the neurology for 

1242
01:09:57,741 --> 01:10:00,050
it anymore.
So they were backed in not noticing that

1243
01:10:00,051 --> 01:10:03,380
it was gone and coming up with stories 
about it and so

1244
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:05,953
well.
So that's a good example of how the 

1245
01:10:06,801 --> 01:10:10,340
right and left hemispheres work together
and how they're kind of mapped onto this

1246
01:10:10,341 --> 01:10:11,174
weirdly enough so you know,
we're map were adapted to the Meta 

1247
01:10:15,141 --> 01:10:15,974
reality.
And so what that would be is we're 

1248
01:10:18,021 --> 01:10:23,021
adapted to that which remains constant 
across the longest spans of time.

1249
01:10:24,410 --> 01:10:29,120
And that's not the same things that you 
see flitting around you day to day.

1250
01:10:29,121 --> 01:10:31,130
Those are just,
they just like clouds.

1251
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:32,780
They're just evaporating.
You know,

1252
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:34,213
there's things underneath that that are 
more fundamental that are more 

1253
01:10:36,171 --> 01:10:39,170
fundamental realities like the dominance
hierarchy,

1254
01:10:39,171 --> 01:10:43,190
like the tribe,
like the danger outside of society,

1255
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:47,690
like the threat that other people pose 
to you and that you pose to yourself.

1256
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:51,830
Those are eternal realities and we're 
adapted to those.

1257
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:55,310
That's our world and that's why we 
express that in stories.

1258
01:10:55,311 --> 01:10:56,960
And so then you might say,
well,

1259
01:10:56,961 --> 01:11:00,250
how do you adapt yourself to this world?
And the answer to that is,

1260
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:02,270
and I believe this is a neurological 
answer,

1261
01:11:02,271 --> 01:11:07,271
I believe this,
that your brain can tell you when you're

1262
01:11:08,631 --> 01:11:09,464
optimally situated between chaos and 
order and the way it tells you that is 

1263
01:11:13,171 --> 01:11:17,550
by producing the sense of engagement and
meaning.

1264
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:22,490
So let's say there's a place in the 
environment you should be okay,

1265
01:11:22,620 --> 01:11:24,360
what should that place be?
Well,

1266
01:11:24,361 --> 01:11:26,400
you don't want to be terrified out of 
your skull.

1267
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,890
Like what good is that?
And you know,

1268
01:11:28,891 --> 01:11:32,520
you don't want to be so comfortable that
you might as well sleep.

1269
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:38,030
You want to be somewhere where you know 
you're kind of on firm ground here,

1270
01:11:38,161 --> 01:11:38,994
but over here you're kind of testing out
new territory and some of you who were 

1271
01:11:43,441 --> 01:11:44,274
exploratory and emotionally stable,
you know you're going to go pretty far 

1272
01:11:47,341 --> 01:11:51,270
out into the unexplored territory 
without destabilizing yourself.

1273
01:11:51,271 --> 01:11:52,104
And other people are gonna.
Just put a toe in the chaos and you 

1274
01:11:55,261 --> 01:11:57,960
know,
that's neuroticism basically,

1275
01:11:57,970 --> 01:11:58,803
that's your sensitivity to threat,
that's calibrated differently in 

1276
01:12:01,381 --> 01:12:04,710
different people and some people are 
more exploratory than others.

1277
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:08,230
That's kind of extraversion and openness
working together and,

1278
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,073
and intelligence.
So some people are going to tolerate a 

1279
01:12:12,271 --> 01:12:15,090
larger admixture of chaos in their 
order.

1280
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,340
Those are liberals by the way.
And,

1281
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:18,293
and I mean that technically liberals are
more interested in novel chaos and 

1282
01:12:24,031 --> 01:12:24,864
conservatives are more interested in the
stabilization of the structures that 

1283
01:12:28,111 --> 01:12:30,810
already exist and who's right?

1284
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:32,123
Well,
it depends on the situation and that's 

1285
01:12:34,171 --> 01:12:35,004
why conservatives and liberals have to 
talk to each other because one of them 

1286
01:12:38,491 --> 01:12:39,324
isn't right and the other wrong.
Sometimes the conservatives are right 

1287
01:12:42,961 --> 01:12:43,794
and sometimes the liberals are right 
because the environment's going like 

1288
01:12:46,441 --> 01:12:48,180
this,
he can't predict the damn thing.

1289
01:12:48,181 --> 01:12:52,470
So that's why you have to communicate.
And that's what a democracy does,

1290
01:12:52,471 --> 01:12:53,304
is it allows people of different 
temperamental types to communicate and 

1291
01:12:55,741 --> 01:12:59,970
to calibrate the damn societies.
So anyways,

1292
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:03,150
so let's say you're optimally balanced 
between chaos and order.

1293
01:13:03,151 --> 01:13:04,830
So what does that mean?
Well,

1294
01:13:05,220 --> 01:13:08,820
you're stable enough but you're 
interested,

1295
01:13:08,970 --> 01:13:09,803
right?
Because a little novelty heightens your 

1296
01:13:12,241 --> 01:13:15,900
anxiety that wakes you up a bit.
That's the adventure part of it,

1297
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:20,640
but it also focuses the part of your 
brain that does exploratory activity and

1298
01:13:20,641 --> 01:13:22,620
that's actually associated with 
pleasure.

1299
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:23,483
That's the dopamine circuit.
And so if you're optimally balanced and 

1300
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:28,103
you know that you know you're there when
you're listening to an interesting 

1301
01:13:30,061 --> 01:13:33,660
conversation or you're engaged in one,
it's a real conversation.

1302
01:13:33,930 --> 01:13:36,990
You know you're saying some things you 
know and the other person is saying some

1303
01:13:36,991 --> 01:13:37,824
things they know,
but the both of what you know is 

1304
01:13:41,311 --> 01:13:42,810
changing.
It's like,

1305
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:44,160
wow,
that's so interesting.

1306
01:13:44,161 --> 01:13:45,920
You'll have a conversation like that 
forever.

1307
01:13:45,921 --> 01:13:47,340
Or maybe you're reading a book like 
that,

1308
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:52,670
or you're listening to a piece of music 
that models that because what music does

1309
01:13:53,131 --> 01:13:53,964
is provide you with predictable forms,
multilevel predictable forms that 

1310
01:13:58,171 --> 01:13:59,004
transform just the right amount.
And so music is a very representational 

1311
01:14:03,031 --> 01:14:04,050
art form.
It says,

1312
01:14:04,051 --> 01:14:06,330
this is what the universe is like.
You know,

1313
01:14:06,331 --> 01:14:11,331
there's a dancing element to it.
Repetitive and then cute variations that

1314
01:14:12,161 --> 01:14:14,890
sort of surprise and delight you and,
and you think,

1315
01:14:14,891 --> 01:14:18,010
wow,
that's so cool and it doesn't matter how

1316
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,053
nihilistic you are.
Music still inside infuses you with a 

1317
01:14:22,631 --> 01:14:23,464
sense of meaning and that's because it 
models meaning that's what it does is 

1318
01:14:26,201 --> 01:14:27,034
that's why we love it and you know,
you could dance to it and that sort of 

1319
01:14:29,711 --> 01:14:30,544
symbolizes you putting yourself in 
harmony with these multiple poll layers 

1320
01:14:34,601 --> 01:14:39,601
of reality and positioning yourself 
properly and you like that too.

1321
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:41,680
You know,
you'll pay for it.

1322
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:43,420
Oh boy,
I get to go dancing,

1323
01:14:43,421 --> 01:14:44,380
you know?
Oh boy.

1324
01:14:44,381 --> 01:14:46,690
I get to listen to music.
Like what the hell are you doing?

1325
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:48,940
Listening to music.
What good is that?

1326
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,370
Well,
you think that's a stupid question.

1327
01:14:51,371 --> 01:14:54,520
I don't care about your dopey criticism.
I'm going to listen to some music,

1328
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,620
right?
There's no rational.

1329
01:14:57,370 --> 01:14:59,470
There's no rational argument against 
music.

1330
01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:02,550
It's like you just don't even think 
about him.

1331
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:07,000
He just walk away from someone who's 
stupid enough to ask that question.

1332
01:15:07,001 --> 01:15:11,110
It's like
some things are obvious.

1333
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:15,310
Well
why?

1334
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:17,410
Okay,
so that's pretty fun.

1335
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:22,120
So what mediates between these two 
domains?

1336
01:15:22,121 --> 01:15:25,120
While that's what consciousness does,
far as I can tell,

1337
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:27,910
and that sort of the individual,
and that's the hero,

1338
01:15:27,911 --> 01:15:30,700
that's another way of thinking about it.
It's the logos.

1339
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:32,103
That's another way of thinking about it.
It's the word that generates order out 

1340
01:15:36,191 --> 01:15:38,110
of chaos at the beginning of time.

1341
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:39,273
It's the consciousness that interacting 
with the matter of the world produces 

1342
01:15:43,361 --> 01:15:45,160
being.
That's basically it.

1343
01:15:45,161 --> 01:15:47,860
That's basically you for all intents and
purposes.

1344
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:52,060
Um,
how do you do that?

1345
01:15:52,061 --> 01:15:54,100
Well,
the unconscious does it to some degree,

1346
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:54,963
you know,
because it's with our fantasy that we 

1347
01:15:57,191 --> 01:15:59,320
first meet the unknown,
right?

1348
01:15:59,650 --> 01:16:00,340
Well,
look,

1349
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:03,100
say you're going out with a new person.
It's like what do you do?

1350
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:04,413
You project a fantasy on them and then 
you fall in love with the fantasy and 

1351
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:08,643
aren't used stupid because you're going 
to find out that the match between your 

1352
01:16:12,461 --> 01:16:16,360
damn fantasy in the actual person is 
tenuous at best.

1353
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:17,553
And so young would call that a
projection of either the anima or the 

1354
01:16:22,211 --> 01:16:23,044
animus.
The Anima is what a man projects onto a 

1355
01:16:25,361 --> 01:16:26,980
woman he finds desirable.
It's like,

1356
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:28,480
oh,
she's the perfect woman.

1357
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:29,620
It's like,
well,

1358
01:16:29,650 --> 01:16:32,770
how do you know that you've like seen 
her for four seconds,

1359
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:33,883
you know,
but it grips you and the same thing 

1360
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:38,590
happens in the opposite direction and 
it's an action of instinct.

1361
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:39,423
You know?
It's like you fall in love with the 

1362
01:16:40,781 --> 01:16:44,890
image and but interestingly enough,
what you do in a relationship that works

1363
01:16:44,891 --> 01:16:45,724
is that you actually,
I think that what you see a rough 

1364
01:16:49,331 --> 01:16:52,960
approximation when you project the ideal
and fall in love with it,

1365
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:57,160
you see what could be.
It could be that,

1366
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:01,540
but it's going to take a hell of a lot 
of work because like you got no shortage

1367
01:17:01,541 --> 01:17:05,860
of flaws and the other person has no 
shortage of flaws and so you're bringing

1368
01:17:05,861 --> 01:17:06,694
your flaws together and that's going to 
produce a lot of and you're going to 

1369
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:11,113
have to engage in a lot of dialogue 
before you approach that level of 

1370
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,000
perfection again.
But

1371
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:22,130
maybe you can do it.
Then you get to live happily ever after.

1372
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:23,570
Well,
wouldn't that be nice?

1373
01:17:24,350 --> 01:17:27,480
Well,
so the unconscious meets the unknown and

1374
01:17:27,481 --> 01:17:31,460
if it meets it with imagination and 
fantasy and dream and art,

1375
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:33,560
that's how you take.

1376
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:34,513
So you don't just go from what you don't
know to fully articulated knowledge and 

1377
01:17:37,941 --> 01:17:40,460
one bloody leap.
You can't do that.

1378
01:17:40,461 --> 01:17:45,461
You have to extend pseudopods of fantasy
and imagination into the unknown.

1379
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,290
That's kind of what theorizing is like,
right?

1380
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:49,910
Even scientifically,
you know,

1381
01:17:49,911 --> 01:17:52,490
you don't know something scientifically,
you generate a theory.

1382
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:53,593
Well,
it's an imaginative representation that 

1383
01:17:55,700 --> 01:17:56,533
you're unconscious is helping you 
generate and so you meet the unknown 

1384
01:17:59,751 --> 01:18:02,000
with fantasy.
That's what the unconscious is for.

1385
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:05,570
From the psychoanalytic perspective.
That's what dreams do.

1386
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:08,180
And you can see why you dream about the 
future.

1387
01:18:08,900 --> 01:18:09,620
You know,
it's like,

1388
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:10,850
well,
what's the future going to be like,

1389
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:11,713
wow,
you have a little imaginative story 

1390
01:18:12,531 --> 01:18:15,950
going on and it's like you don't really 
create it and it sort of,

1391
01:18:15,951 --> 01:18:17,720
you watch it unfold,
you know,

1392
01:18:17,721 --> 01:18:18,554
maybe you can tweak it here and there,
but it sort of comes to you from 

1393
01:18:21,740 --> 01:18:24,200
wherever the hell things like that come 
from.

1394
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:26,270
You know,
the unconscious,

1395
01:18:26,271 --> 01:18:27,104
that's the psychoanalytic answer.
It's not really much of an answer 

1396
01:18:30,051 --> 01:18:32,670
because it's more like a representation 
of a,

1397
01:18:32,830 --> 01:18:37,830
of a place that we don't understand,
but that's where creativity comes from.

1398
01:18:38,570 --> 01:18:41,920
And I mean some people are really 
creative right down to the bloody core.

1399
01:18:41,921 --> 01:18:42,754
So in my clinical practice,
I often see people who are high in 

1400
01:18:45,291 --> 01:18:46,124
openness because they're attracted to me
because they watch my lectures and you 

1401
01:18:49,131 --> 01:18:51,680
have to kind of be high in openness to 
like my lectures,

1402
01:18:51,950 --> 01:18:54,770
so because,
well you do because they go everywhere,

1403
01:18:54,771 --> 01:18:55,604
you know,
and they're not necessarily very 

1404
01:18:56,541 --> 01:18:57,380
orderly.
So,

1405
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,600
um,
so anyways,

1406
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:03,320
lots of my clients are really high in 
openness and they're funny people often,

1407
01:19:03,590 --> 01:19:04,423
especially if they're smart because 
sometimes they have the most nihilistic 

1408
01:19:07,191 --> 01:19:08,024
intelligence you can imagine.
It's just self critical and nihilistic 

1409
01:19:11,421 --> 01:19:15,110
and brutally brutal man and smart.

1410
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:18,440
And so they just criticize themselves 
out of existence.

1411
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:19,483
And so often I have to just try to get 
them to quit listening to their 

1412
01:19:23,421 --> 01:19:27,800
chattering raw self critical rationality
and go out and create something,

1413
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:30,020
you know,
with their massive creativity.

1414
01:19:30,021 --> 01:19:30,854
And as long as they're doing that,
they're engaged in the world and happy 

1415
01:19:33,561 --> 01:19:34,394
as hell.
But as soon as that self critical 

1416
01:19:35,721 --> 01:19:38,300
rationality comes in and shuts down the 
creativity,

1417
01:19:38,301 --> 01:19:40,880
they're just there just like walking 
corpses,

1418
01:19:40,900 --> 01:19:41,733
you know,
and it's because if you're really open 

1419
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:48,140
like that's you're a tree and it has 
some trunks and you know,

1420
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:49,093
your,
your most prominent trait is the most 

1421
01:19:50,601 --> 01:19:51,434
lively trunk.
And if you're a creative person and 

1422
01:19:53,061 --> 01:19:55,880
you're not engaging in a creative 
enterprise,

1423
01:19:56,300 --> 01:19:59,060
you're just,
you're like a tree that has been,

1424
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:04,160
that has had its vitality amputated.
And so this is not trivial.

1425
01:20:04,161 --> 01:20:04,994
This stuff is.

1426
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:09,450
This is deeply,
deeply rooted in your biology.

1427
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:13,150
And,
and those are people often who have like

1428
01:20:13,230 --> 01:20:14,940
dream lives.
You just can't believe.

1429
01:20:14,941 --> 01:20:15,774
I have one client,
he has like four spectacular dreams a 

1430
01:20:18,901 --> 01:20:19,734
week.
And most of the time we just spend 

1431
01:20:20,641 --> 01:20:22,140
discussing them.
I mean God,

1432
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:27,090
he and I had another client who could be
lucid in her dreams,

1433
01:20:27,091 --> 01:20:27,924
which is more common among women.
She could ask the damn characters what 

1434
01:20:30,631 --> 01:20:32,760
they represented and they would tell 
her.

1435
01:20:32,761 --> 01:20:34,230
It was like,
okay,

1436
01:20:34,231 --> 01:20:35,064
that was pretty weird.
And like a lot of the things they told 

1437
01:20:36,901 --> 01:20:41,010
her were really helpful and they were 
not things that she wanted to hear.

1438
01:20:41,310 --> 01:20:43,350
She,
she basically,

1439
01:20:43,770 --> 01:20:45,990
one of them told her she,
if she was going to live,

1440
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:47,333
she'd have to go visit a slaughterhouse.
And the reason for that was because she 

1441
01:20:51,541 --> 01:20:52,374
was raised as a little princess and 
protected from horrible mother nature 

1442
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:57,173
until she hit puberty,
in which time she turned into an evil 

1443
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:01,250
villain because that's how the family 
work.

1444
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:05,580
Perfect child evil teenager overnight.
And then,

1445
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:07,193
well that was hard on her and she wasn't
prepared because she thought the world 

1446
01:21:09,571 --> 01:21:14,160
was princess world and she couldn't go 
through a butcher store without having a

1447
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:15,960
fifth and no wonder,
you know,

1448
01:21:15,961 --> 01:21:17,580
like really Jesus,
you know,

1449
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:20,190
it's no wonder,
but you do it.

1450
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:21,653
But she couldn't.
So we used to go to butcher stores and 

1451
01:21:23,490 --> 01:21:24,830
that would make her cry.
And,

1452
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:27,990
and um,
she was a vegetarian that would make her

1453
01:21:27,991 --> 01:21:30,990
cry and you know,
be mon the cruelty of the world.

1454
01:21:30,991 --> 01:21:31,771
And it's like,
yeah,

1455
01:21:31,771 --> 01:21:32,790
fair enough,
man.

1456
01:21:32,791 --> 01:21:34,680
Those are bloody slabs of meat.
It's like,

1457
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:35,723
I don't know why everyone isn't 
screaming when they walked through the 

1458
01:21:37,501 --> 01:21:38,970
butcher store,
but,

1459
01:21:39,660 --> 01:21:40,493
but you got to get used to it band 
because you can't live in the world 

1460
01:21:42,841 --> 01:21:43,674
otherwise,
and so the dream character who was a 

1461
01:21:45,691 --> 01:21:46,524
gypsy told her that she had to go visit 
a slaughterhouse which seemed rather 

1462
01:21:49,771 --> 01:21:50,604
impractical and so I asked her if she 
could think of anything else to do and 

1463
01:21:54,211 --> 01:21:55,080
she thought,
well,

1464
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:58,650
why don't we go visit a funeral home and
and watch an embalming?

1465
01:21:58,680 --> 01:21:59,970
And I thought,
oh good,

1466
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:01,043
that sounds,
that sounds like a fun way to spend a 

1467
01:22:03,271 --> 01:22:06,600
day.
And so I phoned up a funeral parlor

1468
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:10,183
and I said I declined.
It was terrified of death now and I was 

1469
01:22:12,711 --> 01:22:17,711
a therapist who is also a little shaky 
on the concept myself and so they,

1470
01:22:18,330 --> 01:22:21,480
they had no problem with that.
They deal with death all the time,

1471
01:22:21,481 --> 01:22:22,980
which is really something to think 
about,

1472
01:22:22,981 --> 01:22:23,814
right?
A human being can actually have an 

1473
01:22:25,081 --> 01:22:25,914
occupation where they do nothing but 
deal with death and they don't go stark 

1474
01:22:30,181 --> 01:22:31,320
raving mad.
It's like,

1475
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:32,154
what the hell is up with that?
It's like working in a palliative care 

1476
01:22:34,411 --> 01:22:35,244
ward where your,
your clients that you have a 

1477
01:22:37,201 --> 01:22:38,034
relationship,
all they're going to do is die this 

1478
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:41,011
week,
next week,

1479
01:22:41,011 --> 01:22:43,230
the week after.
People do that.

1480
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:47,100
It's like those people are tough man.
They're tough.

1481
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:50,190
So anyways,
we went and watched this embalming,

1482
01:22:50,191 --> 01:22:51,024
which was,
I have a rather high level of disgust 

1483
01:22:53,851 --> 01:22:54,510
sensitivity.

1484
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:55,343
So it,
it was a little on the rough side for 

1485
01:22:57,751 --> 01:23:01,020
me,
but she sat there and first,

1486
01:23:01,021 --> 01:23:03,510
well she was not.
We were outside this little room.

1487
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:04,344
She was not looking at that know away 
and she'd kind of go like this and you 

1488
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:08,860
know,
that was pretty good.

1489
01:23:08,861 --> 01:23:09,694
And then she'd go like this and then she
go like this and then then she watched 

1490
01:23:14,771 --> 01:23:15,604
it and then she asked if she could go in
and she put on a glove and she touched 

1491
01:23:19,691 --> 01:23:20,524
the body and she didn't have a fit.
She didn't have a panic attack and so 

1492
01:23:24,371 --> 01:23:25,204
she walked away from their learning that
there was a hell of a lot more to her 

1493
01:23:28,211 --> 01:23:29,044
than she thought there was and that she 
could see things that she didn't think 

1494
01:23:31,091 --> 01:23:32,860
she could see.
And live,

1495
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:35,200
and after that she sort of had a 
touchstone.

1496
01:23:35,201 --> 01:23:36,460
It's like,
well,

1497
01:23:36,461 --> 01:23:37,690
I'm kind of afraid of this.

1498
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:39,880
Was it as bad as going to see the 
bombing?

1499
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:41,350
No,
it's not that bad.

1500
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:42,880
Well,
I guess I can do it.

1501
01:23:42,910 --> 01:23:44,320
It's like an initiation,
right?

1502
01:23:44,321 --> 01:23:47,170
She had an initiation and so did I,
you know,

1503
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:48,453
and I learned a lot from doing that.
I learned that one of the things you 

1504
01:23:51,311 --> 01:23:52,144
need to do if you're going to be a human
being is to prepare yourself to be 

1505
01:23:54,791 --> 01:23:58,810
useful in the face of death.
And so when you have a parent that dies,

1506
01:23:58,990 --> 01:24:03,070
which shatters people's ideas,
often they can't even think about it.

1507
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:05,770
If you can't even think about that,
man,

1508
01:24:05,771 --> 01:24:06,604
you've got some thinking to do because 
you need to be able to at least think 

1509
01:24:10,421 --> 01:24:14,680
about that because otherwise you're just
going to be a wasteland when it happens.

1510
01:24:14,950 --> 01:24:17,320
And you never know.
You could even have a higher ambition.

1511
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:20,410
Maybe you could even be useful when it 
happens.

1512
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:21,513
Instead of being part of the heap of 
destroyed people who also have to be 

1513
01:24:24,641 --> 01:24:26,350
taken care of,
you know?

1514
01:24:26,351 --> 01:24:27,184
And that's brutal.
You have to be brutal to be useful in 

1515
01:24:30,521 --> 01:24:32,440
the aftermath of your parents' death.
You know,

1516
01:24:32,441 --> 01:24:37,060
you don't get to crumble and fall apart 
and knowing you have every reason to,

1517
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:41,680
so you've got to be kind of some tough 
monster to manage that,

1518
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:46,480
but you want to be useful in the face of
tragedy or do you want to be pathetic?

1519
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:48,673
Well,

1520
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:54,600
you make your choice so out of the 
unconscious,

1521
01:24:54,601 --> 01:24:56,400
you get ritual,
you get dreams,

1522
01:24:56,401 --> 01:24:58,260
you get drama,
you get stories,

1523
01:24:58,261 --> 01:24:59,094
you could arc.
You get music and that sort of buffers 

1524
01:25:01,111 --> 01:25:01,944
us.
We have our little domain of competence 

1525
01:25:03,871 --> 01:25:04,704
and we're buffered by the domain of 
fantasy and culture and that's really 

1526
01:25:08,131 --> 01:25:09,960
what you learned about when you come to 
university,

1527
01:25:09,961 --> 01:25:10,794
if you're lucky and,
and the professors are smart enough to 

1528
01:25:12,601 --> 01:25:13,434
actually teach you something about 
culture instead of constantly telling 

1529
01:25:16,081 --> 01:25:19,590
you that it's completely reprehensible 
and should be destroyed.

1530
01:25:19,591 --> 01:25:23,430
It's like why you would prefer chaos to 
order is beyond me.

1531
01:25:23,431 --> 01:25:24,264
And the only possible reason is that you
haven't read enough history to 

1532
01:25:27,691 --> 01:25:31,740
understand exactly what chaos means.
And believe me,

1533
01:25:31,890 --> 01:25:32,723
if you understood what it means,
you'd be pretty God damn careful about 

1534
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:36,953
tearing down the temple that you live it
unless you want to be at Denison of 

1535
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:42,293
chaos.

1536
01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:44,400
And some people do,
you know,

1537
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:45,293
because that's when the impulses that 
you harbor can really come out and 

1538
01:25:48,001 --> 01:25:48,834
shine.
And so a little gratitude is in order 

1539
01:25:51,451 --> 01:25:55,560
and that makes you appreciative of the 
wise king.

1540
01:25:55,561 --> 01:25:58,950
Well being smart enough to know that 
he's also an evil tyrant.

1541
01:25:59,390 --> 01:26:02,790
It's like that's,
that's a total conception of the world.

1542
01:26:02,791 --> 01:26:04,040
It's balanced.
It's like,

1543
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:05,660
yeah,
we should preserve nature,

1544
01:26:05,661 --> 01:26:08,180
but good God,
it is trying to kill us.

1545
01:26:08,181 --> 01:26:09,920
And you know,
yes,

1546
01:26:09,921 --> 01:26:12,470
our culture is tyrannical and oppresses 
people,

1547
01:26:12,471 --> 01:26:16,370
but it is protecting us from dying.
That's helpful.

1548
01:26:16,550 --> 01:26:19,310
You know,
and yes we're reasonably good people but

1549
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:20,413
like don't take that theory too far 
until you've tested yourself and you 

1550
01:26:24,201 --> 01:26:25,940
know,
that's wisdom at least in part.

1551
01:26:25,941 --> 01:26:28,670
And that's what these stories try to 
teach you.

1552
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:35,750
There is a nice mythological 
representation.

1553
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:36,673
I love this one.
It's like the dome of the known and the 

1554
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:42,260
seeker looking outside,
you know,

1555
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:45,910
that's a metaphysical representation,
you know,

1556
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:47,990
and that is the world is,
it looks to us,

1557
01:26:47,991 --> 01:26:48,824
right?
You go out in the field and it looks 

1558
01:26:49,431 --> 01:26:52,460
like there's a dome covering it.
It's a circle,

1559
01:26:52,461 --> 01:26:53,294
a big circle with a dome over it.
And you know what's outside the Dome 

1560
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:57,590
while the unknown,
right?

1561
01:26:57,591 --> 01:27:00,210
That's where heaven is theoretically,
you know,

1562
01:27:00,211 --> 01:27:03,020
it's a projection.
Obviously heaven is in the unknown.

1563
01:27:03,021 --> 01:27:05,000
Well,
it was localized in space.

1564
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:08,150
I suppose that's partly because when 
people looked up in the sky,

1565
01:27:08,151 --> 01:27:12,800
they were overwhelmed with all.
So it's a reasonable conclusion.

1566
01:27:13,710 --> 01:27:14,543
It,

1567
01:27:15,310 --> 01:27:18,550
it's a projection of an unconscious 
presupposition.

1568
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:21,160
It's a projection of fantasy,
you know,

1569
01:27:21,430 --> 01:27:22,263
heaven is a fantasy and,
and I'm not denigrating fantasy by the 

1570
01:27:25,781 --> 01:27:26,614
way,
and it's projected imaginatively onto 

1571
01:27:28,691 --> 01:27:29,524
the sky.
And that's part of the way you discover 

1572
01:27:30,941 --> 01:27:33,460
what's in your fantasy.
Well,

1573
01:27:33,461 --> 01:27:34,450
this is us,
man.

1574
01:27:34,451 --> 01:27:36,860
We mediate between chaos and order and 
you know,

1575
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:40,090
those are the two archetypal 
representations fundamentally,

1576
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:41,553
you know,
um,

1577
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:45,430
and I think they apply to both genders.
You know,

1578
01:27:45,431 --> 01:27:46,264
like women can act as the individual who
holds the world on his or her shoulders 

1579
01:27:53,141 --> 01:27:55,570
and males.
Men can play a maternal role,

1580
01:27:55,571 --> 01:27:56,870
you know,
feet,

1581
01:27:58,300 --> 01:27:59,133
female,
human beings are quite masculine and 

1582
01:28:00,791 --> 01:28:03,130
male.
Human beings are quite feminine and so,

1583
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:04,313
you know,
maybe maybe this archetype dominates 

1584
01:28:06,221 --> 01:28:08,800
among men in that archetype dominates 
among women,

1585
01:28:08,801 --> 01:28:12,700
which I would say is that is the case as
far as I'm concerned,

1586
01:28:12,701 --> 01:28:14,910
although they're in our individual 
conceptions,

1587
01:28:15,190 --> 01:28:17,530
of course those two things have to work 
in conjunction,

1588
01:28:17,531 --> 01:28:18,364
but that's you,
the eternal mediator between chaos and 

1589
01:28:21,791 --> 01:28:25,720
order,
which also has its enemy.

1590
01:28:25,721 --> 01:28:27,940
So that's,
that's horace there.

1591
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:34,520
And that seth who's eventually turns 
into Satan as the,

1592
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:37,200
as the west progresses,
so to speak,

1593
01:28:37,201 --> 01:28:38,034
and that's represented there as well.
The temptations of I would say 

1594
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:46,590
resentment and hatred,
which everyone has to fight with all the

1595
01:28:46,591 --> 01:28:47,424
time.

1596
01:28:49,010 --> 01:28:50,500
Alright.
Initiations.

1597
01:28:51,070 --> 01:28:53,500
So this is cool.
This is a standard hero story.

1598
01:28:53,501 --> 01:28:57,130
And initiate initiatory rights are a 
part of human heritage.

1599
01:28:57,131 --> 01:28:59,770
And so let's take a look.
This is from Eliana.

1600
01:29:00,010 --> 01:29:04,070
I would like even now stress the fact 
that the psychopathology of the romantic

1601
01:29:04,110 --> 01:29:04,943
vocation is not profane,
it does not belong to ordinary 

1602
01:29:07,951 --> 01:29:10,200
symptomatology.
It's not mental illness,

1603
01:29:10,530 --> 01:29:13,470
it has an ent initiatory structure and 
signification.

1604
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:14,573
In short,
it reproduces a traditional mystical 

1605
01:29:16,321 --> 01:29:17,154
pattern.
The total crisis of the future Sharman 

1606
01:29:19,410 --> 01:29:22,610
sometimes leading to complete 
disintegration of the personality and to

1607
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:26,370
madness can be evaluated not only as an 
initiatory death,

1608
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:27,713
but also as a symbolic return to the pre
cosmogony chaos to the amorphous and 

1609
01:29:32,101 --> 01:29:35,250
indescribable state that precedes any 
cosmogony.

1610
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:36,113
While what he means by that is that I 
suppose the mythological view of the 

1611
01:29:39,931 --> 01:29:40,764
emergence of order that's a cosmogony is
that there's a state of potential and 

1612
01:29:45,301 --> 01:29:47,970
chaos out of which order emerges.

1613
01:29:47,970 --> 01:29:48,930
And I,
you know,

1614
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:52,500
here's,
here's how it is that you think that way

1615
01:29:52,501 --> 01:29:54,990
because you do think that way.
So you know,

1616
01:29:54,991 --> 01:29:57,930
imagine what you're facing when you're 
facing the future,

1617
01:29:58,560 --> 01:29:59,700
right?
While you might say,

1618
01:29:59,701 --> 01:30:01,350
well,
the future is full of potential,

1619
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:03,060
right?
It's full of potential.

1620
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:05,340
What the hell does that mean?
You know,

1621
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:06,533
you act as if that you act as if that 
potential is really a real thing and 

1622
01:30:10,681 --> 01:30:11,514
you're confronting it all the time.
I'm confronting the potential of the 

1623
01:30:13,651 --> 01:30:14,700
future.
Well,

1624
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:15,534
it doesn't exist yet,
so what you're confronting doesn't even 

1625
01:30:18,991 --> 01:30:19,824
really exist.
What you're conceptualizing doesn't 

1626
01:30:21,121 --> 01:30:21,954
really exist and in some sense you bring
it into being by plotting your path 

1627
01:30:25,741 --> 01:30:26,574
through it,
while the pre cosmo going to chaos is 

1628
01:30:28,651 --> 01:30:32,100
the same as the potential of the future,
it's exactly the same idea.

1629
01:30:32,370 --> 01:30:37,370
It's the realm of possibility from which
actuality emerges and you participate in

1630
01:30:39,450 --> 01:30:42,270
turning that possibility into actuality.

1631
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:44,790
That's what you're doing all the time.
Now,

1632
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:47,550
can I explain that?
Well,

1633
01:30:47,551 --> 01:30:51,660
no.
I have no idea how consciousness and the

1634
01:30:51,661 --> 01:30:56,661
substrate of the world interact.
I can only say that that's how it looks.

1635
01:30:57,240 --> 01:30:58,970
That's how it feels.
You know,

1636
01:30:59,160 --> 01:30:59,993
that's how people act and they'll get 
into trouble if they don't manifest 

1637
01:31:03,901 --> 01:31:06,180
their potential,
whatever that is.

1638
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:09,260
That's all those things you could be 
that you're not well,

1639
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:11,940
where are those?
It's just potential.

1640
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,980
While that's the chaos,
this is a.

1641
01:31:15,810 --> 01:31:20,760
that's the.
I would say that's the cosmos.

1642
01:31:20,790 --> 01:31:22,890
That's the cosmos that you live in all 
the time.

1643
01:31:22,891 --> 01:31:23,724
It's a little story.
It's the thing that you extract out of 

1644
01:31:25,951 --> 01:31:26,784
the chaos.
It sorta consists of your conception of 

1645
01:31:29,251 --> 01:31:33,630
where you are now and your conception of
where you want to be at some point could

1646
01:31:33,631 --> 01:31:35,880
be 10 minutes,
could be three years it has.

1647
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:36,833
You can slide it and then you have a 
little plan about how you should move 

1648
01:31:40,621 --> 01:31:44,730
your body to transform one into the 
other.

1649
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:45,593
That's your action pattern.
That's a little story and when you ask 

1650
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:48,833
someone to say what they were up to,
they'll tell you a little story like 

1651
01:31:50,971 --> 01:31:51,780
that.
You know,

1652
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:55,590
I was at someplace and I went somewhere 
else and here's how I did it.

1653
01:31:56,020 --> 01:31:57,840
Then they might tell you more 
interesting story,

1654
01:31:57,841 --> 01:32:02,841
which is I was someplace and something 
happened that I really didn't expect and

1655
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:08,170
it knocked me for a loop,
you know,

1656
01:32:08,650 --> 01:32:09,483
and that's a good divorce story.
I came home one night and my wife was 

1657
01:32:12,701 --> 01:32:13,690
gone.
It's like,

1658
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:15,093
yeah,
chaos and probably a bit of willful 

1659
01:32:17,771 --> 01:32:22,480
blindness proceeding it.
We might suspect anyways down into chaos

1660
01:32:22,481 --> 01:32:23,314
and then,
well maybe you learn something down 

1661
01:32:24,611 --> 01:32:25,444
there and maybe you don't,
but hopefully you do and you put 

1662
01:32:27,341 --> 01:32:30,760
yourself together if you're lucky,
and then pop bang,

1663
01:32:30,761 --> 01:32:31,594
you pop up into another little structure
of order and that's an initiatory 

1664
01:32:34,631 --> 01:32:35,260
process.

1665
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:38,710
It's like you're somewhere stable,
falls apart,

1666
01:32:38,830 --> 01:32:42,400
or maybe you break it apart on purpose.
You do it voluntarily.

1667
01:32:42,460 --> 01:32:46,240
You know people do that all the time.
You know they do that.

1668
01:32:46,241 --> 01:32:48,550
For example,
when they experiment with drugs and they

1669
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:49,593
do that when they go on wild adventures 
and you know when they break themselves 

1670
01:32:52,541 --> 01:32:56,260
out of their normal routine and throw 
themselves somewhere,

1671
01:32:56,261 --> 01:33:00,160
they don't understand and hope that 
that's going to produce a transformation

1672
01:33:00,161 --> 01:33:02,350
of personality.
That's the basic story.

1673
01:33:02,351 --> 01:33:04,510
That's the initiatory story.
Now,

1674
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:05,673
this is William James who was the one of
the established rules of modern 

1675
01:33:08,981 --> 01:33:09,814
psychology and I kind of an odd guy.
He was an early experimenter with 

1676
01:33:13,001 --> 01:33:14,140
psychedelics.
Of course,

1677
01:33:14,141 --> 01:33:17,080
they'll never tell you that,
but he was and he has.

1678
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:21,910
His drug of choice was nitrous oxide,
which is an inhalent gas,

1679
01:33:21,911 --> 01:33:25,090
which seems to be inert.
No one really knows why it works,

1680
01:33:25,091 --> 01:33:29,920
but it produces quite intense,
a hallucinogenic experience,

1681
01:33:29,921 --> 01:33:30,970
mystical experience.

1682
01:33:31,150 --> 01:33:34,120
Although if you breathe too much of it,
then you die because it doesn't.

1683
01:33:34,240 --> 01:33:35,920
It doesn't have any oxygen in it,
so,

1684
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:38,110
so don't do that.
And,

1685
01:33:38,210 --> 01:33:42,190
and he wrote some really bad hippie 
poetry back in the 18 eighties.

1686
01:33:42,370 --> 01:33:43,300
Well,
he was,

1687
01:33:44,210 --> 01:33:45,820
you know,
experimenting with,

1688
01:33:46,330 --> 01:33:48,700
with nitrous oxide is.
I'll read a little bit of that too.

1689
01:33:48,701 --> 01:33:49,534
You pure experiences.
The name which I give to the original 

1690
01:33:52,601 --> 01:33:55,930
flux of life before reflection has 
categorized it.

1691
01:33:57,340 --> 01:34:00,310
Only newborn Babes and persons in semi 
coma from sleep,

1692
01:34:00,311 --> 01:34:01,144
drugs,
illnesses or blows can have an 

1693
01:34:02,111 --> 01:34:07,111
experience pure in the literal sense of,
of that which is not yet any definite,

1694
01:34:07,271 --> 01:34:12,271
what they'll ready to be,
any sorts of what's fourth full,

1695
01:34:12,731 --> 01:34:13,564
both of oneness and of many dentists,
but in respects that don't appear 

1696
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:20,560
changing throughout yet.
So confusedly that it's phases,

1697
01:34:20,561 --> 01:34:21,394
interpenetrate and no points either of 
distinction or of identity can be 

1698
01:34:25,061 --> 01:34:25,894
caught.

1699
01:34:26,140 --> 01:34:26,741
Nineteen.
Oh,

1700
01:34:26,741 --> 01:34:29,260
five William James,
Journal of Philosophy.

1701
01:34:29,710 --> 01:34:32,710
You know,
a lot of these old guys that established

1702
01:34:33,010 --> 01:34:33,843
what we regard as fairly stable bodies 
of knowledge were just as crazy as you 

1703
01:34:38,411 --> 01:34:39,244
can possibly imagine.
They're just the most peculiar damn 

1704
01:34:41,651 --> 01:34:44,240
people and they get sanitized,
you know,

1705
01:34:44,530 --> 01:34:45,363
as,
as they are represented in history and 

1706
01:34:46,901 --> 01:34:48,820
that's no fun.
You know?

1707
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:49,683
I mean,
it's much more interesting to know what 

1708
01:34:51,041 --> 01:34:51,874
they were like.
They were just so bloody peculiar and 

1709
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:58,040
strange and involved in all sorts of 
weird things.

1710
01:34:58,041 --> 01:35:00,680
It's a lot more fun to know that.
Here's his poem.

1711
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:04,970
Wow.
Like right from 1968,

1712
01:35:06,050 --> 01:35:09,890
no verbiage can give it because the 
verbiage is other incoherent,

1713
01:35:10,130 --> 01:35:11,630
coherent,
same,

1714
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:14,870
and it fades and it's infinite and it's 
infinite.

1715
01:35:15,230 --> 01:35:18,980
Don't you see the difference?
Don't you see the identity constantly?

1716
01:35:18,981 --> 01:35:22,400
Opposites united,
the same me telling you to write and not

1717
01:35:22,401 --> 01:35:24,140
to right?
Extreme,

1718
01:35:24,141 --> 01:35:24,974
extreme,
extreme something and other than that 

1719
01:35:26,961 --> 01:35:27,794
thing,
intoxication and otherness than 

1720
01:35:29,871 --> 01:35:32,540
intoxication.
Every attempt at betterment,

1721
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:37,640
every attempted other month is a.
It fades forever and forever as we move,

1722
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:41,810
it's like it's just about as incoherent 
as postmodernist philosophy.

1723
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:44,953
So we know for archaic and traditional 
cultures that are symbolic return to 

1724
01:35:47,841 --> 01:35:50,690
chaos is equivalent to preparing a new 
creation.

1725
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:54,600
It follows that we may interpret the 
psychic chaos of the future Sharman as a

1726
01:35:54,601 --> 01:35:55,434
sign that the profane man is being 
dissolved and a new personality being 

1727
01:35:58,311 --> 01:36:02,960
prepared for birth transformation.
Here's a way of thinking about it.

1728
01:36:03,110 --> 01:36:06,500
Paradise,
Paradise lost redemption.

1729
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:11,990
Classic story of mankind always.
There was a great past.

1730
01:36:11,991 --> 01:36:14,870
We're in a state of chaos.
We're heading towards a better future.

1731
01:36:15,710 --> 01:36:20,390
Everyone thinks that way.
The stories are based on that all that's

1732
01:36:20,391 --> 01:36:24,440
that.
Now ellenberger who,

1733
01:36:24,470 --> 01:36:25,303
who wrote a lot about the psychoanalysts
believed that Freud and young in 

1734
01:36:28,821 --> 01:36:29,654
particular how to create an illness 
which he regarded as this sort of 

1735
01:36:31,941 --> 01:36:36,941
spontaneous shamonic transformation,
and he said a creative illness has these

1736
01:36:37,521 --> 01:36:38,510
elements.
It follows,

1737
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:39,373
succeeds a period of intense 
preoccupation with an idea and search 

1738
01:36:42,291 --> 01:36:43,250
for certain truth.

1739
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:46,550
It's a polymorphous condition that can 
take the shape of depression,

1740
01:36:46,551 --> 01:36:47,384
neurosis,
psychosomatic ailments or even 

1741
01:36:49,041 --> 01:36:49,874
psychosis.
Young was in that state when he wrote 

1742
01:36:51,561 --> 01:36:54,230
this book called the Red Book,
which was just released last year,

1743
01:36:54,231 --> 01:36:55,064
which is full of visionary illustrations
and and it's very strange poetry and it 

1744
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:01,273
contains the,
the communications he had with 

1745
01:37:05,150 --> 01:37:08,060
imaginative beings that he conjured up 
when,

1746
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:10,340
when practicing,
doing exactly that.

1747
01:37:10,341 --> 01:37:11,174
He practiced that for years and he had 
these autonomous beings manifest 

1748
01:37:15,981 --> 01:37:19,250
themselves in his fantasy and had long 
conversations with them,

1749
01:37:19,251 --> 01:37:20,800
which is,
you know,

1750
01:37:20,810 --> 01:37:23,270
while he was working as a doctor and 
having a sane,

1751
01:37:23,271 --> 01:37:26,840
normal life and well it's Kinda,
well,

1752
01:37:27,170 --> 01:37:29,270
it's really something.
Whatever the symptoms,

1753
01:37:29,271 --> 01:37:30,104
they're felt as painful while he thought
maybe he was going mad and some people 

1754
01:37:33,081 --> 01:37:36,080
think he did,
if not agonizing by the subject,

1755
01:37:36,081 --> 01:37:39,200
with alternating periods of alleviation 
and worsening throughout the illness.

1756
01:37:39,201 --> 01:37:40,034
The subject never loses.
The thread of is dominating 

1757
01:37:41,931 --> 01:37:42,764
preoccupation.
It's often compatible with normal 

1758
01:37:45,531 --> 01:37:46,364
professional activity and family life,
but even if he keeps to his social 

1759
01:37:48,831 --> 01:37:49,664
activities,
he's almost entirely absorbed with 

1760
01:37:53,151 --> 01:37:53,984
himself.
He suffers feelings of isolation even 

1761
01:37:57,031 --> 01:37:57,864
when he has a mentor who guides them 
through the ordeal like the and 

1762
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:01,173
apprentice with his master.
The termination is often rapid and 

1763
01:38:03,451 --> 01:38:07,770
marked by a phase of exhilaration.
The subject emerges from his ordeal with

1764
01:38:07,771 --> 01:38:11,580
a permanent transformation in this 
personality and a conviction that he has

1765
01:38:11,581 --> 01:38:14,460
discovered a great truth or a new 
spiritual world.

1766
01:38:17,710 --> 01:38:18,543
Many of the 19th and 20th century 
figures regarded universally as great 

1767
01:38:22,160 --> 01:38:23,200
niche,
a Darwin,

1768
01:38:23,201 --> 01:38:24,460
Dostoevsky,
tolstoy,

1769
01:38:24,461 --> 01:38:25,294
Freud Young.
We're all additionally characterized by 

1770
01:38:26,861 --> 01:38:30,160
lengthy periods of profound 
psychological unrest and uncertainty.

1771
01:38:30,340 --> 01:38:31,173
Well,
you don't generate a new theory without 

1772
01:38:33,881 --> 01:38:35,440
some birth pangs,
right?

1773
01:38:35,441 --> 01:38:38,500
Because you're all theory has to bite 
the dust first.

1774
01:38:38,501 --> 01:38:40,270
And when you're old theory bites the 
dust.

1775
01:38:40,271 --> 01:38:41,800
It's like,
where are you?

1776
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:42,753
You don't know.
Do you know if you're going to come up 

1777
01:38:44,141 --> 01:38:45,790
with a new one?
No.

1778
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:50,000
Here's a cool thing.
This is my daughter.

1779
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:51,133
She was five years at this point.
She was playing prince or princess with 

1780
01:38:54,141 --> 01:38:56,270
Julia and her three year old.
She said,

1781
01:38:56,271 --> 01:38:57,650
dad,
if we killed the dragon,

1782
01:38:57,651 --> 01:38:59,270
we could use his skin,
his armor.

1783
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:01,310
Wouldn't that be a good idea?
I thought,

1784
01:39:01,311 --> 01:39:01,730
hey,
yeah,

1785
01:39:01,730 --> 01:39:03,160
that's,
that's a hell of an idea,

1786
01:39:03,170 --> 01:39:04,160
kid.
You know,

1787
01:39:04,161 --> 01:39:04,994
you go right after the thing that 
frightens you the most and you develop 

1788
01:39:08,181 --> 01:39:10,070
something that protects you from doing 
that.

1789
01:39:10,100 --> 01:39:12,380
It's like,
where did she get that idea?

1790
01:39:12,530 --> 01:39:14,150
Well,
good work Kiddo.

1791
01:39:14,930 --> 01:39:19,460
She had plenty of dragons in her life,
so

1792
01:39:22,090 --> 01:39:24,520
the following dream was described by my 
daughter Mckayla.

1793
01:39:24,521 --> 01:39:25,810
Three years,
nine months old,

1794
01:39:25,811 --> 01:39:27,700
above my son Julian.
One year,

1795
01:39:28,540 --> 01:39:29,373
Julian was in the process of toilet 
training and rapid speech development 

1796
01:39:31,811 --> 01:39:33,820
was having some trouble controlling his 
emotions.

1797
01:39:33,821 --> 01:39:34,654
MCKAYLA liked to call him baby.
We had several discussions about the 

1798
01:39:37,211 --> 01:39:39,130
fact that he wasn't really a baby 
anymore.

1799
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:41,500
She told me this story while I was at 
the computer,

1800
01:39:41,501 --> 01:39:44,680
so I was able to get it verbatim.
She wasn't very happy with the idea that

1801
01:39:44,681 --> 01:39:46,990
he wasn't a baby anymore because she 
kind of liked her.

1802
01:39:47,050 --> 01:39:47,883
The baby.
She took care of that baby you lot and 

1803
01:39:49,271 --> 01:39:53,350
her little brain was having a hard time 
with the notion that whatever that thing

1804
01:39:53,351 --> 01:39:55,210
is now it isn't a baby.
It's like,

1805
01:39:55,211 --> 01:39:56,260
well,
where's my baby?

1806
01:39:56,261 --> 01:39:57,094
And believe me,
plenty of mothers go through the same 

1807
01:39:58,631 --> 01:40:00,520
thing.
Then they attempt to keep their children

1808
01:40:00,521 --> 01:40:04,900
babies for the rest of their lives,
so this is what Mikayla said,

1809
01:40:04,990 --> 01:40:05,620
the dream.

1810
01:40:05,620 --> 01:40:08,530
Julian's eyes fell out and then he 
falled into pieces.

1811
01:40:08,710 --> 01:40:10,300
I said,
what sort of pieces?

1812
01:40:10,330 --> 01:40:11,163
She said,
Julian pieces and the bones fold out to 

1813
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:15,393
then a whole God,
him and there was water in it and when 

1814
01:40:17,411 --> 01:40:21,370
he came out he was big mom.
Julian isn't a baby anymore.

1815
01:40:21,430 --> 01:40:22,263
No,
he's a big boy and a bug with legs go 

1816
01:40:24,501 --> 01:40:26,620
out.
I'm out cause bugs can swim and the hole

1817
01:40:26,621 --> 01:40:30,070
was in the park and it moved into the 
backyard and he fall into it.

1818
01:40:30,190 --> 01:40:32,770
A tree burned and left the whole.
I thought,

1819
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:34,480
wow,
that's so amazing.

1820
01:40:34,481 --> 01:40:37,960
It's like it was a.
It was a shamanic transformation dream.

1821
01:40:37,961 --> 01:40:42,220
It was like the tree that's the tree of 
life had burnt and left a hole.

1822
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:43,650
The kid fell.
Intuitive,

1823
01:40:43,660 --> 01:40:46,600
dissolved them right down to his bones.
This little bug,

1824
01:40:46,601 --> 01:40:49,870
which would be a union representation of
the self,

1825
01:40:49,871 --> 01:40:51,160
like Jimminy cricket,
by the way,

1826
01:40:51,161 --> 01:40:51,994
in Pinocchio.
The bug was the thing that was alive 

1827
01:40:54,251 --> 01:40:55,870
that helped them through the 
transformation.

1828
01:40:55,871 --> 01:40:56,704
He stepped out and now he was big.
It's like that was her little brain 

1829
01:41:00,100 --> 01:41:02,890
conjuring up the notion of radical 
transformation.

1830
01:41:03,070 --> 01:41:05,620
So this is cool.
I hope this works.

1831
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:10,570
This is a dream that my nephew had.
Someone animated

1832
01:41:11,990 --> 01:41:12,823
Jordan Peterson is a clinical 
psychologist from the University of 

1833
01:41:15,250 --> 01:41:16,083
Toronto.
Do disagree with some of those 

1834
01:41:17,361 --> 01:41:20,570
fundamental ideas.
Put his thoughts and fixing problems.

1835
01:41:20,630 --> 01:41:21,463
Merge with my stomach values
within one of his maps of meaning 

1836
01:41:25,761 --> 01:41:26,594
lectures.
He tells a true story about a four year 

1837
01:41:28,221 --> 01:41:29,054
old boy,
his nephew who for months was suffering 

1838
01:41:31,641 --> 01:41:34,880
from terrible night terrors,
terrors that were waking him up,

1839
01:41:34,881 --> 01:41:37,010
screaming.
This boy,

1840
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:40,100
by the way did have some areas of 
instability in his family life,

1841
01:41:41,210 --> 01:41:44,050
Jordan versus the young boys hosts and 
the boy was running around,

1842
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:46,280
dressed as a need with a sword,
a shield,

1843
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:48,440
and a helmet.
At nighttime,

1844
01:41:48,441 --> 01:41:52,880
he would take a sword and shield to bed.
So Jordan goes back into him and the boy

1845
01:41:52,881 --> 01:41:57,230
described his dream and the dream.
He's standing thrown by me.

1846
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:58,113
Hey dwarves.
These dwarves had beaks and every time 

1847
01:42:01,101 --> 01:42:01,934
you were trying to move the doors would 
jump up and Beta and very fretting 

1848
01:42:05,061 --> 01:42:05,894
scenario for a young boy,
and if you look behind all the doors 

1849
01:42:09,010 --> 01:42:09,790
away in,
up back,

1850
01:42:09,790 --> 01:42:10,623
there was a dragon,
and every time this dragon with puff 

1851
01:42:12,590 --> 01:42:13,423
owed fire and smoke,
more dwarves will be created so there's 

1852
01:42:16,491 --> 01:42:19,240
no point fighting off the doors because 
more would just be made.

1853
01:42:20,480 --> 01:42:23,510
So Jordan tapped him and asked,
what could you do about that?

1854
01:42:24,650 --> 01:42:26,990
So the kid says he could jump up in the 
dragon's head,

1855
01:42:27,590 --> 01:42:30,110
could put a's with a sword,
but he couldn't see.

1856
01:42:31,070 --> 01:42:34,580
Then he could go during the route to the
box where the fire came,

1857
01:42:34,590 --> 01:42:37,100
chrome,
carve a piece out of that box,

1858
01:42:37,620 --> 01:42:40,550
thereby destroying it and use that 
pieces of sheet.

1859
01:42:41,810 --> 01:42:45,890
The change before Jordan a was already 
acting out in life.

1860
01:42:46,070 --> 01:42:46,903
What he knew he had to do,
and after that conversation he had no 

1861
01:42:50,361 --> 01:42:54,410
more nightmares.
This is what Marcus really is meant when

1862
01:42:54,411 --> 01:42:57,920
he said the impediment to action 
advances action.

1863
01:42:58,580 --> 01:42:59,413
What stands in the way becomes a way.
He was telling us that we must not shy 

1864
01:43:03,741 --> 01:43:06,860
away from problems or shutting our 
personal responsibility.

1865
01:43:07,670 --> 01:43:11,330
You must be willing to sacrifice or 
conference who does Roseboro problems to

1866
01:43:11,331 --> 01:43:13,520
solve them and then take something away.

1867
01:43:14,410 --> 01:43:15,370
Well,
there you go.

1868
01:43:16,420 --> 01:43:20,030
So yeah,
he was waking up screaming at night for,

1869
01:43:20,050 --> 01:43:22,030
for weeks,
the night terrors.

1870
01:43:22,031 --> 01:43:22,864
He couldn't really remember what the 
hell was going on and there was 

1871
01:43:25,211 --> 01:43:26,044
instability in his family.
His parents got divorced soon after and 

1872
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:31,960
he was off to kindergarten and that was 
kind of destabilizing them too.

1873
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:35,500
And so it was fun to watch him zip 
around as a night.

1874
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:37,960
It's like,
where do you get that idea?

1875
01:43:37,961 --> 01:43:38,651
Well,
you know,

1876
01:43:38,651 --> 01:43:40,780
he watched TV,
watched movies.

1877
01:43:40,781 --> 01:43:41,614
He is a little imagination.
Was aggregating the picture of the hero 

1878
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:47,590
and then he was trying to act it out.
That's what he was doing,

1879
01:43:47,591 --> 01:43:48,424
pretending right.
I'm pretending to be the thing that 

1880
01:43:50,591 --> 01:43:53,510
takes on the unknown.
And then he has this amazing dream.

1881
01:43:53,511 --> 01:43:56,900
It's like it's mind boggling.
It's so sophisticated.

1882
01:43:56,901 --> 01:43:57,680
It's like,
well,

1883
01:43:57,680 --> 01:44:01,790
here I am and there's troubles 
everywhere and they're biting me.

1884
01:44:01,791 --> 01:44:04,640
They're jumping up on me and it's like a
hydra,

1885
01:44:04,641 --> 01:44:05,720
you know,
in the Hydra,

1886
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:08,240
you cut off a hydros head and seven more
heads grow.

1887
01:44:08,270 --> 01:44:09,530
It's like,
that's life,

1888
01:44:09,531 --> 01:44:10,850
man.
Solve one problem,

1889
01:44:10,880 --> 01:44:12,590
seven more appear.
Right?

1890
01:44:12,670 --> 01:44:16,400
So also that was the dragon at the 
background.

1891
01:44:16,460 --> 01:44:19,130
Chaos itself and chaos kept breeding

1892
01:44:20,940 --> 01:44:23,640
these evil little dwarfs,
which is what it does.

1893
01:44:23,641 --> 01:44:25,740
It's like it's one damn trouble after 
another.

1894
01:44:25,741 --> 01:44:27,270
You fight this one off,
fight this one off.

1895
01:44:27,271 --> 01:44:28,140
It's like,
who cares?

1896
01:44:28,141 --> 01:44:28,974
The Dragon?
The dwarf generating machine is still 

1897
01:44:31,261 --> 01:44:33,130
working in the background.
So He.

1898
01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:36,300
I asked him and that was purposeful.
What could you do?

1899
01:44:37,290 --> 01:44:38,123
See that's a leading question that 
implies that there's something that he 

1900
01:44:41,251 --> 01:44:42,690
could do.
He said,

1901
01:44:42,691 --> 01:44:43,524
well,
I take my dad that was missing in the 

1902
01:44:45,001 --> 01:44:46,840
animation and we'd go,
well,

1903
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:49,020
poke to drag.
It's always out.

1904
01:44:49,021 --> 01:44:51,030
Go right down to the source of the 
problem,

1905
01:44:52,630 --> 01:44:54,220
extinguish it,
make a shield.

1906
01:44:54,221 --> 01:44:55,054
Right?
So that meant that he would have 

1907
01:44:55,961 --> 01:44:58,510
strengthened his character by the 
encounter.

1908
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:00,153
So brilliant.
And then I talked to his mom for months 

1909
01:45:04,081 --> 01:45:07,500
afterwards,
done no more night terrors.

1910
01:45:07,650 --> 01:45:10,450
What had happened.
Yeah,

1911
01:45:10,451 --> 01:45:11,284
identified with the mythological hero.
He identified with St George and the 

1912
01:45:14,111 --> 01:45:14,944
dragon he identified with that little 
bloody tree dwelling primate who 20 

1913
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:23,200
million years ago was the first one to 
drop a stick on a snake.

1914
01:45:23,380 --> 01:45:24,213
He adopted the classic human mode of 
being in the face of uncertainty and 

1915
01:45:28,961 --> 01:45:32,800
construed himself as that which could 
prevail.

1916
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:36,430
End of terrors.
Well,

1917
01:45:40,670 --> 01:45:41,510
I guess we're done a.

1918
01:45:45,030 --> 01:45:45,863
So we're going to do something a little 
different than the syllabus today 

1919
01:45:48,031 --> 01:45:48,864
because we've got this one hour,
two hour problem and I already can't 

1920
01:45:52,681 --> 01:45:53,514
cover constructionism reasonably in two 
hours or one hour that was supposed to 

1921
01:45:57,121 --> 01:45:57,954
be today.
So I'm going to do instead is continue 

1922
01:46:00,630 --> 01:46:01,463
on the line that I've been pursuing,
but I'm going to expand it up more into 

1923
01:46:04,651 --> 01:46:05,484
union psychology,
which is the what we're going after 

1924
01:46:08,011 --> 01:46:08,844
after constructivism anyways.
And so I can weave the constructivism 

1925
01:46:12,511 --> 01:46:13,344
and the depth psychology together and 
it's nice to do that because it gives 

1926
01:46:15,901 --> 01:46:18,600
you a kind of a coherent view.
So just so you know,

1927
01:46:18,601 --> 01:46:20,730
we're,
we're one lecture ahead at the moment,

1928
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:21,593
roughly speaking.
And I'll do constructivism on Tuesday 

1929
01:46:24,540 --> 01:46:25,440
for two hours.
So.

1930
01:46:25,970 --> 01:46:26,803
All right.
So I showed you that enemy animation I 

1931
01:46:28,861 --> 01:46:31,170
told you about my nephew,
his dream,

1932
01:46:31,171 --> 01:46:33,060
which is a remarkable dream,
you know,

1933
01:46:33,061 --> 01:46:34,860
really,
it's just amazing,

1934
01:46:34,861 --> 01:46:39,861
amazing dream and
it's got this archetypal pattern.

1935
01:46:40,570 --> 01:46:44,160
The pattern is that there's a threat and
worse than that,

1936
01:46:44,190 --> 01:46:47,880
that there's,
there are threats and at the back of it,

1937
01:46:47,881 --> 01:46:51,600
there is that the fact of threat itself.
You see,

1938
01:46:51,601 --> 01:46:53,220
so human beings,
we're so smart.

1939
01:46:53,221 --> 01:46:54,054
Hey,
so this is so amazing that we figured 

1940
01:46:56,161 --> 01:46:57,690
this out.
So you imagine,

1941
01:46:57,691 --> 01:47:02,220
well human beings are the only creatures
that can really conceive of the class of

1942
01:47:02,221 --> 01:47:03,054
all threatening things right now.
It's kind of why we can be permanently 

1943
01:47:05,611 --> 01:47:06,720
anxious.
There's.

1944
01:47:06,721 --> 01:47:08,660
So it's sort of annoying.
So you know,

1945
01:47:08,670 --> 01:47:09,503
here you are and it's safe.
There's no lions here or a or anything 

1946
01:47:13,951 --> 01:47:14,784
that might prey on you,
but you can think of something to be 

1947
01:47:18,901 --> 01:47:20,220
anxious about.
No problem.

1948
01:47:20,221 --> 01:47:20,661
You know,
I'm,

1949
01:47:20,661 --> 01:47:21,494
I'm certain you've got some little 
skeleton rattling around in your closet 

1950
01:47:25,081 --> 01:47:27,000
somewhere that's like eating away at 
you.

1951
01:47:27,001 --> 01:47:27,834
And so I think part of the reason we're 
so damn awake human beings is because 

1952
01:47:32,790 --> 01:47:34,130
we're always anxious,
like,

1953
01:47:34,490 --> 01:47:35,323
and you have to be awake when you're 
anxious and the anxiety system actually 

1954
01:47:39,661 --> 01:47:41,880
activates your reticular activating 
system and that,

1955
01:47:42,300 --> 01:47:44,430
that,
that actually produces.

1956
01:47:46,410 --> 01:47:47,243
It's the substrate for consciousness.
If you snap a few fibers in the back of 

1957
01:47:50,101 --> 01:47:50,934
your brain that are part of the 
reticulating activating reticular 

1958
01:47:53,221 --> 01:47:55,190
activating system in a car accident or 
something,

1959
01:47:55,210 --> 01:47:57,630
you'll go into a coma and that'll be 
that you're in,

1960
01:47:57,660 --> 01:48:00,330
you're not getting out of it.
It doesn't take much of an injury either

1961
01:48:00,331 --> 01:48:02,910
in the right place.
So anyways,

1962
01:48:03,240 --> 01:48:07,920
so human beings have been struggling 
with this problem of threat forever.

1963
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:12,450
A really for as long as there's been 
life or at least as long as there's life

1964
01:48:12,451 --> 01:48:14,080
with a nervous system.
And you know,

1965
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:17,040
that's several hundred million years.
It's a long time.

1966
01:48:17,610 --> 01:48:18,443
And of course

1967
01:48:19,980 --> 01:48:21,540
it's easy to,
you know,

1968
01:48:21,630 --> 01:48:24,150
to respond to a particular threat.
Think about zebras,

1969
01:48:24,151 --> 01:48:26,880
they're out there on the belt and 
there's lions everywhere,

1970
01:48:26,881 --> 01:48:28,140
right?
But the zebras are like,

1971
01:48:28,141 --> 01:48:30,360
they're calm because there's lions are 
sleeping.

1972
01:48:30,361 --> 01:48:33,420
And so the zebras don't think 
apparently,

1973
01:48:34,140 --> 01:48:34,973
oh my God,
what was going to happen with those 

1974
01:48:36,631 --> 01:48:39,810
lions wake up because they don't think 
that way.

1975
01:48:39,900 --> 01:48:40,733
You know,
they're not going to be happy if the 

1976
01:48:41,401 --> 01:48:46,020
line goes into a hunting crouch and 
starts it's hunting approach obviously,

1977
01:48:46,021 --> 01:48:46,854
but it's not like the zebras are 
freaking out nonstop because there are 

1978
01:48:50,521 --> 01:48:51,630
lions around,
you know,

1979
01:48:51,631 --> 01:48:55,490
so they can react to specific threats.
But human beings,

1980
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:58,980
partly because we discovered the future,
which was a big mistake,

1981
01:48:59,110 --> 01:49:02,070
it was a big mistake because the future 
is an uncertain place.

1982
01:49:02,850 --> 01:49:04,320
We realized that,
well,

1983
01:49:04,321 --> 01:49:05,154
there isn't any threat right now,
but there might well be some tomorrow 

1984
01:49:07,770 --> 01:49:08,603
and if there isn't some tomorrow,
well maybe next week or next month or 

1985
01:49:10,981 --> 01:49:11,760
next year.

1986
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:14,790
Like it's common.
And so there's danger.

1987
01:49:14,850 --> 01:49:17,190
So it's the category of danger,
you know,

1988
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:21,390
and out of the category of danger 
emerged specific threats.

1989
01:49:21,391 --> 01:49:25,650
And the dragon seems to be a symbol of 
it is a symbol I believe,

1990
01:49:25,690 --> 01:49:30,690
of the ever present fact of predatory,
slightly predatory threat.

1991
01:49:32,521 --> 01:49:37,230
But our nervous systems as they've 
become capable of abstraction,

1992
01:49:37,231 --> 01:49:41,410
have used that underlying architecture 
to represent more abstract category,

1993
01:49:41,411 --> 01:49:44,700
so it's not the,
it's not a Predator like a dragon is not

1994
01:49:44,701 --> 01:49:45,534
a Predator because there are no dragons,
but maybe a dragon is a snake and a and 

1995
01:49:48,740 --> 01:49:52,240
a crocodile and maybe a leopard and 
maybe a,

1996
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:55,830
a predatory bird all mangled into one 
monster.

1997
01:49:55,970 --> 01:49:56,803
A monster is actually technically 
something that's made out of disparate 

1998
01:49:59,291 --> 01:50:00,124
parts.
And so it's a good symbolic 

1999
01:50:00,791 --> 01:50:05,791
representation for the unknown as such 
that which lies beyond the campfire,

2000
01:50:06,220 --> 01:50:08,320
let's say,
and what lurks out there.

2001
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:11,860
And so the eternal problem is what the 
hell do you do with the Dragon?

2002
01:50:12,340 --> 01:50:16,930
And that also explains why the dragon 
typically is at treasure guarder right?

2003
01:50:16,931 --> 01:50:17,764
Because it's even more,
the problem is even worse out there in 

2004
01:50:21,191 --> 01:50:24,130
no man's land out there in potential 
there's threat and,

2005
01:50:24,131 --> 01:50:26,110
and,
and like mortal threat.

2006
01:50:26,410 --> 01:50:29,740
But there's also endless opportunity and
riches and wealth and,

2007
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:30,993
and,
and the possibility of attracting 

2008
01:50:32,561 --> 01:50:35,470
someone and all of that.
And so while the dragon,

2009
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:36,393
you can't just be afraid of it,
you just stay in your burrow the whole 

2010
01:50:38,981 --> 01:50:41,230
time.
And lots of animals more or less do that

2011
01:50:41,231 --> 01:50:42,010
is,
you know,

2012
01:50:42,010 --> 01:50:44,320
especially the nocturnal ones,
they just hide away.

2013
01:50:44,650 --> 01:50:45,483
But that isn't what human beings are 
light because we're not only praying 

2014
01:50:47,201 --> 01:50:48,820
animals,
we're also predators.

2015
01:50:48,821 --> 01:50:51,820
And then of course we're crazy.
We're absolutely insane.

2016
01:50:51,821 --> 01:50:53,050
Chimpanzees,
right?

2017
01:50:53,051 --> 01:50:53,884
We're crazy.
And so we're always out there mucking 

2018
01:50:55,631 --> 01:51:00,631
about with things and with our fingers 
and our thumbs and,

2019
01:51:00,910 --> 01:51:03,550
and taking the world apart and putting 
it back together.

2020
01:51:03,550 --> 01:51:07,630
And we're crazily exploratory and 
troublemaking.

2021
01:51:07,631 --> 01:51:12,130
And so we don't just run from dragons,
we go hunt them down.

2022
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:16,860
And so
and so there's a story here,

2023
01:51:16,990 --> 01:51:17,823
there's the oldest story that mankind 
knows and literally it is the oldest 

2024
01:51:20,381 --> 01:51:21,214
story that we know is this stories.
And the story basically is there's a 

2025
01:51:24,101 --> 01:51:26,710
bounded space,
a walled garden,

2026
01:51:26,740 --> 01:51:27,573
a walled city in,
on all the original cities were walled 

2027
01:51:29,710 --> 01:51:30,543
because if they weren't,
barbarians would swoop in and they just 

2028
01:51:33,101 --> 01:51:34,870
steal all your stuff.
And so,

2029
01:51:35,090 --> 01:51:36,400
you know,
that was kind of pointless.

2030
01:51:36,401 --> 01:51:37,234
So you know you wanted to have some 
major league walls surrounding your 

2031
01:51:40,391 --> 01:51:41,224
territory,
so that's inhabited space and inside 

2032
01:51:43,661 --> 01:51:47,920
that is your little dominance hierarchy 
and so all you primates knew exactly who

2033
01:51:47,921 --> 01:51:48,754
was who inside that space so you didn't 
have to fight with each other and you 

2034
01:51:51,251 --> 01:51:54,280
could predict each other's behavior 
because you believed the same things and

2035
01:51:54,430 --> 01:51:55,263
saw the world roughly the same way and 
acted the same way and so you were sort 

2036
01:51:58,391 --> 01:51:59,170
of secure.

2037
01:51:59,170 --> 01:52:02,530
But then the problem is is that that can
always be breached.

2038
01:52:02,531 --> 01:52:04,810
There's always something outside of it 
that's a danger,

2039
01:52:04,811 --> 01:52:09,811
and so that's signified by this,
this little creature here is this dragon

2040
01:52:10,900 --> 01:52:14,830
and that that twirl in its tail is very 
common among dragons.

2041
01:52:14,831 --> 01:52:18,340
It's actually,
it's actually a symbol because imagistic

2042
01:52:18,341 --> 01:52:19,174
languages,
images to symbols have an ancient 

2043
01:52:21,671 --> 01:52:22,504
language and it.
It's referring to something that's 

2044
01:52:25,031 --> 01:52:27,700
basically eternal and see it lives down 
here in this,

2045
01:52:27,730 --> 01:52:30,070
in this cave,
because it's an underground thing,

2046
01:52:30,490 --> 01:52:31,323
it's an underground thing and you can 
kind of imagine what that's like and 

2047
01:52:33,461 --> 01:52:37,090
sometimes this happens in initiation 
rituals among archaic people.

2048
01:52:37,390 --> 01:52:38,980
They're gonna win.
They're going to initiate.

2049
01:52:39,010 --> 01:52:39,843
Usually the young men,
because nature initiates women all by 

2050
01:52:41,711 --> 01:52:43,960
itself,
I'm usually the young men,

2051
01:52:44,290 --> 01:52:46,340
maybe they'll put them in cave and leave
them there,

2052
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:47,313
you know,
for like,

2053
01:52:48,170 --> 01:52:48,820
well,
who knows,

2054
01:52:48,820 --> 01:52:51,170
who knows how long,
and so you've got to think what's in the

2055
01:52:51,171 --> 01:52:52,004
cave.

2056
01:52:52,240 --> 01:52:54,890
Caves are dark man.
I don't know if you've ever been in one,

2057
01:52:54,891 --> 01:52:55,724
but like they're dark and they're really
dark and so not only is there whatever 

2058
01:53:00,380 --> 01:53:03,290
there is in the cave and you don't know 
what the hell is in the cave.

2059
01:53:03,470 --> 01:53:06,140
There's whatever you imagine might be in
the cave.

2060
01:53:06,500 --> 01:53:09,050
And so when you're in that cave and 
you're alone,

2061
01:53:09,051 --> 01:53:11,600
you,
you're confronting the devils and demons

2062
01:53:11,601 --> 01:53:13,850
and monsters of your own imagination,
you know,

2063
01:53:14,030 --> 01:53:17,540
and so then you have a chance to perhaps
deal with that and overcome it.

2064
01:53:17,541 --> 01:53:20,450
And that's perhaps part of the 
initiation ceremony,

2065
01:53:20,451 --> 01:53:21,284
you know,
and that's part of growing up because 

2066
01:53:22,641 --> 01:53:27,530
you have to learn how to face the things
that terrify and upset you and,

2067
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:30,650
and re cast them and put them back 
together.

2068
01:53:30,890 --> 01:53:34,810
We talked a little bit about this idea 
of the pre cosmo Gona chaos that,

2069
01:53:34,811 --> 01:53:35,830
um,
that,

2070
01:53:35,850 --> 01:53:38,550
uh,
Eliana refers to an end.

2071
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:39,433
That's the stuff out of which order is 
produced at the beginning of time and 

2072
01:53:43,160 --> 01:53:43,993
it's also the stuff out of which you 
constantly reproduce order and the 

2073
01:53:48,140 --> 01:53:49,880
unions,
the psychoanalysts,

2074
01:53:49,940 --> 01:53:50,773
especially the really deep 
psychoanalysts like young Freud was a 

2075
01:53:53,481 --> 01:53:56,030
more surface psychoanalyst and that's 
not an insult.

2076
01:53:56,090 --> 01:53:58,640
There's some things that Freud figured 
out there is absolutely amazing.

2077
01:53:58,830 --> 01:54:03,470
He was a precursor to young for sure
for young.

2078
01:54:03,471 --> 01:54:06,620
The Hero's journey was the journey 
inside the unconscious and that would be

2079
01:54:06,621 --> 01:54:07,454
perhaps in some sense that the,
the willingness to face everything 

2080
01:54:11,301 --> 01:54:12,134
terrible that's happened to you and to 
think it through and to articulate it 

2081
01:54:14,250 --> 01:54:18,020
and to come to grips perhaps with your 
own capacity for malevolence.

2082
01:54:18,230 --> 01:54:20,540
That was a really important part of 
union ideas.

2083
01:54:20,780 --> 01:54:23,570
That the first step towards 
individuation,

2084
01:54:23,571 --> 01:54:25,880
which is the manifestation of your full 
self,

2085
01:54:25,881 --> 01:54:26,714
let's say,
was the discovery of your shadow and 

2086
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:29,653
your shadow is the part of you that will
do terrible things under the right 

2087
01:54:33,441 --> 01:54:34,340
circumstances.

2088
01:54:34,340 --> 01:54:36,590
And maybe even without that much 
provocation.

2089
01:54:36,591 --> 01:54:37,424
And you know,
and it's a terrifying part of you to 

2090
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:41,300
come into contact with because it sort 
of,

2091
01:54:41,660 --> 01:54:42,493
it sort of the way that you're 
specifically attached to the archetype 

2092
01:54:44,931 --> 01:54:47,480
of evil now it's like that's a good way 
of thinking about it.

2093
01:54:47,481 --> 01:54:48,800
And you know,
modern people,

2094
01:54:48,801 --> 01:54:52,040
they don't really think much about the 
bunch of both the idea of good and evil,

2095
01:54:52,041 --> 01:54:54,110
but that's because they're,
most of them are so damn naive,

2096
01:54:54,111 --> 01:54:57,920
you can just barely even comprehend it.
You know,

2097
01:54:57,921 --> 01:55:01,460
if you read any history,
if you really read it like,

2098
01:55:02,160 --> 01:55:02,993
and you,
and you don't come away with the idea 

2099
01:55:04,641 --> 01:55:05,474
that evil exists.
It's like you're just reading the wrong 

2100
01:55:07,251 --> 01:55:08,490
kind of history.
You know,

2101
01:55:08,900 --> 01:55:12,890
it's just unbelievable what people can 
do to each other.

2102
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:14,990
And we're so imaginative,
you know,

2103
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:17,060
and one of the things I figured out 
about people,

2104
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:21,080
the reason that we're,
we have the knowledge of good and evil,

2105
01:55:21,140 --> 01:55:24,410
let's say,
is that because we're self conscious and

2106
01:55:24,411 --> 01:55:27,080
we know about ourselves,
we know about our own vulnerability,

2107
01:55:27,110 --> 01:55:27,500
right?

2108
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:28,333
You know what hurts you.
You really know what hurts you way more 

2109
01:55:30,801 --> 01:55:32,600
than an animal notes.
And so,

2110
01:55:32,601 --> 01:55:35,420
and you're also creative and so once you
know what hurts you,

2111
01:55:35,900 --> 01:55:38,240
man,
you can really hurt someone else and you

2112
01:55:38,241 --> 01:55:41,000
can do it in such a creative way.
You can draw it out,

2113
01:55:41,030 --> 01:55:44,520
you can make it excruciating.
You can take people apart physically and

2114
01:55:44,521 --> 01:55:45,354
psychologically and you can keep them 
say even right on the edge of death so 

2115
01:55:48,601 --> 01:55:49,434
that you can keep doing that endlessly.
And you know that happens a hell of a 

2116
01:55:53,401 --> 01:55:54,810
lot more than you think.
It happens.

2117
01:55:54,811 --> 01:55:59,050
It happens a lot and so
well.

2118
01:55:59,090 --> 01:55:59,851
And you think,
well,

2119
01:55:59,851 --> 01:56:01,230
you know,
that doesn't involve me.

2120
01:56:01,231 --> 01:56:02,370
It's like,
Oh yes it does,

2121
01:56:02,371 --> 01:56:03,204
man.
That's the problem because you know 

2122
01:56:04,411 --> 01:56:05,244
you're human and that's the sort of 
things that human beings are capable of 

2123
01:56:07,741 --> 01:56:09,330
or not.
I'm not saying you're all,

2124
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:13,620
it's all probable that you do that ever 
or or that,

2125
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:15,570
but I'm saying that,
you know,

2126
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:17,153
you gotta take that into account when 
you're looking at the world and you 

2127
01:56:19,801 --> 01:56:21,630
think about all the perpetrators out 
there.

2128
01:56:21,630 --> 01:56:22,463
It's like,
it's not like there's perpetrators and 

2129
01:56:24,391 --> 01:56:27,000
their victims.
That isn't how it works.

2130
01:56:27,540 --> 01:56:28,373
It doesn't work that way at all.
And so the horrors of humanity as well 

2131
01:56:31,441 --> 01:56:32,274
as the noble elements of humanity are 
all elements of your central being and 

2132
01:56:35,911 --> 01:56:38,580
for young,
and this is the terrible thing for using

2133
01:56:38,581 --> 01:56:39,414
the pathway to higher wisdom was through
the terrible portal of while you could 

2134
01:56:43,531 --> 01:56:45,610
say hell for that matter.
Really.

2135
01:56:45,630 --> 01:56:47,940
And so who wants to do that?
Man?

2136
01:56:47,941 --> 01:56:49,860
It's like no,
you know,

2137
01:56:49,861 --> 01:56:51,630
like maybe you're resentful about 
something.

2138
01:56:51,660 --> 01:56:52,493
Well you probably are because like 
everybody's resentful about something 

2139
01:56:54,751 --> 01:56:57,900
you know,
and resentment is just vicious emotion.

2140
01:56:58,230 --> 01:56:59,063
It's really useful.
It's really useful because if you're 

2141
01:57:01,411 --> 01:57:04,890
resentful about something,
it either means that you should grow the

2142
01:57:04,891 --> 01:57:09,891
hell up and accept the responsibility 
and quit sniveling around and whining or

2143
01:57:10,380 --> 01:57:12,860
it means that someone actually is 
oppressing you and,

2144
01:57:12,861 --> 01:57:13,694
and pushing on you too hard and bullying
you and demeaning you and you have 

2145
01:57:16,771 --> 01:57:21,771
something to say or do that you're not 
saying or doing and no wonder you're not

2146
01:57:22,831 --> 01:57:27,831
saying or doing it because you know it 
can be really dangerous to say things or

2147
01:57:28,111 --> 01:57:31,740
do them to free yourself from,
from being oppressed.

2148
01:57:31,740 --> 01:57:33,690
You can get it a lot of trouble in the 
short term.

2149
01:57:33,691 --> 01:57:34,524
For doing it so it's easier just to not 
say anything sort of day after day in 

2150
01:57:38,371 --> 01:57:41,070
the short term you protect yourself but 
just crushes you.

2151
01:57:41,310 --> 01:57:44,160
And then the resentment comes up and 
resentment.

2152
01:57:44,161 --> 01:57:46,290
Man,
that can just get so out of hand.

2153
01:57:46,291 --> 01:57:47,124
You know,
it starts with resentment and then it 

2154
01:57:48,721 --> 01:57:51,540
starts.
It goes to the desire for revenge.

2155
01:57:51,750 --> 01:57:52,583
You know,
because you'll play nasty little tricks 

2156
01:57:53,521 --> 01:57:56,160
on the person that's oppressing you at 
any chance.

2157
01:57:56,161 --> 01:57:59,190
You'll talk about them behind their back
and if they want you to do something,

2158
01:57:59,191 --> 01:58:01,380
you'll do it badly.
Or you'll do it grudgingly.

2159
01:58:01,381 --> 01:58:04,670
Or you'll do a half rate job and you'll 
set up little traps and you know,

2160
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:08,220
so it puts you in a poisonous space.
And then if that,

2161
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:09,233
if you really start to dwell on that,
say in your basement for three or four 

2162
01:58:12,781 --> 01:58:13,614
years about just exactly how terrible 
the world is and how that's focused on 

2163
01:58:16,291 --> 01:58:17,820
you and how everyone's rejected you.

2164
01:58:17,820 --> 01:58:20,700
And how you get to this point where 
you're thinking that,

2165
01:58:21,030 --> 01:58:21,863
you know,
existence itself is a kind of poisonous 

2166
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:26,250
endeavor.
And that the best thing for you to do is

2167
01:58:26,251 --> 01:58:27,084
go out there and do as much,
create as much mayhem as you possibly 

2168
01:58:30,121 --> 01:58:32,700
can,
and if you really get to a dark place,

2169
01:58:32,701 --> 01:58:33,534
you think I'm going to create as much 
mayhem as I possibly can by targeting 

2170
01:58:36,901 --> 01:58:39,480
the most innocent thing I can possibly 
imagine.

2171
01:58:39,690 --> 01:58:40,523
And then you end up shooting kids in 
Connecticut and that's how you get 

2172
01:58:43,211 --> 01:58:46,390
there.
And so that's a bad road man.

2173
01:58:46,580 --> 01:58:47,413
There's dark things down there,
but you can go there and people do and 

2174
01:58:50,981 --> 01:58:51,814
they go through the whole of resentment 
and resentment can tell you you've got 

2175
01:58:56,021 --> 01:58:58,930
something to say.
You bloody well better say it.

2176
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:02,410
You've gotta free yourself from what's 
oppressing you.

2177
01:59:02,420 --> 01:59:06,670
You have to stand up for that because 
otherwise you become oppressed.

2178
01:59:06,670 --> 01:59:11,410
And then once you're oppressed,
that's just not so good.

2179
01:59:11,530 --> 01:59:14,320
And so like in your marriage and your 
relationships,

2180
01:59:15,640 --> 01:59:17,230
you gotta tell people what you're 
thinking.

2181
01:59:17,231 --> 01:59:18,064
You don't have to assume you're right.
That's a whole different story because 

2182
01:59:20,951 --> 01:59:22,160
you're not because you're,
you know,

2183
01:59:22,161 --> 01:59:26,470
ignorant and you're biased and you know,
so you're not right,

2184
01:59:26,650 --> 01:59:31,650
but you can stumble towards Europe,
this expression of yourself and then you

2185
01:59:32,201 --> 01:59:33,034
can listen to the other person and hope 
that they tell you some way that you're 

2186
01:59:36,071 --> 01:59:36,904
stupid.
That's useful so you can be a little 

2187
01:59:38,381 --> 01:59:41,410
less stupid in the future because that 
wouldn't that be good.

2188
01:59:41,950 --> 01:59:44,650
And so you know,
you go after the unknown.

2189
01:59:45,700 --> 01:59:48,820
You don't protect what you know.
You already know what you know.

2190
01:59:49,660 --> 01:59:50,493
You go after what you don't know.
That's why you have to talk to people 

2191
01:59:52,511 --> 01:59:53,344
you don't agree with.
That's why you have to talk to your 

2192
01:59:54,881 --> 01:59:57,790
enemies because they're going to tell 
you things you don't know.

2193
01:59:57,790 --> 01:59:58,623
You could even listen to them.
It's possibly know a thing or two you 

2194
02:00:00,401 --> 02:00:02,470
don't know,
but people don't like that.

2195
02:00:02,471 --> 02:00:04,120
You know,
they just talked to people who think the

2196
02:00:04,121 --> 02:00:08,020
same way and then they just stay stupid.
And so that's.

2197
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:11,530
And that's not good because if you're 
not wise,

2198
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:15,150
the world will wall up you.
It'll flatten you and,

2199
02:00:15,250 --> 02:00:16,083
and far more than it has to.
And then you'll be bitter and resentful 

2200
02:00:19,181 --> 02:00:23,290
and you'll be part of that force,
that wall ups instead of the forest that

2201
02:00:23,291 --> 02:00:25,780
fights against that.
So while,

2202
02:00:25,781 --> 02:00:27,670
so you go after the dragon and that's 
what,

2203
02:00:27,940 --> 02:00:30,580
that's what this guy is doing.
He's going after the dragon hint.

2204
02:00:30,820 --> 02:00:34,300
It's threatening the society because it 
always does chaos.

2205
02:00:34,390 --> 02:00:36,730
What's outside of order always threatens
order.

2206
02:00:36,820 --> 02:00:38,380
Always,
always.

2207
02:00:38,920 --> 02:00:41,560
And so you have to step forward,
you know,

2208
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:44,290
in this manner,
voluntarily and,

2209
02:00:44,780 --> 02:00:45,613
and,
and go after that when it's still 

2210
02:00:46,631 --> 02:00:47,470
manageable.

2211
02:00:47,620 --> 02:00:48,453
Right?
And that's the case in your own life 

2212
02:00:49,211 --> 02:00:50,044
too.
So you know,

2213
02:00:50,260 --> 02:00:53,080
if you're,
if you've had a proclivity to be bullied

2214
02:00:53,081 --> 02:00:54,130
in the past,
you know,

2215
02:00:54,940 --> 02:00:55,773
and you want to get out of that,
what you have to do is you have to make 

2216
02:00:57,371 --> 02:01:01,300
yourself awake to the,
to the,

2217
02:01:01,720 --> 02:01:02,710
to the,
to the,

2218
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:03,753
what would you say to the,
to the initial stages of that sort of 

2219
02:01:07,391 --> 02:01:09,340
bullying emerging in your life.
Again,

2220
02:01:09,350 --> 02:01:10,183
that sort of domination.
And you have to step forward against it 

2221
02:01:13,120 --> 02:01:15,610
when it's still in its developing 
stages.

2222
02:01:15,611 --> 02:01:17,470
Because maybe you can just not have it 
happen.

2223
02:01:17,860 --> 02:01:18,693
That would be better.
And so you have to be ready to speak 

2224
02:01:22,150 --> 02:01:25,300
what you have to say more or less on a 
moment's notice.

2225
02:01:25,301 --> 02:01:26,880
You,
you can't be impulsive about,

2226
02:01:27,240 --> 02:01:28,073
you know,
like if you and I are talking and you 

2227
02:01:28,961 --> 02:01:33,610
make a mistake or I make a mistake,
even if it's bothers one or the other of

2228
02:01:33,611 --> 02:01:35,050
us,
we should just write it off because it's

2229
02:01:35,051 --> 02:01:36,370
like one encounter,
what the hell,

2230
02:01:36,371 --> 02:01:37,204
you know,
maybe we had a bad night's sleep or 

2231
02:01:38,840 --> 02:01:39,673
something,
you know,

2232
02:01:40,170 --> 02:01:41,600
so you've got to be a little forgiving.

2233
02:01:42,030 --> 02:01:42,863
But if it happens twice then you know 
you should be a little awake and you 

2234
02:01:46,371 --> 02:01:49,010
should remember both times.
And then if it happens a third time,

2235
02:01:49,011 --> 02:01:52,250
it's like that's when you,
that's when you act and you say,

2236
02:01:52,251 --> 02:01:56,060
look,
we talked and this happened.

2237
02:01:56,061 --> 02:01:57,260
And I thought yeah,
whatever.

2238
02:01:57,261 --> 02:02:01,460
And then you did it again and then you 
just did it again.

2239
02:02:01,490 --> 02:02:03,260
Well then the person who is basically 
like,

2240
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:04,820
what are they going to do?
You know?

2241
02:02:05,540 --> 02:02:08,270
No,
well maybe they might argue with you,

2242
02:02:08,271 --> 02:02:10,820
but you kind of got them and you're 
generally.

2243
02:02:10,821 --> 02:02:13,310
If you just point that out to people 
just like that,

2244
02:02:13,311 --> 02:02:15,830
just that you noticed and are willing to
say something about it,

2245
02:02:16,340 --> 02:02:17,173
they'll back the hell off.
They'll often apologize and sometimes 

2246
02:02:19,731 --> 02:02:21,500
you even make them a little more 
conscious,

2247
02:02:21,501 --> 02:02:22,460
which is like,
hey,

2248
02:02:22,461 --> 02:02:25,700
that's not such a bad idea.
That's what all this means.

2249
02:02:25,700 --> 02:02:29,210
And so this caught this chaos idea.
It's so for union,

2250
02:02:29,230 --> 02:02:30,500
it was the unconscious,
right?

2251
02:02:30,501 --> 02:02:31,334
It was the contents of your unconscious 
and so that might be the unknown past 

2252
02:02:34,280 --> 02:02:35,113
that threatening past that you have 
never dealt with might be the 

2253
02:02:37,641 --> 02:02:40,790
threatening future.
It might be too threatening present,

2254
02:02:41,210 --> 02:02:42,043
but you realized as his,
as he got older that that the 

2255
02:02:45,561 --> 02:02:48,230
unconscious was also the world when you 
think,

2256
02:02:48,500 --> 02:02:49,333
and so the chaos is not only your 
unconscious mind which meets the 

2257
02:02:52,401 --> 02:02:53,234
unknown,
but it's actually the unknown itself 

2258
02:02:54,411 --> 02:02:56,320
mingled together and you think,
well,

2259
02:02:56,321 --> 02:03:00,050
what the hell does that?
That's why the dragon is a land creature

2260
02:03:00,051 --> 02:03:02,690
in an error creature.
It's matter and spirit at the same time,

2261
02:03:02,840 --> 02:03:03,673
and this sort of gets us into 
constructivism because the 

2262
02:03:05,841 --> 02:03:06,674
constructivists think that basically 
what happens is that you encountered 

2263
02:03:09,191 --> 02:03:10,024
those elements of the world that don't 
fit into your theory and out of those 

2264
02:03:13,641 --> 02:03:14,474
new elements you make the world through 
your perceptions and you make yourself 

2265
02:03:17,841 --> 02:03:18,674
by incorporating the information and 
transforming yourself and that's how 

2266
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:23,390
piaget explains the development of a 
child.

2267
02:03:23,720 --> 02:03:25,910
If the child starts out with some 
reflexes,

2268
02:03:25,940 --> 02:03:30,530
basic reflexes and manifesting the 
reflex is produces results in the world,

2269
02:03:30,531 --> 02:03:31,364
and then the child has to reorganize its
perceptions to take into account the 

2270
02:03:34,971 --> 02:03:35,804
transformations and so then it,
it gets a little more sophisticated and 

2271
02:03:38,841 --> 02:03:42,560
then it can do a few more things and 
then it can manifest more changes in the

2272
02:03:42,561 --> 02:03:43,394
world and then it modern.
It attracts them and modifies its 

2273
02:03:46,161 --> 02:03:46,994
perceptions and actions to account for 
them and it just keeps doing that and 

2274
02:03:49,791 --> 02:03:53,000
that's how the child boots itself up 
like a computer does.

2275
02:03:53,350 --> 02:03:57,440
It's a very cool idea.
And so from from the Piagetian stance,

2276
02:03:57,441 --> 02:03:58,274
so it's constructive.
The stance you could think of the world 

2277
02:03:59,781 --> 02:04:00,614
as a latent pool of information,
it's something like that with a 

2278
02:04:04,071 --> 02:04:04,904
structure obviously,
that you can interact with with your 

2279
02:04:07,161 --> 02:04:07,994
little fingers in your body and your 
mind and your eyes and your mouth and 

2280
02:04:11,930 --> 02:04:12,763
you make changes happen and you track 
them and you've modeled them and you 

2281
02:04:15,501 --> 02:04:16,334
build your skills and as you continue to
do that in the safety of your house 

2282
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:22,550
initially under the care of your parents
who,

2283
02:04:22,760 --> 02:04:24,880
who fill in where you're ignorant,
you,

2284
02:04:24,910 --> 02:04:25,743
you,
you just emerge more and more competent 

2285
02:04:28,281 --> 02:04:30,470
and confident and ready to move ahead.

2286
02:04:30,470 --> 02:04:31,303
So that's,
that's how the constructivist idea 

2287
02:04:32,301 --> 02:04:33,410
works.
And so,

2288
02:04:33,830 --> 02:04:36,260
so there's kind of a chaos id at the 
bottom of that,

2289
02:04:36,261 --> 02:04:37,094
which is that out of which you emerge 
and the world emerges at the same time 

2290
02:04:41,280 --> 02:04:44,460
because you know you don't see reality.
Not at all.

2291
02:04:44,700 --> 02:04:47,610
You see almost like an animated version 
of reality.

2292
02:04:47,611 --> 02:04:48,960
You know,
like when I look at you,

2293
02:04:48,961 --> 02:04:49,794
I just see the front of you.
I just see the outside of the US EU at 

2294
02:04:52,351 --> 02:04:53,184
this height.
I don't see any of your internal 

2295
02:04:54,181 --> 02:04:57,450
structure.
I don't see the back part of you at all.

2296
02:04:57,451 --> 02:05:00,150
I don't see your family.
I don't see your history.

2297
02:05:00,270 --> 02:05:02,370
I don't see your future.
You know,

2298
02:05:02,430 --> 02:05:06,210
I just see this slice of you.
You're so complicated.

2299
02:05:06,211 --> 02:05:07,044
I just see this little like 
oversimplified slice of you right now 

2300
02:05:11,041 --> 02:05:13,240
and I think that's the reality and it's,
it's,

2301
02:05:13,250 --> 02:05:15,930
it's sort of the reality,
the way that the simpsons,

2302
02:05:16,410 --> 02:05:18,840
a simpsons character is you.

2303
02:05:19,140 --> 02:05:23,910
It's like it's sort of like you and it's
enough so that you can watch the story,

2304
02:05:23,911 --> 02:05:28,140
but the real you man,
God only knows what that is and that's a

2305
02:05:28,141 --> 02:05:28,974
union idea.
You know that the real you is something 

2306
02:05:31,351 --> 02:05:32,184
that radically transcends your 
perception of yourself or your 

2307
02:05:35,251 --> 02:05:36,084
conception of yourself and that you get 
to that hire you at least in part by 

2308
02:05:40,111 --> 02:05:44,950
going into the darkest place.
And so it's a hell of an idea,

2309
02:05:44,980 --> 02:05:45,900
man.
It's really.

2310
02:05:46,050 --> 02:05:46,883
But it's the old idea of initiation.
It's as old as time that idea and 

2311
02:05:50,611 --> 02:05:52,930
there's something to it.
And we definitely recreate it.

2312
02:05:52,931 --> 02:05:55,590
And psychotherapy like this isn't an 
airy theory.

2313
02:05:56,070 --> 02:06:00,600
It's quite the contrary because what you
do and as a psychologist always,

2314
02:06:00,660 --> 02:06:01,493
always a behaviorist say that the most,
the most logical clinical type of 

2315
02:06:06,061 --> 02:06:06,894
psychologist or behaviorist is that an 
initiatory Sharma and even though he or 

2316
02:06:10,771 --> 02:06:13,680
she doesn't know it because what they do
is they say,

2317
02:06:13,681 --> 02:06:15,420
okay,
well let's take a look at your life.

2318
02:06:15,450 --> 02:06:16,171
Like,
okay,

2319
02:06:16,171 --> 02:06:17,004
you got a bunch of problems and they're 
like massive dragons and you're just 

2320
02:06:19,831 --> 02:06:20,664
like,
you're not going anywhere with those 

2321
02:06:21,991 --> 02:06:24,060
problems here.
Just cowering in the corner.

2322
02:06:24,510 --> 02:06:27,480
And what the behavior therapist does is 
cut them,

2323
02:06:27,870 --> 02:06:32,190
cut that dragon into those little dwarfs
until the doors are small enough so that

2324
02:06:32,191 --> 02:06:33,024
you can really kick the hell out of them
and so and that by the way they do that 

2325
02:06:36,091 --> 02:06:36,924
is they take the problem and they 
decompose it into elements that are 

2326
02:06:40,051 --> 02:06:44,670
small enough that you have a reasonable 
probability of mastering them.

2327
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:48,900
So you take the problem apart into 
intuit's micro problems.

2328
02:06:49,050 --> 02:06:49,883
Careful,
careful analytic process and then you 

2329
02:06:51,751 --> 02:06:52,261
think,
okay,

2330
02:06:52,261 --> 02:06:55,140
well how could we progress a little bit 
this week?

2331
02:06:55,141 --> 02:06:59,460
And some of that is to face to practice 
facing things you're afraid of.

2332
02:06:59,640 --> 02:07:02,490
So like if your agoraphobic and you 
can't get on an elevator,

2333
02:07:02,610 --> 02:07:05,640
you can't get on a taxi and you can't 
stand up to your husband,

2334
02:07:05,641 --> 02:07:08,160
and I'm saying husband,
because most agoraphobic are women,

2335
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:11,490
most of them are middle aged women and 
most of them were too dependent for most

2336
02:07:11,491 --> 02:07:12,324
of their life.

2337
02:07:12,390 --> 02:07:15,750
So that's a monster.
It's like society,

2338
02:07:15,751 --> 02:07:17,400
husband,
elevator,

2339
02:07:17,430 --> 02:07:18,750
taxi,
subway.

2340
02:07:18,870 --> 02:07:19,703
It's a monster and it's that place you 
will not go and that's because you feel 

2341
02:07:23,731 --> 02:07:26,160
this high and everything else looks this
big.

2342
02:07:26,550 --> 02:07:27,383
And so and partly that's because you've 
run away and when you run away from 

2343
02:07:29,761 --> 02:07:32,010
something it grows and chases you.
Which is,

2344
02:07:32,340 --> 02:07:33,173
well,
it's exactly what happens to a prey 

2345
02:07:34,291 --> 02:07:35,124
animal man.
If you go in the woods and you find a 

2346
02:07:36,701 --> 02:07:38,770
bear,
especially at Grizzly,

2347
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:41,380
while you're in real trouble,
if it's a grizzly.

2348
02:07:41,620 --> 02:07:43,000
But if it's a black bear,
you know,

2349
02:07:43,001 --> 02:07:45,280
generally speaking,
if you stand your ground and make a hell

2350
02:07:45,281 --> 02:07:46,750
of a lot of noise,
that thing,

2351
02:07:46,751 --> 02:07:49,980
we'll leave you alone.
But if you run well,

2352
02:07:50,040 --> 02:07:53,350
what's it supposed to think?
It eats things that run from it.

2353
02:07:54,250 --> 02:07:56,770
So that's exactly where that idea came 
to come from.

2354
02:07:56,771 --> 02:07:57,604
You turn tail and run and then the thing
that you're afraid of is really a 

2355
02:08:00,341 --> 02:08:03,010
monster and it's gonna get you and eat 
you.

2356
02:08:03,040 --> 02:08:05,560
It's like,
well that's true psychologically as well

2357
02:08:05,800 --> 02:08:08,860
and the same circuits that we use to 
when we were,

2358
02:08:08,940 --> 02:08:10,510
you know,
out in the forest,

2359
02:08:10,511 --> 02:08:11,344
even even in trees,
the same circuits that we used to parse 

2360
02:08:13,841 --> 02:08:18,160
up the world.
Then into safe territory and place where

2361
02:08:18,161 --> 02:08:21,790
the predators loom is the way we parse 
up the world now,

2362
02:08:21,791 --> 02:08:25,150
which is safe territory and the place 
where the predators loom.

2363
02:08:25,151 --> 02:08:28,750
It's just become abstracted way up,
abstracted way up.

2364
02:08:29,260 --> 02:08:31,390
So.
But it's the same damn circuits.

2365
02:08:31,750 --> 02:08:36,070
We know this like the same circuits you 
use to forage for information.

2366
02:08:36,340 --> 02:08:37,173
Just dopaminergic circuit is the circuit
that squirrels used to forage for nuts 

2367
02:08:41,230 --> 02:08:42,370
and you think,
well why?

2368
02:08:42,640 --> 02:08:45,910
Well it's because there's no difference 
between information and food.

2369
02:08:46,810 --> 02:08:48,910
Like you trade information for food all 
the time.

2370
02:08:48,911 --> 02:08:50,380
That's what you're doing when you're 
working,

2371
02:08:50,381 --> 02:08:52,270
especially if you're working on a 
computer.

2372
02:08:53,050 --> 02:08:53,883
So the idea that there's,
there's an equation between information 

2373
02:08:57,341 --> 02:08:58,270
and food.
It's like,

2374
02:08:58,390 --> 02:08:59,223
well,
obviously obviously there's an equation 

2375
02:09:01,361 --> 02:09:04,090
between them,
so of course you'd use the same circuits

2376
02:09:04,420 --> 02:09:05,253
and I mean the damn squirrel has to 
remember where the nuts are and so for 

2377
02:09:08,501 --> 02:09:12,370
him information is food.
Even so in what happened to human beings

2378
02:09:12,371 --> 02:09:14,170
is that we started thinking,
Hey,

2379
02:09:14,171 --> 02:09:15,004
maybe it's better to go after 
information than it is to go after food 

2380
02:09:18,850 --> 02:09:22,420
because going after inflammation 
produces more food than just going after

2381
02:09:22,421 --> 02:09:23,254
food.
And so that was a pretty damn smart 

2382
02:09:24,940 --> 02:09:26,680
idea.
So we're still doing that.

2383
02:09:26,860 --> 02:09:27,693
So anyways,
this is what you're supposed to be 

2384
02:09:28,391 --> 02:09:30,040
doing.
And so,

2385
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:33,490
and this is what behavior therapists do,
they decompose your problems.

2386
02:09:33,610 --> 02:09:35,080
What are you afraid of?
Well,

2387
02:09:35,620 --> 02:09:37,000
okay,
you're afraid of everything.

2388
02:09:37,120 --> 02:09:37,953
Well,
let's get something specific you're 

2389
02:09:39,311 --> 02:09:40,001
afraid of.
Well,

2390
02:09:40,001 --> 02:09:41,080
I'm afraid of an elevator.

2391
02:09:41,200 --> 02:09:42,760
Okay.
An elevator.

2392
02:09:42,910 --> 02:09:45,730
So I have a client,
she's afraid of elevators.

2393
02:09:45,731 --> 02:09:46,900
The elevator door opened.
She goes,

2394
02:09:46,990 --> 02:09:49,270
that's a tube.
And I thought,

2395
02:09:49,330 --> 02:09:51,460
oh wow.
I thought it was an elevator,

2396
02:09:51,490 --> 02:09:54,820
but for you it's not a bloody elevator.
It's death.

2397
02:09:55,390 --> 02:09:57,820
And so that's what you're afraid of.
It's worse than that.

2398
02:09:57,821 --> 02:10:00,520
You're afraid of being trapped inside 
there in the dark alone,

2399
02:10:00,940 --> 02:10:03,670
alone,
not knowing if anyone is going to rescue

2400
02:10:03,671 --> 02:10:04,504
you,
stuck there with your damn imagination 

2401
02:10:06,430 --> 02:10:08,170
freaking out.
It's like,

2402
02:10:08,171 --> 02:10:09,004
and if that's not,
and then maybe you have a heart attack 

2403
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:13,120
because you're so terrified and you die.
It's like,

2404
02:10:13,720 --> 02:10:16,360
you know,
so that's the elevator.

2405
02:10:16,630 --> 02:10:17,580
Well,
it's no bloody wonder.

2406
02:10:17,590 --> 02:10:19,330
No one's going to get into something 
like that.

2407
02:10:19,331 --> 02:10:23,290
And then maybe underneath that is your 
distrust in the mechanisms of society,

2408
02:10:23,620 --> 02:10:24,453
right?
Because you know a normal person that 

2409
02:10:27,351 --> 02:10:29,740
was weird creatures,
they'll get an elevator.

2410
02:10:29,741 --> 02:10:31,060
What the hell?
They don't care.

2411
02:10:31,090 --> 02:10:33,100
And partly it's because they have an 
implicit belief.

2412
02:10:33,110 --> 02:10:36,740
Even if the thing stops,
somebody will come along and rescue them

2413
02:10:36,950 --> 02:10:38,690
and usually you don't even think about 
it,

2414
02:10:38,691 --> 02:10:39,430
right?
It's like,

2415
02:10:39,430 --> 02:10:40,251
wow,
what the hell?

2416
02:10:40,251 --> 02:10:41,330
It's an elevator.
It's like

2417
02:10:43,320 --> 02:10:44,910
the danger is invisible to you

2418
02:10:46,290 --> 02:10:47,123
and it's partly because you implicitly 
trust the structure and so maybe you go 

2419
02:10:49,711 --> 02:10:50,544
into the unconscious presuppositions of 
the person who is terrified of the 

2420
02:10:54,181 --> 02:10:55,014
elevator in the subways and you find out
they have a real problem with trusting 

2421
02:10:57,481 --> 02:10:58,314
authority.
That's partly why they don't get along 

2422
02:10:59,611 --> 02:11:00,444
with her husband,
why they'd never been able to stand up 

2423
02:11:01,981 --> 02:11:04,320
for themselves,
so then you say,

2424
02:11:04,321 --> 02:11:06,210
okay,
well you're afraid of the damn elevator,

2425
02:11:06,211 --> 02:11:07,044
but it's not an elevator.
It's a tomb and the tomb is partly you 

2426
02:11:09,511 --> 02:11:10,344
and partly it's partly the elevator and 
partly your unconscious mind and so 

2427
02:11:14,220 --> 02:11:15,450
well,
what can you handle?

2428
02:11:15,780 --> 02:11:18,630
Can you go and look at an elevator from 
10 feet away?

2429
02:11:18,840 --> 02:11:19,673
It's like,
yes.

2430
02:11:19,740 --> 02:11:21,660
Okay.
How about nine feet away?

2431
02:11:21,720 --> 02:11:23,310
Yes.
Five feet.

2432
02:11:23,340 --> 02:11:24,430
Yes.
Four feet?

2433
02:11:24,450 --> 02:11:25,740
No.
Okay.

2434
02:11:25,741 --> 02:11:27,450
No problem.
Four and a half feet.

2435
02:11:27,451 --> 02:11:28,284
We're going to go from that elevator and
we're going to look at the damn thing 

2436
02:11:30,810 --> 02:11:33,690
until you're bored of it because that's 
what we're trying to.

2437
02:11:33,900 --> 02:11:37,620
You should be board of the elevator 
because then you're not afraid of it.

2438
02:11:37,621 --> 02:11:39,570
Obviously.
It's like it's an elevator.

2439
02:11:39,930 --> 02:11:41,370
You just don't notice it.
Right?

2440
02:11:41,790 --> 02:11:44,340
All of these things around here that you
don't notice.

2441
02:11:44,490 --> 02:11:46,560
I'd take you out of here to ask you what
color the walls are.

2442
02:11:46,561 --> 02:11:48,840
You haven't gotten any idea.
You know,

2443
02:11:49,070 --> 02:11:49,903
I,
I suspect for most of you there's not a 

2444
02:11:51,301 --> 02:11:52,134
chance you'd be able to identify the 
gender of the person who's sitting next 

2445
02:11:55,651 --> 02:11:56,484
to you unless you know them.
It's like you just don't remember 

2446
02:11:58,111 --> 02:11:58,944
anything and why should you?
Everything works like you don't have to 

2447
02:12:01,831 --> 02:12:03,150
pay attention to it.
It's like,

2448
02:12:05,130 --> 02:12:06,880
does that stay up?
Yeah,

2449
02:12:06,890 --> 02:12:08,150
it's still off.
Yeah.

2450
02:12:08,610 --> 02:12:10,860
Still up.
Still up.

2451
02:12:10,890 --> 02:12:11,880
It was like,
really?

2452
02:12:12,260 --> 02:12:13,530
No,
you know,

2453
02:12:13,531 --> 02:12:16,530
you get bored of that real quick and so 
then you just ignore it and.

2454
02:12:16,880 --> 02:12:17,713
But the agoraphobic has had that veil of
ignorance torn away and what they see 

2455
02:12:22,411 --> 02:12:23,244
behind it is mortal threat and so that's
really what you're helping them deal 

2456
02:12:25,831 --> 02:12:26,664
with.
And so this week there are four and a 

2457
02:12:29,220 --> 02:12:30,053
half feet from the elevator.
Next week they're a foot from the 

2458
02:12:30,991 --> 02:12:34,980
elevator and the week after that,
the horrible gates of hell open and they

2459
02:12:34,981 --> 02:12:37,620
look inside and they don't run.
And so,

2460
02:12:37,621 --> 02:12:38,454
hey,
they're tougher than they thought they 

2461
02:12:39,931 --> 02:12:41,610
were.
And that's what you're teaching them.

2462
02:12:41,611 --> 02:12:42,444
Actually.
You're not teaching them that the world 

2463
02:12:43,261 --> 02:12:47,190
isn't dangerous because that's a stupid 
thing to teach someone bloody right.

2464
02:12:47,191 --> 02:12:48,024
The world is dangerous.
It's terrifying and sometimes people 

2465
02:12:50,701 --> 02:12:55,480
under a realize that and the veil lifts 
and they see horror everywhere.

2466
02:12:55,590 --> 02:12:57,600
They see that and then they think,
well,

2467
02:12:57,601 --> 02:12:59,700
I'm just a little rabbit.
I'm over here in the corner.

2468
02:12:59,970 --> 02:13:01,950
I can't move.
I'm petrified.

2469
02:13:02,340 --> 02:13:05,550
And then they can't move.
They hide it home.

2470
02:13:05,640 --> 02:13:06,473
They cower at home because everything 
has become a predatory domain and so 

2471
02:13:10,111 --> 02:13:14,670
what you teach them is you're not as 
much of a rabbit as you think,

2472
02:13:15,240 --> 02:13:19,290
and part of that is that you help them 
grow some teeth so that they can go home

2473
02:13:19,291 --> 02:13:20,124
and have that fight with their husband 
that they should have had 25 years ago 

2474
02:13:22,650 --> 02:13:27,090
and it happens very frequently with 
agoraphobic clients that you get them so

2475
02:13:27,360 --> 02:13:28,193
they can go on the damn elevator and 
they can go on the subway and they can 

2476
02:13:30,301 --> 02:13:32,910
take a taxi.
Maybe they learned to drive,

2477
02:13:33,240 --> 02:13:35,950
wow.
That get some upon me and then there are

2478
02:13:35,951 --> 02:13:36,784
a little tougher and so then they can 
stand up from the for themselves and 

2479
02:13:39,240 --> 02:13:42,900
they go back and like their husband 
might not be very happy with any of this

2480
02:13:43,530 --> 02:13:43,980
really.

2481
02:13:43,980 --> 02:13:45,900
It depends on what sort of guy he is.
You know,

2482
02:13:45,901 --> 02:13:46,734
if he's a real tyrant,
he might be just perfectly happy that 

2483
02:13:49,171 --> 02:13:53,040
he's married to someone who was afraid 
of her own shadow because then she won't

2484
02:13:53,070 --> 02:13:57,240
ever leave and so that's a nasty little 
story and believe me,

2485
02:13:57,241 --> 02:13:58,074
it's not uncommon.
So she gets tougher by facing what she 

2486
02:14:01,111 --> 02:14:01,944
fears and what she finds out is there's 
a hell of a lot more to her than she 

2487
02:14:04,441 --> 02:14:05,274
thought.
And that's really what happens when you 

2488
02:14:06,841 --> 02:14:08,970
do behavior therapy with someone who's 
agoraphobic.

2489
02:14:09,300 --> 02:14:11,130
It isn't really that they get less 
afraid.

2490
02:14:11,131 --> 02:14:14,100
It's that they get braver.
That's way different.

2491
02:14:14,630 --> 02:14:18,840
It's because brave is alert and able to 
cope.

2492
02:14:19,650 --> 02:14:22,770
Naive is there's no danger.
It's like hell yeah,

2493
02:14:22,771 --> 02:14:23,970
right.
There's no danger.

2494
02:14:23,971 --> 02:14:26,010
Jesus.
What a stupid theory that is.

2495
02:14:26,490 --> 02:14:28,440
So anyways,
that's what all this is.

2496
02:14:28,441 --> 02:14:30,060
That's,
that's the story man.

2497
02:14:30,060 --> 02:14:31,950
And it's a.
it's a major story.

2498
02:14:31,951 --> 02:14:35,250
It's the story of human transformation 
and growth.

2499
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:36,113
It's the evolved evolution of mankind.
It's like it's a major story and we've 

2500
02:14:40,831 --> 02:14:45,831
been working on the damn thing for like
God only knows how long,

2501
02:14:46,920 --> 02:14:48,810
you know.
Snakes and primates,

2502
02:14:48,940 --> 02:14:51,930
coevolved and our vision are sharp,
Sharp,

2503
02:14:51,931 --> 02:14:52,764
sharp vision seems to have been an 
evolutionary adaptation forced on us by 

2504
02:14:57,781 --> 02:14:58,614
the presence of predatory snakes and 
we're talking tens of millions of years 

2505
02:15:02,701 --> 02:15:05,700
ago and human beings have unbelievably 
sharp eyesight.

2506
02:15:06,030 --> 02:15:10,290
The only thing that can see us as birds 
of prey and they have like an eagle,

2507
02:15:10,291 --> 02:15:15,000
a bald eagle has eyes as big as ours,
and it has to phobias that phobia is the

2508
02:15:15,001 --> 02:15:18,420
central part of the vision.
So an eagle is all eyes man,

2509
02:15:18,840 --> 02:15:20,250
and so,
but human beings,

2510
02:15:20,251 --> 02:15:21,084
we're kind of like that too.
And like half our brain is devoted to 

2511
02:15:22,981 --> 02:15:23,940
visual processing.

2512
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:25,133
We have acute vision in Madagascar where
there are primates with no predatory 

2513
02:15:29,011 --> 02:15:30,270
snakes.
They're lemurs.

2514
02:15:30,271 --> 02:15:33,660
They can't see worth a damn.
And I'm an anthropologist named Lynn.

2515
02:15:33,661 --> 02:15:34,494
Isabelle did a comprehensive study 
worldwide trying to account for the 

2516
02:15:37,261 --> 02:15:38,094
acuity of primate vision.
And what she found was that the more 

2517
02:15:40,741 --> 02:15:41,574
predatory snakes in the vicinity,
the sharper the eyesight of the 

2518
02:15:43,711 --> 02:15:47,580
primates,
and so we have a really sharp eyesight,

2519
02:15:47,790 --> 02:15:51,240
so that means a lot of us were eaten by 
snakes and none of your ancestors,

2520
02:15:51,241 --> 02:15:53,340
fortunately because otherwise you 
wouldn't be here,

2521
02:15:53,341 --> 02:15:58,341
but a lot of those who fell by the 
wayside were snake snack and you know,

2522
02:15:59,280 --> 02:16:03,510
when you're little and living in a tree,
a snake is no damn joke.

2523
02:16:03,511 --> 02:16:04,344
And even now with lots of people get 
bitten by snakes and people are phobic 

2524
02:16:06,841 --> 02:16:11,130
of snakes at quite a rate.
And some of that actually seems innate.

2525
02:16:11,580 --> 02:16:14,250
There's arguments about cycling between 
psychologists about this,

2526
02:16:14,251 --> 02:16:16,920
but even the ones who don't accept the 
fact that it's innate,

2527
02:16:17,250 --> 02:16:18,083
except the fact that you can make 
someone afraid of a snake by 

2528
02:16:20,971 --> 02:16:21,804
conditioning just like that,
we're trying to make them afraid of a 

2529
02:16:24,121 --> 02:16:26,700
flower by conditioning is really,
really hard.

2530
02:16:27,180 --> 02:16:32,170
So we're at least at minimum prepared to
be afraid of snakes minimum.

2531
02:16:32,350 --> 02:16:34,240
And I believe it's.
I don't,

2532
02:16:34,241 --> 02:16:37,120
I believe that fear is actually innate,
although you can learn to control it.

2533
02:16:37,600 --> 02:16:38,433
So anyways,
so that's that story and like what a 

2534
02:16:40,991 --> 02:16:43,120
story man,
so amazing,

2535
02:16:43,630 --> 02:16:44,463
amazing story.
You see the Dan of the dragon here is 

2536
02:16:46,841 --> 02:16:49,210
littered with skulls and bones.
That's what that is.

2537
02:16:49,211 --> 02:16:50,530
So the,
the thing is no joke,

2538
02:16:50,590 --> 02:16:53,410
it's like look the hell out and that's 
this,

2539
02:16:53,411 --> 02:16:54,244
you know,
and look it up on the top right hand 

2540
02:16:55,991 --> 02:16:57,550
corner there.
You know,

2541
02:16:57,670 --> 02:16:59,020
that's from Peter Pan,
right?

2542
02:16:59,320 --> 02:17:00,610
All you remember,
Captain Hook,

2543
02:17:00,611 --> 02:17:01,444
we talked about him already.
He's a tyrant and he's a tyrant because 

2544
02:17:04,420 --> 02:17:07,330
he's afraid of death and that's all he 
sees in life.

2545
02:17:07,331 --> 02:17:11,000
And so it makes them cruel and bitter 
and death has already taken part of it,

2546
02:17:11,001 --> 02:17:11,834
right?
That's why he has a hook and that damn 

2547
02:17:12,851 --> 02:17:14,260
crocodile's chasing him,
tick,

2548
02:17:14,290 --> 02:17:14,860
tick,
tick,

2549
02:17:14,860 --> 02:17:18,670
tick all the time.
And of course that's the same situation.

2550
02:17:18,671 --> 02:17:19,540
You're all in,
man.

2551
02:17:19,541 --> 02:17:20,374
There's a crocodile with a clock in its 
stomach chasing you and it could easily 

2552
02:17:23,621 --> 02:17:24,454
turn you into a tyrant.
It can turn you into a tyrant or a 

2553
02:17:26,951 --> 02:17:30,280
cowering victim or a hero.
Those are the options fundamentally.

2554
02:17:30,790 --> 02:17:34,240
So that's the Gorgon looking at her own,
the Medusa,

2555
02:17:34,241 --> 02:17:35,800
looking at her own reflection,
you know,

2556
02:17:35,801 --> 02:17:37,870
mother nature with a head full of 
snakes,

2557
02:17:37,871 --> 02:17:38,704
you know,
a terrifying vision and that's actually 

2558
02:17:40,271 --> 02:17:44,420
to some degree in archetype that men get
confused with women and you know,

2559
02:17:44,430 --> 02:17:47,830
that's the witchy part of women and 
that's the part that's attractive,

2560
02:17:47,860 --> 02:17:48,880
attractive,
attractive,

2561
02:17:48,881 --> 02:17:50,680
but rejecting,
rejecting,

2562
02:17:50,681 --> 02:17:51,340
rejecting.

2563
02:17:51,340 --> 02:17:55,630
It's so many men are petrified by women.
They won't approach them at all.

2564
02:17:55,780 --> 02:17:56,613
They have no idea how to talk to them.
They're just petrified into immobility 

2565
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:01,870
and that's way more common than you 
think.

2566
02:18:02,050 --> 02:18:04,750
And so that breeds resentment.
Like you wouldn't believe,

2567
02:18:04,780 --> 02:18:07,470
you know,
you'll hear the guy who shot up like,

2568
02:18:07,650 --> 02:18:09,310
um,
Dawson College.

2569
02:18:09,311 --> 02:18:10,144
It's like,
what the hell do you think motivated 

2570
02:18:10,901 --> 02:18:12,680
him?
It's like he,

2571
02:18:12,720 --> 02:18:16,310
he,
that's what he saw and it was because as

2572
02:18:16,311 --> 02:18:19,270
well he was,
my opinion is he was too goddamn useless

2573
02:18:19,271 --> 02:18:20,104
to be attractive to anyone.
And so that's a hell of a place to be 

2574
02:18:22,781 --> 02:18:23,980
in.
You know,

2575
02:18:24,310 --> 02:18:25,600
it's,
that's the problem too.

2576
02:18:25,601 --> 02:18:27,460
If you're chronically rejected by 
people,

2577
02:18:27,580 --> 02:18:29,890
it's often because of your own 
insufficiencies,

2578
02:18:30,370 --> 02:18:31,203
you know,
whether that's cowardice or lack of 

2579
02:18:32,411 --> 02:18:33,244
social skills or whatever it is.
It's like you can't just brush it off 

2580
02:18:36,071 --> 02:18:36,371
as,
oh,

2581
02:18:36,371 --> 02:18:37,001
well,
you know,

2582
02:18:37,001 --> 02:18:38,920
no one likes me,
but really I'm okay.

2583
02:18:39,070 --> 02:18:39,903
It's like,
no,

2584
02:18:40,120 --> 02:18:41,650
no,
wrong.

2585
02:18:41,710 --> 02:18:42,543
If everyone rejects you,
there's probably something wrong and 

2586
02:18:45,281 --> 02:18:48,640
it's probably deep and difficult and 
it's gonna be horrible to fix.

2587
02:18:48,970 --> 02:18:51,610
And so it's,
this isn't a trivial problem.

2588
02:18:51,790 --> 02:18:55,030
It's not a trivial problem at all.
And so,

2589
02:18:55,031 --> 02:18:56,800
you know,
that's mother nature for men too,

2590
02:18:56,801 --> 02:18:59,530
because from the sexual selection point 
of view,

2591
02:18:59,950 --> 02:19:02,770
if they,
if they're not selected as a mate,

2592
02:19:03,940 --> 02:19:07,750
nature has taken them out of the game.
Right?

2593
02:19:07,990 --> 02:19:08,771
And so,
you know,

2594
02:19:08,771 --> 02:19:11,350
people don't really like that.
They're not that happy without.

2595
02:19:11,380 --> 02:19:14,950
And so by getting all whiny about it and
then getting violent is like,

2596
02:19:15,340 --> 02:19:18,100
that's just not all.
Not really very helpful.

2597
02:19:18,101 --> 02:19:22,090
Although it's very common.
So this is Lynn,

2598
02:19:22,091 --> 02:19:24,790
Isabelle,
and evolutionary arms race between early

2599
02:19:24,791 --> 02:19:25,624
snakes and mammals triggered the 
development of improved and large brain 

2600
02:19:28,640 --> 02:19:29,473
in primates.
A radical new theory suggests these are 

2601
02:19:31,431 --> 02:19:32,720
old representations.

2602
02:19:32,870 --> 02:19:34,550
I really liked this one.
This is.

2603
02:19:35,260 --> 02:19:37,220
I don't remember.
I think it's Greek,

2604
02:19:37,910 --> 02:19:40,220
but it doesn't exactly look Greek.
It might be older.

2605
02:19:40,580 --> 02:19:41,690
It doesn't matter.
Anyways.

2606
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:45,230
You see it's the same thing.
Same ideas as as Graham's dream,

2607
02:19:45,231 --> 02:19:46,064
right?
It's like there's this thing that 

2608
02:19:47,001 --> 02:19:47,661
exists,
this,

2609
02:19:47,661 --> 02:19:51,080
this multi-headed snake,
and it's got this infinity problem.

2610
02:19:51,081 --> 02:19:53,120
It's everywhere.
That's that little circle down there,

2611
02:19:53,270 --> 02:19:55,280
and the problem is,
well,

2612
02:19:55,310 --> 02:19:56,720
what do you do with it?
You cut off one head,

2613
02:19:56,721 --> 02:19:57,740
seven more.
Grow.

2614
02:19:58,250 --> 02:20:02,960
That's the eternal problem of life.
And the problem is they're there.

2615
02:20:03,170 --> 02:20:07,670
There is the category of problems in 
life and it ain't going anywhere.

2616
02:20:07,730 --> 02:20:08,563
And so the question is,
can you deal with the whole category at 

2617
02:20:11,301 --> 02:20:13,940
the same time?
That's the thing.

2618
02:20:13,941 --> 02:20:17,720
That's how to be in the world is to deal
with that category all at the same time.

2619
02:20:17,900 --> 02:20:19,700
And so how did,
how did human beings,

2620
02:20:20,060 --> 02:20:21,920
what did they come up with as a 
solution?

2621
02:20:21,920 --> 02:20:22,753
And that's so cool too,
because the solution they come up with 

2622
02:20:25,130 --> 02:20:29,180
not only was the heroism that allows you
to approach what you're terrified by and

2623
02:20:29,181 --> 02:20:31,550
what you find offensive and to learn 
from it,

2624
02:20:32,210 --> 02:20:36,200
but also the idea of sacrifice and that 
was played out by cultures everywhere,

2625
02:20:36,260 --> 02:20:38,360
including human sacrifice.
And you think,

2626
02:20:38,361 --> 02:20:41,300
what the hell was up with those crazy 
bastard so long ago?

2627
02:20:41,301 --> 02:20:43,520
They were sacrificing to God's all the 
time.

2628
02:20:43,760 --> 02:20:44,593
What kind of clueless behavior was that?
Burned something and please God burned 

2629
02:20:48,771 --> 02:20:51,470
something valuable and please God.
It's like,

2630
02:20:52,010 --> 02:20:54,140
what was with that?
What were they thinking?

2631
02:20:54,620 --> 02:20:56,180
Well,
they weren't stupid.

2632
02:20:56,181 --> 02:20:57,890
Those people,
if they were stupid,

2633
02:20:57,891 --> 02:20:59,840
we wouldn't be here.
They were not stupid.

2634
02:20:59,841 --> 02:21:00,674
And believe me,
they lived under a lot harsher 

2635
02:21:02,151 --> 02:21:05,480
conditions than we do.
So those were some tough people,

2636
02:21:05,481 --> 02:21:06,530
man.
You know,

2637
02:21:06,680 --> 02:21:08,990
back then you'd last about 15 minutes.

2638
02:21:09,050 --> 02:21:13,070
So you don't want to be thinking of your
ancestors as stupid,

2639
02:21:13,150 --> 02:21:13,983
like there's no real evidence that we're
much different cognitively than we were 

2640
02:21:16,461 --> 02:21:19,760
150,000 years ago.
So anyways,

2641
02:21:20,570 --> 02:21:22,220
sacrifice.
What does that mean?

2642
02:21:22,221 --> 02:21:23,240
Sacrifice?
Well,

2643
02:21:23,720 --> 02:21:26,660
it's a discovery man.
It's the discovery of the future.

2644
02:21:26,990 --> 02:21:27,823
It's like the future is actually the 
place where there is threat and it's 

2645
02:21:31,551 --> 02:21:33,200
always gonna be there.
So what do you do?

2646
02:21:33,650 --> 02:21:37,370
You make sacrifices in the present so 
that the future is better,

2647
02:21:38,180 --> 02:21:40,280
right?
Everyone does that.

2648
02:21:40,281 --> 02:21:42,920
That's what you're doing right now.
That's what you're doing here.

2649
02:21:42,921 --> 02:21:43,754
That's what your parents are doing.
When they pay money to send you to 

2650
02:21:45,351 --> 02:21:46,184
university,
they think let you can bargain with 

2651
02:21:48,531 --> 02:21:50,930
reality.
It's amazing.

2652
02:21:50,931 --> 02:21:51,764
You can bargain with reality.
You can forestall gratification now and 

2653
02:21:56,541 --> 02:21:57,374
it'll pay off it at it,
at a place in time that doesn't even 

2654
02:21:59,811 --> 02:22:01,970
exist yet.
It's like,

2655
02:22:02,210 --> 02:22:03,620
who wouldn't believe that?

2656
02:22:03,650 --> 02:22:04,483
It's like that's a miracle that that 
occurs and it's not like people just 

2657
02:22:07,131 --> 02:22:09,280
figured that overnight,
you know,

2658
02:22:09,350 --> 02:22:12,380
we were champs for Christ's sake.
Like how are we going to come up with an

2659
02:22:12,381 --> 02:22:14,450
idea like that?
While it's like,

2660
02:22:14,570 --> 02:22:17,960
well we thought about it for 7 million 
years and you know,

2661
02:22:18,170 --> 02:22:20,360
we got to the point where we could kind 
of act it out,

2662
02:22:20,930 --> 02:22:24,220
but we didn't know what we were doing,
but it was a emerge.

2663
02:22:24,230 --> 02:22:25,063
It's like a dream.
It was so the terror of the future is a 

2664
02:22:27,811 --> 02:22:32,520
dream and the solution to the terror,
the dream of the terror of the future is

2665
02:22:32,521 --> 02:22:34,370
another dream and,
and it,

2666
02:22:34,520 --> 02:22:35,353
it comes out in mythology and in fantasy
and in drama where you act out the 

2667
02:22:39,211 --> 02:22:43,080
sacrifice and then it's a step on the 
way to full understanding.

2668
02:22:43,380 --> 02:22:46,170
So we can say sacrifice now instead of 
doing it,

2669
02:22:46,470 --> 02:22:47,790
you know,
although we still do it,

2670
02:22:47,970 --> 02:22:50,160
it's just not concretized like it used 
to be.

2671
02:22:51,030 --> 02:22:55,020
We do it abstractly and we all have 
faith that it will work,

2672
02:22:55,550 --> 02:22:56,383
you know,
and we also set up our society so that 

2673
02:22:57,781 --> 02:22:59,520
it'll work.
And one thing about,

2674
02:22:59,910 --> 02:23:00,743
you know,
I'm not a fan of moral relativism for a 

2675
02:23:03,931 --> 02:23:06,320
variety of reasons,
partly because I think it's an,

2676
02:23:06,360 --> 02:23:09,510
it's an extreme form of cowardice.
But anyways,

2677
02:23:09,511 --> 02:23:11,490
apart from that,
no,

2678
02:23:11,491 --> 02:23:12,150
no,
no,

2679
02:23:12,150 --> 02:23:14,070
no.
There's minimal ways that you can set up

2680
02:23:14,071 --> 02:23:14,904
a society that will work.
And so one of them is that this society 

2681
02:23:18,481 --> 02:23:19,314
has to be set up so that your sacrifices
will pay off or you won't work and then 

2682
02:23:23,461 --> 02:23:26,910
the society will die.
And so it has to make promises.

2683
02:23:27,030 --> 02:23:28,740
People have to make promises to one 
another,

2684
02:23:28,860 --> 02:23:29,693
and that's what money is.
Money is a promise that your sacrifice 

2685
02:23:32,821 --> 02:23:35,640
will pay off in the future.
That's what money is.

2686
02:23:36,120 --> 02:23:40,950
And so if the society is stable,
you can store up your work right now.

2687
02:23:41,340 --> 02:23:46,340
You can sacrifice your impulses and you 
can work and you can store up credit for

2688
02:23:47,371 --> 02:23:50,160
the future and then you can make the 
future a better place.

2689
02:23:50,161 --> 02:23:53,310
But society has to be stable enough to 
allow for that.

2690
02:23:53,850 --> 02:23:54,683
Hyperinflation will do you in.
So the promise that's implicit in the 

2691
02:23:57,991 --> 02:24:02,040
currency is the promise that what you're
doing now will pay off in the future.

2692
02:24:02,310 --> 02:24:03,143
And if people don't have that promise,
then well we know what they do because 

2693
02:24:06,511 --> 02:24:08,220
in in gangs,
for example,

2694
02:24:08,221 --> 02:24:09,054
and say gangs in North America,
the time horizon of the gang members 

2695
02:24:11,941 --> 02:24:14,460
shrinks rapidly because they don't 
really expect to be alive,

2696
02:24:14,500 --> 02:24:15,333
pat much past 21.
And so they get really impulsive and 

2697
02:24:17,611 --> 02:24:19,640
violent and like,
why the hell not that's,

2698
02:24:19,810 --> 02:24:23,490
that's what you do when,
when the future doesn't matter,

2699
02:24:23,550 --> 02:24:27,450
when it's not real,
you default back to living in the moment

2700
02:24:27,451 --> 02:24:28,284
and you take what you can get right now 
and no wonder because you don't know if 

2701
02:24:31,081 --> 02:24:35,250
you're going to be around in a,
in a year and you get whatever you can.

2702
02:24:35,251 --> 02:24:38,970
Well you can bloody well get it.
And that's like anarchy that state.

2703
02:24:39,300 --> 02:24:40,133
And so you don't want to live in.
Some people like to live in that state 

2704
02:24:41,881 --> 02:24:43,650
because they're already wired for that,
you know?

2705
02:24:44,040 --> 02:24:44,873
And so they're,
they're much more comfortable in those 

2706
02:24:47,371 --> 02:24:48,260
conditions.
They're,

2707
02:24:48,830 --> 02:24:51,600
they're kind of like warrior types,
I would say in some sets.

2708
02:24:51,601 --> 02:24:52,434
But you know,
for most people that's just where that 

2709
02:24:56,100 --> 02:24:57,500
stress,
we'll just do 10,

2710
02:24:57,560 --> 02:24:59,160
you know,
the stress of a life like that.

2711
02:24:59,610 --> 02:25:00,443
So

2712
02:25:03,360 --> 02:25:05,640
that's a pretty horrible picture.
The one on the right I think,

2713
02:25:05,641 --> 02:25:06,474
and you know,
it's creepy picture and don't you think 

2714
02:25:09,430 --> 02:25:11,220
doesn't,
it seems like a creepy picture to me.

2715
02:25:11,610 --> 02:25:13,810
Yeah.
And so that's quit silicone oil,

2716
02:25:13,820 --> 02:25:15,240
if I remember correctly.
He was an,

2717
02:25:15,270 --> 02:25:17,970
he was an Aztec Dragon,
God,

2718
02:25:18,560 --> 02:25:20,480
and that's the eye of horus.
By what?

2719
02:25:20,500 --> 02:25:21,820
By the way,
this little thing here,

2720
02:25:21,821 --> 02:25:24,340
and I'm that.
See the Egyptians?

2721
02:25:24,341 --> 02:25:27,130
They worshiped the I.
Yeah.

2722
02:25:27,131 --> 02:25:28,360
Well that's cool because it.
Well,

2723
02:25:28,390 --> 02:25:29,890
why did they worship the eye?
Well,

2724
02:25:29,950 --> 02:25:33,370
wake the hell up and look at the world.
That's your salvation to do that.

2725
02:25:33,430 --> 02:25:34,263
Pay Bloody attention,
especially to the things you don't want 

2726
02:25:36,251 --> 02:25:37,084
to pay attention to and use your vision.
Have some vision and you can use your 

2727
02:25:41,441 --> 02:25:44,320
vision to see into the future and that 
is your.

2728
02:25:44,800 --> 02:25:46,930
That's your redemption.
And the Egyptians,

2729
02:25:47,230 --> 02:25:48,063
they didn't know how to say that,
but they knew how to represent it and 

2730
02:25:51,581 --> 02:25:52,810
that's how they represented it.

2731
02:25:52,840 --> 02:25:55,240
Like the pupil on that as completely 
open,

2732
02:25:55,300 --> 02:25:57,280
completely dilated.
And that's a god.

2733
02:25:57,281 --> 02:25:59,680
As far as the Egyptians were concerned,
it's horace.

2734
02:25:59,681 --> 02:26:01,570
And I'll tell you a horror story at some
point.

2735
02:26:02,080 --> 02:26:04,930
So early primates develop a better eye 
for color,

2736
02:26:04,931 --> 02:26:07,810
detail and movement and the ability to 
see in three dimensions,

2737
02:26:08,050 --> 02:26:10,660
traits that are important for detecting 
threats at close range.

2738
02:26:10,661 --> 02:26:13,390
Humans are descended from these same 
primates.

2739
02:26:14,550 --> 02:26:18,620
Alright,
so now the initiation way,

2740
02:26:18,730 --> 02:26:22,300
when you go into psychotherapy or when 
you make any supreme moral effort,

2741
02:26:22,510 --> 02:26:23,343
which is roughly the same thing,
you have to confront that which you do 

2742
02:26:26,951 --> 02:26:27,784
not know.
Now I mentioned the cat called Primo 

2743
02:26:30,191 --> 02:26:33,250
cosmo going to chaos and the idea that 
at the end of [inaudible] life,

2744
02:26:33,251 --> 02:26:36,640
he sort of thought of the unconscious 
and the world as the same and you think,

2745
02:26:36,641 --> 02:26:38,860
what the hell does that mean?
But here's what it means.

2746
02:26:39,520 --> 02:26:40,353
So let's say you're in a longterm 
intimate relationship and you get 

2747
02:26:42,311 --> 02:26:44,260
betrayed.
Okay?

2748
02:26:44,261 --> 02:26:49,261
So what is it that you see when you see 
your partner at the moment,

2749
02:26:49,480 --> 02:26:52,120
you know of the betrayal?
Well,

2750
02:26:52,480 --> 02:26:55,630
you see the pre cosmogony chaos and 
here's why.

2751
02:26:56,680 --> 02:27:00,910
Well it rattles your unconscious up 
because you don't know anything anymore.

2752
02:27:01,240 --> 02:27:03,610
You don't know what the past was,
right?

2753
02:27:03,611 --> 02:27:04,444
You don't know what it was and it's 
supposed to be real and all of a sudden 

2754
02:27:06,851 --> 02:27:10,090
you don't know what it was.
And so you come up with wild ideas about

2755
02:27:10,091 --> 02:27:12,670
what it might have been and what it 
represented,

2756
02:27:12,671 --> 02:27:14,890
and then you don't know what the future 
is going to be anymore.

2757
02:27:15,130 --> 02:27:15,963
So then your fantasy fills that space 
and you don't know who the hell you're 

2758
02:27:18,521 --> 02:27:20,350
looking at.
That's for sure.

2759
02:27:20,351 --> 02:27:21,184
And you don't know much about human 
beings and you certainly don't know 

2760
02:27:23,231 --> 02:27:24,400
anything about yourself.

2761
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:25,833
And so all of a sudden,
not only is everything in chaos inside 

2762
02:27:28,931 --> 02:27:29,764
your mind,
but everything is in chaos in your 

2763
02:27:31,301 --> 02:27:33,430
world.
And it actually is.

2764
02:27:33,431 --> 02:27:35,800
And there's no telling the difference 
between those two things.

2765
02:27:36,160 --> 02:27:39,250
You know.
And so then you're just sheer shattered.

2766
02:27:39,430 --> 02:27:42,670
And so then you go talk to a therapist 
for like two years and you think,

2767
02:27:42,990 --> 02:27:45,940
what happened?
What was the reality?

2768
02:27:46,210 --> 02:27:49,860
And the reality is because who knows 
what the reality was like.

2769
02:27:49,990 --> 02:27:50,823
But as far as you're concerned,
the reality is I better represent this 

2770
02:27:53,291 --> 02:27:57,010
properly in my head.
I better figure out who I was,

2771
02:27:57,011 --> 02:27:59,740
who that person was,
what we did together,

2772
02:27:59,980 --> 02:28:00,813
and what it meant.
Because I do not want this to happen 

2773
02:28:03,580 --> 02:28:07,780
again.
And so you're healed when you get to the

2774
02:28:07,781 --> 02:28:11,590
point where you've grasped the bloody 
moral of the story,

2775
02:28:11,770 --> 02:28:16,090
what went wrong and how can I not have 
that happen again?

2776
02:28:16,240 --> 02:28:17,950
Because that's the purpose of learning,
right?

2777
02:28:18,220 --> 02:28:19,053
That's the purpose of memory.
It's to prepare you for the future and 

2778
02:28:22,461 --> 02:28:26,270
so you have to pull out of that massive 
chaos,

2779
02:28:26,420 --> 02:28:30,920
a functional representation that 
increases your wisdom so that you're not

2780
02:28:31,190 --> 02:28:32,023
this naive target.
The next time you enter into a 

2781
02:28:33,711 --> 02:28:34,544
relationship,
so at least you can have another 

2782
02:28:36,051 --> 02:28:40,080
relationship without being so 
traumatized that you know you,

2783
02:28:40,160 --> 02:28:40,993
you're done and you know it can take 
people years to talk that through 

2784
02:28:43,791 --> 02:28:48,620
because this landscape of potential 
opens up when when they're betrayed,

2785
02:28:48,621 --> 02:28:51,200
it's like anything could have been the 
truth.

2786
02:28:51,740 --> 02:28:56,740
Well you to sort through that,
you have to wander through all that mess

2787
02:28:57,200 --> 02:28:59,930
and it's really painful and emotional as
well.

2788
02:29:00,110 --> 02:29:04,190
You have to sort through all that mess 
to come out with the new you,

2789
02:29:04,310 --> 02:29:06,740
right?
The renewed you and so

2790
02:29:08,560 --> 02:29:11,680
well this is a representation of it.
This is how people act this out.

2791
02:29:12,670 --> 02:29:15,480
By whatever method he may have been 
designated.

2792
02:29:15,490 --> 02:29:16,323
The Shaman is recognized as such as only
after having received two methods of 

2793
02:29:20,111 --> 02:29:23,080
instruction.
The first is ecstatic dreams.

2794
02:29:23,081 --> 02:29:23,914
Trances envisions.
The second is traditional shamonic 

2795
02:29:26,261 --> 02:29:28,330
techniques,
names and functions of the spirit,

2796
02:29:28,360 --> 02:29:31,780
mythology and genealogy of the clan,
and the secret language.

2797
02:29:31,930 --> 02:29:33,250
Well,
one of the things that happens,

2798
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:36,930
this happens to you even if,
if you encounter something terrible like

2799
02:29:36,950 --> 02:29:37,783
could be trail.
What happens is that you have to take a 

2800
02:29:39,881 --> 02:29:43,150
journey into the domain of morality 
essentially,

2801
02:29:43,151 --> 02:29:43,871
which is,
well,

2802
02:29:43,871 --> 02:29:44,704
how did I act and how did that person to
act and how should have they acted and 

2803
02:29:47,771 --> 02:29:49,210
how should have I acted,
and so,

2804
02:29:49,450 --> 02:29:51,910
and that's part of your cultural 
structure.

2805
02:29:52,360 --> 02:29:55,600
And so that's the idea of rescuing the 
dead father from the depths.

2806
02:29:55,601 --> 02:29:56,434
Right?
And that's what we'll show you some 

2807
02:29:57,251 --> 02:29:59,050
examples of that.
So

2808
02:30:02,440 --> 02:30:05,620
this is a critical issue with regards to
the shamanic transformation,

2809
02:30:05,621 --> 02:30:07,420
is that people go through these 
terrible,

2810
02:30:07,780 --> 02:30:10,960
terrible experiences,
often drug induced by the way,

2811
02:30:10,961 --> 02:30:11,794
with regards to the sharp,
and they usually use psychedelic 

2812
02:30:13,271 --> 02:30:15,520
chemicals of one form or another,
often mushrooms.

2813
02:30:15,521 --> 02:30:16,354
But uh,
but they've come up with some very 

2814
02:30:17,321 --> 02:30:18,154
strange concoctions like Iowasca down in
the Amazon and Iowasca has an amazing 

2815
02:30:22,301 --> 02:30:23,134
substance.
It's made out of the bark of one thing 

2816
02:30:25,360 --> 02:30:26,193
and another plant whose name I don't 
remember that hardly even grow in the 

2817
02:30:29,771 --> 02:30:34,771
same place and that has to be cooked 
together in a special way and no one has

2818
02:30:34,811 --> 02:30:37,270
any idea how the damn Amazonians figured
that out.

2819
02:30:37,271 --> 02:30:39,400
It looks impossible.
And if you ask them,

2820
02:30:39,401 --> 02:30:39,941
they say,
well,

2821
02:30:39,941 --> 02:30:43,780
the plants told us how to do it,
which was western people don't find very

2822
02:30:43,781 --> 02:30:46,120
helpful,
but the Germans are perfectly healthy,

2823
02:30:46,180 --> 02:30:47,013
happy with that.
That description in Iowasca takes them 

2824
02:30:49,511 --> 02:30:50,344
apart and it does that in part because 
it's effects the serotonergic system 

2825
02:30:53,351 --> 02:30:55,030
very,
very powerfully,

2826
02:30:55,031 --> 02:30:55,864
like all psychedelics do and it 
transports them to another world and 

2827
02:31:00,071 --> 02:31:01,390
that's how they interpret it.
And,

2828
02:31:01,870 --> 02:31:02,800
and,
and,

2829
02:31:04,060 --> 02:31:04,893
and what we know about psychedelics,
you can put it in a thimble and then 

2830
02:31:07,031 --> 02:31:10,090
throw the thimble away.
We know nothing about psychedelics.

2831
02:31:10,510 --> 02:31:13,300
There's new experiments going on at 
Johns Hopkins,

2832
02:31:13,301 --> 02:31:15,180
for example,
with Psilocybin,

2833
02:31:15,190 --> 02:31:18,190
which is part of this active chemical in
magic mushrooms.

2834
02:31:18,430 --> 02:31:19,263
Same structure.
Basically as LSD and masculine and all 

2835
02:31:21,361 --> 02:31:22,194
the real psychedelics have basically the
same structure except the one that's 

2836
02:31:25,051 --> 02:31:25,884
derived from m Anita area,
which is called muscular enoch acid and 

2837
02:31:28,411 --> 02:31:29,244
it's a.
it's its own weird thing that no one 

2838
02:31:30,601 --> 02:31:32,510
knows anything about.
Anyways.

2839
02:31:32,520 --> 02:31:37,520
They have profound neurochemical effects
in very small doses and I'm the research

2840
02:31:37,681 --> 02:31:41,520
group at Johns Hopkins has given 
Psilocybin to research subjects,

2841
02:31:41,640 --> 02:31:42,473
you know,
purified been because they started the 

2842
02:31:44,101 --> 02:31:48,330
new experimentation with psychedelics 
and that's been banned for like 40 years

2843
02:31:48,800 --> 02:31:49,633
because psychedelics were so terrifying 
to our culture that we just put them 

2844
02:31:51,901 --> 02:31:53,400
away and it's like,
oh no,

2845
02:31:53,401 --> 02:31:54,390
we're not going there.

2846
02:31:54,720 --> 02:31:59,010
And so even from a research perspective 
and even though some of the psychedelics

2847
02:31:59,011 --> 02:31:59,844
look very promising for the treatment of
disorders like alcoholism and they 

2848
02:32:02,521 --> 02:32:06,630
recently used psilocybin to help people 
stop smoking down at Johns Hopkins and I

2849
02:32:06,631 --> 02:32:08,490
think they had an 80 percent success 
rate,

2850
02:32:08,491 --> 02:32:12,030
which is just like,
that's just absolutely mind boggling and

2851
02:32:12,031 --> 02:32:12,864
so.
But if you give people psilocybin and 

2852
02:32:14,401 --> 02:32:15,234
they have a mystical experience,
which is very common among people who 

2853
02:32:18,001 --> 02:32:18,834
take these sorts of chemicals,
then their personality transforms 

2854
02:32:21,990 --> 02:32:26,310
permanently such that one year later 
they're one standard deviation,

2855
02:32:26,311 --> 02:32:27,144
higher in openness and openness is the 
creativity dimension and that seems to 

2856
02:32:30,781 --> 02:32:33,600
be a permanent transformation.
And so that's really remarkable.

2857
02:32:33,601 --> 02:32:34,434
And about 80 percent of the people who 
undergo the Johns Hopkins Experiments 

2858
02:32:38,731 --> 02:32:39,564
report that the experience is like one 
of the two or three most important 

2859
02:32:42,091 --> 02:32:44,910
things they've ever.
That's never ever happened to them.

2860
02:32:45,300 --> 02:32:47,070
And so.
Well that's,

2861
02:32:47,270 --> 02:32:48,240
that's something,
you know,

2862
02:32:48,241 --> 02:32:49,074
it's like.
And then there's this guy named Rick 

2863
02:32:50,581 --> 02:32:51,414
straussman down at,
I think it was at the University of 

2864
02:32:53,610 --> 02:32:56,040
Texas and he did experimentation with 
DMT,

2865
02:32:56,270 --> 02:32:57,103
dmt,
dimethyltryptamine I remember if I 

2866
02:32:59,160 --> 02:32:59,993
remember correctly,
is the active ingredient in Iowasca and 

2867
02:33:02,611 --> 02:33:04,980
you produce it in your brain and it's in
plants.

2868
02:33:04,981 --> 02:33:05,814
It's like a very common chemical.
But DMT is a weird hallucinogen because 

2869
02:33:09,721 --> 02:33:12,480
it has an extraordinary short mechanism 
of action.

2870
02:33:12,481 --> 02:33:13,314
It's like,
and people who take it report that 

2871
02:33:15,260 --> 02:33:18,780
they're blasted out of their body,
like out of a cannon.

2872
02:33:18,990 --> 02:33:19,823
And then they go out somewhere and 
encounter beings of various sorts and 

2873
02:33:24,241 --> 02:33:28,170
then 10 minutes later they're back and 
virtually everyone reports that,

2874
02:33:28,171 --> 02:33:29,360
which is really strange.
And,

2875
02:33:29,700 --> 02:33:30,533
and so strassman was giving people dmt 
intravenously so that the trip would 

2876
02:33:34,831 --> 02:33:35,960
last longer.
He could,

2877
02:33:36,030 --> 02:33:37,080
this was all,
all,

2878
02:33:37,140 --> 02:33:38,400
you know,
nih funded,

2879
02:33:38,760 --> 02:33:39,593
uh,
experimentation all cleared with the 

2880
02:33:40,831 --> 02:33:43,550
relevant ethics boards all conducted 
within the last 10 years.

2881
02:33:43,550 --> 02:33:47,610
And he basically quit doing it because 
he was a pretty straight scientists,

2882
02:33:47,611 --> 02:33:48,444
you know,
who he was measuring heart rate and 

2883
02:33:49,141 --> 02:33:52,200
pulse and all that sort of thing,
trying to look at the physiology.

2884
02:33:52,201 --> 02:33:53,034
And then the people he was giving these 
chemicals to kept coming back and 

2885
02:33:56,341 --> 02:33:58,860
telling him these,
these crazy stories.

2886
02:33:59,760 --> 02:34:02,100
And uh,
well it just,

2887
02:34:02,480 --> 02:34:03,780
it was too much for him,
you know,

2888
02:34:03,781 --> 02:34:04,950
and no wonder,
you know,

2889
02:34:05,190 --> 02:34:06,840
because they all said the same thing.
And he'd say,

2890
02:34:06,841 --> 02:34:07,710
well,
that was a dream.

2891
02:34:07,711 --> 02:34:09,690
And they'd say no.
And it was the most real thing that ever

2892
02:34:09,691 --> 02:34:10,501
happened to me.
And he'd say,

2893
02:34:10,501 --> 02:34:10,981
well,
you know,

2894
02:34:10,981 --> 02:34:12,990
it's an architectural experience.
And they'd say,

2895
02:34:13,290 --> 02:34:14,210
no,
no,

2896
02:34:14,220 --> 02:34:15,840
no.
That was no archetipal experience.

2897
02:34:15,841 --> 02:34:18,700
I went somewhere else.
And I saw things and I'm back and like,

2898
02:34:18,701 --> 02:34:21,460
I don't care what you think and like who
the hell knows?

2899
02:34:21,460 --> 02:34:22,960
Right?
Because it's all subjective.

2900
02:34:23,260 --> 02:34:24,093
But,
but the weird thing about it is that 

2901
02:34:25,241 --> 02:34:28,930
everyone's reporting the same thing.
How the hell do you account for that?

2902
02:34:29,110 --> 02:34:30,310
And then the shaman,
you know,

2903
02:34:30,311 --> 02:34:32,440
when they take these psychedelic 
chemicals,

2904
02:34:32,441 --> 02:34:34,240
they basically say the same thing.
They say,

2905
02:34:34,241 --> 02:34:36,970
well first of all,
it more or less killed me.

2906
02:34:38,140 --> 02:34:40,470
That's this.
No,

2907
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:41,393
I dissolved to skeleton.
And then I climbed a tree that Unites 

2908
02:34:44,800 --> 02:34:45,633
Heaven and earth and I went into the 
realm of the gods and they gave me some 

2909
02:34:48,071 --> 02:34:50,110
information and I'm back.
It's like,

2910
02:34:50,500 --> 02:34:51,430
okay,
well,

2911
02:34:51,490 --> 02:34:52,323
you know,
we don't really know what to make of 

2912
02:34:53,171 --> 02:34:54,220
that.
And we.

2913
02:34:54,290 --> 02:34:55,123
And certainly that's what len describes 
when he describes the MNEMONIC is 

2914
02:34:57,781 --> 02:35:01,100
romantic procession,
not the shamanic initiation.

2915
02:35:01,830 --> 02:35:02,663
There's dissolution to a skeleton first.
And then like a death is symbolic death 

2916
02:35:05,771 --> 02:35:06,604
or experienced as an actual death and 
then bang up into the realm of the gods 

2917
02:35:10,450 --> 02:35:11,470
and then they come back.

2918
02:35:12,820 --> 02:35:13,653
It's a very old idea.
And that's a medieval representation of 

2919
02:35:16,451 --> 02:35:19,420
the tunnel that people travel through at
the end of their life to,

2920
02:35:19,780 --> 02:35:20,950
you know,
to find the light,

2921
02:35:20,980 --> 02:35:23,530
which is a very common near death 
experience report.

2922
02:35:23,531 --> 02:35:24,364
And people don't have any idea what the 
hell to do with those reports except 

2923
02:35:27,190 --> 02:35:27,611
say,
well,

2924
02:35:27,611 --> 02:35:31,780
it's the paroxysms of the dying brain,
which you'd expect to be a hell of a lot

2925
02:35:31,781 --> 02:35:32,614
more random in my opinion.
And the idea is there's a rebirth after 

2926
02:35:35,531 --> 02:35:36,364
that and you know,
here this is the Scandinavian 

2927
02:35:39,551 --> 02:35:42,730
representation of that tree that unites 
Earth with heaven.

2928
02:35:43,090 --> 02:35:45,340
And so there's the Scandinavian 
representation.

2929
02:35:45,341 --> 02:35:47,830
It has a snake snakes down here eating 
it.

2930
02:35:48,040 --> 02:35:51,340
And then that's the Amazonian 
representation.

2931
02:35:51,840 --> 02:35:54,040
It's like,
how the hell do you account for that?

2932
02:35:54,250 --> 02:35:54,820
I mean,
those,

2933
02:35:54,820 --> 02:35:57,160
those pictures are so similar that it's 
just,

2934
02:35:57,820 --> 02:36:00,470
it's beyond belief.
Well,

2935
02:36:00,540 --> 02:36:02,320
you know,
we lived in trees for a long time,

2936
02:36:03,090 --> 02:36:04,330
a long,
long,

2937
02:36:04,331 --> 02:36:05,680
long,
long time,

2938
02:36:06,100 --> 02:36:06,933
millions of years,
and there were lots of snakes around 

2939
02:36:09,131 --> 02:36:09,610
them.

2940
02:36:09,610 --> 02:36:13,870
And so the idea that reality is that 
tree that's surrounded by a snake that's

2941
02:36:13,871 --> 02:36:14,531
in us,
man,

2942
02:36:14,531 --> 02:36:16,240
it's down there,
it's deep.

2943
02:36:16,270 --> 02:36:18,340
And there's something about it that's 
true,

2944
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:21,310
not true,
like we normally think of truth,

2945
02:36:21,311 --> 02:36:23,830
but truth true in an entirely different 
manner.

2946
02:36:24,580 --> 02:36:26,500
So.
And all.

2947
02:36:26,501 --> 02:36:28,480
That's pretty damn strange.
We'll stop with this.

2948
02:36:28,481 --> 02:36:30,550
My son drew this when he was seven years
old.

2949
02:36:30,910 --> 02:36:33,370
Blew me away man.
I thought it was so cool.

2950
02:36:33,371 --> 02:36:34,204
So I had it laminated.
And so here is what it is on the right 

2951
02:36:37,021 --> 02:36:38,080
hand side,
that's the order.

2952
02:36:38,590 --> 02:36:41,770
It's like the Yin Yang thing that's 
ordered left side chaos,

2953
02:36:42,220 --> 02:36:44,140
right?
And those are all mushroom houses,

2954
02:36:44,141 --> 02:36:44,974
which I thought was amazing.
And then there's this river that runs 

2955
02:36:48,701 --> 02:36:51,400
right down the middle,
like the line for order and chaos.

2956
02:36:51,550 --> 02:36:55,570
And then there's this tree that goes up 
to heaven and that's having up there.

2957
02:36:55,570 --> 02:36:57,850
It's like there St Peter,
there's the pearly gates,

2958
02:36:57,851 --> 02:36:59,610
there's the cloud.
It's like it's.

2959
02:36:59,780 --> 02:37:01,810
He never went to church,
you know,

2960
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:04,900
it's like what the hell?
And then there's a little bug there that

2961
02:37:04,901 --> 02:37:08,860
goes up and down from heaven to earth.
And that was him.

2962
02:37:09,230 --> 02:37:12,250
I thought he had a very organized 
psyche.

2963
02:37:12,251 --> 02:37:13,210
That kid,
he was a very,

2964
02:37:13,211 --> 02:37:16,550
very stable kid and still is.
And he drew that and I thought,

2965
02:37:16,940 --> 02:37:18,710
Jesus,
that's just bloody well,

2966
02:37:18,770 --> 02:37:19,603
unbelievable.
And I still think that when I look at 

2967
02:37:21,771 --> 02:37:22,604
it,
and that's a great example of an 

2968
02:37:23,931 --> 02:37:27,020
archetype.
And so we'll see you Tuesday.
