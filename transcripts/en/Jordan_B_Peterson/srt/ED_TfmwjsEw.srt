1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,003
Okay,
so today we're going to talk about 

2
00:00:02,731 --> 00:00:03,564
piaget
and piaget is a constructivist and a 

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,270
constructivist is someone who's 
attempting to answer the question,

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,213
where does your personality come from?
Now for piaget would be more something 

5
00:00:19,241 --> 00:00:22,600
like where do your models of the world 
come from,

6
00:00:22,601 --> 00:00:23,434
but his idea of model of the world is so
broad that it's perfectly reasonable to 

7
00:00:28,481 --> 00:00:29,314
use personality as a proxy,
so here's one of Piaget's initial 

8
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:34,893
propositions.
The common postulate of various 

9
00:00:37,421 --> 00:00:38,254
traditional epistemologies.
Epistemologies are theories of valid 

10
00:00:40,901 --> 00:00:41,734
knowledge is that knowledge is a fact 
and not a process and that if our 

11
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:46,504
various forms of knowledge are always 
incomplete and our various sciences 

12
00:00:49,931 --> 00:00:50,764
still imperfect,
that which is acquired is acquired and 

13
00:00:53,711 --> 00:00:54,544
can therefore be studied statically.
Hence the absolute position of the 

14
00:00:57,671 --> 00:01:00,820
problems.
What is knowledge or how are the various

15
00:01:00,821 --> 00:01:01,654
types of knowledge possible under the 
converging influence of a series of 

16
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:06,484
factors?
We're tending more and more today to 

17
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:10,150
regard knowledge as a process more than 
a state.

18
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,770
Any being or object at sciences attempt 
to hold fast dissolves.

19
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,510
Once again in the current of 
development.

20
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,083
It is the last analysis of this 
development and innovate alone that we 

21
00:01:21,101 --> 00:01:21,934
have the right to state it is a fact 
what we can and should then seek is the 

22
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:29,950
law of this process he present,
he puts in parentheses,

23
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:30,784
we are well aware of on the other hand 
of the fine book by Thomas Kuhn on 

24
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:38,350
scientific revolutions,
the first aim of genetic epistemology,

25
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,310
because that's what he called his field 
is therefore if one can say so,

26
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:43,144
to take psychology seriously and to 
furnish verifications to any question 

27
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:49,030
which each epistemology necessarily 
raises,

28
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,520
yet replacing the generally 
unsatisfying,

29
00:01:51,521 --> 00:01:52,354
speculative or implicit psychology with 
controllable analysis to know means to 

30
00:01:57,671 --> 00:02:02,170
act.
Human knowledge is essentially active to

31
00:02:02,171 --> 00:02:03,004
know is to transform reality.
In order to understand how a certain 

32
00:02:05,261 --> 00:02:08,920
state is brought about knowing an object
does not mean copying it.

33
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,023
It means acting upon it.
Knowing reality means constructing 

34
00:02:12,611 --> 00:02:13,444
systems of transformation that 
correspond more or less adequately to 

35
00:02:16,481 --> 00:02:19,660
reality.
Knowledge is a system of transformations

36
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,670
that becomes progressively adequate.

37
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,280
In fact,
if all knowledge is always in a state of

38
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:27,114
development and consists in proceeding 
from one state to a more complete 

39
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:30,804
inefficient one,
evidently it is a question of knowing 

40
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:36,330
this development and analyzing it with 
the greatest possible accuracy,

41
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,780
so here are the sorts of questions that 
piaget addressed himself to.

42
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:44,781
They're very fundamental questions upon 
what does an individual basis judgments,

43
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,463
what are his norms,
how is it that these norms are 

44
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:49,434
validated?
What's the interest of such norms for 

45
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:52,464
the philosophy of science in general,
and how does the fact that children 

46
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:59,710
think differently affect our presumption
of fact itself,

47
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:03,343
more problems?
How did children conceptualized number 

48
00:03:05,571 --> 00:03:06,404
in space and time and speed?
How do they understand that objects 

49
00:03:10,461 --> 00:03:12,590
hidden from view or actually still 
there?

50
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,053
How do they understand that entities 
that can transform from one place to 

51
00:03:18,111 --> 00:03:18,944
another are the same entities.
How do we understand chance or moral 

52
00:03:23,241 --> 00:03:25,670
concerns,
play patterns and dreams are,

53
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,563
and how do we.
How is it that we imitate others and 

54
00:03:28,731 --> 00:03:32,850
what does it mean that we can?
Now,

55
00:03:32,851 --> 00:03:36,390
here's a definition of constructivism.
This is from Piaget as well.

56
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:40,800
Knowledge does not begin in the eye and 
it does not begin in the object.

57
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:41,933
It begins in the interactions.
There's a reciprocal and simultaneous 

58
00:03:44,671 --> 00:03:47,910
construction of the subject on the one 
hand and the object on the other.

59
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,850
There is no structure apart from 
construction,

60
00:03:50,851 --> 00:03:52,440
either abstract or genetic

61
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,740
now,
so let's take some of that apart.

62
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,293
The first thing that piaget is pointing 
out is that trying to understand what 

63
00:04:03,021 --> 00:04:03,854
knowledge is by referring to a body of 
facts seems to be somewhat problematic 

64
00:04:06,771 --> 00:04:07,604
because facts shift with time and people
understand facts differently at 

65
00:04:11,661 --> 00:04:12,494
different stages of development.
Even though hypothetically we all live 

66
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:16,064
in the same world,
it turns out that we can get by in some 

67
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:22,040
sense with structures of knowledge that 
differ from one another.

68
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,113
I think the easiest way to understand 
that is actually to take something like 

69
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:26,204
a pragmatic perspective and pragmatist 
and I think piaget is a pragmatist and 

70
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,273
pragmatic.
People basically say that because 

71
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:34,574
they're interested in what constitutes 
truth and of course we know that we 

72
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:38,780
don't have absolute truth about 
anything.

73
00:04:38,781 --> 00:04:39,614
So the question is,
if you don't have absolute truth about 

74
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:42,104
anything,
how do you know when what you know is 

75
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:44,660
enough?

76
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,493
And the pragmatic answer to that is you 
set your own conditions for truth with 

77
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:52,910
each of your actions and the way you do 
that is by specifying an outcome.

78
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,870
So if you tell a joke and now outcome is
that people should laugh,

79
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,330
you know,
even if 70 percent of the people laugh,

80
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,313
then that's probably good enough.
And so you could say that you've done a 

81
00:05:02,931 --> 00:05:03,764
good enough job of matching your social 
knowledge to the circumstance to obtain 

82
00:05:06,771 --> 00:05:07,604
your desired end.
And so piaget's pig piaget's notions of 

83
00:05:11,691 --> 00:05:12,524
what constitutes knowledge,
valid knowledge structure seem to be 

84
00:05:14,611 --> 00:05:16,610
very,
very much pragmatic in origin.

85
00:05:16,611 --> 00:05:17,444
And it's also partly because piaget is a
thinker who's who's deeply considered 

86
00:05:21,741 --> 00:05:22,574
the fact of human embodiment.
And in fact I think Psja has done that 

87
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,320
more than any of the thinkers that we're
going to.

88
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,890
We're going to talk about.
And so for Piaget,

89
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,500
truth is determined inaction.

90
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,320
The next proposition is that when you're
trying to understand knowledge,

91
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:43,154
you should understand the process by 
which it's generated rather than the 

92
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:46,844
outcome of the knowledge process itself,
because the outcomes transform across 

93
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:50,774
circumstances,
but the nature of the process that you 

94
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:56,900
engage in to produce knowledge seems to 
be constant across situations.

95
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,230
So,
and what is that process?

96
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,020
Well,
that's the,

97
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,853
that's the next part of constructivism.
Piaget you can think of for Piaget in 

98
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:06,614
some sense,
the reality is a field of latent 

99
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,270
information and interacting with that 
information.

100
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:19,220
You cold some of it both physically,
physically and abstractly,

101
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:22,280
and out of that coding,
not only do you generate yourself,

102
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:26,180
but you also generate well,
if not the object itself,

103
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,850
so to speak,
at least your perceptions of the object.

104
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,970
So when you're continually engaged from 
a pig and perspective and trying to,

105
00:06:33,971 --> 00:06:34,804
uh,
trying to produce certain 

106
00:06:35,601 --> 00:06:36,434
transformations in the world and as you 
produce them in an embodied sense 

107
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:41,444
because you're acting in the world,
you map the transformations that occur 

108
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,150
onto the transformations of your body.

109
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,990
And that mapping constitutes your 
practical knowledge.

110
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,630
So for,
as I said,

111
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:58,631
for Piaget,
the body of knowledge that guides you is

112
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:00,914
always action predicated.
Now I want to provide you with another 

113
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,590
way of understanding Pha so that as we 
go through what he has to say,

114
00:07:09,591 --> 00:07:11,360
we can not only understand what he has 
to say,

115
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:13,700
but we can link it to the other things 
that we're going to talk about.

116
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,133
Now.
There's a man named Jerome Bruner who 

117
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:20,270
talked about narrative constructivism 
and Bruner said,

118
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:23,570
we seem to have no other way of 
describing live time.

119
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,583
Save in the form of a narrative.
So I'm going to review a little bit for 

120
00:07:29,001 --> 00:07:31,010
you what might constitute a basic 
narrative.

121
00:07:31,011 --> 00:07:31,844
And then I want to talk to you about the
way that narratives transformed because 

122
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:39,190
one of the PSG and propositions is that 
at a given time in development,

123
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,250
you might have a way of interacting with
the world,

124
00:07:43,251 --> 00:07:44,084
say a Schema that is good enough for the
aims that you want to pursue at that 

125
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:50,270
particular point in time.

126
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,680
But there may come a time when there are
transformations of one sort or another.

127
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,030
That could be specific to you or that 
could actually happen in the world where

128
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,450
if you continue to perceive an act in 
that manner,

129
00:08:02,451 --> 00:08:05,150
you're not going to get what you want.
And so for example,

130
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,313
one,
here's an example from a developmental 

131
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:10,610
perspective.
When you're eight years old,

132
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:13,910
it's probably okay for your mother to 
arrange play dates for you,

133
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:16,190
but if that's still happening when 
you're 15,

134
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,323
there's a problem and and so you,
you can see that the manner in which 

135
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:25,310
someone interacts with the world,
even if it's successful at one point,

136
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:26,144
isn't necessarily successful in the next
and sometimes there are qualitative 

137
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:30,524
transformations in the world.
That means that the structure that 

138
00:08:32,931 --> 00:08:33,764
you're looking at the world through has 
to reconstruct itself to take in more 

139
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:42,701
information and then you have to act out
that new body of knowledge that would be

140
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:46,160
accommodation from a pig and point of 
view.

141
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,323
Piaget assumes that there's two things 
happening when you're interacting with 

142
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:50,264
the world.
One is that your current body of 

143
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:53,294
knowledge is sufficient and all you have
to do is add to in a rail rather 

144
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:56,724
normative way.
And if any of you know anything about 

145
00:08:57,991 --> 00:08:58,824
Thomas Kuhn,
that is roughly equivalent to Thomas 

146
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,143
Kuhn's theory of normal science.
So normal science occurs when the body 

147
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:07,960
of theory within,
again,

148
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:08,903
given scientific domain is quite 
sketched out and what people are doing 

149
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:16,350
is basically mopping up the details.
So you might say that,

150
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,230
uh,
right now in personality theory,

151
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,183
the psychometric big five models are 
paradigmatic and what people are doing 

152
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:27,120
is not so much arguing about whether or 
not that structure exists,

153
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:31,920
but are arguing about something smaller,
which is what information can you derive

154
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:32,754
from the world?
If you take as your set of assumptions 

155
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:38,550
that those five dimensions exist and you
can see that that's a less comprehensive

156
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:42,270
question than do the five dimensions 
themselves exist.

157
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,283
So assimilation is when you have a 
notion of how to act in the world so 

158
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:47,970
that things happen the way you want them
to.

159
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:53,580
And you can just add more to that in an 
accommodation occurs when instead the,

160
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,403
the novelty and the transfer formations 
that you've encountered are so large 

161
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,020
that you have to reconstitute the theory
itself in order to progress.

162
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,003
So for example,
in the example I used where when you're 

163
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,730
eight or nine years old,
you can have play dates arrange,

164
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,583
but you can't when you're 15.
The reason for that is that you're 

165
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,470
undergoing a series of maturational 
changes,

166
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:17,304
a lot of a lot,
and a large number of them are 

167
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:19,974
physiological and so you have to change 
the assumptions that you use to deal 

168
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:25,854
with the world.
And so one of the prime assumptions 

169
00:10:27,121 --> 00:10:31,230
might be when you're a child that it's 
okay for one of your parents to serve as

170
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:35,550
a mediator of your social interactions,
but by the time you hit puberty,

171
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,400
then all of a sudden that becomes 
inappropriate.

172
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:40,410
And if you continue to use the same 
Schema,

173
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:41,244
then well then you're not well.
Then you're stuck at a developmental 

174
00:10:45,451 --> 00:10:46,284
stage that you shouldn't be stuck at.
That'd be roughly equivalent to Freud's 

175
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:53,100
idea of a fixation to similar idea.

176
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,353
So

177
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,433
we're going to go back to this little 
Schema here and I'm going to 

178
00:11:02,711 --> 00:11:05,950
recapitulate the idea that when you're 
looking at the world,

179
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,873
this is a pragmatic frame of reference.
It's also a cybernetic frame of 

180
00:11:09,311 --> 00:11:11,350
reference.
And I think it's one of the easiest ways

181
00:11:11,351 --> 00:11:12,184
to understand a head against Schema or 
and the beginnings of a Schemata 

182
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,713
Schemata,
sort of like an arrangement of Schemas 

183
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:24,511
and schemas are like tools to deal with 
the world and the tool that you're using

184
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:25,834
to deal with the world is the tool that 
gets you what you want when you act it 

185
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:31,210
out.
So here's some propositions with regards

186
00:11:31,211 --> 00:11:33,310
to how those scheme is might be 
formulated.

187
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,910
One is,
is that you're somewhere at some point a

188
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,660
and the next is you want some 
transformation in the world to occur.

189
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,913
Otherwise you wouldn't be acting right.
So you have some vision of the outcome 

190
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:45,970
that you wish to obtain.

191
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:49,180
And then you have a sequence of 
behaviors.

192
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,490
At the most fundamental level of 
analysis,

193
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:52,324
you have a sequence of embodied that you
can apply to the world and hopefully 

194
00:11:56,171 --> 00:11:58,450
that produces the transformation that 
you want.

195
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,960
Now you can take a page from biology and
you can say,

196
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:02,794
well,
a lot of these schemas or brief 

197
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:07,540
narratives are embedded in biological 
systems.

198
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:09,520
So for example,
if you're hungry,

199
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,800
then that's going to set up a particular
Schema.

200
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,993
And if you're thirsty,
that's going to set up a particular 

201
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:15,244
Schema and so on,
but human beings are capable of high 

202
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:21,970
levels of abstraction so that instead of
pursuing direct biological goals,

203
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,043
we can perform operations that are in 
some way conceptually linked to the 

204
00:12:26,441 --> 00:12:31,441
fulfillment of biological goals in a 
social environment across large spans of

205
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:33,544
time.
Which is a much more complicated 

206
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:35,680
question,
you know,

207
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,820
because I might say,
well,

208
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,440
why are you guys sitting here?

209
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,560
What does that have to do with 
biological necessity?

210
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,573
And the answer is,
well in some sense it's rather tenuous 

211
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:48,820
in that it's multiple stages removed 
from absolute necessity.

212
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,120
But your hypothesis is instead of 
foraging around in the frozen ground for

213
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:55,114
nuts,
it might be better to adopt a career 

214
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:02,041
because that'll solve all of your 
biological problems simultaneously.

215
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,880
And so again,
I'm going to repeat that.

216
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:08,230
So the animals problem is how to fulfill
a motivational state.

217
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:13,290
Will say your problem is how to fulfill 
multiple motivational states in a social

218
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:18,790
environment that's composed of many 
other people doing the same thing in the

219
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:21,160
short term,
the medium tournament in the longterm.

220
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,173
And you want to come up with a solution 
that will satisfy all those constraints 

221
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,193
simultaneously.
Now Piaget would regard as a solution 

222
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:32,830
like that as an equilibrium state and 
equilibrated state is,

223
00:13:32,831 --> 00:13:37,390
this is a solution that isn't producing 
anomalies,

224
00:13:37,391 --> 00:13:39,820
are novelties when it's enacted in the 
world,

225
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,193
and so it's important to understand this
because it forms part of the pig and a 

226
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,380
theory of morality.

227
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,430
Now,
piaget,

228
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,730
he was a kind of a strange guy.
He was a childhood prodigy.

229
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:56,350
He was studying animals in depth when he
was a small child.

230
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:59,320
He published his first scientific paper 
when he was 10,

231
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:00,154
which was on the behavior of mollusks,
and the next year he was offered to 

232
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:06,220
curatorship of a museum in Switzerland,
but his parents,

233
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:10,720
given his developmental stage,
had to tell the people who wanted him to

234
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:13,600
take over the curatorship,
that he was only 11 and that it probably

235
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:15,250
wouldn't be appropriate.
Now,

236
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:16,084
when Piaget was an adolescent,
he went through what you might describe 

237
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:19,864
as a messianic crisis.
He actually regarded messianism Zionism 

238
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,933
as a developmental stage that often 
characteristic characterized late 

239
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:29,860
adolescence.
And so at that stage,

240
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:30,694
people are concerned with the 
relationship between their individual 

241
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:37,630
lives in the broader social community 
and when he was in that mess scientistic

242
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,270
stage and very much concerned about 
morality,

243
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:41,104
he was also suffering from a tension 
between scientific and religious points 

244
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:46,444
of view.
And one of the things that he wanted to 

245
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:48,184
do as an adult was to reconcile values 
with science or brought more broadly 

246
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:54,380
speaking,
religion with science.

247
00:14:54,381 --> 00:14:55,214
But we'll stick to values and morality 
with science and I think he got farther 

248
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:01,400
along on that than anyone else.
House.

249
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:06,170
And the state is one of his most 
intelligent

250
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,563
proposition.
So an equilibrated state would be 

251
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,713
something like.

252
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:18,320
It could be two things,
it could be you in a happy family and it

253
00:15:18,321 --> 00:15:22,070
could be the happy family.
It depends on your level of analysis,

254
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,293
but you in a happy family are going to 
be celebrated because assuming that 

255
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,780
you're as happy as the rest of the 
family,

256
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,733
what that means is that you found a 
motive operation that simile tediously 

257
00:15:34,371 --> 00:15:37,820
works for you and for your family and a 
higher order.

258
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:41,600
Equilibrated state would be happy you in
a happy family,

259
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,880
in a happy city,
let's say,

260
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:48,680
and so there are multiple levels of 
potential equilibration and Piaget's.

261
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:49,514
One of Piaget's fundamental claims was 
that I'd equilibrated state was 

262
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,673
preferable,
so there's a value judgment there to a 

263
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,133
disintegrated state and the reason for 
that was that it took less energy per 

264
00:16:01,281 --> 00:16:04,520
unit of work to maintain an equilibrium 
state.

265
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,413
So think about it this way.
So there's family and there's family B 

266
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,493
and they're competing in a in a local 
environment and family be as very 

267
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:14,750
disharmonious.

268
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:15,823
And so in order for the family to get 
anything done or any of the individuals 

269
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:20,264
within the family,
there has to be a tremendous amount of 

270
00:16:22,011 --> 00:16:25,820
conflict.
And so the load is whatever they have to

271
00:16:25,821 --> 00:16:26,654
do,
plus the conflict they have to go 

272
00:16:28,311 --> 00:16:30,620
through in order to do it.
And in many cases,

273
00:16:30,621 --> 00:16:33,080
if the situation is disequilibrium good 
enough,

274
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,303
then the conflict that you have to go 
through to do whatever it is that you 

275
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:40,520
want to do actually requires more energy
than the thing itself.

276
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,330
And so Piaget's point was that whereas 
in a happy family will say,

277
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:48,380
and equilibrated family,
both the individuals and the family as a

278
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:52,370
unit can move forward without wasting a 
lot of time in conflict.

279
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:54,740
And so piaget's idea was that,
you know,

280
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:56,750
in a,
in a race for success,

281
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:57,584
however you happen to define success,
the equilibrated system is going to 

282
00:17:00,711 --> 00:17:01,544
outperform the district deliberated 
system because the district celebrated 

283
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:06,950
system has to waste time and energy on 
enforcement.

284
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,210
That's a lovely idea.
It's,

285
00:17:09,211 --> 00:17:12,770
it's a profound idea because what it 
does is it set up,

286
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,633
it sets up the preconditions for 
starting to understand our value 

287
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:18,230
judgements,
so to speak,

288
00:17:18,231 --> 00:17:19,064
and value judgments are outcroppings of 
theories of action because a theory of 

289
00:17:24,141 --> 00:17:26,480
action has to do with what you should 
do.

290
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:30,830
And that's a value judgment.
Piaget would say that the,

291
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:31,933
the patterns of actually the value 
judgements that lead towards a more 

292
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,940
thoroughly equilibrated state are 
better.

293
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,420
Now you can take that a bit further and 
you can say that,

294
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:46,830
and this is sort of akin to piaget's 
ideas that children go through stages of

295
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:49,770
development that are somewhat 
identifiable cultures,

296
00:17:49,771 --> 00:17:51,630
although there's a fair bit of debate 
about that.

297
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,253
It's,
it's a quite as idea jetty and notion 

298
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:56,514
that there only might be a finite number
of deliberated solutions to a set of 

299
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:00,560
given problems.

300
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,070
So you can imagine,
well,

301
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,260
you pop up on the horizon,
you're born and you're a particular kind

302
00:18:07,261 --> 00:18:08,094
of entity.
Now there are some things that you can 

303
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:10,884
do as an entity to continue your.
Your existence as an entity and there's 

304
00:18:15,331 --> 00:18:16,164
other things that you can't do.
So you're bounded by a set of 

305
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:18,924
limitations and possibilities.
One of the limitation seems to be is 

306
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:23,214
that your family has to be sufficiently 
well integrated so that you get a 

307
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,710
certain amount of attention.
So for example,

308
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,873
if babies don't get a certain amount of 
physical attention in the first year of 

309
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:33,594
their life,
so nobody literally touches them and 

310
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:36,264
plays with them,
then they'll often die because their 

311
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:43,110
gastrointestinal systems will shut down.
And even if they don't die,

312
00:18:43,111 --> 00:18:43,944
they're so impaired afterwards as a 
consequence of that lack of initial 

313
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,053
stimulation that they never recover.
And so you can see right off the bat 

314
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:52,703
that one of the preconditions for even 
for existence as a human being is that 

315
00:18:56,821 --> 00:19:00,040
you have to be born into a familial 
environment that,

316
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,150
that has certain structures in place.

317
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,250
Now some of them are obvious like,
well,

318
00:19:05,251 --> 00:19:06,084
you should be fed and you have to be fed
what you need to be fat and you have to 

319
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:13,821
be protected and sheltered and,
and you know,

320
00:19:14,941 --> 00:19:17,900
you have to be exposed to a certain 
amount of information flow and so on.

321
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:18,743
So your physical,
obvious physical needs have to be taken 

322
00:19:20,821 --> 00:19:21,654
care of.
But then there are less obvious things 

323
00:19:23,731 --> 00:19:25,950
that you need from your local 
environment,

324
00:19:25,951 --> 00:19:26,784
like physical attention,
literally touch and play and social 

325
00:19:33,031 --> 00:19:33,864
interaction and language.
Because if any of those are lacking in 

326
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:40,800
the initial developmental stages,
depends on the stage,

327
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:43,590
then you're going to be so crippled that
you won't be able to.

328
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,820
You won't be able to survive and thrive 
in the world.

329
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,313
So then you can think that you know,
imagine that there's a set of 

330
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:52,794
constraints that define the system 
within which you can thrive as an 

331
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:56,844
individual.

332
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,990
Then you might say,
well,

333
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:58,973
there's a set of constraints within 
which a family can survive as a family 

334
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:04,434
without blowing apart,
and then if you put multiple families 

335
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:08,004
together in some sort of community,
there's a set of constraints that have 

336
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:14,520
to be met for those families to live 
together in relative harmony and so on.

337
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:19,080
All the way up the levels of complexity 
and a properly equilibrated state,

338
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:19,914
as I said,
would be one where you're thriving in a 

339
00:20:21,361 --> 00:20:24,450
thriving family,
in a thriving community and so forth,

340
00:20:24,451 --> 00:20:28,110
all the way up the all the way up the 
chain of complexity.

341
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,210
So it's a very,
very,

342
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:33,840
very smart idea.
And you can also imagine that one of the

343
00:20:33,841 --> 00:20:34,674
things that that means is that 
representations of moral systems might 

344
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:43,680
have some similarities across cultures.
Now we know this is true already because

345
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:48,681
there are a number of human universals,
but if take individuals and you put them

346
00:20:49,271 --> 00:20:50,104
in geographical area a and you take 
different individuals and you put them 

347
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:56,590
in geographical area B,
because of the nature of the constraints

348
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:57,573
and the fact that there is some 
relatively limited subset of solutions 

349
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:05,800
that will satisfy everyone at each of 
those levels of analysis,

350
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,873
you're going to expect relatively 
similar moral systems to develop in 

351
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:10,690
different cultures.

352
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,140
And so it's also a powerful argument 
against moral relativism.

353
00:21:14,141 --> 00:21:14,890
Now,
you know,

354
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,620
relativism is a tricky thing because you
know,

355
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,820
you can ask yourself,
well,

356
00:21:18,821 --> 00:21:21,310
are people the same or are they 
different?

357
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,353
And the answer to that is,
well it depends on what you mean when 

358
00:21:24,581 --> 00:21:26,170
you ask the question,
you know,

359
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:27,004
and I'm not being sarcastic about that.
That question is not answerable without 

360
00:21:31,781 --> 00:21:35,050
some additional information about what 
you're up to because it's like saying,

361
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,860
well our human languages the same or 
different and the answer is,

362
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:40,300
well,
they're the same and different.

363
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:44,620
There are levels of analysis at which 
they're the same and there are levels of

364
00:21:44,621 --> 00:21:45,454
analysis at which they're different and 
whether you consider the levels of 

365
00:21:48,491 --> 00:21:49,324
analysis with the similarities more 
important than the levels of analysis 

366
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,073
with the differences is going to depend 
on what you want as a consequence of 

367
00:21:56,471 --> 00:21:57,430
asking the question.

368
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,013
So,
but we do know that there are broad and 

369
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:06,331
identifiable similarities across people 
that don't seem to be merely biological.

370
00:22:06,941 --> 00:22:09,910
They're also biological and cultural and
you know,

371
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:14,440
you can see examples of that pretty 
quickly by the fact that,

372
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:15,663
you know,
I think there are going to be more 

373
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:20,890
smartphones in the world next year.
Then there are people and so it's pretty

374
00:22:20,891 --> 00:22:21,724
obvious that there's a universal market 
for smartphones and that says something 

375
00:22:24,311 --> 00:22:25,450
about,
you know,

376
00:22:25,451 --> 00:22:29,800
that says something about the makeup of 
people themselves regardless of culture.

377
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,083
Because people find tools that 
facilitate social communication 

378
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:34,923
desirable and they find tools that 
facilitate information gathering 

379
00:22:38,081 --> 00:22:43,081
desirable and they don't have to be 
taught to desire that they are just like

380
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:46,550
that.
So anyways,

381
00:22:46,551 --> 00:22:47,384
so like I said,
piaget is a good antidote to moral 

382
00:22:49,871 --> 00:22:53,920
relativism because the idea that it's 
like this,

383
00:22:53,921 --> 00:22:56,530
think about it this way because this is 
another way to understand it.

384
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:00,610
Um,
I'll give you two examples.

385
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:01,803
There were multiplayer online games in 
the early stages of multiplayer online 

386
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:10,900
games that collapsed into anarchy and 
then they had to be shut down.

387
00:23:10,901 --> 00:23:13,750
And the reason for that was that they 
weren't playable games.

388
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,093
There was,
there was some flaw in their underlying 

389
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:17,524
set of assumptions that made them 
unsustainable as a meeting place for 

390
00:23:21,161 --> 00:23:23,710
multiple human beings across large 
periods of time.

391
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,113
Others are more,
others are more calibrated and people 

392
00:23:26,831 --> 00:23:29,410
will play them.
So you can also think about a game as an

393
00:23:29,411 --> 00:23:31,750
equilibrium state for example.
And,

394
00:23:31,751 --> 00:23:34,180
and Piaget is quite smart about this 
sort of thing.

395
00:23:34,181 --> 00:23:37,180
So let's say a monopoly game.
Well,

396
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,230
is it an equivalent rated state?
While the answer to that is yes,

397
00:23:41,231 --> 00:23:45,040
in so far as all the players finished 
the game and then you might.

398
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,063
Well,
all the players finished the game and 

399
00:23:47,091 --> 00:23:48,670
they're still friends,
you know,

400
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,533
because that would be another level of 
specification or constraint that you 

401
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:52,664
could put on it.

402
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:53,893
But it's also interesting if you 
consider something like an enjoyable 

403
00:23:57,801 --> 00:23:58,634
game as an equilibrated estate that you 
can have competition within an 

404
00:24:02,391 --> 00:24:04,940
equilibrated status social community 
with no problem.

405
00:24:04,941 --> 00:24:08,570
As long as everybody agrees on what the 
rules for the competition are,

406
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:09,501
you know,
on.

407
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:14,501
So Piaget actually regarded competition 
as necessary element of games because he

408
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:18,410
said that game,
it's very so interesting.

409
00:24:18,411 --> 00:24:22,790
He actually thought of competition in 
some sense as a necessary as necessarily

410
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:26,570
tied in with with cooperation.
So here's an example,

411
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,410
take a hockey game.
So then we could say,

412
00:24:30,411 --> 00:24:32,840
well,
our people in the playing hockey,

413
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,640
are they competing?
Are they cooperating?

414
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,100
And the answer to that is,
well,

415
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:37,934
it's pretty hard to distinguish because 
all the players within a given team are 

416
00:24:42,141 --> 00:24:44,420
cooperating in so far as they're given 
team.

417
00:24:44,421 --> 00:24:45,254
And what that means is that each player 
is trying to climb the hierarchy of 

418
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:50,114
competence within the team,
but at the same time maximizing the 

419
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,070
probability that the team will be 
successful across multiple games.

420
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,113
And so that means that there's a set of 
constraints around how that player has 

421
00:25:01,881 --> 00:25:03,590
to interact with his teammates,
right?

422
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:08,800
He has to work in a manner that enables 
the development of his teammates because

423
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:12,260
otherwise it's a,
it's like a psychopathic strategy,

424
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:15,080
it's a bad longterm strategy.
And then you might say,

425
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:16,130
okay fine,
fine,

426
00:25:16,131 --> 00:25:19,820
people are cooperating within the team,
but what about between teams?

427
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:23,240
And then the answer to that is while 
they're cooperating,

428
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:25,120
insofar as they follow the rules,
you know,

429
00:25:25,121 --> 00:25:25,954
and that they don't bring a basketball 
to the hockey game or a set a chess set 

430
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:31,243
to the hockey game because obviously you
can't play chess in hockey at the same 

431
00:25:34,191 --> 00:25:35,024
time.
And so everybody's agreed to act out a 

432
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:40,220
certain set of behavioral risk 
constraints.

433
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,310
And in so far as they're doing that,
that's a cooperative.

434
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,190
That's a cooperative maneuver.
So that's pretty.

435
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,203
That's pretty interesting to.
Piaget actually believed that children 

436
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:55,331
couldn't become social until so at the 
earliest stages of development as far as

437
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:56,843
piaget was concerned.
Children in some sense we're playing by 

438
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:01,304
themselves and the reason they're doing 
that is because they're not very 

439
00:26:03,651 --> 00:26:04,484
organized yet.
Their bodies are sort of not completely 

440
00:26:06,141 --> 00:26:06,974
under their control.
So you could think of a child as a non 

441
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:14,681
equilibrated set of quasi functional and
cause I unified knowledge subsystems.

442
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,553
So for example,
when a child is born and they're laying 

443
00:26:24,051 --> 00:26:24,884
on their back,
their arms are kind of floating around 

444
00:26:26,061 --> 00:26:29,810
like this and the reason for that is 
their arms aren't myelinated yet.

445
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,830
The but babies kind of myelinated from a
nervous system perspective in the center

446
00:26:33,831 --> 00:26:36,590
of its body and its mouth is pretty 
wired up,

447
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:37,603
but the rest of it isn't very formed.
And so what the child has to do is 

448
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,413
integrate him or herself as an 
individual entity and bring all those 

449
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:46,703
subsystems online and into something 
that's sort of integrated across 

450
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:51,810
reasonable lengths of time.

451
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,630
And then the next goal is to do that 
with someone else.

452
00:26:54,631 --> 00:26:57,460
And that's about three years old when 
social place starts.

453
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,880
So then if you and I are playing and 
we're playing,

454
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,560
say pretend play,
we're going to say,

455
00:27:01,561 --> 00:27:04,590
well we're going to do x,
we'll lay out the ground rules,

456
00:27:04,591 --> 00:27:07,980
we're going to do x and we can compete 
to get to towards x.

457
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,070
But if we couldn't have unified our 
goals,

458
00:27:11,071 --> 00:27:11,904
so unified these frames of reference,
we wouldn't be able to compete in the 

459
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:14,964
same space.
And so one of the things piaget is 

460
00:27:17,161 --> 00:27:17,994
pointing out is that it's clearly the 
case that a competitive game can 

461
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,013
facilitate cooperation and in fact the 
establishment of such games might 

462
00:27:24,961 --> 00:27:28,860
actually be absolutely fundamental to 
socialization itself.

463
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:31,290
So you know,
because well,

464
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:33,900
you don't just want a game that 
everybody can play.

465
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,123
I don't think so.
I don't think that's sufficiently 

466
00:27:36,151 --> 00:27:39,000
motivating for people you want to game 
that everyone can play,

467
00:27:39,001 --> 00:27:39,834
that everyone has a chance at winning 
because playing is something that's for 

468
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:44,190
sure.

469
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,890
And if it's a good game,
just playing it as interesting.

470
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:52,070
But winning is also something.
And so that places another constraint on

471
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:57,830
those games that people find that people
are willing to voluntarily play.

472
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,023
You know,
in one of the things that you can think 

473
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:00,594
about with regards to the 20th century 
is that the 20th century was an 

474
00:28:04,531 --> 00:28:09,531
experiment in producing games that were 
predicated on rational assumptions about

475
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,020
the nature of mankind.
So for example,

476
00:28:13,021 --> 00:28:16,230
the Communists said well,
from each,

477
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,580
according to his ability to each 
according to his need,

478
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:23,040
which sounds like a pretty reasonable 
proposition.

479
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:23,874
Right?
So you should work as hard as you can 

480
00:28:25,141 --> 00:28:25,974
and,
and give what you can to the community 

481
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:30,360
and if you need something from the 
community than it should be given to you

482
00:28:30,361 --> 00:28:31,051
and you think,
well,

483
00:28:31,051 --> 00:28:31,884
you know,
that seems like a pretty positive 

484
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,480
presumption.
You know,

485
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:39,420
when there were other presumptions that 
went along with the theory as well.

486
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:44,290
Like the fact that private property was 
something that was a scourge and,

487
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,720
and,
and to be eliminated.

488
00:28:45,721 --> 00:28:46,620
And so,
you know,

489
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:51,830
lots of societies set that game up as a 
experiment in some sense.

490
00:28:51,901 --> 00:28:55,170
And we found out very,
very rapidly that it didn't work.

491
00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:01,190
So all games are not equally playable.
And that's a,

492
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,570
that's a,
a proposition that you can use to orient

493
00:29:06,571 --> 00:29:07,404
yourself in a world where people talk 
about the relativism of different moral 

494
00:29:10,651 --> 00:29:11,484
beliefs.
Now obviously there's some relativism 

495
00:29:12,991 --> 00:29:15,570
because in our society,
for example,

496
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,673
you can do perfectly well playing the 
plumber game or playing the lawyer game 

497
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:22,550
and the plumber game and a lawyer Gamer,
obviously different.

498
00:29:22,551 --> 00:29:25,070
It all sorts of levels of analysis and 
you know,

499
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,730
those are modes of being,
you can think of them in some senses.

500
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:31,200
Moral systems and both of them can 
operate in the same environment.

501
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,333
So even in an elevated state,
there's room for a fair bit of 

502
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:38,100
variability.
But it's variability within boundaries.

503
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,233
Just like the play when you're playing a
complex game is variable within 

504
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,360
boundaries,
you know,

505
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:46,600
in most games that are enjoyable to play
multiple times,

506
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:50,890
set out some pretty serious constraints.
But within that system of constraints,

507
00:29:50,891 --> 00:29:53,890
they enable a lot of freedom.
So.

508
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,110
Alright,
so you know,

509
00:29:56,111 --> 00:29:58,620
that's,
that's an overview of Piagetian theory.

510
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,463
I mean,
I'm particularly interest with regards 

511
00:30:00,611 --> 00:30:03,730
to this course in Piaget's theories of 
moral development.

512
00:30:03,731 --> 00:30:06,130
And I outlined them in some sense right 
there.

513
00:30:06,131 --> 00:30:06,964
So,
you know,

514
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,833
one of the things that would happen is 
that once a Nyquil abraded state is set 

515
00:30:10,781 --> 00:30:11,614
up at multiple levels of analysis,
the child's job is to interact with the 

516
00:30:15,521 --> 00:30:19,040
environment in a manner that doesn't 
disrupt,

517
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:21,250
celebrate the systems that the child is 
part of.

518
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:23,320
And you can think about that as 
socialization,

519
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,760
you know,
and so for,

520
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:26,680
in this situation,
for example,

521
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,233
the only reason that this class can go 
ahead without interruption is that 

522
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,290
you're all playing and equilibrated 
game,

523
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,600
roughly speaking,
you don't have to be here,

524
00:30:37,601 --> 00:30:38,620
but you are.

525
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,233
And there's a whole large number of 
unwritten procedural rules for being 

526
00:30:44,681 --> 00:30:47,710
here and you're all following them.
You know,

527
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:50,830
when you can think about that as a 
consequence of some degree of tyranny.

528
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:54,430
And people have made that comment about 
classrooms and sometimes it's true,

529
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,623
but you can also think about it as a 
pretty successful equilibrated state 

530
00:30:58,721 --> 00:31:01,930
because universities have been around 
for a thousand years,

531
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,120
you know,
and they've continued to cross time.

532
00:31:04,121 --> 00:31:06,310
So it looks like a,
it looks like a pretty good game.

533
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:09,160
So yeah,
the trick is,

534
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:14,161
is that the value systems emerge as a 
consequence of multiple constraints laid

535
00:31:14,921 --> 00:31:15,754
down by the fact that there are multiple
levels of reality that have to be 

536
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:19,744
harmoniously working simultaneously and 
you know you're biologically celebrated 

537
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:25,870
system in so far as you're healthy,
right?

538
00:31:25,871 --> 00:31:27,160
Because,
well,

539
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,053
none of your,
none of your DNA has decided to make a 

540
00:31:30,311 --> 00:31:33,130
go of it on its own,
which is basically what happens when you

541
00:31:33,131 --> 00:31:33,964
develop cancer and so it's a stacking of
systems on top of one another so that 

542
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,270
each is nested in the other and they're 
all working together and it's,

543
00:31:42,271 --> 00:31:43,600
as you can imagine,
that's a very,

544
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:44,434
very tight set of constraints and 
there's certainly lots of situations 

545
00:31:47,351 --> 00:31:48,970
where none of those are going to be met.

546
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,613
So

547
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,313
what's your motivation for learning?
This fits very well into cybernetic 

548
00:32:03,741 --> 00:32:05,420
models of,
of learning as well.

549
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,493
While you're motivated to learn what you
do doesn't produce what you want it to 

550
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,540
do.
So that's another,

551
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,200
that's another description of 
pragmatism.

552
00:32:15,201 --> 00:32:16,034
Fundamentally.
So remember this is an action oriented 

553
00:32:18,111 --> 00:32:18,944
theory.
You're specifying the outcome and then 

554
00:32:20,601 --> 00:32:21,434
you're acting on the world in order to 
bring it about and if it doesn't work 

555
00:32:23,721 --> 00:32:26,900
then you have to reexamine your 
assumptions and then.

556
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:31,340
Or it's funny,
you have to reexamine your assumptions,

557
00:32:31,341 --> 00:32:32,174
which would be part of a combination 
because you'd be shifting around the 

558
00:32:34,401 --> 00:32:36,680
assumptions of the theory within which 
you're operating,

559
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:40,190
but you're also going to be assimilating
information to.

560
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:41,720
So for example,
you know,

561
00:32:41,721 --> 00:32:42,554
if you,
maybe you're 15 or 16 and you've tried 

562
00:32:44,811 --> 00:32:49,520
to establish a relationship with someone
that you have a romantic interest in and

563
00:32:49,521 --> 00:32:51,170
that's failed multiple times.

564
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:55,280
Well the first thing is it's obvious 
that you're,

565
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,490
you're the set of assumptions that 
you're bringing to bear on the situation

566
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,320
are,
are inaccurate,

567
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:01,640
and you might say,
well,

568
00:33:01,641 --> 00:33:03,410
what's the evidence that they're 
inaccurate?

569
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,660
And the answer is,
well,

570
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,470
you aren't engaging in any romantic 
relationships and that's the whole point

571
00:33:09,471 --> 00:33:10,304
of the theories.
So they're inaccurate in so far as 

572
00:33:12,171 --> 00:33:13,820
they're not producing the desired 
outcome.

573
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,200
Okay?
So then you might say,

574
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,000
well,
what could you do about that?

575
00:33:17,001 --> 00:33:17,834
And one would be,
well you could gather some more 

576
00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:20,114
information.
So one of the things I do with my 

577
00:33:21,321 --> 00:33:22,340
clients,
for example,

578
00:33:22,341 --> 00:33:25,040
if they happen to be terrified of the 
opposite sex,

579
00:33:25,041 --> 00:33:25,874
which is you know,
generally is a very high probability a 

580
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:31,843
situation.
I often get them to go to speed dating 

581
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,833
games because they can interact with 20 
people in this space of an hour or two 

582
00:33:40,881 --> 00:33:45,881
and it expands their knowledge of 
interactions and also their knowledge of

583
00:33:45,981 --> 00:33:48,380
the variability of the people that 
they're dealing with.

584
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,840
And so it's.
It's a form of exposure.

585
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,350
So you could say if you're using the old
kind of habituation theory,

586
00:33:54,351 --> 00:33:54,891
you could say,
well,

587
00:33:54,891 --> 00:33:56,750
they're just getting accustomed to the 
situation,

588
00:33:56,751 --> 00:33:58,910
but that's rubbish.
That isn't what they're doing at all.

589
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,103
What they're doing is going in there and
they're interacting and each time they 

590
00:34:02,631 --> 00:34:03,464
interact,
they gather more information and then 

591
00:34:05,331 --> 00:34:09,290
what did they do with that information 
while they build it into themselves.

592
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,303
And that means that they start behaving 
differently and they start 

593
00:34:13,071 --> 00:34:15,680
conceptualizing themselves in the world 
differently.

594
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,860
And so some of it's built in at a 
procedural level,

595
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:24,010
which means maybe they become more fluid
and less awkward in their nonverbal self

596
00:34:24,011 --> 00:34:26,390
presentation.
But at the same time,

597
00:34:26,391 --> 00:34:27,224
they're also incorporating abstract 
knowledge that's going to help them 

598
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:34,190
expand their domain of competence.
And so for Piaget,

599
00:34:34,191 --> 00:34:37,460
the motive is if it doesn't work well,
then you should be motivated to fix it.

600
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,293
Now you know,
that doesn't work under all 

601
00:34:39,891 --> 00:34:43,430
circumstances because sometimes if it 
doesn't work,

602
00:34:43,431 --> 00:34:45,380
it crushes,
you know?

603
00:34:45,381 --> 00:34:46,214
And so,
well that's something else we'll talk 

604
00:34:47,481 --> 00:34:48,314
about here.
So,

605
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,393
okay,
so this little diagram kind of points 

606
00:34:53,871 --> 00:34:55,940
out a little more complicated version of
that.

607
00:34:55,941 --> 00:34:59,570
So you're going from point a which is 
the unbearable present to point b,

608
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,613
and there's more or less two things that
can happen and one is what you want to 

609
00:35:03,711 --> 00:35:08,360
have happened and the other is something
other than you want happens.

610
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,000
Now,
sometimes the thing that you,

611
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:14,360
that happens that you don't want to 
happen is minor,

612
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:15,883
in which case you can just modify,
you don't have to change your whole 

613
00:35:19,431 --> 00:35:21,860
theory,
you can just modify one tiny sub element

614
00:35:21,861 --> 00:35:23,900
of it and you'll get where you're going.
So for example,

615
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,123
if I wanted to walk towards that set of 
doors there and I was going to do it 

616
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,100
blindfolded and I wasn't aware of this 
environment,

617
00:35:31,101 --> 00:35:34,700
I would walk forward until I encountered
a desk say,

618
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:35,623
and then I could just feel my way around
the desk and continue forward so I 

619
00:35:38,281 --> 00:35:39,960
wouldn't have to disrupt the whole plan.

620
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,030
I would just have to alter my core 
elements of it.

621
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:47,070
But if I'm going to med school 
hypothetically and I write the AMCAP and

622
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:47,904
I get 30th percentile,
which 30 percent of the people get or 

623
00:35:51,421 --> 00:35:52,254
lower,
right?

624
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:57,620
Then you're not going to medical school 
and so that requires a radical revamping

625
00:35:58,351 --> 00:36:03,351
of the of the system that you're using 
to Schema ties your world and you know,

626
00:36:03,481 --> 00:36:05,970
you might say,
well that would be motivating to.

627
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:09,660
That would motivate you to see what you 
did wrong and to change it.

628
00:36:09,661 --> 00:36:12,690
So you could go to medical school,
but sometimes it's just hopeless.

629
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,003
What you do,
this is a radical act of accommodation 

630
00:36:16,081 --> 00:36:16,914
is you do something else.
You know when you might go through an 

631
00:36:18,961 --> 00:36:21,510
intervening period of tremendous chaos.
Well,

632
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:26,630
every thing has fallen apart into its 
subsidiary elements and you have no idea

633
00:36:26,821 --> 00:36:29,910
how to unify that once again into a 
calibrated state,

634
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,343
so,
so the diagram here shows you point a 

635
00:36:33,961 --> 00:36:34,680
and point b.

636
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,850
It says when you're going to point a 
then what you want can happen and that's

637
00:36:38,851 --> 00:36:39,684
great because you move forward.
Plus you validate the whole theory or 

638
00:36:43,471 --> 00:36:44,304
you can move forward and something that 
you don't unexpect don't expect happens 

639
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:52,080
and you don't understand it and that 
stops you and if it's bad enough,

640
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,500
it invalidates the whole theory.
Now you might ask,

641
00:36:55,501 --> 00:36:56,334
well,
what's the difference between a small 

642
00:36:57,301 --> 00:36:58,134
disruption and a large disruption?
And that's a very complicated thing to 

643
00:37:01,441 --> 00:37:02,274
figure out,
but it took me a long time to figure 

644
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,740
this out.
I would say it probably took 20 years is

645
00:37:07,741 --> 00:37:11,220
that
you could imagine that each of your,

646
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,293
your Schema,
your systems about adaptation work in a 

647
00:37:16,021 --> 00:37:19,590
given area and across a variety of 
circumstances.

648
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,873
Okay.
Then you could say the most fundamental 

649
00:37:22,861 --> 00:37:23,694
assumptions that you have are the ones 
that for you have worked across the 

650
00:37:27,691 --> 00:37:32,310
broadest possible range of situations 
and time spans.

651
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,890
So they work when you're alone,
they work with,

652
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,873
when you're with other people,
they work in the short term and they 

653
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:42,921
work in the longterm.
If you disrupt a Schema that Schema that

654
00:37:43,591 --> 00:37:47,550
has oriented you across wide swaths of 
time and space,

655
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:50,250
then that's really going to dysregulate 
you emotionally.

656
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,150
Whereas if you disrupt the Schema that's
only locally operating,

657
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,410
like the table example that I gave you,
well it doesn't spread much.

658
00:37:58,411 --> 00:37:59,244
It's you can make a minor adjustment 
that's only relevant to this time and 

659
00:38:02,161 --> 00:38:04,680
place and it produced a little burst of 
emotion.

660
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,700
Sometimes even positive emotion because 
you just get curious about it instead of

661
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:11,040
frightened.
So,

662
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,103
and I can,
I'll show you as we proceed a little 

663
00:38:13,801 --> 00:38:17,250
more formal way of Schema enticing,
not because when you're reading piaget,

664
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:18,084
you might ask,
well at what point does assimilation 

665
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,210
become accommodation?
And the answer that I just provided,

666
00:38:24,211 --> 00:38:26,850
which I hope is reasonably 
comprehensible is,

667
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:28,560
is the best I can provide.

668
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,750
Here's a more concrete way of looking at
it.

669
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,063
You're a premed student or let's do 
prelaunch because let's pick on the pre 

670
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:37,900
law students instead.
You're a pre law student.

671
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,510
So we can imagine that there's 
assumptions that go into that.

672
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:44,620
Think about them all.
You're reasonably intelligent,

673
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:49,150
you're reasonably verbally intelligent,
you're going to do well on the Lsat,

674
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,860
there's going to be a career as a lawyer
waiting for you if you do well.

675
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,173
I'm
being a lawyer is a perfectly valid way 

676
00:38:58,931 --> 00:39:01,960
of being in the world from a moral and 
practical perspective.

677
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,033
Being a lawyer is better than any other 
way of being in the world because other 

678
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,183
for you anyways,
because otherwise why wouldn't you pick 

679
00:39:07,991 --> 00:39:08,980
that?
Okay,

680
00:39:08,981 --> 00:39:11,650
so those are pretty fundamental 
assumptions and then you can think,

681
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,813
well,
how much of your Schema do they 

682
00:39:14,921 --> 00:39:16,180
underlie?
Well,

683
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:21,820
your judgement about your intelligence 
and let's say also your relative ability

684
00:39:21,821 --> 00:39:24,580
because you know,
ability isn't only intelligence,

685
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:25,870
that's a big one,
right?

686
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,910
You bring that with you pretty much 
wherever you go.

687
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,070
There may be some domains where you 
think,

688
00:39:30,071 --> 00:39:31,750
well,
I'm not as smart as I could be there,

689
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:33,850
but it's usually quite a general 
assumption.

690
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,940
And so let's say you write the Olsat sat
and you just bomb out.

691
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,033
It's like,
looks like you're not as smart as you 

692
00:39:40,331 --> 00:39:43,060
thought you were,
and so then what do you do about that?

693
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,733
Well,
it's rough because you not only do have 

694
00:39:45,941 --> 00:39:48,160
to reconstitute your vision of the 
future,

695
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,390
but you have to reconstitute your vision
of the present and the past.

696
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:55,060
All those times that you thought you 
were so smart,

697
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:55,943
it turns out you weren't.
So you can see that that's because of 

698
00:39:59,311 --> 00:40:02,530
those.
Those presuppositions are so fundamental

699
00:40:02,531 --> 00:40:06,010
that disrupting them is going to produce
a fair degree of negative emotion.

700
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:10,090
So and you can tell from from this 
diagram,

701
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:13,210
you imagine that when you're moving 
forward from point a to point b,

702
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:14,044
there are.

703
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:14,963
There are obstacles that you can 
encounter that you know of and you can 

704
00:40:17,141 --> 00:40:17,974
just put a detour in place.
Are there obstacles that emerged that 

705
00:40:19,871 --> 00:40:22,090
you have no idea how to conceptualize 
whatsoever?

706
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,493
That often happens to people if they 
develop the symptoms of a very serious 

707
00:40:27,161 --> 00:40:27,994
disease or if someone they love develop 
severe the symptoms of a very serious 

708
00:40:31,241 --> 00:40:32,074
disease because not only are you not 
going where you thought you were with 

709
00:40:36,461 --> 00:40:38,260
the person that you thought you were 
going,

710
00:40:38,261 --> 00:40:40,690
but you don't know what's going to 
happen in the interim.

711
00:40:40,691 --> 00:40:43,780
So it's very,
very difficult to accommodate to that.

712
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:47,440
And so one of the things I think that 
piaget missed,

713
00:40:47,441 --> 00:40:48,274
at least to some degree,
is that there's often catastrophic 

714
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:54,190
discontinuity in this stage progression,
you know,

715
00:40:54,191 --> 00:40:55,024
and he was looking at little kids and 
how they put their cognitive schema 

716
00:40:57,071 --> 00:40:57,904
together and generally they're not 
completely distraught and destroyed by 

717
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,680
the necessity for transformation into 
purely cognitive realm.

718
00:41:05,681 --> 00:41:06,514
But,
uh,

719
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:14,190
well I told you,
I think I told you my nephew,

720
00:41:14,191 --> 00:41:16,540
his dream about the dragon.
Did I tell you that?

721
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:17,441
Yeah.
Okay.

722
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:18,274
So he was going through a stage 
transition at that point because while 

723
00:41:20,901 --> 00:41:21,734
there were two things happening,
one was that he was going off to 

724
00:41:24,071 --> 00:41:25,510
kindergarten.
That's a big deal.

725
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,940
And then there was some instability in 
his family.

726
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:32,170
And so he had to figure out how to cope 
with both of those,

727
00:41:32,171 --> 00:41:33,004
and one of the ways of coping was to 
become more of an individual and his 

728
00:41:37,641 --> 00:41:38,990
dream,
first of all,

729
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,760
laid out for him.
The problem,

730
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:41,803
the problem was there were problems.
Those are all the little bitey things 

731
00:41:44,631 --> 00:41:46,370
that were jumping up on them,
their problems.

732
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:51,260
But that's not the problem.
The problem is is that the problems keep

733
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:53,990
coming.
So not only are there problems,

734
00:41:53,991 --> 00:41:54,824
but there's an indefinite number of them
and there's something that generates 

735
00:41:57,621 --> 00:41:57,980
them.

736
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:58,813
It's like the hydro.
You remember the Hydra in ancient 

737
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:01,694
mythology,
it's got seven had to see cut off one 

738
00:42:03,501 --> 00:42:04,730
head,
seven more heads grow.

739
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:06,050
It's like,
that's life.

740
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,320
So you know what do you do under those 
situations?

741
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:10,154
And he had this symbolic notion first in
the dream or the white triggered that 

742
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:14,800
with my questions,
which was what?

743
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:15,653
You go right for the source of the 
problems and you do something about 

744
00:42:18,201 --> 00:42:19,100
that.
Now,

745
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:20,743
part of the reason that Piaget thought 
that the study of knowledge was best 

746
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,183
construed as the study of the 
acquisition of knowledge is because you 

747
00:42:28,371 --> 00:42:28,941
could say,
well,

748
00:42:28,941 --> 00:42:31,730
here's the situation.
Do you know what to do?

749
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:33,230
And you say,
yes.

750
00:42:33,231 --> 00:42:36,440
I say great,
no problem in that situation,

751
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,393
but then I could say,
here's the situation and you don't know 

752
00:42:40,371 --> 00:42:42,680
what to do.
Well that's a problem,

753
00:42:42,681 --> 00:42:43,514
but that's also the problem of life and 
so what's the solution to the set of 

754
00:42:46,881 --> 00:42:47,714
problems that you have no answer to and 
the answer to that is assimilation and 

755
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:53,540
accommodation,
exploration,

756
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:55,430
assimilation and accommodation.

757
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,910
Now when the little guy and the dream 
went down the dragons throat,

758
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:00,013
he went to where the fire came out and 
you can imagine that if a dragon is 

759
00:43:02,631 --> 00:43:03,464
belching,
fire and smoke and that's turning into 

760
00:43:04,521 --> 00:43:05,340
little,
you know,

761
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,700
beat demons,
that the fire box,

762
00:43:07,701 --> 00:43:11,210
which is a place of transformation seems
to be the core of the problem.

763
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:12,403
Well,
he went to the core of the problem and 

764
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:15,680
he cut part of it out and then you use 
that as a shield.

765
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:17,023
Now that it's a brilliant solution 
because basically what it proposes is 

766
00:43:20,151 --> 00:43:20,984
that
there's enough information in the world 

767
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:25,423
and you're a good enough information 
processor so that if you use all the 

768
00:43:28,701 --> 00:43:29,534
information that's lying latent in the 
world against the set of all possible 

769
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:37,180
problems,
it will work and I would say,

770
00:43:37,181 --> 00:43:38,014
you know,
we have lots of clinical evidence that 

771
00:43:39,141 --> 00:43:39,974
that's the case because one of the 
things we do for people in clinical 

772
00:43:42,351 --> 00:43:45,410
psychology all the time is,
well,

773
00:43:45,411 --> 00:43:46,100
they have a problem.

774
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,550
We unpack it into the things that are 
stopping them that they don't think they

775
00:43:49,551 --> 00:43:50,384
can master.
And then we put them in a situation 

776
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:55,280
where they're asked to develop mastery 
over just those situations.

777
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:56,443
And it works.
And if you do an analysis of why it 

778
00:43:59,421 --> 00:44:00,860
works,
it's not exactly that.

779
00:44:00,861 --> 00:44:04,160
They become less afraid.
So let's say somebody is agoraphobic and

780
00:44:04,161 --> 00:44:07,400
they don't want to go in an elevator and
you teach them to go into the elevator.

781
00:44:07,401 --> 00:44:08,061
You might say,
well,

782
00:44:08,061 --> 00:44:11,270
they're less afraid of the elevator,
but it's not exactly right.

783
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:12,523
What they are is more confident in their
ability to be the sort of creature that 

784
00:44:15,621 --> 00:44:20,090
can overcome fears and prevail and 
therefore go in the elevator.

785
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:22,520
So instead of the world getting less 
dangerous,

786
00:44:22,521 --> 00:44:23,354
they get braver,
which is a much better solution because 

787
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:28,160
the world is just not going to get any 
less dangerous.

788
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:29,563
So,
so the knowledge acquisition process is 

789
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,073
explore in the face of novelty.
And the novelty is technically when you 

790
00:44:38,941 --> 00:44:40,770
lay out something that you think,
you know,

791
00:44:40,771 --> 00:44:42,420
and something else happens in step.

792
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:43,913
So

793
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:50,980
this is a set of ideas that's in keeping
with,

794
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:51,880
with,
uh,

795
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:56,340
Piaget's pragmatic viewpoint because a,
see,

796
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:59,440
sorry about that.
So you might say,

797
00:44:59,441 --> 00:45:00,820
well,
if you're,

798
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:01,743
if you're,

799
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,740
if you're basing your theory of 
knowledge on action,

800
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,860
what are the elements of that theory of 
knowledge?

801
00:45:10,861 --> 00:45:11,694
Because they're not exactly objects 
because objects or something that sort 

802
00:45:14,161 --> 00:45:17,130
of exist outside the realm of what 
you're going to do with them.

803
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:21,180
At least in principle.
One of the presuppositions of science is

804
00:45:21,181 --> 00:45:24,840
that the object exists independently of 
its value.

805
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:29,520
But if your cognitive schemer are more 
or less action predicated,

806
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:33,000
then that isn't exactly how the world 
manifests itself to you,

807
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,840
not as an objective reality.
And here's a way of looking at it.

808
00:45:36,841 --> 00:45:37,674
You're going from point a to point b.
and what do you see while you can look 

809
00:45:41,491 --> 00:45:43,140
at it in different ways,
uh,

810
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,153
these are ideas that are taking taken 
from an ecological approach to visual 

811
00:45:48,451 --> 00:45:50,820
perception,
which was written byj dot j dot Gibson,

812
00:45:50,821 --> 00:45:51,654
who's,
who has constructivist elements in his 

813
00:45:53,971 --> 00:45:54,420
thinking.

814
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:57,480
So he would say that when you,
when you look at the world,

815
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:02,130
what you see are things that will 
facilitate your movement forward.

816
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:04,800
Roughly speaking,
those are tools,

817
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,050
although he would have called them 
affordances.

818
00:46:07,051 --> 00:46:10,350
It's kind of a broader category,
but no one knows what affordances means.

819
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:15,351
So I'm going to use tools and the later 
scientists like Jeffrey Gray pointed out

820
00:46:17,581 --> 00:46:20,220
that if you see something that 
facilitates movement forward,

821
00:46:20,221 --> 00:46:23,610
that produces positive emotion.
So for example,

822
00:46:23,611 --> 00:46:28,611
if I want to go up to that exit sign and
I see that pathway clear as it is now,

823
00:46:30,781 --> 00:46:32,640
that's going to produce a little 
approach.

824
00:46:32,641 --> 00:46:33,474
Activation in me and make me feel good,
whereas if people have put six or seven 

825
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:39,120
pack sacks in the way and I look at 
that,

826
00:46:39,121 --> 00:46:39,954
that's going to produce a bit of 
negative emotion right away because the 

827
00:46:42,271 --> 00:46:44,970
other thing that you see in the world 
are obstacles,

828
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:48,360
tools,
facilitators,

829
00:46:48,361 --> 00:46:49,194
affordances,
depending on how you look at it and 

830
00:46:50,881 --> 00:46:51,714
obstacles and you manifest positive 
emotion to the tools and negative 

831
00:46:54,661 --> 00:46:55,494
emotion to the obstacles.
And then there's another class which is 

832
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:02,190
things that you don't know,
things you don't,

833
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,233
things you aren't able to classify as 
tools or obstacles but that aren't 

834
00:47:05,911 --> 00:47:09,510
irrelevant.
And that's a class of unexpected things.

835
00:47:09,511 --> 00:47:11,730
Now,
along with tools and obstacles,

836
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:15,330
there's another rule which is you ignore
almost everything,

837
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,280
right?
You ignore almost everything.

838
00:47:17,550 --> 00:47:18,383
So most things have no value at all.
And the value is actually dependent to 

839
00:47:21,151 --> 00:47:24,090
some degree on the Schema that you lay 
on the situation.

840
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,580
So.
Alright,

841
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,713
so

842
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,650
I'll tell you about this too.
So here's a.

843
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:36,543
here's a more elaborated description of 
what happens to you when you run into 

844
00:47:40,181 --> 00:47:41,710
something that you don't know what to do
with.

845
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:42,573
Because remember,
you have to deal with the things that 

846
00:47:44,591 --> 00:47:48,610
you don't know how to deal with,
which is a very peculiar problem because

847
00:47:48,611 --> 00:47:49,444
obviously you don't know how well what 
happens is that your body has default 

848
00:47:53,051 --> 00:47:58,051
responses and one of the default 
responses is that you freeze because you

849
00:47:58,421 --> 00:47:59,254
tend to respond to anything that's 
unexpected as if it has a predatory 

850
00:48:02,351 --> 00:48:03,220
impulse.
You know,

851
00:48:03,221 --> 00:48:05,380
so you're back on the Velt,
you know,

852
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:09,120
6 million years ago and you hear 
something rustling in the bushes.

853
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:09,993
It's probably a or in the grass.
It's probably a pretty good idea to 

854
00:48:12,191 --> 00:48:13,024
freeze because perhaps it's a Predator 
and you don't want to attract its 

855
00:48:15,461 --> 00:48:16,294
attention.
So one of the things that your body 

856
00:48:18,941 --> 00:48:19,840
does,
two things.

857
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:20,673
You don't expect this to treat them as 
if they're predatory and you as if 

858
00:48:24,341 --> 00:48:25,174
you're prey.
So you freeze and then you ramp up your 

859
00:48:28,391 --> 00:48:30,460
physiology so your heart rate will go 
up,

860
00:48:30,461 --> 00:48:31,600
for example,
and you might say,

861
00:48:31,601 --> 00:48:32,434
well,
your heart rate goes up because you're 

862
00:48:33,041 --> 00:48:33,970
afraid.
It's like,

863
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:37,090
well no,
that isn't why your heart rate goes up.

864
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:38,163
Your heart rate goes up so that your 
heart pumps blood to your muscles and 

865
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:45,670
when you're afraid you want to have 
blood pumped to your muscles because you

866
00:48:45,671 --> 00:48:48,670
want to use the damn things for running 
away or fighting if you have to.

867
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,310
And so that's why.
For example,

868
00:48:51,311 --> 00:48:53,170
if you do psychophysiological 
experiments,

869
00:48:53,171 --> 00:48:54,004
you can't just assume that raised heart 
rate rate means fear because it might 

870
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,570
mean excitement or any number of other 
things.

871
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,673
What it really means is that you're 
preparing to act well and so how do you 

872
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:04,474
prepare to act if you don't know what to
do and the answer is you pretty much 

873
00:49:06,581 --> 00:49:11,581
prepared to do anything
and that's really hard on you and if you

874
00:49:12,041 --> 00:49:12,874
stay in,
if you stay in the mode of preparing to 

875
00:49:18,311 --> 00:49:19,144
do anything for a long period of time,
then you age and you're more likely to 

876
00:49:24,671 --> 00:49:25,504
become diabetic and you're more likely 
to become obese and you're more likely 

877
00:49:27,491 --> 00:49:30,310
to get cancer and infectious diseases 
and so on and so forth.

878
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:31,150
Because,
well,

879
00:49:31,151 --> 00:49:31,984
partly because your body suppresses your
immune system while you're in the state 

880
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:38,280
of not knowing what to do next.
Because you know if,

881
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:40,840
if you have to fight with the tiger in 
the next five minutes,

882
00:49:40,841 --> 00:49:43,270
doesn't really matter if you're going to
die of smallpox in a year,

883
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,850
so your body just shuts off everything 
that isn't useful,

884
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,193
so and then you might think about that 
as stress and that's pretty good way of 

885
00:49:50,771 --> 00:49:54,760
thinking about stress and then you might
assimilate that to dominance hierarchies

886
00:49:54,761 --> 00:49:57,910
and here's how you could do it at the 
top of the dominance hierarchy.

887
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:58,744
Everything you do works.
That's why you were at the top of the 

888
00:50:01,271 --> 00:50:03,880
dominance hierarchy at the bottom of the
dominance hierarchy.

889
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:04,893
Nothing you do works.
That's why you're at the bottom of the 

890
00:50:07,091 --> 00:50:08,260
dominance hierarchy.
Now,

891
00:50:08,261 --> 00:50:10,270
that might be the fault of the dominance
hierarchy,

892
00:50:10,271 --> 00:50:11,104
but as far as you're concerned,
it's irrelevant because the point is 

893
00:50:13,721 --> 00:50:14,554
what's it doing to you?
And the answer is if you're at the 

894
00:50:16,241 --> 00:50:17,074
bottom of the dominance hierarchy,
you don't know what's going to happen 

895
00:50:20,021 --> 00:50:20,854
next.
And so you're always in a state of 

896
00:50:21,911 --> 00:50:22,744
chronic preparation for activity and 
that's why you die sooner and you're 

897
00:50:26,651 --> 00:50:29,660
more likely to develop infectious 
diseases and all sorts of things.

898
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,390
And that's even true if you control for 
absolute income.

899
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:34,063
So

900
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,180
all right,

901
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:46,520
so that's kind of what this diagram 
indicates.

902
00:50:46,521 --> 00:50:47,354
So this is,
this is similar to the initiation 

903
00:50:50,541 --> 00:50:51,374
rituals that we talked about before.
You're in a Schema and something comes 

904
00:50:54,981 --> 00:50:57,290
along and knocks out one of the 
presuppositions.

905
00:50:57,291 --> 00:50:58,124
So what you're doing doesn't work.
Then you're going to fall into an 

906
00:51:01,131 --> 00:51:01,964
intermediate period of chaos and the 
chaos is going to be proportionate to 

907
00:51:05,991 --> 00:51:10,370
the importance of the proposition that 
that was disrupted and the importance is

908
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:11,204
going to be proportionate to how much 
you use that axiom across multiple 

909
00:51:14,781 --> 00:51:17,890
situations.
So you know,

910
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:21,200
I can give you a scientific example.
You may remember,

911
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:22,063
perhaps not a couple of years ago,
there was a report from someone in 

912
00:51:24,141 --> 00:51:28,430
Europe that they had managed faster than
light communication.

913
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:32,690
Now the right response to that was no 
way,

914
00:51:32,691 --> 00:51:33,524
because that means the most fundamental 
physical theory we have that's passed 

915
00:51:37,221 --> 00:51:39,740
like 50,000 other tests is wrong.

916
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,300
So when they say,
well,

917
00:51:41,301 --> 00:51:44,180
extraordinary claims require 
extraordinary evidence.

918
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:45,223
But had it been true,
it would have been earth shattering 

919
00:51:47,661 --> 00:51:48,494
because it would mean that the physical 
theory that physicists use not only to 

920
00:51:52,671 --> 00:51:53,504
ramp up their career but to actually 
deal with the world had a fundamental 

921
00:51:56,271 --> 00:51:58,270
axiomatic error,
you know,

922
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:00,650
and it turned out that there was 
something wrong with their measurements,

923
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:01,690
which is,
you know,

924
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:04,070
one of the problems when something 
unexpected occurs,

925
00:52:04,071 --> 00:52:05,720
right?
You don't know if it's some damn trivial

926
00:52:05,721 --> 00:52:06,554
thing because you haven't calibrated the
machine properly or whether you've just 

927
00:52:09,291 --> 00:52:10,110
discovered,
you know,

928
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:12,230
when new part of the secret to the 
universe.

929
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:13,513
So generally you should assume that 
you've calibrated your machine 

930
00:52:15,831 --> 00:52:16,664
improperly.
And I should also tell you something 

931
00:52:18,831 --> 00:52:22,160
about something that's akin to that 
from,

932
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:27,190
with regards to a self protective mode 
of reconstructing your Schema.

933
00:52:28,190 --> 00:52:32,000
So one of the things that happens to 
depressed people is something like this.

934
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,850
So maybe they go out and,
you know,

935
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,280
they try to have a conversation with 
someone in a coffee shop and you know,

936
00:52:37,281 --> 00:52:39,560
maybe that person's having a horrible 
day or maybe you know,

937
00:52:39,561 --> 00:52:41,300
they're very disagreeable and 
extroverted,

938
00:52:41,301 --> 00:52:42,134
which makes them kind of narcissistic.
And so there route and the depressed 

939
00:52:45,231 --> 00:52:49,550
person thinks I'm,
I can't talk to people.

940
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,370
It's bad people that can't bad,
useless people,

941
00:52:52,371 --> 00:52:54,200
can't talk to people.
I'm a bad,

942
00:52:54,201 --> 00:52:56,360
useless person.
I've always been a bad,

943
00:52:56,361 --> 00:52:58,310
useless person.
And as far as I can tell,

944
00:52:58,311 --> 00:52:59,144
I'm going to be a bad,
useless person as far as I can see into 

945
00:53:00,951 --> 00:53:02,840
the future.
Well,

946
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,280
you could say,
well,

947
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:05,900
what's wrong with that?
Because it's true.

948
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:06,763
Maybe it's true.
Maybe the reason the person won't talk 

949
00:53:08,631 --> 00:53:11,840
to you is because like,
you're just wrong in a million different

950
00:53:11,841 --> 00:53:16,250
ways,
but let's not jump to conclusions.

951
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:17,863
So the rule there,
the mental hygiene rule is picked the 

952
00:53:19,881 --> 00:53:20,714
simplest possible explanation and until 
you disprove that accepted and one of 

953
00:53:25,531 --> 00:53:26,670
them would be,
well you know,

954
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:28,770
that person's probably not having such a
good day,

955
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:31,710
or maybe that person's not having such a
good day,

956
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:32,843
you know?
Or maybe if I smiled at them a little 

957
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,980
more brightly and somewhat less 
pathologically,

958
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:39,960
they would have talked to me.
You know?

959
00:53:39,961 --> 00:53:43,830
So this is important to remember when 
you make mistakes in your life,

960
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:47,010
don't start out with generic high level 
criticisms.

961
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:49,770
You know,
it's a pathway to self-destruction,

962
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:54,630
assume minor alterable changes until 
proven until it's proven otherwise.

963
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:58,650
So anyways,
it's a big problem because it's not that

964
00:53:58,651 --> 00:53:59,484
easy to figure out why,
where the mistake is when you make a 

965
00:54:02,041 --> 00:54:03,930
mistake that stops you from getting what
you want.

966
00:54:03,931 --> 00:54:04,764
Yes,

967
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:09,640
yes it is.
It's the alchemist razor on the value on

968
00:54:09,641 --> 00:54:12,550
the value side of the equation.
Assume a small error.

969
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:18,040
Assume a small repairable error.
And then if that doesn't work out,

970
00:54:18,041 --> 00:54:20,740
then as soon as slightly large 
repairable error.

971
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:21,933
And I'll show you a Schema for 
understanding that in a minute that's 

972
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,640
akin to Piaget's construction of the 
world from the bottom up.

973
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:32,750
So let me show you that
here.

974
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,540
It's a very helpful diagram.
I think I can find it.

975
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:50,123
Alright,

976
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,460
we're going to go at this a couple of 
different ways.

977
00:54:53,670 --> 00:54:56,970
So
look at the top

978
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:59,950
diagram.
It's a hierarchy,

979
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:01,990
right?
So you might say,

980
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:03,910
what does it mean

981
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:09,700
to be a good person?
And you might think,

982
00:55:09,701 --> 00:55:10,900
well,
you know,

983
00:55:10,901 --> 00:55:11,734
that's an empirical question,
but from the [inaudible] or the 

984
00:55:14,681 --> 00:55:15,514
pragmatic perspective,
that's not exactly right because what 

985
00:55:17,741 --> 00:55:18,574
being a good person is and is an 
abstract representation of an 

986
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:22,923
aggregation of action oriented behaviors
in presuppositions that have the 

987
00:55:29,381 --> 00:55:34,030
similarity across context.
Now we're going to decompose it.

988
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,553
So this is for say an adult of about 35.
What's one element of being a good 

989
00:55:40,511 --> 00:55:42,850
person?
While you might say being a good parent,

990
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,370
it's not a necessary element,
but you know,

991
00:55:45,371 --> 00:55:46,990
it's one of the ones that would fit 
there.

992
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:49,060
So what does it mean to be a good 
parent?

993
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:49,923
While you could say roughly speaking 
that you have a good job and that you 

994
00:55:53,201 --> 00:55:55,840
take care of your family and then you 
might say,

995
00:55:55,841 --> 00:55:56,674
well,
what does it mean to take care of your 

996
00:55:57,461 --> 00:55:58,031
family?
Now,

997
00:55:58,031 --> 00:56:02,050
one of the things I would like you to 
note is that these are abstractions,

998
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:03,303
right?

999
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,500
Good person,
good parent,

1000
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:08,650
take care of your family.
There are abstractions.

1001
00:56:08,651 --> 00:56:09,484
The question is what do they represent 
or what are those abstractions made up 

1002
00:56:12,281 --> 00:56:12,671
of?
Now,

1003
00:56:12,671 --> 00:56:13,504
lots of the abstractions that are,
that we use are made up of descriptions 

1004
00:56:16,631 --> 00:56:20,020
of the world,
so scientific categories are like that,

1005
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:24,100
but these aren't scientific categories.
There are categories,

1006
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:28,780
so they're actually made up of actions 
not have object facts,

1007
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:29,623
objective facts.
They're not made out of objective 

1008
00:56:33,101 --> 00:56:35,620
material at all.
There are a whole different thing.

1009
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,180
Good person,
good parent,

1010
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:39,970
take care of your family.
Okay?

1011
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:42,370
What does it mean to take care of your 
family?

1012
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,500
Well,
there's a bunch of things that means,

1013
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:48,280
but one of them might be your cooked 
meals and you play with the baby.

1014
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:49,720
Okay,
so then,

1015
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:51,670
well,
what does it mean to complete a meal?

1016
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:52,623
Well,
it looks like in this example you're 

1017
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:55,450
cooking corn.

1018
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,300
So what do you have to do?
You have to cut it.

1019
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:01,240
You have to set the table,
you have to do dishes.

1020
00:57:01,241 --> 00:57:03,400
Now you can imagine you could decompose 
those two.

1021
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:05,290
What do you have to do if you're doing 
the dishes?

1022
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,360
Well,
you have to grip a dish.

1023
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,820
You have to move your hand in a twisting
motion.

1024
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:12,580
You have to push this arm forward and 
turn on the tap.

1025
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,850
Okay,
so what's cool about that is you can see

1026
00:57:15,851 --> 00:57:16,684
where the mind,
which is the part of us that's capable 

1027
00:57:20,891 --> 00:57:24,100
of abstract considerations,
meets the body,

1028
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:26,950
right?
Because people are always wondering,

1029
00:57:26,951 --> 00:57:28,660
well,
how do you solve the mind body problem?

1030
00:57:28,661 --> 00:57:30,100
While this is one of the ways you solve 
that,

1031
00:57:30,101 --> 00:57:30,934
you assume that abstract categories are 
actually abstract representations of 

1032
00:57:34,241 --> 00:57:35,074
patterns of action and then you 
decompose them till you get to that 

1033
00:57:37,811 --> 00:57:39,070
action.
It's like,

1034
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,440
how do you go underneath this?

1035
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:44,500
What's next on the hierarchy?
Well,

1036
00:57:44,501 --> 00:57:46,600
it doesn't matter because you're not 
conscious of it anyways.

1037
00:57:46,601 --> 00:57:48,330
It's muscle movements.
It's cell,

1038
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,070
it's electrical information that your 
cells are sharing.

1039
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:54,700
It's completely irrelevant to you.
It's not part of your consciousness.

1040
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:58,930
This is you can do this.
You can't move a thing.

1041
00:57:58,960 --> 00:57:59,793
You know you can't move an identifiable 
finger myself because you don't know 

1042
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:02,644
which ones they are.
So one of the things piaget would point 

1043
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:07,024
out is that one,
one of the characteristics of a baby 

1044
00:58:09,371 --> 00:58:11,440
when the baby's first born is that it 
has.

1045
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:12,453
It can do these sorts of things.
It comes equipped to do these sorts of 

1046
00:58:15,281 --> 00:58:17,410
things.
Those are basic reflexes.

1047
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,273
Now there are more basic than this,
but a child can do this and can stick 

1048
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:23,374
out its tongue,
which is really helpful because that 

1049
00:58:24,431 --> 00:58:26,860
means that it can mouth everything in 
its vicinity,

1050
00:58:26,861 --> 00:58:27,694
which is exactly what a child does and 
the reason it does that is because this 

1051
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:32,013
little exploratory apparatus here is 
quite wired up and so what the child 

1052
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:36,603
assumes,
so to speak first is the world is a 

1053
00:58:38,591 --> 00:58:42,130
place to put in your mouth and that's 
why babies are always putting everything

1054
00:58:42,131 --> 00:58:43,030
they can in their mouth.

1055
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:47,170
Now you know the tongue is absolutely 
covered with sensory and motor nerves,

1056
00:58:47,171 --> 00:58:52,171
so it's unbelievably,
unbelievably fast style exploratory tool

1057
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:53,703
and so the child starts to extract out 
information about the world by using 

1058
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,073
its.
Its oral reflex is to a large degree to 

1059
00:59:00,821 --> 00:59:02,620
begin with.
Now it can also move its eyes,

1060
00:59:02,621 --> 00:59:03,454
although it's not really quite so good 
about that and you know because it's 

1061
00:59:05,561 --> 00:59:06,690
eyes cross a fair,
Beth.

1062
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,800
It takes a while to get both of them 
coordinated.

1063
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:12,220
You can hear things and so on.
It's got a sense of touch.

1064
00:59:12,221 --> 00:59:13,054
So,
but it's equipped to start operating on 

1065
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:20,080
the world at the highest resolution 
level of analysis.

1066
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:25,200
So we could say think about it this way,
as you move up a chain of abstractions,

1067
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:29,660
your representations get lower and lower
in resolution.

1068
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:32,240
I understand.
So for example,

1069
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:37,720
being a good person is a much lower 
resolution description than picking up a

1070
00:59:38,361 --> 00:59:40,340
fork prior to setting it on the table.

1071
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:44,870
Although picking up a fork is a micro 
element of being a good person.

1072
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:45,943
So that's a high resolution description.
So another thing that you can know is 

1073
00:59:49,131 --> 00:59:49,964
that if you make a mistake,
try to decompose the problem into high 

1074
00:59:53,031 --> 00:59:56,330
resolution representations.
It's lazy not to,

1075
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:58,670
not only that,
it's insulting.

1076
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:01,880
So you know,
you come home and maybe your partner has

1077
01:00:01,881 --> 01:00:05,090
agreed to make a meal and the thing is 
like scorched to death,

1078
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:06,253
you know,
and so you say you are not a good 

1079
01:00:07,851 --> 01:00:08,684
person,
you've never been a good person and 

1080
01:00:09,621 --> 01:00:11,390
you're never going to be a good person.
It's like,

1081
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:14,240
well they're not a good person in so far
as they weren't able to,

1082
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:15,770
you know,
make the meal.

1083
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:18,410
But you could start with a micro 
analysis,

1084
01:00:18,770 --> 01:00:23,770
it's like why exactly did that burn 
since that's not the desired outcome,

1085
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:25,123
you know,
and then you can help the person 

1086
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:31,160
disentangle the sequence and you can 
find out where the error occurred.

1087
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:33,620
Now maybe they were distracted by 
something else or whatever.

1088
01:00:33,621 --> 01:00:36,320
But it's,
it's a very difficult analytic process.

1089
01:00:36,321 --> 01:00:37,154
But I can tell you if you're going to 
maintain an equilibrium state with 

1090
01:00:41,421 --> 01:00:42,254
yourself and with people around you,
stay away from the low resolution 

1091
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:46,274
abstractions.
When you're discussing something 

1092
01:00:47,361 --> 01:00:49,730
important,
go down to the micro level,

1093
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:51,043
you know.
So here's an example that you might 

1094
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:55,020
consider with regards to children as 
they develop.

1095
01:00:55,021 --> 01:00:58,370
So the baby's laying on his crib on its 
back,

1096
01:00:58,371 --> 01:01:00,080
you know,
when it's trying to get its act together

1097
01:01:00,081 --> 01:01:03,840
and it's going to organize its arms and 
its got to organize its legs and its got

1098
01:01:03,841 --> 01:01:06,050
to figure out how to move them because 
it's just hitting them,

1099
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:08,540
hitting itself in the head with its 
arms.

1100
01:01:08,810 --> 01:01:11,810
Piaget would say child will be laying 
there and go like this.

1101
01:01:11,811 --> 01:01:15,380
And that'll sort of startle them.
And then one of the things they'll do is

1102
01:01:15,381 --> 01:01:16,340
try to do it again.

1103
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:22,060
So in that way the child uses imitation 
of itself to start building up the basis

1104
01:01:23,181 --> 01:01:25,760
of predictability.
It's bloody brilliant idea,

1105
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:27,170
you know,
so.

1106
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:29,023
So that's part of the groundwork that 
the child lays to start understanding 

1107
01:01:31,731 --> 01:01:32,564
the world is going to be putting things 
in its mouth and then it's gonna notice 

1108
01:01:34,551 --> 01:01:35,384
similarities between the way something 
feels and how it feels when it's in the 

1109
01:01:38,871 --> 01:01:43,250
mouth and it's going to notice that this
motion is good for grabbing bottles,

1110
01:01:43,251 --> 01:01:45,560
but it's also good for grabbing like 
teddy bears.

1111
01:01:45,561 --> 01:01:49,070
So maybe teddy bears and bottles are in 
the same category to begin with.

1112
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:53,660
And the category is things you can grab 
and bring close to you,

1113
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:54,553
you know,
which is a perfectly reasonable 

1114
01:01:55,251 --> 01:01:56,084
category.
So it's not an objective category and 

1115
01:01:58,161 --> 01:01:58,994
the child is changing all these things 
together and developing more and more 

1116
01:02:01,341 --> 01:02:03,980
sophisticated abilities with its body.

1117
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:07,790
And at the same time because it becomes 
more facile with its body,

1118
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,210
it can analyze the world at a higher and
higher level of resolution.

1119
01:02:11,211 --> 01:02:16,040
And so it's the circular process.
Information in development of tools,

1120
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:19,010
expansion of knowledge,
information,

1121
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:21,300
development of tools,
expansion of knowledge.

1122
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:22,343
You sort of boost yourself up 
fundamentally and you do it from the 

1123
01:02:25,291 --> 01:02:26,820
bottom up.
Now,

1124
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:28,403
let's say you've got a three year old.
This is a good example of how children 

1125
01:02:31,111 --> 01:02:32,820
different different developmental 
stages,

1126
01:02:32,821 --> 01:02:34,710
so maybe have a 15 year old.
You say,

1127
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:36,960
clean up your room.
Now.

1128
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:39,180
That is a low resolution 
representations.

1129
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:43,770
Now when you use that low resolution 
representation on the 15 year old,

1130
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:46,710
you assume that they know the following 
things,

1131
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:48,600
so we're going to put that aside for a 
moment.

1132
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,980
Now you're talking to a three year old 
and you're in their room and the room is

1133
01:02:52,981 --> 01:02:57,090
scattered with junk because they'd been 
played and you say,

1134
01:02:57,330 --> 01:03:01,620
now it's time to clean up your room and 
then you leave and then you come back in

1135
01:03:01,621 --> 01:03:02,850
20 minutes and what's happened?

1136
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:05,323
No,
the child is playing with some toy and 

1137
01:03:06,181 --> 01:03:06,960
you say,
you know,

1138
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:07,793
didn't you hear what I said?
And the answer to that is while I heard 

1139
01:03:10,501 --> 01:03:11,334
it,
but I didn't have any idea what you 

1140
01:03:11,971 --> 01:03:12,804
meant and the reason that I didn't have 
any idea what humanity is because I 

1141
01:03:15,481 --> 01:03:18,000
don't have the microprocesses embodied 
in me.

1142
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,100
So they need to take the three year old 
and you say,

1143
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:23,250
do you see your bare?
And the child goes,

1144
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:24,263
yes,
because they've got seeing down you 

1145
01:03:27,121 --> 01:03:29,040
point.
They can see what you're pointing at.

1146
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,590
Great.
That's a little micro routine.

1147
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,620
And then you say,
couldn't you go pick up that bear?

1148
01:03:34,621 --> 01:03:35,454
And they know that one too.
So then they'll go pick up the bear and 

1149
01:03:37,681 --> 01:03:40,920
then you might point to a spa space on 
the shelf that's empty.

1150
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:41,933
And you could say,
well could you put that bear in that 

1151
01:03:43,831 --> 01:03:44,280
space?

1152
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,113
And they've got that too.
So then you want to help them clean up 

1153
01:03:48,001 --> 01:03:49,800
the room,
but you don't want to do it for them.

1154
01:03:49,801 --> 01:03:50,730
Well,
what do you do?

1155
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:54,420
You build up all the micro routines and 
it's painstaking,

1156
01:03:54,421 --> 01:03:55,530
Hey,
if you're a parent,

1157
01:03:55,531 --> 01:03:57,810
you're just going to think,
well go play all cleaned up the room.

1158
01:03:57,811 --> 01:03:58,644
But then you'll be cleaning it up until 
the child is 15 because they won't 

1159
01:04:01,431 --> 01:04:02,264
develop the micro routines,
so you might as well just start right 

1160
01:04:04,621 --> 01:04:05,454
off the bat and go through the 
painstaking process of building up the 

1161
01:04:08,641 --> 01:04:09,474
procedural knowledge as the ground for 
the abstract conceptions because the 

1162
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:17,390
next time the child you want the child 
to clean up the room,

1163
01:04:17,410 --> 01:04:18,243
you could start by saying,
pick up the toys on the floor and put 

1164
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:22,224
them where there is space on the shelf 
and maybe they've generalized across 

1165
01:04:26,611 --> 01:04:27,750
those,
you know,

1166
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:29,663
more concrete instances of cleaning up 
so that they can use the abstract 

1167
01:04:33,241 --> 01:04:35,370
representation to govern themselves.

1168
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:36,203
So this also helps you figure out what 
it means for something to mean 

1169
01:04:39,931 --> 01:04:42,300
something.
He might say,

1170
01:04:42,301 --> 01:04:45,360
well that's meaningful for what?
What does that mean?

1171
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:46,553
Well,
it means that partly it means that you 

1172
01:04:48,031 --> 01:04:48,864
have the underlying structure so that 
you can take the abstract utterance and 

1173
01:04:52,201 --> 01:04:55,170
decompose it into actionable sequences 
in the world.

1174
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:56,423
Now,
sometimes meaningful also means you 

1175
01:04:58,381 --> 01:04:59,214
could use the information to rate,
configure the abstractions that you use 

1176
01:05:02,971 --> 01:05:06,000
to guide action in the world.
So that's a bit more complicated.

1177
01:05:06,001 --> 01:05:09,660
But you get the point now,
part of the reason we can communicate,

1178
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:11,453
and this is quite interesting and this 
is sort of in keeping with Piaget's 

1179
01:05:13,561 --> 01:05:17,620
ideas,
is I kind of knew what you know now.

1180
01:05:17,621 --> 01:05:18,910
Why do I know that?
Well,

1181
01:05:18,911 --> 01:05:21,730
it's because it's not because I know you
because I don't,

1182
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:27,420
but it's because you're like me a lot.
I mean physiologically we're not clones,

1183
01:05:28,421 --> 01:05:29,254
but the similarities are obviously there
so I can assume that you have some 

1184
01:05:34,631 --> 01:05:38,350
relationship with your body that more or
less parallel is the relationship I have

1185
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:43,351
with my body and then I can also assume 
that since that the environment you grew

1186
01:05:44,681 --> 01:05:49,270
up in was sufficiently similar to the 
environment that I grew up in,

1187
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:50,433
so that the Schema of actions and 
abstractions that constitutes your 

1188
01:05:55,271 --> 01:05:56,104
personality is similar enough to mind so
that I can use abstractions and you'll 

1189
01:06:00,281 --> 01:06:01,180
know what they mean.

1190
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:06,610
And so it's a very complex and 
sophisticated theory of communication,

1191
01:06:06,611 --> 01:06:07,840
right?
Because it assumes that,

1192
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,540
well,
where is the meaning in a word?

1193
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:12,813
The word is embedded in the phrase and 
the phrase is embedded in that sentence 

1194
01:06:14,921 --> 01:06:16,420
and so on,
so that's complicated,

1195
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:17,673
but the meaning is,
is that I compress a whole sequence of 

1196
01:06:21,281 --> 01:06:26,281
action strategies and representational 
Schema is into a phrase and I toss it to

1197
01:06:27,041 --> 01:06:30,250
you and you decompose it and then you've
got the meaning,

1198
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:31,490
you know,
in some,

1199
01:06:31,490 --> 01:06:35,290
some like you can't do something like,
well,

1200
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:38,140
how do you play the piano while you sit 
in front of it?

1201
01:06:38,141 --> 01:06:40,390
Move your hands up and down the keys.
Right?

1202
01:06:40,391 --> 01:06:41,224
That's too low resolution to be useful,
but especially if I know that you don't 

1203
01:06:46,781 --> 01:06:48,070
know how to play the piano,
but if,

1204
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:48,933
if I can assume sufficient shared 
experience and shared biological 

1205
01:06:52,181 --> 01:06:53,014
commonality,
then I can use high level abstractions 

1206
01:06:54,821 --> 01:06:57,550
and we can exchange information.
So.

1207
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:03,460
All right,
so the PSD and notion,

1208
01:07:03,461 --> 01:07:04,750
at least in part,
is that

1209
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:07,113
you're interacting with the world 
constantly and you're doing that in 

1210
01:07:09,431 --> 01:07:14,431
order to extract out from the world what
you need and to increase your competence

1211
01:07:14,741 --> 01:07:16,810
at getting what you need.
Right?

1212
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:19,120
So that's a cool idea too.
So,

1213
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:22,960
and here is a way of understanding that 
way of understanding,

1214
01:07:22,961 --> 01:07:25,330
of celebrated states at a high level of 
abstraction.

1215
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:28,810
So think about this.
So

1216
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:34,370
your kids in a soccer game and uh,

1217
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:37,143
let's say trip someone in elbows with 
them and the referee doesn't catch on 

1218
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:41,733
and their team wins the game and maybe 
their team wins the game because he 

1219
01:07:44,321 --> 01:07:47,020
tripped him and elbowed him and the kid 
comes off the court,

1220
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,090
the pitch.
Yes.

1221
01:07:49,450 --> 01:07:53,380
And says we won.
And what do you say?

1222
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:54,603
Well,
if you're like 30 percent of the soccer 

1223
01:07:56,591 --> 01:07:58,360
parents I saw you say,
good job,

1224
01:07:58,361 --> 01:08:00,040
you should have kicked them again,
but that,

1225
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:01,900
that isn't what you shouldn't say.
Right?

1226
01:08:01,901 --> 01:08:02,734
You shouldn't say that's no way to win.
And then the question might be what in 

1227
01:08:07,811 --> 01:08:10,870
the world do you mean by that?
Because as far as the child's concerned,

1228
01:08:10,871 --> 01:08:13,240
hypothetically,
they just one.

1229
01:08:13,241 --> 01:08:16,980
And that's the point of the game.
So when you say that's no way to win,

1230
01:08:16,981 --> 01:08:18,570
what do you mean?
Well,

1231
01:08:18,571 --> 01:08:19,404
think about it this way.
What's the definition of winning at 

1232
01:08:25,361 --> 01:08:26,194
soccer?

1233
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:29,150
Well,
one question is well,

1234
01:08:29,450 --> 01:08:30,770
winning the game.
Well,

1235
01:08:30,771 --> 01:08:31,730
yeah,
that's kind of,

1236
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:34,860
that's a little too high resolution for 
the current purposes.

1237
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:35,713
Like how about um,
developing your skill as a physical 

1238
01:08:39,801 --> 01:08:40,634
being,
Huh?

1239
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:41,833
That's a good one.
Developing your skill in a physical 

1240
01:08:43,341 --> 01:08:44,174
being as a physical,
being in a manner that will translate 

1241
01:08:47,121 --> 01:08:49,820
into success in other domains of the 
world,

1242
01:08:50,540 --> 01:08:51,373
that's even better.
You get to be well developed physically 

1243
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:53,893
and it works more places.
How about developing your physical 

1244
01:08:57,351 --> 01:08:58,184
abilities in a manner that ensures that 
lots of people invite you to play games 

1245
01:09:01,461 --> 01:09:05,390
for the rest of your life?
That's a really good deal.

1246
01:09:05,570 --> 01:09:07,400
And so when you say,
well,

1247
01:09:07,401 --> 01:09:08,720
it doesn't matter whether you win or 
lose,

1248
01:09:08,721 --> 01:09:09,554
it matters how you play the game.
What you're saying is the proper 

1249
01:09:12,021 --> 01:09:14,570
equilibrated status,
not victory within a game.

1250
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:15,883
It's

1251
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:18,053
the ability to play many games and to 
extract value from each instance of 

1252
01:09:22,141 --> 01:09:22,974
playing.
And then you went across huge swaths of 

1253
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:30,180
time instead of sacrificing that to some
trivial local victory.

1254
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:35,400
And that's another example of how 
morality emerges from the bottom up,

1255
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:36,263
from the games that people play.
So there's actions and then there's the 

1256
01:09:40,081 --> 01:09:40,914
integration of actions.
And schema within yourself as an 

1257
01:09:42,691 --> 01:09:43,524
individual.
Then you kind of got your act together 

1258
01:09:45,450 --> 01:09:46,283
as a two to four year old and you better
have your act together by the time 

1259
01:09:49,231 --> 01:09:50,064
you're for enough so that other children
will play with you because otherwise 

1260
01:09:53,011 --> 01:09:53,844
you're basically screwed for life.
You cannot be fixed after that and 

1261
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:57,984
there's endless amounts of evidence 
showing that so he kind of got yourself 

1262
01:10:01,231 --> 01:10:05,460
together by the time year two to four 
enough so that other people can tolerate

1263
01:10:05,461 --> 01:10:06,294
you and then you start playing games 
with them and the Games are cooperative 

1264
01:10:09,061 --> 01:10:12,180
and competitive and if you're good at 
playing,

1265
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:15,390
which means you are fair across multiple
instances of the game,

1266
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:16,433
then you'll have lots of friends and 
you'll be able to play with them and 

1267
01:10:18,361 --> 01:10:19,194
then you'll have a whole network of 
games which has all the games you play 

1268
01:10:23,431 --> 01:10:25,560
with all your friends and all the 
different circumstances.

1269
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:28,590
And then you're going to learn how to be
a good player across all those games.

1270
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:29,633
And hopefully the environment that 
constitutes the shared elements of that 

1271
01:10:34,321 --> 01:10:37,890
set of games is similar to the adult 
environment.

1272
01:10:37,891 --> 01:10:38,724
That constitutes a whole set of things 
that you'll do when you're an adult and 

1273
01:10:42,541 --> 01:10:46,170
that'll mean that you're socialized 
enough to start to develop some autonomy

1274
01:10:46,171 --> 01:10:51,060
and individuality and independence and 
that's all emerging from the bottom up.

1275
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:54,600
It's not a top down.
It's not instantiated from the top down.

1276
01:10:54,601 --> 01:10:55,434
It's a natural progression of moral 
systematizing in society as a whole and 

1277
01:11:00,331 --> 01:11:05,331
also a natural progression of your 
adaptations to that system as you mature

1278
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:07,433
and that in 90 minutes or thereabouts is
the essence of Piagetian theory and 

1279
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:16,290
there's some elements of a lot of what 
you learn if you take piaget,

1280
01:11:16,291 --> 01:11:17,124
generally speaking is stage theory and 
compared to what piaget was really up 

1281
01:11:20,161 --> 01:11:20,360
to.

1282
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:21,193
Stage theory is pretty much irrelevant 
because what I laid out for you today 

1283
01:11:23,971 --> 01:11:27,660
was really what he was up to and all the
things that he was doing in the multiple

1284
01:11:27,661 --> 01:11:28,494
publications that he laid out were 
attempts to determine how does society 

1285
01:11:32,851 --> 01:11:33,684
organizes itself from the bottom up and 
how does the individual do the same 

1286
01:11:36,451 --> 01:11:37,284
thing.
And it's extremely useful way of 

1287
01:11:38,911 --> 01:11:40,430
thinking.
You know,

1288
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:41,303
so.
And it will close with this from a 

1289
01:11:44,431 --> 01:11:45,264
practical perspective because I try to 
only teach you things that I think have 

1290
01:11:47,941 --> 01:11:51,180
practical utility.
So that means if you know them,

1291
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:52,613
you'll understand yourself and others 
better and you'll get along with them 

1292
01:11:55,531 --> 01:12:00,120
better and that the consequences of that
will be that you're better placed in the

1293
01:12:00,121 --> 01:12:03,060
social world and that'll make the social
world somewhat better.

1294
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:05,280
So what's the take home message from 
this?

1295
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:09,450
Well,
one is the most important one I think is

1296
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:11,453
don't use high level negative 
abstractions to characterize your 

1297
01:12:14,851 --> 01:12:16,860
behavior or that of others.

1298
01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:19,860
What you have to do is.
The thing is,

1299
01:12:19,861 --> 01:12:23,280
is that if you have someone,
for example,

1300
01:12:23,281 --> 01:12:24,840
maybe you have a roommate who can't 
cook,

1301
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:25,763
or maybe you are that roommate.
So like in order to help someone like 

1302
01:12:29,161 --> 01:12:29,994
that,
you have to decompose the process until 

1303
01:12:32,191 --> 01:12:34,560
you hit the level at which they're 
competent.

1304
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:40,430
And then you have to
teach them how to integrate those things

1305
01:12:41,281 --> 01:12:43,650
that they know into the next stage of 
development.

1306
01:12:43,651 --> 01:12:47,280
So it's a complex decomposition and then
you were actually helpful.

1307
01:12:47,281 --> 01:12:48,114
And now you'll find when you have an 
intimate relationship with someone that 

1308
01:12:50,611 --> 01:12:54,120
you want to last over the long run,
I can give you a couple of hands.

1309
01:12:54,270 --> 01:12:58,140
One is do not use high level negative 
abstractions.

1310
01:12:58,680 --> 01:12:59,513
They'll hate you and for good reason 
because you're criticizing them in a 

1311
01:13:03,331 --> 01:13:07,230
generic and stupid manner.
What you want to do is first of all,

1312
01:13:07,231 --> 01:13:08,064
help them identify the problem at the 
highest level of resolution necessary 

1313
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:15,990
and then implement a solution that will 
actually solve the problem.

1314
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:17,003
Now that often takes a fair bit of 
conflict and a fair bit of immediate 

1315
01:13:20,311 --> 01:13:21,144
analysis.
It's difficult and so people will avoid 

1316
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:24,420
it,
but if you do that,

1317
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:28,770
every time you do that and it works,
that's a problem you'll never have again

1318
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:31,140
in your life.
That's a really good deal.

1319
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:34,770
So it beats the hell out of ignoring it 
and hoping that it'll go away.

1320
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:38,880
So all right,
so we'll see you

1321
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:41,483
Thursday.
