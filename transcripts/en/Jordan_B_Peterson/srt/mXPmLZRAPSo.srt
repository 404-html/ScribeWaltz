1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:06,870
It's January 13th,
2019.

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:12,710
Happy New Year to you all and thank you 
for joining the

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,220
q and a.
so,

4
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,143
um,
I'll start with a couple of 

5
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:19,884
announcements.
The first I suppose is that I'm leaving 

6
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,400
Patrion January 15th.
Some of you may know that that's,

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,473
I suppose,
in protest over their treatment of Carl 

8
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,393
Benjamin,
a perhaps better known as Sargon of a 

9
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:42,201
cad I'm patron like many companies seems
to believe that their role now is to act

10
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:44,844
as sensor for speech patterns or speech 
content that they regard as 

11
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,900
unacceptable.
And uh,

12
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,240
I think that they made a big mistake 
with Sargon and so both Dave Rubin and I

13
00:00:57,241 --> 00:00:58,074
and also Sam Harris have decided to 
leave patron and that's going to be 

14
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:02,454
official as of January 15th.
So those of you who are my patron on 

15
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:08,634
subscribers,
if you're interested in continuing with 

16
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:11,634
that subscription,
you can go to my website at Jordan b 

17
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,570
Peterson Dotcom and there's a support 
button there,

18
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,200
uh,
in the menu and you can use that system.

19
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,100
I'm also trying to design a system that,
at least in principle,

20
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,470
might work as a reasonable replacement 
for patriotic.

21
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,530
That's a couple of months away,
but we're working hard on it.

22
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:33,943
We're getting legal advice.
We're going to set up multiple payment 

23
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:36,534
channels so that it won't be easy for 
people to be kicked off by credit card 

24
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:46,461
companies or let's call them virtue 
signaling a ethical types who think that

25
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:50,184
their role is to police free speech.
So I think this is a very bad precedent 

26
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:56,820
that patronage is set and the credit 
card companies to.

27
00:01:56,821 --> 00:01:57,654
I can't imagine it's difficult to 
imagine a more dystopian scenario than 

28
00:02:02,011 --> 00:02:02,844
to have the large tech companies in 
combination with the credit card 

29
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:08,214
companies monitor your spending to 
decide when what you're doing is 

30
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:11,904
sufficiently ethical by their,
by the standards of the people who are 

31
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,124
running their,
let's call them safety and security 

32
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:22,830
speech monitoring programs.
It's just such a terrible idea.

33
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,470
So there's that,
um,

34
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,610
that I'm also working on my new book 
quite a lot,

35
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,000
but actually,
um,

36
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,213
it's tentatively titled Beyond Order 
Twelve more rules for life or perhaps 

37
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:43,260
beyond mere order.
I haven't decided on that yet.

38
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,090
I can tell you what the rules are.
Maybe you'd be interested in that.

39
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:52,530
So I'll give you a list of them.
The first one is,

40
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,940
do not carelessly denigrates social 
institutions or creative achievement

41
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,590
rule to imagine who you could be and 
then aim singlemindedly at that.

42
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,610
Rule three,
work as hard as you can,

43
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,120
work as hard as you possibly can on at 
least one thing and see what happens.

44
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,433
Rule four,
do not hide unwanted things in the fog 

45
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:27,450
rule five,
abandoned ideology,

46
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,150
abandoned ideology.
Rule six,

47
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,000
notice that opportunity lurks where 
responsibility has been abdicated.

48
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,470
Rule seven,
do not do things that you hate.

49
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:42,563
Rule eight,
try to make one room in your house as 

50
00:03:44,551 --> 00:03:47,940
beautiful as possible.
Rule Nine,

51
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,433
if all memories still make you cry,
right them down carefully and 

52
00:03:53,461 --> 00:03:54,294
completely.

53
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:00,290
Rule Ten.
Plan and work diligently to maintain the

54
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:04,250
romance in your relationship.
Rule Eleven,

55
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:09,460
be grateful in spite of your suffering.
And then rule 12,

56
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:12,320
do not allow yourself to become 
resentful,

57
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,060
deceitful,
or arrogant.

58
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:15,643
In principle,
that book will be published in January 

59
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,320
20 slash 20.
So,

60
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,273
and I'm supposed to have the manuscript 
and sometime within the next six months 

61
00:04:25,221 --> 00:04:29,420
and I have a first draft done and I'm 
working hard on the repeated edits,

62
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,533
um,
it's going to be published similar in 

63
00:04:32,841 --> 00:04:35,540
the UK and the US and Canada.
Um,

64
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,433
I'm working with three different editors
and so that's that part of the 

65
00:04:40,941 --> 00:04:41,774
announcement and so I'm hoping,
I'm really hoping that I can make the 

66
00:04:44,181 --> 00:04:46,440
next book better.
Like it would be a pair,

67
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,100
it'll be a paired copy with the first 
one.

68
00:04:49,101 --> 00:04:49,934
I'm probably going to publish it with a 
black cover to go with the white cover 

69
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,523
of 12 rules and I'm hoping that I can 
make it into a better book and that the 

70
00:04:57,201 --> 00:04:59,480
two together will make a very complete 
set.

71
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,140
So that's the plan.
We'll see how it goes.

72
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,660
The last announcement,
I guess.

73
00:05:05,661 --> 00:05:06,980
No,
two more announcements.

74
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,440
I'm going to Switzerland tomorrow.
Um,

75
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,730
my daughter's having surgery there to 
get her ankle fixed again.

76
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:17,923
We're hoping that that will go well.
I'm also doing a talk in Zurich and I 

77
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:25,070
have three talks in California.
Information for them,

78
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,780
Miss Jordan,
b Peterson,

79
00:05:26,781 --> 00:05:31,610
dark com forward slash events.
And then in February,

80
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,590
my wife and I are going,
my wife,

81
00:05:33,591 --> 00:05:38,060
Tammy and I are going to Australia,
New Zealand and I believe we have 15,

82
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,900
a talk scheduled there over the course 
of about a month.

83
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:43,723
And then I think in March and April I'm 
going to concentrate mostly on writing 

84
00:05:46,131 --> 00:05:48,470
and then perhaps we're going to go to 
Europe.

85
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,783
And so that's for a month or two that 
will depend to some degree on the 

86
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:55,550
writing schedule,
but that's the plan at the moment.

87
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,380
I have some good podcasts up.

88
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,213
I talked to General Stanley mcchrystal 
last week about his new book on 

89
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:05,270
leadership and the myths that surround 
it,

90
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,213
um,
and some of the initiatives that he's 

91
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:12,530
been working on in the United States.
And so what crystal was the commander of

92
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,393
the American forces in Afghanistan.
And so it was very interesting to talk 

93
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:19,310
to him.
And uh,

94
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:23,720
well there's a variety of other things 
going on too,

95
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:27,410
but I won't tell you anymore about those
for the time being.

96
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:30,050
I think what I'll do instead is turning 
to some questions.

97
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,890
So,
um,

98
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,770
I guess maybe I could also give a bit of
a recap for 2018,

99
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,240
so tammy and I have gone to about 115 
cities now,

100
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,283
something like that.
Her Google a trip trackers showed that 

101
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:49,880
she had gone six times around the world 
mindset 20.

102
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,480
And so that's obviously wrong because I 
traveled mostly with her,

103
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:58,481
but there was a lot of traveling last 
year I spoke to about 250,000 people and

104
00:06:58,521 --> 00:06:59,354
that was a very,
all of that was very positive 

105
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:04,460
experience.
The lectures have been really,

106
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:05,783
um,

107
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,940
well,
heart warming to use an old term.

108
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,320
I mean it's really something to see that
many people gathered together and,

109
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,590
and listen and,
and,

110
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,880
and participate in a discussion about

111
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,983
about

112
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:22,403
psychological and philosophical and 
spiritual issues that as deep as I can 

113
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:29,814
manage anyways,
and it seems to be quite gripping for 

114
00:07:32,071 --> 00:07:34,440
the audience and good for everyone.
And so they're very,

115
00:07:34,441 --> 00:07:35,274
very positive experiences,
which is partly why we've been able to 

116
00:07:38,581 --> 00:07:42,900
sustain this speaking pace.
So that's been good.

117
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,610
Oh,
we also have a discount by the way.

118
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,250
My partners and I decided to,

119
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,603
um,

120
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,723
encourage everybody to make their new 
year's resolutions in a sophisticated 

121
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,840
and comprehensive way.
And so we have this program,

122
00:08:03,841 --> 00:08:04,674
some of you have heard about 
this@selfauthoring.com called future 

123
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,163
authoring.
And the future authoring program helps 

124
00:08:11,221 --> 00:08:12,054
you write out a vision for the future to
think through what you'd like your life 

125
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:19,950
to be like if you were taking care of 
yourself properly,

126
00:08:19,951 --> 00:08:20,784
to consider your friends and your family
and your career and your education and 

127
00:08:24,511 --> 00:08:29,100
your use of time outside of work and 
your ability to resist temptation,

128
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,080
that kind of temptation that might drag 
you down and a

129
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,340
and how you might take care of yourself 
mentally and physically.

130
00:08:37,341 --> 00:08:39,890
And to write about that.
And then to write a counter,

131
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:44,420
a story which was where you might be 
three to five years down the road if you

132
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:46,430
let all your bad habits get out of 
control.

133
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,720
And then to write a strategic plan.
It's a very useful program.

134
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:53,480
We've used it with lots of university 
students in particular,

135
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:55,830
although it's for,
for adults of all ages.

136
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,073
Um,
and if you're a university student and 

137
00:08:59,101 --> 00:08:59,934
you complete the program,
it seems to increase the probability 

138
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:04,710
that you'll stay in university by about 
25 percent,

139
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,230
something like that.
Um,

140
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,120
it seems particularly useful by the way,
for men,

141
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:11,820
for reasons that we don't exactly 
understand,

142
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:12,654
maybe because they're underperforming 
women academically and it also improves 

143
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:17,364
people's grades,
but there's a large literature in the 

144
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:24,450
industrial organizational area also 
indicating that if you're,

145
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,343
like,
if you're working and you make a 

146
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,374
personal plan of this sort and your 
overall productivity increases by about 

147
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:35,390
10 percent,
which is a lot and you're,

148
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,070
you're more likely to be physically and 
mentally healthy.

149
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,340
And so I would really recommend trying 
this.

150
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:42,174
Even you can try the program.
You don't have to do a perfect job at 

151
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:45,414
it.
It doesn't really matter because you're 

152
00:09:46,441 --> 00:09:47,274
trying to set out a bit of a vision and 
a plan for your life and you need that 

153
00:09:49,831 --> 00:09:50,664
because you need direction and you need 
purpose and you need the constraints of 

154
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,210
a vision to help you be less anxious and
uncertain.

155
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,230
And,
and you,

156
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,450
you have that anxiety and uncertainty 
reduction does occur.

157
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:06,360
If you have a decent map of where it is 
that you're headed,

158
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,720
the coupon code is [inaudible] 2019,
New Year's 2019 and why 2019.

159
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:14,663
And if you go to the self authoring site
and click on the product's a menu item 

160
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,673
and go to future author and you could 
just enter in that coupon code and it's 

161
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:25,674
50 percent off.
So I think the total price is $7 and 

162
00:10:28,111 --> 00:10:31,560
forty five cents,
which is actually pretty damn cheap.

163
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,890
If what it does is help structure your 
future.

164
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:37,020
And I really do think this is a helpful 
program.

165
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:37,883
We've worked on it a lot and tested lot 
and it's based on solid behavioral 

166
00:10:42,121 --> 00:10:42,954
psychological principles.
Lie with I would say a certain degree 

167
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:48,540
of,
of optimistic philosophy.

168
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,610
And it's,

169
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,103
well

170
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,380
it's a good thing to do

171
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,850
and um,

172
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,360
this is a good time to do it.
So if you're interested,

173
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:03,330
all that information will be in the 
description of the video as well.

174
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,500
So that's basically that.
Um,

175
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:06,983
as far as I can tell,
I don't think I have anything else to 

176
00:11:09,331 --> 00:11:11,250
tell you.
Oh,

177
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:15,300
I'm 12 rules for life has sold about 3 
million copies now.

178
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,130
So I guess I'm telling you that,
uh,

179
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,060
it's become very popular in Korea where 
it sold about 200,000 copies,

180
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:24,660
which is quite interesting in something 
I wouldn't have necessarily expected.

181
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,010
So.
Alright.

182
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:32,090
So let's answer some questions and see 
how that goes.

183
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,433
Can you talk about your own specific 
experiences slash methods used with 

184
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:41,040
integrating the shadow?
Yeah,

185
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,560
well I can actually,

186
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:50,490
I think a tremendous amount of what you 
might regard as shadow integration,

187
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:52,503
which in the parlance of behavioral 
psychologists would be something like 

188
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:58,360
assertiveness training,
right?

189
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,900
It's training and how to stand up for 
yourself and for your,

190
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,340
let's say for your better self,
which would be the self that you can use

191
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,263
productively over a medium to long 
period of time that would be of use to 

192
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,570
you,
but also views to people around you.

193
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:18,571
So it's a self that's founded by the 
necessity of taking care of yourself,

194
00:12:19,151 --> 00:12:22,060
but also simultaneously taking care of 
the people around you.

195
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,423
Um,

196
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:31,510
I think that the simplest way to start 
that work is to consult your resentment.

197
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,653
You know,
it's easy to become bitter about life 

198
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:37,534
and to become angry because of course 
life is difficult and it's full of 

199
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:42,184
disappointments and people are also 
subject to be trail on the part of 

200
00:12:46,901 --> 00:12:49,900
themselves and the people that 
hypothetically care for them.

201
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:50,734
And so it's easy to get bitter and to be
resentful and resentment is a very 

202
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:58,210
useful emotion even though I think it's 
one of the most,

203
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:02,080
uh,
damaging emotions if it's not dealt with

204
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:02,914
properly.
So if you're resentful basically means 

205
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:06,783
only one of two things,
it either means you should grow up and 

206
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:14,041
quit whining and get on with your life 
or it means that you're being subject to

207
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,510
tyrannical forces of one form or another
maybe emanating from you.

208
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,730
Maybe a consequence of the natural 
environment,

209
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,350
maybe a consequence of society.

210
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,423
You're being subject to tyrannical 
forces and you're not putting your own 

211
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,423
best interests forward.
Like in that broader sense that I 

212
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:35,380
described.
And I don't mean you're selfish,

213
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:40,381
narrow interests that only serve the 
purposes of instantaneous gratification.

214
00:13:40,481 --> 00:13:41,314
I mean your own best interest in terms 
of developing your character over the 

215
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:47,410
span of your life.
If you're resentful,

216
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,370
it either means that you're immature and
that you should grow the hell up,

217
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,263
and so you need to figure out how much 
of your resentment is is is that and 

218
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,250
maybe allied with the desire to find 
other things or people to blame,

219
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,760
but the other possible option is that 
you have something to say or do,

220
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,023
right?
Because you're in a situation where 

221
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,353
you're violating your own internal 
ethical standards and you're being 

222
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,853
required pressure,
let's say to say things you don't 

223
00:14:17,021 --> 00:14:22,021
believe or to do things that you believe
to be wrong and you need to determine.

224
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:27,490
You need to start to strategize and plan
how you can rectify that so that you can

225
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,324
say what you mean.
Like if you're negotiating with a 

226
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:31,000
marital partner,
for example,

227
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:35,560
and there are issues in your marriage 
that aren't making you happy.

228
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,690
Well,
the first thing is you have to take note

229
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:38,291
of that,
right?

230
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:40,720
To see that you're actually unhappy.
Uh,

231
00:14:40,721 --> 00:14:44,140
the second is that you have to be 
willing to engage in a certain amount of

232
00:14:44,141 --> 00:14:47,720
conflict because in order to sort out 
what's disturbing you,

233
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,710
you're going to have to lay your 
concerns out on the table and say,

234
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:53,060
well look,
this is bothering me.

235
00:14:53,061 --> 00:14:54,050
You don't have to say,
well,

236
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:57,290
I'm right and you're wrong and you have 
to fix this.

237
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:58,250
You have to say,
well,

238
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,173
I've noticed that this
pattern of interaction or lack of 

239
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:08,861
interaction say in our relationship is 
making me resentful and angry,

240
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:10,034
and the danger of that of course,
is you're going to take it out on 

241
00:15:11,781 --> 00:15:14,520
yourself and your partner,
the Dangerous Passion,

242
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,010
passive aggressiveness.

243
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,223
You know,
you're not going to respond to your 

244
00:15:17,661 --> 00:15:20,800
partner positively when they do 
something good if you're resentful about

245
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,960
and you're not going to respond to 
yourself properly.

246
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:27,410
So you have to lay it out on the table.
But sort of in a spirit of ignorance,

247
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:28,550
humility.
It's like,

248
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:30,320
look,
I'm frustrated.

249
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:32,960
I'm feeling this way about our 
relationship.

250
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,450
Here's what I think might be going 
wrong.

251
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,433
Maybe on my part and maybe on your part 
and here's what I envisioned as a 

252
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:40,634
possible solution.
That's also really necessary if you're 

253
00:15:43,071 --> 00:15:43,904
going to say what you have to say,
which is to manifest yourself properly 

254
00:15:47,391 --> 00:15:50,810
in the world is you can't just complain 
about what's wrong.

255
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,100
You have to think,
well,

256
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:55,520
what would my minimal preconditions for 
satisfaction be?

257
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,760
You have to offer that to the person 
that you're negotiating with and so then

258
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:01,724
you learn to abide by the truth to the 
degree that you can do that and no one 

259
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,320
does it perfectly.

260
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,583
No,
but it's very useful because you're not 

261
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:12,224
storing up a whole sequence of memories 
about how you were unfairly treated and 

262
00:16:18,201 --> 00:16:20,660
abused and betrayed.
Instead,

263
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:21,494
you're trying to stay on top of it and 
to note your unhappiness and 

264
00:16:24,261 --> 00:16:25,094
dissatisfaction when it manifests itself
and to accept that that's the case and 

265
00:16:29,451 --> 00:16:32,330
then to analyze that to see if it's your
problem.

266
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,223
Like I said,
with regards to maturity or if it 

267
00:16:34,551 --> 00:16:35,384
indicates that there's an injustice in 
the manner in which you and the world 

268
00:16:40,911 --> 00:16:41,744
are interacting and then to work to set 
that right even in small ways and so 

269
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,900
it's a matter of character,
logical development,

270
00:16:47,901 --> 00:16:48,734
and that makes you.
That makes you stronger over time and 

271
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,050
partly what you need,
you know,

272
00:16:54,051 --> 00:16:56,390
in order to do that is you have to 
really understand,

273
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,224
and we do this.
This is why we built in the future 

274
00:16:59,331 --> 00:17:00,110
authoring program.

275
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:04,250
We built this section where you have to 
outline your most dismal future,

276
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:05,084
right?
What your future would be like if you 

277
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:06,824
let all your bad habits and 
characterological weaknesses have the 

278
00:17:09,381 --> 00:17:10,214
upper hand.
And the reason we did this is because 

279
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:17,780
you can't be a.
You can't straighten yourself out merely

280
00:17:17,781 --> 00:17:18,614
as a consequence of hope.
Let's say you lay out a vision for the 

281
00:17:20,781 --> 00:17:22,760
future and you think about what your 
life would be,

282
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,860
what,
what you'd like your life to be like,

283
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:25,903
and then that makes you hopeful and it 
motivates you because it gives you 

284
00:17:27,711 --> 00:17:30,860
something worthwhile and higher order to
work for.

285
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,690
Right?
And that's useful,

286
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:33,524
that's positive emotion working for you 
because positive emotion is experienced 

287
00:17:36,651 --> 00:17:37,484
in relationship to goals,
but it's not as not as useful as also 

288
00:17:40,011 --> 00:17:40,844
being chased by something you're 
terrified by and if you have a good 

289
00:17:44,001 --> 00:17:48,380
sense of how you'd fall apart,
if you stayed week and just exactly what

290
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:49,800
kind of hell that would be.

291
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,933
Then when you determined to do something
like to tell the truth and to say what 

292
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:56,940
you think and to not do things that you 
hate,

293
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,463
then you're going to be pulled along by 
the purpose that your vision has 

294
00:18:01,921 --> 00:18:02,754
provided for you,
but also pushed along by your desire to 

295
00:18:05,491 --> 00:18:06,324
avoid the worst forms of hail that 
you've already outlined for yourself 

296
00:18:08,941 --> 00:18:09,774
personally.
And that can also help you be brave 

297
00:18:11,911 --> 00:18:16,410
enough to stand up in a situation that 
we would require a conflict.

298
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:17,244
Because if you have something to say and
you have something to negotiate about 

299
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:22,554
with someone,
then there's going to be a certain 

300
00:18:23,641 --> 00:18:25,580
amount of conflict.
Jewel dialogue,

301
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,540
um,
that accompanies that right to,

302
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,473
to lay out a set of problems and to 
describe the fact forthrightly that 

303
00:18:34,741 --> 00:18:36,720
those problems characterize a 
relationship.

304
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:37,554
And then to seek for solutions is quite 
stressful in the short term and it's 

305
00:18:41,671 --> 00:18:45,210
really easy to avoid and so people 
avoided all the time and then they store

306
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:46,044
up grievances across the span of the 
relationships and eventually the 

307
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:50,934
grievances mount to the point where they
return in monstrous forum and just eat 

308
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:55,374
everything up.

309
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:59,130
That's where you get divorces or that's 
where you explode at your boss and ended

310
00:18:59,131 --> 00:18:59,964
up fired or that's where you know you 
develop high blood pressure over 15 

311
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:08,170
years because he can't stand all the 
accumulated a monster,

312
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,503
all the accumulated monsters in your 
closet and then you drink yourself into 

313
00:19:12,781 --> 00:19:14,820
oblivion because he can't stand to your 
life.

314
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,180
That's all you know.
Very counterproductive,

315
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,283
but it's easy to avoid that necessary 
conflict on a moment to moment basis 

316
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:27,861
because it's very stressful to speak 
forthrightly about genuine conflicts,

317
00:19:28,141 --> 00:19:30,630
especially when you're dealing with 
important parts of your life.

318
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:31,883
But otherwise you don't straighten them 
out and then you have to carry all that 

319
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:34,824
forward.
So you need to be terrified of the 

320
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:37,194
consequences of not speaking your piece.
And that can counterbalance the terror 

321
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:46,320
of actually trying to have a 
conversation so well,

322
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,583
you know,
and you also have to look with regards 

323
00:19:48,751 --> 00:19:53,751
to the shadow ideas like you have to get
in touch with the depths of your anger.

324
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:55,883
You know,
lots of people are resentful about all 

325
00:19:57,391 --> 00:19:58,224
sorts of things.
They're resentful about old women and 

326
00:20:01,261 --> 00:20:02,094
they're resentful about men and they're 
resentful about the patriarchy and 

327
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,273
they're resentful about the left wing 
and resentful about the right wing and 

328
00:20:08,161 --> 00:20:11,740
the resentful about politicians and 
they're resentful about the,

329
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:16,770
like the cataclysmic force of nature and
its ability to make people sick and,

330
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:18,523
and suffer.
And they are resentful about their own 

331
00:20:20,881 --> 00:20:21,714
inadequacies in the boat.
They're bad parenting and God like the 

332
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,800
list is just bloody endless.
And that can make you very,

333
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:29,634
very angry.
And that's part of that resentment and 

334
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:32,514
cynical and bitter and dark and full of 
fantasies about destruction and the 

335
00:20:36,421 --> 00:20:39,900
desire to bring things down and the wish
that everyone else suffered.

336
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:42,450
And the desire to shake your fist at 
God.

337
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:45,480
And all of that's really dark.
You know,

338
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,710
young said,
well,

339
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,573
the shadow human shout,
it extends all the way down to hell and 

340
00:20:50,171 --> 00:20:52,180
he really meant that,
you know,

341
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,253
because all the terrible things that 
people are motivated to do are 

342
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:02,500
associated with that shadow domain and 
like none of you are any,

343
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,590
none of you are saints in any 
likelihood.

344
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,870
You have a terrible capacity for 
destructiveness.

345
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:11,680
And when you start to consult your 
resentment and to see how angry you are,

346
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,410
it can terrify you to see the depths of 
that anger.

347
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:17,620
Sometimes that'll manifest itself in 
very destructive fantasies.

348
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:18,590
You know,
um,

349
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:22,600
which you might not want to become 
conscious of because they're so.

350
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,150
I'm brutal,
let's say.

351
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:25,984
And so aggressive that you can't even 
believe that you generate them the nice 

352
00:21:28,901 --> 00:21:30,820
person that's you.
It's like,

353
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:34,030
so it's quite frightening to open the 
door and see all that.

354
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:39,031
And that also associates you with the 
entire dark shadow of mankind,

355
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,150
right?
The sate,

356
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:40,984
tannic element of the human character.
And but it opens the door to 

357
00:21:44,351 --> 00:21:45,860
understanding as well,
to,

358
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,023
to understanding how people can do 
terrible things because you could see 

359
00:21:49,271 --> 00:21:51,970
yourself as one of the people who could 
do terrible things.

360
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,630
That's really useful,
you know,

361
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:54,993
because then you.

362
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,103
Well then maybe you start to be 
motivated to be the sort of person who 

363
00:21:58,871 --> 00:22:00,790
wouldn't do terrible things.
You know,

364
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:04,390
if you can really come to terms with the
fact that that's part and parcel of you.

365
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,433
It also is some in perverse sense.
It's also a discovery of your own 

366
00:22:08,951 --> 00:22:10,510
strength though,
because you know,

367
00:22:10,511 --> 00:22:15,390
if you have that desire for aggression,
that desire for destruction and that,

368
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,273
that,
that ability to fantasize in that 

369
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,203
aggressive manner,
it also means that you can incorporate 

370
00:22:21,191 --> 00:22:22,024
some of that into your speech and into 
your actions so that you're a lot more 

371
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,850
immovable,
right?

372
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:28,743
And,
and a lot more of a force to contend 

373
00:22:31,931 --> 00:22:32,764
with.
It can give you some respect for 

374
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:34,924
yourself when you realize that you're a 
force of destruction as well as 

375
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:38,464
creation.
And then you're also more likely to 

376
00:22:39,701 --> 00:22:42,700
treat yourself with a bit more 
intelligent caution.

377
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,213
You know,
to know that you're a part of you is a 

378
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:50,240
ticking bomb in some sense that could go
off and so you,

379
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,203
you,
you try a bit more lightly around 

380
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:53,254
yourself and had maybe you encourage 
people to tread more lightly around you 

381
00:22:56,801 --> 00:22:59,200
as well,
which isn't such a bad thing and all the

382
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:00,034
people that I really admire that I know 
have a clearly dangerous side and you 

383
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:05,074
don't want to get,
you don't want to have that activated 

384
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:09,574
any more than necessary,
but it's also what makes them 

385
00:23:11,411 --> 00:23:12,244
respectable and strong,
especially if they have that under 

386
00:23:14,111 --> 00:23:15,760
control.
So,

387
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,433
oh,
that's a bit of a dialogue about shadow 

388
00:23:18,671 --> 00:23:20,380
integration.
It's a very

389
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,850
challenging undertaking,
you know,

390
00:23:24,851 --> 00:23:25,684
to pull in that dark side of your 
character and that would be all the 

391
00:23:30,431 --> 00:23:35,420
things that you've repressed or failed 
to develop as a consequence of trying to

392
00:23:35,421 --> 00:23:37,280
be a harmless.
And

393
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:38,803
uh,

394
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,910
well let's say a harmless and

395
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,980
harmless citizen who looks virtuous.
The surface,

396
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,023
that's the union persona.
And you need that because everybody 

397
00:23:50,091 --> 00:23:53,270
needs a mask that they wear in public,
like a suit,

398
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:54,283
you know,
so that we can tolerate seeing each 

399
00:23:57,171 --> 00:23:58,004
other on the street.
We don't have to look right into our 

400
00:23:59,751 --> 00:24:02,870
depths every time we interact,
we need that persona.

401
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:03,704
But that has to be transcended.
And the way to transcend that is to 

402
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,360
integrate the darker parts of the 
character.

403
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,310
They're very useful.
That aggression,

404
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,560
that sexual demand,
for example,

405
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,400
all of that very difficult to socialize 
that competitiveness,

406
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:23,300
but unbelievably useful in terms of 
force of character,

407
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,560
if you can manage it.

408
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:29,743
Richard asked,
how can I help my parents to sort 

409
00:24:31,491 --> 00:24:34,410
themselves out?
That's question one.

410
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:38,340
How can I talk about the resentments of 
my childhood in a way that benefits them

411
00:24:38,341 --> 00:24:40,850
instead of giving them guilt?
Yeah.

412
00:24:40,851 --> 00:24:42,980
Well,
those are two very difficult questions.

413
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,310
How can you help your parents to sort 
themselves out?

414
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,860
Well,
I guess the first question would be,

415
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,553
do they want to sort themselves out 
because it's not that easy to help 

416
00:24:55,641 --> 00:25:00,320
people if they don't want to be helped.
If they do want to be helped.

417
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:03,530
Like listening is really a good 
strategy.

418
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,930
Um,
you know,

419
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,690
people,
you got the question right,

420
00:25:08,691 --> 00:25:09,524
because you said,
how can I help my parents to sort 

421
00:25:11,211 --> 00:25:12,044
themselves out,
which is very different than how can I 

422
00:25:13,491 --> 00:25:14,324
sort my parents out.
You help people to sort themselves out 

423
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:19,973
once they have decided to do so by 
giving them the opportunity to talk 

424
00:25:24,871 --> 00:25:25,704
about their concerns and also to outline
what potential solutions might be and 

425
00:25:30,091 --> 00:25:30,924
you don't want to offer too many pieces 
of advice while you're doing that 

426
00:25:34,441 --> 00:25:39,441
because it turns out that people are 
much more likely to implement a strategy

427
00:25:39,721 --> 00:25:42,300
of improvement if they generate it 
themselves.

428
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:45,120
And then also you don't steal the 
accomplishment from them.

429
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:48,150
Like let's say you came to me with a 
bunch of problems and I said,

430
00:25:48,151 --> 00:25:50,340
well,
here's what you can do about that.

431
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,890
And then you went out and did it and it 
worked.

432
00:25:54,891 --> 00:25:57,380
And then in some sense that's not your 
accomplishment.

433
00:25:57,381 --> 00:25:59,500
I mean it is in so far as you 
implemented,

434
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:03,380
but it's not in so far as it was 
something that I planned.

435
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:07,820
And your intimation of that,
your integration of the fact that the

436
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,193
delight in success in the responsibility
for six success might have been stolen 

437
00:26:14,821 --> 00:26:15,654
from you by well meaning advice is going
to interfere with the probability that 

438
00:26:20,281 --> 00:26:21,114
you'll implement the solution.
And so it's best to let people talk 

439
00:26:25,691 --> 00:26:27,310
through their own problems like,
well,

440
00:26:27,311 --> 00:26:29,860
what's the problem?
What you asked,

441
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:30,823
what's the problem?
What do you think is not right about 

442
00:26:31,971 --> 00:26:32,804
your life?
And then people will throw out a bunch 

443
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:38,270
of things that they're complaining about
or resentful about and it might be quite

444
00:26:38,271 --> 00:26:39,104
an extensive list and they'll feel 
guilty about it because they don't want 

445
00:26:41,031 --> 00:26:44,220
to burden you with it,
but they need to it all off their chest,

446
00:26:44,221 --> 00:26:45,960
right?
They need to get the cards on the table.

447
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:46,883
It's also something to know when you're 
talking to your wife or your husband or 

448
00:26:49,201 --> 00:26:51,690
your intimate partner or child for that 
matter.

449
00:26:51,691 --> 00:26:53,520
So when you have a close relationship 
with this,

450
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,800
if they've got some things to complain 
about,

451
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,753
which they undoubtedly do,
they're going to complain about a lot 

452
00:26:59,671 --> 00:27:00,504
more things than they're actually upset 
about because they'll have gathered up 

453
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,913
irritations that have been unspoken and 
aggravations and fears and they'll all 

454
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:11,094
be upsetting them emotionally and they 
don't know exactly what they are until 

455
00:27:15,331 --> 00:27:16,960
they articulate that,
you know,

456
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:17,611
we say,
well,

457
00:27:17,611 --> 00:27:18,690
what are you upset about?

458
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,830
Well,
I don't know.

459
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,300
Well,
how can you not know?

460
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,433
Well,
the answer is there's all sorts of 

461
00:27:23,221 --> 00:27:26,430
things that you respond to emotionally 
before you can articulate them.

462
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:27,563
Then you get upset and you explode and 
you yell and you lay out all the things 

463
00:27:30,271 --> 00:27:31,104
you might be angry about and you're 
impulsive and you overstate your case 

464
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:36,630
and you accused people of things that 
you don't even believe.

465
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,950
All of that's part of the process of 
laying your cards out on the table.

466
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:42,443
You have complex situations that are 
disturbing you and you don't know what 

467
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:47,790
they are.
And exactly you have to kind of guess.

468
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,541
So you say,
well,

469
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,430
it might be this and it might be that,
and it might be this,

470
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,130
it might be you,
and this is why it's your fault.

471
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,530
You get accused and then if you're 
listening to all that,

472
00:27:58,650 --> 00:27:59,483
you have to just be patient and let the 
person get all their cards out on the 

473
00:28:04,231 --> 00:28:04,560
table.

474
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,530
Even if some of that involves 
accusations about you,

475
00:28:07,531 --> 00:28:08,364
which you don't have to immediately.
You don't have to immediately jumped to 

476
00:28:10,471 --> 00:28:11,304
the conclusion that those accusations 
are accurate to that you have to defend 

477
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:15,450
yourself.
You know,

478
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:16,860
I'm not,
believe me,

479
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,810
I'm not saying this is easy because it's
not,

480
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,913
but you listen to the person lay out 
their their deck of complaints and the 

481
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:24,324
first thing you'll find is that they 
will take 50 percent or maybe more 75 

482
00:28:28,621 --> 00:28:31,500
percent of the cards off the table right
away.

483
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:34,710
Because once they've articulated out 
those concerns,

484
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,470
they'll find that they're not really 
central.

485
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,333
They're not really the issue.
And so that leaves a smaller number of 

486
00:28:41,101 --> 00:28:45,360
genuine problems.
And then you can ask people again,

487
00:28:45,361 --> 00:28:46,890
well,
here's the problem.

488
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,053
Can you think of any way?
If you could conceptualize how things 

489
00:28:51,631 --> 00:28:54,270
would be better in relationship to that 
problem,

490
00:28:54,271 --> 00:28:55,104
well,
what would a solution look like even in 

491
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,760
principle and then they might say,
well,

492
00:28:59,761 --> 00:29:00,594
I don't know,
and then they have to guess and lay 

493
00:29:01,831 --> 00:29:02,664
their cards out on the table about what 
a solution might look like if they say 

494
00:29:05,791 --> 00:29:06,624
they don't know that often means they 
don't want to think about it and a 

495
00:29:09,691 --> 00:29:10,524
little bit of encouragement isn't in 
order and maybe a little bit of 

496
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,350
pressure,
um,

497
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,893
but you want people to formulate a 
vision of what the situation would look 

498
00:29:18,361 --> 00:29:20,010
like if the problem was solved.

499
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,083
And then they might find it very 
daunting because the solution looks so 

500
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,740
difficult that they don't see any 
pathway to it.

501
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,470
And so then the next part of the 
discussion is,

502
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,393
well,
are there some things that you could do 

503
00:29:31,321 --> 00:29:32,154
that would be small steps that you would
be interested in doing that you think 

504
00:29:35,671 --> 00:29:39,180
you would do that would move you to the 
solution?

505
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,380
And maybe those things could be 
implemented.

506
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:45,970
Tentatively behavioral psychologists 
call that collaborative empiricism.

507
00:29:45,971 --> 00:29:46,804
So you'll come and see a behavioral 
psychologist and lay out your problems 

508
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,510
and then the two of you will negotiate 
towards,

509
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,250
uh,
the beginnings of a solution.

510
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,990
What could you do this week that might 
make that problem slightly better?

511
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:03,910
And so you talked through what's 
practical and what's implementable,

512
00:30:03,911 --> 00:30:04,744
and you have to be honest about that 
because you don't want to set yourself 

513
00:30:07,571 --> 00:30:09,430
up with a plan that's so complicated.

514
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,860
You won't implement it.
Then you say to the person,

515
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,210
if you're the psychologist,
you say,

516
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:14,044
well look,
we've got a couple of ideas about what 

517
00:30:15,551 --> 00:30:18,910
you could do this week that might make 
this situation slightly better.

518
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,893
Why don't you go and implement them and 
then come back next week and we'll talk 

519
00:30:22,511 --> 00:30:23,344
about whether or not that worked and 
work would be you did implement it and 

520
00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:30,220
that it did have the desired solution.
And if it didn't work,

521
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:33,790
meaning you didn't implement it or the 
solution didn't emerge,

522
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,833
then there's,
there's the opportunity for 

523
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:40,150
renegotiation.
So you can think about it strategically.

524
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:44,470
The first issue is if something needs to
be sorted out,

525
00:30:44,471 --> 00:30:46,990
the first question is what the Hell's 
the problem?

526
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:50,380
And the answer to that is you probably 
don't know.

527
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,303
The problem is I'm upset and disturbed 
and angry and resentful and bitter and 

528
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:57,760
unhappy and anxious and in pain and 
lonesome,

529
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,773
I'm suffering from an excess of negative
emotion and perhaps from a certain 

530
00:31:01,931 --> 00:31:02,920
amount of hopelessness.

531
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:03,903
So the problem is the emotional 
circumstance and that might be 

532
00:31:06,761 --> 00:31:09,100
associated with some real problems,
right?

533
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:12,850
Some real practical problems.
So you lay all that out and say,

534
00:31:12,851 --> 00:31:13,684
okay,
well what is the problem landscape look 

535
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:16,660
like?
Right?

536
00:31:16,661 --> 00:31:18,940
So that's the strategic move.
And then,

537
00:31:18,941 --> 00:31:21,550
as I said,
that will generally simplify the problem

538
00:31:21,551 --> 00:31:24,490
landscape.
Then you do the same thing with a set of

539
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:26,380
potential solutions.
Well,

540
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,633
what would the solutions look like 
because you're not gonna be able to 

541
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:33,310
solve a problem unless you at least know
what a solution might look like.

542
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:34,840
That would actually,
um,

543
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:38,770
what would you say that would,
that you would find acceptable?

544
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:39,783
And then the next issue is to lay out 
the strategies for the attainment of 

545
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,500
that solution.
And you know,

546
00:31:44,501 --> 00:31:48,250
sometimes it might be,
some of these solutions might be dismal.

547
00:31:48,251 --> 00:31:49,084
Like,
you know,

548
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:53,020
if you've got someone who's ill in your 
family to solution might be,

549
00:31:53,021 --> 00:31:55,960
well,
well we need a cure.

550
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,093
You know,
that's the only solution that will 

551
00:31:58,091 --> 00:31:58,924
suffice,
but you don't know how to pursue the 

552
00:32:01,451 --> 00:32:04,750
cure or maybe one doesn't exist.
So then you have to think of,

553
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,913
well,
a lower order and less satisfying 

554
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,600
solution,
which would be,

555
00:32:10,601 --> 00:32:11,434
well maybe we can cope.
We're going to learn to cope with this 

556
00:32:13,991 --> 00:32:16,600
so that it's the least amount of hell 
possible.

557
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,913
And,
and maybe that maybe that even that's 

558
00:32:19,991 --> 00:32:21,550
too much.
You might have to say,

559
00:32:21,551 --> 00:32:22,384
well,
we're going to try to make this next 

560
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,040
week when we're coping with this better 
than the last week.

561
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,620
You know?
And,

562
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:32,680
and maybe you can't even do that.
It has to just be the next day.

563
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,083
You look for whatever small steps 
forward you can take that will make 

564
00:32:36,701 --> 00:32:39,920
things less wretched and horrible than 
they currently are.

565
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,200
You know,
to put it rather bluntly.

566
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,650
And that requires the willingness to 
face the problem,

567
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,310
the humility to know that you don't have
the solution at hand.

568
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,473
The willingness to listen to how the 
other people that you're talking to 

569
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:57,020
formulate the problems and formulate the
solutions.

570
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,430
It's crucially important,
right?

571
00:32:58,431 --> 00:33:01,790
To have them do that work themselves.
It's also,

572
00:33:01,791 --> 00:33:05,840
you could think about it this way too,
is that if you listen to someone come up

573
00:33:05,841 --> 00:33:06,674
with a solution,
you don't undergo with the neurological 

574
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:13,850
transformation necessary to change your 
character,

575
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:16,630
but if you come up with the solutions 
yourself,

576
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,380
you know if you articulate the problem 
and you articulate the solutions,

577
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,463
then you've changed your own character 
in a way that increases the probability 

578
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:25,843
that you're going to act out what you do
and that requires real patients to to 

579
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:32,260
let people stumble through to their own 
problems.

580
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:35,540
Solutions because someone might lay out 
a set of problems and you think,

581
00:33:35,541 --> 00:33:37,610
oh my God,
I know what you could do about that,

582
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,310
but it doesn't really matter if you 
know.

583
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:41,923
You know,
and I'm also not saying that sometimes 

584
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,830
advice is helpful.
You know,

585
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,230
sometimes you can give someone a hint,
but man,

586
00:33:48,231 --> 00:33:49,064
you have to be careful with that because
there's a real element of theft that's 

587
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:54,950
associated with it.
Now Richard also asked,

588
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:58,850
how can I talk about the resentments of 
my childhood in a way that benefits them

589
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,470
instead of giving them guilt?

590
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,470
I don't know if I can answer that 
question,

591
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:10,650
Richard,
because it's not a question.

592
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,113
That's what I would ask.
If you came to talk to me and you had 

593
00:34:15,821 --> 00:34:17,800
that question,
I would say first of all,

594
00:34:17,801 --> 00:34:22,540
well what resentments?
List them out,

595
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:24,250
man.
Write him down.

596
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,580
Okay,
so that you know what they are.

597
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:29,950
Because all of those,
each of those resentments is going to be

598
00:34:29,951 --> 00:34:30,784
a different thing and the strategy 
that's associated with each might vary 

599
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:37,750
as a consequence of the particularity of
the resentment.

600
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,750
So I would say you should start by 
writing them down like,

601
00:34:40,751 --> 00:34:41,584
what's your problem exactly here?
Here's all the things that I can think 

602
00:34:44,441 --> 00:34:46,900
of that I'm angry about with regard to 
my childhood.

603
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:52,110
Write that down and then see which ones 
are are still living,

604
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,810
and then you have to figure out,
well,

605
00:34:55,811 --> 00:34:57,520
what do you want from your parents?

606
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,570
Exactly.
Do you.

607
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,620
Do you want them to apologize?
Do you want them to understand what they

608
00:35:02,621 --> 00:35:04,780
did wrong?
Do you want to punish them?

609
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,810
Do you want to get?
Let them get you.

610
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:08,973
Let them learn to know you better.
Do you want to change the way they're 

611
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:14,944
interacting with you now?
Do you want to learn your own lessons 

612
00:35:18,401 --> 00:35:21,160
from your bad experience so that when 
you're a parent,

613
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:21,994
you don't make the same mistake.
You merely want to have a chance to 

614
00:35:24,911 --> 00:35:27,730
express yourself like it's very 
difficult to.

615
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,000
To answer your question because I don't 
know what your goal is,

616
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,373
right?
So we bought an and I don't need to 

617
00:35:33,491 --> 00:35:34,324
know.
You need to know what are the 

618
00:35:35,561 --> 00:35:36,394
resentments so we can walk the process 
we already described laid them out and 

619
00:35:39,961 --> 00:35:40,794
comprehensively you might want to make a
list of everything that you think you 

620
00:35:44,671 --> 00:35:47,970
might conceivably be annoyed about with 
regards to your parents.

621
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:50,130
No matter how trivial,
right?

622
00:35:50,131 --> 00:35:54,440
Because that way you you scour your 
memory for,

623
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:55,500
for,
for,

624
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:59,700
for,
for things that you're holding onto in a

625
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,940
bitter way and maybe you have your 
justification.

626
00:36:02,941 --> 00:36:03,774
I'm not suggesting that you don't,
but you need to discover what baggage 

627
00:36:07,171 --> 00:36:08,400
you're carrying.
Then you have to figure out,

628
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:10,740
well,
what can I let go of and what's core,

629
00:36:10,741 --> 00:36:11,574
and I would say what's really core is
if there are ways that your parents 

630
00:36:16,861 --> 00:36:20,850
treated you that are still affecting you
or that are affecting your relationships

631
00:36:20,851 --> 00:36:21,684
with them now,
those really need to be dealt with 

632
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:26,460
because they're not done.
They're not in the past.

633
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,770
They're not even resentments of your 
childhood.

634
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:31,890
They're still part of your ongoing life 
and so,

635
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:34,883
okay,
so now you have all your resentments 

636
00:36:35,911 --> 00:36:37,830
laid out.
I guess I would say,

637
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,300
you know,
something like,

638
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,260
look,
mom and dad,

639
00:36:40,261 --> 00:36:41,094
there's something I need to talk to you 
about that's been bothering me for a 

640
00:36:43,351 --> 00:36:44,184
long time,
and I picked one of the more trivial 

641
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:47,090
things to begin with.
It's like,

642
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:47,963
here's a memory I have and don't get all
high and mighty about it because you 

643
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:52,074
know,
you might have misconstrued the 

644
00:36:52,831 --> 00:36:53,664
situation as a child.
It's highly probable and they may have 

645
00:36:56,011 --> 00:36:59,130
had their reasons and you may not even 
remember the situation,

646
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,580
let's say correctly or the way they 
remembered saying,

647
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:02,760
well,
here's,

648
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,890
here's something that happened when I 
was a kid in it.

649
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,860
It still bothers me in,
do you remember what happened?

650
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:10,500
That's an open ended question.
Do you remember what happened?

651
00:37:10,501 --> 00:37:12,870
Why did this,
where did this go this way?

652
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,090
And then I will do an awful lot of 
listening,

653
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,253
you know,
because you are trying to gather 

654
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:18,444
information and the more your parents 
can tell you about what happened in 

655
00:37:21,211 --> 00:37:24,360
those situations,
I would say the better off you're likely

656
00:37:24,361 --> 00:37:25,194
to be.

657
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:29,130
So that's about all I can say about 
that.

658
00:37:29,131 --> 00:37:29,964
That's fairly delineated approach to 
general discussions about difficult 

659
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:34,111
things,
right?

660
00:37:34,111 --> 00:37:39,111
But I would say don't be afraid of,
don't be more afraid of engaging in this

661
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:40,734
process.
Then you are afraid of not engaging in 

662
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:43,794
it.
Like every relationship you have is 

663
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:47,580
going to have problems in it.
And you know,

664
00:37:47,581 --> 00:37:48,414
you don't want to jump to a intense 
psychological discussion with every 

665
00:37:52,681 --> 00:37:55,490
little bump.
But if,

666
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,900
if there's something,
um,

667
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:00,330
medium to longterm permanence that's 
disturbing you,

668
00:38:00,331 --> 00:38:04,260
or a pattern that repeats itself at 
least three times,

669
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,630
let's say,
well then that might be something that's

670
00:38:06,631 --> 00:38:07,464
worthy of discussion or your discovery 
that you're very dissatisfied with the 

671
00:38:11,071 --> 00:38:11,904
way the relationship is going and you 
have to have the conflict necessary to 

672
00:38:15,721 --> 00:38:19,500
sort that out and it's going to be 
conflict with you and the client and the

673
00:38:19,501 --> 00:38:20,334
person that you're talking to.
But the aim should be the establishment 

674
00:38:23,071 --> 00:38:23,904
of something like fully informed,
fully negotiated medium to longterm 

675
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,650
piece.
That's what you're aiming at.

676
00:38:31,651 --> 00:38:32,820
If you have any sense.

677
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,080
Oh,
cody said it took me seven months,

678
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:54,170
but I completed all the self authoring 
suit in July.

679
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:58,100
I'm still not motivated to do anything 
and waste all of my time.

680
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:00,420
What do I do?
Well?

681
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,850
Well,
the first question is,

682
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,060
is it true that you're not motivated to 
do anything?

683
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,030
And is it true that you waste all of 
your time?

684
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:15,560
It seems highly unlikely to me that both
of those things are 100 percent true.

685
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:19,870
So one of the things you might notice is
are there anything,

686
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,170
is there anything that you're motivated 
to do,

687
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:24,490
presume you're motivated to eat or the 
perhaps not,

688
00:39:24,491 --> 00:39:29,491
and I'm not being smart about this.
Partly what I would say is two things.

689
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,863
He might need some smaller goals.
Like you have to shrink your goals to 

690
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:42,211
the point where you've established a 
plan forward that consists of steps that

691
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:46,450
not only you would be willing to take 
but that you would take.

692
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,940
And so some of that is humility.
It's like,

693
00:39:48,941 --> 00:39:49,751
man,
I'm stuck.

694
00:39:49,751 --> 00:39:52,060
I can barely do anything and it's okay,
well I'm,

695
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:54,460
I'm laying in bed for seven hours a day.
Well,

696
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:58,900
could I lay in bed for six hours,
six and a half hours tomorrow,

697
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,060
you know,
or while I'm in bed,

698
00:40:01,061 --> 00:40:04,480
could I do something somewhat useful?
Could I read a book?

699
00:40:04,481 --> 00:40:07,540
Can I read one page of a book?
Can I read a paragraph of a book?

700
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:12,010
You have to find that those steps 
forward that you wouldn't take.

701
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,353
I really think it's useful to make 
friends with something like a Google 

702
00:40:17,051 --> 00:40:18,670
calendar,
you know,

703
00:40:18,671 --> 00:40:19,504
or whatever calendar program you might 
want to use and start designing days 

704
00:40:23,471 --> 00:40:24,304
that you would like to have because 
that's the right way to use a calendar 

705
00:40:26,681 --> 00:40:28,660
and everyone out there that's listening.
You should.

706
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:29,913
You should use a calendar to structure 
your days because if you know what 

707
00:40:33,461 --> 00:40:34,294
you're doing tomorrow,
it decreases your anxiety substantially 

708
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,650
because you need that kind of structure.

709
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,740
You need a pathway,
you need to know,

710
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,520
you need to have a map and you need to 
know where you're located on the map and

711
00:40:45,521 --> 00:40:46,354
you need to know how you're moving 
forward and that gives you hope because 

712
00:40:49,211 --> 00:40:50,044
you're moving towards goals that you 
regard as worthwhile and it stops you 

713
00:40:54,071 --> 00:40:54,904
from being anxious because you're not 
entirely directionless and lost and so 

714
00:40:58,421 --> 00:40:59,254
learning how to manage your time is 
useful and you can start with a 

715
00:41:02,201 --> 00:41:03,034
calender.
You can start with simple things like 

716
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,133
you can put in well when you're likely 
to go to bed and when you're likely to 

717
00:41:08,411 --> 00:41:11,140
get up and and regulating.
That's useful.

718
00:41:11,141 --> 00:41:14,650
That should be relatively 
ritualistically consistent.

719
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:16,143
It's very difficult to get your life in 
order if your sleep wake schedule is 

720
00:41:18,671 --> 00:41:19,504
completely a random or if it's not 
aligned with like day and night and if 

721
00:41:26,621 --> 00:41:30,070
it's not aligned with the normative 
practices of other people.

722
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,830
And so you may have to learn to get your
sleep,

723
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:33,703
wake cycle regulated properly,
and then the same with your eating 

724
00:41:36,321 --> 00:41:37,154
schedule.
Those are very basic things and you can 

725
00:41:39,261 --> 00:41:40,094
do that badly,
but that's what you want to approximate 

726
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,520
three meals a day,
let's say,

727
00:41:43,521 --> 00:41:45,680
because that's what people do 
normatively.

728
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:50,740
And um,
and then you have to add small goals.

729
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,730
Now,
if that doesn't work,

730
00:41:53,731 --> 00:41:56,930
like if you can't make the goals small 
enough to achieve,

731
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,210
you know,
it might be that you're not being humble

732
00:41:59,211 --> 00:42:02,240
enough with regards to your conceptions 
of your own ability.

733
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,373
But you can tell if the goal that you 
put forward is a reasonable one if 

734
00:42:07,551 --> 00:42:09,920
you're actually implementing it.
Because if you're not,

735
00:42:09,921 --> 00:42:12,230
then by definition it's not a reasonable
goal.

736
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,940
You know,
like let's say you're,

737
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:18,080
you're sleeping all the time in your 
room is just a bloody complete disaster,

738
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,221
you know,
and you think,

739
00:42:19,221 --> 00:42:20,510
well I should clean up my room.

740
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,860
It's like,
well maybe you can't,

741
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:24,830
but maybe tomorrow you could hang up two
shirts,

742
00:42:24,831 --> 00:42:27,320
you know,
or you could or you could move to shirts

743
00:42:27,321 --> 00:42:28,154
from your bedroom to the laundry room or
you could bag up a bag of dirty clothes 

744
00:42:32,031 --> 00:42:36,260
that you could conceivably take to a 
laundromat and just do that one thing.

745
00:42:36,261 --> 00:42:38,150
You know,
if you do,

746
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,073
if the rooms that catastrophe and you do
that one thing and then you did one 

747
00:42:42,321 --> 00:42:47,321
thing like that for 15 days or 20 days,
maybe your place would be an order.

748
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,700
And so the trick is to get the 
trajectory right.

749
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:52,130
And Cody,
if you,

750
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:53,203
if that doesn't work,
then you're going to need to talk to 

751
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,610
somebody.
You know,

752
00:42:55,611 --> 00:42:58,430
maybe you need a partner that,
that,

753
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,960
that you can discuss these things with 
where you both have a commitment,

754
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,960
like a mutual commitment to attaining a 
certain set of goals.

755
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,340
You know?
And that can be a friend.

756
00:43:07,341 --> 00:43:09,410
It could be somebody that you find 
online,

757
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,110
it could be,
and it could be a professional,

758
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:15,560
but if you find that you yourself 
cannot,

759
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,453
you just can't get this going,
then you're going to have to reach out 

760
00:43:18,561 --> 00:43:22,250
to someone else to give you a hand.
Maybe you need to sit down with a parent

761
00:43:22,610 --> 00:43:23,443
or a friend or somebody that you love 
and go over the self authoring suite 

762
00:43:29,031 --> 00:43:29,864
with them to go over the future 
authoring plans and to discuss how that 

763
00:43:32,931 --> 00:43:34,910
might be implemented.
You know,

764
00:43:34,911 --> 00:43:39,050
because if you can't do it on your own 
then and maybe you shouldn't have to,

765
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:44,290
then you have to reach out to other 
people and so make your goals smaller.

766
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:48,980
See if you can make friends with a 
schedule or a calendar.

767
00:43:48,981 --> 00:43:49,814
This is really important.
All of you out there who aren't doing 

768
00:43:51,351 --> 00:43:52,184
this,
like I would say all of the people that 

769
00:43:54,741 --> 00:43:55,574
I know who have become successful in any
way use a structured means to organize 

770
00:44:02,571 --> 00:44:03,404
their time.

771
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:07,370
They have lists of things to do like 
they have every day.

772
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,233
There's a list of things to do that day.
Every week there's a list of things to 

773
00:44:11,961 --> 00:44:12,794
do that week,
every month there's a list of things to 

774
00:44:15,261 --> 00:44:17,270
do that month,
you know,

775
00:44:17,271 --> 00:44:18,104
at every level of temporal resolution 
there's a sequence of plans and those 

776
00:44:22,641 --> 00:44:25,250
plans are implemented on a day to day 
basis.

777
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:26,293
You cannot be an successful isn't the 
right way of thinking about it because 

778
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:32,820
I'm not thinking about,
you know,

779
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,910
I'm not really thinking about rising up 
the corporate ladder.

780
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:38,700
You know what I mean?
And that's sort of what success has come

781
00:44:38,701 --> 00:44:41,460
to mean in our culture that isn't what I
mean.

782
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:47,150
You can have a life that you're going to
find acceptable without that because you

783
00:44:48,901 --> 00:44:53,901
need the vision and the plans to give 
you purpose and direction.

784
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,460
That's where all your positive emotion 
comes from.

785
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,293
All your motivation is laying out plans 
that are worth attaining and then 

786
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:02,723
observing yourself moving towards them.
That's the source of most positive 

787
00:45:06,631 --> 00:45:09,870
meaning.
And then also without that structure,

788
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,320
you're so lost that you're going to be 
anxious and overwhelmed.

789
00:45:13,321 --> 00:45:14,154
It's really like being in a foreign 
country like isolated and alone with no 

790
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:20,460
map.
I don't know where the hell I am.

791
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:24,260
I don't know what the hell I'm doing,
you know the rains are going to come,

792
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,113
the storms are going to come and maybe 
it's winter and I don't know where I am 

793
00:45:28,501 --> 00:45:31,080
or where I'm going.
And then the last thing,

794
00:45:31,081 --> 00:45:34,050
cody is like rely on some other people.
Man,

795
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,310
you know,
maybe you'll be able to return the favor

796
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,393
in the future.
I know you'll feel bad maybe that you 

797
00:45:39,421 --> 00:45:40,254
have to go to someone else.
You'll feel weak and you know that 

798
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:45,300
you're taking advantage of them,
but people like to be helpful.

799
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:46,133
They really do.
And and so it's a mark of trust in 

800
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:54,630
someone and confidence in them that you 
would ask to have a serious conversation

801
00:45:54,631 --> 00:45:58,740
with them and so and if you don't have 
someone like that,

802
00:45:58,741 --> 00:45:59,574
then you need to find somebody like that
and maybe that means you'll have to 

803
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,210
interact more in online communities or 
maybe you have to get the hell out there

804
00:46:06,211 --> 00:46:07,044
in the world.
There's lots of meetup groups and that 

805
00:46:08,911 --> 00:46:12,850
sort of thing online that have organized
themselves and you can go there and hide

806
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,090
in the back for awhile.
Not Talk to anybody,

807
00:46:15,091 --> 00:46:17,620
but you're going to get it.
I get the hell out there and,

808
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:18,661
and,
you know,

809
00:46:18,661 --> 00:46:22,170
make some social connections because you
cannot live alone.

810
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:23,663
We're social creatures and you need help
and maybe you'll be able to offer some 

811
00:46:26,821 --> 00:46:28,410
help at some point in the future too.

812
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,970
So.
Well,

813
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:33,000
okay,
rose says,

814
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:33,863
I'm consumed by envy.
I can hardly stand to read or watch or 

815
00:46:37,531 --> 00:46:40,020
listen to anyone more successful than 
myself.

816
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:43,800
In what directions am I aiming wrong?
Okay,

817
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:44,521
well,
look rose,

818
00:46:44,521 --> 00:46:47,460
it's pretty damn useful to figure out 
that you're consumed by envy.

819
00:46:47,461 --> 00:46:49,170
That's a good start.
You know that.

820
00:46:49,171 --> 00:46:52,770
That's a real self realization and an 
important one.

821
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:55,470
Okay?
So the first thing we might ask is,

822
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:57,010
well,
um,

823
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:59,053
it's,
it's likely reasonable for you to 

824
00:47:01,321 --> 00:47:05,820
observe that that's not optimal for you,
right?

825
00:47:05,821 --> 00:47:06,654
Because envy,
that's that resentment that I was 

826
00:47:08,431 --> 00:47:11,730
talking about earlier or even worse,
that jealousy.

827
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,000
It's like it's not a pleasant 
phenomenological state.

828
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:19,950
It's not a pleasant state of experience.
Okay,

829
00:47:19,951 --> 00:47:23,190
so look,
let's look at it this way.

830
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,620
Well,
what are you envious of?

831
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:26,701
You know,
you say,

832
00:47:26,701 --> 00:47:27,534
I can hardly stand to read or watch or 
listen to anyone more successful than 

833
00:47:30,491 --> 00:47:31,324
myself.

834
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,710
Well,
that's pretty vague,

835
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,553
rose,
and you want to tighten up your end via 

836
00:47:35,831 --> 00:47:36,664
bit.
It's like you'll find that there are 

837
00:47:38,561 --> 00:47:39,394
certain people that you're particularly 
envious of and others whose 

838
00:47:42,221 --> 00:47:44,290
accomplishments really don't,
uh,

839
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:46,210
disturb you,
let's say.

840
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:47,823
So the first thing you want to do is 
figure out which people it is that 

841
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:55,000
you're particularly envious up.
And then you want to figure out,

842
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,370
well,
what is it that you think they have?

843
00:47:57,850 --> 00:47:59,020
Now?
You know,

844
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:01,780
they probably have a lot more problems 
than you think.

845
00:48:01,781 --> 00:48:02,614
And so part of the pathology of envy is 
that you look at someone who's 

846
00:48:05,711 --> 00:48:06,544
successful and you assume that that 
success defines them across all the 

847
00:48:09,821 --> 00:48:13,360
important dimensions of their life.
And that's rarely the case.

848
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,351
And so,
you know,

849
00:48:14,351 --> 00:48:15,184
there's a naive optimism and envy and 
that's reflected in the fact that you 

850
00:48:19,541 --> 00:48:23,770
think that the person you're jealous of 
has everything that a person would need.

851
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:27,340
And that's rarely the case,
but that's somewhat besides the point.

852
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,560
Look,
in your end,

853
00:48:29,561 --> 00:48:30,394
the lurks,
the beginnings of a structure of 

854
00:48:33,221 --> 00:48:34,054
ambition.
You wouldn't be envious of something if 

855
00:48:36,491 --> 00:48:39,760
you didn't believe that that was a value
that you should possess.

856
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:42,310
Okay,
so the first thing is make a list of all

857
00:48:42,311 --> 00:48:46,810
the people you're in vsl and then figure
out what it is about them that you envy.

858
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:48,550
Okay?
Now those are your goals.

859
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:50,290
All of a sudden,
right now,

860
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:53,650
you might be doubtful that you can 
attain those goals and I don't know what

861
00:48:53,651 --> 00:48:55,210
the goals would be.
You know,

862
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:58,180
like maybe it's beauty for God sake.
Maybe you're envious.

863
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,073
Maybe just for the sake of argument,
you assume that you're not a very good 

864
00:49:01,901 --> 00:49:02,734
looking person.
We can assume you're not blessed by the 

865
00:49:04,721 --> 00:49:08,830
same set of physical attributes that a 
Hollywood star might manifest.

866
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:11,320
You know,
and maybe you're envious of that.

867
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:12,611
I was like,
well,

868
00:49:12,611 --> 00:49:15,520
you might start to think,
well in first of all,

869
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,580
you might think about whether or not 
there are dimensions of evaluation along

870
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:21,423
which someone might be judged that are 
as important or more important than 

871
00:49:26,681 --> 00:49:28,450
physical attractiveness,
right?

872
00:49:28,451 --> 00:49:29,284
Because there's multiple.
There's multiple dimensions along which 

873
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:37,360
a person's positive attributes might be 
rank ordered and considered,

874
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:38,283
so you might want to broaden out your 
conceptualization of what constitutes 

875
00:49:41,531 --> 00:49:42,364
the good in human action,
but then like if it is a matter of 

876
00:49:46,301 --> 00:49:48,160
attractiveness,
then you may have to,

877
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:49,083
and I'm picking this one because it's a 
particularly difficult one 

878
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:52,270
attractiveness.
It's like,

879
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:53,470
well,
what could you do?

880
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:57,230
Like how often do you get your haircut 
and is it flattering gift,

881
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:58,083
someone professional doing it?
Do you know how to use makeup properly 

882
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:02,490
and carefully,
you know,

883
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,490
are you in reasonable physical condition
or are there,

884
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,473
are there steps that you could take to 
put yourself in reasonable physical 

885
00:50:10,151 --> 00:50:10,810
condition?

886
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:14,740
Do you have some nice clothes like it's 
a matter of decomposition,

887
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,470
so let's assume we'll be optimistic 
about this.

888
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:19,060
You're envious.
Okay,

889
00:50:19,061 --> 00:50:20,920
well that means there's some things you 
value.

890
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:21,993
You don't have them,
but it's the beginnings of a 

891
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:24,783
philosophical stance,
so you lay out what it is you're about 

892
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:28,641
and you think,
well,

893
00:50:28,641 --> 00:50:31,310
these persons,
these people have this and this and this

894
00:50:31,311 --> 00:50:32,144
and this and I don't.
And that's unfair and it might be 

895
00:50:35,121 --> 00:50:35,954
unfair.
It's probably not an unfairness that 

896
00:50:38,401 --> 00:50:39,234
specifically aimed at you.
It's probably more a general reflection 

897
00:50:43,911 --> 00:50:48,410
of the unfairness and inequality that's 
part of life and that's worth knowing,

898
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:49,483
but in any case,
you lay out your envy and you and you 

899
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:54,800
delve deep into it and you find out,
well,

900
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:57,320
here's what I want because you're 
envious,

901
00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:00,260
envious because you see other people 
that have what you want.

902
00:51:00,261 --> 00:51:01,094
Okay,
good.

903
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:04,430
Now all of a sudden you know what you 
want or that's useful,

904
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:05,293
terrifying,
because you might see that it's so 

905
00:51:06,591 --> 00:51:07,424
distant from you,
but you can at least lay out and then 

906
00:51:10,191 --> 00:51:12,710
maybe even admit to yourself what you 
want.

907
00:51:12,711 --> 00:51:13,544
Because the other thing is is that you'd
be unlikely to be so envious if you 

908
00:51:18,081 --> 00:51:23,081
weren't hiding from yourself.
What it is that you that you truly want.

909
00:51:23,691 --> 00:51:25,940
You might be terrified to admit it 
because,

910
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,080
well,
once you admit it,

911
00:51:27,081 --> 00:51:29,360
then you know what you want and you know
when you're failing,

912
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:30,973
you know,
and and by hiding what you want from 

913
00:51:32,331 --> 00:51:33,164
yourself,
well then you can hide to some degree 

914
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:36,163
the fact that you're not getting it and 
that you're failing and it's no wonder 

915
00:51:39,651 --> 00:51:40,484
that people do that.
So make a list of what you're envious 

916
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:43,203
of.
Extract from that the virtues that you 

917
00:51:45,651 --> 00:51:47,000
would like to pursue.

918
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:50,210
Understand clearly then,
unless you pursue those virtues,

919
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:51,253
you're not going to get what you want 
and the envy will consume you more and 

920
00:51:54,201 --> 00:51:57,380
that's like a good pathway to hell.
That's not a good thing.

921
00:51:57,830 --> 00:51:58,663
And so make a plan.
Here's some things that other people 

922
00:52:01,401 --> 00:52:02,234
have that I want.
How can I start to move towards having 

923
00:52:05,361 --> 00:52:08,060
some of that myself?
And that's a,

924
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:11,550
that's the right way to deal with it.
So because the other,

925
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:12,403
what's the alternative?
You're going to tear these people down 

926
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:15,060
or or,
or,

927
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,193
or manifest hatred for,
for them and maybe take your revenge 

928
00:52:19,191 --> 00:52:22,490
when you can on the people around you 
because you're so angry and you're going

929
00:52:22,491 --> 00:52:25,100
to tear yourself into pieces,
like you said,

930
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:28,110
consumed by envy.
Right?

931
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:28,651
And,
and that,

932
00:52:28,651 --> 00:52:30,860
that's like,
that's a Predator metaphor.

933
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,580
Envy is something that's eating you up 
because that's not good,

934
00:52:34,581 --> 00:52:35,414
you know,
but it's really good that you've at 

935
00:52:36,981 --> 00:52:37,814
least admitted it,
that start part of that confrontation 

936
00:52:40,401 --> 00:52:41,234
with his shadow.

937
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,610
So you can see your dark side there.
You know,

938
00:52:43,611 --> 00:52:46,610
when you could look at your fantasies,
because if you're consumed by envy,

939
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,280
no doubt you have some pretty damn 
brutal fantasies.

940
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,530
I wish this is what happened to that 
person.

941
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:52,723
No God,
they think they're so smart and it's 

942
00:52:53,991 --> 00:52:54,824
like,
I hope they fall and I get a chance to 

943
00:52:56,151 --> 00:52:57,410
kick them well on debt.
Well,

944
00:52:57,411 --> 00:52:58,244
they're down.
Maybe you can join a twitter mob and 

945
00:52:59,661 --> 00:53:02,210
take them out if they make a mistake,
you know,

946
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:03,673
but that can also get you in touch with 
the dark side of you that maybe has the 

947
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:07,784
ability to to put forward some 
commitment to moving forward in the 

948
00:53:11,301 --> 00:53:13,640
future that can make you tough and 
strong,

949
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:18,440
and so you might also start with the 
consideration that you could move in the

950
00:53:18,441 --> 00:53:20,810
direction that you desire,
right?

951
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,390
If you were willing to make the proper 
sacrifices,

952
00:53:23,990 --> 00:53:24,823
I'm willing to do the work and maybe if 
you could find out what would truly 

953
00:53:27,331 --> 00:53:30,720
motivate you,
which might be the desire to cease being

954
00:53:30,721 --> 00:53:33,510
consumed by envy,
that would be a good start.

955
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:38,490
And then to pursue these goals that are 
implicit in your jealousy,

956
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,530
well then you have a direction for your 
life.

957
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,550
So in what directions are you aiming 
raw?

958
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,533
Well,
you're assuming that you're being 

959
00:53:48,571 --> 00:53:49,404
unfairly treated and that it's.
And that there's something personal 

960
00:53:52,051 --> 00:53:52,884
about that now you probably are being 
unfairly treated in some sense because 

961
00:53:56,251 --> 00:53:57,084
that's just the human condition.
I would say like there's a real 

962
00:53:59,521 --> 00:54:00,354
arbitrary element of life.
You're subject to the depredations of 

963
00:54:02,971 --> 00:54:07,971
nature and the tyranny of culture and 
your own appalling shortcomings,

964
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,100
you know,
and that's life.

965
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:13,950
It's not personal.
Exactly,

966
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:14,784
and that's worth knowing.
It's part of the standard human 

967
00:54:16,381 --> 00:54:17,214
condition and you should aim at 
rectifying your envy and some of that's 

968
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:22,013
going to be dropping that bitter 
resentment and the other is going to be 

969
00:54:24,121 --> 00:54:24,954
pursuing what you need to pursue to 
allow you to view your life as at least 

970
00:54:29,581 --> 00:54:30,870
acceptable.
Right?

971
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:34,320
So,
so there's hope in the NV once you admit

972
00:54:34,321 --> 00:54:36,300
it,
because it gives you moral direction.

973
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:40,310
Hello,
Dr Peterson,

974
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:41,503
what would you advise to a person who 
has the courage to defy the crowd but 

975
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:48,500
doesn't have the verbal skills to debate
real time?

976
00:54:58,940 --> 00:54:59,773
Well,
look,

977
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:02,510
there's lots of ways of defining the 
crowd.

978
00:55:02,511 --> 00:55:03,344
Let's say.
I mean you could live your life the way 

979
00:55:05,571 --> 00:55:09,560
that you want live id that's matter of 
action and know,

980
00:55:09,561 --> 00:55:12,020
and they say actions speak louder than 
words,

981
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:17,380
and one of the best things you can 
possibly be is a inspirational example.

982
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:19,093
So that's not nothing.
That's that something live properly in 

983
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:27,080
your defiance of the crowd,
right?

984
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:29,913
Make your own course,
allow yourself to be guided by your own 

985
00:55:33,791 --> 00:55:34,624
genuine principles.
You don't necessarily have to advertise 

986
00:55:37,301 --> 00:55:40,210
that which is in some sense what you're 
doing when you,

987
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:41,133
when you're debating because you're 
taking the manner in which you act like 

988
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:47,740
if you're an integrated person and 
you're articulating that,

989
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,820
but maybe you can't do that because you 
don't have the verbal skills.

990
00:55:51,821 --> 00:55:52,654
Well then the question would be maybe 
you should develop some more verbal 

991
00:55:55,001 --> 00:55:56,650
skills.
I'm like,

992
00:55:56,651 --> 00:55:58,570
I don't know this for sure date if you 
know,

993
00:55:58,571 --> 00:56:00,880
but,
but generally it's useful.

994
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,570
How do you do that?
It doesn't hurt to read.

995
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:08,860
Really doesn't hurt to write,
you know,

996
00:56:08,861 --> 00:56:11,500
a little bit of writing everyday 
clarifies your thinking.

997
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:14,800
It's a hard thing to do and it's an 
unlikely thing.

998
00:56:14,801 --> 00:56:16,600
Most people won't do it,
but man,

999
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:17,823
you know,
you wouldn't be asking me this question 

1000
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,433
if you didn't think at some level that 
some improvement in your verbal ability 

1001
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:27,490
would be useful to you.

1002
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:28,900
Also,
how do you do that?

1003
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,860
You read,
you think you're right.

1004
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:33,783
The reason you write is because writing 
forces you to articulate your thoughts 

1005
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:40,630
and organize your brain around whatever 
it is that you're writing about.

1006
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:44,950
And then one of the easiest ways to 
write there isn't any real easy way,

1007
00:56:44,951 --> 00:56:47,860
but when the easiest ways to write is to
write down a problem,

1008
00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:48,641
it's like,
well,

1009
00:56:48,641 --> 00:56:49,240
what's,
what,

1010
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:52,960
what problem is bothering me?
Or you can write about that.

1011
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:56,260
First of all to get the problem clear 
because that's a hard thing.

1012
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:57,243
Then you start to write about what my 
possible solutions be and if you fight 

1013
00:57:01,091 --> 00:57:05,170
with those solutions because you know,
you want to kill off the stupid ones and

1014
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:06,310
then,
you know,

1015
00:57:06,311 --> 00:57:10,270
maybe you need to learn to speak more 
fluently.

1016
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:12,720
Maybe you need to,
um,

1017
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,020
what,
what,

1018
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,430
what,
what might we say?

1019
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:20,550
You could try a class in improvisation 
and maybe that's too daunting.

1020
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:28,560
You could join a speaker's club like 
toastmasters.

1021
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:30,043
Um,
you could try talking more at dinner 

1022
00:57:32,291 --> 00:57:34,780
parties a little bit more.
Once you formulate your thoughts,

1023
00:57:34,781 --> 00:57:39,010
you have to be willing to be somewhat of
a bumbling fool to begin with,

1024
00:57:39,011 --> 00:57:39,844
right?
Because you're gonna not if and maybe 

1025
00:57:42,461 --> 00:57:43,294
you're better,
your verbal skills are better than you 

1026
00:57:44,441 --> 00:57:45,630
think they are,
you know,

1027
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:46,563
and you're just self conscious,
but you have to practice putting 

1028
00:57:49,181 --> 00:57:51,870
yourself forward a little bit and tended
to flee.

1029
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,100
You can do a lot of that,
you know,

1030
00:57:54,101 --> 00:57:58,390
a lot of that initial learning how to 
interact with people though,

1031
00:57:58,570 --> 00:57:59,403
by asking them questions about what they
think and then responding instead of 

1032
00:58:03,401 --> 00:58:06,100
being too concerned about putting your 
own point forward.

1033
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:07,540
So,
all right,

1034
00:58:07,541 --> 00:58:08,374
so what's the answer?
What would I advise to the person who 

1035
00:58:10,781 --> 00:58:12,910
has the courage to defy the crowd?
Good.

1036
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:15,790
Live according to your principles,
right?

1037
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:16,623
And that's not a verbal thing and you 
can be a good example and now it's a 

1038
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:20,973
major accomplishment.
But then if you need to improve your 

1039
00:58:24,731 --> 00:58:26,830
verbal ability,
which is generally a good thing,

1040
00:58:26,831 --> 00:58:28,930
then those are the ways to do it.
Read,

1041
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:32,410
write,
speak,

1042
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:35,370
and,
and,

1043
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:36,483
and understand that developing those 
abilities might be of tremendous use to 

1044
00:58:39,761 --> 00:58:40,510
you.
You know,

1045
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:43,180
because it's one thing to live properly 
and that's not a trivial thing,

1046
00:58:43,181 --> 00:58:44,014
but it's another thing to be able to 
articulate yourself and to be able to 

1047
00:58:46,931 --> 00:58:47,764
negotiate and generally speaking,
there's nothing about that that isn't 

1048
00:58:51,161 --> 00:58:56,161
advantageous and even introverted and 
anxious people can learn to do that.

1049
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,033
You know,
it's.

1050
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,380
Those are learnable skills.
It's not easy but,

1051
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:01,690
but,
but you can manage it.

1052
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:05,830
You can also.
You can also speak carefully.

1053
00:59:05,831 --> 00:59:06,664
You know,
and listen to what you're saying and 

1054
00:59:07,661 --> 00:59:10,030
only try to say things that you think 
are true.

1055
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:13,390
That's also unbelievably useful.
You have to feel that out.

1056
00:59:13,391 --> 00:59:14,224
Like,
is this really what I believe or am I 

1057
00:59:16,271 --> 00:59:20,680
putting it forward because I want to 
look good or I want to dominate or,

1058
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:22,853
or I wanted to express bleakly and 
emotion that I'm too cowardly to come 

1059
00:59:27,261 --> 00:59:30,140
out and confront directly.
Or Am I being manipulative?

1060
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:33,050
There's lots of reasons that people use 
language,

1061
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:38,230
but what you really should use it for is
to state what you believe to be true and

1062
00:59:38,991 --> 00:59:43,991
then to let the consequences of that 
unfold and so that can also help you.

1063
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:50,120
Simple truths,
bluntly stated,

1064
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,253
can be very powerful.
You don't need a lot of verbal fluency 

1065
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:57,800
under those circumstances if there's 
evidence of strength of character behind

1066
00:59:57,801 --> 00:59:59,240
it.
So

1067
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:06,590
the Dao de Jing speaks of acting 
naturally well,

1068
01:00:06,591 --> 01:00:11,000
I don't know if that's true.
If it's acting naturally.

1069
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,193
It depends on what you mean by naturally
the Tao Te Ching speaks of acting in a 

1070
01:00:17,391 --> 01:00:21,770
manner that balances Yin and Yang,
the balances chaos and order,

1071
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,233
and that means that you're speaking in 
the right place at the right time about 

1072
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:29,324
the right things,
and that's allied with part of what I 

1073
01:00:33,651 --> 01:00:36,320
just discussed with regards to speaking 
the truth.

1074
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:38,863
How is one to put their foot down and 
change slash better their condition 

1075
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:44,540
without an unnaturally manipulating 
their world?

1076
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:45,883
Well,
the fundamental answer to that is to 

1077
01:00:51,591 --> 01:00:54,710
speak the truth and to let

1078
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:59,380
the consequences of that unfold,
but then the trick is,

1079
01:00:59,381 --> 01:01:00,214
well,
how is it that you come to speak the 

1080
01:01:01,631 --> 01:01:03,100
truth?
Well,

1081
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:05,950
in order to do that,
as far as I can tell,

1082
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:10,090
you have to be terrified of the 
consequences of not speaking the truth.

1083
01:01:10,091 --> 01:01:13,000
And and part of that is,
well,

1084
01:01:13,001 --> 01:01:13,834
look,
do you want the truth on your side or 

1085
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:15,940
not?
Do you want to?

1086
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:20,800
Do you want to be facing the truth as an
enemy?

1087
01:01:20,801 --> 01:01:25,210
Or do you want to have the truth behind 
you as an ally?

1088
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:30,460
And the truth is reality.
And I don't see that you want reality as

1089
01:01:30,461 --> 01:01:31,294
an enemy.
And so if what you do is use your 

1090
01:01:33,191 --> 01:01:37,900
language to represent reality as 
accurately as you possibly can.

1091
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:40,930
Now given all your inadequacies and 
biases,

1092
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:43,690
you're bound to make errors.
But that's the goal.

1093
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:47,230
Then you have the force of reality 
behind you.

1094
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:48,513
It's,
it's as if you've you know where you 

1095
01:01:50,321 --> 01:01:53,290
are.
You might not like it and you may be,

1096
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:54,273
you know,
maybe it's a terrible craggy chasm full 

1097
01:01:57,221 --> 01:01:58,054
of lava and water,
but at least you can see where the 

1098
01:02:00,131 --> 01:02:02,440
obstacles are and you can pick your way 
through it.

1099
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:08,080
So and then the naturalness is well

1100
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:17,010
from the Dallas perspective.
In some sense you're,

1101
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:20,040
you're,
you're aiming at being at peace with the

1102
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:20,874
world.
And that means accepting it in some 

1103
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:25,374
sense for what it is.
And you can't speak the truth unless 

1104
01:02:29,341 --> 01:02:33,240
you're willing to do that.
And that means to a large degree,

1105
01:02:33,241 --> 01:02:36,150
it means all,
it means exploring the depths of Yin and

1106
01:02:36,151 --> 01:02:36,984
Yang of order and chaos,
the order to know that like there are 

1107
01:02:40,291 --> 01:02:41,124
tyrannical forces afoot and some of them
are operated in you and some of them 

1108
01:02:46,261 --> 01:02:50,910
operate in the social world and,
and some of them operate for that matter

1109
01:02:50,911 --> 01:02:54,210
in the natural world,
too much crushing order.

1110
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:56,453
And on the chaotic side,
there's the possibility of nihilism and 

1111
01:02:58,531 --> 01:03:01,620
hopelessness and depression and that 
complete cataclysm.

1112
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:03,940
And so you're,
you're,

1113
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:04,890
you're,
you're,

1114
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:09,270
there's cliffs on both sides of you and 
you have to be aware of that because you

1115
01:03:09,271 --> 01:03:13,110
don't want to fall into those cliffs and
there's a thin pathway between them that

1116
01:03:13,111 --> 01:03:16,440
you can,
that you can walk down if you're careful

1117
01:03:16,950 --> 01:03:21,950
and you feel your way down that pathway 
by noting how,

1118
01:03:22,470 --> 01:03:23,303
what you say,
noting whether what you say puts a 

1119
01:03:28,191 --> 01:03:31,830
foundation underneath you that that's,
there's a New Testament,

1120
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:33,053
um,
injunction to that goal to build your 

1121
01:03:34,831 --> 01:03:36,750
house on a rock not on sand.

1122
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:38,143
And what's the rock or the rock is the 
truth and integrity of your character 

1123
01:03:41,911 --> 01:03:46,710
and have your voice.
That's what it is and why you see

1124
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:53,490
you want to aim at something noble.
That's the alliance with God.

1125
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:54,353
That's one way of thinking about it.
You want to serve the highest good and 

1126
01:03:57,541 --> 01:03:59,550
you have to think very hard about what 
that is.

1127
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:00,443
I mean,
we know what it is to some degree or we 

1128
01:04:01,681 --> 01:04:02,514
have some.
We have some collective conception of 

1129
01:04:04,741 --> 01:04:05,970
that.
You know,

1130
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:08,910
it would be piece.
That would be something.

1131
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:10,223
It would be the willingness and desire 
to treat other people like you would 

1132
01:04:14,461 --> 01:04:17,700
like to be treated if you were treating 
yourself properly.

1133
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:23,000
It's that as well.
It's it's characterological nobility.

1134
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,233
It's the desire to serve the good.
It's truth and beauty and all of those 

1135
01:04:27,541 --> 01:04:31,080
classic virtues all integrated into a 
single thing.

1136
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:32,393
You want to serve that and then you and 
then having aimed at that you won't do 

1137
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:38,790
and that,
that,

1138
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:40,650
that,
that governs how you're going to see the

1139
01:04:40,651 --> 01:04:41,341
world,
right?

1140
01:04:41,341 --> 01:04:43,990
That sets the sets,
the,

1141
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:51,920
that sets the lens or it sets the frame 
through which the world manifests itself

1142
01:04:53,071 --> 01:04:54,840
to you.
Right?

1143
01:04:54,841 --> 01:04:55,674
So it's as if you're getting your 
spectacles adjusted properly and then 

1144
01:04:59,131 --> 01:04:59,964
the world reveals itself to you and then
you use your language to articulate 

1145
01:05:04,741 --> 01:05:07,470
that.
And that's,

1146
01:05:09,330 --> 01:05:11,570
that's the,
um,

1147
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:15,810
that's naturally.
It's not,

1148
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:16,980
it's not natural.
It's very.

1149
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,380
Now you know,
if you don't do that,

1150
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,083
what you do is end up.
You end up using your language to 

1151
01:05:23,951 --> 01:05:26,380
manipulate people into giving you what 
you want.

1152
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:29,980
And that's not helpful because,
you know,

1153
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:34,060
what do you know about what you want?
Give me one second.

1154
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:35,200
Give me one second.

1155
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:56,893
Okay,

1156
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:05,110
sorry about that.
My son,

1157
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:06,273
my son's basement.
My house is being renovated in Toronto 

1158
01:06:08,621 --> 01:06:09,454
for well til this afternoon and he's got
a new puppy and he was rolling a bone 

1159
01:06:14,651 --> 01:06:18,220
upstairs on the floor for this puppy is 
very cute by the way.

1160
01:06:18,221 --> 01:06:20,650
This puppy that's making quite a lot of 
racket.

1161
01:06:20,651 --> 01:06:24,320
So I just had to take care of that.
Um,

1162
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:28,440
so just give him a good cuff and.
No,

1163
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:29,283
I just asked him.
I just told him that the ball was 

1164
01:06:31,241 --> 01:06:32,920
rolling around,
so

1165
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:37,310
look,
part of this is faith and truth.

1166
01:06:37,311 --> 01:06:39,410
You know,
like really it's hard to.

1167
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:44,450
It's hard to emphasize this.
Importantly enough.

1168
01:06:44,540 --> 01:06:47,120
You have to make a decision in your life
at some point.

1169
01:06:47,121 --> 01:06:50,360
Look about how you're going to use your 
words.

1170
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:54,100
You can use them instrumentally and you 
can use them to manipulate people.

1171
01:06:54,101 --> 01:06:54,501
You say,
well,

1172
01:06:54,501 --> 01:06:55,334
this is what I want from this situation 
and here's how I'm going to have to 

1173
01:06:58,581 --> 01:07:02,510
craft my words to get it.
Or you can think,

1174
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:04,223
oh,
I'm oriented properly in the world and 

1175
01:07:06,261 --> 01:07:10,400
I'm going to save what I think and let 
things happen,

1176
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:12,103
and those are two different.
They're really two different modes of 

1177
01:07:14,091 --> 01:07:16,280
being.
I wrote about this in 12 rules for life.

1178
01:07:16,850 --> 01:07:19,210
They're really two different modes of 
being and the latter,

1179
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:20,083
the latter one,
which is faith and truth as the same as 

1180
01:07:22,821 --> 01:07:25,790
faith in the logo,
spite away from a symbolic perspective.

1181
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,073
It's the faith.
That truth is that which turns 

1182
01:07:29,751 --> 01:07:33,080
uninhabitable.
Chaos into habitable order.

1183
01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:36,340
It's the truth that does that,
and so you,

1184
01:07:36,490 --> 01:07:39,140
you tell the truth and you throw caution
to the wind.

1185
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:40,133
It doesn't mean you tell the truth 
stupidly because telling the truth 

1186
01:07:42,291 --> 01:07:43,124
stupidly isn't truthful.
You have to do it very carefully and 

1187
01:07:46,161 --> 01:07:48,020
very strategically,

1188
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:52,680
strategically,

1189
01:07:54,730 --> 01:07:56,400
well,
and the strategic part,

1190
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:57,293
the goal is to get better all the time 
at carefully articulating what 

1191
01:08:01,171 --> 01:08:04,290
constitutes the truth.
You know,

1192
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:06,173
it seems obvious to me in some sense.
It's like you got to really think this 

1193
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:09,151
through.
It's like,

1194
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:12,930
what do you want on your side?
You want false hood on your side.

1195
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:15,120
It's like,
who thinks that you really,

1196
01:08:15,410 --> 01:08:16,243
that you're going to be able to lie and 
manipulate your way through the world 

1197
01:08:18,681 --> 01:08:19,970
and that you're going to get away with 
that,

1198
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:25,010
but there's an arrogance that goes along
with that arrogance in belief,

1199
01:08:25,490 --> 01:08:26,323
that arrogance of belief in your 
capability to deceive and that you're 

1200
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:32,210
going to pull the wool over everyone's 
eyes,

1201
01:08:32,211 --> 01:08:33,740
right?
You're going to deceive yourself because

1202
01:08:33,741 --> 01:08:37,130
you're going to believe in your own 
maliciousness and mendacious snus.

1203
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:38,113
You're going to deceive other people 
because they're stupid and they won't 

1204
01:08:39,951 --> 01:08:40,784
catch on and you're going to see you're 
going to deceive God and reality itself 

1205
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:49,210
because it's not going to snap back and 
take you out if you bend and distort it,

1206
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:52,910
like that's so foolish.
You don't have a hope,

1207
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:53,833
none of that.
You might get away with your lies for a 

1208
01:08:56,361 --> 01:08:57,194
certain amount of time,
but they're going to aggregate and take 

1209
01:09:00,231 --> 01:09:03,050
you out and at every level,
not least,

1210
01:09:03,051 --> 01:09:05,060
your own guilt in your own self 
contempt.

1211
01:09:05,570 --> 01:09:06,403
And so,

1212
01:09:14,990 --> 01:09:19,990
so where was that?
Well,

1213
01:09:27,030 --> 01:09:32,030
that's good answer to that question.
I agree.

1214
01:09:35,701 --> 01:09:39,330
We don't live in into radical patriarch.
Can you provide a better explanation for

1215
01:09:39,331 --> 01:09:40,164
the iniquities women face,
especially lateness of the right to 

1216
01:09:42,481 --> 01:09:43,410
vote,
et cetera.

1217
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:45,000
Well,
you know,

1218
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:47,700
130 years ago,
let's say,

1219
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,410
let's take $8,
95,

1220
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:54,270
just as a starting point.
The world wasn't the same place as it is

1221
01:09:54,271 --> 01:09:56,370
now.
You know,

1222
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:01,563
rights and privileges spread as the 
social and economic conditions make 

1223
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:11,130
their manifestation possible to some 
degree to some degree.

1224
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:13,873
Um,
and I'm not suggesting that men have 

1225
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:20,800
oppressed women and the women have been 
oppressed man Christ,

1226
01:10:20,801 --> 01:10:21,634
we've been at each other's throats in 
many ways throughout the entire course 

1227
01:10:24,881 --> 01:10:27,210
of human history.
Men that the throats of men,

1228
01:10:27,610 --> 01:10:30,760
men at the throats of women,
women at the throats of men,

1229
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:35,230
women at the throats of women,
parents at the throats of children,

1230
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:36,353
like there's no shortage of 
contentiousness and tyranny that 

1231
01:10:39,341 --> 01:10:42,760
characterizes human history.
So,

1232
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:46,200
but
in 18,

1233
01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:47,043
95,
the average person in the western world 

1234
01:10:48,881 --> 01:10:49,714
lived on less than a dollar a day in 
today's money way below the current UN 

1235
01:10:54,161 --> 01:10:56,890
standards for poverty.
Life was very,

1236
01:10:56,891 --> 01:11:00,220
very hard.
There was no reliable birth control.

1237
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:01,993
Like you can't underestimate the radical
consequences of reliable birth control 

1238
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:07,390
now that,
that,

1239
01:11:07,390 --> 01:11:10,300
that opened up the world to women and 
it's not just birth control,

1240
01:11:10,301 --> 01:11:13,070
it's a whole variety of technological 
transformations.

1241
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:13,913
And,
and also an increase in the safety of 

1242
01:11:16,381 --> 01:11:17,214
the street to a hundred.
I'm contributing factors that opened up 

1243
01:11:22,220 --> 01:11:23,053
the world to the freedom of women.
But a huge part of that was the 

1244
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:28,373
collective
striving of men and women to free 

1245
01:11:32,731 --> 01:11:37,731
themselves from the absolute tyranny of 
hand to mouth existence.

1246
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:41,940
You know,
a woman was,

1247
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:43,223
well,
let's say sexually mature back at that 

1248
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:45,384
time around 15 or 16,
very likely to be married soon after 

1249
01:11:48,091 --> 01:11:48,924
that.
I'm partly because sex outside of 

1250
01:11:51,451 --> 01:11:52,284
marriage was so unbelievably dangerous,
very high probability of pregnancy and 

1251
01:11:56,371 --> 01:12:01,230
then of death in childbirth and then it 
and then death of children,

1252
01:12:01,231 --> 01:12:05,700
and then continual pregnancy.
Women weren't the same even biologically

1253
01:12:05,701 --> 01:12:06,534
speaking,
that the birth control pill is a 

1254
01:12:07,681 --> 01:12:12,681
biological revolution and it took a long
time to extend the full codery of rights

1255
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:17,160
to people.
Even man.

1256
01:12:17,161 --> 01:12:18,480
It was like Jesus.

1257
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:21,240
Most men in eastern Europe,
for example,

1258
01:12:21,241 --> 01:12:25,320
were serfs until the late 18 hundreds.
Fundamentally slaves.

1259
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:26,180
It's,
it's,

1260
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:27,013
it's not as if the common person has had
the right to vote for any substantial 

1261
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:33,264
amount of time in some countries for a 
couple of hundred years and that's all 

1262
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:38,100
like were,
were,

1263
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:41,450
were clambering out of the great 
darkness of,

1264
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:46,700
of biological history and creating a 
culture where people have enough freedom

1265
01:12:48,901 --> 01:12:49,734
to be to exercise.
What would optimally be their full set 

1266
01:12:54,001 --> 01:12:57,900
of rights and to say that that didn't 
happen at the pie in the past,

1267
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:58,793
primarily because of the Patriarchal 
Dominion of men is I think an escape 

1268
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:05,093
from full confrontation with the 
absolute dreadful horror of biological 

1269
01:13:09,871 --> 01:13:11,700
history.
It's an.

1270
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:12,773
It's a wish that all of the things about
life that are deeply troublesome and 

1271
01:13:17,131 --> 01:13:17,964
terrible are a consequence of the errors
made by those who control the social 

1272
01:13:22,561 --> 01:13:26,400
structure and God,
it would be really something if they had

1273
01:13:26,401 --> 01:13:27,390
that much power.

1274
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:28,081
You know,
it's like,

1275
01:13:28,081 --> 01:13:28,914
well,
we can make things bad or good by women 

1276
01:13:31,531 --> 01:13:32,820
by Fiat.
It's like,

1277
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:34,043
no,
you're,

1278
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:34,883
you're facing the terrible dragon of 
nature and she's something awful to 

1279
01:13:38,251 --> 01:13:40,440
behold and you're,
you're,

1280
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:42,030
you're,
you're tyrannical.

1281
01:13:42,031 --> 01:13:42,864
Patriarchy is a relatively ineffective 
forest in the face of the absolute 

1282
01:13:47,761 --> 01:13:49,620
depredations of Mother Nature.
I mean,

1283
01:13:49,621 --> 01:13:50,454
even now,
we're powerful technologically compared 

1284
01:13:52,831 --> 01:13:55,740
to how we have been in the past and you 
know,

1285
01:13:55,741 --> 01:13:56,574
we've extended our life a lot,
but we still only manage about 80 years 

1286
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:04,260
and lot of that is still characterized 
by my mental and physical illness.

1287
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:08,040
You know,
we're still subject to the limitations,

1288
01:14:08,041 --> 01:14:08,874
that awful limitations of biology ways 
that are almost too terrifying to be 

1289
01:14:12,341 --> 01:14:15,160
hold.
And so we we shy away from that and say,

1290
01:14:15,161 --> 01:14:16,110
well,
it's all,

1291
01:14:16,111 --> 01:14:16,944
all the suffering as a consequence of 
something that's oppressive and under 

1292
01:14:19,781 --> 01:14:21,220
the control of human beings.

1293
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:24,370
So like I know I wish that was the case,
but it isn't.

1294
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:29,230
And that's not to say that social 
structures lack corruption,

1295
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:30,333
but
it's not as if 150 years ago all men 

1296
01:14:35,231 --> 01:14:36,064
were free and all women were enslaved.
The truth of the matter is 150 years 

1297
01:14:40,181 --> 01:14:42,850
ago,
virtually everyone was enslaved.

1298
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:44,950
So and it,
it's,

1299
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:45,793
it's a long bloody hole out of that.
You don't want a tremendous amount of 

1300
01:14:49,511 --> 01:14:50,344
that has taken place over the last 130 
years with the absolute revolution in 

1301
01:14:55,061 --> 01:15:00,061
living standard and an availability of 
food and proliferation of consumer items

1302
01:15:00,701 --> 01:15:02,590
and the,
the,

1303
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:03,513
the,
the construction of the formulation of 

1304
01:15:06,911 --> 01:15:08,640
labor saving devices.
You know,

1305
01:15:08,641 --> 01:15:13,641
that that freed women from the grinding 
misery of constant domestic work for,

1306
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:18,730
for tens of hours a week at 
extraordinarily low pay.

1307
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:23,670
And the and the,
the provision of a

1308
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:28,820
universally accessible hygienic 
facilities,

1309
01:15:28,821 --> 01:15:29,654
toilets everywhere is a big deal.
It allows people to move around and to 

1310
01:15:32,871 --> 01:15:33,704
operate out in the world and,
and tampons and sanitary products and 

1311
01:15:37,011 --> 01:15:39,800
birth control and all of that.
Jesus,

1312
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:42,933
women were oppressed because people were
oppressed and perhaps women were more 

1313
01:15:45,911 --> 01:15:49,870
oppressed than men,
although even that's not obvious because

1314
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:54,520
you know,
men suffered brutally in warfare,

1315
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:56,050
absolutely,
brutally,

1316
01:15:56,350 --> 01:15:57,240
and,
and,

1317
01:15:57,790 --> 01:15:59,560
and died at a,
at a rate.

1318
01:16:00,780 --> 01:16:04,600
Um,
if you eliminate child birth,

1319
01:16:04,601 --> 01:16:05,434
deaths from the equation died at a rate 
that exceeded the rate that women died 

1320
01:16:09,221 --> 01:16:10,054
at and we're required to sacrifice 
themselves for the protection of women 

1321
01:16:15,161 --> 01:16:15,994
and children.
It's like human history is a nightmare 

1322
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,310
and that nightmare involves

1323
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:26,570
incredible difficulty in struggling for,
to survive.

1324
01:16:27,170 --> 01:16:28,003
And we emerged out of that men and women
together and have been attempting to 

1325
01:16:33,741 --> 01:16:34,574
free each other to the degree that 
that's possible in the course of that 

1326
01:16:38,091 --> 01:16:41,630
struggle.
And so that's how it looks to me.

1327
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:48,340
You have talked about earning your 
knowledge.

1328
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:51,690
How do you define man?
You guys?

1329
01:16:51,691 --> 01:16:54,480
You put up some viciously good questions
today.

1330
01:16:54,481 --> 01:16:55,620
Man.
I got to say,

1331
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:58,110
these are tough questions.
They're very good question.

1332
01:16:58,111 --> 01:16:58,944
So this is devin amp.
You've talked about earning your 

1333
01:17:01,141 --> 01:17:03,570
knowledge.
How do you define this and earn it?

1334
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:06,180
When is it okay to debate ideas like 
yours?

1335
01:17:06,181 --> 01:17:11,181
If they are not your own?
Well,

1336
01:17:12,971 --> 01:17:13,804
I would say it's okay to debate them 
right away if what you're trying to do 

1337
01:17:18,611 --> 01:17:21,790
is to test them and learn more about 
them.

1338
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,624
Right?
But it's not okay if you're trying to 

1339
01:17:24,011 --> 01:17:24,844
put them forward as if they're your own 
and to obtain something approximating 

1340
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:30,993
unearned moral superiority by doing so.
So that means to have the ideas and to 

1341
01:17:36,191 --> 01:17:39,190
discuss them,
not to identify with them as if they are

1342
01:17:39,191 --> 01:17:43,210
defining characters that defining 
features of your own personality,

1343
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:46,030
how do you earn knowledge

1344
01:17:48,390 --> 01:17:52,470
well and allow your elementary school 
teachers,

1345
01:17:52,471 --> 01:17:53,304
when you're writing an essay,
he said you got to put it in your own 

1346
01:17:55,291 --> 01:17:56,280
words.
Think,

1347
01:17:56,281 --> 01:17:57,180
well,
what does that mean?

1348
01:17:57,210 --> 01:18:00,150
You can't just copy a sentence.
It has to be in your own words.

1349
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:04,260
And you know,
to me that was never very well explained

1350
01:18:04,261 --> 01:18:05,670
to me,
but there was something to it.

1351
01:18:05,671 --> 01:18:06,504
It's like

1352
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:08,993
for knowledge to be yours,
you have to integrate it with your own 

1353
01:18:12,901 --> 01:18:17,901
experience.
You have to see how that applies to your

1354
01:18:18,061 --> 01:18:22,230
own case and then have a story to tell 
about how that's the case.

1355
01:18:22,350 --> 01:18:24,000
That's personal,
right?

1356
01:18:24,030 --> 01:18:27,900
So it's the intermingling of the 
abstract with the personal that makes it

1357
01:18:27,930 --> 01:18:28,763
real.
It's the intermingling of the epic with 

1358
01:18:30,871 --> 01:18:33,150
the particular or the archetipal with 
the,

1359
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:35,880
with the concrete that makes something 
real,

1360
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,730
and so if an idea is still an 
abstraction,

1361
01:18:38,731 --> 01:18:43,110
if you're just parroting it and it also 
means that you haven't learned to use it

1362
01:18:43,111 --> 01:18:43,944
as a tool,
you haven't started to apply it in your 

1363
01:18:45,961 --> 01:18:47,970
own life because you could say,
well,

1364
01:18:47,971 --> 01:18:48,804
here's an idea that I came across and 
here's how I implemented it and here's 

1365
01:18:52,621 --> 01:18:56,280
what I learned when I implemented it,
and then that's definitely yours,

1366
01:18:56,281 --> 01:18:57,114
right?
Because you're and you can kind of tell 

1367
01:18:58,531 --> 01:19:03,531
because you're recounting your knowledge
in a manner that no one else could do

1368
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:06,613
it,
and that's what gives it that ring of 

1369
01:19:07,741 --> 01:19:08,980
genuineness,
right?

1370
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:12,140
That's what it means in some sense,
to speak from the heart.

1371
01:19:12,150 --> 01:19:12,901
It's like,
well,

1372
01:19:12,901 --> 01:19:17,840
here's my experience with this idea and 
you can say to,

1373
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:20,340
well,
here's how I understand this idea,

1374
01:19:20,850 --> 01:19:21,683
and you read,
formulate that in your own terms and 

1375
01:19:23,701 --> 01:19:26,180
that means that you associate it with 
your own,

1376
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:27,213
with the own union,
with the unique particularities of your 

1377
01:19:30,601 --> 01:19:31,434
own experience.
And then I would also say it means that 

1378
01:19:33,361 --> 01:19:37,150
you've acted out the ideas and tested 
them like in,

1379
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:38,083
in the world,
and that you have your own stories to 

1380
01:19:40,351 --> 01:19:44,760
tell about that and that's how you make 
it your own.

1381
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:49,830
It's like you go to the tool store,
the hardware store,

1382
01:19:49,831 --> 01:19:51,540
and you buy a hammer,
you know,

1383
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:56,220
and then you start to use the hammer to 
hammer in nails and you learn how to use

1384
01:19:56,221 --> 01:19:57,054
the hammer.
You learn how to use the saw and then 

1385
01:19:58,740 --> 01:19:59,573
you know,
at some point that saw sort of becomes 

1386
01:20:00,841 --> 01:20:03,030
yours.
You know how to use it.

1387
01:20:03,390 --> 01:20:06,330
And it's the same with these ideas.
It's like you don't just,

1388
01:20:06,650 --> 01:20:07,483
you don't just say the words.
You're not just a puppet mouthing the 

1389
01:20:11,521 --> 01:20:12,354
words.
It becomes part and parcel of your own 

1390
01:20:14,311 --> 01:20:17,160
philosophy,
the way that you perceive the world.

1391
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:20,430
The way that you construe things in the 
way that you act in the world,

1392
01:20:20,431 --> 01:20:22,980
you've tested them and you have your 
own.

1393
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,960
You have something to add to them.
That's yours personally.

1394
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:29,520
You know,
and if you.

1395
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:34,320
If you're having a discussion with 
someone and they're talking about things

1396
01:20:34,321 --> 01:20:36,480
that don't have those characteristics,
right,

1397
01:20:36,481 --> 01:20:37,314
that they haven't made personal,
then the conversation is almost never 

1398
01:20:39,751 --> 01:20:42,990
interesting.
It's because the person is.

1399
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:45,420
It's just an.
They're just.

1400
01:20:45,630 --> 01:20:48,060
They really are an empty shell through 
which

1401
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:53,270
ideologues etiology,
cliches and slogans are pouring.

1402
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:54,313
There's nothing about that that's 
compelling because you don't see the 

1403
01:20:58,401 --> 01:20:59,234
grappling.
You don't see that the other person has 

1404
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:02,293
grappled with the ideas and come to 
their own unique conclusions and it 

1405
01:21:06,471 --> 01:21:10,310
really is in that mingling of the 
abstract and the particular.

1406
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:15,320
That compelling wisdom is to be found 
and so that's,

1407
01:21:15,650 --> 01:21:20,120
that's and then concretely speaking,
well,

1408
01:21:20,150 --> 01:21:20,983
there's ways of earning your knowledge 
and part of that is reformulating it in 

1409
01:21:25,101 --> 01:21:26,960
your own words.
That's thinking it through,

1410
01:21:26,961 --> 01:21:27,794
right?
And discussing it until you have it at 

1411
01:21:30,201 --> 01:21:31,034
hand.
You can talk about it and you can 

1412
01:21:32,601 --> 01:21:34,970
generalize from it because you truly 
understand it,

1413
01:21:35,150 --> 01:21:35,983
but a huge part of that is also putting 
it into practice and driving your own 

1414
01:21:39,441 --> 01:21:40,274
conclusions as a consequence.
And some of that can be done with 

1415
01:21:42,831 --> 01:21:43,760
debate.
It's like,

1416
01:21:43,790 --> 01:21:44,623
here's an idea.
I came across and here's the idea and 

1417
01:21:47,151 --> 01:21:47,984
here's what I think it means and this is
how I think it would change things if I 

1418
01:21:53,001 --> 01:21:53,834
put it into practice,
this is how I understand this idea and 

1419
01:21:56,930 --> 01:21:58,610
what do you think of that?

1420
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:03,110
Like that's a good debate or discussion,
you know,

1421
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:05,180
because then the other person can say,
well,

1422
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:06,133
I don't really agree with the way you 
formulated that or I don't agree with 

1423
01:22:08,031 --> 01:22:08,864
your conclusions and hopefully it's a 
real discussion and not just one 

1424
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:12,620
upmanship,
you know,

1425
01:22:12,621 --> 01:22:15,800
because that's a pretty dull game and 
then,

1426
01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:17,543
oh,
then you get clearer about what it is 

1427
01:22:18,441 --> 01:22:22,040
that the idea is and how it is that you 
would use it as a tool in your own life.

1428
01:22:22,041 --> 01:22:24,130
And that's the right way to think about 
ideas to.

1429
01:22:24,590 --> 01:22:26,060
Well,
partly they're,

1430
01:22:26,420 --> 01:22:27,253
they're tools for looking at the world 
with because you have to look at the 

1431
01:22:30,981 --> 01:22:33,320
world with tools because you can't look 
at the whole world,

1432
01:22:33,500 --> 01:22:34,333
so you're looking at the world through a
tool like structure and then the ideas 

1433
01:22:36,711 --> 01:22:37,544
themselves are tool like and they need 
to be used and worn a bit in your hands 

1434
01:22:42,051 --> 01:22:44,240
before their,
before their years.

1435
01:22:44,690 --> 01:22:45,523
So have you ever thought about engaging 
in a public debate with Slavoj 

1436
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:50,873
[inaudible] Jack,
he has many interesting observations on 

1437
01:22:52,971 --> 01:22:56,660
the topic of videology and that would be
a good conversation conversation.

1438
01:22:56,810 --> 01:22:59,720
Yes.
We have a tentative,

1439
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:01,273
we haven't been speaking tentatively 
about the possibility of having a 

1440
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:09,370
discussion in Toronto in April.
And so,

1441
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:14,550
um,
we're negotiating and um,

1442
01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:16,000
we'll see how that goes.

1443
01:23:17,490 --> 01:23:20,070
We'll see if he's available and if I'm 
available,

1444
01:23:20,071 --> 01:23:23,010
if we can agree on a set of topics,
if we can,

1445
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:25,473
if we can undertake all the complex 
detailed negotiations necessary to make 

1446
01:23:30,701 --> 01:23:34,240
something like that successful in the 
public sphere.

1447
01:23:34,620 --> 01:23:35,453
Um,
I'm confident enough that this will 

1448
01:23:36,971 --> 01:23:37,804
occur,
that I've already done downloaded about 

1449
01:23:39,610 --> 01:23:40,443
six of his books because I really want 
to start understanding what he has to 

1450
01:23:45,610 --> 01:23:48,610
say and think before undertaking that.
So,

1451
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:52,153
so yes,
I've thought about it more than thought 

1452
01:23:54,981 --> 01:23:56,570
about it.
The offer is out,

1453
01:23:56,690 --> 01:23:57,523
the negotiations are underway.
How do you maintain a stable identity 

1454
01:24:03,141 --> 01:24:06,050
when you are plagued by bouts of 
depression and anxiety?

1455
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:08,510
Well,
the first thing we might say is that you

1456
01:24:08,511 --> 01:24:10,760
can't,
you know what I mean?

1457
01:24:10,761 --> 01:24:13,400
If you're playing by boats of depression
and anxiety,

1458
01:24:13,401 --> 01:24:16,790
that does destabilize your identity.
So,

1459
01:24:17,080 --> 01:24:19,760
um,
it's almost by definition,

1460
01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:22,280
but having said that,
look,

1461
01:24:22,281 --> 01:24:27,281
this is when habit and plan
and strategy are so useful.

1462
01:24:28,491 --> 01:24:31,070
So in the periods of depression that I 
had,

1463
01:24:31,490 --> 01:24:33,500
what sustained some of them were long 
and,

1464
01:24:33,501 --> 01:24:34,334
and,
and certainly the most unpleasant 

1465
01:24:36,501 --> 01:24:38,650
experiences of my life.
Um,

1466
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:43,190
you,
this is when you need a philosophy,

1467
01:24:43,191 --> 01:24:44,024
let's say that's aligned with your 
vision and your strategy to sustain you 

1468
01:24:47,151 --> 01:24:51,680
because what would,
what would happen to me is that I know I

1469
01:24:51,681 --> 01:24:52,514
have these,
a vision and I suppose the vision is of 

1470
01:24:55,101 --> 01:24:55,934
a world that's better in,
in it's less likely to descend into 

1471
01:25:01,401 --> 01:25:02,234
ideological catastrophe and where people
are more responsible and more awake and 

1472
01:25:07,190 --> 01:25:08,950
more educated and,
and,

1473
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:11,210
and healthier,
all of that,

1474
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:13,410
a vision of a better world,
you know,

1475
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:14,413
a world that's less hellish at least,
but also a better world and some sense 

1476
01:25:18,441 --> 01:25:20,510
of what role I might play in that.

1477
01:25:20,830 --> 01:25:22,940
And,
and so that's very motivating.

1478
01:25:22,941 --> 01:25:27,230
Like it's a profound goal too to try to 
make things better.

1479
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,750
And you can do that locally.
You can do that for yourself,

1480
01:25:29,751 --> 01:25:30,584
you can do that for your family,
you can do that for the broader 

1481
01:25:32,451 --> 01:25:34,280
community and all of that.
It's worth it,

1482
01:25:34,281 --> 01:25:36,350
man.
It's worth making some sacrifices for.

1483
01:25:36,351 --> 01:25:41,351
It's worth suffering for to some degree.
And then you decompose that into the day

1484
01:25:42,141 --> 01:25:42,974
to day and week to week strategies and 
actions that you're undertaking the 

1485
01:25:46,581 --> 01:25:47,360
plans.
And,

1486
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:47,950
and,
and,

1487
01:25:47,950 --> 01:25:52,950
and the activities that you're putting 
forward to make that dream a reality,

1488
01:25:53,150 --> 01:25:57,110
to realize it.
And then when the depression and anxiety

1489
01:25:57,111 --> 01:25:59,990
come along,
you think part of it with depression,

1490
01:25:59,991 --> 01:26:00,824
it's like it's just bloody endurance.
It's like get up and you work through 

1491
01:26:05,121 --> 01:26:07,700
the next hour.
You try to stay on track,

1492
01:26:07,701 --> 01:26:08,534
you try to implement your strategic 
plans to the best of your ability and 

1493
01:26:12,081 --> 01:26:15,380
you hope and you pray that you'll get 
through it.

1494
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:20,440
You'll get through it and that the 
darkness will recede and you,

1495
01:26:20,690 --> 01:26:21,370
you,
you,

1496
01:26:21,370 --> 01:26:24,950
you stay on track,
you eat even though you're not hungry,

1497
01:26:24,951 --> 01:26:27,890
you get off.
Even though you want to stay in bed,

1498
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:31,340
you interact with people even though 
you'd rather be alone.

1499
01:26:31,670 --> 01:26:32,570
And it's,
it's,

1500
01:26:32,630 --> 01:26:33,463
it's,
it's the benefit of discipline habits 

1501
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,260
can,
can sustain you.

1502
01:26:39,261 --> 01:26:40,094
It's like the boat,
you're rowing in through a terrible 

1503
01:26:42,141 --> 01:26:42,974
storm,
leaks and all and maybe you'll be 

1504
01:26:44,870 --> 01:26:45,703
overwhelmed,
but you have the boat and you can roll 

1505
01:26:47,481 --> 01:26:48,314
forward and that's what you've got.
And so when durance is a huge part of 

1506
01:26:51,711 --> 01:26:54,560
it,
and then I would say with it's anxiety,

1507
01:26:54,561 --> 01:26:55,394
it's the same thing.
It's like are very much the same as 

1508
01:26:58,130 --> 01:26:58,963
you're terrified and and uncertain,
but you move ahead to the best of your 

1509
01:27:03,471 --> 01:27:04,304
ability and again,
you operate at least to some degree on 

1510
01:27:07,191 --> 01:27:08,024
hope and if you haven't got hope,
then you've got blind bloody endurance 

1511
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:12,223
and that's all motivated by some sense 
that you're working towards something 

1512
01:27:15,681 --> 01:27:18,400
that's worthwhile working toward,
you know,

1513
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:22,520
and that is while that's your own 
longterm wellbeing,

1514
01:27:22,730 --> 01:27:23,563
to treat yourself properly,
it's the stability and productivity and 

1515
01:27:26,931 --> 01:27:28,880
harmony and health of your family.

1516
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:29,893
That's a huge deal.
And then it's whatever benefit you can 

1517
01:27:32,391 --> 01:27:33,224
be to the community and if you have to 
limp along and drag yourself forward in 

1518
01:27:38,271 --> 01:27:39,104
order to maintain that pathway,
then so be it because it's better than 

1519
01:27:44,421 --> 01:27:45,410
the alternative.

1520
01:27:48,750 --> 01:27:49,561
So,
and I'm not,

1521
01:27:49,561 --> 01:27:53,280
and I know that you can become depressed
enough so that you know you're virtually

1522
01:27:53,281 --> 01:27:54,114
a mobilized,
but you do what you can to fight it and 

1523
01:27:57,361 --> 01:27:58,194
you,
and then you do what you can to treat 

1524
01:27:59,461 --> 01:27:59,911
it.
You know,

1525
01:27:59,911 --> 01:28:03,450
it's like,
have you tried antidepressants?

1526
01:28:03,451 --> 01:28:05,730
Have you gone to speak to a 
professional?

1527
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:10,590
Have you done what you need to do to 
investigate?

1528
01:28:10,591 --> 01:28:11,424
The causes of your depression and 
anxiety because often there's physical 

1529
01:28:14,731 --> 01:28:16,950
reasons that that might be the case.
You know,

1530
01:28:16,951 --> 01:28:17,784
like I've learned notoriously that a 
fair bit of the negative emotion that I 

1531
01:28:21,211 --> 01:28:22,044
experienced to seem to be associated 
with an auto immune problem that was 

1532
01:28:24,961 --> 01:28:27,420
associated with food sensitivity.
Jesus.

1533
01:28:27,421 --> 01:28:28,254
Like I hadn't,
I would have never believed that was 

1534
01:28:31,201 --> 01:28:33,360
possible 10 years ago.
Even though I did.

1535
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:34,313
I had learned by that point that my 
susceptibility to negative emotion was 

1536
01:28:39,331 --> 01:28:41,940
definitely exacerbated.
For example,

1537
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:42,774
if I was hungry,
so I knew there was some relationship 

1538
01:28:45,001 --> 01:28:45,834
with food,
but I had no idea that it was as 

1539
01:28:46,871 --> 01:28:49,650
profound as it turned out to be.
And so,

1540
01:28:50,150 --> 01:28:52,050
but don't.
And then.

1541
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:55,710
Well,
the other thing you can do too is that

1542
01:28:56,990 --> 01:28:59,690
as the negative emotion ramps up in 
intensity,

1543
01:28:59,870 --> 01:29:04,410
the amount of time you construe as 
manageable shrinks,

1544
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:05,513
you know,
and if you're extremely depressed and 

1545
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:10,860
anxious that you know,
you may be struggling to get through the

1546
01:29:10,860 --> 01:29:11,693
day and then you need a map of what is 
going to constitute a minimally 

1547
01:29:18,331 --> 01:29:19,164
acceptable day.
And that might be one where you'd done 

1548
01:29:22,171 --> 01:29:24,270
what you need.
So that when you wake up to moral,

1549
01:29:24,271 --> 01:29:26,310
things aren't worse,
right?

1550
01:29:26,311 --> 01:29:27,144
You have to keep up with your 
obligations and your duties at least 

1551
01:29:29,941 --> 01:29:32,790
enough so that you're not degenerating 
downhill.

1552
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:34,493
And

1553
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:42,140
Yeah,
the other thing too is that you,

1554
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:43,043
you also learn that you act out the 
things that you would do when you're 

1555
01:29:47,331 --> 01:29:49,250
normal.
Even when you're depressed,

1556
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,350
you know you don't want to see people.
Well,

1557
01:29:51,430 --> 01:29:52,263
it doesn't matter you go see them 
because it's better than not seeing 

1558
01:29:54,951 --> 01:29:55,641
them.
You know,

1559
01:29:55,641 --> 01:29:57,590
when you find,
when you do see them that it's better,

1560
01:29:57,591 --> 01:29:58,424
it'll go better than you think,
but you can't isolate yourself and 

1561
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:03,830
you're anxious and so you want to avoid.
You don't want to go out.

1562
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:04,953
You'd rather stay home and sit in the 
chair and just sit there and like in a 

1563
01:30:07,521 --> 01:30:09,830
frozen position,
it's like you can't do that.

1564
01:30:09,831 --> 01:30:10,664
You have to go out and go grocery 
shopping and go out and have coffee and 

1565
01:30:13,671 --> 01:30:14,504
all of those things.
It doesn't matter whether you enjoyed 

1566
01:30:15,841 --> 01:30:16,674
the,
it matters that you do them because 

1567
01:30:18,141 --> 01:30:18,974
that's what you do.
That's what you do in order to maintain 

1568
01:30:21,171 --> 01:30:22,330
your health.
And,

1569
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:23,393
and so a huge part of it is like head 
down in Durham and that'll get you 

1570
01:30:28,371 --> 01:30:30,230
through bad times.
That endurance,

1571
01:30:30,231 --> 01:30:30,870
it's,
it's,

1572
01:30:30,870 --> 01:30:31,703
it's such an under represented virtue 
that ability to trudge forward under a 

1573
01:30:38,270 --> 01:30:42,470
trudge forward,
unhappily under a unfairly burden.

1574
01:30:42,471 --> 01:30:45,500
Some loan is a testament to character if
you can,

1575
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:47,720
and it's something that should be

1576
01:30:49,930 --> 01:30:54,930
encouraged and valued.
So you know,

1577
01:30:55,651 --> 01:30:56,484
and I'm not making the claim that people
who are depressed who can't get out of 

1578
01:31:00,181 --> 01:31:01,014
bed lack endurance,
some do and some don't because 

1579
01:31:03,811 --> 01:31:04,644
depression comes in very varied degrees 
of intensity in and you can be laid out 

1580
01:31:10,801 --> 01:31:15,801
completely or depression.
So I'm not trying to make some arbitrary

1581
01:31:15,931 --> 01:31:18,750
judgment about who's gone into Europe 
and who hasn't.

1582
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:19,913
You can't do that from outside.
But I can say that endurance is one of 

1583
01:31:23,461 --> 01:31:28,461
the tools you have to deal with chronic 
discomfort and pain,

1584
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:31,230
you know,
and even if you have chronic pain,

1585
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:34,140
it's interesting because it's very much 
allied with depression.

1586
01:31:34,141 --> 01:31:37,440
By the way,
all of the research on chronic pain,

1587
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:38,580
back pain,
for example,

1588
01:31:38,581 --> 01:31:39,414
indicates and chronic pain have all 
sorts is that the more you allow your 

1589
01:31:43,831 --> 01:31:46,290
pain to render,
you inactive,

1590
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:47,543
the worst outcome,
including exacerbation of the pain and 

1591
01:31:51,211 --> 01:31:52,044
depression is a pain disorder.
And so that's very much worth thinking 

1592
01:31:54,871 --> 01:31:57,240
about too.
It's like move forward,

1593
01:31:57,300 --> 01:31:59,220
move forward,
move

1594
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:01,833
you know,
and if you need to talk to somebody 

1595
01:32:02,681 --> 01:32:05,920
about what your plan is for the day or 
the hour or the week,

1596
01:32:06,070 --> 01:32:10,660
then do that as well.
And perhaps you also have helped get the

1597
01:32:10,661 --> 01:32:11,494
people around you to help a bit.
I need a little bit of help getting up 

1598
01:32:13,511 --> 01:32:14,344
in the morning.
I need to have breakfast made for me so 

1599
01:32:16,811 --> 01:32:17,644
that all I do when I get up in my,
in my terrible state of fog and 

1600
01:32:20,741 --> 01:32:21,574
confusion and terrible anxiety and 
depression is I have a shower because 

1601
01:32:24,581 --> 01:32:25,414
that's what happens first.
And then the next thing is I eat and 

1602
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:28,833
then that's better.
You're at least you're out of bed and 

1603
01:32:30,091 --> 01:32:32,350
moving and that's,
that's a start.

1604
01:32:32,351 --> 01:32:33,820
You know,
so

1605
01:32:35,610 --> 01:32:38,850
and then you indira and hope and that's 
how it is.

1606
01:32:39,090 --> 01:32:39,923
And you do the same thing when someone 
in your family is sick or when you're 

1607
01:32:42,151 --> 01:32:44,100
facing a death,
all of that.

1608
01:32:44,550 --> 01:32:48,180
It's like one bloody foot in front of 
the other up the hill.

1609
01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:55,460
How are you always so consistently 
composed and confident?

1610
01:32:56,410 --> 01:32:57,243
Yeah.
Well,

1611
01:32:57,890 --> 01:32:59,360
I wouldn't say that I am.

1612
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:00,793
Um,

1613
01:33:04,010 --> 01:33:05,090
I know what you mean.

1614
01:33:07,410 --> 01:33:07,921
Well,
look,

1615
01:33:07,921 --> 01:33:08,900
you know,
I'm,

1616
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:10,113
I'm not that young.
I'm just about 60 years old and so I 

1617
01:33:12,421 --> 01:33:13,254
have a lot of experience behind me and 
I've seen a lot of things and I've 

1618
01:33:16,441 --> 01:33:19,790
learned to be detached to some degree,
you know,

1619
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:20,633
that's one thing you learned as a 
clinician as people are always talking 

1620
01:33:22,621 --> 01:33:23,454
to you about terrible things and that 
difficulties in their life and you can 

1621
01:33:27,331 --> 01:33:32,331
take that home and have it destroy you 
because you're constantly exposed to the

1622
01:33:34,891 --> 01:33:37,740
troubles of existence and they're real 
troubles.

1623
01:33:37,741 --> 01:33:38,600
You know?
I mean,

1624
01:33:38,730 --> 01:33:39,563
it's not unique to clinicians.
You see that with physicians in 

1625
01:33:43,290 --> 01:33:48,290
Palliative care workers and people who 
work in morgues and emergency responders

1626
01:33:49,321 --> 01:33:52,350
and like there's lots of people who face
the,

1627
01:33:52,390 --> 01:33:55,620
the very difficult aspects of life very 
frequently.

1628
01:33:58,110 --> 01:34:00,270
You detach yourself from it to some 
degree,

1629
01:34:00,271 --> 01:34:03,180
you know,
and I don't mean in a disinterested way,

1630
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:04,933
I mean in a,

1631
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:11,140
in a way that is sort of allied with a 
longer term view.

1632
01:34:11,490 --> 01:34:13,930
You know,
like if I'm doing an interview now with,

1633
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:17,890
with someone who's attacking me and I 
can get irritable.

1634
01:34:17,891 --> 01:34:20,380
I think I was too irritable in the Gq 
interview,

1635
01:34:20,381 --> 01:34:22,330
for example,
which some of you might've watched.

1636
01:34:23,170 --> 01:34:24,003
I think,
well I'm not going to jump to 

1637
01:34:25,511 --> 01:34:27,940
conclusions about how this is going to 
go.

1638
01:34:28,630 --> 01:34:31,660
Even even with regards to how it feels 
right in the moment.

1639
01:34:31,661 --> 01:34:32,494
We'll see how it unfolds across time and
I'll try to manage myself in the moment 

1640
01:34:37,241 --> 01:34:41,230
with the least amount of upset that I 
can manage.

1641
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:46,060
And it's part of the doctrine of minimal
minimal necessary force.

1642
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:49,270
One of the things I've learned,
if you're.

1643
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:50,493
If you have a dispute with someone and 
it needs to be settled and maybe they 

1644
01:34:55,721 --> 01:34:56,554
need to change than you,
and that's not always the case because 

1645
01:34:59,811 --> 01:35:02,180
sometimes the saddling requires change 
on your part,

1646
01:35:02,181 --> 01:35:03,014
but let's say that they have to be 
defeated in some sense in comparison to 

1647
01:35:07,341 --> 01:35:08,174
you.
You don't want to defeat them any more 

1648
01:35:09,381 --> 01:35:10,580
than necessary.
You know,

1649
01:35:10,581 --> 01:35:11,414
it's like you don't knock your opponent 
to the ground and then jump up and down 

1650
01:35:14,511 --> 01:35:17,270
on them three or four times in triumph.
You know,

1651
01:35:17,510 --> 01:35:18,380
you,
you,

1652
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:20,053
you,

1653
01:35:20,990 --> 01:35:23,270
you pin them in London and then let them
up.

1654
01:35:24,260 --> 01:35:25,093
Minimal necessary force because any more
than that just produces a counter 

1655
01:35:31,161 --> 01:35:33,290
reaction.
And so,

1656
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:41,060
and I guess the other thing is too is my
motivation when I'm engaged,

1657
01:35:41,090 --> 01:35:41,923
let's say in these discussions,
is that I'm not trying to win the 

1658
01:35:45,111 --> 01:35:48,170
argument.
I'm not trying to win.

1659
01:35:50,390 --> 01:35:53,270
I'm trying to say what I think as 
clearly as I can.

1660
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:56,450
And there is.
There might be an element.

1661
01:35:57,050 --> 01:35:57,883
There might be one of the consequences 
of that might be what appears to be a 

1662
01:36:01,641 --> 01:36:02,510
victory,
but

1663
01:36:04,040 --> 01:36:09,040
the victory is a victory for your 
ability to articulate what you believe

1664
01:36:11,120 --> 01:36:11,953
and that's what I'm trying to do,
and so that's another reason to stay 

1665
01:36:15,321 --> 01:36:16,370
composed.
It's like,

1666
01:36:16,371 --> 01:36:17,204
well,
okay,

1667
01:36:17,660 --> 01:36:20,540
this person has just thrown a curve ball
at me.

1668
01:36:20,541 --> 01:36:21,380
It's like,
all right,

1669
01:36:21,381 --> 01:36:26,090
so well
I could be thinking,

1670
01:36:26,091 --> 01:36:26,924
well,
I don't want to be undermined by that 

1671
01:36:27,801 --> 01:36:30,650
and I don't want to make a fool of 
myself and I don't want to be put on the

1672
01:36:30,651 --> 01:36:31,484
spot,
and of course all of those things are 

1673
01:36:32,211 --> 01:36:34,700
true,
but mostly what I'm thinking about is,

1674
01:36:34,701 --> 01:36:36,590
okay,
well now I've got that question.

1675
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:42,440
I want to answer as truthfully as I 
possibly can.

1676
01:36:42,890 --> 01:36:47,420
What do I think about what was just sad 
and I'm not calculating the outcome.

1677
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:51,910
I'm assuming this is a mark of faith,
right?

1678
01:36:51,911 --> 01:36:55,990
This is the faith that that,
that people have talked about

1679
01:36:57,940 --> 01:37:02,940
being something that has to be 
manifested necessarily.

1680
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:05,560
It'd be talking about this since the 
dawn of time.

1681
01:37:05,800 --> 01:37:06,633
What's the faith?
The faith is that if you say what you 

1682
01:37:09,791 --> 01:37:10,624
believe to be true,
then whatever happens is the best thing 

1683
01:37:14,351 --> 01:37:17,740
that could've happened,
and I believe that,

1684
01:37:18,010 --> 01:37:18,843
so that's what I really believe it 
partly because I believe that if you're 

1685
01:37:22,721 --> 01:37:25,390
deceitful,
which is the opposite of that,

1686
01:37:25,450 --> 01:37:27,940
or manipulative or malicious or 
malevolent,

1687
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:29,673
but maybe primarily manipulative,
then what you're acting out is your 

1688
01:37:33,131 --> 01:37:38,131
belief that deceit will bring victory,
and I just don't believe that at all.

1689
01:37:39,281 --> 01:37:40,410
I.
I just,

1690
01:37:40,490 --> 01:37:45,490
I think it's a preposterous claim and 
seek won't bring victory.

1691
01:37:46,150 --> 01:37:46,983
Then truth is what brings victory.
If there is such a thing as truth and 

1692
01:37:51,121 --> 01:37:52,900
there's certainly such a thing as 
deceit,

1693
01:37:53,170 --> 01:37:58,170
so there must be such a thing as.
And so some of it's just curiosity too.

1694
01:37:59,911 --> 01:38:00,744
It's like,
well,

1695
01:38:01,050 --> 01:38:03,650
I'm going to say what I think and see 
what happens now.

1696
01:38:03,660 --> 01:38:05,460
It's an adventure.
You know,

1697
01:38:05,461 --> 01:38:07,980
that's the adventure of your life 
really,

1698
01:38:07,981 --> 01:38:11,490
and you don't want to miss that because 
that's what you've got in your life,

1699
01:38:11,491 --> 01:38:15,750
is for it to be an adventure.
It's not an easy road.

1700
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:16,853
You know,
it's a stormy sea and what you have is 

1701
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:24,420
the adventure of contending with God and
the waves.

1702
01:38:24,630 --> 01:38:26,460
That's what you have and

1703
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:29,873
the way you do that is with truth.
And then that sort of takes you out of 

1704
01:38:35,641 --> 01:38:40,110
that
immediacy of the conflict.

1705
01:38:40,530 --> 01:38:44,520
Whoever it is that the conflict with 
whoever it is that you're talking to,

1706
01:38:46,110 --> 01:38:48,630
you're trying to ally yourself with 
something that's

1707
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:53,850
deeper and more profound and more 
elastic.

1708
01:38:58,180 --> 01:39:00,200
Alright.
Like I don't think that I am pretty good

1709
01:39:00,201 --> 01:39:04,780
at it.
Consistently composed and confident,

1710
01:39:05,180 --> 01:39:07,240
you know,
I think I have faith in the truth.

1711
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:14,610
Start the same thing and you know,
I'm an emotional person

1712
01:39:18,110 --> 01:39:19,010
obviously.

1713
01:39:22,970 --> 01:39:25,250
How do you manage to read so much?
Well,

1714
01:39:25,251 --> 01:39:27,770
a lot of that's good fortune,
you know,

1715
01:39:27,771 --> 01:39:32,420
like I seem to have a knack for reading.
It's not,

1716
01:39:33,690 --> 01:39:35,840
it was a gift.
You know,

1717
01:39:35,841 --> 01:39:39,710
like when I was a kid,
if I look at a word once,

1718
01:39:39,711 --> 01:39:42,830
I can always spell it like I have an 
instantly.

1719
01:39:43,370 --> 01:39:45,260
And I've been like that ever since I was
little.

1720
01:39:45,261 --> 01:39:49,670
And so I seem to have a facility for 
very rapid verbal comprehension and then

1721
01:39:49,671 --> 01:39:50,504
my father taught me to read when I was 
very young and I think it was the 

1722
01:39:52,881 --> 01:39:56,270
combination of those two things that 
enabled that for me.

1723
01:39:56,660 --> 01:39:57,493
You know,
I had the natural proclivity of verbal 

1724
01:39:58,911 --> 01:40:00,200
ability.
You know,

1725
01:40:00,201 --> 01:40:00,680
I,
my,

1726
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:03,050
my graduate supervisor,
very smart guy,

1727
01:40:03,051 --> 01:40:04,670
Robert Peel Guy,
really liked,

1728
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,280
he had trouble with spelling,
you know,

1729
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:09,673
I don't know why that is.
People have different talents and I had 

1730
01:40:14,031 --> 01:40:18,540
to tell it for immediate recognition and
memory of words and,

1731
01:40:18,640 --> 01:40:19,580
and,
and,

1732
01:40:20,060 --> 01:40:23,090
and I'm also very verbally fluent.
Let me a sec here.

1733
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:34,033
So I think mostly it's an innate talent.
Now I also do know that the more you 

1734
01:40:39,171 --> 01:40:40,760
read,
generally speaking,

1735
01:40:40,761 --> 01:40:42,790
the faster you get.
Um,

1736
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:44,420
my wife has really,
like,

1737
01:40:44,421 --> 01:40:45,254
she always read,
but she's really started to read more 

1738
01:40:47,030 --> 01:40:47,863
since you've gone to Kendall.
She turns out she really likes her 

1739
01:40:49,551 --> 01:40:51,740
kindle.
She reads a lot more in her reading.

1740
01:40:51,741 --> 01:40:53,110
Speed is increased.
A lot.

1741
01:40:53,430 --> 01:40:54,263
Lot of it's practice.
You can try to speed up your reading by 

1742
01:40:59,411 --> 01:41:02,290
reading a little faster than you're 
comfortable with

1743
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:04,683
it.
I don't know the research literature 

1744
01:41:06,850 --> 01:41:11,850
indicating the utility of that,
but practice is always useful.

1745
01:41:12,940 --> 01:41:13,773
The other thing is,
is that you want to make it part of 

1746
01:41:15,850 --> 01:41:16,683
habit.
You both conceptually and practically a 

1747
01:41:20,231 --> 01:41:22,750
lot of people don't read because they're
afraid of books.

1748
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:26,500
Books aren't their friend,
so you might want to get a few books and

1749
01:41:26,501 --> 01:41:27,820
kind of make them your friend.

1750
01:41:29,260 --> 01:41:32,130
You can start with simpler books,
you know,

1751
01:41:32,140 --> 01:41:32,973
like fiction.
There's lots of good fiction writ 

1752
01:41:35,110 --> 01:41:39,160
written for adolescents and children.
It's pretty straightforward when you can

1753
01:41:39,161 --> 01:41:42,370
start there if you're interested in 
philosophy,

1754
01:41:42,371 --> 01:41:47,230
there's lots of simple guides like the 
idiot's guide to,

1755
01:41:47,850 --> 01:41:50,770
um,
different topics or a beginner's guide.

1756
01:41:50,830 --> 01:41:55,240
I read those things all the time when 
I'm first investigating a new topic,

1757
01:41:55,730 --> 01:41:57,850
you know,
I start with the introductory material,

1758
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:00,460
um,
and I make time for reading,

1759
01:42:00,470 --> 01:42:03,790
like what was,
that was encouraged in my family.

1760
01:42:03,791 --> 01:42:05,650
Like I always read before I went to 
sleep,

1761
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:10,920
I read and I still do that.
I'm somewhat less so because I've become

1762
01:42:12,701 --> 01:42:15,840
so distracted by social media.
But,

1763
01:42:15,841 --> 01:42:18,670
uh,
you set aside a bit of time every day to

1764
01:42:18,671 --> 01:42:19,504
read.
And for me it was always just before I 

1765
01:42:20,291 --> 01:42:21,250
went to bed,
I go to bed,

1766
01:42:21,251 --> 01:42:24,130
turn on the light and read for when I 
was a kid for hours,

1767
01:42:24,131 --> 01:42:28,360
but and if you do something every day 
you do a lot of it.

1768
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:29,620
And so I would say,
well,

1769
01:42:29,621 --> 01:42:32,510
if you want to read,
if you want to make yourself educated is

1770
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:36,670
put aside 20 minutes a day to read or 
10,

1771
01:42:37,130 --> 01:42:39,190
you know,
some small amount of time that you could

1772
01:42:39,191 --> 01:42:41,890
actually steal.
Not Two hours because good luck,

1773
01:42:41,891 --> 01:42:44,440
man.
It's very unlikely you'll manage that.

1774
01:42:44,441 --> 01:42:46,900
But 20 minutes a day,
you know,

1775
01:42:46,901 --> 01:42:51,901
that's two hours a week.
That's 700 hours a year.

1776
01:42:52,450 --> 01:42:55,390
You know,
that's even if you're a slow reader,

1777
01:42:55,391 --> 01:42:56,224
that's a good number of books.
And so you make it a habitual part of 

1778
01:43:00,341 --> 01:43:04,360
your life and you decide that it's going
to be something that you value.

1779
01:43:04,630 --> 01:43:05,463
You investigate carefully what 
resistances you might have to that idea 

1780
01:43:09,341 --> 01:43:10,174
because you might think,
well that's a pseudo intellectual or 

1781
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:16,750
there's something more productive I can 
be doing.

1782
01:43:16,751 --> 01:43:20,290
Or I'm intimidated by books,
or I hate books because I wasn't good at

1783
01:43:20,291 --> 01:43:23,470
reading when I was a kid and I was 
humiliated because of it.

1784
01:43:23,470 --> 01:43:24,303
Or you know,
you've got something against 

1785
01:43:25,541 --> 01:43:26,374
intellectuals or God,
there might all sorts of resistances to 

1786
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:33,640
picking up a book and then you could 
listen to audio books.

1787
01:43:33,670 --> 01:43:36,760
That's a good way around that by hook or
by Crook,

1788
01:43:36,761 --> 01:43:40,300
man,
so you value it.

1789
01:43:40,301 --> 01:43:41,134
You make it a regular part of your life.
You practice doing it and you need a 

1790
01:43:45,401 --> 01:43:46,810
higher goal too is like,
well,

1791
01:43:46,811 --> 01:43:51,740
why should you read well and so that 
you're more informed and you can better?

1792
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:52,953
Why should you be more informed and 
think better because you won't walk 

1793
01:43:55,671 --> 01:43:56,504
blindly into so many pits.
You know you'll be able to negotiate 

1794
01:44:00,471 --> 01:44:01,304
better in your life because you'll be 
more informed and more verbally fluent 

1795
01:44:06,201 --> 01:44:09,740
and you'll have a better sense of how 
the world works and be able to hold your

1796
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:13,400
own in conversations and that'll make 
you more confident.

1797
01:44:13,670 --> 01:44:17,960
Those are all unbelievably good reasons 
to be highly literate.

1798
01:44:17,961 --> 01:44:22,220
This is an incredibly massive,
massive advantage.

1799
01:44:22,850 --> 01:44:24,410
Practical advantage,
you know,

1800
01:44:24,590 --> 01:44:27,890
and it shouldn't be underestimated.
So

1801
01:44:34,890 --> 01:44:35,723
there are many drug addicted mentally 
ill homeless people in my city and it 

1802
01:44:38,131 --> 01:44:38,964
seems to keep getting worse.
How do we help people who don't want to 

1803
01:44:41,221 --> 01:44:42,054
be helped?

1804
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:46,810
Well,
I think you do that by example.

1805
01:44:46,811 --> 01:44:48,700
Fundamentally.
Um,

1806
01:44:48,820 --> 01:44:49,653
there isn't any other way I know of,
to help people who don't want to be 

1807
01:44:52,031 --> 01:44:52,864
helped.
And then I guess I think what you do is 

1808
01:45:03,461 --> 01:45:08,461
you open up you,
it's the same thing I've said many times

1809
01:45:08,711 --> 01:45:09,544
is that
you do what you can to make the things 

1810
01:45:12,531 --> 01:45:15,290
around you better,
you better your family better.

1811
01:45:15,291 --> 01:45:16,124
And then whatever you can manage in your
community know if you're interested in 

1812
01:45:22,070 --> 01:45:25,730
drug addicted and mentally ill know 
there are volunteer,

1813
01:45:25,850 --> 01:45:26,683
you can volunteer,
you can talk to those people and listen 

1814
01:45:31,260 --> 01:45:32,093
because then you'd find out what the 
hell their problems are and then you'd 

1815
01:45:34,021 --> 01:45:36,270
have some sense about how they might be 
helped,

1816
01:45:36,750 --> 01:45:38,130
you know.
But that's a hard thing.

1817
01:45:38,250 --> 01:45:41,100
There's no helping from above

1818
01:45:42,550 --> 01:45:45,340
drug addiction and its combination with 
mental illness.

1819
01:45:45,341 --> 01:45:48,670
Unbelievably complicated problems.
There's no simple solutions.

1820
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:50,073
So.
And it isn't even necessarily obvious 

1821
01:45:51,911 --> 01:45:52,744
that the people that you see who are 
homeless and drug addicted mentally ill 

1822
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:56,673
don't want to be helped,
is that sometimes they have problems 

1823
01:45:59,111 --> 01:46:04,111
that are so absolutely overwhelming that
they can't be helped in any real sense.

1824
01:46:04,151 --> 01:46:04,984
You know,
like if they're unmedicated 

1825
01:46:07,031 --> 01:46:10,150
schizophrenia for example,
with a drug problem,

1826
01:46:10,420 --> 01:46:11,770
Scott,
it's just,

1827
01:46:12,010 --> 01:46:12,843
it's just a nightmare.
It's a nightmare of insane complexity 

1828
01:46:16,571 --> 01:46:17,404
because schizophrenia is very,
very difficult to deal with even even 

1829
01:46:21,970 --> 01:46:22,803
with medication because the medication 
that helps people who are schizophrenia 

1830
01:46:26,890 --> 01:46:30,550
also tends to depress their positive 
emotion and decreased their motivation.

1831
01:46:30,970 --> 01:46:34,030
You know?
So the medications are generally helpful

1832
01:46:34,031 --> 01:46:34,864
and the proper treatment guidelines if 
your schizophrenia generally are stay 

1833
01:46:38,771 --> 01:46:43,771
with your medication because despite the
negative consequences of the medication,

1834
01:46:45,191 --> 01:46:46,024
which aren't trivial,
the consequences of not taking it or 

1835
01:46:48,870 --> 01:46:50,940
worse.
And that's a real Hobson's choice,

1836
01:46:50,941 --> 01:46:53,010
right?
It's a bit of hell in both directions.

1837
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:56,460
But if you really want to know,
I would say

1838
01:46:58,220 --> 01:46:59,053
go have some contact with those people 
and listen to them and learn what the 

1839
01:47:04,791 --> 01:47:05,624
problems are.
Maybe you could start seeing what might 

1840
01:47:06,981 --> 01:47:07,814
be helpful.
It's a really complicated problem and 

1841
01:47:10,821 --> 01:47:11,654
it's different than the problem of 
helping people who don't want to be 

1842
01:47:13,521 --> 01:47:14,354
helped because you have to figure out 
who it is that that doesn't want to be 

1843
01:47:17,211 --> 01:47:18,044
helped first and you don't want to 
assume that just because someone's 

1844
01:47:20,571 --> 01:47:22,160
homeless that they don't want to be 
helped.

1845
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:27,410
I mean that doesn't mean that it's easy 
to figure out how to help them.

1846
01:47:27,980 --> 01:47:28,813
It's not easy.
It's helping people is a very difficult 

1847
01:47:31,131 --> 01:47:31,964
business and it's a very dangerous 
business too because you get tangled up 

1848
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:39,880
in ways that you wouldn't expect and 
that can be an occupational hazard.

1849
01:47:40,281 --> 01:47:41,330
Let's put it that way.

1850
01:47:43,950 --> 01:47:44,783
How do I stop ruminating?
These thoughts are recurring and relate 

1851
01:47:47,521 --> 01:47:51,300
to every and any embarrassing moment 
I've ever had during my lifetime.

1852
01:47:51,930 --> 01:47:54,410
I'm a 76 year old woman.
Well,

1853
01:47:55,110 --> 01:47:55,943
here's something you could try.
Write down everything that you're 

1854
01:47:59,401 --> 01:48:02,280
ruminating about.
I know that seems counterproductive,

1855
01:48:02,281 --> 01:48:03,114
but like see,
ruminations come up accidentally in 

1856
01:48:05,481 --> 01:48:07,710
voluntarily,
unconsciously.

1857
01:48:08,460 --> 01:48:12,240
Whereas if you write down everything 
that you're ruminating about your facing

1858
01:48:12,241 --> 01:48:13,770
them voluntarily,
so I would say,

1859
01:48:13,771 --> 01:48:17,060
well,
open up a journal or word document,

1860
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:17,933
whatever,
and write down every time you ruminate 

1861
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:20,993
about something,
write it down and write down every 

1862
01:48:23,251 --> 01:48:26,730
rumination you can remember exhaustedly,
write them all down.

1863
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:28,673
That would be the first thing.
Then the second thing is standard 

1864
01:48:30,781 --> 01:48:32,820
behavioral therapy practice.
The second thing,

1865
01:48:32,850 --> 01:48:34,580
the next thing would be,
um,

1866
01:48:36,330 --> 01:48:37,163
write down why you think they happened
so that you get a good causal account 

1867
01:48:42,030 --> 01:48:45,300
and then write down well what you 
might've done about them then,

1868
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:46,553
but more importantly,
what you could do about them in the 

1869
01:48:48,571 --> 01:48:49,404
future to avoid that because it doesn't 
matter that something embarrassing 

1870
01:48:52,171 --> 01:48:53,004
happened to you once.
What matters is whether or not you're 

1871
01:48:56,461 --> 01:48:57,294
likely to repeat it in the future,
but my suspicions are that even if you 

1872
01:49:00,241 --> 01:49:03,540
just,
you could just start sampling.

1873
01:49:05,190 --> 01:49:06,023
Write down every ruminating,
ruminating thought that you have 

1874
01:49:09,210 --> 01:49:14,210
voluntarily and think about them in 
detail and write them down in detail.

1875
01:49:14,310 --> 01:49:19,170
Get every little word down and then you 
have that document.

1876
01:49:19,171 --> 01:49:23,370
And then when you have a thought and 
start to ruminate on it,

1877
01:49:23,900 --> 01:49:28,290
um,
then sit down later after the ruminating

1878
01:49:28,291 --> 01:49:32,220
thought goes away and bring it to mind 
voluntarily.

1879
01:49:32,940 --> 01:49:33,773
So every time you ever thought you don't
want to have later practice having that 

1880
01:49:38,821 --> 01:49:39,654
thought on purpose and try that for 
about a month and see what happens 

1881
01:49:43,711 --> 01:49:48,711
because it's often the case that if you 
start thinking about the thoughts,

1882
01:49:49,481 --> 01:49:54,310
you're ruminating on consciously and 
confront them voluntarily,

1883
01:49:54,670 --> 01:49:57,730
that they will start to go away.
So you could try that.

1884
01:49:57,850 --> 01:49:59,800
You could try that.
That should help.

1885
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:18,193
What's the best method to retain what 
you read and to be able to use it in 

1886
01:50:21,651 --> 01:50:23,660
conversation.
Oh,

1887
01:50:23,690 --> 01:50:24,523
well
it's very difficult really to retain 

1888
01:50:37,110 --> 01:50:42,110
anything without recalling it.
So look,

1889
01:50:42,150 --> 01:50:43,710
if you encounter something

1890
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:46,193
and then you encounter it again,
you can usually recognize that you've 

1891
01:50:48,931 --> 01:50:51,630
encountered it before.
That's recognition memory.

1892
01:50:51,631 --> 01:50:54,450
So it's,
it's an important form of memory.

1893
01:50:54,451 --> 01:50:55,284
It's,
it's,

1894
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:58,200
it's the memory that's associated with 
familiarity,

1895
01:50:58,201 --> 01:51:00,660
but it's not the same as being able to 
use something.

1896
01:51:00,661 --> 01:51:01,494
Exactly.
It's a rather shallow form of memory 

1897
01:51:03,211 --> 01:51:07,530
even though it's necessary in order to 
be able to use something.

1898
01:51:08,940 --> 01:51:09,773
You have to recall it.
This is also very useful hint for 

1899
01:51:12,481 --> 01:51:13,314
studying.
If you're studying and you have to 

1900
01:51:14,731 --> 01:51:19,410
remember what you want to do is study,
and then you want to write down what you

1901
01:51:19,411 --> 01:51:22,230
just learned.
So you read the paragraph,

1902
01:51:22,620 --> 01:51:23,453
he closed the book,
and you write down what you remember or 

1903
01:51:25,681 --> 01:51:26,514
you read a chapter and you close the 
book and you write down what you 

1904
01:51:29,371 --> 01:51:32,520
remembered.
Or at least you sit there and you try to

1905
01:51:32,521 --> 01:51:37,500
remember because the way you remember is
by practicing remembering.

1906
01:51:38,430 --> 01:51:41,040
Okay?
So if you're reading and you want to use

1907
01:51:41,041 --> 01:51:45,120
it in conversation and you have to think
about what you read,

1908
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:50,300
you have to put it in your own words.
It's often helpful to close the book and

1909
01:51:50,431 --> 01:51:51,264
write it down or to associate it with 
some problem that you're currently 

1910
01:51:56,311 --> 01:51:57,144
trying to solve.
Do you have to take the knowledge and 

1911
01:51:58,441 --> 01:51:59,274
make it your own and then.
And then that alters the structure 

1912
01:52:03,181 --> 01:52:06,810
through which you look at the world and 
that changes the way that you think,

1913
01:52:06,811 --> 01:52:07,644
so that when you have a conversation the
next time that you're going to have the 

1914
01:52:09,931 --> 01:52:13,860
conversation in a different way.
So merely reading isn't enough.

1915
01:52:13,861 --> 01:52:14,694
You have,
you have to read and think and recall 

1916
01:52:18,570 --> 01:52:19,403
and it's the act of recalling that 
produces the remembering and it's that 

1917
01:52:22,651 --> 01:52:26,430
act of remembering that puts that 
material at hand for you.

1918
01:52:27,330 --> 01:52:32,330
So.
Okay,

1919
01:52:33,641 --> 01:52:35,440
well look,
I'm just about done here.

1920
01:52:35,441 --> 01:52:36,274
It's 1135,
so I've gone for 19 minutes and I hear 

1921
01:52:38,081 --> 01:52:41,410
people rattling room upstairs and I have
to fly dessert today.

1922
01:52:41,411 --> 01:52:44,290
And so I'm going to start out.
I'm going to stop.

1923
01:52:44,790 --> 01:52:45,623
I'm here,
so I'll find one more question and 

1924
01:52:47,631 --> 01:52:48,500
answer it.
And then,

1925
01:52:48,980 --> 01:52:49,813
um,

1926
01:52:54,390 --> 01:52:57,780
I just found out I'm having a girl.
Congratulations.

1927
01:52:57,960 --> 01:52:58,793
What can I do to raise her to think for 
herself and not fall into the modes of 

1928
01:53:02,491 --> 01:53:05,490
thinking proposed by popular culture?
Well,

1929
01:53:07,370 --> 01:53:10,250
you can let her think for herself when 
she's a kid.

1930
01:53:10,730 --> 01:53:11,563
You know,
what you do is so that she practices 

1931
01:53:13,041 --> 01:53:14,570
doing that,
you know?

1932
01:53:14,780 --> 01:53:17,930
Um,
and so that means two

1933
01:53:19,300 --> 01:53:22,780
consciously encourage as much autonomy 
as possible.

1934
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:26,110
So how do you do that?
Well,

1935
01:53:26,111 --> 01:53:26,944
let's say she's a little kid,
she's three and she started to get 

1936
01:53:29,141 --> 01:53:29,974
interested in clothing.
So you lay clothing out of the bed and 

1937
01:53:31,781 --> 01:53:33,970
you say what?
You can wear this or you can wear this.

1938
01:53:34,030 --> 01:53:36,470
You let her make autonomous decisions.
You know,

1939
01:53:36,520 --> 01:53:37,353
with kids,
you don't want to let them choose from 

1940
01:53:40,661 --> 01:53:43,420
an infinite menu.
You want to give them a constraint menu.

1941
01:53:43,421 --> 01:53:44,254
But what you want to do with your 
daughter is allow her to make as many 

1942
01:53:48,851 --> 01:53:52,720
decisions as she can possibly make as 
early as possible.

1943
01:53:53,490 --> 01:53:54,323
You know,
and that doesn't mean the children 

1944
01:53:55,691 --> 01:53:59,080
always know what's best for themselves 
or any nonsense like that.

1945
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:04,440
It just means that you're going to
encourage her autonomy to every,

1946
01:54:06,320 --> 01:54:07,153
in every

1947
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:09,593
measure that you can manage.
And that means you're going to have to 

1948
01:54:11,221 --> 01:54:15,270
be brave and allow her to subject 
yourself to a certain number of risks.

1949
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:17,940
So you,
you,

1950
01:54:17,970 --> 01:54:22,970
you raise her to think for herself by 
letting her think for herself.

1951
01:54:24,030 --> 01:54:26,460
And that can start.
That can start quite early.

1952
01:54:28,080 --> 01:54:28,913
I would say when she's a teenager,
she's going to fall into the modes of 

1953
01:54:31,531 --> 01:54:32,364
thinking proposed by popular culture 
because that's part of being 

1954
01:54:34,651 --> 01:54:35,484
enculturated socialized.
It's virtually inevitable and it's even 

1955
01:54:38,911 --> 01:54:42,020
somewhat desirable,
but what you hope is that you've.

1956
01:54:43,170 --> 01:54:44,003
You've encouraged the capacity for 
autonomous thinking to a sufficient 

1957
01:54:48,811 --> 01:54:49,644
degree that it's likely to integrate 
with that more intense teenage 

1958
01:54:53,731 --> 01:54:54,564
socialization and then reemerge.
So you get someone who comes out the 

1959
01:54:57,931 --> 01:55:02,310
other side as an autonomous individual 
and that works with boys and girls.

1960
01:55:02,311 --> 01:55:04,020
So.
So you know,

1961
01:55:04,021 --> 01:55:05,700
let's,
I guess you do.

1962
01:55:05,701 --> 01:55:09,080
What Japan did in Pinocchio is the first
thing you decided is,

1963
01:55:09,330 --> 01:55:10,640
well,
you don't want to raise a puppet.

1964
01:55:12,270 --> 01:55:14,460
Don't you want to raise an autonomous 
person,

1965
01:55:14,820 --> 01:55:18,390
and and then you think through what does
it mean to be an autonomous person?

1966
01:55:18,391 --> 01:55:20,310
What sort of person do you want your 
child to be?

1967
01:55:20,340 --> 01:55:21,173
What,
what sort of person do you want to 

1968
01:55:22,771 --> 01:55:26,790
encourage your child to be?
And then having,

1969
01:55:26,970 --> 01:55:29,790
having,
having established that vision in mind,

1970
01:55:29,791 --> 01:55:30,624
that's going to guide your choices,
but at least you're making the right 

1971
01:55:33,361 --> 01:55:34,194
choices.
You don't want someone who's dependent 

1972
01:55:35,701 --> 01:55:40,701
and whiny and clingy and and,
and more frightened than they need to be

1973
01:55:40,770 --> 01:55:41,603
and martyr martyr like and vengeful and 
malicious and manipulative and 

1974
01:55:47,250 --> 01:55:49,320
mendacious.
All of those states.

1975
01:55:49,321 --> 01:55:50,154
You want someone who can make their own 
judgements and you can ask kids what 

1976
01:55:55,771 --> 01:55:59,400
they think pretty damn early,
like you have to be careful and not push

1977
01:55:59,401 --> 01:56:01,470
them beyond their capacity,
but

1978
01:56:03,180 --> 01:56:04,013
if you know your child,
you will be able to see what level of 

1979
01:56:06,061 --> 01:56:11,061
decision making they're capable of 
engaging in and then you would encourage

1980
01:56:11,221 --> 01:56:15,210
them to mature as rapidly as they can.
You know,

1981
01:56:15,211 --> 01:56:16,044
and that also means that you have to not
allow yourself to fall too in love with 

1982
01:56:21,571 --> 01:56:22,404
a dependent and needy creature that your
infant will be to fulfill your own 

1983
01:56:28,021 --> 01:56:28,854
emotional needs.
You want to detach and encouraged to 

1984
01:56:32,191 --> 01:56:35,550
mature as rapidly and as comprehensively
as possible.

1985
01:56:35,670 --> 01:56:37,890
And that will work,
you know,

1986
01:56:38,130 --> 01:56:41,880
and some of that,
some of that is

1987
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:46,770
negotiation with your child and find out
what they think.

1988
01:56:46,920 --> 01:56:48,360
It's like,
what do you think about this?

1989
01:56:49,530 --> 01:56:51,660
What do you think about who should do 
the work in the house?

1990
01:56:51,661 --> 01:56:54,810
How should we split it up like they can 
be engaged in the decision making?

1991
01:56:54,811 --> 01:56:59,811
Process is a very early age and and part
of that,

1992
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:02,393
that encouragement is going to be 
reflected in your implicit attitudes 

1993
01:57:06,980 --> 01:57:11,980
that the child is a real person who's 
capable of imposing their will

1994
01:57:15,120 --> 01:57:15,953
in a realistic sense,
one in the world on the world and doing 

1995
01:57:19,621 --> 01:57:24,621
that in a competent and
excuse me,

1996
01:57:25,710 --> 01:57:30,710
competent and confident manner so,
but at least the beginning is the desire

1997
01:57:31,501 --> 01:57:35,010
to do that.
You want to raise them confident,

1998
01:57:35,640 --> 01:57:37,650
autonomous,
courageous,

1999
01:57:37,740 --> 01:57:38,573
truthful person,
and then you reward them when they're 

2000
01:57:41,551 --> 01:57:45,330
like that and you notice it and you tell
them good work.

2001
01:57:45,660 --> 01:57:46,493
You did that,
right?

2002
01:57:46,980 --> 01:57:47,813
Keep it up.

2003
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:50,880
That's the right thing.
And you tell them why.

2004
01:57:50,940 --> 01:57:53,130
What they did was right,
you know,

2005
01:57:53,131 --> 01:57:56,550
in a detailed way.
And that's very powerful.

2006
01:57:56,551 --> 01:57:59,730
You wait and you look and you wait for 
something that you want to have happened

2007
01:57:59,731 --> 01:58:00,690
and you say,
yes,

2008
01:58:00,740 --> 01:58:03,210
we'd like to see a lot more of that good
work.

2009
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:07,620
You do that with yourself and with your 
partner to very powerful technique.

2010
01:58:08,220 --> 01:58:11,430
All right everyone,
I'm going to say goodbye.

2011
01:58:12,060 --> 01:58:12,893
Um,
hopefully I'll do another one of these 

2012
01:58:14,431 --> 01:58:15,264
in February,
although I'm not certain maybe at the 

2013
01:58:18,390 --> 01:58:19,500
end of January I have a couple of days 
there,

2014
01:58:19,501 --> 01:58:23,820
but I'm going to Australia in February 
and that's going to be very busy.

2015
01:58:24,120 --> 01:58:26,340
So,
but maybe I can do I like doing this.

2016
01:58:26,341 --> 01:58:29,070
Maybe I can do another one in January 
near the end.

2017
01:58:29,420 --> 01:58:31,440
Um,
so,

2018
01:58:31,650 --> 01:58:34,350
uh,
just one last thing,

2019
01:58:34,650 --> 01:58:35,483
I just want to let everybody know,
remind everybody that I am leaving 

2020
01:58:38,090 --> 01:58:41,830
patrion on the 15th of January.
And so,

2021
01:58:41,831 --> 01:58:42,664
um,
thanks for your support over the last 

2022
01:58:47,050 --> 01:58:47,883
couple of years and,
um,

2023
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:49,713
hopefully,
hopefully my next book will be better 

2024
01:58:54,471 --> 01:58:55,304
than the last one was.
That's the plan that I'm doing my best 

2025
01:58:57,891 --> 01:58:58,724
to manage that and uh,
and hopefully we'll all have a good 

2026
01:59:04,860 --> 01:59:05,693
year,
you know,

2027
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:10,380
and aim high and all of that.
So good to see you.

2028
01:59:10,820 --> 01:59:11,653
Um,
and we'll talk in something 

2029
01:59:13,411 --> 01:59:14,520
approximating a month.

2030
01:59:16,070 --> 01:59:16,903
Bye Bye.
