1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,213
That we will explore today is in many 
ways what I'm trying to figure out some 

2
00:00:05,821 --> 00:00:09,510
of the deepest implications of what it 
means to be a human being.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,070
When we first formed the ocf worth our 
fellowship last year,

4
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:17,430
one of the discussion,
one of the very first discussions we had

5
00:00:17,431 --> 00:00:22,431
at our weekly meeting was one that dealt
with how we see ourselves today,

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,490
how we in our society and especially as 
students have lost something very sacred

7
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:32,670
about ourselves and many currents of 
thought annual.

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,990
Certainly in our hyper rationalized 
deconstructed postmodern world,

9
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,003
one loses sight of the meaning of not 
only those things which are external to 

10
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:43,710
us,
but in the process we fail to understand

11
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:44,544
the very core of Rv.
Many of you will know that recently Dr. 

12
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,580
Jordan Peterson has faced an amended set
of controversy precisely for questioning

13
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:54,414
the dogmas of our age and yet he has 
also stressed the importance of the 

14
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:03,000
divine individual and the Christian 
concept of the logos,

15
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,880
which I will allow our speakers to 
elaborate upon today.

16
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:11,650
A dear friend had told me once that one 
fundamentally divides orthodoxy from any

17
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:15,030
other kind of videology is precisely 
this,

18
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,073
the dignity of the divine individual and
what this means for us as spiritual and 

19
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:24,000
physical beings.
And so I'm immensely excited to be here.

20
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:25,620
One are timeless,
have to say the ninth.

21
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,203
And so I'd like to introduce each of our
panelists starting with Father Theodore 

22
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:31,194
across govopoly is uh,
who is adjunct faculty of the Orthodox 

23
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,940
School of theology at the Trinity 
College.

24
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,043
Uh,
last semester he taught a course on the 

25
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:42,150
human person in Orthodox theology and 
Orthodox tradition.

26
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,200
And in many ways it's something that 
touches upon orange,

27
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:48,810
reduces the very core of what's being 
discussed today,

28
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,990
what is the individual,
what does it mean to be human?

29
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:52,943
And he is also quite a positive presence
at our institution fellowship and we 

30
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:59,850
certainly look forward to hearing his 
perspective tonight.

31
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,473
Jonathon Hijo is a very well known icon 
carver from Quebec as well as an editor 

32
00:02:06,571 --> 00:02:07,404
for the Orthodox Arts Journal.
Many of us were familiar with the 

33
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:11,274
Jonathan and his work prior to this and 
so it was a great pleasure to have him 

34
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:17,280
here tonight and indeed it is entirely 
appropriate.

35
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,473
Just this past Sunday,
the Orthodox Church celebrated in the 

36
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:23,970
spirit of unity,
the Sunday of Orthodoxy,

37
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,080
the celebration of our triumph over 
iconoclasm.

38
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,643
The tradition of iconography in the 
orthodox tradition is one of the 

39
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:32,534
theology and I'm very pleased at an 
expert on the matter is with us here 

40
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:36,654
today and many of you may be interested 
to hear Jonathan's online discussion 

41
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,340
with Dr. Peters and uh,
the most recent one being concerned with

42
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:47,170
one of the most controversial political 
symbols of this day,

43
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,400
the metaphysics of Pepe,
Dr. Jordan B.

44
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,980
Peterson is a professor of psychology 
here at the University of Toronto.

45
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,023
And I think it goes without saying that 
the activism of Dr. Peterson has 

46
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:01,420
inspired many in the room today.

47
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,633
Manny,
who would have previously perhaps not 

48
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,683
even considered looking into the type of
concepts which are going to be 

49
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,073
discussing today.
Myself and many others have been deeply 

50
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:14,920
moved by not only Dr Peterson's insight 
on matters of a political nature,

51
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,993
but also in his insight in human nature.
The title of this discussion was 

52
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:21,544
influenced by Dr Peterson's usage of the
constant of the Christian concept of 

53
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,300
logos and what that means for us as 
individuals.

54
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:29,763
I'd like to thank Dr. Peters and for 
joining us and we are greatly looking 

55
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:34,300
forward to hearing more of your insight 
on this map.

56
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,180
Last but not least,
Father Jeffrey Ready,

57
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,420
who was a co director of the Orthodox 
School of theology.

58
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,543
Uh,
the chaplain of Orthodox Christian 

59
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,570
Fellowship and the parish priest at the 
holy mirror is Orthodox mission,

60
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,493
uh,
located at Trinity Chapel from the very 

61
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:52,980
creation of our ocs last year on the 
Jeff.

62
00:03:52,981 --> 00:03:53,814
He has continuously blown our minds and 
enhanced our understanding not only of 

63
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:01,330
our orthodox spiritual life,
but of ourselves as human beings.

64
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,110
Apart from his remarkable Pesaro 
qualities,

65
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,063
his wealth of knowledge and perspective 
has made it only natural that we would 

66
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:10,300
offer his perspective on this panel 
tonight.

67
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,970
I'd like to thank all the Jeffrey for 
his work and great league.

68
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,970
Look forward to hearing his perspectives
tonight.

69
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,703
So the format for the discussion today 
will be basically that each of our 

70
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:21,994
panelists will speak for for a time and 
this will be followed by a question and 

71
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:27,784
answer period.
Each of you will have received a few 

72
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,380
hard,
um,

73
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,660
and each row has about two ends.
So for the duration of the discussion,

74
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,720
you can write down your questions and 
pass them up at the front and then we'll

75
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:44,290
try to get through as many of as 
possible by the end of the night.

76
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:48,580
And with that,
I like to welcome Father Theodore Cross,

77
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,600
give off lists to the podium to begin 
our discussion.

78
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,483
Thank you.

79
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,720
[inaudible]

80
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,913
okay,
so there's not gonna be any mind 

81
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:05,250
blowing.
Okay.

82
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,403
That's reserved for Father Jeffrey.
Thank you to the ocf at uft for asking 

83
00:05:12,421 --> 00:05:13,254
me to come and to be up here on the 
stage with people that I kind of feel I 

84
00:05:16,111 --> 00:05:18,060
feel outclassed.
Definitely.

85
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:18,963
Let's,
um,

86
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,590
I appreciate the invitation.
Uh,

87
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,433
so I was told to speak for like 10 to 15
minutes about what it means to be a 

88
00:05:26,611 --> 00:05:30,480
human person in the orthodox tradition.
So I don't know how possible that is.

89
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,630
Um,
but live just mentioned that,

90
00:05:35,631 --> 00:05:36,840
uh,
in the past,

91
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,820
uh,
two days on Sunday,

92
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:41,040
we celebrated any of the Orthodox 
tradition,

93
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,380
the Sunday of Orthodoxy,
which is the first Sunday in lent.

94
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:44,843
Uh,
for those of you who don't know what 

95
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,400
that is or don't know,
we'll be celebrating that day,

96
00:05:47,401 --> 00:05:51,360
we celebrate the return of the holy 
icons into the church.

97
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,283
Now,
a lot of people who've been to Orthodox 

98
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:55,350
churches know that the church is full of
icons and they wonder,

99
00:05:55,351 --> 00:05:56,184
well,
when was there a turn and why was there 

100
00:05:57,651 --> 00:05:59,310
a return considering,
you know,

101
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,110
to be ever not have.

102
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,943
Though of course,
Christians have had images in their 

103
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,360
churches and in their places of worship 
from the very beginning.

104
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:07,810
But there was a time that,
um,

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,550
there was an impression of the idea of 
using images as a,

106
00:06:12,551 --> 00:06:15,080
and it was considered for the idolatry,
you from the church.

107
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,670
And there was a faction within the 
church that I'm a font against this.

108
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:23,360
And for almost a hundred years,
a icons were burned,

109
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:25,430
destroyed,
and taken out of churches.

110
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:27,530
And it was only with the seventh 
Ecumenical Council,

111
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,120
uh,
that they were returned.

112
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,253
Of course.
Why did we celebrate this on Sunday of 

113
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:32,750
Orthodoxy?
And what'd we call it,

114
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:37,010
Sunday of Orthodoxy is because those who
are the proponents of icons,

115
00:06:37,011 --> 00:06:42,011
and of course all modern Orthodox 
Christians today knew that the attack on

116
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,590
the depiction of Christ was an attack on
the incarnation itself.

117
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,953
Um,
the idea that Christ is an actual mean 

118
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,700
actually existed actually live and 
lives.

119
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,860
He was an actual historical figure who 
live at a certain time and not a figment

120
00:06:57,861 --> 00:07:00,590
of our imagination as some people today 
would say.

121
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:06,070
And this means that when we speak about 
God and when we speak about the trinity,

122
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:08,480
when you speak about the second person 
of the Trinity,

123
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,300
who is the son,
the locals,

124
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,230
um,
as we were speaking about tonight,

125
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:13,443
uh,
we are speaking about a very specific 

126
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:16,460
person.
And,

127
00:07:16,461 --> 00:07:17,294
uh,
that is in contrast to many of the 

128
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:25,091
discussions that we see today,
both in the Public Forum online,

129
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,200
uh,
that's symposia like this,

130
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:27,980
uh,
where we,

131
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,813
where many people would like to think of
God as an abstract for Orthodox 

132
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:33,650
Christians.
And I would say for,

133
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,870
you know,
historical ancient Christianity,

134
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,950
God is not an aspect that either God is 
an actual person,

135
00:07:39,951 --> 00:07:43,790
there's an objective reality,
their prices and objective person,

136
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,640
he thinks a certain way,
speaks a certain way,

137
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,070
act a certain way,
even looked a certain way,

138
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,140
and so we can depict an,
an icon.

139
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,050
Now,
the reason why I started with this and I

140
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:55,310
kind of,
you know,

141
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,090
uh,
begin,

142
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:56,923
uh,
my thoughts is a because there is a 

143
00:08:00,531 --> 00:08:05,510
little bit of a contrast between many 
religions and orthodoxy.

144
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:06,920
Uh,
this is not,

145
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:07,754
this is a generalization,
but as generalizations go in many 

146
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:13,520
religions,
whether they be Christian or not,

147
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,150
um,
the concept of God or the concept of the

148
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:22,151
divine usually centers around the idea 
of the word of God.

149
00:08:22,281 --> 00:08:23,114
When the concept of God made text,
and there are usually writings about 

150
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,600
this and writings that are usually very 
ancient,

151
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:30,434
they're passed down.
And the text is usually what is focused 

152
00:08:33,531 --> 00:08:35,540
on even amongst many Christian 
denominations,

153
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,240
it's all about the text.
However,

154
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,050
in the orthodox tradition,
it is not about the word defending text,

155
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,450
but rather about the word becoming 
flesh.

156
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,493
I mean human being.
And so our faith is not based on a text 

157
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:54,100
of rather on a deep mystical experience 
of the risen Lord throughout time.

158
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,921
Are you going to say,
well,

159
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:57,120
we read the Bible too,
right?

160
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,400
We use the Bible,
we venerate the Bible.

161
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:01,950
We have it in very high regard.
However,

162
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,870
for ancient Christianity,
I love that cause I like star trek too.

163
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,690
Um,
um,

164
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,120
when we,
uh,

165
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,420
when we speak about Christ and you speak
about God,

166
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:22,310
we speak about a living tradition,
Christ and found a bull.

167
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,993
Neither did he found the philosophy,
but rather he found it a very real 

168
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:27,930
community,
a living community.

169
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,423
And the Orthodox Church,
the last 2000 years is this living 

170
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:36,180
community that has never stopped with,
has never ceased to exist.

171
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,400
It was never a time where he did not 
exist.

172
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,010
Um,
we have no beginning.

173
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:43,830
We have no reformer,
we have no sounder.

174
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,510
Uh,
we have no school of thoughts,

175
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,110
but rather a,
we exist from the very beginning.

176
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,973
So the reason why I say this is because 
our concept of God and our concept of 

177
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:57,150
our relationship to him is a very 
intimate one.

178
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,570
And one that is in living for the last 
2000 years.

179
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:02,400
So,

180
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,623
okay,

181
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,170
going back to the idea of an 
incarnational theology and have icons,

182
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,710
uh,
if we are just saying that God is real,

183
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,283
he actually exists.
If we don't believe in that more than 

184
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:17,803
this talk doesn't really matter.
But if we believe that God exists and 

185
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:20,784
that God is an actual person is a mine,
his personality and that is Christ is 

186
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:29,130
God in human form,
then uh,

187
00:10:29,131 --> 00:10:34,131
the reality is is that there is an 
objective reality to who god is.

188
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,343
And by that we can say that there's an 
objective truth that'd be can speak 

189
00:10:40,651 --> 00:10:41,484
about.
And there is an objective good that we 

190
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:44,634
can speak about.
And there is an objective understanding 

191
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:47,783
of the human being.
It is not subjective but rather 

192
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,870
objective.
And for us as Orthodox Christians,

193
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:59,000
we tend to follow the model that was 
coined by seeing nothing else.

194
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,830
The grades,
same as fourth century father,

195
00:11:01,831 --> 00:11:02,664
the church,
every theologian who said that God 

196
00:11:04,441 --> 00:11:08,640
became man so that we may become God,
not that we need to come,

197
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,850
you'll God's like gone.

198
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,393
So for us,
the goal of the Christian life is to 

199
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:13,920
emulate,
right?

200
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:17,850
It's to become Christ light.
It's not about what I think of myself as

201
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:18,684
a lot about why I want to be or what 
would I would like to create in my mind 

202
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,300
what I would like to be or what I think 
I am,

203
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,570
but rather that there is Christ and 
Christ is the perfect human being.

204
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,613
And I tried to discover what that is and
I know that is diametrically opposed to 

205
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,110
the society that we live in today.
For the most part,

206
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,183
for the most part,
that we live in a society that is a 

207
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:43,020
society of subjectivity,
not object.

208
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,040
And we live in a society that when he 
speaks about religion,

209
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,730
speaks about spirituality in a speech 
about,

210
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,573
speaks about theology.
It usually refers to the subjective 

211
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:55,084
understanding of God,
the subjective understanding of the 

212
00:11:57,101 --> 00:12:02,101
human person as Professor Peterson has 
in the last few months.

213
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,240
Um,
so when we talk about human identity,

214
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,733
it is,
um,

215
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,573
it is something that is to be discovered
and not to be kind of created or self 

216
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,300
created.
So,

217
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:18,821
you know,
there's a,

218
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:22,630
there's a writing at a very early second
century writing in the church called the

219
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,920
heat,
which means the teaching,

220
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,513
uh,
one of the earliest writings of the 

221
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:29,710
church I guess we could say is one of 
the earliest manuals,

222
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,780
um,
uh,

223
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,790
of how to be a Christian or the basics 
of the Christian faith,

224
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:36,220
I guess you could say.
And in the that he,

225
00:12:36,221 --> 00:12:39,730
it says the first line says there are 
two ways,

226
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,223
um,
one of life I want to death and there's 

227
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:48,370
a great difference between the two is 
the opening lines and a,

228
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:51,760
and really when it comes to,
you know,

229
00:12:51,761 --> 00:12:52,594
the,
uh,

230
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,290
the understanding of the human person 
from Orthodox point of view,

231
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,000
we would say the same thing.

232
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,030
That there are really two ways to 
understand.

233
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,313
There is either the revelation from God 
and how we emulate that or rather 

234
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:11,800
there's the movement towards the south 
towards self revelation,

235
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:13,780
self understanding.
And really,

236
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,580
uh,
we would say,

237
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,330
um,
self idealization and uh,

238
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:24,331
and soul of course we as human beings 
are free to do whatever we wanted to do.

239
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,180
Um,
and we have free will.

240
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,890
But how we use that and what we're,
what do you do with it?

241
00:13:32,891 --> 00:13:33,724
And what you choose to become really 
depends on where we're looking for 

242
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:39,910
words,
what do we want it to do and then,

243
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,420
and who we want to be.
So I would say that the,

244
00:13:43,421 --> 00:13:44,254
the modern existential crisis of our 
time can really be remedied by the 

245
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:54,670
simple statement that if there is a god,
there's a God,

246
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,350
I'm not him.
So the understanding of that,

247
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,233
if there's a god and I'm not,
that him would mean that I need to 

248
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,630
discover who that God is and what he 
expects of me.

249
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,850
Why am I here and what am I supposed to 
do with my life?

250
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,313
And that's diametrically opposed to the 
subjective understanding of that God is 

251
00:14:16,031 --> 00:14:21,031
whatever I wanted to do or what I would 
rather him eat and go from there.

252
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:27,290
So in pre modern Western civilization,
um,

253
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
society was predominantly,
you know,

254
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,100
society of these kinds of values.
It's kind of objective truths.

255
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,500
Uh,
it was kind of like the social glue that

256
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:39,490
provided stability for the family and 
social institutions and religion and,

257
00:14:39,491 --> 00:14:41,140
uh,
and even business ethics.

258
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:43,150
Like people believe that there was a 
good,

259
00:14:43,151 --> 00:14:45,760
there was a truth out there that we need
to discovered.

260
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:50,110
There was a god that we needed to 
somehow figure out who that God was.

261
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,363
Um,
and the humility that was required to 

262
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:57,830
set that we are not gods,
uh,

263
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,693
was what held all that together and the 
social and psychological fabric of 

264
00:15:01,281 --> 00:15:02,114
society.

265
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,410
So without it,
and this is where I think,

266
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:07,244
um,
as a peterson would also agree in has 

267
00:15:08,801 --> 00:15:13,250
said many times without this kind of a 
understanding of an objective reality,

268
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,150
um,
there is an endless movement towards the

269
00:15:17,151 --> 00:15:18,850
individuals word,
subjectivities,

270
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,693
tours,
what is relative and ultimately towards 

271
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:25,850
nihilism.
Because if there is no objective meaning

272
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:27,800
in life and there's no objective truth 
in life,

273
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:31,880
then everything is whatever I made it 
and everybody has right?

274
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:32,714
And really everybody is wrong.
And then really what you have to listen 

275
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,760
for.
So real ultimate meaning life.

276
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,450
And so this is the problem,
you know,

277
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:45,050
and then there's a movement towards the 
delusion that everyone has their own God

278
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:47,780
and everyone is free to create 
themselves in their own image.

279
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,530
And this breeds and this fragmentation 
as professor [inaudible] said,

280
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,743
a volt,
socal individual truths and also 

281
00:15:54,171 --> 00:15:56,840
individual identities.
So

282
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,190
if there is no god,
as we said,

283
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,540
this conversation doesn't really matter.

284
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,823
However,
if there is a god and he has a personal 

285
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:05,834
God as a Christian his claim,
then we cannot go on ignoring him 

286
00:16:08,961 --> 00:16:11,540
without suffering a serious identity 
crisis.

287
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,823
I believe that this crisis has arrived.
And the question is how do we as 

288
00:16:15,381 --> 00:16:19,430
Christians continued to see the world,
see the word of God,

289
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,880
the divine logos in those who refuse to 
see it in themselves?

290
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:23,714
Like how do we speak to that?
How do we speak to a world that doesn't 

291
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:31,420
even
acknowledge that there is such a locals?

292
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,980
But there is such a truth in the first 
place.

293
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,413
This is,
this is the conundrum that we find 

294
00:16:36,951 --> 00:16:40,790
ourselves in the difficulty.
How do we witness to a world that is not

295
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,640
speaking the same language anymore?
And I think that is uh,

296
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:45,170
something that,
uh,

297
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,450
you know,
discussions like this are,

298
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,990
are super important and attend the first
steps.

299
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,990
Because here we are attempting and I,
and I applaud the ocf for doing this,

300
00:16:56,901 --> 00:17:01,901
attempting to find points of convergence
between a Christian tradition,

301
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,770
Orthodox Christian tradition and also 
um,

302
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,100
the secular approach,
psychology,

303
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,860
sociology,
history,

304
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,233
biology,
places where these things converge and 

305
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:19,490
they'd tell us and they preach the same 
truth.

306
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:20,893
And this is why I was so enthused about 
coming and speaking today because 

307
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:28,650
watching a lot of Festo Peterson's,
uh,

308
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,250
uh,
videos online,

309
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,093
I saw that there are a lot of points 
that he makes that not only are 

310
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,490
congruent with Orthodox theology and 
Orthodox anthropology,

311
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,520
but speak common sense to the world in a
world that is completely fragmented,

312
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,693
a world that is completely disengaged 
from the idea that there can be a truth 

313
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:53,810
outside of ourselves and that there 
needs to be some type of seeking,

314
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,390
some type of understanding of what that 
truth may be.

315
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,853
The main difference between philosophy 
and theology I always tell my students 

316
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:04,140
is,
is that philosophy comes from us.

317
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:07,890
It is us trying to understand the world,
trying to understand the metaphysical,

318
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,600
try,
understand glaad punters stand,

319
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:11,150
anything you can philosophize about 
anyway,

320
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,373
but the source of the human being,
we have this wonderful thing called the 

321
00:18:15,031 --> 00:18:18,780
mind is so powerful.
They can do so many things,

322
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,740
but that's philosophy.
Theology heals with a revelation.

323
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,173
He was with what has been revealed from 
outside the community of someone else 

324
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:28,943
and that's what,
that's what the church has to deal with 

325
00:18:29,971 --> 00:18:31,280
it.
That's what the Christian,

326
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,460
what does Shanti has to deal with the 
idea of what God has revealed in himself

327
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,160
by becoming a real movie,
becoming one of us have.

328
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,003
We can't negate that as much as we try 
and to do so would mean to negate an 

329
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,223
important part of ourselves because we 
believe as tuition is like the say all 

330
00:18:48,371 --> 00:18:49,204
the time and as would like to quote 
genesis where God says in the very 

331
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:53,634
beginning,
genesis one 26 God makes man in his 

332
00:18:56,851 --> 00:18:58,710
image and his likeness.

333
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,203
He gives us this great ability to shoots
great of his ability to reason and to 

334
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:09,711
figure things out for ourselves and to 
decide whether we want to be like him or

335
00:19:10,141 --> 00:19:13,170
whether we want to be more like 
something else.

336
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,070
So this is the great dilemma.
It's not just a theological dilemma,

337
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,880
it's not just a spiritual dilemma,
but it's an existential dilemma and it's

338
00:19:20,881 --> 00:19:21,714
becoming social dilemma.
You tell me a political dilemma I 

339
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:28,800
biological dilemma and a whole lot of 
other climbers.

340
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,820
So I will end there.
Um,

341
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,130
I will let a folly Jonathan take it from
here,

342
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,203
but I think this is a general 
introduction to at least the way we see 

343
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:39,444
it as Orthodox Christians,
that God becomes man so that man can 

344
00:19:42,161 --> 00:19:44,880
become God.
The words of the Apostle Paul,

345
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,590
there's lot I who live but Christ who 
lives within.

346
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,260
And this is our,
our ultimate hope.

347
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,333
Thank you very much.

348
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:55,710
[inaudible]

349
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,740
did.
Thanks cory.

350
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,070
Appreciate it.
I appreciate being here.

351
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:18,180
I appreciate it.
Being in Toronto,

352
00:20:18,181 --> 00:20:19,014
it's a great town.
Today I spent the day going to the 

353
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:25,080
museum and visiting,
so I really enjoying the city.

354
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,440
I'm going to start with this story.
Um,

355
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,250
it's March,
2015 and uh,

356
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,373
I'm driving good to pick up my children 
at some friend's house on Friday night 

357
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:38,963
and it's about half an hour drive.
So I'm settling in and I'm listening to 

358
00:20:41,071 --> 00:20:45,990
the CBC like I usually do.
Would that particular evening,

359
00:20:45,991 --> 00:20:49,690
the content is not usually what you get 
on the CDC.

360
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:55,000
So on the air,
this University of Toronto professor and

361
00:20:55,001 --> 00:20:58,780
what are you saying rings a bit off from
what I usually hear on that show.

362
00:20:59,100 --> 00:20:59,933
And at first he's talking about religion
and religious symbolism and he's doing 

363
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:04,924
it in a way,
let's say he's doing it without the 

364
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:10,360
usual smugness that we tend to hear when
people talk about religion,

365
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,223
especially about Christianity.
And so here he is talking about 

366
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:17,460
Christianity,
but I can tell he's not,

367
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,810
you're not a priest,
he's not a preacher,

368
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:22,060
he's a psychologist,
he's a scientist.

369
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,640
And so as a talk on folds my,
let's say my attention heightens,

370
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,910
and after a few minutes,
just a few minutes,

371
00:21:30,911 --> 00:21:35,080
I just,
I can't believe what I'm hearing as this

372
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:37,570
profits is going to stories of Adam and 
Eve,

373
00:21:37,571 --> 00:21:38,404
Cain and Abel jumping to Shakespeare and
Milton and Jerky and then to Darwin and 

374
00:21:43,361 --> 00:21:47,290
Nietzsche and you'll and,
and immediately I see what he's doing.

375
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,673
He has,
I'm just trying to communicate 

376
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:55,980
information.
He's dancing across this wide variety of

377
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:00,730
references because what's wants to do is
he wants to bring out,

378
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,480
he wants to trace this underlying 
pattern

379
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:11,060
and by doing so he's trying to awaken 
something in his listeners.

380
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,430
He's not just trying to get them to 
understand,

381
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:16,400
which is what we usually hear when we 
listened to talks.

382
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:17,820
No,
he's trying to provoke,

383
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:22,850
like to shake people into experiencing 
how the world is built with meaning.

384
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,063
Okay.

385
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,770
So he talks about logos,
which is true,

386
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:35,830
meaning express in words.
This search for purpose and logos,

387
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:40,640
transforms,
transforms chaos and potentiality and to

388
00:22:40,641 --> 00:22:45,641
being and in opposition to this lies,
deceit,

389
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:50,350
resentment,
gradually dismantle the world and plunge

390
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:54,260
it into ever-growing chaos.
I mean,

391
00:22:54,261 --> 00:22:55,940
of course he's taking this from the 
Bible,

392
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,253
the Book of Genesis from the Gospel of 
Saint John Sprinkled with some 

393
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,303
phenomenology,
but he's very clearly describing this 

394
00:23:05,971 --> 00:23:10,971
process at all levels of reality
at the individual.

395
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,683
The interpersonal is social,
political levels and this interaction 

396
00:23:17,831 --> 00:23:18,664
between logos and chaos is the main 
manner we could say by which the world 

397
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:25,390
is constantly sustained.

398
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,100
So by this point,
I am,

399
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:32,920
I literally cheering in the car.
I'm like,

400
00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:37,921
I'm hitting my steering wheel.
And all I can think is who is this?

401
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,970
Who is this person talking and why have 
I not heard of him before?

402
00:23:42,971 --> 00:23:43,804
Like why is he not famous?
I guess we don't ask that question 

403
00:23:46,311 --> 00:23:47,144
anymore.
Right?

404
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:52,550
And especially I'm like,
how does he know this?

405
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,073
You see like,
so the attempt to help people see 

406
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:59,240
experience patterns of meaning and 
religious symbol is,

407
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:01,550
or how it connects to all levels of 
reality.

408
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:03,310
That's what I've been trying to do for 
years.

409
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,810
That's,
that's been my goal in life.

410
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,720
I would say in my carvings and my 
articles and my talks,

411
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,400
no,
10,

412
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,910
there's only a handful of people that I 
know that I can relate to at that level.

413
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,120
Okay.

414
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:16,953
And,
and it's not that people don't talk 

415
00:24:17,411 --> 00:24:19,990
about religious symbolism actually,
a lot of people do,

416
00:24:19,991 --> 00:24:24,040
but usually when you hear people talk 
about religious symbolism,

417
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:29,020
at some point you can kind of picture 
them in like a tin foil hats and then,

418
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:29,913
you know,
they,

419
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,040
they soon extra terrestrials become part
of the,

420
00:24:33,041 --> 00:24:34,560
of the discussion.
Um,

421
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,800
but not this guy,
he's just as clear as can be.

422
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,053
So when I get home,
so I reach out to him and I send them 

423
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,880
just a little message.
Uh,

424
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:48,783
you know,
just thanking him and expressing my 

425
00:24:50,411 --> 00:24:53,560
surprise and linking into a few 
articles.

426
00:24:53,561 --> 00:24:55,870
I'd written a few talks I've given,
you know,

427
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:57,130
that was it.
I didn't expect,

428
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:01,810
I didn't really expect an answer,
but then the next morning I get,

429
00:25:01,811 --> 00:25:06,811
I get a message thanking me for my 
message and pointing me to a few lecture

430
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:09,550
that he had given more specifically on 
religion.

431
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:10,750
I thought that's pretty cool.
Like,

432
00:25:10,751 --> 00:25:12,220
that's,
that's nice.

433
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:16,420
This was random crew,
Becker's sending messages to him.

434
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,673
Um,
but then about about an hour and a half 

435
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,490
later,
I get this call

436
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:25,570
and I can't do that.
I can't do the criminal voice.

437
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:33,040
So anyways,
my memories,

438
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,470
my memories of that moment are kind of 
vague,

439
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,830
but I think I probably acted like a 14 
year old meeting,

440
00:25:38,831 --> 00:25:43,831
Kanye West or something.
And now his tone is one of surprise.

441
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:47,710
Maybe a bit of confusion.
And his basic question and,

442
00:25:47,711 --> 00:25:51,460
and he's been asking me this question 
ever since is how do you know this?

443
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,073
Because they listened to my talk and he 
saw the relationship between what I was 

444
00:25:57,801 --> 00:26:00,860
saying and what he was saying and the 
talk.

445
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,933
That's exactly,
I had been talking about how logos 

446
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:09,010
organizes potential into experience been
it's a,

447
00:26:09,261 --> 00:26:10,880
why am I,
why am I telling you this?

448
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,310
I mean,
first of all,

449
00:26:13,311 --> 00:26:16,160
I'm telling you this as an excuse 
because despite with father,

450
00:26:16,161 --> 00:26:16,994
Ted said,
here's this carver who standing on one 

451
00:26:19,641 --> 00:26:20,474
theologian.
Then professors though the reason why 

452
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:29,230
I'm here is because since then professor
Peterson and I have developed this,

453
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,610
this relationship.
Some of you might've seen the interviews

454
00:26:31,611 --> 00:26:32,930
that we did together.

455
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,173
MMM.

456
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,910
But mostly I'm telling you this because 
I know,

457
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,793
I know that it nears the story of so 
many people that are probably here in 

458
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:44,720
this room and,
and,

459
00:26:44,721 --> 00:26:47,450
and a lot of the people that might hear 
his,

460
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,570
uh,
on Youtube,

461
00:26:48,571 --> 00:26:52,800
we're in the podcast.
I know that it years.

462
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:58,010
And I know because dozens of people have
told me of that experience,

463
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,570
you know,
I have this image,

464
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:02,463
I don't know if people have seen it,
of Joe Rogan hearing Dr. Peterson talk 

465
00:27:05,381 --> 00:27:09,220
for the first time and his jaw dropping,
you know,

466
00:27:09,221 --> 00:27:13,600
and all of a sudden he sees religion in 
a completely different way.

467
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,570
And I've even received dozens of message
from,

468
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:20,560
I would call them in process atheists 
who say,

469
00:27:20,561 --> 00:27:22,900
you know,
Mike questions.

470
00:27:22,901 --> 00:27:27,790
And my thinking had been tilted slightly
in unexpected ways.

471
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,263
And that experience I think has been 
strongest for Orthodox Christians like 

472
00:27:33,571 --> 00:27:35,340
myself.
In fact,

473
00:27:35,341 --> 00:27:36,174
I stopped counting the number of 
messages I received from priests asking 

474
00:27:40,531 --> 00:27:41,630
me soap.
It says,

475
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,420
Dr. Peterson Orthodox or what?
And to which I usually answer,

476
00:27:45,421 --> 00:27:47,160
no,
he just likes dusty Fgli.

477
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:52,060
And there was even one clergy,
clergy men who who,

478
00:27:52,061 --> 00:27:54,530
who answered to that said,
Oh yeah,

479
00:27:54,531 --> 00:27:56,180
he's Orthodox.
He just doesn't know it yet.

480
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,830
With this correlation has been 
persistent.

481
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,043
So what is this connection?
What made the connection between a 

482
00:28:09,041 --> 00:28:12,850
traditional Christian like myself and 
Dr. Peterson?

483
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:15,280
So obvious,
so immediate,

484
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:19,720
and all of this I believes resolves 
around the notion of logos.

485
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,640
Okay.

486
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,360
The language of logos is the underlying 
language of Christianity.

487
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,860
Of course,
we know the,

488
00:28:28,861 --> 00:28:29,281
the,
the,

489
00:28:29,281 --> 00:28:30,114
the first vision of logos in 
Christianity comes from the gospel of 

490
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:36,010
Saint John.
In the beginning was the logos.

491
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:39,310
The logos was with God and the logos was
God.

492
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,660
He was in the beginning with God and 
through him all things were made without

493
00:28:43,661 --> 00:28:44,494
him.
Nothing was made that has been made in 

494
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:50,320
him was life and that life was the light
of all mankind.

495
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:55,600
The light shines in the darkness and the
darkness has not overcome it.

496
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,513
And this vision of logos would be 
continued and developed in the life of 

497
00:29:02,571 --> 00:29:07,571
the church.
And especially in the seventh century.

498
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,620
There was a saint,
his name is Saint Maximus,

499
00:29:10,621 --> 00:29:11,454
the confessor.
And he really brought this image of 

500
00:29:14,371 --> 00:29:19,371
logos I would say to it's most detailed 
or most elaborate vision.

501
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,503
And he did so by taking uh,
the notion of logos that was in the new 

502
00:29:27,291 --> 00:29:28,124
testament and he,
he brought and united it with the best 

503
00:29:31,461 --> 00:29:33,950
of what the western tradition had 
already offered,

504
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,253
who was able to prune,
let's say what had come from philosophy 

505
00:29:37,561 --> 00:29:40,850
and and join it with what the Christian 
message was.

506
00:29:40,851 --> 00:29:44,590
So it would attain some clarity and 
maybe some detail.

507
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:53,930
And so saint maximus explains that all 
things have a logos which are,

508
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,183
which is its reason for existence,
its purpose and its origin all at once 

509
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,230
and even its end.
So it's all those things at once.

510
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:09,320
And on top of that,
each thing has a multitude of low g,

511
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,360
that's a word we would probably never 
heard before.

512
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,840
The is the plural of logos.
And so the,

513
00:30:14,841 --> 00:30:16,190
the,
the low being there,

514
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:17,024
like the different qualities of things.
So the blueness of the blue or the 

515
00:30:22,371 --> 00:30:27,371
slowness of the slow and all of these 
logies are brought together.

516
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:32,660
They're woven together,
we could say to sustain the existence of

517
00:30:32,661 --> 00:30:33,494
the world.
It's really a map of meaning to use 

518
00:30:37,911 --> 00:30:41,130
Jordan's words.
Now these logo,

519
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,940
he's essences let's say,
or things,

520
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:49,400
they don't exist independently.
In the same way that scientists,

521
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:52,340
they leave things exist out there.
Uh,

522
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,263
rather they exist as they come together,
as they're joined together in our 

523
00:30:57,921 --> 00:31:00,800
encounter with the world.
And a pattern we could say,

524
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,080
okay,

525
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,510
so we could say for example,
like had a sunset,

526
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,373
has a certain amount of low view,
maybe even an indefinite amount of 

527
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:13,523
characteristics of a sunset.
But as they come together to be the 

528
00:31:18,121 --> 00:31:21,990
experience of this sunset,
that's how we experience reality.

529
00:31:21,991 --> 00:31:24,810
That's how we come into contact with 
reality.

530
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,370
So all these qualities,
it's a light color,

531
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:34,900
vertical,
horizontal,

532
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,071
and the things,
the,

533
00:31:36,071 --> 00:31:37,480
the sun,
the sky,

534
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:39,460
the earth,
all of these things.

535
00:31:39,461 --> 00:31:41,680
And I could go on,
there's an indefinite amount of them.

536
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,573
What's important and making that 
experience real is how all those logos 

537
00:31:45,761 --> 00:31:46,840
are united.

538
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:50,743
So,

539
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,880
and in a way they're,
they're united within us.

540
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,003
And human beings for Saint Maximus are 
seen as this laboratory where the whole 

541
00:32:00,331 --> 00:32:05,331
world finds its cohesion and he 
expresses it in the sense that the human

542
00:32:06,061 --> 00:32:06,894
being is a microcosm,
if you could say a condensation of the 

543
00:32:11,861 --> 00:32:12,694
cosmos,
the place where the cosmos comes 

544
00:32:15,661 --> 00:32:20,661
together to make sense
in a good way to see it is,

545
00:32:20,871 --> 00:32:25,400
is that human beings actually 
participate being in the image of God,

546
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:29,600
they participate in creation.
We see that in the book of Genesis,

547
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:33,740
the book of Genesis.
God tells Adam to name the animals.

548
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:39,110
And so by his logos participating in a 
limited way,

549
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,820
in the same manner that the divine logos
was the source of everything.

550
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:53,760
And the human participation in this 
process is not a relativistic thing.

551
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,010
Uh,
it's not an individual thing.

552
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:58,203
I mean though it is flexible.
It's nonetheless the most objective of 

553
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:01,444
processes as father Ted mentioned.
And so we need to be cautious though 

554
00:33:06,571 --> 00:33:11,571
because Saint Maximus warns us that it's
not just a philosophy or it's not just a

555
00:33:11,611 --> 00:33:13,530
technical description of the world.

556
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,170
MMM.

557
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,003
This is important because thinking that 
religious stories are exactly the same 

558
00:33:19,801 --> 00:33:20,634
kind of encyclopedic knowledge of modern
science is the wrong way to go with 

559
00:33:25,561 --> 00:33:27,060
this.
These logos,

560
00:33:27,061 --> 00:33:32,061
these truth of most things are,
or categories of our engagement with the

561
00:33:32,551 --> 00:33:33,384
world.
So maybe today we might call them 

562
00:33:34,951 --> 00:33:37,680
phenomena,
fifth phenomenological categories.

563
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,333
Okay.

564
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:42,570
So the discovery of truth of logos,
it's a personal journey.

565
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:44,723
It's similar.
Tang is Lee or refinement of our 

566
00:33:46,471 --> 00:33:47,304
understanding of the world.
But at the same time he becomes a 

567
00:33:49,141 --> 00:33:54,141
refinement of our person.
So to discover the true nature of things

568
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,333
is to walk on a path of truth.
So food is a wonderful thing and it's 

569
00:34:01,771 --> 00:34:02,604
useful for life.
But gluttony leads to our destruction 

570
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:09,360
well is useful to accomplish important 
things,

571
00:34:09,361 --> 00:34:11,820
but avarice Ross the soul.
So you see,

572
00:34:11,821 --> 00:34:13,530
it's not just a description of the 
world,

573
00:34:13,531 --> 00:34:16,740
it's a path that we walk as we 
discovered with world.

574
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:23,110
And so sin in this vision of the world,
that horrible world,

575
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:25,700
that horrible word that no one wants to 
hear sin.

576
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:26,870
Okay?

577
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:29,250
Is it just the breaking of arbitrary 
rules,

578
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,460
but it,
it's in the misuse of the world.

579
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:39,250
And that misuse of the world ends up 
being an untruth,

580
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,390
ends up being a lie or,
or,

581
00:34:41,391 --> 00:34:42,224
or something that's false.
Something that separates things from 

582
00:34:45,071 --> 00:34:45,904
each other.
It's found when things are not aligned 

583
00:34:49,271 --> 00:34:52,510
with their purposes.
So for example,

584
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,070
a person,

585
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,423
uh,

586
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:56,883
it's not only a tool for my own 
gratification person is not just a tool 

587
00:35:02,171 --> 00:35:04,510
so that it can advance myself in the 
world.

588
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:07,570
And if I treat a person exclusively like
that,

589
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:11,140
then I will inevitably sin against that 
person.

590
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:12,991
I mean,
of course,

591
00:35:12,991 --> 00:35:16,920
it doesn't mean that a person cannot act
as it's cool for my gratification.

592
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:20,730
If I go see the baker and I get bread 
from him,

593
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:26,150
he's the method by which I get my bread.
But the baker is not just a baker.

594
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:29,330
He,
he is a full person just as myself.

595
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:33,440
So when we steal or we lie or we cheat 
if he,

596
00:35:33,441 --> 00:35:34,274
cause we're not considering that the 
person facing us to be a full blown 

597
00:35:37,891 --> 00:35:38,724
person,
to be what they are according to their 

598
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:44,610
logos,
where we see them only as limited things

599
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,840
only as tools.

600
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:52,520
So this is true of people of things and 
of actions.

601
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:54,463
So I was thinking about,
I was trying to think about the best 

602
00:35:56,811 --> 00:36:00,220
example that I could think of to,
to show this in terms of action and,

603
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,730
and,
and uh,

604
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:05,120
I thought of giving the example of,
of sex.

605
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,673
So we did the metaphysics of peppa.
And so I think we can get away with the 

606
00:36:09,051 --> 00:36:10,400
metaphysics of sex,
I hope.

607
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,633
But it's a question that desperately 
needs to be answered today in our topsy 

608
00:36:16,191 --> 00:36:17,450
turvy times,
let's say.

609
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,770
So what is the logos of sexuality?
Well,

610
00:36:21,771 --> 00:36:24,920
it has many Loci,
many purposes.

611
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,800
It's for the propagation of the species.
I hope at least a few of you still think

612
00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:35,450
that despite what many people would want
us to believe,

613
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:37,980
it's

614
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,813
creates families and communities.
It brings two people together and that 

615
00:36:43,321 --> 00:36:48,321
type of communion in an expression of 
love and it brings pleasure

616
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:52,080
those.
So those will be,

617
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:55,440
would be some of the Lobi I'm sure we 
could find more that some,

618
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,303
those are the,
some of the Loci that sex exists and 

619
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:01,740
there could be more.
But yeah,

620
00:37:01,741 --> 00:37:06,741
idea in division of logos is that all 
those things need to be brought together

621
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:11,340
in a pattern of some sort for them to be
a path towards logos.

622
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,610
Okay,

623
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:18,080
so if we think of the different logo and
we bring them together,

624
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,130
trying to think of the word,
what does that word when we,

625
00:37:22,131 --> 00:37:22,964
all those things are together,
I think we have a word with a sacrament 

626
00:37:24,591 --> 00:37:27,890
of the church.
I'll let you figure it out.

627
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,960
What it is.
When all those things come together,

628
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:34,980
and so each of the separate purposes of 
sex that I mentioned,

629
00:37:34,981 --> 00:37:37,080
they're not wrong,
they're fine,

630
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,920
but they do come alive when we bring 
them together.

631
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,373
If we don't,
then each separate purpose appears as a 

632
00:37:46,171 --> 00:37:49,770
kind of false hood.
It appears as a kind of lacking.

633
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,353
That's not enough.
Let's say for a truly traditional or a 

634
00:37:55,621 --> 00:37:59,940
truly complete vision of sexuality,
it cannot end.

635
00:37:59,941 --> 00:38:04,941
There has to move towards he infinite.
It has to move towards God.

636
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,493
And so the ultimate logos of sexuality 
is to be an image of the mystical union 

637
00:38:12,091 --> 00:38:14,940
with God.
I mean it's to be an image of our union.

638
00:38:14,941 --> 00:38:17,700
With that,
with what is beyond us.

639
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,353
I mean,
and that image of the Mystical Union of 

640
00:38:25,571 --> 00:38:29,890
God with the Soul,
with cross of Christ,

641
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:30,724
with his church,
the marriage of heaven and earth is a 

642
00:38:33,761 --> 00:38:37,060
completely traditional image we find in,
in the church.

643
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:38,740
Fathers are in our tradition.

644
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:40,300
Okay.

645
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:43,330
And so that,
that image of the ultimate union,

646
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:46,270
the highest union with the infinite,

647
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:47,780
okay,

648
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:52,180
then it comes back down into the 
multiple lobe.

649
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:56,620
All those other reasons for sexuality 
that I mentioned and it feels dumb.

650
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:02,000
It makes them participate in the 
transcendent purpose and become the very

651
00:39:02,001 --> 00:39:02,834
relationship that binds them together.
And everything in our life can follow 

652
00:39:06,861 --> 00:39:08,300
that process.
Work,

653
00:39:08,301 --> 00:39:09,650
food,
sleep,

654
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:10,723
ut.
And to engage the world in that frame 

655
00:39:16,011 --> 00:39:18,620
is,
is to find light everywhere.

656
00:39:18,621 --> 00:39:23,621
To see life everywhere the world is no 
longer made of the dead,

657
00:39:23,871 --> 00:39:25,250
lifeless,
dirt,

658
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:27,840
the dead,
lifeless material that you use to,

659
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:32,270
to make things with.
And as we become better as people,

660
00:39:32,271 --> 00:39:34,040
more truthful,
more grateful,

661
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:39,041
more free as he come closer to one 
another in love.

662
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,641
And,
and by the way,

663
00:39:40,641 --> 00:39:41,474
that's what love is.
Love is the manner in which all 

664
00:39:44,961 --> 00:39:47,570
different things,
all different people,

665
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:52,220
all different intentions,
can join together and exist in communion

666
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:57,340
and can become one while at the same 
time preserving the multiplicity.

667
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,420
So as we follow this path,
the hidden logo and creation,

668
00:40:06,421 --> 00:40:07,254
they shine through the world.
And today we might say that they 

669
00:40:10,621 --> 00:40:15,621
re-enchantment the world and the world 
appears bright and full and not the gray

670
00:40:17,671 --> 00:40:19,740
and dead shadows we often live in.

671
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:25,160
So that would be,
I hope,

672
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,080
a summary,
let's say,

673
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,333
of that path of logos.
But I haven't really explained what the 

674
00:40:31,871 --> 00:40:35,170
source of my excitement was on that 
Friday night yet.

675
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,753
What the source of the excitement was 
that has caused all this flurry of 

676
00:40:41,471 --> 00:40:42,304
attention to Jordan.
And I can tell you I didn't thinking 

677
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:49,000
about this now for months now.
I mean,

678
00:40:49,001 --> 00:40:49,834
some of us have,
and Jordan has been thinking about this 

679
00:40:51,701 --> 00:40:52,840
for months now.

680
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,260
Okay.

681
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,093
And I,
I think by now we can say that it's 

682
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:59,990
really not about gender pronouns.
It's not,

683
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,740
it's about something that is a lot 
bigger than that.

684
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:10,870
And I think I can say confidently by now
that it's about logos.

685
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:12,523
Yeah,

686
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,593
entire project or postmodernism.
The last 30 40 years of higher culture 

687
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:22,760
and higher education has been a 
systematic assault on logos.

688
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,100
Okay.

689
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:29,100
To decenter logos to deconstruct 
narratives and value hierarchies.

690
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,830
So we are less slipping and sliding 
without purpose and direction.

691
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,230
And now we've reached the end of what 
postmodernism has to offer.

692
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:41,783
You can actually say we've,
that we've come to a point where 

693
00:41:43,471 --> 00:41:44,304
postmodernism has one.
Basically the cultural debate and a 

694
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:50,804
philosophy was decries the center and 
certain certainty has pernicious Lee 

695
00:41:55,671 --> 00:42:00,340
become the very center and 
unquestionable authority despises.

696
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,100
So everything is upside down.
Everything is inside out.

697
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:09,610
Everything is becoming its opposite and 
all these inversions and chaos or not to

698
00:42:10,071 --> 00:42:13,760
be taken lightly,
it has brought about a sterile age,

699
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:14,683
literally stare while as people are not 
having enough children to to fill this 

700
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:21,623
society.
I think I keep thinking that maybe 

701
00:42:26,841 --> 00:42:28,420
they're missing a bit of fall census.
Yeah.

702
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,773
But it's also stair island that it has 
brought about this narcissistic and 

703
00:42:41,281 --> 00:42:44,180
fragmented culture.
You see,

704
00:42:44,181 --> 00:42:47,660
they told us that the center cannot 
hold.

705
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:48,980
Yeah.

706
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:53,900
And how things fall apart and now 
everybody's decrying the end of truth.

707
00:42:53,901 --> 00:42:54,890
All of a sudden,
right?

708
00:42:54,891 --> 00:42:58,550
Everybody is saying that we're entering 
an age of post truth fake news.

709
00:42:58,790 --> 00:42:59,623
I mean my goodness.
Even use it as an argument against Dr. 

710
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,060
Peterson,
the debate on gender pronouns.

711
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:06,813
It's the postmodernist that heralded the
end of proof 40 years ago and now 

712
00:43:11,331 --> 00:43:13,460
they're surprised to see the effect it 
has.

713
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:18,940
How chaos does not discriminate.
How is turning against them?

714
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:23,000
Just as they turned it against their 
ideological enemies,

715
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:25,243
he wanted to change the world to sin.
Now they're surprised to find he's 

716
00:43:28,001 --> 00:43:33,001
slipping between your fingers.
What is most surprising and what is most

717
00:43:36,061 --> 00:43:40,890
shocking to them?
He's defined that now having reached the

718
00:43:40,891 --> 00:43:44,970
end of their pursuit,
having thought they had won.

719
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:50,420
He see from within the decomposing 
residues of western patriarchy,

720
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:56,500
he see that there is a seed that 
sprouting that in the darkest place,

721
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:02,000
here's a flame that is lit,
logos or weekends.

722
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,130
The darkness has not overcome it.
Saint John promised this,

723
00:44:07,131 --> 00:44:11,870
that
my postmodern friends,

724
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:15,050
if you had just paid attention to the 
stories,

725
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:19,160
if you just paid attention to the 
stories which are woven in the fabric of

726
00:44:19,161 --> 00:44:19,994
our consciousness,
he's very stories you tried to 

727
00:44:22,401 --> 00:44:23,234
deconstruct,
you would have noticed that don always 

728
00:44:24,801 --> 00:44:27,500
comes.
That is seed is always planted.

729
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:32,860
The logos regains the center,
Christ raises from the dead.

730
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,193
Yeah,

731
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:39,460
and I think that's the excitement we're 
feeling right now.

732
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,673
The find that small sparks that seed of 
a meaningful pattern surprising us in a 

733
00:44:47,801 --> 00:44:51,490
collapsing world.
And it's not just a pattern of meaning,

734
00:44:51,491 --> 00:44:53,620
but it's the beginning of a network of 
people.

735
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,513
I mean just in the past two years,
there's a whole new strange group of 

736
00:44:58,481 --> 00:45:00,900
public figures that's arising from the 
margins.

737
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:03,430
People who are at least trying to figure
it out,

738
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:08,110
who are at least trying to think clearly
and work out ideas and people who are as

739
00:45:08,111 --> 00:45:08,944
different from each other.
As you can imagine spending across 

740
00:45:11,591 --> 00:45:12,371
gender,
race,

741
00:45:12,371 --> 00:45:15,820
and cultures,
even religious and atheists alike trying

742
00:45:15,821 --> 00:45:19,360
to figure it out.
And yet the media and the activists,

743
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:22,690
they scream hysterically,
bigot,

744
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,890
racist,
sexist,

745
00:45:23,891 --> 00:45:24,724
Nazi,
all the usual litany of attacks and 

746
00:45:27,161 --> 00:45:32,020
they're losing their minds.
The sand is slipping out of their hand

747
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:34,383
and it's only two years ago we would 
have probably collapse before this 

748
00:45:37,691 --> 00:45:41,150
attack.
But now you look around and we find that

749
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:46,180
there is a still silent center which to 
sand in which to stand.

750
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,590
There is an eye and the overwhelming 
hurricane

751
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:57,200
and we can finally say,
we will not accept your frame.

752
00:45:58,650 --> 00:45:59,483
We will not accept your definitions.
They are weak by the very process you 

753
00:46:05,821 --> 00:46:09,810
use to deconstruct them,
to deconstruct the categories.

754
00:46:10,590 --> 00:46:12,630
And we will speak for ourselves

755
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:18,733
what a relief.
But it is a dangerous time to time of 

756
00:46:24,631 --> 00:46:27,210
transition.
A time of chaos is,

757
00:46:27,211 --> 00:46:29,630
it is a dangerous time.
First he,

758
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:30,583
the enemies of logos will ramp up their 
hysteria and totalitarian tendencies as 

759
00:46:36,241 --> 00:46:37,074
logos awakens,
but it is also dangerous because that's 

760
00:46:41,341 --> 00:46:45,570
Christ himself told us the terrors grow 
amongst the week.

761
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:51,890
The recentering of logos is the 
reawakening of identities.

762
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:55,020
He can't avoid that.
And that's a frightening thing.

763
00:46:56,090 --> 00:47:01,090
Cause if identity stops at the relative 
low yogi without aiming,

764
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,370
without uniting itself to the highest of
high,

765
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,260
it can be murderous.

766
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:08,900
Okay.

767
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:13,010
And it has been increasingly murderous 
just in the past century.

768
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:20,330
And it is in fact the very murderous and
genocidal tendency of identity,

769
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:24,270
which provoked the postmoderns to 
deconstruct identity in the first place.

770
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,510
And there's a part where we can't blame 
them for that.

771
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,130
I mean,
in the shadow of Auschwitz,

772
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:32,390
what else can you do?

773
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,520
So what

774
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:43,620
we'll strive from this new sprout hand 
on us will depend on whole of us.

775
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:47,860
What will rise from this chaos you've 
seen excite me?

776
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:48,713
Exciting,
but also frightening possibilities of 

777
00:47:50,521 --> 00:47:52,410
what that might look like.
I mean,

778
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:56,940
will it be race again so that we inch 
towards genocide?

779
00:47:56,941 --> 00:47:57,774
Would it only be nation?
So we're tempted to revisit the world 

780
00:48:01,081 --> 00:48:02,790
wars.
Well,

781
00:48:02,791 --> 00:48:07,750
they'd only be gender lid only be class.
The schemes run out first.

782
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:09,990
My Saint Maximus,
the ultimate identity,

783
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:14,430
the place where all meaning finds its 
resolution is the divine logos,

784
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:18,330
the source of everything.
That is our trajectory as we walk.

785
00:48:18,331 --> 00:48:21,750
The path of logo says we are transformed
by truth.

786
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:26,810
The finality is to be united with God.
And I know that for some people just the

787
00:48:28,481 --> 00:48:29,314
word God causes allergic reactions.
And I'm sure people listening to this 

788
00:48:33,551 --> 00:48:37,180
will be developing hives on their skin 
as the cause they hear this.

789
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,270
Then maybe we can just think of it this 
way.

790
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:42,183
For identity to be more than a weapon,
it must reach its highest point in 

791
00:48:47,081 --> 00:48:52,081
something that is beyond who ally.
And so finding,

792
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:53,903
seeing our highest identity in God is 
finding unity with everything and the 

793
00:48:57,391 --> 00:48:58,290
source of everything.

794
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:04,420
And in terms of Christianity in 
particular,

795
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:06,453
the identity was Christ is different 
from other identities because it's the 

796
00:49:09,281 --> 00:49:13,330
identity with the cross and he needs to 
identify with suffering.

797
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:15,103
I mean it's not the identity of a self 
serving power with the identity of a 

798
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:22,180
self emptying,
power of power,

799
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:26,650
bound in low at empties itself out of 
love.

800
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:31,690
I mean it doesn't mean that we shouldn't
struggle.

801
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:33,890
Does it mean that we should just lay 
down and give up?

802
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:34,743
Okay,
you should let our enemies destroy what 

803
00:49:36,191 --> 00:49:38,800
we value most and he cry.
Christ bought,

804
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:40,840
brought a whip into the temple after 
all.

805
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:44,740
But what it really entailed would it w 
what's important about it,

806
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:45,993
and this is something that is echoed 
profoundly and with Dr. Peterson has 

807
00:49:49,721 --> 00:49:50,554
been telling us,
is that we must first walk on the path 

808
00:49:52,671 --> 00:49:53,504
that logos ourselves.
We must embrace our own suffering in 

809
00:49:58,001 --> 00:50:00,550
that truth.
You must take up our cross.

810
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:08,100
You must do so with a desire to first 
get rid of the lies which to blind us.

811
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:13,190
Just straighten our own path and in 
doing so well that is how we will change

812
00:50:13,981 --> 00:50:14,814
the world.
Since Sarah Finn was sorrow is known to 

813
00:50:18,921 --> 00:50:23,570
have said save yourself and thousands 
around you will be saved.

814
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,100
As we walk that path,
as

815
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:32,210
we strip away our own excesses rather 
than look,

816
00:50:32,211 --> 00:50:34,580
rather than looking at the imbalances of
others,

817
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:39,050
as we strip away our bad habits in our 
narcissism,

818
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:41,120
rather than acting like victims,

819
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,513
the rule change
and we will start to see and to 

820
00:50:49,391 --> 00:50:50,224
experience logos to fully live within 
the patterns of meeting that constitute 

821
00:50:54,401 --> 00:50:56,740
the world.
If you take that journey,

822
00:50:56,741 --> 00:50:57,574
I guarantee that the universal patterns 
of meaning will manifest themselves so 

823
00:51:02,261 --> 00:51:05,170
strongly in your life.
Yeah.

824
00:51:05,171 --> 00:51:07,480
At first you'll use the word 
synchronicity,

825
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:11,770
but soon you will have no other word to 
use besides here.

826
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,920
And the postmodern chaos with vantage 
has wax melts before the fire and logos,

827
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:21,663
very logos that rises from the grave 
will fill your world and the world with 

828
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,570
life and light.
Thank you.

829
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:35,240
[inaudible]
yeah,

830
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:04,620
so I'm going to start with a hypothesis.
No,

831
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,140
I spend a lot of time thinking about,

832
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:13,510
yeah,
religious symbolism in archetypes,

833
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:15,543
but there's,
there's,

834
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:16,330
there's a

835
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:17,163
problem with that and the problem is
it lacks concretization notes to think 

836
00:52:26,201 --> 00:52:27,840
about.
The ultimate ideal is as,

837
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:33,060
as only something that's symbolic.
It moves away from the real world.

838
00:52:33,321 --> 00:52:35,680
And it's for partly for this reason

839
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,253
that

840
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:42,760
there's an insistence in Christianity 
that the logo says two things at once.

841
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:43,713
It took me a long time to figure this 
out and I was guided in my attempts to 

842
00:52:47,801 --> 00:52:48,634
understand it by Carl Young was truly 
remarkable person and probably orthodox 

843
00:52:55,481 --> 00:52:57,580
in his fundamental conviction.
So I would say

844
00:53:00,590 --> 00:53:04,420
he talked about the logo says the thing 
that existed at the beginning of time.

845
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:07,130
This is a very particular way of looking
at things.

846
00:53:07,131 --> 00:53:10,340
And so the idea is essentially that,
as Jonathan pointed out,

847
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:11,213
that there's something about 
consciousness that calls forth being 

848
00:53:15,081 --> 00:53:18,800
from chaotic potential.
And you won't understand what this means

849
00:53:18,801 --> 00:53:21,420
because when you look at the future,
or if you look at yourself,

850
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:24,200
you know that what you confront is a 
field of potential.

851
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:26,040
And everyone tells you that.
They

852
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,740
tell you you're not living up to your 
potential.

853
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,950
And potential is a very strange thing 
because it doesn't.

854
00:53:31,951 --> 00:53:32,784
You have to exist.
And so by the canons of the same modern 

855
00:53:34,801 --> 00:53:35,634
science,
it's not something that has any reality 

856
00:53:37,081 --> 00:53:37,914
whatsoever,
but everyone knows precisely what it 

857
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:40,343
means.
And everything around it was full 

858
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:42,423
potential because you can interact with 
it and bring forth new things and you 

859
00:53:46,351 --> 00:53:47,184
know that.
And you can be called for your failure 

860
00:53:49,891 --> 00:53:50,840
to do it and you,
you,

861
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:52,890
you,
you call,

862
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:57,150
you call out yourself for your failure 
to do it because you wake up at three in

863
00:53:57,151 --> 00:53:57,984
the morning and you,
and you torture yourself with your 

864
00:53:59,731 --> 00:54:02,810
inability to bring forth the potential 
that's within you and it,

865
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:05,940
and it haunts your soul.
And it's hellish.

866
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:09,030
And the reason it's hellish is because 
it is hellish.

867
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:10,913
And if you don't call forth the 
potential that's within you and outside 

868
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:16,080
of you,
then in the world does transform to hell

869
00:54:16,081 --> 00:54:20,700
because that's its tendency anyways.
And we've had no shortage of evidence of

870
00:54:20,701 --> 00:54:25,701
that in the last 100 years.
It's,

871
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:30,950
it's part of the Christian doctrine that
at the beginning of time,

872
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:35,010
the logos of Yahuah

873
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,270
operating on potential and brought forth
habitable,

874
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:40,413
the habitable world or,
and it was perfect in some strange 

875
00:54:43,681 --> 00:54:44,514
sense.
It was the paradise in which Adam and 

876
00:54:46,171 --> 00:54:48,900
Eve were placed in the paradise was a 
walled garden,

877
00:54:48,901 --> 00:54:53,901
a well watered place in the walled 
garden is a place of order and chaos,

878
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:55,133
culture and nature.
And that's because people inhabit a 

879
00:54:57,691 --> 00:54:59,370
garden of culture,
nature,

880
00:54:59,371 --> 00:55:01,110
that that's,
that's our environment.

881
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:06,170
And if those two properties are properly
balanced and inside that garden,

882
00:55:06,631 --> 00:55:07,464
everyone can flourish.
And human beings are principal made in 

883
00:55:13,881 --> 00:55:15,180
the image of that logos.

884
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:19,090
And that's why we can speak things into 
B.

885
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,360
And we do.
And when you speak truth,

886
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,110
then you speak paradise into being.
And when you speak falsely,

887
00:55:26,111 --> 00:55:30,130
you speak heroin being,
and that's the truth.

888
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:34,630
And what that means is that with every 
decision that you make,

889
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:38,050
you decide for yourself and for everyone
else,

890
00:55:38,051 --> 00:55:41,650
whether you're going to tilt the world a
little bit more towards hell or a little

891
00:55:41,651 --> 00:55:42,484
bit more towards heaven.
And that's the burden that you bear for 

892
00:55:46,181 --> 00:55:50,650
your existence and the choices that you 
make as you pass through life.

893
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,513
And it's the fleeing from that.
That's at the bottom of the nihilism of 

894
00:55:57,031 --> 00:55:57,864
postmodernism and the escape into the 
totalitarian certainties of idol 

895
00:56:03,691 --> 00:56:04,524
worship.

896
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:06,670
Okay?

897
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:10,900
And none of this is fictional because 
we've seen the consequences.

898
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:15,523
Jonathan said quoting,
I don't remember the source that there 

899
00:56:20,291 --> 00:56:25,291
could be no poetry after,
but that's wrong.

900
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,520
But the poetry has to be about 
Auschwitz.

901
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:31,620
Okay?

902
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:36,120
The lesson for Marsh,
which was never again and fair enough,

903
00:56:36,121 --> 00:56:40,050
but you,
you can't

904
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:45,020
decide not to repeat something terrible 
unless you understand it

905
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,410
and way you don't understand it.
Is that

906
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:56,230
the smallest things that each individual
culminate in a great sense of the state.

907
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:01,330
And so when you ask why terrible things 
happened in the world,

908
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:02,823
the answer's quite simple.
The answer is it's because you're not 

909
00:57:05,351 --> 00:57:06,184
good enough
and it's because you don't tell the 

910
00:57:09,341 --> 00:57:12,010
truth.
And you know,

911
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:14,193
John,
if it said something I thought was very 

912
00:57:15,191 --> 00:57:17,160
interesting,
it's something I've thought about,

913
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:19,090
but I haven't talked to him about it at 
all.

914
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:26,050
What happens as you move towards the 
truth and the answer is everything comes

915
00:57:26,051 --> 00:57:27,310
together.
It really,

916
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:29,410
really is.
The answer is everything comes together.

917
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:31,930
There's even a sexual element to that 
because of course,

918
00:57:31,931 --> 00:57:36,370
the highest element of sexual ecstasy is
to come together

919
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:38,173
and

920
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:42,010
around someone who's telling the truth.
Everything comes together and that's the

921
00:57:42,011 --> 00:57:43,420
potential guests,
any of the world.

922
00:57:43,421 --> 00:57:47,050
It's something that you can partake in.
It's the calls,

923
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:50,050
it's the call to the [inaudible] 
greatest adventure that there is.

924
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:51,543
You can bring forth something akin to 
paradise by speaking the truth and you 

925
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:56,104
can start in your own life and you can 
start it in the life of your own 

926
00:57:59,141 --> 00:57:59,974
families.
And these are people in principle that 

927
00:58:01,091 --> 00:58:01,924
you love and so why would you do 
anything but speak the truth to them to 

928
00:58:05,051 --> 00:58:05,884
protect them from reality?
There's no protecting anyone from 

929
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:12,550
reality.
Reality just is

930
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:20,150
you interact with it on your,
on its terms and you do that my face and

931
00:58:20,151 --> 00:58:25,151
get forthright and you do that by not 
shying away from the challenge.

932
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:29,370
I spent a lot of time trying to 
understand the sermon on the mount.

933
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:31,943
It's a very strange document.
I'm going to tell you what I think it 

934
00:58:34,951 --> 00:58:35,784
means.
It means conceptualize the highest good 

935
00:58:39,921 --> 00:58:40,754
that you can

936
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:45,270
and so you might think that would be the
highest good for you and it would be the

937
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:47,830
highest good for the family around you 
that you love.

938
00:58:47,831 --> 00:58:48,664
And it would be the highest good that 
family in the state and it would be the 

939
00:58:51,391 --> 00:58:52,224
highest good for the state.
In the world and that would be the 

940
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:54,864
highest possible.
Good a bit that even though you don't 

941
00:58:56,461 --> 00:58:59,430
know how amy,
that make that what you want

942
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:02,263
and then tell the truth and it's an 
adventure because you don't know what's 

943
00:59:05,491 --> 00:59:07,650
going to happen.
You have no idea.

944
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,490
Because if you treat things 
instrumental,

945
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:10,373
you treat people instrumentally,
you use them as tools for your own 

946
00:59:12,541 --> 00:59:13,374
desires and not.
The problem with that is what do you 

947
00:59:16,091 --> 00:59:16,924
know about what you've designed?
Many things that you chased will turn 

948
00:59:20,011 --> 00:59:21,180
out to be empty.

949
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:22,060
Okay,

950
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:23,980
well what happens if you just tell the 
truth?

951
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:27,330
Well,
the world will unfold around you in very

952
00:59:27,331 --> 00:59:31,110
strange and mysterious ways and there 
isn't anything gets more exciting to now

953
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:33,030
and it's perhaps something excited me 
enough.

954
00:59:33,031 --> 00:59:37,770
So that is suffering hits attendant on 
being would redeem itself.

955
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:41,130
Why not adventure?
And that's the call.

956
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:41,993
That's the western call to the 
individual is suffering of being can 

957
00:59:45,061 --> 00:59:47,850
redeem itself through truth.
And it's not,

958
00:59:47,890 --> 00:59:49,980
it's,
it's not a rule.

959
00:59:49,981 --> 00:59:54,390
It's not a proposition that you need to 
adhere to like a good citizen.

960
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:58,170
It's,
it's the proper way of when did your way

961
00:59:58,171 --> 01:00:01,350
through the terrible world without 
making it worse than it already is,

962
01:00:01,351 --> 01:00:04,290
and with the possibility perhaps of 
making it better.

963
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:09,800
There's no more exciting possibility 
than not and no higher moral demand.

964
01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:13,230
And the thing is,
is everyone knows that you know,

965
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:17,310
when you lie according to your own 
conception of the truth,

966
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,233
that there's something something 
shameful and demeaning about that and 

967
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:23,910
know that it hurts people and you think,
well,

968
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:26,490
why do you do it?
Despite all of that,

969
01:00:26,491 --> 01:00:30,420
in part because it's easy and partly 
being,

970
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,910
you do it because there's a crooked,
horrible,

971
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:33,773
hellish part of your soul that's more 
than happy if part of what you do is 

972
01:00:37,111 --> 01:00:40,800
make everything worse to paid for the 
sin of its existence.

973
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:44,860
And I would say we should stop doing 
that and see what we can do it,

974
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:49,500
but got ourselves together as human 
beings are remarkable creatures.

975
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:55,430
We put together an amazing civilization 
working out at half time.

976
01:00:55,830 --> 01:00:59,070
You know,
it's like 55% of humanity.

977
01:00:59,620 --> 01:00:59,940
Okay?

978
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:00,773
On a good day is working to make things 
better and 45% is working to make it 

979
01:01:05,641 --> 01:01:06,474
worse than you wonder what would happen 
if we all just decided that we were 

980
01:01:10,021 --> 01:01:12,240
going to make things better.
As simple as that.

981
01:01:12,241 --> 01:01:15,300
Start where you are,
make things around you better.

982
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:17,533
Where would we be?
What would the world turned into around 

983
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:25,190
a civilization of people who were 
genuinely trying to make things better?

984
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:26,593
I can tell you,
we better find out soon because if we 

985
01:01:28,131 --> 01:01:28,964
don't try collectively to make things 
better given the current state of 

986
01:01:32,061 --> 01:01:34,580
affairs,
they are going to get a lot worse.

987
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,193
Okay.

988
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:39,873
I thought for a long time,
I wonder why people find themselves 

989
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:47,020
adrift and meaninglessness and there's a
lot of answers to that.

990
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:51,700
There's the classical criticisms of 
traditional faith and being put forth by

991
01:01:51,701 --> 01:01:53,670
brilliant people like Friedrich 
Nietzsche.

992
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:55,200
Okay.

993
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,033
There's the idea that there were a fairy
tales that people live by prior to the 

994
01:02:00,361 --> 01:02:01,194
modern age and revoke girl knows and 
that's left this in a cosmo sticks 

995
01:02:03,781 --> 01:02:04,614
bereft of meaning and so it's a 
consequence of the inevitable unfolding 

996
01:02:08,311 --> 01:02:12,270
of a kind of counting rationality.
And some of that's true,

997
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:13,104
but there's a lot of it isn't true 
because I've also come to understand 

998
01:02:17,581 --> 01:02:21,920
that the reason that's many of us 
proclaimed that life is meaningless this

999
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:22,763
because we actually would rather have it
be meaning less than to take 

1000
01:02:25,501 --> 01:02:28,860
responsibility for it because you can 
imagine this,

1001
01:02:28,861 --> 01:02:29,694
you can imagine this scenario.
Imagine you were offered a choice and 

1002
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:35,460
this is because you are offered this 
choice.

1003
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:36,390
If you'd say,
well,

1004
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:40,640
absolutely nothing you do matters and 
who the hell's going to know anyways?

1005
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:44,340
Million years and so you can do whatever
you want moment to moment,

1006
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:44,640
right?

1007
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:45,473
That's the payoff for that perspective.
As you can do whatever you want moment 

1008
01:02:48,301 --> 01:02:52,140
to moment and you will not be held 
responsible by anyone including yourself

1009
01:02:52,141 --> 01:02:55,520
for pursuing your heading,
impulsive,

1010
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:57,390
immoral,
foolish,

1011
01:02:57,450 --> 01:02:58,283
destructive genocidal tendencies or the 
alternative is that you can assume that 

1012
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:04,583
everything you do is meaningful and 
everything you do has an impact on the 

1013
01:03:07,501 --> 01:03:08,334
way the world unfolds and take 
responsibility for that and it's 

1014
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:15,060
something that you'll have your meaning.
All right?

1015
01:03:15,061 --> 01:03:15,894
That's for sure,
because you have an infinite amount of 

1016
01:03:17,401 --> 01:03:18,234
responsibility for every mistake that 
you make under those circumstances and 

1017
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:25,890
perhaps as a,
as a medic come in for that,

1018
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:27,413
the knowledge that when you're on the 
path properly that you're helping you 

1019
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:35,640
world unfold and the best direction that
it possibly could.

1020
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,430
Well,
there isn't anything better than that.

1021
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:42,360
If you want something to set against the
inevitable suffering of,

1022
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:43,733
of life,
that's what you said against if eat 

1023
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:47,453
endless adventure of trying to make 
things better in every possible way and 

1024
01:03:52,141 --> 01:03:57,141
God only knows where we could get if we 
did that around the perfect man,

1025
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:01,470
everything comes together and I don't 
believe that that's,

1026
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:02,393
that's,
that's where the infinite logos that 

1027
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:06,863
express,
that stretches across time and space 

1028
01:04:08,821 --> 01:04:10,530
comes together in a single individual.

1029
01:04:10,530 --> 01:04:14,910
That's the Christian story.
The reason for that is that every single

1030
01:04:14,911 --> 01:04:18,810
person is embedded in a specific time 
and place.

1031
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:21,390
That's you as an individual,
but at the same point,

1032
01:04:21,570 --> 01:04:22,403
you're also the involvement of this 
thing that is active across forever to 

1033
01:04:26,521 --> 01:04:30,970
call
chaos into habitable being.

1034
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,330
You're both his divine,
eternal,

1035
01:04:34,331 --> 01:04:39,331
transcendent essence and the finite 
shell that you inhabit.

1036
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:45,490
It's like the genie,
right?

1037
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:46,993
A genie is genius and the genius is 
something that can grant three magical 

1038
01:04:50,631 --> 01:04:51,464
wishes,
but how's to inhabit his tiny little 

1039
01:04:52,731 --> 01:04:54,980
space?
It's the same idea.

1040
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:56,473
Well,
you can act that out in your life and 

1041
01:04:59,151 --> 01:05:02,120
you can transcend it,
and as you do that,

1042
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,530
things come together around you and 
everything becomes musical.

1043
01:05:06,531 --> 01:05:07,364
That's the right way to think about it.
And then everything becomes alive and 

1044
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:11,353
you shy away from that because you're 
resentful about the fundamental 

1045
01:05:13,821 --> 01:05:18,010
structure of being and you don't want 
the responsibility and it's

1046
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:22,180
no bloody wonder because the 
responsibility is the responsibility for

1047
01:05:22,181 --> 01:05:23,200
everything.
You know?

1048
01:05:23,201 --> 01:05:25,060
That's why it's part of the Christian 
story,

1049
01:05:25,061 --> 01:05:26,680
that Christ took the sins of the world

1050
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:27,653
well themselves,
because that's what you have to do in 

1051
01:05:29,361 --> 01:05:32,180
order to put yourself together.
It's your fault.

1052
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:38,300
Everything isn't going right is because 
you're not good enough.

1053
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,310
Well,
who wants that?

1054
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:43,040
Right?
Welcome.

1055
01:05:43,041 --> 01:05:46,460
The postmodernists has the lighten the 
burden,

1056
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:48,890
it consequences that nothing has any 
meaning,

1057
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:52,700
but that's a small price to pay to get 
rid of that particular burden.

1058
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:54,290
Well,
maybe not.

1059
01:05:54,410 --> 01:05:59,410
Maybe the meaning of life is to be found
in your voluntary willingness to take on

1060
01:06:00,621 --> 01:06:02,840
that burden and carry it.
Right.

1061
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:04,940
Well,
that's the notion that's embedded in the

1062
01:06:04,941 --> 01:06:06,380
idea of the cross,
right?

1063
01:06:06,381 --> 01:06:11,381
To pick up a full conscious knowledge of
your own vulnerability,

1064
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:15,290
your,
your subjugation to be trail,

1065
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:16,660
your tear,
your,

1066
01:06:17,270 --> 01:06:18,103
your slavery at the hands of the state,
your insanity and your mortality and to 

1067
01:06:22,611 --> 01:06:25,430
say,
I'll bear that voluntarily.

1068
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:28,400
It's okay,
I can handle it.

1069
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:40,330
It seems to me that we're at a kind of 
crossroads.

1070
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:45,970
I don't know exactly why you always meet
the Devil at the crossroads,

1071
01:06:45,971 --> 01:06:48,880
by the way.
And the reason for that is because every

1072
01:06:48,881 --> 01:06:51,460
crossroads is a choice,
right?

1073
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:53,590
And it's always a choice between good 
and evil.

1074
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:56,860
We're at a crossroads and I don't know 
why.

1075
01:06:57,370 --> 01:06:58,203
I guess it's because of the terrible 
20th centuries and it's energy and now 

1076
01:07:01,001 --> 01:07:03,730
we have something new.
In the aftermath of that,

1077
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:04,803
it's time for everyone to pick up the 
chaotic pieces and carry them 

1078
01:07:07,601 --> 01:07:08,434
voluntarily and to make their way 
through the world and to try to speak 

1079
01:07:11,501 --> 01:07:13,810
their truth and to see what happens.
It will

1080
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:15,700
eel yourself,
well,

1081
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:17,990
heal your body,
heal your soul,

1082
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:20,750
heal your family.
It'll heal the nation.

1083
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:23,780
That's what truth now is and how could 
it be any other way?

1084
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:24,703
The reality is the truth and how are you
going to adapt to it without using the 

1085
01:07:28,131 --> 01:07:29,870
truth.
While the problem,

1086
01:07:29,930 --> 01:07:30,763
his reality is the terrible truth and 
it's certainly possible that a terrible 

1087
01:07:33,651 --> 01:07:34,484
truth is its own medicine.
With regards to my connections 

1088
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:44,773
orthodoxy,
I have kind of a funny story to tell 

1089
01:07:46,941 --> 01:07:49,110
about that.
Oh,

1090
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:53,760
15 years ago,
a student of mine

1091
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:56,823
who,
who I've maintained the relationship 

1092
01:07:58,351 --> 01:08:00,660
with since I taught at Harvard.

1093
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:02,413
MMM.

1094
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:06,030
I'd helped him through a difficult 
period.

1095
01:08:06,031 --> 01:08:06,864
He,
his family had been at the center of a 

1096
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:09,984
real storm of publicity like this,
a front page story for a number of 

1097
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:15,860
months.
Recently,

1098
01:08:15,861 --> 01:08:16,040
he

1099
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:16,873
returned the favor with me,
but he proposed at one point that I fly 

1100
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:25,550
down to Los Angeles and act as the 
officiant at his marriage.

1101
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:27,230
And I thought,
that's interesting.

1102
01:08:27,231 --> 01:08:29,570
I never expected that to happen.
And so I thought,

1103
01:08:29,571 --> 01:08:30,590
well,
if I'm going to do that,

1104
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:34,610
I better get ordained because that's 
obviously the logical thing to do.

1105
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:35,630
And I thought,
well,

1106
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:39,570
how do you get ordained on short notice?
And obviously the answer to that and see

1107
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,060
you go online.
So,

1108
01:08:43,810 --> 01:08:46,500
so I went online and I,
I signed up,

1109
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,420
I could name my church.
So I did,

1110
01:08:48,421 --> 01:08:50,430
I have this church,
I'm the only member.

1111
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:52,193
Yeah,

1112
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:55,563
it's called the,
it's called the Church of the spirit of 

1113
01:08:57,461 --> 01:09:00,220
St your chem of florists,
which you know,

1114
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:02,830
isn't necessarily the name that you 
would expect.

1115
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:05,410
Um,
I like to say Yo Kim,

1116
01:09:05,411 --> 01:09:08,020
from what I knew of him,
because he had this idea that there were

1117
01:09:08,021 --> 01:09:10,600
three,
he paused.

1118
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:11,443
There would be three parts of Western 
civilization and one would be the epoch 

1119
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:14,783
of the father.
And that's what was like the Old 

1120
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:20,760
Testament and Old Testament reality that
has to do with following rules.

1121
01:09:20,761 --> 01:09:21,594
And then there was the park of the sun.
And that was of course the equal 

1122
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,250
Christian,
he parking for the last 2000 years.

1123
01:09:26,251 --> 01:09:27,084
And he believed that what would come 
after that would be the power of the 

1124
01:09:29,550 --> 01:09:31,080
Holy Ghost.
And the Holy Ghost is this weird

1125
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:37,740
spirit thing
hypothetic Christ's left behind in habit

1126
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:42,550
people and guide them on their path.
And it seems to me that that's very much

1127
01:09:42,551 --> 01:09:45,130
in keeping with the Orthodox idea that 
the proper,

1128
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:46,393
um,
moral pathway for each individual to 

1129
01:09:48,161 --> 01:09:51,670
take is to attempt to bear the burden of
the perfect individual,

1130
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:53,530
right to become Christ,
so to speak,

1131
01:09:53,531 --> 01:09:58,531
in an attempt to transcend more calorie 
infinitude into and to unite with God.

1132
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:00,071
And I thought,
well,

1133
01:10:00,071 --> 01:10:02,680
that was kind of a cool idea.
So I thought,

1134
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:05,080
well,
I might as well have that as a church.

1135
01:10:05,081 --> 01:10:07,720
And then I thought,
who should I be in this church?

1136
01:10:07,721 --> 01:10:08,554
And I thought,
well,

1137
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:13,060
poke was probably a little bit on the 
narcissistic side,

1138
01:10:13,061 --> 01:10:16,160
let's say.
So I thought I'll be nips or Paula.

1139
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:17,893
Yeah.

1140
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:21,530
Because I thought that was kind of 
archaic and House and sort of out of the

1141
01:10:21,531 --> 01:10:25,540
way enough so that it was a good joke.
So I'm my own metropolitan,

1142
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:28,130
my own church.
It only has one rule.

1143
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,600
And so you can show you it if you want.
Um,

1144
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:33,320
the rule is that if you're a member of 
my church,

1145
01:10:33,321 --> 01:10:37,100
you can't follow stupid rules.
Yeah.

1146
01:10:37,101 --> 01:10:38,750
So that's a good rule because it's 
actually,

1147
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:40,560
it's an anti rule,
rule lay,

1148
01:10:40,561 --> 01:10:42,290
which is really funny as far as I'm 
concerned.

1149
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:43,693
Anyways,
I went down to La and I did marry these 

1150
01:10:46,251 --> 01:10:48,080
two and you're still married and so 
that's good.

1151
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:50,870
Yeah.
Yeah.

1152
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:53,840
So I know that's a good family,
but it's been a long day.

1153
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:56,900
Um,
I talked to Sam Harris today.

1154
01:10:56,901 --> 01:10:59,630
Again,
for those of you who it went great.

1155
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:05,300
It went great.
Anyway,

1156
01:11:05,301 --> 01:11:07,370
so look,
the idea is pretty straightforward,

1157
01:11:07,371 --> 01:11:08,204
you know,
as far as I can tell through this 

1158
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:10,183
tremendous idea that's at the bottom of 
western culture that's taken the human 

1159
01:11:13,441 --> 01:11:18,150
race millennia and perhaps an endless 
amount of time before then,

1160
01:11:18,151 --> 01:11:20,710
an eternal amount of time before then to
formulate.

1161
01:11:21,150 --> 01:11:24,630
The idea is that our consciousness,
and that's the center of us,

1162
01:11:24,631 --> 01:11:26,700
the soul,
whatever that happens to be,

1163
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:31,680
partakes in the process by which 
creation comes into va.

1164
01:11:31,710 --> 01:11:32,543
And we do that through the logos,
which is our capacity to think and to 

1165
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:37,583
other words and to engage in dialogue.
But more importantly to do that 

1166
01:11:40,201 --> 01:11:43,650
truthfully and to the degree that we're 
able to do that truthfully,

1167
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,800
we bring paradise into being rather than
hell.

1168
01:11:46,801 --> 01:11:51,801
And it seems to me that that's as close 
to objective reality,

1169
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,320
although it's not precisely objective,
it's more than objective reality to kind

1170
01:11:55,321 --> 01:11:56,380
of Metta reality.

1171
01:11:56,390 --> 01:11:58,770
It's,
it's the most profound truth that you'll

1172
01:11:58,771 --> 01:11:59,604
ever encounter.
And the thing that's cool about it is 

1173
01:12:01,861 --> 01:12:04,230
you can even,
you can put it to the test if you want,

1174
01:12:04,231 --> 01:12:06,930
you know,
you start deciding that you're not going

1175
01:12:06,931 --> 01:12:09,240
to lie because how the hell are you 
going to tell the truth?

1176
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:10,710
What do you know?
You don't know what the truth is,

1177
01:12:10,711 --> 01:12:14,400
but you certainly know when you're lying
and you know how to stop doing that.

1178
01:12:14,440 --> 01:12:15,630
So I would say,
well just try,

1179
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:18,690
stop lying and see what happens.
Try it for like a year.

1180
01:12:18,990 --> 01:12:20,730
You don't get to lie about anything 
anymore.

1181
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:21,743
And that also means you can't do things 
that you would be afraid to talk about 

1182
01:12:24,421 --> 01:12:27,060
because you know if you're going to tell
the truth,

1183
01:12:27,061 --> 01:12:28,680
you have to tell the truth about what 
you did.

1184
01:12:28,681 --> 01:12:29,514
And if you do reprehensible things,
then you can't just run around telling 

1185
01:12:31,741 --> 01:12:32,670
everybody about them.

1186
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:33,683
So it also means that you have,
if not act in a way that you wouldn't 

1187
01:12:36,241 --> 01:12:39,960
speak truthfully about and try it.
You'll find out first of all,

1188
01:12:39,961 --> 01:12:40,794
that you're so full of lies and deceit 
that you just bloody wall can't believe 

1189
01:12:43,411 --> 01:12:46,560
it.
When I started doing this 30 years ago,

1190
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:47,483
it really just about drove me crazy 
because I divided into two people in 

1191
01:12:50,671 --> 01:12:51,504
some sense and one person,
one person was talking and the other 

1192
01:12:55,681 --> 01:12:56,514
person was watching,
the person that was talking in the 

1193
01:12:58,681 --> 01:13:03,090
talking person was a puppet and the 
watching person was the right person.

1194
01:13:03,091 --> 01:13:05,650
And every time the talking person said 
something to watching,

1195
01:13:05,651 --> 01:13:08,160
first person could go eop elite that 
that isn't true,

1196
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:10,320
that isn't here idea.
And I thought,

1197
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:11,303
wow,
that's really not good because it looks 

1198
01:13:12,451 --> 01:13:13,284
like 95% of what I'm saying isn't mine.
Or I'm saying it for show or I'm saying 

1199
01:13:16,891 --> 01:13:19,950
it can be dominant primate or unsaying 
it so that I can be,

1200
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:21,173
you know,
so that I can use my language 

1201
01:13:23,461 --> 01:13:26,040
instrumentally and get what I want or,
or you know,

1202
01:13:26,041 --> 01:13:28,380
I swiped it from the book and I really 
don't deserve it.

1203
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:32,760
But I'm saying it like it was horrible.
It was 95% seriously.

1204
01:13:32,761 --> 01:13:33,594
And so then I learned at least in part 
to only say things that made me feel 

1205
01:13:37,141 --> 01:13:37,974
like I was together.
And that's a part of that coming 

1206
01:13:39,391 --> 01:13:41,100
together.
You can feel that physically,

1207
01:13:41,101 --> 01:13:41,934
you know,
if you,

1208
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:45,600
if you say something deceitful,
you shrink and you cower from it,

1209
01:13:45,601 --> 01:13:47,820
it makes you embarrassed and it makes 
you weak.

1210
01:13:47,821 --> 01:13:50,030
You can feel the weakness.
So like,

1211
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,960
well stop saying things that make you 
weak.

1212
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:54,330
If you don't want to be me,
then if you want to be strong,

1213
01:13:54,331 --> 01:13:56,250
stop saying things that make you feel 
weak.

1214
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,230
Try it.
Try it.

1215
01:13:58,231 --> 01:13:59,064
See what happens.
You can test this out and here are 

1216
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,970
things will be way different for you in 
five years.

1217
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:03,804
You won't even be the same person and 
God only knows what will happen in the 

1218
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:08,000
decades.
So it's really worth it.

1219
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:09,780
We started,
you don't have an embedded to do anyways

1220
01:14:09,790 --> 01:14:11,350
because here you are,
you know,

1221
01:14:11,351 --> 01:14:12,184
suffering stupidly away,
you might as well do something useful 

1222
01:14:14,441 --> 01:14:16,660
with your time while you're waiting to 
die.

1223
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:20,120
So,
and there isn't anything

1224
01:14:20,130 --> 01:14:21,990
I think more interesting to do than 
that.

1225
01:14:21,991 --> 01:14:25,380
It's so cool because don't,
I mean it's part of what I decided to do

1226
01:14:25,470 --> 01:14:27,320
last September when I made these,
you know,

1227
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:28,343
crazy videos,
which really have more of a necessity 

1228
01:14:30,270 --> 01:14:32,220
and I certainly thought they would.
I thought,

1229
01:14:32,221 --> 01:14:33,054
well,
I've got some things to say and why 

1230
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:37,500
don't I say them and see what happens.
That's sort of,

1231
01:14:37,830 --> 01:14:38,663
that's an excellent way to live.
Why don't I say the things that I think 

1232
01:14:40,741 --> 01:14:44,730
and see what happens.
Well,

1233
01:14:44,731 --> 01:14:46,230
this is one of the things that's 
happened.

1234
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:47,430
So that's kind of cool.
I mean,

1235
01:14:47,431 --> 01:14:50,430
how long likely is this?
It's completely absurd and ridiculous.

1236
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:52,080
Here.
I'm with Jonathan,

1237
01:14:52,081 --> 01:14:55,710
this crazy French Canadian carver and 
these two guys in dresses here on you.

1238
01:14:58,130 --> 01:14:58,963
Exactly.
That's exactly what you'd expect given 

1239
01:15:00,981 --> 01:15:02,740
what I've been talking about recently

1240
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:05,963
because it's very unlikely.
And all of this is being very unlikely 

1241
01:15:07,981 --> 01:15:09,990
and life is very unlikely.
And you know,

1242
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,460
maybe it could be absolutely 
magnificent,

1243
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:13,413
wonderful.
We could make everything into a holy 

1244
01:15:15,031 --> 01:15:15,864
temple in which we did live forever,
peacefully only searching for more 

1245
01:15:19,651 --> 01:15:22,500
remarkable and spectacular things to do 
next.

1246
01:15:22,501 --> 01:15:23,334
And that's what people do with parents.
They sit around dreaming about how the 

1247
01:15:26,701 --> 01:15:27,534
paradise they already had could give 
rise to a paradise that's yet greater 

1248
01:15:31,621 --> 01:15:35,040
than the one that's there.
And with the collective imagination that

1249
01:15:35,041 --> 01:15:37,110
we pursued,
that could be a never ending thing.

1250
01:15:37,111 --> 01:15:39,630
And we could bring it into being.
And that's what we should do.

1251
01:15:39,631 --> 01:15:40,464
Because the alternative is to let 
everything degenerate into chaos and 

1252
01:15:43,130 --> 01:15:45,870
hale.
And how about we don't do that?

1253
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:48,150
Well,
that's good enough.

1254
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:53,810
[inaudible]
MMM.

1255
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,900
Thank you.
To Metropolitan Jordan at Toronto.

1256
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:18,120
Um,
I just wanted to quickly say,

1257
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:19,010
uh,
uh,

1258
01:16:19,010 --> 01:16:19,843
following other Jeffrey's talk,
we will have the question and answer 

1259
01:16:22,401 --> 01:16:23,720
period.
So,

1260
01:16:23,930 --> 01:16:25,880
uh,
five minutes from now,

1261
01:16:25,910 --> 01:16:26,743
uh,
we'll have people walking by the isles 

1262
01:16:29,151 --> 01:16:30,260
taking your um,

1263
01:16:30,860 --> 01:16:31,070
okay.

1264
01:16:31,070 --> 01:16:32,600
Question sheets as well as

1265
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,090
on the balcony.
So,

1266
01:16:34,091 --> 01:16:35,770
um,
and uh,

1267
01:16:35,771 --> 01:16:36,604
after Father Jeffrey,
his uncle will have the question and 

1268
01:16:37,511 --> 01:16:39,010
answer period and if you have more

1269
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:42,340
questions after that we'll collect those
as well just

1270
01:16:43,650 --> 01:16:46,110
and if you're on the balcony,
just give them to Aden.

1271
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:47,680
Thank you very much.
And the different,

1272
01:16:52,390 --> 01:16:54,300
good evening.

1273
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:56,890
Well,
the Ted and I have had a,

1274
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:57,773
an a running debates over the last few 
weeks as to what would be worse going 

1275
01:17:01,751 --> 01:17:06,751
first or going laughs,
how do I follow that?

1276
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:11,623
The second century church did something 
rather strange and quite astonishing 

1277
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:17,593
stories about Jesus,
which had been circulating orally for 

1278
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:22,003
some generations,
began to be written down in the second 

1279
01:17:24,531 --> 01:17:29,531
half of the first century who are 
numerous versions in circulation,

1280
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:34,250
which came over time to be associated 
with the traditions of one or another.

1281
01:17:34,251 --> 01:17:37,100
Epistolic witness to the risen Lord 
Jesus.

1282
01:17:38,690 --> 01:17:41,220
And at a certain point,
a choice had to be made.

1283
01:17:42,390 --> 01:17:45,510
The church could have come up with a 
definitive accounts,

1284
01:17:46,050 --> 01:17:50,260
the single canonical version.
And that approach was,

1285
01:17:50,261 --> 01:17:51,094
was certainly a temptation.
One of the first to do this was a 

1286
01:17:53,911 --> 01:17:58,770
dualistic heretic called Marcy.
He settled on one Gospel,

1287
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:02,350
the gospel of Luke as it happens.
You liked that,

1288
01:18:02,351 --> 01:18:03,900
huh?
Which he redacted.

1289
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:05,130
However,
the suit,

1290
01:18:05,131 --> 01:18:07,590
his vision,
incidentally,

1291
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:08,453
he also rejected the entire Old 
Testament and the process teaching that 

1292
01:18:11,101 --> 01:18:11,934
matter was evil and therefore the 
creator God of the Old Testament was 

1293
01:18:14,701 --> 01:18:15,534
responsible for it.
But the point here is that he wanted a 

1294
01:18:18,871 --> 01:18:21,060
single goal,
spoke to reflect Jesus,

1295
01:18:21,061 --> 01:18:26,061
who he saw as offering salvation from 
this material world that was a harrison.

1296
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:30,150
This thing,
this idea of a single gospel continue to

1297
01:18:30,151 --> 01:18:30,984
be a temptation even for those within 
the canonical church in the middle of 

1298
01:18:35,251 --> 01:18:36,084
the second century and otherwise quite 
orthodox believer rotation apparently 

1299
01:18:39,751 --> 01:18:42,810
scandalized by the plurality of the 
gospels,

1300
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:45,020
created his famous via Tesoro.

1301
01:18:46,170 --> 01:18:47,003
In this,
he wove the gospel accounts into one 

1302
01:18:49,231 --> 01:18:52,950
seamless consistent narrative and it had
some traction.

1303
01:18:52,951 --> 01:18:53,784
In fact for some centuries,
particularly among the Syria a 

1304
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:59,240
tradition.
This was the main gospel use,

1305
01:19:00,010 --> 01:19:00,843
but the church rejected both of these 
attempts and from the beginning of the 

1306
01:19:06,031 --> 01:19:08,820
process of the canonization of the New 
Testament,

1307
01:19:09,030 --> 01:19:13,770
it accepted that there should be 
different gospels leading the charge was

1308
01:19:13,771 --> 01:19:14,604
the second century bishop of Neil 
[inaudible] who insisted or what he 

1309
01:19:18,421 --> 01:19:19,254
called the oven Galyon Techco Morpho the
four fold gospel already in his days 

1310
01:19:26,070 --> 01:19:26,903
day.
Those were the four gospels we have in 

1311
01:19:27,751 --> 01:19:31,270
our new test and today
this is important,

1312
01:19:31,271 --> 01:19:35,050
fully aware of the significant 
differences in the accounts,

1313
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:38,830
not only different emphases and 
theological visions,

1314
01:19:39,030 --> 01:19:44,030
the contradictions the church chose to 
canonize diversity.

1315
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:46,343
It shows to retain for separate and 
distinctive literary compositions 

1316
01:19:49,381 --> 01:19:52,980
witnessing to the life,
death and resurrection of Jesus.

1317
01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:54,943
This is interesting for all kinds of 
reasons and of course it points to the 

1318
01:19:57,801 --> 01:19:58,634
experience of Jesus being more profound 
than any one account with capture but 

1319
01:20:03,051 --> 01:20:05,890
not least.
And for our purposes and theme tonight,

1320
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:10,380
it also says something about the meaning
of what it is to be human.

1321
01:20:12,190 --> 01:20:13,023
As a new testament scholar,
Luke Timothy Johnson drives the 

1322
01:20:16,421 --> 01:20:17,254
diversity of the Gospel.
Accounts signifies the infinite 

1323
01:20:20,830 --> 01:20:25,830
recommended replicability of the story 
of Jesus in the lives of human beings.

1324
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:27,610
Okay?

1325
01:20:27,610 --> 01:20:28,443
The story of Jesus is not simply a pass.
The church declares it continues as the 

1326
01:20:33,221 --> 01:20:34,054
spirit of Jesus transforms the lives of 
human beings according to the mind of 

1327
01:20:38,171 --> 01:20:43,040
Christ,
but in what sense can the story of Jesus

1328
01:20:43,041 --> 01:20:43,874
be replicated?
Surely not in the specifics of his 

1329
01:20:47,481 --> 01:20:50,660
ministry,
which are irretrievably in the past.

1330
01:20:51,350 --> 01:20:52,183
It's not about being a celibate,
bearded Jewish male growing up in 

1331
01:20:54,861 --> 01:20:58,040
gallery in the first century Palestine 
technology.

1332
01:20:58,250 --> 01:21:00,630
Someone who works with his hands like 
it's awesome.

1333
01:21:00,670 --> 01:21:01,503
Father.
Such historical elements are not 

1334
01:21:03,621 --> 01:21:06,560
repeatable.
Neither are they important to the piece,

1335
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:08,973
rather the plurality of the gospels in 
their variety of and contradictory 

1336
01:21:13,570 --> 01:21:15,680
historical details.
Oh,

1337
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:18,400
it's beyond all this to a deeper 
significance.

1338
01:21:19,450 --> 01:21:23,000
That is to the meaning of the story of 
Jesus contained in these.

1339
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:24,993
It's not the facts of Jesus's life that 
matter and find new expression in the 

1340
01:21:28,151 --> 01:21:33,100
lives of others,
but rather a pattern of his existence.

1341
01:21:34,430 --> 01:21:35,263
Jesus' existence as one of radical 
obedience towards God and selfless 

1342
01:21:39,581 --> 01:21:40,414
service towards others forms a pattern 
for all humanity that can be written in 

1343
01:21:44,981 --> 01:21:46,570
the heart by the Holy Spirit.

1344
01:21:48,850 --> 01:21:53,140
It's this pattern that Paul designates 
as the normals.

1345
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:56,350
History often translated the law of 
Christ,

1346
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:59,830
but it's better understood perhaps as 
the pattern of Christ,

1347
01:21:59,831 --> 01:22:04,240
the pattern of the Messiah.
As an aside,

1348
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:05,283
his concept of the pattern of Christ 
etched into the multiform narratives 

1349
01:22:08,531 --> 01:22:11,380
that witness to the life,
death and resurrection of Jesus.

1350
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:12,333
It was also the reason for the limits 
that were placed on what could be 

1351
01:22:14,921 --> 01:22:17,170
considered gospel.
You see,

1352
01:22:17,171 --> 01:22:18,004
a diversity was not just allowed but a 
requirement to express the fullness of 

1353
01:22:21,761 --> 01:22:25,750
truth.
It was nevertheless a bridge too far and

1354
01:22:25,751 --> 01:22:26,584
the rejection of the so-called gnostic 
gospels with which I'm sure many of you 

1355
01:22:29,951 --> 01:22:32,620
are familiar,
was precisely that.

1356
01:22:32,621 --> 01:22:33,454
They were not narratives but often just 
collections of safe and that makes 

1357
01:22:38,621 --> 01:22:39,454
sense.
The gnostics were not interested in the 

1358
01:22:41,021 --> 01:22:41,854
material world,
and to have a story requires 

1359
01:22:44,471 --> 01:22:45,304
materiality.
There sacred texts as much as they 

1360
01:22:48,461 --> 01:22:49,294
purported to be about Jesus lacks 
precisely the narrative element of the 

1361
01:22:53,261 --> 01:22:55,000
passion of Christ.

1362
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:56,673
Now,
time does not suffice for us to explore 

1363
01:22:57,881 --> 01:22:58,714
together this evening.
How across all the various writings of 

1364
01:23:00,851 --> 01:23:04,720
the New Testament,
this underlying pattern of price,

1365
01:23:04,770 --> 01:23:05,603
the or maybe each outline,
the very brief list of sketches in the 

1366
01:23:09,311 --> 01:23:12,850
four gospels and the letters of Paul and
the other early apostles.

1367
01:23:12,851 --> 01:23:13,684
Behind all the collected facts,
there's a deep consistency and the 

1368
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:18,963
earliest Christian literature concerning
a focus not on wondrous deeds or even 

1369
01:23:23,230 --> 01:23:24,063
wise words or on the character of Jesus 
as Messiah on the meaning of his life 

1370
01:23:29,620 --> 01:23:30,453
and death.
They all reveal the same pattern of 

1371
01:23:34,091 --> 01:23:38,080
radical obedience to God and selfless 
love towards other people.

1372
01:23:38,590 --> 01:23:39,423
They reveal a journey that plunges to 
the depths of alienation in solidarity 

1373
01:23:44,231 --> 01:23:47,500
with all and then rises in 
glorification,

1374
01:23:47,650 --> 01:23:51,160
having not nearly overcome suffering,
sin and death,

1375
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:52,353
but empty of their power.
They reveal a pattern of joyful 

1376
01:23:57,131 --> 01:23:59,590
sacrifice,
voluntary death,

1377
01:23:59,950 --> 01:24:01,570
and glorious resurrection.

1378
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:06,910
And they also all agree on this,
that discipleship is the follow the same

1379
01:24:06,911 --> 01:24:07,744
messianic pattern.
They don't emphasize that followers of 

1380
01:24:10,631 --> 01:24:14,860
Jesus performs certain deeds or learn 
certain doctrines.

1381
01:24:15,310 --> 01:24:16,143
They insist rather on living according 
to the same pattern of life and death 

1382
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:25,270
shown by Jesus.
To be a Christian therefore is not about

1383
01:24:25,271 --> 01:24:27,910
dogma.
We've been morality,

1384
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:30,850
although there are dogmatic and ethical 
implications.

1385
01:24:31,330 --> 01:24:33,850
It's not about all that religious 
baggage.

1386
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:37,480
We so often associated with it.
It is to live.

1387
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:43,440
It is for each of us to enact in our 
unique human existence.

1388
01:24:43,810 --> 01:24:47,980
The numinous is to a pattern.
Now,

1389
01:24:47,981 --> 01:24:50,800
there are numerous ways we can describe 
this pattern of prize.

1390
01:24:51,610 --> 01:24:52,443
For instance,
the eastern fathers principal mode of 

1391
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:57,810
exegesis of understanding scripture is 
tychology,

1392
01:24:58,770 --> 01:25:01,030
so we can add to pattern the word 
pattern.

1393
01:25:01,031 --> 01:25:02,860
Another word,
depots or type.

1394
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:08,390
A type is a person and object or an 
event that is connected across space,

1395
01:25:08,391 --> 01:25:09,490
time to others.

1396
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:13,390
Without losing its own historical 
reality and identity,

1397
01:25:13,630 --> 01:25:17,080
it shares in a greater reality of 
meaning,

1398
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:21,640
that greater reality,
which it points a greater reality called

1399
01:25:21,641 --> 01:25:22,474
the anteater.
This is how the apostles and the church 

1400
01:25:25,481 --> 01:25:28,510
fathers read the entire Old Testament.
For example,

1401
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,800
Adam Saint Paul says,
is a t posts a type of Christ,

1402
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:33,933
the first created man pointing forward 
to the recreation of the human rights 

1403
01:25:36,970 --> 01:25:37,803
race in price Jesus.
The exodus narrative as an event is a 

1404
01:25:42,311 --> 01:25:45,530
type of a true Passover or Pascal 
Christ,

1405
01:25:45,531 --> 01:25:49,750
deliverance of old people from suffering
and death in anyone is familiar with the

1406
01:25:49,751 --> 01:25:50,584
writings of the church.
Fathers are of the liturgy of the 

1407
01:25:52,301 --> 01:25:56,480
Orthodox church who know how abundant 
types are within them.

1408
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:58,153
But this is the key.
Topology is not just a way of reading 

1409
01:26:01,601 --> 01:26:06,601
and understanding history in seeing how 
people and Events Point towards Christ.

1410
01:26:08,180 --> 01:26:09,013
Topology is for eastern fathers the 
fundamental structure of reality of a 

1411
01:26:14,031 --> 01:26:16,200
world that is symbolic of an,
uh,

1412
01:26:16,350 --> 01:26:21,350
an epiphany or theophany of God and of 
our own apprehension of this reality,

1413
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:24,740
our own finding of meaning within it.

1414
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:29,840
So it's not just figures from scriptural
history that are types,

1415
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:35,200
we too are cold to typify Christ,
to be symbols of Christ.

1416
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:40,690
Participants in his archetypal journey 
and life is dissent in self offering.

1417
01:26:41,810 --> 01:26:46,280
And he's a scent you Lord.
If we are to be truly human,

1418
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:50,480
we must follow what distinguished 
scholar of this university.

1419
01:26:50,481 --> 01:26:54,800
Northrop Frye calls the u shaped story.
That is the foundation,

1420
01:26:54,801 --> 01:26:58,220
not only a biblical narrative and the 
Christ story,

1421
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:03,880
but a story after story,
Myth after myth in Christ,

1422
01:27:05,150 --> 01:27:10,150
the archetype of archetypes we have in 
the words of Cs Lewis myth become fact.

1423
01:27:12,950 --> 01:27:16,820
As we've already heard this evening in 
the gospel of Saint John,

1424
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:20,960
of course,
this pattern is above all called logos.

1425
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:22,573
It's not an abstract pattern,
but it's a direct and in these latter 

1426
01:27:26,090 --> 01:27:31,090
days in the fullness of time had direct 
incarnate expression of God himself.

1427
01:27:32,150 --> 01:27:35,660
The logos is the principle of order and 
creation as we've heard.

1428
01:27:35,930 --> 01:27:40,250
It's through the logos that God speaks 
and all things are made.

1429
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:43,760
It is logos,
God's verb,

1430
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:44,653
perhaps better than word verb in whose 
image we are creators whose likeness we 

1431
01:27:49,641 --> 01:27:50,474
are called to attain.
And the lesson here is simply this that 

1432
01:27:54,291 --> 01:27:55,124
are properly ordered.
Human life is one lived in accordance 

1433
01:27:59,360 --> 01:28:00,193
with the locals.
The concept of logos has a long and 

1434
01:28:03,561 --> 01:28:04,394
venerable history and it did even before
the Greek translators of the Old 

1435
01:28:07,820 --> 01:28:08,653
Testament and the new testament writers 
appropriated it and one of the first 

1436
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:13,393
hour,
the first of the Greek philosophers to 

1437
01:28:14,391 --> 01:28:15,224
speak of logos was the pre socratic 
hereclitis and he said this to low bu 

1438
01:28:20,510 --> 01:28:24,290
the end.
Those seniors who seen equally,

1439
01:28:24,590 --> 01:28:29,590
although logos is common to all all have
the locals,

1440
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:34,010
the many live as if they had a wisdom of
their own.

1441
01:28:35,780 --> 01:28:40,220
In other words,
lobos may govern the University of Macro

1442
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:43,760
Cosmos and our own inner world,
the Amico Osmoles,

1443
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:47,240
but most people don't choose a properly 
ordered life,

1444
01:28:47,241 --> 01:28:48,074
a life aligned with the compass built 
into the fabric of the world built into 

1445
01:28:51,381 --> 01:28:53,180
their own hearts and minds.

1446
01:28:54,620 --> 01:28:57,890
We've heard already,
we are now in the season of Great Lens.

1447
01:28:57,950 --> 01:29:02,130
The great 40 days is at school and this 
has significances.

1448
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:04,800
It's a season of course,
have a set of labor of renewal.

1449
01:29:04,801 --> 01:29:08,520
If faith redoubling of our commitment to
prayer and the service of others.

1450
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:11,840
It's also the season and preparing 
catechumens apap

1451
01:29:13,410 --> 01:29:14,243
above over.
It's the season where we're called to 

1452
01:29:16,381 --> 01:29:20,520
come to our sense and to awake to the 
fundamental meaning,

1453
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:25,080
shape and pattern of our lives.
We realize our alienation.

1454
01:29:25,650 --> 01:29:30,650
We repent with Tanya,
we embark on our journey of return,

1455
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:32,093
a journey which involves self sacrifice,
a journey which necessarily passes 

1456
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:40,770
through our own voluntary death and 
resurrection.

1457
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:45,270
Lent is in essence the totality of our 
life,

1458
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:48,400
but it requires the remembrance of 
death.

1459
01:29:49,710 --> 01:29:54,710
It was a famous practice in ancient Rome
as a general came back victorious from a

1460
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:55,764
battle and during his triumphant parade 
receive compliments and honors from the 

1461
01:30:00,511 --> 01:30:01,680
crowd of citizens.

1462
01:30:01,740 --> 01:30:06,690
He ran the risk of falling victim to his
own pride and delusions of grand jury.

1463
01:30:06,691 --> 01:30:10,050
And to avoid that,
a slave would be placed just behind him,

1464
01:30:10,051 --> 01:30:12,180
whispering into his ear saying,
hey,

1465
01:30:12,181 --> 01:30:14,660
speech a post post-stay onm team 
momentum.

1466
01:30:14,661 --> 01:30:18,510
We'll look after you to the time of your
death and remember,

1467
01:30:18,630 --> 01:30:19,463
you're only a man thereafter.
It was enshrined and picked up in 

1468
01:30:22,741 --> 01:30:26,910
Christian tradition as Memento Mori.
Remember that you will die,

1469
01:30:28,470 --> 01:30:33,470
but better yet remember to
remember to write and think we need that

1470
01:30:36,151 --> 01:30:36,984
remembers,
but maybe because eventually all of us 

1471
01:30:39,541 --> 01:30:40,374
will probably improve equal to the task 
but remember to die because remember to 

1472
01:30:45,721 --> 01:30:46,554
find and follow the logos,
the pattern of our true life which 

1473
01:30:49,771 --> 01:30:50,604
passes through death to resurrection,
very frequent theme and patristic 

1474
01:30:55,621 --> 01:30:56,760
tradition.
Saint Gregory,

1475
01:30:56,761 --> 01:31:01,761
the theologian often repeats the saying 
of Plato which suggests that the present

1476
01:31:01,801 --> 01:31:02,634
life or to be a meditation on death and 
he advised his friend for luxurious to 

1477
01:31:07,711 --> 01:31:08,544
live instead of the present the future 
and make this life a meditation and 

1478
01:31:11,971 --> 01:31:14,790
practice of death and could go on from 
the church fathers,

1479
01:31:15,010 --> 01:31:15,843
the focus on death is front and center 
remembrance of our journey that passes 

1480
01:31:21,721 --> 01:31:23,190
from death to life.

1481
01:31:23,190 --> 01:31:27,120
This is also the connection of lent with
a preparation for baptism.

1482
01:31:27,810 --> 01:31:28,643
Baptism in its deepest in primary sense 
signifies death and burial and 

1483
01:31:33,751 --> 01:31:37,170
resurrection with Christ.
This is very clear in Romans chapter six

1484
01:31:37,290 --> 01:31:40,020
the epistle which we read on the eve of 
Easter,

1485
01:31:40,021 --> 01:31:43,230
Costco,
we have been baptized into Christ death.

1486
01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:46,830
We have been buried with him by baptism 
into death.

1487
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:47,753
We have been united to Christ in a death
like his and united to him and as a 

1488
01:31:51,870 --> 01:31:56,870
resurrection like his.
So baptism means death and resurrection.

1489
01:31:57,001 --> 01:32:02,001
Saint Gregory of Nissa says the is both 
to and mother

1490
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:04,973
you Orthodox theologian Paul Ever hemos 
writes about this is the extended 

1491
01:32:09,991 --> 01:32:13,190
quotation if you're there with me and 
just him,

1492
01:32:13,220 --> 01:32:14,053
he says,
means sharing mystically in Christ's 

1493
01:32:15,571 --> 01:32:16,404
death and his burial,
but also in what happened between his 

1494
01:32:21,331 --> 01:32:24,730
burial and his resurrection,
his descent.

1495
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:28,410
He's a hell.
What is the meaning of the incarnation?

1496
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:29,513
God becoming truly human in Christ 
identifies himself with all human 

1497
01:32:33,601 --> 01:32:35,610
anguish,
alienation,

1498
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:39,060
and despair in the garden of get 70 he 
says,

1499
01:32:39,061 --> 01:32:43,230
my soul is exceedingly sorrow.
Even unto death.

1500
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:46,200
You shares in the fullness of human 
pain.

1501
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:49,350
He enters into the fullness not only of 
human life,

1502
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:50,873
but if human death,
and we are to understand Christ descent 

1503
01:32:54,211 --> 01:32:55,044
into hell as being the full expression 
of God's solidarity with our human 

1504
01:32:58,951 --> 01:32:59,784
alienation.
Christ descends into the hell of human 

1505
01:33:02,461 --> 01:33:04,440
suffering.
And if human loneliness,

1506
01:33:04,470 --> 01:33:06,180
loneliness,
a human despair,

1507
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:09,120
surely he has borne our griefs.

1508
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:10,193
And carried our sorrows as we read in 
the book of Isaiah and we may add that 

1509
01:33:13,711 --> 01:33:18,380
Christ has worn all,
all our silos.

1510
01:33:19,050 --> 01:33:19,883
There was a total identification here 
and unreserved solidarity of priced our 

1511
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:28,431
God in our human fallenness.
He who is sinless yet became sin for us.

1512
01:33:28,860 --> 01:33:32,250
He became one with us in our foreman's 
age as the Paul says,

1513
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:35,280
and that is part of the meaning of this 
descent into hell.

1514
01:33:35,730 --> 01:33:40,730
All things are full of uh,
even hell though I go down to hell,

1515
01:33:41,010 --> 01:33:46,010
thou art there also maybe you so much,
38 so when we are baptized,

1516
01:33:47,620 --> 01:33:50,730
he love continues.
We just send it priced into hell.

1517
01:33:51,150 --> 01:33:54,780
We also commit ourselves in solidarity 
with price to the scene.

1518
01:33:54,810 --> 01:33:58,290
Total unreserved identification with 
those who suffer.

1519
01:33:58,770 --> 01:34:03,180
Each of the baptize becomes by virtue of
his descent into hell with Christ,

1520
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:04,073
a man or a woman for others.
Each of us is called to bear the griefs 

1521
01:34:08,671 --> 01:34:13,671
of others is it carry their sorrow.
He a Christian ne to be a human requires

1522
01:34:17,521 --> 01:34:18,354
us to journey to hell.
It is in use terms to journey to hell 

1523
01:34:22,830 --> 01:34:23,663
and become hell oneself.
That's how we can make sense of the 

1524
01:34:27,681 --> 01:34:32,480
words of a great elder of the 20th 
century seems sort of Rooney who went as

1525
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:33,620
a young man,
asked him,

1526
01:34:33,621 --> 01:34:34,454
how will we be saved?
Answered he your mind in Hell and just 

1527
01:34:39,091 --> 01:34:39,924
bearing on

1528
01:34:41,430 --> 01:34:42,263
why can't,
why this archetyping descent before 

1529
01:34:45,141 --> 01:34:45,974
ascending?
Why The you pattern of Christ that we 

1530
01:34:48,561 --> 01:34:51,170
must follow,
um,

1531
01:34:51,260 --> 01:34:54,410
as in how much her of physics,
if you will indulge me.

1532
01:34:54,411 --> 01:34:55,244
Let me offer a metaphor from physics.
And I'm this from a scholar of Orthodox 

1533
01:34:59,181 --> 01:35:04,181
Christian liturgy.
David bigger book archimedes was a Greek

1534
01:35:04,281 --> 01:35:07,460
physicist who was fascinated by the 
mechanic and mathematics.

1535
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:08,593
The lever,
and you may remember from your science 

1536
01:35:10,671 --> 01:35:11,504
classes and simple machines that are 
lever is used to exert a large force 

1537
01:35:14,991 --> 01:35:15,824
over a small distance.
I exerting a small force over a greater 

1538
01:35:19,701 --> 01:35:20,534
distance at the other end or a child and
that's lift with one hand and a man 

1539
01:35:25,281 --> 01:35:26,114
standing on the shore.
And if the child presses down on the 

1540
01:35:29,151 --> 01:35:29,984
long,
archimedes was so fascinated by the 

1541
01:35:33,081 --> 01:35:35,690
leavers potential.
Then one day he famously swing,

1542
01:35:36,020 --> 01:35:38,840
give me a lever and a place to stand.
Am I?

1543
01:35:38,841 --> 01:35:39,740
Shall move.

1544
01:35:40,290 --> 01:35:41,123
Okay.

1545
01:35:42,620 --> 01:35:45,620
And he realized three things in order to
move here,

1546
01:35:45,830 --> 01:35:46,663
a long enough lever,
a correctly placed fulcrum points and a 

1547
01:35:50,421 --> 01:35:51,254
place to stay.
But that of course was the problem when 

1548
01:35:54,261 --> 01:35:57,590
it comes to moving the earth.
How could he apply leverage to the world

1549
01:35:57,620 --> 01:36:00,090
when he himself was standing on the 
world?

1550
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:03,620
How could he step off the thing he lives
on in order to move it?

1551
01:36:04,190 --> 01:36:07,160
He has no footing.
So in philosophy,

1552
01:36:07,161 --> 01:36:10,380
the riddle becomes known as searching 
for the archimedean point.

1553
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:11,713
That is an objective standpoint.
Removed from the object of study is 

1554
01:36:15,291 --> 01:36:16,124
hypothetical point of perspective is 
thought to be far enough removed from 

1555
01:36:18,381 --> 01:36:21,640
something in order to afford an 
outsider's view of it.

1556
01:36:22,030 --> 01:36:22,863
How can we remove ourselves to a point 
of site oh seven this is our human 

1557
01:36:28,221 --> 01:36:29,054
condition.
A gustin defines sin as Info vacs was 

1558
01:36:33,291 --> 01:36:36,980
insane.
Being curved in upon oneself.

1559
01:36:37,340 --> 01:36:38,173
I like oriented inwardly towards self 
rather than outward towards scarf and 

1560
01:36:43,521 --> 01:36:44,354
others are egocentrism exert so strong 
gravitational pull that it bends the 

1561
01:36:49,581 --> 01:36:50,414
light of glory back on ourselves.
That light that should be glorifying 

1562
01:36:53,691 --> 01:36:54,524
God.
How can we move ourselves off center 

1563
01:36:57,880 --> 01:37:02,770
movie or the center of our universe?
We have no leverage overseeing.

1564
01:37:03,290 --> 01:37:06,590
We have new standpoint outside our 
vanity and pride.

1565
01:37:06,830 --> 01:37:09,650
We have no rock on which to stand that 
is beyond ourselves.

1566
01:37:09,651 --> 01:37:13,490
Interests,
whoever desires to get outside himself,

1567
01:37:13,790 --> 01:37:16,820
eat some sort of our Canadian points,
the owns and stuff,

1568
01:37:18,810 --> 01:37:19,643
our self offering and are just sent to 
hell is precisely this archimedean 

1569
01:37:24,990 --> 01:37:27,450
point.
If we are to lift the war,

1570
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:29,033
if we are to transform the world into a 
true symbol and epiphany of God's own 

1571
01:37:32,281 --> 01:37:34,800
life and when he was first,
he said,

1572
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:36,383
we cannot lift up the world in 
sacrificial trace along as we placed in 

1573
01:37:39,220 --> 01:37:43,240
our footing on the world alone,
it's like trying to lift the carpeting.

1574
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:45,620
Why we stand on it.
Archimedes,

1575
01:37:45,640 --> 01:37:46,473
his problem was applying leverage to a 
world that he could not step off of in 

1576
01:37:49,321 --> 01:37:50,190
order to move it.

1577
01:37:50,980 --> 01:37:51,970
Well,
we can.

1578
01:37:53,130 --> 01:37:56,430
I dying with Christ.
We freed from the roads.

1579
01:37:56,730 --> 01:37:59,070
We leave the world's for the sake of the
world.

1580
01:37:59,310 --> 01:38:03,600
We die so that we in the world with us,
they live.

1581
01:38:04,350 --> 01:38:08,190
This is not nearly our spiritual life,
our religious vocation,

1582
01:38:08,191 --> 01:38:11,940
some crazy notion dreamed up by men with
black dresses

1583
01:38:15,930 --> 01:38:18,780
are true life.
It is our proper life.

1584
01:38:18,810 --> 01:38:19,643
It is our life ordered according to the 
logos and it is a journey we must 

1585
01:38:24,630 --> 01:38:27,090
undertake.
We undertake not on our own,

1586
01:38:27,510 --> 01:38:28,343
the only in Christ or Christ and Christ 
alone is the one who took that journey 

1587
01:38:32,670 --> 01:38:37,140
so that we could be reconciled to God.
In closing,

1588
01:38:37,141 --> 01:38:40,530
I would like to turn to one of the 
greatest in my own estimation,

1589
01:38:40,531 --> 01:38:41,364
poets of the past century,
one who saw deeply into these realities 

1590
01:38:44,971 --> 01:38:48,480
of locals and journey through death and 
resurrection.

1591
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:51,580
He his poem,
the wasteland,

1592
01:38:51,810 --> 01:38:55,460
Tsl,
he depicts a bleak world.

1593
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:58,650
It's a world in which we fail to take up
our journey,

1594
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:00,233
where we stay put amidst the 
civilization that's been reduced to a 

1595
01:39:03,421 --> 01:39:08,160
wasteland that has lost its fertility 
and its ability to bring forth life.

1596
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:13,880
The world is filled.
He says with a heat of broken images and

1597
01:39:15,061 --> 01:39:15,894
the dead tree gives no shelter.
There is no easy fix and certainly 

1598
01:39:20,521 --> 01:39:23,550
nothing in that civilization or society 
could offer.

1599
01:39:25,110 --> 01:39:27,990
There no levels.
It's such a world.

1600
01:39:28,020 --> 01:39:32,760
Sound familiar to us today.
We need to look at Elliot spinal work,

1601
01:39:32,890 --> 01:39:37,160
the four quartets for hope of renewal 
and spiritual replenishing,

1602
01:39:38,010 --> 01:39:40,440
telling me above this series of four 
posts.

1603
01:39:40,441 --> 01:39:44,880
The last thing he wrote,
he's inscribed those words of hereclitis

1604
01:39:44,881 --> 01:39:45,714
that I mentioned before.
Although logos is common and many live 

1605
01:39:48,931 --> 01:39:52,260
as if they had wisdom of their own 
elliot headset.

1606
01:39:53,370 --> 01:39:54,203
The solution to our wasteland is not 
your new civilization per se on its own 

1607
01:39:58,951 --> 01:39:59,784
terms,
but a journey undertaken in the pattern 

1608
01:40:02,551 --> 01:40:07,430
of the logos.
He says this,

1609
01:40:07,730 --> 01:40:09,470
it's a symbol perfected.

1610
01:40:10,150 --> 01:40:10,983
Yeah,

1611
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,410
all shall be well and all manner of 
things shall be well by the purification

1612
01:40:16,411 --> 01:40:21,411
of the motive in the ground of RBC CIBC,
he goes on to evoke an image,

1613
01:40:22,341 --> 01:40:24,710
this beautiful image of the fire of the 
Holy Spirit,

1614
01:40:24,711 --> 01:40:27,650
purifying as a de horrifying the world 
is.

1615
01:40:27,651 --> 01:40:31,710
It just says as a dog and he ends with 
this on a whole.

1616
01:40:31,711 --> 01:40:32,544
For them in which descends to death is 
the source of life and meaning and 

1617
01:40:36,771 --> 01:40:37,700
transformation.

1618
01:40:39,250 --> 01:40:42,700
We die with the dying.
See,

1619
01:40:42,701 --> 01:40:47,440
they depart and we go with them.
We are born with the Dead Sea,

1620
01:40:47,441 --> 01:40:52,180
they return and bring us with them.
The moment of the rose and the moment of

1621
01:40:52,181 --> 01:40:53,014
the huge tree equals your Asian people 
without history is not redeemed from 

1622
01:40:57,401 --> 01:41:01,360
time for history is a pattern of 
timeless moments.

1623
01:41:01,990 --> 01:41:06,950
So while the light fails on a winter's 
afternoon in a secluded chapel,

1624
01:41:06,970 --> 01:41:11,970
history is now and be the drawing of 
this love and the voice of this call,

1625
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:19,780
we shall not cease from exploration.
And the end of all our exploring will be

1626
01:41:19,781 --> 01:41:20,614
to arrive where we started
and know the place for the first time 

1627
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:29,433
through the unknown remembered gates.
When the last of the earth left to 

1628
01:41:32,261 --> 01:41:37,210
discover is that which was the beginning
at the source of the longest river,

1629
01:41:37,211 --> 01:41:40,600
the voice of the hidden waterfall and 
the children and the apple tree.

1630
01:41:40,830 --> 01:41:41,663
No,
no,

1631
01:41:42,280 --> 01:41:47,280
because not looked for but her half.
It's still miss between two waves of the

1632
01:41:47,801 --> 01:41:50,500
sea
here.

1633
01:41:51,130 --> 01:41:51,963
Always condition of complete simplicity,
costing not less and everything and all 

1634
01:41:58,931 --> 01:41:59,764
shall be well and all manner of things 
shall be well when the tongues of flame 

1635
01:42:03,641 --> 01:42:06,390
or enfolded into the crown at and off 
the fire.

1636
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:09,100
And the fire and rose

1637
01:42:18,050 --> 01:42:23,050
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1638
01:42:29,010 --> 01:42:32,200
what an amazing engine to artists 
commissions.

1639
01:42:32,230 --> 01:42:34,570
And I just get another round of applause
for all our patterns.

1640
01:42:34,790 --> 01:42:39,790
[inaudible]

1641
01:42:45,410 --> 01:42:49,850
so it's eight 47 right now,
but just letting you guys know,

1642
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:50,833
even though a,
the event says that the event ends at 

1643
01:42:53,271 --> 01:42:58,271
9:00 PM we do have the room til 10,
so we have plenty of time for questions.

1644
01:42:58,890 --> 01:43:01,430
Um,
so with that said,

1645
01:43:01,730 --> 01:43:06,730
if you guys have anymore questions that 
develop along the way,

1646
01:43:06,771 --> 01:43:09,680
you can just write them down and asked 
them up.

1647
01:43:09,740 --> 01:43:10,573
And I always try to get to as many as 
possible and if I'd ask the questions 

1648
01:43:14,121 --> 01:43:19,121
that kind of answer as many other 
questions as possible.

1649
01:43:20,150 --> 01:43:25,150
So with that said,
and this question does not adjust to any

1650
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:27,153
analysts in particular by whichever of 
you feels like you would like to answer 

1651
01:43:31,101 --> 01:43:32,720
this question.
Um,

1652
01:43:32,780 --> 01:43:33,613
the do.
So a statue in Rome depicts the 

1653
01:43:35,751 --> 01:43:40,280
suffering of the Trojan priest Lado Con,
I'm pronouncing that correctly.

1654
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:41,353
And his sons,
unlike the noble suffering of Christ on 

1655
01:43:46,110 --> 01:43:46,943
sufferer,
lot of sufferings science seems neither 

1656
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:52,040
awarded nor justified.
Do these two

1657
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:57,040
differing visions of suffering form part
of the divide between postmodernists and

1658
01:43:57,231 --> 01:44:02,231
their opponents and do the postmodernist
justify their nihilism and or believe in

1659
01:44:02,961 --> 01:44:03,794
other ideologies by pointing to the 
pointless suffering a lot of time and 

1660
01:44:07,341 --> 01:44:11,430
others like him.
You don't have a harder question.

1661
01:44:13,730 --> 01:44:14,563
He'll be answering this

1662
01:44:17,890 --> 01:44:20,700
like to
anyone.

1663
01:44:24,790 --> 01:44:28,640
It's about sculpture.
Well meaning,

1664
01:44:28,780 --> 01:44:31,870
well,
indeck is just meaningless suffering.

1665
01:44:33,490 --> 01:44:38,230
Is that the core of the postmodern 
understanding goats,

1666
01:44:38,680 --> 01:44:39,610
the problems in the world?

1667
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:49,260
I don't know if it's at the core,
precisely

1668
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:55,200
of the postmodernists view.
I think it's at the core of

1669
01:44:56,850 --> 01:44:57,683
the problem that every human being has 
with manifesting sufficient faith to 

1670
01:45:01,141 --> 01:45:02,490
engage fully in life.

1671
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:09,580
We look at our lives and the lives of 
others and we see that the one certainty

1672
01:45:09,831 --> 01:45:14,831
is suffering and loss and we're at least
in principle,

1673
01:45:14,991 --> 01:45:16,910
the only creatures that are aware of 
that.

1674
01:45:16,940 --> 01:45:20,120
That's really the story in genesis of 
Adam and eve.

1675
01:45:20,121 --> 01:45:20,954
Right?
Because Adam and eve wake up and become 

1676
01:45:22,641 --> 01:45:23,474
aware of their own nakedness there 
finitude your mortality and that throws 

1677
01:45:28,151 --> 01:45:30,470
them out of the paradise of being and 
that's,

1678
01:45:30,490 --> 01:45:31,323
that's precisely right.
That's the situation we all find 

1679
01:45:33,081 --> 01:45:33,914
ourselves in.
The fundamental question is all that 

1680
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:41,630
without ultimate meaning.
And it's a very profound question.

1681
01:45:42,540 --> 01:45:43,373
Yeah.

1682
01:45:44,330 --> 01:45:45,163
The answer seems to be something like 
it's without meaning unless you take it 

1683
01:45:47,811 --> 01:45:50,360
on voluntarily.
And I don't,

1684
01:45:50,810 --> 01:45:54,830
I certainly don't understand the full 
implications of that answer,

1685
01:45:54,831 --> 01:45:55,664
although I know that in so far as you 
can test that as a theory in your own 

1686
01:46:00,531 --> 01:46:02,930
life,
it seems extraordinarily robust.

1687
01:46:05,380 --> 01:46:05,850
Yeah.

1688
01:46:05,850 --> 01:46:07,800
To the degree that it's a postmodern 
issue,

1689
01:46:07,801 --> 01:46:08,634
I think that the postmodernists 
postmodernists feed us very thin rule 

1690
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:18,440
because they offer nothing in the face 
of that suffering except the collapse of

1691
01:46:20,501 --> 01:46:23,360
everything into the sound that Jonathan 
spoke up.

1692
01:46:26,050 --> 01:46:27,670
That's the best I can do with that.

1693
01:46:29,460 --> 01:46:30,293
Great.

1694
01:46:34,050 --> 01:46:34,883
To Mr Patio,
how do your icons and icons and general 

1695
01:46:38,941 --> 01:46:43,440
function on their day to day search for 
the logos?

1696
01:46:51,810 --> 01:46:52,643
MMM,

1697
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:54,350
I think,
I think they,

1698
01:46:54,510 --> 01:46:57,490
there's many ways in which they 
function.

1699
01:46:58,110 --> 01:46:58,760
Okay.

1700
01:46:58,760 --> 01:46:59,593
Uh,
one of the things that I did I talked 

1701
01:47:01,881 --> 01:47:02,714
about is the idea that the,
the path of logos is a path of coming 

1702
01:47:06,951 --> 01:47:11,450
together.
And one of the things that icons provide

1703
01:47:11,451 --> 01:47:16,451
is that image of coming together.
So when you engage with an icon,

1704
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:21,260
especially in a church where there are 
many icons and many saints,

1705
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:22,333
then you get that sense of uh,
your path being one in which you are in 

1706
01:47:28,311 --> 01:47:31,400
communion with others.
And so for Orthodox Christian,

1707
01:47:31,401 --> 01:47:33,800
for example,
when we prayed before icons,

1708
01:47:33,801 --> 01:47:34,510
we,
we,

1709
01:47:34,510 --> 01:47:38,630
we pray before them because through the,
through those images,

1710
01:47:38,870 --> 01:47:39,800
we,
um,

1711
01:47:43,150 --> 01:47:44,020
we can,
we can,

1712
01:47:44,021 --> 01:47:46,240
how can I say this in a,
in a way that can,

1713
01:47:46,241 --> 01:47:47,074
everybody can understand.
So the image becomes a vehicle for the 

1714
01:47:49,511 --> 01:47:52,780
presence of that person into our prayer 
lives.

1715
01:47:52,781 --> 01:47:55,510
And there's this relationship which is,
which is set up.

1716
01:47:55,720 --> 01:47:59,800
And so that's,
that is how we live with icons and icons

1717
01:47:59,801 --> 01:48:00,980
become a,
a,

1718
01:48:00,981 --> 01:48:04,000
a vehicle for that,
for that path towards,

1719
01:48:04,150 --> 01:48:06,640
towards unity.
So I hope that helps.

1720
01:48:06,641 --> 01:48:07,421
That's on,
let's say,

1721
01:48:07,421 --> 01:48:10,210
on a experiential,
a sense,

1722
01:48:10,211 --> 01:48:11,044
I think in a technical sense,
in terms of the making of icons for 

1723
01:48:13,961 --> 01:48:15,740
myself,
uh,

1724
01:48:16,360 --> 01:48:17,193
for me that's what they have done 
exactly is that my struggle in life 

1725
01:48:22,090 --> 01:48:27,090
before I became orthodox was how to fit 
art that I loved into my life.

1726
01:48:29,530 --> 01:48:32,650
How to make that fit and how for it to 
all come together.

1727
01:48:32,830 --> 01:48:35,410
And in discovering the language of 
traditional Christian art,

1728
01:48:35,620 --> 01:48:36,453
I found how here's this art,
which is both grounded in absolute 

1729
01:48:40,031 --> 01:48:44,290
practical use in the lives of people.

1730
01:48:44,290 --> 01:48:46,210
It's,
it's used in people's devotions.

1731
01:48:46,211 --> 01:48:49,030
It's using the church to teach and to 
participate in the liturgy.

1732
01:48:49,330 --> 01:48:50,163
Uh,
and at the same time I can participate 

1733
01:48:52,361 --> 01:48:54,610
in that by making them,
uniting me with,

1734
01:48:54,790 --> 01:48:58,900
with the tradition of all the fathers 
before me uniting you with the church.

1735
01:48:59,050 --> 01:49:00,820
And at the same time,
these images,

1736
01:49:00,821 --> 01:49:01,654
what they're talking about and what 
they're revealing is that ultimate 

1737
01:49:04,570 --> 01:49:05,403
reality,
that reality that is beyond all 

1738
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:10,600
realities.
And so being able for myself,

1739
01:49:10,601 --> 01:49:15,601
I feel great blessing to have the chance
and have the,

1740
01:49:16,020 --> 01:49:16,853
uh,
the blessing of the church to be able 

1741
01:49:17,951 --> 01:49:19,360
to,
to do that for a living.

1742
01:49:19,361 --> 01:49:22,930
It's amazing every day I get to 
participate in that process.

1743
01:49:23,230 --> 01:49:24,070
And so,
uh,

1744
01:49:24,130 --> 01:49:26,080
that's my other answer to that question.

1745
01:49:31,930 --> 01:49:32,763
Okay.

1746
01:49:34,410 --> 01:49:35,243
Just quickly to add to that point,
icons in the Orthodox church or not 

1747
01:49:39,571 --> 01:49:42,570
merely seen,
but they teach us to see,

1748
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:45,450
um,
you will have noted that there is a,

1749
01:49:46,290 --> 01:49:50,200
they're not just an aesthetically 
beautiful medium.

1750
01:49:50,420 --> 01:49:52,720
They have a kind of stylization even,
uh,

1751
01:49:52,780 --> 01:49:54,850
even though the mini styles of 
iconography,

1752
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:55,833
they share a characteristic and that 
there is something about them that 

1753
01:49:59,201 --> 01:50:04,201
forces the viewer to reflect and to come
to a new way of seeing.

1754
01:50:05,620 --> 01:50:06,453
So icons are not merely symbols as such,
but they teach us to understand all of 

1755
01:50:11,441 --> 01:50:14,410
reality in that symbolic sense that I 
spoke of earlier,

1756
01:50:14,411 --> 01:50:18,430
that everything ultimately isn't 
referencing itself.

1757
01:50:18,670 --> 01:50:19,503
That's the problem that we are in.
That things have become self 

1758
01:50:21,921 --> 01:50:25,360
referential,
that everything in the world is an icon,

1759
01:50:25,361 --> 01:50:26,194
is a symbol of God.
And it's referring to something much 

1760
01:50:29,081 --> 01:50:33,430
more than what it is beyond itself 
without losing its identity.

1761
01:50:33,431 --> 01:50:37,480
So icons teach us that vision not just 
depicted.

1762
01:50:37,870 --> 01:50:39,690
That makes sense to teach us a way of 
seeing.

1763
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:44,730
Just a quick reminder that I'm following
up on a professional.

1764
01:50:44,731 --> 01:50:46,240
Peterson said,
um,

1765
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:52,400
there's the average person wants to take
the easy route,

1766
01:50:53,010 --> 01:50:53,843
right?
So when you take a look at icons and 

1767
01:50:55,831 --> 01:50:56,664
Orthodox church,
there's a lot of people who've never 

1768
01:50:57,121 --> 01:50:57,901
seen them before.
They say,

1769
01:50:57,901 --> 01:50:58,740
well,
those are weird.

1770
01:50:58,741 --> 01:50:58,961
They,
they,

1771
01:50:58,961 --> 01:51:01,230
they're not realistic.
They're very strange looking.

1772
01:51:01,580 --> 01:51:04,320
Uh,
they're done on purpose because the icon

1773
01:51:04,321 --> 01:51:06,030
involves you.
Okay?

1774
01:51:06,150 --> 01:51:09,700
It forces engagement with the local,
well,

1775
01:51:09,740 --> 01:51:10,573
we've been speaking about tonight 
because from the colors that are used 

1776
01:51:13,531 --> 01:51:14,940
to,
you know,

1777
01:51:14,970 --> 01:51:18,390
the subtle code that exists within 
iconography that,

1778
01:51:18,391 --> 01:51:19,410
okay,
if you haven't studied it,

1779
01:51:19,411 --> 01:51:20,244
you wouldn't know.
But if for the people who read up on it 

1780
01:51:21,631 --> 01:51:24,140
and begin to engage,
um,

1781
01:51:24,690 --> 01:51:25,523
it forces you to read the icon and to 
get deeper and deeper into what it's 

1782
01:51:28,471 --> 01:51:30,570
trying to tell you.
Even the prospective.

1783
01:51:30,571 --> 01:51:32,970
And Jonathan knows us very well in most 
icons,

1784
01:51:32,971 --> 01:51:35,160
not all,
but in most Byzantine icons,

1785
01:51:35,370 --> 01:51:38,940
the perspective is even reversed and if 
those of you are taking basic art,

1786
01:51:39,450 --> 01:51:41,940
you know vanishing point is far away,
right?

1787
01:51:41,940 --> 01:51:44,160
Things get further away when you get,
when you get,

1788
01:51:44,280 --> 01:51:45,113
when you look,
when you look into the distance and 

1789
01:51:46,531 --> 01:51:48,000
things get bigger when they get closer 
to you.

1790
01:51:48,210 --> 01:51:50,670
But if you look at the geometry of an 
icon,

1791
01:51:51,070 --> 01:51:52,920
a lot of times you'll see that it's 
reversed.

1792
01:51:52,950 --> 01:51:53,551
Wait,
why?

1793
01:51:53,551 --> 01:51:56,220
Because the vanishing point is actually 
pointing towards you,

1794
01:51:57,360 --> 01:52:01,950
towards the viewer,
which means that when you look at it,

1795
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:03,353
you become part of it and the 
orientation of the icon is actually 

1796
01:52:06,541 --> 01:52:09,030
looking at you.
You're not just looking at the icon.

1797
01:52:09,210 --> 01:52:10,043
The icon is looking at you and that 
forces a type of involvement and it's 

1798
01:52:13,711 --> 01:52:15,810
hard work because if the learn how to 
read it,

1799
01:52:16,230 --> 01:52:19,830
you can't just look at it and I don't 
want to contrast it as with with,

1800
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:20,873
for example,
renaissance painting as as better or 

1801
01:52:22,291 --> 01:52:23,580
worse.
It's just two different things.

1802
01:52:23,581 --> 01:52:24,780
But when you look at renaissance 
painting,

1803
01:52:25,170 --> 01:52:27,720
it's realism.
It's just,

1804
01:52:27,990 --> 01:52:32,040
it's there to depict what exists as it 
is.

1805
01:52:32,130 --> 01:52:32,963
And there's not a lot of work there.
There's a lot of work from us from a 

1806
01:52:34,441 --> 01:52:37,170
technical point of view.
But to look at it,

1807
01:52:37,860 --> 01:52:38,640
you know,
there's,

1808
01:52:38,640 --> 01:52:40,620
it is what it is.
It stops there.

1809
01:52:40,650 --> 01:52:42,570
Whereas the icon,
as Jonathan was saying,

1810
01:52:42,770 --> 01:52:45,410
it kind of reveals another world,

1811
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:49,220
the world that could be the world that 
we would want to be.

1812
01:52:49,730 --> 01:52:50,650
Um,
and,

1813
01:52:50,690 --> 01:52:51,523
and,
and that is a beautiful thing because 

1814
01:52:52,371 --> 01:52:55,310
it's a constant engagement with,
with um,

1815
01:52:55,430 --> 01:52:59,750
with our hope in the eternal.

1816
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:04,133
Thank you.

1817
01:53:05,260 --> 01:53:06,093
This question is for Jordan Peterson.
Can you comment on the cyclical or non 

1818
01:53:10,691 --> 01:53:11,524
cyclical pattern of history and if our 
society is doomed to decay or can it be 

1819
01:53:15,981 --> 01:53:17,380
renewed culturally?

1820
01:53:17,790 --> 01:53:18,623
Oh,

1821
01:53:20,030 --> 01:53:23,030
in order of society,
state and laws.

1822
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:26,333
Okay.

1823
01:53:33,170 --> 01:53:34,003
Well,
I would say it's cyclical at every 

1824
01:53:36,321 --> 01:53:37,154
moment.
In some sense it's nested patterns of 

1825
01:53:40,761 --> 01:53:41,594
cyclicality and I think you can hear 
that best in the best representation 

1826
01:53:46,281 --> 01:53:49,520
I've ever seen of that is inbox 
Brandenburg concertos.

1827
01:53:49,960 --> 01:53:51,820
Here.
They're really worth a listen.

1828
01:53:51,870 --> 01:53:55,730
Um,
the new videos I'm going to release that

1829
01:53:55,731 --> 01:53:59,390
I'm doing with interviews use Bach's 
third Brandenburg Concerto,

1830
01:53:59,391 --> 01:54:00,224
which is an absolutely phenomenal piece 
of music because it its cycles and 

1831
01:54:04,401 --> 01:54:07,910
climbs continually and stays in the same
place.

1832
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,730
I have no idea how he managed it.
It's,

1833
01:54:09,731 --> 01:54:14,060
it's absolutely overwhelming and that's 
what history is like.

1834
01:54:14,450 --> 01:54:16,790
The apocalypse is always on us,
right?

1835
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:17,713
I mean,
you all confront an apocalyptic 

1836
01:54:19,161 --> 01:54:19,994
yesterday because you're all going to 
die and everything comes to an end and 

1837
01:54:24,291 --> 01:54:25,124
everything is continually regenerate it.
And so that cyclicality is built into 

1838
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:29,653
every moment.
That's the u shaped journey that 

1839
01:54:31,491 --> 01:54:32,324
northrop Frye talked about too,
which is order a descent into chaos and 

1840
01:54:35,961 --> 01:54:36,794
the reestablishment of order and 
everyone knows what that means in their 

1841
01:54:39,441 --> 01:54:40,130
own life.

1842
01:54:40,130 --> 01:54:40,963
You're somewhere stable where you 
understand everything and things are 

1843
01:54:44,451 --> 01:54:48,290
going well for you and then the rug is 
pulled out from underneath your feet and

1844
01:54:48,291 --> 01:54:50,810
you don't know where you are or you fall
into chaos.

1845
01:54:50,840 --> 01:54:51,673
Someone close to you dies or you don't 
get the promotion you were looking for 

1846
01:54:54,500 --> 01:54:55,333
some dream collapses on you.
You discover a new fault that you were 

1847
01:54:58,041 --> 01:55:01,580
never aware of before and you fall into 
this chaotic state.

1848
01:55:01,581 --> 01:55:02,414
And in that chaotic state,
that's the underworld of mythology and 

1849
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:08,540
one of the suburbs of the,
of the underworld,

1850
01:55:08,541 --> 01:55:11,480
the most horrific suburb of the 
underworld is hell.

1851
01:55:11,510 --> 01:55:14,600
Because when you go into the underworld 
in chaos,

1852
01:55:14,870 --> 01:55:15,703
it's easy to become desperate and then 
angry and then vengeful and then 

1853
01:55:18,261 --> 01:55:19,094
murderous.
And that that happens to people with a 

1854
01:55:21,261 --> 01:55:24,170
tremendous,
tremendous frequency.

1855
01:55:24,171 --> 01:55:26,120
If you haven't observed that in your own
life,

1856
01:55:26,121 --> 01:55:30,800
you haven't watched your own interior 
interior landscape with,

1857
01:55:30,860 --> 01:55:35,390
with any degree of accuracy.
And so that cyclicality is,

1858
01:55:35,750 --> 01:55:39,560
is built into everything and it's the 
structure of,

1859
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:42,410
it's the structure of being that's the 
right way to think about it.

1860
01:55:42,420 --> 01:55:43,960
And okay.
No,

1861
01:55:43,961 --> 01:55:44,100
I,

1862
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:44,933
I think the optimistic part of that is 
that there is a spiral upward as far as 

1863
01:55:48,611 --> 01:55:50,230
I can tell her.
At least there can be.

1864
01:55:50,231 --> 01:55:53,980
And you get some sense of that when,
when you participate in your own life,

1865
01:55:53,981 --> 01:55:56,920
in the sense that you've found a good 
direction and that's,

1866
01:55:56,980 --> 01:55:59,920
that's in viewing you with a sense of 
positive meaning.

1867
01:56:00,100 --> 01:56:00,933
And I really regard,
I don't regard positive meaning as a 

1868
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:04,353
epic,
phenomenal manifestation of a deeper 

1869
01:56:06,161 --> 01:56:08,740
material reality.
I don't believe that's true at all.

1870
01:56:09,010 --> 01:56:12,190
I believe that there is nothing more 
real than that sense of,

1871
01:56:12,490 --> 01:56:15,730
of engaged meaning.
I think your nervous system has actually

1872
01:56:15,731 --> 01:56:20,140
evolved to tell you when you're in the 
right place at the right time.

1873
01:56:20,141 --> 01:56:24,670
It's something that informs you.
It's literally beyond your census,

1874
01:56:24,671 --> 01:56:25,504
but,
but it's absolutely central to proper 

1875
01:56:27,221 --> 01:56:28,054
being.
You can tell when you're engaged with 

1876
01:56:29,531 --> 01:56:30,364
the world property because all of a 
sudden the world becomes worthwhile 

1877
01:56:32,891 --> 01:56:33,724
around you.

1878
01:56:34,030 --> 01:56:34,861
And that's,
that's,

1879
01:56:34,861 --> 01:56:37,240
that's not an illusion we'd been taught 
for so long.

1880
01:56:37,241 --> 01:56:40,540
That meaning is some sort of illusion or
an epi phenomenon.

1881
01:56:40,750 --> 01:56:41,583
I think it's absolutely central and 
certainly no one ever thinks that 

1882
01:56:44,621 --> 01:56:45,454
suffering is an epithet.
Nominate everyone acts as if their own 

1883
01:56:47,741 --> 01:56:49,840
suffering is the most real thing there 
is.

1884
01:56:49,841 --> 01:56:51,730
And so,
and a no wonder.

1885
01:56:52,150 --> 01:56:52,983
So if you experience something that 
enables you to transcend that suffering 

1886
01:56:56,141 --> 01:56:56,974
or to justify it in your own life,
which is that sense of meaningful 

1887
01:56:59,111 --> 01:56:59,944
engagement,
why wouldn't you regard that as even 

1888
01:57:01,571 --> 01:57:02,404
more real than pain?
The only thing more real than pain is 

1889
01:57:05,141 --> 01:57:08,550
that which can transcend it and you can 
experience that in your own life.

1890
01:57:08,570 --> 01:57:11,590
You do that all the time when you were 
in the right place at the right time.

1891
01:57:11,770 --> 01:57:12,603
It's a real thing.
And I also think that's the place that 

1892
01:57:15,541 --> 01:57:20,170
truth puts you well now,
how that relates to the cyclicality.

1893
01:57:20,380 --> 01:57:22,300
Well that's the pathway out of it.
You know,

1894
01:57:23,110 --> 01:57:25,870
life is order,
chaos,

1895
01:57:25,990 --> 01:57:27,850
reestablishment of order.
And you could say,

1896
01:57:27,851 --> 01:57:29,170
well,
you're the order.

1897
01:57:29,770 --> 01:57:33,370
Or You could say you're the chaos and 
lots of people or the chaos,

1898
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:36,610
or maybe you're even at Denison of hell 
inside that chaos,

1899
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:37,593
or you're the reestablished order and 
all of those things are reasonable 

1900
01:57:41,021 --> 01:57:41,854
things to be.
But the most reasonable thing to be is 

1901
01:57:43,751 --> 01:57:47,860
the thing that constantly moves along 
that pathway ever upwards.

1902
01:57:47,861 --> 01:57:50,020
Like,
like that staircase at the back,

1903
01:57:50,021 --> 01:57:52,870
which is what that represents.
It's that spiral upwards.

1904
01:57:52,871 --> 01:57:55,270
You know that leads us up into the 
beyond.

1905
01:57:55,271 --> 01:57:58,690
That's the stairway to heaven and that 
cyclicality and and it's,

1906
01:57:58,691 --> 01:58:01,150
it's,
it's a genuine thing and you,

1907
01:58:01,180 --> 01:58:03,460
you know it but you don't know you know 
it.

1908
01:58:03,850 --> 01:58:04,683
And some of these stories,
the icons that Jonathan produces in 

1909
01:58:06,731 --> 01:58:07,564
these stories that we've been talking 
about her are humanities attempts to 

1910
01:58:10,331 --> 01:58:11,164
make that pattern articulate and all 
we've really managed so far is to 

1911
01:58:14,501 --> 01:58:15,334
capture that image and story.
We haven't enabled to make it fully 

1912
01:58:17,891 --> 01:58:18,724
articulate,
but the time for that I would say is 

1913
01:58:20,891 --> 01:58:21,724
approaching because we need to 
understand these things consciously so 

1914
01:58:24,041 --> 01:58:25,960
that we could participate in them 
properly.

1915
01:58:31,620 --> 01:58:32,453
Thank you.

1916
01:58:33,690 --> 01:58:37,560
This one I suppose would be most 
appropriate for our reverend fathers.

1917
01:58:37,630 --> 01:58:42,070
What role does Jesus Christ and the 
church play in helping us to become

1918
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:42,903
more like God?
Is it possible to become like God 

1919
01:58:45,311 --> 01:58:48,760
without this person and this 
institution?

1920
01:58:49,340 --> 01:58:50,173
Okay.

1921
01:58:51,330 --> 01:58:52,250
One wants to start.

1922
01:59:02,470 --> 01:59:07,470
This is obviously one of the hotly 
debated subjects in Church history.

1923
01:59:07,931 --> 01:59:11,650
It's also a major subject in the New 
Testament Teaching New Testament.

1924
01:59:11,651 --> 01:59:15,910
This term and reading Paul recently and 
whole wrestles with this question,

1925
01:59:15,911 --> 01:59:16,990
you know,
how is it,

1926
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:18,880
you know,
under the law,

1927
01:59:18,970 --> 01:59:20,380
outside of the law,
how do people,

1928
01:59:20,410 --> 01:59:22,630
you know,
come to uh,

1929
01:59:22,900 --> 01:59:27,400
this sort of center of being this,
this school film into a few manatees,

1930
01:59:27,401 --> 01:59:29,680
potential human flourishing,
you know,

1931
01:59:29,950 --> 01:59:32,560
with or without Christ and I,
you know,

1932
01:59:33,010 --> 01:59:35,140
depending on how the is asking,
you look at different,

1933
01:59:35,650 --> 01:59:36,483
different answers.
But I would just recall one of the main 

1934
01:59:38,981 --> 01:59:43,981
things from tonight,
which is that logos is inherent.

1935
01:59:45,430 --> 01:59:46,263
This isn't something that's been kind of
concocted and positive as some sort of 

1936
01:59:51,641 --> 01:59:52,474
philosophical premise.
Wouldn't it be nice if we all kind of 

1937
01:59:55,391 --> 01:59:58,930
agreed with this idea and then kind of 
move towards it together?

1938
01:59:59,060 --> 02:00:01,210
Even if it was that it would be a good 
thing.

1939
02:00:01,990 --> 02:00:03,880
But it's so much more fundamental than 
that.

1940
02:00:04,300 --> 02:00:05,133
Every human va,
not just those who adhere to this 

1941
02:00:08,261 --> 02:00:09,094
philosophy has the image of God within 
them and is he is operating to some 

1942
02:00:14,261 --> 02:00:16,720
degree or another according to the 
logos.

1943
02:00:16,721 --> 02:00:17,554
In fact,
the eastern tradition would tend to 

1944
02:00:19,361 --> 02:00:20,194
argue that our very existence is good 
and therefore every human being is good 

1945
02:00:25,061 --> 02:00:28,150
in so far as they exist.
If there was no goodness in us,

1946
02:00:28,151 --> 02:00:33,151
we would not exist.
Like the evil is eclipsing,

1947
02:00:33,910 --> 02:00:36,520
not uh,
actually tangible force,

1948
02:00:36,550 --> 02:00:37,383
not a real thing.
And so is it possible for someone 

1949
02:00:40,751 --> 02:00:45,751
without Christ to somehow come into 
touch deeply with logos within them,

1950
02:00:46,661 --> 02:00:48,910
therefore with Christ?
Um,

1951
02:00:49,690 --> 02:00:50,523
I think the argument would be ultimately
yes at them it was the best means would 

1952
02:00:54,701 --> 02:00:55,534
be too,
to hear the Gospel proclaimed Jesus 

1953
02:00:58,300 --> 02:01:00,790
Christ is Lord and to respond to that in
faith.

1954
02:01:00,791 --> 02:01:01,481
As you know,
the,

1955
02:01:01,481 --> 02:01:04,690
the new testament talks about,
but even apart from that,

1956
02:01:04,900 --> 02:01:05,733
everyone already has locals and 
therefore everyone already has that 

1957
02:01:08,771 --> 02:01:11,530
pattern etched into their very 
existence.

1958
02:01:11,890 --> 02:01:12,723
And so that's how we could possibly see 
the capacity outside of the sacramental 

1959
02:01:18,131 --> 02:01:21,280
boundaries of the church.
People coming to a position of,

1960
02:01:21,530 --> 02:01:22,990
you know,
harmony would there,

1961
02:01:23,020 --> 02:01:25,540
would there be one of the early church 
fathers?

1962
02:01:25,580 --> 02:01:28,610
Uh,
Saint Justin martyr refers to a,

1963
02:01:28,620 --> 02:01:30,790
and it picks up,
actually this is a pre socratic idea.

1964
02:01:30,791 --> 02:01:32,050
The,
the logos,

1965
02:01:32,170 --> 02:01:33,003
spare matticus the seeds of the word 
which are all through creation and so 

1966
02:01:37,740 --> 02:01:40,640
this is the fundamental essence of,
of all of reality,

1967
02:01:40,641 --> 02:01:41,474
not only in us but in all of creation.
So he was dealing with the fact that 

1968
02:01:44,961 --> 02:01:46,070
people were pointing out,
well,

1969
02:01:46,160 --> 02:01:50,270
how come there's dying and rising gods 
in all sorts of different cultures?

1970
02:01:50,271 --> 02:01:51,104
How come all of the things that you find
in the the the Christian faith or 

1971
02:01:54,481 --> 02:01:57,920
already present in many myths and 
cultures and so forth.

1972
02:01:58,130 --> 02:01:59,330
And he said,
that's brilliant.

1973
02:01:59,510 --> 02:02:00,500
You know,
of course they are.

1974
02:02:00,980 --> 02:02:02,930
This is true.
If it wasn't true,

1975
02:02:02,931 --> 02:02:06,560
it wouldn't be so and so in that sense,
absolutely.

1976
02:02:06,710 --> 02:02:07,543
What we are trying to do as Orthodox 
Christians is simply live in complete 

1977
02:02:11,031 --> 02:02:16,031
harmony with who we are as human beings.
This isn't an outside in position.

1978
02:02:16,850 --> 02:02:17,683
This is the very core of what we are.
This is the fulfillment and trajectory 

1979
02:02:21,350 --> 02:02:22,183
of creation.
And so that's why it's coming back to 

1980
02:02:24,741 --> 02:02:27,350
the earlier point about how can we have 
this dialogue,

1981
02:02:27,351 --> 02:02:30,680
this engagement with the world,
with social sciences,

1982
02:02:30,681 --> 02:02:32,300
with physical sciences,
with

1983
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:34,753
pure physics and mathematics.
We can do that because it all ties in 

1984
02:02:38,511 --> 02:02:39,280
any way.
We,

1985
02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:40,113
we are hoping as Orthodox Christians,
we are in touch with what is 

1986
02:02:43,191 --> 02:02:46,450
fundamentally true of creation and of 
our own human person.

1987
02:02:46,570 --> 02:02:47,403
So,

1988
02:02:48,700 --> 02:02:49,533
okay,

1989
02:02:50,970 --> 02:02:54,640
thank you for that too.
Oh,

1990
02:02:55,050 --> 02:02:58,980
I suppose Dr. Peterson would be best 
equipped to handle this,

1991
02:02:59,940 --> 02:03:01,320
uh,
are or,

1992
02:03:01,470 --> 02:03:06,470
or anyone our union archetypes in accord
with or opposed to Orthodox theology.

1993
02:03:08,250 --> 02:03:09,750
I don't know too much about what that 
means,

1994
02:03:09,751 --> 02:03:10,584
but maybe,

1995
02:03:11,470 --> 02:03:12,303
yeah.

1996
02:03:15,520 --> 02:03:18,220
Well,
the problem

1997
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:19,153
with answering that for me is that I'm 
by no means an expert on Orthodox 

1998
02:03:22,311 --> 02:03:23,100
theology.

1999
02:03:23,100 --> 02:03:24,690
So,
um,

2000
02:03:25,080 --> 02:03:26,070
but what,

2001
02:03:26,340 --> 02:03:30,090
from what I understand of it,
I would say

2002
02:03:34,710 --> 02:03:38,460
you believe that you was a student of 
nature,

2003
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:39,313
right?
It's something that isn't well known 

2004
02:03:41,281 --> 02:03:42,114
about you because most of the history of
psychoanalytic thought was written by 

2005
02:03:45,931 --> 02:03:49,110
the Friday ends and they think of you as
a student of Freud.

2006
02:03:49,111 --> 02:03:49,944
And of course that's true human was 
really introduced to the idea of a 

2007
02:03:53,680 --> 02:03:54,513
profound idea of the unconscious through
Freud and also at least in part to the 

2008
02:03:59,431 --> 02:04:02,610
idea that there was an interior world of
symbols.

2009
02:04:03,300 --> 02:04:06,900
But at the same time,
human was a student of nature.

2010
02:04:06,901 --> 02:04:07,734
And you see nature announced the death 
of God in the late 19 hundreds and what 

2011
02:04:13,591 --> 02:04:14,424
he meant by that in some sense was that 
he meant that the spirit of trees that 

2012
02:04:19,561 --> 02:04:23,040
had been instantiated by Christianity 
had turned against the,

2013
02:04:23,460 --> 02:04:26,190
the Dogma of Christianity and destroyed 
it.

2014
02:04:26,580 --> 02:04:29,190
And what he meant by that was that the 
emerging,

2015
02:04:30,840 --> 02:04:31,673
the emergence of science in that context
of Western culture and the elaborate 

2016
02:04:37,471 --> 02:04:38,304
description of physical reality that he 
that was developed as a consequence 

2017
02:04:42,030 --> 02:04:45,250
ended up in apparent contradiction with 
the Teresa,

2018
02:04:45,390 --> 02:04:48,360
with the truths of,
of our religious tradition.

2019
02:04:48,810 --> 02:04:52,800
And we pick the most developed truth and
let the other one go.

2020
02:04:53,670 --> 02:04:58,670
And nature was not celebrating that 
contrary to what most people think.

2021
02:04:59,510 --> 02:05:02,010
I mean,
when he spoke of the death of God,

2022
02:05:02,011 --> 02:05:05,510
he said that it was an absolute 
catastrophe and that would,

2023
02:05:05,550 --> 02:05:08,040
we would pay for it with millions of 
lives.

2024
02:05:08,550 --> 02:05:11,520
And that was his prognostication for the
20th century,

2025
02:05:11,521 --> 02:05:12,354
which happened to come true in precisely
the manner he indicated for exactly the 

2026
02:05:15,541 --> 02:05:20,541
reasons nature believe that we would 
have to invent our own values because we

2027
02:05:20,881 --> 02:05:23,850
had become,
because the old values that we had lived

2028
02:05:23,851 --> 02:05:28,851
by had had bled themselves out and die.
But the problem with that,

2029
02:05:29,101 --> 02:05:29,934
and this is something you picked up on,
the problem with that is that you can't 

2030
02:05:32,521 --> 02:05:33,354
invent your own values.
And you know that because all of you 

2031
02:05:35,941 --> 02:05:39,960
have tried on New Year's Day to decide 
that you're going to eat less than go to

2032
02:05:39,961 --> 02:05:40,560
the gym.

2033
02:05:40,560 --> 02:05:43,020
And you'd think if you could create your
own values,

2034
02:05:43,021 --> 02:05:44,970
you know,
being this sort of Demi God,

2035
02:05:44,971 --> 02:05:45,804
that as soon as you told yourself that 
you would eat properly and go to the 

2036
02:05:48,241 --> 02:05:50,190
gym,
you'd be up at six in the morning,

2037
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:51,233
you know,
eating carrots and Rutabagas and then 

2038
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:56,070
going off to lift heavy weights.
And of course you're not,

2039
02:05:56,071 --> 02:06:00,720
you're sitting in your chair at night 
eating cheetos and watching,

2040
02:06:01,140 --> 02:06:03,240
watching pornography,
you know,

2041
02:06:04,590 --> 02:06:09,540
so how in the world is something like 
that supposed to create its own values?

2042
02:06:09,541 --> 02:06:10,374
You're,
you're not in control of yourself to 

2043
02:06:11,371 --> 02:06:12,204
that degree.
And so yones answer to that problem was 

2044
02:06:15,301 --> 02:06:16,700
to,
was essentially to,

2045
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:20,370
to look partly within and partly to look
in the symbolic domain.

2046
02:06:20,371 --> 02:06:25,371
And what he realized as a consequence of
doing that was that there was a profound

2047
02:06:26,250 --> 02:06:28,920
answer to the question of the 
resurrection of value.

2048
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:33,920
And for him that was really the 
embodiment of the pattern of,

2049
02:06:35,610 --> 02:06:36,443
of Christ.
That was the self as far as [inaudible] 

2050
02:06:38,040 --> 02:06:40,880
was concerned,
there was no difference between the,

2051
02:06:40,910 --> 02:06:44,460
the architect will self and the symbolic
Christ.

2052
02:06:44,461 --> 02:06:47,910
They were the same thing as far as 
anyone was concerned in so far as Christ

2053
02:06:47,911 --> 02:06:50,970
is the vision of the perfect man,
right?

2054
02:06:50,971 --> 02:06:53,160
Which is a symbolic vision.
So you could say,

2055
02:06:53,161 --> 02:06:53,994
well what is Christ?
And the answer to that is while Christ 

2056
02:06:56,071 --> 02:06:58,500
is whatever you think of as the perfect 
man,

2057
02:06:58,860 --> 02:07:01,620
now you're going to have diverse 
representations of that.

2058
02:07:01,621 --> 02:07:02,454
So you could think about it Christ as 
the totality of the visions of the 

2059
02:07:05,371 --> 02:07:07,170
perfect man.
It's something like that.

2060
02:07:07,470 --> 02:07:11,790
And then that the goal of life was to 
embody that as deeply as possible.

2061
02:07:12,150 --> 02:07:17,150
And you can also believed that the world
would transform itself around you to the

2062
02:07:18,001 --> 02:07:19,920
degree that you did that to uh,
to,

2063
02:07:19,921 --> 02:07:23,430
uh,
to an unspecified double degree.

2064
02:07:23,940 --> 02:07:28,260
And that's where the symbolic reality 
and the historical reality unite

2065
02:07:30,030 --> 02:07:32,100
because,
and we know it's true.

2066
02:07:32,101 --> 02:07:35,050
We also know this is true.
If you look at people like Gandhi or you

2067
02:07:35,051 --> 02:07:37,420
look at people like saussure knits and 
for example,

2068
02:07:37,630 --> 02:07:41,050
these are great people who stood up as 
moral icons,

2069
02:07:41,051 --> 02:07:43,090
let's say,
in the midst of absolute chaos.

2070
02:07:43,091 --> 02:07:46,090
And they transform entire civilizations 
by doing that,

2071
02:07:46,091 --> 02:07:48,760
by standing up for what they believe to 
be true.

2072
02:07:48,940 --> 02:07:51,130
They transformed the entire world around
them.

2073
02:07:51,430 --> 02:07:53,740
And of course,
they're only partially perfect.

2074
02:07:53,741 --> 02:07:56,050
Someone like Solzhenitsyn or someone 
like Gandhi or,

2075
02:07:56,260 --> 02:07:57,093
or perhaps someone like Nelson Mandela,
there only partial incarnations of 

2076
02:08:00,551 --> 02:08:01,384
perfection,
but even to the degree that they were 

2077
02:08:03,941 --> 02:08:04,774
flawed,
know they were perfectly enough so that 

2078
02:08:06,971 --> 02:08:07,804
despite their remnant flaws,
they were able to reorganize the thing 

2079
02:08:10,871 --> 02:08:11,704
itself around them.
And we don't know what the ultimate 

2080
02:08:13,510 --> 02:08:14,620
limit of that is.

2081
02:08:14,620 --> 02:08:15,453
We really don't.
It could be that everything will align 

2082
02:08:18,101 --> 02:08:18,934
itself around people to the degree that 
they put themselves together and I 

2083
02:08:21,491 --> 02:08:22,324
actually have,
I've had experiences that make me 

2084
02:08:23,711 --> 02:08:25,340
convinced that that's the case.
I,

2085
02:08:25,341 --> 02:08:28,390
I truly believe that that's the case.
So,

2086
02:08:28,630 --> 02:08:29,463
and that's also what gives me some,
some belief in these strange Christian 

2087
02:08:32,081 --> 02:08:35,200
ideas about the harrowing of Hell and 
the overcoming of death.

2088
02:08:35,230 --> 02:08:36,063
It's like we have no idea what we could 
do as individual embodiments of the 

2089
02:08:41,081 --> 02:08:41,914
logos,
which is clearly what we are because 

2090
02:08:43,061 --> 02:08:43,894
we're all conscious.
We have no idea what obstacles we could 

2091
02:08:45,941 --> 02:08:46,774
overcome and what,
what massive transformations we could 

2092
02:08:49,601 --> 02:08:52,360
undertake if we actually lived our lives
properly.

2093
02:08:52,540 --> 02:08:55,810
God only knows what we could get rid of.
We could get rid of malaria,

2094
02:08:55,840 --> 02:08:58,570
we could get rid of schistosomiasis and 
the Guinea worm.

2095
02:08:58,571 --> 02:08:59,680
Those are going to be gone soon.

2096
02:08:59,680 --> 02:09:01,000
Anyways,
polio,

2097
02:09:01,360 --> 02:09:04,330
we're going to get rid of hunger.
Maybe we can get rid of death.

2098
02:09:05,170 --> 02:09:07,570
Maybe we can get rid of hell.
Who knows?

2099
02:09:07,870 --> 02:09:08,703
And I know I'm certainly someone who 
believes that hell is real because I've 

2100
02:09:10,961 --> 02:09:11,794
read enough of the accounts of what 
happened in the 20th century to know 

2101
02:09:13,961 --> 02:09:18,550
precisely that it's as real as the most 
warped imagination can possibly make it.

2102
02:09:18,551 --> 02:09:22,210
And that's plenty real enough for me.
So

2103
02:09:23,740 --> 02:09:24,573
well,
so I would say humans vision is very 

2104
02:09:26,111 --> 02:09:26,944
much in keeping as far as I can 
understand with the central traditions 

2105
02:09:29,621 --> 02:09:30,454
of the Orthodox Church,
because he believed that it was the 

2106
02:09:32,321 --> 02:09:33,154
highest moral duty of the,
of the awake soul to participate in 

2107
02:09:37,961 --> 02:09:40,450
manifestation of the self.
That's,

2108
02:09:40,780 --> 02:09:43,570
and that's this union of things that the
Jonathan talked about.

2109
02:09:43,571 --> 02:09:44,980
That's beyond duality.
It's,

2110
02:09:45,190 --> 02:09:46,023
it's to bring everything in you together
into this kind of harmony that then 

2111
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:54,550
extends beyond you into your family and,
and pass that it's musical.

2112
02:09:54,551 --> 02:09:55,384
That's what music represents.
That's why we find it so intensely 

2113
02:09:57,791 --> 02:09:59,860
meaningful.
That's what music tells us.

2114
02:10:00,040 --> 02:10:01,360
It's a,
it's a,

2115
02:10:01,660 --> 02:10:05,330
it's an artwork based upon the meaning 
of pattern and it,

2116
02:10:05,370 --> 02:10:06,203
and it infuses everyone.
You know what it's like to listen to 

2117
02:10:07,871 --> 02:10:08,704
music.
Even the darkest punk rocking our 

2118
02:10:11,581 --> 02:10:12,414
anarchist atheist is overwhelmed with 
the glory of God when he listens to his 

2119
02:10:16,481 --> 02:10:19,450
punk rock music.
So yeah.

2120
02:10:23,800 --> 02:10:24,633
Okay.

2121
02:10:25,490 --> 02:10:27,590
Just a quick comment on that.
Um,

2122
02:10:27,770 --> 02:10:30,260
going back to the central part of that 
question,

2123
02:10:30,261 --> 02:10:32,600
which is about archetypes and with her 
they're the same,

2124
02:10:32,870 --> 02:10:33,770
same thing.
I would

2125
02:10:34,430 --> 02:10:36,720
largely agree with that point.
Uh,

2126
02:10:36,760 --> 02:10:40,790
to the extent to which anyone is in 
touch with the logos within them,

2127
02:10:40,820 --> 02:10:41,653
they are going to be in touch with 
fundamental archetypes and those would 

2128
02:10:43,761 --> 02:10:48,500
be the same at the church.
Fathers refer us to and and so forth.

2129
02:10:48,740 --> 02:10:51,590
The one element that,
and it's kind of relates to the previous

2130
02:10:51,591 --> 02:10:53,480
question about can you do this without 
Christ?

2131
02:10:53,870 --> 02:10:58,870
The thing which is the possibly the 
unique elements of Christian faith,

2132
02:11:00,490 --> 02:11:02,570
Eh,
it's not love.

2133
02:11:03,650 --> 02:11:06,290
Love is what defines Christianity.
In fact,

2134
02:11:06,291 --> 02:11:07,124
love can be found throughout the world.
It's more hope and what I know about 

2135
02:11:11,931 --> 02:11:14,600
young,
which isn't all that much,

2136
02:11:14,660 --> 02:11:18,950
but absolutely the archetypes are there.
We'll go with that.

2137
02:11:19,880 --> 02:11:24,500
Does he come with the same level of hope
that we would as authors?

2138
02:11:24,501 --> 02:11:25,251
I don't know.
I mean,

2139
02:11:25,251 --> 02:11:28,430
sometimes you wonder whether the Coteau 
Vasquez,

2140
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:33,640
the descent kind of leads us to a hell 
where we inhabit without hope and rather

2141
02:11:35,421 --> 02:11:35,960
with despair.

2142
02:11:35,960 --> 02:11:38,470
Can we back to that point about a 
archimandrites software?

2143
02:11:38,471 --> 02:11:42,620
Knee puts your mind in hell,
but don't despair.

2144
02:11:42,660 --> 02:11:43,493
Another was have hope.
So is it possible to have that hope 

2145
02:11:46,220 --> 02:11:47,053
without ultimately what we have,
which is the cross and the message of 

2146
02:11:50,001 --> 02:11:50,834
the cross as an archetype is that we 
stare into the depths of darkness and 

2147
02:11:58,581 --> 02:12:03,230
death and we proclaim light in life.
In fact,

2148
02:12:04,240 --> 02:12:05,073
you know that's what Jesus himself says 
when he refers us back to the old 

2149
02:12:07,941 --> 02:12:11,210
testament to when the people of Israel 
were dying in the wilderness,

2150
02:12:11,240 --> 02:12:14,680
having come out with Moses and they're 
grumbling because they said we,

2151
02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:17,410
if only we were back in Egypt where we 
had it so good.

2152
02:12:17,411 --> 02:12:19,280
Of course the reality of Egypt was 
slavery,

2153
02:12:19,730 --> 02:12:20,630
but they thought,
no,

2154
02:12:20,631 --> 02:12:21,464
no,
we're just going to grumble and they're 

2155
02:12:23,301 --> 02:12:27,110
afflicted by serpents and the in God 
says this most incredible thing.

2156
02:12:27,290 --> 02:12:28,123
Put a serpent on a stick and hold it up.
And those people that look at the 

2157
02:12:32,571 --> 02:12:37,310
serpent look at the source of the 
suffering and death will be healed.

2158
02:12:37,730 --> 02:12:39,530
And so Christ says,
Jesus says,

2159
02:12:39,800 --> 02:12:40,633
the son of man will be raised up.
So we have to look upon death and 

2160
02:12:44,511 --> 02:12:48,050
suffering.
We have to descend into hell with light,

2161
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:51,550
with light,
the light that it is never extinguished.

2162
02:12:51,600 --> 02:12:52,433
Come back to the prologue of Saint John.
I don't know whether that's there and 

2163
02:12:54,791 --> 02:12:58,430
younger and I can be corrected on that,
but that's possibly the point where,

2164
02:12:58,910 --> 02:12:59,411
you know,
a,

2165
02:12:59,411 --> 02:13:00,244
a purely social science or psychological
approach might be lacking because I see 

2166
02:13:05,121 --> 02:13:08,860
the Christian virtue,
Alex Sinners is hope because it's,

2167
02:13:08,861 --> 02:13:13,861
it's almost unique in its capacity to 
look into everything that is so dark and

2168
02:13:14,661 --> 02:13:17,870
say there is yet life.
There is yet late.

2169
02:13:23,490 --> 02:13:27,450
So one of the things that really 
affected young,

2170
02:13:27,480 --> 02:13:30,990
who by the way worked for the American 
government,

2171
02:13:31,110 --> 02:13:32,070
the CIA during

2172
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:33,380
World War Two,
um,

2173
02:13:33,750 --> 02:13:36,270
sending them psychological reports on 
Hitler,

2174
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:37,633
um,
young meditated for a very long period 

2175
02:13:41,311 --> 02:13:42,144
of time on what happened in Nazi Germany
and young's the dictum that he derived 

2176
02:13:47,551 --> 02:13:50,730
from his l chemical studies was in 
[inaudible] tour,

2177
02:13:50,731 --> 02:13:51,564
which I'm probably saying wrong,
but it means the thing you want most 

2178
02:13:53,851 --> 02:13:57,270
will be will be found the place you at 
least one look.

2179
02:13:58,080 --> 02:14:00,930
And so for young you,
cause one of the questions you might ask

2180
02:14:00,931 --> 02:14:03,180
yourself is that if enlightenment is 
possible,

2181
02:14:03,181 --> 02:14:05,430
let's say if union with the self as 
possible,

2182
02:14:05,431 --> 02:14:07,410
there's some sort of mystical 
transcendence.

2183
02:14:07,740 --> 02:14:09,930
Why in the world aren't we just all that
way?

2184
02:14:09,980 --> 02:14:11,670
What's the barrier?
It's like,

2185
02:14:11,671 --> 02:14:13,050
well,
we could be way better.

2186
02:14:13,830 --> 02:14:18,420
Well why not just do it then if it's 
just right there ahead of us.

2187
02:14:18,421 --> 02:14:19,254
But,
but the answer to that is I think is 

2188
02:14:22,650 --> 02:14:23,483
something like you cannot conceive of 
how good a human being might be until 

2189
02:14:27,751 --> 02:14:31,830
you can conceive of how evil a human 
being can and will be.

2190
02:14:32,220 --> 02:14:36,360
And that means to encounter in yourself,
the Nazi that the prison guard,

2191
02:14:36,361 --> 02:14:37,194
the Auschwitz Guard to understand fully 
that there is no difference between you 

2192
02:14:42,900 --> 02:14:47,550
and the people who were killing children
in the Nazi death camps that you,

2193
02:14:48,360 --> 02:14:49,193
and that's that encounter with hell.
That's literally that encounter with 

2194
02:14:51,781 --> 02:14:53,560
hell.
You're a dentist and of hell.

2195
02:14:53,570 --> 02:14:54,403
Insofar as you're capable of that and 
you are capable of that and there isn't 

2196
02:14:57,871 --> 02:15:00,930
anything I think that can scare you 
straight,

2197
02:15:02,250 --> 02:15:03,083
except that knowledge you can be,
you can be and are a vessel that can be 

2198
02:15:07,951 --> 02:15:11,580
used for absolute evil and you would 
participate in it,

2199
02:15:11,581 --> 02:15:15,390
you would participate in it.
And so for young,

2200
02:15:15,391 --> 02:15:17,790
the pathway to,
it's like Dante,

2201
02:15:17,791 --> 02:15:21,360
you don't get to paradise before you go 
to the lowest levels of hell.

2202
02:15:21,361 --> 02:15:21,841
Right?
Right.

2203
02:15:21,841 --> 02:15:24,840
At the bottom where betrayal lurks for 
Dante,

2204
02:15:24,841 --> 02:15:26,460
that was the worst of all sins.

2205
02:15:26,970 --> 02:15:27,803
And so it's a terrifying process.
I tried to teach my students in my maps 

2206
02:15:32,161 --> 02:15:32,994
of meaning class,
which is the opposite of the safe space 

2207
02:15:34,741 --> 02:15:35,910
as far as I'm concerned.
I,

2208
02:15:36,210 --> 02:15:37,680
I,
and I mean that technically,

2209
02:15:37,681 --> 02:15:40,410
I truly do mean that.
I tried to convince my students,

2210
02:15:40,411 --> 02:15:45,411
I try to get them to meditate on the 
fact that they're that Damn Nazis.

2211
02:15:46,230 --> 02:15:48,540
Really?
Because what is it?

2212
02:15:48,541 --> 02:15:49,410
It's,
what is it?

2213
02:15:49,411 --> 02:15:51,540
The Germans like come on.
Really?

2214
02:15:51,660 --> 02:15:54,510
No,
obviously not.

2215
02:15:54,870 --> 02:15:55,703
It's people.
And so the pathway to paradise is 

2216
02:15:58,471 --> 02:16:01,860
through hell and that's,
it's no wonder no one goes there.

2217
02:16:01,861 --> 02:16:03,780
I mean,
who wants to go there?

2218
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:05,730
No one.
Well,

2219
02:16:05,790 --> 02:16:09,810
if you don't go there voluntarily,
you'll go there accidentally.

2220
02:16:10,260 --> 02:16:13,800
So it's better to go there voluntarily 
because then you can go with hope.

2221
02:16:13,801 --> 02:16:15,270
You can say,
I can withstand this.

2222
02:16:15,271 --> 02:16:17,370
Maybe I can find a light at the end of 
the tunnel.

2223
02:16:24,860 --> 02:16:27,260
A question for Mr Pojo.
Uh,

2224
02:16:27,261 --> 02:16:30,130
you have spoken in the past about the 
contradictory

2225
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:32,080
nature of symbols.
For example,

2226
02:16:32,081 --> 02:16:35,710
water represents both healing and 
dangerous chaos.

2227
02:16:36,130 --> 02:16:36,963
Can you speak about how we can resolve 
this apparent contradiction and to 

2228
02:16:40,061 --> 02:16:40,894
follow up,
how does this apply to the relationship 

2229
02:16:42,760 --> 02:16:47,440
between the internal mental world and 
the external material world?

2230
02:16:52,540 --> 02:16:53,373
You might have to repeat the second part
of that question after I answer the 

2231
02:16:55,361 --> 02:16:56,780
first part.
Um,

2232
02:16:58,870 --> 02:17:00,370
um,
I think,

2233
02:17:01,180 --> 02:17:01,521
I mean,
I,

2234
02:17:01,521 --> 02:17:03,260
I've been,
one of the things that has,

2235
02:17:03,310 --> 02:17:04,143
as you said,
that I've been thinking a lot about is 

2236
02:17:05,741 --> 02:17:07,750
the,
is the duality of symbols.

2237
02:17:08,210 --> 02:17:10,210
Um,
every,

2238
02:17:10,480 --> 02:17:14,340
every image,
every symbol has like a dark and a light

2239
02:17:14,410 --> 02:17:15,243
light side.
And you can see it when you read the 

2240
02:17:16,151 --> 02:17:16,984
Bible,
when you read the stories or even when 

2241
02:17:19,991 --> 02:17:22,690
you look at icons or when you look at 
images and,

2242
02:17:22,691 --> 02:17:23,524
um,

2243
02:17:24,060 --> 02:17:24,893
yeah,

2244
02:17:25,080 --> 02:17:25,913
the,
um,

2245
02:17:26,540 --> 02:17:27,620
it has to do with,
with,

2246
02:17:27,621 --> 02:17:28,454
with this idea of a,
of a cent or this idea of moving up 

2247
02:17:32,780 --> 02:17:34,030
because,
um,

2248
02:17:35,930 --> 02:17:36,763
what's important when we're in on the 
spiritual journey is the direction that 

2249
02:17:40,521 --> 02:17:42,190
we're facing.
It's at,

2250
02:17:42,290 --> 02:17:43,123
it's not so much where we are.
Like if you can imagine the ascent of 

2251
02:17:47,241 --> 02:17:50,660
the world or of ourselves up to God as a
ladder,

2252
02:17:50,840 --> 02:17:53,000
which is how often it's represented in,
in,

2253
02:17:53,001 --> 02:17:56,840
in Orthodox icons as this ladder that we
ascend towards God.

2254
02:17:57,050 --> 02:18:00,350
Um,
you could be pretty high up the ladder,

2255
02:18:00,351 --> 02:18:03,380
but if you fall,
there's no point,

2256
02:18:03,470 --> 02:18:05,420
right?
The idea is to ascend.

2257
02:18:05,421 --> 02:18:08,780
And so all of the symbols that we see in
m

2258
02:18:10,240 --> 02:18:13,660
in the Bible have those two sides.
And water is a,

2259
02:18:13,661 --> 02:18:15,850
is a perfect example in the old 
testament,

2260
02:18:16,030 --> 02:18:16,863
all through the old tests,
old testament water is an image of 

2261
02:18:19,331 --> 02:18:20,700
death,
um,

2262
02:18:21,020 --> 02:18:22,870
in the flood.
Um,

2263
02:18:23,110 --> 02:18:26,470
and then the crossing of the Red Sea 
crossing of the Jordan,

2264
02:18:26,620 --> 02:18:29,050
he's,
he's constantly this symbol of death.

2265
02:18:29,350 --> 02:18:34,350
But the key to resolving the a duality 
of symbolism is Christ.

2266
02:18:38,020 --> 02:18:41,380
He is always the key to all the stories 
I believe.

2267
02:18:41,920 --> 02:18:42,753
And so when you look at the story of 
Christ and you see how he takes let's 

2268
02:18:47,561 --> 02:18:48,394
say,
the dark side of a symbol and he flips 

2269
02:18:50,201 --> 02:18:52,930
it over and then makes it into something
else.

2270
02:18:53,080 --> 02:18:55,180
So that's the mystery,
let's say,

2271
02:18:55,420 --> 02:18:57,040
of baptism.
You know,

2272
02:18:57,160 --> 02:18:59,830
why,
why would we have to be baptized?

2273
02:18:59,831 --> 02:19:02,470
I mean,
it's a very strange that this flood,

2274
02:19:02,740 --> 02:19:03,573
you know,
this Red Sea that the Egyptians were 

2275
02:19:05,411 --> 02:19:07,570
drowned in.
Why would we have to be baptized?

2276
02:19:07,570 --> 02:19:11,440
Well,
it's because the Christ takes this death

2277
02:19:11,620 --> 02:19:12,453
and changes into,
he changes it into a process of let's 

2278
02:19:15,191 --> 02:19:18,760
say washing or a process of 
purification.

2279
02:19:19,570 --> 02:19:21,190
And so the same symbol,
which is,

2280
02:19:21,220 --> 02:19:23,440
which is death,
can also be a symbol of washing.

2281
02:19:23,850 --> 02:19:25,350
Um,
so,

2282
02:19:25,351 --> 02:19:26,890
so,
so it's the same with fire.

2283
02:19:26,900 --> 02:19:29,150
Fire is the perfect example.
I mean,

2284
02:19:29,180 --> 02:19:31,700
we look at icon,
you'll see fire and hell.

2285
02:19:31,860 --> 02:19:36,050
Then you'll see fire coming from the sky
as the manifestation of the Holy Spirit.

2286
02:19:36,051 --> 02:19:37,610
So how,
what does that mean?

2287
02:19:38,010 --> 02:19:39,860
Um,
and so it's the same thing.

2288
02:19:39,861 --> 02:19:40,720
Let's say you,
you,

2289
02:19:40,730 --> 02:19:43,790
you see fire as division.
Well,

2290
02:19:43,791 --> 02:19:44,624
there's a negative division,
which is the division in which we 

2291
02:19:46,941 --> 02:19:49,550
scatter ourselves and we're,
and we're,

2292
02:19:49,880 --> 02:19:50,713
we're consumed.
But there's another type of division 

2293
02:19:53,450 --> 02:19:58,450
that say the division of Pentecost,
which is the division which embodies the

2294
02:19:58,521 --> 02:20:02,690
multiplicity of how God manifests 
himself in the world.

2295
02:20:02,900 --> 02:20:06,530
And so it just depends on which side you
take each symbol.

2296
02:20:07,330 --> 02:20:09,770
So I hope that answers that question.
What was the second part again?

2297
02:20:11,730 --> 02:20:16,730
Don't think about,
okay.

2298
02:20:22,930 --> 02:20:24,070
Yeah,
I think I understand.

2299
02:20:24,100 --> 02:20:25,900
I think I understand what that,
what that means.

2300
02:20:26,410 --> 02:20:27,243
Um,

2301
02:20:28,150 --> 02:20:31,180
I think it did well.
It is my real,

2302
02:20:31,210 --> 02:20:34,690
my belief that symbolism is anchored in 
experience.

2303
02:20:35,020 --> 02:20:39,430
And I don't think that most symbols are 
not just these abstract things that that

2304
02:20:39,431 --> 02:20:41,770
float above us.
So for example,

2305
02:20:41,990 --> 02:20:44,020
um,
a good example would be,

2306
02:20:44,021 --> 02:20:45,650
for example,
the mountain you,

2307
02:20:45,820 --> 02:20:46,653
we see in the Old Testament,
we have this sense that Moses ascends 

2308
02:20:49,661 --> 02:20:50,494
the mountain and then encounters God.
And then we see it repeated over and 

2309
02:20:53,171 --> 02:20:54,004
over in,
in the patterns of the stories where 

2310
02:20:56,501 --> 02:21:00,820
Christ ascends a heel or a sends a 
mountain and then something happens.

2311
02:21:00,880 --> 02:21:02,800
There's a revelation on the,
on this mountain.

2312
02:21:02,980 --> 02:21:04,630
And you think like,
well that's strange,

2313
02:21:04,631 --> 02:21:05,464
right?
I mean,

2314
02:21:05,950 --> 02:21:08,710
why would you want,
what does the amount and have to do with

2315
02:21:08,711 --> 02:21:09,980
anything?
Um,

2316
02:21:10,390 --> 02:21:11,223
and so I think the key is to 
understanding a lot of symbolism is to 

2317
02:21:15,161 --> 02:21:17,530
kind of see it as,
as an,

2318
02:21:17,531 --> 02:21:18,730
as an experience.

2319
02:21:19,090 --> 02:21:21,100
And so if you ask yourself,
for example,

2320
02:21:21,101 --> 02:21:24,790
what happens when I go up a mountain?
Just physically,

2321
02:21:24,791 --> 02:21:29,320
what happens as you go up a mountain,
you,

2322
02:21:29,420 --> 02:21:29,830
the,
the,

2323
02:21:29,830 --> 02:21:32,290
the base of the mountain,
which is the large,

2324
02:21:32,320 --> 02:21:37,320
this huge thing starts to refine itself.
And then it starts to become smaller and

2325
02:21:38,111 --> 02:21:38,944
smaller and smaller.
And that up to you get to the point and 

2326
02:21:42,011 --> 02:21:42,844
then everything is one.
And then if you stand at the top of a 

2327
02:21:46,631 --> 02:21:49,510
mountain and you look around when you 
were at the bottom of the mountain,

2328
02:21:49,511 --> 02:21:53,200
all you can see is the trees and that 
are right next to you.

2329
02:21:53,201 --> 02:21:56,080
And you can see a very particular part 
of the world.

2330
02:21:56,081 --> 02:21:57,730
But if you ascend to the top of a 
mountain,

2331
02:21:57,731 --> 02:22:01,870
then you have this vision of everything.
Um,

2332
02:22:02,080 --> 02:22:02,913
and so the symbolism of the mountain,
which is found in the Bible and the 

2333
02:22:06,551 --> 02:22:10,720
Gospel in the icons is akin to the,
the,

2334
02:22:10,721 --> 02:22:11,554
the,
the phenomenological reality of that 

2335
02:22:13,871 --> 02:22:14,410
thing.

2336
02:22:14,410 --> 02:22:15,243
So we often,
it's difficult for us to get that 

2337
02:22:16,901 --> 02:22:20,020
because we're so caught up in a 
scientific vision of the world that it's

2338
02:22:20,021 --> 02:22:23,020
difficult to understand the symbolism.
But if you,

2339
02:22:23,290 --> 02:22:27,750
if you just put yourself in the position
of someone who does something or someone

2340
02:22:27,960 --> 02:22:29,070
like,
water's the same,

2341
02:22:29,071 --> 02:22:31,860
I mean water would,
would we do with water.

2342
02:22:31,861 --> 02:22:35,340
We wash ourselves with water and what,
what is washing?

2343
02:22:35,490 --> 02:22:40,490
Washing is removing all the external and
dead things that we have on our hands.

2344
02:22:41,970 --> 02:22:44,610
So that we are purified.
Well that's,

2345
02:22:44,611 --> 02:22:46,280
that's one of the symbol.
That's one of the,

2346
02:22:46,281 --> 02:22:47,700
the,
the symbols of baptism.

2347
02:22:48,300 --> 02:22:49,200
So,
yeah.

2348
02:22:49,230 --> 02:22:51,060
So I think,
I hope that explains that

2349
02:22:56,770 --> 02:22:59,590
this question isn't addressed to anyone 
in particular.

2350
02:22:59,591 --> 02:23:02,140
So anyone wanting to answer can do.
So,

2351
02:23:02,200 --> 02:23:03,033
um,
I'd like to hear your thoughts on the 

2352
02:23:05,751 --> 02:23:06,584
concept of free will.
As many as many of the modern atheist 

2353
02:23:11,670 --> 02:23:15,480
believe that free will is an illusion.
Uh,

2354
02:23:15,490 --> 02:23:18,350
according to their belief in mature in 
materialism.

2355
02:23:18,920 --> 02:23:19,753
How does one reconcile freewill with an 
omniscient God who knows the end from 

2356
02:23:24,051 --> 02:23:29,030
the beginning who knows your future and 
created you such that you were compelled

2357
02:23:29,031 --> 02:23:30,620
to realize it?

2358
02:23:37,360 --> 02:23:40,090
So believe it or not,
we get this question all the time.

2359
02:23:41,680 --> 02:23:44,770
We get this question from teens,
believe this.

2360
02:23:45,250 --> 02:23:47,110
It's the perennial question.
You know,

2361
02:23:47,650 --> 02:23:51,130
if God knows what's going to happen 
cause he does,

2362
02:23:51,550 --> 02:23:52,383
if he,
if God is everywhere and fills all 

2363
02:23:53,471 --> 02:23:55,120
things,
he is past,

2364
02:23:55,121 --> 02:23:57,400
present and future,
then how can you have freewill?

2365
02:23:57,550 --> 02:23:59,590
And then of course all of those other 
implications,

2366
02:23:59,591 --> 02:24:00,690
right?
So know if,

2367
02:24:01,020 --> 02:24:04,030
if I don't have freewill or if God knows
what I'm going to do in the end.

2368
02:24:04,031 --> 02:24:04,864
And then does he create some people too 
to go to hell or it could be away from 

2369
02:24:08,921 --> 02:24:10,490
him or not,
you know,

2370
02:24:10,540 --> 02:24:12,940
reach union with him and others.
And if so,

2371
02:24:12,941 --> 02:24:14,320
then how can it be love and all these 
other things.

2372
02:24:14,321 --> 02:24:15,154
So,
um,

2373
02:24:16,150 --> 02:24:21,150
I think the fundamental misunderstanding
is I would say the concept of time of a,

2374
02:24:23,680 --> 02:24:25,180
of creation itself.

2375
02:24:25,510 --> 02:24:26,343
So the idea that God,
we think as human beings in a linear 

2376
02:24:31,180 --> 02:24:31,631
way,
right?

2377
02:24:31,631 --> 02:24:34,540
We have no other way of thinking.
So we have a beginning,

2378
02:24:35,140 --> 02:24:37,060
we have a president and then we have an 
end.

2379
02:24:37,061 --> 02:24:39,490
And this is the way the world works and 
moves in one direction.

2380
02:24:39,900 --> 02:24:40,733
Um,
we have no concept of God's reality and 

2381
02:24:44,771 --> 02:24:47,380
the idea of being outside of time,
we have no concept of that.

2382
02:24:47,670 --> 02:24:50,200
We wouldn't even know how to begin to 
think about that if,

2383
02:24:50,530 --> 02:24:52,690
if we tried and people have tried.
Um,

2384
02:24:53,590 --> 02:24:57,730
the easiest analogy I guess for example,
that I could,

2385
02:24:58,030 --> 02:24:59,980
I could give would be,
um,

2386
02:25:00,730 --> 02:25:03,970
the idea of perspective and what do we 
mean by that?

2387
02:25:05,650 --> 02:25:09,830
Let's say I'm the camera person here,
right?

2388
02:25:09,850 --> 02:25:14,110
And I'm watching this kind of whole 
event unfolding,

2389
02:25:14,750 --> 02:25:16,060
um,
after it's happened.

2390
02:25:16,090 --> 02:25:17,380
So it's,
it's been videotaped,

2391
02:25:17,381 --> 02:25:18,214
right?
And somebody else can watch this and 

2392
02:25:19,420 --> 02:25:21,280
they can watch this event and they can 
forward,

2393
02:25:21,340 --> 02:25:22,173
they go back and they can back to see 
something that they really liked or 

2394
02:25:24,671 --> 02:25:25,504
something that they forgot or they can 
fast forward to the end and see how it 

2395
02:25:28,421 --> 02:25:29,254
all turned out.

2396
02:25:29,410 --> 02:25:31,590
Um,
the person who is watching that,

2397
02:25:31,591 --> 02:25:34,030
who is removed from that reality,
uh,

2398
02:25:34,150 --> 02:25:36,460
they can see what's going on and what's 
not going on.

2399
02:25:36,461 --> 02:25:39,040
They can jump ahead in the past,
but they don't cause it.

2400
02:25:39,650 --> 02:25:40,483
Uh,
it's just their perspective is 

2401
02:25:41,231 --> 02:25:42,760
different.
So this idea,

2402
02:25:42,761 --> 02:25:44,710
and of course this is kind of a crude 
analogy,

2403
02:25:44,970 --> 02:25:45,803
um,
of course it's much more complex than 

2404
02:25:47,261 --> 02:25:48,640
that.
And it's much more nuanced than that.

2405
02:25:49,060 --> 02:25:49,621
And,
uh,

2406
02:25:49,621 --> 02:25:51,100
and,
and of course we would,

2407
02:25:51,160 --> 02:25:53,230
we would leave at least as Orthodox 
Christians is that God is,

2408
02:25:53,570 --> 02:25:54,730
is,
is much more,

2409
02:25:54,731 --> 02:25:55,564
um,
permeates all things and is working in 

2410
02:25:58,181 --> 02:25:59,750
people's lives.
Um,

2411
02:26:00,460 --> 02:26:03,340
but there is a strange paradox between 
free will,

2412
02:26:03,400 --> 02:26:08,400
the idea that we have the choice whether
we want to follow God to believe in him,

2413
02:26:10,020 --> 02:26:11,950
uh,
or to believe rather than ourselves.

2414
02:26:11,951 --> 02:26:12,660
And I think,
uh,

2415
02:26:12,660 --> 02:26:14,650
as professor [inaudible] said,
you know,

2416
02:26:14,830 --> 02:26:19,030
the reality of the hell that many of us 
live in and the reality of the hell that

2417
02:26:19,031 --> 02:26:19,864
has been created by societies and 
civilizations all over the world is a 

2418
02:26:23,471 --> 02:26:26,740
proof of the reality of freewill proof.

2419
02:26:27,320 --> 02:26:29,440
Um,
at least for people who believe in God.

2420
02:26:29,830 --> 02:26:30,690
Now,
if you don't believe in God,

2421
02:26:30,730 --> 02:26:32,560
different story and then you would say,
well,

2422
02:26:32,561 --> 02:26:34,300
that's not proof of anything except that
we're just,

2423
02:26:34,570 --> 02:26:37,390
we're just animals living on this planet
and there's no meaning to anything.

2424
02:26:37,870 --> 02:26:41,230
But if there's a god and there are still
horrible things happening,

2425
02:26:41,530 --> 02:26:43,830
we'll either that God is,
you know,

2426
02:26:44,410 --> 02:26:48,850
an evil being or rather that we have the
free will not to believe in him,

2427
02:26:48,851 --> 02:26:50,530
not to follow him,
not to do his will.

2428
02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:52,020
Um,
and,

2429
02:26:52,300 --> 02:26:56,590
and that may seem like a horrible,
horrible thing for God to give to us.

2430
02:26:56,890 --> 02:26:58,100
You know,
this idea of free will.

2431
02:26:58,570 --> 02:27:00,580
Um,
and yet it is also the greatest thing,

2432
02:27:01,120 --> 02:27:01,953
the greatest thing because it's not only
the idea of us avoiding suffering or US 

2433
02:27:05,561 --> 02:27:09,130
avoiding sin or US avoiding the evil 
that we created within the world,

2434
02:27:09,490 --> 02:27:11,200
but is the idea of the,
you,

2435
02:27:11,230 --> 02:27:15,070
the idea that through our own sin and 
through our own difficulties,

2436
02:27:15,340 --> 02:27:17,080
we somehow find meaning.
And we,

2437
02:27:17,081 --> 02:27:19,030
and we come up on the other side.
So,

2438
02:27:19,380 --> 02:27:21,310
um,
I,

2439
02:27:21,910 --> 02:27:24,910
I don't know how much better I can,
can try to explain it.

2440
02:27:24,911 --> 02:27:26,020
It's a,
it's a complex thing,

2441
02:27:26,050 --> 02:27:26,883
but

2442
02:27:34,500 --> 02:27:35,333
so in the mythological world,
I would say there are three continually 

2443
02:27:42,001 --> 02:27:47,001
intertwined causal elements.
One of one is consciousness.

2444
02:27:47,251 --> 02:27:51,450
You could say that's the logos.
One is the interpretive structure within

2445
02:27:51,451 --> 02:27:55,560
which that logo's exists.
And that's the framework that you used.

2446
02:27:55,561 --> 02:27:59,190
Organize yourself cognitively within the
world,

2447
02:27:59,220 --> 02:28:01,920
your point of view.
And then there's the world itself,

2448
02:28:01,921 --> 02:28:02,754
the natural world.
Let's say those three things are always 

2449
02:28:05,670 --> 02:28:09,480
in interplay and they're each given 
causal primacy.

2450
02:28:10,120 --> 02:28:10,953
Um,
you see this echoed in popular culture 

2451
02:28:13,111 --> 02:28:17,570
motifs and I think Pinocchio is a very 
good example of that where Pinocchio has

2452
02:28:17,571 --> 02:28:20,580
it farther.
And that's tapatio who's his creator?

2453
02:28:20,581 --> 02:28:21,414
And he's a,
so we're very deterministic sort of 

2454
02:28:23,031 --> 02:28:23,864
creature and he has a mother and that's 
the blue fairy that comes down from 

2455
02:28:26,931 --> 02:28:31,280
heaven who's really f a figure of the 
vitality of nature.

2456
02:28:31,640 --> 02:28:36,230
And so Pinocchio is portrayed in the 
movie as child of nature and culture,

2457
02:28:36,260 --> 02:28:38,720
which is of course how we're portrayed 
scientifically.

2458
02:28:38,720 --> 02:28:39,553
But,
but there's a third element in that 

2459
02:28:42,260 --> 02:28:43,093
movie,
which is really what drives the plot 

2460
02:28:44,331 --> 02:28:45,164
forward,
which is Pinocchio's capacity to make 

2461
02:28:46,761 --> 02:28:49,160
choices.
And that's his consciousness.

2462
02:28:49,161 --> 02:28:53,480
And that's also what elevates him above 
the status of deterministic puppet.

2463
02:28:54,230 --> 02:28:55,850
Now you might say,
well,

2464
02:28:55,851 --> 02:28:58,070
there's no evidence that we're not 
deterministic.

2465
02:28:58,071 --> 02:28:58,791
And I could say,
well,

2466
02:28:58,791 --> 02:29:02,150
that's fine because there's also no 
evidence that we are deterministic.

2467
02:29:02,151 --> 02:29:02,984
So we can leave that as a draw,
but we certainly treat each other as if 

2468
02:29:06,561 --> 02:29:07,394
we have freewill.
We treat ourselves as if we have free 

2469
02:29:10,071 --> 02:29:10,904
will.
We even those of us who regard each 

2470
02:29:13,041 --> 02:29:13,874
other as deterministic,
believe that or has determined to 

2471
02:29:16,361 --> 02:29:17,194
believe that in their own actions,
they're going to be perfectly irritated 

2472
02:29:20,001 --> 02:29:22,910
at whatever choices you make that happen
to infringe upon them.

2473
02:29:22,911 --> 02:29:26,630
And they're going to act towards you as 
if you're an agent with free will.

2474
02:29:26,930 --> 02:29:30,170
So they can say they regard people as 
deterministic,

2475
02:29:30,171 --> 02:29:33,110
but they don't act it out.
So I don't believe that they believe it.

2476
02:29:33,111 --> 02:29:33,944
And I also don't believe that you can 
produce a functional society without 

2477
02:29:36,921 --> 02:29:37,754
having something like that at its basis.
And I've never seen any evidence of a 

2478
02:29:40,941 --> 02:29:43,250
functional society being produced with 
that,

2479
02:29:43,280 --> 02:29:45,590
without that as a metaphysical 
presupposition.

2480
02:29:46,250 --> 02:29:47,083
So,
but there's something more crucially 

2481
02:29:48,800 --> 02:29:50,600
crucial involved here too,
is that

2482
02:29:52,190 --> 02:29:57,190
in order to accept the inevitability of 
determinism and human action,

2483
02:29:57,771 --> 02:29:58,604
you have to accept the presupposition 
that consciousness is nothing but an 

2484
02:30:01,191 --> 02:30:03,620
empath phenomena of a deeper material 
reality.

2485
02:30:03,621 --> 02:30:05,600
And first of all,
we do not know that.

2486
02:30:05,630 --> 02:30:10,010
We certainly do not know that what we 
know about consciousness scientifically,

2487
02:30:10,011 --> 02:30:13,850
you could put in a thimble and still 
have enough room for another thimble.

2488
02:30:14,090 --> 02:30:16,430
We know nothing about it.
It's a mystery.

2489
02:30:16,431 --> 02:30:18,920
We have not cracked at all.

2490
02:30:19,070 --> 02:30:19,903
And people have been battling away 
pretty hard on it from a scientific 

2491
02:30:22,701 --> 02:30:26,300
perspective for the last 40 years since 
it's become in vogue again.

2492
02:30:26,301 --> 02:30:28,220
And I don't think we've moved forward a 
little bit.

2493
02:30:28,760 --> 02:30:31,070
And then finally,
so it's a mystery.

2494
02:30:31,071 --> 02:30:31,601
And,
and,

2495
02:30:31,601 --> 02:30:32,434
and I,
I don't think there's any evidence 

2496
02:30:33,711 --> 02:30:34,544
whatsoever that it isn't.
I read Dan Dennett spit book on 

2497
02:30:36,561 --> 02:30:39,020
explaining consciousness and it does 
nothing of the sort.

2498
02:30:39,500 --> 02:30:41,510
It explains it away.
And that's that.

2499
02:30:41,511 --> 02:30:43,370
And many critics have made the same 
comment.

2500
02:30:43,910 --> 02:30:47,150
But I also think that phenomenologically
speaking,

2501
02:30:47,180 --> 02:30:52,180
it is the case that we seem to encounter
the world as a field of possibility from

2502
02:30:53,001 --> 02:30:56,060
which we extract out choices.
You know,

2503
02:30:56,061 --> 02:30:56,870
you think,
well,

2504
02:30:56,870 --> 02:30:58,880
when I talked to you about your future,
I mean,

2505
02:30:58,881 --> 02:31:02,630
you know what your future is.
It's a branching set of pathways,

2506
02:31:02,690 --> 02:31:05,990
which you can envision because you,
you can envision the future.

2507
02:31:05,991 --> 02:31:08,060
It's one of the very strange things 
about being human.

2508
02:31:08,300 --> 02:31:09,133
It's a branching set of pathways of 
possibilities and you can pick from 

2509
02:31:12,891 --> 02:31:13,724
among them.
And I do believe that's what you're 

2510
02:31:15,741 --> 02:31:16,574
doing is I do believe that the world is 
a well of possibility and potential and 

2511
02:31:20,251 --> 02:31:24,090
that you interact with it by choice and 
transform it,

2512
02:31:24,150 --> 02:31:27,720
it within your limited power into what 
you wanted to be.

2513
02:31:28,270 --> 02:31:29,103
And,

2514
02:31:31,280 --> 02:31:33,770
and I don't think there's any evidence 
to the contrary.

2515
02:31:33,880 --> 02:31:38,570
And besides determinism is a,
is a scientific philosophy that probably

2516
02:31:38,571 --> 02:31:41,810
lost it's vogue in about 1850.
So,

2517
02:31:41,870 --> 02:31:44,240
you know,
there's no,

2518
02:31:44,270 --> 02:31:49,270
there's just no reason to from a 
scientific perspective to describe human

2519
02:31:49,371 --> 02:31:52,490
beings as deterministic creatures.
There's no evidence for it.

2520
02:31:52,700 --> 02:31:53,533
So we're partly determined obviously,
because there's lots of things we can't 

2521
02:31:57,411 --> 02:31:58,244
do,
but that does not by any stretch of the 

2522
02:32:00,591 --> 02:32:02,560
imagination mean we're fully determined 
yet.

2523
02:32:02,810 --> 02:32:03,643
So,

2524
02:32:07,530 --> 02:32:08,363
yeah.

2525
02:32:09,800 --> 02:32:11,690
Can I just add to that that,
I mean,

2526
02:32:11,691 --> 02:32:14,090
first of all,
that's a thoroughly Orthodox answer.

2527
02:32:14,180 --> 02:32:15,220
I have to say.
Um,

2528
02:32:16,010 --> 02:32:19,640
we only can deal with what we have in 
front of us.

2529
02:32:19,700 --> 02:32:20,533
I mean,
picking up on Jonathan's point earlier 

2530
02:32:21,501 --> 02:32:22,334
about experience and our our own going 
forward with the church fathers tell us 

2531
02:32:26,870 --> 02:32:31,040
the contrary to this scientific notion 
of,

2532
02:32:31,190 --> 02:32:34,310
you know,
time moving forward at a kind of regular

2533
02:32:34,311 --> 02:32:36,560
rate or anything that we might have 
conceived in our minds.

2534
02:32:36,820 --> 02:32:41,240
It actually,
each infinitesimally small moment of our

2535
02:32:41,241 --> 02:32:42,074
existence is pregnant with infinite 
possibility and so it's precisely what 

2536
02:32:47,421 --> 02:32:50,750
has just been set that we have that 
within our grasp.

2537
02:32:50,780 --> 02:32:51,613
If only we have the eyes to see it,
the only we have the hearts and minds 

2538
02:32:54,261 --> 02:32:55,094
oriented to that,
the logos guiding us then I mean the 

2539
02:32:58,281 --> 02:33:03,281
church fathers talk about the fact that 
we can actually experience infinity.

2540
02:33:04,770 --> 02:33:05,100
Okay.

2541
02:33:05,100 --> 02:33:08,000
In the tiniest of moments.
That's what fails.

2542
02:33:08,001 --> 02:33:08,834
This is all about,
that's what coming into contact with 

2543
02:33:10,620 --> 02:33:12,930
uncreated energies is all about.
In the,

2544
02:33:12,931 --> 02:33:17,931
in the eastern spiritual tradition,
that time and space are elastic.

2545
02:33:18,180 --> 02:33:19,013
We knew that before Einstein ever even 
was born and that's what we have in 

2546
02:33:23,551 --> 02:33:24,384
front of us.
So let's not get into philosophical 

2547
02:33:26,430 --> 02:33:31,160
arguments about how God works and how he
sees his precisely other Ted's points.

2548
02:33:31,170 --> 02:33:35,790
I mean that's irrelevant.
What we know is that every tiny,

2549
02:33:35,791 --> 02:33:36,624
tiny moment of every day and every space
of this macro cosmos is the possibility 

2550
02:33:41,821 --> 02:33:45,990
of encountering the infinite and that 
that's what we have to reach forward and

2551
02:33:45,991 --> 02:33:46,824
grasp.
And that's what our whole tradition is 

2552
02:33:48,451 --> 02:33:49,920
about.
And so absolutely,

2553
02:33:49,921 --> 02:33:50,754
it is our position on that point.
So we don't get into debates about 

2554
02:33:54,420 --> 02:33:56,090
predestination and,
and,

2555
02:33:56,091 --> 02:33:58,260
and not,
it's irrelevant to us.

2556
02:33:58,290 --> 02:34:01,590
We just need to grab a hold of God where
he is,

2557
02:34:01,591 --> 02:34:04,680
which is right now in this moment,
in this space as we are.

2558
02:34:05,190 --> 02:34:06,023
Yeah.

2559
02:34:07,020 --> 02:34:07,853
Thank you very much father,
and thank you very much to each and 

2560
02:34:10,411 --> 02:34:12,180
every one of our panelists.
Uh,

2561
02:34:12,360 --> 02:34:14,610
could I just get a round of applause for
all of you

2562
02:34:34,200 --> 02:34:35,033
to conclude this night?
Thank you to absolutely everyone for 

2563
02:34:37,641 --> 02:34:40,760
coming.
I hope we've managed to learn a lot.

2564
02:34:40,790 --> 02:34:41,623
This has been recorded.
So just in case this was too much 

2565
02:34:43,581 --> 02:34:46,310
information to take in,
which is certainly was for me,

2566
02:34:46,520 --> 02:34:49,120
it will be available at some point or 
another.

2567
02:34:49,130 --> 02:34:51,050
So once again,
thank you all for coming out.
