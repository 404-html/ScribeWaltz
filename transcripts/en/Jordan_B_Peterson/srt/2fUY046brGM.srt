1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,460
Oh,
we've started to talk about

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,140
existentialism from the perspective of
the individual,

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:12,383
but it's necessary to also understand 
the individual in relationship to the 

4
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:18,654
hole.
And when you're speaking about 

5
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:25,680
existential
personality theory,

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,300
it's even more important to place the 
individual in a broader context.

7
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,960
And the reason for that,
at least in part is because

8
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:39,683
it's while it's for two reasons,
is it's that the initial existential 

9
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:43,344
theorists,
most particularly Nietzsche and 

10
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:47,034
Dostoevsky,
we're very interested in the political 

11
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,650
consequences of inauthenticity now need 
you to believe that it was the drive for

12
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:02,490
truth that had been hyper developed in 
Europe,

13
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:03,653
at least from a technical perspective by
European submission to Cath Wallace for 

14
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,660
thousands of years that eventually 
overthrew

15
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,173
Christianity in its dogmatic form.
But he also believed that the 

16
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:22,620
consequences of that would be

17
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,650
the weakening of the individual human 
being,

18
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,310
at least initially who was then more or 
less cast adrift,

19
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:32,803
but even more importantly,
that there would be dire political 

20
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:37,664
consequences.
And he was particularly concerned about 

21
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:43,004
the potential for collective 
collectivist thinking to exert a 

22
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,940
murderous hold over the modern world.
Now,

23
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:58,210
interestingly at exactly the same time,
it's so remarkable how much niches,

24
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,300
life and Dostoyevsky's life parallel one
another.

25
00:02:02,301 --> 00:02:03,134
It's really as if they were two sides of
the same person because Nisha was 

26
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:14,201
philosophizing more or less explicitly.
Well Dostoyevsky who's exploring exactly

27
00:02:15,381 --> 00:02:16,214
the same themes in his writing.
And there's multiple forms of this 

28
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:24,440
parallelism.
So for example,

29
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,113
when Nisha was,
the idea is that nature was working out 

30
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:29,024
and beyond good and evil.
We're the same ideas that possessed in 

31
00:02:33,831 --> 00:02:34,664
many ways that possessed Dostoyevsky's 
character ruskell called Nikolaihov in 

32
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:43,390
crime and punishment,
which is a pretty nice parallel title to

33
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:44,840
go beyond good and evil.

34
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,113
And then even more interestingly,
dusty minsky wrote a novel called the 

35
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:55,910
possessed or the devils,
which I think is the least accessible of

36
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:57,750
his great novels.
Um,

37
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,270
it about,
you know,

38
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,590
Dostoyevsky's great novels are very 
long,

39
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:03,424
like great Russian novels tend to be,
and they have a very large cast of 

40
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,450
characters and all of the characters 
have three names,

41
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,613
plus they have nicknames.
And so it's quite difficult to keep 

42
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:18,190
track of them.
And it takes quite a long time.

43
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:22,300
I think for a modern reader,
especially one who's not familiar with,

44
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,410
with with Russia or Russian literature 
to,

45
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,970
to have it all come together in a 
coherent narrative hole.

46
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:34,900
And that's most pronounced I think in 
his book the devils.

47
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,263
But the devil's is an unbelievably 
interesting book because it describes 

48
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:43,384
individual psychopathology and in some 
ways the same way that dusty Husky does 

49
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:47,604
it notes from underground,
but it links it to this susceptibility 

50
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:54,240
to a certain kind of,
uh,

51
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,120
political extremism and utopianism in a 
very direct way.

52
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,940
And so in nodes for underground for 
example,

53
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,890
the main character is very 
psychologically week,

54
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,610
partly because he doesn't believe in 
anything.

55
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,520
And so because he doesn't believe in 
anything,

56
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,980
even if he's offended,
even if he finds something,

57
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,740
um,
unacceptable,

58
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:21,574
personally,
he finds it very difficult to stand up 

59
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:24,364
in,
up in opposition to it or even to stand 

60
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:30,130
up for himself because he's so full of 
doubt that he questions everything he,

61
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,053
he does.
And Dostoyevsky presents the main 

62
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:39,091
character in notes from underground as 
someone who's fragmented to the point of

63
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:40,054
radical uncertainty.
Now his characters in the devils have 

64
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:50,230
the same underlying problem,
which is in some sense the demolition of

65
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:51,064
the integrity of their personalities by 
the collapse of their formal individual 

66
00:04:57,701 --> 00:04:58,534
and collective belief systems.
But instead of becoming riven by 

67
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:04,060
uncertainty,
uncertainty,

68
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,810
and doubt,
they become possessed by certainty.

69
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,600
And hence the name the devils are the 
possessed.

70
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,673
I mentioned to you at one point that 
young famously claimed that people 

71
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,970
didn't have ideas,
that ideas had people,

72
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,720
which I think is one of the loveliest 
lines I've ever come across.

73
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:23,331
It's,
it's,

74
00:05:23,331 --> 00:05:26,560
it's so brilliant,
but Dostoyevsky's novel,

75
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:30,970
the possessed is about how ideas have 
people.

76
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,840
And his main character in that novel,
if I recollect properly,

77
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:42,001
is named Stavenhagen and staff Oregon is
the kind of nihilistic thinker who turns

78
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:44,284
to totalitarianism.
And basically what happens in the 

79
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,703
devil's is that he turns to precisely 
the ideas that also manifested 

80
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:55,660
themselves in radical Marxism.
And then later,

81
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,583
because the possessed was written quite 
a bit before the death of the czar and 

82
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:02,510
the Russian revolution,
you know,

83
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,673
several decades before that.
But Dostoyevsky felt that these ideas 

84
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:08,264
were in the air in some sense as an 
alternative to classical European 

85
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:14,084
thought,
including not only classical religious 

86
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:18,374
thought,
but also classical enlightenment 

87
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:20,294
thought.

88
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,420
Now,
tolstoy wrote a book called confessions,

89
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:26,300
which I would very much recommend 
reading.

90
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:28,460
It's a very short book and hidden 
confessions.

91
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,623
What happens to tolstoy as he talks 
about his experience in Russia when the 

92
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:39,350
news of the death of God,
in some sense swept across Russia in,

93
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:40,300
uh,
in us,

94
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,990
uh,
a sudden storm.

95
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:42,973
The Russians had been futile for a very 
long period of time and they were 

96
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:49,100
backwards in many ways compared to the 
rest of Europe.

97
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,413
And they had stuck in their mid evil 
cultural form far longer than most 

98
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,480
European states.
But when that collapsed,

99
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:04,340
it collapsed with amazing sudden with,
with amazing instant tenacity.

100
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,174
And tolstoy writes in the confessions 
about remembering when the idea first 

101
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:14,330
dawned on him and many other people 
simultaneously,

102
00:07:14,331 --> 00:07:19,331
that the entire edifice of Orthodox 
Christianity was no longer tenable.

103
00:07:19,611 --> 00:07:20,444
And then what happens with tolstoy and 
confession is that he describes his 

104
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,313
absolute collapse as a integrated 
psychological being in his descent into 

105
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:29,444
the underworld,
roughly speaking tolstoy at the height 

106
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:32,870
of his success.

107
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,170
And he was the most successful author in
the world at one point.

108
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,060
Certainly.
And perhaps,

109
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,950
you know,
people still argue that maybe he was the

110
00:07:39,951 --> 00:07:41,750
greatest author,
whoever lived,

111
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:44,060
although I think Dostoyevsky deserves 
that title,

112
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,223
but I'm more of a psychologist and a 
sociologist and tolstoy who was a 

113
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:48,404
sociologist.
Tolstoy was unwilling to wander around 

114
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:53,174
his estates with either a gun or with a 
rope nearby because he was afraid that 

115
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:01,850
he would either shoot or hang himself.
And it's because he,

116
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,110
despite his fame and his greatest states
in his political,

117
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,720
uh,
his political work,

118
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,750
he was very interested in the 
emancipation of the serfs.

119
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:16,751
For example,
he concluded in some sense that life was

120
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:19,670
an evil joke.
It was as if life was an evil joke,

121
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:20,504
being played on mankind by a cruel 
creator and that everything was 

122
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:27,860
ultimately meaningless,
but finite.

123
00:08:27,861 --> 00:08:30,250
Lee,
terrible and,

124
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,193
and,
and generating nothing but pointless 

125
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,180
suffering and tolstoy,
he said very,

126
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,940
very clearly that are,
uh,

127
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:39,803
um,
a man with conviction who came to that 

128
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:47,600
conclusion could only continue to live 
by diluting himself.

129
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,393
And he thought,
he thought he couldn't think him self 

130
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:54,044
out of the proposition,
that his unwillingness to kill himself 

131
00:08:58,021 --> 00:09:01,470
was a form of cowardice once he had come
to that realization.

132
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,400
And so confession is about that.
And you know,

133
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:09,300
he tries to turn to the kind of religion
that characterize the Russian peasantry,

134
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:10,920
which would be,
you know,

135
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,420
in some sense an ignorant immersion in 
beliefs that intellect had superseded.

136
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,160
But of course that wasn't available to 
him.

137
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,383
And at the end of confession,
something happens to Tolstoy to redeem 

138
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,860
him in a sense,
but all it is,

139
00:09:23,861 --> 00:09:26,850
is his dream.
And he dreams of this.

140
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:32,060
He dreams that he's suspended over a 
great abyss by a rope and as far down as

141
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,350
he can look,
there's nothing but empty space.

142
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:35,184
But then he turns to look up and he can 
see the same rope above him stretching 

143
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:41,550
up into the sky as far as it can reach.

144
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,130
And that's basically how the book ends.
And you know,

145
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,993
the inference is something like 
tolstoy's dream revealed to him the 

146
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:53,961
proposition that although there were a 
bismal depths beneath mankind,

147
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:56,220
so to speak,
from a psychological perspective,

148
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,650
that we were also supported by something
infinite.

149
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,680
But it's not articulated like the whole 
book just ends with the dream so well.

150
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:10,881
So Dostoyevsky lays out the,
the underground political movements that

151
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:13,464
were characteristic of late
the late 19 or the late 18 hundreds in 

152
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:19,643
Russia.
And he describes the emergence of the 

153
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:28,131
type of person who ends up after the 
Russian revolution,

154
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:33,950
after the first world war,
becoming a committed and involved in the

155
00:10:36,091 --> 00:10:36,924
collectivization process in Russia.
And it's virtually impossible to 

156
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:41,874
overstate how terrible the 
collectivization process was right from 

157
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:48,840
its onset.
You know,

158
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:53,580
you'll still hear apologists for Marxism
and communism.

159
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,473
Talk about the fact that the Soviet 
Union was captured by a cult of 

160
00:10:57,601 --> 00:10:59,940
personality under Stalin.

161
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,200
And that that's why the ethical 
presuppositions of,

162
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,213
of,
of Marxism transformed into political 

163
00:11:07,881 --> 00:11:12,881
action became so corrupted.
But I think that's absolute nonsense and

164
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,940
I think it's nonsense of the most 
dangerous and reprehensible type.

165
00:11:17,941 --> 00:11:22,941
And I think that for two reasons,
the first reason was stolen was uh,

166
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:28,020
unbelievably murderous thug.
He pretty much killed everyone he knew,

167
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,930
including almost all of the,
they call them.

168
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:35,010
What were they?
I don't remember that the term.

169
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,650
They were old revolutionaries,
all of the

170
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,073
Bolsheviks who ran the revolution,
who didn't die during the revolution or 

171
00:11:45,241 --> 00:11:48,960
of natural causes afterwards,
they were all killed by Stalin.

172
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:53,440
He probably killed his wife.
He killed pretty much everybody he knew.

173
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,790
I mean,
he was,

174
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,043
and he was a like an underground 
operative for Lenin during the 

175
00:11:58,691 --> 00:12:02,920
revolution itself,
where he learned to be committed from an

176
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,813
ideological perspective.
He'd come from quite an intensely 

177
00:12:05,921 --> 00:12:06,754
religious background,
committed from an ideological 

178
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:09,244
perspective,
but then basically as acting as a 

179
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,650
gorilla assassin during the revolution 
itself.

180
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,483
And then later he rose to power it.
He certainly used Lennon's political 

181
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,150
machinations as a machinations,
as a,

182
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,930
um,
as a template for his later activity.

183
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:31,210
But Lennon was no piker when it came to 
extraordinarily

184
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:37,710
brutal activity motivated by Utopian 
dreams.

185
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:39,903
Now,
what seemed to happen in some sense is 

186
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:47,221
that you can imagine we're looking at 
the political structure,

187
00:12:47,261 --> 00:12:49,180
the political movements of whole 
nations.

188
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,043
We're going down to the bottom to look 
at it from a psychological perspective 

189
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,673
instead of thinking it of it from an 
economic perspective or a power 

190
00:12:56,531 --> 00:12:58,750
perspective.
In some sense it's a,

191
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:04,170
it's a union analysis of the rise of 
political movements in,

192
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,370
in Europe and across the world with an 
existential spin.

193
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:12,903
You can imagine that what classical 
Christianity had set up for people was 

194
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,190
not only a belief in,
in,

195
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:18,761
uh,
uh,

196
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:19,594
shared moral reality that,
that everyone was supposed to be 

197
00:13:21,971 --> 00:13:25,810
participating in,
but also some meaning for,

198
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:30,310
for some meaning for each individual's 
life to some degree,

199
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:31,144
no matter how much they were suffering.
And then the promise of a kind of 

200
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:34,534
perfection after death.
And of course people like Freud and 

201
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:41,210
people like Marx considered that,
uh,

202
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,000
an illusion designed either to protect 
the population from fear of death.

203
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:48,510
So that would be Freud's argument or 
marks.

204
00:13:48,511 --> 00:13:49,630
His argument would be,
well,

205
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:50,464
that that was,
uh,

206
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,653
a conspiracy in some sense,
promoted by the political and religious 

207
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:59,440
elite to keep the people who are being 
oppressed in their place.

208
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,473
Well,
of course there's some truth to both of 

209
00:14:03,221 --> 00:14:04,054
those,
but there's a difference between some 

210
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:06,394
truth and that truth and any 
extraordinarily complex phenomena has 

211
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:11,800
multiple causal elements.

212
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,633
And those are two important ones because
of course an anxiety about death and 

213
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:21,820
power are two very important 
psychological phenomena.

214
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:22,863
And they play their role in determining 
any important collective or individual 

215
00:14:27,251 --> 00:14:28,084
activity.
But you can't forget about the rest of 

216
00:14:29,981 --> 00:14:30,960
the,
uh,

217
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:31,893
the rest of the story now.
So this collapses and that leaves a 

218
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:35,794
void.
And that void is a void in people's 

219
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:39,460
souls,
so to speak.

220
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,410
It makes them nihilistic,
for example,

221
00:14:41,411 --> 00:14:42,244
because they don't have any,
they can't see any ultimate meaning in 

222
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:44,764
what they're doing.
But it also simultaneously makes them 

223
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:52,770
more susceptible to utopian mass 
movements of a rational type.

224
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:54,494
And of course,
that's exactly what happened with 

225
00:14:55,851 --> 00:14:58,700
regards to the Marxists.
And with regards to the fascist.

226
00:14:58,701 --> 00:14:59,534
So what Hitler offered his followers in 
collaboration with them because it 

227
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:08,351
wasn't so much that Hitler told people 
what he wanted them to think as it was,

228
00:15:09,861 --> 00:15:10,694
that Hitler listened to what the crowd's
wanted and then told it back to them in 

229
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,544
our collaboration that extended across 
his entire rule because Hitler was a 

230
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:24,320
great populist and he was very,
very good at receiving messages from the

231
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:25,154
audience.

232
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,280
But Hitler basically offered his pr,
his population,

233
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,540
the dream of racial superiority and 
world domination,

234
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,770
you know,
as well as many,

235
00:15:33,771 --> 00:15:36,260
many other things that went along with 
that.

236
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,970
So,
and then of course,

237
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,103
Mark's offered his followers the idea 
that the oppressed could shed their 

238
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:47,500
chains and that everyone could unite 
workers at intellectuals alike.

239
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,950
In particular,
it was the,

240
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,380
it was more the,
the owner,

241
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:56,060
the owning class,
the bourgeois as they're still called by

242
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:56,894
some people who were the,
the evil oppressors and the Union of 

243
00:16:00,741 --> 00:16:01,574
worker and intellectual would eventually
shepherd in a golden age where everyone 

244
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,293
offered to society as much as they could
offer and took from society as much as 

245
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:12,801
they need it.
Right.

246
00:16:12,801 --> 00:16:13,634
And that's the famous phrase from each 
according to his ability to each 

247
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,320
according to his need,
which sounds wonderful.

248
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,193
You can,
I can understand why that would be an 

249
00:16:23,631 --> 00:16:26,390
attractive slogan,
but if you start to think about how that

250
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:30,950
would be administered in practice and 
you really start to think it through,

251
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,023
you realize very,
very rapidly that it's a re it's a 

252
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:37,520
recipe for absolute disaster,
partly because,

253
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,133
well,
how do you tell the difference between 

254
00:16:40,461 --> 00:16:41,450
your need and your need?

255
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,283
If your mother needs cancer surgery and 
your genius brother needs to do go do 

256
00:16:46,431 --> 00:16:49,970
his phd,
who's need trump's while.

257
00:16:49,971 --> 00:16:50,804
And that's just a trivial problem 
because all of you have those competing 

258
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:59,530
needs and how anybody is ever going to 
adjudicate between the value of needs is

259
00:17:01,971 --> 00:17:06,971
beyond cognitive comprehension.
It just can't be done.

260
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,263
Not without brutality,
especially because you know there's 

261
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:13,010
limited resources.
And then the next question is,

262
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:13,491
well,
okay,

263
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,800
you're supposed to contribute according 
to your ability.

264
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:21,380
How much ability do you have?
You know what that meant in practice?

265
00:17:21,381 --> 00:17:22,214
That was that people were frequently 
worked to death because the ability 

266
00:17:25,701 --> 00:17:27,710
isn't a definable entity.
You know,

267
00:17:27,711 --> 00:17:32,360
and unless you have some sort of
complicated

268
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:34,723
and functional system to negotiate,
to allow people to negotiate amongst 

269
00:17:39,411 --> 00:17:43,580
themselves peaceably about what they're 
going to offer and what they're going to

270
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:44,414
take,
you have to turn it over to something 

271
00:17:46,461 --> 00:17:47,900
like a centralized authority.

272
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,710
And you know,
it's just,

273
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,903
well,
you don't need much imagination to 

274
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,090
understand that that would be an 
absolute catastrophe.

275
00:17:54,091 --> 00:17:57,750
And it was an absolute catastrophe.
Now,

276
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,990
one of the things that's really 
interesting about Dostoyevsky's book,

277
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:01,824
the Devil's,
is that it's segues almost perfectly 

278
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:05,874
into Alexandria soldier.
Nixon's description of the emergence of 

279
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:10,404
the Russian prisoners,
the so Soviet prison camps after the 

280
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:15,570
revolution.
So basically what happened,

281
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:16,404
and this was what Solzhenitsyn revealed 
in the 1970s was that because the 

282
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:23,520
communist system was so financially 
untenable,

283
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:26,760
the principals just didn't work for all 
sorts of reasons.

284
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,970
They,
the system ended up running basically on

285
00:18:29,971 --> 00:18:34,740
a system of work camps and so much of 
what the Russians produced,

286
00:18:34,741 --> 00:18:37,110
the Soviets produced,
which wasn't very much by the way,

287
00:18:37,111 --> 00:18:39,330
although they got industrialized very,
very rapidly,

288
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,540
was produced by people who were 
basically enslaved,

289
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,290
and that's the only way the system could
continue to function.

290
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,153
Now,
soldier Nixon estimated that between 19 

291
00:18:51,181 --> 00:18:56,181
and nine 1919 which is basically the end
of the first world war and 1959 which is

292
00:18:57,331 --> 00:19:00,090
basically when the Stalinist era came to
an end.

293
00:19:00,091 --> 00:19:00,924
So that's only 40 years that 60 million 
people were killed in the Soviet Union 

294
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:11,990
as a consequence of internal repression.
I didn't count the Second World War.

295
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:18,050
Now people debate these figures and 
soldier Nansen is surprisingly to me,

296
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,140
a controversial figure because I don't 
see where the controversy is.

297
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,243
People complain about his numbers,
claiming that our death count of 60 

298
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:32,970
million people over that period of time 
is mathematically untenable,

299
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,350
but reason more reasonable estimates if 
you want to put it that way,

300
00:19:37,351 --> 00:19:42,090
put it up to 20 or 30 million.
And that the truth of the matter is that

301
00:19:42,091 --> 00:19:44,370
no one knows.
And that even makes it worse.

302
00:19:44,371 --> 00:19:45,181
I mean,
we do know,

303
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:47,430
for example,
that um,

304
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,733
the a sat collectivization in the 1920s 
led to the creation of a agricultural 

305
00:19:56,461 --> 00:20:01,461
catastrophe
made worse by Stalin's peculiar economic

306
00:20:03,281 --> 00:20:06,970
policies that killed 6 million people in
the,

307
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,450
in the Ukraine in the 1930s.
Now,

308
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:16,110
how many of you knew that?
How many of you know about the Ukrainian

309
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,040
famine?
How many didn't know?

310
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:22,840
Okay?
One thing you might want to ask yourself

311
00:20:22,841 --> 00:20:24,580
is,
why the hell don't you know

312
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,031
it all?
You know,

313
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:30,960
lots of things about the mass death sin 
in the 20th century,

314
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,093
but my experience has been that students
in the West know almost nothing about 

315
00:20:36,451 --> 00:20:37,284
what happened as a consequence of the 
imposition of radical left wing 

316
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:44,190
dictatorships.
And it's not trivial.

317
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,833
30 million in the Soviet Union.
Let's 6 million in Cambodia under Pol 

318
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:54,040
Pot.
Pol Pot was trained at the sore bomb and

319
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:54,874
he took what he learned at the Sorbonne 
from his radical left wing professors 

320
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:59,463
and put it into practice in Cambodia.
Emptied out the cities because he had 

321
00:21:03,311 --> 00:21:04,144
learned that under Standard Marxists,
Dogma city people who are mostly 

322
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:08,794
bourgeois were parasites on the workers.
He emptied the cities and killed 6 

323
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,350
million people and then in China during 
Mao's cultural revolution,

324
00:21:17,351 --> 00:21:18,184
while no one really knows soldier nest 
Solzhenitsyn's estimates were 100 

325
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,400
million,
but you can take half that if you want.

326
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,103
These are massive,
massive numbers of people and part of 

327
00:21:30,491 --> 00:21:31,324
the reason that I think it's 
reprehensible to pin the absolute 

328
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,503
catastrophes of the Soviet state on the 
style in this cult of personality was 

329
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:45,820
that it didn't only happen in the Soviet
Union.

330
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:47,643
It happened with,
with catastrophic results in all sorts 

331
00:21:52,121 --> 00:21:56,530
of places where these economic policies 
were implemented.

332
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:02,140
And I believe that the reason that 
western students,

333
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,870
roughly speaking,
don't know about these things,

334
00:22:04,871 --> 00:22:05,704
is that

335
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,540
the,
the,

336
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,640
the intelligentsia of the West Europe 
and North America,

337
00:22:13,641 --> 00:22:14,474
we're going to save for the time being,
we're so heavily influenced by radical 

338
00:22:19,281 --> 00:22:24,281
left wing ideas from the 1920s well to 
the present day that

339
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,830
these facts have never been made as,
uh,

340
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:35,890
have never been disseminated in his 
thorough manner as is only appropriate.

341
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,900
So the French intellectuals,
for example,

342
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:42,920
from whom postmodernism derived,
uh,

343
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:43,783
people like John Paul Sartre and food co
and a very large group of French 

344
00:22:47,961 --> 00:22:48,794
intellectuals who were involved in the 
student radical left student movements 

345
00:22:52,731 --> 00:22:53,564
in the late 1960s and who ended up 
barricading the streets of Paris in 

346
00:22:57,471 --> 00:22:58,304
1968,
which is when the student movement sort 

347
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,570
of peaked and then,
and then fell away.

348
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,093
Um,
they never apologized in any real sense 

349
00:23:07,581 --> 00:23:11,330
for there.
The fact of being enamored of,

350
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:16,780
well at least in part the policies of 
Stalin and also the policies of Mau.

351
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:23,470
And there's no excuse for that.
So now the problem is of course,

352
00:23:24,051 --> 00:23:24,884
is that left wing radical,
left wing political and economic ideas 

353
00:23:28,761 --> 00:23:29,594
are intellectually quite coherent.
Like they make sense once you accept a 

354
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,204
certain set of axioms,
like from each according to his ability 

355
00:23:38,151 --> 00:23:41,450
to each according to his need.
You accept that axiom,

356
00:23:41,451 --> 00:23:46,310
you accept the idea that the,
the capital class,

357
00:23:46,311 --> 00:23:47,144
the capitalist class,
which is roughly anyone who owns 

358
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:50,054
anything,
only owns what they owned because 

359
00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:52,904
they've stolen it from someone else so 
that there's labor is productive but 

360
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,453
nothing else is productive.
Everything else is a secondary 

361
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:02,510
derivation of labor.
And you know,

362
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:03,344
that's an absolutely moronic economic 
theory because obviously there's work 

363
00:24:08,661 --> 00:24:10,970
that has value,
there's work that has no value.

364
00:24:10,971 --> 00:24:14,930
The fact that it's difficult has almost 
no relationship to whether or not it has

365
00:24:14,931 --> 00:24:16,460
value.
Unfortunately,

366
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,673
you know,
it's not like the political system or 

367
00:24:18,921 --> 00:24:22,460
the economic system is a perfect mirror 
of effort.

368
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,550
It's not like that at all.
So

369
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,320
you might say that.

370
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,413
Okay,

371
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,513
well I would say really what happened in
the 20th century is once people stopped 

372
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:49,291
worshiping an externalized Daddy,
they started to worship.

373
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:54,580
If they were intelligent,
they started to worship rational utopian

374
00:24:54,581 --> 00:24:57,610
ideas and if they weren't as 
intelligent,

375
00:24:57,611 --> 00:25:01,690
they turned to the state like 
identification with the state,

376
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:02,883
like the Nazis for example,
identification with the state as an 

377
00:25:05,861 --> 00:25:10,861
alternative source of collective power 
and both of those were

378
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:18,370
in comprehensively devastated and we're 
not done with it yet.

379
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,353
You know?
I mean,

380
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:24,320
one of the things that happened in the 
Soviet Union and soldier Hinson,

381
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:29,960
one of whose I have you read one of his,
the chapters of the Gulag archipelago,

382
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:30,794
which is an amazing piece of writing.
What are the things that Solzhenitsyn's 

383
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,630
soldier knits and points out is there 
was this extensive prison camp system in

384
00:25:38,631 --> 00:25:41,150
the Soviet Union that he called the 
Gulag archipelago.

385
00:25:41,151 --> 00:25:41,984
It was this chain of camps all across 
the Soviet Union and if you were thrown 

386
00:25:45,531 --> 00:25:47,420
in there because you were a political 
prisoner,

387
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,403
you are the worst kind of prisoner and 
you could be thrown in there as a 

388
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:52,874
political prisoner pretty much for 
expressing any opinion whatsoever about 

389
00:25:55,881 --> 00:25:58,370
the state,
which is we're going to get back to that

390
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,010
as we tie this together with 
existentialism.

391
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:02,383
Now the communists,
we regarded the murderers and the 

392
00:26:04,821 --> 00:26:09,560
rapists and the thieves as socially 
friendly elements because it was a,

393
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:10,923
it was part of Marxist doctrine that the
only reason that you would become a 

394
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:14,774
murderer or a thief or a rapist was 
because you were part of the no press 

395
00:26:18,261 --> 00:26:22,040
class and your poverty was what 
generated your crime.

396
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,850
So in some sense you couldn't be held 
personally responsible for it.

397
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:26,983
And the upshot of that was that the 
thieves and the rapists and murderers 

398
00:26:29,781 --> 00:26:31,040
ran the prisons.

399
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,290
Well,
Russia right now is a mafia state.

400
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,450
There's evidence,
for example,

401
00:26:38,451 --> 00:26:42,290
that Putin is the richest man in the 
world and he has

402
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:48,780
almost singular power over this or over 
the affairs of the Soviet Union,

403
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:51,930
the former Soviet Union,
the Russians,

404
00:26:51,931 --> 00:26:52,764
the Soviets killed anybody that had any 
capacity for independent thought and 

405
00:26:56,731 --> 00:27:00,480
they raised the thugs to,
to the highest positions of authority.

406
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:04,230
And you guys are going to be dealing 
with that for the rest of your life.

407
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:08,550
So if you think that that's changed,
you're wrong.

408
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,473
It hasn't changed at all.
Russia has just transformed from a 

409
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,570
totalitarian communist state into a 
Mafia state.

410
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,790
And that's a big problem.

411
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,340
Okay.

412
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,110
So we're not done with this yet.

413
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,940
And one of the things that soldier 
Nixon,

414
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:30,620
he was,
this is why I use him as a psychological

415
00:27:30,621 --> 00:27:32,120
thinker.
You know,

416
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:36,420
people generally consider Viktor Frankl,
um,

417
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,223
that the primary
existential psychologist or 

418
00:27:43,101 --> 00:27:45,950
psychiatrist,
now Victor Frankel came through the Nazi

419
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,900
prison counts and he developed logo 
therapy as a consequence of that.

420
00:27:50,901 --> 00:27:51,734
And logotherapy what part of the 
principles of logotherapy were laid 

421
00:27:55,311 --> 00:27:57,710
forth in his book.
Man's search for meaning.

422
00:27:57,711 --> 00:27:58,544
And one of Frankel's propositions was 
essentially that because life is 

423
00:28:02,691 --> 00:28:03,524
suffering and,
and can be unbearable suffering that 

424
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,793
it's necessary for people to have are 
countervailing meaning to buttress 

425
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:15,110
themselves against the tragedy of 
existence.

426
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:20,240
And Frankl basically claimed,
and this is an existential claim that if

427
00:28:20,241 --> 00:28:21,074
you,
that you could find that meaning and 

428
00:28:23,541 --> 00:28:24,374
collective belief,
but that there were terrible dangers 

429
00:28:27,261 --> 00:28:31,340
associated with that.
And so your moral obligation was to find

430
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,720
that meaning within the confines of your
own authentic individual life.

431
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,553
And you can see that sort of idea also 
arising in the thought of Carl Rogers 

432
00:28:41,091 --> 00:28:42,060
for example.
And at the end,

433
00:28:42,061 --> 00:28:42,894
it's also there in noon because of 
course you don't believe that there was 

434
00:28:45,921 --> 00:28:46,754
this path he called individuation,
which was the flowering and 

435
00:28:49,581 --> 00:28:52,880
manifestation of the healthy and 
integrated,

436
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,600
the deep,
healthy and integrated fundamental human

437
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:57,560
personality.
Of course,

438
00:28:57,561 --> 00:28:58,394
piaget believed something similar,
although more collective because for 

439
00:29:03,231 --> 00:29:04,064
piaget,
the hammering of your psyche into 

440
00:29:06,921 --> 00:29:07,754
something resembling an integrated state
also had to be done in active concert 

441
00:29:12,201 --> 00:29:14,000
with all of the people around you.
You know,

442
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:14,834
because you are organizing yourself into
a coherent internal game where all your 

443
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:22,040
little subpersonalities could find their
place.

444
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:27,041
Well simultaneously doing that with 
other people over long spans of time.

445
00:29:27,051 --> 00:29:28,700
But you can see this,
the theme,

446
00:29:28,701 --> 00:29:31,100
there's a theme that emerges in all of 
those thinkers.

447
00:29:31,101 --> 00:29:31,934
And one of the themes is this,
that there are healthy pathways to 

448
00:29:34,581 --> 00:29:39,320
psychological development and the 
existentialists in particular,

449
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:41,680
although this was also the case with 
young,

450
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,693
young,
worked as a secret agent for the 

451
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:44,674
American government and provided the 
president of the United States with 

452
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:50,050
psychological reports on Hitler's state 
of mind.

453
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,343
Now,
I wasn't even discovered until about 

454
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:53,224
three years ago.
So all of these thinkers were concerned 

455
00:29:57,191 --> 00:29:58,024
about collective pathology and at the 
same time concerned about individual 

456
00:30:01,961 --> 00:30:02,794
development.
And I don't think you can really 

457
00:30:03,641 --> 00:30:07,530
separate those things.
And the reason that I use soldier Nissen

458
00:30:07,531 --> 00:30:12,531
has,
because he basically takes the same tack

459
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:17,110
as Viktor Frankl,
especially in the Gulag archipelago,

460
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:20,560
but it's a much more thoroughly 
developed body of thought.

461
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:22,580
Like I'm an admirer of Frankel.
I think man,

462
00:30:22,581 --> 00:30:27,160
search for meaning is amazing book,
but it's a good book.

463
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:31,510
Whereas the Gulag archipelago is a 
devastatingly profound book.

464
00:30:31,511 --> 00:30:34,420
They're not in the same,
they're not in the same league.

465
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,500
You know,
it's,

466
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,500
it's like
Solzhenitsyn is to Viktor Frankl.

467
00:30:41,711 --> 00:30:44,830
What dusty Esky is to virtually any 
other author.

468
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:45,743
You know,
there's this,

469
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,100
I don't know what it is about the Damn 
Russians.

470
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,323
Maybe they're suffering has done 
something to them over the hundreds of 

471
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,330
years that it's been in place,
but they can produce,

472
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,270
people have unbelievable profundity as 
well as,

473
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,810
you know,
crooks who are crooked and,

474
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,400
and murderous beyond comprehension.

475
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,070
So,
you know,

476
00:31:06,071 --> 00:31:06,904
a soldier Nixon was very interested in 
trying to understand what happened to 

477
00:31:11,201 --> 00:31:12,034
the Soviet Union was how that it could,
how could it transform itself into a 

478
00:31:15,251 --> 00:31:16,084
state that devoured the majority or a 
vast minority of its citizens and often 

479
00:31:21,461 --> 00:31:22,294
the best of the citizenry.
I mean it was very common in the Soviet 

480
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,150
Union and this is through the entire 
Soviet block.

481
00:31:28,151 --> 00:31:30,820
I mean you were required to be an 
informer,

482
00:31:30,821 --> 00:31:31,654
roughly speaking,
you were certainly taught to be an 

483
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:35,440
informer at school.
And you know,

484
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,303
the Soviets made much of children who 
were patriotic enough to turn in their 

485
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:40,720
own parents.
You know,

486
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:45,520
they were held up as models of behavior 
and it was very frequently the case that

487
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:46,563
if you denounced the neighbor,
that was a really good waste way for 

488
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:50,284
your family to get their apartment.
And of course apartments were an 

489
00:31:52,601 --> 00:31:53,434
incredibly scarce supply and far too 
many people generally lived in the same 

490
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,320
locale.

491
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,153
And so if you were a three generation 
family living in a one bedroom 

492
00:32:03,551 --> 00:32:04,384
apartment,
one of the most effective ways to get 

493
00:32:06,071 --> 00:32:09,970
your children a new apartment was to 
denounce the neighbor down the hallway.

494
00:32:09,971 --> 00:32:12,580
And as a reward,
you'd be given the apartment.

495
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:16,390
While you can imagine who would take 
advantage of that kind of offer.

496
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,003
Now,
what happened in the 1920s during the 

497
00:32:19,391 --> 00:32:20,890
collectivization?
So here,

498
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,873
here's the idea of the serfs had been 
emancipated in the late 18 hundreds and 

499
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:31,321
they were basically feudal inhabitants 
of parcels of land who were more or less

500
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:36,490
old by the no nobility.
It wasn't exactly slavery,

501
00:32:36,491 --> 00:32:38,920
but because the serves has certain sets 
of rights,

502
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,363
it was,
it was closer to slavery than to 

503
00:32:42,841 --> 00:32:46,460
anything else that you would 
conceptualize from a modern perspective.

504
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:49,160
The serfs were emancipated in the late 
18 hundreds.

505
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,503
Um,
actually at about the same time that 

506
00:32:51,981 --> 00:32:54,290
slavery was abolished in the United 
States,

507
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,240
approximately the same period of time.

508
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,770
Anyways.
Um,

509
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,013
and so there was,
and of course that Russia had a very 

510
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:05,930
rich aristocracy and it had a monarchy.
And so the idea that,

511
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,940
and then it went through the first world
war and,

512
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,813
and,
and was viciously demolish during the 

513
00:33:10,731 --> 00:33:14,480
first world war.
The idea that there was an underclass of

514
00:33:14,481 --> 00:33:19,481
po of impoverished people and an 
overclass of Eris to Craddick,

515
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:24,560
uh,
parasites was a compelling idea.

516
00:33:24,561 --> 00:33:27,860
And it was a compelling idea in many 
places other than Russia,

517
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,470
um,
especially at the turn of the century.

518
00:33:30,471 --> 00:33:31,304
And that was partly because the 
industrial revolution was brutal and 

519
00:33:33,831 --> 00:33:38,120
farm life was very difficult and there 
was a massive gap between rich and poor.

520
00:33:38,121 --> 00:33:39,380
And you know,
that was,

521
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:43,370
that was an attractive political 
explanation.

522
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:44,204
And it had partial truth because of 
course people are exploited and often 

523
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,630
poor people are poor because they're 
exploited.

524
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,790
But there's lots of other reasons to be 
poor.

525
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,180
And rich people are sometimes rich 
because they exploit.

526
00:33:56,181 --> 00:33:59,150
But of course there's lots of other 
reasons to be rich as well.

527
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,730
So,
um,

528
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:08,530
these ideas were put into practice by 
the Bolshevik revolutionaries and one of

529
00:34:11,361 --> 00:34:12,194
the most,
one of the most comprehensive 

530
00:34:16,161 --> 00:34:16,994
manifestations of that idea.
It took place in the 1920s when the 

531
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:25,550
Soviets underwent a process that they 
call d Kulak ization.

532
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,100
Now,
so imagine this.

533
00:34:27,101 --> 00:34:27,934
So in the,
in the late 18 hundreds of the serfs 

534
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:33,830
were emancipated.
And what that meant was that some people

535
00:34:33,831 --> 00:34:35,870
started to own their own land.
You know,

536
00:34:35,871 --> 00:34:38,150
they weren't nobles that owned it,
owned the states.

537
00:34:38,151 --> 00:34:42,230
They were more like what we would 
consider sort of middleclass farmers.

538
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,080
So they owned some land,
they own some animals.

539
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:50,230
They might own a half decent house in 
the town and they might have done enough

540
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,213
or being fortunate enough to have 
collected enough money and enough 

541
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:56,804
property and enough stability so that 
they could hire one or two people to 

542
00:34:59,481 --> 00:35:01,340
help them with their crops.

543
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:04,340
So they were by no means rich,
but they were,

544
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:09,230
they were the successful farming,
um,

545
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:12,620
class of the Soviet Union.
Okay.

546
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:18,130
Now the communists put forward the idea 
that there is no way that you could have

547
00:35:19,101 --> 00:35:19,934
a brick house in town and own more cows 
than your neighbor and have some 

548
00:35:24,771 --> 00:35:27,050
productive land put aside.
And worst of all,

549
00:35:27,051 --> 00:35:27,884
hire someone to work for you unless you 
had essentially stolen that from your 

550
00:35:32,271 --> 00:35:33,104
neighbors.
So then the communists would send out 

551
00:35:35,631 --> 00:35:36,464
activists from the cities.
They would go to these towns and start 

552
00:35:39,481 --> 00:35:41,670
spreading this doctrine.
Okay,

553
00:35:41,671 --> 00:35:42,504
now you gotta think this through.
Now who is going to be most responsive 

554
00:35:48,091 --> 00:35:50,940
to that doctrine?
Well,

555
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,570
it's going to be the most jealous,
useless,

556
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:56,970
jealous,
and resentful people in town.

557
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,240
It's going to be the guys that are 
hanging around in the local bar,

558
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,610
drinking themselves,
have to death every day,

559
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:05,760
who feel that they've been totally 
screwed over by life,

560
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,680
that are,
that hate.

561
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,190
The people who have come up with a 
modicum of prosperity.

562
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,740
And then someone comes along and says,
Hey,

563
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,790
as far as our doctrine goes,
those people you hate,

564
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:18,653
there nothing better than thieves.
It's your moral and patriotic duty to 

565
00:36:22,651 --> 00:36:26,550
rise up and take everything they have.
And that's exactly what happened.

566
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:32,330
So during the D Kula causation process,
they're basically be mobs of jealous and

567
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:33,624
resentful thugs who would go into the 
houses of these moderately prosperous 

568
00:36:38,671 --> 00:36:39,504
people who were actually the only people
in the Soviet Union who knew how to 

569
00:36:43,111 --> 00:36:45,210
farm.
And they took everything,

570
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:46,583
everything.
They go into their houses and strip 

571
00:36:48,511 --> 00:36:50,100
them.
Baron take all the animals.

572
00:36:50,101 --> 00:36:50,934
And,
and then what the Communists did with 

573
00:36:53,701 --> 00:36:56,400
the Kulaks was they allowed them to 
take,

574
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,263
they going to resettle them up mostly in
Siberia while there was no settlements 

575
00:37:00,391 --> 00:37:02,490
in Siberia.
So basically what they meant,

576
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:06,810
what that meant was hastily built rail 
lines would take them in,

577
00:37:06,811 --> 00:37:07,644
in the middle of the winter with their 
families and dump them on the frozen 

578
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:15,510
prairie where well,
all the children would die and everybody

579
00:37:15,511 --> 00:37:17,190
more or less would freeze to death.

580
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,620
And so,
you know,

581
00:37:19,621 --> 00:37:20,730
the Communists said,
well,

582
00:37:20,731 --> 00:37:23,370
you could take two months worth of food 
with you,

583
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,330
but of course they didn't make any 
provisions for having that two months of

584
00:37:27,331 --> 00:37:28,164
food.
And after you had gone through the 

585
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:31,080
process of Dq,
like ization,

586
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:34,830
you can bloody well be sure that you 
didn't have two months of food left that

587
00:37:34,831 --> 00:37:35,664
you could take when you were suddenly 
bundled onto the trains and driven to 

588
00:37:39,151 --> 00:37:41,280
the middle of nowhere.
Well,

589
00:37:41,281 --> 00:37:44,250
you know,
after a number of years of that which,

590
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,113
which also involved the forced 
collectivization of all the remaining 

591
00:37:48,811 --> 00:37:49,644
people,
the distribution of the land in 

592
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:51,624
principle to everyone and then 
collective farming while the entire 

593
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:55,524
agricultural economy fell apart.
And that was particularly the case in 

594
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:00,270
the Ukraine,
which is a very,

595
00:38:00,271 --> 00:38:01,104
very fertile part of the world.
And which was the breadbasket of of 

596
00:38:03,931 --> 00:38:05,460
Russia,
roughly speaking,

597
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:06,803
while everybody starved,
the Communists had to put up posters 

598
00:38:09,901 --> 00:38:12,870
telling people that eating their 
children was wrong.

599
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,280
They would kill people if they went out 
in the fields after the harvest.

600
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:19,740
So they go out with their big harvesting
machines,

601
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,880
vacuum up all the grain,
ship it to the cities because the cities

602
00:38:23,881 --> 00:38:27,360
were also starving and leave nothing for
the people behind.

603
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,220
And then if you went out there in the 
field,

604
00:38:29,221 --> 00:38:30,054
like if you are a mother and your child 
was starving to death and you went out 

605
00:38:32,341 --> 00:38:33,174
there in the field and you picked up 
individual kernels of grain so that you 

606
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,180
gathered them in a cop and bring them 
home to feed their,

607
00:38:40,181 --> 00:38:44,710
affect your family,
that was an executable crime because you

608
00:38:44,711 --> 00:38:47,610
were supposed,
you're stealing from the state if you're

609
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,463
going to go out there and bloody well 
pickup the wretched little kernels that 

610
00:38:51,011 --> 00:38:51,850
are left,
you know,

611
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:56,590
half crushed into the ground that it was
your moral obligation to turn those over

612
00:38:56,591 --> 00:38:57,424
to the state because I suppose that was 
part of your ability and the needs 

613
00:39:00,931 --> 00:39:02,410
somewhere else was greater.

614
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,083
Well,
Solzhenitsyn was very interested in how 

615
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,480
the hell this sort of thing could even 
happen.

616
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:11,943
You don't want because,
and he wasn't interested in precisely 

617
00:39:14,411 --> 00:39:15,244
from a political perspective.
I mean I would say he started being 

618
00:39:17,591 --> 00:39:19,690
interested in it from a political 
perspective,

619
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:23,390
analyzing the actions of people like 
Lenin and Stalin.

620
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,360
He wrote a very interesting book on 
Lennon,

621
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:30,660
which was one of the first documents 
that made lennon out to be the same sort

622
00:39:30,851 --> 00:39:31,684
of person that Stalin was,
even though I think now the historical 

623
00:39:34,301 --> 00:39:35,134
evidence for that is crystal clear,
but it solves your nets and ended up 

624
00:39:38,351 --> 00:39:43,351
more by doing a psychological analysis.
And that's because as he considered what

625
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:45,634
had happened to his country,
he couldn't escape the proposition that 

626
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:53,740
the reason it had become so corrupt was 
because all of the individuals within it

627
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,200
had allowed themselves to become 
corrupt.

628
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,220
And so one,
if you're wondering,

629
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,083
for example,
how you know your political system has 

630
00:40:03,191 --> 00:40:04,780
become corrupt or,
or let's,

631
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:05,643
let's put it differently,
how you know that any system that you 

632
00:40:07,811 --> 00:40:10,240
happen to be embedded in has become 
corrupt.

633
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,463
One way of assessing that,
judging that is to determine for 

634
00:40:16,001 --> 00:40:19,120
yourself whether or not you're allowed 
to say what you think.

635
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,153
You know what I mean?
You can genuinely think something 

636
00:40:24,161 --> 00:40:26,410
without it being right,
obviously.

637
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:27,483
But if you genuinely think something 
that's your truth and you know in the 

638
00:40:31,151 --> 00:40:31,984
marketplace of free ideas,
everyone is allowed to express their 

639
00:40:34,901 --> 00:40:37,000
truth,
that that doesn't mean everyone's right.

640
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:40,570
It doesn't mean that you have any right 
to have people listen to you.

641
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,300
It doesn't grant you any access to 
power,

642
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:46,030
but at least you get to say what you 
think.

643
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:49,180
And if that's withheld from your,
you're punished for it.

644
00:40:49,181 --> 00:40:50,014
You can bloody well be certain that the 
system has started to take a vicious 

645
00:40:53,591 --> 00:40:54,424
turn towards oppression and repression 
and that the outcome of that's going to 

646
00:40:58,001 --> 00:41:01,480
be bad.
Even if your thoughts are reprehensible,

647
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:04,180
you should be allowed to put them 
forward.

648
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,013
Not least because the rest of the 
society needs to know where the 

649
00:41:07,721 --> 00:41:12,580
dangerous wing nuts are so that you can 
so that the ideas can be brought up,

650
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,310
you know,
out in the open and disqualified,

651
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,173
you know,
so freedom of speech encompasses the 

652
00:41:18,071 --> 00:41:20,200
freedom to say the most outrageous 
things.

653
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:22,900
Just so everybody knows what you're 
thinking.

654
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,213
Because if you can't say it,
that doesn't mean you're not thinking 

655
00:41:26,261 --> 00:41:27,094
it.
It's just going to go underground and 

656
00:41:28,241 --> 00:41:31,660
fester there like a Freudian repressed 
thought.

657
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,243
So freedom speech has nothing to do with
protecting the kind of speech that is 

658
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,460
necessarily pro social.
It's exactly the opposite of that is you

659
00:41:40,461 --> 00:41:43,310
want everybody to say what they're 
thinking because the end,

660
00:41:43,311 --> 00:41:46,910
you know what they're thinking and it's 
and well,

661
00:41:46,911 --> 00:41:47,744
and it's also often the case that people
can't come to the truth unless they're 

662
00:41:50,751 --> 00:41:54,530
allowed to express their untruth and 
have that,

663
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:57,890
you know,
criticized in the in public forums.

664
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:03,850
So Solzhenitsyn's conclusion was that 
there was no way that the terrors of the

665
00:42:05,691 --> 00:42:06,524
Soviet state could have got the foothold
that they got unless individual people 

666
00:42:10,581 --> 00:42:14,600
were willing to falsify that nature of 
their own experience.

667
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:17,660
And in the Gulag archipelago,
he basically,

668
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,730
he basically describes the society.
It's 2,700 pages long,

669
00:42:22,731 --> 00:42:25,520
this book and it's little tiny type.
It's a very,

670
00:42:25,521 --> 00:42:30,521
very comprehensive examination.
He basically shows you story after story

671
00:42:32,391 --> 00:42:36,680
tells you story after story of how 
people falsified their experience in the

672
00:42:36,681 --> 00:42:37,514
service of the state.
And so the story is basically something 

673
00:42:40,941 --> 00:42:43,130
like this.
He said,

674
00:42:43,131 --> 00:42:47,420
this is what happens when you give your 
God given sole over to human dogma.

675
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,600
So the basic idea is,
well,

676
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:51,434
you're left and an you left in the 
sphere that it is is has the absence of 

677
00:42:56,721 --> 00:42:57,554
a well defined meaning.
So that's a consequence of the collapse 

678
00:43:00,051 --> 00:43:01,610
of the previous belief systems.

679
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:06,530
And because you're torn apart by that in
some sense,

680
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,873
you don't know where to turn.
And one direction is of course 

681
00:43:09,741 --> 00:43:10,574
nihilistic.
And the other direction perhaps is 

682
00:43:12,231 --> 00:43:13,220
totalitarian.
Now,

683
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,353
another direction might be that you try 
to figure things out on your own and 

684
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:21,440
still live a life that's truthful and,
and,

685
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:22,483
and that has integrity.
But we're going to leave that alone for 

686
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:25,184
a moment because it's,
it's difficult to even conceptualize 

687
00:43:27,651 --> 00:43:28,484
that might exist if you've already 
swallowed the presupposition that all 

688
00:43:31,551 --> 00:43:35,300
the values have fallen apart.
You turn to totalitarianism.

689
00:43:35,301 --> 00:43:36,134
Okay,
well it tells you what to think and it 

690
00:43:37,611 --> 00:43:38,444
tells you how to act.
It tells you how your society should be 

691
00:43:40,311 --> 00:43:41,144
structured,
but it does some things that are even 

692
00:43:43,641 --> 00:43:44,474
more subtle and subtly destructive than 
that because what it also does is 

693
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,084
positive future utopia,
which is an organization of the state 

694
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:57,740
where everyone has everything they want 
permanently.

695
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:01,190
Now Dostoyevsky when he wrote notes from
underground,

696
00:44:01,191 --> 00:44:02,420
he basically said,
well,

697
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:04,700
this was way before the communist 
revolution.

698
00:44:04,701 --> 00:44:08,300
He said he was talking about these sorts
of Utopian,

699
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:12,710
uh,
egalitarian communitarians.

700
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:15,560
He said they've got human beings 
completely wrong,

701
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:17,480
right,
right from the bottom up.

702
00:44:17,481 --> 00:44:20,410
Because if you took the typical person,
he says,

703
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,720
if you gave them everything they 
possibly want to,

704
00:44:22,721 --> 00:44:23,554
to eat so that all they had to ever do 
is eat delicious cakes and they didn't 

705
00:44:26,451 --> 00:44:29,840
have any other responsibilities than 
what did he say,

706
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,033
uh,
indulging in the continuation of the 

707
00:44:33,121 --> 00:44:33,954
human species.
And so that if they were so happy that 

708
00:44:36,571 --> 00:44:39,600
if you put them under water,
nothing but bubbles of bliss would float

709
00:44:39,601 --> 00:44:40,434
up to the surface.
The first thing that people who were 

710
00:44:42,451 --> 00:44:47,430
putting in that situation would do would
be to wander around smashing things just

711
00:44:47,431 --> 00:44:50,190
so that something unexpected and 
interesting would happen.

712
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:51,743
You know,
it's a brilliant critique of utopianism 

713
00:44:53,611 --> 00:44:54,444
because it's exactly right.
He said he basically Dostoyevsky said 

714
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,373
people are so crazy that they'd rather 
be subjected to inconvenient and 

715
00:45:05,341 --> 00:45:10,341
unexpected occurrences than just to lay 
there all soporific with bliss.

716
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:11,543
And so that there was something wrong 
with the whole utopia notion right from 

717
00:45:14,761 --> 00:45:17,370
the get go because that's just not what 
people are like.

718
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:22,140
They'd rather have interesting trouble 
than non interesting perfection,

719
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,633
you know?
And I think that's an incredibly 

720
00:45:24,361 --> 00:45:26,370
powerful idea.
But anyways,

721
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:30,330
you can just think about that in 
relationship to your own character.

722
00:45:30,331 --> 00:45:31,164
I mean,
how often do you do something that's 

723
00:45:32,251 --> 00:45:34,380
troubled just to see what happens?
I mean,

724
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,260
it's exactly what people are like.
You know,

725
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,830
even chimpanzees,
juvenile champs,

726
00:45:40,831 --> 00:45:43,830
if they see an old male sleeping 
underneath the tree,

727
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:47,100
they'll go and poke them with a stick 
just to see what happens,

728
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:47,850
you know?

729
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:48,720
And it's like,
well,

730
00:45:48,721 --> 00:45:51,570
if you can't see human humanity and that
sort of behavior,

731
00:45:51,571 --> 00:45:53,880
there's something wrong with you.
So,

732
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,790
but the utopians offered this vision of 
the future,

733
00:45:56,791 --> 00:45:57,624
which was basically paradise on earth,
but they also proposed that it was 

734
00:46:00,451 --> 00:46:03,360
something that could be attained through
certain types of,

735
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,370
you know,
direct political action,

736
00:46:05,371 --> 00:46:08,940
which usually meant,
well fix your neighbor up or even worse,

737
00:46:08,941 --> 00:46:11,850
man steal what he has because he 
shouldn't have it anyways.

738
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:12,983
And the problem with the Utopian Vision 
essentially was that if my theory is 

739
00:46:17,131 --> 00:46:19,860
associated with a future utopian,
a logical way,

740
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:20,694
so I can make a case to you that if you 
do this and we do that and they do this 

741
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:25,284
and we organizing things this way,
then we'll our shear in a period of 

742
00:46:28,561 --> 00:46:33,060
prosperity that's almost heavenly in its
in its promise.

743
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,670
The problem with that is it means we can
do any bloody thing,

744
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,533
bloody thing we want right now because 
the end product is so valuable that it 

745
00:46:39,721 --> 00:46:40,554
justifies it.

746
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:41,783
And so what happens is that the Utopian 
vision turns into a rationale for the 

747
00:46:45,361 --> 00:46:49,770
most destructive forms of behavior in 
the here and now.

748
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:52,020
And then when someone's called to task 
for,

749
00:46:52,021 --> 00:46:53,880
it's like,
what the hell do you think you're doing?

750
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:55,650
You know,
they'll say something like,

751
00:46:55,651 --> 00:46:56,484
well,
you can't make an omelet without 

752
00:46:57,451 --> 00:46:59,670
breaking eggs,
you know,

753
00:46:59,671 --> 00:47:02,460
and that's all well and good if you 
happen to be making the Omelet,

754
00:47:02,461 --> 00:47:05,550
but it's not so damn good if you happen 
to be one of the eggs.

755
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:08,760
And there were plenty of eggs broken on 
the way to,

756
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:12,390
you know,
the Soviet vision of success while,

757
00:47:12,391 --> 00:47:14,790
and you know there's good evidence 
stolen.

758
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:15,624
By the time the mid 1950s came around,
there's pretty decent evidence from the 

759
00:47:20,911 --> 00:47:21,744
KGB archives that he was preparing to 
launch a thermonuclear war against 

760
00:47:25,441 --> 00:47:26,131
Europe.
I mean,

761
00:47:26,131 --> 00:47:30,010
he'd already killed God only knows how 
many million by that point,

762
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:33,520
a few more hundred million.
We're really going to weigh that heavily

763
00:47:33,521 --> 00:47:36,880
on his conscience.
The last book I read on stolen,

764
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,180
which was published,
which was called stolen.

765
00:47:40,181 --> 00:47:45,181
It was written by a guy who had access 
to the KGB and Communist Party archives.

766
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:46,803
He claimed that Khrushchev and three 
other people killed Stellan in the late 

767
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:54,310
1950s to stop him from invading Europe.
So I mean,

768
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:55,923
you know,
in the battle between the communist 

769
00:47:59,551 --> 00:48:00,384
utopians and the West,
we came this close to wiping everything 

770
00:48:02,951 --> 00:48:04,570
out several times.

771
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:06,223
So

772
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:11,650
now what happened in some sense was 
this,

773
00:48:11,651 --> 00:48:15,040
is that this theory was laid out to 
cover the world.

774
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:15,874
So the Marxist theory was presented 
itself as a scientific theory and 

775
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:20,343
inevitable theory of history.
And the theory of history was that the 

776
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:29,440
warfare between the oppressed and the 
oppressor was the primary fact of life.

777
00:48:29,441 --> 00:48:34,441
And that that needed to transform itself
into a egalitarian utopia.

778
00:48:35,081 --> 00:48:39,550
And that there were certain states that 
political states that mankind would have

779
00:48:39,551 --> 00:48:42,070
to go through to reach that end.
Okay.

780
00:48:42,071 --> 00:48:46,390
So that was basically the theory.
And part of the theory was that in order

781
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:47,224
to get to that point,
then resources had to be distributed 

782
00:48:49,661 --> 00:48:52,540
equally to all,
which sounds fine in principle.

783
00:48:52,541 --> 00:48:53,374
But then again,
the devil's always in the details and 

784
00:48:55,930 --> 00:49:00,930
how to distribute resources equally is 
by no means self evident.

785
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,490
You know,
part of the reason that the English came

786
00:49:03,491 --> 00:49:07,120
up with the idea of the free market,
this is Adam Smith fundamentally,

787
00:49:07,121 --> 00:49:07,954
is because Smith figured out that trying
to figure out what things were worth is 

788
00:49:13,331 --> 00:49:16,810
so complicated that you can't actually 
calculate it.

789
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,940
So then we would say,
well,

790
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:21,400
what's your coat worth?
I'd say,

791
00:49:21,401 --> 00:49:24,400
well,
would you give me your code for $5

792
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:31,510
$2
thousand dollars okay,

793
00:49:31,850 --> 00:49:32,481
so,
so,

794
00:49:32,481 --> 00:49:35,030
but to say the point being is that,
you know,

795
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:39,740
there's no way of establishing the worth
of things because the worth of one thing

796
00:49:39,741 --> 00:49:44,120
is it's worth in relationship to all 
other things of worth.

797
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:48,080
Like it's a continual interaction 
between all things of worth.

798
00:49:48,081 --> 00:49:52,490
And the only way you can make that 
calculation is by letting people,

799
00:49:52,491 --> 00:49:53,324
individual people make micro choices and
that the value of things is established 

800
00:49:58,101 --> 00:50:00,980
as a consequence of a hundred billion 
micro choices.

801
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,113
We'd call that in the modern world would
call something that something that's 

802
00:50:04,491 --> 00:50:07,730
something like distributed cognition.
You know,

803
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:11,120
it's like you're outsourcing a price 
decision to the marketplace.

804
00:50:11,121 --> 00:50:11,954
What's this thing worth?
Well the answer is whatever people will 

805
00:50:15,051 --> 00:50:18,460
trade for it and it's not a copout.
It's,

806
00:50:18,461 --> 00:50:19,294
it's an illustration indication of the 
fact that you can't come up with a 

807
00:50:22,761 --> 00:50:26,270
computation that will allow you to 
determine what something is worth.

808
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:27,853
So I mean,
I can give you an example of that from 

809
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:33,680
my own life trying to figure out what 
something is worth.

810
00:50:33,681 --> 00:50:34,514
I developed some software to help people
hire employees and we did the 

811
00:50:40,131 --> 00:50:40,964
mathematical calculations and figured 
out that if people use this particular 

812
00:50:44,091 --> 00:50:48,560
software instead of going through a 
interview process,

813
00:50:48,561 --> 00:50:51,680
which doesn't work very well,
that it would basically,

814
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:52,843
if they used,
if they gave it to 10 people to select 

815
00:50:55,731 --> 00:51:00,731
one employee,
that it would save them about 35% of the

816
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:01,843
salary of the hired person per year.
So if you hired someone who was being 

817
00:51:06,621 --> 00:51:11,621
paid $100,000 then the return on 
investment would be $35,000 a year.

818
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:15,650
And we could sell this for say,
well,

819
00:51:15,651 --> 00:51:16,484
we didn't know what,
how much do you charge for the tests 

820
00:51:18,291 --> 00:51:19,190
then?
So you might say,

821
00:51:19,191 --> 00:51:21,260
well,
if it's $35,000 a year,

822
00:51:21,530 --> 00:51:23,630
you're going to have this person around 
for four years,

823
00:51:23,631 --> 00:51:26,210
because that's how long the average 
person stays in their job.

824
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:31,450
That's $150,000 and so then you only 
have to use 10 tests.

825
00:51:32,241 --> 00:51:35,150
And so maybe we could take a half of the
first year,

826
00:51:35,151 --> 00:51:39,110
so that'd be $17,000 so it'd be $1,750 a
test.

827
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:40,303
And you'd get like a 30 what is it?
You get an eight times return on your 

828
00:51:43,941 --> 00:51:47,000
investment.
Well you should be just jumping at that.

829
00:51:47,001 --> 00:51:48,620
Well,
it doesn't work like that at all.

830
00:51:48,621 --> 00:51:49,454
We ended up having to sell it for about 
$20 a test and we could hardly sell it 

831
00:51:52,131 --> 00:51:52,964
to anyone because well,
for reasons that are far too complex to 

832
00:51:56,151 --> 00:51:56,984
go into.
But my point is is that it's impossible 

833
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:04,310
to make a pricing decision.
It's really,

834
00:52:04,311 --> 00:52:05,144
really difficult.
And to think that you could make a 

835
00:52:07,251 --> 00:52:08,084
conscious and preprogrammed pricing 
decision for every single commodity is 

836
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:14,714
completely insane.
And that's what they tried to do in the 

837
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:19,400
Soviet Union.
And I read at one point that the central

838
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:24,020
price pricing committee had to make 
10,000 pricing decisions a day.

839
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,990
Well you can't even come up with the 
price of one.

840
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,940
You've put things on Kijiji,
you know,

841
00:52:28,941 --> 00:52:29,541
it's like,
well,

842
00:52:29,541 --> 00:52:30,374
what's it worth?
Well you look at what everyone else is 

843
00:52:32,091 --> 00:52:33,860
paying for it,
roughly speaking,

844
00:52:33,861 --> 00:52:34,694
and then it depends on how quickly you 
want to sell it and what kind of shape 

845
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:37,904
it's in.
And you know it's complicated and you 

846
00:52:39,681 --> 00:52:42,860
have a pricing guideline,
you just have to look the damn thing up.

847
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:45,050
It's still hard to figure out what the 
price is.

848
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:48,050
But imagine you have no comparative 
information at all.

849
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:51,620
What's a hypodermic needle worth?
Well,

850
00:52:51,621 --> 00:52:54,820
I guess it depends on whether you need 
it to inject the penicillin that's going

851
00:52:54,821 --> 00:52:57,860
to save your life or if you're just 
putting it in your cupboard to store it,

852
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,160
but it's a complicated decision.
All right,

853
00:53:01,161 --> 00:53:05,060
so anyways,
this Utopian scheme was set up and we're

854
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:05,953
acting on the proposition that people 
used it at least in part as a 

855
00:53:09,081 --> 00:53:12,230
replacement for their alternative for 
their old belief systems,

856
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:14,960
which I think is a perfectly reasonable 
proposition,

857
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,153
but we're also going to take a 
psychoanalytic approach and we're going 

858
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:19,154
to say,
well,

859
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:20,053
it also allowed people to manifest bad 
faith because if you're worth can be 

860
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:30,030
determined by how good a car you are in 
the fascist or communist machinery,

861
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,660
it pretty much alleviates you have any 
responsibility that you have to have for

862
00:53:33,661 --> 00:53:34,590
your own life.

863
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:38,580
So that for,
for every positive reason that you might

864
00:53:38,581 --> 00:53:39,414
join a utopian movement,
there's a negative reason which as well 

865
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:43,163
you can benefit from.
It's exploitive nature and you don't 

866
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:45,924
have to take any responsibility.
While Solzhenitsyn and Frankl both 

867
00:53:49,981 --> 00:53:52,290
talked about that a lot,
as did Nisha,

868
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:53,124
but Franklin soldier knits and are more 
interesting because they actually 

869
00:53:55,801 --> 00:53:56,634
happened to live through the imposition 
of systems like that and could see them 

870
00:54:00,181 --> 00:54:01,014
from the inside.
Solzhenitsyn's first observation was 

871
00:54:04,201 --> 00:54:05,034
Marxist economics didn't work well.
That was a big problem because it was 

872
00:54:10,141 --> 00:54:12,510
supposed to work and not only was it 
supposed to work,

873
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:13,553
it was supposed to work perfectly.
And what that basically meant was that 

874
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:20,610
if it didn't work,
you only had one of two options.

875
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:21,653
You could either abandon the dam system 
and start to complain about the fact 

876
00:54:24,421 --> 00:54:26,760
that you had to line up for bread for 
four hours a day,

877
00:54:26,761 --> 00:54:31,200
which was perfectly typical daily 
activity for people.

878
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,033
For example,
in Poland and in Russia before the wall 

879
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:34,854
came down,
everything costs nothing but there 

880
00:54:36,451 --> 00:54:39,780
wasn't anything to buy.
So it wasn't very much of a bargain.

881
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,120
And instead of paying for your bread 
with money,

882
00:54:42,121 --> 00:54:43,710
you just paid for it.
With time.

883
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:47,340
You stayed in line for two hours or 
three hours or five hours.

884
00:54:47,341 --> 00:54:50,280
And when you got to the front of the 
line at the department store,

885
00:54:50,281 --> 00:54:53,490
you took whatever the hell was there 
because you didn't even know what it was

886
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:55,770
that you were going to be buying when 
you joined the lineup.

887
00:54:56,250 --> 00:55:00,420
And so it wasn't like it was free.
He had just paid for it with your time.

888
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,633
So soldier knits and noted that what 
happened as the system continued to 

889
00:55:06,421 --> 00:55:07,254
manifest it's counterproductive 
properties was that either people had 

890
00:55:10,291 --> 00:55:12,000
the choice of saying,
oh,

891
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:12,953
this isn't working worth a damn.
There must be something rotten in 

892
00:55:15,781 --> 00:55:20,520
Denmark or pretending that everything 
was all right in lying about everything.

893
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:24,150
And that's what they did.
They lied about everything.

894
00:55:24,151 --> 00:55:27,270
And so we've got to,
you've got the situation up to the point

895
00:55:27,271 --> 00:55:30,030
where in East Germany,
before the wall came down,

896
00:55:30,031 --> 00:55:34,170
one out of every three people was a 
government informer stop man.

897
00:55:34,171 --> 00:55:35,004
If you had a family of six people,
two of them were telling the government 

898
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:41,460
what you were talking about at dinner 
and that was their duty.

899
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:42,683
And so what that meant in these 
societies was no one ever said anything 

900
00:55:45,331 --> 00:55:48,960
that they meant ever.
And if they did the probability that the

901
00:55:48,961 --> 00:55:53,730
KGB was going to kick down the door at 
four in the morning and take them off to

902
00:55:53,731 --> 00:55:57,270
the central prison before dumping them 
in some damn camp where they'd never see

903
00:55:57,271 --> 00:56:00,630
anybody they ever knew for the rest of 
their life was extraordinarily high.

904
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:05,490
So you watched everything you said and 
everything you thought around your wife,

905
00:56:05,491 --> 00:56:07,500
around your brother,
around your sister,

906
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:08,513
around your children,
and the whole system ground onward in a 

907
00:56:12,961 --> 00:56:17,961
mire of absolute deception and lie and 
soldier knits his point as well.

908
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:22,290
And this is one of Frankel's main 
points,

909
00:56:22,291 --> 00:56:27,291
is that if people had had,
if people had decided to stop lying,

910
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:31,840
the system would have ground to a halt.
But that isn't what people did.

911
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:35,710
They just kept lying.
Now he noticed when he was in the prison

912
00:56:35,711 --> 00:56:37,720
camps,
because he was in them for a long time.

913
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:41,500
He did encounter people inside the camps
like Frankl did,

914
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:45,370
who were absolutely unwilling to falsify
their experience.

915
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:46,503
So for example,
one of the things that had to happen if 

916
00:56:48,131 --> 00:56:48,964
you were arrested by the kgb and 
sentenced to a prison camp was that it 

917
00:56:52,061 --> 00:56:54,730
was necessary for you to sign a 
confession.

918
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:56,890
And that's so peculiar.
You think,

919
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:57,943
ah,
they're going to arrest the arbitrarily 

920
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:03,610
and put you on trial for trumped up 
nonsense.

921
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,670
Why couldn't they just forge your 
signature?

922
00:57:06,671 --> 00:57:08,680
It's like,
why did they care if you confessed?

923
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:10,630
And the answer to that was,
well,

924
00:57:11,050 --> 00:57:11,883
it was part of the way the system kept 
itself validated because the people who 

925
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:15,514
were torturing you could justify the 
torture if you agreed that you are 

926
00:57:18,491 --> 00:57:19,720
actually at fault.

927
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:23,770
And so rather than face the fact that 
they were just doing something corrupt,

928
00:57:23,771 --> 00:57:24,604
innocent people,
they'd extract a confession out of use 

929
00:57:26,821 --> 00:57:30,790
so that they could convince themselves 
that you deserved exactly what you got.

930
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:35,860
A soldier in Edson said at one time that
one person who stopped lying could bring

931
00:57:35,861 --> 00:57:36,910
down a tyranny.
Now,

932
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:39,310
that's a pretty radical statement,
but you know,

933
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:40,383
when he wrote the Gulag archipelago,
I mean he memorized that damn book when 

934
00:57:44,141 --> 00:57:44,974
he was in one of the prison camps 
because they didn't give him pencil or 

935
00:57:47,981 --> 00:57:49,600
paper.
And even if they did,

936
00:57:49,601 --> 00:57:52,120
they wouldn't have been able to carry 
the damn manuscript around.

937
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,960
So he basically memorized at 2,700 
pages,

938
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:57,123
you know,
written at the volume of a very loud 

939
00:57:59,231 --> 00:58:01,930
scream.
And when he got out of the prison camps,

940
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:06,940
he had two copies of it typed up,
one by one typist in one by another.

941
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:10,300
They didn't know each other.
The KGB broke into the one type is Soman

942
00:58:10,301 --> 00:58:12,370
stole the manuscript and she killed 
herself.

943
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:13,960
Then the,
well,

944
00:58:13,961 --> 00:58:15,440
and you can understand why,
you know,

945
00:58:15,441 --> 00:58:16,274
when she thought this was a tremendously
valuable piece of work and she thought 

946
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:21,700
it was the only copy and they destroyed 
it.

947
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,310
Well,
he couldn't even tell her that there was

948
00:58:24,311 --> 00:58:26,590
another one because they would have got 
it too.

949
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,113
Well.
And then it was exported to the West in 

950
00:58:30,041 --> 00:58:33,010
unpublished forum and published in 
English to begin with.

951
00:58:33,011 --> 00:58:38,011
And it was an absolute bomb shell like,
and it was published in 1974 was at that

952
00:58:39,671 --> 00:58:40,504
point,
anyone who had any moral integrity 

953
00:58:41,891 --> 00:58:44,080
whatsoever had,
who was also literate,

954
00:58:44,081 --> 00:58:45,250
read that and said,
Oh,

955
00:58:45,251 --> 00:58:48,400
okay,
game over all those propositions.

956
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,473
They're wrong beyond belief.
And that part of what we thought might 

957
00:58:53,891 --> 00:58:56,650
be possible is done.
Well,

958
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,480
you know,
that happened to some degree.

959
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:02,260
It communism lost a tremendous amount of
its intellectual credibility.

960
00:59:02,261 --> 00:59:06,070
And that was part of the reason that it 
fell over in 1989 but you know,

961
00:59:06,071 --> 00:59:07,810
it's not like everybody has shaken 
there.

962
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:08,933
No,
it's not as if everyone's faith in that 

963
00:59:10,661 --> 00:59:13,210
sort of thing is being shaken.
You know,

964
00:59:13,211 --> 00:59:14,044
there's this massive stream of Marxist 
utopianism that's still running through 

965
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:19,650
postmodernism and that's,
that's,

966
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:22,160
you know,
made its way to Western universities all

967
00:59:22,161 --> 00:59:25,580
over the world.
So despite all of this,

968
00:59:25,581 --> 00:59:30,581
despite these tens of millions of deaths
and this total moral corruption,

969
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:31,843
and no one even knows about it,
and I don't understand that it's 

970
00:59:35,361 --> 00:59:39,410
completely,
it's completely unacceptable.

971
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:42,260
It's the biggest lesson of the 20th 
century,

972
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:43,873
you know,
and we hear a lot about the Holocaust 

973
00:59:44,931 --> 00:59:47,270
and no wonder it was a truly terrible 
thing.

974
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:48,493
But there's all these other events of 
the 20th century that were absolutely 

975
00:59:51,651 --> 00:59:56,540
catastrophic and they're not part of 
general knowledge.

976
00:59:56,570 --> 01:00:01,340
And you have to ask yourself why?
Because if we can't learn from that,

977
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:02,773
if we can't learn from all those tens of
millions of people who were tortured to 

978
01:00:06,261 --> 01:00:07,550
death and,
and,

979
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:10,340
and,
and ruined in political prisons,

980
01:00:10,341 --> 01:00:13,280
like you gotta ask yourself,
can we actually learn anything?

981
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:16,910
I'm going to read you some of the things
that Solzhenitsyn wrote.

982
01:00:24,490 --> 01:00:28,580
He doesn't say the name of this person.
It's in,

983
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:29,493
it's in dashes.
Someone he meant he met either in a 

984
01:00:33,611 --> 01:00:34,444
camper afterwards,
he told how executions were carried out 

985
01:00:37,691 --> 01:00:40,510
at a dock,
a camp on the [inaudible] river.

986
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:41,853
They would take the opposition members 
with their things out of the camp 

987
01:00:45,281 --> 01:00:49,930
compound on a prisoner transport at 
night and outside the compound stood the

988
01:00:49,931 --> 01:00:51,520
small house of the third section.

989
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:54,190
Okay.

990
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:58,390
These were people who were opposing the 
communist ideology.

991
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:02,410
The condemned men were taken into a room
one at a time and they're,

992
01:01:02,411 --> 01:01:05,980
the camp guard sprang on them.
Their mouths were stuffed with something

993
01:01:05,981 --> 01:01:09,040
soft and their arms are bound with cords
behind their backs.

994
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:10,533
Then they were led out into the 
courtyard where harnessed carts were 

995
01:01:12,461 --> 01:01:13,294
waiting.
The bound prisoners were piled on the 

996
01:01:15,761 --> 01:01:19,180
carts five to seven at a time and driven
off to the Gorkha,

997
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:20,253
the camp cemetery on arrival.
They were tipped into big pits that had 

998
01:01:23,801 --> 01:01:28,570
already been prepared and buried alive,
not out of brutality.

999
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:29,943
No.
It had been calculated than would 

1000
01:01:32,081 --> 01:01:32,914
dragging and lifting the mood was much 
easier and more efficient to cope with 

1001
01:01:35,501 --> 01:01:37,330
living people.
Then with corpses,

1002
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:42,190
the work went on for many nights at a 
dock and that is how the moral political

1003
01:01:42,191 --> 01:01:44,110
unity of our party was achieved.

1004
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:45,800
Okay.

1005
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:46,633
This is from Frankel.
This is the concentration camps in Nazi 

1006
01:01:49,701 --> 01:01:50,534
Germany.

1007
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:52,500
Okay.

1008
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,360
These.
Those were the size of cities,

1009
01:01:54,361 --> 01:01:55,260
by the way.
I mean,

1010
01:01:55,261 --> 01:01:56,094
when you think of camp,
I don't know what image it brings up in 

1011
01:01:58,291 --> 01:01:59,610
your mind,
but you know,

1012
01:01:59,611 --> 01:02:03,000
you might think of an enclosure the size
of a city block or something like that,

1013
01:02:03,001 --> 01:02:06,270
but that's not right.
These places where the size of cities,

1014
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,550
because there was tens of thousands of 
people in them.

1015
01:02:09,150 --> 01:02:09,983
The most ghastly moment of the 24 hours 
of camp life was the awakening when Adh 

1016
01:02:13,921 --> 01:02:16,980
is still nocturnal hour,
the three shrill blows of a whistle,

1017
01:02:16,981 --> 01:02:17,814
Taurus pitiless,
Leigh fermor exhausted and from the 

1018
01:02:19,801 --> 01:02:20,634
longings in our dreams.
We then began the tussle with our wet 

1019
01:02:23,851 --> 01:02:26,340
shoes into which we could scarcely force
our feet,

1020
01:02:26,341 --> 01:02:27,174
which were sore and swollen with edema,
and there were the usual moans and 

1021
01:02:30,841 --> 01:02:33,990
groans about petty troubles such as the 
snapping of wires,

1022
01:02:33,991 --> 01:02:35,580
which replaced shoe laces.

1023
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:37,043
One morning I heard someone who my new 
to be brave and dignified cry like a 

1024
01:02:40,441 --> 01:02:41,274
child because he finally had to go to 
the snowy marching grounds in his bare 

1025
01:02:44,611 --> 01:02:45,444
feet as his shoes were too shrunk and 
for him to wear in these ghastly 

1026
01:02:49,231 --> 01:02:51,300
moments,
I found a little bit of comfort,

1027
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,433
a small piece of bread,
which I draw out of my pocket and 

1028
01:02:54,631 --> 01:02:58,920
munched with absorbed delight.
This is soldier Knutsen.

1029
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,810
So in these camps,
people were set out to work and it would

1030
01:03:03,811 --> 01:03:06,300
depend on where they were,
what they were working on,

1031
01:03:06,301 --> 01:03:07,134
but maybe it was the digging of a canal 
or maybe they were setting up a factory 

1032
01:03:09,931 --> 01:03:10,764
or,
or they were doing something that 

1033
01:03:13,141 --> 01:03:17,280
required the generally required intense 
physical effort

1034
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:22,620
and each of these camps had a ha they,
they had a,

1035
01:03:22,621 --> 01:03:25,140
a goal right there was established from 
above.

1036
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:26,430
It's like a five year plan.

1037
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:29,520
Your camp is to produce this much in 
this period of time.

1038
01:03:29,521 --> 01:03:32,040
And then if you didn't produce that much
in that period of time,

1039
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:35,220
then the people who ran the camp,
we're going to be held accountable,

1040
01:03:35,221 --> 01:03:38,620
which generally meant that they were 
going to be put in some camp themselves.

1041
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:39,833
And so there was every reason to drive 
people to their death in order to 

1042
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:44,580
fulfill the work norms.
And when that didn't happen,

1043
01:03:44,581 --> 01:03:48,030
they just falsified the records anyways 
because what the hell was their choice?

1044
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:51,900
And Solzhenitsyn talks about how they 
got around the rules

1045
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:58,460
in called lower than 60 degrees below 
zero days were written off.

1046
01:04:00,030 --> 01:04:01,620
In other words,
on such days,

1047
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:05,310
the record showed that the workers have 
not gone out to work well.

1048
01:04:05,311 --> 01:04:09,480
So then you can tell a bit about the 
benevolence of the Soviet state.

1049
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:13,200
If it was 55 below,
well then you could go out to work,

1050
01:04:13,201 --> 01:04:15,630
but if it was 60 below,
you got to stay home.

1051
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,990
While that isn't even how it worked.
In other words,

1052
01:04:18,991 --> 01:04:19,824
on 60 below days,
the record showed that the workers had 

1053
01:04:21,721 --> 01:04:22,554
not gone to work,
but they chased them out anyways and 

1054
01:04:25,321 --> 01:04:28,830
whatever they squeezed out of them on 
those days was added to the other days.

1055
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:29,873
Thereby raising the percentages,
underserved biomedical section road off 

1056
01:04:33,961 --> 01:04:37,350
those who froze to death on such cold 
days on some other basis,

1057
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:38,453
and the ones who were left who could no 
longer walk and we're straining every 

1058
01:04:41,191 --> 01:04:44,040
sinew to crawl along and all fours on 
the way back to camp,

1059
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:45,023
the convoy simply shot so that they 
wouldn't escape before they could come 

1060
01:04:47,821 --> 01:04:51,060
back to get the
skeleton.

1061
01:04:51,061 --> 01:04:51,894
Had a group of people,
hundreds of thousands of people dig a 

1062
01:04:55,231 --> 01:05:00,000
canal in the 1930s and I unfortunately,
I can't remember the name of the canal,

1063
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:01,253
but some 300,000 people froze to death 
digging it with spades and shovels in 

1064
01:05:06,631 --> 01:05:08,190
the middle of the Russian winter.

1065
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,370
And when it was finished,
it was so shallow that none of the ships

1066
01:05:11,371 --> 01:05:13,740
that were planned to go up and down it 
could use it,

1067
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:17,010
but it got finished even though it was 
the middle of the winter.

1068
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:21,280
This is from William Blake.
Oh rose,

1069
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:22,203
thou art sick.
The invisible worm that flies in the 

1070
01:05:24,941 --> 01:05:25,774
night and the howling storm have found 
out diabet of crimson joy and his dark 

1071
01:05:30,431 --> 01:05:31,810
secret.
Love does die.

1072
01:05:31,811 --> 01:05:32,644
Life destroy.
This is another story from social nets 

1073
01:05:36,721 --> 01:05:37,554
in about a women's camp.
He's standing in another camp watching 

1074
01:05:41,591 --> 01:05:45,040
this occur because the women of course 
were put into camp separate from the man

1075
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:48,550
fire,
fire,

1076
01:05:49,090 --> 01:05:50,350
the branches,
crackle,

1077
01:05:50,351 --> 01:05:54,340
and the night wind of late autumn blows 
the flame of the bonfire back and forth.

1078
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:55,443
The compound is dark.
I'm alone at the bar and fire and I can 

1079
01:05:59,621 --> 01:06:02,110
bring it still some more carpenter 
shavings.

1080
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:06,490
The compound that I man is a privileged 
one,

1081
01:06:06,700 --> 01:06:10,090
so privileged that it is almost as if I 
were out in freedom.

1082
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:15,390
This is an island of paradise.
This is the Marfino [inaudible],

1083
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:16,773
which was a scientific institutes 
staffed with prisoners in its most 

1084
01:06:21,071 --> 01:06:24,460
privileged period.
No one is overseeing me,

1085
01:06:24,461 --> 01:06:27,730
calling me to a cell,
chasing me away from the bonfire.

1086
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,570
And even then it is chilly in the 
penetrating wind,

1087
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:36,130
but she who has already been standing in
the wind for hours,

1088
01:06:36,131 --> 01:06:38,590
her arms straight down,
her head drooping,

1089
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:41,140
weeping,
then growing numb and still,

1090
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:44,380
and then again she begs pityingly 
citizen chief,

1091
01:06:44,381 --> 01:06:46,660
please forgive me,
I won't do it again.

1092
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:51,460
The wind carries her moan to me just as 
if she were moaning next to my ear.

1093
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:57,150
The citizen chief at the gate house 
fires up his stove and does not answer.

1094
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:58,263
This was the gate house of the camp next
to us from which workers came into our 

1095
01:07:02,021 --> 01:07:02,854
compound to lay water pipes and repair 
the old ramshackle seminary building 

1096
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:08,373
across from me beyond the artfully 
intertwined many stranded barbed wire 

1097
01:07:12,701 --> 01:07:13,534
barricade and two steps away from the 
gate house beneath a bright lantern 

1098
01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:22,770
stood the punished girl head hanging the
wind tugging at her gray work skirt,

1099
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:27,640
her feet growing numb from the cold and 
the thin scarf over her head.

1100
01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:29,493
It had been warm during the day when 
they had been digging a ditch on our 

1101
01:07:31,751 --> 01:07:32,584
territory.
And another girl slipped down into a 

1102
01:07:35,981 --> 01:07:36,814
ravine,
crawled her way to the Vladi Keno 

1103
01:07:38,531 --> 01:07:39,364
highway and escaped.
The guard had bungled and Moscow city 

1104
01:07:43,361 --> 01:07:46,450
buses ran right along the highway.
When they caught on,

1105
01:07:46,451 --> 01:07:49,420
it was too late to her,
so they raised the alarm,

1106
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:54,220
a mean dark major arrived in shouted 
that if they fail to catch the girl,

1107
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:55,353
the entire camp would be deprived of 
visits and parcels for a whole month 

1108
01:07:58,600 --> 01:07:59,433
because of her escape and the women 
brigadiers went into a rage and they 

1109
01:08:03,221 --> 01:08:04,054
were all shouting.
One of them in particular who kept 

1110
01:08:05,891 --> 01:08:08,170
viciously rolling her eyes.
Oh,

1111
01:08:08,171 --> 01:08:12,340
I hope they catcher the bitch.
I hope they take scissors and clip,

1112
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,830
clip all,
take off all of her hair in front of the

1113
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:18,440
lineup.
This wasn't something she had thought up

1114
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:19,460
for herself.

1115
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:21,640
This is the way they punished women in 
the ghoulag,

1116
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:23,563
but the girl who is now standing outside
the gate house in the cold had sighed 

1117
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:27,883
and said instead,
at least she can have a good time out 

1118
01:08:30,681 --> 01:08:31,514
and freedom for all of us.
The jailer overheard what she said and 

1119
01:08:34,911 --> 01:08:37,130
now she was being punished.
Everyone else.

1120
01:08:37,131 --> 01:08:37,964
It'd be taken off to the camp,
but she had been set outside there to 

1121
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:42,710
stand at attention in front of the gate 
house.

1122
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:44,053
This had been at 6:00 PM and now it was 
11:00 PM she tried to shift from one 

1123
01:08:48,921 --> 01:08:49,754
foot to another,
but the guards stuck out his hand and 

1124
01:08:51,411 --> 01:08:53,360
shouted,
stand at attention,

1125
01:08:53,361 --> 01:08:57,620
horror or else it will be worse for you 
and now she was not moving.

1126
01:08:57,621 --> 01:08:59,780
Only weeping.
Forgive me,

1127
01:08:59,781 --> 01:09:02,690
citizen chief,
let me into the camp.

1128
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:06,620
I won't do it anymore,
but even in the camp,

1129
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:09,260
no one was about to say to her,
all right,

1130
01:09:09,261 --> 01:09:10,880
idiot,
come on in.

1131
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:12,013
The reason they were keeping her out 
there any way for so long was that the 

1132
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:19,970
next day was Sunday and she wouldn't be 
needed for work such as straw,

1133
01:09:19,971 --> 01:09:21,410
blonde,
naive,

1134
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:22,423
uneducated slip of a girl.
She'd been in prison for some spool of 

1135
01:09:25,521 --> 01:09:28,250
thread.
What a dangerous thought.

1136
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:29,113
You expressed their little sister,
they want to teach you a lesson for the 

1137
01:09:31,911 --> 01:09:35,420
rest of your life.
Fire,

1138
01:09:36,650 --> 01:09:40,220
fire.
We fought the war and we looked into the

1139
01:09:40,221 --> 01:09:43,040
bonfires to see what kind of victory it 
would be.

1140
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:47,240
The wind wafted a glowing husk from the 
bonfire.

1141
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:49,520
Okay?

1142
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:51,110
To that flame in you,
girl.

1143
01:09:51,111 --> 01:09:54,860
I promise the whole world will read 
about you.

1144
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:01,203
Okay.

1145
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:06,740
This is from Milton.
Paradise lost for Wednesday,

1146
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,940
but from the author of all ill could 
spring so deep,

1147
01:10:09,941 --> 01:10:10,774
a Melis to confound the race of mankind 
in one route and earth with hell to 

1148
01:10:15,161 --> 01:10:19,630
mingle and involve,
done all to spite the great creator.

1149
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:26,620
What are the political implications of 
existential psychology?

1150
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,040
If you lie,
you corrupt the system.

1151
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:31,803
If you ally enough,
the system becomes so corrupt that it 

1152
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:34,624
turns on you and becomes murderous.
So the price of freedom as far as the 

1153
01:10:38,771 --> 01:10:43,000
existentialists are concerned,
and this is buttressed by the historical

1154
01:10:43,001 --> 01:10:45,550
knowledge that they garner during the 
20th century,

1155
01:10:45,551 --> 01:10:50,551
was that you have a moral obligation.
You have a moral obligation to speak the

1156
01:10:53,671 --> 01:10:54,504
truth,
to maintain the integrity of the state 

1157
01:10:56,700 --> 01:11:00,720
as well as fostering your own 
psychological integration.

1158
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:04,910
We'll see you on Tuesday.
