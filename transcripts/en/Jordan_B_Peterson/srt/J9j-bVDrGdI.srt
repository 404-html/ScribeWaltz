1
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,440
I called the course personality and its 
transformations.

2
00:00:15,441 --> 00:00:16,274
And I think you could think about that 
as a restatement of the idea of being 

3
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,650
and becoming.
And that's what you are.

4
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,493
You're for whatever that means.
You're an entity that both is and is 

5
00:00:25,941 --> 00:00:26,774
transforming.
And there's a rule that goes along with 

6
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:30,410
that,
by the way,

7
00:00:30,411 --> 00:00:35,300
which has don't sacrifice who you could 
be for who you are,

8
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:36,643
which means if you have to choose to 
transform in a positive direction or 

9
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:39,974
maintain your current position,
then it's better to transform in a 

10
00:00:43,341 --> 00:00:44,174
positive direction.
So you might even think of that as the 

11
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:47,470
core of your being.
And that's a Ph,

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,250
Eddie and idea.
It's a union idea as well.

13
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,040
Who are you?
You're the thing that transforms who you

14
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:54,380
are now.
You're also who you are.

15
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,320
But on top of that,
you're the thing that transforms who you

16
00:00:57,321 --> 00:00:58,010
are.

17
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,390
And I,
I do think that that's,

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,730
and that's not an arbitrary statement,
you know,

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:02,933
um,
one of the things that modern 

20
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:05,264
universities do dreadfully now is 
convinced their students that value 

21
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:15,290
structures are relative and that,
and that's a,

22
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,520
that's a big mistake.
It's,

23
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,653
there's a lot of things wrong with that 
idea and one of the things that's wrong 

24
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:20,954
with that ideas,
that doesn't include what I just 

25
00:01:22,131 --> 00:01:25,220
mentioned,
which is that's a good moral rule is you

26
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:27,410
are the thing that is and you're the 
thing that becomes,

27
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,550
and you should put the thing that 
becomes at a higher place than the thing

28
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:32,384
that is.
That means you also have to allow 

29
00:01:33,321 --> 00:01:35,480
yourself to shake off those things about
you,

30
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,553
that you might be pathologically 
attached to habits and people for that 

31
00:01:40,881 --> 00:01:42,080
matter,
ways of thinking,

32
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:42,914
all of those things.
You have to allow yourself to shake 

33
00:01:44,481 --> 00:01:46,610
those off and that's more like a 
burning,

34
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,713
that's why the Phoenix is,
that's why the Phoenix is the symbol 

35
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:50,330
that it is,
right?

36
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,403
It's old and it deteriorates.
It bursts into flame and then it's 

37
00:01:53,601 --> 00:01:54,440
reborn.
It's like,

38
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:55,970
well,
do you want to be reborn?

39
00:01:55,971 --> 00:01:57,590
It's like,
that's not the question.

40
00:01:57,591 --> 00:01:58,424
The question is do you want to burst 
into flame and answer to that generally 

41
00:02:01,131 --> 00:02:03,560
is no,
but that's the wrong answer.

42
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:08,480
The right answer is you let all that 
nonsense burned away and you know,

43
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,321
and you might say,
well,

44
00:02:09,321 --> 00:02:13,100
I don't know what I should leave behind.
An answer to that is that's a lie.

45
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,560
You know,
some of the things that you should leave

46
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:17,630
behind you,
all you have to do is ask yourself,

47
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,900
you'll come up with a list instantly 
have a hundred stupid things that you're

48
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:22,910
doing that you know you could stop 
doing.

49
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,100
Some of them maybe you don't know you 
could stop doing.

50
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,030
It's like,
well fine,

51
00:02:26,031 --> 00:02:26,864
leave those alone for now.
But there's a bunch of things you 

52
00:02:28,551 --> 00:02:31,640
perfectly know well that you could stop 
doing that would improve your life.

53
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,630
And so do that to see what happens.
That's a good,

54
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,000
that's a good idea.
All right,

55
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,823
so its personality and its 
transformations because partly I wanted 

56
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:43,154
to talk to about,
talk to you about what you are as a 

57
00:02:45,771 --> 00:02:50,660
human being and also as an individual,
but also what you could become.

58
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,830
And that's actually a crucial question 
in the domains of clinical psychology in

59
00:02:54,831 --> 00:02:55,664
particular because a lot of what you're 
doing with people as a clinician is 

60
00:02:58,581 --> 00:03:00,670
trying to figure who they could become.
That's right.

61
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:01,620
You come,
you're,

62
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,490
you have a problem.
Your life isn't what it could be.

63
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,443
It's like fine,
let's see what it could be like if we 

64
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:09,400
changed it,
we'll figure out how to change it.

65
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,910
That's gotta be a negotiated dialogue,
right?

66
00:03:11,911 --> 00:03:13,450
Cause they're like,
I don't know what the hell you should do

67
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:15,520
with your life.
I can help you figure it out.

68
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,550
Maybe we can talk about it,
but you are the person who has to decide

69
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:21,220
if the things that you're aiming for,
you know,

70
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:23,530
get you out of bed in the morning.
Cause that's really the,

71
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,540
that's at least one of the crucial 
issues.

72
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:26,374
So you've got to specify the goal.
Then you got to specify that 

73
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:30,850
transformation processes and start 
practicing them.

74
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,430
And you have to understand that you're 
going to be bad at it,

75
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:35,590
but it doesn't matter because bad's 
fine.

76
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:40,591
Persistent is what you need to be.
If you persist with tiny improvements,

77
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:42,760
if you persist,
you win.

78
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,430
So,
okay,

79
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:49,990
so in a broader,
in a broader context,

80
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,300
you can think about this as a more 
fundamental ontological question.

81
00:03:53,301 --> 00:03:54,134
So one,
one question is how you should act in 

82
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:57,940
the world.
The other question is,

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,080
well,
what is the world?

84
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,543
And that's complicated problem.
This is a scientific answer to that 

85
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:05,104
question and now is that the world is a 
collection of objective phenomena and 

86
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,480
that's a very powerful perspective.

87
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,713
Um,
and we have a good method for 

88
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:17,200
determining what the world is like as a 
collection of objective phenomena.

89
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:23,360
And that's made us very technologically 
powerful and so more power to us and all

90
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:25,330
that,
but leaves a question on answered.

91
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,460
And the question is,
well,

92
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,593
the world isn't just a place of 
objective phenomena because it's not a 

93
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:35,410
panoply of inert matter.
It has living conscious creatures in it.

94
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,920
And that's a different,
they're a different order of being.

95
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,993
And the fundamental issue for conscious,
active creatures is not what is the 

96
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:45,814
world from an objective perspective,
but how it is that you should conduct 

97
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:51,130
yourself in the world.
And that's a,

98
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,093
and there's a very,
there's a kind of unbridgeable gap 

99
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:54,544
between those two domains of inquiry.
And I think the reason for that is that 

100
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:02,470
there's a,
the scientific method removes value from

101
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:04,390
it's description.
So that's actually what it does.

102
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,090
And so once you're left with value free 
descriptions,

103
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:07,924
it's very difficult to extract out a 
value proposition from them cause 

104
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:13,930
you've,
that's the scientific method removes the

105
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:14,764
value propositions.
You're supposed to be left with only 

106
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:18,100
that which is objective,
right?

107
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,860
And value propositions are in the domain
of the subjective.

108
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,023
So I think the idea that you can derive 
what you should be or do from a 

109
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:28,570
collection of facts is flawed.
A,

110
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:29,404
because the collecting the facts 
themselves gets rid of the value 

111
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:33,160
structure.
But B,

112
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,420
there's an infinite number of facts.
And so which,

113
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,120
how are you going to pick which ones 
should guide you?

114
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,700
You can't,
you can't,

115
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,553
you,
you have to do something else that the 

116
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:46,570
facts do not tell you what to do with 
the fact you need something else to help

117
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:48,130
you figure that out.
Well,

118
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,563
it's come to me over the years that 
that's what essentially that's what the 

119
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:54,400
narrative cognitive framework does.

120
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,653
It's the framework that we use to 
specify how we should act in the world 

121
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,873
and so you could divide the world into 
the world as it is and the world as 

122
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,673
perhaps it should be.
That gives you some direction and you 

123
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:08,360
need that and we know this technically 
right?

124
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,433
You need direction.
The reason for that is its direction 

125
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:15,890
that produces the primary that produces 
primary positive emotion.

126
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,540
And so if you need positive emotion to 
move through life,

127
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,540
which you do cause you can't even move 
without positive emotion.

128
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:25,310
And also positive emotion is a good 
ball,

129
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:28,220
work against terror and pain.
If you need those things,

130
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,230
then you need direction.
You need a goal,

131
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,093
you need a value structure.
So that doesn't seem particularly 

132
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,650
disputable to me.
You could still say,

133
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:38,270
well what value structure?
It's like,

134
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:38,931
okay,
fine.

135
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,580
That's a good question.
But I was,

136
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,320
you know,
I've thought a lot about that too.

137
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,720
So if we're going to adopt a value 
structure,

138
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:46,250
there's a couple of rules that go along 
with it.

139
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:47,084
And this is why the bloody 
postmodernists so wrong as far as I can 

140
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:50,054
tell is a,
it can't just be my value structure 

141
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,620
because I'm stuck with you and we're 
both stuck with all these other people.

142
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,380
And so if I'm going to lay out a value 
structure,

143
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,540
which is a way of interpreting the 
world,

144
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,374
let's say,
and there's an infinite number of 

145
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:06,440
potential ways of interpreting the 
world.

146
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:07,274
It's like the,
I find no problem except that I have to 

147
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:11,900
interpret the world in a way that I can 
use.

148
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:13,540
Well,
I'm dealing with you and the world.

149
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,440
Two of us are dealing with everyone else
and well,

150
00:07:15,441 --> 00:07:17,240
all of you are dealing with everyone 
else.

151
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,480
And so that,
that's the Piagetian game proposition.

152
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,940
If you want to be a popular kid on the 
playground,

153
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,460
you better play games that other people 
want to play.

154
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,650
That's a brilliant,
brilliant,

155
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,513
brilliant observation.
And I told you that Piaget was trying 

156
00:07:30,531 --> 00:07:31,710
to,
uh,

157
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,310
heal the rift between science and 
religion.

158
00:07:34,311 --> 00:07:35,144
And that's one of the things that he did
that he thought help do that as a 

159
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:40,040
question is well,
where the moral judgments come from.

160
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,310
Well,
they partly come emerge as a consequence

161
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:46,190
of consensus and it's a bounded domain.
If we're gonna,

162
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,070
if we're gonna occupy the same space for
any length of time,

163
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,800
and those are two critical propositions,
thus same space and a long time,

164
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,203
then we have to figure out how to play 
an iterative game that doesn't spiral 

165
00:07:59,731 --> 00:08:02,270
downward.
Hopefully that might even improve that.

166
00:08:02,271 --> 00:08:05,780
We both don't object to because 
otherwise it's not gonna work.

167
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,733
Right?
You'll walk away and play another game 

168
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:11,060
or the game will will disintegrate 
catastrophically.

169
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:15,860
So there's massive social constraint on 
what constitutes an appropriate frame of

170
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:16,640
reference.

171
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,250
So,
so much for the relativist argument.

172
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,233
And then there's another issue that's 
equally relevant and it's associated 

173
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,880
with the idea of objective reality to 
some degree.

174
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,530
But it's not exactly,
it's not,

175
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:30,710
that's not exactly correct because it's 
not exactly objective reality.

176
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,263
Let's say that you and I decided to 
occupy the same place for some 

177
00:08:34,641 --> 00:08:35,474
substantial amount of time and we 
figured out how to solve the problem of 

178
00:08:38,241 --> 00:08:39,074
being together.
But you and I still have to figure out 

179
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:42,284
how to solve the problem of being 
together in a manner that doesn't make 

180
00:08:45,051 --> 00:08:48,920
the world object too much.
And it isn't just other people,

181
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:50,570
although that's a huge part of the 
world.

182
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,583
You want them to not object.
You may not even want them to support 

183
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:54,950
you,
that would even be better.

184
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,240
But you also have to deal with the,
you know,

185
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:58,200
the,
the,

186
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:01,770
the tendency of matter to object 
because,

187
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:02,604
so your mode of being in the world,
your interpretive framework as a 

188
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:07,584
description of how you should act is 
actually the laying out of a strategy 

189
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,790
that will produce the ends that it 
predicts,

190
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,230
which are the things that you want.

191
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,760
So this is the pragmatist perspective.
This was worked out by William James and

192
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:23,730
his people back in the late 18 hundreds 
in New England.

193
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,110
The only genuine brand of American 
philosophy and what the pragmatists said

194
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:30,330
is,
how do you decide if something's true?

195
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,680
The answer is,
well,

196
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:33,810
how the hell can you,
you don't know anything.

197
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:34,921
Well,
that's true.

198
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:35,754
But that isn't helpful because there 
you're stuck with the problem of how to 

199
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:39,360
be in the world.
Well,

200
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:43,530
so what you do is you lay out a motive 
interpretation that has an end point and

201
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:46,290
then you run the mode of interpretation 
embodied,

202
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,280
right?
Cause he acted it out.

203
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,730
And if it doesn't produce the outcome,
then it's not,

204
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,110
let's say,
true.

205
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:53,993
The claims within it aren't,
they're not true by the definition of 

206
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:58,590
the game itself.
So you might say,

207
00:09:58,591 --> 00:09:59,880
well,
you're a kid on a playground.

208
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:00,990
You want to play a game.

209
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,930
One of the implicit demands is that the 
game is fun.

210
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,300
If it's not fun,
it's not worth playing.

211
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:07,830
So you play it for a while and then you 
see,

212
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:08,820
well,
was that fun?

213
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:11,040
If the answer is yes,
then you keep playing the game.

214
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:12,090
You say,
well that game is,

215
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,130
it's good enough,
it's accurate enough,

216
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:14,964
it's true enough.
And so you lay out interpretations in 

217
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:20,100
the world and they're subject to massive
constraints.

218
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,023
Other people have to go along with them 
and cooperate with you because if they 

219
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:24,660
don't,
then look the hell out.

220
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,460
Like it's a major,
serious,

221
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:29,310
nontrivial constraint.
And then the other thing is,

222
00:10:29,311 --> 00:10:33,750
will social proof isn't good enough.
It also has to work in the world outside

223
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:35,790
of the social world.
You know?

224
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,624
So if you have an illness and you have 
some hypothesis about how to construe 

225
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:40,320
it,
you might say,

226
00:10:40,321 --> 00:10:42,510
well,
is my understanding of the illness?

227
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,160
Correct?
Well,

228
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:46,830
it implies that I take these actions.
Well,

229
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:47,664
how do you know if it's correct while 
you take the actions and if the illness 

230
00:10:49,921 --> 00:10:50,754
gets worse,
then by the definitions that are 

231
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:55,020
implicit in the framework of reference 
that you're using,

232
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:59,250
you've made an error.
And so there's no relativism in that.

233
00:10:59,251 --> 00:11:00,240
You could still say,
well,

234
00:11:00,241 --> 00:11:04,230
there's a lot of potential solutions to 
any potential set of problems.

235
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:05,130
It's like,
yeah,

236
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:05,964
yeah,
there's lots of different ways to play 

237
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:09,570
chess on the,
on a single board,

238
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,703
right?
But that doesn't mean that any old 

239
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,680
solution is as good as any other 
solution.

240
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,710
It doesn't mean that at all.
So,

241
00:11:16,711 --> 00:11:17,544
okay,
so then we're looking at things two 

242
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:19,620
ways.
We're trying to figure out,

243
00:11:19,621 --> 00:11:21,870
well,
how does the world present itself?

244
00:11:21,871 --> 00:11:23,580
And then how is it that you should act 
in it?

245
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,510
And so
while there's other,

246
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,373
there's other constraints on the 
mechanisms of interpretation that you 

247
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:31,800
place in the world.

248
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,760
So we could say,
well,

249
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,433
you're constrained in your 
interpretations by the constraints that 

250
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:37,614
other people place on you.
But there's internal constraints as 

251
00:11:39,421 --> 00:11:40,254
well.
We talked about those mostly from a 

252
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:45,630
biological perspective because you could
also re regard yourself in some sense as

253
00:11:45,631 --> 00:11:49,650
a loose internal society and that sort 
of a psychoanalytic dictum,

254
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:50,370
right?
You're,

255
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,203
you're a collection of subpersonalities.
Or You could say you're a collection of 

256
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:55,690
sub routines.
I don't care how you,

257
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,350
how you formulated,
but you're a unity,

258
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,450
but you're a,
you're a universe unity.

259
00:12:01,451 --> 00:12:04,390
That brings together a plurality of 
subcomponents.

260
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,523
And part of the constraints on how it is
that you lay out your interpretation of 

261
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:12,250
the world is that you have to satisfy 
those internal subsystems,

262
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,630
right?
So you're the ego,

263
00:12:13,631 --> 00:12:17,530
but it's more like you're the captain of
a ship full of people who were rowing.

264
00:12:17,531 --> 00:12:19,030
You got to keep the people rowing.

265
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:19,930
You're,
you're not,

266
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,170
you're not tyrant,
you're not omnipotent tyrant of your own

267
00:12:23,171 --> 00:12:25,240
destiny.
You're constrained by the nature of your

268
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:27,820
own being.
And so you have to provide yourself with

269
00:12:27,821 --> 00:12:28,654
food and you have to provide yourself 
with shelter and you have to provide 

270
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:32,650
yourself with water and all of these 
things.

271
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:33,484
And those are demands that are laid on 
you by the nature of your internal 

272
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:37,870
processes.
And of course,

273
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:38,973
how they lay themselves out as demands 
and what the appropriate solutions to 

274
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:44,700
that is to those problems are,
is,

275
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,613
is debatable infinitely,
but you can see the constraints stack 

276
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:49,324
up.
You have to satisfy your internal 

277
00:12:50,621 --> 00:12:51,454
constraints.
So they have to be brought into a unity 

278
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:54,784
that seems to happen at least in part by
between the ages of two and something 

279
00:12:58,031 --> 00:13:00,340
like between the ages of birth and four 
years old,

280
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,630
maybe even two years old.

281
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,463
You bring yourself together into 
something that's sort of functioning as 

282
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:05,164
a unity.
Then you have to turn that unity into a 

283
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:07,954
unity that can function in the social 
world and with increasing breadth and 

284
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:12,244
that unity in the social world has to be
a unity that can function inside the 

285
00:13:14,891 --> 00:13:16,510
natural world.
It's something like that.

286
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,373
So it's you're stacking up these games 
into a hierarchy of increasing 

287
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:22,354
complexity.
And one of the questions that emerges 

288
00:13:24,161 --> 00:13:25,480
from that is,
well,

289
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,280
what should be at the top of the 
hierarchy?

290
00:13:27,281 --> 00:13:28,114
If it's a hierarchical structure,
it has to be a hierarchical structure 

291
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:34,450
because some things have to be worth 
doing more than others or you can't act,

292
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,583
which is another thing I really don't 
like about the postmodernist ethos 

293
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,890
because it claims that value structures 
are there to eliminate,

294
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:44,740
to exclude in Oh press and never once 
notices that.

295
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,480
Well Yeah,
fair enough.

296
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,313
But value structures are also there so 
that you know which way to walk because 

297
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,454
you can't figure out which way to walk 
without saying that that direction is 

298
00:13:53,921 --> 00:13:54,754
preferable to that direction.
She stuck with the damn things and they 

299
00:13:57,911 --> 00:14:01,210
do exclude obviously category structures
exclude.

300
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:03,280
The question is if you're going to have 
a value structure,

301
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:07,470
how is it that it should be can 
constituted when we're already described

302
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,313
some of the constraints,
like if your value structure is 

303
00:14:10,511 --> 00:14:13,540
perfectly functioning,
except that you don't get enough to eat,

304
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,150
that turns out to actually to be a fatal
problem.

305
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,590
Right.
And it might be,

306
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,480
you can run into all sorts of fatal 
problems.

307
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,880
You're too lonesome.
While it means you're,

308
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,850
let's say that your value structures too
narcissistic,

309
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,400
there's lots of reasons to be lonesome,
but that might be one of them.

310
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,530
Or you're too timid or something like 
that.

311
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:30,363
Like you're going to be informed by your
own internal biological mechanisms when 

312
00:14:34,691 --> 00:14:38,830
the value structure that you're laying 
out in the world is insufficient to keep

313
00:14:38,831 --> 00:14:39,664
itself propagating across time.
And some of that's just you and some of 

314
00:14:43,931 --> 00:14:47,050
that's other people and some of that's 
the natural world constraints Galore.

315
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:49,390
And so in the phase of all those 
constraints,

316
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,660
it's absolutely unreasonable to say any 
old solution goes.

317
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:55,790
It's try it,
generate a random solution,

318
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:56,624
run it as a simulation in the world and 
see and see how many slings and arrows 

319
00:15:00,261 --> 00:15:01,940
come your way.
There'll be plenty.

320
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,020
And you might say,
well,

321
00:15:03,021 --> 00:15:05,030
I don't care about slings and arrows.
It's like,

322
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,460
yeah,
no,

323
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,390
that's a claim you don't get to make.
So,

324
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:12,830
okay,
so you know,

325
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:13,664
you're,
you're being informed internally as to 

326
00:15:15,111 --> 00:15:18,320
the nature of your value structure.
You have to specify where you are.

327
00:15:18,321 --> 00:15:19,820
You have to specify where you're going.

328
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,653
You have to integrate all your 
underlying biological mechanisms into 

329
00:15:24,051 --> 00:15:25,460
that,
into that Schema.

330
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,000
It's something I think that's actually 
kind of weak about the piaget and ideas.

331
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:30,140
Hey,
because piaget,

332
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,120
I,
I'm a great fan of Piaget,

333
00:15:32,121 --> 00:15:32,954
but piaget tended to think that the 
child came into the world with nothing 

334
00:15:35,931 --> 00:15:36,764
but a set of reflexes that's as 
technical claim and that the bootstrap 

335
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,053
off those reflexes and I think that's,
it underestimates the degree to which 

336
00:15:43,921 --> 00:15:47,150
the child comes into the world as an 
already prepared unit.

337
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,670
And I mean he just thought of those 
things.

338
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:51,920
It's so self evident that you don't need
to talk about them,

339
00:15:51,921 --> 00:15:54,530
but that's actually not true.
You do need to talk about them.

340
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:55,364
We know for example,
that if you provide children with food 

341
00:15:57,531 --> 00:16:00,290
and shelter and an adequate food and 
shelter,

342
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:02,420
but you don't interact with them 
socially,

343
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,670
almost all of them die in the first 
year.

344
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:06,910
Right?
It's not optional touch.

345
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,280
He's not optional for children.
Attention is not optional for children.

346
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:14,030
Play is not optional for children.
So it isn't just like,

347
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:14,864
well the child comes into the world with
a set of reflexes and can adapt to any 

348
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:18,734
old environments like know the 
environment has to be structured in a 

349
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:21,854
certain way or the child will die.
And it's very interesting when it comes 

350
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:25,874
to things like play and touch because 
you wouldn't think of those as 

351
00:16:27,531 --> 00:16:29,180
fundamental necessities,
right?

352
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:30,014
But it turns out that they are,
if you deprive a child badly enough of 

353
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:36,140
play and touch in the first three years 
of their life,

354
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,033
even if they survive,
what comes out at the end of that is 

355
00:16:39,201 --> 00:16:43,010
often something that's like barely 
recognizable as a functional human being

356
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,023
and cannot be repaired after that point.
And that that experiment was done with 

357
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:50,750
Romanian orphans back in back in the 
nineties so,

358
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:51,603
and it was,
it was an ugly situation to say the 

359
00:16:53,001 --> 00:16:53,834
least.

360
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,453
Okay,
so now you take these underlying 

361
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:59,660
biological systems and maybe they 
aggregate themselves into something that

362
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:01,510
vaguely looks like your temperament,
your,

363
00:17:01,511 --> 00:17:04,550
your five temperamental dimensions.
So maybe if you're an extrovert,

364
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:05,743
you're dominated by the dopaminergic 
system just like you are as if you're 

365
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:10,430
high in openness.
And if you're,

366
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,460
if you're,
if you're high in neuroticism,

367
00:17:13,461 --> 00:17:18,080
it's mostly that you're dominated by 
anxiety systems and systems that mediate

368
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,090
emotional pain.
And if you're agreeable,

369
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,103
you're dominated by the function of the 
underlying maternal slash care 

370
00:17:24,021 --> 00:17:26,690
affiliation systems.
But so you could say,

371
00:17:26,691 --> 00:17:28,700
well,
you've got these loose,

372
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:33,740
you've got a multitude of fundamental 
biological predispositions that manifest

373
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:36,410
themselves as implicit stories,
something like that.

374
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,543
And they organize themselves into the 
primary temperaments and the primary 

375
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:42,200
temperaments are,
are,

376
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,123
are biasing factors that determine in 
part the nature of the interpretive 

377
00:17:46,161 --> 00:17:47,840
structure that you're going to lay out 
in the world.

378
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:49,980
It's not entirely determined by your 
temperament.

379
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,080
We know that personality is only 
predicting,

380
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,213
you know,
something like let's say 10% of the 

381
00:17:54,631 --> 00:17:57,390
variance in most complex social outcomes
and,

382
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:00,690
and the other elements are well 
temperamental as you might be.

383
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:02,730
You still have to get along with other 
people in the world.

384
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:05,790
So you know,
you come in with these internal biases,

385
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:06,624
but they have still have to be modified 
extensively by your social and your 

386
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:11,190
natural surround.
Okay.

387
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,293
And then you develop your routines from 
the bottom up as piaget pointed out in 

388
00:18:16,531 --> 00:18:17,364
sometimes from the top down because now 
and then you can think yourself into a 

389
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:23,310
radical transformation.
But mostly what you're doing is building

390
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,144
the micro units of your interpretive 
scheme is and your behaviors and 

391
00:18:27,301 --> 00:18:28,134
aggregating them into higher order 
structures that you can then tag with 

392
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,930
higher order abstractions.
And we talked about that.

393
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,230
You can't tell a three year old to clean
up his room.

394
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,333
And the reason for that is he,
those are empty boxes as far as the 

395
00:18:40,711 --> 00:18:43,800
kid's concerned clean he's doing,
he might,

396
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:46,560
he might have room,
he might have that clean,

397
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:47,394
he doesn't have,
he might have pickup the teddy bear and 

398
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,050
put it in that space,
right?

399
00:18:52,051 --> 00:18:53,850
So that's one of these little micro 
routines.

400
00:18:53,851 --> 00:18:54,684
And maybe you say you put 20 of those 
micro routines together and now you can 

401
00:18:57,811 --> 00:18:58,644
say clean up your room.
And basically what you're saying is 

402
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,403
here's,
implement the 10 micro routines that 

403
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,474
you've learned.
And so a well functioning personality 

404
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,863
has all the micro routines in place.
That's actually something that you help 

405
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:11,670
people with if you're a behavioral 
therapist.

406
00:19:11,671 --> 00:19:12,504
Because one of the things you assume if 
you're a behavioral therapist is that 

407
00:19:15,181 --> 00:19:19,350
sometimes the reason people aren't doing
things is because they don't know how.

408
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,783
You know,
sometimes maybe the person is depressed 

409
00:19:22,081 --> 00:19:25,530
but potentially high functioning,
they got all the damn micro routines,

410
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,600
they're well socialized,
they're just dormant.

411
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,880
You got to get them awake again and 
implementing them.

412
00:19:29,881 --> 00:19:30,714
But sometimes you get someone in your,
in your practice say who's just been 

413
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,820
neglected.
Like you cannot believe,

414
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:36,654
right?
The parents never paid any attention to 

415
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,470
them or maybe just punish them every 
time they did something good.

416
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:42,450
That's really fun.
And then,

417
00:19:42,451 --> 00:19:43,284
you know,
they didn't make friends and so they're 

418
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:45,000
really,
really

419
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,960
vague and,
and,

420
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:48,903
and poorly articulated.
And so then what you do is you work at 

421
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:51,924
the bottom of the micro routines and get
them to practice building up all these 

422
00:19:55,201 --> 00:19:57,330
little attributes that they didn't build
up.

423
00:19:57,331 --> 00:19:59,370
And you know,
one of the things you can think about in

424
00:19:59,371 --> 00:20:00,204
terms of character development is so now
maybe understand something about your 

425
00:20:02,881 --> 00:20:03,660
own personality.

426
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,493
You might say,
well what could you do to improve your 

427
00:20:05,431 --> 00:20:06,264
personality?
And answer is develop some of the micro 

428
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:11,970
routines on the other side of the 
personality distribution.

429
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,510
So if you're disagreeable as hell,
maybe you could start learning how to do

430
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:18,660
nice things for people.
And that actually works by the way.

431
00:20:18,661 --> 00:20:19,494
So if you take disagreeable people who 
are depressed and you get them doing 

432
00:20:21,661 --> 00:20:23,940
nice things for other people,
their depression tends to lift.

433
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,220
But then by the same token,
if you're agreeable,

434
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,720
then you should practice doing some 
things for yourself and being more tough

435
00:20:30,721 --> 00:20:34,290
minded in your negotiations.
And so you can sort of place yourself on

436
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,360
the,
on the personality trait distribution,

437
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,860
you know,
you're extrovert.

438
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:38,850
It's like,
okay man,

439
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:41,790
learn to spend some time with yourself.
Right?

440
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:42,863
You're low in openness.
Well try reading a book that's outside 

441
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:45,601
of your,
you know,

442
00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:46,434
your,
your sphere of interest now in that if 

443
00:20:48,701 --> 00:20:49,534
you're conscientious,
well you should probably learn how to 

444
00:20:51,191 --> 00:20:52,000
relax.

445
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,740
Okay.
Usually and so forth.

446
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:54,574
So you can,
I think partly what you're doing as 

447
00:20:55,751 --> 00:20:58,810
you're developing your personality is 
not moving the mean much,

448
00:20:58,811 --> 00:21:01,210
the average where you know where you're 
located,

449
00:21:01,211 --> 00:21:04,840
but you're extending the standard 
deviation so that you're a bigger bag of

450
00:21:04,841 --> 00:21:05,674
tricks than you were before.
And I think you can practice that 

451
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,780
consciously.
It's like you're hyper orderly.

452
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:13,240
It's well get a dog,
you know,

453
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,530
dogs,
they're messy,

454
00:21:14,531 --> 00:21:15,580
horrible things,
you know,

455
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:18,220
it's just what you need if you're hyper 
orderly because they're gonna leave hair

456
00:21:18,221 --> 00:21:19,810
everywhere and force you to live with 
it.

457
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:20,920
And so,
okay,

458
00:21:20,921 --> 00:21:23,140
so and so this is sort of you,
right?

459
00:21:23,141 --> 00:21:23,974
This is your personality.
It's this connect collection of routine 

460
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,410
sub routines that you've turned into a 
hierarchy.

461
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,270
And then there's something at the top of
it.

462
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,740
And that's,
that's a big question.

463
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,720
Like what the hell should be at the top 
of the hierarchy?

464
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,210
Because that's the ultimate question of 
unity and the,

465
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,650
and the,
the clinicians would say,

466
00:21:38,651 --> 00:21:40,330
well,
it's the self actualized person,

467
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:42,520
or it's the self or something like that.
You know,

468
00:21:42,521 --> 00:21:43,450
that's,
that's the eye,

469
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:47,410
that's the implicit and perhaps explicit
ideal that you're aiming for.

470
00:21:47,411 --> 00:21:51,080
And you might say,
well is does such thing existed?

471
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,440
I would say,
well do you admire people?

472
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,210
Cause that's your answer,
right?

473
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,470
Do you despise people while you like 
some people and you don't like others?

474
00:21:59,471 --> 00:22:00,304
You respect some people you don't 
respect others while you're acting out 

475
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,860
the notion that there's at least an 
implicit ideal,

476
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,690
you do the same thing when you go to 
movies,

477
00:22:07,691 --> 00:22:09,310
you know you,
you know who the hero is,

478
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:10,144
you know who the bad guy is,
you're acting out the proposition that 

479
00:22:12,521 --> 00:22:15,970
there's some sort of value hierarchy and
there's some sort of manifestation of it

480
00:22:15,971 --> 00:22:17,680
that's coherent across time.

481
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,663
So you appear to believe that and you 
know you are driven at least to some 

482
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:26,320
degree by your own inner ideals.
And so you tend to answer the question,

483
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:30,220
is that real with an affirmative?
And if you don't,

484
00:22:30,221 --> 00:22:31,054
there's catastrophic consequences.
Nicha and the existentialists were very 

485
00:22:33,491 --> 00:22:35,680
good at detailing.
That's like you let your value hierarchy

486
00:22:35,681 --> 00:22:37,420
disintegrate.
Well then what?

487
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:42,310
Well part of it is nihilistic chaos.
Who that's not so much fun.

488
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,413
And then there's the alignment of 
nihilistic chaos with the intrinsic 

489
00:22:46,271 --> 00:22:49,000
desire that someone will come along and 
tell you what to do.

490
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,283
Right?
So what happens is if you let this 

491
00:22:51,191 --> 00:22:52,024
devolve,
you end up with nihilistic exit with 

492
00:22:54,131 --> 00:22:57,700
nihilistic chaos or the demand for,
for the tyrant to come forward.

493
00:22:57,701 --> 00:22:58,534
And we've had that happen lots of times 
and doesn't seem to have gotten that 

494
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:02,260
will.
So,

495
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,341
all right,
well,

496
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:09,610
so what happens when you,
you lay out these little routines in the

497
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:11,590
world at different levels of analysis.

498
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,083
Well,
this is how your emotions function 

499
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,450
broadly speaking.
You know,

500
00:23:16,451 --> 00:23:20,890
you're aiming at something and that this
is an oversimplification,

501
00:23:20,891 --> 00:23:22,540
which is why I want to show you this,
right?

502
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:27,541
When I show you this,
assume that it's made out of that,

503
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,060
right?
It's just a schematic oversimplification

504
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:31,894
because even if,
let's say that I'm trying to do 

505
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:37,060
something as simple as walking towards 
the door,

506
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,433
I mean that the action of walking 
towards the door is predicated on the 

507
00:23:42,371 --> 00:23:43,204
existence of all the sub routines that 
enabled to propel my body across time 

508
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:49,840
and space.
And like there's that t.

509
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:50,703
Dot.
It took a lot of internal organization 

510
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:54,530
to get that right.
It's a traumatized now.

511
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,510
And so you can treat it like it's 
invisible.

512
00:23:56,511 --> 00:24:00,950
But implicit in any one of these 
structures is this entire structure.

513
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,950
And you actually see this in therapy 
very frequently too.

514
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,990
So I was talking to a client the other 
day,

515
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,030
it was so interesting.

516
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,023
This person said something,
he had been talking to his mother and 

517
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:14,300
he's,
he just made a casual comment.

518
00:24:14,301 --> 00:24:17,990
He said he was talking to his mother who
is in a state of grief for,

519
00:24:17,991 --> 00:24:20,340
for good reasons that were independent 
of,

520
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,310
of this particular person who said,
and I hate her.

521
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,500
And I thought,
oh,

522
00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:29,360
that's interesting.
Like where did that come from?

523
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,570
And so I made a comment on that.
That's a Freudian slip,

524
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,580
right?
Because there was,

525
00:24:34,581 --> 00:24:35,414
the conversation was flowing and then 
this little emotion tagged utterance 

526
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:42,560
came forward.
And whenever an emotion tagged utterance

527
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:45,050
of that sort comes forward,
you know,

528
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:50,010
it's associated with a whole rat's nest 
of underlying pain and anxiety and,

529
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,230
and,
and,

530
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,383
and what would you call it?
Disappointment and frustration that 

531
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:57,350
hasn't been properly rectified.
So it's like a marker.

532
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,600
And yet you know this,
when you're talking to people,

533
00:24:59,601 --> 00:25:02,110
they say something and you think,
oh wow.

534
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,850
Too much information.
That's one way of thinking about,

535
00:25:04,851 --> 00:25:06,500
it's like,
just what are you up to?

536
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,353
And then if you have any sense,
you just forget that that even happened 

537
00:25:09,651 --> 00:25:10,970
and you continue.
But that's,

538
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,600
that's like the snout of a dragon peak 
peeking out from a cave.

539
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:15,920
And you might say,
well,

540
00:25:15,921 --> 00:25:16,754
it's just a snout man.
But it's not because dragon snouts tend 

541
00:25:19,521 --> 00:25:20,354
to be attached to the whole Damn Dragon.
And so this is also something to know 

542
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,820
about relationships because when you're 
in a relationship with someone,

543
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:28,190
they'll do that now and then they'll,
you know,

544
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,890
outer something and you think,
ah Ha.

545
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,143
I was like,
there's a bump in the road where we're 

546
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,850
going to look underneath that at our 
peril.

547
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,280
But if you do go down there and you look
at it,

548
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:37,670
then,
uh,

549
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:41,240
then the whole thing comes,
you can start to disentangle the,

550
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:46,100
the way above of,
of memories and experiences that are all

551
00:25:46,101 --> 00:25:49,100
tangled together as a consequence of 
their emotional identity.

552
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,390
Because I could say,
well,

553
00:25:50,391 --> 00:25:51,224
everything that makes you anxious or 
everything that makes you upset is the 

554
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:56,960
same as every other thing that's ever 
made you upset.

555
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,333
And so,
and then there's an even different sub 

556
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,150
set of that,
which is all those things that have made

557
00:26:02,151 --> 00:26:02,984
you upset that you've never dealt with.
They're all laying down there at the 

558
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:08,900
bottom of your nasty little soul waiting
to pop themselves up in some,

559
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,760
in some random moderates,
right?

560
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:11,923
And so then you go in there at your 
peril because if you're the person who 

561
00:26:14,601 --> 00:26:15,434
pokes around in that,
then you're going to get blasted with 

562
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:17,744
all of that stuff.
It's going to come out like almost 

563
00:26:19,701 --> 00:26:22,550
uncontrollably then.
Then you can sort it out.

564
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:26,180
And so what you find is if you ask a 
person a question like that and then you

565
00:26:26,181 --> 00:26:29,150
let them free associate,
which is just talk about it,

566
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,223
they'll,
they'll do a wandering around like that 

567
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,290
maze that I told you about.

568
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:36,560
They'll do a wandering around of that 
entire territory.

569
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,490
And sometimes just having them wander 
around in it can help them straighten it

570
00:26:40,491 --> 00:26:41,324
out.
But you might find out that something 

571
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:43,184
happened to them years ago that left 
them with a terrible sense of guilt or 

572
00:26:46,651 --> 00:26:48,850
dismay or frustration.
And then when,

573
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,150
when they interact with their parents in
a certain way,

574
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:51,984
the parent knows exactly how to tap that
and then that all comes up and that's 

575
00:26:54,691 --> 00:26:56,310
what produces that,
that little,

576
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,443
that little utterance.
And so that's the material of the world 

577
00:26:59,761 --> 00:27:03,870
manifesting itself.
That's what matters manifesting itself.

578
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:06,870
And it almost always manifests itself as
an object.

579
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,080
Something that objects,
we're having a conversation,

580
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,880
it's going quite well.
No problem.

581
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,780
There's a bump in it.
There's an emotional disjunct right now.

582
00:27:15,781 --> 00:27:17,880
We're no longer in the same place at the
same time.

583
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:19,560
We're no longer playing the same game.

584
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,940
So then I might say,
okay,

585
00:27:20,941 --> 00:27:23,040
well let's open that up and see what's 
behind it.

586
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,213
While in the question is what's behind 
the game you're playing an answer to 

587
00:27:28,111 --> 00:27:32,190
that is all the world that you're 
ignoring always.

588
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:35,610
So when,
so when imagine that,

589
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,293
think about it this way.
You're trying to do well in a class and 

590
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:43,860
you get a bad grade.
Okay,

591
00:27:43,861 --> 00:27:44,694
so you're in this little frame.
You want to get a good grade that isn't 

592
00:27:47,311 --> 00:27:48,930
happening.
He got a bad grade.

593
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,033
Okay,
what is it that's manifesting itself as 

594
00:27:52,111 --> 00:27:54,240
the bad grade?
While you could say,

595
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:56,400
well,
it's a c minus on a piece of paper.

596
00:27:56,401 --> 00:27:56,911
It's like,
well,

597
00:27:56,911 --> 00:27:57,720
that's,
you know,

598
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,500
really know that that's the objective 
manifestation.

599
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:02,603
You got a piece of paper with a c minus 
the value free proposition is that 

600
00:28:06,031 --> 00:28:08,820
you've been delivered a piece of paper 
with a curve on it and a little,

601
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:09,930
you know,
negative side.

602
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:11,550
Well,
you think,

603
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:13,020
well,
that's what that is.

604
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,190
Well,
you know,

605
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:15,900
it's as dopey as thinking,
well,

606
00:28:15,901 --> 00:28:16,734
here you got your failing grade.
You go into the lab and you like weigh 

607
00:28:18,841 --> 00:28:19,674
it on a scale.
Then you burn it and see what it was 

608
00:28:21,571 --> 00:28:22,470
made of.
It's like,

609
00:28:22,471 --> 00:28:23,970
well,
why did I get so upset about that?

610
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:25,470
It's just paper.
It's like,

611
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,100
no,
that's not just paper.

612
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,950
It's an entity that exists in a web of 
connections.

613
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,430
The fact that it signified by paper is 
almost completely irrelevant.

614
00:28:35,431 --> 00:28:38,400
What is it?
The answer is you don't know.

615
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,330
And that's why when you pick it up,
you get this paralyzed,

616
00:28:42,331 --> 00:28:43,164
sinking feeling because your limbic 
system is a lot smarter than your 

617
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,200
perceptual systems.
And your perceptual systems say,

618
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:50,250
well,
that's a piece of paper,

619
00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:52,050
and your limbic system says,
Nah,

620
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,440
for sure dragon.
Right?

621
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,663
Right.
And so then you're sweating and then 

622
00:28:58,081 --> 00:28:58,914
maybe you put it away and you go play 
video games because you know better the 

623
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:04,770
hypothetical dragon,
then the real dragon.

624
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:08,490
And so instead you pull out the piece of
paper maybe and you think,

625
00:29:08,491 --> 00:29:11,940
okay,
why did I get this c minus?

626
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,250
Well,
that's a hell of a question,

627
00:29:14,251 --> 00:29:15,360
isn't it?
It's like,

628
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,090
maybe you're stupid.
Well,

629
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:18,924
that could be,
or at least stupid compared to who you 

630
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:21,330
think you are.
Like that's,

631
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,400
that's the real horror that's lurking 
there rights.

632
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:23,671
Like,
oh,

633
00:29:23,671 --> 00:29:25,620
I thought it was kind of smart.
That's a,

634
00:29:25,621 --> 00:29:28,380
that's a proposition of the highest 
order.

635
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,570
I thought I was kind of smart.
It's like,

636
00:29:30,571 --> 00:29:32,190
yeah,
well what about this c minus?

637
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,810
It's like,
well,

638
00:29:33,811 --> 00:29:35,580
that God damn professor,
right?

639
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,750
That's the first thing.
I've been attacked by a predator.

640
00:29:39,751 --> 00:29:41,410
That's the first response.
Right?

641
00:29:41,411 --> 00:29:43,120
So it's,
it's a nonsensical message.

642
00:29:43,121 --> 00:29:45,370
It's just delivered by someone evil and 
predatory.

643
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:47,610
Well that's,
you know,

644
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,960
possible.
But I wouldn't go there.

645
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,320
I wouldn't go there first necessarily.
So,

646
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,570
but then while then say you don't go 
there.

647
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,051
Okay,
well,

648
00:29:56,051 --> 00:29:56,884
so what is this exactly?
Do you not know what you thought you 

649
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:02,710
knew or are you not who you think you 
are?

650
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,580
Do you not work hard enough?
Are Your values not organized properly?

651
00:30:06,581 --> 00:30:09,820
Do you misuse your time?
Are you in the wrong field?

652
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:13,600
Is the way you're construing Your Life 
Completely Inappropriate?

653
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:14,434
Are you acting out what your parents 
wanted you to do it and you're pissed 

654
00:30:16,571 --> 00:30:17,404
off about it.
So you're only running at 40% to spite 

655
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:20,134
them despite the fact that they're 
paying $25,000 a year for your 

656
00:30:22,751 --> 00:30:24,610
education.
Cause that's a fun game.

657
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,800
Yeah,
I'll go do what you want me to do,

658
00:30:26,801 --> 00:30:27,634
but I'll fail at.
But not completely because then that 

659
00:30:30,851 --> 00:30:31,684
would wouldn't cost you very much.
I'll just fail a little bit so that you 

660
00:30:34,931 --> 00:30:38,050
have to spend all that money forcing me 
to do what I don't want to do,

661
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,820
but you'll never get to escape from it.

662
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,833
And then every time we interact,
I'll stab you in various ways that you 

663
00:30:43,181 --> 00:30:46,810
don't quite understand,
just to show you how irritated I am that

664
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:49,810
I happen to be acting out the destiny 
that you've put forward for me.

665
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,070
So maybe that's part of the Dragon,
right?

666
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,980
And then that pulls in the whole parent 
thing and you know it's,

667
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:58,840
these are bottomless pits.
Often when you,

668
00:30:58,841 --> 00:31:01,810
when you're in the world and something 
objects to you,

669
00:31:01,811 --> 00:31:02,644
something that matters,
objects to you then in the entire 

670
00:31:06,101 --> 00:31:08,800
unrealized world is in that thing that 
objects,

671
00:31:08,801 --> 00:31:09,634
it's all tangled up inside it.
That's why it's the great dragon of 

672
00:31:11,831 --> 00:31:12,664
chaos.
It's everything that's outside of your 

673
00:31:14,381 --> 00:31:16,720
conceptual structure.
And what is that?

674
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,000
It's everything that lurks outside of 
your,

675
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,103
of your walled city.
And it's manifested itself like the 

676
00:31:22,871 --> 00:31:25,030
snake in the garden.
And the easiest thing to do is say,

677
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,190
I'm not having anything to do with that.

678
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:30,250
But the problem with that is,
well,

679
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,650
you get your c minus and you don't do 
anything about it.

680
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,080
Maybe you're a little bitter and more 
resentful in your study.

681
00:31:35,081 --> 00:31:35,914
Habits get a little worse.
So the next time you get like a d plus 

682
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,680
and then you collect a bunch of f's and 
then you stopped going to school,

683
00:31:41,681 --> 00:31:44,140
then you stop showering,
right?

684
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:46,860
Then you end up jumping off the bridge.
And so that's uh,

685
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,063
that's,
that's how the dragon eats you when you 

686
00:31:49,211 --> 00:31:52,390
don't pay attention to it.
And so it's no bloody wonder that people

687
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:53,500
avoid,
you know,

688
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,573
it's really no wonder that they avoid 
because error messages contain within 

689
00:31:58,391 --> 00:31:59,224
them the implicit world.
Now the upside of that is while they 

690
00:32:03,461 --> 00:32:07,300
contain within them the implicit world 
and the world isn't all negative,

691
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:08,134
and so maybe you get your c minus and 
that's actually the best gift you ever 

692
00:32:10,691 --> 00:32:14,080
got because somebody finally took you 
and went whack,

693
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:15,880
you know,
clue in.

694
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,800
And so you take that apart and you 
think,

695
00:32:17,801 --> 00:32:18,820
oh,
I don't know how to write.

696
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,120
I don't know how to think.
I've never read anything in my life.

697
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,190
My study habits are a Bismal,
you know,

698
00:32:24,191 --> 00:32:26,800
like maybe I'm working at 2% efficiency,
which,

699
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,630
which is probably,
I would suspect that,

700
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,610
you know,
some of you aren't doing that,

701
00:32:30,611 --> 00:32:31,444
but I bet you that I bet there's 30 30 
to 50% of the people in the room are 

702
00:32:35,501 --> 00:32:37,990
working at 2% efficiency.
It's like you got it.

703
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:40,850
That's,
so to find that out is so optimistic.

704
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:42,950
I mean,
if you're barely hanging in there,

705
00:32:42,951 --> 00:32:46,700
but you're only working out 2% you might
imagine what you could have as a life if

706
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:50,450
you work at at like 50% so,
so the,

707
00:32:50,451 --> 00:32:53,210
the c minus can be the best gift you 
ever had.

708
00:32:53,211 --> 00:32:55,070
And that's the gold that the dragon 
hordes,

709
00:32:55,071 --> 00:32:55,340
right?

710
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,920
That's exactly what that means.
And so,

711
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,593
well,
so you're moving from point a to point 

712
00:33:01,221 --> 00:33:03,350
b.
In your little circumscribed world,

713
00:33:03,351 --> 00:33:06,320
you've made everything invisible.
And as long as that works,

714
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:08,750
then your theory is good enough.
It's accurate enough.

715
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:11,000
It's true enough,
you're in your little paradise.

716
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,073
But if something comes up and objects,
well that's where your character is 

717
00:33:15,891 --> 00:33:18,560
tested fundamentally.
That's the character test.

718
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:20,780
It's like,
what do you do with messages of error?

719
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,150
And that's a tricky issue.
Okay,

720
00:33:23,151 --> 00:33:27,500
so here's a solution to that.
Here's what not to do.

721
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:30,060
I am a bad person.
I got to see mice.

722
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:30,943
I'm a bad person.
I might as well just go jump off the 

723
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:33,140
bridge.
It's like,

724
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,280
no,
that's not good.

725
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:36,020
Because what that means is that every 
time,

726
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,813
every time you try to learn something,
you're going to make a mistake because 

727
00:33:39,531 --> 00:33:41,360
what you know,
so you're gonna make mistakes.

728
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,640
And if the rule is every time you make a
mistake,

729
00:33:43,641 --> 00:33:48,050
you're going to go jump off the bridge,
then that's not a useful problem solving

730
00:33:48,051 --> 00:33:50,810
strategy.
And so when you make a mistake,

731
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:53,840
you don't get to beat yourself to death 
with a club.

732
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,213
It's a bad strategy.
And you'll have your internal tyrant in 

733
00:33:57,111 --> 00:33:59,360
there who's perfectly happy about doing 
that.

734
00:33:59,361 --> 00:34:00,490
That's the,
you know,

735
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,560
overactive superego that Freud talked 
about.

736
00:34:03,561 --> 00:34:04,394
Maybe it came to you via a parent who 
was too authoritarian or a grandparent 

737
00:34:07,971 --> 00:34:08,804
or,
or maybe it's just you cause you're 

738
00:34:10,191 --> 00:34:13,940
disagreeable in neurotic and so you'll 
take yours or had hyper conscientious,

739
00:34:13,941 --> 00:34:17,600
you'll take yourself apart.
Well starting the,

740
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:22,790
so you've got a problem,
something has objected to you,

741
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:24,890
then the question is,
well,

742
00:34:24,891 --> 00:34:25,910
what does that mean?
Well,

743
00:34:25,911 --> 00:34:27,410
maybe you're not looking at the world,
right?

744
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:30,350
Maybe your goals are wrong,
maybe you're not acting properly.

745
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,011
So,
okay,

746
00:34:31,011 --> 00:34:35,420
so the question that arises when an 
obstacle emerges is,

747
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:40,370
which part of this structure needs 
attention?

748
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:41,653
And the first answer can't be all of it,
which is why when you're arguing with 

749
00:34:46,011 --> 00:34:46,844
someone in an intimate relationship and 
you're angry at them and you want to 

750
00:34:50,391 --> 00:34:52,010
win,
which is a big mistake,

751
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,360
you want to,
when you say,

752
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,780
well you're,
this is what you're like,

753
00:34:56,781 --> 00:34:59,300
here's another 10 examples of how you've
done that in the past.

754
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,700
And I can new rate more of them if you'd
like.

755
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,890
And so it doesn't,
that's actually what you like.

756
00:35:03,891 --> 00:35:04,724
And I tried fixing it didn't work.
And so it looks like you're going to be 

757
00:35:06,861 --> 00:35:09,230
like that up into the future and you're 
basically saying to them,

758
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,303
well,
you're a bad person and the only thing 

759
00:35:11,511 --> 00:35:12,344
they can do is either collapse or punch 
you and punching you is actually better 

760
00:35:16,101 --> 00:35:16,970
than collapsing.

761
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,930
But you don't.
You know what I mean?

762
00:35:17,931 --> 00:35:19,880
It's such a counterproductive way of 
arguing.

763
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,013
You don't leave the person any out.
And so maybe while they're civilized so 

764
00:35:24,171 --> 00:35:25,004
it doesn't get physical,
well maybe that's good and maybe it 

765
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:27,794
isn't,
but then they end up either really not 

766
00:35:29,181 --> 00:35:30,014
happy with you in a way that they will 
manifest the first possible opportunity 

767
00:35:32,871 --> 00:35:34,970
they get.
Or they have to go off in the corner and

768
00:35:34,971 --> 00:35:35,804
cringe.
It's like,

769
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:36,861
great,
you won.

770
00:35:36,861 --> 00:35:39,780
It's now your partners either hates you 
or is cringing.

771
00:35:39,781 --> 00:35:42,780
It's great.
That's a real good victory band cry rack

772
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:43,614
up about a hundred victories like that,
and you'll be in divorce court and 

773
00:35:45,991 --> 00:35:49,770
spending $250,000 while being miserable 
about it.

774
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,630
Yeah.
So anyway,

775
00:35:51,631 --> 00:35:54,270
so something objects to you and you 
think,

776
00:35:54,271 --> 00:35:55,104
okay,
well I need to,

777
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,780
I need to take myself apart,
right,

778
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:00,840
because there's a piece that's broken 
somewhere and then you might think,

779
00:36:00,841 --> 00:36:01,620
well,
let's,

780
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,780
let's assume it's a little pace to begin
with.

781
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,610
That's the right mechanism.
It's like,

782
00:36:05,611 --> 00:36:07,410
okay,
you got a c minus

783
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,773
that doesn't prove that you're stupid 
and now it implies that you might be 

784
00:36:13,111 --> 00:36:14,070
stupid,
but it doesn't.

785
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:15,120
Right.
Really it does.

786
00:36:15,121 --> 00:36:16,290
And that's why you don't want to look at
it.

787
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:17,124
Maybe it applies that you're lazier,
implies that you're ignorant or like it 

788
00:36:19,651 --> 00:36:20,484
implies all sorts of terrible.
Might imply that you're a bad person 

789
00:36:22,951 --> 00:36:24,990
even,
but you don't want to leap to that.

790
00:36:24,991 --> 00:36:28,290
And that's sort of the proclamation of 
innocence before guilt.

791
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:33,690
Assume that you're the least amount of 
reprehensible and ignorant possible.

792
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,660
And so then you look at the micro 
routines,

793
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:39,300
it's okay,
well I got a c minus in this course,

794
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:44,540
maybe I should study for that course,
15 minutes more a day for the next three

795
00:36:45,211 --> 00:36:47,430
months.
And then you ask yourself,

796
00:36:47,431 --> 00:36:48,780
do you think you could do that?
No,

797
00:36:48,781 --> 00:36:49,620
I'm too useless.

798
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,170
Okay,
how about 15 minutes every second day?

799
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:53,004
You think you could do that?
You put it in your schedule like 15 

800
00:36:55,081 --> 00:36:58,650
minutes every second day in the morning 
and that's while you think,

801
00:36:58,651 --> 00:36:59,610
well,
what's wrong with me?

802
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:00,623
Well,
I'm not very good at managing my study 

803
00:37:02,971 --> 00:37:03,804
schedule.
That's not quite down here at the 

804
00:37:05,011 --> 00:37:07,650
behavioral level,
but it's pretty close because what you,

805
00:37:07,651 --> 00:37:08,484
you can take an action,
you can open up your schedule and you 

806
00:37:10,141 --> 00:37:11,190
can say,
Oh mark,

807
00:37:11,191 --> 00:37:14,250
15 minutes away aside,
then you can practice doing that.

808
00:37:14,251 --> 00:37:15,084
It's pretty low level in the hierarchy 
means while you're still not a horrible 

809
00:37:18,121 --> 00:37:18,954
person,
you just got to polish up your work 

810
00:37:20,641 --> 00:37:23,130
ethic and so what you want to do is you 
want to,

811
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:25,260
it's like,
it's like the L.

812
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:25,770
Dot.
Adage.

813
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:26,603
You got to stand up for yourself,
but you don't want to make unnecessary 

814
00:37:28,411 --> 00:37:30,540
enemies.
Hots are really good thing to know.

815
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,760
It's like shut the hell up most of the 
time,

816
00:37:32,761 --> 00:37:33,594
but now and then you don't shut up 
because it's time to say something you 

817
00:37:36,271 --> 00:37:37,104
don't.
You don't want to make unnecessary 

818
00:37:38,101 --> 00:37:38,934
enemies though.
Well,

819
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,630
you don't want to take yourself apart 
any more than is absolutely necessary.

820
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,830
Start little and you do that with people
around you to like if you have a child,

821
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,040
you know and the child does something 
that isn't right,

822
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,060
then you think,
okay,

823
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,163
minimal necessary intervention.
What can we do to decrease the 

824
00:37:54,841 --> 00:37:57,120
probability that that's going to occur 
in the future?

825
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,360
So,
and that's it.

826
00:37:59,361 --> 00:38:01,140
So that's a good thing to know with 
children.

827
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,090
And it's also a good thing to know with 
your partners.

828
00:38:03,091 --> 00:38:04,500
You have having an argument with them.
It's like,

829
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,420
okay,
what the hell do you want?

830
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:11,070
What's the minimum thing you can request
from them that would satisfy you and the

831
00:38:11,071 --> 00:38:14,550
evil part of your soul is going to be,
I want them cringing in the corner.

832
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,870
It's like,
yeah,

833
00:38:15,871 --> 00:38:17,760
get that.
Get that stuff under control,

834
00:38:17,761 --> 00:38:18,594
man.
See if you can figure out what the 

835
00:38:19,871 --> 00:38:23,160
person could offer you that would be 
minimal that you would accept.

836
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,960
And then tell them that.
It's like,

837
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,720
here's the words I would like you to say
in the apology.

838
00:38:27,721 --> 00:38:28,554
I would like you to formulate,
assuming that you think you did 

839
00:38:29,941 --> 00:38:33,030
something wrong when you have to argue 
about that because maybe you didn't.

840
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:36,580
But if you did,
I want to specify precisely and narrowly

841
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:37,623
and I want to give you an escape route.
And you know you might only be able to 

842
00:38:40,841 --> 00:38:43,720
do it badly because you're still mad.
So you apologize.

843
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:44,554
Halfheartedly.
It's like you get a pat on the head for 

844
00:38:45,731 --> 00:38:46,564
that good.
Next time it'll be 51% not 

845
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,490
halfheartedly.
Right?

846
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,353
So it's careful training,
it's careful training of yourself and 

847
00:38:55,301 --> 00:38:57,460
other people with,
with the goal in mind,

848
00:38:57,461 --> 00:39:01,060
but also with the least amount of 
harshness possible.

849
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,570
And then the other thing to do as well,
and this is also true for you,

850
00:39:04,571 --> 00:39:05,404
and this is something I learned from 
studying the behaviorist is like watch 

851
00:39:07,901 --> 00:39:08,734
the people around you like a hawk.
Whenever they do something that you 

852
00:39:10,991 --> 00:39:12,820
think is good,
you tell them,

853
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,740
that's wisdom,
man.

854
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:15,723
You'll get so far with that.
You cannot bloody well believe it 

855
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,440
because most people,
you know,

856
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,343
they're afraid of any number of things.
But one of the things they're really 

857
00:39:24,251 --> 00:39:27,730
afraid of is that now and then they'll 
creep out of their cynical shell and try

858
00:39:27,731 --> 00:39:28,930
to do something good.
You know,

859
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:31,690
it's like there,
it's like they're popping out this thing

860
00:39:31,691 --> 00:39:32,524
that's unbelievably vulnerable.
Then try to do something good and creep 

861
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,750
right back into their persona and 
they'll look around,

862
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,880
see if anyone noticed and sometimes 
they'll get punished for it.

863
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,410
And then,
well then they won't do it again.

864
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:47,560
So don't do that.
But then now and then you think,

865
00:39:47,561 --> 00:39:48,610
hey,
I saw you do this.

866
00:39:48,611 --> 00:39:50,230
It was actually,
that was actually pretty good.

867
00:39:50,231 --> 00:39:52,450
And they think,
Oh wow,

868
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,510
somebody noticed,
you know,

869
00:39:53,511 --> 00:39:55,480
was like wow.
And then they'll think,

870
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:56,523
yeah,
I could,

871
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:01,330
maybe I could do that again.
And if you want to live with someone for

872
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:04,480
a long period of time,
I would say every time they do something

873
00:40:04,481 --> 00:40:07,120
that you would like them to do more of.
Number one,

874
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:11,260
notice number two,
tell them right.

875
00:40:11,261 --> 00:40:15,850
Because I know you don't want to because
you really want to dominate them and you

876
00:40:15,851 --> 00:40:18,310
don't want them thriving because then 
they'd be,

877
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:19,443
they'd be competition to you and you 
wouldn't be able to go complain to your 

878
00:40:21,401 --> 00:40:23,500
mother about what a miserable partner 
you have.

879
00:40:23,501 --> 00:40:24,334
And you know how delightful that is.
So you'd have to forego all that 

880
00:40:26,861 --> 00:40:29,270
pleasure if you actually helped your 
person developed.

881
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:31,870
So you've got to get over all that.
It's really annoying.

882
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,550
So you know,
you've got this person,

883
00:40:33,551 --> 00:40:34,301
peg does.
Yeah,

884
00:40:34,301 --> 00:40:35,700
you're stuck with them.
And you know,

885
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,633
maybe it's the best you can do,
but you've got one eye open and then 

886
00:40:38,741 --> 00:40:40,810
every time they do something good you 
don't want to notice.

887
00:40:40,811 --> 00:40:42,880
Because if that elevated them a little 
bit,

888
00:40:42,881 --> 00:40:43,714
you wouldn't be able to feel so 
resentful and miserable and keep your 

889
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:49,270
eye open for the next possible affair.
And that is what people are like.

890
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,300
That is what people are like.
And that's what you're like too.

891
00:40:52,301 --> 00:40:53,134
That's what people are like.
So you've got to decide if that's what 

892
00:40:55,301 --> 00:40:59,380
you want or you want to help the person 
that you're with grow,

893
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,030
you know that's dangerous because they 
might know shine you well good.

894
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,100
Then you'll have someone to compare 
yourself to.

895
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,480
That'd be a good deal.

896
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,980
It's really rough with kids,
you know,

897
00:41:08,981 --> 00:41:12,610
because parents will stop their children
from succeeding beyond them.

898
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,013
They get jealous and then they'll put 
them down and then they have kids that 

899
00:41:17,891 --> 00:41:18,724
do not like them and they'll pay for it.
So one of the things that I've figured 

900
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,380
out over the last years is this is a 
good proposition.

901
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:30,430
So you know,
it's pretty self evident that life is,

902
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:33,100
has got its rat's nest of miseries and 
that's for sure.

903
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,023
Maybe you could even make a categorical 
statement that life is mostly a rat's 

904
00:41:36,741 --> 00:41:38,120
nest of misery.
You know?

905
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,160
And you could make a pretty powerful 
argument for that.

906
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:42,980
But then there's a counter question,
which is,

907
00:41:42,981 --> 00:41:43,814
well,
what if you tried not to make it any 

908
00:41:44,571 --> 00:41:47,060
more miserable than it had to be?
Right?

909
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,490
Then what?
Then what would it be like?

910
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,790
And my suspicions are,
is that a lot of that misery,

911
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,713
I would suspect that most of that misery
would go away because it's the 

912
00:41:56,121 --> 00:41:58,430
unnecessary misery that really brings 
you down.

913
00:41:58,430 --> 00:41:59,263
You know?
It's like,

914
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,680
well,
someone has cancer.

915
00:42:00,681 --> 00:42:01,790
It's like,
that sucks.

916
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:06,080
But it's not like,
it's not like you can say,

917
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:10,640
if only we had done this differently 
than that wouldn't have happened.

918
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:14,060
But when someone's out,
like torturing you in a malevolent way,

919
00:42:14,061 --> 00:42:16,250
or maybe you're doing the same,
you can always ask yourself,

920
00:42:16,251 --> 00:42:18,410
was it really,
is this really necessary?

921
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:22,040
Is this just like a useless add on to 
the miseries of life?

922
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:25,190
That's what disheartens people.
And so even in your own life,

923
00:42:25,191 --> 00:42:26,450
if,
if you,

924
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:29,590
if,
if you aren't suffering from selfimposed

925
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:33,560
misery and you're only suffering from an
escapable misery,

926
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:36,020
maybe you could handle that and you know
who you could,

927
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,420
you could survive.
You could bear it.

928
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,140
And even maybe without becoming 
irredeemably corrupt.

929
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:43,520
And so the goal would be,
well,

930
00:42:43,521 --> 00:42:45,590
yeah,
life is a rat's nest of miseries.

931
00:42:45,591 --> 00:42:47,510
And maybe it has no ultimate meaning.

932
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:50,570
We could say that if we're feeling 
particularly pessimistic,

933
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,910
but it still leaves one question open,
which is,

934
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:55,310
if you didn't do everything you could to
make it worse,

935
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:59,720
how good could you make it be?
And the least answer is,

936
00:42:59,721 --> 00:43:00,230
well,
it,

937
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:02,780
it could be tragedy,
but maybe not hell.

938
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,020
And I think that's right.
I really believe that that's,

939
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,240
that's the most pessimistic proper 
statement.

940
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:09,283
The worst case outcome in the worst of 
all possible worlds is that your life 

941
00:43:12,501 --> 00:43:14,300
could be tragic,
but not hell.

942
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,850
And that's blood better than hell,
right?

943
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:17,743
It's,
it's,

944
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,820
and you think I could give you an 
example of the difference.

945
00:43:19,821 --> 00:43:21,990
You're at your mother's death bed.
Well,

946
00:43:21,991 --> 00:43:24,740
that's tragedy.
Here's another scenario.

947
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,020
You're out of your mother's death bed 
and all you,

948
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:29,480
you and all your idiot siblings are 
arguing.

949
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,393
Well that's the difference between 
tragedy and hell and you might be able 

950
00:43:33,741 --> 00:43:34,574
to tolerate the first circumstance and 
maybe it would even bring you closer 

951
00:43:36,651 --> 00:43:38,060
together with your family members.

952
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,133
The second one,
no one can bear that you walk away from 

953
00:43:41,811 --> 00:43:42,644
a situation like that,
sick of yourself and sick of everything 

954
00:43:45,111 --> 00:43:46,400
else too.
And you know,

955
00:43:46,401 --> 00:43:47,234
it's often the case that tragic 
circumstances bring out the dragons 

956
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:54,770
because the stress is high and all those
things that people haven't dealt with,

957
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:58,060
they don't have the energy to repress 
and,

958
00:43:58,061 --> 00:44:00,260
and all the bitterness comes pouring 
forward.

959
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:03,160
It's like seriously man,
it is.

960
00:44:03,161 --> 00:44:05,420
So that's actually a good,
it's a rough lesson,

961
00:44:05,421 --> 00:44:07,940
but it's a good hallmark for figuring 
out whether or not you're,

962
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:12,590
you've got yourself adjusted properly 
and in relationship to your siblings.

963
00:44:12,591 --> 00:44:15,380
It's like if you are all gathered around
the bed,

964
00:44:15,381 --> 00:44:18,680
if someone close who was dying,
could you manage it?

965
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,020
If the answer is no,
it's like,

966
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,033
well,
put your life together because it's 

967
00:44:22,881 --> 00:44:26,930
going to happen and you should be the 
person who's there that can do it and do

968
00:44:26,931 --> 00:44:27,764
it properly.
And then maybe you'd find that it isn't 

969
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:33,150
the sort of thing that will undermine 
your faith in life itself.

970
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,120
And I've seen,
I've seen both of those situations,

971
00:44:36,121 --> 00:44:37,080
you know,
ugly,

972
00:44:37,081 --> 00:44:38,790
ugly,
ugly situations,

973
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,333
murderously ugly situations.
And then they're opposite where people 

974
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:47,880
have had terrible things happen and to 
happen to them as a family and you know,

975
00:44:47,881 --> 00:44:48,714
they pulled together and
they rebuild their damn ship and they 

976
00:44:52,051 --> 00:44:52,884
sail away.
And so that seems to me to be a lot 

977
00:44:54,961 --> 00:44:55,794
better.

978
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:57,520
Okay.

979
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,560
That makes you noah when the flood 
comes.

980
00:44:59,561 --> 00:45:00,750
Right?
Well,

981
00:45:00,751 --> 00:45:01,990
okay,
so the same thing.

982
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,280
Yes.
The question emerges,

983
00:45:03,281 --> 00:45:04,120
well,
who are you?

984
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:05,020
Well,
you could say

985
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,600
you're this plan.

986
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,210
Yeah.

987
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:12,180
That's what people usually,
that's how people usually identify.

988
00:45:12,181 --> 00:45:14,490
Maybe they have no plan at all and 
they're just in chaos.

989
00:45:14,491 --> 00:45:15,324
Right?
That's like being in the belly of the 

990
00:45:16,711 --> 00:45:18,420
beast.
They're nihilistic and chaos.

991
00:45:18,421 --> 00:45:20,760
They have no plan.
They're just chaos itself.

992
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:23,160
And that's a very dreadful situation for
people to be in.

993
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,910
Or maybe they conjured together a plan.
That's their identity.

994
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:29,100
It's kind of fragile and they're holding
onto that with,

995
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:29,963
with everything they've got,
it's their little sticker would that 

996
00:45:31,411 --> 00:45:33,480
they're floating in the ocean clinging 
to,

997
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:34,823
you know,
and so they're identifying really hard 

998
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:38,370
with that plan.
That's what happens when you're an idiot

999
00:45:38,371 --> 00:45:41,190
log is that you're identifying really 
hard with that plan.

1000
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:44,210
The problem is something comes up to 
confront it.

1001
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:45,540
Well,
how do you act?

1002
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:46,493
Well,
you can't let go with a plan cause you 

1003
00:45:47,671 --> 00:45:48,504
drown.

1004
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:49,110
Okay?

1005
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:50,640
Then you cling to it rigidly.
Well,

1006
00:45:50,641 --> 00:45:52,590
that's no good because then you can't 
learn anything.

1007
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,290
Then if that's you,
you're a totalitarian,

1008
00:45:55,291 --> 00:45:56,124
you're not going to learn anything.
You're going to end up in something 

1009
00:45:58,141 --> 00:45:58,974
that's close enough to hell so that you 
won't know the difference and you might 

1010
00:46:00,721 --> 00:46:03,480
drag everyone along with you.
And that's happened plenty of times,

1011
00:46:03,481 --> 00:46:04,314
right?
It's the whole story of the 20th 

1012
00:46:05,131 --> 00:46:06,840
century.
It happened over and over and over,

1013
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:07,943
and it happens in people's states.
It's to happens in their business 

1014
00:46:11,521 --> 00:46:13,530
organizations.
It happens in their cities.

1015
00:46:13,531 --> 00:46:16,320
It happens in their provinces,
it happens in their states,

1016
00:46:16,321 --> 00:46:19,620
and it happens in their psyches all at 
the same time.

1017
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:21,173
You can't blame the manifestation of 
that sort of thing on any of those one 

1018
00:46:24,421 --> 00:46:27,420
levels.
It happens when a society goes down that

1019
00:46:27,421 --> 00:46:28,254
way,
it goes down everywhere at the same 

1020
00:46:29,461 --> 00:46:29,700
time.

1021
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:30,533
It's not the totalitarians at the top 
and all the happy people striving to be 

1022
00:46:33,631 --> 00:46:35,760
free at the bottom.
It's not that at all.

1023
00:46:35,761 --> 00:46:38,490
It's totalitarianism at every single 
level of the hierarchy,

1024
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:41,850
including the psychological.
And so you don't want to be the thing.

1025
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,620
You don't want to be in chaos,
that's for sure.

1026
00:46:43,621 --> 00:46:44,454
But you don't want to be the thing that 
clings so desperately to the raft that 

1027
00:46:47,431 --> 00:46:50,400
you can't let go when someone comes to 
rescue you.

1028
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:52,110
Right?
You don't want to be that.

1029
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:53,880
So then you think,
well,

1030
00:46:53,881 --> 00:46:56,490
exactly what are you?
You're not the chaos.

1031
00:46:56,491 --> 00:46:57,324
You're not the plan.
Maybe you're the thing that confronts 

1032
00:47:00,521 --> 00:47:01,354
the obstacle.

1033
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:02,340
Okay.

1034
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:04,500
And I would say that's the categorical 
lesson of

1035
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:05,860
okay.

1036
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:10,180
Of psychology in so far as it has to do 
with personal transformation,

1037
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,460
because that's what you always teach 
people in psychotherapy.

1038
00:47:12,461 --> 00:47:14,080
I don't care what sort of 
psychotherapist you are,

1039
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,550
you're always teaching them the same 
thing.

1040
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:19,570
You're the thing that you're not,
you're not the plan.

1041
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,180
You're the thing that can confront the 
obstacle to the plant.

1042
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:26,020
And then when you know even further that
the obstacle is not only an obstacle but

1043
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:29,080
opportunity itself,
well then your whole view,

1044
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,760
the world can change because you might 
think,

1045
00:47:30,761 --> 00:47:31,660
well,
I've got this plan.

1046
00:47:31,661 --> 00:47:32,494
Something came up to object to it.
It's like it's possible that the thing 

1047
00:47:36,131 --> 00:47:36,964
that's objecting has something to teach 
you that will take you to the place 

1048
00:47:39,251 --> 00:47:43,000
where you develop an even better plat 
and it's a nice framework to use.

1049
00:47:43,001 --> 00:47:45,310
It's like,
are you so sure that this is a problem?

1050
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,800
Is that the only way that you can look 
at it?

1051
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:50,140
Or is it an opportunity?
I mean,

1052
00:47:50,141 --> 00:47:51,220
I'm not trying to be,
you know,

1053
00:47:51,221 --> 00:47:54,460
naively optimistic.
There are some things that's pretty hard

1054
00:47:54,461 --> 00:47:55,294
to extract gold from some dragons and 
maybe the death of a family member is a 

1055
00:47:57,971 --> 00:48:00,870
good example of that.
But in even in a situation like that,

1056
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,370
I can tell you that it's an opportunity 
for,

1057
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:06,640
it's an opportunity for maturation,
that's for sure.

1058
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:08,740
And the thing is,
you might say,

1059
00:48:08,741 --> 00:48:09,574
well,
it's pretty miserable to go to be 

1060
00:48:11,111 --> 00:48:13,660
digging for gold when someone's falling 
into the grave.

1061
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,100
Well,
if they really love you,

1062
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:16,990
first of all,
that's what they'll want you to do.

1063
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:18,183
And second,
you're going to make their death a lot 

1064
00:48:19,061 --> 00:48:22,720
more palatable experience for them.
If you're someone who can be in the room

1065
00:48:22,721 --> 00:48:24,330
and be helpful instead of being,
you know,

1066
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,173
quivering in the corner and feeling that
the entire world is collapsing in on 

1067
00:48:27,611 --> 00:48:28,361
you,
I mean,

1068
00:48:28,361 --> 00:48:29,194
that's another,
you want to be the useful person at the 

1069
00:48:30,971 --> 00:48:31,804
funeral.

1070
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:34,570
How's that for a goal?
That's a good goal,

1071
00:48:34,571 --> 00:48:35,404
man.
You know that you've got yourself 

1072
00:48:36,671 --> 00:48:37,504
together in a situation like that 
because you're going to be at them and 

1073
00:48:40,091 --> 00:48:43,540
maybe you want to be the person on whose
shoulder people cry.

1074
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:45,730
That'd be a good goal.
And it's Kinda,

1075
00:48:45,731 --> 00:48:48,220
you know,
I don't like being naively optimistic.

1076
00:48:48,221 --> 00:48:49,810
So when I tell you to get your life 
together,

1077
00:48:49,811 --> 00:48:53,790
I'm not going to say roses and sunshine.
It's like that's,

1078
00:48:53,791 --> 00:48:54,624
that's,
that's,

1079
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:55,493
that's Pablum for fools.
But it really is something to be the 

1080
00:48:59,141 --> 00:49:01,780
reliable person at a funeral.
Right.

1081
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:05,950
And you can aim it that you can do that.
You gotta be tough to do that because it

1082
00:49:05,951 --> 00:49:06,784
also means that you can sustain a major 
loss without collapsing and that you've 

1083
00:49:12,101 --> 00:49:13,810
got to be a monster to do that.
Right.

1084
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:15,730
Because you might think,
and I've had clients like this,

1085
00:49:15,731 --> 00:49:18,940
well,
I love my child.

1086
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:23,140
I love my mother so much that I couldn't
survive if anything happened to them.

1087
00:49:23,141 --> 00:49:27,460
It's like you have some serious thinking
to do about that.

1088
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,580
It's like you really want to curse 
someone with that kind of love.

1089
00:49:30,581 --> 00:49:32,650
Do you,
I couldn't live without you.

1090
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:36,160
It's like my God,
get away from me.

1091
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,620
Really.
It's terrible.

1092
00:49:38,621 --> 00:49:39,940
That's the depaul mother,
right?

1093
00:49:39,941 --> 00:49:43,300
That's like,
I'll forgive you no matter what you do.

1094
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:48,360
It's like really no matter what I do a,
you are not my friend.

1095
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,830
That's for sure.
Not at all.

1096
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:53,380
It's a horrible thing to do to someone 
that's,

1097
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:57,130
that's the witch in Hansel and Gretel 
story,

1098
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:01,660
all gingerbread and outside to the last 
kid inside.

1099
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,960
You feed them candy and make them fat 
and eat them.

1100
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:06,970
Right.
That's Hansel and Gretel.

1101
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:07,863
That's the oedipal mother.
That's one of Freud's major discoveries 

1102
00:50:10,271 --> 00:50:14,500
if gets a major discovery.
It's like the devouring force of love.

1103
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:15,933
You want the person to be able to stand 
on their own and the price you pay for 

1104
00:50:18,041 --> 00:50:22,510
that is that you stand on your own.
It's like good to have you around.

1105
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,370
Glad you're here.
But if,

1106
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,233
if,
if tragedies when and if and when 

1107
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,160
tragedy strikes either

1108
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:28,993
of us,
I hope that one of us is standing when 

1109
00:50:30,711 --> 00:50:34,440
it blows past and,
and that there's a harshness about that.

1110
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,380
It's unbelievably cruel cause you know,
you say,

1111
00:50:36,381 --> 00:50:39,590
well if my mother died I could live 
well,

1112
00:50:39,591 --> 00:50:40,424
what kind of monster are you exactly.
You need the death of your mother 

1113
00:50:42,621 --> 00:50:44,540
doesn't do you in.
Well,

1114
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:46,460
it turns out that being a monster is the
right thing.

1115
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:50,240
So,
and that's a rough thing to learn,

1116
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:53,360
but it's necessary to learn,
you know,

1117
00:50:53,361 --> 00:50:54,620
cause it also makes you,
you know,

1118
00:50:54,621 --> 00:50:55,880
at some point,
for example,

1119
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,073
as you get older,
by the time you were in your mid 

1120
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:00,913
twenties something like that,
you should start having a relationship 

1121
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:07,670
with your parents.
That's approximately one of peers.

1122
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:11,180
And you can tell if you have that.
So here's a little trick you can use.

1123
00:51:11,181 --> 00:51:14,390
So you have parents,
obviously they have friends,

1124
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:15,980
you probably care what your parents 
think.

1125
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:17,023
I would imagine,
do you care what their friends think of 

1126
00:51:18,531 --> 00:51:20,360
you?
And answer to that is,

1127
00:51:20,361 --> 00:51:21,560
well,
not nearly as much.

1128
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:22,423
And so then I would say,
well why do you care what your parents 

1129
00:51:23,601 --> 00:51:26,180
think of you?
Then there are the same people.

1130
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:27,493
Do you know what I mean?
It's just luck of the draw that your 

1131
00:51:29,451 --> 00:51:31,670
parents or someone else's kids,
friends,

1132
00:51:32,870 --> 00:51:34,610
they don't think the same way about them
that you do.

1133
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:36,620
That's where you see that you have a 
projection,

1134
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:38,203
right?
If by the time you're 30 if what your 

1135
00:51:39,111 --> 00:51:41,180
parents think of you matters more than 
what,

1136
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:43,730
say a random set of their friends.
Think of you,

1137
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
then you've still got your parents 
confused with with God.

1138
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:47,893
That's one way of looking at it.
You've still got them confused with an 

1139
00:51:50,211 --> 00:51:53,180
archetype and you're still a child and 
you might think,

1140
00:51:53,181 --> 00:51:54,740
well,
it's pretty damn rude not to think about

1141
00:51:54,741 --> 00:51:56,720
what your parents think of you anymore,
not to care.

1142
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:57,681
It's like,
yeah,

1143
00:51:57,681 --> 00:52:00,080
it's kind of rude,
but maybe you'll be useful for them when

1144
00:52:00,081 --> 00:52:03,740
they get old and that's a much better 
form of caring.

1145
00:52:03,741 --> 00:52:04,574
It's like you're going to be independent
enough and strong enough and and 

1146
00:52:07,221 --> 00:52:10,220
detached enough so that when the top,
when the,

1147
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,100
when the power dynamic shifts,
which it will,

1148
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,593
that you'll be the person that can carry
things forward while you can't do a 

1149
00:52:18,081 --> 00:52:20,060
better thing for them than that,
right?

1150
00:52:20,061 --> 00:52:22,670
That's the best of all possible outcomes
for your parents.

1151
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:34,020
Well,
you can think about the world this way.

1152
00:52:34,021 --> 00:52:34,854
You can think about it as you're orderly
little plan that's a place and you can 

1153
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:41,400
think about it as the place that things 
that disrupt your plan comes from.

1154
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:46,080
That's another place.
This is a bigger place than this because

1155
00:52:46,081 --> 00:52:46,914
there's an endless number of things that
can disrupt your plan and only a tiny 

1156
00:52:49,831 --> 00:52:51,660
number of them that can,
you know,

1157
00:52:51,661 --> 00:52:55,140
that will help you work it out.
So part of the question then too is like

1158
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,393
are you the friend of your plan or are 
you the friend of the thing that 

1159
00:52:58,801 --> 00:52:59,634
disrupts your plan?
And I would say you should work to 

1160
00:53:01,921 --> 00:53:05,310
become the friend of the thing that 
disrupts your plan because there's a lot

1161
00:53:05,311 --> 00:53:08,460
of that.
And then if you become the friend of the

1162
00:53:08,461 --> 00:53:11,270
thing that disrupts your plan,
then you be,

1163
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:13,710
you start to develop strengths in 
proportion to the,

1164
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,650
to the disruptive force.
And that's really what you want.

1165
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,480
You want to be able to implement your 
plan obviously,

1166
00:53:18,481 --> 00:53:19,314
but you want to be able to take on the 
consequences of error and learn from it 

1167
00:53:25,110 --> 00:53:26,220
then.
Then you win

1168
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,620
constantly because even if something 
goes sideways,

1169
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:31,590
you think there's something to be 
derived from this.

1170
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:37,190
That's wisdom fundamentally so and so.
Those are the eternal domains,

1171
00:53:37,741 --> 00:53:38,574
right?
There's the domain of order that's a 

1172
00:53:40,741 --> 00:53:41,574
snake by the way,
and that's a domain of chaos and that's 

1173
00:53:44,551 --> 00:53:45,384
the world.
And maybe you're in the order and maybe 

1174
00:53:48,301 --> 00:53:49,134
you're in the chaos,
but those can flip on you and maybe you 

1175
00:53:51,031 --> 00:53:53,820
shouldn't be in either of those places.
Maybe you should be right in the middle

1176
00:53:55,550 --> 00:53:57,710
and that's where you should be.
As far as I can tell,

1177
00:53:57,711 --> 00:53:58,544
and I think this is,
this is another escape from postmodern 

1178
00:54:01,311 --> 00:54:03,980
nihilism,
let's say that's actually a real place.

1179
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:08,090
It's not metaphysical or maybe it is,
but it's metaphysical.

1180
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,790
If metaphysics is more real than 
physics,

1181
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:11,803
and you can tell when you're at that 
place because that's a maximally 

1182
00:54:13,551 --> 00:54:16,820
meaningful place and you drift in and 
out of it all the time in your life,

1183
00:54:16,821 --> 00:54:19,730
and when things are really bad for you,
you're not there hardly at all,

1184
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,560
right?
Because everything's overwhelming.

1185
00:54:21,561 --> 00:54:22,394
Your or things have become sterile.
But if you watch your life even over a 

1186
00:54:26,271 --> 00:54:27,104
week or two,
you'll see that now and then you're 

1187
00:54:28,071 --> 00:54:29,600
there.
Thank you.

1188
00:54:29,601 --> 00:54:31,220
Stand up straighter,
right?

1189
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:33,830
Cause you're in the right place at the 
right time and you think,

1190
00:54:33,831 --> 00:54:34,664
Aha,
I've got the forces of chaos and order 

1191
00:54:36,471 --> 00:54:37,460
properly balanced.

1192
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:40,040
It's unstable and it'll fall apart on 
you.

1193
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:40,903
But you know,
you can practice bringing things 

1194
00:54:42,861 --> 00:54:43,694
together continually and then you can 
end up so that you're there more often 

1195
00:54:46,671 --> 00:54:48,620
than not.
And then that's,

1196
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,530
that's a metta place.
It's not a place,

1197
00:54:51,531 --> 00:54:56,110
it's a metta place and it's a place that
you can be in all places and,

1198
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,570
and it's not an illusion of any sort.
It's the deepest reality.

1199
00:54:59,571 --> 00:55:01,670
Your nervous system is always orienting 
yourself.

1200
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:05,120
Your is always orienting you to that 
place always.

1201
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,970
And,
and that's because it's a real place.

1202
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:12,140
That's another way of thinking about it.
Well that's the normal world

1203
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,110
with,
that's the garden with the snake in it.

1204
00:55:16,111 --> 00:55:16,944
And that's chaos.
That's the chaos that arises when your 

1205
00:55:18,871 --> 00:55:19,980
plans collapse.
Right?

1206
00:55:19,981 --> 00:55:20,814
That's the world and the underworld.
And so the underworld is always there 

1207
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:23,694
and it's lurking beneath everything.
It's like the figure of the shark and 

1208
00:55:26,101 --> 00:55:26,934
the jaws poster right there.
You are swinging at the top and there's 

1209
00:55:29,761 --> 00:55:32,640
that terrible thing underneath that can 
come up and pull you down.

1210
00:55:32,850 --> 00:55:33,683
That's the world.
So you need to be able to operate here 

1211
00:55:36,331 --> 00:55:39,150
and you need to be able to operate here.
And when you operate here,

1212
00:55:39,151 --> 00:55:42,840
well that's when you rescue your father 
from the belly of the whale.

1213
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:44,723
That's when you go down.
You see when you're down in chaos and 

1214
00:55:46,291 --> 00:55:47,580
you don't know what the hell is going 
on.

1215
00:55:47,581 --> 00:55:49,740
You have to rediscover the values that 
Orient.

1216
00:55:49,741 --> 00:55:52,860
People have oriented people forever.
That's what you have to discover.

1217
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,113
So for example,
when I'm dealing with people who have 

1218
00:55:55,141 --> 00:55:55,974
posttraumatic stress disorder and 
they've usually encountered someone 

1219
00:55:58,111 --> 00:55:58,944
malevolent,
they have to relearn the description of 

1220
00:56:01,201 --> 00:56:04,410
good and evil because if they don't,
they'd have no framework.

1221
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:06,180
They're lost.
They think,

1222
00:56:06,181 --> 00:56:07,014
well,
there's a malevolence afoot in the 

1223
00:56:08,101 --> 00:56:10,200
world,
and I'm a naive,

1224
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:13,890
I'm a naive,
I'm a prey animal,

1225
00:56:13,891 --> 00:56:16,320
a naive prey animal for the malevolence 
of the world.

1226
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:16,861
It's like,
well,

1227
00:56:16,861 --> 00:56:19,020
good luck functioning under that set of 
assumptions,

1228
00:56:19,021 --> 00:56:21,300
man.
You just do not recover from that.

1229
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:24,310
You stay at home in your borough.
That's what you do.

1230
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:25,661
Well,
you have to,

1231
00:56:25,661 --> 00:56:27,010
you go down into that,
you think,

1232
00:56:27,011 --> 00:56:29,530
okay,
well malevolence is afoot.

1233
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:32,680
I better be the sort of person that can 
understand it and deal with it.

1234
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:36,700
And that's another reason why you have 
to transform yourself into a monster.

1235
00:56:36,701 --> 00:56:40,150
That's the young Ian Incorporation of 
the shadow.

1236
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:40,983
It's no bloody joke because the only 
thing that a monster won't mess with is 

1237
00:56:45,341 --> 00:56:46,660
another monster.
And you might say,

1238
00:56:46,661 --> 00:56:47,494
well,
I don't want to transfer myself into a 

1239
00:56:48,341 --> 00:56:50,080
monster.
It's like you don't have a choice.

1240
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:54,970
You can either be a pathetic monster or 
you can be a monster with some power.

1241
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:58,210
Those are your options.
There's no non monster alternative,

1242
00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:59,253
weak or strong.
And I don't mean strong like dominating 

1243
00:57:02,201 --> 00:57:04,390
tyrant strength.
That isn't what I mean at all.

1244
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:05,373
I mean strength like functioning at a 
funeral strength and that's a kind of 

1245
00:57:09,431 --> 00:57:11,710
monstrosity.
And when you're down in chaos,

1246
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:16,740
that's what you have to rediscover.
Well that's partly what that means.

1247
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:18,763
You're lucky if you come back out.
You remember I told you the story of 

1248
00:57:20,801 --> 00:57:21,634
Jonah at the beginning of the course.
So like he had something to do and was 

1249
00:57:24,551 --> 00:57:28,360
refusing to do it,
and so God pulled him down to the depths

1250
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:30,940
of being and threatened him with death,
but worse,

1251
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:32,950
not just death.
Hell really?

1252
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,400
Well,
he decided it was better to come popping

1253
00:57:36,401 --> 00:57:38,980
up back into the light and go do what he
was supposed to do.

1254
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:40,203
Well,
there's a reason that that like that's 

1255
00:57:45,521 --> 00:57:46,354
the oldest story of mankind.
Do you as far back as you go into the 

1256
00:57:48,941 --> 00:57:51,850
archives of history,
you find this story right?

1257
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,343
And it's because,

1258
00:57:56,770 --> 00:57:59,140
well,
it's because not only is it because it's

1259
00:57:59,141 --> 00:57:59,974
true,
it's because it's true and everyone 

1260
00:58:01,151 --> 00:58:03,160
knows it's true.
Even though they don't know that.

1261
00:58:03,161 --> 00:58:06,220
They know that this is the story too.
It's the same thing.

1262
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,580
There's always a city.
It's always enclosed,

1263
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:13,480
right?
There's always people who inhabit it.

1264
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:17,590
There's always someone who's willing to 
notice that the dragon hasn't gone away,

1265
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:18,703
is skulls are still around.
There's someone who's willing to come 

1266
00:58:20,621 --> 00:58:23,920
out of the fortress and,
and take that on.

1267
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,083
Right.
And to prefer perform the job of 

1268
00:58:26,621 --> 00:58:28,960
rescuing.
That's an eternal story.

1269
00:58:29,170 --> 00:58:31,690
Are you the city?
Are You the Dragon?

1270
00:58:31,691 --> 00:58:32,530
Are you the thing that

1271
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:33,720
okay,

1272
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:38,720
engages voluntarily in combat with what 
lies outside your range of safety?

1273
00:58:39,521 --> 00:58:44,050
Cause that's what that image represents.
It's that is the monster amalgam,

1274
00:58:44,051 --> 00:58:48,250
symbolic amalgam of all that which lies 
outside your realm of safety.

1275
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:50,680
You want to be safe.
Forget that,

1276
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,240
right?
That is,

1277
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:53,980
that's not,
that's not in the cards.

1278
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:57,690
You're not going to be safe while then 
you have to be medisafe.

1279
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:01,090
And that's way better because then 
you're not safe.

1280
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:03,760
But you know how to cope with danger 
while fine,

1281
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:05,583
that solves the problem.
And maybe it's even a better solution 

1282
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:11,110
because if you're safe then you just 
have to stay in your burrow.

1283
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,213
But if you can confront danger,
then you could go wherever you want and 

1284
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:15,634
you can have an adventure.
And maybe that's what you need to do is 

1285
00:59:18,011 --> 00:59:20,590
to go out and have an adventure.
So you don't even want safety.

1286
00:59:20,830 --> 00:59:22,340
Cause how exciting is that?

1287
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:27,500
Not Dostoyevsky said very clearly would 
say we made you perfectly safe.

1288
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:28,573
All that you had to do was eat cakes and
worry yourself with the continuation of 

1289
00:59:31,461 --> 00:59:33,530
the species.
What would you do?

1290
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:37,010
You'd smash it all down as soon as you 
possibly could,

1291
00:59:37,011 --> 00:59:40,010
just so you had something interesting 
and challenging to do.

1292
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:43,460
So you don't want safety.
You want to be able to cope with danger.

1293
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:46,010
That's a whole different thing.
And I'm like,

1294
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:47,090
this isn't,
again,

1295
00:59:47,091 --> 00:59:49,970
metaphysical that did clinical data on 
this as clear.

1296
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:52,550
When you treat someone for an anxiety 
disorder,

1297
00:59:52,551 --> 00:59:56,030
like agora phobia,
you do not get rid of their anxiety.

1298
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,790
You make them braver.
That's way better.

1299
00:59:58,791 --> 01:00:01,130
There's no going back.
Like once you're agoraphobic,

1300
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,740
you're heart's not doing the,
you know,

1301
01:00:03,741 --> 01:00:04,161
it's,
it's,

1302
01:00:04,161 --> 01:00:06,440
it's missing beats now in that,
and it's like death.

1303
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:07,483
Like the crocodile,
it's got the clock and it's in his 

1304
01:00:09,171 --> 01:00:10,940
stomach.
It death is after you.

1305
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:13,520
There's no,
there's no going back to naive it.

1306
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:16,370
You don't get to be safe ever again.
Well,

1307
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:18,650
so what happens?
You get to be stronger.

1308
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:19,730
Well,
Hey,

1309
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:21,470
it turns out that's a better bargain 
anyways.

1310
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:25,450
Okay.

1311
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:26,283
Lynn Isbell,
an evolutionary arms race between early 

1312
01:00:29,021 --> 01:00:32,740
snakes and mammals triggered the 
development of improved vision and large

1313
01:00:32,741 --> 01:00:33,574
brain in primates.
A radical new theory suggests the idea 

1314
01:00:36,851 --> 01:00:37,684
proposed by Lynne Isbell,
an anthropologist at the University of 

1315
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:40,594
California suggest that snakes and 
primates share along an intimate 

1316
01:00:43,121 --> 01:00:43,954
history.
One that forced both groups to evolve 

1317
01:00:45,881 --> 01:00:48,850
new strategies as each attempted to gain
the upper hand.

1318
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:50,770
Now it's Hercules',
right?

1319
01:00:50,771 --> 01:00:51,760
Well,
that's infinity.

1320
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:53,320
That symbol,
and this is the snake.

1321
01:00:53,321 --> 01:00:55,180
You cut off one head and seven more 
grow.

1322
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,130
It's like the,
it's an infinite snake.

1323
01:00:57,131 --> 01:00:59,920
You're never going to run out of snakes.
Those are the things that object to your

1324
01:00:59,921 --> 01:01:01,330
plants.
Well,

1325
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:03,340
you can't get rid of the snake,
so what do you do?

1326
01:01:03,370 --> 01:01:04,930
You learn how to handle them,
right?

1327
01:01:05,110 --> 01:01:06,090
That's it.
That's,

1328
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:09,100
that's the answer is you learn how to 
become a handler of snakes,

1329
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:12,610
both physical and metaphysical.
See,

1330
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:17,110
you see the little halo around it.
I think that Saint George might be Saint

1331
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:18,160
Michael,
but I think it's St George.

1332
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:19,210
Why has he got a halo?
Well,

1333
01:01:19,211 --> 01:01:21,280
that's the sun,
or what does that mean?

1334
01:01:21,281 --> 01:01:24,820
It's gold to gold is pure.
It's the pure gold sun.

1335
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:25,713
It's associated with consciousness.
It's the pure gold sun of consciousness 

1336
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:31,600
that can confront the terrible thing 
that paralyzes.

1337
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:32,883
Yeah,

1338
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:35,750
and that's the same thing.
That's death,

1339
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:36,613
right?
The clock in the stomach of the 

1340
01:01:37,311 --> 01:01:38,144
crocodile,
it's already got a taste of captain 

1341
01:01:39,051 --> 01:01:40,790
hook.
Captain Hook's no St George.

1342
01:01:40,791 --> 01:01:42,770
That's why Peter Pan doesn't want to 
grow up.

1343
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:45,770
I'd always sees is Captain Hook.
I don't want to be Captain Hook.

1344
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:46,963
He doesn't see this.
So he stays at home and plays video 

1345
01:01:49,761 --> 01:01:51,410
games with the rest of the lost boys.

1346
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:55,480
Look,
I've got nothing against video games,

1347
01:01:55,481 --> 01:01:58,660
by the way.
I mean everything in moderation,

1348
01:01:58,661 --> 01:02:00,490
right?
And I mean they demand skill.

1349
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:02,170
Well,
so what's this?

1350
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:04,720
Do you know?
There you are and you go down into chaos

1351
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,370
and then you come back up.
And so you might say,

1352
01:02:06,371 --> 01:02:07,204
well,
am I this or am I the chaos or am I the 

1353
01:02:08,741 --> 01:02:09,574
new new solution?
And answer is you're not this or you 

1354
01:02:13,601 --> 01:02:15,820
shouldn't be because that's your old 
dead self,

1355
01:02:15,821 --> 01:02:16,654
right?
That's the thing that needs to burn 

1356
01:02:17,141 --> 01:02:19,360
away.
You're not chaos itself,

1357
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:22,770
but you're also not the new regenerated 
order.

1358
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:26,940
You're the thing that can make the 
journey and more than that,

1359
01:02:26,941 --> 01:02:27,774
you're the thing that decides to make 
the journey voluntarily and then more 

1360
01:02:31,321 --> 01:02:32,154
than that,
you're the thing that decides to make 

1361
01:02:33,691 --> 01:02:36,270
the journey voluntarily for as long as 
it takes.

1362
01:02:36,750 --> 01:02:38,490
And that's where you derive your 
strength.

1363
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,890
It's like there's no getting rid of 
chaos.

1364
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,410
It's eternal.
There's no getting rid of order.

1365
01:02:43,411 --> 01:02:46,260
It's eternal.
Those are both traps.

1366
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:47,513
You mediate between them and that's 
where your strength lies and that's not 

1367
01:02:50,161 --> 01:02:51,990
only strength for you,
it's strength for you,

1368
01:02:51,991 --> 01:02:52,824
it's strength for the people around you.
It's strength for the community as 

1369
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:56,064
strength for everything.
It's the thing that makes everything 

1370
01:02:58,171 --> 01:03:01,680
order itself properly and thrive.
You have to ask yourself,

1371
01:03:01,681 --> 01:03:04,410
and this is the thing you ask yourself,
this is the existential question.

1372
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:09,000
Do you want things to be ordered 
properly and thrive?

1373
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:10,163
Because if the answer to that is yes,
you have to give up your hatred of 

1374
01:03:12,721 --> 01:03:14,610
being,
you have to give up your resentment,

1375
01:03:14,611 --> 01:03:15,444
you have to give up your margin demond 
your victimization and all of that 

1376
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:19,980
because to the degree that you carry 
that forward,

1377
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:25,290
it will corrupt you and you will not 
want the best cause to be.

1378
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,700
If two want the best,
you have to be without rage,

1379
01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:30,920
hatred and Rand Corp and,
and resentment because in,

1380
01:03:30,921 --> 01:03:31,754
Oh,
if I resent you for your enigma 

1381
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:36,450
adequacies or even for your,
for your accomplishments,

1382
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:40,920
I'm not going to have a conversation 
with you where I'm aiming for the best.

1383
01:03:41,070 --> 01:03:42,600
I'm going to have all sorts of 
motivations.

1384
01:03:42,601 --> 01:03:44,280
I'm going to take you down somehow.
You know,

1385
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:47,160
especially if you're successful.
That's the Cain and Abel Story.

1386
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,200
It's like,
I bet I want to be who you are,

1387
01:03:49,201 --> 01:03:50,034
but I can't be.
So I'll just cut you off at the knees 

1388
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:53,213
and that'll do just fine and then I can 
get my revenge on you and I can get my 

1389
01:03:56,161 --> 01:03:58,080
revenge on being.
And you know,

1390
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:00,240
the fact that it helps turn everything 
into hell.

1391
01:04:00,241 --> 01:04:02,160
Well,
maybe that's just an additional benefit

1392
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:08,360
that's right.
Represented all sorts of different ways.

1393
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:14,650
The masculine and the Feminine Moon.
And that's horace in gold,

1394
01:04:15,050 --> 01:04:17,060
right?
Horus is all speech and eyes,

1395
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:17,631
and that's,
oh,

1396
01:04:17,631 --> 01:04:19,970
cyrus,
that God of tradition and Isis,

1397
01:04:19,971 --> 01:04:23,060
the queen of the underworld.
And you see the same thing here,

1398
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:28,690
suffering individual that transcends it 
by accepting it nested inside of society

1399
01:04:28,971 --> 01:04:29,804
and the patriarchal structure nested 
inside the natural world and the 

1400
01:04:32,061 --> 01:04:32,894
feminine.

1401
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,790
It's the same idea there.

1402
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:46,600
That's Buddha emerging from the lotus 
flower.

1403
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:51,100
The lotus flower,
its roots go down into the merch at the,

1404
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,410
at the bottom of the,
of the,

1405
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:54,363
of the pond.
So it emerges out of the darkness and 

1406
01:04:57,011 --> 01:04:57,844
manifest itself.
And then it climbs upwards towards the 

1407
01:05:00,401 --> 01:05:02,410
light.
And then the lotus floats on the surface

1408
01:05:02,411 --> 01:05:03,244
of the water in bloom's open.
And inside that the Buddha sits golden 

1409
01:05:06,791 --> 01:05:08,930
buddha sits in the light.
It's,

1410
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:10,980
it's the flowering of being.
And that's,

1411
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:13,030
that's a Mandela from the union 
perspective.

1412
01:05:13,031 --> 01:05:15,910
It's the Mendell opens up and it reveals
this motive.

1413
01:05:15,911 --> 01:05:17,620
Perfect big.
Uh,

1414
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:18,523
it's what the Buddha means.
And he found enlightenment underneath 

1415
01:05:20,201 --> 01:05:21,034
the tree because that's the human 
environment there is to find 

1416
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:27,490
enlightenment underneath the tree.
He's got the sun on his head too,

1417
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:31,390
and he's gold for the same reason.
Gold is pure.

1418
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:46,520
You see the same thing in Hinduism,
so that's the Yoni Feminine Symbol case.

1419
01:05:47,911 --> 01:05:52,350
You were wondering masculine symbol.
That's the union of the two,

1420
01:05:52,351 --> 01:05:54,900
right?
That's the union of chaos and order with

1421
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:55,753
the snake lurking in the background and 
it's golden because it's the union of 

1422
01:06:00,361 --> 01:06:03,240
those two things that produces the power
of the snake.

1423
01:06:03,241 --> 01:06:04,740
That's something that you might think 
about.

1424
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:07,890
You could think about those as two 
halves of the DNA molecule.

1425
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:09,390
They,
that is what they are.

1426
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:11,130
Although I can't tell you how I know 
that,

1427
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:16,740
but it's the same idea.
It's the same idea here.

1428
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:20,100
So this,
what happens here is that you see,

1429
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:22,440
this is a very remarkable pictures.
So this is eve.

1430
01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:25,860
Eve is handing out skulls to mankind,
right?

1431
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:28,470
It's self consciousness and the 
discovery of death.

1432
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:29,743
This is Mary as the church on this side,
and she's handing out these things that 

1433
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:33,354
are the hosts.

1434
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:34,423
It's,
those are pieces of Christ's body and 

1435
01:06:36,481 --> 01:06:38,760
see,
so he's put up there on this tree,

1436
01:06:38,761 --> 01:06:39,594
the same as the skull as an antidote.
The antidote is something that you 

1437
01:06:42,781 --> 01:06:43,614
incorporate and the thing you 
incorporate is the voluntary acceptance 

1438
01:06:46,051 --> 01:06:49,530
of suffering as the cure for death.
That's what that picture means.

1439
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:52,140
People worked on that bloody picture for
a long,

1440
01:06:52,290 --> 01:06:53,970
long,
long,

1441
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:57,090
long time.
And you know,

1442
01:06:57,091 --> 01:06:58,980
we see the picture,
but we don't know what it means.

1443
01:06:59,070 --> 01:07:01,980
But that's what it means.
It means the same thing that this means.

1444
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:07,260
It means the same thing that this means.
He's the same thing that this means.

1445
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:08,820
See,
there's,

1446
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:11,850
there's pride rock.
This is the Scandinavian world tree.

1447
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:15,840
There's pride rock right there.
There's the territory outside.

1448
01:07:15,841 --> 01:07:16,740
See,
it's a serpent.

1449
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:18,660
It's a snake.
That's the territory outside.

1450
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:21,960
That's outside of the light and that's 
all in a tree.

1451
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:23,453
That's how can you not read that as a 
history of the evolution of mankind and 

1452
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,490
it's exactly what it is.
That's our eternal home.

1453
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:40,743
Well,
we better stop before that girl comes 

1454
01:07:42,341 --> 01:07:43,174
in.

1455
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:46,023
Well,
it's very nice having you all in the 

1456
01:07:47,081 --> 01:07:47,914
class.
And I appreciated the warm welcome I go 

1457
01:07:49,661 --> 01:07:50,890
out,
especially in January,

1458
01:07:50,891 --> 01:07:51,724
because it was a rough time in January.
And so I'm glad this all worked out so 

1459
01:07:55,031 --> 01:07:56,530
well,
and it was a pleasure teaching you.

1460
01:07:56,531 --> 01:07:59,200
So good luck to you all.
I mean,

1461
01:07:59,201 --> 01:08:01,780
it be what you can be,
God,

1462
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:05,260
he let the world dissolve around you.
Otherwise that's not a good thing.

1463
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,720
You got something that everyone needs,
man,

1464
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:09,280
including yourself.
It's like,

1465
01:08:09,281 --> 01:08:11,830
let it out.
That's where everything you want is,

1466
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:13,083
and it's this,
it's the case for every single one of 

1467
01:08:14,441 --> 01:08:15,460
you.
So,

1468
01:08:15,461 --> 01:08:16,294
you know,
hoist up your God damn privilege and go 

1469
01:08:17,891 --> 01:08:20,350
out there and do something in the world 
to,

1470
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:20,840
yeah.

1471
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:25,610
[inaudible].
