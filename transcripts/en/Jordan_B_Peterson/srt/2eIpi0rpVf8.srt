1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,240
We are the Democrats
since 18,

2
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:08,074
28.
Our great party has played a major role 

3
00:00:10,361 --> 00:00:11,194
in participating in the political 
process that is produced what is 

4
00:00:13,991 --> 00:00:17,200
arguably the greatest republic the world
has ever seen.

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,173
We've produced generation after 
generation of leaders who despite their 

6
00:00:23,111 --> 00:00:23,944
faults,
have helped establish and maintain a 

7
00:00:25,721 --> 00:00:26,554
country that is served in the main,
has a beacon of light and hope to the 

8
00:00:29,921 --> 00:00:30,754
desperate masses of the world,
yearning in those immemorial words to 

9
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:35,440
breathe free

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,213
over those nearly 200 years.
We have all worked together despite our 

11
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:45,120
differences to produce a society we're 
desperate.

12
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:45,954
Want is a rarity.
We're hardworking men and women can 

13
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:49,194
produce a better future for themselves 
and their children and where the 

14
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:52,434
arbitrary disadvantages that have in the
past held so many of us back and 

15
00:00:56,311 --> 00:01:00,030
deprived others of our genuine talents 
have in good faith,

16
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:00,864
being continually reduced and minimized.
Nothing is perfect and neither is our 

17
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:10,380
country,
but we have built together a stable,

18
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,300
secure,
exciting,

19
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,253
dynamic community and can all in 
consequence look forward to an even 

20
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:18,630
better tomorrow.

21
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:24,410
But we as Democrats have faltered in our
duty in recent years.

22
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,753
We have allowed the discourse within our
ranks to become increasingly dominated 

23
00:01:29,271 --> 00:01:30,104
by a tiny,
well organized and disruptive minority 

24
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,853
who have insisted ever more stridently 
that our culture is a tyrannical 

25
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,970
destructive patriarchy and that we are 
not sovereign,

26
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:41,893
responsible individual citizens capable 
of negotiating a shared and prosperous 

27
00:01:46,911 --> 00:01:47,744
piece,
but oppressive or oppressed minority 

28
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:53,630
group members defined above all by our 
sex,

29
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,250
race,
ethnicity,

30
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,233
and sexual preference.
We have failed as well to oppose the 

31
00:01:59,841 --> 00:02:00,674
profoundly anti American claim.
That free speech is merely the means by 

32
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:05,324
which the powerful protect their 
interests and we have abandoned are 

33
00:02:08,601 --> 00:02:09,434
invaluable commitment to and contract 
with the American working class who 

34
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:13,874
toiled mightily and often under 
conditions of extreme deprivation to 

35
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:18,554
perform the backbreaking labor,
so necessary to the creation of our 

36
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:24,620
stellar country.
In doing so,

37
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:25,723
we betrayed and insulted our primary 
constituency and we squandered the 

38
00:02:29,571 --> 00:02:30,404
opportunity to elect the first woman to 
the position of the presidency of the 

39
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,533
United States.
Then instead of taking responsibility 

40
00:02:38,211 --> 00:02:39,044
for our well-deserved failure and loss,
we insisted upon vilifying those who 

41
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:47,720
defeated us appropriately and honestly 
in the honorable democratic process.

42
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,260
We're sorry,

43
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,320
we promised to return to the priorities 
that made our party great.

44
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:56,963
We promise to build and revitalize the 
vital infrastructure who's construction 

45
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:04,060
employees are tradespeople and whose use
is available to all.

46
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,493
We promise to insist that our schools 
and those who conduct the research upon 

47
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:11,850
which their methods are founded,
abandoned they're divisive,

48
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,380
videology,
and teach our children the knowledge and

49
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:16,840
skills necessary to make them 
respectable,

50
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,610
mature,
productive,

51
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,593
reliable citizens.
We promise and have already taken 

52
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:27,370
productive steps to reduce the 
inevitable corruption that tends to take

53
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:32,371
hold of even the greatest and most alert
of states where the Democrats,

54
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,813
we did not uphold our responsibility to 
the American people and were justly and 

55
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:42,070
properly sorry for that.
We promised to clean our house.

56
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,413
We promise to draw divisions between the
key and time honored principles that 

57
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:47,674
unite us all and the divisive identity 
politics that is threatening to reduce 

58
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:56,590
this to an ignoble squabbling and 
dangerously polarized tribalism

59
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:03,130
where the Democrats,
we hope you'll forgive us and we promise

60
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,280
by the sacred social compact defined by 
our unalienable individual rights to act

61
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:13,030
responsibly and carefully and do better 
together.

62
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,050
Long may our great country prosper.
