1
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,160
You're here
now.

2
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,800
How do I know that I'm actually live?
Hey guys.

3
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:18,801
Can you hear me?
Hi everyone.

4
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:33,510
Good to see you.
So I'm a little tired side tonight.

5
00:01:34,151 --> 00:01:38,260
So I'm going to start with a relatively 
straightforward question.

6
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:40,863
Somebody asked what's up with all the 
Lenin pictures in your house and then 

7
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:47,320
how is it to look at them every day?

8
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:54,000
Well,
about

9
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,133
in 2001 in a fit of collective insanity.
I decided to start seeing if I could 

10
00:02:04,421 --> 00:02:08,560
find Soviet era artifacts online.
Mostly through Ebay.

11
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:10,563
I had read a paper by James Pennebaker 
who claimed the past events start to 

12
00:02:15,341 --> 00:02:20,341
become historically significant about 15
years after the after the relevant event

13
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:25,360
and so 2001 was 15 years after the 
fault,

14
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,330
essentially after the fall of the Berlin
Wall or close enough.

15
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,183
And so I started looking on Ebay to see 
what sort of Soviet artifacts or might 

16
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,540
be able to find.
First of all,

17
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:38,374
I was kind of curious about what would 
be available for purchase and I also 

18
00:02:41,531 --> 00:02:45,480
thought it was deeply ironic that the 
most free market of,

19
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,810
of what would you call platforms ever 
devised,

20
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:53,811
which would be Ebay could now be used to
scavenge communist era artists,

21
00:02:54,581 --> 00:02:55,840
Alex from Russia,
you know,

22
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:00,550
it just seemed like to be someone who 
was during the Cold War,

23
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,780
the fact that,
that,

24
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,973
that I could buy things like heads of 
linen on Ebay was just too comical to 

25
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:08,380
not to pass up,
you know.

26
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,203
And so I started buying things that I 
had some familiarity with because of 

27
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:17,050
what I'd read historically.
And the first thing I bought was about a

28
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:17,884
three by five silk flag that was awarded
to a factory for meeting its five year 

29
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,523
production quota.
And I don't know what you know about 

30
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,830
those infamous quotas,
but what would happen is that there were

31
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:30,664
addictive sent down on high about how 
much factories were supposed to produce 

32
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,890
and the implied,
um,

33
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,690
what the implication was produced or 
else by any means necessary.

34
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,200
And so two things happened.
Three things happened.

35
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,140
The goods were often shawty because they
were rushed,

36
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,513
there was deception about how much was 
actually produced and then people were 

37
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:58,990
radically overworked and under supplied,
so it was a bad bad system,

38
00:03:58,991 --> 00:03:59,824
but it was very interesting to actually 
have one of these flags and see what 

39
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:06,070
they were like and then I bought a 
clock,

40
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,263
a stainless steel clock,
windup clock that was a submarine clock 

41
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:10,924
and it was bomb proof,
so I thought that would be handy if 

42
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,450
someone ever bombed my house and I 
needed to know what time it was.

43
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,703
So I bought that and then I found this 
painting that's actually off to my left 

44
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:25,420
here.
It's five Russian revolutionaries,

45
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:26,254
all young and quite stalwart looking,
standing on the edge of a cliff with a 

46
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,090
red soldier or a white soldier off to 
the side.

47
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,820
They're all shackled together and he's 
preparing to execute them.

48
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:37,654
That was a.
That was a fairly common Soviet motif 

49
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:47,281
and I'm on my right side.
I have a and a decorated Soviet war hero

50
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,903
who's working in a steel foundry and 
like a lot of the Soviet or glorified I 

51
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:57,550
suppose the working class.
And I suppose there's nothing wrong with

52
00:04:57,551 --> 00:04:58,384
that,
depending on the degree of 

53
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,810
propagandistic content and 
falsifications,

54
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,663
but
they're kind of like Norman Rockwell 

55
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:06,904
paintings,
except they don't have the same degree 

56
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:10,420
of sentimentality,
which is quite interesting.

57
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,360
And what's it like to have them around?
Well,

58
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:14,943
pretty much every square inch of my 
house is covered with paintings and a 

59
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,124
fair number of them are,
I don't suppose the sorts of paintings 

60
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:22,270
that people would usually have in their 
house.

61
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,103
There was,
some of them are of the Second World 

62
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,173
War.
Some of them are strongly political and 

63
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:30,730
uh,
but it's,

64
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,500
it's.
Well sometimes people say,

65
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,870
well,
I wouldn't want to live in a museum.

66
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:42,700
And I guess that isn't how I feel.
I actually like living in the museum.

67
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,890
And I liked having these historical 
artifacts,

68
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:49,891
so around and I really liked watching 
the propaganda and the art more in the,

69
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,213
in the paintings,
because many of these paintings were 

70
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:56,980
produced by very talented impressionist 
artists who were trained.

71
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,620
The classical European tradition.
They spent months making these paintings

72
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:05,240
and yet their subordinate in some sense 
to a political ideology.

73
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:06,074
But what's interesting is that as the 
political ideology recedes into the 

74
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:13,850
past,
the more purely artistic elements of the

75
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:14,684
paintings seem to remain.
And so it's cool to kind of watch it's 

76
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:19,364
very slow process.
But it's very interesting to watch the 

77
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:26,840
art itself emerged triumphant over the 
propaganda and then,

78
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,890
you know,
these things also reminded me of,

79
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:29,883
of what,
what I'm interested in and that's the 

80
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:34,574
study of videology and they reminded me 
how powerful ideology can be and how 

81
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:42,530
many different pathways that can take 
two to,

82
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,480
to control I suppose it.

83
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,750
And,
and it also reminds me of the reality of

84
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:51,010
the 20th century because it was a 
terrible reality.

85
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,440
And if we forget it then we weren't 
likely to repeat it.

86
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,443
Now my kids grew up in this house and I 
asked them about it because I suppose 

87
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,910
the paintings are fairly heavy and maybe
even somewhat frightening,

88
00:07:04,911 --> 00:07:08,760
but they really liked it and the people 
that I.

89
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,673
It gives me a reason to invite people 
into my house and gives me something to 

90
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:13,454
play with.
And,

91
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,463
and I,
I guess I need things to play with by 

92
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:22,430
all appearances.
So that's the story of the,

93
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,940
of the Soviet paintings.
So

94
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,253
please tell us about your ideas of the 
problem of gender integrated combat 

95
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:40,154
units and how it affects morale.
Please talk about the role trans people 

96
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:46,280
should or should not serve in combat 
units.

97
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,620
Huh?
Well,

98
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,360
you know,
I wouldn't say that I'm

99
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:55,110
exactly an expert in that regard.
Um,

100
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:02,100
I don't know how gender
power,

101
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:02,963
multiple gender combat units are going 
to work my because I'm fundamentally a 

102
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:07,844
traditionalist in most ways.
Mostly because I'm afraid of the 

103
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:13,790
unintended consequences of radical 
change.

104
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,223
I would say that it's dangerous to 
adjust a system that's working and it's 

105
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:19,634
very hard for me to imagine a situation,
especially in a combat situation where 

106
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,180
the women and men can actually be 
treated equally.

107
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,780
I don't think that the broader society 
would even want to see that.

108
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,780
I mean I suppose there are exceptions to
that sort of thing.

109
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:36,614
Like,
like,

110
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,860
um,
the situation perhaps in Israel,

111
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,360
although I suspect even in Israel that 
the women take the more,

112
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,010
the less combat heavy jobs now I don't 
know that but,

113
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,980
and maybe I'm just being prejudiced in 
that answer,

114
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:52,843
but

115
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,700
it just doesn't seem to me to be a very 
wise idea.

116
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,640
Um,
what role trans people should serve.

117
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,550
I really can't say I,
I don't have anything,

118
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,130
any advice about that.
I'm just not

119
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:15,910
informed enough to make
a conclusion about that.

120
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,430
I think it's very strange.
However,

121
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,043
I've talked to some people in the 
Canadian armed forces in recent months 

122
00:09:23,141 --> 00:09:23,974
and I do think it's very strange that 
this is the sort of problem that our 

123
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,320
military is actually trying to solve 
you.

124
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,653
You'd think that there would be more 
important things to concentrate on then 

125
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,440
rapid gender,
um,

126
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,733
equalization in the military.
I just don't see why that's such a 

127
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,624
priority,
but maybe that's just my old fashioned 

128
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,660
conservatism speaking it.
It could be,

129
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,423
it could be that I'm derek fake asks,
how do you see love arrows in your 

130
00:09:57,941 --> 00:10:00,970
general world view?
Where does love come from?

131
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,710
You guys?
Yeah.

132
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,590
Asking possibly hard questions.
Well,

133
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,400
I think that truth has to be embodied 
inside love or in embedded inside love.

134
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,663
You know,
it's not easy to figure out a hierarchy 

135
00:10:15,161 --> 00:10:16,870
of values,
of ultimate values.

136
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,180
There's great.
The great traditional values of the good

137
00:10:22,181 --> 00:10:25,390
and the beautiful and the true,
let's say,

138
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,224
to courageous and that sort of thing.
It's not easy to figure out how you 

139
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,533
arrange those hierarchically,
but it seems to me that truth is likely 

140
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:37,294
something that serves a master of one 
form or another at least ethical truth 

141
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:46,291
and love is something like the decision 
that being is fundamentally good or it's

142
00:10:47,651 --> 00:10:50,440
the decision to act as if being as 
fundamentally good.

143
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,450
That might be the right way of thinking 
about it.

144
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:53,284
So
I thought about this in relationship to 

145
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:59,830
my son when he was little,
three years old and like unbearably cute

146
00:10:59,831 --> 00:11:03,160
and you know,
little three year olds,

147
00:11:03,161 --> 00:11:05,020
they're,
they're fairly easily hurt.

148
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,730
I mean,
they're quite robust in some ways,

149
00:11:06,731 --> 00:11:07,564
but they're fairly easily hurt.
They can run out into traffic and you 

150
00:11:10,481 --> 00:11:11,314
know,
they skinned their knees and they bang 

151
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,190
heads on table sued,
you know,

152
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,093
they're prone to emotional breakdown and
they have all these extreme fragilities 

153
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:26,650
that make you nervous,
I would say,

154
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,753
and alert and attended as an adult.
But that also expose you directly to 

155
00:11:32,471 --> 00:11:33,304
the,
to the fact of the potential tragedy of 

156
00:11:35,351 --> 00:11:36,184
life coaches.
I think one of the reasons why having 

157
00:11:38,201 --> 00:11:41,740
children matures you in a way that 
nothing else can.

158
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,780
And you know,
I imagined,

159
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,780
I've written about this in my new book,
12 rules for life.

160
00:11:46,781 --> 00:11:47,614
I imagined that I could remove his 
vulnerabilities one by one so that he 

161
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:53,410
couldn't be hurt.
So,

162
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,970
you know,
I thought,

163
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,863
well I could make them into a robot and 
it was 15 feet tall and made out of 

164
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:04,530
metal and that would remove his physical
vulnerability,

165
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,100
can have tremendous strength and you 
know,

166
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,410
you could turn them into something like 
a superhero with all these,

167
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:16,450
with all these strengths instead of 
these exceptional vulnerabilities.

168
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,283
But what I realized very rapidly was 
that every time he removed a 

169
00:12:20,711 --> 00:12:21,544
vulnerability,
you removed an essential part of the 

170
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:24,791
person.
Right,

171
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:25,624
a part that you really love because with
that little three year old boy kid for 

172
00:12:29,051 --> 00:12:32,050
example mean it's there,
it's there,

173
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,753
it's there.
Fragility in some sense that's a huge 

174
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,070
part of their charm and appeal.
It's not like you'd wish it on them,

175
00:12:39,071 --> 00:12:43,630
but it's part of their.
It's part of their value as beings and I

176
00:12:43,631 --> 00:12:44,464
think that reflects something like the 
paradoxical situation that the Dallas 

177
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:54,121
referred to when when they in the Tao Te
Ching and they talk about the what makes

178
00:12:54,401 --> 00:12:57,280
a plot valuable is the empty space 
inside it.

179
00:12:57,281 --> 00:13:00,670
It's,
it's what it's not as much as what it is

180
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,743
that makes it well actual first of all 
real but also useful and there's 

181
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,270
something really profound about that in 
that limitations.

182
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,530
So I would say limitation is the 
precondition for being.

183
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,263
And it's really I,
I'd like to get this right so that you 

184
00:13:18,821 --> 00:13:19,654
can follow it because it's,
it's one of the most useful thoughts I 

185
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:25,180
think that has ever occurred to me.
The first is the

186
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,000
limits are a precondition for being.
Just like rules are preconditioned for a

187
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:33,910
game.
Like you can't play a game where you can

188
00:13:33,911 --> 00:13:34,744
make any move at any time.
You have to narrow the playing field 

189
00:13:37,611 --> 00:13:38,444
substantially and you have to put 
restrictions on what can be done in 

190
00:13:41,981 --> 00:13:42,814
order for anything to be done and so 
maybe being is this paradoxical state 

191
00:13:46,781 --> 00:13:51,781
where there's there's just enough 
limitation to maximize possibility,

192
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:56,650
something like that and that seems right
to me why that would be.

193
00:13:56,651 --> 00:13:57,484
I have no idea,
but maybe that's something like an 

194
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:01,570
answer to why,
why there's anything,

195
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,543
why anything was created or I know I'm 
speaking metaphysically but but I still 

196
00:14:07,571 --> 00:14:10,540
think it's worthwhile doing so and then 
well,

197
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,940
if,
if,

198
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,163
if limitation is the precondition for 
being then then that that introduces 

199
00:14:18,361 --> 00:14:19,194
suffering into the world and tragedy 
because of course suffering and tragedy 

200
00:14:22,121 --> 00:14:22,954
or consequence of limitation and so then
the situation is that if you want to 

201
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:30,400
have the being where possibility is 
maximized,

202
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:35,730
you have to accept the limitations that 
produced tragedy and so that's maybe the

203
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:37,330
justification for tragedy.

204
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,730
Assuming that such a thing needs to be 
justified.

205
00:14:39,731 --> 00:14:44,731
And then the final thought in that three
part series as well.

206
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,083
Maybe there's a way to live so that the 
tragedy that's an intrinsic part of 

207
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:50,554
limited being becomes bearable or 
becomes even something like celebrate 

208
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,333
and I guess that would be akin to 
Nietzsche's wish for the eternal return 

209
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:00,254
like he thought you should live so that 
if every moment that you lived recurred 

210
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:05,870
eternally that that would be a good 
thing,

211
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:11,120
and so it's a heroic motive being.
It's conceivable that are heroic mode of

212
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:14,360
being that requires the adoption of 
responsibility,

213
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,513
gives your life sufficient gravitas and 
weight and meaning so that the tragedy 

214
00:15:19,671 --> 00:15:23,810
of being can be withstood without 
becoming corrupt,

215
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,990
and I would certainly hope that that 
would be the case.

216
00:15:26,991 --> 00:15:29,960
And I think there's some reasons to 
assume that it might be.

217
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,363
So.
Can you talk more about the 

218
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:37,934
resurrection?
This remains a stumbling block for many 

219
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:43,940
of your more atheistic followers who 
have otherwise embraced your approach to

220
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:46,940
understanding Christianity.
Well.

221
00:15:46,941 --> 00:15:50,330
I can only talk about it symbolically to
begin with and that's,

222
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,730
I think,
not sufficient,

223
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,223
but I hope as I moved through the 
Biblical series that I can zero in on 

224
00:15:58,221 --> 00:16:00,270
that more and more particularly,
but

225
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,140
the idea of the dying and resurrected 
God is a very old idea.

226
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,713
Um,
and it's echoed in such things as the 

227
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:12,400
imagery save the Phoenix which burns 
itself up.

228
00:16:12,401 --> 00:16:16,270
And then Ms Dot Torres itself to its,
to its early form.

229
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,740
And I think speaking purely 
psychologically,

230
00:16:20,741 --> 00:16:25,741
that idea of the dying and resurrected 
savior is something like a reflection of

231
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:30,310
the fact that in order to progress 
psychologically,

232
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,910
you have to let go.
Especially in the face of obstacles.

233
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:38,110
You have to let go of those things that 
are impeding your progress that might be

234
00:16:38,111 --> 00:16:38,944
very dear to your heart.
You have to let them go and let them 

235
00:16:41,231 --> 00:16:42,064
die.
And then you have to let a new part of 

236
00:16:43,151 --> 00:16:46,720
yourself be born.
So because when you're wrong,

237
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,120
you have to let the part of you that's 
wrong,

238
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:52,120
die.
And then a new part spring to life.

239
00:16:52,121 --> 00:16:53,010
In some sense.

240
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,263
It's a new part that's partly a union of
your mind and union of the information 

241
00:16:58,391 --> 00:16:59,224
that's contained in the error that you 
committed and it's like the birth in 

242
00:17:02,411 --> 00:17:03,244
some sense of the new spirit and so you 
could say that there's this idea that 

243
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,603
you have to have faith in Christ because
Christ is the way and the truth and the 

244
00:17:12,551 --> 00:17:15,190
life.
No one comes to the father but through,

245
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:18,670
but through him.
What that means symbolically as far as I

246
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:19,504
can tell that is that you have to 
embrace the process of voluntary death 

247
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:28,260
and rebirth in order to continue moving 
forward properly in your life and it.

248
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,373
It's also that process of death and 
rebirth that rejuvenates the father and 

249
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:33,843
it's also that process of death and 
rebirth that produces the father to 

250
00:17:36,761 --> 00:17:37,594
begin with.
If you think about the father is the 

251
00:17:38,921 --> 00:17:39,754
symbol of of culture,
so at minimum the idea of the 

252
00:17:44,681 --> 00:17:45,514
resurrected Christ is the idea that you 
should identify not with that part of 

253
00:17:49,741 --> 00:17:54,420
yourself that stagnant and dead and that
already knows but is prone to error.

254
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:58,890
You should identify with that part of 
yourself that's always stretching beyond

255
00:17:58,891 --> 00:17:59,724
what you currently know and has the 
faith to let go of old certainties so 

256
00:18:03,781 --> 00:18:07,560
that new patterns of being can be 
brought into place.

257
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,993
And so now that's a purely psychological
explanation and I think I made the case 

258
00:18:15,421 --> 00:18:16,254
in my biblical lectures that I'm 
striving for a psychological 

259
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:20,640
interpretation at the moment.
Um,

260
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,863
my experience with the biblical stories 
is that there are layers of depth in 

261
00:18:26,971 --> 00:18:27,804
them that are sufficiently profound 
perhaps because of the staggering 

262
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:33,624
hyperlinking of the text and its 
association with almost the entire 

263
00:18:36,871 --> 00:18:41,280
Corpus of Western literature that as you
keep digging,

264
00:18:41,281 --> 00:18:43,050
you find more and more.
And so,

265
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,433
um,
I don't know what to make of the more 

266
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,760
metaphysical claims,
you know,

267
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,213
and,
but I'm going to leave it at that 

268
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:53,370
because I don't know,
it's only speculation.

269
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,810
Um,
see,

270
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,703
I guess it is that we don't,
I really don't believe that we 

271
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:05,661
understand consciousness and we don't 
understand its role in the cosmos.

272
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,133
It could be that consciousness is just 
an epiphenomenon of materialist 

273
00:19:09,871 --> 00:19:10,704
processes,
but there's a couple of things to me 

274
00:19:13,531 --> 00:19:15,940
that seems to mitigate against that 
explanation,

275
00:19:15,941 --> 00:19:16,774
and the first is that we don't have an 
account of consciousness that's that's 

276
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:22,464
useful.
We have no idea how the material 

277
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,953
substrate of the brain produces this.
This awareness and self awareness that 

278
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:34,281
seems to be crucially important in the 
existence of the cosmos and so far as if

279
00:19:34,981 --> 00:19:36,840
there's nothing to experience,
something.

280
00:19:36,841 --> 00:19:39,960
It's very difficult to say in what way 
that it exists.

281
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,303
You need a viewer and an observer and 
scientists sort of gerrymandered out by 

282
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,013
positing a hypothetical observer when 
they talk about a phenomena where there 

283
00:19:49,831 --> 00:19:50,664
is no actual observer and so 
consciousness could be just an EPA 

284
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:55,094
phenomena,
but it could also be something central 

285
00:19:56,671 --> 00:19:57,504
to the nature of being and certainly 
mythological stories presented that way 

286
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,130
that there's.

287
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:02,963
There's nature now.
It would be nurtured from a scientific 

288
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:05,844
perspective and there's the social world
that would be the great father from the 

289
00:20:08,671 --> 00:20:09,504
mythological perspective and and that's 
all there is from a scientific 

290
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:15,630
perspective,
but from a mythological perspective,

291
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,493
there's active consciousness and that's 
associated with the idea of the logos 

292
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:24,930
and the logos seems to be something like
if you think about it as consciousness,

293
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:29,640
it seems to be this thing that 
encounters the potential of future being

294
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,880
and then determines at least in part how
to shape it.

295
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,910
Obviously we're constrained in many 
ways.

296
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:36,953
We can't shape things in any old way,
but we can certainly advance in the 

297
00:20:41,671 --> 00:20:45,690
direction of our imagination and quite 
staggering and compelling manner.

298
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:48,880
And then you might say,
is that real?

299
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:54,260
Is is is the idea that we have a 
consciousness and that it's free in some

300
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,880
in in incomprehensible sense,
and that it plays a role in constructing

301
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:00,940
the cosmos?

302
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,700
Is that real?
And then I would say,

303
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:05,470
well,
it depends on what you mean by real,

304
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,540
but I would also point out that you act 
as if it's real and that are functional.

305
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:11,374
Legal systems like the legal systems of 
on the West are predicated on the 

306
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:18,430
acceptance of its reality.
And it was an idea that took many,

307
00:21:18,431 --> 00:21:22,420
many thousands of years to be merge 
know.

308
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:25,840
First of all,
the only sovereign was well was the king

309
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:28,510
and God.
And then the nobles became sovereign and

310
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:32,080
then men became sovereign.
And then with the Christian revolution,

311
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,820
every individual's soul became 
sovereign.

312
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,063
That idea of of individual sovereignty 
and worth is the core presupposition of 

313
00:21:40,031 --> 00:21:42,130
our legal system and our cultural 
systems.

314
00:21:42,131 --> 00:21:42,964
And so we all walk around acting as if 
every one of us is a divine center of 

315
00:21:48,551 --> 00:21:53,060
logos because we give each other the 
respect of,

316
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:57,070
of,
of individual citizens who are sovereign

317
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,260
and that are equal before the law.

318
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,740
And the funny thing is is if someone 
doesn't treat you that way,

319
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:07,790
he treats you as if you're free.
Will is an illusion or refuses to regard

320
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:13,861
you as someone who plays a active part 
in choosing outcome of their life.

321
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:15,880
Then you get very,
very annoyed.

322
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:19,780
And so if it's an illusion and perhaps 
it is,

323
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:24,070
we don't understand an alternative to it
and it's unbelievably,

324
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:29,230
it's unbelievably functional.
So okay,

325
00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:31,210
so back to love.
Well,

326
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,773
um,
will make the case that a limitation is 

327
00:22:38,351 --> 00:22:39,184
necessary for being.
And then we can make the case that 

328
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:46,480
tragedy is an inevitable consequence of 
limitation.

329
00:22:46,481 --> 00:22:47,590
And then we might say,
well,

330
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,433
is being worth the tragedy.
And I think the answer yes to that is 

331
00:22:53,771 --> 00:22:54,604
love.
And the answer no to that is the 

332
00:22:56,321 --> 00:23:00,310
opposite of love because when you,
when you love someone,

333
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,810
you love them in spite of or even 
because of their vulnerability,

334
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,540
not that you don't want them to 
transcend that because you do.

335
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,913
But,
and I think that love is the acceptance 

336
00:23:12,941 --> 00:23:13,774
of the price of being.
It's the way you manifest your 

337
00:23:16,211 --> 00:23:18,910
acceptance of the price of being.
Because if you love someone,

338
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,163
you know,
they have their vulnerabilities like 

339
00:23:21,461 --> 00:23:22,294
every human being,
but your basic judgment is that despite 

340
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:27,874
the fact that they have these 
vulnerabilities that are even fatal and 

341
00:23:31,211 --> 00:23:32,044
that are certainly tragic,
that it's better that they were then 

342
00:23:35,211 --> 00:23:37,750
that they weren't,
and that's,

343
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:42,040
and I think that's the right attitude to
have towards being itself.

344
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,240
Uh,
it's,

345
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,490
it's,
it's an optimistic attitude

346
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:51,500
and I think it has to be predicated on 
faith because I don't think that you can

347
00:23:51,501 --> 00:23:56,290
necessarily derive that conclusion by,
by looking at the available evidence.

348
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,020
The evidence is kind of 50 slash 50 and 
in many situations,

349
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,493
but,
but I can tell you if you adopt the 

350
00:24:03,891 --> 00:24:07,100
other attitude that being is 
unjustifiable,

351
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:11,180
then that leads you down a very,
very dark road and then you assume start

352
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:15,710
to work in a way that makes things far 
more intolerable then they should be.

353
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,590
So that's,
um,

354
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:23,960
that's my answer to that.
Any tips on avoiding booze?

355
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,300
Yeah,
that's a real tough one.

356
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,070
Well,
I would say a couple of things.

357
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,770
There is a drug.
If you're a binge drinker,

358
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,203
there is a drug called naltrexone that 
you could consider and you take mail 

359
00:24:35,331 --> 00:24:38,480
trucks on every day.
It doesn't really have any psychological

360
00:24:38,481 --> 00:24:41,900
effect on you,
but if you're a naltrexone responder,

361
00:24:41,901 --> 00:24:46,040
what'll happen is that it will dampen 
your positive response to alcohol.

362
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,873
So some people who are alcoholic,
many of them have a very pronounced 

363
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:51,770
opiate,
is a,

364
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,220
uh,
an opiate effect from alcohol.

365
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,203
It looks like it's mediated by Beta 
endorphin and now trick zone into is an 

366
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:00,950
opiate blocker.
And so,

367
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:02,403
um,
what naltrexone seems to do is dampen 

368
00:25:05,241 --> 00:25:08,690
the positive response and the positive 
response,

369
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,733
which would be opiate.
And then dopaminergic is the same 

370
00:25:13,161 --> 00:25:16,220
response that makes you want to keep 
drinking when you start drinking.

371
00:25:16,221 --> 00:25:19,040
So if you're one of those people that 
has a drink and then has to have another

372
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:21,080
one and then has to have another one and
you know,

373
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:21,943
soon all your money's gone,
then the probability that you have an 

374
00:25:24,561 --> 00:25:25,394
opiate response is pretty high.
And now trick someone can help with 

375
00:25:28,221 --> 00:25:29,054
that.
Um,

376
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,540
generally when people take naltrexone 
and they keep drinking,

377
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,580
they try to control,
but they keep drinking.

378
00:25:34,581 --> 00:25:38,630
And they learn over time that the 
alcohol doesn't have the same punch.

379
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,493
It's still pleasant,
but it doesn't have the same 

380
00:25:40,311 --> 00:25:42,740
overwhelming punch that it did at one 
point.

381
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,490
So that would be one suggestion and it's
worth trying.

382
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,043
The other is like make a plan,
I would say do the future authoring 

383
00:25:50,781 --> 00:25:54,260
program because it isn't that you're 
trying to avoid booze.

384
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,094
Exactly.
It's that you're trying to restructure 

385
00:25:57,051 --> 00:25:58,280
your whole life,
you know,

386
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:01,730
because if you're a drinker then all 
your friends are drinkers and,

387
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,560
and you're used to drinking in every 
social situation and the places that you

388
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:10,790
go to socialize or places that you drink
and like it's really built in as a whole

389
00:26:10,791 --> 00:26:11,624
set of habits.
And so what you have to do is kind of 

390
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:16,610
redesign your life.
And you have to think of things.

391
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:21,380
You can't just stop drinking.
You have to figure out what you're going

392
00:26:21,381 --> 00:26:25,370
to start doing instead of drinking.
There's a hole that you have to fill in.

393
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,653
And you know,
the future authoring program will also 

394
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:32,210
help you figure out what your life could
look like in the absence of alcohol.

395
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,003
And what kind of hell you could end up 
in if you keep drinking and it causes 

396
00:26:38,421 --> 00:26:42,200
all the problems that it can cause and I
think you really need to like,

397
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,093
you need to think the hail that can 
occur and you have to think through how 

398
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,604
your life could be valuable with the 
alcohol so that you can be motivated 

399
00:26:51,121 --> 00:26:54,720
enough to,
to try to regulate it.

400
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:57,810
And I would also say if you failed and 
slip,

401
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,720
don't berate yourself and beat yourself 
up.

402
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,920
Just start quitting again because you 
know,

403
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:07,050
if you could cut your alcohol intake 
down 75 percent,

404
00:27:07,051 --> 00:27:07,884
that's a hell of lot better than zero.
And often people go all or nothing just 

405
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:13,560
like they do with their quitting 
cigarettes.

406
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,110
And in all those quit for a month and 
then have a cigarette.

407
00:27:16,111 --> 00:27:17,010
And I say,
Oh my God,

408
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:17,844
now I'm now I've broken the pact.
And then they'll smoke a whole pack and 

409
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:23,550
they'll be smoking again.
You don't have to do that.

410
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:24,384
You can just decide that you slipped and
that you're going to get back on the 

411
00:27:27,601 --> 00:27:30,600
wagon again.
And no one can take a long time.

412
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:34,080
But I do believe that you need a better 
vision of life,

413
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:34,943
right?
You have to find something to do that's 

414
00:27:36,211 --> 00:27:39,290
better than alcohol,
and that might take some,

415
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,253
some real consideration,
especially if alcohol is a very potent 

416
00:27:43,981 --> 00:27:44,814
drug for you.
Then I would also say don't hesitate to 

417
00:27:47,371 --> 00:27:48,830
try the NALTREXONE.
It.

418
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:53,430
It's got a pretty decent clinical 
history and it's basically harmless.

419
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:58,820
So
I've listened carefully to your Cain and

420
00:28:00,951 --> 00:28:01,784
Abel lecture,
but waves of contempt for existence 

421
00:28:04,221 --> 00:28:05,054
itself keep coming.
There's a part of me that revels in 

422
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:11,420
riding these waves waves,
but can I harness them for good?

423
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,370
God,
you guys,

424
00:28:13,371 --> 00:28:14,204
you ask the hardest questions.
Waves of contempt of exists for 

425
00:28:18,051 --> 00:28:20,120
existence itself.
Keep coming.

426
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,930
Well,
I guess what I would say is

427
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:41,340
it's probably time for a little bit of 
individual psychoanalysis.

428
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:44,860
I don't necessarily mean that you have 
to go and find a therapist.

429
00:28:44,861 --> 00:28:45,694
I would say

430
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,390
you're,
you're generalizing.

431
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,253
You know,
you see waves of contempt for existence 

432
00:28:52,061 --> 00:28:53,050
itself.
Keep coming,

433
00:28:53,051 --> 00:28:55,300
but I don't believe that that's exactly 
right.

434
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,970
And I'm certainly not accusing you of 
being deceitful.

435
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,190
It's,
it's more like low resolution.

436
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,013
My suspicions are is that there's a set 
of experiences that you've had that are 

437
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,903
characteristic to your own personal life
that have caused you to do caused you 

438
00:29:11,381 --> 00:29:12,214
some bitterness and some resentment and 
that those haven't been thought through 

439
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:20,860
and usually thinking through means at 
least in some part,

440
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,753
trying to take as much responsibility 
for those for altering the conditions 

441
00:29:25,481 --> 00:29:28,900
under which those things happen going 
forward into the future as possible.

442
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:33,700
Like the purpose of memories to stop you
from doing the same stupid things in the

443
00:29:33,701 --> 00:29:34,534
future.
Right?

444
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:35,463
That that's the purpose.
And so if you've had experiences that 

445
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,393
have made you bitter and resentful or 
are still in experiences that are doing 

446
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:43,864
that,
then you need to do a careful micro 

447
00:29:45,421 --> 00:29:46,254
analysis of what those are and see if 
you can see if you can flip your 

448
00:29:49,271 --> 00:29:50,590
attitude in some matter.

449
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,810
You know,
I'm not saying this is easy,

450
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,673
but the first thing you can do is at 
least figure out what those memories 

451
00:29:56,771 --> 00:30:00,430
are.
And I might recommend trying to pass the

452
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:01,264
authoring program because what the past 
authoring program does is ask you to 

453
00:30:04,931 --> 00:30:05,764
break your life up into six parks and 
then to identify the emotionally 

454
00:30:09,731 --> 00:30:14,731
significant occurrences during each of 
those epochs and you can kind of tell if

455
00:30:14,921 --> 00:30:17,740
something needs work from a memory 
perspective,

456
00:30:17,741 --> 00:30:22,350
if if it occurred more than about 18 
months ago and when you remember it,

457
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,193
it still causes like a wave of sadness 
or anger or really any kind of negative 

458
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:27,994
emotion because what that means is that 
your brain is still targeting that 

459
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:32,164
experience as threatening and unexplored
and what that means is that in some 

460
00:30:36,611 --> 00:30:37,444
sense,
part of you or a part of the that could 

461
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:42,880
exist is still stuck in that memory 
because you can go back and do a careful

462
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,253
causal analysis of the events that led 
up to the unfortunate circumstance and 

463
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:53,860
try to map out your role and even if 
your role is minor,

464
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,980
there's going to be things that you 
could have done differently to avoid it.

465
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:59,080
And that's what you need to figure out 
for the future.

466
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:04,270
I would say you try to shed all your 
personal resentment.

467
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:08,170
A part of that too is to not take,
not take things too personally.

468
00:31:08,171 --> 00:31:10,930
You know,
like one of the advantages of developing

469
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:11,764
what I would regard as a mythologically 
centered view of the cosmos is that you 

470
00:31:15,461 --> 00:31:16,294
understand that
the reason there's nothing personal 

471
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:22,270
about the fact that terrible things 
happened to you.

472
00:31:22,271 --> 00:31:24,490
I mean,
unless you're directly causally involved

473
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:25,324
as as it says,
I believe in the Old Testament rains on 

474
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:31,810
the just and the unjust alike and no 
there are,

475
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,793
and this is an existentialist motif.
The tragedy and difficulty and even the 

476
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,833
confrontation with evil are built into 
the structure of existence and it's not 

477
00:31:41,081 --> 00:31:45,040
aimed at you personally and it while as 
I said,

478
00:31:45,041 --> 00:31:48,550
it may be the price that we pay for 
existence itself and you can say,

479
00:31:48,551 --> 00:31:52,230
well that price is too high to pay,
but well,

480
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,580
as I mentioned,
if you start taking that way,

481
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:56,500
then you make everything much,
much worse.

482
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:57,783
It seems better to shoulder.
You're cross voluntarily and stumble 

483
00:32:01,911 --> 00:32:03,880
forward towards the light.
That's.

484
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,043
That's the best strategy and I would say
that that just because it's the best 

485
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:11,830
strategy doesn't even necessarily mean 
that it's always going to work like this

486
00:32:11,831 --> 00:32:16,570
is no optimistic scenario like a dragon 
fight is no optimistic scenario.

487
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,733
Confront the dragon and get the gold and
get the girl and bring it back to to 

488
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,920
share with the community the gold and 
you know that sounds all well and good,

489
00:32:26,021 --> 00:32:28,900
but after all it is a dragon and many 
people get eaten by them.

490
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:32,020
So.
But the myth basically says,

491
00:32:32,021 --> 00:32:32,854
well,
your best bet is to open your eyes and 

492
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,003
speak the truth and look forward,
forthright and confront the things that 

493
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,383
are the hydrus that are raising their 
hands and their tentacles constantly to 

494
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,870
frighten you and stop.
You have to fight the tyranny of,

495
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,680
of,
of the social structure when,

496
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:55,280
when it's oppressing you unduly and,
and that's.

497
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,920
And that's what you have to do.
But I would say if,

498
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,013
if contempt is there now,
now it's really worth digging into 

499
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,040
because that,
that would also be the source.

500
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,113
That would be the place where you 
discover union shattered because you 

501
00:33:07,311 --> 00:33:08,144
would discover depth.
Contempt is an unbelievably destructive 

502
00:33:10,701 --> 00:33:11,534
force.
Contempt is a particularly destructive 

503
00:33:12,921 --> 00:33:16,670
force and it would be useful for you to 
try to think about.

504
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,650
You can use fantasy to do this.
It's like,

505
00:33:18,651 --> 00:33:21,470
okay,
if you let that contempt manifest itself

506
00:33:21,471 --> 00:33:26,150
fully in like a dream or a daydream and 
and you let it go on a rampage.

507
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,850
Like what?
What's the vision exactly?

508
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,280
I mean is it the destruction of the 
town?

509
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:32,463
Is the destruction of the country?
Do you want the entire world to blow up 

510
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,090
like,
or are there specific people that you're

511
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,290
angry out or maybe you're angry at 
yourself,

512
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:44,320
like you need to figure out those waves 
of contempt or unarticulated elements of

513
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:47,060
experience and they're part of your 
shadow.

514
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,590
So can you harness them for good?
Well,

515
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,770
I think the more you understand your 
dark urges,

516
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:55,993
the more likely you are to be able to 
regulate and control them and to use 

517
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:03,530
them as part of your power.
When a person or authority,

518
00:34:03,531 --> 00:34:04,364
let's say a person who has authority is 
someone who's integrated the dangerous 

519
00:34:08,151 --> 00:34:08,984
parts of themselves and that's part of 
what gives their words Gravitas and 

520
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:14,480
weight.
And so yes,

521
00:34:14,481 --> 00:34:16,460
I think you could,
you can harness them for good.

522
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:17,323
It's,
and I think that's the right thing to 

523
00:34:19,071 --> 00:34:19,904
do,
but it will involve a fair bit of 

524
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,040
painful soul searching.
So.

525
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,250
Okay,
let's see what else we've got here.

526
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:39,983
Can you hazard a guess where Europe is 
clamping down on speech critical of 

527
00:34:42,421 --> 00:34:45,780
Islam when Islam is causing lots of 
problems with rape,

528
00:34:45,781 --> 00:34:46,740
gangs,
terrorism,

529
00:34:46,741 --> 00:34:48,840
and generally being a menace?
Why?

530
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,290
Well,
I suppose the first,

531
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,850
let's say if I was going to oppose that 
statement,

532
00:34:59,851 --> 00:35:03,720
I would say,
well perhaps it's a propaganda stick.

533
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,900
Uh,
what would you call it,

534
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,960
conspiracy to blame what's happening in 
Europe on Islamic immigrants?

535
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,500
I guess part of the problem is,
is that at least as far as I can tell,

536
00:35:16,501 --> 00:35:17,334
the news has become sufficiently 
unreliable because it's so polarized 

537
00:35:20,341 --> 00:35:22,140
that we can't really tell what's going 
on.

538
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,453
I mean,
I think the reason that you're at this 

539
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,593
time being down on speech,
critical of Islam is partly the same 

540
00:35:30,421 --> 00:35:31,254
reason that the entire Western world is 
clamping down on speech that's critical 

541
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:37,830
of anything that is associated with 
identity,

542
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,040
which

543
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,120
is pretty much any set of ideas that 
unites people and it's.

544
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:46,320
It's a consequence of the collective 
decision that we made.

545
00:35:46,321 --> 00:35:47,154
That egalitarianism and a conflict 
avoidance constitute the two highest 

546
00:35:52,801 --> 00:35:55,860
virtues and they trump everything else 
including free speech.

547
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:01,050
Now why that's happened is very,
very difficult thing to say.

548
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:01,884
I mean,
I suspect to some degree that it's a 

549
00:36:04,531 --> 00:36:07,770
consequence of women becoming involved 
in the political system,

550
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,993
which is something that we've never 
experienced before and women are more 

551
00:36:12,031 --> 00:36:16,650
agreeable
by nature than men and variable.

552
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:19,860
People are are compassionate towards 
those.

553
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:23,610
They see a suffering and that seems to 
include any minority,

554
00:36:23,611 --> 00:36:27,510
especially when you combine that with a 
kind of neo Marxist doctrine that claims

555
00:36:27,511 --> 00:36:30,240
that anyone who has an advantage swiped 
it.

556
00:36:30,241 --> 00:36:31,074
And I think in the Islamic situation,
you can get it real conflict there 

557
00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:35,094
because it's obviously the case that 
many Islamic practices are not 

558
00:36:39,121 --> 00:36:43,020
commensurate with postmodern neo Marxist
feminism,

559
00:36:43,021 --> 00:36:43,854
let's say,
but they seem to get a free pass and I 

560
00:36:45,331 --> 00:36:46,164
guess that's because the idea that all 
cultures are equal trumps the 

561
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,970
requirement for human rights for women.

562
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,183
And and maybe the other thing that's 
even darker is that there's a fair bit 

563
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:00,834
of revolutionary fervor in the more 
radical end of the political spectrum 

564
00:37:05,381 --> 00:37:09,690
and that radical fervor is devoted 
towards tearing down the patriarchy.

565
00:37:09,691 --> 00:37:12,270
And of course that's basically Western 
civilization.

566
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,104
And so if,
because Islam isn't part of Western 

567
00:37:15,991 --> 00:37:19,920
civilization,
then it can be seen as an ally in that,

568
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,920
in that attempt.
That's what it looks like to me.

569
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:28,110
I also think that ignorance and all of 
that contribute.

570
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:28,973
It isn't obvious that people who
are afraid of such things as 

571
00:37:33,901 --> 00:37:37,200
Islamophobia really understand anything 
about Islam.

572
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,540
I wouldn't say I understand anything 
about Islam,

573
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:41,160
even though I've read a fair bit about 
it.

574
00:37:41,161 --> 00:37:45,540
It's very difficult to put yourself 
inside a different belief system.

575
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:46,823
I'm somewhat apprehensive about Islam 
because it looks to me like it's a 

576
00:37:52,201 --> 00:37:53,034
totalizing system as well as a religion 
and it's a totalizing system because 

577
00:37:57,331 --> 00:37:59,400
everything has to come under his 
purview,

578
00:37:59,401 --> 00:38:03,960
including law and and everything that 
goes along with that.

579
00:38:03,961 --> 00:38:04,794
There's no separation between church and
state and so I don't see how that's 

580
00:38:08,221 --> 00:38:09,054
commensurate with the western mode of 
existence and I don't think people want 

581
00:38:12,031 --> 00:38:14,610
to have that conversation because they 
want to say,

582
00:38:14,611 --> 00:38:15,990
well,
no.

583
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:19,440
Everyone diverse as they are and 
important as that.

584
00:38:19,441 --> 00:38:23,640
Diversity is apparently such that 
everyone has to be represented equally.

585
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:24,743
The diversity isn't really of anything 
about anything fundamental and we can 

586
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,514
all get along without a problem and
I'm afraid that that's extraordinarily 

587
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,543
naive.

588
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:42,240
And then I suppose there's also an 
element of something like Western guilt.

589
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:47,770
I guess perhaps for what has been 
described as our imperialists past

590
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:50,250
the

591
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:52,490
that there's been a very longterm 
assault

592
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,900
on,
on the,

593
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:56,910
what would you call moral

594
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,773
on the morality of the West.
We're often viewed as the rapers and 

595
00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:03,274
pillagers of the world and that sort of 
goes along with the environmentalist 

596
00:39:05,681 --> 00:39:06,514
ethos.
And so I think we do have a fair bit of 

597
00:39:09,701 --> 00:39:12,130
guilt about that,
whether it's warranted or not.

598
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,253
I mean,
history is a bloody nightmare and it 

599
00:39:15,551 --> 00:39:16,384
doesn't matter where you look.
And I would say at least in the west is 

600
00:39:18,821 --> 00:39:21,940
brought advantages along with its 
disadvantages.

601
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:23,703
And I think that our attitude towards 
individuality is fundamentally correct 

602
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,273
and absolutely vital.
And I would also say that the only 

603
00:39:30,461 --> 00:39:33,820
countries in the world that are 
essentially worth living in,

604
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,833
in any real sense are the ones that are 
predicated on the Judeo Christian 

605
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:42,550
tradition and manifested in western the 
western body of laws.

606
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:43,923
So,
but there's still plenty of guilt and 

607
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:49,160
there's plenty of people who,
well,

608
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,043
who are,
what contemptuous of being out as we 

609
00:39:54,221 --> 00:39:55,630
discussed in the last question.

610
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,463
And also angry with the political system
because they're powerless or maybe 

611
00:39:59,411 --> 00:40:02,110
they've been hurt by male authority 
figures.

612
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:04,420
Um,
that happens very frequently.

613
00:40:04,421 --> 00:40:09,421
And so they have absolutely no trust in 
higher in hierarchical structures.

614
00:40:10,061 --> 00:40:10,894
And there you might add to that to 
certain amount of laziness because the 

615
00:40:15,101 --> 00:40:15,934
thing about hierarchical structures is 
that they impose values on people and 

616
00:40:18,821 --> 00:40:19,654
then in order to progress in that value 
structure that you have to discipline 

617
00:40:21,941 --> 00:40:22,774
yourself and work hard.
And many of the radical leftists 

618
00:40:25,811 --> 00:40:26,644
happened to be very low in 
conscientiousness and so they don't 

619
00:40:29,081 --> 00:40:32,980
believe in hard work and they don't 
believe that people get to where they're

620
00:40:32,981 --> 00:40:35,920
going by hard work.
And then,

621
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,090
well,
one other thing,

622
00:40:37,091 --> 00:40:37,924
there's a group of people I think who 
are basically personality disorder and 

623
00:40:40,601 --> 00:40:41,434
in those are the ones that had never had
a positive relationship with anything 

624
00:40:44,771 --> 00:40:45,760
that was masculine.

625
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,170
And so whenever they see anything 
masculine that has motive power and that

626
00:40:50,171 --> 00:40:53,560
would include authority and competence,
not just power,

627
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:55,263
they assume that that's tyrannical.
And it's part of the postmodern 

628
00:40:58,121 --> 00:40:58,954
assumption that all power higher,
all hierarchies are hierarchies of 

629
00:41:01,601 --> 00:41:03,770
power.
When the truth of the matter is,

630
00:41:03,771 --> 00:41:04,604
is that hierarchies in the West are 
usually hierarchies of authority and 

631
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:09,460
competence.
And they're like,

632
00:41:09,461 --> 00:41:10,294
they're oriented towards getting a 
certain task done and they actually do 

633
00:41:12,611 --> 00:41:14,740
get the task done.
So,

634
00:41:14,741 --> 00:41:19,741
but we're,
I'm dubious about our own ethical,

635
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:25,210
what would you say?
Integrity,

636
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,373
and I guess that's also why it's of 
particular importance for people to try 

637
00:41:29,351 --> 00:41:30,184
to act honestly,
because if you don't act honestly and 

638
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:33,913
then you start to doubt your own 
integrity and then when people come 

639
00:41:35,991 --> 00:41:36,824
after you,
you're going to be weak and that's a 

640
00:41:38,411 --> 00:41:40,670
really bad idea.
So

641
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,960
how has the online personality tests 
coming along?

642
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,130
Can't wait for it.

643
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:49,063
It's coming along pretty well.
We have all the reports written and we 

644
00:41:52,401 --> 00:41:53,700
have the,
um,

645
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,200
the underlying computer architecture 
finished,

646
00:41:57,201 --> 00:42:00,050
and at the moment we're just polishing 
it up essentially.

647
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:00,884
And we're hoping that you'll be able to 
get a very detailed description of all 

648
00:42:05,871 --> 00:42:08,120
five of the big five traits,
right?

649
00:42:08,121 --> 00:42:10,850
Extroversion.
That's a positive emotion dimension.

650
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,840
That's,
that will break down into enthusiasm and

651
00:42:14,841 --> 00:42:19,700
assertiveness and neuroticism.
That breaks down into withdrawal.

652
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:23,750
Like if you're in a state of withdrawal,
then you're frozen with fear and,

653
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,390
and don't want to do anything.
You're afraid to go out.

654
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:27,283
You're,
you're afraid to engage in any complex 

655
00:42:29,301 --> 00:42:32,270
task because you might fail.
You'll doubt yourself intensely.

656
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,433
That's withdrawal in neuroticism.
And then volatility is that kind of 

657
00:42:36,351 --> 00:42:39,800
impulsive touchiness that people often 
develop when they're in a bad mood,

658
00:42:39,801 --> 00:42:40,634
you know,
where if you reach your finger up to 

659
00:42:41,631 --> 00:42:42,464
touch them,
they'll flinch and maybe slap you and 

660
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:44,993
they're over sensitive to small slights 
and they don't have much of a sense of 

661
00:42:48,411 --> 00:42:49,220
humor.

662
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,053
Um,
and agreeableness doubt subdivides into 

663
00:42:52,641 --> 00:42:57,050
compassion and politeness and the 
liberal types are more compassionate and

664
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,213
the conservative types are more polite 
and politeness seems to be something 

665
00:43:02,001 --> 00:43:02,834
like acting in accordance with the 
social norms governing interpersonal 

666
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:07,124
interaction.
Whereas compassion seems to be the 

667
00:43:09,261 --> 00:43:11,900
proclivity to side with the weakest 
party,

668
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:12,943
something like that.
And I think it's the primary maternal 

669
00:43:15,321 --> 00:43:20,321
dimension because the perhaps along with
higher levels of negative emotion,

670
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:25,880
because it's obviously the case that 
when you're dealing with children,

671
00:43:25,881 --> 00:43:26,714
especially infants,
that you should take the side of the 

672
00:43:29,391 --> 00:43:32,420
weaker party pretty much no matter what 
the logical argument.

673
00:43:32,421 --> 00:43:36,200
It's right because an infant who's 
crying is always right,

674
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:40,250
especially if it's under a year old.
There's no logic to it.

675
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,113
It's,
it's an a priori fact that a crying 

676
00:43:42,951 --> 00:43:47,060
infant is correct.
And so we don't know how that translates

677
00:43:47,061 --> 00:43:50,510
into the political sphere because the 
most direct translation would be,

678
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,260
um,
a complaining person is always right.

679
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:55,760
And,
you know,

680
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,593
I see that manifesting itself,
I would say quite clearly in the 

681
00:43:59,691 --> 00:44:00,524
politically correct domain is that you 
always side with the person who's 

682
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,143
manifesting negative emotion and you 
always assume that there's an external 

683
00:44:08,841 --> 00:44:12,050
reason that needs to be rectified in 
order to,

684
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,060
um,
to deal with that.

685
00:44:14,061 --> 00:44:15,110
And,
you know,

686
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:16,303
it isn't obvious to me that 
agreeableness as an ethic is something 

687
00:44:18,801 --> 00:44:22,100
that's transformable into the political 
or the adult landscape.

688
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,533
But,
um,

689
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,513
well,
you know,

690
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:27,343
we don't know these sorts of things and 
we can't even talk about them because 

691
00:44:29,781 --> 00:44:32,880
people automatically assume that that's 
sexist,

692
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:37,190
misogynist stick or even though there 
are agreeable man as well as a grant,

693
00:44:37,191 --> 00:44:41,070
but women,
because men are quite maternal for,

694
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:41,933
for,
for the kind of large apes and mammals 

695
00:44:43,861 --> 00:44:44,694
that we are.
But we need to take these sorts of 

696
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:47,604
things seriously because it isn't 
obvious to me that in an ethic of 

697
00:44:50,161 --> 00:44:53,470
agreeableness can govern a complex 
politics.

698
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,433
Looks to me more like conscientiousness 
is something that needs to govern arm's 

699
00:44:57,841 --> 00:44:59,820
length,
transactions and that sort of thing.

700
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:00,713
Rather than treating everyone like kin,
which you just can't do so you don't 

701
00:45:03,241 --> 00:45:05,850
have the energy.
Anyways.

702
00:45:05,851 --> 00:45:06,684
The test will also associate 
conscientious or assess 

703
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:11,790
conscientiousness.
That's orderliness,

704
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:14,070
which is seems to be associated with 
disgust,

705
00:45:14,071 --> 00:45:19,071
sensitivity and is a good predictor of 
conservative belief and industriousness,

706
00:45:19,261 --> 00:45:23,190
which is something like the well,
it's what it says exactly.

707
00:45:23,191 --> 00:45:28,191
It's the proclivity to engage in 
effortful work towards a defined goal in

708
00:45:28,261 --> 00:45:29,094
a reliable manner and it's the second 
best predictor of longterm life success 

709
00:45:32,341 --> 00:45:35,250
after Icu.
And then the final thing it'll upset,

710
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:36,383
assesses openness to experience which is
more or less half creativity at half 

711
00:45:41,491 --> 00:45:46,491
interest in ideas.
And so if you take the test,

712
00:45:46,831 --> 00:45:47,664
you'll get a boat up.
It's about a 10 page report and sketch 

713
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,573
quite detailed and it tells you where 
you fit on a percentile basis and what 

714
00:45:55,561 --> 00:45:58,170
your strengths and weaknesses are going 
to be as a consequence.

715
00:45:58,170 --> 00:45:59,003
And we're going to produce a couple's 
version so that two of you can take it 

716
00:46:02,191 --> 00:46:05,880
and then you'll get a report that tells 
you how you're similar and different and

717
00:46:05,881 --> 00:46:06,714
where you're likely to to have 
disagreements and agreements where it's 

718
00:46:09,721 --> 00:46:10,554
going to be difficult to negotiate a 
consensus that'd be where your Wyatt 

719
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:14,323
widely different from one another on a 
trait that gets hard for an extrovert 

720
00:46:18,661 --> 00:46:22,530
and an introvert to come to an agreement
about how much socializing they're going

721
00:46:22,531 --> 00:46:24,810
to do because the extrovert says,
well,

722
00:46:24,811 --> 00:46:27,030
let's socialize all the time.
In the introvert says,

723
00:46:27,031 --> 00:46:27,510
well,
you know,

724
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:31,980
once a year would be plenty for me and 
those aren't opinions right there.

725
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:32,943
They're built in preferences that are 
far beneath the realm of opinion and if 

726
00:46:37,321 --> 00:46:39,720
you're high in openness and your partner
is low in openness,

727
00:46:39,721 --> 00:46:40,554
like you're going to be interested in 
the theater and arts and literature and 

728
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:45,143
philosophy and and talking about ideas 
and and going to museums and that sort 

729
00:46:49,951 --> 00:46:50,220
of thing.

730
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:53,210
And your partner is in some sense it 
will be like they're colorblind.

731
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:56,220
They just won't find that sort of thing 
engaging and interesting at all.

732
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,653
And you might be able to shift someone a
little bit to a higher degree of 

733
00:47:00,721 --> 00:47:01,590
openness,
but it's,

734
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,450
it's,
it's not an easy thing to do.

735
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:04,373
So we think in the literature seems to 
indicate that you should be fairly well 

736
00:47:08,851 --> 00:47:11,460
matched on most of your traits with your
partner,

737
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:12,613
uh,
with the possible exception of 

738
00:47:13,471 --> 00:47:16,780
neuroticism because it isn't obvious 
that two people are highly neurotic,

739
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:17,623
can get along.
Uh,

740
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:20,700
neuroticism is a pretty good predictor 
of marital unhappiness,

741
00:47:20,701 --> 00:47:24,270
just like it's a good predictor of every
other form of unhappiness.

742
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:30,020
So
Benjamin would says,

743
00:47:46,381 --> 00:47:48,750
my room is a den of iniquity.
Well,

744
00:47:48,751 --> 00:47:51,360
congratulations.
That's not an easy thing to pull off.

745
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,260
I guess you might be asking yourself,
what's that student for you?

746
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,660
Obviously you're being funny and that's 
just fine.

747
00:47:57,661 --> 00:47:58,494
So

748
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:11,530
what advice would you give to someone 
looking to quit porn?

749
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,233
Well,
I gave some advice a little earlier 

750
00:48:14,381 --> 00:48:15,214
about quitting alcohol.
And I would say it isn't that you're 

751
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:20,104
trying to quit porn.
It's not the right way to think about 

752
00:48:22,451 --> 00:48:23,284
it.
The right way to think about it is that 

753
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:27,130
you're trying to figure out how to have 
a better life.

754
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:30,370
And so you have to figure out,
well,

755
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:31,623
I would say do the future authoring 
program and keep your porn addiction in 

756
00:48:34,721 --> 00:48:38,740
mind and think so in the first part of 
the future authoring program,

757
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:43,810
it asks you a bunch of questions about 
what your life could be like in three to

758
00:48:43,811 --> 00:48:44,644
five years if you took care of yourself 
like you were someone that you cared 

759
00:48:46,901 --> 00:48:48,540
for,
um,

760
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:50,043
and then it asks you questions about 
your friends and your family and your 

761
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:58,530
career and your time outside of work and
your health and you know,

762
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:01,690
the important dimensions of life and it,
it asks you to spend

763
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:04,743
20 minutes writing about how good your 
life could be in three to five years if 

764
00:49:07,121 --> 00:49:09,340
you got your act together and did what 
was good for you.

765
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:12,160
And then it asked you to write about the
hail you could be in if you didn't.

766
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:16,510
And so I would say you really need to do
that because porn isn't the issue.

767
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:19,540
The issue is that you're not living your
life the way you want to.

768
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:24,340
And so you need a vision of life that's 
more compelling than the porn.

769
00:49:24,341 --> 00:49:27,570
And you need a counter vision to that 
frightens you know,

770
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:28,533
because otherwise porn is obviously 
extraordinarily gratifying in the short 

771
00:49:32,291 --> 00:49:32,940
term,
but,

772
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:33,773
but you seem to be suffering from the 
medium to longterm consequences of its 

773
00:49:36,851 --> 00:49:37,684
use.
And so you need a story that you can 

774
00:49:40,421 --> 00:49:41,254
tell yourself that's really deeply 
thought through about why this is not 

775
00:49:44,831 --> 00:49:46,660
appropriate for you.
What's what?

776
00:49:46,661 --> 00:49:47,494
It's how it's hurting you and how it's 
minimizing you admit perhaps making you 

777
00:49:50,741 --> 00:49:54,160
embarrassed and ashamed and more 
socially isolated and all of that.

778
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:55,383
So I would say think about it as 
cleaning up your psyche and your 

779
00:49:59,501 --> 00:50:02,030
behavior rather than merely start 
stopping,

780
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:04,453
stopping poor.
And you also might want to write down 

781
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:07,863
and you could do this in the negative 
vision part of the future authoring 

782
00:50:10,421 --> 00:50:11,254
program.
You got to write down everything bad 

783
00:50:12,641 --> 00:50:13,474
that you think porn is doing to you 
because obviously you have some 

784
00:50:16,241 --> 00:50:18,790
suspicions that this is not good for 
you,

785
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:19,653
right?
That it's,

786
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:20,723
it's actually harming you in some 
important way and so you need to be 

787
00:50:24,911 --> 00:50:25,744
fully cognizant of what those ways are 
and then take them seriously and decide 

788
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:29,984
if that's the pathway through life.
On which you wish to travel and so and 

789
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,940
then I would also say good luck to you.
You know,

790
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:39,860
it's,
it's a very good idea to identify one of

791
00:50:39,861 --> 00:50:42,110
your weaknesses and work on time.
You can.

792
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:44,670
You can strengthen yourself 
substantially by doing that.

793
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:50,420
Is there a way to take any of your 
classes online?

794
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:53,240
Will you be establishing an online 
university?

795
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:57,080
Well,
there's no way at the moment to take any

796
00:50:57,081 --> 00:50:57,914
of my classes online for credit,
which I presume is what you're asking 

797
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:03,243
you.
All the lectures that I've done for the 

798
00:51:04,401 --> 00:51:05,234
classes are online on youtube for many 
of the classes so you can get the 

799
00:51:09,801 --> 00:51:10,634
information and you can do the reading
but you can't be accredited for it and 

800
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,393
that's partly due to University of the 
University of Toronto hasn't set up the 

801
00:51:21,081 --> 00:51:23,960
university to make that a 
straightforward thing yet.

802
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:25,970
And the accreditation problem is a big 
one.

803
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:29,060
Will you be establishing an online 
university?

804
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:30,493
Well,
you know,

805
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:33,590
that depends.
It depends.

806
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:38,710
My health has been uneven for a 
substantial amount of time and when it's

807
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:40,213
down as it is right now,
I'm probably only five percent as 

808
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:47,270
productive as I am when it's,
when I'm functioning at full bore,

809
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:49,093
I seem to have developed a series of or 
discovered a series of food 

810
00:51:51,951 --> 00:51:56,150
sensitivities that I share with my 
daughter and it's very,

811
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:57,013
uh,
the reaction to eating the wrong thing 

812
00:51:58,581 --> 00:52:00,850
is extremely vicious.

813
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:04,760
Basically flattens me out for a month.
Um,

814
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:08,330
I can't think properly and I can't 
organize my actions.

815
00:52:08,331 --> 00:52:09,164
And so
I would really very much like to pursue 

816
00:52:13,281 --> 00:52:16,430
this idea of an online university.
And I've talked to many people about it,

817
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:17,803
but it's a very complex project and to a
large degree it's going to be dependent 

818
00:52:21,651 --> 00:52:24,830
on the state of my health.
When I'm healthy,

819
00:52:24,831 --> 00:52:28,550
I can do a very large number of things 
simultaneously and I'm very enthusiastic

820
00:52:28,551 --> 00:52:32,120
about them and very efficient.
But when I'm not,

821
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:33,013
it's,
it's.

822
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:34,063
I really wonder if I'm even going to be 
able to keep up the minimal 

823
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:40,550
responsibilities necessary to keep my 
life in order.

824
00:52:40,551 --> 00:52:42,620
And that's actually very terrifying 
thought.

825
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,960
So I'd love to do it,
you know,

826
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:46,813
and I would also say I'm starting it to 
some degree because I believe these 

827
00:52:50,511 --> 00:52:51,344
biblical lectures are crucial to the 
establishment of something like an on 

828
00:52:55,220 --> 00:53:00,220
line humanities university because I 
believe that like our culture is made up

829
00:53:01,911 --> 00:53:05,360
of strata of stories that might be a 
good way of thinking about it.

830
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:10,160
Like hierarchy,
the levels of stories and the base story

831
00:53:10,161 --> 00:53:10,994
is definitely the stories that are laid 
out in the Bible for better or for 

832
00:53:14,121 --> 00:53:17,450
worse.
And in order to understand our culture,

833
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,553
I think you have to have a grounding.
You have to be grounded in an 

834
00:53:21,381 --> 00:53:22,214
understanding of the Bible.
And I'm trying to make that as a 

835
00:53:26,311 --> 00:53:27,144
religious in some sense as possible.
Not necessarily because I believe that 

836
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:34,740
an a religious approach to the Bible is 
the most appropriate,

837
00:53:34,741 --> 00:53:35,574
but because I want to investigate it 
with the least amount of metaphysical 

838
00:53:39,301 --> 00:53:40,134
baggage possible.
And I'm hoping in that way to help 

839
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:47,430
people stabilize their identities.
To eliminate the idea of the development

840
00:53:47,431 --> 00:53:48,264
of the divine individual.
Which I think is Western culture is 

841
00:53:50,671 --> 00:53:54,090
glorious contribution to human 
civilization.

842
00:53:54,091 --> 00:53:56,670
And the thing that lifted us all out of 
slavery and,

843
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:58,010
and,
and,

844
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:58,933
and penury and serfdom and,
and all of those subordinate roles into 

845
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:09,450
the society of relatively free and 
autonomous individuals that we are today

846
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:10,693
and we can't let that doe and I think it
will go unless we have something very 

847
00:54:13,471 --> 00:54:15,330
strong metaphysically at the bottom.

848
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:16,493
I think we're weak without it because we
fractionate and everybody believes a 

849
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:21,990
thousand different things and it's sorta
like,

850
00:54:21,991 --> 00:54:23,880
you know,
you saw what happened to that.

851
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:28,170
Um,
Wall Street protest,

852
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,600
occupy Wall Street,
right?

853
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:30,443
I mean,
it's no wonder people were irritated 

854
00:54:32,431 --> 00:54:33,264
about what happened in 2008.
Although periodic financial collapses 

855
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:40,290
are pretty common and it isn't always 
obvious who to blame.

856
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:43,290
A lot of that was innovation driven as 
it turned out law.

857
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,513
Some of it was corruption,
but some of them was just unbridled 

858
00:54:46,621 --> 00:54:47,454
innovation.
And because like the mortgage tronches 

859
00:54:50,101 --> 00:54:53,790
were very brilliant in some sense,
but they had unexpected consequences.

860
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,190
But in any case,
you know,

861
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,590
there was a protest against the fact 
that,

862
00:54:58,950 --> 00:54:59,783
well,
the bulk of the catastrophe seemed to 

863
00:55:02,371 --> 00:55:04,980
fall on the poor,
which is of course always the case,

864
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,233
but there was no organization whatsoever
on the side of the Wall Street Occupy 

865
00:55:11,431 --> 00:55:12,590
Wall Street protesters.

866
00:55:12,590 --> 00:55:13,423
They,
they believed such a wide variety of 

867
00:55:14,941 --> 00:55:15,774
things that they are unable to to 
organize themselves in any effective 

868
00:55:19,021 --> 00:55:21,030
manner.
And basically as far as I can tell,

869
00:55:21,031 --> 00:55:25,110
all they did was go out and indicate 
that they were displeased.

870
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:30,530
But that's not a very effective strategy
because if you're displeased and even if

871
00:55:32,581 --> 00:55:35,100
you're displeased for a reason and a 
valid reason,

872
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,353
you still need to have some sense of 
what it would be that would rectify 

873
00:55:39,661 --> 00:55:41,310
that.
Because otherwise there's no.

874
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:46,180
There's no movement forward.
So anyway,

875
00:55:46,181 --> 00:55:48,360
so part of the reason I'm doing the 
biblical lectures,

876
00:55:48,361 --> 00:55:49,194
which I think are perhaps the most 
important thing I'm doing and I hope to 

877
00:55:52,321 --> 00:55:53,154
continue because of that is because I 
want to do whatever I can to give those 

878
00:55:57,541 --> 00:56:01,740
stories,
their due credit and to investigate very

879
00:56:01,741 --> 00:56:02,574
thoroughly the manner in which the 
literary imagination of Western 

880
00:56:06,841 --> 00:56:07,674
civilization that Judeo Christian 
tradition manifested itself to produce 

881
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:14,760
the idea of the autonomous invaluable 
individual.

882
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,100
Right?
Because that's our magic idea,

883
00:56:17,101 --> 00:56:17,934
man.
That's at the basis of everything that 

884
00:56:18,901 --> 00:56:19,734
we do.
So I guess I'm going to be contributing 

885
00:56:22,051 --> 00:56:26,200
to the online university in that manner.
I'm going to try the other,

886
00:56:26,201 --> 00:56:27,034
but I can't promise anything because for
the reasons that I already indicated we 

887
00:56:31,271 --> 00:56:32,104
were thinking of one tactic.
I don't know what you guys think about 

888
00:56:34,751 --> 00:56:37,960
this,
but I was thinking very interesting.

889
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:38,794
First course might be like a five hour 
introduction to the history of the 

890
00:56:42,971 --> 00:56:43,804
cosmos.
And so I was talking with my brother in 

891
00:56:45,821 --> 00:56:49,090
law who would be willing to fund some of
this along with me.

892
00:56:49,390 --> 00:56:50,223
Um,
and maybe with some crowdfunding we'd 

893
00:56:52,181 --> 00:56:55,000
like to host a competition.
You know,

894
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,133
so,
and the competition would be for the 

895
00:56:57,581 --> 00:57:01,720
best five,
our summary of the history of the cosmos

896
00:57:01,721 --> 00:57:02,554
from the Big Bang to the present and we 
would lay it wide open for people with 

897
00:57:07,961 --> 00:57:10,300
regards to what sort of technology they 
wanted to use,

898
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:13,930
whether it was animation or lecture or 
readings or whatever,

899
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:15,093
and to offer like a $10,000 first prize 
and a $5,000 second prize and a $3,000 

900
00:57:20,741 --> 00:57:22,090
third prize,
something like that.

901
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:24,700
And then maybe get people to vote on 
which,

902
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:26,830
um,
you know,

903
00:57:26,831 --> 00:57:29,350
which production was of the highest 
quality.

904
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,633
And because what should happen with the 
online university I think is that we 

905
00:57:34,931 --> 00:57:35,764
should set up a way of funding creative 
content producers instead of maybe 

906
00:57:40,121 --> 00:57:40,954
focusing on the content itself because 
there's thousands of people out there 

907
00:57:44,201 --> 00:57:46,940
who are very educated and who are 
perhaps even underemployed,

908
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:50,710
who have very specific expertise,
who could make courses.

909
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,800
And there's just no reason not to 
harness that.

910
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:57,850
And so anyways,
we've been thinking about it a lot,

911
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:00,540
but the bottom line is,
um,

912
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:06,130
how function light am or become over the
next while.

913
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:07,540
Because I'm certainly,
like I said,

914
00:58:07,541 --> 00:58:10,110
I'm only running at about five percent 
at the moment and it's,

915
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:11,110
uh,
it,

916
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,153
it stops me from certainly stops me from
enthusiastic tackling extraordinarily 

917
00:58:16,571 --> 00:58:19,240
difficult problems with starting an 
online university.

918
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:24,760
So I think the,
this year has taken a reasonable toll on

919
00:58:24,761 --> 00:58:25,594
me.
And also this dietary sensitivity issue 

920
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:31,930
is
complicated beyond belief.

921
00:58:31,931 --> 00:58:32,764
I can't really go out and eat and it's 
very difficult to travel and if I eat 

922
00:58:35,831 --> 00:58:36,664
the wrong thing,
I'm basically in some variant of health 

923
00:58:39,831 --> 00:58:41,170
for about a month.
So

924
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:44,500
anyhow,
we'll see.

925
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,030
We'll see how that all goes.

926
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:52,843
What do you make of the manosphere is 
claimed that women's liberation has led 

927
00:58:55,491 --> 00:58:56,324
to our weakened ability to pair bond,
the breakdown of the institution of 

928
00:58:59,421 --> 00:59:03,410
marriage and sexual inequity in favor of
Alpha men?

929
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:12,253
Well,
you know,

930
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:17,240
I guess probably I would say that to the
degree that all of that is true,

931
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,133
I wouldn't say that the Women's 
liberation movement is what's done it 

932
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,193
because I don't believe that the Women's
liberation movement is the primary 

933
00:59:26,751 --> 00:59:28,520
driver of Women's liberation.

934
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:34,920
In fact,
I think it's a secondary consequences of

935
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:35,793
far more radical biological revolution.
Now it's the invention of the birth 

936
00:59:39,961 --> 00:59:41,840
control pill,
right,

937
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:42,683
because the birth control pill 
essentially allowed females for the 

938
00:59:46,951 --> 00:59:47,784
first time in evolutionary history to 
gain voluntary control over the 

939
00:59:50,311 --> 00:59:55,311
reproductive function and a tremendous 
amount of political upheaval followed in

940
00:59:56,461 --> 01:00:00,870
the aftermath of that and you know,
people who are engaged in that political

941
01:00:00,871 --> 01:00:01,704
upheaval like to think about it as 
causal because they like to think that 

942
01:00:04,111 --> 01:00:04,944
their,
their efforts say on agitating in favor 

943
01:00:07,801 --> 01:00:08,634
of of women's equal rights.
It was actually the causal factor that 

944
01:00:12,451 --> 01:00:14,550
produced the sociological 
transformation.

945
01:00:14,551 --> 01:00:15,384
But I think the evidence for that is 
extraordinarily weak given me 

946
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:21,060
unbelievable magnitude of the birth 
control pill.

947
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:26,520
So with the birth control pill,
women become more like men,

948
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:27,983
much more like man.
And also it seems to be the case that 

949
01:00:31,411 --> 01:00:34,710
women on the birth control pill don't 
like masculine men as much.

950
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:36,840
There's studies showing that,
for example,

951
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:37,674
if you show women in the face of it are 
the same man at different or the same 

952
01:00:42,241 --> 01:00:43,074
men at different phases of their 
dilatory cycle and all you do is widen 

953
01:00:46,261 --> 01:00:49,350
the Gr,
narrow the job of the men that the women

954
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:52,680
are at the peak of their observation 
where they're maximally fertile like the

955
01:00:52,681 --> 01:00:55,730
wide jaw men better,
but when they're infertile,

956
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:58,830
they liked the narrow John mid better 
and wider jog.

957
01:00:58,831 --> 01:00:59,664
Men have higher levels of testosterone 
and and the pill mimics infertility and 

958
01:01:03,751 --> 01:01:06,540
so you know,
we don't know what these radical,

959
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:07,403
biological,
hormonal transformations have done to 

960
01:01:09,301 --> 01:01:12,850
the relationship between men and women 
and you know,

961
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:16,500
women too are trying to experiment with 
their new mode of being.

962
01:01:16,501 --> 01:01:17,334
It's like,
well now they're not destined at an 

963
01:01:18,961 --> 01:01:19,794
early age to become,
to transform themselves into mothers or 

964
01:01:23,251 --> 01:01:26,010
to be,
or to allow themselves to be transformed

965
01:01:26,011 --> 01:01:29,520
by nature into mother's even though it's
possible that they might be much happier

966
01:01:29,521 --> 01:01:30,354
if that happened.
I'm not saying that that's necessarily 

967
01:01:33,991 --> 01:01:34,824
the case,
but there is good evidence that women's 

968
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:40,500
general level of unhappiness has 
increased since the early 19 sixties.

969
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:41,813
So,

970
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:43,380
um,
you know,

971
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,760
anyways,
what has been the consequences of that?

972
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:50,643
Well,
the first consequence was wild sexual 

973
01:01:52,161 --> 01:01:55,910
experimentation and why not?
What would you expect?

974
01:01:55,911 --> 01:01:58,760
It's like all of a sudden reproductions 
under control.

975
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:02,480
What does that mean?
That women can be as promiscuous as men?

976
01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:05,330
Well,
maybe that's what it means.

977
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:06,223
We don't know.
So that was part of the big sixties 

978
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:09,433
experiment and it isn't the obviously 
obvious that that went particularly 

979
01:02:13,011 --> 01:02:13,844
well.

980
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:14,733
Um,

981
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:18,950
it certainly led to the pornography 
location of our society,

982
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:19,793
which I think is been,
I really think is actually quite 

983
01:02:21,331 --> 01:02:22,750
dreadful.
Um,

984
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:24,233
maybe that's my innate prudishness,
but I don't know what seems to me that 

985
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:31,110
pornography demeans the participants as 
well as the viewers.

986
01:02:31,111 --> 01:02:31,944
There's something second rate and 
furtive about it and I think that 

987
01:02:34,651 --> 01:02:37,570
everybody who engages in it knows that,
um,

988
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:38,611
it's,
it's,

989
01:02:38,611 --> 01:02:39,444
uh,
it's,

990
01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:42,180
it's an,
it's a substitute for the real adventure

991
01:02:42,181 --> 01:02:43,014
of life.
And I do think that it leads to a 

992
01:02:45,541 --> 01:02:48,900
certain kind of a,
perhaps contempt.

993
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:52,020
It leads to contempt,
I would say.

994
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:53,630
Um,
and,

995
01:02:53,830 --> 01:02:55,320
and that can't be a good thing.
I mean,

996
01:02:55,321 --> 01:02:56,154
I don't ever think,
and you guys can ask yourself this 

997
01:02:58,111 --> 01:03:03,111
question.
Have you ever met anybody who can finish

998
01:03:03,811 --> 01:03:04,644
masturbating and then was proud about it
and who stood up straighter because of 

999
01:03:08,041 --> 01:03:09,870
it?
If you felt that they'd really conquered

1000
01:03:09,871 --> 01:03:11,670
life as a consequence?

1001
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:13,860
I mean,
I just don't believe that that's the,

1002
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:19,470
that that's the general post 
masturbation feeling.

1003
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:21,480
I don't believe that.
I believe that it's,

1004
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:23,160
it's,
it's,

1005
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:26,090
it's like a,
it's something you do when you,

1006
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,093
when you don't have the right thing to 
do and it's an admission that you're a 

1007
01:03:29,941 --> 01:03:32,910
second player essentially.
Something like that.

1008
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:36,600
So the pornography location was a bad 
thing.

1009
01:03:37,070 --> 01:03:37,903
Um,
the fact that women's lives have been 

1010
01:03:43,771 --> 01:03:45,900
complicated too,
I would say buy this,

1011
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:46,763
buy this transformation to.
Because it isn't easy now for women to 

1012
01:03:51,001 --> 01:03:54,990
decide that they want to make being a 
mother a primary focus of their life.

1013
01:03:54,991 --> 01:03:59,991
Because increasingly it's necessary for 
families to have two incomes.

1014
01:04:00,091 --> 01:04:02,340
And I think the reason for that,
there's two reasons for that.

1015
01:04:02,341 --> 01:04:03,174
One is that when women started to flood 
into the labor market was approximately 

1016
01:04:06,991 --> 01:04:07,824
the same time that the market started to
open to places like India and China and 

1017
01:04:11,341 --> 01:04:13,350
working wages started to flatten.

1018
01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:14,543
But then you also have the fact that if 
you doubled the labor pool by 

1019
01:04:18,451 --> 01:04:19,284
introducing women into it,
perhaps you half the value of labor and 

1020
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:23,970
that might maybe do even worse than 
that.

1021
01:04:23,971 --> 01:04:24,804
If women are more agreeable and more 
likely to work part time and more 

1022
01:04:28,171 --> 01:04:31,470
willing to take lesser hours and lower 
pay,

1023
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:32,543
which seems to be the case,
then maybe you flatten the labor market 

1024
01:04:34,951 --> 01:04:39,951
even more so in terms of increasing 
sexual inequity in favor of Alpha Man.

1025
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:42,653
Well,
anything that Breaks Down Pair Bonding 

1026
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:48,810
matrimony is going to do that because,
um,

1027
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:50,123
you know,
sexual access for males is a prieto 

1028
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:53,373
distributed phenomena where a small 
proportion of the males get most of the 

1029
01:04:57,810 --> 01:04:59,170
invitations,
let's say.

1030
01:04:59,171 --> 01:05:02,130
And the thing that is a bulwark against 
that is,

1031
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:03,053
is monogamy.
And part of the reason that societies 

1032
01:05:05,191 --> 01:05:06,024
are set up to be monogamous is so that 
that proclivity is controlled because 

1033
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:15,060
it's not good for children,
let's say if,

1034
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:16,043
if they don't have access to a and it's 
not good for women if they're all 

1035
01:05:19,451 --> 01:05:20,284
competing for the same man and then it's
not good for the men who aren't being 

1036
01:05:22,571 --> 01:05:24,790
chosen because they're not being chosen.

1037
01:05:24,850 --> 01:05:29,850
And so that just seems to be a recipe 
for resentment and,

1038
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,490
and,
and aggression.

1039
01:05:33,491 --> 01:05:36,280
And I think the evolutionary psychology 
data on that,

1040
01:05:36,281 --> 01:05:38,270
it's pretty clear.
So

1041
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:41,013
that's what I would say.
I don't think it's the women's 

1042
01:05:43,751 --> 01:05:45,630
liberation,
it's the birth control pill.

1043
01:05:45,631 --> 01:05:47,160
And um,
you know,

1044
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:50,980
don't underestimate the significance of 
the birth control pill.

1045
01:05:50,981 --> 01:05:53,860
It's like the hydrogen bomb or that or 
the computer chip.

1046
01:05:53,861 --> 01:05:58,861
It's a world revolutionary technology.
And for all we know it might do us in,

1047
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:00,760
you know,
I mean in the West,

1048
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:04,010
the birth rate is far below replacement.
And you know,

1049
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:07,210
that's as a,
as a multigenerational strategy.

1050
01:06:07,211 --> 01:06:09,160
That's just,
that's an absolute dead end.

1051
01:06:09,161 --> 01:06:11,740
And of course,
no one can talk about that because,

1052
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:13,143
well,
for obvious the obvious reasons of 

1053
01:06:14,591 --> 01:06:17,350
egalitarianism and diversity and all of 
that,

1054
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:21,370
but the declining birth rate in the West
is really,

1055
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:22,653
I would say a catastrophe.
I don't have to be one of those people 

1056
01:06:26,641 --> 01:06:28,720
who think the planet has too many people
on it,

1057
01:06:28,721 --> 01:06:29,554
you know.
So

1058
01:06:33,850 --> 01:06:34,683
you have said that the humanity become 
corrupt and for a person to avoid the 

1059
01:06:38,921 --> 01:06:43,150
dangers of the postmodern,
neo Marxist ideologies and not enroll.

1060
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:44,373
Would you agree the same applies to the 
institute of marriage with laws as they 

1061
01:06:47,441 --> 01:06:48,274
are?

1062
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,950
No,
I wouldn't say that.

1063
01:06:56,900 --> 01:06:59,870
I guess partly because I don't 
understand what the alternative is.

1064
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:00,733
I mean,
first I would say that to the degree 

1065
01:07:01,911 --> 01:07:02,744
that men are just your unjustly upset 
about the way the marriage laws are set 

1066
01:07:06,741 --> 01:07:08,900
up and I think they have reason to be 
concerned,

1067
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:10,213
especially with regards to the custody 
of children and the probability of 

1068
01:07:13,011 --> 01:07:13,844
paying virtually endless alimony with 
unbelievably severe penalties for 

1069
01:07:18,381 --> 01:07:19,214
failure.
I think that it's incumbent on men to 

1070
01:07:21,711 --> 01:07:25,100
organize themselves politically and 
rectify that.

1071
01:07:25,101 --> 01:07:27,830
And so I don't think that the answer is 
avoiding marriage.

1072
01:07:27,831 --> 01:07:28,664
I think the answer is political 
organization and pressure on the right 

1073
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:35,780
institutions to rectify this because it 
needs to be rectified.

1074
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:37,093
And I don't like the idea of telling 
young men to avoid permanent 

1075
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:45,320
relationships with women because as far 
as I'm concerned,

1076
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,500
this is my traditional wisdom.
I suppose manifesting itself.

1077
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,890
There aren't that many pathways to life.
You know,

1078
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:54,140
you need a career,
you need,

1079
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:57,170
you need an interesting things to do 
with your,

1080
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:01,220
with your time outside of your career,
interesting and meaningful things.

1081
01:08:01,221 --> 01:08:02,054
You need a family,
you need an intimate relationship to 

1082
01:08:04,371 --> 01:08:07,640
twine yourself together with someone 
else so that well,

1083
01:08:07,641 --> 01:08:08,474
so that you're protected during times of
crisis and able to celebrate during 

1084
01:08:12,411 --> 01:08:14,110
times of joy and,
and,

1085
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:19,340
and so you set up a stable structure so 
that you can have children and have them

1086
01:08:20,001 --> 01:08:25,001
feel secure and unable to play.
And like that's life man.

1087
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:25,963
And if you miss any of that,
then your life is fragmented and 

1088
01:08:29,841 --> 01:08:31,400
fractured it and you're going to be 
hurt.

1089
01:08:31,401 --> 01:08:35,420
And I'm not saying that's absolutely 
true for every single person.

1090
01:08:35,421 --> 01:08:36,254
There's always exceptions,
but I'm concerned with the bulk of 

1091
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:39,614
people and the and what the bulk of 
people have already done and like your 

1092
01:08:43,941 --> 01:08:46,460
life just isn't in some ways that 
complicated.

1093
01:08:46,670 --> 01:08:47,503
You need to bear a social weight,
you need to have a family and commit 

1094
01:08:51,321 --> 01:08:54,830
yourself to that and it's in those 
commitments that you find the meaning in

1095
01:08:54,831 --> 01:08:59,831
your life and so if you don't have them 
then while you float and drift and,

1096
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:01,483
and when people float and drift,
they usually don't float somewhere good 

1097
01:09:04,191 --> 01:09:05,024
and they usually drift somewhere bad.
So I think that there are problems with 

1098
01:09:11,061 --> 01:09:14,570
the way the marriage laws are set up.
I think they're quite serious.

1099
01:09:14,571 --> 01:09:16,370
I don't think.
I do think that they

1100
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:18,793
persecute men often,
but I don't think the answer to that is 

1101
01:09:21,651 --> 01:09:22,484
to tell young men to avoid permanent 
relationships with young women at all 

1102
01:09:26,211 --> 01:09:27,044
costs because that isn't very anti life 
doctrine and it's a cure that's worse 

1103
01:09:31,401 --> 01:09:34,340
than the disease.
That's what I would say.

1104
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,850
I'm beginning to sort myself out.
Thanks to you.

1105
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:42,953
While I'm very glad to hear that.
I have a question about scheduling your 

1106
01:09:45,661 --> 01:09:46,494
time trying to make a schedule and a 
chaotic job with constantly changing 

1107
01:09:51,001 --> 01:09:55,890
shifts and hours tips,
or should I find a new job altogether?

1108
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,550
Well,
you know,

1109
01:09:59,850 --> 01:10:00,590
I don't,

1110
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:01,423
I can't answer that Josh because I don't
know enough about the details of your 

1111
01:10:04,611 --> 01:10:06,380
life,
but what I would say,

1112
01:10:06,381 --> 01:10:08,780
and maybe you've tried this already,
is you know,

1113
01:10:09,410 --> 01:10:11,390
try to make two plans.
Okay.

1114
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:12,613
Because when you're,
when you're trying to think something 

1115
01:10:14,031 --> 01:10:16,520
like this through,
you need to think it through in detail.

1116
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:22,020
And so one plan would be how you would 
conduct your life optimally and organize

1117
01:10:22,701 --> 01:10:23,534
your time if you kept your current job 
and you want to make that as acceptable 

1118
01:10:27,621 --> 01:10:28,454
and positive as possible and then make 
out another plan where you shift jobs 

1119
01:10:31,971 --> 01:10:32,804
and you have no,
maybe a more stable working arrangement 

1120
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:39,380
and then think about what your life 
would be like if you had that.

1121
01:10:39,381 --> 01:10:42,440
And then because you've laid out a 
detailed map of both,

1122
01:10:42,441 --> 01:10:44,390
you're in a much better position to 
compare them.

1123
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:46,480
And so,
um,

1124
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,610
you know,
you might need to talk to somebody about

1125
01:10:49,611 --> 01:10:50,030
that too.

1126
01:10:50,030 --> 01:10:54,470
But that's what I would recommend 
because it's just too complicated a job,

1127
01:10:54,471 --> 01:10:55,304
like if you find that your sleep is 
chronically disrupted and you can 

1128
01:10:58,581 --> 01:11:02,390
organize your life,
the fact that shift changes,

1129
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:06,380
no trivial thing and it can really throw
your mood regulation for a loop too.

1130
01:11:06,381 --> 01:11:07,810
And I don't know if that's happening to 
you,

1131
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:08,683
not,
but that's also something else that's 

1132
01:11:09,531 --> 01:11:14,531
worth taking into consideration.
But I say map out an alternative reality

1133
01:11:15,781 --> 01:11:19,350
where you don't have those problems and 
see how much better that looks,

1134
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:20,293
you know,
I presume there's some advantages to 

1135
01:11:21,601 --> 01:11:22,434
your current job.
So when it also depends on what your 

1136
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:25,404
options are,
like how hard would it be for you to 

1137
01:11:27,181 --> 01:11:29,280
find another job and couldn't find a 
job.

1138
01:11:29,281 --> 01:11:32,640
Like maybe the best thing to do would be
to try to find a job that's better,

1139
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:35,200
that doesn't have shifts,
you know,

1140
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:38,550
and maybe that'll take you a year or two
that can be very difficult,

1141
01:11:38,551 --> 01:11:41,280
but you know,
a year or two,

1142
01:11:41,850 --> 01:11:44,280
is it a shorter period of time?
Often that it seemed.

1143
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:47,310
So that's what I would recommend.
So

1144
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:58,140
your idea of realer than real appears to
parallel Plato's theory of the forms.

1145
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:02,700
Is this the source of the idea or are 
you reconceived and ancient philosophy?

1146
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:04,433
Well,
God only knows what the source of an 

1147
01:12:05,581 --> 01:12:06,780
idea is,
you know,

1148
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:08,260
um,
um,

1149
01:12:08,700 --> 01:12:09,533
my sense of plato's forms was it was 
that they weren't exactly narrative 

1150
01:12:13,741 --> 01:12:16,440
instructure,
although I think that I think that there

1151
01:12:16,441 --> 01:12:17,274
isn't at least an analogous relationship
between the idea of archetypes and the 

1152
01:12:21,301 --> 01:12:23,190
idea of formed.
Um,

1153
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:28,180
I think plato was talking more about 
forms of,

1154
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:30,370
of tangible objects in the world,
you know,

1155
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:34,410
where I'm talking more about permanent 
patterns of behavior,

1156
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:36,150
you know,
because

1157
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:40,913
what are,
what our culture is essentially is a 

1158
01:12:42,541 --> 01:12:46,350
dance of permanent patterns of behavior.
I mean,

1159
01:12:46,410 --> 01:12:48,250
there's a fair bit of variability in 
the,

1160
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:49,153
in the patterns.
Like there is variability in a 

1161
01:12:51,061 --> 01:12:53,790
basketball game or a soccer game or 
something like that.

1162
01:12:53,850 --> 01:12:54,683
You know,
there's obviously predictability and 

1163
01:12:56,041 --> 01:12:57,570
variability,
but,

1164
01:12:57,571 --> 01:13:01,200
um,
what's the predictable elements are the,

1165
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:04,320
or equivalent in some sense to the 
platonic forms,

1166
01:13:04,321 --> 01:13:05,154
which is the point that you're making.
And it's the discovery of those more 

1167
01:13:08,970 --> 01:13:13,970
permanent forms that emerges as a 
consequence of the spinning of stories,

1168
01:13:16,351 --> 01:13:17,184
you know,
because we're watching each other 

1169
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:18,894
constantly and we're articulating what 
we see and then we're amalgamating the 

1170
01:13:22,861 --> 01:13:25,590
articulations and we're sifting them 
for,

1171
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:28,800
for fundamental patterns.
And like a good example of that.

1172
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:29,773
It's something that I just recently 
discovered when I did the biblical 

1173
01:13:31,531 --> 01:13:33,660
lectures on Abraham.
You know,

1174
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:38,100
I didn't understand that Abraham was a 
late bloomer.

1175
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:38,933
You know,
he was like the guy who stayed in his 

1176
01:13:40,021 --> 01:13:41,700
mother's basement for too long.
I mean,

1177
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:45,660
he's 75 when God calls him on an 
adventure.

1178
01:13:45,661 --> 01:13:50,661
And God basically tells him to leave his
family and his countrymen in his kinsmen

1179
01:13:51,031 --> 01:13:54,270
and to go into the land of the stranger.
And that's.

1180
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:58,680
See there's an archetypal pattern there.
And the pattern is,

1181
01:13:58,740 --> 01:13:59,573
well,
it's the pattern of the call and it's 

1182
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:05,790
deeply,
it's something that people experienced,

1183
01:14:05,791 --> 01:14:07,050
you know,
like an adolescent,

1184
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:08,473
healthy adolescent wants to get away 
from his or her stultifying a dependent 

1185
01:14:16,601 --> 01:14:19,540
upbringing and go out into the world of 
adventure.

1186
01:14:19,541 --> 01:14:22,690
And you know,
in the biblical stories that's,

1187
01:14:22,870 --> 01:14:27,870
that's symbolically represented as 
something akin to a divine call,

1188
01:14:28,511 --> 01:14:29,344
which,
which I think is quite interesting 

1189
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,630
because you know,
we don't understand these calls,

1190
01:14:34,631 --> 01:14:36,400
you know,
you have an impulse to do something.

1191
01:14:36,401 --> 01:14:37,960
Something captures your interest.

1192
01:14:37,990 --> 01:14:39,790
Something captures your motivation.
It's,

1193
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:42,190
it's not like it's self generated.
Exactly.

1194
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:44,560
You know,
the,

1195
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:45,433
the idea that the call to adventure is 
produced by something like a 

1196
01:14:48,311 --> 01:14:51,340
transcendent deity is a really 
interesting idea.

1197
01:14:51,370 --> 01:14:53,000
Now.
It depends on what you mean by data.

1198
01:14:53,001 --> 01:14:53,834
You know,
you can think about it as an ancient 

1199
01:14:54,911 --> 01:14:56,350
brain circuit,
I suppose,

1200
01:14:56,351 --> 01:14:58,960
although I don't know if that really 
makes it things any clearer,

1201
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:04,330
but there is an impulse within people 
that pulls them out into the world to go

1202
01:15:04,331 --> 01:15:05,164
away from their safe circumstances and 
to make their fortunate where there's 

1203
01:15:08,891 --> 01:15:09,724
famine and tyranny and,
and threats to the integrity of the 

1204
01:15:12,431 --> 01:15:13,264
family,
which are all things that Abraham 

1205
01:15:14,171 --> 01:15:16,360
immediately encounters when he listens 
to God.

1206
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:17,823
And so that seems to be something like 
something that's realer than real 

1207
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:22,833
because everyone experiences that to 
some degree or everyone can relate to 

1208
01:15:26,141 --> 01:15:26,974
it.
It's a deep,

1209
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:27,843
deep theme and you know,
what I'm looking for in the biblical 

1210
01:15:31,931 --> 01:15:34,990
stories,
in other mythological representations is

1211
01:15:34,991 --> 01:15:35,824
these deep universal themes.
Now is that a reconceptualization of 

1212
01:15:40,451 --> 01:15:43,360
ancient philosophy?
It's really hard to say because,

1213
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:45,520
you know,
I derived the idea of the archetype,

1214
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:46,383
at least in part from reading new and 
young of course was influenced because 

1215
01:15:50,291 --> 01:15:52,660
he had a great classical education by 
the ancients.

1216
01:15:52,661 --> 01:15:55,690
And so exactly where these ideas come 
from isn't clear.

1217
01:15:56,170 --> 01:15:57,003
So,
um,

1218
01:15:58,540 --> 01:16:02,920
so I guess that's pretty much all I have
to say about that.

1219
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:22,350
Nothing motivates me aside from eating 
and sleeping.

1220
01:16:22,351 --> 01:16:24,930
I lie in my bed all day,
no one on my computer,

1221
01:16:24,931 --> 01:16:26,550
not on my phone,
not doing anything.

1222
01:16:26,551 --> 01:16:29,160
I just lie there thinking what's 
happening to me.

1223
01:16:29,940 --> 01:16:34,230
I would say that you are,
and this is not a diagnostic comment and

1224
01:16:34,231 --> 01:16:36,840
I don't know enough about you to provide
that sort of information,

1225
01:16:36,841 --> 01:16:41,841
but I would recommend that you see a 
therapist and be screened for depression

1226
01:16:42,301 --> 01:16:46,470
because that's what it looks like to me.
And I would say that if it's depression,

1227
01:16:46,471 --> 01:16:49,800
you should do something about it because
depression is very hard on people.

1228
01:16:49,801 --> 01:16:50,634
It produces a lot of stress hormones 
like cortisol and that can hurt you in 

1229
01:16:54,540 --> 01:16:54,961
May,
you know,

1230
01:16:54,961 --> 01:16:57,270
if it's only been a couple of days I 
wouldn't worry about it.

1231
01:16:57,271 --> 01:17:00,450
But if it's a chronic pattern then you 
should go talk to somebody,

1232
01:17:00,451 --> 01:17:02,030
even your family doctor,
you know,

1233
01:17:02,031 --> 01:17:06,000
and there's always the possibility that 
a low dose of an antidepressant might be

1234
01:17:06,001 --> 01:17:07,180
worth trying,
you know,

1235
01:17:07,190 --> 01:17:08,490
in a month if it fixed you.

1236
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:11,510
But I would say don't,
don't stay in that situation,

1237
01:17:11,511 --> 01:17:12,650
man.
Go,

1238
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:15,320
go find out,
do whatever you have to do to get out of

1239
01:17:15,321 --> 01:17:16,154
it.
And especially the fact that you're not 

1240
01:17:17,451 --> 01:17:19,880
on your computer and no one on your 
phone not doing anything,

1241
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:20,570
you know,
you're,

1242
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:21,403
you're ruminating,
that's just lying there thinking that's 

1243
01:17:23,570 --> 01:17:27,020
loops of negative emotion and you don't 
have any positive emotion,

1244
01:17:27,021 --> 01:17:27,854
you know,
that's why you're not on your computer 

1245
01:17:28,941 --> 01:17:29,774
or your phone.
And so one of the characteristics of 

1246
01:17:32,181 --> 01:17:33,014
depression or I suppose to have the 
characteristics is a decrease in 

1247
01:17:35,451 --> 01:17:36,284
positive motivation.
And so that means that you're not 

1248
01:17:38,061 --> 01:17:38,894
interested in anything and an increase 
in negative emotion and that can 

1249
01:17:41,451 --> 01:17:45,140
manifest itself in that I'm just lying 
there thinking,

1250
01:17:45,170 --> 01:17:48,680
you know,
so go talk to someone,

1251
01:17:49,010 --> 01:17:51,650
go talk to someone,
tell someone that this is happening,

1252
01:17:51,890 --> 01:17:54,770
gift to your family doctor,
let them know what's happening,

1253
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:57,950
get them to give you a depression 
screening and uh,

1254
01:17:58,270 --> 01:17:59,103
and see what you can do about it because
there are effective treatments for 

1255
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:03,223
depression.
And sometimes antidepressants work like 

1256
01:18:04,791 --> 01:18:06,680
a absolute charm

1257
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:13,460
to tap into the dopaminergic system.
You said you needed to value goal.

1258
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,650
Is there any way to tap into the opioid 
system?

1259
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:19,790
I want to be more connected to people,
but part of me can't get myself to care.

1260
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:21,141
Okay.
Well,

1261
01:18:21,141 --> 01:18:21,974
one of the things that,
so maybe you're a little bit on the 

1262
01:18:23,961 --> 01:18:25,940
disagreeable side,
that's a possibility.

1263
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:27,103
There's some interesting clinical 
evidence that suggests that one of the 

1264
01:18:30,530 --> 01:18:31,363
things that disagreeable people can do 
in order to facilitate their 

1265
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:37,880
interactions with other people is to do 
people favors.

1266
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:42,560
And so what you might say is that you 
could start by acting like you care.

1267
01:18:43,130 --> 01:18:46,400
And then maybe you could learn how to 
care through doing that,

1268
01:18:46,401 --> 01:18:47,234
so maybe you could say,
well I'm going to do something nice for 

1269
01:18:49,221 --> 01:18:52,480
someone once every two days for a month 
and,

1270
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:54,770
and think about it a little bit and see 
what,

1271
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,680
see if that changes you because you 
know,

1272
01:18:57,681 --> 01:18:58,514
sometimes you think yourself into change
and sometimes you act yourself into 

1273
01:19:01,761 --> 01:19:02,594
changing your thoughts.
And so that's what I would start by 

1274
01:19:06,141 --> 01:19:08,210
doing.
And you know,

1275
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:14,020
you could also be more connected to 
people regardless of whether you care,

1276
01:19:14,121 --> 01:19:14,954
you know,
let's say that it would take you six 

1277
01:19:16,071 --> 01:19:20,150
months of practice or even a year of 
practice before you cared.

1278
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:23,030
But that's not so long,
especially if you're young.

1279
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:24,373
So

1280
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:27,580
that's what I say about that.

1281
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:43,130
Do we know if Dr Peterson has just been 
overrun by his emails?

1282
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:44,233
I thought he would find meaningful,
but people are telling me it's unlikely 

1283
01:19:46,671 --> 01:19:47,780
to leave and see it.
So.

1284
01:19:47,781 --> 01:19:48,920
Oh,
well I guess,

1285
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:52,550
yeah.
Well I'm so overwhelmed by my email that

1286
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:55,130
it's just unbelievable.
I mean,

1287
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:56,423
I,
I probably have 10,000 emails that are 

1288
01:19:58,341 --> 01:20:01,310
unanswered and you know,
at some point I just,

1289
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:05,450
I wouldn't say exactly that I gave up,
but that's close enough,

1290
01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:06,723
you know,
I'm trying to respond to the ones that 

1291
01:20:07,981 --> 01:20:10,620
will destroy my life if I don't respond 
to them,

1292
01:20:10,650 --> 01:20:13,450
but,
and it's really sad because um,

1293
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:17,010
people are sending me really good 
letters and I've been trying to think of

1294
01:20:17,011 --> 01:20:17,844
a method of having someone go through my
email to identify the letters that are 

1295
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:23,573
unbelievably help,
heartfelt and valuable because it's a 

1296
01:20:26,071 --> 01:20:27,780
shame to miss them.
But,

1297
01:20:28,010 --> 01:20:31,110
um,
I just haven't had any choice,

1298
01:20:31,510 --> 01:20:32,343
you know,
basically except when I'm not feeling 

1299
01:20:34,681 --> 01:20:34,920
well.

1300
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:35,461
Like,
no,

1301
01:20:35,461 --> 01:20:40,170
I'm basically working from seven in the 
morning til 11 at night trying to finish

1302
01:20:40,171 --> 01:20:42,660
my book,
which I have to page proofs for now.

1303
01:20:42,661 --> 01:20:47,550
So that's getting closer to keep,
to keep up with my obligations,

1304
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:48,863
including making the videos and I'm 
preparing the biblical lectures and 

1305
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:57,560
trying to zip here and there and talk.
So I'm very sorry that to all of you.

1306
01:21:00,331 --> 01:21:01,164
I'm sure that many of you have written 
me letters and that you've put a lot of 

1307
01:21:03,631 --> 01:21:05,950
heart and soul into them and thanking 
me.

1308
01:21:05,951 --> 01:21:08,110
You were describing a problem that you 
have or,

1309
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:13,230
or a solution that you've generated or 
ideas and I really feel bad that I can't

1310
01:21:13,381 --> 01:21:14,730
answer them,
but I can't.

1311
01:21:14,731 --> 01:21:16,920
So at some point you just think,
well,

1312
01:21:16,921 --> 01:21:18,450
that's just how it goes.
You know,

1313
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:19,313
you're,
you can't do what you can do when 

1314
01:21:21,151 --> 01:21:24,450
there's no sense being overwhelmingly 
tormented by it.

1315
01:21:24,451 --> 01:21:25,540
So,
um,

1316
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:27,510
that's,
that's the situation.

1317
01:21:27,511 --> 01:21:30,090
So please don't take it personally.
So

1318
01:21:57,950 --> 01:21:58,783
Dr Peterson,
I am considering going into the 

1319
01:22:00,141 --> 01:22:00,974
education stream slash system.
Do you have any advice for me not to 

1320
01:22:05,121 --> 01:22:07,880
become a mouthpiece for indoctrinating 
young students?

1321
01:22:09,470 --> 01:22:10,303
Well,
one thing I would recommend is that you 

1322
01:22:13,461 --> 01:22:15,770
don't write essays that you don't 
believe in.

1323
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:17,743
I think that's a sin.
I think it's a sin to use your words 

1324
01:22:21,390 --> 01:22:23,060
falsely.
And the reason for that,

1325
01:22:23,080 --> 01:22:27,110
like there's a good series of social 
psychology experiments that show,

1326
01:22:27,111 --> 01:22:27,944
like imagine that you bring someone into
a lab and you have them write an essay 

1327
01:22:31,611 --> 01:22:34,940
about or fill out a questionnaire about 
their political opinions,

1328
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:35,793
you know,
so you get a baseline measure of their 

1329
01:22:37,071 --> 01:22:40,520
political stance and then you ask them 
to write a thousand words,

1330
01:22:40,550 --> 01:22:41,383
maybe they identify as right wing,
and then you get them to write a 

1331
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:48,140
thousand word essay on why a particular 
left wing position is true.

1332
01:22:48,710 --> 01:22:49,543
And then you have them come back in two 
weeks and you give them the same 

1333
01:22:52,011 --> 01:22:52,844
political belief questionnaire they'll 
tell have shifted quite radically 

1334
01:22:55,881 --> 01:22:56,930
towards the left.

1335
01:22:57,350 --> 01:22:58,183
And the reason for that is that people 
don't think through their positions in 

1336
01:23:01,431 --> 01:23:02,264
great detail.
And so if you get them to think through 

1337
01:23:04,990 --> 01:23:05,823
a contrary position in great detail,
then that starts to become more 

1338
01:23:08,741 --> 01:23:09,574
convincing.
And so if you go into a field like 

1339
01:23:11,501 --> 01:23:12,820
education,
that's really,

1340
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:17,590
I'm pathologically overrun by the 
postmodern,

1341
01:23:17,591 --> 01:23:18,424
neo Marxist types.
You're going to experience a tremendous 

1342
01:23:21,071 --> 01:23:23,110
amount of pressure to falsify your 
words.

1343
01:23:23,111 --> 01:23:24,940
You're going to be afraid that if you 
don't do that,

1344
01:23:24,941 --> 01:23:29,941
you're going to fail and maybe sometimes
you will be punished by a professor,

1345
01:23:29,981 --> 01:23:30,814
but I would say in most circumstances,
I'm still optimistic enough to believe 

1346
01:23:33,671 --> 01:23:37,480
that if you write a good essay that 
isn't ideologically proper,

1347
01:23:37,481 --> 01:23:38,314
you'll still get a good grade.
I guess I would say if you write a good 

1348
01:23:40,691 --> 01:23:43,750
essay that's not ideologically proper 
and you do get a good grade,

1349
01:23:43,751 --> 01:23:45,610
that's probably a good time to fight.

1350
01:23:46,510 --> 01:23:48,910
So because you either fight or 
capitulate,

1351
01:23:48,911 --> 01:23:49,744
right?
That's,

1352
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,480
that's the.
That's the hard truth.

1353
01:23:52,481 --> 01:23:53,314
So I'm not saying it would be easy and I
would also say don't make unnecessary 

1354
01:23:58,181 --> 01:23:59,014
enemies,
right?

1355
01:23:59,020 --> 01:24:01,000
You don't.
Everything doesn't have to be a battle,

1356
01:24:01,001 --> 01:24:03,460
but now and then you're going to know 
that you know,

1357
01:24:03,461 --> 01:24:07,450
you'll hate writing the essay because 
you have to sacrifice your soul in order

1358
01:24:07,451 --> 01:24:10,120
to put the words down and then you,
you,

1359
01:24:10,230 --> 01:24:14,470
you demand to warp your character and 
you just don't recover easily from that.

1360
01:24:14,471 --> 01:24:16,420
So I would say,
don't do that,

1361
01:24:16,421 --> 01:24:17,770
man.
That's not good.

1362
01:24:26,170 --> 01:24:27,003
Have you ever dressed professor Kevin?
Mcdonald's work on an ethnic conflict 

1363
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:32,620
theory of Judaism as a group,
evolutionary strategy,

1364
01:24:32,621 --> 01:24:35,800
visa vi gentile societies.
It's very provocative,

1365
01:24:35,801 --> 01:24:39,190
but I find much of it persuasive.
Have you read any of his work?

1366
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:42,070
This is going to be a very disappointing
answer.

1367
01:24:42,071 --> 01:24:46,360
I'm afraid because the answer is no.
I haven't read any of his work,

1368
01:24:46,361 --> 01:24:51,140
so I'm afraid I'm not going to be able 
to answer that question unfortunately,

1369
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:52,990
so apologies for that.

1370
01:24:59,830 --> 01:25:00,663
I've definitely.
I've recently developed a nasty case of 

1371
01:25:02,291 --> 01:25:05,470
hypno phobia and generally suffer from 
anxiety surrounding sleep.

1372
01:25:05,471 --> 01:25:07,840
It's become a significant negative force
in my life,

1373
01:25:07,870 --> 01:25:08,703
cause unknown.
I'm rather well put together and 

1374
01:25:10,421 --> 01:25:13,060
successful across many domains.
Any advice?

1375
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:15,370
Yes,
go to bed later.

1376
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:17,073
So one of the things that happens to 
people when they're having a hard time 

1377
01:25:19,811 --> 01:25:21,730
going to sleep and their sleep is 
disrupted,

1378
01:25:21,731 --> 01:25:22,564
is that they tend to go to bed earlier 
to catch up on their sleep and that 

1379
01:25:25,271 --> 01:25:26,104
actually has a counter that's cut that 
works at counter purposes to what 

1380
01:25:30,581 --> 01:25:31,414
they're trying to attempt.
What you want to do is delay your sleep 

1381
01:25:34,301 --> 01:25:37,060
until you're really quite tired.
So stay up much later.

1382
01:25:37,061 --> 01:25:38,830
Get up at the same time in the morning 
game,

1383
01:25:38,831 --> 01:25:39,664
but move your sleep time later,
maybe half an hour night until you 

1384
01:25:42,911 --> 01:25:44,780
actually do fall asleep.
Um,

1385
01:25:45,070 --> 01:25:49,450
the other thing that you could look into
is that there are relaxation exercises.

1386
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:50,553
Behavior therapists offer those,
but I'm sure you could find one online 

1387
01:25:53,001 --> 01:25:53,834
and breathing exercise.
And so often what you do is imagine 

1388
01:25:56,561 --> 01:25:57,394
you're laying in your bed and you're 
nervous and so what you do is you 

1389
01:26:00,161 --> 01:26:00,994
concentrate on your feet and you flex 
your and then breathe in and out and 

1390
01:26:05,361 --> 01:26:06,194
relax them.
And then you flex your ankles or the 

1391
01:26:08,271 --> 01:26:09,104
soles of your feet and,
and breathe in and out and relax and do 

1392
01:26:12,831 --> 01:26:13,664
that with every muscle group all the way
up your body and remember to breathe 

1393
01:26:17,181 --> 01:26:20,270
deeply and regularly and that can help 
regulate your anxiety.

1394
01:26:20,330 --> 01:26:24,590
So I would say stay up later till you're
clearly tired.

1395
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:27,950
The other thing you might try and 
sleeping in a different room.

1396
01:26:29,570 --> 01:26:30,403
And then the final thing is there aren't
pretty effective sleep medications like 

1397
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:37,520
Zappos for example.
It just seems to be pretty effective.

1398
01:26:37,521 --> 01:26:39,770
And if you're really having a hard time 
sleeping,

1399
01:26:39,771 --> 01:26:44,150
maybe you could try something like that 
and see if it and see if it helps.

1400
01:26:44,151 --> 01:26:44,984
You don't have to try it forever.
But so the simplest thing to do though 

1401
01:26:48,171 --> 01:26:49,004
is to go to bed later and because you'll
be more tired and more likely to fall 

1402
01:26:51,771 --> 01:26:52,604
asleep then,
and it's really not going to cause you 

1403
01:26:53,871 --> 01:26:56,240
any trouble.
So that's what I recommend.

1404
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:19,370
What do we do once our ego has helped us
plan the dominance hierarchy to secure a

1405
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:20,213
mate?
Why then should we keep looking for a 

1406
01:27:21,621 --> 01:27:25,040
mate and how to curtail that instinct?
Well,

1407
01:27:25,041 --> 01:27:28,670
I think part of the way that you curtail
that in state is that you have,

1408
01:27:29,390 --> 01:27:31,700
you have this sort of life that you 
would have with a mate.

1409
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:35,460
The question is,
what's the purpose of pair bonding?

1410
01:27:35,461 --> 01:27:38,180
And one of the fundamental purposes of 
pair bonding,

1411
01:27:38,210 --> 01:27:38,961
well,
there's a couple.

1412
01:27:38,961 --> 01:27:39,794
One is that it solves the sexual access 
problems so that you don't have to 

1413
01:27:43,220 --> 01:27:47,320
continue to obsess about who you're 
going to be within and,

1414
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:48,390
and,
and,

1415
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:50,120
and where,
and how.

1416
01:27:50,450 --> 01:27:52,670
And so you can get on with other 
elements of your life,

1417
01:27:52,671 --> 01:27:54,650
but I mean with,
with your meat,

1418
01:27:54,651 --> 01:27:55,484
you have to decide what,
what does it mean that you're now 

1419
01:27:56,811 --> 01:27:58,370
together,
you know,

1420
01:27:58,371 --> 01:27:59,720
what year it was,
companionship.

1421
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:02,690
Obviously in friendship and their shared
interests,

1422
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:03,553
you have to decide what they are and I 
would say that you should continue 

1423
01:28:05,811 --> 01:28:06,644
dating your,
your partner at least once a week or 

1424
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:12,500
perhaps twice a week because otherwise 
the romance goes out of your life.

1425
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:13,693
But then also you have to decide about 
children and and eventually about 

1426
01:28:17,030 --> 01:28:20,180
grandchildren because you know you're 
going to get them old and new.

1427
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:21,153
You're going to get older and more 
mature and children are a huge part of 

1428
01:28:23,811 --> 01:28:27,260
life and they get a bad rap.
Which is really unfortunate because,

1429
01:28:27,590 --> 01:28:30,510
you know,
maybe I'm different in this regard.

1430
01:28:30,620 --> 01:28:31,453
Perhaps I am to some degree,
but I never regretted having kids for 

1431
01:28:34,041 --> 01:28:36,920
even one second because there are so 
mean.

1432
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:40,940
All of a sudden you have an intimate 
relationship with new people.

1433
01:28:40,941 --> 01:28:43,820
That is as close as any relationship 
that you've ever had.

1434
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:48,110
You have the opportunity to make that 
relationship as pristine as you possibly

1435
01:28:48,111 --> 01:28:49,040
can mean.

1436
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:51,140
It can be a lot of catastrophe involved 
in it,

1437
01:28:51,470 --> 01:28:52,303
but it's a great opportunity and there's
just nothing wrong with having some 

1438
01:28:54,981 --> 01:28:56,830
additional people that love you,
you know,

1439
01:28:57,260 --> 01:28:58,093
and so what you do is you turn your 
attention to the issues of maturity and 

1440
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:03,803
your junior year attention away from the
issues of being a juvenile and you do 

1441
01:29:07,321 --> 01:29:10,890
that partly by knowing that it's 
actually better to do so.

1442
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:14,520
You know there's nothing more absurd 
than the 40 year old 20 year old.

1443
01:29:15,110 --> 01:29:15,943
It gets ugly and there's something like.
There's something like spoiled milk 

1444
01:29:19,261 --> 01:29:20,094
about it.
It goes off and you have to gracefully 

1445
01:29:23,401 --> 01:29:24,234
accept the challenges of each stage of 
life and things work a lot better when 

1446
01:29:27,991 --> 01:29:30,840
you do that much,
much better and you also have to,

1447
01:29:31,130 --> 01:29:31,963
I would say,
work on and perfect your sex life with 

1448
01:29:34,471 --> 01:29:35,304
your partner and express what you need 
and want and teach each other what's 

1449
01:29:38,731 --> 01:29:42,510
necessary to keep things exciting and 
and and new.

1450
01:29:43,440 --> 01:29:44,273
It's not an easy thing to do,
but it's very much worthwhile because 

1451
01:29:46,831 --> 01:29:47,664
then you can combine sexual excitement 
with intimacy and there's no better 

1452
01:29:51,121 --> 01:29:53,070
combination than that.
So,

1453
01:29:53,640 --> 01:29:54,473
and love that.
It can all be nested inside love and 

1454
01:29:56,420 --> 01:29:59,430
inside in our destiny that's intertwined
together.

1455
01:29:59,790 --> 01:30:01,260
That's the best you've got,
man.

1456
01:30:01,261 --> 01:30:01,950
That's,
that's,

1457
01:30:01,950 --> 01:30:04,050
that's,
that's what life has to offer.

1458
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:06,340
And so,
um,

1459
01:30:06,810 --> 01:30:10,890
that's what you do is you accept the 
responsibility of the next stage of life

1460
01:30:10,891 --> 01:30:11,724
and you don't mourn the past.
I suppose that also means that when 

1461
01:30:14,881 --> 01:30:15,714
you're young you do what young people do
and so that you don't want to do it 

1462
01:30:17,821 --> 01:30:19,260
again.
So

1463
01:30:33,670 --> 01:30:37,210
I need to ask a very serious question.
Pickles are green olives.

1464
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:39,190
Hm?
That's a tough one.

1465
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:43,510
Um,
at the moment I can't eat pickles so I'd

1466
01:30:43,511 --> 01:30:45,920
have to go with green all upside.
Do you really like green olives?

1467
01:30:45,950 --> 01:30:48,880
Especially if they're spicy.
So I'd probably,

1468
01:30:49,060 --> 01:30:51,160
if I had to make a choice it would be a 
tough one,

1469
01:30:51,161 --> 01:30:53,140
but I think I'd probably go with green 
olives.

1470
01:30:53,770 --> 01:30:54,603
So

1471
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:10,890
do you have any advice for someone who 
may be asexual?

1472
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:14,800
I want to have a husband and children,
but I'm 27 and haven't felt a connection

1473
01:31:14,801 --> 01:31:15,634
with anyone.
I'm just seeing everyone as friends so 

1474
01:31:17,441 --> 01:31:20,890
far in life.
Well,

1475
01:31:20,891 --> 01:31:23,590
he might want to see a sex therapist 
that might help.

1476
01:31:23,830 --> 01:31:24,663
Um,
I guess the other thing I would say as 

1477
01:31:26,381 --> 01:31:27,280
well,
you know,

1478
01:31:27,370 --> 01:31:30,920
it might not be too bad an idea to,
um,

1479
01:31:31,690 --> 01:31:35,860
act out what you want perhaps in the 
absence of any necessary desire.

1480
01:31:35,861 --> 01:31:36,390
Like,
you know,

1481
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:39,430
you might be so far have fallen so far 
inside yourself.

1482
01:31:39,431 --> 01:31:41,510
Then it's very difficult to get out.
Um,

1483
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:45,030
what are sex therapist would do,
would be in,

1484
01:31:45,110 --> 01:31:46,720
once you were in some kind of,
let's say,

1485
01:31:46,721 --> 01:31:47,554
friendship that you wanted to move 
forward would be to have you guys 

1486
01:31:51,731 --> 01:31:55,210
practice interacting in an intimate 
manner,

1487
01:31:55,211 --> 01:31:57,910
stage by stage so that you could get 
accustomed to it,

1488
01:31:57,911 --> 01:31:58,744
you know,
so you need to explore whether that's 

1489
01:32:01,690 --> 01:32:05,050
essential reality as you say,
or if it's fear or if it's,

1490
01:32:05,470 --> 01:32:06,880
you know,
it might be fear of rejection,

1491
01:32:06,881 --> 01:32:07,714
it might be fear of sexuality might be 
that you're slow to warm up and 

1492
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:11,613
introverted.

1493
01:32:11,680 --> 01:32:15,580
Um,
but I think seeing a sex therapist might

1494
01:32:15,581 --> 01:32:20,581
not be a bad idea,
you know,

1495
01:32:22,841 --> 01:32:25,420
I guess the other thing,
and I say this with some hesitation,

1496
01:32:25,421 --> 01:32:28,720
is that if you find someone you like 
that you could be friends with,

1497
01:32:28,721 --> 01:32:29,740
I mean,
you could try.

1498
01:32:30,250 --> 01:32:31,083
I'm initiating a romantic relationship 
and practice it for a couple of months 

1499
01:32:34,661 --> 01:32:36,190
and see what happens because,
you know,

1500
01:32:36,191 --> 01:32:38,560
maybe you'd warm up across time.
It's certainly,

1501
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:41,980
it's certainly a,
it's certainly a possibility.

1502
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:43,323
So
I have systemic juvenile idiopathic 

1503
01:32:54,051 --> 01:32:54,884
arthritis.
Do you mentioned your daughter has 

1504
01:32:55,821 --> 01:32:58,370
something akin to it in a diet?
Helped him with her fatigue.

1505
01:32:58,670 --> 01:33:03,670
May I ask what diet she used cheers from
Calgary if you go to,

1506
01:33:04,690 --> 01:33:08,360
if you look up mckayla Peterson don't 
eat that,

1507
01:33:08,570 --> 01:33:10,820
that's her blog,
don't eat that.

1508
01:33:11,420 --> 01:33:15,590
And she has a lot of advice there about 
diets that you could try and,

1509
01:33:15,860 --> 01:33:17,870
and uh,
you know,

1510
01:33:17,871 --> 01:33:20,440
I would say do it with some hesitation 
in Catia,

1511
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:22,280
but um,
that,

1512
01:33:24,190 --> 01:33:27,850
that uh,
that seemed to help her a lot.

1513
01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:32,410
So do you plan your day much or your 
time generally?

1514
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:34,360
Does this lead to higher productivity?
Yes,

1515
01:33:34,361 --> 01:33:35,194
I plan my day obsessively.
My calendar is always absolutely full 

1516
01:33:38,081 --> 01:33:41,470
and often weeks in advance and I plan in
the morning,

1517
01:33:41,680 --> 01:33:43,480
especially when I'm on top of things.
So.

1518
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:49,020
And I plan each hour and I probably plan
each minute and yes,

1519
01:33:49,961 --> 01:33:52,130
it leads to way higher productivity.
You,

1520
01:33:52,780 --> 01:33:54,940
you decide what your goals are going to 
be.

1521
01:33:54,970 --> 01:33:55,803
You place them in the calendar,
use the calendar as your friend day 

1522
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:01,600
because what you want to do with the 
calendar is designed a day that you want

1523
01:34:01,601 --> 01:34:05,260
to have or a day that would be good for 
you in a day that would be good for you,

1524
01:34:05,261 --> 01:34:07,750
is one that you're,
that you're,

1525
01:34:07,751 --> 01:34:09,430
um,
you know,

1526
01:34:09,431 --> 01:34:12,380
when you end the day,
you feel that you've moved,

1527
01:34:12,790 --> 01:34:15,190
moved yourself ahead towards your 
values,

1528
01:34:15,220 --> 01:34:16,053
goals and that you've kept chaos under 
control and that enables you to sleep 

1529
01:34:20,530 --> 01:34:22,300
soundly and with a good conscience.

1530
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:25,690
And to know that the next day is going 
to be at least not worse than that.

1531
01:34:25,691 --> 01:34:28,240
Date.
Planning is unbelievably useful.

1532
01:34:28,241 --> 01:34:29,410
And again,
you know,

1533
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:30,413
I,
I don't want to sound like a broken 

1534
01:34:31,271 --> 01:34:33,520
record with regards to the future 
authoring program,

1535
01:34:33,521 --> 01:34:35,080
but it really is useful.
You know,

1536
01:34:35,470 --> 01:34:38,290
you need to figure out what it is that 
you're aiming at and why.

1537
01:34:38,291 --> 01:34:42,070
And then you need to figure out how 
you're going to break that down over the

1538
01:34:42,070 --> 01:34:42,903
months and the weeks and the days.
But I would approach your calendar like 

1539
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:46,720
it's your best friend,
do you think,

1540
01:34:46,721 --> 01:34:47,554
okay,
I'm going to design a weak man that I 

1541
01:34:49,091 --> 01:34:49,924
really want to have and that means you 
can schedule in leisure and all the 

1542
01:34:52,661 --> 01:34:54,310
things that you want to do,
which would,

1543
01:34:54,311 --> 01:34:57,800
you absolutely should do.
And it's also quite to,

1544
01:34:58,050 --> 01:34:58,883
um,
give yourself minimal time to do 

1545
01:35:01,701 --> 01:35:02,534
something complicated because it's quite
challenging to see if you can do far 

1546
01:35:05,781 --> 01:35:08,030
more than you thought in far less time.

1547
01:35:08,570 --> 01:35:11,210
And so that's a fun game.
And the other thing you can do is like,

1548
01:35:11,211 --> 01:35:15,170
if you're avoiding something,
you could schedule in five minutes of it

1549
01:35:15,171 --> 01:35:15,621
and say,
well,

1550
01:35:15,621 --> 01:35:18,710
like if you're avoiding looking at some 
bills because you're afraid of them,

1551
01:35:18,711 --> 01:35:19,544
you know,
your first step might be to schedule in 

1552
01:35:21,771 --> 01:35:23,900
five minutes where you just look at the 
bill,

1553
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:24,913
you don't do anything else and you know,
you might be able to entice yourself 

1554
01:35:27,381 --> 01:35:28,490
into doing that.
So,

1555
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:29,953
but I would say learning to plan is 
unbelievably useful to schedule your 

1556
01:35:34,071 --> 01:35:35,630
time because that's your life,
you know,

1557
01:35:36,210 --> 01:35:38,450
um,
but scheduled the life you want,

1558
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:41,960
that means you have to schedule your 
responsibilities often,

1559
01:35:42,030 --> 01:35:42,863
obviously,
because responsibilities are those 

1560
01:35:45,051 --> 01:35:47,420
things that ruin your life if you don't 
fulfill them.

1561
01:35:47,421 --> 01:35:48,420
So,
um,

1562
01:35:49,350 --> 01:35:51,950
all right,
safety advisor,

1563
01:35:51,951 --> 01:35:54,590
northern Alberta,
asking what's the best personality tests

1564
01:35:54,591 --> 01:35:56,810
for my coworker,
ground level of management.

1565
01:35:56,811 --> 01:36:00,440
Any recommended practices to promote 
mental health with remote workers?

1566
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:04,780
Well answered the first part of that 
using big five personality test.

1567
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:10,160
Um,
what my camera just like trucks.

1568
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:55,240
Sorry about that guys.
I'm back.

1569
01:36:57,190 --> 01:36:58,930
Hopefully everything is functioning 
again.

1570
01:37:20,580 --> 01:37:21,413
Question,
how is capitalism compatible with your 

1571
01:37:23,101 --> 01:37:23,934
definition of good?
If it requires ever increasing uses of 

1572
01:37:26,581 --> 01:37:30,690
the finite resources of the planet,
where once depleted would mean our end.

1573
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:31,793
Well,
I would say capitalism isn't compatible 

1574
01:37:33,841 --> 01:37:34,674
with my definition of good if it 
requires every increasing uses of the 

1575
01:37:37,681 --> 01:37:41,940
finite resources of the planet,
but that's by no means self evident even

1576
01:37:41,941 --> 01:37:44,220
though the Scuttlebutt,
let's say,

1577
01:37:44,221 --> 01:37:45,054
especially among the environmentalist 
oriented types who might have some 

1578
01:37:48,691 --> 01:37:49,980
sympathy for,
by the way,

1579
01:37:49,981 --> 01:37:52,050
especially with regards to ocean 
depletion.

1580
01:37:52,510 --> 01:37:53,343
Um,
there's a huge argument and there has 

1581
01:37:54,511 --> 01:37:55,344
been for many years between the 
economists and the biologists and this 

1582
01:37:57,871 --> 01:37:58,704
is a really important thing to know and 
the economists point out that human 

1583
01:38:01,861 --> 01:38:05,880
ingenuity is such that we're continually
able to make more with less.

1584
01:38:05,881 --> 01:38:09,840
And certainly over the last well,
500 years,

1585
01:38:10,940 --> 01:38:14,400
especially in the last 150 years.
That's just absolutely evident.

1586
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,233
You know,
like people say we're going to run out 

1587
01:38:16,531 --> 01:38:17,364
of energy.
And I think that's absolutely 

1588
01:38:18,151 --> 01:38:18,984
preposterous.
It's like it's just crazy as thinking 

1589
01:38:20,701 --> 01:38:22,770
we're going to run out of mattered.
I mean,

1590
01:38:22,890 --> 01:38:23,723
we're going through a bit of a 
bottleneck right now because you know 

1591
01:38:26,130 --> 01:38:26,963
the population is going to increase to 
about 9 billion and then it's gonna 

1592
01:38:29,370 --> 01:38:30,930
decrease.
That's,

1593
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:35,310
that's the most reliable projections and
$9 million isn't a lot more than we have

1594
01:38:35,311 --> 01:38:36,144
now and you know,
there's gonna be some environmental 

1595
01:38:39,001 --> 01:38:39,834
disruption as a consequence of that,
but I don't think there's any reason to 

1596
01:38:42,451 --> 01:38:43,284
assume that all that capitalism 
necessarily requires every increasing 

1597
01:38:46,501 --> 01:38:48,750
uses of the finite resources of the 
planet.

1598
01:38:49,110 --> 01:38:49,943
It's also not obvious to what degree the
resources of the planet are actually 

1599
01:38:52,501 --> 01:38:53,334
finite because we continually think up 
new uses for things that nobody thought 

1600
01:38:58,381 --> 01:38:59,214
had any use at all.
And so it depends to some degree on 

1601
01:39:02,281 --> 01:39:07,281
whether or not you're willing to bet on 
human imaginativeness or you're going to

1602
01:39:07,681 --> 01:39:08,514
be a male.

1603
01:39:08,710 --> 01:39:09,543
A pessimist.
And I'm not saying that there are 

1604
01:39:11,350 --> 01:39:12,183
reasons for both.
I'm just saying that it is by no means 

1605
01:39:14,461 --> 01:39:16,470
self evident that things are getting 
worse.

1606
01:39:16,980 --> 01:39:19,470
You know,
like I can give you an example.

1607
01:39:19,471 --> 01:39:20,340
So,
you know,

1608
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:23,880
in the last,
in the last 15 years,

1609
01:39:24,690 --> 01:39:25,523
the millennium goal for the UN was to 
have world poverty like absolute 

1610
01:39:28,231 --> 01:39:30,570
poverty,
so that's less than a dollar 50 a day by

1611
01:39:30,571 --> 01:39:31,404
50 percent within 15 years and that was 
actually reached ahead of schedule and 

1612
01:39:35,790 --> 01:39:36,623
we've lived in hundreds of millions of 
people into the middle class over the 

1613
01:39:38,941 --> 01:39:42,330
last 30 years.
And so there is an increasing inequality

1614
01:39:42,331 --> 01:39:43,164
in the west because the working class 
taken the brunt of that say that 

1615
01:39:46,951 --> 01:39:50,040
redistribution to third world countries.
But by the same token,

1616
01:39:50,041 --> 01:39:50,874
you know,
there's no starvation in the world 

1617
01:39:52,171 --> 01:39:55,530
anymore except really for reasons of 
misdistribution and,

1618
01:39:55,940 --> 01:39:56,773
and,
and,

1619
01:39:56,910 --> 01:39:58,260
and political purpose.

1620
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:01,830
And people are becoming richer and more 
educated all the time.

1621
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:06,000
And we are waking up to our planet to 
your responsibilities.

1622
01:40:06,030 --> 01:40:10,180
Once people stopped starving to death 
and having to burn like dirt and,

1623
01:40:10,410 --> 01:40:11,570
and eat,
you know,

1624
01:40:11,610 --> 01:40:14,370
substandard food that they've scraped 
out at the Brown.

1625
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:18,060
They do start to turn their attention to
things that might be more aesthetic.

1626
01:40:18,061 --> 01:40:18,894
And so look,
I don't think there's any reason to be 

1627
01:40:20,281 --> 01:40:22,440
pessimistic.
Not Fundamentally.

1628
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:23,933
And I guess the reason that capitalism 
is compatible with my definition of 

1629
01:40:27,190 --> 01:40:28,950
good,
I wouldn't say that exactly.

1630
01:40:28,951 --> 01:40:29,784
I would say that I don't see an 
alternative that has manifested itself 

1631
01:40:33,780 --> 01:40:36,810
that doesn't have far more negative 
consequences.

1632
01:40:37,220 --> 01:40:39,480
You know,
it's sort of a minimal pessimism issue.

1633
01:40:39,481 --> 01:40:42,480
It's like,
well this is the best devil that we have

1634
01:40:42,990 --> 01:40:46,830
and I do believe it is because the 
successful societies,

1635
01:40:46,831 --> 01:40:47,664
by any stretch of the imagination,
by virtually any metric are the 

1636
01:40:51,870 --> 01:40:54,010
capitalist societies.
Certainly the case,

1637
01:40:54,011 --> 01:40:54,844
for example,
that the Soviet Union demolished far 

1638
01:40:57,161 --> 01:41:02,161
more of its natural resources.
Too Far less productive consequence than

1639
01:41:02,621 --> 01:41:03,454
the west did hearsay evidence.
There's suggestions that between 10 and 

1640
01:41:06,401 --> 01:41:07,234
15 percent of the total area of the 
Soviet Union has been rendered more or 

1641
01:41:10,181 --> 01:41:14,620
less permanently uninhabitable.
So the question is compared to what?

1642
01:41:17,250 --> 01:41:19,950
All right guys,
it's late

1643
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:25,270
and by the answered lots of questions,
it's 10:20.

1644
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:29,080
So a
Jordan,

1645
01:41:29,081 --> 01:41:30,880
hope you're doing well.
Says I am.

1646
01:41:30,881 --> 01:41:34,240
Who Am glad to see you live?
I'm glad to see me alive too.

1647
01:41:34,490 --> 01:41:37,150
That's a good thing.
And hopefully that will continue.

1648
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:38,553
So,
uh,

1649
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:40,233
anyways guys,
thank you very much for attending to 

1650
01:41:43,631 --> 01:41:44,560
this.
Once again,

1651
01:41:45,550 --> 01:41:46,383
I'm,
I'm always gratified by the response to 

1652
01:41:47,861 --> 01:41:52,300
these q and a's.
It's fun to see what your questions are,

1653
01:41:52,301 --> 01:41:52,770
man.
They're,

1654
01:41:52,770 --> 01:41:54,680
they'd been really,
they were really difficult tonight.

1655
01:41:54,681 --> 01:41:55,514
Then I'm very impressed.
I mean some of them I was afraid to 

1656
01:41:57,521 --> 01:42:01,960
answer and so if you didn't get your 
question answered and it was up near the

1657
01:42:02,260 --> 01:42:03,093
top of the vote last,
then part of the reason I didn't answer 

1658
01:42:06,821 --> 01:42:07,654
it is because I was actually afraid I 
wouldn't be able to generate something 

1659
01:42:09,641 --> 01:42:14,080
intelligent enough on the fly.
So anyways,

1660
01:42:14,890 --> 01:42:16,920
like I said,
thanks very much and uh,

1661
01:42:17,080 --> 01:42:20,950
I'm going to start the biblical lectures
again in October and I've got some other

1662
01:42:20,951 --> 01:42:24,250
videos to release if I can get myself 
organized to,

1663
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:29,400
to edit them and put them up and uh,
we'll see you in a month.

1664
01:42:29,890 --> 01:42:33,010
So thanks.
Thanks very much.

1665
01:42:33,110 --> 01:42:33,943
Good night.
