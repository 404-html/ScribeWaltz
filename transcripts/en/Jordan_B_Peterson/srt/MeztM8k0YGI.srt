1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:06,460
Well I won't back down.
You can stand at the gates of hell.

2
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,340
Good Morning Boys,
girls and interested others.

3
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:26,610
So the calls for my discipline and 
silencing have begun in earnest.

4
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,533
Um,
so I'm going to read you two letters 

5
00:00:30,161 --> 00:00:32,010
that have been produced,
um,

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,610
publicly and,
and within the uh,

7
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,480
within the university community itself.
Um,

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,350
the first one has received some press 
attention,

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,260
I don't believe the second one has yet.
So,

10
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,290
um,
October six,

11
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:48,124
2016 so this was produced by a variety 
of student organizations and I'll 

12
00:00:51,521 --> 00:00:52,354
discuss who they are.
At the end of the letter to the 

13
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:57,520
attention of the University of Toronto 
Administration and the U of t community.

14
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:58,443
We the undersigned.
Community members at the University of 

15
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:01,743
Toronto are appalled,
concerned and saddened by recent 

16
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:05,494
transphobic,
racist and anti black comments made by 

17
00:01:07,661 --> 00:01:08,494
professor Jordan Peterson and an online 
lecture series that he published on 

18
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:16,531
Youtube on September 27th,
2016 in October 3rd,

19
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:17,523
2016 Peterson has abused his position of
power as a tenured professor and has 

20
00:01:21,071 --> 00:01:21,904
tried to use my,
his academic freedom to disguise his 

21
00:01:23,771 --> 00:01:26,440
bigotry and prejudice as an intellectual
disagreement.

22
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,950
However,
to suggest that these comments add value

23
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:33,670
to classroom discussion is absurd.
By the way,

24
00:01:33,671 --> 00:01:34,504
that's not a suggestion that I've made.
We would like to bring attention to the 

25
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,390
University of Toronto statement of 
equity,

26
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,253
diversity and excellence.
No doubt they would like to bring 

27
00:01:44,411 --> 00:01:45,244
attention to that which states that the 
University of Toronto will proactively 

28
00:01:48,581 --> 00:01:49,414
seek to increase diversity among our 
community members and it is our aim to 

29
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:53,554
have a student body teaching and 
administrative staff that mirror the 

30
00:01:56,321 --> 00:01:57,154
diversity of the pool of potentially 
qualified applicants for those 

31
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:02,470
positions.
And,

32
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:07,471
and it is our responsibility to help in 
the creation of an equitable community.

33
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,573
One that is diverse as well as inclusive
and that is respectful and protects the 

34
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:13,114
human rights of its measure members.
Something that requires the work of 

35
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:18,730
every member of the community across all
our sites and capitalists,

36
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,290
including students,
teaching staff,

37
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,760
administrative staff,
visitors,

38
00:02:21,761 --> 00:02:22,720
alumni and guests.

39
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,880
The university is committed to internal 
policies on issues related to equity and

40
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:28,714
also operates in compliance with all 
legislation that bears on equity and 

41
00:02:31,181 --> 00:02:32,014
human rights.
In a recent two part lecture given by 

42
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:37,720
Jordan Peterson,
which was published on Youtube,

43
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:38,973
see the relevant urls.
Peterson goes on a 57 minute rant 

44
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,353
regarding his disapproval of bill.
See 16 which proposes to include gender 

45
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:47,464
identity and gender expression has 
prohibited grounds for harassment and 

46
00:02:49,751 --> 00:02:52,720
discrimination under the Canadian Human 
Rights Act and the criminal code.

47
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,213
This same bill is considered by many 
political scholars and members of trans 

48
00:02:56,741 --> 00:02:58,960
communities as an advancement of human 
rights,

49
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,913
equal protection under the law.
Peterson is also a man who has 

50
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:03,274
complained that the Ontario human rights
commission's terms and definitions are 

51
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:06,754
over inclusive and all encompassing.
Surely inclusivity is an important 

52
00:03:11,021 --> 00:03:13,270
factor when discussing human rights 
protections.

53
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,133
In one of his lectures.
Peterson includes various disparaging 

54
00:03:16,271 --> 00:03:18,280
comments about members of the Trans 
Community.

55
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,263
He argues that there is no evidence to 
support the existence of non binary 

56
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:22,684
identities.
That is not something I argued by the 

57
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:27,010
way,
a statement that is inaccurate.

58
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,353
Furthermore,
when discussing the use of his students 

59
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:31,810
preferred pronouns,
Peterson stated,

60
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,823
I won't recognize another person's right
to determine what pronouns I use to 

61
00:03:35,651 --> 00:03:37,150
address.
I won't do it.

62
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,410
Yes,
that is true.

63
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,450
Purposefully mis-gendering a trans 
person is an act of violence.

64
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,123
While you better pay attention to that 
because what that essentially means is 

65
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:52,960
that speech is now an act of violence 
and that more importantly,

66
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,943
refusal to use the words that someone 
else demands that you use is an act of 

67
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:59,200
violence.
That's what I'm being accused of.

68
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,063
Okay.
In my second 57 minute rant titled Part 

69
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:05,230
Two Compulsory Education,
political education,

70
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:07,120
a real world case study at the U of 
Toronto.

71
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,133
Peterson states his disapproval of the 
mandatory antidiscrimination and anti 

72
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:11,644
bias training that the u of t has 
mandated for its HR professionals and 

73
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:17,710
opinion that he was not asked for by 
anyone.

74
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,570
The black liberation collective was 
successful in advocating for this equity

75
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:23,404
training to be done,
not for the comfort of those who have 

76
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:27,490
always been accommodated in welcome 
within the institution,

77
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,473
but for those who are made voiceless,
it was crafted from a place of wanting 

78
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:33,364
better in the environments that we as 
students daily partake in keeping in 

79
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:36,964
mind the ways in which people in 
powerful positions of this university 

80
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:42,850
are allowed to dehumanize students 
through microaggressions,

81
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,773
gaslighting,
and blatant disrespect without any 

82
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:46,864
accountability or repercussions.
According to the U of t statements of 

83
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,290
institutional purpose,
the University of firms,

84
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,124
it's dedication to fostering an academic
community in which the learning and 

85
00:04:56,951 --> 00:04:57,784
scholarship of every member may flourish
with vigilant protection for individual 

86
00:05:00,521 --> 00:05:04,810
human rights and a resolute commitment 
to the principle of equal opportunity,

87
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:05,644
equity and justice.
The fact that a tenured professor 

88
00:05:08,261 --> 00:05:11,680
employed with uft refuses to acknowledge
the use of personal pronouns.

89
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,930
They mean preferred pronouns.
By the way,

90
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:14,973
I do actually use personal pronouns and 
has the audacity to try and rationalize 

91
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:21,150
and quantify racism is something 
subjective I have.

92
00:05:21,151 --> 00:05:21,984
I have no idea where that comes from.
Not only discredits the lived 

93
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:26,500
experiences of students who have dealt 
with this reality,

94
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:31,210
but also silences them more violence 
occurs as someone in a position of power

95
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,930
who not only has the nerve to say such 
statements publicly,

96
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,003
can still be a respected member of the 
university community and not face any 

97
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:42,100
formal university backlash and continue 
to enjoy tenure.

98
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:43,683
We are sick of discriminatory faculty 
members denying our expertise in our 

99
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:48,910
experiences are not respecting who we 
are,

100
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:49,803
especially when we merely ask for our 
lived realities to be respected and not 

101
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:54,184
disregarded.
While you'll see how much asking is 

102
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:56,734
being done later in this letter,
we are deeply concerned about the 

103
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:00,710
university's lack of action on this 
situation,

104
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:01,544
especially as Peterson continues to 
spread is transphobic and racist 

105
00:06:05,331 --> 00:06:07,430
ideologies through various media 
outlets.

106
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,650
I really have no idea where the racism 
thing is going and I'm not transphobic,

107
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,310
so Bam,
whatever.

108
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,623
The university has failed to act on this
situation and this ultimately showcases 

109
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,740
that quote,
diversity,

110
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:19,574
inclusion and equal respect are simply 
legalities and are not principles that 

111
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:23,534
the u of t tends on upholding the UFT 
has failed at maintaining a positive 

112
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:29,750
space and campuses free of hate.
As a result,

113
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:30,584
we,
the undersigned are demanding 

114
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,623
accountability from the university 
administration and governing console 

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,833
with the following five demands.
Now one thing you'll note about the 

116
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:39,674
people who do this sort of thing is that
they're always demanding and that's for 

117
00:06:41,871 --> 00:06:45,680
sure and a demand means or else,
and that's also what legislation means.

118
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,993
A public apology from professor Jordan 
Peterson and a full retraction of his 

119
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:51,380
comment.
Yeah.

120
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:53,840
Well,
hello freeze over before that happens.

121
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,980
Removal of is transphobic and racist 
lectures from Youtube,

122
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,250
thus affirming their commitment to free 
speech.

123
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,440
A town hall with President Merrick 
Gertler,

124
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:05,090
provost,
Cherrelle Regnier,

125
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,870
Vice President Angela Hilliard,
and professor Jordan Peterson,

126
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,793
where community members can explain the 
issues that he does clearly does not 

127
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:15,620
comprehend.
And here's a good one.

128
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:16,723
Mandated,
anti-oppression trevor training at all 

129
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:19,514
levels of the University of Toronto,
including faculty administration to 

130
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:23,474
happen every academic semester.
A commitment at the University of 

131
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,110
Toronto will take action to defend 
students in university community members

132
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:30,944
in future instances where tenured 
professors have made prejudice comments 

133
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:36,080
against an individual or group on the 
basis of race,

134
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,430
sexual orientation,
ability,

135
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:38,181
sex,
religion,

136
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:39,014
gender expression or gender identity.
We would also like to remind the 

137
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:45,470
administration at the University of 
Toronto statements on equity,

138
00:07:45,471 --> 00:07:46,304
diversity,
and excellence states our support for 

139
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:53,030
equity is grounded in an institution 
wide commitment to achieving a working,

140
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,300
teaching and learning environment that 
is free of discrimination and harassment

141
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:58,250
as defined in the Ontario Human Rights 
Code.

142
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,320
In striving to become an equitable 
community,

143
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:02,060
we were also worked to eliminate,
reduce,

144
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:02,894
or mitigate the adverse effects of any 
barriers to full participation in 

145
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:08,390
university life that we find including 
in physical,

146
00:08:08,391 --> 00:08:11,240
environmental,
attitudinal communication,

147
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,490
or technological hateful.

148
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,323
Common should never be tolerated,
especially not from someone who was 

149
00:08:16,491 --> 00:08:17,324
considered to be an educator.
No student should have to endure a two 

150
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:22,370
hour lecture,
whether gender identity,

151
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:23,204
existence,
and realities are being debated and 

152
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:27,800
refused.
Ultimately Peterson's comments erode the

153
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:28,634
safe campus learning environment to 
which the university states a 

154
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:32,900
commitment.
We hope that the university will respond

155
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:33,734
to this situation within a reasonable 
timeframe and in accordance with the 

156
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:37,850
policies established by the Governing 
Council.

157
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:38,923
We also hope that these demands are 
approved when the Governing Council 

158
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:42,074
meets on October 27th,
2016 and so here's the people that are 

159
00:08:45,321 --> 00:08:47,840
doing this.
Daniel Lourenco,

160
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,123
Utm Su Lgbtq coordinator,
I'll make their email addresses 

161
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:56,760
available at the end of this video.
Marise Hopkins,

162
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,633
Utms,
you and black liberation collective 

163
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:00,204
organization or Mela Cassia President 
Association of parttime undergraduate 

164
00:09:04,141 --> 00:09:06,020
students.
Roya Guera,

165
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:07,680
manny,
executive director,

166
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,390
uh,
out at utm.

167
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,200
Julian Olivera,
lgbt out University of Toronto,

168
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,610
newer led utms you president.
And so,

169
00:09:17,611 --> 00:09:18,421
okay,
students,

170
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:19,254
so these are your elected officials,
so you can decide if they're actually 

171
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:22,404
speaking for you.
And then it's copied to all these 

172
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,110
university administrators.
So that's the first letter.

173
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,730
So if you're looking for something to do
to help,

174
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,313
you could write a letter to the 
individuals whose emails I have posted 

175
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,533
in the information box and the 
description box that that is associated 

176
00:09:42,741 --> 00:09:43,574
with.
This video,

177
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,560
so email them and email all of them and 
send me a copy if you want.

178
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,800
That would be helpful.
Um,

179
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,150
be particularly useful if it came from 
students.

180
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,160
Thanks very much.
Bye.

181
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:55,994
Bye.
