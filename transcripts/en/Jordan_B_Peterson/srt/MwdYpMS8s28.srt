1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:06,210
[inaudible].

2
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,160
Oh well,
welcome everyone.

3
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,200
I'm assuming that applause was not for 
me.

4
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,073
My name is Bill Flanagan and I'm the 
dean of law here at Queen's University 

5
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,313
and I'm pleased to welcome all of you 
here today for the inaugural liberty 

6
00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:43,994
lecture,
generously sponsored by Greg Kids that 

7
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:47,264
ski law 80 a long time and very generous
supporter of the law school and Greg is 

8
00:00:51,471 --> 00:00:52,304
here today and I just want to perhaps 
the join me in thanking Greg for 

9
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:55,424
sponsoring

10
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,820
[inaudible].

11
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:08,703
The Liberty Lecture is intended to 
explore the meaning of liberty in our 

12
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:13,384
contemporary society,
the subject of rich interest to 

13
00:01:16,631 --> 00:01:19,150
philosophers,
political scientists,

14
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,060
and legal scholars.
Just to name a few.

15
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,793
And today's liberty lecture is moderated
by Professor Bruce Party to my right of 

16
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:32,521
the Faculty of Law and experts in a 
variety of areas including environmental

17
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:36,460
law,
environmental law and governance,

18
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,970
ecosystem management,
climate change,

19
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,790
water law,
and university governance.

20
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,403
Our guest today is Dr. Jordan Peterson,
a professor of psychology at the 

21
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,340
University of Toronto and a clinical 
psychologist.

22
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,753
He as many publications include his 
recently published book 12 rules for 

23
00:01:56,591 --> 00:01:57,424
life,
an antidote to chaos and his research 

24
00:02:00,701 --> 00:02:01,534
spans a number of topics including the 
psychology of religion and the modern 

25
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,380
understanding of creativity and 
personality.

26
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,260
I know that today's lecture has 
generated a great deal of interest as is

27
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:15,094
evident from the packed hall here today.
It's also generated a certain amount of 

28
00:02:19,421 --> 00:02:22,150
heat.
The proposed topic,

29
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,253
the rising tide of compelled speech in 
Canada is for many a controversial one 

30
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:30,243
and I know that many of you in the 
audience will hold widely divergent 

31
00:02:33,491 --> 00:02:34,324
views.

32
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,303
I fully support your opportunity to be 
heard and should you wish challenge the 

33
00:02:40,091 --> 00:02:40,924
speakers to defend their positions.
I know that today's speakers likewise 

34
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,664
share this conviction and we'll welcome 
your comments and questions as might be 

35
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:55,060
appropriate for a lecture series named 
after liberty.

36
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:00,930
I believe it is also important for me to
affirm at outset that the core values of

37
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:02,224
the Faculty of law end of Queens 
University include academic freedom and 

38
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:10,750
respectful dialogue among those with 
differing views.

39
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,603
This includes providing our speakers 
with the opportunity to be heard and 

40
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:16,834
providing all of you with the 
opportunity to respond in a respectful 

41
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,730
environment,
free from any harassment or any attempts

42
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:25,564
to shut down the conversation.
So it is in this spirit of free and 

43
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:30,874
respectful academic exchange that I'm 
pleased to launch her this new lecture 

44
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,374
series.
Welcome again and welcome to our guests 

45
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,030
and I look forward to our discussion.
Thank you.

46
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,410
[inaudible] [inaudible]

47
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:58,270
thank you bill.
Welcome and thank you for coming.

48
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,140
I would like to underline what bill 
said,

49
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:02,974
which is that this event would not have 
happened without the initiative in 

50
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,370
support of Greg Kids.
Esky.

51
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:11,200
So Greg,
thank you very much

52
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:16,740
[inaudible]

53
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,060
as well.
Before we start,

54
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:24,470
I would like to thank some people from 
the Faculty of Law,

55
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,363
Diane Butler at him,
Blake Galippo and Christina Julian for 

56
00:04:29,421 --> 00:04:30,254
their help in putting this together.
I would also like to acknowledge the 

57
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,783
support,
help and generous assistance of several 

58
00:04:42,621 --> 00:04:45,110
people around the university.
Uh,

59
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:49,580
Lisa plater and event services,
David Patterson and the,

60
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,020
uh,
campus security office.

61
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,050
Uh,
you have been professional,

62
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,913
helpful,
straightforward and I thank you very 

63
00:04:56,901 --> 00:04:57,734
much for making this possible.
I would also like to return to the 

64
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:05,834
flannigans observation about the 
importance of this moment and to 

65
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:10,724
acknowledge the role that both Dean 
Flanigan and principal wolf have played 

66
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,640
in enhancing the reputation of this 
university in terms of its commitment to

67
00:05:24,261 --> 00:05:27,650
academic freedom and academic debate.
They have

68
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,210
reflected an unflinching commitment to 
those ideas.

69
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:37,420
As principal of Wolf said on his blog,
informed respectful debate is central to

70
00:05:40,311 --> 00:05:42,410
academia.
And Gentlemen,

71
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,650
I salute your academic statesmanship.
Thank you very much.

72
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,920
[inaudible] so we're

73
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,130
going to proceed as follows.
A the first thing I would like to say is

74
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:01,964
that in the hole behind you afterwards,
there will be some of Jordan's books on 

75
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:07,340
sale.
12.

76
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,970
Um,
what,

77
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,830
what's the title again?
12 rules for like 12,

78
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,020
12 rules for like wanting to get the 12 
what it was,

79
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:16,060
right?
It's not,

80
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,110
that's not 12 steps.
It's 12 rules.

81
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,320
Right?
Um,

82
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,973
we are going to proceed as follows.
Jordan and I are going to have a 

83
00:06:27,171 --> 00:06:28,004
conversation for half an hour,
maybe 40 minutes and then we are going 

84
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:34,664
to throw the floor open to questions.
We'll describe what kinds of questions 

85
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,870
that you should ask.
Wait,

86
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,793
I don't want to get to that stage,
but our topic is the rising tide of 

87
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,074
compelled speech in Canada.
I am going to take just a couple of 

88
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:53,743
minutes to give us some context and set 
it up and then I'll ask Jordan to tell 

89
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:00,374
us what he thinks.
You may have seen the CBC production of 

90
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:14,210
the tutors.
The story of King Henry the eighth

91
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:16,963
in one episode,
the king has condemned Thomas Moore to 

92
00:07:22,221 --> 00:07:27,221
death
for refusing to say that the king is the

93
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:32,501
head of the Church of England
more is it his cell awaiting execution?

94
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,333
A friend comes to him to plead with him 
to say what it is the king wants to 

95
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:45,714
hear.
Morris says he cannot do that for he 

96
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:56,421
does not believe it to be true
in exasperations.

97
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:03,370
The friends says
you don't have to believe it.

98
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,323
You just have to say it
when your brain makes that kind of 

99
00:08:14,951 --> 00:08:15,784
calculation.
You know you are under the thumb of a 

100
00:08:20,881 --> 00:08:25,881
tyrant
and Thomas Moore lost his head.

101
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,460
The tide of compelled speech in Canada 
is rising.

102
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,453
The Law Society of Ontario has 
introduced a new policy that requires 

103
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,063
each lawyer to develop a statement of 
Principles which endorses and 

104
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:52,390
acknowledges an obligation to promote 
certain values.

105
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,960
The Ontario Human Rights Commission says
that under the Human Rights Code,

106
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,573
failing to address somebody by their 
preferred Pronoun will constitute 

107
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:13,580
discrimination for which you may be 
investigated and prosecuted.

108
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:21,550
The Elementary Teachers,
Federation of Ontario has introduced new

109
00:09:22,221 --> 00:09:23,054
curriculum
to require teachers to teach elementary 

110
00:09:26,991 --> 00:09:27,824
students about white privilege
and the Federal Summer Jay Grants 

111
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:39,450
Program requires applicants to attest to
the values,

112
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,730
but the government believes it.

113
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,140
Okay.

114
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,730
They don't have to believe it.

115
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:58,550
[inaudible]

116
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,390
that's pure narcissism at work,
by the way,

117
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:56,640
[inaudible]

118
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,673
it due to hijack hijacking event like 
this that other people put time and 

119
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:12,744
effort into and to use the civility of 
the crowd and the civility of the 

120
00:11:17,521 --> 00:11:21,680
organizers as an excuse to blatantly 
yellow.

121
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,320
You're ill informed opinions is no way 
to conduct a civil dialogue.

122
00:11:25,321 --> 00:11:27,420
It's absolutely appalling.
The people who do that,

123
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:28,254
she'd be embarrassed.

124
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:38,730
[inaudible] [inaudible]

125
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,700
I would also say that as students and as
faculty members,

126
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:44,803
you shouldn't put up with it.
There's no way that you should allow 

127
00:11:46,821 --> 00:11:47,654
people who are doing this to hijack your
educational opportunities and to bend 

128
00:11:50,991 --> 00:11:54,610
and twist the functions,
the structures of the university.

129
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,400
It's not a good thing.
Not In any way at all.

130
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:01,000
He would say that was a very disgraceful
display fundamentally.

131
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,100
So let's,
let's stick with it.

132
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,443
Why,
why do you think people are afraid of 

133
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:12,100
free speech?
Well,

134
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:12,963
you know,
people develop an ideological view of 

135
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:15,844
the world because they don't want to 
think through things in real detail and 

136
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,233
they're aided and embedded in that 
endeavor by their pathological 

137
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,420
professors who are feeding them.
Uh,

138
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,653
what would I say over simplified?
An oversimplified radical view of the 

139
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:33,490
world in my estimation,
is fundamentally based in,

140
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:36,610
in resentment.
Not that there's no reason for,

141
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,410
say,
a left wing view of the world and we can

142
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:39,370
get to that later.

143
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,550
It's easy virtue.
You know,

144
00:12:42,551 --> 00:12:43,384
you can stand up in front of 900 people 
with your plot card and your and your 

145
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:50,710
screeching and you can,
you can declaim to the entire audience,

146
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:51,544
your fundamental moral superiority.
You can tell everyone at once that 

147
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,744
they're all beneath you and you're 
standing for the right thing and 

148
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,250
absolutely none of that is earned.
You know,

149
00:13:00,251 --> 00:13:01,990
like what the hell?
What the hell was that?

150
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,900
There's no seriously man,
there's just,

151
00:13:04,901 --> 00:13:07,580
it's just complete misbehavior.
It's embarrassing.

152
00:13:07,581 --> 00:13:10,210
And the fact that people,
the people who do that don't have enough

153
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:13,690
sense to go hide their head in shame 
just tells you how badly socialized they

154
00:13:13,691 --> 00:13:16,810
are and how terribly educated they are.
And the thing is,

155
00:13:16,811 --> 00:13:20,590
the thing that's so awful is that there 
are professors and educators who promote

156
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:21,101
that.
They say,

157
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:22,420
well,
that's how you change the world.

158
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:23,830
It's like it is how you change the 
world,

159
00:13:23,831 --> 00:13:25,720
but it's certainly not how you make it 
better.

160
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,880
You make it worse.
Clearly,

161
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,590
you know,
there is no comfort in that and,

162
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,980
and there's nothing about it this 
impressive.

163
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:33,843
It's no,
it's no better in some sense than a two 

164
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:37,760
year old having a tantrum on the floor.
It's a,

165
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:38,643
it shows as far as I'm concerned,
it approximate the same level of 

166
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:42,454
psychosocial development.
So when the fact that that this is 

167
00:13:45,101 --> 00:13:45,934
happening continually universities is,
it truly makes me embarrassed to be 

168
00:13:50,141 --> 00:13:50,974
associated with the university.
And now I say that with great 

169
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,600
displeasure because,
you know,

170
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:56,434
I'd been working for great universities 
for a very long time and the university 

171
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:01,420
has an absolutely remarkable 
institution.

172
00:14:01,421 --> 00:14:03,400
You know,
it's survived for a thousand years.

173
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,650
And,
and to see it,

174
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:09,760
to see it brought down by,
by people whose behavior would be out of

175
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:11,910
place at a four year old's birthday 
party is,

176
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,890
is something something bizible to 
behold.

177
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:16,643
So,
so what about the actions of government 

178
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,430
now,
because it is government after all,

179
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,760
that is the source of this compelled 
speech as law,

180
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:28,960
as well as other ways in which they seek
to restrict speech.

181
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:33,460
But the compelled speech is the most 
egregious form of violation.

182
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,200
Well,
tell us about that.

183
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:36,034
Well,
I've been trying,

184
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,310
I've been trying to sort this out 
because you know,

185
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:40,144
if you're a clinician,
I would say one of the problems you 

186
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:44,014
always have when you're dealing with 
behavior that's gone astray is to 

187
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,200
understand at what level of analysis you
should address it.

188
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,970
You know,
is it a theological problem?

189
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,450
Is it a philosophical problem?
Is it a psychological problem?

190
00:14:56,451 --> 00:14:58,310
Is it social,
is it economic?

191
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:01,640
These are very complicated questions.
Is it a trivial issue?

192
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:03,230
Is it an issue of rights?
Is it,

193
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,083
is it something else?
The people who put in the bill see 16 

194
00:15:07,461 --> 00:15:08,294
for example,
and its associated legislation make the 

195
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:11,144
claim that it's,
it's a legislative move that's 

196
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,290
facilitated by nothing but compassion 
and desire to expand the domain of,

197
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,130
of,
of let's say,

198
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,870
of of rights and freedoms.

199
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,703
And you know,
there's nothing wrong in principle with 

200
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,630
expanding the domain of rights and 
freedoms,

201
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,583
except of course for every right and,
and for every freedom there's an 

202
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:33,620
attendant responsibility and obligation.
So you have to keep that in mind.

203
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,880
When I looked at bill [inaudible] 16 and
the legislation that surrounded it,

204
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:40,700
especially that was written by the 
Ontario Human Rights Commission,

205
00:15:40,701 --> 00:15:41,534
the policies that surrounded it and also
the policies that gave rise to the 

206
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:48,560
social justice tribunals named social 
justice tribunals.

207
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,510
Appallingly enough that that that gave 
rise to those tribunals in Ontario.

208
00:15:53,511 --> 00:15:55,640
The things I read just made my hair 
stand on end.

209
00:15:55,641 --> 00:15:56,474
You know the social justice tribunals 
have the right to place themselves 

210
00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:03,080
outside of legal [inaudible],
outside of jurors prudential precedents.

211
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,110
It's like,
what the hell is that?

212
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,460
That's really what you're going to make 
the case.

213
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,323
The only way I think that you could 
justify doing that is it if you torture 

214
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,073
yourself into the ideological 
proposition that English common law is 

215
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,770
somehow an oppressive branch of the 
patriarchy.

216
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,603
And because of that you have every right
and even obligation to place yourself 

217
00:16:23,271 --> 00:16:26,390
outside of its structure of precedent.
But we don't want to.

218
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:29,870
Police are so outside of the structure 
of precedent of English common law.

219
00:16:29,871 --> 00:16:30,704
I can tell you that it's,
it's one of the supreme achievements of 

220
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:34,250
the human race.
It's,

221
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,323
it's produced societies that are as free
and as productive as any societies have 

222
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:43,331
ever been anywhere on the planet and 
certainly are now and t to dare to state

223
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:47,090
that you would place yourself outside of
that precedent.

224
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,550
That's the sort of thing that made my 
hair stand on end.

225
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,063
And there were other elements of the 
policies that were equally 

226
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:54,170
reprehensible,
not least,

227
00:16:54,171 --> 00:16:56,660
their complete incoherence of 
formulation.

228
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,730
You know,
I couldn't understand some of it,

229
00:16:58,731 --> 00:17:00,830
like I don't understand,
for example,

230
00:17:00,831 --> 00:17:02,820
with regards to the gender,
uh,

231
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,003
propositions,
how it can be that you can be anywhere 

232
00:17:05,631 --> 00:17:07,520
on the gender spectrum,
which by the way,

233
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:08,354
it's not a spectrum technically,
and it actually matters which words you 

234
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:11,360
use.

235
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,193
If you're writing law,
you can be anywhere or nowhere on that 

236
00:17:14,361 --> 00:17:15,194
spectrum.
Like,

237
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,423
I don't know what that means.
And I don't believe that the people who 

238
00:17:18,051 --> 00:17:18,531
wrote it,
no,

239
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:19,364
what it means either.
And you don't write things that you 

240
00:17:21,051 --> 00:17:21,884
don't understand into the damn law.
You don't do that because the law 

241
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:28,910
unfolds in society and it tangles people
up as it unfolds.

242
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,670
And it's no joke when that happens.
So you'll be very,

243
00:17:31,671 --> 00:17:35,270
very careful when you're writing law and
you certainly don't want to write law to

244
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:37,700
push forward your ideological 
commitments,

245
00:17:37,701 --> 00:17:42,170
especially in the face of precedent 
because precedent is what keeps law from

246
00:17:42,171 --> 00:17:45,320
degenerating into audiology essentially.
So and so.

247
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:45,970
Well,
and so,

248
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,600
you know,
tap to answer your question,

249
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:48,923
you know,
more,

250
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:49,830
more,
more,

251
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,873
more fundamentally,
I don't believe that this argument has 

252
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:57,300
ever been about the rights of 
transgender people.

253
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,553
I think that it's an attempt by the 
radical left ideologues to push their 

254
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,070
ideological agenda forward using,
using,

255
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:08,310
they're using attempts to manipulate the
linguistic domain.

256
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,143
And I'm not willing to seat the loot 
linguistic domain because I don't think 

257
00:18:11,911 --> 00:18:12,744
there are any more,
anything more important than the words 

258
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:17,460
that you use.
And then when the government says we,

259
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:18,294
you should start using these words,
you should start thinking hard about 

260
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:21,384
your damn government because your words 
are no different than your thoughts and 

261
00:18:24,691 --> 00:18:26,280
your thoughts.
Orient Yourself,

262
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,343
your thoughts orient you in the world.
And if someone who's going to tell you 

263
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:30,924
what it is that you have to think,
then they're going to disorient you and 

264
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:34,674
the world.
And I wouldn't recommend that because 

265
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:38,250
there's lots of terrible things that can
happen to you.

266
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,293
And if you're disoriented,
you're going to run into a very large 

267
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:44,010
number of them.
So that's how it looks to me.

268
00:18:44,011 --> 00:18:45,010
So,
but,

269
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,820
but the

270
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:50,260
ideological context of this,
it seems like something has changed.

271
00:18:50,261 --> 00:18:51,094
Yes.
Because if you think back decades 

272
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:57,130
earlier,
liberals were,

273
00:18:57,131 --> 00:18:57,964
the champions are free speech.
I guess it was the conservatives at a 

274
00:19:01,511 --> 00:19:04,300
certain moment in time.
Who are the sensors,

275
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,070
you know,
they,

276
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:05,903
they,
they sought to curb a blasphemy and 

277
00:19:08,351 --> 00:19:11,500
obscenity,
sedition and so on.

278
00:19:11,501 --> 00:19:13,360
And the,
and the Liberals said,

279
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,820
no,
free speech is the way we want to go.

280
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:21,310
And yet today that has flipped.
Uh,

281
00:19:21,311 --> 00:19:22,144
if you,
if you look back to what left leaning 

282
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,610
officials and authorities and,
and,

283
00:19:28,611 --> 00:19:30,970
and figures said,
lemme just give you one quote.

284
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,833
This is Samuel Gompers who is the 
founder of the American Federation of 

285
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,580
Labor in 1886 he said this,
he said,

286
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:47,560
the freedom of speech has been granted 
to the people in order that they may say

287
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,490
the things
which,

288
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,370
sorry.
Misquoted,

289
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,630
that have not been granted to the 
people.

290
00:19:55,631 --> 00:19:56,464
In order that they may say the things 
which please and which are based upon 

291
00:20:00,251 --> 00:20:01,084
excepted thought,
but the right to say the things which 

292
00:20:04,841 --> 00:20:05,674
displease the right to say the things 
which may convey the new and yet 

293
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:13,810
unexpected thoughts.
The right to say things even though they

294
00:20:13,811 --> 00:20:14,644
do a wrong.
Now that is not a sentiment now carried 

295
00:20:17,501 --> 00:20:21,730
on by the left and today.
What has happened?

296
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,573
Well again,
I see that it's a consequence of 

297
00:20:25,261 --> 00:20:30,210
continual adjective agitation by I would
say a minority of of the left,

298
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:31,044
the radical left in particular,
and those are people who aren't Marxist 

299
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,693
Slash Neo Marxist in their fundamental 
ideological orientation and have joined 

300
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:44,451
that in an unholy union with the worst 
of French postmodernism and they push it

301
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,530
ideological certainty.
And the thing that,

302
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:51,603
the thing that's really distressing 
about that is that if you know anything 

303
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:54,874
about the history of oppressed people,
let's say much as I hate to engage in 

304
00:20:58,571 --> 00:21:01,150
that particular form of dialogue under 
the current conditions,

305
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:05,770
it's pretty obvious that it's freedom of
speech is freedom.

306
00:21:05,771 --> 00:21:08,920
That's particularly important for people
who don't have anything else,

307
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:09,850
right?
It's,

308
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,120
if you're supporting freedom of speech,
you're not supporting the status quo.

309
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:14,050
I mean,
just think about,

310
00:21:14,051 --> 00:21:14,884
let's,
let's use the logic of the radical 

311
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:16,864
leftists and assume that society is a 
tyrannical hierarchy and the people at 

312
00:21:20,741 --> 00:21:22,600
the top have the upper hand in 
everything,

313
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:28,050
including access to communication.
These people are not your friends.

314
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:41,930
Hmm.
Can you say

315
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:50,653
mark my words,
the sounds of the barbarians pounding 

316
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:55,770
out the gate,
right?

317
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,470
Yeah.
That's all.

318
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,220
I'll tell you again,
that use of in Kuwait,

319
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,393
what would you call it in Kuwait 
sensation is the best formulation of 

320
00:22:15,341 --> 00:22:16,174
their argument.
And there's not much difference between 

321
00:22:18,341 --> 00:22:20,380
knocking on the doors and knocking on 
you.

322
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,520
So keep that in mind.
It's not amusing.

323
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,860
There's nothing to it,
there's nothing for it.

324
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:31,420
The thing that's also quite appalling is
that there's no evidence whatsoever that

325
00:22:31,421 --> 00:22:33,290
the people who are conducting these 
protests,

326
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,143
no.
What it is that they're protesting 

327
00:22:34,931 --> 00:22:36,400
against.
You know,

328
00:22:36,401 --> 00:22:37,234
I was in,

329
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:45,950
all right.

330
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,193
I was in the midst of a discussion and 
attempting to make the case that it's 

331
00:22:51,461 --> 00:22:52,294
freedom of speech.
That's it is what people who have 

332
00:22:54,491 --> 00:22:56,440
nothing still have.
Right.

333
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:00,280
So if you look at the tyrannical 
structure of our society,

334
00:23:00,281 --> 00:23:04,210
let's say the people at the top have 
access to means of communication.

335
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,283
Everyone knows that it's the people at 
the bottom who have the right to say 

336
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:11,290
what they think,
however badly they say it,

337
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,470
that enables them to get a toe hold into
the system and to,

338
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:18,820
and to make their suffering known.
That's what freedom of speech is for.

339
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,940
And so like what's the protest against 
that?

340
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:22,774
And I'll tell you,
you know the rowdy called Neo Marxists 

341
00:23:25,121 --> 00:23:25,954
types.
They speak the language of power and 

342
00:23:27,551 --> 00:23:31,120
that's what you're speaking right now.
And if you want to live in a world where

343
00:23:31,121 --> 00:23:34,840
everyone speaks the language of power,
then just let them do what they're doing

344
00:23:34,841 --> 00:23:37,510
and see what happens.
I wouldn't recommend it.

345
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,690
It's not a pretty rote.
And you're all in a position,

346
00:23:40,691 --> 00:23:41,524
you're on a situation in your life now 
where you have to make decisions about 

347
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:44,614
this sorts of things.
Like is this the sort of institution 

348
00:23:46,581 --> 00:23:47,780
that you want this to be?

349
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:50,980
What are the,
uh,

350
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,833
one of the
arguments against what you said about 

351
00:23:56,161 --> 00:23:57,250
the pronouns.
Yup.

352
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,220
Was that?
Well,

353
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,113
after all,
all you're being asked to do is to say 

354
00:24:03,781 --> 00:24:04,614
something that is reasonable.
It's not unreasonable to address 

355
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,140
somebody by the pronouns that they 
prefer.

356
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,550
And yet,
if you think of any kind of speech which

357
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:22,551
is prescribed,
imagine a statute that said people shall

358
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:28,791
use the words hello and please and thank
you in their conversations.

359
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:34,890
That statute is untenable.
Yes.

360
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:40,430
Because it now requires people to use 
certain words in their conversations,

361
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:44,250
even if those words are reasonable 
themselves.

362
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,370
So that is not the question and it was 
not your case.

363
00:24:47,371 --> 00:24:50,580
You are making that using a pronoun was 
unreasonable in itself,

364
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,830
though I have that correct.
Well,

365
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,050
yeah.
First of all,

366
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,110
there's a couple of things I'd like to 
say about that.

367
00:24:59,010 --> 00:24:59,843
No,
I looked up the process by which the 

368
00:25:02,431 --> 00:25:07,431
Ontario government formulated it's 
legislation with regards to the pronouns

369
00:25:07,531 --> 00:25:08,364
and the consultation process that used 
and the consultation process was deeply 

370
00:25:12,421 --> 00:25:16,260
flawed.
They contacted activists and say,

371
00:25:16,261 --> 00:25:19,260
let's activists of the Trans Community.
Okay,

372
00:25:19,261 --> 00:25:21,870
well there's a couple of things I'd like
to say about that.

373
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:24,510
The first is there is no trans 
community,

374
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,050
right?
Trans people are as diverse as any other

375
00:25:28,051 --> 00:25:28,884
group of people.
And to the idea that somehow because of 

376
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:35,100
one of their attributes,
they constitute a homogenous group is,

377
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:35,901
uh,
well,

378
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:37,700
you think that that would be a false 
with dip,

379
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,543
the people who are concerned about 
treating groups of people adequately 

380
00:25:43,051 --> 00:25:45,840
would be loath to,
to put forward.

381
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,183
But even more importantly,
there's absolutely no evidence 

382
00:25:48,811 --> 00:25:49,644
whatsoever that the activist types are 
actually representatives of any of the 

383
00:25:53,431 --> 00:25:56,970
communities that they hypothetically 
activate on behalf of.

384
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,760
It's like they're not elected,
they're not appointed,

385
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,370
they don't pull,
they do this.

386
00:26:02,371 --> 00:26:03,360
They say,
look,

387
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,673
here's a group.
It's a minority group and it's 

388
00:26:06,961 --> 00:26:10,230
oppressed.
I'm a member of that group and therefore

389
00:26:10,231 --> 00:26:11,850
I stand for the group.
It's like,

390
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,470
actually no,
you don't.

391
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,760
You don't stand for your group.
You may be standing for yourself.

392
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,183
You know,
I don't stand for men and I don't have 

393
00:26:20,641 --> 00:26:22,170
to stand for white men.
I'm not,

394
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,660
I'm not entitled to speak on their 
behalf.

395
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:25,973
And so the idea that it's the trans 
community that wanted this sis I 

396
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,580
completely unsustainable idea.
It's certainly unproven.

397
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,200
I've had like 40 letters from trans 
people since I started to engage in this

398
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,663
call.
It

399
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:44,920
is chaotic battle.
The only one of them was mildly critical

400
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:47,640
of what I was doing.
All the other ones,

401
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,430
there aren't that many trans people,
you know.

402
00:26:50,431 --> 00:26:52,860
So to get 40 letters is actually quite a
few.

403
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,650
And I'm not saying that this is a 
scientific Paul,

404
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,513
but it's at least as scientific as the 
process by which the Ontario government 

405
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,560
generated it's legislation.

406
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:11,720
Hmm.

407
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,553
And I'm not generating legislation.
And what these people said to a person 

408
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:17,534
was,
I didn't ask to be the newest whipping 

409
00:27:21,021 --> 00:27:21,854
boy for the radical postmodernists.
All it's done is made my life more 

410
00:27:25,761 --> 00:27:27,110
difficult.
You know,

411
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,880
that basic letter would say,
well,

412
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:29,714
I'm transitioning from one gender to the
other and it's very difficult and I'm 

413
00:27:32,301 --> 00:27:34,040
not sure that it's the right thing to 
do.

414
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,413
And this has made the process 
spectacularly more difficult on all 

415
00:27:40,881 --> 00:27:42,470
fronts.
It's like,

416
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,393
and these people don't speak for me.
And just because they say they do that 

417
00:27:46,911 --> 00:27:47,744
doesn't mean they do.
And so the other thing that we seem to 

418
00:27:50,271 --> 00:27:53,930
have swallowed as a society is this 
crazy notion that,

419
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,390
well,
first of all that we should be portioned

420
00:27:56,391 --> 00:28:00,230
up into our different minority groups,
which I think is a return to tribalism,

421
00:28:00,231 --> 00:28:01,064
an unbelievably dangerous,
I can't really think of anything more 

422
00:28:03,351 --> 00:28:04,340
dangerous than that.

423
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,773
And then we've swallowed the idea that 
if you identify yourself as a member of 

424
00:28:09,531 --> 00:28:12,320
a minority group and then you bring 
forward a grievance,

425
00:28:12,321 --> 00:28:15,710
you have to be treated as if you're a 
valid representative of that group.

426
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,860
It's like,
Whoa,

427
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:20,210
why in the world would we do that?
It's guilt,

428
00:28:20,211 --> 00:28:21,044
I suppose.
Maybe that's part of it or I think it's 

429
00:28:24,081 --> 00:28:26,510
mostly guilt.
You don't want to stand up and say,

430
00:28:26,511 --> 00:28:27,344
well,
you know who died and made you king so 

431
00:28:29,331 --> 00:28:30,870
to speak.
You know?

432
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:35,120
Can we,
can we stay on that logic for a moment?

433
00:28:35,121 --> 00:28:36,440
The,
the idea.

434
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,303
So this,
this compelled speech material seems to 

435
00:28:41,461 --> 00:28:46,461
insist upon treating people not as 
individuals,

436
00:28:46,981 --> 00:28:47,814
but as members of groups to either blame
them or to favor them as a member of a 

437
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:55,590
group.
Like we take that logic and extend it.

438
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,483
You know that the group identity thing 
becomes intersectionality where you're 

439
00:29:00,361 --> 00:29:01,194
not just blogging to one group,
but you're also have these 

440
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:04,980
characteristics.
Spin that out for us.

441
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,790
What,
what?

442
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:08,550
What is the logic of that?
Where does it lead us to?

443
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,571
Well,
okay,

444
00:29:09,571 --> 00:29:14,350
so the first thing I would say to 
everyone in the room is,

445
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,273
I don't think,
and this is why I decided to do with 

446
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,350
what I did right from the beginning,
you know,

447
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,240
is that I don't want to play the group 
identity game.

448
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,733
I don't want to construe the world in 
those terms and I'm not going to use 

449
00:29:29,741 --> 00:29:33,340
terminology that would require me to 
formulate my thoughts manner.

450
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,383
I think it's a terrible catastrophe to 
divide us all up into our tribal 

451
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:40,180
entities.
I don't see anything positive about that

452
00:29:40,181 --> 00:29:44,020
at all,
so I just don't want to go there.

453
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,640
And then second,
I would say,

454
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:46,503
and maybe this is even more relevant,
you may or may not have heard about 

455
00:29:50,051 --> 00:29:50,884
intersectionality.
Intersectionality is a new development 

456
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:56,140
on the radical left.
And I think it's actually,

457
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,000
if I wasn't so in tandem to Quan 
seriousness in these matters,

458
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,360
I would be constantly laughing about 
intersectionality.

459
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,493
And the reason for that is that it's the
radical left has discovered its own 

460
00:30:08,381 --> 00:30:09,400
Achilles heel.

461
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,893
So look,
what's the problem with dividing us up 

462
00:30:12,491 --> 00:30:15,910
into groups?
Well there's many.

463
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,953
And,
and the descent into tribalism is not 

464
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:20,770
least among them,
but the next is that,

465
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:21,843
well it doesn't,
it turns out that we don't fit into one 

466
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:25,480
group.
Any of us,

467
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:29,170
we fit into multiple groups and it's not
obvious at all.

468
00:30:29,171 --> 00:30:32,560
Which of those groups should take,
should be of paramount importance.

469
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:33,723
You know,
there's a ratio group and an ethnic 

470
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,733
ethnic group and there's groups of 
intelligence and there's groups of 

471
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:39,550
temperament,
new scripts of attractiveness,

472
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:43,210
and there's groups of wealth and you can
multiply them really indefinitely.

473
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,223
And I do mean indefinitely because you 
can categorize a finite number of 

474
00:30:47,351 --> 00:30:49,750
entities,
a virtually infinite number of ways.

475
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,240
And so the intersection lists discovered
this.

476
00:30:52,241 --> 00:30:52,781
They said,
well,

477
00:30:52,781 --> 00:30:54,010
there's,
there's,

478
00:30:54,011 --> 00:30:57,010
let's say there's Latinos and there's,
and there's Asians.

479
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:57,963
It's like,
okay,

480
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:58,960
well wait a minute.

481
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,470
There's male and female Latinos.
And there's male and female Asians,

482
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:07,390
so so do we treat,
is the division into two enough or do we

483
00:31:07,391 --> 00:31:09,520
need a division into for a while?
And then,

484
00:31:09,521 --> 00:31:13,390
well then there's socioeconomic class of
male and female,

485
00:31:13,391 --> 00:31:14,224
Asians and male and female Latinos and,
and you can keep fractionating the 

486
00:31:18,671 --> 00:31:20,920
groups and and technically without,
and,

487
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:23,260
and you actually see this happening in 
real time,

488
00:31:23,261 --> 00:31:25,480
so to speak,
as the,

489
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:31,050
as the acronym for the LGBT activists 
continues to expand really without end.

490
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,620
And see what's at the bottom of 
intersectionality.

491
00:31:35,621 --> 00:31:36,880
And this,
I suspect,

492
00:31:36,881 --> 00:31:40,210
will be discovered eventually by the 
radical leftists if they get that far,

493
00:31:40,211 --> 00:31:43,840
is that you have to fractionate the 
groups right down to the individual.

494
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,880
And that's what Western culture 
discussed in articulated,

495
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:50,740
discovered in articulated over the last 
5,000 years.

496
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:51,760
It's like,
oh,

497
00:31:51,761 --> 00:31:54,490
right.
The group isn't the paramount division.

498
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:58,120
It's the individual because unless you 
treat each person like an individual,

499
00:31:58,121 --> 00:32:01,120
you're not taking all the intersections 
into account.

500
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,840
And so it's extraordinarily,
it's extraordinarily comedic,

501
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:10,530
but it also isn't as if it's treating 
everyone as they're an individual,

502
00:32:11,411 --> 00:32:12,244
as if they're an individual,
is an instant solution that will bring 

503
00:32:14,471 --> 00:32:16,360
us to utopia.
You know,

504
00:32:16,361 --> 00:32:17,194
it's,
it's like Winston Churchill said that 

505
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,420
democracy,
right?

506
00:32:19,421 --> 00:32:20,254
It's,
it's essentially the least terrible 

507
00:32:22,391 --> 00:32:23,224
approach we have.
And Life isn't the sort of problem that 

508
00:32:26,021 --> 00:32:29,110
is amenable to an instantaneous utopian 
solution.

509
00:32:29,111 --> 00:32:29,944
But our best bet is to meet each other 
with the desire for peace and 

510
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:35,374
productivity on this,
on the stage that enables individual 

511
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:41,750
interaction because then we meet soul,
the soul,

512
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:42,584
so to speak.
And we also meet in a domain that we 

513
00:32:44,361 --> 00:32:48,350
bear responsibility for as individuals.
And that's also extremely important,

514
00:32:48,351 --> 00:32:49,184
right?
You should be responsible for what you 

515
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:50,900
say.

516
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,540
You should have to suffer the 
consequences of what you say,

517
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,583
not least so that you learn.
And so the individual is paramount as 

518
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:01,970
far as I'm concerned.
I think that's the fundamental principle

519
00:33:01,971 --> 00:33:02,804
of Western civilization know it's not 
only the west that has come across that 

520
00:33:06,531 --> 00:33:07,364
discovery,
but I think we've done the best job so 

521
00:33:08,841 --> 00:33:09,674
far of articulating it.
And so we don't want to lose that 

522
00:33:12,621 --> 00:33:16,100
because the alternative isn't a 
multicultural utopia.

523
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,570
The alternative is a descent into tribal
barbarism and,

524
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,450
and there are people who would be just 
as happy if that happened.

525
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:28,020
But I would suggest that it's not a 
destiny that in a weak person would,

526
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:30,600
would,
would long for.

527
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:34,980
Yeah.
Do you feel like taking a few questions,

528
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,460
do you feel like taking some questions 
from the students?

529
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,540
Sure.
All right,

530
00:33:39,541 --> 00:33:40,374
so we're going to have questions and 
we'd like you to participate in this 

531
00:33:42,871 --> 00:33:47,871
conversation now.
Please do ask a question.

532
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,490
We welcome you up to say what you'd 
like.

533
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:58,610
If there is a preamble to the question 
that's fairly shorts then so be it.

534
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,383
But please do ask a question.
We're not actually anybody speeches and 

535
00:34:03,421 --> 00:34:05,880
we do primarily want to hear,
but Jordan has to say.

536
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,630
So feel free to line up at the two 
microphones.

537
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:12,540
We'll take one at a time.
Go ahead sir.

538
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,910
Uh,
so first of all,

539
00:34:14,911 --> 00:34:16,890
thank you so much for being here.
I really enjoyed it.

540
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:17,783
Um,

541
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:23,050
[inaudible]

542
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:28,020
and a second,
I'm,

543
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,870
this ties into my question I had just 
last week.

544
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:35,250
My free speech coalition at Bishop's 
University was officially ratified and I

545
00:34:35,251 --> 00:34:38,580
would love to invite you to be our first
guest speaker if that's at all possible.

546
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:40,323
Um,

547
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,613
thank you.

548
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,540
Um,
and my,

549
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,790
my question pertains to this,
um,

550
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:47,643
for Dr. Peterson,
what would you consider the most under 

551
00:34:49,971 --> 00:34:50,804
discussed or overlooked ideas and topics
that you think should be discussed in 

552
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:57,494
the club?
Because I know we're looking for 

553
00:34:58,161 --> 00:34:58,994
controversial ideas that we think are 
maybe not as discussed as much as they 

554
00:35:01,941 --> 00:35:02,774
should be.

555
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:08,400
Well,
that's a difficult question.

556
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,503
I would say that
it isn't obvious to me that on 

557
00:35:14,881 --> 00:35:18,960
university campuses at the present time 
or in the education system in general,

558
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:20,543
we've done a good job of taking stock of
the advantages and disadvantages of our 

559
00:35:24,061 --> 00:35:24,894
current sociopolitical systems now.
And I think there's enough data so that 

560
00:35:29,491 --> 00:35:31,740
we could start having intelligent 
conversation.

561
00:35:31,741 --> 00:35:32,574
So one thing I would recommend to you 
all if you're interested is a book I 

562
00:35:36,211 --> 00:35:39,810
just finished reading.
It's called the great leveler,

563
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,213
the great leveler by Walter Shy Dale.
And it's a discussion of inequality and 

564
00:35:46,381 --> 00:35:48,180
it's a very intelligent book.
So one of,

565
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:51,360
so inequality,
as you may or may not know,

566
00:35:51,361 --> 00:35:54,360
is rife throughout human societies.
Right?

567
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:57,930
And that's the case in the present day.
And it's been the case historically,

568
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,230
but it's also the case in animal 
societies by every measure.

569
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:04,350
So inequality is the rule of life,
let's say.

570
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,410
And that doesn't mean it's not an 
ethical catastrophe.

571
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,393
I'm not saying that,
I'm just saying that the fact of 

572
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:15,930
inequality cannot be laid at the feet of
the west or of capitalism or,

573
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,450
or really have any human construction 
for that matter.

574
00:36:18,451 --> 00:36:22,980
One of the things Shydel did was to 
investigate empirically the relationship

575
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:26,220
between inequality and the pole of 
government.

576
00:36:26,221 --> 00:36:27,054
So because let's say if you,
if you surveyed a very large number of 

577
00:36:30,931 --> 00:36:34,980
states,
you could determine whether this,

578
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,870
the governments were left wing or right 
wing,

579
00:36:36,871 --> 00:36:41,220
and then you could,
you could do a compilation of inequality

580
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,180
coefficients and you could find out if 
left wing governments had any,

581
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,650
any ability to ameliorate inequality.
Just as an empirical question.

582
00:36:49,651 --> 00:36:52,080
And the answer that Shydel generated was
no,

583
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,273
there's no difference whatsoever in the 
inequality coefficiency left and right 

584
00:36:55,861 --> 00:36:56,694
wing states.
And what that points to is a much more 

585
00:36:58,591 --> 00:36:59,850
fundamental problem.

586
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:00,863
And shydel in his book also points out 
that the only known historical forces 

587
00:37:04,561 --> 00:37:05,394
that limit inequality or that produce 
equality are war revolution and 

588
00:37:09,271 --> 00:37:12,900
pestilence.
It's doesn't look like it's easily under

589
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,460
under human control.
And so,

590
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,190
you know,
the Marxists talked about inequality and

591
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,233
the fact that capital tends to 
accumulate in the hands of fewer and 

592
00:37:20,341 --> 00:37:21,174
fewer people,
which is sort of true except that the 

593
00:37:23,131 --> 00:37:26,070
people at the top tend to rotate lot 
more quickly than that.

594
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,830
Then the communists and the Marxists 
separate presumed,

595
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:32,370
but it doesn't look like that's a 
consequence of capitalism.

596
00:37:32,371 --> 00:37:36,000
It looks like it's a much deeper process
and capitalism at least,

597
00:37:36,001 --> 00:37:36,834
well it's shoveling money and resources 
up to the top also does lift the bottom 

598
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,930
very,
very quickly.

599
00:37:42,931 --> 00:37:43,764
You know,
and this is something we need to have a 

600
00:37:44,851 --> 00:37:46,680
serious discussion about it at the 
university.

601
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,380
So like one,
cause we shouldn't be doing this,

602
00:37:49,381 --> 00:37:51,090
we should be partying in the streets.

603
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,073
And here's one reason why do you know 
that the level of absolute poverty in 

604
00:37:55,351 --> 00:37:56,184
the world fell by 50% between the year 
2000 and the year 2012 do you know that 

605
00:38:00,691 --> 00:38:05,430
was three years faster than the most 
optimistic UN projection considered?

606
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:09,240
It was the fastest decline in absolute 
poverty that the world has ever seen.

607
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,970
And like that's a big deal.
You know about,

608
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:13,043
there's hundreds of thousands of people 
that week right now that are being 

609
00:38:15,061 --> 00:38:15,894
connected to the power grid and almost 
everybody has access to high speed 

610
00:38:18,901 --> 00:38:20,480
computation.
And the,

611
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,331
the,
the,

612
00:38:21,331 --> 00:38:22,164
the struggling economies in Africa have 
for the last four years being the 

613
00:38:25,201 --> 00:38:26,034
fastest growing economies in the world 
know there's almost no absolute 

614
00:38:29,191 --> 00:38:30,024
privation left.
There aren't people starving except for 

615
00:38:31,981 --> 00:38:32,814
political reasons.
We're at a point where obesity is the 

616
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:38,290
worst problem than starvation,
you know,

617
00:38:38,291 --> 00:38:39,124
and,
and now I also think that a lot of that 

618
00:38:41,471 --> 00:38:42,304
was purchased out the cost of the,
of the dreams and hopes of the working 

619
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:46,810
class in the west.

620
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:47,643
You know,
I think what we did some stamps for 

621
00:38:48,611 --> 00:38:49,444
about a 30 year period with sacrificed 
the aspirations of the Western working 

622
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:53,914
class to alleviate poverty,
get India and China and in Southeast 

623
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:57,993
Asia.
And it looks like that might've been a 

624
00:38:58,631 --> 00:39:01,120
really good deal,
although it was a little bit hard on the

625
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:03,760
working class people and that has to be 
taken into account,

626
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,960
but we're not having discussions of is 
sort universities.

627
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:07,803
It's like we're stuck in 1980 or maybe 
in 1960 we haven't updated our bottles 

628
00:39:12,161 --> 00:39:12,994
to take into account the new and often 
extraordinarily positive realities and 

629
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:20,380
we're tearing ourselves apart in the 
west with this identity politics,

630
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:23,410
idiocy at the same time that things are 
getting better and better,

631
00:39:23,411 --> 00:39:27,790
faster and faster than they ever have by
a huge margin in the history of mankind.

632
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,193
So it's like,
it's time to wake up and throw off the 

633
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,033
impression of the Cold War and to look 
around and see what's what's available 

634
00:39:37,991 --> 00:39:42,640
in front of us and what we could upon 
that would be much better than Oh yes.

635
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,690
Yeah.
So

636
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,750
told that,
uh,

637
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:57,320
there are developments outside.
I'm sorry for the noise.

638
00:39:57,321 --> 00:39:58,220
The uh,
we'll,

639
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,050
we'll,
we'll they're doing the best they can.

640
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,760
Uh,
yes ma'am.

641
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,690
So was there a fetus and you've said 
that Eric had was,

642
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,700
or one of your most priorities is the 
pursuit of truth.

643
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:10,993
Um,
could you just clarify what you mean 

644
00:40:13,451 --> 00:40:16,850
when you're presented with a situation 
where you have to worry,

645
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:21,580
you're being asked to refer to someone 
to their preferred pronouns and is it,

646
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:25,030
is it a true thing you see,
is it their truth is your truth

647
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,300
be the issue

648
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,430
requested the individual to be addressed
to a certain matter?

649
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,913
It's the compulsion of that by law.
So at least issues get conflated 

650
00:40:39,961 --> 00:40:41,430
constantly.
Look,

651
00:40:41,431 --> 00:40:43,350
I've dealt with all sorts of people in 
my life,

652
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,633
a much broader range of people than most
people ever encounter in the course of 

653
00:40:47,761 --> 00:40:48,594
their entire lives.
And I'm perfectly capable of deciding 

654
00:40:51,691 --> 00:40:54,030
how to treat someone on a one to one 
basis.

655
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,313
But when the demand for,
for terminology becomes part of the 

656
00:40:58,021 --> 00:41:00,750
legal system,
I don't care what the rationale is,

657
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:03,120
it's not happening as far as I'm 
concerned.

658
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,010
And people say,
well,

659
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,080
we're pushing it forward because of 
compassion.

660
00:41:07,081 --> 00:41:09,960
And maybe you could start just being 
such a mean professor.

661
00:41:09,961 --> 00:41:11,880
It's like,
why should I believe that?

662
00:41:11,881 --> 00:41:15,300
You know what the hell you're doing with
your compelling laws.

663
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,050
You're willing to,
you're willing to move past illegal wine

664
00:41:19,051 --> 00:41:22,140
in the sand that's been drawn for let's 
say 700 years.

665
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,063
You do not write compelled speech into 
the legislation all but we're doing it 

666
00:41:26,221 --> 00:41:28,320
with the best of intense.
Yeah,

667
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,490
no,
you're not.

668
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:33,560
So these issues have to be separate.
Look,

669
00:41:33,561 --> 00:41:34,070
if this was

670
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,903
about transgender rights,
it would have disappeared in September 

671
00:41:38,391 --> 00:41:42,890
of 2016 it's not about transgender 
rights and everyone knows it.

672
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:46,220
So this is not about transgender rights.
What these,

673
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,173
what these people are doing outside.
It's about something far deeper than 

674
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:53,210
that.
But can we ask the question this way?

675
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,113
Can we say,
don't it doesn't everybody have the 

676
00:41:57,261 --> 00:41:58,094
rights,
the liberty to decide how to present 

677
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:05,360
themselves?
You know how to be who they want to be,

678
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:07,710
what to wear.
You know what,

679
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,580
what gender to call themselves.
And the answer is yes.

680
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:16,030
Everybody has the liberty to do that.
What everybody else has liberty too.

681
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,213
And the liberty to do that doesn't mean 
they have the right to compel other 

682
00:42:21,711 --> 00:42:24,050
people to agree with it.
In other words,

683
00:42:24,051 --> 00:42:24,884
liberty is not the right to demand that 
the world validate the choices that 

684
00:42:28,941 --> 00:42:30,710
you've made.
You have your choices,

685
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:31,723
you have the freedom to make the choices
and everybody else has the freedom to 

686
00:42:34,611 --> 00:42:37,370
make their choices too and to approve or
disapprove.

687
00:42:37,371 --> 00:42:39,110
But they call you this or like all your 
that.

688
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,033
In other words,
liberty is a two way street and 

689
00:42:42,141 --> 00:42:44,510
everybody has it.
And the fact that you've made choices,

690
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:45,603
it doesn't mean everybody else doesn't 
have the same ability to make the same 

691
00:42:47,781 --> 00:42:48,614
choices.

692
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:56,953
Yeah.

693
00:42:58,930 --> 00:42:59,441
Back,
back.

694
00:42:59,441 --> 00:43:00,280
Mike,
Please go ahead.

695
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,620
Hi,
that was loud.

696
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,080
I just want to thank you for being here.
I'm really big fan and um,

697
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:09,520
I have a bad habit of making or,
uh,

698
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:13,540
getting in arguments with a lot of 
radical leftists and I'm the most common

699
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:14,403
argument they present to me,
I generally is bills you 16 only covers 

700
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:19,383
the Ontario human rights code.
So those are protected areas under the 

701
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:23,621
Ontario Human Rights Code,
uh,

702
00:43:23,621 --> 00:43:24,580
such as,
uh,

703
00:43:24,581 --> 00:43:25,780
universities,
uh,

704
00:43:25,781 --> 00:43:27,190
elementary schools,
et cetera.

705
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:31,240
I was just wondering how you would 
combat this argument?

706
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:34,330
Seeing is their argument is generally,
um,

707
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:38,380
they're only dealing with vulnerable 
groups such as young students and um,

708
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:39,370
he's still good about

709
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,630
it doesn't matter.
They say,

710
00:43:41,631 --> 00:43:43,670
well it's,
it's restricted in scope.

711
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:45,200
Yeah.
It's not restricted enough.

712
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:47,050
Look,
I mean,

713
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,300
here's a couple of facts.
Okay.

714
00:43:50,301 --> 00:43:51,134
So

715
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:54,450
when I first made my video is about bill
sees 16,

716
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,553
one of the things that I suggested was 
that the act of making the video itself 

717
00:43:59,251 --> 00:44:02,250
could well have been illegal.
And of course,

718
00:44:02,251 --> 00:44:06,810
people immediately accused me of fear 
mongering done perhaps with reasons.

719
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:07,763
It's not always easy to understand the 
full intent of the new piece of 

720
00:44:10,711 --> 00:44:14,010
legislation surrounding policies.
But I can tell you one thing.

721
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,690
When the lawyers at the University of 
Toronto read through the new legislation

722
00:44:18,691 --> 00:44:19,524
and the surrounding policies,
they also decided that what I was doing 

723
00:44:21,961 --> 00:44:25,950
might've been transgressing the law.
And that's why they wrote me two letters

724
00:44:25,951 --> 00:44:27,260
telling me to stop.

725
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,600
Okay.
So that's fact number one.

726
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,160
Okay.
Fact

727
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,810
number two two words.
Lindsay Shepherd.

728
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:46,323
Okay,
so

729
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,473
let's say for the argument that I'm a 
paranoid megalomaniac and that I'm a 

730
00:44:51,901 --> 00:44:52,734
bigot and all of the other things that 
people have decided that I might be 

731
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:56,401
okay.
Well,

732
00:44:56,401 --> 00:45:00,090
I'll tell you what,
in my paranoid Megalomania,

733
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:04,080
I never envisioned a situation where a 
teaching assistant,

734
00:45:04,081 --> 00:45:04,914
a 22 year old teaching assistant at a 
major Canadian university would be hold 

735
00:45:08,641 --> 00:45:09,474
in front of a quasi myo is inquisition 
and have to record it because she dared 

736
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:15,444
to show five minutes of a video from a 
mainstream news program run by public 

737
00:45:21,061 --> 00:45:23,670
television funded by the government of 
Ontario.

738
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,330
So paranoid as I was,
let's say,

739
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:30,450
it isn't obvious that I was paranoid 
enough.

740
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:33,100
So,
and I don't see that.

741
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:37,710
I don't see how either of those examples
can be disputed.

742
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:40,050
You know,
it wasn't like the University of Toronto

743
00:45:40,051 --> 00:45:42,420
wrote me two letters without thinking 
about it.

744
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:46,830
They went and consulted their high 
powered lawyers and the lawyers reviewed

745
00:45:46,831 --> 00:45:48,870
the policies and the legislation and 
they thought,

746
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:50,070
oh,
Dr. Peterson,

747
00:45:50,071 --> 00:45:52,260
he might be contravening that 
legislation.

748
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,333
It's like,
it was a weird paradoxical gift to me 

749
00:45:55,531 --> 00:45:56,364
that they sent out those two letters 
telling me to stop because it was 

750
00:45:58,591 --> 00:46:01,590
instant proof that what I was doing was,
um,

751
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:05,130
I wouldn't say right because God only 
knows about that.

752
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,233
But at least it,
my interpretation of the bill and its 

753
00:46:08,761 --> 00:46:09,594
intent was correct.
So can we just make this observation 

754
00:46:13,591 --> 00:46:14,460
that,
that,

755
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:19,230
that response to Jordan's critique of 
[inaudible] 16,

756
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,860
the one that went,
oh he's overreacting.

757
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:27,250
Nobody's going to be punished or sent to
jail for this is silly in this stance.

758
00:46:27,471 --> 00:46:31,370
Remember,
every single legal rule there is,

759
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:37,020
is a legal rule only because it is 
backed with the mom,

760
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:40,190
monopolistic violence of the state.
They're re

761
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:45,530
[inaudible].

762
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:51,260
There's no such thing as a rural without
punishment.

763
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:52,880
So if,
if for example,

764
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:56,990
there's a no parking sign,
what the practice science says,

765
00:46:56,991 --> 00:46:59,360
oh by the way,
please don't park here.

766
00:46:59,361 --> 00:47:00,194
But there are no tickets.
Well people are going to park cause 

767
00:47:03,081 --> 00:47:03,914
that's not really a rule.
So if you have a rule in the human 

768
00:47:06,651 --> 00:47:08,630
rights code,
and if you breach it,

769
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:13,310
if that's discrimination,
well then true that the first thing that

770
00:47:13,311 --> 00:47:15,440
happens to you is not going to be thrown
in jail.

771
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:19,010
But there's a process,
a series of steps,

772
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,400
right?
The first one might be a mediation or an

773
00:47:22,401 --> 00:47:24,290
investigation,
and then there might be a fine.

774
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:25,663
And then if you don't pay the fine,
then your wages might be garnished or 

775
00:47:28,281 --> 00:47:30,820
you might be ordered to fix it.
But believe me,

776
00:47:30,821 --> 00:47:33,970
if you refuse and refuse and refuse and 
refuse,

777
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,193
that order will become a court order.
And then if you don't obey the court 

778
00:47:38,621 --> 00:47:40,570
order,
you'll be in contempt of court.

779
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:43,690
And then that will lead to arrest and a 
presentment.

780
00:47:43,691 --> 00:47:46,480
So every single rule in the human rights
code

781
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:53,160
is effectively enforced with the most 
severe violence the state has,

782
00:47:53,741 --> 00:47:54,574
even though it's not actually practiced 
most of the time because most people 

783
00:47:58,091 --> 00:47:58,924
obey

784
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:02,240
when we,
we also don't want to underestimate,

785
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:03,623
I don't know how many of you have had 
the pleasure of being dragged before a 

786
00:48:06,441 --> 00:48:07,274
board that investigates your behavior,
but I would tell you that even if you 

787
00:48:10,911 --> 00:48:11,744
don't end up paying a fine or in jail,
there's nothing particularly pleasant 

788
00:48:14,811 --> 00:48:17,390
about the process itself.
It's enough.

789
00:48:17,391 --> 00:48:19,820
You know,
you wonder why people don't speak up and

790
00:48:19,821 --> 00:48:20,654
I can tell you one of the reasons that 
they don't speak up is because merely 

791
00:48:22,851 --> 00:48:25,370
being dragged in front of a board of 
inquiry,

792
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:30,590
innocent or guilty is enough to pretty 
much do you in for a whole year.

793
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:31,773
Like if you're a sensible person and 
you're concerned with propriety and you 

794
00:48:35,601 --> 00:48:39,380
want to maintain the stability of your 
life and your reputation is important to

795
00:48:39,381 --> 00:48:41,700
you,
perhaps because of the stip,

796
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:46,040
the stability of your family depends on 
it to be investigated for such things as

797
00:48:46,041 --> 00:48:47,810
a punishment.
All of it's all,

798
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:48,733
it's no,
it's no pleasant business and many of 

799
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:51,494
you will stuff I would,
I would equate being investigated by a 

800
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:56,533
non punitive port,
let's say with these punishments that 

801
00:48:59,121 --> 00:49:00,980
Bruce described quite hard on the 
distance.

802
00:49:00,981 --> 00:49:01,814
I would equate that to having a,
a fairly serious disease in terms of 

803
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:06,913
its,
in terms of it's psychological and 

804
00:49:08,541 --> 00:49:12,630
physical impact.
I would also say no,

805
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:17,680
I won't say it.
Let's go with an express right place.

806
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:18,523
Thank you.

807
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,650
First of all,
they can vote

808
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:25,450
as embarrassing as what's happening out 
there is for peace university.

809
00:49:25,451 --> 00:49:26,920
I think what it does want to hate your 
show,

810
00:49:26,921 --> 00:49:29,650
how we're doing here is and how we can,
those people are so thank you.

811
00:49:29,651 --> 00:49:30,484
First of all,

812
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:38,980
in terms of my question,

813
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:41,600
most of your belief that it's extremely 
important.

814
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:42,880
Everything that we're doing,
um,

815
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,650
to speak our mind speaking really that's
why we're here.

816
00:49:45,651 --> 00:49:47,810
But um,
in terms of practicality,

817
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:51,060
there's a lot of things that get in the 
way of her license students.

818
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:53,650
We have our
prospective.

819
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:54,680
So,
um,

820
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:55,543
in terms of practicality,
what are kind of maybe your tips and 

821
00:49:58,071 --> 00:50:01,550
your perspective on the steps that 
students can take to kind of speak their

822
00:50:01,551 --> 00:50:05,980
mind while not sacrificing your future 
prospects?

823
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:07,303
Well,
I can tell you a couple of things that 

824
00:50:08,661 --> 00:50:09,494
are very practical.
Don't write in your essay is what you 

825
00:50:12,741 --> 00:50:13,574
think the professor wants to hear.
There's absolutely no excuse whatsoever 

826
00:50:18,741 --> 00:50:20,150
for doing that.
Now,

827
00:50:20,151 --> 00:50:22,340
first of all,
most professors,

828
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:27,020
even those who have descended into a 
state of ideological possession,

829
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,250
say most

830
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:29,083
of them still have enough character to 
braid and essay that's well written 

831
00:50:33,501 --> 00:50:36,050
properly.
So you're actually taking less of a risk

832
00:50:36,051 --> 00:50:38,720
than you would think by stating what you
have to stay.

833
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:42,980
But if you start practicing when you 
were in university glue mistakes,

834
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:46,520
you're rather low pandering to the 
audience,

835
00:50:46,521 --> 00:50:50,000
let's say and say,
what do you think will get you buy?

836
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:52,400
You're going to train yourself to do 
that.

837
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:53,383
And what that means is you're going to 
train yourself in the false 

838
00:50:55,191 --> 00:50:56,024
certification of your character and your
character is the only thing you have to 

839
00:50:59,241 --> 00:51:02,090
guide you through life.
No people dream of riches.

840
00:51:02,091 --> 00:51:03,770
And they dream of luxury and all of 
that.

841
00:51:03,771 --> 00:51:07,820
But that's a thin defense against the 
harsh realities of world.

842
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:08,683
You have your character.
And so what you do when you go to 

843
00:51:10,731 --> 00:51:11,564
university is you learn to see what you 
think is clearly as you can and to take 

844
00:51:15,201 --> 00:51:16,970
the slings and arrows that come along 
with that.

845
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:18,500
Not In an arrogant manner,
right?

846
00:51:18,501 --> 00:51:20,120
Because like,
what the hell do you know?

847
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:22,190
You know,
so you've got plenty to learn,

848
00:51:22,191 --> 00:51:23,960
but you want to formulate your thoughts 
carefully.

849
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:26,120
You want to write what you think.
Well,

850
00:51:26,121 --> 00:51:28,250
why?
Because when you're writing,

851
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,173
you're thinking,
you're laying out the arguments that 

852
00:51:32,241 --> 00:51:33,074
you're going to use to structure your 
existence in the world throughout your 

853
00:51:36,441 --> 00:51:39,370
entire life.
And if you start to twist and bend those

854
00:51:39,371 --> 00:51:42,650
for expedient reasons,
you're going to warp your soul.

855
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:43,933
And I mean,
I could talk about that 

856
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:46,820
neurophysiologically if you want to,
you know,

857
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:51,890
you become what you practice,
you automate what you practice.

858
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,750
So if you automate expedient speech for 
the sake of short term gain,

859
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,370
then that's what you're going to 
produce.

860
00:51:58,371 --> 00:52:00,920
You're going to produce expedient speech
for short term gain.

861
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:02,870
Well,
God help you if you do that,

862
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:04,023
like there is nothing that you will 
possibly do in your entire life that 

863
00:52:08,991 --> 00:52:13,760
will serve you better than to get 
control of your voice in university.

864
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:16,100
I remember seeing you do that by 
reading,

865
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,230
right?
You read great people.

866
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:19,183
You do that by writing what you think.
You stay true to yourself while you 

867
00:52:22,281 --> 00:52:23,114
write what you think,
and you take the risks and you gain the 

868
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:25,574
benefits that go along with that.
You learn to stand up and speak and to 

869
00:52:28,611 --> 00:52:29,444
listen carefully,
and that makes you a negotiator of 

870
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:32,953
unparalleled power.
And if you're a negotiator of 

871
00:52:35,061 --> 00:52:35,894
unparalleled power,
there's nothing in the world that won't 

872
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:38,654
open itself up to you.
So that's what you're doing in 

873
00:52:41,031 --> 00:52:43,520
university.
And if you find professors who,

874
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,510
who reject that,
and there's fewer of them than you might

875
00:52:47,511 --> 00:52:48,344
think,
then it's your sacred obligation to 

876
00:52:51,891 --> 00:52:52,724
stand up for yourself against that,
because it's going to happen to you 

877
00:52:55,611 --> 00:52:56,444
throughout your whole life.
And you might as well start practicing 

878
00:52:58,401 --> 00:53:02,600
how to do it right now.
So that's how it looks to me.

879
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:03,950
Yeah.
There's an old saying that I,

880
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,000
I right.

881
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:10,690
[inaudible]

882
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,353
I write in order to know what I think.
And you'll note how compelled speech 

883
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:22,320
interferes in that process.
Yes.

884
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:23,423
So the idea that you have to write what 
your wants is the form of compelled 

885
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:28,340
speech.
It's like it.

886
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:32,460
I really do believe that this is a 
fundamental issue as a therapist,

887
00:53:32,461 --> 00:53:36,240
say when I'm trying to help someone set 
their life straight,

888
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:40,440
I do my best not to compel their speech.
And the reason for that is quite clear.

889
00:53:40,441 --> 00:53:45,441
It's like you have your destiny with all
its attended triumphs and sufferings and

890
00:53:46,651 --> 00:53:50,430
it's on your shoulders.
I don't want to tell you how to think.

891
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:51,623
I don't want to tell you how to think 
because I do not know how you should 

892
00:53:54,031 --> 00:53:56,940
think.
You have to figure that out for yourself

893
00:53:56,970 --> 00:53:59,760
and then you have to bear the 
responsibility for that.

894
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:03,360
And you,
you were a terribly arrogant fool.

895
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:04,193
If you dare to tell someone else how it 
is that they should conduct themselves 

896
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:09,420
through life.
Now.

897
00:54:09,421 --> 00:54:11,310
I mean,
having said that,

898
00:54:11,311 --> 00:54:12,690
while obviously I say,
well,

899
00:54:12,691 --> 00:54:14,880
you should tell the truth,
or at least you shouldn't lie,

900
00:54:14,881 --> 00:54:17,660
but that's not a dictate of,
of,

901
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:19,340
of,
of,

902
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:20,850
of action,
so to speak.

903
00:54:20,851 --> 00:54:23,160
It's a dictate of process.
It's like,

904
00:54:23,161 --> 00:54:23,761
well,
you can't,

905
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:24,594
you shouldn't interfere with the 
mechanism that allows you to solve all 

906
00:54:27,121 --> 00:54:29,310
the problems that you will face in your 
life.

907
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:32,360
And you come to university maybe to 
prepare for,

908
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:33,180
uh,
for a,

909
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:34,450
for a profession,
no,

910
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:35,453
and to set yourself up economically,
but to set yourself economic up 

911
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:40,050
economically,
properly.

912
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,120
I don't care what your profession is 
going to be.

913
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,230
There is no one who is more powerful 
than someone who can communicate.

914
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:49,770
It doesn't matter what the field,
it doesn't matter if you're a plumber or

915
00:54:49,771 --> 00:54:50,604
a politician.
If you can formulate your thoughts 

916
00:54:52,531 --> 00:54:55,890
clearly.
If you can conduct yourself honorably in

917
00:54:55,891 --> 00:54:59,820
your action and your speech,
if you're articulate and careful,

918
00:54:59,821 --> 00:55:00,654
then the world opens itself up to you.
You have an unlimited horizon of 

919
00:55:04,441 --> 00:55:06,900
possibility.
So thank you very much.

920
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,053
Yup.

921
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:13,130
[inaudible].

922
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:17,820
Oh,
thank you both for coming with,

923
00:55:17,821 --> 00:55:18,654
firstly,
I'd like to thank everyone in the room 

924
00:55:20,161 --> 00:55:23,280
was not devolved into the hysteria we 
see outside.

925
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:24,383
They would prefer that we lost our 
sanity and that our society with 

926
00:55:27,901 --> 00:55:31,290
fracture into the nonsense we see.
So by sitting here,

927
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:34,890
being as patient as you are,
this is how we keep our academy.

928
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:37,080
This is how we keep our society.
Thank you.

929
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:42,490
[inaudible]

930
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:48,770
my question is a simple one.
Uh,

931
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:52,200
we see more and more of this new 
language I call of leftism,

932
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,820
intersectionality,
equity,

933
00:55:53,821 --> 00:55:55,200
diversity,
inclusion,

934
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,333
and we see people from all political and
philosophical stripes adopting this new 

935
00:56:00,541 --> 00:56:01,374
vernacular.
Is this in any way dignifying that as a 

936
00:56:04,381 --> 00:56:05,214
position,
is this dignifying the philosophical 

937
00:56:08,071 --> 00:56:08,904
bases of these words?
Do people recognize that when they use 

938
00:56:11,551 --> 00:56:12,384
these links,
these words that they were making that 

939
00:56:14,401 --> 00:56:17,700
somehow a truth that we all ought to 
accept?

940
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,080
I don't,
should we or should we not?

941
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:19,943
I don't think people,

942
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:22,000
you recognize that.
Again,

943
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,660
you know,
I'd like reiterate,

944
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:27,330
the reason I made those videos to begin 
with was because I don't,

945
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:28,623
I was unwilling to cede the linguistic 
territory as soon as you think it's 

946
00:56:32,231 --> 00:56:33,064
already happening to some degree.
So imagine that we just defined the 

947
00:56:36,341 --> 00:56:39,250
sociopolitical landscape in terms of 
identity politics,

948
00:56:39,251 --> 00:56:40,900
which is happening very rapidly.
In fact,

949
00:56:40,901 --> 00:56:42,460
we're compelled to do so.
Right?

950
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,560
So,
um,

951
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:47,830
well then,
then what happens is you get activity on

952
00:56:47,831 --> 00:56:52,690
the identity politics front on the left 
and on the right the left says,

953
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:53,973
well,
the oppressed shall rise and take their 

954
00:56:55,361 --> 00:56:57,550
rightful place.
And the right says,

955
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:59,170
yeah,
over my dead body,

956
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:00,183
and probably yours too.
So as soon as we played the identity 

957
00:57:03,551 --> 00:57:06,070
politics game,
that's where we're at.

958
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,860
And we start playing it by accepting the
terminology.

959
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,233
You know,
already I find myself stumbling when I 

960
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:13,870
use the word sex instead of gender.

961
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,513
And that's not good.
Like I have to consciously overcome a 

962
00:57:17,681 --> 00:57:21,730
resistance to use the word sex instead 
of gender because you know,

963
00:57:21,731 --> 00:57:26,290
I'm actually quite an agreeable person 
and it actually pains me to,

964
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:29,020
to go against the crowd.
Let's say,

965
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:29,883
you know,
I'm not temperamentally suited for it 

966
00:57:31,001 --> 00:57:32,830
precisely,
strangely enough.

967
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:38,070
And so I feel the compulsion to use this
kind of language welling up inside of me

968
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:41,230
just to be,
to be nice,

969
00:57:41,231 --> 00:57:42,640
I suppose,
you know,

970
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:46,390
but I know where identity politics 
leads.

971
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:50,710
It leads to the ghoulag.
It leads to the concentration camps.

972
00:57:50,711 --> 00:57:54,280
It leads to blood in the streets.
We don't need that here.

973
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:57,700
We're doing pretty well.
So we could leave it.

974
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:03,260
[inaudible]

975
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:08,740
hi,
Professor Peterson.

976
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,840
Uh,
I studied history for the duration of my

977
00:58:10,841 --> 00:58:15,610
degree and I think it's just a 
sickeningly ironic that the people who,

978
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:17,710
uh,
are using their free speech,

979
00:58:17,711 --> 00:58:21,340
one to take away your free speech and 
furthermore,

980
00:58:21,341 --> 00:58:22,174
that they can't see the irony of the 
situation of how tyrannical there being 

981
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:25,961
a,
my question is,

982
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:26,794
however,
I've noticed from a lot of what you've 

983
00:58:28,781 --> 00:58:31,680
talked about and I've been watching you 
since your rise in 2060,

984
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,610
2016,
um,

985
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:36,280
and I know that you're a Christian and I
don't want to divulge into that,

986
00:58:36,281 --> 00:58:41,260
but I notice a lot of sort of North 
American Protestant work ethic in,

987
00:58:41,470 --> 00:58:42,190
in,
uh,

988
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:43,210
in your lessons.
Like,

989
00:58:43,211 --> 00:58:43,960
you know,
uh,

990
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,880
self redemption and to be your own 
person.

991
00:58:45,881 --> 00:58:48,580
Like we've been talking about that last 
like hour and a half I suppose.

992
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:53,440
And um,
in a ever rising tide where people are,

993
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,363
or rather in the western world where 
it's becoming increasingly rather 

994
00:58:57,371 --> 00:58:59,800
decreasingly Christian and specifically 
it's,

995
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:00,693
yeah.
Decreasingly religious in this 

996
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:04,300
specifically decreasingly Christian,
how can you,

997
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:09,010
what do you think is the best suggestion
in order to be able to uphold those such

998
00:59:09,011 --> 00:59:11,770
important values that have been across 
the world,

999
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:12,683
uh,
from the American cultural influences 

1000
00:59:13,701 --> 00:59:15,940
since the end of the Second World War?
I apologize for the long question.

1001
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:16,780
No,
no,

1002
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:19,300
it's fine.
The no,

1003
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:22,430
people have asked me repeatedly my 
religious views,

1004
00:59:22,431 --> 00:59:23,264
and I've
answered them in a variety of different 

1005
00:59:26,121 --> 00:59:28,160
ways,
but they say,

1006
00:59:28,161 --> 00:59:29,750
do you believe in God,
let's say?

1007
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:32,330
And my response to that always is,
well,

1008
00:59:32,331 --> 00:59:35,120
I don't know what you mean when you ask 
me that question.

1009
00:59:35,121 --> 00:59:38,180
So I don't know how to answer it.
I don't know what you mean by belief,

1010
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:42,770
but I can tell you something that I 
believe and I would say this is a way of

1011
00:59:42,771 --> 00:59:46,310
speaking symbolically.
I do believe so.

1012
00:59:46,311 --> 00:59:48,140
I was thinking the other day and we 
could go,

1013
00:59:48,141 --> 00:59:51,500
I was thinking about this I this little 
fantasy that entered my mind.

1014
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:56,570
I was thinking about Saint Joseph's 
oratorial in Montreal and Saint Joseph's

1015
00:59:56,571 --> 00:59:58,550
oratory.
It was a very large religious building.

1016
00:59:58,551 --> 00:59:59,384
It's one of the biggest cathedral like 
structures in the world and it's set on 

1017
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:05,300
the hill and mount royal and it's set up
where it can catch the sun,

1018
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:05,900
you know?

1019
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:08,450
So it's an image of the heavenly city on
the hill,

1020
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,313
right?
It's an image of the structures that we 

1021
01:00:11,301 --> 01:00:12,134
strive to create.
That's what it is in independent of its 

1022
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:17,300
specifically Christian or religious 
function.

1023
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:19,520
That's what it stands for symbolically.
Okay.

1024
01:00:19,521 --> 01:00:20,870
So it's the city on the hill.
It's,

1025
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:25,220
it's what we're striving towards when we
walk up hill in life.

1026
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:26,323
Okay.
Now,

1027
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:27,343
the way that the oratory was structured,
there's hundreds of steps leading to it 

1028
01:00:30,531 --> 01:00:31,364
up front.
And in the early part of the 20th 

1029
01:00:32,931 --> 01:00:33,764
century,
a lot of people who had physical 

1030
01:00:34,521 --> 01:00:35,354
disabilities came there and they 
struggled up the step on their crutches 

1031
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:40,550
and many of them left their crutches in 
the oratorial.

1032
01:00:40,551 --> 01:00:42,380
You can see hundreds of them if you go 
there.

1033
01:00:42,381 --> 01:00:43,214
It's quite an interesting site.
And I was thinking about that and I was 

1034
01:00:45,921 --> 01:00:48,800
thinking about what that meant and this 
is what it means.

1035
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:53,060
It means that you know,
everyone has their disabilities,

1036
01:00:53,061 --> 01:00:55,520
let's say,
and I know that some people are far more

1037
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:58,850
terribly effected than other people.
I'm perfectly aware of that.

1038
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:01,310
But the question is what do you do about
that?

1039
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,144
And what you do is you,
you set yourself up on your damn 

1040
01:01:04,581 --> 01:01:07,550
crutches and you struggle up the bloody 
hill.

1041
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:11,810
That's what you do.
And you struggle up the hill towards the

1042
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:12,643
Kingdom of God.
That's what you do because the 

1043
01:01:13,611 --> 01:01:16,190
alternative is to descend into the 
abyss.

1044
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:19,160
That's the alternative.
And then so to say,

1045
01:01:19,161 --> 01:01:19,994
well,
do you believe it's like I believe that 

1046
01:01:21,111 --> 01:01:25,100
you should struggle uphill towards the 
city of God on your crutches.

1047
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:26,953
That's what you should do.
That's the opposite of the descent into 

1048
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:32,570
the abyss.
And so that's,

1049
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:35,510
that's at the foundation of our 
civilization.

1050
01:01:35,511 --> 01:01:37,220
That idea.
Well,

1051
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:38,810
argue with it.
If you will,

1052
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:41,990
see if you can figure out why that's not
an acceptable idea.

1053
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,240
Maybe you should help someone's struggle
up the hill.

1054
01:01:44,241 --> 01:01:45,830
Perhaps you should,
you know,

1055
01:01:45,831 --> 01:01:46,664
you can lend a hand to someone or you 
don't want to take the burden away from 

1056
01:01:49,311 --> 01:01:53,600
them entirely because there's something 
noble about struggling up the Damn Hill,

1057
01:01:53,601 --> 01:01:55,400
right?
There's something that's adventure.

1058
01:01:55,401 --> 01:01:58,520
That's the call to proper being.
It's like,

1059
01:01:58,521 --> 01:02:01,910
well we don't need to forget this.
No,

1060
01:02:01,970 --> 01:02:02,803
we don't need to forget it.
The universities have been there since 

1061
01:02:05,151 --> 01:02:10,151
time in memorial to try to push that 
idea forward through the generations and

1062
01:02:10,281 --> 01:02:13,100
everyone needs to know that idea.
That's what gives you life,

1063
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:15,830
not happiness.
Forget about that.

1064
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:17,900
If it comes while,
great,

1065
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,640
except it dignity,
nobility,

1066
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,740
character,
truth,

1067
01:02:22,741 --> 01:02:24,540
responsibility,
beauty.

1068
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:27,470
Those are the things to aim for honor to
and say.

1069
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:31,980
[inaudible] thank you very much and I 
hope when all this is done,

1070
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:32,814
I hope you take a nice long,
big vacation cause I think you really 

1071
01:02:34,111 --> 01:02:34,944
deserve it.

1072
01:02:39,570 --> 01:02:40,403
Hello.

1073
01:02:41,930 --> 01:02:43,310
Okay.
Peterson first,

1074
01:02:43,311 --> 01:02:48,311
thank you for coming and I'm so I'm 
trying to ease my parents grew up in the

1075
01:02:50,091 --> 01:02:50,924
cultural revolution of China,
so I took particular attention when you 

1076
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:55,903
mentioned the multiple occasions 
comparing what's happening in the West 

1077
01:02:59,211 --> 01:03:00,620
right now,
two miles,

1078
01:03:00,621 --> 01:03:01,454
China and I,
I agree and it's pretty obvious the 

1079
01:03:03,981 --> 01:03:07,850
connection between their radiology,
the identity politics and the oppression

1080
01:03:07,851 --> 01:03:08,684
versus oppressed viewpoints.
But my question is mostly about how 

1081
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,220
they're promoting the political agenda.
I mean,

1082
01:03:16,221 --> 01:03:17,054
I see that the political agenda,
the philosophy behind the political 

1083
01:03:19,841 --> 01:03:20,674
gender are very similar,
but at the same time I see a shocking 

1084
01:03:24,201 --> 01:03:27,500
similarity in the way that they're 
promoting that political agenda.

1085
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:31,280
Specifically backing back in the culture
revolution,

1086
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:32,293
anyone who dare to say anything that 
it's not fully for the movement was 

1087
01:03:36,621 --> 01:03:37,454
classified as Ntu revolutionary.
Just as now who anyone who dare to say 

1088
01:03:41,751 --> 01:03:42,584
anything that goes remotely,
not fully aligning with whatever they 

1089
01:03:46,671 --> 01:03:50,270
want to promote is classified as hate 
speech.

1090
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,450
Although it has nothing to do with hate 
hating anybody.

1091
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:57,440
So since the same thing is happening 
here and a mouse,

1092
01:03:57,441 --> 01:03:59,720
China,
what would you say?

1093
01:03:59,721 --> 01:03:59,941
Well,
what?

1094
01:03:59,941 --> 01:04:00,774
What do you think is the connection 
between the philosophy and veer idiotic 

1095
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:08,260
s over simplifying and tyrannical way of
him,

1096
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:09,740
of trying to promoting it?

1097
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:12,660
Well,
the first thing,

1098
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:14,213
the first thing we should make clear is 
that there is such a thing as hate 

1099
01:04:17,731 --> 01:04:19,730
speech,
right?

1100
01:04:19,770 --> 01:04:20,603
Like let's not be naive about this and 
you can use words to inflame and words 

1101
01:04:24,751 --> 01:04:25,584
can be very dangerous tools.
People use them and hateful matters all 

1102
01:04:28,771 --> 01:04:30,810
the time.
That's not the issue.

1103
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:31,913
That's obvious.
The issue is whether or not you should 

1104
01:04:35,461 --> 01:04:38,820
regulate out and even more importantly 
whether the state should regulate it.

1105
01:04:38,821 --> 01:04:42,300
And the reason that's an issue is 
because who's going to define it?

1106
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:44,850
I'll tell you who's going to define hate
speech.

1107
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:45,953
It's the people who are doing that that 
are going to define hate speech and 

1108
01:04:48,421 --> 01:04:51,900
right now they're are defining you 
sitting in here as hate speech.

1109
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:54,720
I mean that's exactly what's going on 
while we sit here.

1110
01:04:54,721 --> 01:04:59,310
It's like who would be interested in 
defining the parameters of hate speech?

1111
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:00,233
Here's the answer.
The people that you would least want to 

1112
01:05:02,851 --> 01:05:06,930
have adopt that responsibility and and 
hate speech.

1113
01:05:06,931 --> 01:05:10,410
It's like,
let's say I was interviewed a while back

1114
01:05:10,411 --> 01:05:12,690
and the journalist asked me,
well,

1115
01:05:12,691 --> 01:05:16,350
why should your right to a fan trump 
someone's right to be secure?

1116
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:17,980
It's like,
okay,

1117
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:22,300
well let's say I'm talking to one person
and you might say,

1118
01:05:22,301 --> 01:05:23,890
well,
I don't have the right to offend them.

1119
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:24,753
It's like,
all right,

1120
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:25,923
what if I'm talking to 10 people?
Do I have the right to offend one of 

1121
01:05:28,961 --> 01:05:31,840
those people when I speak to the board,
if it's a thousand people,

1122
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:33,550
what you're saying,

1123
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:46,523
you can't,
you can't have a conversation about 

1124
01:05:48,631 --> 01:05:49,464
something serious without offense.
Like if I'm thinking about something 

1125
01:05:53,101 --> 01:05:55,650
serious,
like I often myself,

1126
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,140
you know,
I know it's seriously mean that I really

1127
01:05:58,141 --> 01:05:58,974
mean that.
So like if I'm laying out a set of 

1128
01:06:00,661 --> 01:06:02,130
hypotheses,
for example,

1129
01:06:02,131 --> 01:06:04,890
about a complex social,
a social problem,

1130
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,980
I might lay out 20 hypothesis and maybe 
two of them.

1131
01:06:07,981 --> 01:06:08,880
I think,
God,

1132
01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:11,850
I hope that's not true,
but like maybe it is true.

1133
01:06:11,851 --> 01:06:12,684
You know,
sometimes you discover things as a 

1134
01:06:14,041 --> 01:06:14,874
social scientist that you wish weren't 
true and those are usually the things 

1135
01:06:17,371 --> 01:06:19,350
that you've discovered that are actually
true,

1136
01:06:19,351 --> 01:06:21,150
right?
Because they violate your assumptions.

1137
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:26,480
So you can't even think if you're not 
willing to offend yourself.

1138
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:27,893
That's what thinking does.
If you're ever talking about something 

1139
01:06:30,061 --> 01:06:30,894
wouldn't be serious if it didn't have 
the possibility of frightening and 

1140
01:06:33,901 --> 01:06:35,720
offending people.
That's kind of how the,

1141
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:38,280
that's Kinda like the definition of 
seriousness.

1142
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:38,791
It's like,
well,

1143
01:06:38,791 --> 01:06:42,630
we can only talk about things that no 
one ever gets upset about.

1144
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:43,753
It's like,
well,

1145
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:45,750
okay,

1146
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:48,210
then it's like you're trapped in an 
elevator for,

1147
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:51,780
for the rest of infinity listening to 
nothing but music.

1148
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:53,553
You're,
that's an,

1149
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:56,430
that's a kind of hell man.
If you're going to think,

1150
01:06:56,490 --> 01:06:58,800
and also if you're going to speak,
you're going to,

1151
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,113
you're going to offend people.
You're going to go after their deepest 

1152
01:07:02,221 --> 01:07:04,500
presuppositions and end your own as 
well.

1153
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:07,530
You're going to shatter them at times.
It's going to be brutal.

1154
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:08,453
Absolutely brutal.
And you all know that because every 

1155
01:07:10,501 --> 01:07:11,334
single one of you has had a serious 
conversation with someone that you love 

1156
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:18,660
and the probability that that was an 
easy conversation and that either of you

1157
01:07:18,661 --> 01:07:21,810
escaped without offense and terror is 
zero.

1158
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,910
If you haven't had a conversation like 
that,

1159
01:07:23,911 --> 01:07:25,040
well,
well

1160
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:29,540
you're not human,
right?

1161
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,130
I mean,
right.

1162
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:33,770
Cause everyone has conversations like 
that all the time,

1163
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:34,633
except when they run from them,
which is most of the time and no bloody 

1164
01:07:38,391 --> 01:07:39,860
wonder,
you know,

1165
01:07:39,861 --> 01:07:40,694
real conversations or there's nothing 
worse than a real conversation except 

1166
01:07:44,451 --> 01:07:47,330
the war that you have if you don't have 
the conversation.

1167
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:50,410
That's basically how it goes.
I just want to underline,

1168
01:07:56,450 --> 01:07:59,270
I just want to underline Jordan's first 
point,

1169
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:04,100
which is really that it's a very 
dangerous thing.

1170
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Any legal rule that relies on some kind 
of reasonableness because reasonableness

1171
01:08:11,181 --> 01:08:14,060
lives in the eyes of the beholder.
I mean,

1172
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:19,570
those out there think that you guys are 
uttering hate speech.

1173
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:25,150
They think that you guys should be the 
one who are arrested and just imagine if

1174
01:08:25,191 --> 01:08:28,820
they were the ones who had the reins of 
government power.

1175
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:31,320
Just all very well.
Thank you.

1176
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:32,183
Both hate speech is a reasonable idea,
but as soon as you give up the control 

1177
01:08:35,691 --> 01:08:39,680
about what that means,
you're liable to run into real trouble.

1178
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:43,390
Yep.
A little monster.

1179
01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:44,371
Whoa.
Whoa.

1180
01:08:44,371 --> 01:08:46,890
Mr. Peterson.
My name is Zachary Milligan.

1181
01:08:47,550 --> 01:08:48,420
Uh,
first off,

1182
01:08:48,421 --> 01:08:49,254
I'd just like to start by actually thank
you for all the hardship and troubles 

1183
01:08:52,981 --> 01:08:57,510
even dirt for standing up for our rights
and being a part of this debate.

1184
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:59,393
Um,
I come from a dairy farm and math need 

1185
01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:02,843
rural res conservatively.
And my question is in the face of when 

1186
01:09:06,391 --> 01:09:08,910
we have a social situation,
so divisive,

1187
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:12,450
when you genuinely believe what you're 
doing is the right thing.

1188
01:09:12,510 --> 01:09:15,360
In this particular instance,
since you have experience with it,

1189
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:19,320
what would you say?
Is there a more effective,

1190
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:21,960
I don't want to say an easy way to reach
out for them.

1191
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:23,213
What do you think's the best way to try 
and talk some sense into those folks 

1192
01:09:25,951 --> 01:09:27,660
outside and the one on one setting?

1193
01:09:28,150 --> 01:09:31,310
So the first thing is is I don't 
necessarily the date,

1194
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:32,793
I don't necessarily think that what I'm 
doing is the right thing because you 

1195
01:09:36,071 --> 01:09:36,904
know,
you have to be careful when you make a 

1196
01:09:37,931 --> 01:09:40,180
claim like that.
But I can tell you one thing,

1197
01:09:40,750 --> 01:09:41,583
I'm not going to let anyone stand in the
way of me trying to figure out what the 

1198
01:09:45,761 --> 01:09:48,250
right thing is.
That's the thing.

1199
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:55,330
[inaudible]

1200
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:57,893
and then I would say we're doing exactly
what we should be doing right now in 

1201
01:10:02,131 --> 01:10:04,560
this discussion.
It's just exactly right,

1202
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:05,933
right?
I mean,

1203
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,810
admittedly we have to talk over the 
noise,

1204
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:10,673
but that's really not that big a 
catastrophe and everybody's in here is 

1205
01:10:14,130 --> 01:10:16,080
comporting themselves in a reasonable 
manner.

1206
01:10:16,081 --> 01:10:19,380
And we're trying to struggle our way 
through the topics and we're,

1207
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:20,393
we're asking questions and we're,
we're trying to have a genuine dialogue 

1208
01:10:22,831 --> 01:10:24,930
about them.
And that's what we've got.

1209
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,810
We've got,
we've got three things.

1210
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:32,670
We've got negotiation,
we've got slavery,

1211
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:36,210
and we've got tyranny.
And those are your choices.

1212
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,850
And so this is negotiation,
right?

1213
01:10:38,851 --> 01:10:39,684
That's public discourse.
And the reason that freedom of speech 

1214
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,790
thought is obviously important.
Everyone can understand that.

1215
01:10:44,791 --> 01:10:45,331
You might say,
well,

1216
01:10:45,331 --> 01:10:46,164
you don't need to speak freely because 
you can think who's going to get inside 

1217
01:10:48,961 --> 01:10:51,630
your head.
But the problem with that is that that's

1218
01:10:51,631 --> 01:10:52,464
not it.

1219
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:56,460
You can't think very well because there 
you are and your little world,

1220
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:58,950
you know,
with all your biases and your ignorance,

1221
01:10:59,010 --> 01:10:59,843
you're wrong about so many things and 
you're going to learn it really 

1222
01:11:01,861 --> 01:11:03,030
painfully.
And,

1223
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:04,073
and then maybe you can trot out some of 
the things you think erroneously and 

1224
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:08,033
ignorantly and other people will give 
you a tap on the side of the head 

1225
01:11:10,291 --> 01:11:12,540
instead of running you over with a 
freight train,

1226
01:11:12,541 --> 01:11:13,374
right?
They'll give you a little tap on the 

1227
01:11:14,221 --> 01:11:16,560
side of the head and maybe you'll walk 
away a little smarter.

1228
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,640
And that's why freedom of speech is so 
important is because a lot of thinking,

1229
01:11:20,670 --> 01:11:24,240
especially about things that are beyond 
you for whatever reason,

1230
01:11:24,241 --> 01:11:25,074
have to take place publicly as we 
stumble around towards an adequate 

1231
01:11:28,711 --> 01:11:31,140
formulation of the problems that beset 
us.

1232
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:34,860
So I would say,
well in this book I wrote,

1233
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:35,850
I have a rule.

1234
01:11:36,220 --> 01:11:37,053
It's,
I think it's rule eight which is tell 

1235
01:11:38,851 --> 01:11:41,670
the truth or at least don't lie.
I would say,

1236
01:11:41,671 --> 01:11:43,410
well,
that's another reasonable,

1237
01:11:44,270 --> 01:11:45,103
reasonable way to start approaching the 
situation is it's not so easy to tell 

1238
01:11:48,451 --> 01:11:50,310
the truth because like,
what do you know?

1239
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:52,200
You know,
you can't come out and say,

1240
01:11:52,201 --> 01:11:53,100
well,
here's the truth,

1241
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:54,113
but I know what one thing you can do,
which is when you know that what you're 

1242
01:11:57,181 --> 01:11:58,014
saying is a lie by your own standards,
you can not say it and you can have a 

1243
01:12:02,281 --> 01:12:03,114
consultation with yourself and you can 
try to learn to say those things that 

1244
01:12:06,601 --> 01:12:09,540
make you strong.
Instead of saying those things that make

1245
01:12:09,541 --> 01:12:10,374
you weak and you,
you contribute to the health of the 

1246
01:12:13,261 --> 01:12:16,590
public dialogue in an incalculable 
manner that way.

1247
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:17,513
And this is another issue that pertains 
to the dignity and importance of the 

1248
01:12:20,521 --> 01:12:21,270
individual.

1249
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:25,080
How you conduct yourself in your life is
way more important than you think.

1250
01:12:25,930 --> 01:12:26,321
And,
and I,

1251
01:12:26,321 --> 01:12:27,154
I mean,
I think that that's a daunting idea 

1252
01:12:28,531 --> 01:12:29,520
because,
you know,

1253
01:12:29,521 --> 01:12:31,990
let's say you're nihilistic and life is 
meaningless.

1254
01:12:31,991 --> 01:12:32,281
It's,
well,

1255
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:35,440
what's the payoff for that?
I think while there's no payoff,

1256
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:35,941
it's like,
well,

1257
01:12:35,941 --> 01:12:36,601
yeah,
there is,

1258
01:12:36,601 --> 01:12:39,870
you have no responsibility.
That's a pretty decent pay off.

1259
01:12:39,871 --> 01:12:40,704
I mean,
you have to pay the price of 

1260
01:12:41,131 --> 01:12:43,590
meaninglessness,
but it doesn't matter what you do.

1261
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,200
Well,
we'll flip that over and said,

1262
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:46,050
no,
no,

1263
01:12:46,110 --> 01:12:48,000
sorry,
you're wrong.

1264
01:12:48,210 --> 01:12:51,240
Your life is meaningful.
It's way more meaningful than you think,

1265
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:55,200
but you have to bear responsibility for 
your thoughts and your actions.

1266
01:12:55,890 --> 01:12:56,723
It's like you'll,
there'll be plenty of meaning and not 

1267
01:12:57,901 --> 01:13:00,210
well that if you understand that 
property,

1268
01:13:00,211 --> 01:13:01,044
that will,
that will cleave you to the depths of 

1269
01:13:03,151 --> 01:13:03,984
your soul and maybe you learn to speak 
carefully and to act carefully and that 

1270
01:13:07,621 --> 01:13:11,580
will have a beneficial effect on 
everyone around you if far more.

1271
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:15,610
You're far more powerful in the place 
you stand in the place you sit and stand

1272
01:13:15,611 --> 01:13:16,444
than you think.
And I think everyone has an intimation 

1273
01:13:18,211 --> 01:13:20,400
of that.
And if you don't think that's true,

1274
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:24,360
then try treating people around you as 
if it's not true.

1275
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:25,673
Tried treating people that you know in 
your life as if they don't matter and 

1276
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:29,904
just see what kind of response you get.
People are not going to be happy with 

1277
01:13:33,271 --> 01:13:35,010
you,
not in any sense whatsoever.

1278
01:13:35,011 --> 01:13:37,170
You'll,
you'll ruin all your relationships.

1279
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:39,480
You have to treat people as if they 
matter.

1280
01:13:39,660 --> 01:13:43,380
And maybe you have to treat them as if 
they matter because maybe they do.

1281
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:47,380
And that goes for you too.
And so if you matter,

1282
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:50,400
then you should act like you matter.
And that's a very,

1283
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:53,910
that's a very daunting proposition,
that's for sure.

1284
01:13:54,090 --> 01:13:55,440
Okay.
As a foot,

1285
01:13:55,441 --> 01:13:56,780
go ahead.
As a

1286
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:02,090
[inaudible],

1287
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:08,010
it's just a footnote to that.
Let's just observe this in legal terms.

1288
01:14:08,730 --> 01:14:12,340
There are only two categories of 
actions,

1289
01:14:12,970 --> 01:14:17,140
voluntary and involuntary.
Don't let anybody tell you otherwise,

1290
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,053
either you're choosing,
you're on your own and handling the 

1291
01:14:21,131 --> 01:14:24,010
consequences or the government is 
telling you what to do.

1292
01:14:24,670 --> 01:14:26,110
Those are the only two possibilities.

1293
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:28,543
Thank you,
sir.

1294
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:36,093
At the back of my head.

1295
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:38,190
Oh Duh.
Hello,

1296
01:14:38,191 --> 01:14:39,024
Dr. Peterson.
I would like to recall the part in your 

1297
01:14:41,851 --> 01:14:46,851
conversation in which you mentioned how 
the radical left switched from the 1960s

1298
01:14:48,421 --> 01:14:53,421
and seventies to being back when they 
were a pro free speech and their recent,

1299
01:14:55,170 --> 01:14:56,730
um,
opposition to it.

1300
01:14:58,020 --> 01:14:58,853
I know,
I know that you often mentioned their 

1301
01:15:00,901 --> 01:15:03,210
obsession with power,
at least among them.

1302
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:04,890
Um,
yes.

1303
01:15:05,190 --> 01:15:06,023
Uh,
at least among their more marxists 

1304
01:15:07,111 --> 01:15:09,790
types.
I was one no undoing.

1305
01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:10,643
If perhaps they think that now that now 
is the opportunity where they can 

1306
01:15:14,401 --> 01:15:15,234
consolidate their power and if they do 
so successfully that it will become the 

1307
01:15:19,501 --> 01:15:23,010
mortality of our civilization for the 
next thousand years.

1308
01:15:23,011 --> 01:15:25,470
Like Christianity was when Rome adopted 
it.

1309
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:31,550
Is that from what you've seen,
would you say that that's about it,

1310
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:36,300
that that's close to the way there 
that's close to their strategy?

1311
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:39,933
Well,
it's hard to exactly understand the 

1312
01:15:42,311 --> 01:15:45,250
strategy of an ideology,
you know,

1313
01:15:45,251 --> 01:15:48,850
because all the people who were outside 
were,

1314
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:52,330
were united in some sense under the 
umbrella of an idea.

1315
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:56,340
And on an idea is a living thing.
I mean it's,

1316
01:15:56,341 --> 01:15:57,174
it's embedded in living tissue and it's 
distributed in the fragmentary manner 

1317
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:02,710
across the mob,
let's say.

1318
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:04,083
And each person in the mob always only 
only possess is a fragment of the 

1319
01:16:09,131 --> 01:16:09,964
ideology because the full neo Marxist,
let's say the full neo Marxist 

1320
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:16,700
postmodernist doctrine is quite complex.
And,

1321
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:19,360
and,
but when you get them all up together,

1322
01:16:19,361 --> 01:16:22,300
then it acts under the dictate of the 
ideology.

1323
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:24,370
And the question then is,
well,

1324
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:27,220
what does the ideology want?
And I would say,

1325
01:16:27,221 --> 01:16:28,054
well,
it wants what it's formulators says it 

1326
01:16:29,861 --> 01:16:31,780
wants.
And D Derrida,

1327
01:16:31,781 --> 01:16:32,614
for example,
who's head trickster of the 

1328
01:16:33,701 --> 01:16:38,650
postmodernists regarded the western 
society as fellow go centric,

1329
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:41,290
right?
And North that meant was male dominant,

1330
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:44,170
male dominated.
That's the fellow tell us part.

1331
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:47,380
And then logo centric.
While that refers to the word logos,

1332
01:16:47,381 --> 01:16:50,110
which means it's the root word of logic,
but there's also the,

1333
01:16:50,590 --> 01:16:53,410
it's also the,
the person of Christ,

1334
01:16:53,411 --> 01:16:54,244
essentially the logos.
And so the purpose of the postmodern 

1335
01:16:58,121 --> 01:17:02,140
critique was to demolish that wealth.
Fair enough.

1336
01:17:02,141 --> 01:17:04,600
My sense with people is,
especially if they're,

1337
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:05,493
if they've written things down and 
thought them through that they're 

1338
01:17:08,111 --> 01:17:10,250
actually aiming what they say

1339
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:12,350
they're aiming for.
Well,

1340
01:17:12,351 --> 01:17:13,184
if you,
if you buy the idea that the west is a 

1341
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,420
male dominated tyranny,
essentially a patriarchal tyranny,

1342
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:23,330
and that your moral duty is to tear it 
down,

1343
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:27,110
well then that's what you're doing.
And then you might say,

1344
01:17:27,111 --> 01:17:27,944
well,
what's going to,

1345
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:30,410
what is going to be erected on its 
ashes?

1346
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:32,870
Well,
that's where things get complicated.

1347
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:36,020
You know,
the first question might be,

1348
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:39,110
are the people who wish to tear it down 
builders,

1349
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:39,953
or are they just destroyers?
And my strong sentiment is that they're 

1350
01:17:43,581 --> 01:17:45,230
primarily destroyers.

1351
01:17:46,140 --> 01:17:46,740
Okay.

1352
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:47,580
Now you might say,
well,

1353
01:17:47,581 --> 01:17:50,250
why do people wish to destroy?
Well,

1354
01:17:50,251 --> 01:17:52,770
it's because they're hurt by life and 
they're resentful.

1355
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:54,300
Okay.

1356
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:58,350
And resentful.
People become vengeful and vengeful.

1357
01:17:58,351 --> 01:18:02,610
People become dangerous.
And there's no shortage of motivation to

1358
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:03,810
make things worse.

1359
01:18:04,850 --> 01:18:05,190
Okay?

1360
01:18:05,190 --> 01:18:07,440
No,
the school shooters make things worse.

1361
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:11,100
People make things worse.
Now,

1362
01:18:11,101 --> 01:18:11,934
you know,
maybe lurking in the rhetoric is this 

1363
01:18:13,081 --> 01:18:13,914
appeal to an egalitarian utopia.
But we've tried you galitary Utopia's 

1364
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:20,693
already we sacrificed 100 million people
to he galitary and utopias and we have 

1365
01:18:26,311 --> 01:18:27,144
yet to produce one.
And so my sense is the corpses stacked 

1366
01:18:30,751 --> 01:18:33,000
up high enough to constitute proof.

1367
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:35,493
So

1368
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,153
it's destruction mostly that motivates 
it as far as I can tell masquerading as 

1369
01:18:40,641 --> 01:18:41,474
compassion.

1370
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:48,490
Nice.
[inaudible]

1371
01:18:53,290 --> 01:18:54,910
thank you for that question.
Next place.

1372
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:58,570
Dr. Peterson was the party.
Thank you both for being here today.

1373
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:00,103
Um,
I'm a political scientist and what I've 

1374
01:19:01,691 --> 01:19:03,600
studied is totalitarian regimes.
I'm sorry,

1375
01:19:03,601 --> 01:19:04,990
I'm gonna move this a little bit.
Just feel weird.

1376
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:06,910
Totalitarian regimes.
I've studied,

1377
01:19:06,911 --> 01:19:10,530
I've tried to look at the Iranian 
revolution and the Islamic Republican,

1378
01:19:10,580 --> 01:19:11,413
Iran,
and I've argued how the Shia Islam that 

1379
01:19:13,481 --> 01:19:17,050
is teached in Islamic public is very 
close to a totalitarian regime.

1380
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:21,220
But now I live in a country where my 
ideas are considered controversial.

1381
01:19:21,730 --> 01:19:24,220
If you believe in God,
if you believe in family,

1382
01:19:24,430 --> 01:19:27,250
if you believe in having responsibility 
and traditional values,

1383
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:28,293
I feel ostracized by the community here.
I came from UC University of Calgary 

1384
01:19:31,601 --> 01:19:32,770
over there.
I didn't feel this way.

1385
01:19:32,980 --> 01:19:33,813
There was more welcoming.
Here I feel marginalized and I do feel 

1386
01:19:36,701 --> 01:19:38,440
alone.
And when I see this,

1387
01:19:38,441 --> 01:19:40,540
it disgusts me that here they can do 
this.

1388
01:19:40,570 --> 01:19:42,550
But I couldn't go to their events and do
anything.

1389
01:19:42,910 --> 01:19:43,743
I'd have to shut up,
there'd be a disciplinary committee for 

1390
01:19:44,951 --> 01:19:45,784
me.
But for them they can break windows to 

1391
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:50,350
God knows how old this building is.
And it's okay for them to do that.

1392
01:19:50,650 --> 01:19:53,920
So my question to you is now being sheer
experiencing this,

1393
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:55,323
I'm starting to second guess that maybe 
the totalitarian Islamic regime that I 

1394
01:19:58,541 --> 01:19:59,550
was so,
you know,

1395
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:00,453
talking about I'm critical of back in 
Iran isn't so bad when I have a choice 

1396
01:20:03,851 --> 01:20:04,684
between having to be here and you press 
and be there and least have my ideas be 

1397
01:20:08,131 --> 01:20:08,964
okay with blue regime.
So my argument is if this free speech 

1398
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:14,820
and the arguments you guys are making 
here,

1399
01:20:14,990 --> 01:20:15,823
it doesn't work,
would that not be the next step for 

1400
01:20:17,701 --> 01:20:18,534
people to go towards totalitarianism?
If dialogue fails and isn't force of 

1401
01:20:21,781 --> 01:20:22,614
arms the only thing left?
How can people compromise when they 

1402
01:20:24,781 --> 01:20:26,640
don't want to talk,
when they want to yell?

1403
01:20:27,810 --> 01:20:28,643
Thank you.

1404
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:41,500
I think you make it very good point.
I don't think we should fool ourselves.

1405
01:20:42,010 --> 01:20:42,843
This is about force and it is a,
it's almost a dare to suggest that that 

1406
01:20:51,310 --> 01:20:56,310
certain elements are not allowed to 
enforce their view of the world and that

1407
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:57,993
speaking contrary to it,
isn't that a front to those values and 

1408
01:21:00,821 --> 01:21:02,180
they won't shut you down.
I mean that,

1409
01:21:02,181 --> 01:21:03,880
that,
that is what is at stake.

1410
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:04,490
We,
we,

1411
01:21:04,490 --> 01:21:05,770
we are,
we are,

1412
01:21:05,830 --> 01:21:06,663
we are no longer really in a situation 
where this will all be resolved through 

1413
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:16,510
sort of gentle,
reasonable civil dialogue that,

1414
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:20,230
that happens on the side.
But it's not real anymore.

1415
01:21:20,231 --> 01:21:21,910
It's not really where the fight is 
happening.

1416
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:23,043
This is a,
an imposition of the force of the state 

1417
01:21:25,810 --> 01:21:26,643
and it is skewed.
It is skewed a certain way and we are 

1418
01:21:28,931 --> 01:21:32,860
getting to the point where a certain 
kind of language occur,

1419
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:33,763
certain kind of dialogue is,
is approved and all right and a certain 

1420
01:21:36,761 --> 01:21:37,594
kind of is not.
And that is the campaign that is going 

1421
01:21:39,461 --> 01:21:43,960
on that this is all part of.
And I have to say that,

1422
01:21:43,961 --> 01:21:44,794
that your presence here and,
and your endorsement of this kind of 

1423
01:21:48,131 --> 01:21:53,131
event is the kind of thing that has the 
major pushback to that trend,

1424
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:57,550
but the trend is continuing.
And is it very dangerous one.

1425
01:21:58,120 --> 01:21:59,920
And uh,
this is,

1426
01:21:59,921 --> 01:22:00,754
uh,
a difficult moment in the life of this 

1427
01:22:03,611 --> 01:22:04,444
country.
Would you,

1428
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:05,313
would you say

1429
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:07,020
Jordan Peele?
So,

1430
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:09,200
so some,
some comments about,

1431
01:22:09,230 --> 01:22:10,610
about your career,
let's say.

1432
01:22:10,611 --> 01:22:11,444
Okay.
So you're a young mountain and you've 

1433
01:22:12,261 --> 01:22:13,094
got lots of years ahead of you.
So you know you want to prepare for the 

1434
01:22:15,591 --> 01:22:17,900
war and not for the battle.
Right.

1435
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:19,303
Okay.
Cause there's going to be many battles 

1436
01:22:20,301 --> 01:22:23,090
for you personally and perhaps 
politically and all of that.

1437
01:22:23,091 --> 01:22:23,924
And so you want to make yourself as 
articulate and educated as you can and 

1438
01:22:26,451 --> 01:22:27,284
you want to have patients.
I would say that there's no cause for 

1439
01:22:29,601 --> 01:22:31,610
despair.
You know,

1440
01:22:31,611 --> 01:22:32,750
I believe that the,
the,

1441
01:22:32,890 --> 01:22:33,723
the people who are attempting to 
radicalize our society and to transform 

1442
01:22:36,831 --> 01:22:40,580
it into a battleground of identity 
politics are in a distinct minority.

1443
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:45,140
And I think that,
I think that there's no reason to assume

1444
01:22:45,141 --> 01:22:47,120
that we can't push the devil back into 
the,

1445
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:49,130
into the bottle,
so to speak,

1446
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:51,170
to push the genie back into the bottle.

1447
01:22:51,650 --> 01:22:55,700
And so don't despair.
Now from a personal perspective,

1448
01:22:55,701 --> 01:22:56,534
it's like we've got lots of things to 
learn and you've got lots of things to 

1449
01:22:59,571 --> 01:23:00,404
say and to write and you're going to 
find now and then that you were imposed 

1450
01:23:03,711 --> 01:23:06,160
upon in a manner that you don't 
tolerable.

1451
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:06,941
Right.
You think,

1452
01:23:06,941 --> 01:23:08,320
I can't live like this,
right?

1453
01:23:08,321 --> 01:23:10,390
It's going to distress you when,
well then,

1454
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:13,090
then you've come across your moral 
conundrum,

1455
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:14,403
right?
It's specific to you and then you have 

1456
01:23:16,031 --> 01:23:16,864
to,
that's when you have to grow up and 

1457
01:23:18,971 --> 01:23:19,804
think strategically.
It's like you decide are you willing to 

1458
01:23:22,751 --> 01:23:25,120
live under those conditions?
If you're not,

1459
01:23:25,150 --> 01:23:27,850
then you develop a strategy.
It's like,

1460
01:23:27,851 --> 01:23:29,230
okay,
I'm going to,

1461
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:34,120
I'm going to fight this.
I'm going to fight it carefully,

1462
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:35,373
intelligently,
thoughtfully on multiple fronts and I'm 

1463
01:23:38,981 --> 01:23:42,280
not going to back down like you don't 
make that decision lightly.

1464
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:43,143
You know most things you should let blow
by you because there's not that much of 

1465
01:23:46,541 --> 01:23:49,990
you and there's lots of things,
but now and then you'll find a stumbling

1466
01:23:49,991 --> 01:23:52,360
block that you can't get over it because
it hurts you.

1467
01:23:52,970 --> 01:23:55,900
It damages your soul.
That's the right way to think about it.

1468
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:59,530
Well then that's the time for you to put
your education to use.

1469
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:01,480
No,
and you'll be able to do that.

1470
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:02,343
I mean,
you don't want to underestimate the 

1471
01:24:03,521 --> 01:24:07,300
utility of of deep,
forthright speech.

1472
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:10,150
I don't believe that anything can stand 
in its way.

1473
01:24:10,330 --> 01:24:12,010
You have the courage of your 
convictions,

1474
01:24:12,011 --> 01:24:16,660
but don't give way to despair.
Like this battle is by no means over.

1475
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:20,740
Well no I know meets and it isn't even 
obvious that the bad guys are winning so

1476
01:24:20,741 --> 01:24:22,210
to speak.
You know,

1477
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:23,980
I mean here we are.
Yes,

1478
01:24:24,070 --> 01:24:24,903
we're having this talk.
The university came out forthrightly in 

1479
01:24:27,881 --> 01:24:30,640
favor of free speech.
Hooray for that

1480
01:24:30,710 --> 01:24:35,710
[inaudible]

1481
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:46,953
no one and so far all the questions 
today have been thoughtful and 

1482
01:24:49,961 --> 01:24:52,330
intelligent.
You seem like informed people.

1483
01:24:52,570 --> 01:24:54,700
It's like don't underestimate your 
strength.

1484
01:24:55,210 --> 01:24:56,043
And so,
and mcmaster just published a set of 

1485
01:24:58,331 --> 01:24:59,164
guidelines governing this sort of 
behavior so that will no longer be 

1486
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:04,203
acceptable to disrupt perfectly 
reasonable proceedings on university 

1487
01:25:08,111 --> 01:25:12,700
campuses.
And so that,

1488
01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:15,280
so the discussions like this can 
continue properly.

1489
01:25:15,490 --> 01:25:16,323
I mean there's definitely a place for 
give and take and for informed 

1490
01:25:20,230 --> 01:25:21,520
opposition,
let's say.

1491
01:25:21,820 --> 01:25:22,653
But there's a difference between 
informed opposition and child childish 

1492
01:25:26,021 --> 01:25:26,854
grand standing.
And I think people know the difference 

1493
01:25:28,391 --> 01:25:30,190
between that.
So don't,

1494
01:25:30,370 --> 01:25:33,430
don't be desperate about it.
Why not pick your battles?

1495
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:36,150
Courage goes a long way,
right?

1496
01:25:36,151 --> 01:25:38,560
Because other people see it and there's 
that,

1497
01:25:38,580 --> 01:25:43,580
there is I think a silent majority out 
there that is silent and is scared.

1498
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:51,440
But if they see courage from somebody,
they responded to it.

1499
01:25:51,690 --> 01:25:52,523
Well,
I think you described lawyers in a way 

1500
01:25:54,571 --> 01:25:56,580
that appealed to me once.
He said,

1501
01:25:56,581 --> 01:25:58,380
I think,
I know that's rare,

1502
01:25:58,381 --> 01:26:01,980
but
you said lawyers,

1503
01:26:01,981 --> 01:26:04,520
I think these are the words you said.
Lawyers are

1504
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:05,443
difficult and emotionally stable.
And it was the combination of those two 

1505
01:26:10,101 --> 01:26:10,934
things,
the willingness to be difficult but not 

1506
01:26:12,951 --> 01:26:15,230
to be emotional about it.
So don't,

1507
01:26:15,231 --> 01:26:16,011
don't,
don't,

1508
01:26:16,011 --> 01:26:19,310
where'd your emotions to the fight?
Take a step back,

1509
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:21,500
engage in it.
Say what you think.

1510
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:24,170
Be Courageous,
but don't get wrapped up in it.

1511
01:26:24,470 --> 01:26:26,870
Don't be emotional about it.
But you know,

1512
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:30,350
Rick Chain your strength for the long 
haul.

1513
01:26:30,380 --> 01:26:31,140
Yup.

1514
01:26:31,140 --> 01:26:31,871
Well,
and you know,

1515
01:26:31,871 --> 01:26:33,670
one of the things I've learned 
strategically,

1516
01:26:33,671 --> 01:26:35,380
and this is really worth thinking about 
too,

1517
01:26:35,381 --> 01:26:39,670
is that when you're engaged in a public 
dispute like this,

1518
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:42,400
it's not obvious when things are going 
your way.

1519
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:44,201
You know,
you think,

1520
01:26:44,201 --> 01:26:46,270
well,
this protest is not such a good thing.

1521
01:26:46,271 --> 01:26:48,640
It's like,
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

1522
01:26:49,290 --> 01:26:50,123
You know what's happened to me in the 
last 18 months is that virtually every 

1523
01:26:53,561 --> 01:26:56,770
time that I been attacked and some of 
the attacks had been quite,

1524
01:26:57,310 --> 01:27:00,370
well I wouldn't say brutal because we 
haven't got to that thank God,

1525
01:27:00,610 --> 01:27:05,610
but they've certainly been um,
they've taken me aback.

1526
01:27:05,650 --> 01:27:06,483
You know,
it's not,

1527
01:27:06,970 --> 01:27:09,430
it's not a straight forward thing to be 
in a hall with.

1528
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:10,313
And this happened at mcmaster with a 
hundred people yelling at you and Larry 

1529
01:27:14,321 --> 01:27:19,321
near horns and all of that.
But that wasn't a bad thing as it turned

1530
01:27:19,481 --> 01:27:20,314
out because it was filmed and it was put
on Youtube and it was terrible for the 

1531
01:27:25,001 --> 01:27:27,520
people who protested,
you know,

1532
01:27:27,550 --> 01:27:28,690
it wasn't good.

1533
01:27:28,930 --> 01:27:32,290
And so you got to detach yourself to,
you know,

1534
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:33,173
if,
if you say what you think and you're 

1535
01:27:33,881 --> 01:27:34,714
careful about it,
it's going to have some short term 

1536
01:27:36,221 --> 01:27:38,490
effects and it's going to have some 
medium term effects exit.

1537
01:27:38,500 --> 01:27:39,940
It's going to have some long term 
effects.

1538
01:27:39,941 --> 01:27:42,160
And one of the things that you need to 
do,

1539
01:27:42,161 --> 01:27:44,050
I would say,
and this is an element of courage,

1540
01:27:44,051 --> 01:27:44,884
is you have to have faith that the 
medium to longterm consequences of you 

1541
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:52,270
saying what you have to say as clearly 
as possible.

1542
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:56,440
It's going to be positive and you have 
to act on that supposition.

1543
01:27:56,650 --> 01:27:57,700
You don't know,
right?

1544
01:27:57,730 --> 01:28:02,110
You can't know that that's the 
existential leap of faith is you.

1545
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:04,120
You can't know,
but you act anyway.

1546
01:28:04,810 --> 01:28:08,290
And my experience has been that you 
don't want to,

1547
01:28:08,710 --> 01:28:09,543
you don't want to make judgment too 
quickly because it's not always clear 

1548
01:28:11,621 --> 01:28:14,560
when things are going your way.
So when you know,

1549
01:28:14,710 --> 01:28:15,543
you might stand up into class and say 
something that people react negatively 

1550
01:28:18,191 --> 01:28:20,650
to eat and you might get pilloried for 
that by some people,

1551
01:28:20,651 --> 01:28:21,484
but you never know who you're touching 
in the crowd and you don't know how 

1552
01:28:24,491 --> 01:28:26,780
that's going to unfold across time.
Now you,

1553
01:28:26,830 --> 01:28:27,663
that might be a defining moment in 
someone else's life to watch you stand 

1554
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:30,904
up and say what you have to say.
So don't underestimate the power of 

1555
01:28:34,991 --> 01:28:37,640
truth and courage really.
So

1556
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:43,380
thank you.
[inaudible]

1557
01:28:46,430 --> 01:28:48,350
honestly,
they should be thankful.

1558
01:28:48,351 --> 01:28:51,080
And how civil and how peaceful you guys 
are.

1559
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:52,790
They should be thankful.
They shouldn't be angry.

1560
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:02,040
I regret to say we probably have time 
for probably

1561
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:05,880
just a couple of more questions.
So let's go to the back.

1562
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:09,580
Hi.
Um,

1563
01:29:10,620 --> 01:29:13,110
so my question is directed at Dr. 
Peterson.

1564
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:14,273
Um,
I've been watching your lectures online 

1565
01:29:17,401 --> 01:29:20,540
for a while and um,
you talk a lot,

1566
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:21,953
come a little closer to the mic.
You speak a lot about that's better as 

1567
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:30,240
you speak a lot about character arc 
types and a narrative and the importance

1568
01:29:30,241 --> 01:29:35,241
of the young Ian idea of the
personal narrative.

1569
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:40,380
Um,
I

1570
01:29:42,070 --> 01:29:44,520
am having trouble formulating this into 
a question,

1571
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:49,320
but I guess with the idea of archetypes 
in mind,

1572
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:51,840
um,
are you familiar with,

1573
01:29:51,870 --> 01:29:52,431
uh,
Ben,

1574
01:29:52,431 --> 01:29:55,590
we Mandel broads idea of fractal 
patterns?

1575
01:29:56,620 --> 01:29:58,080
Um,
and if so,

1576
01:29:58,081 --> 01:29:58,914
what do you think and if,
is there a connection there maybe to be 

1577
01:30:01,021 --> 01:30:01,854
found?

1578
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:04,233
Well,
there seems to be a metaphorical 

1579
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:09,460
connection in that the,
the great is,

1580
01:30:09,670 --> 01:30:10,503
is reproduced in the small,
and that's certainly an idea that 

1581
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:14,913
permeates,
let's say religious and theological 

1582
01:30:17,351 --> 01:30:19,090
speculation.
You know,

1583
01:30:19,091 --> 01:30:24,091
there's an idea that here's an idea that
it's like the idea of the genie,

1584
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:30,180
which is the same root word as genius.
You know,

1585
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:34,690
the genie is something of unimaginable 
power that's constrained in a very small

1586
01:30:34,691 --> 01:30:35,524
space.
And that's kind of what a person is 

1587
01:30:37,301 --> 01:30:39,220
like.
You know,

1588
01:30:39,310 --> 01:30:43,750
we have this affinity,
we have this connection to the infinite,

1589
01:30:44,020 --> 01:30:46,960
we have this connection to the divine 
but work,

1590
01:30:46,990 --> 01:30:49,530
but it's constrained within within our 
frames,

1591
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:50,373
right?
And we have to act out that the divine 

1592
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:56,080
narrative in the confines of our own 
life.

1593
01:30:56,440 --> 01:30:58,420
And so there is this overarching 
reality,

1594
01:30:58,421 --> 01:30:59,254
which is something like the fo the 
forthright confrontation with the 

1595
01:31:03,341 --> 01:31:04,990
catastrophe of life,
right?

1596
01:31:05,380 --> 01:31:07,420
And,
but that has to be made personal,

1597
01:31:07,450 --> 01:31:08,221
you know,
so that,

1598
01:31:08,221 --> 01:31:11,980
that's one of the things I would say 
deepest ideas is that the archetipal has

1599
01:31:11,981 --> 01:31:14,110
to be be made personally in your own 
life.

1600
01:31:14,350 --> 01:31:17,980
And so you take the generic pattern and 
you personalize it,

1601
01:31:17,981 --> 01:31:20,410
and then the infinite and the finite 
meat.

1602
01:31:20,470 --> 01:31:24,190
And that's the perfect combination.
And there's something about that that's,

1603
01:31:24,730 --> 01:31:27,860
well unalterably profiled I would say.
And,

1604
01:31:27,870 --> 01:31:30,970
and,
and as true as anything can be,

1605
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:32,193
and I think people know this at the very
deep level because you do know when 

1606
01:31:36,041 --> 01:31:36,874
you're struggling to go to sleep at 
night and your conscience is bothering 

1607
01:31:38,951 --> 01:31:41,800
you and you think through the things 
that you did in the day,

1608
01:31:41,801 --> 01:31:42,634
in the week,
you'll take solace in the things that 

1609
01:31:43,871 --> 01:31:46,360
you did that were noble and true and 
you,

1610
01:31:46,361 --> 01:31:47,194
and you can,
you can breathe a sigh of relief that 

1611
01:31:49,241 --> 01:31:52,810
you're not completely corrupt and lost 
and then you can sleep.

1612
01:31:53,470 --> 01:31:55,480
It's like everyone knows this.
Well,

1613
01:31:55,481 --> 01:31:57,400
we need to know it consciously,
right?

1614
01:31:57,700 --> 01:32:01,900
And that's part of the process of the 
archetipal personal and that that's part

1615
01:32:01,901 --> 01:32:04,420
of what the religious process is 
supposed to be about,

1616
01:32:04,421 --> 01:32:08,140
is to outline the,
the archetipal pattern and then to say,

1617
01:32:08,141 --> 01:32:09,670
look,
you have to meditate on this.

1618
01:32:09,671 --> 01:32:10,504
And you have to figure out how to make 
it true in the confines of your own 

1619
01:32:13,121 --> 01:32:15,230
life.
And that gives,

1620
01:32:15,370 --> 01:32:18,760
see the reason that works,
I think is because there's no doubt that

1621
01:32:18,761 --> 01:32:19,594
your life is tragic and there's no doubt
that you have a bilevel and element and 

1622
01:32:22,961 --> 01:32:25,840
that you'll be touched by betrayal and 
all those terrible things.

1623
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:30,370
But there's a nobility about youtue.
And that nobility might be sufficient to

1624
01:32:30,371 --> 01:32:31,204
transcend your limitations.
And I would say that your life is a 

1625
01:32:33,941 --> 01:32:36,580
struggle to determine if that might be 
the case.

1626
01:32:36,790 --> 01:32:37,623
And that's the act of faith.
But I also do believe I was asked today 

1627
01:32:40,901 --> 01:32:41,734
by South African journalist if I'm the 
ultimate pessimist are the ultimate 

1628
01:32:45,221 --> 01:32:46,740
optimist.
And No,

1629
01:32:46,741 --> 01:32:49,330
and I would say in some ways I am the 
ultimate pessimist.

1630
01:32:49,331 --> 01:32:54,130
I know I think as much as I can tolerate
how terrible life can be,

1631
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:55,293
but I do believe that the human spirit 
can overcome that catastrophe and can 

1632
01:32:58,451 --> 01:32:59,284
rise out of it.
And I think the universities are that 

1633
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:10,200
that idea expressed in stone and 
tradition and it's a great idea.

1634
01:33:10,301 --> 01:33:13,420
Everyone needs the idea,
especially people who are young,

1635
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:14,254
you know,
your life is it know that your life is 

1636
01:33:15,521 --> 01:33:18,700
going to be difficult.
It's like no one can say,

1637
01:33:18,701 --> 01:33:19,870
well,
it's going to be easy.

1638
01:33:19,871 --> 01:33:20,770
But you might say,
well,

1639
01:33:20,771 --> 01:33:24,070
do you want it to be easy?
What's in it for you?

1640
01:33:24,071 --> 01:33:25,840
If it's easy,
well,

1641
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:26,703
no,
you want it to be difficult and 

1642
01:33:27,581 --> 01:33:31,780
worthwhile and you want to be the sort 
of person that can manage that.

1643
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:32,853
And that's what you should be.
That's what you should be encouraged to 

1644
01:33:35,081 --> 01:33:37,300
be at university.
And,

1645
01:33:37,301 --> 01:33:39,790
and that's what the universities are 
for.

1646
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:42,430
So,
well,

1647
01:33:42,431 --> 01:33:44,680
that's the archetipal and the person who
I would say.

1648
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:46,630
Yeah.
Thank you very much.

1649
01:33:47,130 --> 01:33:52,130
[inaudible]

1650
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:55,880
we'll have to be our last question.
Go ahead,

1651
01:33:55,881 --> 01:33:58,580
sir.
In recent time,

1652
01:33:58,880 --> 01:33:59,713
uh,
I would probably identify the most 

1653
01:34:01,011 --> 01:34:03,590
recent us election as the turning point 
for this.

1654
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:06,080
And that's,
I've seen that as an American citizen,

1655
01:34:06,081 --> 01:34:08,180
this is my first time living in Canada.
Um,

1656
01:34:08,670 --> 01:34:13,640
I've noticed that public discourse has 
taken to elevate fascism as the ultimate

1657
01:34:13,641 --> 01:34:15,650
evil,
and maybe rightfully so.

1658
01:34:15,651 --> 01:34:16,484
You know,
there were many horrific things commit 

1659
01:34:17,370 --> 01:34:20,630
by fascist states in the 20th century,
and you see people,

1660
01:34:20,631 --> 01:34:22,400
you know,
like facebook cover photos,

1661
01:34:22,401 --> 01:34:23,820
like bash the fast,
you see,

1662
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:26,810
let stickers on laptops.
This machine kills fascists.

1663
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:27,801
It is,
you know,

1664
01:34:27,801 --> 01:34:31,730
there's this big backlash against 
fascism and the horrors that it caused,

1665
01:34:32,210 --> 01:34:33,043
but in spite of that,
you don't see the same reaction to the 

1666
01:34:36,141 --> 01:34:40,970
horrors and the genocide that were 
caused by socialist and Communist states

1667
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:41,833
in the 20th century.

1668
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:43,553
Do not.

1669
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:49,313
You see people who virtue signal 
endlessly about how horrible the 

1670
01:34:53,161 --> 01:34:55,830
Holocaust was,
about how awful these things were.

1671
01:34:55,890 --> 01:34:59,240
And then just hand away the famine,
genocide of the Ukraine,

1672
01:34:59,270 --> 01:35:00,103
the great leap forward.
They think these things are 

1673
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:02,413
inconsequential or even necessary 
sacrifices for the rise of the greater 

1674
01:35:06,741 --> 01:35:07,574
good of socialism or communism.
And I personally find that morally 

1675
01:35:11,601 --> 01:35:14,510
reprehensible and I can't understand 
where that,

1676
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:15,613
where that comes in,
how you can stand there and be so 

1677
01:35:17,301 --> 01:35:18,134
opposed to this genocide.
What say that this genocide is somehow 

1678
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:23,091
just,
oh,

1679
01:35:23,091 --> 01:35:25,610
it's not a problem.
And why do you think that?

1680
01:35:25,611 --> 01:35:27,470
How do you think that disconnect 
happens?

1681
01:35:27,471 --> 01:35:28,304
How do you think people can convince 
themselves of that and why do you think 

1682
01:35:31,611 --> 01:35:32,444
that happens?

1683
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:34,310
It's a great,
it's a great question.

1684
01:35:34,940 --> 01:35:36,860
Um,
you know,

1685
01:35:36,950 --> 01:35:38,600
I have,
my house is covered with,

1686
01:35:39,110 --> 01:35:44,110
with art from the Soviet era,
and I have a road of reasons for that.

1687
01:35:44,570 --> 01:35:46,550
Part of it is to remind me of what 
happened.

1688
01:35:46,551 --> 01:35:47,384
Part of it is to watch the struggle 
between the art and the propaganda on 

1689
01:35:50,271 --> 01:35:52,220
the canvasses sort of in real time.
You know,

1690
01:35:52,221 --> 01:35:56,150
I'm very interested in that,
but I would never decorate my house with

1691
01:35:56,151 --> 01:35:58,790
Nazi Regalia,
you know,

1692
01:35:59,780 --> 01:36:00,770
and you think,
well,

1693
01:36:00,771 --> 01:36:02,450
why is that exactly?
It's not like,

1694
01:36:02,451 --> 01:36:03,284
I don't know that that what happened in 
the communist regimes was utterly 

1695
01:36:05,601 --> 01:36:06,860
reprehensible.
Why is it,

1696
01:36:06,890 --> 01:36:09,170
and perhaps it's not acceptable to have,
you know,

1697
01:36:09,171 --> 01:36:11,180
socialist realist paintings in your 
house,

1698
01:36:11,270 --> 01:36:12,103
but it's certainly more acceptable or it
seems that way than to have paintings 

1699
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:16,760
from the Nazi era,
let's say.

1700
01:36:17,330 --> 01:36:18,111
So then you think,
well,

1701
01:36:18,111 --> 01:36:19,340
why is that exactly?

1702
01:36:19,340 --> 01:36:21,890
And I think,
you know,

1703
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:24,830
back in 1918 at the dawn of the Russian 
revolution,

1704
01:36:25,070 --> 01:36:25,903
when Europe was inflamed and in ruins 
and the monarchical societies were 

1705
01:36:28,731 --> 01:36:29,564
collapsing and the industrial revolution
was in full force and there were 

1706
01:36:32,511 --> 01:36:33,344
terrible,
there was terrible poverty and terrible 

1707
01:36:34,731 --> 01:36:38,270
inequality.
The dream of Universal Brotherhood was a

1708
01:36:38,271 --> 01:36:41,400
compelling dream,
the dream of egalitarianism and,

1709
01:36:41,710 --> 01:36:42,620
and,
and,

1710
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:43,753
and maybe,
maybe who knows how much of it was 

1711
01:36:45,531 --> 01:36:48,590
motivated by genuine benevolence.
Some,

1712
01:36:48,591 --> 01:36:51,800
at least it's very difficult to see that
the Nazi,

1713
01:36:52,370 --> 01:36:56,570
the Nazi phenomenon was ever generated 
by any genuine benevolence.

1714
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,820
That's very difficult to,
to make a case for.

1715
01:36:59,540 --> 01:37:01,960
Um,
so maybe you can forgive the,

1716
01:37:02,220 --> 01:37:03,053
the socialists,
the communists utopians a hundred years 

1717
01:37:05,330 --> 01:37:07,250
ago because they didn't know what they 
were getting in for.

1718
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,720
People had warned them.
Dostoyevsky warn the neat,

1719
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:10,760
neat.
You warn them but,

1720
01:37:11,150 --> 01:37:11,983
but still,
and then the other thing too is the 

1721
01:37:13,551 --> 01:37:14,810
problem of inequality.

1722
01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:18,830
It's like the problem of inequality is a
real problem and it doesn't go away.

1723
01:37:18,831 --> 01:37:21,770
Like it's very difficult when you walk 
down bloor street for example,

1724
01:37:21,771 --> 01:37:22,604
in Toronto and you see homeless people,
alcoholics and drug addicts who are 

1725
01:37:25,191 --> 01:37:26,024
struggling and the mentally ill who are 
on the street and they're in their 

1726
01:37:28,431 --> 01:37:29,780
little domain of hell.
It's,

1727
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:33,080
it's really difficult for that to not 
tear at your heart strings and say,

1728
01:37:33,081 --> 01:37:33,914
well,
isn't the world and unjust place or an 

1729
01:37:35,121 --> 01:37:36,320
unfair place,
which it is.

1730
01:37:36,321 --> 01:37:41,321
And so you can see the never ending 
wellsprings of motivation to support the

1731
01:37:42,261 --> 01:37:46,610
oppressed.
And I think the fact that the communist,

1732
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:47,473
the communist dogma,
at least had that as part of its 

1733
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:54,860
initiating ethos is partly what seems to
make it forgivable.

1734
01:37:55,050 --> 01:37:56,550
I also think it's easier

1735
01:37:56,550 --> 01:37:59,970
for people to identify why fascism is 
wrong.

1736
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:01,440
We can say,
look,

1737
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:04,280
racial superiority,
nope.

1738
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:05,790
Okay.
It's pretty simple,

1739
01:38:05,791 --> 01:38:07,020
right?
It's three words.

1740
01:38:07,021 --> 01:38:08,040
You can really get it,

1741
01:38:08,450 --> 01:38:12,740
but,
but,

1742
01:38:13,340 --> 01:38:15,200
but equality of outcome,

1743
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:19,620
it's like that's really wrong.
It's really wrong.

1744
01:38:19,770 --> 01:38:22,080
But it's not so obvious why,
right?

1745
01:38:22,081 --> 01:38:24,900
It isn't,
you can't just say quality of outcome,

1746
01:38:24,901 --> 01:38:28,800
know and have everyone clap because it 
isn't as well.

1747
01:38:28,860 --> 01:38:30,990
And that's the thing.
It's really difficult to,

1748
01:38:31,140 --> 01:38:31,973
it's difficult to isolate the 
pathological elements in radical left 

1749
01:38:35,521 --> 01:38:38,940
wing thought because they're not self 
evidently pathological.

1750
01:38:38,941 --> 01:38:41,630
Like there's this old cliche,
um,

1751
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:45,270
from each according to his ability to 
each according to his need.

1752
01:38:45,330 --> 01:38:46,560
It's like,
yeah,

1753
01:38:46,561 --> 01:38:48,390
that sounds pretty good.
We have needs.

1754
01:38:48,391 --> 01:38:50,730
It's like,
let's have them fulfilled and well,

1755
01:38:50,731 --> 01:38:51,810
you have an ability,
well,

1756
01:38:51,811 --> 01:38:53,850
like manifested.
It's like,

1757
01:38:54,240 --> 01:38:56,100
well,
it doesn't work in practice.

1758
01:38:56,210 --> 01:38:57,043
In fact,
it's murderous in practice and it's a 

1759
01:38:58,741 --> 01:39:01,830
great catastrophe in some sense that 
it's murderous in practice.

1760
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:03,960
So I just think it's maybe part of it 
is,

1761
01:39:03,961 --> 01:39:07,110
it's just a hell of a lot harder to 
learn why it's wrong.

1762
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:08,670
That combined with,
you know,

1763
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:11,910
the genuine outpouring of compassion for
the oppressed and,

1764
01:39:12,330 --> 01:39:16,830
and which is like who's for poverty,
no one.

1765
01:39:16,831 --> 01:39:17,311
Right.
And,

1766
01:39:17,311 --> 01:39:21,210
and inequality is a painful reality.
It's painful for everyone.

1767
01:39:21,970 --> 01:39:24,120
You know,
even people who are self righteous about

1768
01:39:24,121 --> 01:39:25,290
their,
their status,

1769
01:39:25,291 --> 01:39:27,690
let's say in,
in the depths of their soul,

1770
01:39:27,810 --> 01:39:32,400
the struggling of the fact of the 
struggling still rips at them.

1771
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:34,590
And so

1772
01:39:36,020 --> 01:39:38,090
it's a more difficult lesson for us to 
learn.

1773
01:39:38,930 --> 01:39:40,100
So.
Yup.

1774
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:46,300
[inaudible]

1775
01:39:52,580 --> 01:39:56,000
do those people lined up at the mics?
I sorry for leaving you hanging.

1776
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:59,720
I'm sure we could go on all night if we 
had the time.

1777
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:02,390
Um,
but we must call this to a close.

1778
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:04,280
I would like to

1779
01:40:04,910 --> 01:40:05,743
salute you

1780
01:40:06,770 --> 01:40:11,770
for your patients and your dedication in
the face of the noise from outside.

1781
01:40:12,950 --> 01:40:14,390
Very nicely done.
Well done.

1782
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:19,880
[inaudible]

1783
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:23,353
as you,
uh,

1784
01:40:23,470 --> 01:40:24,303
as you no doubt are aware.
Professor Peterson has written an 

1785
01:40:26,871 --> 01:40:30,050
international best seller.
It's called 12 rules for life.

1786
01:40:30,051 --> 01:40:32,930
There are some presale in the hall now 
before you go,

1787
01:40:33,740 --> 01:40:34,573
let me just say this,
you have participated in what I would 

1788
01:40:40,771 --> 01:40:41,604
consider to be an important step in the 
life of this university and for that we 

1789
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:48,653
should thank you.
So thank you for coming and thank you 

1790
01:40:50,191 --> 01:40:51,024
for your support.

1791
01:40:51,370 --> 01:40:53,720
[inaudible]

1792
01:41:02,470 --> 01:41:04,290
professor Peterson,
uh,

1793
01:41:04,370 --> 01:41:08,830
maybe the most important intellectual a 
voice in this country today.

1794
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:10,530
And I would like to thank him very much.

1795
01:41:10,770 --> 01:41:15,770
Calming.
[inaudible]

1796
01:41:34,150 --> 01:41:34,983
so

1797
01:41:35,930 --> 01:41:36,860
good night,
be safe.

1798
01:41:37,490 --> 01:41:38,390
I just have,
sorry,

1799
01:41:38,391 --> 01:41:40,340
I just have one small thing to say.
Hold on.

1800
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:41,193
I would,
I would very much like to stay and talk 

1801
01:41:43,761 --> 01:41:46,160
with a bunch of you and I generally do 
that,

1802
01:41:46,161 --> 01:41:46,994
but I can't do it today because I have 
to go back to Toronto and I'm going to 

1803
01:41:50,181 --> 01:41:52,340
Australia tomorrow,
so I don't,

1804
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:54,500
I can't do that even though I would like
to,

1805
01:41:54,501 --> 01:41:58,130
so I have to run off and then I have to 
drive back to Toronto.

1806
01:41:58,870 --> 01:41:59,703
But despite that,
thank you very much for coming and for 

1807
01:42:02,300 --> 01:42:03,680
being patient and all of that.

1808
01:42:04,090 --> 01:42:09,090
Yup.
Great.

1809
01:43:48,890 --> 01:43:49,723
Yay.

1810
01:43:53,670 --> 01:43:58,670
Shame on Queens.
No freedom for hate speech.

1811
01:43:59,570 --> 01:44:01,990
Essentially.
Really,

1812
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:06,633
really chosen where I'm at with it.
And I've been looking at his voice and 

1813
01:44:08,431 --> 01:44:10,420
we're looking at the protest points.
I'm not really sure.

1814
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:11,553
Um,
I just think it's interesting that he's 

1815
01:44:12,370 --> 01:44:14,370
drawing the sort of crowd and that,
you know,

1816
01:44:14,380 --> 01:44:17,020
what's happening here is happening.
I think that really says something about

1817
01:44:17,021 --> 01:44:19,780
participation at Queens.
We're here to protest,

1818
01:44:20,050 --> 01:44:20,980
uh,
Jordan Peterson,

1819
01:44:20,981 --> 01:44:23,260
dean given,
given a platform at Cuny University,

1820
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:25,120
um,
Jordan Peterson,

1821
01:44:25,150 --> 01:44:27,280
aside from not knowing what he's talking
about,

1822
01:44:27,281 --> 01:44:28,114
these things,
a la pierce intention type featured by 

1823
01:44:30,371 --> 01:44:33,640
everything grow.
It's not a discussion about which topics

1824
01:44:33,660 --> 01:44:34,493
do you like on pizza.
It's a discussion about which people 

1825
01:44:36,670 --> 01:44:37,503
should be considered,
which you lose your respect and that's 

1826
01:44:39,551 --> 01:44:41,020
not a debate,
but you happen anywhere.

1827
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:49,930
I love that they are here.
How did this course,

1828
01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:51,910
because Lillian,
they don't agree with what he has to say

1829
01:44:51,911 --> 01:44:53,630
so they're showing it.
But uh,

1830
01:44:53,650 --> 01:44:57,520
I have seen a lot of people call to 
cancel.

1831
01:44:57,850 --> 01:44:58,683
They are showing the Daniel Walsh should
be ashamed of himself for allowing this 

1832
01:45:01,301 --> 01:45:03,460
to happen.
And that I just think is wrong.

1833
01:45:03,670 --> 01:45:04,503
Oh,
I don't know if it seems like we have a 

1834
01:45:05,261 --> 01:45:06,094
lot of very angry people here because 
someone's expressing an idea different 

1835
01:45:08,771 --> 01:45:13,510
than their own and here at a university,
I kind of thought that was the point.

1836
01:45:21,900 --> 01:45:25,080
Thank you.
Would you like one more Pepsi Cola?

1837
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:27,410
I'm good.
Same those words.

1838
01:45:51,670 --> 01:45:54,750
It takes bravery to say of that 
acceptable guys.

1839
01:45:54,751 --> 01:45:55,584
Yeah.
Like really?

1840
01:46:05,090 --> 01:46:07,990
They broke the fucking window.
I'll run in there.

1841
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:12,880
Jesus Christ.
Crazy,

1842
01:46:12,910 --> 01:46:13,743
crazy.
