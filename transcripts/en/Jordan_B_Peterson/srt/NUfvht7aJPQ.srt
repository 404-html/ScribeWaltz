1
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:03,503
So
we're going to continue with our 

2
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:11,220
discussion of clinical personality 
theories today,

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,710
moving away from the psychoanalytic or 
depth.

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,540
Psychoanalytic theorists are the depths 
psychologists.

5
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,750
We're just start to talk about the 
phenomenologists,

6
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:22,603
send the existentialists.
And so I need to lay down a little bit 

7
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:30,321
of background first and I think we'll 
start with a discussion of phenomenology

8
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:38,010
and existentialism.
Now for the phenomenologists,

9
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:38,844
this is a tricky concept to grasp.
I think I'll actually start by telling 

10
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:45,984
you that something you've taught,
something that Carl Jung wrote about in 

11
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:52,670
the last book he published,
which was called Ms Dot Miriam Shin us,

12
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,880
which means mysterious conjunction.
Um,

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:03,200
he sort of believed posited that there 
was some extensions of moral development

14
00:01:04,561 --> 00:01:09,561
past the higher levels of moral 
development that piaget identified.

15
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,140
Um,
and there were three of them.

16
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,300
And he said they could be symbolized by 
masculine,

17
00:01:18,301 --> 00:01:19,134
feminine to junctions or that they were 
in the literature that he had 

18
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,553
researched,
which was mostly l chemical literature 

19
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,660
from the late Middle Ages.

20
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,120
He said that one of the goals of moral 
development or of psychotherapy

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,460
with the producer union,
between the emotions and the motivations

22
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,503
and rationality.
And you can see that that's actually 

23
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:49,550
been a theme for all of the theorists 
that we've talked about so far,

24
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,453
made partly what psychotherapy or 
personality development seems to be 

25
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:55,044
about is the continual integration of 
the personality so that the person's 

26
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,093
psyche isn't at odds with itself and it 
can move forward with a minimum of 

27
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,060
conflict at something related to the 
Piagetian idea of an elevated state.

28
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:10,860
So if you're in an equivalent rate 
state,

29
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,290
you don't have the sense that there are 
parts of you warring against other parts

30
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,124
because you've been able to weave 
everything together into a coherent 

31
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:23,310
identity that covers the past and the 
present and the future.

32
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,043
So the first stage in use vision of what
constituted higher development was the 

33
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:33,720
union of the of rationality with emotion
and motivation.

34
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,553
And he saw that that was symbolized in 
the literature that he had reviewed by 

35
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,373
masculine spirit,
feminine emotions and and motivation 

36
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,333
bank together in one thing.
So that then would be the united mind 

37
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:50,154
and spirit in a sense.
And then the next stage which was 

38
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:57,750
symbolized again by the masculine,
feminine symbolism.

39
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,290
It was the union united
mind spirit.

40
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,124
With the body and so what that would 
mean is that once you got your act 

41
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:08,290
together,
so to speak,

42
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,573
you would implement it in your behavior 
so that there was no contradictions 

43
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,400
between who you were in terms of how you
thought,

44
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,430
how you felt and what you wanted and 
what you were actually doing.

45
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,340
Modern philosophers that describe what 
they call a performative contradiction,

46
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,880
which they've formally described as it 
another type of of light,

47
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,060
essentially another type of deceit which
is that you say one thing and do another

48
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,400
and it and and it's interesting because 
it's not.

49
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,773
It's not a logical.
It's not a form of logical deceit in a 

50
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:46,054
sense because your conceptualizations 
are abstract and your behavior is 

51
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:50,344
concrete,
but there can still be a contradiction 

52
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:53,164
between the two,
especially when you start to understand 

53
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:55,384
that most of what your psyche is 
representing our Schema for action 

54
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,663
rather than for representation.
So the point is is that once your 

55
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:11,230
emotions and your motivations are 
working alongside your rational mind,

56
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,573
really that your rational mind is 
property nested within them because 

57
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:15,604
that's.
That's a much more accurate way of 

58
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:19,240
looking at it.
Then the next thing you should do is act

59
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,720
consistently in accordance with who you 
are.

60
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:27,520
So that stage to both of those stages 
are pretty easy to understand,

61
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,660
but the third stage is actually a 
phenomenal logical stage.

62
00:04:31,661 --> 00:04:34,150
You have to think phenomenologically to 
understand it.

63
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,960
So here's,
here's one way of thinking about it.

64
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,960
So imagine that you go home and let's 
say you set up a room and uh,

65
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:49,180
in that room,
it's not a very nice room.

66
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,043
You know,
maybe you've got some posters on the 

67
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,920
wall and they're sort of hanging a 
little cockeyed and you know,

68
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:57,120
there's dust bunnies are making 
underneath the bad.

69
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,993
Then
you have piles of paperwork that you 

70
00:05:01,421 --> 00:05:05,290
haven't done and you know,
homework and you know,

71
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:06,124
maybe there's the odd cresta brand or so
forth lying about when you walk in 

72
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:15,061
there,
it's you in the room.

73
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,473
That's one way of thinking about.
But another way of thinking about it is 

74
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:24,151
that when you walk in there,
you are in the room just like you're the

75
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:25,294
room when you're here because the room 
makes up a part of what you're 

76
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:29,914
experiencing.
And the phenomenologists would say in a 

77
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:34,294
sense that the best way to conceptualize
the self in its totality is what you 

78
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,374
experience,
like everything that you experienced as 

79
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:44,374
you.

80
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,693
And so what that would mean is that 
there's no difference between putting 

81
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:49,804
the posters up on your wall properly and
cleaning underneath the bed and maybe 

82
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:58,280
making it and finishing your homework 
and putting the room in so that you feel

83
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,353
confident and calm there and maybe even 
enjoy being there or maybe even so that 

84
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:04,364
it's beautiful there.
There's no difference between that and 

85
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:11,780
fixing up your own personality.
So then you could say,

86
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,710
here's another way of looking at it,
and I do this.

87
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:18,440
I believe that this is a very profound 
way of looking at things.

88
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:21,450
So then imagine that you could extend 
that you,

89
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,293
but it's kind of easy to understand when
you think about it as your own room 

90
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:25,214
because you're in there quite a lot.
And so maybe let's say you're in your 

91
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:27,704
room 10 percent of the day.
So we could say that the experiences 

92
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:35,090
that characterize your room are 10 
percent of you,

93
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,440
at least for the time being.

94
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,483
And that you can have a low quality 
experience in their high quality 

95
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:42,420
experience in there.
Um,

96
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,413
no,
don't say that you start generalizing 

97
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:48,620
that to the whole house and also then 
you can start thinking,

98
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:49,454
well,
are their problematic places in the 

99
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:52,424
house or they're problematic 
relationships among the people in the 

100
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:59,630
house and those problematic 
relationships are also you.

101
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,980
And you can tell when there's a problem 
because you encounter undesired negative

102
00:07:06,141 --> 00:07:06,974
emotion in,
in relationship to some relationship or 

103
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,000
in some physical locale within the 
house.

104
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,520
And maybe you could fix that,
you know,

105
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,270
little incremental bit by incremental 
Beck you could work on that.

106
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,133
You could note that the negative emotion
that you don't want to have a rise 

107
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,780
signifies something.
It signifies that that situation in some

108
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:33,920
sense non optimal.
And then you could work on strategies to

109
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:38,921
optimize that and you don't do that 
until you stop making the presupposition

110
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:41,720
that there's you.

111
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,910
And then there's the house.
It's like,

112
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,193
well,
the distinction between you and where 

113
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:47,924
you are is a very unclear distinction.
So then let's say you're walking down 

114
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:52,034
the street or you're going into a store 
and maybe your managers aren't as good 

115
00:07:56,871 --> 00:08:01,280
as they could be because you know,
to be really socially sophisticated is a

116
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:02,510
real art.
You can learn,

117
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,330
it can take you decades to learn how to 
do that properly.

118
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:09,020
And people who are really,
really socially skilled have a much,

119
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,090
much higher quality existence because no
matter where they go,

120
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,493
they immediately established a 
relationship with the people that 

121
00:08:17,211 --> 00:08:21,470
they're talking to.
And then it's not an impersonal and,

122
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,140
and Dan doore aggravating interaction.
So,

123
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:24,974
you know,
maybe they'll walk into a store and the 

124
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:27,980
first thing they do if someone comes up 
with,

125
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:30,650
helps them as they look at the person 
and you know,

126
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,310
ask them how they're doing and how their
day has been.

127
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,170
And they make a little relationship and 
you know,

128
00:08:36,171 --> 00:08:37,004
the person is kind of happy about that 
because it sort of pops them out of 

129
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:42,560
their persona role.
And then it can have a little discussion

130
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:44,810
about what they're doing in the store 
and what they want.

131
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:46,970
And then all of a sudden it's a high 
quality experience.

132
00:08:46,971 --> 00:08:48,710
And that person,
everywhere they go,

133
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:49,544
if they're skilled blight,
that so they're awake and they're 

134
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:53,780
attentive and they're listening,
everywhere they go,

135
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:55,800
they can have a high quality 
interaction.

136
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:59,340
You know when people who learn how to do
that,

137
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,233
learn to do it partly by noticing when 
they're in an interaction with someone 

138
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,783
or somewhere that if it isn't going in 
an optimal manner or if it's producing 

139
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,593
undesired negative emotion,
then there's something wrong with the 

140
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:16,284
way that they're being in that situation
and they pay attention to that and see 

141
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:20,910
if they could figure out how to modify 
it.

142
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:25,080
A lot of it is attention and listening,
which is there are key components to say

143
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:30,081
that Rogerian psychotherapist,
10 attention and listening so

144
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,980
you might say,
well,

145
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:39,780
so so you can go into your room and you 
can identify little problems that are in

146
00:09:39,781 --> 00:09:43,140
your room that you could fix,
that maybe you would fix.

147
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:43,974
And so then you can start fixing them 
and that improves the quality of that 

148
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:47,064
particular environment.
And then you could start to generalize 

149
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,490
beyond,
you know,

150
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:55,440
the locales that are more specifically 
under your control.

151
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,020
Because if you're walking down flora,
for example,

152
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,510
and you go into a store and you talk to 
a clerk,

153
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:01,823
well the probability is pretty high that
the clerk is at least reasonably 

154
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:05,064
functional,
so you shouldn't be able to get beyond 

155
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:07,554
their barriers in a sense and have a 
genuine interaction with them without 

156
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:11,934
too much difficulty,
but then maybe you're wandering down 

157
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:18,180
bluer and you run across someone who's 
schizophrenia and maybe alcoholic at the

158
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:22,110
same time and while that's a part of 
your experience,

159
00:10:22,111 --> 00:10:25,680
that might supersede your ability to 
transform.

160
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,470
Right?
The phenomenologists.

161
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,143
People like Rogers aren't making the 
claim that you should be able to solve 

162
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:33,774
every problem that you've come across or
even that you should try because 

163
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:41,610
there'll be things that you experienced 
that are so complex and problematic that

164
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,910
you might make the Morris.
If you fiddle around with them.

165
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,793
You know you gotta.
Be Very careful not to extend yourself 

166
00:10:49,201 --> 00:10:50,034
dramatically beyond your skill level,
but you can certainly start in isolated 

167
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,063
locales and if you stopped presuming a 
priority that there's some radical 

168
00:11:01,471 --> 00:11:02,304
distinction between you and the 
environment that you happen to be in 

169
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,533
because it's all your experience.
If you start making that subject object 

170
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:11,964
distinction,
which is one of the things that 

171
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:13,554
phenomenologists really objected to 
because they concentrated on being in 

172
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:17,274
such,
which was sort of lived experience as 

173
00:11:19,681 --> 00:11:20,514
the ground of reality rather than the 
objective world is the ground of 

174
00:11:23,671 --> 00:11:24,504
reality.

175
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,270
If you,
if you,

176
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,163
if you allow yourself to step outside 
that dichotomy and you start to 

177
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:33,354
understand that wherever you go and 
including the places that you're in a 

178
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:41,130
lot that there's no distinction between 
fixing up those places.

179
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:42,803
When you notice that there's something 
wrong with them and you could fix them 

180
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:47,070
up and fixing yourself up,
it's,

181
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,123
it opens up a whole new avenue to 
getting your life together because you 

182
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:54,340
know people always think they have to 
work themselves.

183
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,593
It's like it's not.
This is one of the things that the 

184
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:59,980
psychoanalysts I think didn't get quite 
right.

185
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,950
Although young touchstone,
it is later words,

186
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:04,973
there's not all of you,
isn't inside your head for the 

187
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:11,050
psychoanalysts,
a lot of what the work that you're doing

188
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:13,330
on yourself,
on your own,

189
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,193
on the relationship,
say between your conscious and your 

190
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:16,474
unconscious mind,
but tremendous amount of that was sort 

191
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,170
of inside your skull,
so to speak,

192
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,873
but the phenomenologists,
the phenomenal logical approach enables 

193
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:26,854
you to start reconceptualizing the 
psyche if as something that extends 

194
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:36,190
beyond you and always will and so that 
you can work on it's reconstruction

195
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,063
at any level of analysis where your own 
nervous system is signaling to you that 

196
00:12:44,141 --> 00:12:44,980
there's a problem.

197
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,760
The way it does that is well,
it's a variety of ways,

198
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,470
but to have the most reliable ways.
Our negative emotion.

199
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,503
There's a new paper,
for example that shows that 

200
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:01,360
conscientiousness is quite tightly 
associated with proneness to guilt,

201
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,660
so that's the negative emotion that 
seems to go with conscientiousness.

202
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,243
So guilt and anxiety and shame and no 
sorts of emotions which are unpleasant 

203
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,880
also simultaneously signal the presence 
of a problem and so you and and and what

204
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,080
resentment.
That's another good one.

205
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,063
So you can,
instead of having those emotions as 

206
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:20,201
entities,
he'd say,

207
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:21,790
well,
I just want that to go away.

208
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,900
You can think,
okay,

209
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,270
there's my,
my,

210
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:30,420
my being I embody being is signaling to 
me that something is not optimal here.

211
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,530
And then it's not an enemy.
It's,

212
00:13:33,531 --> 00:13:35,950
it's because it's,
it's something that's trying to improve,

213
00:13:35,951 --> 00:13:38,830
say the quality of your present 
experience on your future experience and

214
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,173
if you don't push that aside,
you're pretending it's not happening or 

215
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:43,654
assumed instantaneously that it's the 
fault of the environment or the person 

216
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,284
that you're talking to.

217
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,543
Then that can be incredibly instructive.
Negative emotion is incredibly 

218
00:13:51,821 --> 00:13:52,654
instructive,
but you have to adjust your attitude so 

219
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:55,624
that you understand that it's signaling 
to you the presence of corrective 

220
00:13:59,651 --> 00:14:00,484
information.
If you could just figure out what that 

221
00:14:01,391 --> 00:14:03,610
information is and that can come from 
anyone,

222
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,580
a person or a place or a thing or,
or,

223
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,720
or yourself or you don't need to make 
the distinctions,

224
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,450
you know.
And so if you're having an argument with

225
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:16,450
your partner and it's not going very 
well,

226
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:17,963
I mean it.
There's a tremendous tendency among 

227
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:24,430
people to try to win an argument with 
their partner,

228
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,103
but you can't win an argument with your 
partner because then you win and they 

229
00:14:29,321 --> 00:14:33,820
lose and then you have a loser on your 
hands and if you do that 100 times,

230
00:14:33,821 --> 00:14:36,220
maybe you're better at arguments than 
they are,

231
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,750
for example,
or you know,

232
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,584
or maybe they think more in an intuitive
way so they can't dance on their feet 

233
00:14:41,801 --> 00:14:42,940
quite as fast as you.

234
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:47,560
Or maybe the situation is reversed.
If you in the bloody argument 100 times,

235
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,053
you're not a winner.
You just someone who's beat up your 

236
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:52,394
partner 100 times.
What you want to find out is what the 

237
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:55,484
hell is it that they're talking about,
and sometimes that takes a tremendous 

238
00:14:58,461 --> 00:14:59,294
amount of patients.
They should be doing the same thing to 

239
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:01,484
you because very frequently the things 
that people are arguing about are only 

240
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,273
the tiny.
It's like the snow on the surface of of 

241
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,890
a glazier.
The real argument is deep,

242
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:14,090
deep,
deep underneath,

243
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:18,440
and unless you listen intently and for a
long period of time,

244
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:19,933
you'll never figure out what it is 
you're arguing about and then if you 

245
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:23,504
win,
the person won't be able to talk about 

246
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:25,904
it and that problem will be there for 
the rest of your relationship and maybe 

247
00:15:28,131 --> 00:15:30,740
for the rest of your life unless you 
solve the problem,

248
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:31,850
it's not going to go away.

249
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,003
Now,
I'm going to start talking about Roger 

250
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:41,660
specifically by
by going over some of the things that he

251
00:15:41,661 --> 00:15:42,494
had to say about listening because I 
think I've learned more about listening 

252
00:15:46,521 --> 00:15:47,354
from Rogers than for many other 
personality theorists or or 

253
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:55,630
psychotherapists that I've encountered.
Now we could go back to the fundamentals

254
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:56,894
of psychotherapy.
Mean really what you're doing in 

255
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:04,901
psychotherapy is trying to help the 
person become a better person and that's

256
00:16:05,121 --> 00:16:07,850
not exactly a scientific formulation,
better person.

257
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:08,783
No,
and it's a tricky thing to get at 

258
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:13,820
because people can be bitter persons in 
lots of different ways.

259
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:18,930
Nearly the fact that your people theory 
in their temperaments indicates that you

260
00:16:18,931 --> 00:16:19,764
know your way of being a better person 
and your way of being a better person 

261
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,430
wouldn't necessarily be the same way.
You know,

262
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,353
because you.
It's like maybe someone's grade on the 

263
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:30,200
violin and another person is great on 
the piano.

264
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:31,843
The grades the same but.
But the instrument is different and I 

265
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,320
think and that's a good way of looking 
at it.

266
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:40,010
And so part of what you do in 
psychotherapy,

267
00:16:40,011 --> 00:16:42,110
and I think you do this in any genuine 
relationship,

268
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,730
is not only is the dialogue about how to
become a better person.

269
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,713
That continuing dialogue is also always 
about just exactly what constitutes a 

270
00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:54,260
better person.
So you're talking about the goal and the

271
00:16:54,261 --> 00:16:55,094
process at the same time and what you're
doing is working it out so that the 

272
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:03,500
people go into the conversation with the
specific orientation and the orientation

273
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:04,334
is generally with client and therapist 
is the client comes with it with a 

274
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,194
problem.
Their life isn't acceptable in its 

275
00:17:10,851 --> 00:17:11,684
current form and they come with one more
thing which is the desire to make it 

276
00:17:15,651 --> 00:17:16,690
better.
And.

277
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,940
And something that you should all know 
because this will stop you from tangling

278
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:22,670
yourself up in your life to a tremendous
degree.

279
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:23,563
You cannot help someone who hasn't 
decided that they want things to be 

280
00:17:28,701 --> 00:17:32,420
better unless they make the decision 
that they want to make things better.

281
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,390
Forget it.
You're wasting your time and all it will

282
00:17:35,391 --> 00:17:38,390
do is hurt you.
And I should also tell you that that was

283
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,224
one of Roger's necessary preconditions 
for psychotherapy and other one was 

284
00:17:42,951 --> 00:17:47,330
honesty and communication,
but the person who was coming in for the

285
00:17:47,331 --> 00:17:48,164
therapeutic process had to be there.
And it's a weird thing and I don't know 

286
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:56,200
how to account for it,
but I don't think that you could talk to

287
00:17:56,201 --> 00:18:01,201
someone who doesn't want to have things 
be better into warranty,

288
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:04,230
that they have to come to that decision 
on their own.

289
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,170
So they come in with having made that.
So it's,

290
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:07,951
for example,
it's very,

291
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:08,784
very difficult.
Maybe it's impossible to do 

292
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,500
psychotherapy with someone who's been 
remanded by the court,

293
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,190
you know,
because they're,

294
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,670
they're in voluntarily and they'll just 
put a wall,

295
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,030
you know?

296
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:18,863
Not always,
but a lot of the time they'll just put 

297
00:18:19,771 --> 00:18:21,680
up a wall and just wait it out,
you know,

298
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:22,973
you're not going to get in there with a 
screwdriver and pry off that Shell so 

299
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:30,900
the person has to step forward in a 
sense and say,

300
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:31,734
well,
you know,

301
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:35,250
there's something not right about the 
way things are going for me and it could

302
00:18:35,251 --> 00:18:39,720
be better and I and someone else might 
be able to help me figure that out.

303
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,093
So.
And that's a really good attitude to 

304
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:42,541
have.
By the way,

305
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,374
when you're listening to someone because
disagree with them or not or agree with 

306
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:49,500
them or not,
there's always the possibility that they

307
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:50,334
will tell you something you don't know.
And like lots of times when people are 

308
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:54,564
talking,
what they're trying to do is to impose 

309
00:18:56,341 --> 00:18:57,174
their viewpoint on another person.
In your conversations like this all the 

310
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:01,410
time,
their arguments really.

311
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:05,250
And they're often ideological arguments.
It's like you're right and I'm wrong,

312
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,920
or sorry,
that never happens

313
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,373
when I braid in,
you're wrong and I'm just going to hack 

314
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:15,390
it you until you shut up or you agree.
Really,

315
00:19:15,391 --> 00:19:18,120
you'll never agree because you just 
don't get someone to agree that way.

316
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,260
It's,
it's not possible,

317
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,393
but you might be able to allow them into
silence or anger and but that's a 

318
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:28,080
dominance hierarchy thing.
That's not a real conversation.

319
00:19:28,081 --> 00:19:31,250
It's just all you're doing is 
establishing that you're,

320
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,213
you know,
a lobster with bigger claws than than 

321
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,540
the person that you're trying to pick 
out.

322
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,273
A therapeutic conversation which is a 
genuine conversation is one in which 

323
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:46,550
both the people in the conversation are 
oriented towards a higher state of being

324
00:19:47,641 --> 00:19:50,040
well.
They're conversing and you can tell when

325
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,870
you're in a conversation like that 
because it's very,

326
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:52,800
very engaging.

327
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,430
In fact,
if the conversation isn't engaging,

328
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,863
then that's a sign that you're not 
having a conversation and that's really 

329
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:04,290
useful thing to know too because here's 
another thing I can tell you that if you

330
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,840
take to heart will save you an awful lot
of grief and misery.

331
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:11,400
If you're talking to someone and they're
not listening,

332
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:15,030
shut up.
Just stop.

333
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,380
It's like you can tell if they're not 
listening and if they're not listening,

334
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,950
quit saying words.
It'll take.

335
00:20:19,951 --> 00:20:21,720
You'll just feel like a fool anyways 
because you're,

336
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:24,840
it's like you're throwing ping pong 
balls against the brick wall,

337
00:20:24,841 --> 00:20:26,070
you know,
you're not getting anywhere.

338
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:29,430
If they're not listening,
that's a sign that the system,

339
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,293
the situation isn't set up to allow you 
to progress on the path that you're 

340
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,573
choosing.
And so then you have to stop and you 

341
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:37,621
think,
okay,

342
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:39,000
well,
what's going on here?

343
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,190
Why is the person who's listening,
you know,

344
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,940
am I being too forceful and my,
do they not understand what I'm saying?

345
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,470
Is it too much about me?
Um,

346
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,410
do they want to talk?
What's going on?

347
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,290
Maybe they don't want to be here.
There's all sorts of possibilities,

348
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,124
but that's when you have to wake up past
what it is that you're trying to impose 

349
00:20:57,821 --> 00:21:01,300
on the situation and explore and see 
what's there.

350
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:04,480
And that's way more interesting than 
trying to impose your viewpoint.

351
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,690
The other thing is that if you're 
talking to someone,

352
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,910
you know,
I like to talk to people whose political

353
00:21:09,911 --> 00:21:10,744
beliefs are very different from mine 
because I can really understand how 

354
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:17,700
someone's political beliefs can be 
really different than mine.

355
00:21:17,701 --> 00:21:18,534
You know,
because I got kind of a coherent 

356
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,493
representation of my beliefs,
but it's very interesting to talk to 

357
00:21:23,621 --> 00:21:26,500
people who have radically different 
because they'll tell you things that you

358
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:27,334
haven't considered.
It doesn't mean you have to agree with 

359
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,000
them,
but it's.

360
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:32,043
It's much more informative to walk away 
from a conversation having learned 

361
00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:36,304
something that you didn't know then it 
is having won the stupid argument which 

362
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:40,744
you can't win anyways,
and that's especially the case when 

363
00:21:43,601 --> 00:21:45,940
you're dealing with people who are close
to you,

364
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,813
that you,
that you will have around for the rest 

365
00:21:48,971 --> 00:21:49,804
of your life.
You cannot win an argument with them 

366
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,250
because all that will happen is if you 
win,

367
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:58,240
they'll get you back.
Sooner or later they will listen to you.

368
00:21:58,241 --> 00:21:59,074
The next time you have something to talk
about or or they'll get resentful and 

369
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:02,584
then they won't be helpful.
Or if you just can't win an argument 

370
00:22:06,521 --> 00:22:09,220
with someone that you will have repeated
contact with.

371
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,950
What you can do,
however,

372
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:17,490
is you can have a conversation that's a 
real conversation and maybe you can come

373
00:22:18,431 --> 00:22:22,630
to terms about the thing that you're 
discussing and that's negotiation,

374
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:23,913
you know,
it's like,

375
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,570
well,
what do you want?

376
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:28,960
But you have to really want to know.
It's like you're having an argument,

377
00:22:28,961 --> 00:22:29,794
okay,
what is it that I would have to do 

378
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,273
because we're having this argument,
what would I have to do in order to 

379
00:22:35,171 --> 00:22:37,050
satisfy,
you know?

380
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:38,560
And then at a personal thing,
there's not going,

381
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:40,230
you can do to satisfy me because you 
know,

382
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,350
I'm so bad at you.
It's like,

383
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:44,140
that's not helpful.
The other person has to think,

384
00:22:44,141 --> 00:22:44,974
okay,
what are the conditions for my 

385
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,620
satisfaction?
You know,

386
00:22:47,621 --> 00:22:48,454
so maybe you know,
your partner says you're not paying 

387
00:22:50,051 --> 00:22:51,780
enough attention to me.
It's like,

388
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,760
all right,
what do you want?

389
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:57,100
Exactly.
You know,

390
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,023
you want to talk for 15 minutes at 
breakfast or do you want to talk for 20 

391
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:03,880
minutes at lunch or do you want to spend
an hour at night watching tv or,

392
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,013
or like,
do you want me to act differently when 

393
00:23:06,071 --> 00:23:07,900
they come home?
And I'm at the door,

394
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:12,610
it's like you're feeling unattended to 
what do you want?

395
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:13,930
Well then they'll say,
well,

396
00:23:13,931 --> 00:23:15,700
if you love me,
you should be able to figure that out.

397
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,450
That's

398
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,813
wrong because you're stupid.
You won't be able to figure that out 

399
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,920
because you know,
what the hell do you know?

400
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,250
So the other person,
unless they want to corner you into just

401
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,710
being the kind of loser who can figure 
things out,

402
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,560
which is why are they with you?
Then you know,

403
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,200
they need that to think about that.
It's like,

404
00:23:39,201 --> 00:23:41,630
oh,
what is it that I want from this person?

405
00:23:41,631 --> 00:23:44,010
What would constitute more attention?
Right?

406
00:23:44,011 --> 00:23:47,540
And that's making that argument much 
more high resolution.

407
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,960
And then it gives the other person a 
chance to actually respond.

408
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:51,913
And then you have to allow your partner 
to be a moron because of course they 

409
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,120
are.
So once you've killed them,

410
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,180
what you want,
you have to let them do it badly,

411
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:02,840
like 10 times because they're never 
going to do it right the first time.

412
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,950
So sometimes when I'm,
I've seen,

413
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:12,500
I've helped people sometimes with 
marital problems and one of the things I

414
00:24:12,501 --> 00:24:15,710
often recommend is that they,
they go on a date,

415
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,813
you know,
they take each other away from the home 

416
00:24:18,741 --> 00:24:20,750
where the kids are usually,
or maybe not,

417
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,790
maybe they don't have kids,
it doesn't matter.

418
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:25,700
And they do something that's just 
focused on each other,

419
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,440
you know?
And of course,

420
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,600
first of all they tell me they don't 
want to do that.

421
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,460
It's stupid.
It's like,

422
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:35,390
it isn't by the way,
it's not stupid.

423
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:36,051
It's like through,
Oh,

424
00:24:36,051 --> 00:24:38,840
you don't want to go out and have an 
enjoyable time with your partner.

425
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:43,400
Do you think your relationship's gonna 
survive when all you do is snipe at each

426
00:24:43,401 --> 00:24:45,810
other and do horrible things together.
It's like,

427
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,910
well no,
that's not gonna work.

428
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:49,130
So then they'll finally say,
okay,

429
00:24:49,131 --> 00:24:49,964
well go on a date,
we'll both look disgusted by the whole 

430
00:24:52,071 --> 00:24:54,870
idea.
And then they go and it's like,

431
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,600
it's just miserable,
right?

432
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,063
Like one person says something to the 
other that immediately sets them off 

433
00:25:01,011 --> 00:25:03,860
when they're out in the date because 
they're kind of mad about going anyways.

434
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:04,903
And then they come back and go,
well that just didn't work and we're 

435
00:25:06,231 --> 00:25:07,310
never going to do it again.

436
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,030
It's like,
no,

437
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,163
you're so,
you're telling me you're never going to 

438
00:25:12,321 --> 00:25:13,154
go out and do something enjoyable with 
your partner again because it didn't 

439
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:21,110
work very well.
It's like people don't think about it,

440
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:21,973
you know,
it's like.

441
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,580
So maybe when you take your partner out 
and you haven't been getting along,

442
00:25:25,581 --> 00:25:30,080
it takes you like 10 times before you 
have a relatively okay time,

443
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,870
but 10 times if you're going to go out 
with them,

444
00:25:32,871 --> 00:25:33,704
let's say,
well let's say you go out with them 

445
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:36,463
every two weeks is 25 times and let's 
say you're going to be with them for 30 

446
00:25:40,011 --> 00:25:41,840
years.
If you manage to,

447
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,010
you know,
get your act together.

448
00:25:43,011 --> 00:25:46,790
So that's 30 times 25,
that's 750 times.

449
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:52,090
So if you practice 10 times then you 
might be able to have 740 good times out

450
00:25:53,841 --> 00:25:54,500
together.
You know?

451
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,333
And that's an underestimate.
So 10 times of practicing is hardly a 

452
00:25:58,311 --> 00:26:00,800
problem for,
for that kind of return.

453
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:06,850
So
this is all part of this Rogerian.

454
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,433
Like following this path is all part of 
this Rogerian process of listening and 

455
00:26:12,231 --> 00:26:16,490
listening is trying to figure out what 
the hell the other person is telling you

456
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,880
and understanding at the same time that 
they don't know.

457
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,100
Like,
especially if they're upset,

458
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,143
they're not even sure what they're upset
about and they don't know what they 

459
00:26:24,891 --> 00:26:25,850
want,
you know,

460
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,710
because you can,
you can corner them by saying,

461
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,590
well you want to be attended to more,
what do you want?

462
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,830
And they'll try some weird defense like,
like I told you already,

463
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,873
like if you love me,
you already know which is a cliche and 

464
00:26:38,871 --> 00:26:41,450
it's a foolish cliched.
So you can't let that stop you.

465
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,173
I should,
I should tell you the sorts of barriers 

466
00:26:44,491 --> 00:26:46,560
that people will put up if you listen to
them too.

467
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:49,470
So.
So for example,

468
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:52,140
let me,
let me see if I can think about it for a

469
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:52,974
bit.

470
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,410
Yeah.
Well usually what happens is if you're,

471
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,500
if you're pushing someone say this is in
listening sort of way,

472
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:06,700
it's like,
what do you want?

473
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,373
Why do you want that?
What would be the conditions of your 

474
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:11,254
satisfaction?
You're pushing them fairly hard to 

475
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,473
clearly articulate their concerns and 
sometimes they're afraid to do that and 

476
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,673
if you're trying to hash out initial,
people usually have like five routines 

477
00:27:20,111 --> 00:27:20,944
they can go through.
One is they block you with some cliche 

478
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:28,180
or they say something annoying and then 
maybe they've got one other verbal trick

479
00:27:28,181 --> 00:27:30,820
after that and then once you push 
through that,

480
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:35,290
then they cry or they get angry and if 
if you still don't stop them,

481
00:27:35,291 --> 00:27:36,124
they stomp off and so if you're going to
have a successful conversation about 

482
00:27:40,331 --> 00:27:43,120
something difficult,
you need a routine for each of those.

483
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:43,954
It's like just because the person's 
angry doesn't mean the conversation is 

484
00:27:47,411 --> 00:27:48,244
over and just because the person price 
doesn't necessarily mean that you're a 

485
00:27:51,581 --> 00:27:52,414
sadist.

486
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,870
It's often a law.
Often tears are a trip.

487
00:27:55,871 --> 00:27:56,704
They mask anger,
so and what the person is doing in part 

488
00:27:59,741 --> 00:28:00,574
is they're using their emotions as it 
exploratory technique to find out how 

489
00:28:05,081 --> 00:28:08,740
important is this?
What happens if I just break down?

490
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,530
Will the person shut up and if the 
person shuts up,

491
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,000
they think,
oh,

492
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,990
that's not that important.
Right?

493
00:28:13,991 --> 00:28:15,910
Because they been able to use a 
technique.

494
00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:18,180
I'm not saying this as conscious,
it's it's,

495
00:28:18,181 --> 00:28:21,490
it's deeper than conscious,
it's just how people rub up against each

496
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,324
other when they're trying to figure out 
how things are structured and so if you 

497
00:28:26,231 --> 00:28:27,850
quit when they get upset,
then they think,

498
00:28:27,851 --> 00:28:28,684
oh,
well this thing isn't so important that 

499
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:34,420
it's worth this much upset,
but if you continue to,

500
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,830
well then they'll run away.
Well,

501
00:28:35,831 --> 00:28:36,664
one of the things you have to do if 
you're in any kind of relationship did 

502
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:41,200
you got to make a rule,
which is you can leave,

503
00:28:41,201 --> 00:28:43,160
but you got to come back,
but we're not done with this.

504
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:46,930
You can't run off
because it's not.

505
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:47,500
It's,
it's,

506
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,333
it's,
it's breaking the contract of the 

507
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,960
conversation.
You go to stay and hash it out.

508
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,170
So now,
okay,

509
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,120
now I'm going to read you some of the 
things that Rogers

510
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,593
talked about.

511
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,713
All right,
so one of the things he talked about is 

512
00:29:06,361 --> 00:29:07,194
this

513
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:08,763
idea called

514
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,040
unconditional positive regard.
Now

515
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:24,610
I don't think that's a very good phrase 
because unconditional positive regard is

516
00:29:24,611 --> 00:29:26,760
one of those things that can be turned 
into a new age,

517
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:29,050
cliche two seconds.
It's like,

518
00:29:29,051 --> 00:29:30,310
well,
no matter what you do will love.

519
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:31,144
You know,
there are lots of things you could do 

520
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,090
that,
that,

521
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,010
that,
that is just,

522
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,220
that's just not gonna Garner a lot of 
love,

523
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,533
so unconditional regard that it's not 
like there's not an idea behind that 

524
00:29:43,931 --> 00:29:45,610
because there really is an idea behind 
that.

525
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,340
But like,
like,

526
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,240
like I said,
it's not all new agey.

527
00:29:49,241 --> 00:29:51,730
After Roger's formulated it and it 
sounds like,

528
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,810
well all you have to do is be 
consistently positive towards the person

529
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,430
and you know,
they'll flourish.

530
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,110
It's like,
first of all,

531
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,130
you're going to have unconditional 
positive regard for Hitler.

532
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,330
It's like,
no,

533
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:05,523
and not only that,
you have a responsibility not to have 

534
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,753
unconditional positive regard for 
yourself or for other people because 

535
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,870
what you're trying to do is to make 
things better.

536
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:19,660
And so that means that the things that 
make things worse or bad,

537
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,280
right?
If there's better,

538
00:30:21,281 --> 00:30:22,114
there's going to be worse.
And if you're in favor of better than 

539
00:30:24,641 --> 00:30:25,474
you have to be not in favor of worse.
So I'm going to untangle unconditional 

540
00:30:29,441 --> 00:30:31,570
positive regard of it.
And like I said,

541
00:30:31,571 --> 00:30:34,960
I think Roger used to,
his word choice wasn't very good.

542
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,940
Here's,
here's a different way of thinking about

543
00:30:36,941 --> 00:30:37,774
it.
So if you're in a relationship with 

544
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:39,994
someone,
and this could even be a very short 

545
00:30:42,011 --> 00:30:42,844
relationship,
it could be this sort of relationship 

546
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:45,610
that you have when you go to talk to 
someone in a store.

547
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:47,350
Like I said,
if you get sophisticated about it,

548
00:30:47,351 --> 00:30:49,780
but let's assume it's a longer term 
relationship,

549
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,173
you have to decide what if,
if you're going to have that person's 

550
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,540
best interest in mind when you have the 
conversation,

551
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,620
you got to have that as sort of the top 
value in your value heart.

552
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:07,000
But the reason we're talking is because 
I want things to be better,

553
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,820
not better for me,
you know,

554
00:31:09,821 --> 00:31:11,350
maybe better for me too,
but,

555
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:14,950
but the better for me is a subordinate 
part of the better.

556
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,083
The reason we're communicating is 
because we both want things to be 

557
00:31:18,191 --> 00:31:19,024
better.
And then we both aren't absolutely sure 

558
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,130
what it would mean for things to be 
better.

559
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,013
We've got to exchange information until 
we figured that out and neither of us 

560
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:28,594
are sure about how we're going to get 
there and so we have to exchange 

561
00:31:30,101 --> 00:31:32,470
information until we figured out how to 
get there.

562
00:31:32,471 --> 00:31:33,304
And that's,
that's the initial axiomatic 

563
00:31:36,341 --> 00:31:40,490
precondition for a true conversation and
that's unconditional positive regard.

564
00:31:40,491 --> 00:31:41,324
It's like I,
I regard the person I'm talking with as 

565
00:31:44,741 --> 00:31:45,574
someone who could transform in a 
positive direction and who's willing to 

566
00:31:50,591 --> 00:31:55,420
attempt that and who will communicate to
that end even though they might screw up

567
00:31:55,421 --> 00:31:56,254
and you know,
there's going to be things in the way 

568
00:31:57,221 --> 00:31:58,054
and the sorts of things that the 
psychoanalysts talk about as resistance 

569
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:04,320
and then they're going to regard me the 
same way and you know,

570
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,430
I'm also going to make mistakes along 
the way.

571
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,313
So

572
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,670
now Roger has pointed out that in order 
to,

573
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,690
to communicate with someone in that 
manner,

574
00:32:17,691 --> 00:32:20,660
you had to be willing to put yourself in
their shoes essentially.

575
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:26,080
And he said there you had to comprehend 
the alternative phenomenal field.

576
00:32:27,891 --> 00:32:28,730
So,
which is okay.

577
00:32:28,731 --> 00:32:29,360
Well,
I'm,

578
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,193
I'm here,
this is my viewpoint coming out from 

579
00:32:31,851 --> 00:32:32,684
this place and now you have a viewpoint 
and they're similar enough so that we 

580
00:32:36,441 --> 00:32:37,274
can communicate about them,
but they're different enough so that 

581
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,130
they're not equivalent and the 
differences are actually meaningful.

582
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:46,340
So now I got a sort of pop myself out of
my framework,

583
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:47,563
put myself in years and figure out where
you're coming from and that's the goal 

584
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:52,604
of the conversation.
So sometimes that can even help you 

585
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:56,930
figure out where you're coming from,
you know,

586
00:32:56,931 --> 00:32:57,651
because you can say,
well,

587
00:32:57,651 --> 00:33:00,140
it sounds,
it looks to me like you're really angry,

588
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,060
and the person will say,
well no,

589
00:33:02,061 --> 00:33:03,440
I'm just,
I'm just A.

590
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,060
I'm sad.
It's like,

591
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,140
well,
they're all ready.

592
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,790
They look like they're going to bite you
and say,

593
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:08,624
no,
no.

594
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:12,140
It really looks like.
I think you might feel also a little bit

595
00:33:12,141 --> 00:33:15,500
angry and there'll be angry about you 
saying that of course,

596
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:20,060
but it led to may also be that their 
emotions are so jumbled together in this

597
00:33:20,061 --> 00:33:20,894
sort of chaotic jumble that they don't 
actually know what it is that they're 

598
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:29,291
experiencing because it's this terrible
on articulated chaotic bodily state that

599
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:33,123
is signaling something,
but that hasn't been articulated and so 

600
00:33:35,241 --> 00:33:39,020
they're kind of a mess and you're 
careful observation,

601
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,490
as long as they trust you and they 
should trust you.

602
00:33:41,491 --> 00:33:44,420
If they know that you have their best 
interests,

603
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,700
whatever that is in mind,
or at least that you're trying,

604
00:33:46,701 --> 00:33:47,534
that then they can trust you and then 
you can help them clarify what it is 

605
00:33:52,191 --> 00:33:54,500
that they're feeling.
You know what sort of coming up from the

606
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:59,501
body and what that's associated with and
what they'd like to do with it.

607
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,433
Roger says,
real communication occurs and the 

608
00:34:08,001 --> 00:34:12,380
evaluative tendency avoided when we 
listened with understanding.

609
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:16,490
Now the evaluative tendency he's talking
about is,

610
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:18,290
well,
let.

611
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:21,440
Let's simplify this a little bit.
Let's say I'm radically left waiting and

612
00:34:21,441 --> 00:34:22,274
I'm talking to someone who's radically 
right way and we start talking about 

613
00:34:24,921 --> 00:34:26,970
something like a,
um,

614
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:32,030
income distribution and the right wing 
person says,

615
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:35,930
well,
let's say the left wing person says,

616
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:36,973
well,
there's all these people at the bottom 

617
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:38,534
and they don't have a lot of money and a
lot of the reason that they're there is 

618
00:34:41,031 --> 00:34:42,380
because,
you know,

619
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:43,790
they,
they've encountered very,

620
00:34:43,791 --> 00:34:47,300
very harsh circumstances or maybe they 
have an illness or something like that.

621
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,160
And uh,
you know,

622
00:34:49,161 --> 00:34:52,670
there's a real distribution of 
intelligence and so lots of times people

623
00:34:52,671 --> 00:34:53,504
are at the bottom because they just 
don't have the cognitive resources to 

624
00:34:55,341 --> 00:34:57,800
climb.
And the right winger goes rubbish,

625
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:58,580
rubbish.

626
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,380
The reason that they're at the bottom is
because,

627
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,513
you know,
they don't work hard enough and they 

628
00:35:03,171 --> 00:35:06,530
don't take any care with,
with their longterm thinking.

629
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,350
And so the last one year says,
well,

630
00:35:09,351 --> 00:35:11,240
that's just prejudice.
And the rate when you're says,

631
00:35:11,241 --> 00:35:12,920
well,
you're just a bleeding heart liberal,

632
00:35:12,921 --> 00:35:14,870
and poof,
that's the end of the conversation.

633
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:19,460
And that's the evaluative tendency.
It's like you just come away the same as

634
00:35:19,461 --> 00:35:21,590
you were when you entered the 
conversation.

635
00:35:21,591 --> 00:35:23,750
There's be no exchange of information 
whatsoever.

636
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,753
All there's been is a hardening of 
prejudice and you can walk away feeling 

637
00:35:28,731 --> 00:35:29,564
morally superior because you know you 
demonstrated what a scum rat your 

638
00:35:33,351 --> 00:35:35,960
opponent is and how morally upright you 
are.

639
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:40,380
Well,
that's the value of a dependency.

640
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:43,020
That's not a conversation.
That's gonna lead to progress.

641
00:35:43,021 --> 00:35:45,810
If anything,
it's going to lead to increased feelings

642
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:50,100
of prideful arrogance on your part 
because you know everything and on their

643
00:35:50,101 --> 00:35:53,190
part too and like increased 
polarization.

644
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,960
It's not a helpful way of communicating,
you know,

645
00:35:56,961 --> 00:35:57,794
in this sort of thing as we'll see when 
we moved into the more social and 

646
00:36:01,291 --> 00:36:05,880
political consequences of a failure to 
communicate.

647
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,013
It's like that's a microcosm of what 
goes wrong in society when it really 

648
00:36:09,361 --> 00:36:10,970
starts to fall apart.
You know,

649
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,813
when the individuals within the society 
who have different viewpoints can no 

650
00:36:14,101 --> 00:36:17,730
longer communicate the whole society 
shapes and trembles.

651
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,133
And you can think about this from a 
democratic perspective too because you 

652
00:36:21,121 --> 00:36:21,931
might say,
well,

653
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:24,840
what's the purpose of elections?
Well,

654
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:27,570
people who are aligned with a particular
ideology think,

655
00:36:27,571 --> 00:36:28,404
well,
we need to win the election because our 

656
00:36:29,401 --> 00:36:33,660
viewpoint is right,
but then you might ask yourself,

657
00:36:33,661 --> 00:36:36,690
well,
why are there these other viewpoints and

658
00:36:36,691 --> 00:36:37,524
why do things go so bad when one 
viewpoint dominate so heavily that 

659
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:42,060
everyone who had the other viewpoint,
you know,

660
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,163
gets shot.

661
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,003
That seems like a bad thing.
So what exactly is going on in a 

662
00:36:47,401 --> 00:36:48,234
democratic state and what's going on is 
that there is all these different 

663
00:36:51,571 --> 00:36:54,390
viewpoints and a lot of them are 
temperamentally informed.

664
00:36:54,391 --> 00:36:55,620
So we know,
for example,

665
00:36:55,621 --> 00:36:56,454
that liberals are higher in openness and
lowering conscientiousness than 

666
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:03,114
conservatives,
and so the conservatives are 

667
00:37:05,101 --> 00:37:08,310
conscientious,
but they're not very creative and open,

668
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:11,370
so they're good at running things.
They're really good at running.

669
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,220
You're good at being managers and 
administrators for example,

670
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,290
but they're not very good at being 
innovative.

671
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,020
The liberals are good at being 
innovative because they're open,

672
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,660
but they're not very conscientious,
so like

673
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,023
and that they have to be less 
conscientious in some ways if they're 

674
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:26,994
going to be creative because 
conscientiousness can constrain 

675
00:37:28,531 --> 00:37:32,070
creativity and so for the society to 
work properly,

676
00:37:32,071 --> 00:37:32,904
the people with the liberal temperament,
the conservative temperament has to 

677
00:37:35,371 --> 00:37:37,440
interact with each other because the 
Liberals State Cup,

678
00:37:37,441 --> 00:37:38,274
all the new companies and the 
conservatives run them so and then in 

679
00:37:42,121 --> 00:37:43,620
the political state per se.

680
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,453
It's like conscientiousness is a virtue.
Although with if it's exaggerated too 

681
00:37:49,651 --> 00:37:51,270
much,
especially the orderly part,

682
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:52,104
then it can become tyranny and openness 
is a virtue to but you don't want every 

683
00:37:55,801 --> 00:37:56,634
bloody thing changing every second.
So there's got to be some constant 

684
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:07,470
negotiated peace between order and 
innovation.

685
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,390
And the way that that happens is that 
the two sides communicate.

686
00:38:10,391 --> 00:38:12,660
It isn't that one side wins and the 
other side wins.

687
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:13,763
It's the dialogue stays open so that the
viewpoints can be represented properly 

688
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:18,953
and so that as the environment moves to 
sometimes maybe the environment is such 

689
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:22,464
that being conscientious is going to be 
better and sometimes it's going to be 

690
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,103
environment is moved so that openness is
going to be better because the 

691
00:38:28,411 --> 00:38:29,244
environment moves,
the conversation has to track those 

692
00:38:32,461 --> 00:38:33,294
movements so the society stays healthy 
across time and then the same thing 

693
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,370
applies in any kind of longterm 
relationship.

694
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:44,590
It's like you marry someone,
now you've got two brains and they don't

695
00:38:44,591 --> 00:38:46,930
work the same.
It's like you want to have two braids or

696
00:38:46,931 --> 00:38:47,764
do you want to have one?
That's the first question you're going 

697
00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:50,134
to do a lot better with too.
So and then so how do you optimize the 

698
00:38:53,801 --> 00:38:54,634
functioning of the two braids?
While obviously they've caught a 

699
00:38:56,351 --> 00:38:57,184
communicate,
you know there's going to be freedom of 

700
00:38:59,741 --> 00:39:02,140
expression and there has to be 
listening.

701
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,910
So that's the evaluative tendency,
which is you're wrong.

702
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,580
Before I even know what you're talking 
about,

703
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:10,863
at least I should know what the hell 
you're talking about before it decided 

704
00:39:12,881 --> 00:39:15,400
if you're wrong.
And so back to the poverty issue.

705
00:39:15,401 --> 00:39:16,360
It's like,
well,

706
00:39:16,361 --> 00:39:18,730
what predicts poverty?
Well,

707
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:19,983
the sorts of things that the left way 
your talks about that predicts problem 

708
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:25,030
poverty,
so to the sorts of things that the right

709
00:39:25,031 --> 00:39:26,350
way here talks about.

710
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,183
So if you're really unconscientious and 
that makes you kind of makes you the 

711
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:34,750
sort of person that will rely on others 
to do the work.

712
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:37,600
If you're unconscientious you're much 
more likely to be poor.

713
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,393
And so that's a real social policy 
problem too because you have this 

714
00:39:42,101 --> 00:39:47,020
horrible problem where you have to sort 
out what's causing the poverty,

715
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:48,483
you know,
and who's taking advantage of the 

716
00:39:50,801 --> 00:39:53,770
attempts to alleviate it as well as 
figuring out.

717
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:55,103
So,
so that's more of an individual 

718
00:39:56,201 --> 00:39:57,034
temperament problem,
which is what the conservatives they're 

719
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:00,460
concerned about.
And then you also have to figure out how

720
00:40:00,461 --> 00:40:01,294
to address it on a social level,
which of course the conservatives don't 

721
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:03,934
like to think about,
but it's not like either side has 

722
00:40:06,011 --> 00:40:08,350
nothing to say.
There's information in both.

723
00:40:08,351 --> 00:40:11,440
Those perspectives is problematic though
because when you put them together,

724
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,280
the phenomenon becomes paradoxical and 
then it's very difficult to come up with

725
00:40:15,281 --> 00:40:16,030
a solution.

726
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:16,863
It challenges your cognitive resources 
and what the conservative and the 

727
00:40:19,471 --> 00:40:22,060
liberal want to do is just simplify it 
down to one explanation.

728
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,700
It's sociological.
That's the liberal,

729
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:27,070
it's temperamental.
That's the conservative,

730
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,710
and so then they have one answer to how 
it can be fixed.

731
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,500
We should fix society.
That's the liberal.

732
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,260
Those people should just get their act 
together.

733
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,670
That's the conservative.
It's like,

734
00:40:36,671 --> 00:40:38,170
yeah,
well fair enough.

735
00:40:38,171 --> 00:40:41,480
Except probably the problem is 
complicated to now,

736
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:42,314
so there's more than one solution 
necessary since it's not even ad 

737
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:47,090
problem.
Right.

738
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:53,040
Poverty is not our problem.
Poverty is like 10,000 problems and some

739
00:40:53,441 --> 00:40:55,300
of them aren't even associated with each
other.

740
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,553
You know,
like there's the poverty that's a 

741
00:40:57,041 --> 00:41:00,310
consequence of alcoholism.
That's not the same poverty.

742
00:41:00,311 --> 00:41:01,144
That's a consequence of say very low 
intelligence and that's a completely 

743
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:05,224
different poverty than the non 
conscientious poverty or the abuse 

744
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:08,974
poverty or.

745
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:13,060
And there's no reason to assume 
whatsoever that those should be amenable

746
00:41:13,061 --> 00:41:13,894
to the same solutions.
Real communication occurs and the 

747
00:41:18,101 --> 00:41:21,550
evaluative tendency avoided when we 
listen with understanding.

748
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:23,703
Understanding.
That's an interesting word because you 

749
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:26,471
might ask yourself,
well,

750
00:41:26,471 --> 00:41:31,471
what do you mean when you understand and
it's got this sort of physical aspect to

751
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:34,401
it,
right?

752
00:41:34,401 --> 00:41:35,234
That's the stand and then there's the 
underpart which sort of implies that to 

753
00:41:39,321 --> 00:41:40,154
understand something is to be under it 
and standing and so partly what happens 

754
00:41:44,811 --> 00:41:45,644
is if,
if I can listen to you with 

755
00:41:47,061 --> 00:41:47,894
understanding what that means is that I 
get a clear enough picture of what you 

756
00:41:50,601 --> 00:41:53,450
want so that I could change the way that
I am,

757
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,343
that I am.
Maybe the way I look at things like the 

758
00:41:56,841 --> 00:41:59,390
perceptual scheme through which I view 
the world,

759
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,450
but also my actions and if I can extract
it from you,

760
00:42:02,451 --> 00:42:03,284
then I understand I would be able to 
take what you told me and change myself 

761
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:08,803
if I felt that was appropriate or maybe 
it would just happen automatically 

762
00:42:11,631 --> 00:42:13,680
because now I have the deep 
understanding of you.

763
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:15,620
People are afraid of that,
right?

764
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:16,483
Because of say you've got yourself all 
hemmed in with some ideology and you're 

765
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,864
feeling pretty secure about that,
and then you listen to some dim who's 

766
00:42:24,521 --> 00:42:25,354
got completely the opposite perspective 
from you and you listen hard and all of 

767
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,590
a sudden you've got cracks in your 
system,

768
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,360
you know,
and then you have to think,

769
00:42:32,361 --> 00:42:34,790
oh,
maybe things are more complicated than I

770
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:35,624
thought they were.
Everything isn't all tied together in 

771
00:42:37,311 --> 00:42:39,740
this neat little package that can be 
unsettling.

772
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,083
It's unsettling fact.
If you're listening to someone and 

773
00:42:43,251 --> 00:42:46,190
you're really listening and you're not 
being unsettled,

774
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:50,000
the probability is pretty high either 
that you're not listening or that you're

775
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:50,834
not talking about anything of real 
consequence because if it's important 

776
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,750
and you're listening,
it's gonna Shift.

777
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,310
You know?
So there's this,

778
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,293
it's going to set you into that at least
a little bit into that state of chaos 

779
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,970
and what you're doing then just so you 
know,

780
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,750
is that instead of identifying with who 
you were,

781
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:11,150
which is the person that you were at 
before,

782
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:11,993
the conversation you're identifying with
the person you could be as you move 

783
00:43:16,311 --> 00:43:19,760
through the conversation and that's a 
way better thing to identify with,

784
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:21,860
you,
know you to identify with your beliefs.

785
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:22,693
This is a phd and idea,
or you've been identified with your 

786
00:43:24,651 --> 00:43:25,484
beliefs or you going to identify with 
the process that allows you to generate 

787
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:30,524
beliefs and often those things are in 
contradiction because if you identify 

788
00:43:34,611 --> 00:43:36,710
with the process that allows you to 
change your beliefs,

789
00:43:36,711 --> 00:43:38,420
then you're.
You're,

790
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,750
you're assaulting your beliefs even 
though you might be correcting them,

791
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:42,920
but it's,
it's,

792
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:44,403
it's demanding to do that because you're
reconfiguring your physiology and 

793
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:53,300
there's an intermediary period of 
uncertainty that goes along with that.

794
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:55,310
What if they're right?
Well,

795
00:43:55,311 --> 00:43:56,180
that month,
so like,

796
00:43:56,181 --> 00:43:57,260
yeah,
well then what

797
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,660
we'll communication occurs in the 
evaluative tenancy avoidance.

798
00:44:02,661 --> 00:44:05,240
When we listened with understanding,
what does this mean?

799
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:07,123
It means to see the expressed idea and 
attitude from the other person's point 

800
00:44:10,581 --> 00:44:15,410
of view to sense how it feels to him to 
achieve his frame of reference in regard

801
00:44:15,411 --> 00:44:16,730
to the thing he is talking about.

802
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,833
So there's also rogers is very 
emphasized is very much the idea of 

803
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:24,950
embodiment.
So you can listen to someone,

804
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,850
you can listen to their arguments with 
your mind.

805
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,433
It's a very logical process.
It's of a rational and logical process 

806
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:35,160
and in some sense that's what you're 
taught to do.

807
00:44:35,161 --> 00:44:35,994
For example,
when you debate and the idea there is 

808
00:44:38,131 --> 00:44:38,964
that you know,
the argument is it's a cognitive 

809
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:46,470
phenomenon and that the,
the logic is structured in a logical way

810
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:47,543
and that the way that the argument is 
settled by is by the exchange of 

811
00:44:51,061 --> 00:44:54,940
information and the relative coherence 
of the two perspective.

812
00:44:54,941 --> 00:44:55,774
It's a very rationalistic perspective 
and it's very useful to be able to 

813
00:44:59,431 --> 00:45:00,720
debate,
don't get me wrong and,

814
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,613
and have your mind organized so that you
could put forward a logical arguments 

815
00:45:04,441 --> 00:45:08,100
like that's why you're in university.
So to learn how to do that,

816
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,173
believe it or not,
and but it's not the same sort of thing 

817
00:45:12,031 --> 00:45:12,864
that rogers is after because when Rogers
talks about the interactions between 

818
00:45:16,201 --> 00:45:17,250
people,
it's embodied.

819
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:19,800
So like if I'm really watching you when 
I'm talking to you,

820
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,053
paying attention to your face,
you're going to be like expressing 

821
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:27,030
emotions with your face screen because 
that's what it does,

822
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:27,873
right?
Your face expresses emotion so that 

823
00:45:29,431 --> 00:45:34,431
other people can infer what it is that 
you're up to even more than you know.

824
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:35,573
Because if you knew that you could just 
tell them you wouldn't even need 

825
00:45:37,141 --> 00:45:39,540
emotions,
but what the hell do you know about what

826
00:45:39,541 --> 00:45:40,374
you want?
That's why you're having a conversation 

827
00:45:41,701 --> 00:45:42,534
with someone to figure it out.
So you're watching them like mad and 

828
00:45:45,211 --> 00:45:46,044
you're watching their posture and maybe 
you're mirroring them and you can do 

829
00:45:48,271 --> 00:45:49,104
that consciously to some degree,
but it's probably better if you just do 

830
00:45:51,151 --> 00:45:54,240
it unconsciously.
And then when you're mirroring them with

831
00:45:54,241 --> 00:45:55,074
your body,
then you can feel what they're feeling 

832
00:45:56,491 --> 00:45:57,324
and then you can start to draw 
inferences about what it is that they 

833
00:45:59,641 --> 00:45:59,970
want.

834
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:00,803
By noticing how you're feeling,
this is often one of the things that 

835
00:46:03,271 --> 00:46:04,104
will stop people dead in the source of a
conversation because the other person 

836
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:07,464
will get upset and then you'll watch 
that and then that'll make you feel 

837
00:46:10,111 --> 00:46:10,980
upset,
and then you go,

838
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:11,903
oh,
I can't deal with this anymore because 

839
00:46:12,451 --> 00:46:14,040
it's too upsetting.
It's like,

840
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:15,053
well,
maybe the fact that it's upsetting is 

841
00:46:18,151 --> 00:46:20,760
actually an indication that you really 
should deal with it.

842
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:23,820
You know you can't just run away if it's
upsetting,

843
00:46:24,330 --> 00:46:26,970
upsetting.
Something's being flipped over.

844
00:46:26,971 --> 00:46:27,804
That's why it's upsetting when you don't
want to fail out just because you're 

845
00:46:30,751 --> 00:46:33,450
upset.
It's like you no clue in.

846
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:34,643
That's not the time to quit.
We want to maybe detach a bit from your 

847
00:46:37,201 --> 00:46:38,910
emotion so you don't get drowned in 
them,

848
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:41,310
so you can use them in an informative 
manner,

849
00:46:41,311 --> 00:46:42,450
but you don't want to stop.

850
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:44,460
That's.
You've got things going then

851
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:51,150
stayed in so briefly.
This may sound absurdly simple.

852
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,800
Well,
I didn't state it so briefly,

853
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:53,993
but it's not.
It's an approach which we have found 

854
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:58,590
extremely potent in the field of 
psychotherapy.

855
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:00,043
It is the most effective agent we know 
for altering the basic personality 

856
00:47:03,451 --> 00:47:08,010
structure of an individual and improving
his relationships and his communications

857
00:47:08,011 --> 00:47:10,920
with others.
If I can listen to what he can tell me,

858
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:14,970
if I can understand that,
how it seems to him,

859
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:18,750
if I can see it's personal meaning for 
him,

860
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:23,010
if I can sense the emotional flavor 
which it has for him,

861
00:47:23,011 --> 00:47:26,030
then I will be releasing potent forces 
of change in him.

862
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:27,323
Well,
so you can imagine like your brain is 

863
00:47:29,441 --> 00:47:32,440
always trying to figure things out.
Well,

864
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:34,510
let's extend that a bit.
It's not just your brain,

865
00:47:34,511 --> 00:47:38,170
it's your cycle physiology.
It's your whole body is trying to figure

866
00:47:38,171 --> 00:47:38,770
things out.

867
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:39,603
Right?
And you can't just think about it as a 

868
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:44,320
logical and mental process,
like your emotions are there.

869
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:47,380
Evaluative processes.
They're trying to give you information,

870
00:47:47,381 --> 00:47:49,750
but they're not very articulate.
You know,

871
00:47:49,751 --> 00:47:52,030
it's like you come home and you're all 
angry and you're touching.

872
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:54,010
Your partner says something that's,
you know,

873
00:47:54,011 --> 00:47:56,860
pretty mundane and you know,
you just explode.

874
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,150
It's like,
well,

875
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,890
they say to you,
why are you like that?

876
00:47:59,891 --> 00:48:00,431
And they say,
well,

877
00:48:00,431 --> 00:48:03,010
I hate it when your boots are in the way
of the door.

878
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:03,971
It's like,
oh,

879
00:48:03,971 --> 00:48:06,550
that's why you're having to fit.
Is it because the Buddhists are.

880
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,810
Well,
they're always there.

881
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:08,843
It's like
you can be sure that there's a big mess 

882
00:48:11,831 --> 00:48:12,664
underneath that and it's going to be 
hard to approach that person because 

883
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:17,620
angry people are also kind of,
you know,

884
00:48:17,621 --> 00:48:19,890
they're kind of,
well,

885
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:20,783
they're irritable for sure,
but they also have this kind of shadow 

886
00:48:22,721 --> 00:48:24,080
on them that is touching.

887
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:26,080
They're touchy.
So you touched them,

888
00:48:26,081 --> 00:48:27,460
you know,
they'll get irritated at you.

889
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:31,120
And so
if you mirror that,

890
00:48:31,121 --> 00:48:32,560
if you're listening to them and watching
them,

891
00:48:32,561 --> 00:48:33,394
then they can start to figure out that 
they're angry and that maybe there are 

892
00:48:35,031 --> 00:48:37,240
two or more angry than the situation 
demands.

893
00:48:37,241 --> 00:48:39,730
And if you listen to them be angry for a
while,

894
00:48:39,731 --> 00:48:40,960
which is very annoying,
right?

895
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:44,050
Because maybe there'll be angry at you.
Then maybe they'll calm down and they'll

896
00:48:44,051 --> 00:48:44,884
start to
differentiate that emotion into 

897
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:50,740
articulated statements.
It's like,

898
00:48:50,741 --> 00:48:52,450
well,
I had a really terrible day at work.

899
00:48:53,350 --> 00:48:54,183
Well what was so terrible about it?
And it'll tell you a little story and 

900
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:57,971
then they'll say,
well,

901
00:48:57,971 --> 00:48:58,804
that's happening all the time,
and then you asked them about that and 

902
00:49:00,911 --> 00:49:01,511
then they say,
well,

903
00:49:01,511 --> 00:49:02,344
my boss is unreasonable in his demands.
And so then you ask them about that and 

904
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:06,363
you find out that the person either has 
a pilot for a loss because sometimes 

905
00:49:10,211 --> 00:49:10,960
that happens,
right?

906
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,460
A real bully,
which when,

907
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,353
and then the answer to why they're mad 
about the shoes is because they should 

908
00:49:15,641 --> 00:49:17,740
change jobs,
right?

909
00:49:17,741 --> 00:49:20,020
Or maybe you'll find out that,
well,

910
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,570
they have no idea how to say no to their
boss.

911
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:25,540
They just say yes,
no matter what he or she says,

912
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:26,583
and that needs for too agreeable.
And then maybe you have to figure out 

913
00:49:28,931 --> 00:49:29,764
how they can learn how to say no and how
they have to sort of check with their 

914
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:35,440
resentment to figure out when they're 
being taken advantage of.

915
00:49:35,441 --> 00:49:36,910
It's like,
it's very,

916
00:49:36,911 --> 00:49:40,690
very complicated and it's no wonder 
people want to avoid it,

917
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:43,570
but you know,
that's another sort of truism.

918
00:49:43,571 --> 00:49:48,130
If someone's overreacting,
well they're not reacting to that thing.

919
00:49:48,131 --> 00:49:51,100
They're reacting to that thing plus a 
whole bunch of things that are unrelated

920
00:49:51,101 --> 00:49:51,934
to that thing sorted and they don't know
what it is and so then if you listen to 

921
00:49:56,321 --> 00:49:57,154
them and they talk about it,
they're actually thinking because what 

922
00:50:00,791 --> 00:50:04,480
you might think when you're talking is 
that you think and then you say what you

923
00:50:04,481 --> 00:50:06,580
think and so you don't have to park.

924
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,710
You could just think,
but that isn't right.

925
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:11,950
Most people don't really think like 
they're not.

926
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:17,890
They don't sit down and meditate and 
think logically through a whole sequence

927
00:50:17,891 --> 00:50:18,724
of problems.
The thought sort of appear in their 

928
00:50:20,261 --> 00:50:21,094
heads,
you know,

929
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:25,600
spontaneously sort of like a reverie,
but they're not really.

930
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:28,880
They're not.
You know,

931
00:50:28,881 --> 00:50:30,980
they don't have that kind of command of 
the language.

932
00:50:31,430 --> 00:50:32,263
And so then when they're talking to you,
they're actually thinking they're 

933
00:50:35,571 --> 00:50:36,404
thinking out loud and for all we know,
maybe thinking is more effective when 

934
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:40,753
you say it out loud because my.
Maybe I'm wired up so that my brain 

935
00:50:44,811 --> 00:50:45,644
assumes that if I'm willing to tell it 
to you to make the troubling that it's 

936
00:50:48,741 --> 00:50:51,560
more true than those things I'd like to 
keep to myself.

937
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:52,813
And so one of the things you're doing in
a psychotherapeutic session is you're 

938
00:50:55,431 --> 00:50:57,110
just letting the person talk

939
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,980
and you know,
I've had clients,

940
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:01,023
they don't want me to do anything for 
the hour that I'm with them except shut 

941
00:51:03,641 --> 00:51:08,620
up and listen and maybe now and then I 
can just clarify something.

942
00:51:08,621 --> 00:51:10,750
I have one client in particular who's 
very isolated,

943
00:51:10,751 --> 00:51:11,584
socially isolated and this person has 
come to see me for a long time and they 

944
00:51:15,431 --> 00:51:16,264
just want this person comes every two 
weeks and what they want to do is talk 

945
00:51:19,391 --> 00:51:22,230
about the last two weeks and they won't 
be listened.

946
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,550
And so I have.
I have to be engaged,

947
00:51:24,551 --> 00:51:25,570
right?
I'm listening.

948
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,270
And,
and that's a communicative process.

949
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:28,961
This snake,
right?

950
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:30,950
Because your face is changing and you're
nodding.

951
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:31,973
You know,
you're reacting so you're in the 

952
00:51:33,161 --> 00:51:33,994
communication,
but this person just wants to talk and 

953
00:51:36,911 --> 00:51:39,190
then they sort themselves out.
You know what?

954
00:51:39,191 --> 00:51:40,024
Figure out what it is they're upset 
about and then that's good and they can 

955
00:51:42,221 --> 00:51:44,800
go off and operate in the world for two 
weeks.

956
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:46,630
That's all just listening.
Well,

957
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:47,493
just listening.
Listening is hard and people aren't 

958
00:51:49,901 --> 00:51:50,830
taught how to do it.

959
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,830
If I can listen to what he can tell me,
if I can understand how it seems to him,

960
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:58,993
if I could sense it's personal,
meaning that I will be releasing potent 

961
00:52:01,401 --> 00:52:02,234
forces of change in him.
If I can really understand how he hates 

962
00:52:06,021 --> 00:52:06,854
his father,
that that could be a conversation that 

963
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,790
go on for months or hates the university
or hates communists.

964
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,030
If I can catch the flavor of the sphere 
of insanity or a sphere of atom bombs or

965
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:19,933
Russia,
you could tell that this is a little 

966
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:21,884
old.
It will be of the greatest help to him 

967
00:52:23,811 --> 00:52:24,644
and altering those very hatreds and 
fears and in establishing realistic and 

968
00:52:27,621 --> 00:52:28,454
harmonious relationships with the very 
people and situations towards which he 

969
00:52:32,061 --> 00:52:34,940
has felt hatred and fear.
So for example,

970
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:38,380
let's say someone comes into a 
therapeutic session,

971
00:52:38,381 --> 00:52:38,961
they say,
Geez,

972
00:52:38,961 --> 00:52:39,794
I just.
I was just having a conversation by for 

973
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:41,870
my father.

974
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:44,360
I just hate my father.
Every time I talked to him,

975
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:47,060
it just makes me angry.
I'm like,

976
00:52:47,061 --> 00:52:50,000
that's all.
That's a low resolution representations,

977
00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:50,863
right?
It's like one pixel farther equals 

978
00:52:52,221 --> 00:52:53,054
anger.
It's not differentiated and that's a 

979
00:52:55,971 --> 00:53:00,590
problem because their body's responding 
as if this person needs to be taken out.

980
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:01,453
Like you might take out a prey object or
something like that or destroy it 

981
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,510
because that's where danger is light,
right?

982
00:53:05,511 --> 00:53:09,260
Anger sort of like you're an object to 
be destroyed and it's.

983
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:10,453
There's truth in that because it 
wouldn't be elicited by the farther 

984
00:53:14,091 --> 00:53:16,580
unless there was something necessity for
the anger,

985
00:53:16,581 --> 00:53:20,360
but it's so generalized global,
it's not helpful.

986
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:21,141
It's like,
okay,

987
00:53:21,141 --> 00:53:23,030
let's talk about your father.
Well,

988
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,410
how would you do that?
Well,

989
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,333
what did he do recently to upset you?
And then you listen and you don't give 

990
00:53:27,781 --> 00:53:28,614
the person advice about what they should
have done because what the hell do you 

991
00:53:30,931 --> 00:53:32,190
know about what they should have done?

992
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:33,243
You might have to listen for 50 hours 
before you could offer a helpful 

993
00:53:36,571 --> 00:53:38,730
suggestion.
Even then it probably won't work.

994
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:41,910
So you listen and then they tell you 
some stories about,

995
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,430
this is almost like the Friday and 
psychoanalytic approach.

996
00:53:44,431 --> 00:53:45,264
They tell you some stories about what 
their father was like when they're in 

997
00:53:46,831 --> 00:53:47,664
their childhood and then a bunch of 
things that pop up in memory and you 

998
00:53:51,451 --> 00:53:52,920
know,
they start laying out the story,

999
00:53:52,921 --> 00:53:53,754
it's like their land cards out on a 
table and they just lay out all these 

1000
00:53:56,221 --> 00:53:57,054
cards.
There's like a thousand cards and 

1001
00:53:58,441 --> 00:54:00,330
they're all representations of the 
father.

1002
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:03,030
And then they started to exhaust 
themselves.

1003
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:05,400
They're out of angry stories about their
father.

1004
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:06,840
And then maybe they say,
well,

1005
00:54:06,841 --> 00:54:09,780
you know,
there wasn't all bad.

1006
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:13,320
Then they started laying out some things
about him that,

1007
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:15,300
you know,
he drank all the time,

1008
00:54:15,301 --> 00:54:15,960
but he was really.

1009
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,800
He always took care of us and he wasn't,
he wasn't an angry drunk,

1010
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,400
you know,
and,

1011
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,490
and he stayed with my mother and you 
know,

1012
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:27,930
so what's happening now is the picture 
of the father's getting differentiated,

1013
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:30,690
right?
It's not just one pixel,

1014
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:33,030
it's differentiated.
And then you might say,

1015
00:54:33,031 --> 00:54:34,560
well,
okay,

1016
00:54:34,561 --> 00:54:37,800
here's all these angry things.
How many of them are still relevant?

1017
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:41,130
Like how many of those do you have to 
deal with and the person will say think,

1018
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:42,230
well these,
you know,

1019
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:47,960
80 percent of these anger things or dad 
there in the past and you know,

1020
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,493
70 percent of these good things weren't 
good enough to make up for the rest of 

1021
00:54:52,801 --> 00:54:53,634
this mess,
but then you get a smaller pile of 

1022
00:54:55,051 --> 00:54:55,884
specific things and then maybe you can 
start figuring out ways that or the 

1023
00:54:59,191 --> 00:55:00,024
person can start figuring out ways that 
those might be addressed moment to 

1024
00:55:02,251 --> 00:55:05,580
moment in new conversations like it's a 
strategic plan.

1025
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:09,720
What's the situation?
What exactly is going on here?

1026
00:55:09,721 --> 00:55:10,554
Lay it out and the emotions are a great 
guide to that because the first thing 

1027
00:55:13,861 --> 00:55:16,980
you want to do is everything that makes 
you emotional.

1028
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,460
Those are the things that aren't dealt 
with yet.

1029
00:55:20,461 --> 00:55:23,520
They're not fully articulated.
You don't have a strategy.

1030
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:25,710
You don't have a full develop 
representational system.

1031
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:28,970
That's why it's still emotional,
so it's like your,

1032
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:33,330
your body and your mind come up with 
emotional representations first and only

1033
00:55:33,331 --> 00:55:34,164
as you worked through them,
which means to talk about them 

1034
00:55:36,361 --> 00:55:37,194
essentially strategically.
They don't even turn into words until 

1035
00:55:39,781 --> 00:55:40,614
you do that,
and that's where I think Freud went 

1036
00:55:42,361 --> 00:55:43,980
wrong.
It's those things aren't repressed.

1037
00:55:43,981 --> 00:55:46,230
Although if they can be,
they're not repressed.

1038
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:47,243
They just never made it all the way up 
to articulated representation and lots 

1039
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:53,970
of things are like that.
Whenever you're in a bad mood,

1040
00:55:53,971 --> 00:55:55,380
it's like,
I'm in a bad mood.

1041
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:58,200
What does that mean?
Well,

1042
00:55:58,201 --> 00:56:00,750
you don't know.
Why don't you know,

1043
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:02,620
or you repressing it.
No,

1044
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:03,463
you just too stupid to figure it out,
and so then you're going to talk to 

1045
00:56:06,061 --> 00:56:08,280
someone you know I'm in a bad mood and 
you know,

1046
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:09,480
well,
you know,

1047
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:10,493
how are you feeling now?
They'll get all spiteful and tell you 

1048
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:15,780
how they're feeling and then you know,
they start to differentiate it.

1049
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:16,643
Maybe they'll remember something that 
happened at work and then you can kind 

1050
00:56:18,931 --> 00:56:21,780
of map out the mood starts to loosen it.

1051
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:28,720
We know from our research that such 
empathic understanding,

1052
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:30,003
understanding with a person,
knowing about him is such an effective 

1053
00:56:33,011 --> 00:56:35,650
approach that it can bring about major 
changes in personality.

1054
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:36,633
Some of you may be feeling that you 
listen well to people and that you have 

1055
00:56:40,091 --> 00:56:40,924
never seen such results.
The chances are very great indeed that 

1056
00:56:44,681 --> 00:56:47,740
you're listening has not been of the 
type I have described.

1057
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,313
Fortunately,
I can suggest a little laboratory 

1058
00:56:51,671 --> 00:56:55,090
experiment which you can try to test the
quality of your understanding.

1059
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:57,070
Okay,
so this is.

1060
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:00,860
This is lovely because you don't often 
actually get it.

1061
00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:03,910
Tell me from a therapist that actually 
work,

1062
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:04,923
you know,
you get sort of vague techniques like 

1063
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:10,060
help the person lay the cards out on the
table.

1064
00:57:10,061 --> 00:57:11,060
You know,
it's,

1065
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,870
it's kind of at a high level of 
abstraction,

1066
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:19,440
but this exercise you can actually do 
and you can do it a lot and if you do it

1067
00:57:19,441 --> 00:57:20,590
and we'll teach you,
listen.

1068
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,273
So

1069
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:27,010
the next time you get into an argument 
with your wife or your friends or with a

1070
00:57:27,011 --> 00:57:27,844
small group of friends,
start the discussion for a moment and 

1071
00:57:29,951 --> 00:57:30,784
for an experiment institute this rule,
while you also don't have to be that 

1072
00:57:33,341 --> 00:57:34,930
formal about it,
you can just do it.

1073
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:35,883
Once you know the the team,
each person can speak up for himself 

1074
00:57:40,391 --> 00:57:41,224
only after he is first restated the 
ideas and feelings of the previous 

1075
00:57:46,091 --> 00:57:51,091
speaker accurately
and to that speaker satisfaction.

1076
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:53,013
Now,
that's so cool because here's the 

1077
00:57:54,371 --> 00:57:56,440
typical argument,
so we're arguing,

1078
00:57:56,441 --> 00:57:57,274
I want to win,
and so you're telling me a bunch of 

1079
00:57:58,211 --> 00:57:59,044
things,
and so then I take those things that I 

1080
00:58:00,611 --> 00:58:04,480
turned them into the stupidest possible 
representation of those things.

1081
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:05,543
You know I wake in your argument and 
make you look like a fool and then 

1082
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,753
destroy it and that's a strong.
That's fine that you're making your 

1083
00:58:12,791 --> 00:58:14,350
opponent into a straw man Max.

1084
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:15,850
The Straw man argument,
right?

1085
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:17,013
You take,
you take what they're telling you and 

1086
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:18,833
your caricatured and that way you can 
make them look absurd and make them be 

1087
00:58:22,361 --> 00:58:23,194
ashamed.
And then of course you've set up this 

1088
00:58:24,651 --> 00:58:27,760
skinny little opponent that you can just
demolish with one punch.

1089
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:32,560
It's really crooked and it shows that 
you're a coward because what it means is

1090
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:33,453
you have to have an opponent that's 
crippled in and thin and starving and 

1091
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:40,990
and inarticulate before you could 
possibly win,

1092
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:42,723
before you could possibly progress.
It's a pathetic way of having an 

1093
00:58:44,741 --> 00:58:45,574
argument.
What you should do is listen to the 

1094
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:47,314
person and help them make their argument
as strong as you possibly can and then 

1095
00:58:51,431 --> 00:58:54,400
deal with that because then you're sure 
that you're,

1096
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,810
you're taking them seriously.

1097
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:57,393
So,

1098
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:02,450
and to that speaker satisfaction.
Well,

1099
00:59:02,451 --> 00:59:03,271
that's so cool.
Okay,

1100
00:59:03,271 --> 00:59:04,880
so we're,
we're having an argument.

1101
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:05,391
Well,
I don't know.

1102
00:59:05,391 --> 00:59:06,224
Maybe we'll have an argument about who's
gonna be responsible for grocery 

1103
00:59:09,261 --> 00:59:10,094
shopping or for doing the dishes or for 
cooking or any of those domestic things 

1104
00:59:13,191 --> 00:59:17,570
that continually caused couples to be at
each other's throat.

1105
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:19,003
It's like,
so you'll have some arguments about you 

1106
00:59:21,351 --> 00:59:22,184
should do whatever it is that you're 
going to do and in order for the 

1107
00:59:24,981 --> 00:59:25,814
argument to progress,
I have to tell you back what you said 

1108
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:30,770
and you have to agree that I put it 
properly.

1109
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:32,360
Well,
that's so annoying.

1110
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:33,523
Like it just runs so contrary to what 
you want to do because of course you 

1111
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:39,860
want to make another person sounds 
stupid so you could meet them this way.

1112
00:59:39,861 --> 00:59:40,694
You can't do that because you have to 
listen well enough so you actually 

1113
00:59:42,501 --> 00:59:47,030
understood what they said and then you 
have to formulate their argument so that

1114
00:59:47,031 --> 00:59:50,150
they're willing to agree that that 
actually constitutes their argument.

1115
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:52,790
Well,
that's really,

1116
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,760
it's difficult,
but it's so useful because first of all,

1117
00:59:55,761 --> 01:00:00,761
it does mean that you understood them 
and second immediately indicates to them

1118
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:03,403
that you're not just trying to,
when you're trying to listen and then 

1119
01:00:07,131 --> 01:00:07,964
they're much less likely to get all 
irritable and angry at you because at 

1120
01:00:10,851 --> 01:00:14,150
least you're trying to listen.
You're not making them into a fool.

1121
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,153
And you know often when people are 
trying to tell you what they want 

1122
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:19,970
because they're all afraid of telling 
you what they want because you know,

1123
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,610
maybe they never got what they wanted in
their whole life.

1124
01:00:22,611 --> 01:00:23,444
You know,
if they've had a history of bad 

1125
01:00:24,171 --> 01:00:26,840
relationships with poor parenting and 
that sort of thing,

1126
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:27,883
you're just blooded terrified to tell 
you that they actually want something 

1127
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:31,903
and so as soon as you indicate to them 
that you actually heard what they said 

1128
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:38,840
and you're willing to take it seriously 
enough to formulate it properly,

1129
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,510
well then it's like one step towards 
trust.

1130
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:45,020
I see you didn't listen.
You at least know where I'm coming from.

1131
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:47,060
It's like,
that doesn't mean you agree.

1132
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:48,043
You know,
just because you understand someone's 

1133
01:00:49,311 --> 01:00:50,144
argument doesn't mean you have to agree,
but at least you know what the argument 

1134
01:00:52,581 --> 01:00:55,670
is.
You see what this would mean.

1135
01:00:55,671 --> 01:00:56,504
So one of the things,
Roger's got us continually his therapy 

1136
01:00:58,281 --> 01:00:59,114
and I do this a lot.
It's like I listen to the person and 

1137
01:01:01,131 --> 01:01:03,980
they kind of go through a narrative at 
spontaneous narrative,

1138
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:07,760
often following a chain of associations 
as pointed out,

1139
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:09,980
you'll come you spontaneous narrative 
and I'll say,

1140
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,113
okay,
it sounds to me like this is what you 

1141
01:01:12,591 --> 01:01:15,890
said,
and I'll try to lay out the argument and

1142
01:01:15,891 --> 01:01:16,724
maybe now and then I'll,
I'll ask for clarification if there's a 

1143
01:01:18,831 --> 01:01:19,664
part I didn't understand or if I see 
that there's a part that seems 

1144
01:01:22,401 --> 01:01:23,530
contradictory,
you know,

1145
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:25,880
they said this thing here,
this thing there,

1146
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,310
and I don't tell them that,
you know,

1147
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:30,310
seems to me that you said this here and 
this here.

1148
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:32,720
I'm not sure how to put those together.
I don't say,

1149
01:01:32,721 --> 01:01:34,130
well,
that makes your argument,

1150
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,600
you know,
incoherent.

1151
01:01:35,601 --> 01:01:36,434
I say,
well,

1152
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:39,600
I don't get how to understand that.
And they go,

1153
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,360
oh yeah,
there is.

1154
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:45,340
Because people will admit to that if you
just pointed out flatly.

1155
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,300
No.
It's like,

1156
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:48,320
I'm not involved.
I'm just listening.

1157
01:01:48,410 --> 01:01:51,230
It's not my problem.
It's a problem.

1158
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:56,150
And that's another thing that's useful 
to the other person is entitled to their

1159
01:01:56,151 --> 01:01:58,940
suffering.
You don't get to take it away.

1160
01:01:58,970 --> 01:01:59,803
It's their destiny so you can listen to 
their problems without having to think 

1161
01:02:03,051 --> 01:02:07,100
that you know you have to take them on 
as if they're yours.

1162
01:02:07,101 --> 01:02:09,620
You have to mirror them like it's their 
problem.

1163
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:11,930
It's like they have to figure it out and
they and that's good.

1164
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:13,093
You need a problem to figure out.
It's not necessarily a terrible thing 

1165
01:02:15,561 --> 01:02:16,520
that they have a problem.

1166
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,660
It would simply mean that before 
presenting your own point of view,

1167
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,033
it would be necessary for you to really 
achieve the other speakers frame of 

1168
01:02:25,831 --> 01:02:30,270
reference to understand his thoughts and
feeling so well that you could summarize

1169
01:02:30,271 --> 01:02:31,104
them for him.
And that's useful too because you know 

1170
01:02:33,121 --> 01:02:33,954
the way we remember things is if you 
tell me a long story and I tell it back 

1171
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:40,920
to you,
I do not tell it back to you.

1172
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:47,340
What happens is I listened to it and I 
try to figure out what the thread of the

1173
01:02:47,341 --> 01:02:50,940
argument is and then when I dial it back
to you,

1174
01:02:50,941 --> 01:02:54,960
it's way shorter and tighter and that 
means in some sense it's,

1175
01:02:55,820 --> 01:02:58,920
it's got all the essentials,
but it's got less of the baggage.

1176
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:00,503
Right?
That's what you're kind of doing when 

1177
01:03:00,991 --> 01:03:03,810
you ask someone to get to the point,
so they tell you this long story,

1178
01:03:03,811 --> 01:03:04,644
it's like this tree that is full of dead
branches and it hasn't been proved and 

1179
01:03:09,330 --> 01:03:10,163
they're extending their and you know,
the maybe the living branches you can 

1180
01:03:12,721 --> 01:03:13,554
hardly even see,
but you're concentrating on them and 

1181
01:03:15,151 --> 01:03:18,060
then when you tell it back to them,
you just tell them the part of the story

1182
01:03:18,061 --> 01:03:20,250
that's alive and they listened to that 
and they think,

1183
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,480
Oh yes,
that's what I meant,

1184
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:25,020
and then that means you've changed the 
memory,

1185
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:25,800
right?

1186
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,330
If they have,
you've changed the memory,

1187
01:03:27,331 --> 01:03:28,164
you've,
you've divested of all the excess 

1188
01:03:29,851 --> 01:03:32,520
baggage,
just like pruning and that's what you're

1189
01:03:32,521 --> 01:03:35,970
doing.
And so that a dialogue is mental hygiene

1190
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:38,180
and that's what people do.
You know,

1191
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:38,881
you've got to wonder,
well,

1192
01:03:38,881 --> 01:03:40,650
why don't we talk?
Well,

1193
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:42,810
it's to exchange information.
Yeah,

1194
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:44,490
there's utility in it.
You know,

1195
01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:46,110
like if you know how to do something and
I don't,

1196
01:03:46,111 --> 01:03:48,830
you can tell me,
but that,

1197
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,420
that isn't the sort of thing that people
are doing most of the time.

1198
01:03:51,421 --> 01:03:53,280
Most of the time they're telling their 
stories,

1199
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:56,630
this is what happened to me right in 
there,

1200
01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:58,170
and then not a person will say,
well,

1201
01:03:58,171 --> 01:03:59,004
this is what happened to me,
and there's this mutual attempt to 

1202
01:04:02,101 --> 01:04:02,934
organize.
That's how people are organizing their 

1203
01:04:04,411 --> 01:04:07,020
brains.
We organized our brains by talking,

1204
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:09,780
and so if you don't have someone to 
listen to you,

1205
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:13,080
well,
especially if it's over a few decades,

1206
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:17,160
you're going to have a brain that's like
a whole forest of trees that it needs.

1207
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:19,610
A forest fire doesn't need just some,
you know,

1208
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:24,150
trim and it's really in trouble.
So you need to have someone to listen to

1209
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:24,984
you and best way to hit someone like 
that is to find a bunch of people and 

1210
01:04:28,261 --> 01:04:32,220
listen to them because you know,
of course then now that's a friendship.

1211
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:33,630
That's a real friendship,
you know,

1212
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:36,180
because you're both trying to move 
towards a better place.

1213
01:04:36,181 --> 01:04:39,180
Whatever that place is,
and it's a great relationship.

1214
01:04:39,181 --> 01:04:41,790
Then sounds simple,
doesn't it?

1215
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:44,393
But if you try it,
you'll discover it's one of the most 

1216
01:04:45,541 --> 01:04:47,280
difficult things you've ever tried to 
do.

1217
01:04:50,650 --> 01:04:51,483
However,
once you've been able to see the other 

1218
01:04:52,511 --> 01:04:53,344
person's point of view,
your own comments will have to be 

1219
01:04:55,001 --> 01:04:56,740
drastically revised.
Well,

1220
01:04:56,741 --> 01:05:01,060
that's partly because now there are sort
of vague complaints is tightened up to a

1221
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:01,893
specific problem.
Then you have to reconfigure how you're 

1222
01:05:03,671 --> 01:05:04,504
responding to address that problem.
You also find the emotion going on with 

1223
01:05:07,931 --> 01:05:08,764
the discussion,
the differences being reduced and those 

1224
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:15,370
differences which remain being on a 
rational and understandable sort.

1225
01:05:18,730 --> 01:05:21,760
If you were really willing to understand
a person in this way,

1226
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:22,743
if you're willing to answer their 
private world and see the like the way 

1227
01:05:25,601 --> 01:05:26,434
their life appears to them,
you run the risk of being changed 

1228
01:05:28,541 --> 01:05:30,020
yourself,
which is good.

1229
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:30,933
That's a good thing.
If you're involved in a real 

1230
01:05:33,671 --> 01:05:34,504
conversation,
the way that you will change will be 

1231
01:05:36,521 --> 01:05:37,760
beneficial to you,
but it's.

1232
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:39,970
But it's,
it's a challenging thing because it will

1233
01:05:39,971 --> 01:05:43,690
mean that you can't stick to the little,
you know,

1234
01:05:43,691 --> 01:05:46,690
rigid framework that you had entering 
into the argument.

1235
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:49,930
You have to loosen that up and be 
willing to open the door and you know,

1236
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:51,730
change the walls of your house.

1237
01:05:55,530 --> 01:05:57,900
You might see it his way.
That wouldn't be good.

1238
01:05:58,110 --> 01:06:01,560
You might find yourself influenced or 
you're in your attitudes or personality.

1239
01:06:02,610 --> 01:06:03,443
The risk of being changed is one of the 
most frightening prospects most of us 

1240
01:06:05,911 --> 01:06:07,530
can face.
Well,

1241
01:06:07,531 --> 01:06:11,640
imagine so when you're trying to build 
yourself into high fully fledged you.

1242
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:13,260
Well,
here's one way of doing it.

1243
01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:14,183
Just hang around with people like you 
who think the same way you do and then 

1244
01:06:17,821 --> 01:06:20,340
whenever you talk they just reflect back
what you have to say.

1245
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:21,353
Or you can start putting yourself in 
situations that you're uncomfortable 

1246
01:06:23,731 --> 01:06:24,840
with,
you know,

1247
01:06:25,650 --> 01:06:26,483
pushing yourself a little bit and you go
out where there are people that aren't 

1248
01:06:28,291 --> 01:06:31,320
like you and then you think,
well,

1249
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,810
how am I going to get to understand 
these people?

1250
01:06:33,811 --> 01:06:34,644
And the first thing you do is you got to
pay attention and you got to listen and 

1251
01:06:36,751 --> 01:06:39,440
then maybe you'll be able to interact 
with them and then who.

1252
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:40,493
That's another environment that you've 
mastered and then there's more of you 

1253
01:06:44,430 --> 01:06:46,170
because now you can operate here and 
here.

1254
01:06:46,171 --> 01:06:48,060
And then maybe you think,
well that was kind of fun.

1255
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:48,953
So now I'll go here and we'll try this,
and you go there and you listened and 

1256
01:06:51,721 --> 01:06:53,850
you pay attention and all of a sudden 
bang,

1257
01:06:53,970 --> 01:06:58,440
you can operate there and if you do that
over like a 15 year period,

1258
01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:03,360
you'll be someone who could go anywhere 
and not fit in exactly that.

1259
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,490
That's like you're invisible.
It's not like you're fitting.

1260
01:07:05,491 --> 01:07:07,470
Yes.
It's like you can operate there,

1261
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:10,560
you can talk and listen.
You can gather information,

1262
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:11,453
you can trade your useful there and then
you're not gonna run up against people 

1263
01:07:16,681 --> 01:07:17,610
and you know,
risk,

1264
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:21,000
unnecessary conflict.
Because if you listen to people,

1265
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:23,910
you just cannot believe what people will
tell you if you listen to them.

1266
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:25,740
It is absolutely.
And you can.

1267
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:26,723
If you can listen to people,
they will tell you profound things so 

1268
01:07:29,611 --> 01:07:32,720
fast that it just makes your head spin.
You know,

1269
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:34,680
because people are really weird 
creatures.

1270
01:07:34,681 --> 01:07:36,430
They're like Dostoyevsky characters 
there.

1271
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:37,713
There are peculiar.
They think in weird ways and they have 

1272
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:40,764
weird experiences and bizarre dreams and
ideas about the future political 

1273
01:07:45,571 --> 01:07:46,404
theories.
They're just as crazy as you could 

1274
01:07:48,391 --> 01:07:50,250
possibly imagine.
And if you listen to them,

1275
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:52,660
they'll tell you why they think these 
things and it's.

1276
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:54,323
It's not boring.
That's another issue is if the 

1277
01:07:56,341 --> 01:07:57,174
conversation is boring,
you are not listening because if you're 

1278
01:08:00,511 --> 01:08:01,344
listening,
the conversation will change so that it 

1279
01:08:03,211 --> 01:08:04,044
won't be boring.
So you can tell if you're in a 

1280
01:08:04,891 --> 01:08:09,891
conversation that's foreign,
you're someone at least is not listening

1281
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,233
and it could easily be you.
If I enter as fully as I enabled into 

1282
01:08:15,441 --> 01:08:18,740
the private world of the neurotic or 
psychotic individual,

1283
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,830
isn't there a risk that I might become 
lost in that world?

1284
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:27,650
Most of us are afraid to take that risk.
The great majority of us cannot listen.

1285
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:31,880
We found ourselves,
we find ourselves compelled to evaluate,

1286
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:34,760
and the evaluation is,
I'm going to keep you away.

1287
01:08:34,790 --> 01:08:38,000
I'm going to pigeonhole you,
classify you.

1288
01:08:38,270 --> 01:08:39,103
Make the classification negative.
Describe you as irrelevant and push you 

1289
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:45,170
aside because then I don't have to pay 
attention.

1290
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:49,490
I don't have to listen and I can stay in
my box of certainty,

1291
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:51,410
my little narrow box of certainty.

1292
01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:54,523
The great majority of us cannot listen.
We find ourselves to pell to evaluate 

1293
01:08:57,231 --> 01:08:58,064
because listening is too dangerous.
The first requirement is courage and we 

1294
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:02,420
do not always have it.

1295
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:11,800
Okay.
So Carl Rogers,

1296
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:14,733
he's a phenomenologist.
So think it's your experience that's 

1297
01:09:18,311 --> 01:09:19,144
real.
You need to represent that experience 

1298
01:09:21,850 --> 01:09:22,683
and you need to communicate it to other 
people and you have to communicate it 

1299
01:09:25,211 --> 01:09:26,044
within a frame.
And the proper frame is we're trying to 

1300
01:09:28,151 --> 01:09:32,070
make things better here and you know,
in order to adopt that frame,

1301
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,480
that's not just a simple statement,
right?

1302
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:35,703
I mean you can tell yourself that,
try to put yourself in that state of 

1303
01:09:38,261 --> 01:09:39,094
mind.
But to do that you have to really think 

1304
01:09:40,631 --> 01:09:43,240
through your heart.
You have to decide like,

1305
01:09:43,450 --> 01:09:47,380
what are you up to?
Are you here to make things worse or are

1306
01:09:47,381 --> 01:09:49,810
you here to make things better?
And you know,

1307
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:50,644
you might say,
well clearly I'm here to make things 

1308
01:09:51,731 --> 01:09:52,564
better.
It's like,

1309
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,190
yeah,
sure,

1310
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:55,593
no,
that's hard and people are full of 

1311
01:09:57,821 --> 01:09:58,654
resentment and fear and anger and they'd
be hurt and all sorts of ways that they 

1312
01:10:02,081 --> 01:10:05,860
want to take revenge and like they're 
just full of contradictory impulses.

1313
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:06,993
And so to weave all those contradictory 
impulses together to overcome all those 

1314
01:10:12,131 --> 01:10:16,180
hurts and disappointments in and reasons
for revenge and resentment,

1315
01:10:17,310 --> 01:10:19,120
you have to do all that before you can 
say,

1316
01:10:19,121 --> 01:10:21,220
well,
I'm here to make things better.

1317
01:10:21,370 --> 01:10:22,203
Because if you're still possessed by 
those sorts of experiences and 

1318
01:10:24,251 --> 01:10:25,084
contradictions,
you're going to be motivated to make 

1319
01:10:26,591 --> 01:10:27,424
things worse all the time,
just out of revenge and spite you know 

1320
01:10:30,281 --> 01:10:31,240
you.
You've been hurt,

1321
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:34,450
you're going to hurt,
and so do adopt.

1322
01:10:34,451 --> 01:10:35,284
The framework that Rogers is talking 
about is it's difficult enterprise and 

1323
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:42,910
partly it'll come about the more you 
listen because the more you listen,

1324
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:45,280
you have the chance to exchange 
information,

1325
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:46,533
the more you will deal with those inner 
contradictions in that sort of 

1326
01:10:48,341 --> 01:10:50,840
collection of hurts and irritations 
that,

1327
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:53,800
that are corrupting you in twisted you 
in the wrong direction.

1328
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:06,480
So the rigid perspective is extremely 
useful.

1329
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:07,613
It's very useful.
The reason I concentrated on that one 

1330
01:11:09,661 --> 01:11:12,330
quote of his today is because it's such 
a useful thing,

1331
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:15,540
you can try right away the next time 
you're talking to someone,

1332
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:18,150
maybe have a friend who wants to talk 
things over.

1333
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:21,270
It's like listen to them and then when 
there's a pause say,

1334
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,193
well,
it sounds to me like this is what you 

1335
01:11:23,221 --> 01:11:24,660
meant,
and they'll go,

1336
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:26,750
yes,
that's exactly what I meant.

1337
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:29,400
Maybe if you were really listening,
they'll be real happy about that because

1338
01:11:29,401 --> 01:11:32,340
they didn't know what they meant.
They're just telling you the story about

1339
01:11:32,341 --> 01:11:35,150
why they're annoying and so then you'll 
think,

1340
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:36,360
oh wow,
I got it,

1341
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:39,210
and then there'll be happy and they'll 
tell you something else and like they'll

1342
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:43,440
walk away from that conversation much 
lighter and you will too.

1343
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,470
Even though it's a weird thing because 
you might think,

1344
01:11:46,471 --> 01:11:47,304
well if you listen,
people are going to dump a bunch of 

1345
01:11:48,241 --> 01:11:49,074
trouble on you.

1346
01:11:49,530 --> 01:11:51,660
It's like,
well,

1347
01:11:51,661 --> 01:11:52,494
yes,
but if you're willing to listen despite 

1348
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,430
the fact that there might be a bunch of 
trouble dumped on you,

1349
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:00,473
then you've also pulled yourself that 
you're the sort of person who can 

1350
01:12:03,121 --> 01:12:07,140
tolerate having a bunch of trouble 
dumped on yourself and that's like,

1351
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:11,820
that's.
That's an extremely positive attitude to

1352
01:12:11,821 --> 01:12:14,320
take towards yourself.
You don't want.

1353
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:16,110
You're not just saying you're acting it 
out,

1354
01:12:16,111 --> 01:12:19,020
and so that's a sign of faith in 
yourself and you're not.

1355
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:20,333
Well.
I said you were stupid like you are in 

1356
01:12:21,391 --> 01:12:23,640
relationships,
but you're not totally stupid.

1357
01:12:23,870 --> 01:12:26,420
You know,
you'll be able to notice that you,

1358
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:27,393
you,
you've been willing to expose yourself 

1359
01:12:28,951 --> 01:12:33,210
to a risk and when your body and your 
mind you're watching that,

1360
01:12:33,211 --> 01:12:34,440
they'll think,
oh,

1361
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:38,370
I'm the sort of thing that can 
voluntarily expose itself to a risk.

1362
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:39,623
Well,
that's like the secrets to making 

1363
01:12:40,591 --> 01:12:41,610
yourself strong.

1364
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:46,680
It's exposure and so you can do that in 
every conversation and that toughens you

1365
01:12:46,681 --> 01:12:50,280
up as well as informing you.
It's a very powerful technique,

1366
01:12:50,281 --> 01:12:52,920
so I would recommend try it,
see what happens.

1367
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:54,053
It's really,
it's also fun because it's like you're 

1368
01:12:56,131 --> 01:12:56,964
following a thread of the conversation.
If you're really listening to the 

1369
01:12:59,221 --> 01:13:00,054
conversation will continue and it 
continues in a meaningful way and then 

1370
01:13:03,631 --> 01:13:04,464
you know that you're in the right place 
and it's like a challenge to your 

1371
01:13:06,661 --> 01:13:10,440
capacity to pay attention and then you 
get engaged in the convert.

1372
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:11,303
All conversations.
You get engaged in them and then you're 

1373
01:13:13,801 --> 01:13:17,130
in engaging conversations all the time.
That's a good thing,

1374
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:19,230
so.
Okay,

1375
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:20,093
we'll see you.
