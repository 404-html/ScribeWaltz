1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,510
Hi,
so this is the second part of my

2
00:00:03,511 --> 00:00:06,090
proposed three part series on political
correctness.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:11,430
Looks like I'll probably expand that,
but this one deals with the Department

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,100
of human resources policy to make anti
racism and anti bias training mandatory

5
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:20,610
among human resources staff at the
University of Toronto.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,060
And I wanted to explain a couple of
things to you in relationship to that

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,030
mostly why I think it's extremely ill
advised policy,

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,860
but also I'm a little bit more about
political correctness and general and

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,060
also about why you should care about
this even though it doesn't directly

10
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:38,610
affect you or at least in principle,
it doesn't directly affect you.

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,310
So the first thing I would say is,
uh,

12
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,390
in order to talk about,
or any more about political correctness,

13
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,140
I guess I probably have to justify my
belief that such a thing exists.

14
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:51,630
And I can tell you have already done
some empirical research on that.

15
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:52,980
We,
we,

16
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,760
we did this psychometrically which is
psychometrics is the science of

17
00:00:56,761 --> 00:00:58,490
psychological measurement.
And so we,

18
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,790
we took an agnostic view to begin with
and,

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,340
and the question was,
well,

20
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:06,550
are there a set of political beliefs
that aggregate together so that they can

21
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:10,050
be described using a single term such as
political correctness?

22
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,540
What are the personality and other
predictors of those beliefs and do,

23
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,170
how do they associate with other
classical forms of political belief like

24
00:01:18,171 --> 00:01:21,570
liberalism and conservatism?
Because the Conservatives often assume

25
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:25,290
that a political correctness is a
extreme form of liberalism.

26
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:27,270
So we're also interested in whether or
not that was true.

27
00:01:27,271 --> 00:01:29,940
And so basically what we found was
first,

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,100
yes,
that there are beliefs that aggregate

29
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:34,860
together coherently in a manner that
would,

30
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,650
uh,
make it reasonable to bring them under a

31
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:39,660
single,
bring them under the umbrella of a

32
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:40,494
single term.

33
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,980
There's actually two dimensions that
seem to be associated with political

34
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:46,320
correctness and one is radical
egalitarianism.

35
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,000
And the other is,
um,

36
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,150
uh,
I would say it's kind of left wing

37
00:01:51,151 --> 00:01:53,700
authoritarianism.
It's the desire to use censorship and

38
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:55,920
language control to,
to read,

39
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:56,783
to,
um,

40
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,460
to obtain certain kinds of political
lands.

41
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,040
Um,
we also found out that the fundamental

42
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:05,820
personality trait that predicts a
adherence to such belief is trait

43
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:08,700
agreeableness,
and that does differentiate political

44
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:12,180
correctness from liberalism say because
the fundamental traits that seem to be

45
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:15,120
associated with liberalism,
the opposite ones that are associated

46
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:17,430
with conservatives and liberals are
higher in trait,

47
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:20,280
openness and lower in trait
conscientiousness.

48
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,010
And I'm all,
I'm speaking of traits in a big five

49
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,460
manner and there are five cardinal
personality traits.

50
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:29,160
There's lots of information about that
on my website if you're interested in

51
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:32,370
that.
But the personality predictors of

52
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,570
political correct belief are not the
same as the personality predictors of,

53
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,700
um,
liberal belief or at least their

54
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:41,520
substantive difference.
So anyways,

55
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:43,590
there is such a thing as political
correctness from a,

56
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,170
from a technical perspective.
So it's perfectly reasonable to talk

57
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:48,330
about it and it's not merely an
invention of the,

58
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,830
of the,
uh,

59
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,020
you know,
a politically motivated invention of the

60
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:54,000
enemies of such,
of such doctrines.

61
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,030
So not as far as I can tell anyway.
So we will eventually publish that.

62
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,860
Next thing question is,
well,

63
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,140
why should you care about what's
happening at the University of Toronto

64
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,610
Human Resources Department?
And I think there's a number of reasons

65
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:08,620
for this and the first is that it's,
um,

66
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,660
it offers a real world case study and
that's really important because you want

67
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:16,810
to talk about something like political
correctness and what might be done about

68
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:19,390
it at the level of high resolution and
high detail.

69
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:23,320
And so imagine if something's gone wrong
with the military military helicopter,

70
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:26,740
which is a very complicated device.
You don't want a four year olds drawing

71
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:29,500
of a military helicopter as a guide to
how to fix it.

72
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,580
You want a detailed schematic.
And the thing about real world case

73
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:36,610
studies is they give you detailed
schematics and so we're going to take

74
00:03:36,611 --> 00:03:39,010
this particular occurrence apart very
carefully.

75
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,600
I'm going to describe to you what I
think it's significance is and what the

76
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:48,020
errors are in the conceptualizing
conceptualization underlying the policy.

77
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,410
And so we're gonna walk through it very
carefully.

78
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,620
The other thing I would say is that,
um,

79
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,620
hr departments are doing this sort of
thing in many organizations.

80
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,920
In many organizations it's the HR
department,

81
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:02,770
that's the vanguard of political
correctness and that's in private and

82
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:05,750
public organizations is a,
uh,

83
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,880
like,
um,

84
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,260
and,
and that it's not.

85
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:10,890
This is not something that by any means,
this is limited to universities.

86
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,400
And so I would also like to say that you
might want to write this off by saying,

87
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:19,000
well the university is a bubble and the
things that happen there have no bearing

88
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:21,220
on the rest of society.
And that's a really foolish thing to

89
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:25,150
think because the university trade
trains the leaders of tomorrow.

90
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:28,630
I know that sounds like a cliche,
but I mean it technically the smart kids

91
00:04:28,631 --> 00:04:31,780
that are in university right now are the
kids that in 15 years they're gonna be

92
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:32,500
running the world.

93
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,770
And so what's happening in the
universities is an indication of the

94
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:37,990
shape of things to come.
And so,

95
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:41,740
and I think the universities are in
large part responsible for the wave of

96
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:45,040
political correctness that has rolled
across north America and,

97
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:45,810
and,
and,

98
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,710
and,
and much of Europe as well.

99
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,280
And I think,
but I'll talk about all that at a

100
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:53,020
different time.
But I want,

101
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,080
I just want to say,
to begin with is don't be thinking that

102
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:59,530
the universities are isolated from,
from the real world because they're not,

103
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,510
they're not isolated from the world at
all.

104
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,000
So.
And they're not nearly as much of a

105
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:05,410
bubble as you might think.
So.

106
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,710
All right,
so here we're going to go to the memo

107
00:05:08,711 --> 00:05:12,670
first.
So this memo was sent out to all the HR

108
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:16,060
staff at the University of Toronto on
September Twenty Six,

109
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:19,750
2016.
And it was sent out by Angela Hildegard

110
00:05:19,751 --> 00:05:22,960
who's the vice president,
human resources and equity.

111
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,090
Okay.
And so here's,

112
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,590
here's the,
here's the content,

113
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,120
dear colleagues.
Next month we will be providing

114
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:36,040
mandatory antidiscrimination and
anti-biased training for all staff in

115
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:40,030
the division of human resources and
equity and the hrl divisional offices

116
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,900
motivated by conversations that have
taken place over the past year with the

117
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:48,130
black liberation collective and
racialized staff members of our

118
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:50,560
community.
This training is intended to build and

119
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:54,280
reinforce the work already occurring
throughout the organization and within

120
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:57,290
human resources.
Recognizing that there is for

121
00:05:57,291 --> 00:06:01,430
improvement to embed common
understandings and evidence based best

122
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:05,630
practice within our work.
The training will be co presented by

123
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,850
Tina Turner.
I hope I have that right.

124
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,280
Principal at Turner Consulting Group and
Merlin,

125
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:13,070
Charles Concurrent Teacher Education
Program,

126
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,950
Ontario Institute for Studies of
Education.

127
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:18,470
So noisy.
That's the place that trains all our

128
00:06:18,471 --> 00:06:21,830
teachers.
There will be six sessions hosted for

129
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:24,050
all human resources staff throughout
October 12,

130
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,740
2016.
Note that six sessions.

131
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,110
Okay.
You will receive a registration link

132
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:31,310
soon to attend.

133
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:34,070
One of the training sessions hosted on
the St George campus.

134
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:38,060
I asked that all colleagues working,
there's three campuses on the University

135
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,440
of Toronto.
There are somewhat distributed around

136
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:43,970
the city so that people are being asked
to come to the central campus in order

137
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:48,230
to to finish the training.
Please note that this is required

138
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:52,100
training for all HR staff at the
University of Toronto and we will be

139
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:55,380
tracking attendance and completion
versus via h,

140
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:58,220
r I s,
which I guess is obviously their

141
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,470
attendance and completion tracking
system,

142
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,880
so it's mandatory and there's much made
of that that it's mandatory.

143
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,760
If you have questions,
please contact Erin Jackson,

144
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,370
executive director Ihr.
Okay.

145
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:14,960
So fundamentally human resources staff
at the University of Toronto are now

146
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:19,280
required to attend anti racist and anti
bias training six sessions.

147
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,010
And they have it.
The attendance is mandatory.

148
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,960
Okay.
So why is that a problem?

149
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:30,430
Well,
I think there's actually eight problems

150
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:32,330
with it and I'm going to go through them
in detail.

151
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:37,520
The first problem is the assumption of
racism and bias at the University of

152
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,181
Toronto.
Well,

153
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:41,240
because if there's no racism and bias
problem at the University of Toronto,

154
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,880
then why bother with it at all?
So that's one assumption.

155
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,530
Um,
another,

156
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:50,180
another problem and not in assumption is
what is in my estimation and the

157
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:53,630
question of the legitimacy of the groups
and individuals who are serving as

158
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:57,440
consultants to the University of Toronto
Human Resources Department.

159
00:07:57,441 --> 00:08:01,280
And we already identified them.
One of them was Tana Turner,

160
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,970
Turner and the other was Mervyn Charles.
And we'll talk about them momentarily.

161
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:07,010
Oh yes.
And also the black liberation

162
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:07,820
collective,
uh,

163
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:11,510
because the,
the HR people have been consulting with

164
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:14,630
the black liberation collective.
So these are people now who have been

165
00:08:14,631 --> 00:08:19,460
deemed appropriate to advise the
university in its internal policies.

166
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,920
Okay.
Third assumption that I think is

167
00:08:21,921 --> 00:08:24,920
problematic,
the assumption that anti racism and anti

168
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:29,720
bias training is the way to address
racism and bias at the University of

169
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,860
Toronto assuming that it exists because
that's that that hypothesis can be

170
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:34,694
questioned.

171
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,750
The willingness to introduce what is
clearly politicized training or,

172
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,970
or could easily become that into the
workplace.

173
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,820
And on a university campus,
which I would think would be the last

174
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:47,000
place where such things should be done
casually.

175
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:48,050
Let's say.
Uh,

176
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:52,190
the fifth problem is assumption of guilt
on the part of the HR staff.

177
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:57,030
The sixth problem is the assumption that
such training should be mandatory.

178
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,600
The seventh problem is the assumption
that the people hired have the

179
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:04,440
competence to conduct such training.
That's obviously linked to my earlier

180
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:08,700
point about questioning whether or not
the people who are being consulted to

181
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:12,240
make the policy to begin with,
have the competence and authority

182
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,180
necessary authority,
legitimacy to,

183
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,200
uh,
to,

184
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,510
to,
to promote such policies.

185
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,420
And then finally,
the assumption that such training will

186
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:24,030
make the situation.
Assuming there is a situation that needs

187
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,970
to be addressed better rather than
worse.

188
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,030
All right,
so that's eight problems and we're going

189
00:09:29,031 --> 00:09:31,170
to take,
we're gonna take a very close look at

190
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:34,080
each of them.
I think if even one of those problems

191
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,273
is,
is,

192
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:40,110
is properly formulated as I see it,
that that's enough of a reason to

193
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:44,850
question the validity of this policy,
but I believe that all eight of these

194
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:47,280
problems exist and they're,
they're all each that serious.

195
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,590
So.
And you can make up your own mind about

196
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:51,420
whether you believe that once you hear
the argument.

197
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,040
All right,
so first,

198
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:56,280
let's start with the assumption of
racism and bias at the University of

199
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,180
Toronto.
Well,

200
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,240
the first thing I would say is that,
um,

201
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,420
you can,
if you compare any organization to a

202
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:07,080
hypothetical Utopian ideal,
then you can be sure that it will fall

203
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:09,120
short.
And I would say however,

204
00:10:09,121 --> 00:10:13,560
that comparing any organization to a
hypothetical Utopian ideal is a very

205
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:18,240
dangerous thing to do because if you,
if you're cognizant of the history of

206
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:20,520
the 20th century,
you know that there's certain dangers

207
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:22,800
associated with Utopian political
idealism.

208
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,040
And that what Utopian political
idealists do is to pause it some perfect

209
00:10:28,081 --> 00:10:30,210
state,
and then denigrate every organization

210
00:10:30,211 --> 00:10:33,870
that human beings have ever managed to
produce on the basis that it's not up to

211
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:36,750
that level of perfection.
So yes,

212
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,120
compared to Utopia,
the University of Toronto has its

213
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:41,010
problems,
but we're not going to do that.

214
00:10:41,011 --> 00:10:44,790
We're going to compare it to actual real
other places.

215
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,290
And so we're gonna.
Think about this.

216
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:49,350
All right?
So if you picked a country that was the

217
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:52,260
hallmark of,
let's call it tolerance and I mean

218
00:10:52,261 --> 00:10:54,510
reasonable tolerance if you,
if you,

219
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,890
if you wanted to identify a country that
exemplified that above all else in the

220
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:01,320
world,
there'd be a few contenders,

221
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:03,120
but Canada would definitely be in that
list.

222
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:04,070
Okay.
So we're,

223
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,020
we're a tolerant culture.
And then Ontario,

224
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:11,190
I would say within Canada is one of the,
is one of the more liberal provinces,

225
00:11:11,191 --> 00:11:12,630
more liberal tolerant provinces.

226
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,150
And it's a very,
very multicultural and ethnically

227
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:18,180
diverse.
And that's particularly true of Toronto,

228
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:23,181
which prides itself rightly or wrongly,
on being the most multicultural city in

229
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:25,890
the world.
And Toronto's a great city,

230
00:11:25,891 --> 00:11:26,571
man.
It's big,

231
00:11:26,571 --> 00:11:28,560
gets exciting,
it's developing well,

232
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:32,880
it's got a booming economy and a
everyone who comes here seems to get

233
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:35,040
along and that's great and I don't know
why that is,

234
00:11:35,041 --> 00:11:38,910
but partly it's because the city is
embedded in Canada and Ontario and

235
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,400
Toronto is doing some good thing,
so hooray for that.

236
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,510
And then within Toronto you have the
University of Toronto and that the

237
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:50,340
campus is so multi ethnic and racially
diverse that I would,

238
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:55,430
I would challenge anyone to find an
anywhere in the world that has those

239
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,140
attributes more firmly in place than the
University of Toronto.

240
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:04,150
So then so I don't see that there's a,
there's a problem with with racism and

241
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:07,780
bias at the University of Toronto and I
got to point out that measurements are

242
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:08,890
real issue here,
you know,

243
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:11,170
because you have to figure out,
and I'm speaking from a technical

244
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:13,240
perspective,
what is,

245
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:18,160
how it is that you measure racism and
asking people individually if they think

246
00:12:18,161 --> 00:12:20,800
there is racism isn't a reasonable way
of doing it.

247
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,800
I can tell you partly why that is.
If if you ask people to what degree they

248
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:28,990
have,
their group has experienced racism in a

249
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:32,680
given context or in a given culture,
they'll generally report a fairly high

250
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:35,920
degree of racism,
but if you ask them how much they as

251
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,610
individuals have suffered from racism or
other forms of bias,

252
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,690
the estimates are much lower.
And so that's just one indication of the

253
00:12:43,691 --> 00:12:45,520
measurement difficulty,
um,

254
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,860
that,
that is part and parcel of trying to

255
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:50,320
deal with something as complicated as
racism has been.

256
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:51,910
First of all,
exactly what you mean.

257
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,340
What do you mean by racism?
That's a tricky thing.

258
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,800
And second,
how exactly do you measure it?

259
00:12:56,801 --> 00:13:00,570
So you know what degree of racism there
is and you have to do that before you.

260
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,850
You run around deciding that there's so
much racism that people need to be

261
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:04,684
educated.

262
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:08,110
It's a technical problem and I can tell
you that if I conducted a research study

263
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:13,000
that was reviewed by the University of
Toronto Ethics Board on an organization

264
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,810
which are not very fond of by the way,
but assuming I wanted to do a research

265
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,570
project of this sort,
I can tell you I'd have to have a lot

266
00:13:19,571 --> 00:13:23,440
better measures of racism then the
measures that the hr department is using

267
00:13:23,441 --> 00:13:26,190
to accuse their own staff have
sufficient racism to,

268
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,240
to,
to necessitate training.

269
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,280
So that's something to think about
there.

270
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,410
The black liberation collective,
which is the group,

271
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:39,170
one of the groups that the UFT has
hypothetically be consulting with a

272
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,760
claims that you've t is a racially
biased,

273
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,360
a entity because we don't.
It doesn't have as many black people in

274
00:13:48,971 --> 00:13:53,440
its in its faculty and administration as
you would expect to be there if you use

275
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:55,270
the census as a guideline.

276
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,810
But you know,
you,

277
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,210
you can't do that because there's all
sorts of reasons other than racism wipe

278
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,300
a population might be underrepresented
in a,

279
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:09,310
in an organization and,
and it also ignores the broader context.

280
00:14:09,311 --> 00:14:11,200
So for example,
if you're,

281
00:14:11,201 --> 00:14:15,190
if you're thinking about non-consensus
related representation at the University

282
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,920
of Toronto and you're going to use that
as a hallmark of discrimination,

283
00:14:17,921 --> 00:14:20,980
you're really in trouble because there's
way more women than men.

284
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,140
Students say for example,
in the humanities,

285
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:24,900
and there's way more men in this,
in the,

286
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,940
in the sciences and technology.
Uh,

287
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,800
the hard sciences,
so to speak.

288
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,400
There's more Jews among the faculty or
the,

289
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:36,100
uh,
and that's almost always the case among

290
00:14:36,101 --> 00:14:40,060
faculty because Jewish people tend to be
overrepresented in disciplines where

291
00:14:40,061 --> 00:14:42,970
intellectual prowess is,
is valued.

292
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,900
Um,
there's more Asians on campus in

293
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:51,470
mathematics and say then there are the
than you would estimate from the census

294
00:14:51,471 --> 00:14:53,270
preference or is the census data.

295
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,760
So it's like,
if we're going to use census data as the

296
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,200
hallmark of,
of,

297
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,200
of representation at the university,
we've really got a lot of problems and

298
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:03,260
we're going to have to get rid of a lot
of people who have positions that are

299
00:15:03,261 --> 00:15:07,220
already members of what are often
regarded as minority.

300
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:12,221
So it's an insane policy.
Also over older people are all obviously

301
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,590
overrepresented among the faculty and
the administration.

302
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:18,130
But that doesn't mean necessarily that
there's,

303
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,420
that is because of bias,
you know,

304
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:23,690
because of bias of the same sort that
you would associate with racism and

305
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,300
then,
well there's all sorts of problems

306
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:29,030
associated with that and if it's black
people who are under represented,

307
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:31,640
well,
which black people are we going to try

308
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:35,120
to try who's,
which black people or are we going to

309
00:15:35,121 --> 00:15:38,620
try to represent more specifically?
Um,

310
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:43,460
are we going to use recent immigrants,
I mean recent black immigrants into the

311
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,160
United States for example,
tend to do better than multigenerational

312
00:15:46,161 --> 00:15:47,790
black and habits of the U s.

313
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,190
So you might say,
well,

314
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,640
the people who are really being a what a
bias against or are the people who are

315
00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:59,990
the multigenerational inhabitants,
block multigenerational inhabitants of

316
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:02,390
North America.
And like this sort of thing can be

317
00:16:02,391 --> 00:16:05,960
infinitely fractionated.
It's not helpful and will never get a

318
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,040
precise representation by census in any
institution.

319
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,900
It's a stupid way of thinking about it
anyways.

320
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,560
Second,
I don't think that the groups that are

321
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:19,490
consulting with the University of
Toronto hr people are legitimate.

322
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,300
They're not legitimate as groups and
they're legitimate as people who have a

323
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:25,460
perspective,
but they're not legitimate as people who

324
00:16:25,461 --> 00:16:29,690
should be
consulted on with regards to policy at

325
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:31,310
the University of Toronto because they
are,

326
00:16:31,311 --> 00:16:33,800
by no means there.
They have no legitimacy.

327
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,430
Legitimacy among the people that they
purport to represent.

328
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:39,350
No,
not none of the kind of legitimacy that

329
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:42,350
we recognize as legitimacy.
Like in a democracy,

330
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:45,080
you recognize elected representatives,
for example,

331
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:47,360
as legitimate representate
representatives.

332
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:52,370
So there their,
a negotiating with the or consulting

333
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:55,430
with the black liberation collective is
primarily a US group.

334
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:59,120
The racial situation in Canada and the
racial situation in the United States

335
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,120
are not the same at all.
So this is as far as I can tell,

336
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:05,120
it's a spill over of what are
fundamentally American problems into the

337
00:17:05,121 --> 00:17:06,940
Canadian political scene.
Um,

338
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,930
I'll talk more about the black
liberation collective shortly and also

339
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:15,920
racialized members of the t community.
And I wasn't even sure what racialized

340
00:17:15,921 --> 00:17:19,770
members mean because I guess I'm not
capable of keeping up with a rep

341
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:23,090
constant rapid transformation of
politically correct terminology.

342
00:17:23,091 --> 00:17:26,810
So I had to look it up.
It's a sociological term,

343
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:28,830
which doesn't really surprise me,
uh,

344
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:31,310
because I think sociology is
fundamentally corrupt,

345
00:17:31,311 --> 00:17:32,230
disciplined,
uh,

346
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:35,750
there's a variety of corrupt disciplines
on university campuses and sociology is

347
00:17:35,751 --> 00:17:40,340
certainly one of them.
Racialization or ethnicized nation is

348
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:43,850
the process of ascribing ethnic or
racial identities to a relationship,

349
00:17:43,851 --> 00:17:47,210
social practice or group that did not
identify itself as such.

350
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,250
Well,
that doesn't seem to be the definition

351
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:53,130
that the HR people are using.
So I looked at the Ontario human rights

352
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:57,050
commission website because it come up on
very quickly in the Google search and

353
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,360
not surprisingly because it's,
it's an appalling website and in a

354
00:18:00,361 --> 00:18:02,530
multitude of ways.
And uh,

355
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,230
uh,
the Ontario Human Rights Commission says

356
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,750
recognizing that race is a social
construct.

357
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:15,290
The HRC describes people as racialized
person or racialized group instead of

358
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:18,270
the more outdated and inaccurate terms,
racial minority,

359
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:21,180
visible minority person of color or non
white.

360
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:25,770
And I mean it wasn't very long ago that,
that as far as I can remember,

361
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:29,430
that visible minority and person of
color were the correct socially or the

362
00:18:29,431 --> 00:18:31,370
correct politically correct terms.
But you know,

363
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,820
they change very,
very rapidly.

364
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:35,070
And the reason for that is that if you
keep changing the terms,

365
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:37,350
you can keep playing the stupid
politically correct game.

366
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:40,260
That's at least one reason.
And I said I'll make a video on the

367
00:18:40,261 --> 00:18:43,140
nature of the PC game,
be a short video.

368
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,580
And so,
but one of,

369
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:46,620
one of,
one of the rules of the game is keep

370
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:49,170
changing the terminology so everyone's
always at fault.

371
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,160
So anyways,
I guess what consulting with racialized

372
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:58,110
members of the uft community means is
that the u of t somehow consulted,

373
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,240
let's say,
I don't know how they would define who

374
00:19:03,241 --> 00:19:06,870
constituted a minority on the University
of Toronto campus because like I said,

375
00:19:06,871 --> 00:19:08,940
it's a very multiethnic,
it's a very,

376
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:12,090
very multiethnic campus.
It's not obvious at all on first,

377
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:14,940
uh,
it's not obvious at all who's,

378
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:15,990
who's,
uh,

379
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,390
underrepresented and who's
overrepresented.

380
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:21,720
But I suppose it's probably the,
the overrepresented people would

381
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:26,721
certainly be.
I'm black or white middle class males.

382
00:19:27,691 --> 00:19:30,090
I suspected that people,
they're probably not very happy about.

383
00:19:30,091 --> 00:19:31,920
I mean those guys are on their way out
anyways.

384
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,890
And males in general are on the way out
in the university.

385
00:19:34,891 --> 00:19:37,170
So it's not going to be a problem if
it's a problem now,

386
00:19:37,171 --> 00:19:39,000
it's certainly not going to be a problem
for very long.

387
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,580
So.
So anyways,

388
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:44,310
I don't think that those groups are
particularly legitimate as,

389
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,820
as,
as I'm speaking more particularly of the

390
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:52,821
black liberation collective racialized
members of the ut community is so vague

391
00:19:53,581 --> 00:19:55,370
that I don't know exactly,
you know,

392
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:59,820
I can't understand.
I can't get a handle on the standing of

393
00:19:59,821 --> 00:20:03,700
those people and I don't know how what
they did was measured there.

394
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,530
And,
and,

395
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:07,200
and uh,
I don't understand the validity of the

396
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:09,540
constructs that are,
they're being applied to the,

397
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,090
to these particular groups.
Okay.

398
00:20:12,091 --> 00:20:13,830
Let's look at the black liberation
collective.

399
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,780
Who are they?
We,

400
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,080
this is from their website.
We're a collective consisting of black

401
00:20:19,081 --> 00:20:22,590
students who are dedicated to
transforming institutions of higher

402
00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:26,460
education through unity coalition
building direct action and political

403
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:27,294
education.

404
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,133
Okay.
Well,

405
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,010
fair enough.
I suppose if that's what they want to

406
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,220
do,
that's what they want to do.

407
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:34,770
It's a,
I don't know exactly what they're aimed

408
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:37,890
at with regards to transforming
institutions of higher education through

409
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:40,790
unity coalition building,
etc. It's a,

410
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:43,290
it's a typical activist group as far as
I can tell,

411
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,860
and as as you would expect from a
typical activist group,

412
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,300
they don't negotiate,
they have demands,

413
00:20:49,301 --> 00:20:52,570
they have national demands and campus
demands,

414
00:20:52,571 --> 00:20:56,050
and so they make demands to universities
across north America and the

415
00:20:56,051 --> 00:21:01,000
universities are appallingly willing to
to kowtow to those demands without,

416
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:04,630
I think without sufficient thought to
merely as a consequence of mostly as a

417
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:09,631
consequence of fear and the desire to be
viewed as always being on the side of

418
00:21:09,701 --> 00:21:14,140
moral virtue without having to undertake
the thought necessary to actually ensure

419
00:21:14,141 --> 00:21:15,730
that that is where you're standing.

420
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,810
So here's some of the demands.
Oh,

421
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,070
sorry.
I have to tell you a bit more about the

422
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,800
liberation collective.
I couldn't find them on wikipedia.

423
00:21:23,801 --> 00:21:26,500
Weirdly enough.
I know that they demanded segregated

424
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:29,650
spaces at several universities that
segregated spaces.

425
00:21:29,651 --> 00:21:32,860
Can I say that again?
They demanded segregated spaces at

426
00:21:32,861 --> 00:21:35,500
several universities,
including ucla and at New York

427
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:39,760
university they wanted black people only
to be living together and queer people

428
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:43,390
only to be living together and they also
demanded safe spaces at oberland

429
00:21:43,391 --> 00:21:45,400
college.
So that gives you some indication of the

430
00:21:45,401 --> 00:21:49,000
sorts of things that they're up to.
I'm okay.

431
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:52,870
Third assumption.
The third assumption the hr department

432
00:21:52,871 --> 00:21:57,610
is making is that anti racism and anti
bias training is the way to address the

433
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,880
hypothetical racism and bias problem at
the university of toronto.

434
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:05,890
And this brings up a whole.
this opens a whole multitude of cans of

435
00:22:05,891 --> 00:22:07,840
worms,
which is a lot of cans of worms.

436
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,460
First of all,
as I said,

437
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,920
it's very,
very difficult to measure something like

438
00:22:11,921 --> 00:22:14,200
racism and bias,
extraordinarily difficult,

439
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,590
especially bias.
And that's a rat's nest of fear of

440
00:22:17,591 --> 00:22:21,340
theoretical and empirical investIgation,
particularly in social psychology.

441
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:23,080
And there's some terrible things
happening there.

442
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,090
So they're very difficult things to
measure.

443
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,580
And so,
but you don't only have to measure

444
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,140
racism and bias to,
to indicate that such things exist in a,

445
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:35,140
in a university,
you have to indicate not only that they

446
00:22:35,141 --> 00:22:37,450
exist,
but they exist and that they're causing

447
00:22:37,451 --> 00:22:41,290
problems of a certain magnitude.
And then you have to also,

448
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,650
uh,
a posit that the problems that such

449
00:22:44,651 --> 00:22:49,240
things are causing if they exist,
are the most compelling problems that

450
00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:52,570
need to exist.
It needs need to be addressed because

451
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:57,910
you have to address problems one at a
time in terms of their importance and so

452
00:22:57,911 --> 00:22:58,780
you need a ranking.

453
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,140
So let's say there is racism at the
university of toronto and I suppose

454
00:23:02,141 --> 00:23:06,490
there is some because there's some
everywhere that doesn't validate just

455
00:23:06,491 --> 00:23:10,720
because there is some doesn't mean that,
that this is where our efforts should be

456
00:23:10,721 --> 00:23:15,490
devoted as a university and the
university has put a lot of resources

457
00:23:15,491 --> 00:23:18,370
into this sort of thing and I think in
an ill advised way and they're paying an

458
00:23:18,371 --> 00:23:21,430
awful lot of money and they're paying
the staff that are doing this crazy

459
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:23,560
amount of money,
especially in comparison to their,

460
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,810
um,
what would you call it?

461
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,190
Credentials.
Seriously.

462
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,810
It's,
and that's a good indication of the

463
00:23:28,811 --> 00:23:29,970
actual,
uh,

464
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,010
what would you call it,
the actual value hierarchy of the

465
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:36,040
university.
So it isn't obvious to me that the

466
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:39,490
university of toronto whose primary
function is to address racism on the,

467
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,520
on the,
on the university of toronto campus.

468
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,660
So especially,
well,

469
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,570
I've already made that point.
You have to measure and define racism

470
00:23:47,571 --> 00:23:51,260
and bias.
You have to measure and define the,

471
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,400
uh,
the,

472
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,520
you have to define what your training
program is going to look like and

473
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:59,210
hypothetically why it'll work and what
elements of work and then you also have

474
00:23:59,211 --> 00:24:02,540
to assess the outcome and I don't see
any of that happening properly with,

475
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,630
with,
with the way that the human resources

476
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:08,600
department is going about this
particular training program.

477
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,300
And as I said already,
I would not be allowed as a researcher

478
00:24:11,301 --> 00:24:15,020
at u of t to conduct this as an
intervention in an experiment.

479
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,240
It would violate the ethics provisions
at the uft uses to restrict to

480
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,260
researchers.
So it looks like it's okay to inflict on

481
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:23,840
your employees,
but it wouldn't be okay for scientists

482
00:24:23,841 --> 00:24:26,930
to ask people to volunteer for,
for example.

483
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,190
So.
All right,

484
00:24:28,191 --> 00:24:32,930
so the point here is that there's no
evidence that anti racism and

485
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:37,370
anti-biased training actually lowers
racism and bias.

486
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,780
Okay.
It's a supposition.

487
00:24:38,781 --> 00:24:40,760
It might be true,
but it might not be true.

488
00:24:40,761 --> 00:24:43,530
And for all we know that it would
actually increase it and I'll,

489
00:24:43,531 --> 00:24:44,900
I'll get,
I'll go back to that.

490
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,970
Okay.
So the next issue is,

491
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:55,300
should employers,
especially employers at public

492
00:24:55,301 --> 00:25:00,280
universities be allowed to enforce
political training in force,

493
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,520
uh,
a training that's politically motivated

494
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:07,690
on their employees and you know,
maybe you could debate whether or not

495
00:25:07,691 --> 00:25:10,930
this constitutes political training,
but I think it does and if,

496
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:14,890
and if it doesn't,
it's close enough to it so that it,

497
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,330
it,
it,

498
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:19,060
it should be discussed at least as a
potential problem.

499
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:24,730
So I don't think that employers should
be allowed to politically indoctrinate,

500
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,310
let's use that word or even educate for
that matter.

501
00:25:27,311 --> 00:25:30,880
Although I don't see any evidence that
what the uft hr department is doing

502
00:25:30,881 --> 00:25:34,540
actually qualifies as education.
I don't think that an employer should be

503
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:39,541
allowed to indoctrinate its employees on
pain of the threat of job loss and you

504
00:25:40,661 --> 00:25:42,400
know,
the fact that this particular training

505
00:25:42,401 --> 00:25:46,420
program is mandatory and that that set a
couple of times and that attendance will

506
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:49,480
be taken indicates to me an implicit
threat that,

507
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,890
um,
you know,

508
00:25:50,891 --> 00:25:51,521
your,
your,

509
00:25:51,521 --> 00:25:54,100
your,
your employment viability is going to be

510
00:25:54,101 --> 00:25:57,160
judged to some degree depending on
whether or not you go attend these

511
00:25:57,161 --> 00:25:57,730
seminars.

512
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,530
So I don't think that's acceptable at
all.

513
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,960
Um,
and this looks very political to me.

514
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,540
The,
these ideas are associated with radical

515
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:05,560
left.
Did he ology,

516
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,920
um,
the,

517
00:26:06,921 --> 00:26:11,560
the people who are promoting this use
highly politicized language and all of

518
00:26:11,561 --> 00:26:15,700
it's predicated on the fundamental
assumption that group based oppression

519
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:18,910
is everywhere and that should be the
primary consideration of,

520
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:22,320
of social policy and economic policy
and,

521
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,543
and,
uh,

522
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,410
organizational policy even in places
like the university.

523
00:26:26,411 --> 00:26:30,970
So that looks all political to me.
So this is the worst one,

524
00:26:30,971 --> 00:26:32,230
I think probably.
Okay.

525
00:26:32,231 --> 00:26:36,010
So let's look at it this way.
So let's say I'm an hr person at the

526
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:39,680
university of toronto and I get this
memo and uh,

527
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,850
here's the problem.
So I decided that I'm going to go here.

528
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:47,120
Here's what the memo presumes,
presumes that the,

529
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,340
that I'm sufficiently racist,
first of all,

530
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:54,750
that my membership in the hr department
is the cardinal element here about which

531
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:58,500
my guilt or innocence with regards to
racism can be adjudicated [inaudible].

532
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,650
The fundamental presumption is that as a
group,

533
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:05,580
the hr department,
people are sufficiently racist and

534
00:27:05,581 --> 00:27:08,130
biased so that they need reeducation.
Okay?

535
00:27:08,131 --> 00:27:11,730
So that to me is the presumption of,
it's two problems with that.

536
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,051
It's,
first of all,

537
00:27:13,051 --> 00:27:15,480
it's group based,
it's group identity based and second of

538
00:27:15,481 --> 00:27:17,640
all,
it's the presumption of guilt before

539
00:27:17,641 --> 00:27:18,570
innocence.
Right?

540
00:27:18,571 --> 00:27:19,630
So,
um,

541
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,170
and so that means that if I exceed to
this,

542
00:27:22,171 --> 00:27:27,150
if I agree to go to this,
that I'm acting out the proposition that

543
00:27:27,151 --> 00:27:31,950
I am in fact sufficiently guilty of
racism and bias so that I need to be

544
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,330
reeducated.
Well,

545
00:27:33,331 --> 00:27:37,550
I don't think that it's reasonable for
the hr department to assume that it's

546
00:27:37,551 --> 00:27:39,810
staff is guilty of such nefarious
things.

547
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:42,330
So,
and I think it violates a fundamental,

548
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,530
a fundamental presupposition that's at
the bottom of the western legal code and

549
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:48,220
at western culture,
um,

550
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,860
and the freedom that goes along with
that.

551
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:53,940
And that's the assumption of innocence.
You're innocent until proven guilty and

552
00:27:53,941 --> 00:27:57,150
you're innocent even if you have,
even if there's reasonable doubt about

553
00:27:57,151 --> 00:28:01,890
your guilt and you also have the right
to a reasonable to a thorough,

554
00:28:01,891 --> 00:28:04,560
thorough defense.
And so I think it's reasonable for any

555
00:28:04,561 --> 00:28:06,000
given hr person to say,
hey,

556
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:08,610
look,
I'm not sufficiently racist to be

557
00:28:08,611 --> 00:28:12,570
reeducated.
And I don't think that it's appropriate

558
00:28:12,571 --> 00:28:16,590
for you to be implying that I am and I
don't think that it's appropriate for

559
00:28:16,591 --> 00:28:20,700
you to demaNd that I attend and I don't
think it's appropriate thAt you hold out

560
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:23,130
the possibility of punishment if I don't
attend.

561
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:27,540
So there's something even worse that's
associated with this is that,

562
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,870
and we'll get to this in more detail,
is that there's an idea that's become

563
00:28:30,871 --> 00:28:34,020
very,
very popular and it's partly a

564
00:28:34,021 --> 00:28:38,550
consequence of a certain brand of social
psychology associated with an idea

565
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:41,580
called a or with a test called the
implicit association test.

566
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:46,680
And that is the idea that people are
characterized by unconscious racism and

567
00:28:46,681 --> 00:28:48,870
bias.
And the thing is that might be true,

568
00:28:48,871 --> 00:28:51,210
but that's not really relevant because
we're.

569
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,390
Everyone is guilty of all sorts of
things unconsciously,

570
00:28:54,391 --> 00:28:56,910
instructionally.
And that isn't how you judge the

571
00:28:56,911 --> 00:28:59,190
innocence or guilt of somewhat.
And besides that,

572
00:28:59,191 --> 00:29:02,730
we don't understand things like
unconscious bias and unconscious racism

573
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:07,020
anywhere near well enough or are able to
measure it anywhere near well enough to

574
00:29:07,021 --> 00:29:09,240
start.
Assuming that we can start making

575
00:29:09,241 --> 00:29:12,270
statements and educating people out of
their unconscious bias is it's an

576
00:29:12,271 --> 00:29:14,850
unbelievably,
unbelievably dangerous idea and it's an

577
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,050
absolute misuse of social science,
a terrible misuse of social science and

578
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:22,860
I should say that it's,
it's coming out of social psychology and

579
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:26,610
it's by and done and the research has
been done by some of the top researchers

580
00:29:26,611 --> 00:29:29,790
in the field of social psychology and
right now the field of social psychology

581
00:29:29,791 --> 00:29:33,750
is under tremendous attack for the
fundamental poor quality of its

582
00:29:33,751 --> 00:29:35,130
scientific investigations.

583
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,980
So that's all very much worth thinking
about.

584
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:43,280
So and to me the,
once we allow the idea that unconscious

585
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:47,500
racism and bias constitutes a form of
guilt and here's the road we're walking

586
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:49,900
down.
You can be punished or threatened for

587
00:29:49,901 --> 00:29:52,930
the possibility of your guilt,
which means you're the sort of person

588
00:29:52,931 --> 00:29:56,350
that could conceivably do something
about which you could be held guilty

589
00:29:56,351 --> 00:29:57,280
for.
And you know,

590
00:29:57,281 --> 00:30:00,520
everyone's like that because you know,
everyone has a dark side,

591
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,820
that's for sure.
And,

592
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,720
but we can't be punished because we have
dark sides.

593
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:07,720
We can be punished because we express
those in illegal actions.

594
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,850
Not,
and you don't punIsh people or fix them

595
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:11,650
up until they've actually broken the
law,

596
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,490
not because they might break the law.
Everybody might break the law.

597
00:30:15,491 --> 00:30:17,590
So if the rule is,
if we might break the law,

598
00:30:17,591 --> 00:30:20,350
we should be punished to reeducated,
then everyone should be punished to

599
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,810
reeducated,
and that's unless you want to be

600
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:24,010
punished or reeducated.

601
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:27,760
That's not a very good idea.
I think it's even worse is that we could

602
00:30:27,761 --> 00:30:31,150
be punished or reeducated for the
possibility that we might have the

603
00:30:31,151 --> 00:30:34,340
intent to do something so.
So the,

604
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:37,360
the level of abstraction of guilt here
is becoming truly,

605
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,830
truly absurd and it's truly dangerous.
Here's the ontario human rights

606
00:30:41,831 --> 00:30:42,664
commission.
Again,

607
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:45,190
if you need a terrible quote about
something,

608
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:50,590
if you need a quote too about that will
help you support your assumption of

609
00:30:50,591 --> 00:30:53,860
creeping authoritarianism on the left.
All you have to do is go to the ontario

610
00:30:53,861 --> 00:30:57,970
human rights commission website and they
will give you something you need every

611
00:30:57,971 --> 00:30:58,690
time.
And ruth,

612
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,230
virtually every sentence,
racism can be openly displayed in racial

613
00:31:02,231 --> 00:31:04,540
jokes or slurs and slurs are hate
crimes.

614
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,381
Uh,
yeah,

615
00:31:05,381 --> 00:31:06,270
well,
so much for,

616
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,010
for all sorts of comedians.
I mean toronto has a very,

617
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:11,110
very,
very famous comedian who does nothing

618
00:31:11,111 --> 00:31:14,050
but racial jokes and I mean people love
him.

619
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,870
People from races all over the,
from,

620
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:19,840
from every race you can possibly imagine
flocked to his show to be insulted by

621
00:31:19,841 --> 00:31:22,140
him because it's such a relief for
someone to,

622
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:26,860
to state straight out such things
instead of instead of,

623
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:32,080
and make a joke about them instead of
walking down this particular path that

624
00:31:32,081 --> 00:31:34,990
people are relieved and happy to see it
happen openly.

625
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,790
Um,
I can't remember.

626
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,230
Russell peters,
that's the guy.

627
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:42,000
And so as far as I can tell what Russell
Peters does is becoming close to illegal

628
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:44,380
and you know,
Russell Peters is pretty damn funny guy.

629
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,870
And so,
and to think of him as a racist is

630
00:31:46,871 --> 00:31:51,370
absolutely insane and you know,
and there was a comedian already in

631
00:31:51,371 --> 00:31:54,730
Canada who was fined $40,000 by the
quebec human rights commission for.

632
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,520
I mean he said some nasty things and,
but that's not the point.

633
00:31:57,521 --> 00:31:58,240
He's a comedian.

634
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,550
Leave the damn comedians alone right
there.

635
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:03,700
Like the gestures in the king's courts,
they're allowed to say what they want to

636
00:32:03,701 --> 00:32:06,670
say so that we can keep stupid things
and crooked things out where everybody

637
00:32:06,671 --> 00:32:11,110
can pay attention to them anyways.
Racism can be openly displayed in racial

638
00:32:11,111 --> 00:32:14,860
jokes and slurs or hate crimes,
but can be more deeply rooted in here.

639
00:32:14,861 --> 00:32:16,420
We go out attitudes,
values,

640
00:32:16,421 --> 00:32:19,120
and stereotypical beliefs.
Good luck defining them,

641
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:23,050
and what will happen is there'll be
defined in a way that maximizes people's

642
00:32:23,051 --> 00:32:25,810
guilt because that's the way you can
keep the pc game going.

643
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,500
As I said,
in some cases these are unconsciously

644
00:32:29,501 --> 00:32:30,730
held.
Oh good.

645
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:34,600
So now we're going to be held liable for
our unconscious biases.

646
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,370
Very,
very bad idea,

647
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,010
especially because we just do not
understand things very well.

648
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,360
We can't measure the very well.
We don't understand them very well.

649
00:32:41,361 --> 00:32:45,470
There's a lot of debate about what they
are and even if they do exist in the way

650
00:32:45,471 --> 00:32:49,760
that people claim we don't know what to
do about it and like it conscious

651
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:52,220
retraining programs,
there is no evidence that conscious

652
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:55,490
retraining programs are gonna are gonna
fix this sort of thing.

653
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,940
So if there is evidence,
I certainly don't know it and worse and

654
00:32:58,941 --> 00:33:01,190
if there is evidence,
I don't think the people who are doing

655
00:33:01,191 --> 00:33:05,560
the reeducation programs demanded by the
hr people have demonstrated that there

656
00:33:05,561 --> 00:33:08,690
are particular programs have the
positive benefit that's being claimed.

657
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,620
Okay.
Next is the assumption that such

658
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:18,780
training should be mandatory.
Well,

659
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,660
you know,
that reeks to me of again,

660
00:33:21,661 --> 00:33:24,990
of creeping authoritarianism.
It's like not only are you biased and

661
00:33:24,991 --> 00:33:27,450
racist and you don't get to say anything
about that,

662
00:33:27,451 --> 00:33:29,130
we're just going to assume it right off
the bat,

663
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:31,980
but you better be damn well go to the
training.

664
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,350
Um,
and if you don't there's going to be a

665
00:33:34,351 --> 00:33:35,700
problem for you.
Okay?

666
00:33:35,701 --> 00:33:36,534
Well,
anybody,

667
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:37,590
if all you have,

668
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,960
why not make it voluntary?
Why not make it voluntary?

669
00:33:44,961 --> 00:33:46,250
Why not ask people,
you know,

670
00:33:46,251 --> 00:33:49,250
maybe you get a 95 percent show rate,
but then of course it wouldn't be the

671
00:33:49,251 --> 00:33:51,200
real racists that would go.
You don't know that.

672
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,450
You don't know that you could ask your
people to go.

673
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,550
In fact,
you could ask them to go and see if

674
00:33:55,551 --> 00:33:58,130
anybody showed up because he would also
be able to judge that way if there was

675
00:33:58,131 --> 00:33:59,450
any interest in it,
but oh no,

676
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:02,150
we're going to force people to go.
We're going to impose our particular

677
00:34:02,151 --> 00:34:04,940
political perspective on the morgan.
I accused them of guilt.

678
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,500
We're going to punish them if they
don't,

679
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:09,680
if they don't go along with our mandate.
That's the policy.

680
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,440
Even though we have no evidence that
this is going to work.

681
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,440
Okay,
now more.

682
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,640
Neither one.
The competence and impartiality of

683
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:19,170
people hired his trainers.
Okay,

684
00:34:19,171 --> 00:34:23,550
so let's say that there is a problem
with racism and bias at the university

685
00:34:23,551 --> 00:34:26,670
of toronto,
which which I don't believe and or at

686
00:34:26,671 --> 00:34:29,580
least I don't believe it's enough of a
problem so that it should be like so

687
00:34:29,581 --> 00:34:33,300
high up the hierarchy of problems that
we're trying strenuously to fix

688
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:38,730
as an imperfect organization.
As far as imperfect organizations,

689
00:34:38,731 --> 00:34:39,870
ngos,
it's a pretty good one.

690
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,131
Okay,
so fine.

691
00:34:41,131 --> 00:34:44,400
Let's say that this racism and bias does
exist even though I don't think the

692
00:34:44,401 --> 00:34:47,280
evidence for that is there.
Well then the question is,

693
00:34:47,281 --> 00:34:49,590
well,
who are the people that are coming in to

694
00:34:49,591 --> 00:34:51,570
do the training?
Because I can tell you this is

695
00:34:51,571 --> 00:34:53,710
tantamount to a psychological,
um,

696
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:56,460
it certainly,
it's tantamount to a psychological

697
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:58,680
intervention and so then you might
think,

698
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:00,300
well,
are the people who are conducting this

699
00:35:00,301 --> 00:35:02,310
sort of intervention qualified to do so?

700
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:05,160
and one of the things you'd hope is that
they had the right credentials and the

701
00:35:05,161 --> 00:35:07,500
second is that you'd hope is that they
had published something,

702
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,630
you know,
in a respectable journal that had been

703
00:35:09,631 --> 00:35:12,720
peer reviewed indicating that there are
particular training program actually

704
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,920
reduced racism in a,
in a cost effective and measurable

705
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,980
manner instead of increasing it,
for example,

706
00:35:19,981 --> 00:35:22,050
because you know,
there's always the possibility that a

707
00:35:22,051 --> 00:35:24,120
well meaning intervention will make
things worse.

708
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,880
And we will get to that in a moment.
so we're going to look at the two people

709
00:35:26,881 --> 00:35:28,980
who are being hired as trainers and
we're going to,

710
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,560
I'll just tell you about them and you
can draw your own conclusions.

711
00:35:31,561 --> 00:35:34,320
Okay.
So the first one is tina turner.

712
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:38,190
Her qualifications are a master's in
sociology.

713
00:35:38,191 --> 00:35:40,800
And as I said already,
sociology is one of those disciplines

714
00:35:40,801 --> 00:35:43,410
that I at least as fundamentally
corrupt.

715
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:46,500
And so I don't think that that
constitutes qualification.

716
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,350
She worked in public service,
on print,

717
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:50,610
provincial employment equity
legislation.

718
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:54,870
She's responsible for work identifying
specific groups to be designated for

719
00:35:54,871 --> 00:35:59,070
employment equity 12 years as an
independent consultant providing human

720
00:35:59,071 --> 00:36:02,130
resource diversity,
equity research program evaluation and

721
00:36:02,131 --> 00:36:05,430
community consultants.
She expertise to a range of clients.

722
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,820
All right.
She's the principal at turner consulting

723
00:36:08,821 --> 00:36:09,990
group.
So she does this.

724
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:11,040
This is,
uh,

725
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,040
this is her primary occupation and she
is an equity diversity and inclusion

726
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,310
consultant.
She offers their offers clients a

727
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:23,340
comprehensive approach to help them
understand they're changing employee

728
00:36:23,341 --> 00:36:26,910
population and client base and how to
leverage that diversity for

729
00:36:26,911 --> 00:36:28,920
organizational success.
Because of course,

730
00:36:28,921 --> 00:36:32,520
one of our presuppositions is that
diversity defined in the politically

731
00:36:32,521 --> 00:36:35,400
correct manner is a precondition for
organizational success.

732
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:37,980
Even though I don't think that there's
any literature bearing on that,

733
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:40,200
that,
that indicates that that's the case.

734
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:43,530
I'm
all right.

735
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:48,390
Here's some of the things that she
claims and thinks inclusion goes.

736
00:36:48,391 --> 00:36:52,410
B goes beyond having a diverse workforce
and complying with equity related

737
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,990
legislation as important as these things
are

738
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:59,820
and inclusive organization can be
defined as an organization that

739
00:36:59,821 --> 00:37:03,030
integrates the values of equity and
diversity because of those,

740
00:37:03,031 --> 00:37:06,960
of course are the top two values within
all aspects of the organization,

741
00:37:06,961 --> 00:37:10,290
including policies and procedures as
well as individual behaviors and

742
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:13,560
organizational culture.
So in my estimation,

743
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:17,250
she's someone who fundamentally holds
politically correct beliefs and the

744
00:37:17,251 --> 00:37:20,100
reason she's hired by the people who
hire them,

745
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,980
hire her,
is to spread those beliefs as white as

746
00:37:22,981 --> 00:37:26,190
widely as possible within the
organization and now at the university

747
00:37:26,191 --> 00:37:28,850
of toronto that will be mandatory and
they'll.

748
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:32,280
There are implicit punishments waiting
in the wings for people who aren't

749
00:37:32,281 --> 00:37:33,540
really happy about doing that.

750
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,733
so

751
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:41,400
a diverse workforce includes people of
different races,

752
00:37:41,401 --> 00:37:42,270
cultures,
religions,

753
00:37:42,271 --> 00:37:43,440
ages,
sex abilities,

754
00:37:43,441 --> 00:37:45,780
and sexual and gender identities at all
job levels.

755
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:47,940
Yeah.
Well that's one way of defining diverse.

756
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,430
I mean,
I gueSs I would think more about what

757
00:37:50,431 --> 00:37:53,370
constitutes a competent and effective
workforce,

758
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:57,030
but that is a secondary consideration.
I would say it is a secondary

759
00:37:57,031 --> 00:37:58,950
consideration at the university of
toronto,

760
00:37:58,951 --> 00:38:01,530
at least in the administration as far as
I've been able to tell.

761
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:03,450
That doesn't mean it isn't a
consideration,

762
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:04,470
but we,
you,

763
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:07,260
you don't see this kind of discussion
about competence and excellence,

764
00:38:07,261 --> 00:38:09,420
which is what a dick,
what a university should really be

765
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:12,990
aiming at right there.
Institutions of excellence and the idea

766
00:38:12,991 --> 00:38:15,660
that excellence is best served by this
kind of diversity as a,

767
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,210
it's a specious,
a specious.

768
00:38:18,211 --> 00:38:19,410
Um,
uh,

769
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,940
at least it's a highly debatable claim.
I don't think there's any evidence for

770
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:25,410
it whatsoever.
I mean,

771
00:38:25,411 --> 00:38:26,244
it's hard.

772
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,910
Diversity is seen by the Organization
and it's employees as a source of

773
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:36,700
strength and creativity sets.
It's by the organization of its

774
00:38:36,701 --> 00:38:38,800
employees as a source of strength and
creativity.

775
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,480
That doesn't mean it is a source of
strength and creativity.

776
00:38:41,481 --> 00:38:44,770
And I can tell you I know the creatively
creativity literature very well and I

777
00:38:44,771 --> 00:38:47,980
know the productivity literature pretty
well and I don't think that there's any

778
00:38:47,981 --> 00:38:49,840
evidence at all that,
for example,

779
00:38:49,841 --> 00:38:52,510
diversity produces an increment in
creativity.

780
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,650
CreatIvity seems to me to be,
seems to be fundamentally a,

781
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:58,630
uh,
like it's a cardinal personality trait

782
00:38:58,631 --> 00:39:01,180
that's associated with openness.
It's also associated with high

783
00:39:01,181 --> 00:39:04,540
intelligence.
It's actually quite rare and there's no

784
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:08,290
evidence whatsoever that,
that diversity increases workplace

785
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:09,130
creativity,
not,

786
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:12,010
not that I know of.
Adding to the effective and efficient

787
00:39:12,011 --> 00:39:15,220
delivery of servers services to a
diverse client population.

788
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,440
Well,
those are stated as facts and I don't

789
00:39:17,441 --> 00:39:19,480
think there's,
I think the evidence for them is weak at

790
00:39:19,481 --> 00:39:21,610
best and nonexistent at worst.

791
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,950
And,
and that they're sorry,

792
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:24,880
that false,
those are false claims.

793
00:39:24,881 --> 00:39:26,720
At worse,
the evidence for them is,

794
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,800
is nonexistent at best or weak.
And inclusive organizational culture is

795
00:39:32,171 --> 00:39:34,210
one in which the values of equity,
diversity,

796
00:39:34,211 --> 00:39:34,961
inclusion,
see,

797
00:39:34,961 --> 00:39:37,960
those have got to be the only values and
I can tell you as well that those are

798
00:39:37,961 --> 00:39:40,760
associated with trait agreeableness.
So basically what these,

799
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,810
these ideologies are expressions of,
uh,

800
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,713
of,
uh,

801
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:44,741
the,
uh,

802
00:39:44,741 --> 00:39:48,300
of an underlying personality trait.
They're like the,

803
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,800
the,
the ideological expression is the

804
00:39:50,801 --> 00:39:53,250
mouthpiece of the trait.
And so people who are very high and

805
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:56,710
traits like agreeableness are very
likely to hold this sort of a value

806
00:39:56,711 --> 00:39:58,720
structure.
And then there are positing it as an

807
00:39:58,721 --> 00:40:00,760
absolute.
It's not an absolute because there are

808
00:40:00,761 --> 00:40:05,761
at least five dimensions of personality
that are associated with values that are

809
00:40:05,801 --> 00:40:07,660
necessary for people to live a balanced
life.

810
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,040
So agaIn,
that's a specious claim.

811
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,030
An inclusive organizational culture is
one in which the values of equity,

812
00:40:13,031 --> 00:40:15,040
diversity,
inclusion are reflected in both the

813
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:17,920
formal structure and in the informal
practices and norms.

814
00:40:17,921 --> 00:40:20,290
Okay,
so her basic claim is that what she's

815
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:24,040
going to do is to come in and help you
ensure that the hierarchy of values in

816
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:26,290
your organization is transformed.
So that equity,

817
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:27,940
diversity,
inclusion are at the top.

818
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,940
And it's not obvious to me at all that
those are the

819
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,080
values that should be at the top of any
given organization.

820
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:39,580
And certainly even if they are among the
highest values of an organization,

821
00:40:39,581 --> 00:40:42,460
there are many other organizations,
many other values that should be

822
00:40:42,461 --> 00:40:46,570
considered at least of equal importance,
especially in an organization like the

823
00:40:46,571 --> 00:40:49,240
university of toronto.
That in principle is aiming at

824
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:52,360
excellence in such an organizational
culture.

825
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:54,640
All employees feel respected,
comfortable,

826
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,310
and are able to bring their,
his or her,

827
00:40:57,311 --> 00:40:59,530
their full self to work and have it
valued.

828
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,490
Yeah,
sure.

829
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:02,740
No,
don't buy it because I don't think that

830
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:08,250
this emphasis on diversity,
equity and inclusion has help employees

831
00:41:08,501 --> 00:41:11,290
feel respected,
comfortable and valued,

832
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,860
or that that is what makes them able to
bring their full self to work and have

833
00:41:14,861 --> 00:41:18,280
it valued propositions,
not facts not supported by the data.

834
00:41:18,281 --> 00:41:20,920
As far as I knoW,
research hasn't been done that would

835
00:41:20,921 --> 00:41:23,710
indicate that any of this is true.
So as far as I'm concerned,

836
00:41:23,711 --> 00:41:27,790
it's basically political cliche and it's
ill advised at best they are then able

837
00:41:27,791 --> 00:41:29,650
to contribute their best to the
organization.

838
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,521
Yeah,
it could be,

839
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:31,750
but probably not.
I'd had.

840
00:41:31,751 --> 00:41:34,010
I don't think there's any evidence for.
And I know the literature

841
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,230
by the way,
so if anybody would like to have a

842
00:41:36,231 --> 00:41:38,360
debate about this,
I'd be perfectly willing to,

843
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,860
uh,
to do so.

844
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:42,050
So.
Okay.

845
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:47,110
Next.
So this is what else she does to address

846
00:41:47,121 --> 00:41:49,310
the governance needs of an inclusive
organization.

847
00:41:49,311 --> 00:41:51,620
Our services include tools,
techniques,

848
00:41:51,621 --> 00:41:55,370
and assistance such as assessing
existing diversity among board members

849
00:41:55,371 --> 00:41:58,900
to establish a benchmark,
developing a board recruitment process

850
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:03,410
that incorporates her definition of
diversity and tailoring board documents

851
00:42:03,411 --> 00:42:05,750
and statements to be more inclusive.
So it's,

852
00:42:05,751 --> 00:42:07,070
it's the,
it's the,

853
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,850
it's the dissemination of a politically
correct viewpoint through absolutely

854
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:14,750
every level of the organization.
We also provide training to board

855
00:42:14,751 --> 00:42:18,200
members and offer board manuals to help
board members understand and integrate

856
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:22,520
issues related to her definition of
diversity into their decision making,

857
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:26,180
so that's what she offers and she worked
on her,

858
00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:31,040
conducted 22 employment systems reviews,
so that's how widespread her influences

859
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:34,280
for a number of private nonprofit and
public sector organizations.

860
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:37,940
She also developed and delivered human
rights and here we go.

861
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,230
Unconscious bias training and what she
actually means by that is training

862
00:42:42,231 --> 00:42:47,231
against unconscious bias and already
laid out my objections to the idea of

863
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:51,470
trading against unconscious bias.
Really like this is a terrible thing.

864
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:55,040
We do not understand this anywhere near
well enough for people to go around

865
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:58,040
telling themselves and offering their
services for sale.

866
00:42:58,041 --> 00:42:58,521
Saying,
look,

867
00:42:58,521 --> 00:43:01,430
I Can come Into your organization and
help your employees reduce their

868
00:43:01,431 --> 00:43:06,140
unconscious bias and then also to accuse
your employees of having unconscious

869
00:43:06,141 --> 00:43:09,680
bias to a degree that necessitates their
retraining.

870
00:43:09,681 --> 00:43:11,290
That's an awful thing to do it.
It's,

871
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:14,030
it is the presumption of guilt or
innocence and it's the presumption,

872
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,900
the presumption of a kind of guilt that
no one can escape from being accused of.

873
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,560
It's absolutely appalling.
So conducted program reviews,

874
00:43:21,561 --> 00:43:24,710
conducted gender equity analysis,
etc. So anyway,

875
00:43:24,711 --> 00:43:27,800
so that's the sort of person who's going
to be doing the training and I guess

876
00:43:27,801 --> 00:43:32,801
that's not really all that surprising.
Next person is.

877
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,010
Oh,
one other thing.

878
00:43:35,011 --> 00:43:37,610
So this is tina turner.
Here's one of the things that she sells

879
00:43:37,611 --> 00:43:40,820
on her website.
It's called

880
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:46,840
defeating unconscious bias.
It's a dvd or usb,

881
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:50,930
it's for the lovely price of 775 to
$825.

882
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:54,860
Defeating unconscious bias is designed
to address the hidden biases that can

883
00:43:54,861 --> 00:43:56,660
affect hiring,
promoting and team building.

884
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:58,880
And that challenge,
your ability to create an inclusive

885
00:43:58,881 --> 00:43:59,900
workplace.
Yeah.

886
00:43:59,901 --> 00:44:01,280
Well,
I don't think so.

887
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:03,590
Sorry.
I don't believe that that's something

888
00:44:03,591 --> 00:44:06,890
that can be done yet and I think that
people who claim that they can do it,

889
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:10,400
um,
well you can make up your own mind about

890
00:44:10,401 --> 00:44:12,150
that.
Alright,

891
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:17,260
so next.
All right,

892
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:26,810
so the final one is the assumption,
the assumption that training programs of

893
00:44:26,811 --> 00:44:30,530
this type would be effective.
So let's assume that there is a problem

894
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:32,100
at the university of toronto

895
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:36,120
with racism and bias even though I don't
think there is not particularly,

896
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,390
um,
then the next and then let's assume that

897
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:41,940
the people that,
that,

898
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:46,260
that we're going to bring people in to
train everyone out of their racism and

899
00:44:46,261 --> 00:44:48,210
bias,
unconscious or otherwise,

900
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:52,350
then we might have to ensure that we're
going to have to buy the idea that this

901
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,910
sort of training is effective.
Okay.

902
00:44:53,911 --> 00:44:58,140
Well no problem except here except this.
So if you're a clinician and a research

903
00:44:58,141 --> 00:45:01,230
scientist say like me,
one of the things that you've learned is

904
00:45:01,231 --> 00:45:05,730
that you do not put in place and
intervention without assessing its

905
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:08,520
outcome.
And the reason for that is because there

906
00:45:08,521 --> 00:45:11,910
have been well publicized failures of
social science interventions,

907
00:45:11,911 --> 00:45:13,950
which I would,
and I would consider this sort of

908
00:45:13,951 --> 00:45:18,390
training exactly that it falls under the
same rubric because it's an educational

909
00:45:18,391 --> 00:45:19,740
or a psychological intervention.

910
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:22,650
There've been well documented
catastrophic failures of such

911
00:45:22,651 --> 00:45:24,570
interventions in the past.
One of the most famous,

912
00:45:24,571 --> 00:45:26,820
one of those was called the somerville
study,

913
00:45:26,821 --> 00:45:30,560
which was done in the 19 thirties.
A woman named joan mccord.

914
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:33,210
Uh,
a very good criminologist conducted a

915
00:45:33,211 --> 00:45:35,610
lot of the,
the followup research to the somerville

916
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:40,350
study and the somerville study was an
attempt to take kids who are in a kind

917
00:45:40,351 --> 00:45:44,280
of rough inner city neighborhoods and
put them through psychological and

918
00:45:44,281 --> 00:45:49,170
sociological interventions to reduce
their risk of especially of crime in the

919
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:51,750
later years of their life.
And actually what happened was that the

920
00:45:51,751 --> 00:45:53,790
intervention,
although very carefully designed and I

921
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:57,840
would say admirably designed and also
designed by people who I did do think

922
00:45:57,841 --> 00:46:01,830
had the best interest of the kids at
mind in mind or at heart.

923
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:05,520
My consequences were that the kids who
were in the intervention program

924
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,120
actually ended up being more criminal
than the kids that weren't,

925
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:10,950
and there's a large literature on this.

926
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:13,890
It was a very shocking study at a
particular set of the people who did it.

927
00:46:13,891 --> 00:46:16,950
It's a classic and and it's not the
only.

928
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:21,840
It's not the only study of its type.
Now I'm posting the introduction to this

929
00:46:21,841 --> 00:46:24,420
book was written by joan mccord called
crime and family.

930
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:28,110
There's two chapters in that book that's
the selected writings of john mccord,

931
00:46:28,111 --> 00:46:30,510
one's called the cambridge somerville
study,

932
00:46:30,511 --> 00:46:33,900
a pioneering longitudinal experimental
study of delinquency prevention,

933
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:39,380
and then chapter four is cures that harm
unanticipated outcomes of crime

934
00:46:39,391 --> 00:46:41,910
prevention programs.
While that could be of any kind of

935
00:46:41,911 --> 00:46:44,540
prevention program,
so I'll post the introduction so that

936
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:47,040
you guys can read that,
but my point is quite clear.

937
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:49,950
You have an intervention.
You think there's a problem,

938
00:46:49,951 --> 00:46:53,190
you design an intervention.
Well then it's incumbent on you to

939
00:46:53,191 --> 00:46:56,760
demonstrate carefully that the intention
that the intervention produces its

940
00:46:56,761 --> 00:46:59,580
desired effects because there's a high
probability that it won't.

941
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,530
In fact,
there's a high probability that will

942
00:47:01,531 --> 00:47:05,610
produce the word reverse effect,
so for all the hr department knows their

943
00:47:05,611 --> 00:47:10,440
mandatory training program could make
people more racist and more biased and I

944
00:47:10,441 --> 00:47:15,441
would say the mere fact that the
training is mandatory is highly likely

945
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:18,120
to produce precisely that outcome
because it's going to generate

946
00:47:18,121 --> 00:47:20,940
resentment among people,
even people who are going who,

947
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,730
who would be relatively unwilling to
express that resentment.

948
00:47:23,731 --> 00:47:26,730
So my hypothesis would be as a scientist
and a researcher,

949
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:29,950
if I was conducting this as an
experiment that heidi to have two

950
00:47:29,951 --> 00:47:30,784
conditions

951
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:33,340
voluntary and mandatory.
Although I wouldn't be allowed to do

952
00:47:33,341 --> 00:47:35,230
that because that would be unethical by
the way,

953
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:37,860
according to the will.
That would be an.

954
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:42,670
That would be unethical research,
but I would test to see if mandatory

955
00:47:42,671 --> 00:47:46,210
trading and voluntary trading had
different effects and my guess is that

956
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:49,000
mandatory training would kick back and
it would reverse the effects of the

957
00:47:49,001 --> 00:47:50,620
training.
But we don't care about that sort of

958
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:52,480
thing.
When we put policy like this into place

959
00:47:52,481 --> 00:47:54,430
because we already assume that we know
what we're doing.

960
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:59,530
And partly we do that because we know so
little about what we're doing that we

961
00:47:59,531 --> 00:48:02,350
can't even see what sort of mistakes we
might be making.

962
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,270
We just make assumptions.
There is racism,

963
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:06,550
we know where it is.
We have a training program,

964
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:08,980
the training program,
we'll fix the racism and then things

965
00:48:08,981 --> 00:48:11,320
will be better and it doesn't matter if
we make it mandatory.

966
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:11,980
It's like,
sorry,

967
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:14,500
none of those propositions are viable.
There are all debatable.

968
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:18,490
They all need to be tested and they're
all dangerous in that they might produce

969
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,680
a,
an unintended consequence,

970
00:48:20,681 --> 00:48:23,080
a negative consequence,
and that there's lots of reason in the

971
00:48:23,081 --> 00:48:25,030
literature to assume that that might be
the case.

972
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:27,250
So I'll post that.
You guys can read it.

973
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,113
You can think about it.

974
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:35,410
Marilyn charles.
So she's the one along with tan and

975
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:36,800
turner who's going to be doing the
training.

976
00:48:36,801 --> 00:48:39,440
Couldn't find out that much about her.
Um,

977
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:42,650
she's a sessional lecturer at the
ontario institute of studies on

978
00:48:42,651 --> 00:48:44,750
education.
I guess I need to say something about

979
00:48:44,751 --> 00:48:48,280
noisy.
I think that educational psychology is a

980
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:50,390
extraordinarily fad,
written discipline.

981
00:48:50,391 --> 00:48:52,610
I think the level of scholarship is
appallingly low.

982
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:55,550
Um,
I can identify a number of fads that,

983
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:57,440
that,
that rushed through the educational

984
00:48:57,441 --> 00:48:58,850
system,
a lot of it pushed through by

985
00:48:58,851 --> 00:49:01,100
educational psychologists over the last
20 years.

986
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:04,250
The idea of practical intelligence,
that's one of them,

987
00:49:04,251 --> 00:49:07,100
the idea of whole word reading,
which was a catastrophe in the

988
00:49:07,101 --> 00:49:09,320
California school system.
That was another,

989
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:12,500
the notion that self esteem training,
that self esteem even exists,

990
00:49:12,501 --> 00:49:14,420
which I don't think it does technically
speaking.

991
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:16,790
I think it's a very fundamentally have
trait.

992
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:18,650
Neuroticism,
which isn't really movable.

993
00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:20,080
Um,
there's,

994
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,600
there's some reasonable evidence that
self esteem training turn children into

995
00:49:23,601 --> 00:49:26,090
narcissists rather than increasing their
self esteem.

996
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,880
Um,
and I don't think there's any evidence

997
00:49:28,881 --> 00:49:32,060
that the self esteem programs had the
desired effect.

998
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,100
Um,
so there's a variety of,

999
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:34,960
of.
Oh,

1000
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,550
and then there's also the idea of
multiple intelligences,

1001
00:49:37,551 --> 00:49:40,490
which is an absolutely specious idea
from a scientific perspective.

1002
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:44,600
So educational psychology is
unbelievably fad written and so,

1003
00:49:44,601 --> 00:49:46,910
and noisy is a major offender in that
regard.

1004
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:48,290
Um,
anyways,

1005
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:49,280
merlin,
charles is,

1006
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:52,720
it has a phd in education and,
and the reason I'm bringing up the fad

1007
00:49:52,721 --> 00:49:55,850
written issue is because she's a
specialist in what's called holistic

1008
00:49:55,851 --> 00:49:58,670
education.
It's a philosophy of education based on

1009
00:49:58,671 --> 00:50:02,390
the premise that each person finds
identity meaning and purpose in life's

1010
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:05,170
through connections to the community,
to the natural world entity,

1011
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:08,360
humanitarian values such as compassion
and peace,

1012
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:09,800
which,
which,

1013
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,580
which I would say also those values are
reflective of trait agreeableness by the

1014
00:50:13,581 --> 00:50:14,720
way,
especially compassion,

1015
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,680
holistic education names to call forth
from people and intrinsic reverence for

1016
00:50:18,681 --> 00:50:20,570
life and a passionate love of learning.
Well,

1017
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,360
to me that's all cliche fundamentally.
Um,

1018
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:24,580
and,
and I,

1019
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:27,920
I sold the fact that she's a specialist
in education,

1020
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:32,570
does not indicate to me that she holds
the qualifications necessary to serve as

1021
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:35,960
an advisor to,
to policymakers at the university of

1022
00:50:35,961 --> 00:50:36,980
toronto.
So,

1023
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:42,490
so why is the university of toronto
listening to these individuals and

1024
00:50:42,491 --> 00:50:43,670
groups?
Uh,

1025
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,220
I Think there was a lot of reasons for
it,

1026
00:50:45,221 --> 00:50:49,030
but I think one of them is that it's
because they effectively present

1027
00:50:49,031 --> 00:50:52,570
themselves as oppressed or as experts in
oppression.

1028
00:50:52,571 --> 00:50:53,470
And that's enough,

1029
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:04,550
and one of the things we might further
discusses what value should be being

1030
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:06,620
supported,
presented out the university.

1031
00:51:06,621 --> 00:51:11,621
And right now the pc onslaught is,
is predicated on the idea that the

1032
00:51:12,291 --> 00:51:15,710
fundamental values are equity,
diversity and inclusion.

1033
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:20,360
And what I find troublesome about that
is two fold,

1034
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:25,580
one that that's a very one sided
hierarchy of values and I mean that

1035
00:51:25,581 --> 00:51:29,720
technically because it's the values that
agreeable people would hold as as,

1036
00:51:29,721 --> 00:51:30,980
um,
sacrosanct.

1037
00:51:30,981 --> 00:51:33,860
And there's other sets of values that
have to be included in a properly

1038
00:51:33,861 --> 00:51:38,590
function in value hierarchy,
in order for individuals and for society

1039
00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:42,290
to stay balanced.
And I would say that what also needs to

1040
00:51:42,291 --> 00:51:45,830
be included at the university are the
values associated with

1041
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:48,500
conscientiousness,
which would be roughly competence,

1042
00:51:48,501 --> 00:51:51,140
excellence and quality,
and also of openness,

1043
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:56,141
which is creative free inquiry.
And so those have to be considered at

1044
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,060
least as important and arguably as more
important.

1045
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:04,460
The other thing that bothers me is that
the definitions of equity and diversity

1046
00:52:04,461 --> 00:52:09,461
and inclusion are defined by precisely
the criteria that the social justice

1047
00:52:09,531 --> 00:52:13,370
warrior and pc types believe are
responsible in some sense.

1048
00:52:13,371 --> 00:52:17,000
For all the ills in society and that
we're asking,

1049
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:20,300
we're,
we're being required to construe

1050
00:52:20,301 --> 00:52:22,670
ourselves in terms of our group
identity,

1051
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:25,040
whatever that group might be,
age,

1052
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:25,970
gender,
race,

1053
00:52:25,971 --> 00:52:28,400
ethnicity,
sexual preference,

1054
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,070
sexual expression,
gender expression,

1055
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:34,610
gender identity,
and Undoubtedly a plethora of new terms

1056
00:52:34,611 --> 00:52:37,370
to come.
We're being asked to accept those,

1057
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:39,380
um,
divisions as,

1058
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:42,440
as,
as indicative of indicative of the

1059
00:52:42,441 --> 00:52:46,710
fundamental differences between us.
and then to assume that the only way

1060
00:52:46,711 --> 00:52:51,140
that that you can judge whether or not a
society is fuNctioning properly is to

1061
00:52:51,141 --> 00:52:55,220
determine whether everY person where
were there,

1062
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:59,120
all of those categories are represented
numerically,

1063
00:52:59,121 --> 00:53:02,420
equally in every single situation.
Well,

1064
00:53:02,421 --> 00:53:03,200
you know,
it's a,

1065
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,530
it's a,
it's a poor game that and Uh,

1066
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:10,250
it's part of the pc game and I'm going
to release a video on the pc game,

1067
00:53:10,251 --> 00:53:12,380
a short one to define exactly what that
is.

1068
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:16,070
So,
okay,

1069
00:53:16,071 --> 00:53:19,140
so what might be done about such things?
That would be the next question in,

1070
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:21,140
in this particular case,
what should be done?

1071
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:25,110
Well,
I would say that her staff at the

1072
00:53:25,111 --> 00:53:25,980
university of toronto

1073
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:30,300
and and also and people everywhere
should refuse to subject themselves to

1074
00:53:30,301 --> 00:53:34,560
reeducation regarding their putative
racism and bias unless they want to

1075
00:53:34,561 --> 00:53:38,310
convict themselves by attending and I
think that's exactly what they're doing

1076
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:43,340
is that if you're forced to undergo such
training and you agree,

1077
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:47,850
then by the fact that you attend,
you agree that the intervention is

1078
00:53:47,851 --> 00:53:51,210
justified and I'm.
I know that it's difficult for people to

1079
00:53:51,211 --> 00:53:55,110
stand up against this sort of thing,
but I don't think it's as difficult as

1080
00:53:55,111 --> 00:53:59,790
people presume at least in in impossible
in at least possibly because I think

1081
00:53:59,791 --> 00:54:02,640
that the people who are pushing this
sort of thing are actually not very

1082
00:54:02,641 --> 00:54:04,590
brave.
I mean they construe themselves

1083
00:54:04,591 --> 00:54:09,190
continually as victims and I have a
sneaking suspicion that if people push

1084
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:12,840
back with any degree of firmness that
they would back off very,

1085
00:54:12,841 --> 00:54:15,140
very rapidly.
But we need to find out because these,

1086
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,950
this sort of thing has to be stopped
now.

1087
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:21,810
It can be still be stopped by peaceful
means and and I don't think that that's

1088
00:54:21,811 --> 00:54:24,630
going to be the case in 10 years if
things continue the way they are,

1089
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:29,250
so it's time for people to stand up
using peaceful means and here's some

1090
00:54:29,251 --> 00:54:33,750
ways you should contact some of the
people in charge and all of your

1091
00:54:33,751 --> 00:54:37,770
organization or in this case,
the university of toronto and express

1092
00:54:37,771 --> 00:54:40,630
your concern and you should do it.
You should say what you have to say in a

1093
00:54:40,631 --> 00:54:43,950
cool headed,
clear and well articulated manner.

1094
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:48,210
And you assumed to begin with
rationality and goodwill on the part of

1095
00:54:48,211 --> 00:54:50,040
the recipients.
Um,

1096
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:53,160
you can consider that assumption,
an act of courage on your part.

1097
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,660
If you can't formulate your own words,
then you can tell them that you found

1098
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:00,570
the arguments in this video convincing
and maybe you want to highlight one or

1099
00:55:00,571 --> 00:55:00,930
two of them.

1100
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:04,220
I gave eight different arguments.
You could send them the link might,

1101
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:07,320
might also be interesting to ask these
people how much the university is

1102
00:55:07,321 --> 00:55:09,960
planning to pay for these training
sessions because that's something I'd be

1103
00:55:09,961 --> 00:55:13,350
very interested in knowing.
So I think it's something that,

1104
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:14,243
that,
that,

1105
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:17,190
that's,
that's a valid manner matter for public

1106
00:55:17,191 --> 00:55:18,620
debate.
All right.

1107
00:55:18,621 --> 00:55:22,140
And so here's the,
here's the connections of the people,

1108
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:27,250
the contact information that would
enable you to contact the people who

1109
00:55:27,271 --> 00:55:29,610
are,
are responsible for the policies.

1110
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:32,730
Here they are.
So the first is erin jackson.

1111
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:36,450
She's the executive director,
internal resources,

1112
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,330
internal human resources.
I took a look at her credentials.

1113
00:55:39,331 --> 00:55:43,020
She has a bachelor's degree with an
advanced certificate from the rodman

1114
00:55:43,021 --> 00:55:46,980
advanced program in human resources
management and I can't see that,

1115
00:55:46,981 --> 00:55:50,520
that level,
that level of qualification ensures that

1116
00:55:50,521 --> 00:55:55,521
she has the expertise necessary to
evaluate the effectiveness of the kind

1117
00:55:55,581 --> 00:55:57,720
of program that she's considering
putting in place.

1118
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:01,060
So that's erin jackson.
She's at aaron dot jackson,

1119
00:56:01,061 --> 00:56:02,640
that you toronto dot,
ca.

1120
00:56:03,150 --> 00:56:07,440
And then she works for angela hilliard
who's the vice president of human

1121
00:56:07,441 --> 00:56:10,060
resources and equity.
Uh,

1122
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:15,290
angela dot hilliard@utoronto.ca.
And then finally up above at the highest

1123
00:56:17,821 --> 00:56:19,650
plateau is the president of the
university,

1124
00:56:19,651 --> 00:56:22,860
dr merrick hitler.
And you can reach him at,

1125
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:27,580
at u toronto.ca.
So I would say email these folks,

1126
00:56:27,581 --> 00:56:29,710
if you email one of them,
email all three of them,

1127
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:33,250
express your concern,
and I would also say to the hr staff

1128
00:56:33,251 --> 00:56:37,390
that's going to be affected by this,
that you should make your opposition

1129
00:56:37,391 --> 00:56:42,391
known unless you agree to convict
yourself of your racism and bias by

1130
00:56:42,491 --> 00:56:45,430
attending,
and if enough of you did it,

1131
00:56:45,431 --> 00:56:48,730
it would come to a halt.
At least at least it could be put

1132
00:56:48,731 --> 00:56:51,610
forward that this program should not be
mandatory.

1133
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,430
Okay.
So thank you very much for listening.

1134
00:56:54,431 --> 00:56:56,740
and soon enough I'll put up lecture
three,

1135
00:56:56,741 --> 00:57:01,390
which is going to be a very pragmatic
and focused lecture on tactics that can

1136
00:57:01,391 --> 00:57:04,140
be used to push back against the
political correct,

1137
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,210
against political,
correct excesses.

1138
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:09,490
Bye for now.
