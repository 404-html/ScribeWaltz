00:00:18,711 --> 00:00:19,544
Don't come.
Professor Jordan Peterson is a clinical 

3
00:00:24,851 --> 00:00:28,470
psychologist,
licensed in Massachusetts and Ontario.

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,840
He's also a professor at the University 
of Toronto and has been so since 1998.

5
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,950
Professor beaters in is currently 
interested in the formula assessment and

6
00:00:39,951 --> 00:00:40,784
theoretical nature of self deception,
construing it as the voluntary failure 

7
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,170
of exploration rather than as 
repression.

8
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,740
He's also doing experimental work on 
creativity,

9
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,780
achievement,
personality,

10
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,000
narrative,
and motivation.

For the next hour,

12
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:03,160
we'll be Guy Lee.

13
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:13,130
Welcome to this edition of Astoria 
magazine and Web radio.

14
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,930
We're delighted to have here with us 
clinical psychologist,

15
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:17,803
professor Jordan Peterson.
He's going to be telling us about his 

16
00:01:20,901 --> 00:01:24,110
amazing book,
maps of meaning.

17
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,610
Now,
first of all,

18
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,070
Professor Peterson,
welcome.

19
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,790
How are you?
Great.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,930
Could you please tell us a bit first of 
all about your background?

21
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:35,883
Well,
I'm a clinical psychologist trained at 

22
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:41,320
mcgill university.
I've been working as a professor.

23
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,613
I
taught at Harvard University in the 

24
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:49,510
psychology department for six years,
and then I moved to Toronto.

25
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:57,540
I also do consulting work for a variety 
of different companies.

26
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,053
Probably the most widely read book on 
psychology for the novice reader was 

27
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,143
young's masterpiece man and his symbols.
Are you approaching a general audience 

28
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:20,240
with this book or your book maps of 
meaning,

29
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:24,620
or is this more suited to the students 
of psychology?

30
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,380
Well,
I think it's suited for people who would

31
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,223
like assembled and
even the ones that were written for a 

32
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:35,094
general audience,
we're not particularly simple because 

33
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:42,030
they're so different in conception,
but I would say maps of meaning is aimed

34
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:45,680
at the same audience that those books 
were aimed at.

35
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,040
Other similar to two books by Eric 
Norman,

36
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:50,874
who was a very astute student of youngs 
and who took kills thought farther in 

37
00:02:56,821 --> 00:02:57,654
some directions than young had.
So I guess I see my work in part as an 

38
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:05,560
extension of a young's work and Norman's
work.

39
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,620
I'm partly into the domain of 
neuropsychology

40
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,200
luminaries such as when a
philosophical investigations in 1953,

41
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:24,040
for instance,
where again,

42
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,233
he attempted to layout the apparent 
structure of the mind and the 

43
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:31,840
conditioning with cultural and 
historical variables.

44
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:35,470
Would that be true to say you've moved 
on from that and expanded it even more

45
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,473
contributions?
Was the idea that was more like a a 

46
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:46,710
piece in a chess game than it was like a
label for an object and

47
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,183
perspective.
Words were always to do things with 

48
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,013
rather than to label things with and a 
conception that I share because most of 

49
00:03:57,931 --> 00:03:58,764
our concepts,
scientists like to think that our 

50
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:03,450
concepts are very much like theories 
about object.

51
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,480
But in reality our concepts are much 
more action oriented that not.

52
00:04:08,911 --> 00:04:09,744
I mean we know for example,
that when you look at even our simple 

53
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:13,674
object like a cop,
the brain areas that are involved in 

54
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,430
motor action are activated at the level 
of perception.

55
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,860
So for example,
when you look at a cup,

56
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,993
the gripping action that your hand would
make if you lifted up the cop is 

57
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,590
partially activated merely when your 
eyes a settle on the cup itself.

58
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,053
So,
and Vichtenstein was the first 

59
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:37,763
philosopher,
although Nisha knew this to some degree 

60
00:04:39,121 --> 00:04:39,954
to can spend,
was the first philosopher to really 

61
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:45,780
point out the functional quality of our 
object categories.

62
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,273
And,
uh,

63
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,233
my work overlaps with his ideas to some 
degree because one of my preconceptions 

64
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,190
that mythological ideals,
ideas and concepts are functional.

65
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,370
They're to do things with their,
to act about.

66
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,560
They're not to label,
they're not descriptive.

67
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:09,210
Like scientific concept is a.
that's why religious mythology has to do

68
00:05:09,211 --> 00:05:11,940
with morality because morality is about 
action.

69
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,660
What is the relationship to human 
consciousness in say,

70
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,520
the treatment of mental illness,
for instance,

71
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:29,521
of what we classify in the western 
concept as mental illness?

72
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:30,510
Well,
let's,

73
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,343
let's start with a question about dreams
mean there's a lot of debate in the 

74
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:40,080
scientific literature about the meaning 
of dreams.

75
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,790
And perhaps there's even debate about 
whether to have meaning.

76
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,093
I think partly the debate exists because
to do dream analysis properly as young 

77
00:05:52,501 --> 00:05:54,530
in particular pointed out,
uh,

78
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,403
you need a vast body of knowledge in the
dream interpreter about comparative 

79
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:06,431
mythology and ritual and symbol and,
and art history and so forth.

80
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:08,594
Because dreams of course,
use images as their primary means of 

81
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:14,540
conceptualization.
Now,

82
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,873
in order to understand what what dreams 
mean and how they can be useful in 

83
00:06:20,151 --> 00:06:20,984
therapy,
apart from appreciating the fact that 

84
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,303
the interpreter needs a broad body of 
knowledge that scientists generally 

85
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:30,044
don't develop,
it's also important to know what it is 

86
00:06:33,111 --> 00:06:35,720
that scientists have discovered about 
dreams.

87
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,613
So for example,
we know that dreams occur during rapid 

88
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:44,360
eye movement sleep.
You cycle into rapid eye movement,

89
00:06:44,361 --> 00:06:47,120
sleep about every 90 minutes when you're
asleep,

90
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,990
when you're in rapid eye movement,
sleep,

91
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,543
your motor centers,
so your action centers are very much 

92
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:56,714
activated in your brain,
but your body is paralyzed so that you 

93
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:00,380
can't move around.

94
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,433
Your eyes are moving because of course 
it doesn't really matter if your eyes 

95
00:07:05,871 --> 00:07:08,960
move while you're asleep because they 
won't take you anywhere,

96
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,090
but if your legs were moving while you 
were asleep,

97
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:13,640
you run into walls while you were 
dreaming,

98
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,474
and scientists have actually managed to 
damage the motor inhibition systems in 

99
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:26,741
cats so that they do move around when 
they're dreaming anyways.

100
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,263
If you wake up when someone's dreaming,
their brain is about as active as it is 

101
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:34,880
when they're awake.
So there's a tremendous amount of neural

102
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:35,714
processing going on in the dream state.
If you wake someone up when they're 

103
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:39,974
dreaming,
there's about an 80 percent chance that 

104
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:42,944
they'll report the emotion of anxiety.
Dreams tend to focus on threat 

105
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:50,060
processing.
Now,

106
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,990
a threat is anything that might hurt 
you,

107
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,453
but it's more than that to a threat is 
anything that doesn't fit into your 

108
00:07:57,801 --> 00:07:58,634
current conceptual scheme,
so imagine that you have a theory about 

109
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:02,444
the way the world is and then you act on
that theory and sometimes things work 

110
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:10,070
out the way you'd like them to work out,
but often they don't,

111
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,380
and every time things work out in a way 
that isn't how you would like or how you

112
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:16,214
predicted that indicates that there's 
some more about the world that you have 

113
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:25,510
to learn about and that fact first 
manifests itself in anxiety.

114
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,520
Now the dream focuses on anxiety and 
then it loosens up.

115
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,920
It's the normal conceptual constraints 
that characterize waking thinking and it

116
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:39,134
starts to a play in a sense or 
hypothesize about how your current 

117
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:45,614
categorical structure could be shifted 
around so that that threat could be 

118
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:51,260
accounted for.
Okay,

119
00:08:51,261 --> 00:08:55,830
now that means the dream is dealing with
things that you need to understand,

120
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:00,420
but you don't yet understand,
so when you wake up and you remember the

121
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:01,254
dream,
the dream doesn't really make sense 

122
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:04,920
because it's about something you don't 
understand.

123
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,593
Now it's your brain's best guess at 
configuring or understanding the 

124
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:11,724
unknowable,
but it's like it's like the first layer 

125
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:15,894
of a multilayered process which 
eventually would culminate in fully 

126
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:23,850
developed thought,
maybe over months or maybe over years,

127
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:25,650
or maybe you would never manage it at 
all.

128
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:26,643
The unknown thing or the threat is just 
too great to really come to any terms 

129
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:32,130
with it whatsoever.
Okay?

130
00:09:32,131 --> 00:09:36,950
Now imagine that you're dreaming about 
something and it produces enough emotion

131
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:37,903
with the threat produces enough emotion,
not only to produce a very vivid dream 

132
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,380
but to wake you up.
When you wake up,

133
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:46,740
you remember the dream and then you go 
tell someone about it.

134
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:48,803
Well,
the dream is about something you don't 

135
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:54,330
yet understand that it's upsetting and 
if you tell a bunch of people about it,

136
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:55,164
they're going to give you all sorts of 
opinions on the dream and that's a way 

137
00:09:57,871 --> 00:10:00,330
that you can gather more information 
about the threat,

138
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,780
which is known as a nightmare.
Cynthia dream,

139
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:11,781
which is I'm traveling all puzzling 
because it's so abstract.

140
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,320
Could you differentiate?

141
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,940
I think it's clearer in the case of 
nightmares and often too,

142
00:10:17,941 --> 00:10:20,640
because nightmares tend to have 
archetipal themes.

143
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,590
You know?
People for example,

144
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,424
are often threatened by monsters at 
night and a monster is a chi mirror 

145
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,570
that's made up of the different parts of
different parts of frightening things.

146
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,860
A dragon is a camera,
for example,

147
00:10:34,861 --> 00:10:35,694
because it's made out of reptilian parts
and it also includes the idea of fire 

148
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:41,964
and transformation,
so a nightmare is that a dream that 

149
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:47,304
tends to use archetypal imagery to 
conceptualize a fairly powerful threat 

150
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:57,110
and if you recount a nightmare to a 
person with no specific training,

151
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:58,224
they're going to have some opinion about
it and their opinion might be useful in 

152
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:03,360
terms of information,
Katherine,

153
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,703
but if you recount a dream to someone 
who's psychologically trained and his 

154
00:11:07,531 --> 00:11:08,364
also symbolically trained and who has 
great great depth of knowledge with 

155
00:11:12,181 --> 00:11:16,740
regards to the structure of religious 
thinking and comparative literature,

156
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,933
the light that they're going to shed on 
your dream is much brighter and more 

157
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:24,880
profound.
And sometimes a,

158
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:29,430
a dream interpretation can offer the 
person who's had the dream,

159
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,563
a leap forward in knowledge that might 
have taken them five or six years to 

160
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:35,340
conceptualize by themselves.

161
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,120
You might say that they wouldn't 
ordinarily have had.

162
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:45,121
Because the person who's the expert 
who's had the knows and says,

163
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,813
Oh yes,
I know of that place that had been to 

164
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,820
that experience.
They've had that symbol and it's.

165
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,333
And the bubble,

166
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,700
what it feels like because of surely it 
is,

167
00:11:57,701 --> 00:12:00,580
um,
some people say that me included,

168
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,713
I'm that one way to interpret a dream 
when you wake up is just to just like 

169
00:12:06,131 --> 00:12:11,131
you would taste a sip of wine,
just hold the flavor and,

170
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:15,160
and hold the feeling.
What does it feel like?

171
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,070
What does feel,
what feels the same in your real life?

172
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,023
And that's what the dreams trying to 
tell you with a collage of singles and 

173
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,550
memories as well that is drawn on in 
recent,

174
00:12:26,551 --> 00:12:30,730
I'm conscious experience to try and put 
it together.

175
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:34,360
Hence the dream can be very abstract.
Would you say that's the case sometimes?

176
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,523
Well,
I think there's two things about your 

177
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:40,150
comments that are really worth 
highlighting in.

178
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:40,984
The first is
the category is that a dream uses are 

179
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:49,660
generally based on emotional similarity 
rather than logical similarity.

180
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,430
Yes.

181
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,263
So a dream for example,
might represent fear or the fear of 

182
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:56,274
something unknown by using a 
juxtaposition of a variety of images of 

183
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:00,894
frightening thing.
So imagine that in the dream world the 

184
00:13:03,391 --> 00:13:08,391
basic rule is all things that produced 
the same emotion are the same thing.

185
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,373
And so you're a description of a dream 
interpretation process that relies on 

186
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:19,290
identifying similarities in emotional 
state,

187
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,130
gets right to the core of how dream 
thought works.

188
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:24,840
Now,
secondarily,

189
00:13:24,841 --> 00:13:25,674
I also believe that if you are able to 
help someone or construct a dream 

190
00:13:32,671 --> 00:13:36,960
interpretation that fits there,
also able to feel that it fits,

191
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,323
it clicks or it makes sense,
or it's like the punchline of a joke in 

192
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:44,930
some way they can tell that the 
interpretation have,

193
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,093
uh,
put some missing pieces of the puzzle 

194
00:13:48,181 --> 00:13:49,014
into place.
And I think it's important to rely on 

195
00:13:51,661 --> 00:13:52,494
that as an indicator of whether the 
interpretation is actually derived from 

196
00:13:56,971 --> 00:14:01,290
the dream or sort of just a theoretical 
imposition on its structure.

197
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,373
Now we can go underneath that too.
And I mentioned already that basic 

198
00:14:05,581 --> 00:14:09,630
categories are more action oriented than
object oriented.

199
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,913
So basic categories,
the basic categories of the human mind 

200
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,920
are categories to do things with.
Well,

201
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,053
by the same token,
there also motivational and emotional 

202
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,430
categories.
So the primordial mind,

203
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:27,840
like the animal mind thinks sort of 
axiomatically,

204
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:31,350
that all things that produces the same 
emotion are the same thing.

205
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,053
So there's things that make you happy or
there's things that make you sad or 

206
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:40,410
there's things that make you anxious and
the fact that all those things share the

207
00:14:40,411 --> 00:14:45,411
capacity to evoke that emotion speaks of
some essential identity between them.

208
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:52,850
Now the identity is in relationship to 
the experiencer and not necessarily with

209
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:55,760
regards to similarity between the 
objects,

210
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,013
but it's still how we naturally think 
and it's certainly how mythologies 

211
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:04,780
thinks and it's how drama thinks and how
religion things.

212
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,653
And we've lost sight of that in part 
because we've become scientifically 

213
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:09,494
trained to some degree and we tend to 
believe that the real categories of the 

214
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:16,270
world or object and uh,
that,

215
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,133
that just strikes me as it's wrong.
There's something about it that's wrong 

216
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,790
and it's wrong because we have to act

217
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,270
emotional reactions.
People

218
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,670
response.
For instance,

219
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:38,760
if you take the base emotions,
she only one could go way,

220
00:15:38,831 --> 00:15:39,664
way back to the door.
Navarra beginnings when we came down 

221
00:15:42,821 --> 00:15:46,060
from the trees and move through the 
forest out onto the plains.

222
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,340
Hunter gatherers and animals do share 
this with us because,

223
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:52,570
uh,
uh,

224
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,570
the everyday dog and cat does have 
emotions.

225
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:01,380
Our emotions born out of originally just
pure instinct.

226
00:16:01,511 --> 00:16:03,910
Is this where the emotions came from,
do you think?

227
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:07,660
Uh,
because instinct cools is a reaction.

228
00:16:07,661 --> 00:16:12,460
You have the old adage of a fight or 
flight for instance,

229
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,920
depending on what you make a decision to
do.

230
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,720
Okay.
So let,

231
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,720
let's make a conceptual definition here.
We agree on the terminology.

232
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:29,610
Let's say that motivations are states of
being that indicated that are indicative

233
00:16:32,561 --> 00:16:34,210
of a goal.
So for example,

234
00:16:34,211 --> 00:16:35,044
if you get hungry,
I would say that's a motivational state 

235
00:16:37,391 --> 00:16:38,224
rather than an emotional state.
And it's a motivational state that sets 

236
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:44,620
the acquisition and ingestion of food as
the goal.

237
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,740
All right?
And so there's a variety of motivational

238
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:49,160
states,
hunger,

239
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,110
thirst,
sexual desire,

240
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:56,280
um,
especially defensive aggression,

241
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,330
predatory aggression,
um,

242
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,860
and the desire to eliminate essentially,
uh,

243
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,810
the desire to play.
Those are all motivational states.

244
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,700
And then there's emotional states and 
the primary emotional states or positive

245
00:17:10,701 --> 00:17:11,534
and negative and positive emotional 
states are experienced when you're 

246
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:20,291
moving towards a desired goal.
And negative emotional states occur when

247
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:26,380
the goal becomes uncertain or the 
pursuit is somehow frustrated or,

248
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,600
or interfered with.
Okay.

249
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
Now you asked about instincts,
well,

250
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,790
I would say both motivations and 
emotions or instincts,

251
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,343
they're very,
very archaic if you think about the 

252
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:44,240
positive and negative emotions as being 
approach versus withdrawal.

253
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:48,020
Um,
animals going all the way back to single

254
00:17:48,021 --> 00:17:52,230
celled organisms have approach versus 
withdrawal systems.

255
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,970
So they're unbelievably archaic.
They go way back before,

256
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,450
uh,
we split evolutionarily from,

257
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,360
um,
our chimpanzee like ancestors.

258
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:08,930
So they are instincts and they're very 
deep and they,

259
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,523
the fact that those instincts exist has 
all sorts of strange and that their 

260
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:18,900
evolutionary based have,
has all sorts of strange implications.

261
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,033
So for example,
you can understand the dog and 

262
00:18:22,261 --> 00:18:23,094
communicate with the dog because the dog
shares motivational and emotional 

263
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:29,120
structure with you to great degree.
It's a pack animal,

264
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,760
knows about dominance,
it knows about dominant striving,

265
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,880
it feels anxiety and pain and it knows 
how to play and he likes to play.

266
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,630
And there's a lot about a human being 
and the dog through the same,

267
00:18:42,631 --> 00:18:46,950
which is why we can live together.
But you can go way down the evolutionary

268
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:47,784
chain.
So say if you go all the way down to 

269
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:50,754
lobsters,
lobsters know about dominance 

270
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:57,951
hierarchies and they have approach and 
withdraw systems and the lobster nervous

271
00:18:59,071 --> 00:18:59,904
system,
which is very primitive compared to the 

272
00:19:01,561 --> 00:19:06,561
human nervous system is so similar to 
ours that you can give lobsters,

273
00:19:07,111 --> 00:19:12,111
antidepressants and it stops them from 
feeling hurt after that been defeated in

274
00:19:13,371 --> 00:19:15,980
a physical dominance dispute.
Yeah,

275
00:19:15,981 --> 00:19:16,814
it's absolutely amazing.
So typically if two lobsters are in a 

276
00:19:21,021 --> 00:19:26,021
dominance dispute and one loses,
it will withdraw and then it'll,

277
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,010
it kind of folds its body up,
it,

278
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,030
it,
it goes into a depressed light crouch,

279
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,450
whereas the winter will expand his body.
It looked bigger.

280
00:19:35,930 --> 00:19:38,000
Okay.
And when the harvesters defeated,

281
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,330
it won't fight with any other lobster 
for at least 20 minutes,

282
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,430
even one that it had defeated before.

283
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,510
But if you give it antidepressants in 
the aftermath of its defeat,

284
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:51,170
it doesn't contract.
Plus it'll fight right away.

285
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,400
It just.
Well,

286
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,600
it just shows you the,
the,

287
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,740
the idea of,
of evolutionarily determined instincts,

288
00:19:57,741 --> 00:20:00,200
in my opinion,
is not a theory at all.

289
00:20:00,201 --> 00:20:01,034
It's an absolutely self evident fact.
And it manifests itself in all sorts of 

290
00:20:05,841 --> 00:20:07,880
strange ways.
So for example,

291
00:20:07,881 --> 00:20:12,881
we know with chimpanzees,
chimpanzees basically go to war.

292
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:15,603
They're,
they're wired up to regard chimpanzee 

293
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,590
conspecifics who aren't in their tribe 
as

294
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:30,770
something to react against with fear and
hostility.

295
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:31,963
And if a wandering group of chimpanzees 
say numbering three or four at the 

296
00:20:36,771 --> 00:20:37,604
periphery of their territory,
comes across an isolated individual or 

297
00:20:41,091 --> 00:20:41,924
two from another group,
they'll tear them into shreds and that 

298
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,033
that primordial response to this 
stranger sheds substantial light on how 

299
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:59,791
it is that human beings demonize and 
then persecute their so called enemy

300
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,320
resentment.
Hatred as well.

301
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,810
And that can be demonization is,
as you say,

302
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:14,650
is that correct?

303
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:20,040
Well,
you can break it up into two aspects.

304
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:20,874
I think,
and this is something I go into great 

305
00:21:21,961 --> 00:21:26,961
detail about
what the book is about.

306
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:31,470
I was interested in territoriality and 
cruelty

307
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:37,650
to animals are territorial.
And if another animal

308
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:42,570
trespasses onto a complex animals 
territory,

309
00:21:42,571 --> 00:21:45,540
there'll be a fight.
And I think that's really understandable

310
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:50,541
because animals need territory and human
beings are clearly territorial,

311
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,880
territorial about our actual physical 
space.

312
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:55,013
And we're also territorial about our 
ideological or cultural space and it's 

313
00:21:59,131 --> 00:22:03,280
because we need to inhabit the physical 
territory and we need to inhabit and the

314
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,123
illogical territory and we react to 
challenges to the integrity of our 

315
00:22:09,031 --> 00:22:12,960
territory with fear and with defensive 
aggression.

316
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,770
And I think that can be understood,
uh,

317
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:17,783
quite appropriately using analogs from 
animal behavior and animal 

318
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:22,674
neurophysiology.
But you talked about resentment and 

319
00:22:25,981 --> 00:22:27,630
hatred.
Well,

320
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,710
those emotions I think are much more 
specifically human.

321
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,203
There's lots of examples from 20th 
century history of the persecution of 

322
00:22:38,641 --> 00:22:39,474
enemies going far beyond what was merely
needed to ensure territorial integrity 

323
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,493
on examples of course have that sort of 
behavior abound in the Holocaust 

324
00:22:50,611 --> 00:22:55,611
literature where the Nazis went out of 
their way not only to eradicate the Jews

325
00:22:59,731 --> 00:23:03,900
and the Gypsies and so forth,
but to torment them and torture them and

326
00:23:03,901 --> 00:23:04,734
crushed them in ways that were even,
that weren't even in the best interests 

327
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:10,554
of the persecutor.
And that's a lot more difficult to 

328
00:23:13,261 --> 00:23:14,094
understand.

329
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,640
Treat them as no better than
animals as they called them,

330
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:27,603
but not forgetting that they were 
earlier examples before when the 

331
00:23:30,761 --> 00:23:33,070
Holocaust.
In terms of numbers.

332
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,080
Sure,
uh,

333
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:38,920
and its scale and its cold bloodiness,
but if we go back to,

334
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,990
um,
times of say,

335
00:23:40,991 --> 00:23:45,991
one of the earlier ones,
sirens that I thought were horrific

336
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,273
was,
uh,

337
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,113
vlad the impaler who used to enjoy 
sitting eating his breakfast and having 

338
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,370
his victims in paled before him.
Uh,

339
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,850
and that's psychopathic.
Uh,

340
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,370
really is there a difference between 
that and say,

341
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,890
uh,
the crimes or the Nazis.

342
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:10,410
I also think that kind of behavior is 
far more normative

343
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,860
in,
in,

344
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,893
in modern times the Holocaust.
It's sort of become archetipal of 

345
00:24:18,181 --> 00:24:21,780
totalitarian,
evil more than just brutality.

346
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,150
But my sense after having researched 
this for,

347
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,063
for a lengthy period of time,
isn't that the whole behavior that 

348
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:34,020
characterize people who were involved in
the Holocaust was

349
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,520
essentially normative.
And even in 20th century history,

350
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,660
um,
the numbers that the numbers involved in

351
00:24:45,661 --> 00:24:49,070
the Holocaust per se aren't,
um,

352
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,570
of any order of magnitude there.
They're special.

353
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:55,410
They're,
they're not,

354
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:58,350
they're not immense by any stretch of 
the imagination.

355
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:00,503
Solzhenitsyn estimated that Stalin's 
brutality killed something in the 

356
00:25:03,331 --> 00:25:04,164
neighborhood of $60 million people.
And there's estimates from mile that he 

357
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:12,610
killed 100 million people.
And in Cambodia,

358
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:15,010
we know that at least 4 million people 
died

359
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,183
like the Holocaust is,
is that the prime exemplar of that kind 

360
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,314
of behavior,
but it typified the 20th century and as 

361
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:29,874
you already pointed out,
it's not like it arose in the 20th 

362
00:25:32,461 --> 00:25:33,060
century.
It's,

363
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,940
it's part of our,
it's part of our nature

364
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,850
victims into the gas chamber.
Uh,

365
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:52,933
the guy who press the release button on 
the first atomic bomb fell on that 

366
00:25:55,941 --> 00:25:56,774
aircraft that he knew would school to 
thousands or hundreds of thousands of 

367
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:05,180
people because both those two people 
believed in something.

368
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,910
Is this where it really boils down to 
the difference between good and evil,

369
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,220
their claim that they believe in 
something

370
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:23,120
to protect what they believe
in,

371
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:26,540
using the same mechanisms that they'll 
protect territory.

372
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:30,170
So for example,
if you own your house and

373
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:35,600
under English common law,
you have the right to say,

374
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,690
and then you have the right to say,
leave.

375
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:43,700
I have a gun,
I have a gun and fire a warning shot.

376
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,580
And then if they don't leave,
you have the right to shoot them and you

377
00:26:47,581 --> 00:26:50,530
can't be prosecuted for that.
Okay?

378
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,260
And everyone would say,
well,

379
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,530
you are within your rights because you 
were protecting your territory.

380
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,323
Okay?
So I think people have a right to 

381
00:26:59,131 --> 00:26:59,964
protect their territory and they have a 
right to protect their radiological 

382
00:27:02,731 --> 00:27:03,564
territory.
And there is rules of engagement that 

383
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:06,540
could,
uh,

384
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:11,290
govern disputes of that nature.
But when you're,

385
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,263
there's,
there's other sorts of act and many of 

386
00:27:14,131 --> 00:27:19,131
those characterized behavior in the 
concentration camps in the Nazi era that

387
00:27:19,201 --> 00:27:21,870
can't be explained by mere 
territoriality.

388
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,930
And that's when it's necessary as far as
I'm concerned,

389
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,320
to bring in conceptions to rive from 
mythology,

390
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,660
like the difference between good and 
evil.

391
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,693
And I think that you can define evil and
evil is an act that is designed to 

392
00:27:39,481 --> 00:27:43,200
produce a negative outcome for everyone 
who's involved.

393
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,350
That includes the victim and the 
perpetrator.

394
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,133
Because if you look at the first few 
chapters in genesis is a very clear 

395
00:27:58,931 --> 00:28:01,080
story.
So let me tell you one of the stories.

396
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,410
It's really worth knowing as far as I'm 
concerned.

397
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:09,760
When Adam and eve eat the fruit of the 
tree,

398
00:28:09,761 --> 00:28:14,761
of the knowledge of good and evil.
And the first thing that happens is that

399
00:28:17,291 --> 00:28:20,590
they noticed that their naked,
what does that mean?

400
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:25,260
It means they're illuminated with 
regards to their own vulnerable nature.

401
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,413
Because to be naked and to know your 
naked is to be exposed and vulnerable 

402
00:28:29,561 --> 00:28:32,110
and to know it.
And often people,

403
00:28:32,111 --> 00:28:32,944
for example,
will dream that they've been stripped 

404
00:28:34,301 --> 00:28:39,301
naked in front of a crowd.
It means their material vulnerability is

405
00:28:40,421 --> 00:28:45,421
exposed for everyone to see.
The first thing Adam and eve do,

406
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:49,660
once they discovered that they're naked,
is to close themselves.

407
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:50,603
They cover themselves up and human 
beings are the only creatures that were 

408
00:28:53,741 --> 00:28:54,574
clothes and clothes separate our 
vulnerability from the natural and 

409
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:00,400
social worlds.

410
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:04,450
They're protective in reality and 
they're protective symbolically.

411
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,243
Alright?
The next thing that happens is that God 

412
00:29:09,491 --> 00:29:12,010
comes walking through the garden,
see in the morning,

413
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:17,550
and he looks for Adam and Adam is hiding
behind a Bush and God says,

414
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,110
Adam,
where are you?

415
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:23,170
I'm used to walking with you.
And Adam says,

416
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,353
I'm,
I'm too afraid to come out because I 

417
00:29:27,221 --> 00:29:30,640
found out that I'm naked.
And God says,

418
00:29:30,641 --> 00:29:33,850
who told you that you were naked?
And Adam blames the woman.

419
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,070
Okay,
so then you think,

420
00:29:36,071 --> 00:29:38,170
well,
why would adam hide from God?

421
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,780
All right,
so imagine God,

422
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,440
a
God symbolizes a transcendent totality.

423
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,133
And this story indicates that at some 
point in human history there was an 

424
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:55,084
unbroken relationship between the 
transcendent totality and the 

425
00:29:58,031 --> 00:29:58,864
individual.
But when the individual became self 

426
00:30:01,131 --> 00:30:04,330
conscious,
that totality was threatened.

427
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,120
So why does Adam Hyde?
Well,

428
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:11,560
he knows he's naked and vulnerable,
so we hide from.

429
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:16,210
He hides from the demands of of 
yesterday.

430
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,650
He hides from what's best in himself 
because he looks at himself and thinks,

431
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,920
I'm nothing.
I'm weak.

432
00:30:23,921 --> 00:30:25,930
I'm,
I can be easily hurt.

433
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,900
And therefore,
when God calls,

434
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,840
if I have to hide,
well,

435
00:30:31,841 --> 00:30:35,110
the next thing that happens is that Adam
and eve are thrown out of paradise.

436
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,520
And God says,
well,

437
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:40,090
you know,
life is going to be difficult now.

438
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,220
Okay?
So that's,

439
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,153
that's the issue up.
The next chapter starts with the birth 

440
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:47,044
of Cain and Abel.
Now cain and Abel are the first two 

441
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,810
humans born in history,
right?

442
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:53,703
Because everything that happens in the 
garden of Eden prehistorical human 

443
00:30:58,901 --> 00:30:59,734
history starts with the fall of man.
The rise of self consciousness and Cain 

444
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:04,834
and Abel are the first two humans and 
they're symbolic of two attitudes 

445
00:31:09,431 --> 00:31:13,090
towards the revelation of vulnerability.
Now,

446
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:19,860
Abel is a shepherd
and came raises vegetables,

447
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,890
and they're both required to make 
sacrifices to God.

448
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,170
Okay?
Now,

449
00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:27,760
why would you make a sacrifice?
Well,

450
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:30,280
it's an archaic idea.
You burn something,

451
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,970
smoke rises up to heaven,
God's in heaven,

452
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:39,270
and he can judge the quality of your 
sacrifice by evaluating the smoke.

453
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:40,631
Let me think.
Well,

454
00:31:40,631 --> 00:31:41,464
that's a very archaic idea.
And what could a modern person do with 

455
00:31:43,871 --> 00:31:45,130
that?
Well,

456
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,720
a modern person could give these archaic
people some credit first.

457
00:31:49,721 --> 00:31:52,600
So let's say,
why is God in heaven?

458
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,510
Well,
it's because when you look at the sky at

459
00:31:55,511 --> 00:31:57,010
night,
it fills you with awe.

460
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,203
You see an unlimited expanse of being 
and that's the closest you get to 

461
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:08,710
directly experiencing the unnameable 
totality.

462
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:12,550
Okay?
Why should you make sacrifices to God?

463
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,043
Why would he be pleased with sacrifices?
While I would say you already know that 

464
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:20,560
because if I asked you,
well,

465
00:32:20,561 --> 00:32:24,760
what sacrifices have you made to make 
things better in your life?

466
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,193
No doubt.
You could immediately tell me now are 

467
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:29,883
people had to act that out because they 
didn't really have the philosophical 

468
00:32:32,681 --> 00:32:33,514
conceptions and verbalized bubble form,
but they still had an intuition that it 

469
00:32:37,691 --> 00:32:38,524
was necessary to make the right 
sacrifice in order to maintain an 

470
00:32:41,931 --> 00:32:46,190
appropriate relationship with the 
totality of being okay,

471
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,660
so able make some sacrifices and cane 
make some sacrifices.

472
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:55,040
Now able takes the best things.
He has an offers them to God,

473
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:58,080
so they're the firstborn of his flock 
and the choices.

474
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:01,460
Cuts of meat with ables called on to 
make a sacrifice.

475
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,623
He doesn't hold anything back.
He puts himself on the line and he 

476
00:33:06,381 --> 00:33:11,381
sacrifices a courageously and clearly 
and cane.

477
00:33:12,051 --> 00:33:14,360
By contrast,
he brings in some ratty little,

478
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,700
you know,
a wrinkly,

479
00:33:16,701 --> 00:33:17,534
old vegetables and sacrifices those.
So God smiles on unable sacrifices and 

480
00:33:23,841 --> 00:33:26,180
frowns on canes.
So what does that mean?

481
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,430
Well,
labels making the right sacrifices.

482
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:31,280
So everyone likes him.
Is this,

483
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:35,720
his enterprises flourish?
He has good intimate relationships.

484
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,040
He,
he,

485
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:37,874
uh,
produces a thriving family because he 

486
00:33:40,071 --> 00:33:42,620
makes the right decisions and cane,
on the other hand,

487
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:45,680
everything goes wrong for him.
So this makes them mad.

488
00:33:45,681 --> 00:33:48,810
It says in the Old Testament,
his countenance falls.

489
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,663
What does that mean?
He gets bitter and resentful and angry 

490
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:53,743
and depressed.
He's mad about how things are turning 

491
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:59,810
out.
So it goes and he has a little chat with

492
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:01,100
God and he says,
look,

493
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,660
oh,
I don't know what's going on here.

494
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,260
I'm working myself to the bone.
I'm making sacrifices left,

495
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:09,440
right,
and center and everything is not turning

496
00:34:09,441 --> 00:34:11,060
out for me.
Like what gifts?

497
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:16,600
And God says,
pay attention here.

498
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,610
It's your problem that things aren't 
going well.

499
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,170
Uh,
the,

500
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:25,880
the monster of sin crouches at your door
and you welcome it in.

501
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,280
You could reject it.
You could do things right.

502
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,130
You know exactly what the right thing to
do is,

503
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:35,810
yet you refuse to do it.
So all the trouble you're having is your

504
00:34:35,811 --> 00:34:37,970
fault.
Don't come along and blame me.

505
00:34:37,971 --> 00:34:41,060
Just get yourself put together properly 
and do things right.

506
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,000
And so that's the end of the 
conversation.

507
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,950
Well,
that isn't what cain wants to hear.

508
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,520
He wants to hear that the world is a 
miserable place and that the reason that

509
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,550
he's failing is,
is because of the structure of reality.

510
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,560
He doesn't want to hear that it's his 
problem,

511
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:55,993
so this just makes them absolutely 
boiling map and the first thing he does 

512
00:34:59,211 --> 00:35:01,940
is go and kill Abel.
Well,

513
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,583
that's the difference between 
territoriality and evil and he wants 

514
00:35:07,101 --> 00:35:09,590
what April has.
He even wants to be able,

515
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:14,540
but instead he destroys them out of 
spite and resentment and revenge against

516
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,280
the nature of reality.

517
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:20,670
Well then God gets wind of it and mark 
cane,

518
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:22,670
he says,
no one killed him,

519
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:23,990
and you might think,
well,

520
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:24,824
why?
Because it's God who says an eye for an 

521
00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:28,160
eye.
Well,

522
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:32,300
the next little bit of the story,
which is barely there anymore,

523
00:35:32,301 --> 00:35:33,650
it's,
it's so edited out,

524
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:38,900
explains exactly why cain wanders away 
and he gets married and he has a family.

525
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,750
But if you mess around with any of 
Keynes family,

526
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:49,260
if you annoy them or bother them or make
them resentful or angry,

527
00:35:49,261 --> 00:35:50,094
they don't just kill one person.
They killed seven and then those 

528
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:56,160
children have children and if you annoy 
them,

529
00:35:56,161 --> 00:35:56,994
they kill 70.
And at the end of that acceleration of 

530
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,950
revenge oriented killing,
God comes along and floods everything.

531
00:36:07,951 --> 00:36:10,920
And that's when the story of Noah and 
the Ark Kicks in,

532
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,770
and the story is very clear.
It says this,

533
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:16,703
if you act in properly,
and if you do the things that you know 

534
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:22,110
to be wrong,
if you don't make the right sacrifices,

535
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,370
your life will not turn out well.
You'll be punished all the time for your

536
00:36:26,371 --> 00:36:30,150
foolishness and your weakness and that 
will make you resentful,

537
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,590
twisted,
bitter,

538
00:36:31,591 --> 00:36:35,010
and murderous.
When you act on those,

539
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,360
uh,
motivations,

540
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:39,810
because of spite and resentment,
you'll,

541
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:44,990
you'll initiate a cataclysm of revenge 
oriented killings.

542
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:46,883
And if no stop is put to them,
that will spread through the entire 

543
00:36:50,311 --> 00:36:53,370
society and invite the apocalypse.

544
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,640
And that's the second,
third major story in genesis.

545
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:01,923
Exactly right.

546
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:10,390
Would you call it moral teaching there 
or was it more than that?

547
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,720
For sure.
You know,

548
00:37:14,721 --> 00:37:15,680
I mean because it,
it,

549
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,970
but it's,
it's,

550
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,670
it's moral in a weird way.
You know,

551
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:20,504
it's,
it's,

552
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,900
it's more like a description of moral 
reality.

553
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:25,820
Then a story that says,
well,

554
00:37:25,821 --> 00:37:28,280
you should act like this because that 
would be good.

555
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:31,220
If you imagine this story of Cain and 
Abel,

556
00:37:31,221 --> 00:37:35,420
this is a really old story.
It's been around for we have no idea how

557
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:36,254
long I'm in written form.
It's been around for several thousand 

558
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,453
years.
It's undoubtedly part of a larger oral 

559
00:37:42,171 --> 00:37:45,830
tradition.
It was edited by many,

560
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:46,664
many people and told and retold and all 
that's left of that story is what's 

561
00:37:51,711 --> 00:37:56,711
intensely memorable because otherwise it
wouldn't have been forgotten and it just

562
00:37:57,081 --> 00:38:00,380
says something blatantly.
It says that

563
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,343
you can accept your.
You can accept the need to make 

564
00:38:07,431 --> 00:38:12,431
sacrifices in order to keep your life on
the right track or you can fight against

565
00:38:14,451 --> 00:38:16,370
that and act improperly.

566
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,350
If you fight against that inactive 
properly,

567
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:20,203
then you're going to compromise your 
relationship with the totality of big 

568
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:25,123
and as soon as you do that,
you might as well essentially you're 

569
00:38:28,251 --> 00:38:33,251
living in a hell if you,
if you subject yourself chronically to a

570
00:38:33,531 --> 00:38:34,364
hellish existence that will make you 
turn your thoughts towards really 

571
00:38:39,431 --> 00:38:42,040
towards revenge against existence 
itself.

572
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,640
Well,
you know,

573
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,513
Stellan was setting himself up to blow 
up the entire planet and there's good 

574
00:38:49,031 --> 00:38:52,140
evidence from the KGB archivist in the 
late 19 fifties,

575
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:52,983
but he was gearing up with his multiple 
pre a pre apocalyptic genocidal 

576
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:05,131
practices.
He was gearing up enough courage to turn

577
00:39:05,861 --> 00:39:09,550
the whole world into a conflagration.
Well,

578
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,773
this is no a trivial matter and the only
stories that I know that have enough 

579
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:19,774
profundity to lay out the real 
seriousness of the issue are these 

580
00:39:24,671 --> 00:39:28,310
archaic stories.
Nothing in modern culture has the

581
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,860
requisite profundity

582
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,700

real seriousness of the issue are these 
archaic stories.

595
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:42,400
Nothing in modern culture has the 
requisite profundity

596
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,340
we do have as you get out of life,
what you put into it,

597
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,400
and another one that comes to mind is he
who lives by the sword dies by the sword

598
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:55,163
in the east.
They have the concept of a tradition of 

599
00:40:58,711 --> 00:40:59,544
Karma.

600
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:00,031
Yeah,
well,

601
00:41:00,031 --> 00:41:00,864
Karma Karma is.
Karma is a really good example because 

602
00:41:03,391 --> 00:41:06,300
the idea behind Karma,
it's very interesting.

603
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,553
I think from a neuropsychological 
perspective because Karma is predicated 

604
00:41:12,391 --> 00:41:13,224
on the idea that it is fundamentally 
impossible for you to get away with 

605
00:41:16,351 --> 00:41:20,790
anything and there's an idea in 
Christianity that's like that too.

606
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:24,750
It's a little more archaic and more 
dramatic than the idea of Karma.

607
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:29,700
Now idea in Christianity is that all of 
your actions and motivations are in some

608
00:41:29,701 --> 00:41:33,740
manner recorded and that you'll be 
brought to for them,

609
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:39,610
but and modern people look at that,
especially when it's

610
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:45,800
represented metaphorically as say,
a wise old man writing in a book.

611
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:46,634
I may just discounted entirely,
but I've certainly come to believe as a 

612
00:41:50,961 --> 00:41:55,250
consequences of studying what I've 
studied that you you.

613
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,720
It is absolutely impossible for you to 
get away with anything.

614
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,960
Whenever you make a mistake and you know
it's a mistake,

615
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,960
you will eventually pay for it.

616
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:06,943
You might not notice that that's what 
you're paying for because often the 

617
00:42:10,551 --> 00:42:15,551
punishment and the crime are so distant 
in time from one another that the causal

618
00:42:16,551 --> 00:42:19,160
connection is virtually impossible to 
identify,

619
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:23,000
but that doesn't mean it isn't there.
Now,

620
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,013
one of the things I attempted to lay out
in maps of meaning in some detail was 

621
00:42:27,481 --> 00:42:32,481
soldier and instance insights into the 
processes that lead to the establishment

622
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:37,160
of the Gulag archipelago.
Prison camps in the Soviet Union were so

623
00:42:37,161 --> 00:42:39,890
many tens of millions of people were 
killed.

624
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:41,803
It was Solzhenitsyn's a belief,
and this is a belief that you share 

625
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,360
Sheridan and as well,
Eric Norman,

626
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:49,693
that it was the cumulative sins of the 
individuals that made up a population 

627
00:42:56,570 --> 00:43:01,100
that culminated in these absolute 
totalitarian catastrophes.

628
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:02,923
So just as keynes unwillingness to make 
the appropriate sacrifices in his 

629
00:43:08,451 --> 00:43:09,284
individual day to day life culminated in
the degeneration of his entire society 

630
00:43:14,481 --> 00:43:17,010
and the,
and the uh,

631
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,360
uh,
and the,

632
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:21,830
and the bringing forth an apocalypse.

633
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:23,083
So in everyday life,
each individual's moral errors 

634
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,453
accumulate and manifest themselves at a 
social level and play themselves out in 

635
00:43:34,491 --> 00:43:37,580
this immense,
in this immense,

636
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:38,653
a forum.
Now we don't like to think that way 

637
00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:42,403
because no individual likes to feel that
they're localized foolishness and 

638
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:48,224
weakness.
Conscious foolishness and weakness 

639
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:53,600
reverberates through the entire social 
structure.

640
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:59,110
But everything that I've ever read that 
was serious with regards to this subject

641
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:06,120
indicated precisely that,
I mean even Hannah run,

642
00:44:06,121 --> 00:44:10,130
she wrote the banality of evil.
Well,

643
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:11,323
you know,
I think it's the evil of banality 

644
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,380
personally,
but she,

645
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:16,660
she,
the,

646
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,770
the,
the architect of the,

647
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:23,920
of the final solution was a meek,
negligible,

648
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:27,730
resentful,
nonentity.

649
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:30,163
And what that shows you is just how 
horrifying it is morally to be a week 

650
00:44:35,341 --> 00:44:37,110
resentful,
judgemental,

651
00:44:37,111 --> 00:44:38,690
non entity.
It's,

652
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:39,603
it's,
it's so catastrophic that under the 

653
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:48,690
appropriate conditions it can endanger 
the structure of being.

654
00:44:55,510 --> 00:45:00,510
You talk about the fact that we're 
comfortable with the known what is known

655
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:06,910
around which we build all our cultural 
traditions and from which,

656
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:09,550
uh,
propagated,

657
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:14,080
and then there's exploration of the new,
if you like,

658
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:17,320
and how we can act on that.
Could you tell us a bit more about that?

659
00:45:17,321 --> 00:45:19,930
Because you're insinuating,
I believe in your,

660
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:25,120
your work that in your book that to do 
so I can make one some kind of a,

661
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,260
some kind of heroic action.
You,

662
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,213
you've mapped out something whereby we 
can reach out for what is unknown to 

663
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:38,920
explore a potential and creativity.
Is that correct?

664
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,380
That's a good summary.
I mean,

665
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,770
imagine.
Imagine that in life you have,

666
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:48,370
you have some one obvious thing to rely 
on and the obvious thing,

667
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:53,371
you have to rely on it as the 
traditional knowledge and wealth of your

668
00:45:53,561 --> 00:45:54,394
culture.
It contains most of the knowledge that 

669
00:45:57,251 --> 00:45:58,084
you have and allows you to make your 
life as comfortable as it has been made 

670
00:46:04,721 --> 00:46:05,554
within it.
But there are other sources of strength 

671
00:46:09,251 --> 00:46:14,251
too and they're more subtle.
So your culture provides you with what's

672
00:46:14,501 --> 00:46:15,334
known and what's knowable,
but culture is never mapped everything 

673
00:46:20,231 --> 00:46:23,230
out perfectly.
There's many things that remain to be to

674
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:27,610
be known and many of the things that 
remain to be known are valuable.

675
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:32,200
And what that means is that if you 
search after what is yet unknown,

676
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:33,303
you can also derive strength from that 
because that's the domain in which new 

677
00:46:38,021 --> 00:46:39,130
discoveries are made.

678
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:43,240
And so if I face you with evidence that 
you're wrong about something,

679
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:45,303
which means there's something that you 
don't know that you're not taking into 

680
00:46:47,561 --> 00:46:48,394
account that can frighten you because it
shows you that the knowledge structures 

681
00:46:52,511 --> 00:46:53,344
that you rely on are dangerously 
incomplete and that can make you very 

682
00:46:56,411 --> 00:46:59,770
angry and that can make you very 
resentful or you can say,

683
00:46:59,771 --> 00:47:01,360
oh,
isn't that so fascinating?

684
00:47:01,361 --> 00:47:02,194
The fact that something isn't known here
means that I could go and discover that 

685
00:47:05,711 --> 00:47:06,544
I could voluntarily encountered that and
I could derive something new and 

686
00:47:09,841 --> 00:47:10,674
valuable and I could use that.
And the hero in methodology is the 

687
00:47:15,431 --> 00:47:18,280
person who voluntarily encounters the 
unknown.

688
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:22,540
And,
and this is a unbelievably old concept,

689
00:47:22,541 --> 00:47:27,400
is the oldest concept we know that human
beings have created it stems all the way

690
00:47:27,401 --> 00:47:31,120
back to the Enuma,
the Mesopotamian creation myth,

691
00:47:31,121 --> 00:47:33,160
which is the oldest written document we 
have,

692
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:34,563
and it's the Enuma elish is the story on
which the first story in genesis is 

693
00:47:39,281 --> 00:47:40,114
based.

694
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:41,163
Now here,
here's a way of thinking about things 

695
00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:47,260
and this is a mythological way and it's 
extremely useful.

696
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,513
So forget for a minute the idea that the
world is made out of matter and forget 

697
00:47:53,201 --> 00:47:56,800
that it's made out of objects.
Look at it from a different perspective.

698
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:01,870
We'll say the world of experience,
which is the world you inhabit,

699
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:07,180
is made out of three things.
It's made out of the fact that no matter

700
00:48:07,181 --> 00:48:08,014
how much you know,
there are going to be phenomenon 

701
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:14,920
occurrences that exceed your capacity 
for comprehension,

702
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:16,683
and that's always going to be the case.
And so we're going to call that a 

703
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:25,000
category.
That's the category of the unknown.

704
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:28,510
And then there are always going to be 
things that you know and understand,

705
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:31,060
and that's part of your tradition.
We're going to call that the known,

706
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:33,790
so wherever you go,
wherever you are,

707
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,670
there's a balance between the known and 
unknown

708
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:40,270
and then the third thing is the fact of 
you.

709
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:41,133
There's a conscious observer there and 
the conscious observer is the place 

710
00:48:45,341 --> 00:48:47,500
where the known and the unknown 
interact.

711
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:51,040
That's the mythological actors,
the known.

712
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:52,263
That's the great father unknown.
That's the great mother and the 

713
00:48:55,211 --> 00:48:56,044
individual and the Taoists represent 
that as yin and Yang or chaos versus 

714
00:49:02,711 --> 00:49:03,544
order.
People think about that as masculine 

715
00:49:05,621 --> 00:49:08,710
versus feminine.
That gives us a bad interpretation or an

716
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:11,680
insufficient interpretation of Dallas 
thought.

717
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:12,783
The Dallas say,
experiences made of chaos and order and 

718
00:49:17,651 --> 00:49:18,484
the proper place to stand is right 
between them and you can tell when 

719
00:49:23,201 --> 00:49:24,034
you're standing right between chaos and 
order because that's when you feel that 

720
00:49:27,461 --> 00:49:28,294
things are meaningful and that means 
that meaning is the instinct that tells 

721
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:34,240
you that you're standing in the right 
place.

722
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,513
Now people are vulnerable and they're 
afraid because of that and they can be 

723
00:49:39,131 --> 00:49:43,030
challenged and hurt and they can be made
angry and murderous,

724
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:45,100
but I would say,
well,

725
00:49:45,101 --> 00:49:48,190
if you stand between chaos and order 
properly,

726
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:50,163
your life can become so meaningful that 
the meaning gives you confidence and 

727
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:59,020
power and the ability to overcome your 
sense of shameful vulnerability,

728
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:03,790
and I would also say that's what 
religious stories or telling you to do.

729
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:07,690
Now we go back to genesis.
In the beginning,

730
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,393
God makes order out of chaos and that 
story is based on an older architecture 

731
00:50:14,651 --> 00:50:17,710
derived from the Enuma Elish,
the Enuma Elish,

732
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:18,693
a god named Marduk cuts up the dragon of
chaos and makes the world out of her 

733
00:50:24,101 --> 00:50:24,934
pieces.
While the dragon of chaos recurs as a 

734
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,110
mythological motifs,
frequently,

735
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:36,550
I'm generally in the guise of Leviathan 
say,

736
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:38,803
and Yahuah is envisioned as the deity 
that derives order habitable order from 

737
00:50:46,281 --> 00:50:49,180
chaos and immediately after.
Yeah,

738
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:51,320
what derives happened to Florida from 
chaos.

739
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:52,243
He announces he makes human beings and 
then he announces that they are made in 

740
00:50:56,061 --> 00:50:58,160
his image,
male and female,

741
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,670
made in his image.
Well,

742
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,920
we think that means that God is like a 
human being,

743
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:08,480
but what it really means is that the 
human being is like God,

744
00:51:08,481 --> 00:51:12,170
isn't that the human being has the 
capacity to make order out of chaos,

745
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:14,023
and when we say that there's something 
divine about a person that gives them 

746
00:51:16,761 --> 00:51:21,761
intrinsic rights,
what we mean is the fact that each human

747
00:51:21,801 --> 00:51:26,801
being can make order out of chaos means 
that every single person is deserving of

748
00:51:28,371 --> 00:51:31,760
a certain kind of respect.
Even if they're murderous,

749
00:51:31,761 --> 00:51:32,594
even if they're criminals,
even if they're prostitutes and tax 

750
00:51:35,241 --> 00:51:37,520
collectors,
they're still,

751
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:38,503
they're still embodied with the kind of 
dignity that only identity with God can 

752
00:51:43,131 --> 00:51:43,964
provide,
and that identity is the capacity to 

753
00:51:45,591 --> 00:51:49,130
make order out of chaos.
And it's not just a metaphor.

754
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:05,730
What's happening with those sort of 
individuals is very suppressed or has it

755
00:52:06,341 --> 00:52:07,174
really died?
Something in them died as spark gone 

756
00:52:09,041 --> 00:52:09,874
out.

757
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,440
That's such a difficult question.
You know,

758
00:52:13,441 --> 00:52:15,600
because we know,
for example,

759
00:52:15,601 --> 00:52:19,170
that certain kinds of extreme brain 
damage,

760
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:25,870
criminal behavior,
if your prefrontal cortex is damaged,

761
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:30,900
then that can make you impulsive and 
criminal.

762
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,860
From a scientific perspective,
I would say it's very difficult to judge

763
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:38,963
the culpability of certain people 
because they've been damaged in some 

764
00:52:42,511 --> 00:52:45,570
way.
We don't really understand the limits on

765
00:52:45,571 --> 00:52:50,160
their capacity to choose are compromised
and it's very,

766
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,560
it's,
it's,

767
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:52,633
it's,
it's a situation that has to be judged 

768
00:52:54,811 --> 00:52:59,811
carefully in each individual case.
But then mythologically I would say what

769
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:03,780
Solzhenitsyn said and what he said was 
that in every person,

770
00:53:03,781 --> 00:53:04,614
no matter how good there is,
a little corner of corruption and evil 

771
00:53:08,521 --> 00:53:12,150
that still hasn't been overcome.
And then in everyone,

772
00:53:12,151 --> 00:53:12,984
no matter how evil and corrupt,
there's a little bit of a little corner 

773
00:53:15,811 --> 00:53:18,390
of good,
that's still a possibility that might be

774
00:53:18,391 --> 00:53:19,224
made manifest itself.
And I don't exactly know how to 

775
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:27,030
reconcile those two viewpoints.
No.

776
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:30,840
And I think,
I think each of them are right,

777
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:34,470
even though they're juxtaposition makes 
them,

778
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:35,880
makes a paradox.

779
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:38,290
So looking at

780
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:43,330
read about Ted Bundy in all about Ted 
Bundy.

781
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:44,720
What was that last?

782
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:50,550
I'm in the US.
Very good looking young man and uh,

783
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:52,103
he raped and murdered a number of young 
women and one of his tricks was to put 

784
00:53:56,881 --> 00:54:01,881
on a fake cast and to elicit a 
sympathetic to stop someone,

785
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,073
someone young and beautiful who was 
driving a vehicle to use their sympathy 

786
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:13,371
as a means of getting them compromised.
He was a terrible person,

787
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:19,520
but I read about his journey down hill,
you know,

788
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:24,800
and he said he first started to get 
involved in violent pornography and that

789
00:54:25,201 --> 00:54:28,020
as far as he was concerned,
that was what opened the door.

790
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:30,660
And I think that's a good metaphor.
I mean,

791
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:31,763
one of the things you've talked about 
continually when he was attempting to 

792
00:54:35,191 --> 00:54:37,920
explain what had happened in Nazi 
Germany was the fact that

793
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:40,263
a person moving,
moving downhill to some horrific 

794
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:48,480
endpoint,
like a concentration camp guards say,

795
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,300
makes a little mistake,
knows it's a mistake,

796
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:52,173
makes a little mistake,
little compromise and that puts them in 

797
00:54:54,751 --> 00:54:58,050
a position where another compromise is 
more likely.

798
00:54:58,400 --> 00:54:59,233
And then that puts them in a position 
where another compromise is more likely 

799
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:06,780
and 300 compromises later.
He's,

800
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:10,530
there's a great book called ordinary 
men.

801
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,530
It's a study of a police battalion and 
pool,

802
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:17,610
and these men started out as normal 
middle aged policemen,

803
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:22,500
most of them adults before Hitler even 
came to power,

804
00:55:22,501 --> 00:55:27,501
so not victims of hitlarian propaganda 
in their maturing phase.

805
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:28,823
They went from perfectly ordinary 
policeman to men who were taking naked 

806
00:55:31,921 --> 00:55:36,270
pregnant women out into fields and 
shooting them behind the head and

807
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:43,580
the book details their descent into this
hellish place step by step.

808
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,520
Well,
I think that's how people defend,

809
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:48,383
you know,
it's step by step and I believe under 

810
00:55:50,491 --> 00:55:54,180
most circumstances that every step is 
conscious.

811
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:59,720
Even though the memory of making this 
step might fade into unconsciousness and

812
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:01,524
the full cataclysmic consequences of 
each moral error aren't necessarily 

813
00:56:06,601 --> 00:56:07,434
evident.

814
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:13,000
In the case of looking at the individual
as to the

815
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:15,483
very quickly when someone has.
What's known as a nervous breakdown is 

816
00:56:19,551 --> 00:56:22,780
that when they just can't make order out
of anything,

817
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,160
just can't cope.
They just a withdrawal.

818
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:32,340
I mean what we could look at that 
neuropsychologically or we could look at

819
00:56:32,341 --> 00:56:36,510
it descriptively.
So here's what happens.

820
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:37,413
Neuropsychologically there is a little 
brain organ called the hippocampus and 

821
00:56:42,511 --> 00:56:45,810
the hippocampus helps you know where you
are and what you're doing,

822
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:51,740
and it inhibits a whole array of more 
primordial emotional structures,

823
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:57,180
particularly the Amygdala and the 
hypothalamus.

824
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,193
Now,
the Amygdala is responsible for anxiety 

825
00:56:59,731 --> 00:57:00,564
and fear,
and the hypothalamus is responsible for 

826
00:57:02,971 --> 00:57:06,000
all different kinds of motivation.
Now,

827
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:09,000
as long as you know where you are and 
what you're doing,

828
00:57:09,210 --> 00:57:10,043
which means that when you act,
the outcome you desire occurs because 

829
00:57:13,621 --> 00:57:16,620
that sort of defines knowing where you 
were and what you're doing.

830
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:21,210
Then the Amygdala and the hypothalamus 
remained inhibited.

831
00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:24,900
Now,
as soon as things aren't turning out the

832
00:57:24,901 --> 00:57:29,160
way you expect them to,
then the Amygdala is disinhibited and so

833
00:57:29,161 --> 00:57:29,994
as I elements and then the Hypo,
then you get afraid and paralyzed and 

834
00:57:34,591 --> 00:57:38,370
the hypothalamus starts to produce a 
stress hormone called Cortisol.

835
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:42,510
Now Cortisol is in some ways a 
stimulant.

836
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,393
It'll stimulate exploratory behavior,
and in small doses it's pretty good for 

837
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:47,874
you,
but in large doses it hyperactivates 

838
00:57:52,711 --> 00:57:55,590
your physiology,
shuts off your immune system.

839
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:00,660
It compromises your longterm cognitive 
ability and it's toxic.

840
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:06,260
It starts to destroy the hippocampus and
other destroys the hippocampus.

841
00:58:06,871 --> 00:58:07,704
The ability of the hippocampus to 
inhibit your negative emotional 

842
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:12,954
responses is increasingly compromised 
and that turns into a cycle and if the 

843
00:58:18,271 --> 00:58:19,104
cycle gets instantiated with enough 
intensity than the entire negative 

844
00:58:23,851 --> 00:58:28,851
emotional system can get this inhibit 
and the knowledge structures start start

845
00:58:29,371 --> 00:58:30,204
to become demolished.
When people talk about a nervous 

846
00:58:34,231 --> 00:58:37,350
breakdown,
which is usually a post traumatic stress

847
00:58:37,351 --> 00:58:39,720
disorder,
chronic repeating depression,

848
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:42,030
that's basically what they're talking 
about.

849
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:43,853
If you have a conversation with someone 
who goes through the regular bouts of 

850
00:58:48,821 --> 00:58:52,850
depression,
the perception of reality is distorted.

851
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:57,420
They just see everything negative about 
anything you can think about.

852
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:58,701
Yeah.
Well,

853
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:00,770
and,
and what happens is you may imagine,

854
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:03,620
imagine if you're doing some small task,
oh,

855
00:59:03,621 --> 00:59:08,090
let's say you're cutting up a broccoli 
for dinner and you,

856
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:11,420
um,
you cut your finger

857
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:15,860
and I say to you,
what is,

858
00:59:15,861 --> 00:59:18,030
what is the fact that you cut your 
finger mean,

859
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:24,260
here's some possibilities.
It means you should be more careful when

860
00:59:24,261 --> 00:59:25,280
you're cutting broccoli.

861
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:26,710
Okay?

862
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:30,190
It means that you're actually not very 
careful.

863
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:32,563
The fact that you're not very careful 
about cutting broccoli indicates you're 

864
00:59:36,651 --> 00:59:39,800
probably not as careful as you should be
about most things you do.

865
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:42,093
The fact that your daughter is careful 
about most things you do as you should 

866
00:59:45,251 --> 00:59:48,850
be,
is an explanation for why all the things

867
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:52,300
that have gone wrong in your life up to 
this point have actually gone wrong.

868
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:54,473
People like you who have had lots of 
good things go wrong and who aren't 

869
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:04,650
sufficiently careful tend to go downhill
over time.

870
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:09,900
Plus they're very not very good people.
Maybe they shouldn't even be around.

871
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:13,650
Okay?
That's how a depressed person thinks.

872
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:18,863
Well,
what happens is that their ability to 

873
01:00:20,551 --> 01:00:25,551
inhibit the spread of the meaning of the
negative event is completely compromised

874
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:32,210
because they're nervous.
They're nervous system has its.

875
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:36,300
They're supposed to be a threshold for 
the transmission of negative information

876
01:00:36,301 --> 01:00:41,301
across different levels of abstraction.
You're supposed to be somewhat resistant

877
01:00:41,311 --> 01:00:43,130
to that spread.
You know,

878
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:43,973
it could easily be that.
It could easily be true that the fact 

879
01:00:45,901 --> 01:00:46,734
that you cut yourself is an indication 
that you're not living your life 

880
01:00:49,291 --> 01:00:50,124
properly,
but it isn't necessarily the first 

881
01:00:52,591 --> 01:00:56,760
conclusion that you should leap too,
but for a depressed person,

882
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,433
you know,
that's.

883
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:01,380
That's often inevitable.
They can't help it.

884
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:09,520
Slippery slope.
They're overwhelmed by chaos

885
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:12,953
explanation.

886
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:14,713
No,
you were just at a major conference on 

887
01:01:17,641 --> 01:01:21,000
consciousness in Arizona,
I gather now.

888
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:26,130
What new ideas did you see presented in 
this field that you found interesting at

889
01:01:26,131 --> 01:01:27,540
that conference?

890
01:01:28,670 --> 01:01:29,503
Well,
I've been to that conference several 

891
01:01:33,081 --> 01:01:38,081
times and
directly relevant.

892
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:42,380
So let me give you.
Let me give you an example of

893
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:51,420
who has been investigating the mechanism
of action of hallucinogenic drugs.

894
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:54,103
Hallucinogenic drugs have been used 
throughout history to produce mystical 

895
01:01:58,861 --> 01:01:59,694
experiences of one form or another,
and vollenweider actually provided an 

896
01:02:04,621 --> 01:02:09,270
explanation of why that might be.
And that was very interesting to me.

897
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:10,613
So

898
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,153
when you're,
your senses are each somewhat 

899
01:02:14,941 --> 01:02:18,570
independent systems,
but the,

900
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,153
the content of your sensory experience 
is unified in a brain area called the 

901
01:02:24,601 --> 01:02:27,300
Thalamus.
Now,

902
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:28,613
so imagine you're your site and your 
vision and your touch and your sense of 

903
01:02:33,091 --> 01:02:36,060
your body in space are all integrated in
the elements,

904
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:39,660
but there's a lot of information coming 
in from all of your senses.

905
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:43,350
Okay?
Now imagine that your prefrontal Cortex,

906
01:02:43,351 --> 01:02:45,420
which is a relatively new part of the 
brain,

907
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:49,830
it sets up a plan what you're going to 
do next,

908
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:55,040
and it tells the hypothalamus only lead 
information relevant to the plan through

909
01:02:56,131 --> 01:02:59,220
into consciousness.
So for example,

910
01:02:59,221 --> 01:03:02,460
if you walk into the kitchen and you're 
going to make yourself something to eat,

911
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:03,893
you're not going to notice the floor and
you're not going to notice the paint on 

912
01:03:06,901 --> 01:03:07,734
the ceiling.
You're going to notice the refrigerator 

913
01:03:09,541 --> 01:03:10,374
and the stove and the few implements 
that you need to undertake the task 

914
01:03:13,921 --> 01:03:14,754
related to eating.
So the prefrontal cortex gates the 

915
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:18,743
Thalamus.
Now there's a million things you could 

916
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:21,864
pay attention to in the kitchen because 
the kitchen is a very complex visual 

917
01:03:24,871 --> 01:03:26,820
environment.
Well,

918
01:03:26,821 --> 01:03:31,540
if you take a hallucinogenic drug,
inhibits the prefrontal Cortex,

919
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:32,374
has capacity to gate the Thalamus,
and all sorts of sensory information 

920
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:37,560
flows through.

921
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:40,413
Now,
most of the time when you look at the 

922
01:03:41,171 --> 01:03:43,630
world,
you hardly see any of it.

923
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:45,990
Yes,
exactly.

924
01:03:45,991 --> 01:03:49,410
You're your brain is exactly as Aldous 
Huxley proposed.

925
01:03:49,411 --> 01:03:52,410
Your brain is actually a sequence of 
extreme,

926
01:03:52,590 --> 01:03:53,423
extremely complex filtering mechanisms 
and most of what's out there is 

927
01:03:58,051 --> 01:04:02,550
eliminated well following on 
vollenweider.

928
01:04:02,551 --> 01:04:03,384
I would say that the ground of mystical 
experience is the partial apprehension 

929
01:04:07,951 --> 01:04:12,951
of the richness of potential experience 
beyond

930
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:18,500
beyond what's expected.
So when you look at the world,

931
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:19,573
what you see is mostly relevant to your 
current plan and shape to a tremendous 

932
01:04:23,631 --> 01:04:24,464
degree by your memory and if if those 
systems are inhibited or shut down in 

933
01:04:30,051 --> 01:04:34,190
some way and you have the opportunity to
apprehend what's actually there,

934
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:35,373
what's the sensation it produces,
which is the disinhibition of certain 

935
01:04:39,081 --> 01:04:44,081
kinds of emotion is very much associated
with what people describe as all.

936
01:04:47,270 --> 01:04:49,000
No,
I would say to her,

937
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:51,080
here's something interesting in that 
regard.

938
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:53,180
You know,
people say,

939
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:56,810
people ask themselves,
for example,

940
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:58,453
do you believe in God?
And I would say that's actually a 

941
01:05:02,571 --> 01:05:03,404
nonsensical question.
I would say whether or not you believe 

942
01:05:08,391 --> 01:05:12,170
in God,
you're more or less stuck with him.

943
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:15,710
He's there whether you believe it or 
not,

944
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:19,150
and it has nothing to do with belief.
And I'll tell you why.

945
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:22,510
It's actually straightforward.
Okay,

946
01:05:22,511 --> 01:05:26,320
so let's go back to the ancient Israelis
Israel lights.

947
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:27,903
Now they had some rules.
They believed that there was a unity 

948
01:05:31,781 --> 01:05:35,890
behind everything and that unity was 
unnameable,

949
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:39,610
so it was against the rules to speak the
name of God.

950
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:42,520
Why?
Well,

951
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:45,130
because as soon as you speak the name of
something,

952
01:05:45,131 --> 01:05:45,964
you categorize it,
and as soon as it's categorizable and 

953
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:51,940
understandable,
then it's not the totality.

954
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:55,450
It's something you've parceled off and 
made into a concept.

955
01:05:56,230 --> 01:06:00,130
The totality of being is beyond all 
conceptualization.

956
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,440
Okay,
so then you might ask yourself,

957
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:05,980
well,
is there a totality of being.

958
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:08,710
While the answer to that is,
well obviously,

959
01:06:08,711 --> 01:06:13,711
because everything there is sums up to 
one totality.

960
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:17,080
Well,
what's the nature of that totality?

961
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:18,730
Well,
it's an honorable.

962
01:06:18,731 --> 01:06:21,460
You can't say it's too complex.
It's too rich.

963
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:25,960
It's,
it's not within human ability to grasp.

964
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:27,820
Is it there?
Well,

965
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:32,230
it's there.
Just like a room contains the objects in

966
01:06:32,231 --> 01:06:34,990
the room.
It's there for sure.

967
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:37,090
Okay,
so there is a totality.

968
01:06:37,091 --> 01:06:40,450
That's unnameable.
The next question would be,

969
01:06:40,451 --> 01:06:42,220
well,
do you have a relationship with it?

970
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:43,810
Well,
the answer to that is,

971
01:06:43,811 --> 01:06:48,550
of course you have a relationship with 
it because every part has a relationship

972
01:06:48,551 --> 01:06:49,384
to the whole.

973
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:55,980
When
you're inside the totality,

974
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:58,080
then you might ask,
well,

975
01:06:58,081 --> 01:07:00,850
what's the nature of your relationship 
with that totality?

976
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:02,190
And I would say,
well,

977
01:07:02,191 --> 01:07:03,024
you tell me.
It's easy to know if your life rich and 

978
01:07:06,421 --> 01:07:10,530
meaningful and worthy of sustaining and 
in your own.

979
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:13,880
From your own perspective,
do you believe that life is worthwhile?

980
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:16,260
You live it in a manner that makes it 
worthwhile,

981
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:18,960
and if the answer to that is yes,
then I would say,

982
01:07:18,961 --> 01:07:19,794
well,
you have the proper relationship with 

983
01:07:21,061 --> 01:07:25,900
the totality and if the answer is no,
you doubt the value of life.

984
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,200
You're hostile and resentful,
you're bored,

985
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:30,120
you're afraid,
you're hurt.

986
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:34,170
Well then there's something wrong with 
your relationship with the totality.

987
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:37,620
Well,
what's what's so complicated about that?

988
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:39,233
It's,
it's,

989
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:40,103
it's,
it's self evident and it's stunning to 

990
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:46,860
me that it's the subject of so much 
constant dispute.

991
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:49,620
Now you might object,
well,

992
01:07:49,621 --> 01:07:51,570
you have a relationship with the 
totality,

993
01:07:51,571 --> 01:07:52,404
but it's not a personal relationship,
which is what the ancient Israel Israel 

994
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:56,473
lights are claimed,
and of course what the product Modern 

995
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:03,060
Protestants claim even more dramatically
and I would say,

996
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,920
well,
you couldn't be right,

997
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:07,920
but let's consider it an experiment.

998
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:13,740
Here's the experiment.
Try to establish a personal relationship

999
01:08:13,741 --> 01:08:16,400
with this totality and here's,
here's the criteria.

1000
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:21,530
I will say that whenever you're doing 
something that's intensely meaningful,

1001
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:23,053
then you've established a personal 
relationship with this totality and if 

1002
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:30,500
all you ever did were things that were 
intensely personally meaningful,

1003
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:31,813
while you'd live in ideal life and you 
wouldn't be afraid of death and you 

1004
01:08:34,731 --> 01:08:39,410
wouldn't become bitter and resentful,
and it's also doable.

1005
01:08:39,411 --> 01:08:40,244
I think with every choice you make,
you decide whether you're going to do 

1006
01:08:42,321 --> 01:08:46,340
that or not.
It's difficult to do meaningful things.

1007
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,500
Everybody doesn't always agree with 
them.

1008
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:49,723
They're kind of idiosyncratic.
There's no necessary reason that you'll 

1009
01:08:55,040 --> 01:09:00,040
be rewarded by the culture with material
success if you do meaningful things.

1010
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:04,430
Um,
so it's a shot in the dark,

1011
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:07,730
which is a leap of faith,
but it's right within your grasp.

1012
01:09:07,731 --> 01:09:09,860
You can,
you can do it just by deciding to,

1013
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:13,110
well what I learned from writing maps of
meaningless,

1014
01:09:13,111 --> 01:09:13,944
that the fate of the world literally 
depends on the choice that each 

1015
01:09:18,981 --> 01:09:23,690
individual makes with regards to the 
relationship to the totality of being.

1016
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:26,840
And that's that.
And that's what,

1017
01:09:27,350 --> 01:09:28,183
that's the central message of profound 
religious system says there's more to 

1018
01:09:31,341 --> 01:09:34,510
you than you think a lot more.
There's more that,

1019
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:37,070
more for evil,
way more than you think,

1020
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:40,670
and there's way more for good and 
whether you know it or not,

1021
01:09:40,671 --> 01:09:42,530
you're always choosing between those 
two.

1022
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:43,543
And whether you know it or not,
the fate of being itself rests on your 

1023
01:09:46,371 --> 01:09:48,200
choice.
Well,

1024
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:50,420
who the hell wants to believe that?

1025
01:09:52,170 --> 01:09:53,420
Wait,
it's too weighty.

1026
01:09:54,050 --> 01:09:55,570
I don't care if it's way too.
You're not.

1027
01:09:56,670 --> 01:09:57,503
When you're trying to investigate the 
reasons behind something like the 

1028
01:10:00,001 --> 01:10:03,720
Holocaust,
things get weighty very rapidly.

1029
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:15,330
No,
that was a group experience.

1030
01:10:15,331 --> 01:10:20,280
It wasn't an individual,
a just purely individually experience.

1031
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:25,470
How do you think
we handled that?

1032
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:27,813
Well,
I think you can think of two recent 

1033
01:10:30,051 --> 01:10:30,884
events.
Nine slash 11 would be one and the 

1034
01:10:36,861 --> 01:10:41,340
flooding of New Orleans.
So with regards to nine slash 11,

1035
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:47,360
the most interesting thing to note about
people's responses to that catastrophe.

1036
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:52,130
Was there an unconscious need for 
repetition?

1037
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:58,290
I mean everyone I know watched the trade
towers fall 50 times 100 times in shock,

1038
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:03,110
uh,
unable not to watch.

1039
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:08,650
And I think the reason that that's so 
illuminating is because it shows you how

1040
01:11:08,991 --> 01:11:12,860
complicated it is to see what you don't 
understand.

1041
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:14,843
So mythologically speaking,
the fall of the towers was equivalent 

1042
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:22,710
both to the death of the king and to the
reemergence of chaos.

1043
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:26,000
And when the king dies and chaos 
reemergence,

1044
01:11:26,030 --> 01:11:26,863
it's very difficult to see what's there.
And I'm not speaking metaphorically 

1045
01:11:31,321 --> 01:11:32,154
precisely.
People wouldn't have had to watch the 

1046
01:11:34,471 --> 01:11:39,471
towers fall over and over if they could 
see them fall and on a trivial level,

1047
01:11:41,491 --> 01:11:43,140
a building collapsed.

1048
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:44,693
But what the events that characterized 
nine slash 11 were far more than merely 

1049
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:53,700
a building falling when the event 
happened.

1050
01:11:53,701 --> 01:11:54,534
No one knew what fail.
No one knew if the financial system 

1051
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:01,440
fail,
no one knew if the economic system fail.

1052
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:04,740
No one knew if the world order had 
collapsed.

1053
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:06,233
And everyone watching those buildings 
fall was trying to perceive all those 

1054
01:12:11,491 --> 01:12:14,220
others have levels of reality at the 
same time.

1055
01:12:14,940 --> 01:12:15,990
Well,
that's really,

1056
01:12:15,991 --> 01:12:18,450
really complicated.
Well,

1057
01:12:18,451 --> 01:12:23,400
and then Bush offered people in easy out
in a prepared way out.

1058
01:12:23,401 --> 01:12:24,121
He said,
well,

1059
01:12:24,121 --> 01:12:24,954
the people who did this were evil and 
perhaps they were the people who did 

1060
01:12:29,071 --> 01:12:29,970
this.
We're evil,

1061
01:12:30,210 --> 01:12:32,070
we're good.
There should be a war.

1062
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:35,280
Now,
as far as I'm concerned,

1063
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:36,413
well,
that's a mythological explanation and 

1064
01:12:38,041 --> 01:12:38,874
it's,
it's,

1065
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:39,953
it's very easy for people to instantly 
put forth a mythological explanation 

1066
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:48,660
when chaos makes itself manifest.
Well,

1067
01:12:48,661 --> 01:12:49,494
of course,
the problem with our response to nine 

1068
01:12:51,031 --> 01:12:55,500
slash 11 was that almost every bit of it
was a lie.

1069
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:02,290
Um,
we know that the American government

1070
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:05,623
utilize the events of nine slash 11 to 
justify an invasion on Iraq that had 

1071
01:13:10,101 --> 01:13:10,934
been planned at least 10 years before 
that historical documentation of that 

1072
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:17,750
is,
is available from the people who did the

1073
01:13:17,751 --> 01:13:19,730
planning.
They're still part of bushes,

1074
01:13:19,731 --> 01:13:20,564
government.

1075
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,200
So
you asked about our response.

1076
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:30,730
Well,
you can't,

1077
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:33,420
I mean,
I think when,

1078
01:13:33,421 --> 01:13:36,160
when Bush went into Iraq,
people,

1079
01:13:36,161 --> 01:13:36,994
I had a legitimate debate about what 
should be done about tyrants like Sadam 

1080
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:41,623
Hussein because he was obviously a 
horrible person and his sons were even 

1081
01:13:44,301 --> 01:13:48,590
worse.
But the idea of that

1082
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:51,303
catastrophe consisting of the 
reemergence of chaos could be met by 

1083
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:59,170
dissimulation and conscious lies and 
that,

1084
01:13:59,171 --> 01:14:01,340
that would work out successfully.
Well,

1085
01:14:01,341 --> 01:14:06,260
that's,
I would say that's willfully blind,

1086
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:10,130
a corrupt and naive all at the same 
time.

1087
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:12,580
And that's what characterized our 
response,

1088
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:13,903
wasn't that response plan by a group who
were disciples and followers of a 

1089
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:20,840
philosopher called Strauss,
is that correct?

1090
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:22,230
Yes,
that's right.

1091
01:14:22,290 --> 01:14:22,851
That's right.
And,

1092
01:14:22,851 --> 01:14:27,851
and they had put a manifesto together 
back in the mid 19 nineties

1093
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:34,640
had written Clinton expressing their,
their need to invade Iraq.

1094
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:36,383
Um,
which,

1095
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:38,730
which I don't really think is the issue,
like I said,

1096
01:14:38,731 --> 01:14:39,564
because Saddam Hussein was a terrible 
person and it isn't clear that the 

1097
01:14:43,141 --> 01:14:47,730
international community exactly knows 
what to do with barbaric dictators.

1098
01:14:48,630 --> 01:14:49,463
The problem wasn't necessarily the idea 
that going after Saddam Hussein was 

1099
01:14:55,261 --> 01:14:56,094
justified.
The problem was that an event that had 

1100
01:14:59,311 --> 01:15:00,144
absolutely nothing to do with him was 
utilized in it absolutely deceitful 

1101
01:15:06,061 --> 01:15:06,894
manner by people who had a preexistent 
agenda to deceive their entire populous 

1102
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:13,193
and to justify and to use that as 
justification for doing something that 

1103
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:17,910
they had other reasons for doing it.

1104
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:23,780
When the,
when the justification for judging,

1105
01:15:23,781 --> 01:15:28,781
it seems that you have to be in order to
be able to judge as in Nuremberg,

1106
01:15:30,891 --> 01:15:33,030
the victors judged,
uh,

1107
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:35,450
the judge saying,
you know,

1108
01:15:35,451 --> 01:15:37,730
they put him on trial.
But otherwise,

1109
01:15:37,731 --> 01:15:38,960
as you said,
the world community,

1110
01:15:38,961 --> 01:15:41,820
you don't seem to know what to do 
otherwise with a,

1111
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:43,700
it seems complicated

1112
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:44,451
problem,
right?

1113
01:15:44,451 --> 01:15:45,284
I mean,
it's part of the problem we're talking 

1114
01:15:46,191 --> 01:15:50,720
about is what's the appropriate response
to the manifestation of evil.

1115
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:53,840
Well,
I would say generally speaking,

1116
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:57,290
evil is something best corralled in your
own life.

1117
01:15:58,190 --> 01:16:01,880
And once you more or less corralled in 
your own life,

1118
01:16:01,881 --> 01:16:04,880
if you have in fact manage that because 
that is a very,

1119
01:16:04,881 --> 01:16:05,714
very difficult thing to do.
Well then maybe you have something to 

1120
01:16:08,361 --> 01:16:10,970
say about it on a social level.
But,

1121
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:15,180
um,
we,

1122
01:16:15,430 --> 01:16:18,020
we con
people,

1123
01:16:18,021 --> 01:16:18,854
put the cart before the horse and many,
many individuals who are unable to make 

1124
01:16:23,181 --> 01:16:24,014
peace in their own house are perfectly 
willing to go out and try to make peace 

1125
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:28,310
in the world.
Well,

1126
01:16:28,580 --> 01:16:33,060
there's more Brisson ideology and that 
then there is intelligence.

1127
01:16:33,070 --> 01:16:34,240
And,
and,

1128
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:35,750
uh,
and portia,

1129
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:37,393
and this is something else you want to 
add about either Jordan or whether you 

1130
01:16:41,911 --> 01:16:46,911
want to talk more about you ideas you're
working on.

1131
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:48,303
Well,
there's just a,

1132
01:16:48,340 --> 01:16:49,173
just one thing I wanted to have.
I mentioned nine slash 11 and New 

1133
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:54,420
Orleans.

1134
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:55,550
Yes.
New Orleans

1135
01:16:55,550 --> 01:16:56,383
is another example of the death of the 
king and the reemergence of chaos being 

1136
01:17:01,641 --> 01:17:02,474
the same thing.
The chaos in genesis is watery and it's 

1137
01:17:08,331 --> 01:17:09,164
watery chaos that causes flood.
And the flood that God caused with 

1138
01:17:13,561 --> 01:17:18,300
regards to Noah was the reemergence of 
chaos because of a corrupt social order.

1139
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:21,030
On the same thing happened in New 
Orleans,

1140
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:25,710
on the one hand it was a storm,
so the storm caused the flooding,

1141
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:29,190
but on the other hand,
had the levies been four feet higher,

1142
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:30,353
there wouldn't have been a catastrophe.
So the fact that there was a flood of 

1143
01:17:33,451 --> 01:17:34,284
New Orleans is as much evidence that 
order was insufficient to hold chaos 

1144
01:17:40,441 --> 01:17:41,274
back as it is evidenced that the chaotic
hand of God is perfectly capable of 

1145
01:17:46,531 --> 01:17:48,090
causing natural disasters.

1146
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:54,403
Exactly.

1147
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:57,490
And it was not just disorder but 
corruption,

1148
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:01,780
right?
So it's archaic cultural systems,

1149
01:18:01,930 --> 01:18:02,763
the,
the levies there were too old and 

1150
01:18:04,511 --> 01:18:06,280
starting to deteriorate.
So there's,

1151
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:07,173
they deteriorate of their own accord.
Plus the deterioration is sped along by 

1152
01:18:11,591 --> 01:18:12,424
the fact that the people who are 
punitively in charge of them aren't 

1153
01:18:14,321 --> 01:18:16,150
taking their responsibility seriously.

1154
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:22,340
Metaphor.
That reminds me in Australia,

1155
01:18:24,481 --> 01:18:25,314
on the beaches that have been shark 
attacks where they have short sentences 

1156
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:32,280
in the,
um,

1157
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:33,113
in the sea which has not been repaired,
and there are holes in the fences are 

1158
01:18:38,030 --> 01:18:41,310
getting through and attacking surface is
the same.

1159
01:18:42,510 --> 01:18:43,343
The same

1160
01:18:44,830 --> 01:18:45,663
example
popped into your mind is because of the 

1161
01:18:49,451 --> 01:18:54,430
mythological equivalence you see,
because the underwater creature,

1162
01:18:54,431 --> 01:18:59,431
that terrible human devouring underwater
creature is a prime,

1163
01:18:59,741 --> 01:19:02,130
mythological,
cool representation of chaos.

1164
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,650
So for example,
a mat in the Enuma elish who's basically

1165
01:19:07,651 --> 01:19:11,100
the model for the Leviathan is an 
underwater drag,

1166
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:16,170
an underwater devouring dragon,
and she's the prime symbol of chaos.

1167
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:17,393
And so I would say your example was 
brought to mind by the mythological 

1168
01:19:20,731 --> 01:19:24,240
equivalent between the two,
between the two occurrences

1169
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:32,890
hearing you discuss your ideas and your 
work maps of meaning.

1170
01:19:32,891 --> 01:19:35,500
Could you please tell us where this book
is available?

1171
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:36,553
Well,
I would say the simplest place to find 

1172
01:19:38,601 --> 01:19:42,920
it at Amazon,
if you go to my website,

1173
01:19:42,921 --> 01:19:45,490
which is maps of meaning Dotcom,

1174
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:46,200
right?

1175
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:51,200
There are lectures on the book televised
by Canadian Public Television and,

1176
01:19:52,171 --> 01:19:53,004
uh,
links to places the book can be 

1177
01:19:54,211 --> 01:19:58,320
purchased.
So that's probably the simplest thing to

1178
01:19:58,321 --> 01:19:59,154
do.

1179
01:20:06,780 --> 01:20:08,010
You'll your,
your,

1180
01:20:08,011 --> 01:20:09,570
um,
lecturing,

1181
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:12,450
or are you touring or what's happening 
now?

1182
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:13,843
Well,
I've written recently a few papers on 

1183
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:21,750
the nature of self deception,
which is a very paradoxical concept.

1184
01:20:22,411 --> 01:20:23,244
Um,
self deception implies that at least in 

1185
01:20:26,241 --> 01:20:27,074
its classical formulations that a person
knows something and doesn't know 

1186
01:20:30,381 --> 01:20:31,214
something at the same time,
which is a problematic conceptually for 

1187
01:20:35,601 --> 01:20:38,660
a variety of reasons.
I've been trying to crack that problem.

1188
01:20:38,970 --> 01:20:39,803
Um,
I've also been attempting to recast our 

1189
01:20:44,151 --> 01:20:46,940
models of neuropsychological 
functioning.

1190
01:20:47,410 --> 01:20:48,243
I'm starting from the presupposition 
that what the mind encounters is much 

1191
01:20:54,231 --> 01:20:59,231
more properly conceptualized as an 
information rich matrix of relationships

1192
01:21:00,621 --> 01:21:04,460
than it is conceptualized as a place of 
material objects.

1193
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:10,060
And that's following to some degree the 
ideas of the physicist wheeler who was a

1194
01:21:12,290 --> 01:21:15,470
student of nails for I believe,
who,

1195
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:16,453
who has hypothesized that the 
fundamental elements of matter are more 

1196
01:21:22,101 --> 01:21:27,050
like bit more like computer bits of 
information than they are.

1197
01:21:27,051 --> 01:21:29,390
Like something classically material.

1198
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:43,490
The causes is the events that happen.

1199
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:45,383
Well,
it does seem related to that in some 

1200
01:21:47,351 --> 01:21:48,184
manner
that I described earlier about the 

1201
01:21:55,241 --> 01:21:59,260
capacity of human consciousness to make 
order out of chaos.

1202
01:21:59,950 --> 01:22:00,783
I personally believe,
and this is partly because of what I've 

1203
01:22:03,491 --> 01:22:05,620
learned from reading religious 
mythology,

1204
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:11,040
that human consciousness realizes the 
world in some non metaphorical sense.

1205
01:22:12,961 --> 01:22:15,190
I cry,
I'm not a materialist,

1206
01:22:15,610 --> 01:22:20,610
and I truly believe that if human 
consciousness did not exist,

1207
01:22:22,450 --> 01:22:27,450
the idea that there would be existence 
is in some manner wrong.

1208
01:22:27,970 --> 01:22:28,803
I think existence is dependent on 
consciousness and I've been trying to 

1209
01:22:33,491 --> 01:22:34,324
work out the implications of that idea 
in a scientifically rigorous manner and 

1210
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:44,650
that constitutes partly what I've been 
writing about recently.

1211
01:22:50,350 --> 01:22:54,180
Granted,
if you can sit here and talk about,

1212
01:22:54,690 --> 01:22:56,430
let's talk about,
for instance,

1213
01:22:56,431 --> 01:22:57,880
think of the first world

1214
01:22:57,990 --> 01:22:58,823
war

1215
01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:03,740
and we think that this happened,
that happened,

1216
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:04,743
et cetera.
You can think about the great 

1217
01:23:05,741 --> 01:23:06,574
depression.
Neither you nor I were alive at the 

1218
01:23:09,761 --> 01:23:10,594
time.

1219
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:11,883
Yeah,

1220
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:16,000
but we take it for granted that it 
happened.

1221
01:23:17,310 --> 01:23:19,500
Now,
if you go from now,

1222
01:23:19,710 --> 01:23:24,710
today and you go forward 100 years,
neither you nor I will be alive then,

1223
01:23:27,070 --> 01:23:29,080
but that shouldn't worry us should it?

1224
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:31,893
Well,
I would say that the are being would 

1225
01:23:34,061 --> 01:23:37,030
still be embedded in the matrix of 
reality,

1226
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:37,973
right?

1227
01:23:39,370 --> 01:23:44,370
Because the things fulled up in a way 
the past folds up and it's still present

1228
01:23:47,951 --> 01:23:51,760
in the present and the future is not yet
unfolded.

1229
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:52,753
Implicit in the present,
and I would say just as none of your 

1230
01:23:58,481 --> 01:23:59,314
deeds do you just as you cannot escape 
from the consequences of any of your 

1231
01:24:04,391 --> 01:24:09,391
deeds,
the record of your being and the and the

1232
01:24:09,911 --> 01:24:14,911
nature of that being is embedded in the 
fabric of reality permanently,

1233
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:22,020
possibly what we can of a manmade 
abstraction.

1234
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:25,210
Maybe there is no such thing as time.

1235
01:24:27,030 --> 01:24:27,863
Well there is for us and what that means
in some ultimate sense is obviously not 

1236
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:32,953
a conceptually accessible to us.
I think that's part of the reason why 

1237
01:24:39,390 --> 01:24:40,223
it's possible to realize that the 
implications of your behavior and your 

1238
01:24:43,561 --> 01:24:44,394
conceptions reverberate far past you.
Things are not necessarily precisely 

1239
01:24:50,701 --> 01:24:51,600
what they seem.

1240
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:54,713
