1
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,493
Okay.

2
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,770
Welcome to the waking up podcast.
This is Sam Harris.

3
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,200
Okay,
well today back by popular demand,

4
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,243
I have Jordan Peterson.
Jordan is a clinical psychologist and 

5
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:36,520
professor at the University of Toronto.
He formerly taught at Harvard University

6
00:00:36,521 --> 00:00:41,521
and he is published articles on drug 
abuse and alcoholism and aggression,

7
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,090
but he has made a special focus on 
tyranny and a of late,

8
00:00:47,361 --> 00:00:48,194
he has,
I've been fighting a pitched battle 

9
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:51,114
against political correctness up in 
Canada and he's attracted a lot of 

10
00:00:54,861 --> 00:00:59,000
support and criticism on that front.
As I said last time around,

11
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,203
he is far and away the most requested 
guests I've ever had and we did a 

12
00:01:04,371 --> 00:01:05,204
podcast about four or so episodes back 
entitled what is true podcast number 62 

13
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:11,923
and that to the disappointment of 
everyone was a fairly brutal slog 

14
00:01:16,611 --> 00:01:19,890
through differing conceptions of 
epistemology.

15
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,350
You've ever the phrase bogged down 
applied to a podcast.

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,790
I it applied there.
Some people enjoyed it,

17
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:28,440
but most of you didn't.
Okay.

18
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,100
But as I say in the conversation today 
with Jordan,

19
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,220
I did a poll online and 30,000 of you 
responded and 81% wanted us to try again

20
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,500
because there was much more to talk 
about and as it turns out there was,

21
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,050
we had a much better conversation this 
time around.

22
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,170
It was very collegial and if you have 
anything to say about it,

23
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,373
feel free to reach out to Jordan and me 
on twitter or make noise wherever you 

24
00:01:52,201 --> 00:01:55,110
want.
And now I bring you Jordan Peterson.

25
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,470
I am back here with Jordan Peterson.
Jordan,

26
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:04,170
thanks for coming back on the podcast.
My pleasure.

27
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,800
Let's just take a moment to bring people
up to speed.

28
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,470
While we can assume many of heard our 
previous effort at this all won't have.

29
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:16,430
So we did a podcast a little over a 
month ago.

30
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:21,660
It was podcasts 62 I believe on my list 
and it went fairly haywire.

31
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,703
We intended to speak about many things 
but got bogged down on the question of 

32
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:29,910
what it means to say that a proposition 
is true.

33
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,740
And I considered this actually a very 
interesting problem in philosophy,

34
00:02:33,741 --> 00:02:37,860
but it seemed to me that we got stuck at
a point that wasn't very interesting and

35
00:02:37,861 --> 00:02:38,694
many of our listeners felt the same.
And at the time I didn't let the 

36
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:43,544
conversation proceed to other topics 
because I felt that it would just be 

37
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:46,963
pointless.
I knew you wanted to talk about things 

38
00:02:48,141 --> 00:02:48,974
like the validity of religious faith and
he jungian archetypes and many other 

39
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,423
controversial things.
And I felt if we couldn't agree on what 

40
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,920
separates fact from fantasy,

41
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,100
we would just be doomed to talk past one
another.

42
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,593
I think it's,
it's still possible we are doomed to 

43
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:09,700
talk past one another,
but we ran a,

44
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,583
a twitter poll after our first podcast 
and despite all the complaints I 

45
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:19,210
received about our conversation,
81% of people wanted us to make a second

46
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:20,044
attempt.
I think 30,000 people answered that 

47
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,534
pole.
So it was a considerable number of 

48
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:26,710
people.
I decided we should give our people what

49
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,603
most of them claim to want and um,
we'll just see how it goes because I 

50
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,450
don't want us to fight the same battle 
all over again.

51
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:35,284
I think listeners who are curious about 
how that last conversation went can 

52
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:43,801
listen to it and I'm sure the topic of 
truth and falsity will come up.

53
00:03:43,901 --> 00:03:44,734
But if it does,
I think the best thing to do is kind of 

54
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:50,350
flag it on the fly and move on.

55
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,183
And I think this will be an exercise in 
seeing just how much can profitably be 

56
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:55,174
said across differing epistemologies.
Would that warning about the various 

57
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:01,020
road hazards?
Uh,

58
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:03,110
I think we should just see where we wind
up and I,

59
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:03,944
I think it could be someplace 
interesting because you and I appeared 

60
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:12,340
share many of the same concerns.
I think we both find the question of how

61
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:15,670
to live in this world to be the most 
important one.

62
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,653
And I think we're equally concerned 
about some of the very well subscribed 

63
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:23,710
answers to that question that are 
obviously wrong.

64
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,560
And so I think we should just do our 
best to,

65
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,370
to make sense.
And see where it goes.

66
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,900
Well,
I hope so too.

67
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:30,040
That seems right.
I mean,

68
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,520
you place a tremendous emphasis on moral
necessity of the spoken truth and that's

69
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,010
certainly something that I'm in accord 
with.

70
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,203
And you're also concerned with ethics in
relationship to the alleviation of 

71
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:45,724
suffering from,
from what I've been able to understand 

72
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,430
from what I,
from what I've read of your writings and

73
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,640
your also very much concerned with the 
relationship between scientific fact and

74
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:57,514
value.
And so we do share this intense concern 

75
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:01,744
about the same domain and I think for 
many of the same reasons and I think 

76
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:05,943
that you're an outstanding exponent of 
your particular position and that makes 

77
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:13,540
you an excellent person to talk about 
these things with.

78
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,673
I was actually going to start with a bit
of an apology because I listened to our 

79
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:21,460
talk twice trying to figure out where it
went off the rails.

80
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:26,080
It actually went okay for the first hour
and then we got bogged down in the truth

81
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:29,590
issue.
And I think I made a couple of strategic

82
00:05:29,591 --> 00:05:31,600
errors,
which I hope not to repeat.

83
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,650
The first one was that,
um,

84
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,583
I started the conversation by more or 
less accusing you of being 

85
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:41,980
insufficiently Darwinian and that was 
designed to be,

86
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,413
I thought playful and provocative.
But when I listened to our conversation 

87
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:47,914
again,
I thought that that wasn't very wise 

88
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:49,924
strategic move.
That was one mistake I made in the 

89
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:52,804
second mistake I made was that I had 
just read a number of things that you 

90
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,483
had written and I told you a lot about 
what you thought instead of letting you 

91
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,640
say it.
And I was doing that partly,

92
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,653
well partly because there is an argument
to be had here and I suppose partly 

93
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:10,904
because I was nervous but also partly to
demonstrate that I had actually 

94
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,133
familiarized myself with what you had 
read and I want to do indicate or what 

95
00:06:18,801 --> 00:06:22,430
you had written and I wanted to indicate
to you that I was taking it seriously.

96
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,293
But I'm going to try to not be the least
bit provocative in that manner during 

97
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:28,034
this conversation because I really do 
think that we have something important 

98
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:31,604
to talk about.
And I think that that's why so many 

99
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:34,790
people actually want to listen to us 
talk.

100
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,740
So anyways,
hopefully we get bogged down just in the

101
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:42,050
interest of completing that bit of 
housekeeping.

102
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,140
I don't think the first was an error at 
all.

103
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:45,974
I mean to say that I'm being 
insufficiently Darwinian is provocative 

104
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,340
and I don't take it in the least bit 
personally.

105
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,680
We just didn't find a path through that 
particular thesis that we could Converge

106
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,513
On.
As far as the second point telling me 

107
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:03,740
what I think in advance of our actually 
hitting that topic.

108
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:04,574
I think that is,
that's the almost certainly a mistake 

109
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,420
with me or,
or anyone.

110
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,630
And that's fine that you did that 
postmortem and I,

111
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:12,630
and I agree with that bit.

112
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,053
So let's just start with a clean slate 
here and I think kind of a natural 

113
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:20,510
starting point would be to ask you,
and again,

114
00:07:20,511 --> 00:07:23,270
I've heard a few of the things you've 
said on this topic,

115
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:27,560
but I'll just let you invent yourself a 
new however it strikes you.

116
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:33,070
What is the relationship in your view 
between science and religion?

117
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:34,963
Well,
I think that religious systems are 

118
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:38,354
descriptions of how people ought to act.
And I think that the way that I think 

119
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:48,050
that those rows in a cause I 
evolutionary manner.

120
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,480
And so imagine,
imagine the,

121
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,750
the dominance hierarchy structure of a 
chimpanzee troop or a wolf pack.

122
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,210
Okay.
So we'll,

123
00:07:59,211 --> 00:08:00,044
we'll use the,
the wolf idea first and then switch if 

124
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:03,970
it's okay to the chimpanzee idea.
Hmm.

125
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,323
So as a consequence of the behavioral 
actions and interactions among social 

126
00:08:10,761 --> 00:08:13,660
animals,
you could think of something as a,

127
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,283
something that might be described as a 
procedural covenant arising and that 

128
00:08:19,971 --> 00:08:24,530
would be the animals knowledge of the 
structure of the dominance hierarchy,

129
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:25,364
which is kind of ill named.
But we'll use that for now so that 

130
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,830
there's a,
there's a hierarchy of,

131
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,203
of,
of rank and every animal in the social 

132
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:38,090
community understands that hierarchy of 
rank.

133
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,910
That's essentially the culture of the,
of the,

134
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:41,983
of the troop or the or the pack.
And there's an implicit recognition of 

135
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:50,570
the value of each individual within 
that,

136
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,040
that troop or pack such that,
for example,

137
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,130
two wolves

138
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,173
square off in a dominance dispute.
Of course they puff themselves up to 

139
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:05,580
make to make themselves look large and 
they growl at each other and they engage

140
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:06,414
in throws,
just threatening displays and generally 

141
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:13,941
speaking the wolf that ha that has the 
lowest threshold for anxiety.

142
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:19,491
Activation will capitulate first 
generally without much more than the the

143
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:25,970
pose of a fight and rollover and expose 
his neck and then the dominant wolf will

144
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:33,650
not deign to tear it out basically and 
you could think of the wolves acting out

145
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,523
what you would describe propositionally 
as respect for each individual's value 

146
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,800
and then in the chimp troops,
friends to walls.

147
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:47,634
Research has indicated for example that 
if the dominant Turkey is only based on 

148
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:53,394
brute force and that chimp out the top 
who's generally male is there because 

149
00:09:57,961 --> 00:10:00,450
he's a barbarian dictator,
let's say.

150
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:06,020
Then he's very likely to be taken out by
two male chimps,

151
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,663
three quarters his power who are much 
better at social bonding and who made a 

152
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:14,544
very tight compact between one another 
and and so that the chimp troop that's 

153
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:22,380
based on a tyranny is unstable.

154
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:26,820
What de Waal indicated was that the 
chimp tropes that tend to be more stable

155
00:10:26,821 --> 00:10:27,654
are run by dominant males who actually 
are very good at social bonding and 

156
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:32,184
reciprocity and who pay a fair bit of 
attention to the females and infants in 

157
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,624
the troop.
So the dominants isn't power so much as 

158
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,500
as it might as you might think of as 
good politics.

159
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,710
And so if there's an emergent ethic 
that,

160
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,813
and I truly believe it's emergent ethic 
that's very similar to what piaget 

161
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,420
described as emerging among children 
when they play games,

162
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,170
that not only specifies the nature of 
the social contract,

163
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,033
let's say,
but also is structured as if the 

164
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:06,960
individuals within the social contract 
have some implicit value.

165
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,993
So imagine that as human beings diverged
away from their chimpanzee progenitors 

166
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:16,261
there,
you know,

167
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:18,450
the common ancestor we have with 
chimpanzees,

168
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,140
we already started to act out this 
ethic.

169
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,490
It was coded in our procedures to speak 
technically because we have a procedural

170
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:29,850
memory.
And then as we develop cortically,

171
00:11:29,851 --> 00:11:33,360
we watch each other and,
and ourselves very,

172
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:36,480
very intently.
And once we develop language,

173
00:11:36,481 --> 00:11:37,314
we were able to start encapsulating that
procedural ethic first in stories and 

174
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,243
that story.
Those stories were partly about what a 

175
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,540
very well structured procedural ethic 
might be and how it might go wrong,

176
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:52,883
but also about how an individual within 
that procedural ethic should be treated 

177
00:11:57,521 --> 00:12:01,840
and should act.
And the storytelling,

178
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,453
which was the mapping of that procedure 
was the birthplace of the image and 

179
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:12,970
story basis of religious ideation as far
as I can tell.

180
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,433
So that's the basic thesis.
It's like Piaget's notion that children 

181
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,010
when they first come together to learn a
game,

182
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,290
if they're,
if they're young enough,

183
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,120
they can play the game when they're 
together,

184
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,070
but if you take them out of the game and
ask them individually about the rules,

185
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:35,140
they give widely disparate accounts so 
they've got the procedure in place,

186
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:38,470
but they haven't got the episodic 
representation.

187
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,840
Technically speaking,
it's only in,

188
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,823
it's only once they become more 
linguistically sophisticated that they 

189
00:12:45,491 --> 00:12:48,760
can actually come up with a coherent 
representation of the rules.

190
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,050
And then it's only later when they start
to construe themselves,

191
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,790
not merely as followers of the rules,
but also as originators of the rules.

192
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:01,720
And that's akin to the recognition of,
I would say,

193
00:13:01,721 --> 00:13:04,780
constructive individuality in 
relationship to the state.

194
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,420
And so I see these things as very,
very,

195
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:12,421
very deeply biologically predicated.
Where's the concept of an archetype come

196
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:14,800
into this picture?
Well,

197
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:15,820
okay,
imagine this,

198
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:17,710
Sam,
you tell me what you think about this.

199
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,500
So you know how if you,
if you have a,

200
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,670
can I tell you just a two minutes story?
So,

201
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:25,504
okay.
So one time I was at the hockey rink 

202
00:13:26,501 --> 00:13:29,530
with my son and he was playing,
he was young,

203
00:13:29,531 --> 00:13:30,364
he was about 12,
and they were playing his championship 

204
00:13:32,741 --> 00:13:34,420
game in this little league that they 
had.

205
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:35,770
And,
uh,

206
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:36,603
my son was pretty good hockey player,
but there was a kid on the team who was 

207
00:13:38,691 --> 00:13:41,080
better than him who was kind of the 
star,

208
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,213
but he was,
uh,

209
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,410
he was a diva,
you know,

210
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,800
and even though he would score goals and
all of that,

211
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:48,634
he wouldn't pass and he wouldn't,
he wasn't facilitating the development 

212
00:13:51,881 --> 00:13:54,880
of any of the other team members.
And so anyways,

213
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:57,670
we watched this game and it was very 
close.

214
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:01,360
It was a very exciting game.
And in the final few minutes of the last

215
00:14:01,361 --> 00:14:02,194
period,
the other team scored and my son's team 

216
00:14:06,071 --> 00:14:08,920
and this,
this stars team lost.

217
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:12,070
And so then the kids went off the ice 
and that,

218
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,083
and the diva kid smashed his hockey 
stick on the cement and started to 

219
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,600
complain bitterly about how unfair the 
game is.

220
00:14:19,601 --> 00:14:20,434
And then his,
his idiot father came running up to him 

221
00:14:22,751 --> 00:14:26,080
and told him how unfair the raffing had 
be and how,

222
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:29,440
and how it was stolen from them and how 
catastrophic all of that was.

223
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,520
And I thought it was one of the most 
highness displays of poor parenting that

224
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:35,230
I'd ever seen.
Now.

225
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:36,510
So there's,
there's a,

226
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,413
there's a moral of that story.
So his kid was very good at playing 

227
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:41,614
hockey,
but he wasn't very good at being a good 

228
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:45,940
player.
And so,

229
00:14:45,941 --> 00:14:47,170
you know,
you always tell your kids,

230
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,850
doesn't matter whether you win or lose 
it,

231
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,863
it matters how you play the game.
And of course you don't know what that 

232
00:14:52,611 --> 00:14:56,300
means and neither does the kid.
And it's often a mystery to the kid what

233
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:58,550
that means because obviously you're 
trying to win.

234
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,230
But,
but imagine it this way.

235
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:06,190
Imagine that human beings,
that the goal of human life isn't to win

236
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,273
the game.
The goal of human life in some sense is 

237
00:15:11,091 --> 00:15:11,924
to win the set of all possible games.
And in order to win the set of all 

238
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:17,144
possible games,
you don't need to win any particular 

239
00:15:20,061 --> 00:15:20,720
game.

240
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,190
You have to play in a manner that 
ensures that you will be invited to play

241
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:30,191
more and more games.
And so when you tell your children to be

242
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:35,000
good sports to play properly,
what you mean is play to win,

243
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:35,834
but play to win in such a way that 
people on your team are happy to play 

244
00:15:39,741 --> 00:15:40,574
with you and people on the other teams 
are happy to play with you and so that 

245
00:15:43,491 --> 00:15:46,580
you keep getting invite,
getting invited to games.

246
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:50,710
Now if you think of each game as a,
as a,

247
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:54,740
uh,
small hierarchy of value or dominance,

248
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,080
then obviously the appropriate thing is 
to move up the hierarchy.

249
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:04,790
But that's what animals do is they move 
up to in their specific hierarchy.

250
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,760
But because human beings are capable of 
abstraction,

251
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,043
we've been able to conceptualize the 
hierarchy as such rather than any 

252
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:14,384
specific one.
And then also to characterize a mode of 

253
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:18,164
being that is most likely to move you up
the hierarchy no matter what that 

254
00:16:21,651 --> 00:16:22,700
hierarchy is.

255
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:26,300
And as far as I can tell,
that's the archetype of the hero.

256
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,180
The hero is the person who's most likely
to move up any given dominance hierarchy

257
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,260
at any time in any place.
And the hero is also,

258
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,820
and then so that the nature of that 
archetipal hero first was acted out.

259
00:16:40,821 --> 00:16:42,980
It was,
it was laid out in procedure and then it

260
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:46,100
was acted out and then it was described.
But it's also,

261
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,870
it's multidimensional.
It's not only he who plays to be invited

262
00:16:50,871 --> 00:16:51,704
to play again,
but also he who goes out into the great 

263
00:16:56,181 --> 00:17:00,500
unknown to face chaos and the dangers 
there,

264
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:01,334
but to gather what's valuable as a 
consequence and to bring it back to the 

265
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:06,290
community.
And that's the,

266
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:09,590
that's the basis of the Dragon Myth 
archetype,

267
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:12,980
which is of course plays out in art and 
literature throat.

268
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:16,130
While throughout recorded history,
the oldest story we have,

269
00:17:16,131 --> 00:17:19,100
which is the Enuma elish from 
Mesopotamia,

270
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:19,963
is a,
a story about Marduk who's the culture 

271
00:17:22,401 --> 00:17:23,234
hero and also the,
the highest God in the Mesopotamian 

272
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,410
Pantheon.

273
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,243
He confronts the Dragon of chaos,
cuts her into pieces and makes the 

274
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:34,010
world,
in fact,

275
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:38,390
one of his names was nam,
I can't remember the name unfortunately,

276
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,224
but it meant he who creates ingenious 
things as a consequence of the combat 

277
00:17:43,641 --> 00:17:45,830
was tie a Matt who's the dragon of 
chaos.

278
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:46,664
So he cuts off,
he counts up to the unknown into pieces 

279
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,650
and makes ingenious things out of them.
And it's a perfect description of,

280
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,323
of the human archetype.
It's the fact that we are hyper 

281
00:17:58,751 --> 00:18:03,390
exploratory and that we use our capacity
to explore the dangerous unknown,

282
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,224
to gather the treasure that lies there 
and then to distribute it to the 

283
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:08,770
community.
So,

284
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,123
and that,
in terms of the evolution of that 

285
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:12,331
archetype,
Sam,

286
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:13,800
think about it this way.
Okay.

287
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,820
Again,
you could tell me what you,

288
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:21,140
what you think about this.
So we know that roughly speaking,

289
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:25,790
that human females mate across and up 
dominance hierarchies,

290
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,960
whereas chimpanzee females are 
nonselective majors,

291
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,093
the dominant chimps,
males will chase away the subordinate 

292
00:18:33,251 --> 00:18:35,560
chimps from that female's in estrus.

293
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,520
And so they're more likely to have 
offspring.

294
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,400
Okay.
The females will mate with anyone,

295
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:42,523
whereas human females are very selective
and they have hidden ovulation and they 

296
00:18:45,441 --> 00:18:47,830
mate across and up dominance 
hierarchies.

297
00:18:47,831 --> 00:18:52,831
So imagine the woman once the man who's 
most capable of rising up the set of all

298
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:54,934
dominance hierarchies.
So what happens is she outsources that 

299
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:03,520
problem to the computational capacity of
the male hierarchy.

300
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:06,400
And she let's the man fight it out among
themselves,

301
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:10,150
compete and cooperate to determine who 
the best man is.

302
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,390
He's provided with the majority of the 
meeting opportunities.

303
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,573
And so that's how the extended religious
phenotype manifests itself in 

304
00:19:20,711 --> 00:19:24,280
evolutionary space,
which was something that you and Richard

305
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,960
Dawkins,
we're wondering about the last time that

306
00:19:25,961 --> 00:19:28,240
you talked,
like it's not psychopathy,

307
00:19:28,241 --> 00:19:30,480
which was in some sense,
you know,

308
00:19:30,481 --> 00:19:33,030
you were thinking about the charismatic 
liar,

309
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:35,940
but really what's being selected for is 
the,

310
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,243
the,
the consciousness because that's the 

311
00:19:39,031 --> 00:19:39,864
right way of thinking about it.
That's best able to rise across the set 

312
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:47,760
of all dominance hierarchies and females
are selecting very hard for that,

313
00:19:47,761 --> 00:19:48,594
which is at least in part why we've had 
this tremendously expanded cortical 

314
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:52,724
capacity.

315
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,233
Well,
let me see if I can wade into this 

316
00:19:55,621 --> 00:20:00,621
picture and find places of agreement and
disagreement for clarity sake.

317
00:20:02,381 --> 00:20:03,214
I think it's useful to distinguish 
between two different intellectual 

318
00:20:06,531 --> 00:20:11,531
projects here with respect to values and
morality and the question of just how to

319
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:13,584
live in this world,
which is aren't at least nominal 

320
00:20:14,911 --> 00:20:17,310
starting point first.
There's the,

321
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,230
the description of how we got here,
right?

322
00:20:20,231 --> 00:20:21,064
And this captures all of evolutionary 
psychology and much of what you just 

323
00:20:26,231 --> 00:20:27,820
began to say about

324
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,440
selection pressures with respect to 
dominance hierarchies and you know,

325
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:37,441
the kind of heroic male mate female apes
will find attractive and all that.

326
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:39,923
Then you can add religion to that as 
perhaps an extended phenotype or the 

327
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,023
possibility of group selection pressure.
We are more religious tribes have a way 

328
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:51,910
of organizing themselves in a more 
durable way than,

329
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:54,130
than less religious tribes.
And therefore we have,

330
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,383
there's something Ian,
our evolutionary history that has 

331
00:20:57,281 --> 00:20:58,114
selected for religiosity,
say an overarching story that unites 

332
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:06,691
non-kin in a way that is more energizing
than some other story.

333
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,403
You know,
I don't really have much of a dog in 

334
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,770
that fight.
I think some of that as plausible.

335
00:21:14,771 --> 00:21:15,604
Some of it isn't.
I think group selection though you 

336
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:20,290
haven't mentioned it,
is working to some degree in the,

337
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:24,100
in the background of this way of talking
about religion in evolutionary terms.

338
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,933
And at the moment I happen to be 
convinced that group selection is 

339
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,590
implausible and based on some bad 
analogies.

340
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,060
But again,
this is not,

341
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,103
this doesn't strike me as important for 
this conversation or for really for 

342
00:21:38,141 --> 00:21:38,974
anything that I've written about the 
relationship between morality and 

343
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:42,394
science or facts and values because I 
view this problem of describing how we 

344
00:21:46,091 --> 00:21:46,924
got here,
how is it that apes like ourselves have 

345
00:21:49,991 --> 00:21:54,340
the moral attitudes and concerns that we
have?

346
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,473
That's a distinct project which was 
quite separate from the question of 

347
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:00,843
deciding how we should live now given 
what we are and given the opportunities 

348
00:22:04,631 --> 00:22:05,464
available to us and given the way in 
which are continually flying the perch 

349
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:11,403
that has been prepared for us by 
evolution with our technology and with 

350
00:22:15,131 --> 00:22:20,131
our institutions and with our new moral 
norms that have absolutely nothing to do

351
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,810
with ancient selection pressures.

352
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,450
And this is even true in a religious 
context.

353
00:22:25,451 --> 00:22:28,840
So you have in many religions,
perhaps even most,

354
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:29,913
you have certain ideals that could never
have been selected for because they are 

355
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:38,560
the antithesis of anything that would 
offer an adaptive advantage.

356
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,450
Celibacy,
for instance,

357
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:44,860
anyone who was committed to celibacy in 
our ancient past by definition,

358
00:22:44,861 --> 00:22:45,694
didn't breed.
You could say that they might've helped 

359
00:22:48,281 --> 00:22:49,114
their kin,
but still celibacy is not an ideal that 

360
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,133
you can make much Darwinian sense of and
yet you can have the most committed 

361
00:22:56,861 --> 00:23:01,480
adherence of any faith tending toward a 
life of celibacy.

362
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,463
At the very least,
promiscuity is taboo in most religious 

363
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:06,184
traditions.
Now I'm not taking a position that 

364
00:23:07,331 --> 00:23:08,164
that's a good thing or a bad thing.
I'm just saying that this is where 

365
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:14,140
evolution is no longer relevant to a 
discussion of how people should live and

366
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:18,910
as I think I said in in a blog response 
to some of the things you said after our

367
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:19,744
first podcast,
if you want it to just take a jeans I 

368
00:23:22,511 --> 00:23:27,310
view of how human beings should live,
especially how men should live.

369
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,263
Well then you,
you would conclude that given current 

370
00:23:30,941 --> 00:23:31,774
opportunities,
every man should be passionately 

371
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:35,614
committed to doing more or less nothing 
but donate his sperm to a sperm bank 

372
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:46,070
because then he would could father 
possibly tens of thousands of

373
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:51,070
offspring for whom he would have no 
financial or emotional responsibility.

374
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,223
From a Darwinian perspective,
that should be every guy's deepest 

375
00:23:55,111 --> 00:23:55,944
dream.
You should just get up in the morning 

376
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:00,880
with just a commitment to that project 
unlike any other,

377
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:01,803
they could be discovered in life.
So we have motives and norms and 

378
00:24:06,281 --> 00:24:11,281
concerns that don't narrowly track a 
gene level analysis of what we should be

379
00:24:12,441 --> 00:24:14,480
doing.
So I just put that out there.

380
00:24:14,481 --> 00:24:15,314
I think the more interesting 
conversation is not to talk about how 

381
00:24:19,701 --> 00:24:22,550
apes like ourselves could have gotten 
religion,

382
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,503
but to talk about what we should do 
given the way the world is now and what 

383
00:24:27,191 --> 00:24:29,710
we seem to know about it through 
science.

384
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,940
Well that,
that's fine.

385
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,480
I just want to make a couple of comments
about that.

386
00:24:34,481 --> 00:24:35,314
I mean,
the hypotheses that I'm proposing is 

387
00:24:37,801 --> 00:24:39,850
certainly not dependent on groups 
election,

388
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,160
so we can leave that one aside.
As far as I'm,

389
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,283
I know,
I think the jury's out on the ultimate 

390
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:47,434
validity of the idea of group selection,
but I'm not interested in going down 

391
00:24:50,231 --> 00:24:52,850
that rabbit hole because it doesn't 
matter to me one way or another.

392
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:55,860
It really how that's resolved with 
regards to

393
00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:01,350
the potential validity of evolutionarily
derived motivations to the present day,

394
00:25:01,511 --> 00:25:03,340
I think.
I think that's more complicated.

395
00:25:03,341 --> 00:25:04,160
So

396
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,870
the first thing I would say is that

397
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:11,230
I believe there has been a central march
forward with this set of very productive

398
00:25:11,231 --> 00:25:14,550
ideas as human beings have evolved their
morality,

399
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,740
but those have spun off 
counterproductive,

400
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,540
evolutionary dead ends,
like everything doesn't,

401
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,280
it's possible,
for example,

402
00:25:22,281 --> 00:25:23,114
that celibacy is one of those with 
regards to the donation to sperm bank 

403
00:25:27,941 --> 00:25:28,774
idea.
I mean that's essentially the mosquito 

404
00:25:30,601 --> 00:25:32,590
away of propagation,
right?

405
00:25:32,591 --> 00:25:34,910
And that's it's our versus k,
is that the,

406
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:38,250
is that the correct terminology?
I don't remember it correctly.

407
00:25:38,251 --> 00:25:41,280
But there's two fundamentally different 
strategies,

408
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:44,600
extreme strategies for propagating 
yourself in the world.

409
00:25:44,601 --> 00:25:46,930
And one is to disseminate

410
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,530
yourself as widely as possible

411
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:53,050
and let the offspring live or die as 
they may,

412
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:56,180
which would be the sperm bank approach.
And then there's the other one,

413
00:25:56,181 --> 00:26:00,680
which is high investment in children,
which is maybe take it to its extreme in

414
00:26:00,681 --> 00:26:01,514
human beings.
And so we're tilt to them a lot more 

415
00:26:03,241 --> 00:26:04,074
towards that.
And so you can't really imagine a human 

416
00:26:06,961 --> 00:26:07,794
being being motivated to take the 
mosquito approach because that's really 

417
00:26:10,531 --> 00:26:11,810
not built into us.
But,

418
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,630
but that isn't to say that he sexual 
morality,

419
00:26:15,631 --> 00:26:16,464
that's part and parcel of our being,
which seems to 10 relatively strongly 

420
00:26:19,981 --> 00:26:24,270
towards monogamy for example,
as marriage is a human universal,

421
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,570
although there are variations of it.
Hmm.

422
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,753
We're still very much tilted towards the
high investment in single offspring 

423
00:26:32,051 --> 00:26:34,290
patterns.
So let me just clarify one point I,

424
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:35,124
I certainly am not saying that you can't
see the thumbprint of evolution in more 

425
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:44,010
or less everything we do,
you obviously can and as you point out,

426
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,920
are sexual morality and our commitment 
to monogamy,

427
00:26:46,921 --> 00:26:50,350
all of that is amenable to being 
interpreted in evolutionary terms.

428
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,670
No doubt those stories are valid and 
interesting to understand.

429
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:59,090
My point is is that we are in the 
process of repudiating and struggling to

430
00:26:59,781 --> 00:27:00,614
outgrow most of what evolution has 
prepared us to want and care about and 

431
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:08,510
fear tribalism,
xenophobia,

432
00:27:08,511 --> 00:27:09,800
and the list is long.
But we want,

433
00:27:09,801 --> 00:27:13,840
we want to get out of our tribal 
violence program and all the rest.

434
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,113
Dress that because you see most of the 
evolutionary psychologists that I've 

435
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:20,004
encountered have what I consider the 
misbegotten notion that our primary 

436
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,550
period of evolutionary determination was
on me,

437
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:33,830
African Veldt and my viewpoint I would 
say spans broader time spans than that.

438
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,173
So I'm starting from the presupposition 
that the most permanent things are the 

439
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:45,160
most real which,
which I think is a reasonable,

440
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,213
a reasonable starting point.
I have a reason for saying that because 

441
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:49,834
what I've enabled to understand by 
delving deeply into the grammatical 

442
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:58,180
structure underneath mythology is that 
the,

443
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,133
the religious landscape actually 
describes that which is most permanent 

444
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:06,430
[inaudible] what shape human 
evolutionary history.

445
00:28:06,431 --> 00:28:07,264
And I mean way back,
I mean 350 million years back before 

446
00:28:10,391 --> 00:28:11,950
trees,
before flowers,

447
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,213
back when we shared,
when we shared a common ancestor with 

448
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:17,664
crustaceans.
And so one of the most permanent 

449
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,293
features of the biological landscape is 
the existence of the dominance 

450
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:25,740
hierarchy.

451
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,573
And that's roughly portrayed in 
religious mythology as culture or 

452
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,020
explored territory or the known.
And it's,

453
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,203
it's usually given me the character,
a logical representation of the great 

454
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:39,384
father.
And there's a positive one and a 

455
00:28:40,531 --> 00:28:41,364
negative one as the dominance hierarchy 
can support you in your development or 

456
00:28:45,031 --> 00:28:45,864
crushed you completely.
So the dominance hierarchy is one major 

457
00:28:48,651 --> 00:28:52,090
selection mechanism and it's known 
territory there.

458
00:28:52,091 --> 00:28:54,200
There's another major selection 
mechanism,

459
00:28:54,201 --> 00:28:55,034
which is roughly speaking mother nature,
and that's that which exists outside of 

460
00:28:59,691 --> 00:29:00,524
explored territory.
And it's generally being kept 

461
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,193
conceptualized as feminine,
which I think the reason for that is 

462
00:29:07,251 --> 00:29:09,890
because the unknown,
it's the unknown,

463
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,400
cognitively speaking or territorial 
speaking,

464
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,453
that gives rise to new forms,
but it's also more importantly that 

465
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,673
female human beings.
So the feminine plays a very vicious 

466
00:29:22,831 --> 00:29:25,210
role in the selection process.
Um,

467
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,123
you may know and probably do that you 
have twice as many female ancestors as 

468
00:29:30,611 --> 00:29:31,640
male ancestors.

469
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,473
So as far as human beings are concerned,
the feminine is a bottleneck through 

470
00:29:36,961 --> 00:29:39,590
which genes must pass,
so to speak.

471
00:29:39,591 --> 00:29:42,670
And it's a very narrow and,
and choosy marble next.

472
00:29:42,671 --> 00:29:45,720
So it has a positive element and a 
negative element.

473
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,063
So roughly it's the same thing Sam 
that's represented in the Dow is dnd 

474
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:51,603
Yang Symbol.
Because that Yin Yang symbol basically 

475
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:55,823
is predicated on the idea that being is 
partly the known or the interpretive 

476
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:03,100
structure that's brought to bear on the 
situation.

477
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:06,040
And so that's the White Paisley.
It's a serpent to actually,

478
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:09,550
and the unknown,
which is the Black Paisley or a serpent,

479
00:30:09,551 --> 00:30:13,360
and the two are interchangeable and out 
of them arises meaning.

480
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,633
So the idea behind the Taoist symbol is 
that you should have one foot in what 

481
00:30:17,581 --> 00:30:21,170
you know and one foot in you in what you
don't know.

482
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,580
And that's the place where information 
flow is maximized.

483
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,733
And that's the same thing as occupying 
the position of the hero who confronts 

484
00:30:28,921 --> 00:30:31,050
the unknown and generates new 
information.

485
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:32,523
And those,
those evolutionary realities remain 

486
00:30:35,491 --> 00:30:40,120
absolutely unchanged.
The idea that every place you go,

487
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,700
there's something you know and an 
interpretive framework that you bring to

488
00:30:43,701 --> 00:30:44,534
bear.
So there's a cultural element and 

489
00:30:45,591 --> 00:30:46,424
everywhere you go or are,
there's something that transcends that 

490
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,930
knowledge,
but you have to deal with.

491
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,940
And everywhere you go,
you're there.

492
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:55,863
And so that's the,
so the three basic archetypical 

493
00:30:58,571 --> 00:30:59,404
characters of mythology or the 
individual positive and negative 

494
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:05,960
culture,
positive and negative and nature,

495
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,333
positive and negative.
We haven't outgrown that in the least w 

496
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,500
it's exactly the same problem it's 
always been.

497
00:31:12,501 --> 00:31:13,334
And as far as I can tell,
it's exactly the same set of problems 

498
00:31:15,931 --> 00:31:16,764
that always will be.
And that's partly why these archetypal 

499
00:31:18,901 --> 00:31:19,734
stories can't be,
cannot be transcended and they cannot 

500
00:31:24,471 --> 00:31:25,990
be,
um,

501
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:26,651
ignore,
ignored.

502
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:29,560
They pop up off of their own accord.
Look,

503
00:31:29,561 --> 00:31:31,270
I'll give you an example.
One question.

504
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,460
Pardon?
How

505
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:36,560
is any of that religious though I 
understand how,

506
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,793
you know,
thinking of the individual versus the 

507
00:31:40,641 --> 00:31:45,200
cosmos gives us a kind of narrative 
structure,

508
00:31:45,201 --> 00:31:46,034
right?
You have your protagonist and you have 

509
00:31:47,451 --> 00:31:52,400
all of the things that can happen to him
or not and all of the things that he can

510
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,263
want or not.
And it's very easy to conceive of any 

511
00:31:57,351 --> 00:31:58,184
human life or the life of a whole 
civilization in terms of stories like 

512
00:32:01,931 --> 00:32:02,764
that.
But how does this bring religion into 

513
00:32:04,541 --> 00:32:05,374
the picture?

514
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,670
Okay,
well I'm okay.

515
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,003
Approach that from two perspectives.
The first perspective I presume is one 

516
00:32:12,141 --> 00:32:17,141
that you might find interesting given 
your your interest in spirituality.

517
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,720
So it's certainly capable for people to 
experience deeply a sense of meaning.

518
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,950
Don't chick sent a highly talked about 
that as flow,

519
00:32:27,951 --> 00:32:30,380
which I think is a rather trivial way of
dealing with it,

520
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:32,990
but at least it's one that people can 
directly understand.

521
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,453
But I would say you can understand when 
you're doing something meaningful 

522
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:38,563
because you're deeply engaged it and you
also have a sense in some sense of 

523
00:32:41,861 --> 00:32:44,320
standing outside of time cause you don't
know.

524
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,253
There's times flow and it also feels 
worthwhile and that the sacrifices that 

525
00:32:50,061 --> 00:32:53,000
you have made to enable yourself to do 
that,

526
00:32:53,001 --> 00:32:53,834
we're justified.
And so I would say because the ultimate 

527
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:02,410
domains of reality are in fact chaos and
order or known and unknown,

528
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:07,510
that when you straddle those two 
properly and maximize information flow,

529
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:10,930
you feel a deep sense of intrinsic 
meaning.

530
00:33:10,931 --> 00:33:11,764
And that's the output of the entire 
structure of your consciousness telling 

531
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:16,694
you that you're in the right place at 
the right time with regards to 

532
00:33:19,861 --> 00:33:24,030
furthering your capacity to thrive and,
and move forward.

533
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,153
The question you're a Jordan,
wouldn't you grant that there are 

534
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,003
pathological experiences of meaning,
meaning that is actually based on a 

535
00:33:34,591 --> 00:33:37,590
misconception or or divorced from the 
truth,

536
00:33:37,591 --> 00:33:38,424
which can be no less intoxicating to the
person who's finding something 

537
00:33:41,521 --> 00:33:42,270
meaningful.

538
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,380
Sam,
I think that's a great question.

539
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:45,663
One of the things that really,
really disturbed me when I was first 

540
00:33:48,101 --> 00:33:52,620
working out these ideas was exactly that
question because like I've read an awful

541
00:33:52,621 --> 00:33:55,230
lot about extraordinarily pathological 
people,

542
00:33:55,231 --> 00:33:56,064
you know,
serial killers and people who were 

543
00:33:57,361 --> 00:34:02,220
malevolent right to their core.
And that's exactly the question I asked.

544
00:34:02,221 --> 00:34:04,440
Because you know with serial killers for
example,

545
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:09,370
especially the sexual Predator types,
they seem to have to live on the edge of

546
00:34:09,371 --> 00:34:12,460
their pathology in order to continue to 
be rewarded by it.

547
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:13,923
You know,
they have to keep extending their 

548
00:34:15,881 --> 00:34:19,060
pathology into the unknown to keep 
getting that rush.

549
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,463
And then of course there's the situation
with schizophrenia where the underlying 

550
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:27,730
mechanisms that produce the sense of 
meaning actually go astray.

551
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:30,700
That's especially the case say with 
paranoid schizophrenia.

552
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:31,953
But you see that's,
that's partly why I think I developed a 

553
00:34:35,721 --> 00:34:36,554
viewpoint that's similar to yours with 
regards to the necessity of stating the 

554
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:46,371
truth or at least attempting very hard 
not to say what you believe to be false.

555
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:52,330
Because as far as I can tell,
at least under most circumstances,

556
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,360
okay.
That meaning orienting system,

557
00:34:55,361 --> 00:34:58,330
which is actually the extended orienting
reflex,

558
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:01,720
technically speaking,
neuropsychologically speaking,

559
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,183
I think that you pathologize the 
underlying mechanisms if you speak 

560
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,680
deceitfully because you build,
you build pathological micro machines,

561
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:15,960
so to speak,
into the architecture of your physiology

562
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:20,540
and then your underlying the underlying 
systems,

563
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:24,850
much more fundamental say limbic systems
for the sake of,

564
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:28,810
for lack of a better term,
they start producing pathological output

565
00:35:28,811 --> 00:35:31,360
and take you down extraordinarily 
dangerous roads.

566
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:36,510
So if you're going to let your intrinsic
sense of meaning serve as a guide life,

567
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,003
then you have to ally yourself with the 
commitment to speak the truth or at 

568
00:35:44,181 --> 00:35:45,014
least not to engage in deceit because 
otherwise you will do exactly what you 

569
00:35:48,731 --> 00:35:52,490
said and pathologize yourself and then 
well,

570
00:35:52,491 --> 00:35:54,650
and then all hell will break loose in 
your life.

571
00:35:54,651 --> 00:35:55,790
And in the life of others,

572
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,970
rigorously honest,
but still mistaken,

573
00:35:59,971 --> 00:36:00,391
right?
I mean,

574
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:01,224
you could have a belief system or b 
raised in a culture that has a belief 

575
00:36:05,181 --> 00:36:10,181
system that is completely illogical or 
out of touch with reality.

576
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,213
You could not know it.
The dishonesty doesn't have to be local 

577
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:18,640
to your own brain.
You could just be confused.

578
00:36:18,641 --> 00:36:19,474
Right.

579
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,513
Well,
I think this is partly why I was more 

580
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:23,214
insistent than I should have been in our
last discussion about a particular idea 

581
00:36:26,821 --> 00:36:28,020
about truth.
I mean,

582
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,153
because I would say there's the truth 
that's associated with being in 

583
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:34,434
possession of a set of accurate facts,
but there's a more enacted truth or 

584
00:36:39,561 --> 00:36:40,394
embodied truth,
which is the consistent attempt to go 

585
00:36:42,921 --> 00:36:46,270
beyond what you know.
And so that would be the,

586
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:50,070
the necessity of living in humility or 
in ignorance.

587
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,393
And so that what you're doing when 
you're discussing with someone or when 

588
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:55,734
you're acting in the world is not so 
much attempting to prove that what you 

589
00:36:59,071 --> 00:37:02,500
already know is completely right and 
correct,

590
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:03,843
but attempting to understand very 
carefully where you're in error and 

591
00:37:07,831 --> 00:37:10,110
learning everything you can to correct 
that.

592
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:15,810
And you see that ideas also deeply 
rooted in in religious mythology.

593
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:20,120
So for example,
the the finger of Horus,

594
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:24,400
who's the Egyptian Aye and who's also a 
fall camp.

595
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:25,603
Horace is an I and a fall can because 
falcons can see better than any other 

596
00:37:28,761 --> 00:37:30,320
animal,
including human beings,

597
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,243
even though we can see very well and 
he's an eye because the eye with the 

598
00:37:34,891 --> 00:37:35,724
open irs signifies paying attention.
And Horace who's a messianic figure in 

599
00:37:41,281 --> 00:37:42,114
some sense for the ancient Egyptians,
had his eyes open to the corruption of 

600
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,190
the state,
which was symbolized by a day.

601
00:37:49,191 --> 00:37:53,030
And he named Seth set,
who later became Satan in,

602
00:37:53,031 --> 00:37:55,360
in,
in the developmental pathway of this set

603
00:37:55,361 --> 00:37:56,194
of ideas.
And Horace who lived in truth so to 

604
00:37:59,151 --> 00:37:59,984
speak,
was able to keep his eyes open and 

605
00:38:01,941 --> 00:38:06,170
understand the corrupt nature of his 
society and his uncle,

606
00:38:06,171 --> 00:38:09,170
his uncle was seth.
And to put that right again,

607
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,413
and so there's the,
there's the idea that lived truth can 

608
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:18,741
rescue you from pathological untruth and
that might be more or factual.

609
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:23,180
If you're a scientist operating in a 
truthful manner,

610
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,410
you update Archaic,
Archaic,

611
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:29,920
empirical representations.
If you're a,

612
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,530
what would you call it?
More culture hero type of person,

613
00:38:32,531 --> 00:38:36,130
then what you're doing is updating 
archaic and blind

614
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:39,400
representations of the proper moral 
pathway forward,

615
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,880
which can never be encapsulated 
completely in a set of rules.

616
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,870
So that's partly why.
That's partly why,

617
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:48,400
for example,
in in,

618
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,303
in the line of Christian thought,
Moses couldn't reach the promised land 

619
00:38:52,241 --> 00:38:55,390
because his morality was bounded by 
rules.

620
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:56,523
And it's not possible to reach the 
proper motive being by only acting out 

621
00:39:01,061 --> 00:39:05,680
rules because rules the same rules 
aren't applicable in every situation.

622
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,493
I mean,
I could tell you the Christian story in 

623
00:39:10,031 --> 00:39:13,180
a way that you might find interesting 
and about 10 minutes if,

624
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,223
if you,
if you would like me to do that and 

625
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,773
let's hold off on Christianity.
I want to get there because I know 

626
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,323
that's the,
the system of thinking you find most 

627
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:24,730
interesting in this area.
And so I would like to talk about that.

628
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:25,683
Okay.
My issue is that it seems to me that 

629
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:31,940
this kind of language game of,
you know,

630
00:39:31,941 --> 00:39:32,774
talking about ancient stories and the 
way in which they seem to cash out some 

631
00:39:38,051 --> 00:39:38,884
of the pre-scientific intuitions and 
moral norms of any group of people as 

632
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:48,460
though there's a validity to the whole 
picture when you talk that way that I,

633
00:39:48,461 --> 00:39:52,870
I just see that that's kind of 
unconstrained by anything.

634
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:56,260
I think you can do that with anything,
with any system of beliefs.

635
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:57,094
You can find the people,
which from my point of view are living 

636
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:00,814
in some form of radical error,
which is to say that virtually 

637
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,190
everything they think is true almost 
certainly isn't.

638
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:07,623
And the way they're treating one another
is terrible on the basis of those 

639
00:40:11,531 --> 00:40:14,770
misconceptions and they're never going 
to get anywhere worth going.

640
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,380
Right?
So a modern example of that is something

641
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:21,820
like isis or the Taliban,
but there's some ancient examples or you

642
00:40:21,821 --> 00:40:22,654
know,
older examples that are in some cases 

643
00:40:24,551 --> 00:40:28,210
even easier to understand because we 
have no affinity for them.

644
00:40:28,211 --> 00:40:30,520
So do you know the,
the Dobo people,

645
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,220
the anthropologist Ruth Benedict wrote 
about them?

646
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:35,950
I,
I wrote about them for a few pages in my

647
00:40:35,951 --> 00:40:37,000
book.
The moral landscape.

648
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,893
Yeah.
I write about them in your book 

649
00:40:38,651 --> 00:40:39,790
actually.
Yeah.

650
00:40:39,791 --> 00:40:42,700
So for listeners who didn't read the 
book or can't remember,

651
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:43,823
I mean the dove to get my vote for 
perhaps the most tragically confused 

652
00:40:48,161 --> 00:40:48,994
people who have ever lived,
and this is just kind of a hot house 

653
00:40:51,281 --> 00:40:52,114
version of radical confusion,
which you wouldn't believe it would be 

654
00:40:54,941 --> 00:40:55,774
possible,
but for the fact that some 

655
00:40:57,101 --> 00:40:58,450
anthropologists wrote about it.

656
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,793
But so this was a culture that was 
completely obsessed with malicious 

657
00:41:04,151 --> 00:41:04,984
sorcery and their primary interest,
every person's primary interest was to 

658
00:41:07,781 --> 00:41:08,614
cast spells on other members of the 
tribe in an attempt to sicken or kill 

659
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:14,584
them in the hopes of magically stealing 
their possessions and especially their 

660
00:41:18,341 --> 00:41:20,800
crops.
It was like a continuous,

661
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:24,190
magical war of all against all in this 
way.

662
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,053
And,
and they believed that magic had to be 

663
00:41:27,371 --> 00:41:28,204
consciously applied to everything.
They literally thought that gravity had 

664
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:34,340
to be supplemented by magic so that if 
you didn't cast the right spells,

665
00:41:34,341 --> 00:41:37,280
your vegetables would just rise out of 
the ground and disappear.

666
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,633
And they thought every interaction of 
this sort and every outcome for people 

667
00:41:43,881 --> 00:41:44,714
with zero sum so that if one man 
succeeded in growing more vegetables 

668
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:49,690
than his neighbor,
his success,

669
00:41:49,691 --> 00:41:54,691
his surplus of vegetables must have been
stolen from one of his neighbors through

670
00:41:55,121 --> 00:41:55,954
sorcery.

671
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:58,300
Even the farmer who got lucky in this 
way,

672
00:41:58,301 --> 00:42:02,330
w with a surplus would have believed 
that he succeeded for this reason,

673
00:42:02,331 --> 00:42:04,580
that he actually magically stole his 
neighbor's crop.

674
00:42:04,581 --> 00:42:08,720
So to have a good harvest was a crime by
everyone's estimation.

675
00:42:08,721 --> 00:42:11,100
Even the person who it was a lucky 
harvester.

676
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,520
And it seems to me that you could play 
this same game with the dope boo.

677
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,313
I mean you could talk about archetypes,
you could talk about whatever stories 

678
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:24,600
ancient or otherwise that they were 
using to justify this,

679
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:25,643
this view of life.
You could find some evolutionary way of 

680
00:42:29,031 --> 00:42:29,864
kind of threading the needle of how what
they were doing was a response to the 

681
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:35,150
the ancient imperative of dominance 
hierarchies.

682
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,333
You know,
you could give some sympathetic 

683
00:42:37,241 --> 00:42:42,241
construal of the whole enterprise in 
terms of myth and archetype and meaning.

684
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:44,873
But clearly this was like a kind of 
strange basin of attraction that you'd 

685
00:42:49,361 --> 00:42:53,800
be very lucky never to have found as a 
tribe or as a culture.

686
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,690
And we're very lucky not to be stuck in 
some similar place there.

687
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:01,540
There's another detail here,
which is especially horrible because the

688
00:43:01,541 --> 00:43:06,541
dove who felt that magic became more 
powerful the closer you were to somebody

689
00:43:06,911 --> 00:43:09,900
so that the people who are closest to 
them in life,

690
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:11,143
their spouses or their children,
or the people who are most likely to 

691
00:43:14,031 --> 00:43:16,480
destroy them,
would there be magical powers?

692
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:17,730
Well,
that's actually true,

693
00:43:17,731 --> 00:43:18,564
Sam.
Yes.

694
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:20,721
But yeah,
so again,

695
00:43:20,721 --> 00:43:21,131
you,
you could,

696
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:24,030
you could connect it to some kind of 
story that makes sense.

697
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:26,730
So you could go to Greek mythology and,
and Shakespeare and,

698
00:43:26,731 --> 00:43:27,564
and spin a yarn about it.
But clearly this underlying belief in 

699
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:35,810
magic was one,
it's almost certainly not true,

700
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,673
but to,
it was creating a truly toxic moral 

701
00:43:39,981 --> 00:43:42,240
environment for these people.
And so yeah,

702
00:43:42,241 --> 00:43:43,074
I just put that out there as an example 
of something that one would never want 

703
00:43:45,941 --> 00:43:46,774
to spend a lot of time trying to justify
this worldview by reference to stories 

704
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:54,440
ancient or otherwise.

705
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:55,560
Yeah,
well,

706
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,393
I mean there's actually a technical 
solution to the problem that you're 

707
00:43:58,821 --> 00:44:00,420
posing.
I mean,

708
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,433
part of the,
the problem is how do you know if what 

709
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:09,110
you're looking at is a genuine thing or 
an artifact of your imagination.

710
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:12,910
And you know that Paul Meehl and,
and his,

711
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:14,173
his,
uh,

712
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,173
has colleague crunk back basically 
addressed that back in the 1950s with a 

713
00:44:19,211 --> 00:44:20,044
very solid piece of methodological work 
that every psychologist either does or 

714
00:44:25,271 --> 00:44:26,104
should know about.
They were the inventors of the multi 

715
00:44:27,741 --> 00:44:31,350
multitrack multi-method construct 
validation process,

716
00:44:31,351 --> 00:44:32,160
which is a

717
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,160
pretty awful jumble of words.
But basically it means something like in

718
00:44:37,711 --> 00:44:40,350
order to specify whether or not 
something exists.

719
00:44:40,351 --> 00:44:45,351
You have use multiple methods to detect 
it and that their reports should co-vary

720
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:48,540
positively.
And so of course,

721
00:44:48,541 --> 00:44:52,110
we do exactly that with our five senses.
You know,

722
00:44:52,111 --> 00:44:55,020
just because you can see something 
doesn't mean it's there.

723
00:44:55,021 --> 00:44:59,310
But if you can see it and hear it well,
you're a little bit more certain.

724
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:05,030
When I wrote my book maps of meaning,
I was very acutely aware of that.

725
00:45:05,971 --> 00:45:06,804
And it's certainly a criticism that has 
been leveled against people like Carl 

726
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,940
Young,
mostly,

727
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:12,963
uh,
tragically enough by the postmodernists 

728
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:15,743
of course,
who don't believe in any sort of 

729
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:21,180
overarching narrative and who have their
own form of Dogan like pathology,

730
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:24,450
uh,
distributed well widely among them.

731
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:25,643
So what I did was refused to take a 
presupposition as acceptable unless I 

732
00:45:32,161 --> 00:45:37,020
could find its manifestation at at least
four levels of evidence simultaneously.

733
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:39,240
So for example,
in,

734
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,133
in my book,
I start out with a neuropsychological 

735
00:45:42,631 --> 00:45:47,631
account on account of the fundamental 
neuropsychological processes that enable

736
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:52,260
us to make sense out of the world,
primarily relying on the work done early

737
00:45:52,261 --> 00:45:54,690
work done by the Russian 
neuropsychologists,

738
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:58,170
Luria and soak aloft.
And Vinod Cordova who did a lot of early

739
00:45:58,171 --> 00:46:00,600
work on the orienting reflects in the 
hippocampus.

740
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:01,853
That was then sort of combined with 
modern cybernetic theory by Jeffrey 

741
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:07,260
Gray,
who was hands Isaac student.

742
00:46:07,261 --> 00:46:12,000
And Jeffrey Gray's work has had 
tremendous impact over the last,

743
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:15,420
especially over the last 10 years in in 
psychology in general.

744
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,940
He wrote his book in 1982 but it was a 
very,

745
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,920
very difficult book.
I think it had,

746
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,670
it must have had between 1500 and 3000 
references.

747
00:46:23,671 --> 00:46:24,504
And Jeffrey Gray was exactly the sort of
person who would have read every single 

748
00:46:27,691 --> 00:46:28,524
one of them.
And he outlined on cybernetic 

749
00:46:31,171 --> 00:46:32,004
information processing model of human 
neuropsychological function that 

750
00:46:35,311 --> 00:46:40,311
actually lays extraordinarily nicely on 
top of the architectural world that I,

751
00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:42,570
that I've been working on outlining.

752
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:43,403
And I also wanted to ensure that it was 
in keeping with the kind of 

753
00:46:46,801 --> 00:46:51,690
observational animal studies that people
like Jane Goodall and Frans de Waal do.

754
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:53,243
Ethology,
I wanted to make sure that it was in 

755
00:46:54,601 --> 00:46:55,434
keeping with the ecological data as well
as the broader literature on 

756
00:47:00,301 --> 00:47:01,134
evolutionary psychology and biology.
And so when I say that there's these 

757
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:08,760
patterns that exist that you can extract
out of out of mythology,

758
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:09,983
I'm saying that knowing full well that 
you can find concordance for the 

759
00:47:14,011 --> 00:47:14,844
processes described by those archetypal 
stories in at least four different 

760
00:47:18,451 --> 00:47:20,010
scientific disciplines,
simile,

761
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:24,870
tanium and according to chronback and 
meals methodology.

762
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:29,140
That's the most effective possible way 
of validating a construct when,

763
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,333
when it might be susceptible that to the
kind of contamination by imagination 

764
00:47:34,791 --> 00:47:35,990
that you're referring to.

765
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,090
I don't know what to make of that claim 
generically,

766
00:47:39,091 --> 00:47:39,924
I think.
I think we should talk about your view 

767
00:47:41,831 --> 00:47:45,990
of Christianity at some point soon to 
see if we can talk about specifics,

768
00:47:45,991 --> 00:47:49,070
but I just want to take a generic 
starting point,

769
00:47:49,071 --> 00:47:51,770
which for me is more accessible and I 
think more illuminating.

770
00:47:51,771 --> 00:47:52,604
It certainly describes the divide 
between science and religion that 

771
00:47:57,170 --> 00:47:58,003
resonates with me and I think it 
connects nicely to the way you were 

772
00:48:00,551 --> 00:48:04,820
describing kind of our primal 
circumstance of being an individual or a

773
00:48:04,821 --> 00:48:05,654
tribe standing in the face of mute and 
often hostile nature and trying to 

774
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:14,210
figure out what's going on and how to 
live within it.

775
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,720
I think that really is the primal 
circumstance.

776
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:19,560
This is why I think of religion as you 
know,

777
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:20,573
as a kind of failed science as a kind of
first attempt to tell a story about 

778
00:48:24,221 --> 00:48:24,940
what's going on.

779
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:29,940
That gives us some power over it.
But it's a bad attempt because we didn't

780
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:31,003
develop any kind of methodology at that 
point to differentiate fact from 

781
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:36,360
fiction.
Take the case.

782
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:41,630
Every parent will be familiar with 
standing helplessly over your sick child

783
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,670
wondering what's wrong.
Let's say your child throws up and has a

784
00:48:45,671 --> 00:48:48,820
fever and you don't know what's wrong 
with him or her.

785
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:53,560
And this is obviously one of the more,
the more ancient moments for any person.

786
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:54,641
And there's a,
you know,

787
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:58,450
obvious evolutionary reasons why we 
would be concerned about this.

788
00:48:58,451 --> 00:49:01,950
And so this is quite Darwinian to care 
what's happening to your,

789
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:06,740
your infant.
But today this primitive uncertainty and

790
00:49:06,741 --> 00:49:07,574
helplessness and fear is bracketed by a 
basic understanding of the processes in 

791
00:49:12,591 --> 00:49:13,424
the world that can affect a human body.
And there's obviously enough to worry 

792
00:49:16,741 --> 00:49:19,320
about there to drive almost any parent 
crazy.

793
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:24,370
But one thing that is no longer on the 
menu is the evil eye.

794
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:28,100
When your child gets sick,
no part of your mind,

795
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:32,730
if you're saying is now devoted to the 
question of whether or not you should go

796
00:49:32,731 --> 00:49:33,564
burn your neighbor as a witch because 
she might've tasked a malicious glance 

797
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:39,000
at your child.
Right?

798
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:42,150
But as you know,
that was not always so,

799
00:49:42,151 --> 00:49:43,530
and in fact,
in Africa,

800
00:49:43,531 --> 00:49:46,500
people are still murdering their 
neighbors for the crime of witchcraft.

801
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:50,500
So the problem from my point of view is 
twofold.

802
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:51,443
One is that we know that there's a path 
forward to rule out things like 

803
00:49:56,081 --> 00:49:56,914
witchcraft and the evil eye,
and that this path is science and 

804
00:49:59,231 --> 00:50:00,430
rationality.
Generally.

805
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:02,883
The other problem is that you could 
still play this game by resort to 

806
00:50:07,201 --> 00:50:08,034
ancient stories and finding some 
connection between those stories and 

807
00:50:11,251 --> 00:50:12,084
evolution.
You could play a game of dignifying a 

808
00:50:14,831 --> 00:50:16,270
belief in magic.

809
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:17,111
In this case,
you know,

810
00:50:17,111 --> 00:50:22,111
the evil eye specifically along union 
lines or archetype aligns or something.

811
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,800
You could be sympathetic with this 
picture.

812
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:27,043
But my point,
what would be the point of that mean 

813
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:30,103
given the obvious harms that we no 
longer need commit based on disavowing 

814
00:50:34,321 --> 00:50:35,154
this ancient ignorance,
why would one spend any time at all 

815
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:43,780
trying to make sense of admittedly 
ancient concern about sympathetic magic,

816
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,490
right?
Sympathetic magic is dangerous bullshit.

817
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:52,460
That's basically all I think we need to 
know about it now.

818
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:57,320
And yet you could spend a lifetime,
you could be reading not only young,

819
00:50:57,321 --> 00:50:58,154
but you know,
sketchy or people like Alistair Crowley 

820
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,080
and lfs Levy and all that.
You know,

821
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,710
the history of hermeticism and you could
open it and you know,

822
00:51:05,711 --> 00:51:08,860
manly palmer halls,
the secret teachings of all ages and,

823
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:12,950
and just get deep into that stuff.
The tradition of Western magic,

824
00:51:12,951 --> 00:51:13,784
right?
It seems to me to be almost by 

825
00:51:15,261 --> 00:51:18,660
definition,
a colossal waste of time and actually,

826
00:51:18,661 --> 00:51:21,590
yeah,
unnecessary to preserve anything that we

827
00:51:21,591 --> 00:51:23,390
care about at this moment in history.

828
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:24,151
Okay.
Well,

829
00:51:24,151 --> 00:51:27,570
I don't think that we have to have an 
argument about the,

830
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:29,610
the,
the,

831
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:33,990
the utility of moving forward on the 
scientific front.

832
00:51:33,991 --> 00:51:37,240
I mean I consider myself a scientist and
I don't,

833
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:41,510
I don't feel that it's necessary to 
justify to the audience that's likely to

834
00:51:41,511 --> 00:51:44,780
be listening to this,
the utility of the scientific approach.

835
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:48,810
I would say that that the,
there are,

836
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:49,673
there's great purpose in looking at 
these ancient stories in the same way 

837
00:51:52,831 --> 00:51:56,820
Sam as there's great purpose and utility
in reading fiction.

838
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:58,321
So,
and I,

839
00:51:58,321 --> 00:52:00,780
and I don't mean that in a derogatory 
manner.

840
00:52:01,770 --> 00:52:05,760
One of the things that I thought about 
after our last discussion because I went

841
00:52:05,761 --> 00:52:09,060
and did some investigation into 
definitions of truth,

842
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:12,240
um,
some serious investigation so that I was

843
00:52:12,241 --> 00:52:14,040
more prepared the next time that we 
talked.

844
00:52:14,041 --> 00:52:16,260
But one of the questions that I wanted 
to ask you,

845
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:19,970
for example,
given your emphasis on the,

846
00:52:19,971 --> 00:52:20,804
on truth as embedded in fact and also 
the ability of moral truth to reveal 

847
00:52:24,771 --> 00:52:25,604
itself from a set of facts is here's the
sentence for you and perhaps you can 

848
00:52:29,411 --> 00:52:30,244
tell me what you make of it.
There is great truth revealed in 

849
00:52:34,101 --> 00:52:36,710
Dostoevsky,
tolstoy and Shakespeare.

850
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:41,790
Do you agree with that or disagree 
because there's no fact in any of that.

851
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:45,500
And there are certainly no scientific 
data now.

852
00:52:45,501 --> 00:52:48,410
Do you think that that,
that those great works of Literature,

853
00:52:48,411 --> 00:52:51,650
which are I would say more or less 
universally regarded as valuable,

854
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,510
do they?
How would you,

855
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:56,630
this is where we,
why we got stuck on the issue of truth.

856
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:59,380
You see?
I would say that those stories,

857
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:01,860
there's more truth than Dostoyevsky's 
fiction.

858
00:53:01,861 --> 00:53:04,080
Then there is in a single person's life.

859
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:06,550
I don't know if I'd go quite that far,
but yes,

860
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:11,680
I will totally agree with you that 
there's a lot of truth in fiction.

861
00:53:11,681 --> 00:53:12,514
I don't think that's at all why we got 
bogged down in our previous discussion 

862
00:53:15,641 --> 00:53:16,474
about truth.

863
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,100
How would you characterize that truth 
though?

864
00:53:19,101 --> 00:53:23,150
Because it's certainly not factual by by
any stretch of the imagination.

865
00:53:23,151 --> 00:53:24,910
It's,
it's some sort of,

866
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:26,533
let me stretch our imaginations there.
I think there's a wide variety of facts 

867
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:35,850
that are at the very least illustrated 
in fiction.

868
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,713
The reason why fiction is compelling to 
us is that it does map on credibly to 

869
00:53:41,621 --> 00:53:42,454
our experience of the world or what we 
can imagined to be valid human 

870
00:53:46,701 --> 00:53:47,534
experiences.

871
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:48,453
Yup.

872
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:49,493
If it were radically strange,
which is to say if it all seemed 

873
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:57,130
preposterous.
That's the definition of an unsuccessful

874
00:53:57,131 --> 00:53:57,964
work of fiction in so far as certain 
kinds of fiction push those boundaries 

875
00:54:01,911 --> 00:54:05,640
and certain kinds of magical realism or 
science fiction,

876
00:54:05,641 --> 00:54:06,474
which begins to seem basically like 
tennis without the net where there's 

877
00:54:09,231 --> 00:54:10,064
just no,
there are no rules that make it 

878
00:54:11,821 --> 00:54:13,380
interesting.
The sweet spot,

879
00:54:13,381 --> 00:54:18,381
at least in in my mind for fiction is 
something that has enough verisimilitude

880
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:24,990
to be credible and yet it's a heightened
reality,

881
00:54:24,991 --> 00:54:25,824
which makes it much more interesting.
Then just finding out what happened to 

882
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:31,400
an ordinary person on an ordinary day.

883
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:32,271
Right.
Okay,

884
00:54:32,271 --> 00:54:33,200
so with that,
let's,

885
00:54:33,201 --> 00:54:36,200
let's take that idea of heightened 
reality because I could make,

886
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:37,913
imagine that this is the case.
Imagine that I took Dostoevsky and 

887
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:43,343
tolstoy and Shakespeare for,
they'll do for the time being and I 

888
00:54:46,771 --> 00:54:47,604
distilled out what made them great 
fiction and I extracted a work of Metta 

889
00:54:52,051 --> 00:54:56,420
fiction from them.
That would be archetipal he religious.

890
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,570
The thing about religion for me,
again,

891
00:54:59,571 --> 00:55:01,950
I know there are people who would 
dispute this.

892
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:04,170
I just don't find this.
These claims,

893
00:55:04,171 --> 00:55:07,440
credible religion becomes religion for 
me.

894
00:55:07,441 --> 00:55:10,100
When you begin to assert

895
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:14,800
that certain things are true,
specifically other worldly things,

896
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:20,340
the survival of the conscious mind after
death or the real existence of invisible

897
00:55:22,851 --> 00:55:23,684
agents,
which you can propitiate or fail to 

898
00:55:26,101 --> 00:55:27,350
propitiate.
Yeah,

899
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,740
who have their eye on you,
right?

900
00:55:29,741 --> 00:55:33,470
They care how you live.
They care whether you masturbate a care,

901
00:55:33,471 --> 00:55:34,304
whether you pray to them and in what 
terms you do and if you get any of that 

902
00:55:37,391 --> 00:55:39,680
stuff wrong,
you will suffer for it.

903
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:40,633
You are in relationship to these things.
There are some people who who have 

904
00:55:44,031 --> 00:55:49,031
relaxed their standards of commitment.
Two revealed religions so much that they

905
00:55:49,941 --> 00:55:50,774
don't really answer to that description,
but most religious people most of the 

906
00:55:53,721 --> 00:55:56,180
time,
certainly most Christians and Muslims,

907
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:01,080
I believe otherworldly and supernatural 
and superstitious things,

908
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,400
which are I would argue indirect 
contradiction,

909
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:06,250
too.
Reasonable things.

910
00:56:06,251 --> 00:56:08,440
They might believe about how the cosmos 
works.

911
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:09,811
Okay.
Okay,

912
00:56:09,811 --> 00:56:13,570
so I'm going to take a specific example 
from what you said and address it.

913
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:17,060
You were talking about the propitiation 
of supernatural beings.

914
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,820
I'm going to,
if you don't mind,

915
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:22,283
tell you the story of,
and Abel in a way that you probably 

916
00:56:25,361 --> 00:56:27,910
haven't heard it.
It's only a paragraph long.

917
00:56:27,911 --> 00:56:31,660
This story,
and I want to set it up first.

918
00:56:31,661 --> 00:56:32,494
So Kate,
enable our types from a classical 

919
00:56:35,681 --> 00:56:40,120
religious interpretation standpoint and 
there that you might think about them as

920
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:44,050
foreshadowing the emergence of the idea 
of Christ and Satan.

921
00:56:44,051 --> 00:56:47,400
So they're the,
they're the idea of the hostile brothers

922
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:51,010
and that idea pops up in fiction all the
time.

923
00:56:51,011 --> 00:56:51,521
It's,
it's a,

924
00:56:51,521 --> 00:56:53,200
it's a constant,
it's an archetype.

925
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:55,600
It's man against his soul,
say,

926
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:58,220
or man against his darker nature.
Um,

927
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,373
that that's the basic plot idea.
So now Cain and Abel in Genesis are 

928
00:57:04,031 --> 00:57:04,864
actually the first to actual human 
beings because God or Adam and eve are 

929
00:57:09,761 --> 00:57:10,600
made by God.

930
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:14,020
So somehow they're not exactly human 
play along with me for a minute,

931
00:57:14,021 --> 00:57:17,860
I know this isn't literally true sound,
so I'm not trying to claim that it is,

932
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:18,933
but cain and enabled are the first two 
human beings that are born into the 

933
00:57:22,901 --> 00:57:27,040
world instead of paradise.
And cain is a,

934
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:28,203
uh,
an agriculturalist and Abel is a 

935
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:31,443
shepherd.
And of course that shepherds the 

936
00:57:33,751 --> 00:57:34,584
meckel's much later in through 
Christianity and also in the story of 

937
00:57:37,181 --> 00:57:38,014
King David,
partly because if you are going to be a 

938
00:57:39,761 --> 00:57:40,990
shepherd back then,
man,

939
00:57:40,991 --> 00:57:45,991
you are one tough dude because you had 
slingshots and sticks and their reliance

940
00:57:46,061 --> 00:57:47,890
after your sheep.
So you know,

941
00:57:47,891 --> 00:57:51,430
you weren't little boy blue in pastoral,
Victorian England,

942
00:57:51,431 --> 00:57:55,000
you are one tough character.
So to be a shepherd was no joke.

943
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,313
Anyways,
Cain and Abel are making their way 

944
00:57:59,321 --> 00:58:02,080
through life and Cain is having a very 
rough time.

945
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,230
Things aren't going his way at all.
Whereas able,

946
00:58:05,710 --> 00:58:08,020
everything goes his way.
All the women love him,

947
00:58:08,021 --> 00:58:09,490
his flocks increased.
He's,

948
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:10,383
he's successful in the story.
Also intimate that not only is he 

949
00:58:13,481 --> 00:58:14,314
successful,
but everyone likes him and understands 

950
00:58:16,001 --> 00:58:16,834
why he's successful.
Whereas Cain is kind of bitter and 

951
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:24,490
nothing he ever does works out.
And so they both make sacrifices to God.

952
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:26,590
And I'll tell you,
Sam,

953
00:58:26,591 --> 00:58:30,480
when I started to understand what the 
discovery of sacrifice meant,

954
00:58:30,481 --> 00:58:35,481
it just about blew me out of my room 
because I realized that in the discovery

955
00:58:36,041 --> 00:58:37,810
of sacrifice,
in the acting,

956
00:58:37,811 --> 00:58:38,644
out of sacrifice,
we had information pertaining to the 

957
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:46,800
earliest human discovery that you could 
let something of value go in the present

958
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:52,450
and reap a reward in the future,
which is a staggering realization.

959
00:58:52,451 --> 00:58:54,370
It's actually the discover of the 
future,

960
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:55,503
discovery of the future.
Now people had to act these things out 

961
00:58:58,480 --> 00:58:59,313
and then represent them in stories 
before they could understand them 

962
00:59:01,601 --> 00:59:02,560
psychologically.

963
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:03,843
So cain and Abel make sacrifices.
And the idea is that to keep Yahuah 

964
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:10,900
happy,
the patriarchal spirit happy,

965
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:14,320
you have to sacrifice something of true 
value.

966
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:20,250
It has to be a real genuine sacrifice or
you or you won't reap the future rewards

967
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:21,573
and what,
and everyone knows what that means to 

968
00:59:23,091 --> 00:59:23,924
them because I asked my students all the
time what their parents sacrificed to 

969
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:28,814
send them to university.
And they all understand that perfectly 

970
00:59:31,251 --> 00:59:32,084
well.
And what's happened is their parents 

971
00:59:33,381 --> 00:59:34,214
have made a bargain with the present,
which is that they will forego certain 

972
00:59:37,161 --> 00:59:42,020
kinds of gratification so that they are 
even their children can reap a reward.

973
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,110
They're making a bargain with the 
structure of reality.

974
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:46,453
Now that was personified or 
anthropomorphize depending on on which 

975
00:59:49,491 --> 00:59:50,324
terminology wanna use early when people 
were still starting starting to work 

976
00:59:53,961 --> 00:59:54,794
these things out,
but that didn't destroy the essential 

977
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,560
validity of the idea.

978
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:02,920
Now the story goes,
Abel sacrifices were valid.

979
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:06,080
The story implies that although it's a 
bit ambivalent,

980
01:00:06,081 --> 01:00:06,914
you never know if Cain is doing a bad 
job of sacrificing or if y'all was just 

981
01:00:10,371 --> 01:00:12,200
being a son of a bitch and torturing 
him,

982
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:13,363
which of course is a classic problem 
existentially because you don't know in 

983
01:00:17,241 --> 01:00:18,074
your life when you fail,
if it's because you'd be doing things 

984
01:00:20,301 --> 01:00:24,380
wrong and not making the correct 
sacrifices so to speak,

985
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:28,400
or that fate is just treating you 
harshly and unjustly.

986
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:33,970
But the story into mates that cane is 
making errors in his sacrifices,

987
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:34,963
whatever,
things don't go well for Cain and Abel 

988
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:42,440
continues to to flourish.
So Kane is very unhappy with this.

989
01:00:42,441 --> 01:00:45,860
And one day he decides to have it out 
with the creator of being,

990
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:49,400
which you know,
is a pretty ballsy thing to do,

991
01:00:49,401 --> 01:00:52,770
let's say.
And so he goes and has a chat with God,

992
01:00:52,771 --> 01:00:53,604
and I've got this description of their 
conversation from looking at multiple 

993
01:00:57,831 --> 01:00:59,600
translations of the original text.

994
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:02,360
And he basically confronts cio and he 
says,

995
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:03,583
you know,
what kind of stupid university have you 

996
01:01:04,851 --> 01:01:06,510
put together here?
Um,

997
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:09,980
this being that you've created this 
fundamentally flawed.

998
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,233
I'm out there breaking myself and half 
trying to make everything work and 

999
01:01:14,811 --> 01:01:15,644
nothing ever works out for me.
And then there's that damnable who he 

1000
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:19,874
doesn't,
he already has to lift a finger and you 

1001
01:01:21,141 --> 01:01:21,974
know,
women flocked to him and his camels 

1002
01:01:23,301 --> 01:01:24,380
increase.
It's like,

1003
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:25,560
it's unjust.
It's,

1004
01:01:25,561 --> 01:01:30,020
it's unjust and inappropriate,
and you should be called to task for it.

1005
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:34,760
And so that's the eternal story of 
people complaining about the fundamental

1006
01:01:34,761 --> 01:01:38,600
tragedy and evil of being.
So it's pretty good argument.

1007
01:01:39,590 --> 01:01:43,100
So God says to kick k and he says,
look,

1008
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:45,140
you know,
that's a pretty good argument,

1009
01:01:45,141 --> 01:01:49,760
but here's how I look at it.
You're like a man who's inside the house

1010
01:01:49,761 --> 01:01:54,761
and at the door of the house there's 
this predatory cap that sexually aroused

1011
01:01:55,370 --> 01:01:56,930
and it's,
it's sin.

1012
01:01:56,990 --> 01:01:59,570
It's missing the mark because that's 
what sin means.

1013
01:01:59,571 --> 01:02:04,550
It means to miss the Bullseye.
And you have invited it into your house,

1014
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:05,413
this corruption and sin.
You've invited it into your house 

1015
01:02:07,551 --> 01:02:11,450
voluntarily so that it can have its way 
with you sexually.

1016
01:02:11,451 --> 01:02:12,680
So that,
and you've,

1017
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:13,723
you've intertwined yourself with it 
creatively and brought something 

1018
01:02:17,001 --> 01:02:18,170
horrible forth

1019
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,130
and you're suffering there,

1020
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:21,023
therefore can be laid at your feet and 
you have no reason to call me on the 

1021
01:02:25,471 --> 01:02:28,530
structure of my creation.
And so of course,

1022
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:29,513
that's the last thing that cain wants to
hear because he doesn't want to 

1023
01:02:32,161 --> 01:02:35,280
understand that he's at fault for making
the wrong sacrifices.

1024
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:36,383
So he trots on out of there and the 
story says that his countenance falls 

1025
01:02:40,111 --> 01:02:43,830
and that he's raw,
which is to say almost nothing at all.

1026
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:45,083
And he decides that he's going to serve 
God a good one and wander off and 

1027
01:02:48,721 --> 01:02:51,180
destroy his ideal,
God's ideal,

1028
01:02:51,181 --> 01:02:52,800
but also canes,
all no ideal.

1029
01:02:52,801 --> 01:02:56,340
So we kills his brother and leaves him 
dead.

1030
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:00,450
And that's the story of mankind.
And then it's worth Sam.

1031
01:03:00,451 --> 01:03:01,284
Because what happens after that is that 
cane gives rise to descendants and in 

1032
01:03:06,661 --> 01:03:09,360
his first or so generation of 
descendants,

1033
01:03:09,361 --> 01:03:13,050
if you bother or annoy them,
they kill seven of you,

1034
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:14,363
not one.

1035
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:17,310
And if you bother his descendants,
descendants,

1036
01:03:17,311 --> 01:03:20,100
they kill 49 of you,
not seven.

1037
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:21,323
And then his ultimate descendant or one 
of his ultimate descendants is tubal 

1038
01:03:24,661 --> 01:03:27,360
cane and tubal cane.
Uh,

1039
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:31,470
historically speaking or,
or traditionally speaking,

1040
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:34,800
is the first person who makes weapons of
war.

1041
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,233
And so the idea there is that the deceit
and jealousy and resentment of the 

1042
01:03:40,411 --> 01:03:44,370
individual propagates through society 
until war emerges.

1043
01:03:44,371 --> 01:03:45,204
And then the next story is the flood to 
reactions to this Jordan one is that 

1044
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:51,653
obviously you,
some stories are interesting and are 

1045
01:03:55,051 --> 01:03:59,550
written for a reason and those reasons 
are interesting and I've already granted

1046
01:03:59,551 --> 01:04:00,384
you that in fiction,
that it can be a lot of truth in 

1047
01:04:02,491 --> 01:04:03,930
fiction,
a lot of human truth,

1048
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:04,883
which is distilled there.
And one of his virtues is that when you 

1049
01:04:08,341 --> 01:04:12,060
read somebody like Dostoyevsky or 
tolstoy or Shakespeare,

1050
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:16,170
you can run an emulation,
other people's lived experience.

1051
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:18,270
You can essentially live other lives 
that are,

1052
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:23,360
that you would never live personally and
learn the lessons of those lives,

1053
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:27,900
though you're never going to murder some
old woman in her flat.

1054
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:33,320
You can watch roscommon the cough do it 
and experience a plausible psychological

1055
01:04:36,270 --> 01:04:37,103
arc that follows from that.
So I'm not discounting the value of 

1056
01:04:40,351 --> 01:04:41,041
stories,
it all,

1057
01:04:41,041 --> 01:04:41,874
but it seems to me that what you're 
doing is overlooking in your discussion 

1058
01:04:46,831 --> 01:04:51,390
of Cain and Abel and the the archetype 
of propitiating a god,

1059
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:56,100
you're overlooking the obvious ground 
truth and its consequences here.

1060
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:56,934
And then telling a story,
which is fairly unconstrained by any 

1061
01:05:01,561 --> 01:05:02,394
rules.
The obvious ground truth for me is 

1062
01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:05,603
people thought they were in relationship
to a deity who could become angry and 

1063
01:05:10,231 --> 01:05:11,064
who had to be propitiated.
And this led to some very direct and 

1064
01:05:16,591 --> 01:05:17,950
appalling consequences

1065
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,540
for millennia.
The most extreme beans,

1066
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:24,040
human sacrifice from which we graduated 
too.

1067
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,180
Animal sacrifice,
at least in the Judeochristian tradition

1068
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:28,433
and human sacrifice was real.
And it's virtually a cultural universal 

1069
01:05:31,771 --> 01:05:34,320
and yes,
so there's some archetypal story you can

1070
01:05:34,321 --> 01:05:35,154
tell about it,
but it was perhaps the most barbarous 

1071
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:42,080
symptom of human ignorance about the 
weather,

1072
01:05:42,081 --> 01:05:42,914
about disease,
about good and bad luck about 

1073
01:05:44,930 --> 01:05:47,910
agriculture,
about everything that we have ever given

1074
01:05:47,911 --> 01:05:48,744
rise to and we are quite happy to have 
outgrown it and when whenever we find a 

1075
01:05:52,431 --> 01:05:57,200
culture that is practicing something 
like human sacrifice based on it,

1076
01:05:57,380 --> 01:06:00,230
a notion of propitiating invisible 
deities,

1077
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,313
we see these people as dangerously 
confused and that and any child born 

1078
01:06:05,081 --> 01:06:10,070
into the company of of such adults is an
unlucky one who has to be rescued now.

1079
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:10,933
Right.
I mean the year is 2017 as you were 

1080
01:06:13,171 --> 01:06:14,004
talking,
I was reminded of something I wrote in 

1081
01:06:15,321 --> 01:06:16,154
the end of faith,
my first book and an end note that was 

1082
01:06:18,461 --> 01:06:19,294
kind of pitch to the Joseph Campbell use
of mythology of which you are showing 

1083
01:06:25,171 --> 01:06:27,570
some affinity even though his name 
hasn't come up.

1084
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:29,680
And I just want to read this to you 
because this is,

1085
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:30,933
I believe this counterpoint to this way 
of talking about mythology and stories 

1086
01:06:34,631 --> 01:06:37,920
and archetypes is still valid place is 
still what I think.

1087
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:39,703
I went into a bookstore.
I walked into the cookbook section of a 

1088
01:06:42,301 --> 01:06:45,370
barnes and noble and with my eyes 
closed,

1089
01:06:45,371 --> 01:06:49,400
just ran my hand down the shelf and 
grabbed a book,

1090
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:50,523
opened it at random and looked at the 
first recipe I saw and the book turned 

1091
01:06:53,921 --> 01:06:54,754
out to be a book called a taste of 
Hawaii new cooking from the crossroads 

1092
01:06:58,291 --> 01:07:01,650
of the Pacific.
So here is what I wrote in this end note

1093
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:02,484
in the end of faith and they're in,
I discovered an as yet uncelebrated 

1094
01:07:05,391 --> 01:07:08,900
mystical treatise.
While it appears to be a recipe for walk

1095
01:07:08,901 --> 01:07:12,230
seared fish and shrimp cakes with Ogo 
tomato relish,

1096
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:13,473
we need only study as list of 
ingredients to know that we are in the 

1097
01:07:15,221 --> 01:07:17,770
presence of an unrivaled spiritual 
intelligence.

1098
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:19,680
Then I list the ingredients,
right?

1099
01:07:19,681 --> 01:07:23,750
So there's one snapper fillet cubed,
three teaspoons of chopped scallions,

1100
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:26,650
salt and freshly ground pepper,
as long list of ingredients.

1101
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:28,380
And then I go through with a 
[inaudible],

1102
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:31,240
a mystical interpretation of this 
recipe.

1103
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:33,780
I'll just give you a few sentences to 
give you a sense of,

1104
01:07:33,781 --> 01:07:34,390
it

1105
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:37,680
sounds like you're getting dangerously 
close to paranoid schizophrenia

1106
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:40,053
thing.
I mean this is obviously crazy cause I 

1107
01:07:40,961 --> 01:07:41,794
know how I did this,
but this is as valid sounding or so I 

1108
01:07:45,101 --> 01:07:48,960
would argue as most of what is produced 
in this genre.

1109
01:07:48,961 --> 01:07:52,900
So when I say the snapper fillet of 
course is the individual himself,

1110
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:55,360
you and I,
a wash in the sea of existence.

1111
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:56,473
And here we find it cubed,
which is to say that our situation must 

1112
01:07:59,021 --> 01:08:01,390
be remedied in all three dimensions of 
body,

1113
01:08:01,391 --> 01:08:02,224
mind and spirit.
A have three teaspoons of chopped 

1114
01:08:04,441 --> 01:08:05,274
scallions.
This further partakes of the cubic 

1115
01:08:06,841 --> 01:08:07,674
symmetry suggesting that that which we 
need add to each level of our being by 

1116
01:08:11,031 --> 01:08:14,110
way of antidote comes likewise in equal 
proportions.

1117
01:08:14,310 --> 01:08:16,230
The import of the is clear.
The body,

1118
01:08:16,231 --> 01:08:18,840
mind and spirit need to be tended with 
the same care,

1119
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:20,153
salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Well here we have the perennial 

1120
01:08:23,041 --> 01:08:23,874
invocation of opposites,
the white and black aspects of our 

1121
01:08:26,371 --> 01:08:27,160
nature.

1122
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:30,910
Both good and evil must be understood if
we would fulfill the recipe of spiritual

1123
01:08:30,911 --> 01:08:31,744
life.
Nothing after all can be excluded from 

1124
01:08:33,111 --> 01:08:35,700
the human experience.
It seems to be a tantric text.

1125
01:08:36,030 --> 01:08:39,480
What has more salt and pepper come to us
in the form of grains,

1126
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:40,343
which is to say that the good and bad 
qualities are born at the tiniest 

1127
01:08:42,811 --> 01:08:46,150
actions and that's we're not in good or 
evil in general,

1128
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:47,083
but only by virtue of innumerable 
moments which color the stream of our 

1129
01:08:49,551 --> 01:08:50,384
beans by force of reputation.
Then there's a dash of Cayenne pepper 

1130
01:08:53,521 --> 01:08:55,740
clearly of being of such robust color 
and flavor.

1131
01:08:55,741 --> 01:08:58,790
It's signifies the spiritual influence 
of an enlightened add Dept.

1132
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:03,440
I go on and on and this is all bullshit 
because it's meant to be bullshit.

1133
01:09:03,441 --> 01:09:03,981
I mean,
again,

1134
01:09:03,981 --> 01:09:04,814
this is a random text that I'm giving a 
high falutin spiritual interpretation 

1135
01:09:10,081 --> 01:09:10,914
of,
but my point is you can do this with 

1136
01:09:12,721 --> 01:09:17,721
anything and religions have been doing 
this for millennia with specific books,

1137
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:23,370
which even by the merits of fiction for 
the most part I'm,

1138
01:09:23,380 --> 01:09:24,610
there's some exceptions here.

1139
01:09:24,610 --> 01:09:25,443
I'll grant you that.
There's some bits of the Bible stand 

1140
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:29,430
comparison with the rest of world 
literature,

1141
01:09:29,431 --> 01:09:31,610
but much of it doesn't.
Right.

1142
01:09:31,611 --> 01:09:34,640
Most of these books are profoundly 
mediocre.

1143
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:39,840
The Koran is as mediocre a book as I've 
ever seen on any subject.

1144
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:42,670
Our grant that may be the Arabic is 
beautiful.

1145
01:09:42,671 --> 01:09:46,010
I don't read Arabic,
but the content of the book isn't,

1146
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:49,620
and this is true of most religious 
writing and the,

1147
01:09:49,621 --> 01:09:54,621
the fact that most people most of the 
time have found profound meaning in much

1148
01:09:55,651 --> 01:09:58,540
of this work is not proof otherwise.
I mean,

1149
01:09:58,541 --> 01:10:00,660
again,
if you found me a culture that was doing

1150
01:10:00,661 --> 01:10:03,250
what I just did too,
a recipe in a cookbook,

1151
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:07,830
the fact that they had gone generation 
after generation and namor heard of that

1152
01:10:07,831 --> 01:10:11,940
interpretation wouldn't prove anything.
That's the problem I'm having here.

1153
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:12,950
Yeah.
Well that's good.

1154
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:16,100
I mean what you wrote is very funny too.
You know,

1155
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:18,440
it's very much reminiscent of new age 
thinking.

1156
01:10:18,441 --> 01:10:19,274
I would say.

1157
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:21,780
What's the problem with new age thinking
that in your view?

1158
01:10:22,110 --> 01:10:22,943
Well,
I don't think it's constrained and 

1159
01:10:23,790 --> 01:10:25,770
exactly in the manner that you said.
I mean,

1160
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:28,110
I mentioned that what I've been trying 
to do,

1161
01:10:28,111 --> 01:10:30,100
well,
working my way through the Merck,

1162
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:31,320
let's say,
well,

1163
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:33,180
if you're analyzing scientific 
literature,

1164
01:10:33,181 --> 01:10:38,110
you have to separate the wheat from the 
chaff and like 95% of it is chaff unless

1165
01:10:38,111 --> 01:10:41,560
it's social psychology,
in which case 99% of it is chat,

1166
01:10:42,190 --> 01:10:44,410
but it's chat.
There's a lot of it.

1167
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,273
You have to be discriminating and your 
interpretation in the scientific 

1168
01:10:47,711 --> 01:10:51,300
literature just as another and in other 
literary domains.

1169
01:10:51,870 --> 01:10:52,703
It's certainly the case that we aren't 
as good at distinguishing what 

1170
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:56,684
constitutes quality in the fictional 
domain from what constitutes outright 

1171
01:11:00,121 --> 01:11:02,610
falls to a den and delusion,
let's say.

1172
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:03,853
Um,
any d I used the example of paranoid 

1173
01:11:05,411 --> 01:11:08,620
schizophrenia very specifically there 
because paranoid

1174
01:11:09,130 --> 01:11:09,963
who tend to be among the more 
intelligent people who are cursed with 

1175
01:11:12,251 --> 01:11:13,084
schizophrenia take a set of axioms and 
then weave a compelling story that's 

1176
01:11:17,191 --> 01:11:20,550
logically coherent if you grant the 
validity of the axioms.

1177
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:21,923
And so the kind of merch that you were 
describing it and I think that that 

1178
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:30,381
characterizes in particular new age 
thinking is is an ever present danger.

1179
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:32,880
Not so much of religious thinking 
though,

1180
01:11:32,881 --> 01:11:33,714
Sam.
It's a,

1181
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:36,660
it's an ever present danger of human 
imaginativeness.

1182
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:37,913
You know,
we can produce representations of the 

1183
01:11:39,991 --> 01:11:43,500
world that grip onto the world in many 
ways,

1184
01:11:43,710 --> 01:11:44,543
but then we have to subject them to 
intense criticism and that's why for 

1185
01:11:48,691 --> 01:11:49,524
example,
we both share a belief that the last 

1186
01:11:51,841 --> 01:11:52,674
thing we want to do in our society has 
put any restrictions whatsoever on the 

1187
01:11:55,681 --> 01:11:56,514
human,
a right to criticize religious 

1188
01:11:58,951 --> 01:11:59,784
presuppositions.
I think that's an absolute catastrophe 

1189
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:03,293
and I'm certainly not claiming for a 
second that every possible religious 

1190
01:12:06,871 --> 01:12:08,400
interpretation is correct.

1191
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:09,583
That's,
that's clearly no more than every 

1192
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:12,473
possible work of fiction is of quality.
But the quality issue really is a 

1193
01:12:16,411 --> 01:12:19,350
stickler because it's very,
as we,

1194
01:12:19,410 --> 01:12:21,630
as we've already discussed,
it's,

1195
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:22,673
it's sufficiently evident that there's 
such a thing as great literature to be 

1196
01:12:27,331 --> 01:12:28,164
somewhat self evident that there's truth
embedded in that even though we don't 

1197
01:12:32,131 --> 01:12:34,710
precisely know how to define it.
You know,

1198
01:12:34,711 --> 01:12:38,010
now the postmodernists would take an 
opposing view to that.

1199
01:12:38,011 --> 01:12:38,821
They would say,
well,

1200
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:40,680
there's no truth in literature 
whatsoever.

1201
01:12:40,681 --> 01:12:43,280
It's all a matter of interpretation,
which is an,

1202
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,273
it can in some sense to the objection 
that you're raising and that's all I 

1203
01:12:47,881 --> 01:12:50,430
have to say.
That's a profound objection,

1204
01:12:51,690 --> 01:12:52,523
but I don't,
I believe that it throws the baby out 

1205
01:12:54,481 --> 01:12:56,430
with the bath water.
So,

1206
01:12:56,431 --> 01:13:00,900
so what I've been trying to do is 
discriminate my way through the,

1207
01:13:00,990 --> 01:13:01,823
the wealth of past wisdom that has been 
bequeathed to us and to find patterns 

1208
01:13:06,421 --> 01:13:10,050
and then to verify them using other 
techniques.

1209
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:12,840
Now some of the techniques are,
you know,

1210
01:13:12,841 --> 01:13:13,674
you can,
you can also debate what constitutes an 

1211
01:13:15,181 --> 01:13:18,270
acceptable methodological technique.
But one of,

1212
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:19,313
there are existential techniques as well
and I think you rely on them to some 

1213
01:13:22,501 --> 01:13:25,470
degree when you're talking about the 
necessity of speaking the truth.

1214
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:30,710
Because I would say I've put what I've 
learned from the analysis I've conducted

1215
01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:35,400
into action in my,
in my own life,

1216
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:36,423
which,
which has changed dramatically as a 

1217
01:13:37,441 --> 01:13:38,274
consequence and only for the better in 
the life of my family about which I 

1218
01:13:41,641 --> 01:13:42,474
could say the same thing about the 
teaching that I've done to my students 

1219
01:13:45,661 --> 01:13:46,494
and I've been regarded for 30 years as 
teaching courses at good universities 

1220
01:13:51,451 --> 01:13:52,284
that have been regarded by a vast 
majority of the students is absolutely 

1221
01:13:54,781 --> 01:13:59,460
life transforming and so and there is a 
massive hunger.

1222
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:00,613
It's almost,
it's almost insatiable for more 

1223
01:14:04,201 --> 01:14:07,410
sophisticated understanding of these 
archetypal stories.

1224
01:14:07,650 --> 01:14:08,190
Now,
you know,

1225
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:10,650
you talked about human sacrifice and I 
would say,

1226
01:14:10,651 --> 01:14:12,130
well obviously

1227
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:17,280
that was a catastrophic and barbaric 
epoch in human developmental history and

1228
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:20,013
who would want to go back to that.
But I would say what we've done to that 

1229
01:14:23,471 --> 01:14:24,304
is not so much invalidated as supplanted
with a psychological understanding in 

1230
01:14:29,921 --> 01:14:30,754
that we can sacrifice what we hold dear,
that's holding us back and move forward 

1231
01:14:34,511 --> 01:14:35,860
into the future.
Or,

1232
01:14:35,861 --> 01:14:39,610
or you could say on an even and even 
more super ordinance sense,

1233
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:40,683
it's reasonable for a person to 
sacrifice themselves to what they hold 

1234
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:44,734
as the highest value.
And that's an idea that's built 

1235
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:50,650
extraordinarily deeply into the 
substructure of Christianity.

1236
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:54,400
And it's very much what you're,
in my opinion,

1237
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:58,960
when you tell people that they should 
abandoned,

1238
01:14:58,961 --> 01:14:59,794
let's say they're impulsive desires and 
their instrumental longings and do 

1239
01:15:02,621 --> 01:15:06,390
nothing but tell the truth in some sense
from my perspective,

1240
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,233
what you're telling them is to give up 
their selfish individual being and 

1241
01:15:11,711 --> 01:15:13,750
sacrifice themselves to the truth.

1242
01:15:14,590 --> 01:15:15,423
To me that like I truly believe that 
that's the central message of 

1243
01:15:17,861 --> 01:15:18,694
Christianity.
It's the central message of the 

1244
01:15:19,901 --> 01:15:20,734
Prophetic tradition in Judaism as well 
because the people who spoke truth to 

1245
01:15:24,611 --> 01:15:29,050
power in the old testament were 
generally very unpopular for doing so.

1246
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:35,070
So I know it's a problem separating the 
wheat from the chaff and I think you did

1247
01:15:35,501 --> 01:15:38,650
a great job of satirizing that in,
in what you wrote,

1248
01:15:39,010 --> 01:15:39,843
but that doesn't help us solve the 
problem of the fact that there is value 

1249
01:15:43,871 --> 01:15:46,210
in great fiction.
I don't view that as a problem.

1250
01:15:46,211 --> 01:15:48,850
I think it's obvious that there's,
there's value in it,

1251
01:15:48,851 --> 01:15:49,684
but it's not the value of telling you 
how the cosmos works or what is likely 

1252
01:15:56,561 --> 01:15:58,210
to happen in the future.
Right.

1253
01:15:58,211 --> 01:15:59,044
It's a different kind of value.
It's not a surrogate for a scientific 

1254
01:16:03,221 --> 01:16:05,170
theory about anything.
Right?

1255
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:07,000
Apps,
that's what religion does with it.

1256
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:10,000
Well,
that I would say that that's fine.

1257
01:16:10,001 --> 01:16:13,600
I've got no disagreement with you.
There is thing about the fundamentalists

1258
01:16:13,601 --> 01:16:14,434
say the Christian fundamentalists who 
insist upon a literal understanding of 

1259
01:16:18,761 --> 01:16:19,594
the biblical stories is that they don't 
know what literal means and actually 

1260
01:16:23,321 --> 01:16:24,154
they're,
they're better scientists in some sense 

1261
01:16:25,841 --> 01:16:26,674
then the scientists themselves,
because the scientist would never say 

1262
01:16:29,530 --> 01:16:32,140
that the stories in genesis are 
scientific,

1263
01:16:32,141 --> 01:16:32,974
but the fundamentalists implicitly 
assuming that only scientific fact can 

1264
01:16:37,871 --> 01:16:38,704
be true attempt constantly to force 
these stories into a scientific 

1265
01:16:42,281 --> 01:16:45,940
framework where they do not belong.
Right,

1266
01:16:45,941 --> 01:16:46,774
but again,
the because the stories are believed to 

1267
01:16:48,911 --> 01:16:49,744
be,
we're talking specifically about the 

1268
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:56,850
Judeo Christian tradition because 
they're believed to be revealed truth,

1269
01:16:57,220 --> 01:16:58,053
right?
I mean these are not stories written by 

1270
01:16:59,261 --> 01:17:03,040
human beings.
These are the word of God in some form.

1271
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:04,083
These are not held to be stories.
These are held to be records of things 

1272
01:17:07,721 --> 01:17:08,830
that have actually happened.

1273
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:09,663
So their history books on one level and 
when they talk about what will happen 

1274
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:16,190
when they're obviously given to 
prophesy,

1275
01:17:16,490 --> 01:17:17,323
they are an indication of what will 
happen if you believe God is talking to 

1276
01:17:20,811 --> 01:17:21,250
you and,
and,

1277
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:22,083
and that's where the whole thing becomes
so pathological from an intellectual 

1278
01:17:26,511 --> 01:17:28,190
point of view.
I agree with you.

1279
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:31,330
This is partly why I've spent so much 
time studying nature.

1280
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:32,383
I mean in the,
in the late 1900 and each of basically 

1281
01:17:34,970 --> 01:17:35,803
diagnosed Christianity,
he said that it had produced a 

1282
01:17:38,751 --> 01:17:43,751
tremendous longing for the truth,
which was then used against the dogmatic

1283
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:46,640
elements of Christianity,
which is destroyed.

1284
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:49,400
But some of it's,
I would say some of it is,

1285
01:17:49,401 --> 01:17:53,780
is intense philosophical confusion.
It's like there's a kind of,

1286
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:55,003
let's call it wisdom in fiction if we 
don't want to call it truth because you 

1287
01:17:58,701 --> 01:18:01,790
know,
obviously calling it truth brings up the

1288
01:18:01,791 --> 01:18:03,170
fact issue.

1289
01:18:03,650 --> 01:18:08,150
Let's call it wisdom.
The wisdom is clearly there,

1290
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:09,073
but to consider it as a representation 
of the factual world is not only a 

1291
01:18:12,141 --> 01:18:16,220
mistake but also a dangerous mistake and
it's a self defeating mistake.

1292
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:17,381
You know,
it's,

1293
01:18:17,381 --> 01:18:18,214
it's partly why the fundamentalists who 
insist upon the equivalents of the 

1294
01:18:22,881 --> 01:18:27,440
stories in Genesis and scientific theory
do their own creed,

1295
01:18:27,441 --> 01:18:28,274
a tremendous disservice.
And there they're bound to lose because 

1296
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:34,690
the Bible as science is weak and 
sciences,

1297
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:39,700
science is strong and so there's no,
there's no hope there for people who are

1298
01:18:40,011 --> 01:18:43,460
trying to push fundamentalist Christian 
stories as literally true.

1299
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:47,450
So we can agree on that.
What I'm trying to do,

1300
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:50,840
while I would say what I'm trying to do 
with mythological languages,

1301
01:18:50,841 --> 01:18:54,140
I'm trying to raise my father out of the
belly of the beast,

1302
01:18:54,141 --> 01:18:54,974
out of the belly of the whale.
It in the depths of the ocean because 

1303
01:18:57,741 --> 01:19:00,800
there's,
there's living truth in our traditions.

1304
01:19:01,100 --> 01:19:06,080
Obscured is that is by human ignorance 
and inability to conceive.

1305
01:19:06,081 --> 01:19:09,200
Even that doesn't mean that it can be 
left behind.

1306
01:19:09,201 --> 01:19:12,140
It can't be,
it has to be brought forward and updated

1307
01:19:12,141 --> 01:19:15,200
and give a new site,
which by the way is exactly what happens

1308
01:19:15,201 --> 01:19:20,201
in the Egyptian stories because horace,
that I have attention goes down into the

1309
01:19:20,271 --> 01:19:23,210
underworld and rescues the god of 
tradition.

1310
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:24,373
Oh Cyrus and gives him sight.
And that's exactly what I'm trying to 

1311
01:19:27,591 --> 01:19:30,140
do.
And I think I've been successful at it.

1312
01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:31,663
And so yes,
the interpretation problem is a major 

1313
01:19:34,401 --> 01:19:35,234
one,
but that's something that would be 

1314
01:19:35,691 --> 01:19:38,030
devil's everything.
Absolutely everything.

1315
01:19:38,450 --> 01:19:40,760
The other issue here though is that 
there's a,

1316
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,060
this is another thing that puts religion
in general,

1317
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:50,080
an uneasy relationship with science.
There's a radical provincialism entailed

1318
01:19:50,420 --> 01:19:52,970
in endorsing any specific religion.
So for instance,

1319
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:58,000
if Christianity is right in any sense,
well then all other religions are wrong.

1320
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:01,800
When you look at what Christianity and 
tail.

1321
01:20:01,801 --> 01:20:05,450
So at a minimum,
it suggests that Jesus was the Messiah,

1322
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:07,410
right?
So the Jews are wrong.

1323
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:12,270
Jesus was divine and resurrected.
So the Muslims are wrong.

1324
01:20:12,630 --> 01:20:15,180
There's only one God.
So the Hindus are wrong,

1325
01:20:15,181 --> 01:20:16,014
right?
So even if you want to relax the 

1326
01:20:16,951 --> 01:20:17,784
literalism there,
you're still sending some fairly sharp 

1327
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:23,640
elbows toward the other religions.
Well look,

1328
01:20:23,641 --> 01:20:24,840
this is,
this is again,

1329
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:25,703
I think to give the devil his dude.
This is exactly the point that 

1330
01:20:29,371 --> 01:20:32,040
postmodernists like Derrida have put 
out,

1331
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:34,830
have put forward and very powerfully,
you know,

1332
01:20:34,831 --> 01:20:36,600
they say,
well look,

1333
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:39,690
if you accept a value system as 
paramount,

1334
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:41,633
then you invalidate all other value 
systems and you exclude everyone who 

1335
01:20:45,001 --> 01:20:48,900
isn't succeeding in depth value system.
And their answer is,

1336
01:20:48,901 --> 01:20:49,734
well,
we'll just dissolve all the value 

1337
01:20:51,301 --> 01:20:54,060
systems.
Well that's a completely insane answered

1338
01:20:54,061 --> 01:20:54,894
because you can't even focus on an 
object in the absence of a value system 

1339
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:03,000
technically speaking,
because you're always focusing on things

1340
01:21:03,001 --> 01:21:03,834
of value,
right?

1341
01:21:04,350 --> 01:21:09,350
And so the fact that the conflict that 
you described is an emergent consequence

1342
01:21:09,811 --> 01:21:14,280
of value systems is a terrible problem 
and we don't know how to solve it.

1343
01:21:14,281 --> 01:21:15,114
Although I think the solution 
paradoxically enough is actually 

1344
01:21:18,721 --> 01:21:19,554
embedded to some degree in Christianity.
And the reason for that is because 

1345
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:26,490
Christianity makes the group's 
subordinate to the individual.

1346
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:27,863
And it also hypothesizes that the 
highest moral virtue that a person 

1347
01:21:32,941 --> 01:21:37,941
should uphold is that of the truth and 
the truth speaks chaos into order in the

1348
01:21:38,851 --> 01:21:43,851
most beneficial possible way and that 
that's the fundamental ethical duty.

1349
01:21:44,790 --> 01:21:49,790
But why make this a matter of allegiance
to Christianity?

1350
01:21:50,731 --> 01:21:54,210
Why not just take what is useful in any 
tradition?

1351
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:56,490
You just mentioned Nietzsche,
right?

1352
01:21:56,491 --> 01:21:57,324
So you found some of his work useful.
There's no tradition of allegiance to 

1353
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:04,050
Nietzsche.
You don't,

1354
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:04,933
you don't have to worry about whether or
not you are sufficiently Nietzschean in 

1355
01:22:09,331 --> 01:22:10,980
order to use his wisdom.

1356
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:14,550
You just take from him and so far as 
it's useful,

1357
01:22:14,551 --> 01:22:16,890
why not do the same thing with 
Christianity?

1358
01:22:16,891 --> 01:22:17,724
Why?
Why waste any time wondering whether or 

1359
01:22:20,281 --> 01:22:24,390
not you are a Christian or telling 
people that you are or not?

1360
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:25,433
Why not get out of the religion business
and use everything that is useful in 

1361
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:31,044
human culture?
However it comes to you in a way that's 

1362
01:22:34,330 --> 01:22:36,070
nondenominational.
Well,

1363
01:22:36,071 --> 01:22:38,970
we thought could be achieved.
That would be absolutely wonderful.

1364
01:22:38,971 --> 01:22:39,804
I,
I would say the first problem with that 

1365
01:22:41,611 --> 01:22:42,444
is that,
or the historical problem with that is 

1366
01:22:44,311 --> 01:22:48,600
that the kind of truth that have emerged
out of this lengthy,

1367
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:52,110
mythological process,
this lengthy,

1368
01:22:52,111 --> 01:22:54,240
imaginative,
mythological process,

1369
01:22:54,450 --> 01:22:58,530
we're first encapsulated inside the 
stories and the images.

1370
01:22:58,560 --> 01:22:59,393
They weren't articulated philosophical 
or psychological truth out of the kind 

1371
01:23:03,841 --> 01:23:06,220
that we're speaking.
Look,

1372
01:23:06,221 --> 01:23:07,054
you can,
you can think about this like the 

1373
01:23:07,901 --> 01:23:10,180
relationship between Dostoyevsky and 
Nicha.

1374
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:15,930
So Dostoyevsky and nature were very 
similar in many ways philosophically,

1375
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:19,720
but Dostoyevsky wasn't a philosopher.
He was a storyteller.

1376
01:23:20,050 --> 01:23:23,170
Implicit in his stories was Nietzschean 
philosophy.

1377
01:23:23,171 --> 01:23:26,260
Even though paradoxically enough,
Dostoyevsky was a Christian.

1378
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:31,300
The storyteller's get there before the 
philosophers and you know,

1379
01:23:31,301 --> 01:23:33,880
you're saying now that the philosophers 
have got there,

1380
01:23:33,881 --> 01:23:38,881
maybe we don't have to pledge allegiance
to a canonical version of the story.

1381
01:23:39,370 --> 01:23:41,440
And that could be the case.
In fact,

1382
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:42,633
you see,
partly nature criticized Christianity 

1383
01:23:46,210 --> 01:23:47,043
for all the reasons that you just 
criticized Christianity or any other 

1384
01:23:49,601 --> 01:23:50,590
creed.
Devin,

1385
01:23:50,591 --> 01:23:51,424
a devastating manner.
Although he was also extraordinarily 

1386
01:23:53,501 --> 01:23:57,220
grateful to Christianity because he 
believed it had disciplined the European

1387
01:23:57,221 --> 01:24:01,300
mind and that that period of discipline 
was necessary.

1388
01:24:01,301 --> 01:24:04,900
A period where everything was 
interpreted under the rubric of a single

1389
01:24:04,901 --> 01:24:07,900
interpretation because that taught 
concentration.

1390
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:09,700
But nature said,
well,

1391
01:24:09,701 --> 01:24:14,230
now we're beyond that and we're going to
have to become gods of our own accord in

1392
01:24:14,231 --> 01:24:16,480
order to withstand the consequences.

1393
01:24:16,930 --> 01:24:17,763
And then of course,
that turned out to be very problematic 

1394
01:24:20,290 --> 01:24:21,123
for reasons that to also prophesied 
because he said that the West would 

1395
01:24:23,891 --> 01:24:28,300
degenerate both into nihilism and into 
totalitarianism,

1396
01:24:28,540 --> 01:24:32,350
and that millions of people would die as
a consequence of the death of God.

1397
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:36,940
And that's Dostoyevsky prophesied 
exactly the same thing in the devils.

1398
01:24:36,941 --> 01:24:41,941
And it's exactly what happened.
And I don't believe that we can get past

1399
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:43,533
the Scylla and Charybdis of nihilism and
totalitarianism without going back to 

1400
01:24:47,711 --> 01:24:48,544
the past to find what it has to offer us
to bring it forward in an articulated 

1401
01:24:53,111 --> 01:24:54,220
manner.
And of course,

1402
01:24:54,221 --> 01:24:55,054
that's precisely why I think the 
discussion that I'm having with you is 

1403
01:24:57,491 --> 01:24:59,890
important because I think that's what 
we're doing,

1404
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:00,993
right?
But there are two ways of going back to 

1405
01:25:02,951 --> 01:25:05,140
the past.
You exemplify both of them.

1406
01:25:05,141 --> 01:25:09,570
You are going back talking about people 
like nature,

1407
01:25:09,630 --> 01:25:10,210
right?

1408
01:25:10,210 --> 01:25:15,210
And you can throw the rest of philosophy
and world literature into that Bin,

1409
01:25:16,150 --> 01:25:21,150
but then it sounds like you are also 
tempted to go back in what appears to be

1410
01:25:21,731 --> 01:25:25,630
a different category of effort,
which is the religious one,

1411
01:25:25,631 --> 01:25:28,360
which is at you.
You're holding to one side,

1412
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:29,553
certain arguably fiction writers and 
philosophers as being something other 

1413
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:36,393
than fiction writers and philosophers 
and treating certain texts as something 

1414
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:43,420
other than mere products of the human 
mind.

1415
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,820
And you have a lot of company,
right?

1416
01:25:45,821 --> 01:25:47,710
This is what every religious person 
does,

1417
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:52,740
but why not treat Jesus the same way you
would treat socrates?

1418
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:54,400
Well,
that's a,

1419
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,233
that's a good start.
I think that socrates and Jesus had an 

1420
01:25:57,311 --> 01:25:58,144
awful lot in common,
but the thing about socrates is that 

1421
01:26:00,341 --> 01:26:01,174
he's primarily a historical figure,
whereas Christ may have been a 

1422
01:26:04,521 --> 01:26:05,354
historical figure.
I think that the simplest assumption is 

1423
01:26:07,671 --> 01:26:11,120
that someone of that description 
existed,

1424
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:12,613
but he's also a mythological character 
and the mythologies unbelievably deep 

1425
01:26:17,031 --> 01:26:17,864
and what it is in some sense is it is 
the human imagination is attempt to 

1426
01:26:22,191 --> 01:26:25,220
construct a representation of the 
perfect man.

1427
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:29,510
And so Christ is the perfect map.
Now,

1428
01:26:29,540 --> 01:26:30,261
you may say,
well,

1429
01:26:30,261 --> 01:26:31,094
we don't know what that means.
You can say that Jesus was the perfect 

1430
01:26:35,091 --> 01:26:37,370
man.
I didn't say that.

1431
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:40,730
I didn't say,
I said that Christ is the perfect man,

1432
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:44,600
that it's different.
Because I'm speaking at the mythological

1433
01:26:44,601 --> 01:26:45,434
level is that whatever human beings can 
imagine as perfect in terms of the 

1434
01:26:52,161 --> 01:26:54,770
manner in which an individual could 
conduct himself,

1435
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:56,233
acts would Christ represents.
I'm not claiming for a moment that that 

1436
01:26:59,421 --> 01:27:03,260
manifested itself in history.
That's a different claim and we can talk

1437
01:27:03,261 --> 01:27:04,094
about that claim to,
but I would say it didn't even manifest 

1438
01:27:06,861 --> 01:27:07,694
itself in the Bible.
If you're going to write a story about 

1439
01:27:11,181 --> 01:27:14,450
the perfect man,
a fiction of the perfect man,

1440
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:18,080
you wouldn't write it the way the New 
Testament is written.

1441
01:27:18,230 --> 01:27:23,230
And you would get Jesus to do things 
that he didn't do and not do things that

1442
01:27:23,541 --> 01:27:24,374
he did do.

1443
01:27:24,380 --> 01:27:26,810
And he would say things that he didn't 
say.

1444
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,600
He can get a lot more perfect than what 
you see.

1445
01:27:29,601 --> 01:27:31,220
And in Matthew,
mark,

1446
01:27:31,221 --> 01:27:32,054
Luke,
and John.

1447
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:33,170
Okay.
So let,

1448
01:27:33,170 --> 01:27:35,720
let me,
let me tell you why briefly,

1449
01:27:35,990 --> 01:27:38,330
why that story's architect will be 
perfect.

1450
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:40,131
Okay.
So,

1451
01:27:40,131 --> 01:27:40,964
so here's the reason.
It's because as has been agreed upon by 

1452
01:27:44,451 --> 01:27:45,284
the sages of the ages,
let's say the fundamental reality of 

1453
01:27:48,351 --> 01:27:50,960
life is suffering and,
and finitude.

1454
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:56,320
And you can layer on top of that from an
existential perspective,

1455
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:01,960
malevolence and injustice,
and that's the law of human beings.

1456
01:28:02,481 --> 01:28:05,960
And so here's an archetypal story.
The most perfect,

1457
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:11,740
innocent,
sinless person possible is betrayed by

1458
01:28:13,850 --> 01:28:16,790
his friends,
his countrymen,

1459
01:28:18,470 --> 01:28:19,303
and the foreigners simultaneously for no
crime whatsoever in the most torturous 

1460
01:28:25,521 --> 01:28:26,354
possible way,
and also abandoned by the creator of 

1461
01:28:29,931 --> 01:28:34,190
being himself.
And he accepts that all voluntarily.

1462
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:36,133
You see,
the reason it's an archetypal story is 

1463
01:28:37,461 --> 01:28:40,900
because you can't get beyond that.
You see it,

1464
01:28:40,901 --> 01:28:44,330
it hits a limit.
It's the limit of tragedy.

1465
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:49,250
And so that's where the perfection lies.
Now the issue is,

1466
01:28:49,251 --> 01:28:50,570
well,
what does that mean?

1467
01:28:50,571 --> 01:28:51,404
And here's what it means.
We can go incrementally here because I 

1468
01:28:54,290 --> 01:28:57,500
don't even buy that.
It's the limit of tragedy.

1469
01:28:57,501 --> 01:28:58,041
I mean,
first of all,

1470
01:28:58,041 --> 01:29:01,160
the thing is anchored to a belief in

1471
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:02,333
human sacrifice.
This is what is so weird about 

1472
01:29:04,681 --> 01:29:05,514
Christianity from my point of view is 
that this is not a religion that 

1473
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:11,750
disavows human sacrifice.
This is a religion.

1474
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:16,210
It claims that human sacrifice is real 
and important,

1475
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:20,170
but there was only one that was in fact 
necessary and effective,

1476
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:22,060
and that is the sacrifice of Jesus.

1477
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:23,133
Well,
that's the Protestant and the Catholic 

1478
01:29:24,251 --> 01:29:25,084
interpretation.
It's not so clear with the Orthodox 

1479
01:29:27,250 --> 01:29:28,083
Christians,
they don't really,

1480
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,153
they by the aversion of Christianity,
that's more and stress is more each 

1481
01:29:32,861 --> 01:29:36,070
individual's moral obligation to do the 
same thing.

1482
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:39,130
I don't know enough about Orthodox 
belief to dispute that,

1483
01:29:39,131 --> 01:29:39,964
but most western Christians have 
unacknowledged at the core of their 

1484
01:29:43,741 --> 01:29:44,574
belief system,
this assertion of the validity of human 

1485
01:29:48,181 --> 01:29:49,110
sacrifice.
Right,

1486
01:29:49,111 --> 01:29:50,430
which is insanity.

1487
01:29:50,790 --> 01:29:52,720
Well,
I did the sat.

1488
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:55,560
If you think about sacrifice in the way 
that we talked about it

1489
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:58,140
early,
that's not the way it's thought about.

1490
01:29:58,380 --> 01:30:03,320
Even in the Bible,
he had to die for our sins,

1491
01:30:03,321 --> 01:30:04,580
right?
He is the scapegoat.

1492
01:30:04,790 --> 01:30:07,490
He is the only effective scape goat and 
he's a hero.

1493
01:30:07,491 --> 01:30:11,130
He's perfect in your terms because he 
took this on voluntarily.

1494
01:30:11,260 --> 01:30:12,500
We need to go back to what you were just
saying.

1495
01:30:12,530 --> 01:30:16,240
This is not the ultimate tragedy because
he did take it on voluntarily.

1496
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:20,500
It's more tragic if someone really get 
screwed by the cosmos.

1497
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:22,510
Oh yes,
you're right about that.

1498
01:30:22,780 --> 01:30:23,770
But the,
the part,

1499
01:30:23,771 --> 01:30:24,604
the fact that he took on voluntarily is 
actually the part of this story that 

1500
01:30:28,561 --> 01:30:31,440
involves the transcendence of the 
tragedy.

1501
01:30:31,870 --> 01:30:32,691
Because the,
the,

1502
01:30:32,691 --> 01:30:35,470
the story there,
and this is a very old story,

1503
01:30:35,471 --> 01:30:40,240
it's far older than Christianity.
The story is that the best way to,

1504
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:41,593
to transcend the,
the bitterness of life is to accept it 

1505
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:46,540
completely.

1506
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:47,420
Hmm.

1507
01:30:47,420 --> 01:30:50,420
Including including betrayal at the 
hands of your friends,

1508
01:30:50,421 --> 01:30:53,030
including betrayal at the hands of your 
countrymen and,

1509
01:30:53,090 --> 01:30:57,970
and the foreigners to,
to allow that to be acceptable,

1510
01:30:57,971 --> 01:30:58,804
to take it on voluntarily and not to be 
bitter about it like cain cause you get 

1511
01:31:02,981 --> 01:31:04,420
murderous when you're bitter.

1512
01:31:04,650 --> 01:31:05,483
So I can go with you there.
But now if that is what you find 

1513
01:31:08,181 --> 01:31:12,420
compelling in this story,
I could just offer for your examination.

1514
01:31:13,010 --> 01:31:14,720
Another example,
another story,

1515
01:31:14,721 --> 01:31:15,554
another tradition,
which in its details is basically 

1516
01:31:18,751 --> 01:31:22,080
irreconcilable with Christianity,
but it's also well subscribed.

1517
01:31:22,090 --> 01:31:24,270
It's the Buddha and Buddhism,
right?

1518
01:31:24,271 --> 01:31:26,760
The Buddha is another example of the 
perfect man.

1519
01:31:27,310 --> 01:31:28,143
He does give you a similar rationale to 
the one you just gave for radical 

1520
01:31:32,751 --> 01:31:37,751
acceptance of the vicissitudes of life.
And yet he's far more articulate.

1521
01:31:39,221 --> 01:31:40,054
I'm here now,
we're talking about the historical 

1522
01:31:40,811 --> 01:31:44,430
Buddha who predated Jesus by five 
centuries,

1523
01:31:44,431 --> 01:31:49,431
but who seems to have said much more 
that is psychologically perspicacious.

1524
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:54,230
And he talks exactly on that point about
the nature of acceptance,

1525
01:31:54,410 --> 01:31:57,040
what psychologically is accomplished 
when you do,

1526
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:58,233
except your experience to moment and the
barriers to doing that and the way in 

1527
01:32:02,821 --> 01:32:04,110
which you should structure your life.

1528
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:07,350
So as to be able to do that more and 
more moment by moment.

1529
01:32:07,351 --> 01:32:12,351
And he presented a methodology of 
meditation that is even today,

1530
01:32:12,620 --> 01:32:15,440
almost perfectly designed.
If you're going to talk about the oldest

1531
01:32:15,441 --> 01:32:17,300
tradition of Buddhism,
the Teravata,

1532
01:32:17,770 --> 01:32:22,770
it's almost perfectly designed for 
export into a secular context.

1533
01:32:23,011 --> 01:32:23,844
So you can take whole sections of the 
Pali Canon and if you just filter out 

1534
01:32:28,201 --> 01:32:29,034
some of the needless repetition and some
of the phrasiology that treats the 

1535
01:32:33,780 --> 01:32:36,860
Buddha like the perfect world conquering
hero who Buddhists believe him to be and

1536
01:32:36,861 --> 01:32:37,694
you just look at what is being said,
it's almost a perfectly secular recipe 

1537
01:32:41,811 --> 01:32:42,644
for training your mind in essentially a 
course of growth toward the kind of 

1538
01:32:47,231 --> 01:32:49,400
acceptance you are talking about.
Again,

1539
01:32:49,401 --> 01:32:50,234
I'm not urging you to be a Buddhist,
I'm just saying this is an example that 

1540
01:32:53,611 --> 01:32:58,611
is non Christian that does much of what 
you are claiming Christianity

1541
01:32:59,290 --> 01:32:59,690
perhaps

1542
01:32:59,690 --> 01:33:00,523
uniquely does.
It invites a non mythological 

1543
01:33:03,450 --> 01:33:04,380
relationship to it.

1544
01:33:04,750 --> 01:33:05,583
Well only if you strip the methodology 
away from it and I think actually that 

1545
01:33:09,531 --> 01:33:10,364
you make a mistake with that.
A person makes a mistake with Buddhism 

1546
01:33:13,101 --> 01:33:14,310
if they do that,
you see,

1547
01:33:14,311 --> 01:33:15,144
because there's also a longing for 
religious experience that's part of the 

1548
01:33:17,971 --> 01:33:18,804
human soul and for example,
that's why people smoke marijuana and 

1549
01:33:22,261 --> 01:33:23,940
why they take psychedelic drugs

1550
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:25,660
and why they meditate.
But again,

1551
01:33:25,661 --> 01:33:28,000
I would argue,
and this is what I argue in my book,

1552
01:33:28,001 --> 01:33:28,834
Waking Up,
you can have the most esoteric 

1553
01:33:30,671 --> 01:33:31,504
experiences are classically interpreted 
as religious or mystical or spiritual 

1554
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:38,083
without believing anything on 
insufficient evidence and certainly 

1555
01:33:40,521 --> 01:33:44,790
without structuring your,
your interpretation of these experiences

1556
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:45,793
along classically a religious dogmatic 
lines or even Joseph Cam bellion 

1557
01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:51,083
mythological lines.
You can essentially be a scientist of 

1558
01:33:53,731 --> 01:33:56,500
introspection and you can use drugs to 
do that.

1559
01:33:56,501 --> 01:33:57,334
You can use new technology to do that.
You can use ancient techniques of 

1560
01:34:00,001 --> 01:34:00,834
meditation to do that.
You could even do something which is 

1561
01:34:04,260 --> 01:34:09,260
seems to partake of delusional thinking.
To do that and just notice the outcome.

1562
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:12,470
I mean there are practices like in 
Tibetan Buddhism,

1563
01:34:12,471 --> 01:34:16,700
there's something called Deity practice 
where you imagine yourself to be a deity

1564
01:34:16,820 --> 01:34:21,820
or a Bodhisattva and the practice of 
imagining yourself to be that is not the

1565
01:34:22,091 --> 01:34:25,450
same thing as becoming delusional and 
thinking you are that

1566
01:34:25,620 --> 01:34:29,550
that's exactly the same thing as the 
mystical imitation of Christ.

1567
01:34:29,551 --> 01:34:30,990
It's exactly the same idea.

1568
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:33,620
So you could do that with Christ.
You could do it with Batman.

1569
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:34,633
You could say to someone who's shy and 
who doesn't like to go to parties 

1570
01:34:36,981 --> 01:34:37,814
because they just don't like each 
subsequent encounter with a stranger 

1571
01:34:40,941 --> 01:34:41,774
that they,
where they have to overcome their 

1572
01:34:42,891 --> 01:34:43,724
shyness and their inability to make 
small talk and all the rest of shyness 

1573
01:34:46,321 --> 01:34:49,560
is a psychological problem that 
virtually everyone has to some degree or

1574
01:34:49,561 --> 01:34:53,710
another.
And perhaps one way to overcome it is to

1575
01:34:53,711 --> 01:34:58,711
walk into a party just trying on the 
idea that you are Batman,

1576
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,260
right?
That you're Bruce Wayne,

1577
01:35:02,261 --> 01:35:03,094
right?
That you have this all of these secret 

1578
01:35:03,971 --> 01:35:08,971
abilities or your Jason Bourne or some 
powerful character who

1579
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:10,810
that's exactly it

1580
01:35:10,890 --> 01:35:13,560
is capable of great things,
but we know as a total fiction.

1581
01:35:13,561 --> 01:35:16,080
So now does that have any psychological 
consequence?

1582
01:35:16,081 --> 01:35:17,580
And if so,
why?

1583
01:35:17,890 --> 01:35:18,723
I think there's no question can have a 
psychological consequences and can be 

1584
01:35:21,761 --> 01:35:22,594
useful to do that.
The crucial thing there is that you can 

1585
01:35:25,071 --> 01:35:28,540
play with those kind of Schema without 
diluting yourself.

1586
01:35:28,570 --> 01:35:29,403
Like if at any point in that adventure 
someone tapped you on the shoulder and 

1587
01:35:33,811 --> 01:35:36,300
said,
but do you really think you are Batman?

1588
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:38,030
You would say no.
Now,

1589
01:35:38,031 --> 01:35:41,660
the problem is when you meet the guy who
really thinks he's Batman,

1590
01:35:41,780 --> 01:35:46,020
that's where you're,
you cross over into dangerously divisive

1591
01:35:46,021 --> 01:35:49,560
and unsupported ideas about the nature 
of reality and religion.

1592
01:35:49,640 --> 01:35:54,190
It's really the only game in town when 
you want to dignify those ideas,

1593
01:35:54,191 --> 01:35:57,640
generation after generation and protect 
them from criticism.

1594
01:35:57,641 --> 01:36:01,700
That's why the scientific attitude of 
speaking honestly about facts,

1595
01:36:02,160 --> 01:36:06,430
heaps smashing into religion uniquely.
It doesn't smash into fiction,

1596
01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:10,090
doesn't smash into Dostoevsky.
It smashes into Jesus,

1597
01:36:10,091 --> 01:36:10,924
right?
Because of what most people are doing 

1598
01:36:12,011 --> 01:36:12,844
with Jesus.

1599
01:36:12,990 --> 01:36:13,580
Yes.
Well,

1600
01:36:13,580 --> 01:36:14,660
okay,
so right,

1601
01:36:15,210 --> 01:36:17,710
no arguments there.
Let me,

1602
01:36:17,790 --> 01:36:18,660
let me,
uh,

1603
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:20,520
all for you.
Uh,

1604
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:25,440
an elaboration of your idea.
So let's say no kid wants to be Batman.

1605
01:36:25,680 --> 01:36:26,513
While that's right,
because that's why he's reading the 

1606
01:36:27,571 --> 01:36:32,040
comics and that's why he's going to the 
billion dollar marvel movies that are DC

1607
01:36:32,041 --> 01:36:35,130
movies that portray these superheroes 
out on the screen.

1608
01:36:35,131 --> 01:36:40,131
It's because the kid is acting them out.
Imagination is trying on an ideal.

1609
01:36:41,210 --> 01:36:42,050
So let's say,
well,

1610
01:36:42,051 --> 01:36:44,720
maybe you start with a pro wrestler 
because you're,

1611
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:45,733
you know,
you're not that conceptually 

1612
01:36:46,311 --> 01:36:47,144
sophisticated.
And then maybe you move to Batman and 

1613
01:36:49,071 --> 01:36:49,904
then maybe move from Batman to thor in 
the marvel cartoons and narrow you're 

1614
01:36:54,831 --> 01:36:55,664
in,
you're in the domain of quats 

1615
01:36:57,051 --> 01:36:59,060
identities.
And then maybe you get a little bit more

1616
01:36:59,061 --> 01:36:59,894
sophisticated than that and you try on 
Jesus or Buddha and then you ask 

1617
01:37:04,011 --> 01:37:04,611
yourself,
well,

1618
01:37:04,611 --> 01:37:07,880
what would happen to the world if you 
tried those on completely?

1619
01:37:09,070 --> 01:37:12,990
And that's the real question,
that that's where the historical element

1620
01:37:12,991 --> 01:37:13,824
and the mythological element meat,
I mean there's obviously a hierarchy of 

1621
01:37:16,811 --> 01:37:17,644
rank among individuals and some people 
have a much more positive impact on the 

1622
01:37:21,011 --> 01:37:24,070
world through their actions than others.
And there's an,

1623
01:37:24,190 --> 01:37:27,070
there's,
there's some hypothetical ultimate limit

1624
01:37:27,071 --> 01:37:27,904
to that.
If you were the best person you could 

1625
01:37:29,761 --> 01:37:30,594
possibly be in every possible way,
just exactly how much good could you 

1626
01:37:34,261 --> 01:37:35,094
bring into the world.
And at what point would you be a bought 

1627
01:37:37,311 --> 01:37:38,144
of sap?
Fuck,

1628
01:37:38,790 --> 01:37:41,250
that's something Buddhist sask 
themselves all the time.

1629
01:37:41,790 --> 01:37:43,950
Wait,
would you be an incarnation of Christ?

1630
01:37:44,330 --> 01:37:48,710
Something that isn't just mythological 
or imaginative or delusional.

1631
01:37:49,330 --> 01:37:52,790
It's a partial because if the ideal 
recedes as you approach it,

1632
01:37:53,740 --> 01:37:57,680
but there's a reality underneath which 
is better,

1633
01:37:57,681 --> 01:38:00,470
people are better and worse,
people are worse.

1634
01:38:00,670 --> 01:38:02,830
And there's archetipal limits to both of
those.

1635
01:38:03,850 --> 01:38:06,840
So these are,
these are very complicated things.

1636
01:38:06,841 --> 01:38:07,870
They're not,
they're,

1637
01:38:07,880 --> 01:38:08,713
they're fiction in the sense.
But I would think about the more as 

1638
01:38:10,571 --> 01:38:12,270
metaphysician there,
there,

1639
01:38:12,310 --> 01:38:13,143
what happens when you distill fiction 
into whatever centrally true about 

1640
01:38:16,631 --> 01:38:18,610
fiction.
And it's really,

1641
01:38:18,611 --> 01:38:19,690
really true.

1642
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:21,020
Well,
I would grant you,

1643
01:38:21,021 --> 01:38:23,130
and again,
this is the topic of my book,

1644
01:38:23,131 --> 01:38:23,964
Waking Up,
that there are possibilities on the 

1645
01:38:26,371 --> 01:38:27,204
positive end of human psychology that 
very few people actualize for any 

1646
01:38:31,261 --> 01:38:32,094
significant amount of time.
And people glimpse them in their best 

1647
01:38:35,181 --> 01:38:38,330
moments in life.
They have peak experiences,

1648
01:38:38,331 --> 01:38:40,400
whether on drugs or,
you know,

1649
01:38:40,430 --> 01:38:41,263
after some crisis or they've been 
fasting or they have moments where they 

1650
01:38:44,901 --> 01:38:45,734
feel as good as they have ever felt.
They feel as in touch as they ever will 

1651
01:38:52,171 --> 01:38:53,004
with just the sheer profundity of 
slamming into the present moment and 

1652
01:38:57,471 --> 01:39:01,280
finding it totally captivating and 
worthy of their attention.

1653
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:03,310
They're not looking elsewhere for 
anything.

1654
01:39:03,620 --> 01:39:04,453
They have become identical to the 
feeling of being and found it to be in 

1655
01:39:10,571 --> 01:39:12,280
some basic sense.
Perfect.

1656
01:39:12,590 --> 01:39:13,423
Now that's available to us as human 
beings and there's not much of a 

1657
01:39:17,931 --> 01:39:20,690
scientific story to tell about it at the
moment.

1658
01:39:21,140 --> 01:39:26,060
It's not arrived at by understanding 
more about the universe scientifically,

1659
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:30,400
so it is in some sense orthogonal to all
of science,

1660
01:39:30,580 --> 01:39:31,020
but

1661
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:31,310
right.

1662
01:39:31,310 --> 01:39:35,090
My point is that it doesn't require 
delusion either.

1663
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:38,420
It doesn't require belief in anything on
insufficient evidence.

1664
01:39:38,421 --> 01:39:42,290
It doesn't require that we,
I believe certain books were revealed by

1665
01:39:42,291 --> 01:39:44,120
the creator of the universe and others 
weren't.

1666
01:39:44,260 --> 01:39:45,093
You can get rid of 90% of what people 
are doing in the name of religion and 

1667
01:39:51,281 --> 01:39:55,480
spirituality and mysticism and still 
fine.

1668
01:39:55,670 --> 01:39:56,503
This project captivating.
The 10% that you retained perhaps is 

1669
01:40:00,950 --> 01:40:01,783
when you hear these stories about people
like Buddha and Jesus and all of the 

1670
01:40:05,581 --> 01:40:08,370
people who have made heroic efforts to 
be like them.

1671
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:12,900
Historically Christian,
contemplative and Buddhist monks and all

1672
01:40:12,901 --> 01:40:13,734
the rest.
You can find in the biographies and 

1673
01:40:16,821 --> 01:40:17,654
pseudo biographies of these people,
some evidence that transforming the 

1674
01:40:21,501 --> 01:40:22,334
human mind as possible.
And you can find that evidence in your 

1675
01:40:24,581 --> 01:40:26,830
own life if you have the right 
experiences.

1676
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:29,940
And you can see that human consciousness
is perturbed,

1677
01:40:29,941 --> 01:40:30,774
bubble and plastic,
and you need not be who you were 

1678
01:40:33,531 --> 01:40:34,364
yesterday.

1679
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:37,570
And so when you're talking about 
becoming your best self or becoming more

1680
01:40:37,571 --> 01:40:40,330
and more like the best selves that have 
ever existed,

1681
01:40:40,710 --> 01:40:44,220
are you talk about transcending the self
itself as an illusion,

1682
01:40:44,221 --> 01:40:45,054
right?
All of this stuff is worth thinking 

1683
01:40:46,691 --> 01:40:49,180
about and paying attention to.
And there is a there there.

1684
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:53,130
I'm not doubting that for a second what 
I'm insisting upon.

1685
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:53,993
However,
is that right?

1686
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:59,280
We need never step off the razor's edge 
of real honesty and conceptual integrity

1687
01:41:02,630 --> 01:41:05,640
even for a moment in order to walk in 
that direction.

1688
01:41:05,641 --> 01:41:07,050
And that's,
as you said,

1689
01:41:07,051 --> 01:41:07,884
most new agers see no problem in 
indulging any kind of happy talk about 

1690
01:41:11,711 --> 01:41:15,110
the significance of crystals or whatever
it is they're connected to.

1691
01:41:15,170 --> 01:41:19,090
And that's where it becomes startlingly 
unscientific.

1692
01:41:19,091 --> 01:41:19,924
And that's where he's someone like 
Deepak Chopra and I can't agree about 

1693
01:41:23,130 --> 01:41:25,790
how talk about things because the moment
we start,

1694
01:41:26,220 --> 01:41:27,450
he hits me with,
you know,

1695
01:41:27,451 --> 01:41:28,284
you close your eyes and you feel at one 
with the universe that proves that you 

1696
01:41:31,740 --> 01:41:33,210
proceeded the Big Bang.

1697
01:41:33,210 --> 01:41:35,520
Your consciousness was there before the 
big bang.

1698
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:37,700
Now of course it proves nothing of the 
kind.

1699
01:41:37,820 --> 01:41:39,710
That's where he becomes a pseudo 
scientists.

1700
01:41:39,711 --> 01:41:43,100
And so what I'm arguing for is that we 
just remain attentive.

1701
01:41:43,590 --> 01:41:44,423
Two honest talk about what we know about
reality even while we have deep 

1702
01:41:50,411 --> 01:41:53,140
experiences and seek them out by 
whatever means.

1703
01:41:53,141 --> 01:41:53,974
And again,
I will grant you that there are means 

1704
01:41:56,340 --> 01:41:57,173
what amount to a kind of internal 
costume party where you can think in 

1705
01:42:00,491 --> 01:42:02,500
terms of myth.
If you said to me,

1706
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:03,533
Sam,
I want you to think of the rest of your 

1707
01:42:04,651 --> 01:42:05,484
day in terms of the hero archetype.
What are you doing today to slay the 

1708
01:42:10,511 --> 01:42:14,410
dragon and bring back that hoarded 
wealth to your community?

1709
01:42:14,710 --> 01:42:18,260
That's a pattern of thought.
I have no question.

1710
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:20,150
Could have some utility.
Yeah,

1711
01:42:20,190 --> 01:42:21,970
right.
Well that's what we were doing today.

1712
01:42:21,971 --> 01:42:22,470
So,

1713
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:23,011
right.
But again,

1714
01:42:23,011 --> 01:42:28,011
the crucial bit is that in doing that,
I'm not making claims to knowledge about

1715
01:42:28,570 --> 01:42:32,040
the ethereal existence of archetypes.
There's no,

1716
01:42:32,060 --> 01:42:32,893
you know,
Akashic record or collective 

1717
01:42:34,261 --> 01:42:35,094
unconscious.
Yeah.

1718
01:42:35,220 --> 01:42:36,053
I'm not making claims that kind at all.
In order to find this way of thinking 

1719
01:42:39,931 --> 01:42:40,764
useful.
I'm not aligning myself with any 

1720
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:43,733
provincial tradition of mythmaking I e 
or religion and claiming that my 

1721
01:42:48,891 --> 01:42:52,110
religion is better than others,
which is,

1722
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:53,273
you know,
as we see every time we open the 

1723
01:42:53,851 --> 01:42:54,684
newspaper,
a divisive game that we have to figure 

1724
01:42:56,491 --> 01:42:58,120
out some way of unraveling.

1725
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,393
Right.
We do and mean your emphasis on 

1726
01:43:01,081 --> 01:43:01,914
clearheaded thinking.
I mean this is part of the reason why I 

1727
01:43:04,021 --> 01:43:04,854
wanted to talk to you.
I mean certainly one of the things that 

1728
01:43:07,991 --> 01:43:11,570
you demonstrated the first time we 
talked was your capacity for clearheaded

1729
01:43:11,650 --> 01:43:12,540
thinking.
I mean you're,

1730
01:43:12,910 --> 01:43:16,030
you're crazily incisive and laser 
focused and you know,

1731
01:43:16,031 --> 01:43:16,864
those are extraordinarily useful 
attributes and that's partly why I 

1732
01:43:19,641 --> 01:43:22,340
thought it would be so useful for us to 
have a conversation.

1733
01:43:22,370 --> 01:43:26,460
I'm an advocate of critical thinking.
We have to get this right.

1734
01:43:27,740 --> 01:43:32,300
Having said that,
the abandonment of all value structures,

1735
01:43:32,301 --> 01:43:33,134
which is say the postmodernist 
perspective isn't a way forward because 

1736
01:43:36,431 --> 01:43:39,190
it leads to,
it leads to a situation where people are

1737
01:43:39,191 --> 01:43:43,550
going to be unconsciously possessed by 
far more foolish ideas.

1738
01:43:43,551 --> 01:43:44,900
Then they left behind them.

1739
01:43:45,210 --> 01:43:46,043
You're certainly not getting that in me.
I'm not advocating that we abandoned 

1740
01:43:49,380 --> 01:43:51,770
value structure is there the contrary,
the value

1741
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:52,843
that we should have in hand perhaps 
before any other is the one you 

1742
01:43:56,361 --> 01:43:57,194
referenced earlier,
which is honesty on every level because 

1743
01:44:00,471 --> 01:44:03,410
it's the only thing when you're talking 
about honest speech,

1744
01:44:03,470 --> 01:44:04,303
it's the only thing that that allows us 
to course correct collectively is the 

1745
01:44:07,671 --> 01:44:10,280
only thing.
If you're going to lie to me,

1746
01:44:10,370 --> 01:44:14,930
then you are denying me your view of 
reality and in so far as you have a view

1747
01:44:14,931 --> 01:44:15,764
that can be useful to me.
We're now playing a game that is not at 

1748
01:44:18,921 --> 01:44:21,680
all optimized for course correction and 
so as a,

1749
01:44:21,681 --> 01:44:24,550
as a society we need to be,
and this is where you are,

1750
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:27,410
defensive free speech comes in and has 
been so useful.

1751
01:44:27,530 --> 01:44:31,190
We have to be committed to defending 
free speech.

1752
01:44:31,191 --> 01:44:32,024
However,
impolitic or unpopular or even wrong 

1753
01:44:35,660 --> 01:44:40,660
because defending that is the only 
barrier to in the limit violence because

1754
01:44:42,111 --> 01:44:42,944
the only way we can influence one 
another short of physical violence is 

1755
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,160
through speech,
through communicating ideas.

1756
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:51,830
And the moment you say certain ideas 
can't be communicated,

1757
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:52,873
you create a circumstance where people 
have no alternative but to go hands on 

1758
01:44:57,171 --> 01:44:57,951
you.
But again,

1759
01:44:57,951 --> 01:44:58,784
I'm not,
there's nothing in me that is echoing a 

1760
01:45:01,731 --> 01:45:02,564
postmodern relinquishment of a sense 
that there are right and wrong answers 

1761
01:45:06,771 --> 01:45:07,604
to the contrary.
I understand that and I'm certainly not 

1762
01:45:09,861 --> 01:45:14,090
assuming that you are in that camp or 
that you think that way.

1763
01:45:14,110 --> 01:45:17,390
It's quite clear to me that you don't 
say I'm getting tired.

1764
01:45:17,391 --> 01:45:19,730
I kind of to just say one more thing.
Sure.

1765
01:45:20,150 --> 01:45:20,721
Okay.
With you.

1766
01:45:20,721 --> 01:45:24,260
Well,
it has to do with this course correction

1767
01:45:24,261 --> 01:45:25,094
idea,
so I'm going to perhaps leave you with 

1768
01:45:26,751 --> 01:45:29,870
another architectural idea that you can 
show on if you want.

1769
01:45:29,871 --> 01:45:34,250
So there's an idea that's paramount in 
Christianity,

1770
01:45:34,700 --> 01:45:37,490
which is a creed I understand better 
than most,

1771
01:45:38,210 --> 01:45:40,820
mostly as a consequence of my 
educational history.

1772
01:45:40,870 --> 01:45:41,703
But the idea,
there's a very weird idea and not in 

1773
01:45:44,001 --> 01:45:49,001
that is that at the beginning of time 
God spoke order out of chaos.

1774
01:45:50,751 --> 01:45:51,584
The chaos was like a potential and that 
it was the act of speaking truthfully 

1775
01:45:56,241 --> 01:45:57,074
that brought forth the proper kind of 
order and that was the paradise will 

1776
01:46:00,081 --> 01:46:03,860
order that Adam and eve in habit.
And so there's this deep idea lurking in

1777
01:46:03,861 --> 01:46:04,694
there that was drawn from many sources 
that this spoken truth is what 

1778
01:46:08,031 --> 01:46:11,780
transforms chaotic potential into 
habitable orders.

1779
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:13,513
And then weirdly enough,
what happened with that idea over the 

1780
01:46:16,221 --> 01:46:17,054
period of about 3000 years as 
Christianity emerged from Judaism was 

1781
01:46:20,331 --> 01:46:21,164
that by the time Christianity emerged,
there was an insistence that Christ was 

1782
01:46:25,761 --> 01:46:26,594
the word that God used at the beginning 
of time to extract habitable order from 

1783
01:46:31,461 --> 01:46:33,500
chaos.
And so the idea there,

1784
01:46:33,501 --> 01:46:34,334
it's,
it's one of the most brilliant ideas of 

1785
01:46:35,391 --> 01:46:36,224
mankind is that by speaking the truth,
you've faced the chaos of potential and 

1786
01:46:42,921 --> 01:46:43,754
bring forth the most benevolent possible
type of ordered combined with that 

1787
01:46:48,591 --> 01:46:50,470
course that you're describing.

1788
01:46:51,020 --> 01:46:53,420
And I think that's the central idea of 
the West.

1789
01:46:54,410 --> 01:46:55,243
No.
You can find that idea echoed in other 

1790
01:46:57,010 --> 01:47:01,000
areas like in Buddhism for example,
and in other religions for that matter,

1791
01:47:01,001 --> 01:47:01,834
but I believe that it reached it's 
highest in logistics development at 

1792
01:47:05,601 --> 01:47:06,434
least as far as I can tell in the west.
And that's also why we have societies 

1793
01:47:09,771 --> 01:47:14,771
that are predicated on the sacredness,
so to speak of the spoken truth.

1794
01:47:15,470 --> 01:47:16,303
Yeah.
The question of why we value the spoken 

1795
01:47:19,891 --> 01:47:23,090
truth to the degree that we do is an 
interesting one.

1796
01:47:23,091 --> 01:47:25,590
I think it's largely,
yes it is.

1797
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:26,433
It has as much to do with a reaction 
against western religion by science and 

1798
01:47:30,861 --> 01:47:35,720
philosophy as it does with anything that
came from western religion,

1799
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:37,760
but I think it,
you know,

1800
01:47:37,761 --> 01:47:38,594
it,
it is something that is unraveling in 

1801
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:42,633
the strangest of places now.
So it's in so far as you and I can make 

1802
01:47:46,041 --> 01:47:51,041
common cause defending the necessity of 
protecting free speech across the board,

1803
01:47:51,881 --> 01:47:54,210
however unpopular.
I think practically speaking,

1804
01:47:54,530 --> 01:47:56,240
that's an extraordinarily useful thing 
to do.

1805
01:47:56,390 --> 01:47:57,223
Yes,
well that's the best way at the moment 

1806
01:47:58,431 --> 01:48:00,740
that we can slay our respective dragons.

1807
01:48:01,460 --> 01:48:02,293
Well listen Jordan,
it's a pleasure to talk to a second 

1808
01:48:04,601 --> 01:48:05,434
time.
I hope people found something of value 

1809
01:48:08,771 --> 01:48:09,604
in it.
You would never imagine we disagreed as 

1810
01:48:11,531 --> 01:48:12,364
much as we did the first time around.
If you only heard this second 

1811
01:48:14,381 --> 01:48:15,214
conversation.

1812
01:48:15,470 --> 01:48:17,870
Yeah,
well sometimes it's sometimes some,

1813
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:20,630
some stupid persistence is useful and 
you know,

1814
01:48:20,660 --> 01:48:24,050
I think the rabbit hole we went down,
it was an interesting one.

1815
01:48:24,051 --> 01:48:26,760
Even though it was painful and perhaps

1816
01:48:27,290 --> 01:48:28,010
luck,

1817
01:48:28,010 --> 01:48:31,070
it was productive because it got us to 
the second conversation.

1818
01:48:31,820 --> 01:48:33,770
Hurray for that.
And like if you,

1819
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:34,730
if you

1820
01:48:34,730 --> 01:48:37,790
feel inclined at some point to speak in 
the future with me,

1821
01:48:38,140 --> 01:48:40,690
we'll see how people respond to this.
But you know,

1822
01:48:40,700 --> 01:48:43,650
I found the conversation very useful and
harrain for that.

1823
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:44,690
Yeah,
well listen,

1824
01:48:44,691 --> 01:48:48,860
so I will invite people to respond yet 
again as I did the first time.

1825
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:52,630
I think you and I both pay attention to 
twitter.

1826
01:48:52,910 --> 01:48:53,743
At least I pay attention to twitter 
really exclusively in terms of social 

1827
01:48:56,791 --> 01:48:57,920
media.
So yeah,

1828
01:48:57,921 --> 01:48:58,754
me too.
Pretty much twitter is a good place to 

1829
01:48:59,991 --> 01:49:03,670
make noise at us.
We have these kinds of conversations for

1830
01:49:03,671 --> 01:49:05,000
you guys.
This is,

1831
01:49:05,001 --> 01:49:07,460
I said the first time around this you 
Jordan,

1832
01:49:07,461 --> 01:49:11,200
where my most requested guest vibe,
a factor of,

1833
01:49:11,201 --> 01:49:12,034
I don't know what,
but it was remarkable how many people 

1834
01:49:14,250 --> 01:49:18,010
wanted us to talk.
So we've now done it a second time.

1835
01:49:18,011 --> 01:49:19,780
And um,
listen,

1836
01:49:19,781 --> 01:49:20,614
it's a pleasure and I wish you the best 
of luck with your entanglements with 

1837
01:49:23,691 --> 01:49:27,130
crazy bureaucracies and everything else 
here doing because you're,

1838
01:49:27,330 --> 01:49:28,163
you are on the front lines of a certain 
kind of culture war and it can't be 

1839
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:32,193
easy.
I know it must be stressful and I just 

1840
01:49:34,061 --> 01:49:35,230
wish you the best with all of it.

1841
01:49:35,750 --> 01:49:37,570
Thanks Sam.
Much appreciated.

1842
01:49:38,230 --> 01:49:39,280
