1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,320
Hi everyone.
Happy New Year.

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:05,933
I've got some things to say to junior 
high and high school students and their 

3
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:10,134
parents about the politicization that is
occurring in the public school system 

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,490
and what should be done about that.
I have some very radical suggestions,

5
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,070
I would say,
which I am not putting forth lightly.

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,493
I think that it is time for public 
school students and their parents to 

7
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:29,514
actively rebel against the 
indoctrination that is being offered in 

8
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:33,834
the guise of education.
But before such a recommendation can be 

9
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:41,100
reasonably offered or considered by its 
recipients.

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,480
Some careful argumentation and review of
recent events is in order,

11
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,010
so please bear with me while I walk 
through that process.

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,150
It's important to get these things right
and not to rush.

13
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,560
About a year ago,
actually on September 27th,

14
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:01,463
2016 I made a series of videos.
One of them criticized a new piece of 

15
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:10,480
federal legislation.
Bill see 16 bill [inaudible] is,

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,333
and I'm reading this directly from the 
government website and act to amend the 

17
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,580
Canadian Human Rights Act and the 
criminal code.

18
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,470
Here's the summary.
This enactment amends the Canadian Human

19
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:23,304
Rights Act.
To add gender identity and gender 

20
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:28,200
expression to the list of prohibited 
grounds of discrimination.

21
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:29,843
The enactment also amends the criminal 
code to extend the protection against 

22
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:33,864
hate propaganda set out in that act to 
any section of the public that is 

23
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:38,934
distinguished by gender identity or 
expression and to clearly set out that 

24
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:46,770
evidence that an offense was motivated 
by bias,

25
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,873
prejudice or hate based on gender 
identity or expression constitutes an 

26
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:52,614
aggravating circumstance that a court 
must take into consideration when it 

27
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:56,814
imposes a sentence.
Now you may notice on careful reading 

28
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,420
that the act modifies the criminal code 
to clearly set out that evidence that an

29
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:12,141
old fence was motivated by bias.
Prejudice or hate extends the purview of

30
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:17,070
what might constitute hate to a degree.
That's I think completely unacceptable,

31
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:19,650
but that's the least of the problems 
with this bill.

32
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,980
You can't really tell what the other 
problems are though,

33
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:23,814
unless you go read the policy guidelines
that were established by the Ontario 

34
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,553
Human Rights Commission,
which already guide interpretation of 

35
00:02:29,731 --> 00:02:30,564
similar legislation in Ontario and would
be used by the federal government's own 

36
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:37,210
admission to guide the interpretation of
Bill [inaudible].

37
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,210
Now.
When I made the videos,

38
00:02:39,211 --> 00:02:40,044
I said as much,
I said that there were two fundamental 

39
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:43,044
dangers to this bill.
One was that because of the Ontario 

40
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:51,920
Human Rights Commission is a radical and
dangerous organization bent on producing

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,833
the most punitive possible policies in 
the pursuit of its radical neo Marxist 

42
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,390
postmodern agenda,
that the legislation would introduce the

43
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:05,224
possibility of persecution or let's say 
prosecution for so-called offenses that 

44
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:14,560
should never be considered within the 
proper domain of legal prosecution.

45
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,453
Now,
I also objected to the manner in which 

46
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,280
the relationship between biological sex,
gender identity,

47
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:22,114
gender expression,
and sexual orientation was written into 

48
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:25,654
the Ontario Human Rights Commission's 
policies and therefore essentially into 

49
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:28,954
the law pointing out that the law now 
demands that we consider those four 

50
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:33,843
different phenomena as essentially 
independent when they are in fact very 

51
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:38,254
tightly causally linked and as well that
the claim that's being made both 

52
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:47,260
implicit and explicit,
that those four sets of phenomena differ

53
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,560
within each strata as a consequence of 
socialization,

54
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:51,394
in fact is also wrong,
but also undermines the primary 

55
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:54,874
arguments that transsexual people and 
gay people used to buttress the reality 

56
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:01,630
of the our identity.

57
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,553
Namely that they have a biological 
proclivity that directs them towards 

58
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,290
such identities,
expressions,

59
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,124
and orientations.
I pointed all of those things out and 

60
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:12,604
that we were in danger of legislating 
compelled speech in relationship to 

61
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:16,654
preferred pronouns,
which are the pronouns that people who 

62
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:19,804
vary in their gender identity 
hypothetically want to use to be 

63
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:23,134
referred to.
I pointed out that we were in danger of 

64
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:29,080
making compelled speech,
something required in Canada so that for

65
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:32,260
the first time in our history and in the
history of the British common law,

66
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,350
the government would be able to 
legislate the content of your speech,

67
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:38,440
which is quite different than 
legislating what you can't say,

68
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,780
which is already something that's very 
dangerous.

69
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:44,290
There were a variety of consequences of 
making this video,

70
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,560
which were much more dramatic than I 
presume they might be.

71
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,783
Although I did know that bill 
[inaudible] posed to genuine threat to 

72
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:53,470
the integrity of our state.

73
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,663
Now,
the first consequence was that a very 

74
00:04:56,531 --> 00:05:00,790
large number of faculty members at the 
University of Toronto decided that I had

75
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:05,791
made the campus an unsafe place by my 
statements and petitioned the university

76
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:07,564
to do something about that.
And then there were a number of 

77
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:10,204
demonstrations and then the University 
of Toronto sent me two letters telling 

78
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:17,410
me that I was violating their policies 
and probably the law in Ontario,

79
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,930
which was something I had warned about 
by the way,

80
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:20,764
because the law was written in such a 
dismal manner and over inclusive manner 

81
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:30,031
to ensure that even criticizing it could
be prosecuted under its guidelines let's

82
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:30,994
say,
and then there was a debate that the 

83
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:33,904
university held were defenders of bill 
see 16 insisted that I was all the 

84
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:39,064
terrible things that I had been called 
and that I was misinterpreting the bill 

85
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,174
and that the dangers that I forced saw 
as a consequence of its implementation 

86
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,320
would never manifest themselves,
sorry,

87
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,413
rather than to address himself to the 
scientific evidence concerning gender 

88
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:54,454
identity and expression and by adopting 
rhetorical strategies more common to 

89
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:03,620
Breitbart news.com then a university 
professors lecture,

90
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,813
Dr. Peterson goes on to discredit the 
very construct on political grounds 

91
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,270
instead of on grounds provided by 
scholarly evidence that these constructs

92
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,104
are in no particular order leftist 
radical and politically correct on the 

93
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:23,930
subject of pronouns and gender 
expression.

94
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,870
Dr. Peterson is emphatic.
That quote,

95
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,003
I don't recognize another person's right
to determine what pronouns I use to 

96
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,474
address them.
I won't do it for the vast majority of 

97
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:36,584
people.
He goes on to say gender identity and 

98
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:43,070
sexual orientation and I guess he means 
sex are the same thing.

99
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,730
And quote as for the definition of 
transgender,

100
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,760
Dr. Peterson claims that,
and I quote,

101
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,420
I don't believe that they,
these people,

102
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,463
these terms stand for good things.
I think that these people use these 

103
00:06:58,551 --> 00:06:59,384
terms as a pretense that they stand for 
good things as a pretext for them to 

104
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:08,720
continue their nefarious activities and 
quote,

105
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:14,270
well this is hardly the stuff of 
academic scholarship

106
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,360
now and I should say to the university's
credit by the way,

107
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:22,070
that once they got on their feet after 
sending me the original two letters,

108
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,173
they seem to have come down quite 
strongly on the side of free speech in 

109
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:26,534
the last year.
And so that's something positive that's 

110
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:28,964
come out of all this.
But the truth of the matter was that I 

111
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:33,884
am none of those things and that I had 
read the bill and it's surrounding 

112
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:38,594
policies extremely carefully and what's 
worse actually understood them and that 

113
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:42,914
what I had done was merely communicate 
my understanding and I would say my 

114
00:07:46,191 --> 00:07:50,210
proper and accurate understanding of the
bill to a public that was actually quite

115
00:07:50,211 --> 00:07:54,500
willing to take the time to investigate 
the issue and follow it carefully.

116
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,310
The press initially was very ambivalent 
towards me,

117
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,790
but as some of the leading journalists 
in Canada,

118
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,893
including Christie Blatchford and aunt 
anella are too so and eventually conrad 

119
00:08:06,561 --> 00:08:07,394
black and also Margaret Winter early 
listened to the videos that I had made 

120
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,550
it and then actually read the policies 
in question.

121
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,080
They understood that the bill did it in 
fact pose a threat to free speech in the

122
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,980
manner that I had described and came out
very strongly on my side.

123
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,253
Now I have some sympathy for the fact 
that I was tarred with a variety of 

124
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:28,394
epithets immediately after having made 
the video because I was warning that 

125
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:32,954
there was something not good going on in
Canada and whenever anybody warrants 

126
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:37,664
that you should be skeptical of them 
because Canada has been a very stable 

127
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,640
and well functioning state for a very 
long period of time.

128
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:46,820
So when someone pops out of his rabbit 
hole or it comes out of the swamp,

129
00:08:46,821 --> 00:08:50,450
let's say,
and says there's something rotten in the

130
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:52,610
state of Denmark,
the proper response is,

131
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:53,444
no,
there's probably something wrong with 

132
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:55,064
you.
And the next investigative strategy is 

133
00:08:57,961 --> 00:08:58,621
to say,
well,

134
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,454
here's a bunch of things that are 
typically wrong with people that have 

135
00:09:01,861 --> 00:09:03,660
something wrong with them,
bigoted,

136
00:09:03,661 --> 00:09:05,070
transphobic,
racist,

137
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:05,904
et Cetera.

138
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,893
Maybe you're one of those things.
And so we'll throw those at you and see 

139
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:11,310
if they stick.
Because if they stick,

140
00:09:11,311 --> 00:09:12,144
then we don't have to pay any attention 
to the problem and maybe it will go 

141
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:15,264
away.
But the truth of the matter is that I 

142
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,144
was and am none of those things.
I was fortunate because there was 

143
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:21,894
evidence that that was the case.
I have videotaped virtually everything 

144
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:29,340
I've said to students in the entire 25 
years of my university tenure.

145
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:34,730
And so everything that I thought was a 
matter of public record and I had posted

146
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:38,280
it on youtube in the form of hundreds of
lectures.

147
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,263
Not only is there nothing scurrilous and
self damning in those videos is quite 

148
00:09:43,171 --> 00:09:44,004
the contrary.
People have found the content extremely 

149
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:48,720
useful from a psychological perspective 
and,

150
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,060
and that's now up into the millions of 
people.

151
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:51,894
And so it turns out that I'm not the bad
guy of the supporters of this bill's 

152
00:09:55,771 --> 00:09:56,670
imagination.

153
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:57,683
Now the other tactic employed by the 
people who have been unhappy about what 

154
00:10:02,371 --> 00:10:07,371
I have been saying is to assume that I'm
an alt right or even a far right figure,

155
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,174
which is an accusation that has been 
leveled at me many times in the last 

156
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,840
year.
And there's also a reason for that.

157
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,033
The reason for that is that the group of
people to the right of the radical left 

158
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,323
is a very large group and it includes 
everyone from socialists say of the 

159
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:25,614
classic 1970s type all the way to the 
most far right Nazis imaginable who are 

160
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:30,624
all united in their opposition to the 
radical left agenda and thus form what 

161
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,250
you might describe as a group by 
default.

162
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,503
Now the fact that some of the members of
a group by default are unsavory 

163
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:44,934
characters,
does not demonstrate that all of the 

164
00:10:47,131 --> 00:10:49,560
members of that group are of that type.

165
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:54,480
Now it's very convenient for the radical
left and much more straight forward than

166
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:55,314
actually formulating arguments to assume
that everyone who doesn't think exactly 

167
00:10:58,861 --> 00:11:01,710
what they think is some sort of 
monstrous figure,

168
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,810
but it happens to not be the case.
There are many reasonable people,

169
00:11:06,811 --> 00:11:07,644
in fact a vast majority of reasonable 
people who are firmly opposed to the 

170
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:11,274
agenda of the radical left and it's 
completely unreasonable to lump them in 

171
00:11:14,371 --> 00:11:17,910
with outright far right and not see type
figures.

172
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:22,740
Part of the reason that the postmodern 
neo Marxist find themselves compelled to

173
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:23,574
do so is because they believe that they 
are correct and that they have right on 

174
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:28,374
their side.
And if it turns out that anyone 

175
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:31,704
reasonable is objecting,
then the fact of that reasonable 

176
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:37,650
opposition would make it necessary for 
some things to be rethought.

177
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,813
And so it's much easier.
And I would also say much more 

178
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:41,784
gratifying to an inner sense of 
resentment and vengefulness to merely 

179
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,100
tar everyone who doesn't agree with the 
same brush.

180
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:50,933
And the argument be damned.
This brings us to the most fundamental 

181
00:11:55,961 --> 00:11:56,794
reason why there has been such 
vociferous opposition generated in 

182
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:02,104
relationship to what I've been saying.
And that's because I got the 

183
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:06,514
interpretation of bill see 16 and its 
surrounding policies and the pernicious 

184
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:15,550
postmodern Neil Marxist doctrine that 
gave rise to it essentially correct.

185
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,510
And it's in the best interest of those 
who are pushing this pernicious doctrine

186
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:20,344
and its legislative consequences to do 
everything possible to discredit me so 

187
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:24,754
that the facts of the matter remain 
hidden from the general public and 

188
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:32,260
perhaps even from those who have 
formulated the doctrine themselves.

189
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:33,603
So I read bill [inaudible] and the 
surrounding policies that would guide 

190
00:12:37,211 --> 00:12:41,590
it's interpretation as formulated by the
Ontario Human Rights Commission.

191
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:42,933
And then I informed the public to the 
best of my ability about the content of 

192
00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:49,720
that legislation and policies and its 
intent.

193
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,810
And we've outlined the consequences.

194
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,920
Two major questions remain is what I had
to say to be trusted.

195
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,060
And if I was correct in my analysis and 
diagnosis,

196
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,300
what steps should be taken now,
if any,

197
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,313
to rectify the situation.
So let's begin with the question of 

198
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:15,490
whether or not my interpretation is to 
be trusted.

199
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:20,020
And we'll start that with a brief 
overview.

200
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,430
And then an analysis of the recent 
events at Wilfrid laurier university.

201
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,223
As you may know or may not know,
but should know at Wilfrid laurier 

202
00:13:29,831 --> 00:13:31,000
university.
Recently,

203
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:31,834
a teaching assistant named Lindsay 
Shepherd found herself in hot water 

204
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,183
because she had the temerity to play a 
video clip from TV shows the agenda in 

205
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:42,394
the class that she was charged with 
conducting as a consequence of playing 

206
00:13:46,031 --> 00:13:46,864
the video clip,
she was brought in front of a 

207
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,790
disciplinary panel consisting of three 
individuals,

208
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,893
Nathan Ramboo,
Canna Herbert Pimlott and Adriana Joel 

209
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,113
ramboo counter and Pimlott our 
professors in the communications 

210
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:01,924
department at Wilfrid Laurier University
and Andrea Joel is an administrator who 

211
00:14:05,861 --> 00:14:10,300
was hired as a consequence of 
legislation introduced by Kathleen Wynne

212
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,553
to conduct exactly the sort of 
disciplinary investigation that she sat 

213
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,970
in on.
Now Lindsay Shepherd had the presence of

214
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:23,971
mind and the fear to tape the 
disciplinary hearing and after the story

215
00:14:27,251 --> 00:14:28,084
about what had happened was released,
Lindsey released the entire audio tape 

216
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:33,963
and caused a national and international 
scandal and would be interested to see 

217
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:41,950
the original complaint or complaints 
because I don't really have any context.

218
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,540
What exactly that problem ones.
Sorry,

219
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,050
can I,
sorry.

220
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:51,890
Can I just ask anything to maybe just 
provide us with full frame?

221
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,813
Sorry,
one.

222
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,673
Yeah,
I just like to hear the whole like your 

223
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,050
what,
what,

224
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,750
what,
what took place.

225
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,200
So if you could just give us the whole 
story and then,

226
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:03,230
and then,
sorry,

227
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,410
I just feel that because I'm just 
sitting in the night.

228
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,330
Yeah.
Okay.

229
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:09,164
So,
um,

230
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,210
we,
we have to teach about grammar.

231
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,433
And in the Pearson book there was a 
section about pronouns and using like 

232
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,340
gendered language.
So I wanted to make it more engaging.

233
00:15:19,341 --> 00:15:22,400
So what I did is we were talking about,
um,

234
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,250
in paper is using,
say as,

235
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,173
as like a singular,
and then we're also talking about like 

236
00:15:28,731 --> 00:15:31,340
his and hers and like how to construct 
sentences with that.

237
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:36,260
And then to contextualize it,
I brought up like a youtube debate,

238
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:39,080
so debate with both sides during 
Peterson sides.

239
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:40,970
And this,
this fellow named Nicolas Matt,

240
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:42,170
who was also a prophet.
Uft.

241
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,550
Okay.
And they,

242
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:45,510
you don't have the name of the video.
Um,

243
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,110
it was from the agenda with Steve Pagan,

244
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,090
what's in a name,
potentially a great deal.

245
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,840
University of Toronto,
psychology professor Jordan Peterson has

246
00:15:55,841 --> 00:15:56,674
a fight on his hands after objecting to 
proposed legislation that he says would 

247
00:16:00,191 --> 00:16:01,024
violate his freedom of speech by forcing
him to address transgendered people 

248
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:05,523
using the pronouns of their choosing.
Joining us now to better understand the 

249
00:16:08,711 --> 00:16:12,070
issue and debate what's at stake in 
Vancouver,

250
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:12,904
British Columbia,
Sarah and Meyer transgender pundit and 

251
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,580
Utuber in the nation's capitol.
Kyle Kirkup,

252
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,450
professor of law at the University of 
Ottawa and here in studio,

253
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,740
the aforementioned Jordan Peterson 
professors,

254
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,560
psychology,
University of Toronto,

255
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,730
Nicolas,
Matt,

256
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,620
lecturer,
transgender studies,

257
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:34,060
a u of t and Mary Rogan,
who's article entitled growing up trends

258
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:37,300
is featured in the October issue of the 
Walrus magazine.

259
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,480
Good to have you three here and our two 
friends and points beyond.

260
00:16:40,481 --> 00:16:41,314
We appreciate everybody being on the 
program for what is I think one of the 

261
00:16:44,111 --> 00:16:46,480
hottest topics in the country today.
Professor Peterson,

262
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:47,314
and it's all because of you.
And I think before we go any further 

263
00:16:50,681 --> 00:16:55,060
with our conversation here,
I want to give people a sense of how hot

264
00:16:55,061 --> 00:16:59,890
this has got.
A starting on the downtown campus or the

265
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:00,723
University of Toronto.

266
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:08,663
Well as you can see that you're honored.
Some free speech are capable of making 

267
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,303
the lords the brine articulately noise 
free speech mechanism by which we keep 

268
00:17:17,051 --> 00:17:20,660
our society functioning.
By doing this,

269
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,110
I'm going to post this online that you 
would like people to not to be,

270
00:17:32,111 --> 00:17:36,130
to be more accommodating of trans people
and people of color at your events.

271
00:17:36,131 --> 00:17:37,910
In future.
I would a person of color.

272
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,540
I'm a person of color and I felt very 
accommodating here.

273
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,240
There had been multiple,
multiple recorded instances.

274
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:45,400
I'm trans people killing themselves,
right?

275
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,210
Because,
because they are,

276
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,530
because they are not being integrated 
into society.

277
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,590
If it wasn't for this long,
I asked you to refer to me.

278
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,383
What'd you do?
Why do you have the authority to 

279
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:59,910
determine whether or not an individual 
is worthy of you using their pronouns?

280
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:01,523
Like if I asked you,
would you please use they them pronouns 

281
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,190
for me?
What?

282
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,520
What do you want us to jump through?
Those are my pronouns.

283
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,970
Okay.
With um,

284
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,940
indulgence of everybody else on the 
program.

285
00:18:12,941 --> 00:18:13,774
I'm going to start with Professor 
Peterson off the top here for a while 

286
00:18:15,401 --> 00:18:19,960
because as I suggested you thought long 
and hard about this,

287
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,980
you posted a few things up to youtube,
uh,

288
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,260
because you had been thinking long and 
hard about it.

289
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,160
One and a half million hits later,
Jordan,

290
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,260
one and a half million,
it's later.

291
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:35,680
This has become a huge issue.
So let's start there.

292
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,160
Why did you post those views to youtube 
in the first place?

293
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:42,950
Well,
there's proximate and distal reasons.

294
00:18:42,951 --> 00:18:46,310
The proximate reasons was because I 
received some correspondence from,

295
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,533
from,
uh,

296
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:51,220
from clients of mine who had been,
um,

297
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:52,783
I would say persecuted in a variety of 
ways by people who were politically 

298
00:18:56,151 --> 00:18:56,984
correct.
And they sent me some documentation 

299
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:00,884
about bill [inaudible] 16 and the 
associated policy statements on the 

300
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,473
Ontario Human Rights Commission,
which I read and was not very happy 

301
00:19:08,031 --> 00:19:08,960
about.
Um,

302
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,273
and also because the University of 
Toronto decided to make anti racism and 

303
00:19:13,671 --> 00:19:14,504
anti bias training,
so called anti racism and anti bias 

304
00:19:16,611 --> 00:19:17,444
training mandatory,
which are regarded as an inappropriate 

305
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,313
incursion into the domain of political 
opinion by the university 

306
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:26,210
administration.
Have you taken that training yet?

307
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,680
No,
and I don't have to.

308
00:19:27,681 --> 00:19:28,300
Yeah,
it's,

309
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,133
it's the HR department personnel that 
have to take it if they decide that you 

310
00:19:32,001 --> 00:19:32,834
have to,
will you?

311
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,880
No Way.
Not a chance.

312
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,010
And what's the other,
you referred to persecution that friends

313
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:39,420
are clients of yours had experienced,
so yeah.

314
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,303
Yeah.
Well,

315
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,173
um,
there are lots of places now where the 

316
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:46,640
workplace has become,
I would say excessively politicized.

317
00:19:46,641 --> 00:19:49,700
And so people who have viewpoints,
and this also involves,

318
00:19:49,701 --> 00:19:50,534
includes,
I would say fairly radical leftist view 

319
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:55,880
points.
People don't feel comfortable at all in,

320
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:56,743
in,
in being able to use the language of 

321
00:19:57,951 --> 00:19:58,784
their choice or to have even no opinions
about a variety of different things 

322
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,593
essentially.
I guess what I'm asking you is to lay 

323
00:20:03,591 --> 00:20:05,930
the case out.
What is it you find offensive about this

324
00:20:05,931 --> 00:20:07,160
legislation?
Well,

325
00:20:07,161 --> 00:20:07,994
fundamentally the,
there were two things that really 

326
00:20:09,411 --> 00:20:10,244
bothered me,
although there have been other things 

327
00:20:11,181 --> 00:20:12,014
I've thought about since.
One was that I was being asked as 

328
00:20:14,931 --> 00:20:18,530
everyone is to use a certain set of 
words that I think are the constructions

329
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:21,120
of people who have a political ideology 
that I don't believe in,

330
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,150
that I also regard is as dangerous.

331
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,013
What are those words?
Those are the made up words to read 

332
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,490
that,
that people now describe as um,

333
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,030
as gender neutral.
And so to me,

334
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:32,864
they're there.
They're there an attempt to control 

335
00:20:35,481 --> 00:20:36,314
language and,
and in a direction that isn't happening 

336
00:20:39,051 --> 00:20:40,820
organically.
It's not happening naturally.

337
00:20:40,821 --> 00:20:41,654
People aren't picking up these words in 
the typical way that new words are 

338
00:20:44,001 --> 00:20:46,770
picked up,
but by force and by FIA 10,

339
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:49,600
I would say by force,
because there's legislative power behind

340
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:51,640
them.
Like these made up words,

341
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,740
xe and Zer and that sort of thing.
What about,

342
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:57,430
they're not all made up where it,
quote unquote made up words for example,

343
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,690
they is one of them.
Yeah.

344
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,760
But we speak to an individual as they,
right.

345
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:03,970
But we can't dispense with the 
distinction between singular and plural.

346
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,833
I mean,
I know that the advocates of that 

347
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,514
particular approach say that they has 
been used forever as a singular and 

348
00:21:09,071 --> 00:21:10,300
that's actually not correct.

349
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:13,480
It's used as a singular in very 
exceptional circumstances.

350
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,550
So we understand your views and where 
you're coming from.

351
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:16,683
Uh,
you decided to lay these views out in 

352
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:21,820
some youtube discourses.
Yes.

353
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,340
You put them up,
the response has been overwhelming.

354
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,710
Did you anticipate that you would get 
this kind of feedback?

355
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:27,843
No,
there was no way of anticipating this 

356
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:30,790
and I think you mentioned in the Intro,
you know,

357
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:34,570
that this is a consequence of what I've 
done and I don't think that's true.

358
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,300
It's a,
it's a consequence of the fact I thought

359
00:21:37,301 --> 00:21:39,250
about it then.
I think the right metaphor is that,

360
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,773
you know,
there's a large forest and it's been a 

361
00:21:42,461 --> 00:21:43,294
hot,
dry summer or maybe a drought and 

362
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:45,934
there's plenty of deadwood gathered and 
I lit a spark and you can't blame the 

363
00:21:49,181 --> 00:21:50,014
forest fire on the spark.
There is out there an appetite against 

364
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:55,090
political correctness,
which is what you have described.

365
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:55,923
This says in fact your youtube videos 
called professor against political 

366
00:21:58,301 --> 00:21:59,134
correctness.
But let's make sure we're all speaking 

367
00:22:00,491 --> 00:22:02,470
the same language here.
You would define that,

368
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:05,290
how political correctness,
well,

369
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:08,860
I think it's a particular kind of 
ideological game and I think the outcome

370
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:09,694
is two fold.
It's to make the player feel morally 

371
00:22:11,171 --> 00:22:12,004
superior and also to take rather serious
acts swings at the foundation of 

372
00:22:17,381 --> 00:22:18,214
society.
And so the game is identify a domain of 

373
00:22:20,981 --> 00:22:21,814
human endeavor.
Note that there's a distribution of 

374
00:22:24,281 --> 00:22:25,114
success.
Some people are doing comparatively 

375
00:22:26,591 --> 00:22:28,630
better and some people are doing 
comparatively worse.

376
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,123
Define those doing worse as victims.
Define those doing better as 

377
00:22:33,431 --> 00:22:36,430
perpetrators.
Identify with the victims,

378
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,630
have yourself a set of enemies handy to 
vent your resentment on.

379
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:44,410
Feel good about it even though it didn't
really require any work on your part.

380
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,513
And then endlessly repeat.
And let's do one more question here and 

381
00:22:48,131 --> 00:22:49,870
then we'll get everybody else into the 
conversation.

382
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,480
You know,
of course that since this story broke,

383
00:22:52,481 --> 00:22:54,400
you've been called a lot of things.
Yeah.

384
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:57,180
Um,
one of which is a trans phobe.

385
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:00,010
Yeah.
Some people have accused you of um,

386
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,730
using the free speech issue to mask 
what's really going on here,

387
00:23:03,731 --> 00:23:04,564
which is an attempt to deprive other 
people of what they believe are their 

388
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:08,973
legitimate rights.
Well I know when to give you the 

389
00:23:10,031 --> 00:23:10,864
opportunity to speak to whether or not 
you are a trans phobe well I can tell 

390
00:23:13,421 --> 00:23:14,254
you that I've received more letters from
transsexual people supporting me then 

391
00:23:17,051 --> 00:23:17,884
opposing me and I never said anything 
really about transsexual people about 

392
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:23,470
their existence.
Although that was the first thing that I

393
00:23:23,471 --> 00:23:24,304
was accused of doing.
I didn't say that transsexual people 

394
00:23:26,981 --> 00:23:29,380
didn't exist.
I said that gender identity,

395
00:23:29,381 --> 00:23:33,010
gender expression and biological sex do 
not vary independently,

396
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,023
which they don't.
And so this issue is in some sense only 

397
00:23:37,331 --> 00:23:40,870
peripherally about about transsexual 
issues.

398
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:46,080
It's more centrally about gender issues.
And then on top of it's the biggest

399
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:48,510
issue is is that it's a free speech 
issue.

400
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,613
Okay.
Let us continue to explore all of those 

401
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,770
issues that you have just raised.
And um,

402
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,430
what do we do this,
let's take a moment.

403
00:23:56,431 --> 00:23:58,170
We're going to explain a few basic 
things here.

404
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,363
The issue of so called non traditional 
pronouns goes together with non 

405
00:24:01,461 --> 00:24:04,500
traditional gender identities.
New York City for example,

406
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:09,810
recognizes 31 such gender expressions.
In other words besides man and woman,

407
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:13,650
there are 29 other gender expressions.
For example,

408
00:24:13,651 --> 00:24:15,120
Penn Gender Queer,
gender,

409
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:15,954
gender fluid,
crossdresser by gendered gender blender 

410
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,850
and the list goes on.
And Nicholas,

411
00:24:20,851 --> 00:24:24,150
this is where I want to bring you in the
discussion because you teach this,

412
00:24:24,151 --> 00:24:24,984
you teach trans studies.
So if you would give us a brief primer 

413
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:28,973
on so many gender identities that in 
your view require non traditional 

414
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,880
pronouns.
Basically

415
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,440
not correct that there is such a thing 
as biological sex and I'm a historian of

416
00:24:41,441 --> 00:24:42,274
medicine,
I can unpack that for you at great 

417
00:24:43,931 --> 00:24:46,900
length if you want,
but in the interest of time I won't.

418
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:50,920
So that's a very popular misconceptions.
It was like a youtube debate.

419
00:24:50,921 --> 00:24:54,010
It was one hour long but I showed about 
five minutes and then some,

420
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,470
I mean the students were,
were very interested.

421
00:24:56,471 --> 00:24:58,450
I could tell they're all of their eyes 
were on the screen.

422
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,870
And after when we had a debate,
there were people of all opinions.

423
00:25:01,871 --> 00:25:04,330
And like from,
from what I could see,

424
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,220
it was a very friendly debate.
Um,

425
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:09,550
obviously this person who had an issue 
did not express it to me.

426
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,910
They just went straight to whoever.
I don't,

427
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:13,900
I don't really know what happened.

428
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,420
So,
um,

429
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:19,500
just for some additional context.
So you come,

430
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,540
you came from uft,
is that right?

431
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,310
No,
no.

432
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,143
You,
oh,

433
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,450
you mess up.
You,

434
00:25:24,451 --> 00:25:25,290
okay.
So you weren't,

435
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,220
um,
like one of Jordan Peterson,

436
00:25:27,221 --> 00:25:29,250
the students know.
Um,

437
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:33,000
so just to give you some context though,
Jordan Peterson is,

438
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,120
he is a,
a figure that's uh,

439
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,750
basically highly involved with the,
with the alt right.

440
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,160
He lectures about,
um,

441
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:47,070
basically like critiquing of feminism,
critiquing,

442
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,570
um,
trans rights.

443
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,071
I mean,
I'm familiar.

444
00:25:50,071 --> 00:25:51,080
Like I,
I don't see,

445
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,200
I follow up on,
on critique.

446
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,350
You okay.
So yeah,

447
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,190
nothing is,
can you share people from those ideas?

448
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:57,803
Am I supposed to comfort them and make 
sure that they are insulated away from 

449
00:26:01,411 --> 00:26:03,590
this?
Like is that what the point of visits?

450
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,500
Because to me that is so against what a 
university is about.

451
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:12,450
So against it I was not taking sides.
I was presenting both arguments.

452
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:12,950
Okay.

453
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:17,950
So the thing of it is about this is if 
you're presenting something like this,

454
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,310
it,
uh,

455
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,570
you have to think about the kind of 
teaching climate that you're creating.

456
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:24,853
And this is actually,
these arguments are counter to the 

457
00:26:28,881 --> 00:26:32,030
Canadian human rights code.
Uh,

458
00:26:32,031 --> 00:26:34,370
ever since I know that you talked about,
um,

459
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,563
see 16 ever since this past,
it is discriminatory to be targeting 

460
00:26:41,241 --> 00:26:42,650
someone,
um,

461
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,330
due their gender identity or gender 
expression.

462
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,390
So bringing something like that up in 
class,

463
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,253
not critically.
And I understand that you're trying to 

464
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:51,780
like,
it was critical.

465
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:55,430
I introduced it critically.
How so?

466
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,750
Like I said,
like I said,

467
00:26:56,751 --> 00:26:58,140
I,
it was in the spirit of debate.

468
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,183
Okay.
In the spirit of the debate is slightly 

469
00:27:01,441 --> 00:27:03,390
different than being like,
okay,

470
00:27:03,391 --> 00:27:04,224
this is,
this is like a problematic idea that we 

471
00:27:06,241 --> 00:27:08,970
want to meet when we want to unpack.
But that's taking sides.

472
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,353
Yes.
Like it's taking sides for me to be 

473
00:27:11,191 --> 00:27:12,630
like,
oh look at this guy.

474
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,580
Like everything that comes out,
his mouth is bs,

475
00:27:14,581 --> 00:27:15,840
but we're going to watch anyway.
Okay.

476
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:20,760
So I understand the position that you 
coming from and your positionality,

477
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:26,180
but the reality is that it has created a
toxic climate for some of the students.

478
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,323
You know,
it,

479
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,490
it's great.
Like how many one,

480
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,690
yes.
May I speak?

481
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,780
I have no,
I had no concept of,

482
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,200
of like how many people complained,
like what their complaint was.

483
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:42,660
You haven't showed me the complaint.
Yes,

484
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:45,900
I understand that this is upsetting,
but there's also a confidential,

485
00:27:45,901 --> 00:27:48,420
at the end,
confidentiality matters.

486
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,560
The number of people is confidential.
Yes.

487
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,273
It is one or multiple students who have 
come forward saying that this is 

488
00:27:56,311 --> 00:27:59,100
something that they were concerned about
it and that it made them uncomfortable.

489
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,880
If this is,
for example,

490
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:03,714
a trans student,
this is basically debating whether or 

491
00:28:06,511 --> 00:28:10,920
not a trans student should have rights 
within one of their classes.

492
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,223
Um,
and that's not something that is really 

493
00:28:13,591 --> 00:28:14,424
acceptable in the context of the kind of
learning environment that we're trying 

494
00:28:17,611 --> 00:28:18,444
to create.
It would be the equivalent of debating 

495
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,670
whether or not,
uh,

496
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:24,643
you know,
a student of color should have rights 

497
00:28:26,241 --> 00:28:28,350
or,
or should be allowed to be married.

498
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,050
Do you see where you'd like how this is 
not,

499
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,303
this is not something that's 
intellectually neutral that is kind of 

500
00:28:36,061 --> 00:28:37,190
up for debate.
This,

501
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,083
I mean,
this is the charter of rights and 

502
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:42,390
debate,
but I mean,

503
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,570
you're perfectly welcome to your own 
opinions,

504
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,370
but when you're bringing it into the 
context of the classroom,

505
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:51,563
that can become problematic.
I'm not going to become something that 

506
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,243
is the,
creates an unsafe learning environment 

507
00:28:58,651 --> 00:29:01,230
for students,
but when they leave the university,

508
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,300
they're going to be exposed to these 
ideas.

509
00:29:03,301 --> 00:29:08,301
So I don't see how I'm doing a 
disservice to the class by exposing them

510
00:29:08,431 --> 00:29:10,320
to ideas that are really out there.
And I'm sorry,

511
00:29:10,321 --> 00:29:11,154
I'm crying.
I'm stressed out because this to me is 

512
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,890
so wrong.
Can I mention the gender violence,

513
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,320
um,
generating actual violence?

514
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,460
Yeah,
so I agree that,

515
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,740
um,
it does gender balance,

516
00:29:25,741 --> 00:29:28,260
I think just include sexual violence,
but it also includes,

517
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:31,530
um,
targeting folks based on gender.

518
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,270
Um,
so that includes transphobia,

519
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,680
Bi phobia,
homophobia.

520
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,740
All those sorts of things I protected 
under the policy.

521
00:29:37,741 --> 00:29:40,730
And so those are things that Laurie has,
um,

522
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:41,883
upheld as values,
as well as the Ontario Human Rights 

523
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,263
Code.
Um,

524
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,720
and so those are things that we're 
responsible for,

525
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,140
uh,
not,

526
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,123
um,
impacting our students in that way and 

527
00:29:57,191 --> 00:29:58,024
not,
um,

528
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:00,580
not spreading transphobia.
Okay.

529
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:04,690
So what I have a problem with is I 
didn't target anybody who did.

530
00:30:04,691 --> 00:30:05,524
I Target Trans folks how by telling my 
ideas that are really out there by 

531
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:11,950
telling them that.
But

532
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,433
really it's,
it's not just telling them in 

533
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:26,010
legitimizing this as a valid perspective
as this is another valid perspective and

534
00:30:26,551 --> 00:30:29,230
university,
all perspectives are valid.

535
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,800
That's not necessarily true.
Well,

536
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,673
this,
this is something that's being debated 

537
00:30:33,971 --> 00:30:34,804
in current society and I don't feel the 
need to shield people from what's going 

538
00:30:38,111 --> 00:30:38,944
on in society.
Like to imagine that this is happening 

539
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:43,810
in university.
It's just a bad.

540
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:44,703
Okay.
So just to give you a context also 

541
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,620
within all of this is happening.
Um,

542
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:54,190
Laurie a's being blanketed with white 
supremacist,

543
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:56,320
um,
posters currently.

544
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:59,320
Um,
there's another debate in society,

545
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:00,603
which is whether or not North America 
should be a set of white nationalist 

546
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,610
states and that it should be ethnically 
cleanse of other people.

547
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,593
That is also a current debate society.
Would you show something in your 

548
00:31:15,701 --> 00:31:17,340
tutorial that,
you know,

549
00:31:17,341 --> 00:31:18,340
had,
you know,

550
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,383
white supremacists and non white 
supremacists debating whether or not 

551
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,730
other people should live in North 
America.

552
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,840
Is that something that you would show,
um,

553
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:31,120
if that was related to the content of 
the week and we were talking about right

554
00:31:31,121 --> 00:31:32,320
wing speech bubbles?
Maybe

555
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,500
it depends on the content.
Like,

556
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,483
I mean,
if there's really ideas that are 

557
00:31:37,091 --> 00:31:40,000
existing out there like that,
then I mean,

558
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:42,430
look,
the thing is like,

559
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:46,420
I don't see what's transphobic about 
showing a video of Jordan Peterson.

560
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,210
He's a real person.
He is that he's out there,

561
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,533
he's a real person,
but he's a real person who has engaged 

562
00:31:54,021 --> 00:31:58,350
in targeted behavior that,
uh,

563
00:31:58,620 --> 00:31:59,080
uh,
or,

564
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,590
or,
or targeting of,

565
00:32:00,591 --> 00:32:02,420
of Trans Students,
um,

566
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,710
in particular,
like,

567
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,930
like basically doxing them,
uh,

568
00:32:05,931 --> 00:32:06,764
if you know the term,
like giving out their personal 

569
00:32:08,151 --> 00:32:09,740
information so that they will be 
attacked,

570
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,060
uh,
harassed.

571
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:14,930
So that death threats will find them.
Um,

572
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,420
this is something that he has done to 
his own students,

573
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,970
he has done to other students.
Um,

574
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,460
and this is also something that the 
students are aware of.

575
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,150
So this is,
this is basically like playing,

576
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,153
not to kind of do the thing where 
everything is kind of compared to 

577
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:34,920
Hitler,
but this is like neutrally playing uh,

578
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:35,763
a speech by,
by Hitler or Milo Yiannopoulos from 

579
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:39,163
Gamer gate.
This is the kind of thing that 

580
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:42,943
departmentally in terms of like critical
communication studies and in terms of 

581
00:32:46,821 --> 00:32:51,821
the course of what we're trying to do is
diametrically opposed to everything that

582
00:32:52,851 --> 00:32:54,620
we've been talking about in the lectures

583
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,013
faculty and administration at Wilfrid 
laurier university reacted in a number 

584
00:32:59,681 --> 00:33:03,310
of different matters to the release of 
this tape information.

585
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:04,443
I'm going to first read you some 
excerpts from the independent fact 

586
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:07,984
finding report commissioned by Wilfrid 
Laurier University President Deborah 

587
00:33:11,411 --> 00:33:12,940
mcclachi.
She said,

588
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,463
I believe it is time for some clarity 
around the events of the past few weeks 

589
00:33:17,471 --> 00:33:18,304
here at Wilfrid laurier university 
stemming from the very regrettable 

590
00:33:21,671 --> 00:33:22,504
meeting that followed the showing of a 
TV show clip by a teaching assistant 

591
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:26,523
during a tutorial.
There were numerous errors in judgment 

592
00:33:30,431 --> 00:33:31,264
made in the handling of the meeting with
Ms. Lindsay Shepherd the ta of the 

593
00:33:34,541 --> 00:33:37,030
tutorial and question.
In fact,

594
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,760
the meeting never should have happened 
at all.

595
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:45,240
No formal complaint nor informal concern
relative to a lorry.

596
00:33:45,241 --> 00:33:49,090
A policy was registered about the 
screening of the video.

597
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,060
This was confirmed in the fact finding 
report.

598
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,070
There was no wrongdoing on the part of 
Ms. Shepherd in showing the clip from TV

599
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,053
in her tutorial showing a TV oh clip for
the purposes of an academic discussion 

600
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,560
is a reasonable classroom teaching tool.

601
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:06,543
Any instructional material needs to be 
grounded in the appropriate academic 

602
00:34:09,761 --> 00:34:10,594
underpinnings.
To put it in context for the relevance 

603
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:13,594
of the learning outcomes of the course,
the ensuing discussion also needs to be 

604
00:34:17,111 --> 00:34:17,944
handled properly.
We have no reason to believe this 

605
00:34:20,021 --> 00:34:23,620
discussion was not handled well in the 
tutorial in question.

606
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,760
So after Debra mcclachi commissioned an 
independent fact finder,

607
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,700
Lindsay Shepherd was completely 
exonerated.

608
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,713
I'll put a link to where you can read 
the university presidents entire 

609
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:40,450
response to the disciplinary meeting in 
question.

610
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:41,403
Now,
this is how Debra mcclachi sums the 

611
00:34:45,191 --> 00:34:46,024
situation up.
For those who have chosen to use this 

612
00:34:48,401 --> 00:34:49,234
incident as an indictment of Wilfrid 
laurier university or the plight of 

613
00:34:52,751 --> 00:34:57,751
Canadian universities in general,
I say your assertion is unreasonable and

614
00:34:57,941 --> 00:35:00,610
unfounded.
While that really is the question,

615
00:35:00,611 --> 00:35:03,220
isn't it,
was this a unique occurrence,

616
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,340
a consequence of the misbehavior,
shall we say,

617
00:35:06,341 --> 00:35:09,430
of two ill informed professors and an 
administrator,

618
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:14,410
or was this actually diagnostic of the 
genuine state of Canadian universities,

619
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,480
perhaps universities in the Western 
world?

620
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,920
We have to review the evidence at hand 
first.

621
00:35:20,921 --> 00:35:23,350
We have what happened at Wilfrid laurier
itself.

622
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,663
I would like to point out that the 
events there were more serious and less 

623
00:35:28,181 --> 00:35:31,150
predictable.
Even then what I had warned about when I

624
00:35:31,151 --> 00:35:34,930
made my original video,
I assumed that people would be,

625
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,460
could be prosecuted,
failure to use

626
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:43,140
preferred pronouns,
and I was objecting to that as a example

627
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:43,974
of compelled speech,
but I never imagined that a teaching 

628
00:35:46,831 --> 00:35:50,610
assistant would be accused of breaking 
provincial and federal laws.

629
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,593
Bill see 16 specifically for daring to 
show a video about people discussing 

630
00:35:56,551 --> 00:36:01,140
such issues on a public television 
station and then also accused of being a

631
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,153
transform,
which is let it be noted now a crime 

632
00:36:05,251 --> 00:36:09,240
under the criminal code provisions of 
Bill See 16 furthermore,

633
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,710
in the aftermath of her release of this 
discussion,

634
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:19,040
shepherd was accused of all of the right
wing attributes that had been leveled at

635
00:36:20,071 --> 00:36:20,904
me,
all of which are also arguably 

636
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:24,923
prosecutable under the ages of bill see 
16 now we don't want to underemphasize 

637
00:36:31,921 --> 00:36:32,754
the importance of this.
Remember that these were two faculty 

638
00:36:34,621 --> 00:36:37,830
members and as well and administrator 
Andrea Joel,

639
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:42,900
who is hired precisely for this purpose.
So that's the first piece of evidence.

640
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,993
Next we might consider the response from
others at Wilfrid laurier university 

641
00:36:48,391 --> 00:36:49,224
itself as well as professors and pundits
outside that university in other 

642
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,593
departments and institutions.
I'm going to start with a letter that 

643
00:36:57,331 --> 00:36:58,164
was written by 20 members of the 
Department of communication studies at 

644
00:37:01,111 --> 00:37:03,810
Wilfrid Laurier,
which is the same department that houses

645
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:05,640
Ramboo,
Kana and Pimlott.

646
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,860
Here's what they had to say about the 
matter.

647
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:10,050
I'm going to paraphrase.

648
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,953
A meeting with shepard was secretly 
recorded and sent to the media by that 

649
00:37:15,931 --> 00:37:17,550
ta,
this act,

650
00:37:17,551 --> 00:37:20,910
spark columns and op eds that rushed to 
assess the meeting.

651
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:24,990
Generalizing from this single event,
a diagnosis of our program,

652
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,200
the university and the state of higher 
education in Canada.

653
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,453
We welcome the widening range of 
perspectives on this situation that are 

654
00:37:32,221 --> 00:37:34,410
beginning to emerge in the public 
sphere.

655
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,680
We recognize that the meeting was 
mishandled.

656
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,800
We specifically acknowledge the power 
imbalance in the meeting.

657
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:44,650
As doctor Ramboo.
Kenna acknowledged in his open letter to

658
00:37:44,651 --> 00:37:49,600
his ta in future meetings were serious 
matters pertaining to the conduct of Tas

659
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:50,434
are under discussion.
We acknowledged that students should be 

660
00:37:52,121 --> 00:37:55,030
encouraged to bring someone representing
them and their interests.

661
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,073
We would support a graduate student 
initiative to unionize ta's which could 

662
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:00,334
provide student employees with a 
grievance process and other forms of 

663
00:38:02,831 --> 00:38:06,610
support in cases such as this one as we 
understand it,

664
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,593
doctor ramboo counted,
did not operate unilaterally when he 

665
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:11,620
called a meeting with his ta.
Rather,

666
00:38:11,621 --> 00:38:12,454
we believe he acted in response to a 
disclosure made by one or more students 

667
00:38:15,221 --> 00:38:18,910
to university offices set up to provide 
confidential support.

668
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,880
Upon being notified of this disclosure,
Dr Ramboo,

669
00:38:21,881 --> 00:38:22,714
Kenna as course instructor,
understood that he had a responsibility 

670
00:38:25,421 --> 00:38:29,470
to act in line with university policies 
including those laid out in the gendered

671
00:38:29,471 --> 00:38:30,910
and sexual violence policy.

672
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,460
Now I'm going to interject here for a 
minute.

673
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,533
That's a very interesting because 
president mcclachi has basically 

674
00:38:37,511 --> 00:38:38,344
complained that Rambo counter and 
Pimlott and Joel herself acted outside 

675
00:38:42,071 --> 00:38:44,350
the policies that the university has 
established.

676
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,303
However,
the faculty members writing and 

677
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:50,110
supportive their callings claim that the
reason that Rambo County and Pimlott and

678
00:38:50,111 --> 00:38:50,944
Joel as well acted in the manner they 
did was because they were following 

679
00:38:53,891 --> 00:38:55,900
those policies.
So which is it?

680
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,450
Now,
here's my 2 cents for what it's worth.

681
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:03,400
My suspicions are that the policies are 
written so badly like bill see 16 itself

682
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:04,234
and the surrounding policies at the 
Ontario Human Rights Commission that 

683
00:39:06,701 --> 00:39:09,280
either of those interpretations are 
possible.

684
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,833
It's convenient for the university to 
disavow responsibility for the actions 

685
00:39:13,811 --> 00:39:14,644
of its faculty member and it's 
administrators and it's convenient for 

686
00:39:16,811 --> 00:39:17,644
the faculty members and administrators 
to say that they were just following 

687
00:39:20,201 --> 00:39:25,201
policy and it's not clear at all that 
the independent fact finding council has

688
00:39:27,731 --> 00:39:29,740
settled that to anyone's satisfaction.

689
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,413
Either way,
it's serious business back to the 

690
00:39:34,031 --> 00:39:34,864
letter,
while the free speech of a single 

691
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:40,090
individual has dominated discussion 
surrounding this situation,

692
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,930
academic freedom is also a decisive term
in this context.

693
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,913
Dr Rambo,
Kenna exercises academic freedom as a 

694
00:39:46,901 --> 00:39:47,734
core supervisor by setting parameters 
for the multiple tutorials that 

695
00:39:50,951 --> 00:39:51,784
supplement his lecture.
It is within the scope of a supervising 

696
00:39:55,211 --> 00:39:56,044
professors academic freedom to have 
workplace meetings with Tas regarding 

697
00:39:58,961 --> 00:40:01,540
how course material is taught.
All right,

698
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:06,541
so I have to interject again.
It isn't obvious to me that this meeting

699
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,123
with shepard constituted a normative 
workplace meeting with a ta regarding 

700
00:40:14,231 --> 00:40:15,064
how course material is taught and the 
fundamental reason for that is the 

701
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,040
appearance at the meeting of the 
administrator,

702
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:23,980
Andrea Joel,
as well as the numerous accusations that

703
00:40:23,981 --> 00:40:24,814
were leveled at Shepherd.
So I think that that sentence is 

704
00:40:27,281 --> 00:40:28,990
disingenuous.
At best.

705
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,093
We maintain that the use of materials 
that invite controversy into the 

706
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:35,890
classroom need to be approached with 
pedagogical care and forethought.

707
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:38,680
Public debates about freedom of 
expression,

708
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:39,663
while valuable can have a silencing 
effect on the free speech of other 

709
00:40:42,971 --> 00:40:43,804
members of the public.
We uphold the rights of Trans nonbinary 

710
00:40:46,751 --> 00:40:47,584
and queer folk to be addressed in our 
classrooms in ways that they define 

711
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,290
those in positions of authority in the 
classroom.

712
00:40:53,291 --> 00:40:54,520
Faculty,
instructors,

713
00:40:54,521 --> 00:40:58,210
teaching assistants are not sitting 
equally around the table with students.

714
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,193
Instead,
they have a responsibility to foster an 

715
00:41:01,061 --> 00:41:03,490
environment of mutual respect and 
critical thinking.

716
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:04,563
One wherein students should never feel 
that either their grades or their 

717
00:41:06,761 --> 00:41:09,640
wellbeing could be impacted because of 
their gender,

718
00:41:09,641 --> 00:41:10,840
sexuality,
race,

719
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:13,300
class,
or any other facet of their identity.

720
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,733
We appreciate that our university has 
mechanisms through which students who 

721
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:17,974
feel unsafe,
unfairly treated or have experienced 

722
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:21,094
intolerance in the classroom or 
otherwise in the role of students can 

723
00:41:23,531 --> 00:41:26,200
make appeals and find support and 
resources to help them.

724
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:27,363
We also acknowledge that we can do a 
better job of making students aware of 

725
00:41:30,101 --> 00:41:30,934
these mechanisms.
We are always so grateful when students 

726
00:41:33,441 --> 00:41:34,274
do approach campus offices designed for 
reporting problematic classroom 

727
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,370
situations as their courage makes us do 
our jobs better.

728
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:41,323
We thank you for coming forward.
You are such valued members of our 

729
00:41:43,671 --> 00:41:44,504
community.
Charges that are program shelter 

730
00:41:46,321 --> 00:41:48,770
students from real world issues or 
fosters classrooms.

731
00:41:48,771 --> 00:41:49,604
Inhospitable to discussing contentious 
issues from different vantage points 

732
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:52,963
seem to us simply preposterous.
We reject efforts of those who have 

733
00:41:56,541 --> 00:42:01,430
seized this episode as a strategic 
opportunity to disparage disciplines and

734
00:42:01,431 --> 00:42:02,264
scholars with commitments to improving 
social and economic inequality within 

735
00:42:05,571 --> 00:42:07,910
universities and in society.
At Large.

736
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,103
Commentary on this event in the press.
And social media has emboldened 

737
00:42:11,631 --> 00:42:12,464
individuals who see themselves as noble 
defenders of free speech to intimidate 

738
00:42:15,981 --> 00:42:20,150
our faculty and students to the point 
that protective measures have been taken

739
00:42:20,151 --> 00:42:22,550
in an attempt to secure their safety.
Okay.

740
00:42:22,551 --> 00:42:25,010
So another bit of commentary is 
necessary there.

741
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,970
So there was a concerted effort made by 
the Neo Marxists,

742
00:42:28,971 --> 00:42:29,804
postmodern radical leftist types to 
paint lindsay shepherd as the 

743
00:42:33,081 --> 00:42:36,650
perpetrator and the faculty members and 
administrators who were involved in this

744
00:42:36,651 --> 00:42:37,484
issue as the true victims.
And that's where this bit of 

745
00:42:39,381 --> 00:42:40,214
conceptualization is coming from.
Perhaps the most remarkable of such 

746
00:42:43,881 --> 00:42:47,860
comments about shepherd was broadcast on
our national broadcaster,

747
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:49,880
CBC,
TV Sunday,

748
00:42:49,881 --> 00:42:53,360
scrum where a number of journalists,
Vicky,

749
00:42:53,361 --> 00:42:55,520
Moshe,
Shama John Edmondson,

750
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,360
and Susan Riley.
We're discussing people of the year.

751
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,310
It was Vicky Mashama that made the 
comments that I've clipped.

752
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,020
John,
who would your pick be?

753
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,880
Uh,
another young woman,

754
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:08,913
um,
Lindsay Shepherd who have heard a lot 

755
00:43:10,341 --> 00:43:11,001
about,
uh,

756
00:43:11,001 --> 00:43:14,060
she was the young teaching assistant 
that Laurier University,

757
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,520
uh,
who was called on the carpet for showing

758
00:43:16,521 --> 00:43:18,720
a video of Jordan Peterson.
And it was the,

759
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:19,603
the recording of that disciplinary 
hearing that went viral and that really 

760
00:43:23,391 --> 00:43:24,224
exploded the whole issue of the debate 
that's occurring within the social 

761
00:43:26,751 --> 00:43:29,900
sciences and humanities od the right of 
freedom of expression,

762
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,110
the right of freedom of research versus 
the right of protection,

763
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:35,480
the right to safe spaces.
Uh,

764
00:43:35,481 --> 00:43:37,840
the right not to be a subject to 
regression.

765
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:39,103
This is a virulent debate that's 
happening on university campuses across 

766
00:43:42,771 --> 00:43:44,090
the country.
Um,

767
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,860
some of us have written about it in the 
past,

768
00:43:45,861 --> 00:43:47,450
but it has to be said,
uh,

769
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,400
well,
no matter where you are on this debate,

770
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:53,210
it was Ms. Sheppard and that and that 
tape that,

771
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,133
uh,
blue this entire issue open and made it 

772
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,970
a part of the national discourse.
And for that she deserves great credit.

773
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,513
I disagree.
I think that she is someone that exists 

774
00:44:03,071 --> 00:44:05,440
and I think a lot of people responded to
her for the same reasons.

775
00:44:05,441 --> 00:44:08,650
They tend to respond to things,
which is that she's a young crying white

776
00:44:08,651 --> 00:44:09,484
girl.
But there are lots of moments in which 

777
00:44:10,631 --> 00:44:12,850
the academic freedom conversation could 
have been had.

778
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:13,863
And guts has been skipped over serially.
And I don't think that choosing 

779
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:20,620
appropriate person to have launched this
conversation because as it turned out,

780
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:22,180
she leans hard,
right,

781
00:44:22,181 --> 00:44:23,380
and some of her choices,

782
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:25,440
well,
whether you like when she needs or not,

783
00:44:25,441 --> 00:44:26,274
we're having this debate here on this 
show now and we're having it because of 

784
00:44:28,891 --> 00:44:29,724
Ms. Sheppard

785
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:33,120
back to the,
against this politics of revenge.

786
00:44:33,121 --> 00:44:33,954
We acknowledged the moral imperative to 
support and protect our colleagues and 

787
00:44:36,781 --> 00:44:37,614
students.
We urge our colleagues at Lori and 

788
00:44:39,391 --> 00:44:43,110
beyond to monitor carefully how this 
event has been framed and taken up.

789
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:44,423
Another bit of commentary for me.
I would also encourage colleagues at 

790
00:44:47,701 --> 00:44:52,020
Lori and beyond to monitor carefully how
this event has been framed and taken up.

791
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:54,000
I guess that's exactly what I'm doing 
now.

792
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:58,650
We agree with Lorius president that we 
live in an increasingly polarized world.

793
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:02,220
Understanding the forces and discontent 
driving this polarization,

794
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,413
including how they are at play in this 
situation and with what consequences is 

795
00:45:06,151 --> 00:45:10,440
a collective task in which we all have a
stake and 20 undersigned,

796
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:11,274
faculty and affiliate members of the 
Department of Communication Studies 

797
00:45:13,441 --> 00:45:14,274
signed this.
Although the signatories of this letter 

798
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,533
admit that the meeting was mishandled.
They do not say much about how with the 

799
00:45:22,411 --> 00:45:26,610
exception that shepherd was not provided
with independent or support.

800
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,630
To the contrary,
they state that Ramboo Kana at all.

801
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:35,750
We're simply following university 
policies put in place as quote mechanism

802
00:45:36,051 --> 00:45:36,884
through which students who feel unsafe,
unfairly treated or have experienced 

803
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:41,574
intolerance in the classroom or 
otherwise in the role as a student can 

804
00:45:45,151 --> 00:45:48,120
make appeals and find support and 
resources to help them.

805
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:49,883
Thus,
although mcclachi and these letter 

806
00:45:51,841 --> 00:45:52,674
writers both claim in their way that 
this incident is not diagnostic of the 

807
00:45:56,821 --> 00:45:57,654
state of the program,
the university and the state of higher 

808
00:46:00,961 --> 00:46:01,794
education in Canada,
both the statement from mcclatchy and 

809
00:46:04,591 --> 00:46:08,910
the Department of Communications 
indicate in fact that something has gone

810
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:09,953
deeply and profoundly wrong.
Ramboo Canada's colleagues state that 

811
00:46:13,711 --> 00:46:14,544
Ramboo Canna Pimlott at all did nothing 
wrong except shepherds lack of 

812
00:46:18,451 --> 00:46:22,140
independent representation.
And if they did do something wrong,

813
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:26,310
it was merely because they were 
following policy which was laudatory and

814
00:46:26,311 --> 00:46:30,270
admirable in its intent,
if not in its implementation.

815
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,093
Now the Wilfred Laurier a faculty 
association also weighed in on this 

816
00:46:35,371 --> 00:46:36,204
issue,
and here's the gist of what they had to 

817
00:46:38,071 --> 00:46:38,904
say.
I'll put a link to the entire letter in 

818
00:46:40,681 --> 00:46:41,514
the description of this video,
but this is what they considered most 

819
00:46:44,521 --> 00:46:48,090
worthy of note
to be clear.

820
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:53,120
W L Ufa condemns the violent speech and 
actions that have unfortunately become a

821
00:46:53,641 --> 00:46:56,850
daily occurrence on our campuses.
In particular,

822
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:57,803
the harm that has been leveled at our 
trans community and its supporters is 

823
00:47:00,631 --> 00:47:01,464
unacceptable.
W L UFA stands in solidarity with our 

824
00:47:04,771 --> 00:47:05,604
Lgbtq t community as they continue to 
battle their way through walls of 

825
00:47:10,081 --> 00:47:10,914
ignorance and oppression.
Walls that seem to have been 

826
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:16,500
disproportionately fortified in the last
few weeks.

827
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:17,993
So that's commentary on then Lindsay 
Shepherd affair from the faculty 

828
00:47:21,151 --> 00:47:21,984
association,
representing all of the professors at 

829
00:47:23,821 --> 00:47:24,654
Wilfrid laurier university.
No comment whatsoever of substance on 

830
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:30,550
the nature of the meeting itself.

831
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:31,383
Only an expression of concern for the 
hypothetically and very poorly 

832
00:47:34,121 --> 00:47:34,954
documented by the way,
unsafe conditions for faculty and 

833
00:47:38,291 --> 00:47:39,124
students that have arisen at Wilfrid 
laurier university in the aftermath of 

834
00:47:42,341 --> 00:47:44,500
the release of shepherds tape of the 
meeting.

835
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:46,383
Now I said that I was speaking to junior
high and high school students at the 

836
00:47:49,481 --> 00:47:50,314
beginning of this video and so far I've 
only talked about the state of our 

837
00:47:53,591 --> 00:47:54,424
universities,
but I'm doing this and providing this 

838
00:47:56,531 --> 00:47:57,364
extensive background because 
universities provide the teachers for 

839
00:47:59,921 --> 00:48:00,754
our public schools as well as the 
destination place for the most 

840
00:48:03,731 --> 00:48:07,120
academically able of the students who 
come through the school system.

841
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:11,110
Thus,
before making my recommendations,

842
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:12,213
which I will do with all seriousness,
I have to document my discontent 

843
00:48:15,701 --> 00:48:16,534
thoroughly.

844
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:19,263
I'm therefore going to talk about the 
response to the shepherd if they're 

845
00:48:21,911 --> 00:48:26,860
outside of Wilfrid laurier university 
before returning to the point at hand.

846
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:28,503
I'm doing that to demonstrate that the 
state of affairs indicated by Lindsay 

847
00:48:33,281 --> 00:48:37,300
shepherds tape is by no means unique to 
Wilford Lori a itself.

848
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:42,670
I'm going to start with a few video 
clips featuring professor Rinaldo,

849
00:48:42,671 --> 00:48:43,504
a wall caught of the women and Gender 
Studies Institute at the Ontario 

850
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:52,830
Institute for the studies of Education.
These clips are taken once again,

851
00:48:53,081 --> 00:48:57,190
interestingly enough from TV shows the 
agenda with Steve Pakan.

852
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:01,480
Walcott recently appeared on the agenda 
to discuss the events.

853
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:02,463
I'm speaking with you about today.
I chose to highlight Walcott because 

854
00:49:06,731 --> 00:49:07,564
he's director of the women and Gender 
Studies Institute at the Ontario 

855
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,480
Institute for the studies of Education 
and oil.

856
00:49:13,481 --> 00:49:14,314
Z as it's known is perhaps the most 
influential educational institute 

857
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:19,383
concerned with Public School curriculum 
in all of Canada and therefore an 

858
00:49:23,051 --> 00:49:23,884
organization whose decisions are of 
critical importance for determining the 

859
00:49:28,241 --> 00:49:29,074
nature of what's taught from 
kindergarten all the way through high 

860
00:49:32,231 --> 00:49:34,210
school,
not only in Ontario,

861
00:49:34,211 --> 00:49:38,080
but because of its influence all across 
Canada and perhaps beyond.

862
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:39,303
I firmly believe that Walcott's attitude
is indicative of the ideological stance 

863
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,593
that characterizes the philosophy that 
is taught to those who will be the 

864
00:49:50,981 --> 00:49:51,814
teachers of young people in the public 
school system in Canada from 

865
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,410
kindergarten through high school.

866
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,553
The incidents at Wilfrid laurier 
university have certainly provoked a 

867
00:50:01,701 --> 00:50:02,534
debate within academia and beyond on 
finding that sweet spot between freedom 

868
00:50:06,441 --> 00:50:09,530
of expression and respecting the 
diversity of the student body.

869
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,280
Is it possible to satisfy both of those 
legitimate aims?

870
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:16,610
Let's find out.
Can we welcome in alphabetical order?

871
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:21,410
Shannon Day professor of philosophy at 
University of Waterloo and Mcfarland,

872
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,020
professor of political science,
University of Waterloo,

873
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,930
Thomas Merit Canada research chair in 
genomics,

874
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:28,100
bioinformatics

875
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,010
at Laurentian University in Sudbury,
Janice Stein,

876
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:31,933
founding director of the Munk School of 
global affairs at the University of 

877
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:35,323
Toronto and Rinaldo Walcott,
associate professor in social justice 

878
00:50:38,211 --> 00:50:39,044
education at Oise,
the Ontario Institute for Studies in 

879
00:50:41,781 --> 00:50:42,770
education.
Okay,

880
00:50:42,771 --> 00:50:46,140
so a couple of things we want to answer 
that I'd take the loan lung for you on a

881
00:50:46,141 --> 00:50:46,974
desk.
So what do we are actually fan today in 

882
00:50:48,771 --> 00:50:49,604
2017 it's a long cultural award.
I had new wage in a university in the 

883
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:54,883
60s when women studies and I happened to
be the director of lemming studies at 

884
00:50:56,841 --> 00:50:57,674
the same university as Janice when 
women's studies and black studies broke 

885
00:51:00,471 --> 00:51:01,304
into the North American University.
That's been a consistent push against 

886
00:51:05,751 --> 00:51:06,584
them from the 60s on until the present.
And part of this debate around free 

887
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:11,234
speech around academic freedom are ways 
to diminish the fundamental impact of 

888
00:51:15,471 --> 00:51:16,304
women's studies and black studies and 
other ethnic studies has had on the 

889
00:51:18,621 --> 00:51:21,890
university all the way up to having 
women as presidents.

890
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,500
And Bim and that's vice presidents in 
writing institutions.

891
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,990
I teach difficult material all the time.
My students,

892
00:51:26,991 --> 00:51:29,510
I don't have to give trigger warnings,
I don't have to do any of that.

893
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,200
It's not about what's in our books 
that's at stake here.

894
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:36,800
It's about a reframing of the university
where people like myself,

895
00:51:36,801 --> 00:51:37,634
indigenous people,
Queer people are making a demand on an 

896
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:40,933
institution that had headed to a 
previously locked us out and we're 

897
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:44,684
seeing that our voices matter too and 
we're saying that the ways in which the 

898
00:51:47,991 --> 00:51:48,824
languages of academic freedom and free 
and free speech have been framed within 

899
00:51:51,801 --> 00:51:52,634
the context of the university has often 
provided pathways in particular for 

900
00:51:56,331 --> 00:51:59,060
straight white men to say really cruel,
harmful,

901
00:51:59,061 --> 00:51:59,894
hurtful things and words do hurt and now
we're responding to that and we're 

902
00:52:03,651 --> 00:52:04,400
saying,
no,

903
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,233
this can't happen.
This kind of happened in our workplaces 

904
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:08,210
where we come to,
where we are,

905
00:52:08,211 --> 00:52:09,770
where we come to study and so on.

906
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:10,723
This is a cultural war that's being 
waged within a particular institution 

907
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:14,810
and we should be extremely clear about 
that.

908
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:15,823
This is a pushback against the way in 
which academic scholarship as actually 

909
00:52:19,311 --> 00:52:20,144
revealed on the opinions of the 
university as a kind of white 

910
00:52:22,431 --> 00:52:26,330
supremacists logic or senior 
administrators jump into pr mode.

911
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:27,343
Not to address what's happening inside 
in Firstie but to quell the Shelton 

912
00:52:30,531 --> 00:52:33,230
voiseys largely of the right way.
Outside university.

913
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:36,050
I see this everyday at my university at 
University of Toronto.

914
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:38,210
We have the ongoing Jordan Peterson 
matter,

915
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,133
right?
Their response is not been to say 

916
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,410
women's studies,
Black Studies,

917
00:52:42,411 --> 00:52:43,244
African studies.
These kinds of studies have been 

918
00:52:45,411 --> 00:52:47,510
tremendous contributions to the 
university.

919
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:48,523
Instead,
there's been a profound silence as 

920
00:52:50,511 --> 00:52:51,344
though the work that folks who work in 
those areas do does not matter that 

921
00:52:54,201 --> 00:52:55,034
overwatch,
all wealth and generative intellectual 

922
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:02,360
spirit serve the university and that 
that is their fundamental flaw.

923
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:03,343
That where we've seen our senior 
administrators become managers in favor 

924
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:11,090
of the donors in favor of a secured 
right wing mom,

925
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,073
you'll never see the soul call laugh.
Actually getting that kind of response 

926
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:15,194
from university administrators don't 
agree with you and another one that I 

927
00:53:18,441 --> 00:53:21,320
think it's much more subtle and it's 
much more complex.

928
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:22,783
Actually the role of your receipt 
administrators is not get into those 

929
00:53:26,731 --> 00:53:28,320
debates.
Um,

930
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:32,970
what really matters is that all the 
programs you talked about,

931
00:53:32,971 --> 00:53:34,860
which are very important,
and from my perspective,

932
00:53:34,861 --> 00:53:37,530
a core part of the university,
um,

933
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:38,453
thrive if and faculty members and 
students feel free to come into the 

934
00:53:43,021 --> 00:53:43,854
classroom and have these debates,
the role of university administrators 

935
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,193
fundamentally beyond everything else.
And many of them are scars in their own 

936
00:53:51,931 --> 00:53:52,764
right,
but their role in their current jobs is 

937
00:53:54,871 --> 00:53:57,870
to protect those rights.
But what I'll say to there,

938
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:03,360
there's silence is an abrogation of 
those rights by their very silence,

939
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,590
by the very silence.

940
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:05,463
What they're saying is that some of the 
voices matter more than others within 

941
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:10,080
the context of the institution.
Think that's true.

942
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:10,801
I,
well,

943
00:54:10,801 --> 00:54:11,634
we fundamentally disagree.
Let's look what the University of 

944
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,870
Toronto,
one concrete example did.

945
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:19,650
And when Jordan Peterson's work became 
very controversial,

946
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:22,380
they did what he versus she do.
They organize the debate

947
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,500
that was fundamentally flawed.
And Jordan Peterson,

948
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,590
it was not even the question of Jordan 
Peterson his work,

949
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:31,260
because he doesn't work in the areas 
that he's claiming to criticize.

950
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,900
He does.
He has no expertise in them.

951
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:34,923
If I as a black faculty,
University of Toronto had engage in the 

952
00:54:37,141 --> 00:54:37,974
kinds of things that Jordan Peterson 
engaged and I am sure I would have been 

953
00:54:40,591 --> 00:54:45,180
drummed out of the university.
I think we're sidestepping the issue.

954
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:46,433
The issue is really one about the,
the role that university has played in 

955
00:54:49,681 --> 00:54:50,514
helping to purchase the very kinds of 
oppressions that many of us teach them 

956
00:54:53,161 --> 00:54:53,580
research.

957
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:54,413
Right now the university is deeply 
implicated and producing certain kinds 

958
00:54:57,511 --> 00:55:00,720
of logics of white supremacy and if we 
don't grapple with that,

959
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:01,583
then we can actually begin to grapple 
with the claims that people who have 

960
00:55:04,171 --> 00:55:06,570
been tradition,
who have been consistently oppressed and

961
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,433
Chateaux now entering into the 
university are making claims on that 

962
00:55:10,261 --> 00:55:11,094
institution to better respond to them.
This is what this is fundamentally 

963
00:55:14,221 --> 00:55:17,550
about,
but also I would say to you Steve,

964
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:18,503
that what happens is it's not from 
women's studies and black studies that 

965
00:55:20,761 --> 00:55:21,594
these,
that these kinds of things emerge from 

966
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:24,293
if neutrally from white male scholars by
the majority often making claims about 

967
00:55:28,561 --> 00:55:30,660
things for which they have no expertise 
in.

968
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:35,130
And then we find the entire institution 
coming into place to support their right

969
00:55:35,131 --> 00:55:38,210
to speech.
Fundamentally a prosthetic you argued in

970
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:39,990
seriously,
um,

971
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:40,853
and engage and say if there are scholars
in the university who have no expertise 

972
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:46,643
as you claim who are speaking and 
writing about things which they are not 

973
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:52,883
really qualified to speak about,
is precisely when there's free debate 

974
00:55:57,781 --> 00:55:58,614
and academic freedom at that kind of 
shotty work is exposed and that's where 

975
00:56:03,121 --> 00:56:04,890
I want to agree with what it is.

976
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:09,180
A marketplace of free ideas has not 
consistently worked for nonwhite people.

977
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,890
You should be honest about that.
I think that,

978
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:11,740
I think we're,
we're,

979
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:12,451
we're,
again,

980
00:56:12,451 --> 00:56:15,030
there's a confusion here,
I think having,

981
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:19,130
you call it marketplace and I don't,
I call an an a Gora,

982
00:56:19,170 --> 00:56:22,920
which is a different thing,
but an open public square,

983
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:26,860
not a marketplace and open public square
of free debate,

984
00:56:26,861 --> 00:56:30,480
not only for faculty members where 
academic freedom has me,

985
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:33,460
but for students.
Students also have to be,

986
00:56:33,461 --> 00:56:37,780
feel free to say things that maybe 
unpopular,

987
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:40,930
maybe unconventional,
maybe risky.

988
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:42,340
Not Illegal.
No,

989
00:56:42,341 --> 00:56:43,950
of course not.
A Waco,

990
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:44,933
right.
We have marketplaces and a gorgeous 

991
00:56:46,841 --> 00:56:50,020
where people didn't debate other 
people's humanity as well.

992
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:50,973
Right now what we do is in classrooms we
have people debate whether or not trans 

993
00:56:54,041 --> 00:56:55,810
identities are are,
are,

994
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:56,663
are,
are,

995
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,810
but that's how universities evolve and 
that's how they improve.

996
00:57:01,850 --> 00:57:02,683
Second evolve,
but also saying that some things are 

997
00:57:04,181 --> 00:57:05,350
intolerable.
What?

998
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:09,610
What is the fear of saying that some 
forms of speech and tolerable in a world

999
00:57:09,611 --> 00:57:10,444
where we already have limits on speech,
we've seen it happening in the first 

1000
00:57:13,481 --> 00:57:14,440
year.
BDS,

1001
00:57:14,441 --> 00:57:16,260
we've seen it happen.
Israeli apartheid week.

1002
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:20,410
We've seen the university and many 
skillful kinds of ways limit speech.

1003
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,660
Clearly it's morally and ethically 
bankrupt.

1004
00:57:22,661 --> 00:57:27,610
The petitions in has harsh terms as I 
can to debate other people's humanity.

1005
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:28,743
If we can't begin there,
then there's something fundamentally 

1006
00:57:31,631 --> 00:57:33,420
wrong with the university as an 
institution.

1007
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:37,750
This seemed to be one of the confusing 
aspects of the situation at Aa in so far

1008
00:57:37,751 --> 00:57:42,751
as one of the professors who was 
upgrading the teaching assistant for the

1009
00:57:43,691 --> 00:57:44,524
way she conducted the class didn't seem 
to understand what the Canadian human 

1010
00:57:47,921 --> 00:57:52,360
rights code prevented or didn't prevent,
covered or didn't cover.

1011
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:55,570
Do you,
do you wonder whether faculty need a bit

1012
00:57:55,571 --> 00:57:58,630
of a refresher on what's legal or 
illegal in their classrooms?

1013
00:57:58,750 --> 00:57:59,583
And let's say his name,
Professor Rambo Cooker found himself in 

1014
00:58:02,321 --> 00:58:03,154
a very difficult situation.
He's also an untenured man of color and 

1015
00:58:06,611 --> 00:58:09,280
we know I've been a professor for over 
two decades.

1016
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:11,130
I know that as a,
yeah,

1017
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,060
on tenured black professor,
but I'm,

1018
00:58:13,061 --> 00:58:13,894
I had white ta's that often felt that 
they could do the course better than I 

1019
00:58:16,661 --> 00:58:17,494
could too.
And they often overstretched their own 

1020
00:58:19,751 --> 00:58:20,584
responsibilities as tas.
I am sure that in the context of this 

1021
00:58:23,621 --> 00:58:24,454
one particular instance that there's 
much more surrounding that professors 

1022
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:28,804
all experience with this young white 
woman that share race isn't parliaments 

1023
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,930
peaks to this longer deeper histories 
again,

1024
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,020
that the best academic and scholarly 
work in women's studies,

1025
00:58:38,021 --> 00:58:38,854
black studies and and otherwise I'm 
going to have to use this term sub all 

1026
00:58:40,901 --> 00:58:43,240
disciplines raising,
which is that,

1027
00:58:43,241 --> 00:58:45,640
you know,
we see that kind of response when it's a

1028
00:58:45,641 --> 00:58:46,510
young white woman.

1029
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:49,930
We see that kind of response when it's a
white woman in parliament.

1030
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,690
Right?
And it's not just about hypocrisy.

1031
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:57,670
It's about a log embedded history of 
home matters who counts.

1032
00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:01,630
This is about a culture war where we're,
we're representative.

1033
00:59:01,631 --> 00:59:02,464
Democracies have had to yield more space
that people who've been normally shut 

1034
00:59:06,821 --> 00:59:07,654
out and as we come into these 
institutions and we asked for their 

1035
00:59:11,111 --> 00:59:13,840
transformation,
things are beginning to fray.

1036
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:17,650
Much of this is about the Christ of 
Whiteness taking place in the context of

1037
00:59:17,651 --> 00:59:19,510
the university is the crisis of 
Whiteness.

1038
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,130
The crisis of whiteness is that white 
people are no longer

1039
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:24,890
allowed to simply say and behave in ways
that they could.

1040
00:59:24,891 --> 00:59:25,724
For instance,
in the 50s in the context of the 

1041
00:59:26,691 --> 00:59:28,760
university,
we not push back on it.

1042
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:31,600
We now call the illegitimate.
We now call it intolerable.

1043
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:37,040
Now that we've talked about universities
and those who teach the teachers and the

1044
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:37,874
ideology that possesses them say,
we're going to move a little bit closer 

1045
00:59:41,121 --> 00:59:41,954
to the school system itself.
I want to focus on the elementary 

1046
00:59:44,811 --> 00:59:45,644
teachers,
Federation of Ontario and the Toronto 

1047
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:49,453
District School Board.
These are institutions that are unique 

1048
00:59:51,801 --> 00:59:52,634
in some senses to Ontario,
but I believe they are reflective or 

1049
00:59:55,881 --> 00:59:56,714
perhaps even lead the way in the 
development of the kind of curricula 

1050
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:00,553
that are or soon will be used to cross 
Canada and the rest of the Western 

1051
01:00:04,071 --> 01:00:07,370
world.
Given how fast information now travels.

1052
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:09,373
The first question we might ask is what 
should children and young adults be 

1053
01:00:13,131 --> 01:00:16,730
taught and not taught from kindergarten 
through high school?

1054
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:19,790
My answer to that is quite straight 
forward.

1055
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:20,893
They should be taught to read and write 
and speak skillfully and gracefully and 

1056
01:00:24,861 --> 01:00:27,830
that should be done with a minimum of 
political bias.

1057
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:32,510
If you agree with that sentiment,
however imperfect you might find it,

1058
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:33,583
then you need to realize that it is not 
in the least the guiding principle of 

1059
01:00:36,501 --> 01:00:37,334
the current public education system.
The people who are teaching your 

1060
01:00:40,611 --> 01:00:43,160
children no longer believe,
for example,

1061
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:46,310
that children can be taught without 
political bias.

1062
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:47,533
They also believe that there are 
particular political viewpoints are so 

1063
01:00:50,001 --> 01:00:50,834
self evidently and finally correct that 
it is proper and just to concentrate on 

1064
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:59,780
inculcating them into children as early 
as kindergarten regardless of what their

1065
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:01,820
parents or anyone else might want.

1066
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:05,353
I do not believe that this is a goal 
shared by even a majority of teachers 

1067
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:12,710
and many have written to me indicating 
their dissatisfaction,

1068
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:14,083
but a small noisy domineering victim 
hood claiming coterie of radically left 

1069
01:01:19,131 --> 01:01:19,964
wing thinkers have commandeered the 
controls and they're steering the ship 

1070
01:01:23,391 --> 01:01:24,224
where they want it to go.
Screaming bloody murder if anyone dares 

1071
01:01:27,531 --> 01:01:28,364
to question or worse oppose.
Both the Elementary Teachers Federation 

1072
01:01:34,670 --> 01:01:35,503
of Ontario,
which operates at the provincial slash 

1073
01:01:36,741 --> 01:01:41,180
state level and the Toronto District 
School board which operates at the level

1074
01:01:41,181 --> 01:01:42,014
of the city have explicitly adopted a 
social justice program and if 

1075
01:01:46,401 --> 01:01:47,234
implemented curriculum based on its 
principles from kindergarten through 

1076
01:01:50,301 --> 01:01:51,134
grade eight was similar programs 
operating in the remainder of junior 

1077
01:01:54,201 --> 01:01:55,034
high and high school.
The ETF oh elementary teachers remember 

1078
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:04,280
is equity oriented.
This means equality of outcome,

1079
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:05,173
not equality of opportunity,
and that is a radical left wing even 

1080
01:02:09,051 --> 01:02:13,430
marxists goal.
They described their own organization as

1081
01:02:13,431 --> 01:02:14,264
a quote,
Social Justice Union end quote and have 

1082
01:02:17,391 --> 01:02:18,224
produced educational material aimed in 
their own words at fostering a climate 

1083
01:02:22,501 --> 01:02:24,420
of social justice in Ontario.

1084
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:31,310
This material is part of the social 
justice begins with me initiative,

1085
01:02:31,770 --> 01:02:34,290
the ETF,
oh elementary teachers,

1086
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:36,810
Federation of Ontario claims.
Furthermore,

1087
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:41,940
that the education system is a key means
of delivering messages around inclusion,

1088
01:02:41,941 --> 01:02:42,774
diversity and welcoming environments.
They have developed a curriculum of 

1089
01:02:46,501 --> 01:02:50,580
children's literature aimed at 
delivering precisely this message,

1090
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:51,953
thus bending art as ideologues always 
due to the purposes of propaganda 

1091
01:02:56,970 --> 01:03:01,170
justified by their belief that their and
justify their means.

1092
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:02,933
The Social Justice and equity project 
encompasses all elements of the 

1093
01:03:06,871 --> 01:03:10,440
curriculum including language arts,
mathematics,

1094
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,020
science and technology,
and the arts.

1095
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:15,143
Even the very act of reading is taught 
from a neo Marxist slash postmodernist 

1096
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:20,093
radical left perspective as students are
encouraged after finishing a given book 

1097
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:25,343
to identify the power claims of the 
author and to know which groups have 

1098
01:03:28,651 --> 01:03:31,680
been excluded from consideration by that
author.

1099
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:34,373
The Toronto District School Board for 
its part has its own social justice 

1100
01:03:38,101 --> 01:03:41,400
action plan committed as it is to 
fairness,

1101
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:42,780
equity,
human rights,

1102
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:45,150
and economic egalitarianism.

1103
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:48,420
That is the slogan of a political 
manifesto,

1104
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:49,403
not a proper statement for an 
administrative board whose proper role 

1105
01:03:52,891 --> 01:03:55,620
is the local governance of the education
system.

1106
01:03:56,250 --> 01:04:01,250
No matter the t d s be unabashedly 
announces its progressive agenda with no

1107
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:02,604
consideration whatsoever given to the 
fact that indoctrination and education 

1108
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,420
exist at precyse cross-purposes to one 
another.

1109
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:10,973
Their policies continue.
The TDSB has a shared responsibility to 

1110
01:04:14,941 --> 01:04:18,750
contribute to positive social change 
both locally and globally.

1111
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:23,610
Learning about and engaging in social 
justice issues such as equity,

1112
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,920
diversity,
abuse against women,

1113
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:26,843
poverty reduction and Environmental Ism 
will make school a more relevant and 

1114
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:31,920
meaningful for all students.

1115
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:33,490
Okay.

1116
01:04:33,490 --> 01:04:36,660
And will also ensure as much as this can
be done by fee,

1117
01:04:36,661 --> 01:04:37,494
yet it's students within the system 
adopt the political stance deemed 

1118
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:44,000
appropriate by their administrators and 
teachers.

1119
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:45,943
Now make no mistake about it.
I know perfectly well that there is a 

1120
01:04:49,971 --> 01:04:50,804
need for right and left wing viewpoints,
the right as a proclivity towards 

1121
01:04:54,591 --> 01:04:55,424
counterproductive stacy's and sameness 
and has to be balanced by the more 

1122
01:04:59,181 --> 01:05:00,014
innovative thinking.
That is part and parcel of the 

1123
01:05:02,121 --> 01:05:06,320
psychological processes that also drive 
left wing political belief.

1124
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:08,083
So my objection to the indoctrination of
children by the state and city has 

1125
01:05:11,751 --> 01:05:12,584
nothing specifically to do with a 
dislike of the opinions of those who 

1126
01:05:16,191 --> 01:05:20,200
occupy what is after all half of the 
political spectrum.

1127
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:22,440
Yeah,

1128
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:27,000
but the fact that it's such views are a 
necessary part of Bellin's public debate

1129
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:27,953
by no means justifies transforming 
public education into a system of 

1130
01:05:31,801 --> 01:05:35,520
indoctrination.
And that is exactly what has happened.

1131
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,330
It has to stop.
It has to stop.

1132
01:05:39,331 --> 01:05:40,164
Now,
many people have already discussed with 

1133
01:05:41,581 --> 01:05:42,414
me their intent to pull their children 
out of the public education system 

1134
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:46,193
because of this transformation,
but that is not the proper solution 

1135
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:50,843
assistant belongs after all to the 
parents and children who use it and it 

1136
01:05:53,831 --> 01:05:54,664
does not.
Right that any faction bends its 

1137
01:05:56,041 --> 01:05:56,874
function to their own use.
So I'm going to recommend something 

1138
01:06:02,061 --> 01:06:02,894
radical.
I have no idea how to set the 

1139
01:06:05,301 --> 01:06:10,100
universities right in any simple manner.
Some of you know I've started working on

1140
01:06:10,101 --> 01:06:13,730
an online humanities university,
but that is a major project,

1141
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:16,670
unlikely to bear fruit until years in 
the future.

1142
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:18,350
Yeah,

1143
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:21,590
the humanities as they stand broadly 
speaking,

1144
01:06:21,591 --> 01:06:23,030
geography,
history,

1145
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:25,700
languages and literature,
Gender Studies,

1146
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,900
cultural studies as well as many of the 
social and applied sciences,

1147
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:32,390
anthropology,
sociology,

1148
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:37,420
social work as well as law and the 
faculties of education most specifically

1149
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:38,803
are occupied by radical left neo 
marxists who will stay in their 

1150
01:06:42,051 --> 01:06:44,450
positions for decades into the future.

1151
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:46,083
The corruption that characterizes their 
academic practices has spread widely 

1152
01:06:49,751 --> 01:06:50,584
into the general culture,
political and corporate as well as 

1153
01:06:53,351 --> 01:06:54,184
educational.
Although it is only the latter that 

1154
01:06:56,261 --> 01:06:57,094
concerns us at the moment.
I think the only real hope of 

1155
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:04,060
forestalling further deterioration of 
this sort that would require,

1156
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:04,894
for example,
large scale exodus from the public 

1157
01:07:06,671 --> 01:07:07,504
school system,
which I think is inevitable if present 

1158
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:13,240
trends continue is for the users of such
systems,

1159
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:14,163
school children and young adults and 
their parents to put a stop to its 

1160
01:07:17,531 --> 01:07:21,880
politicization.
We have now reviewed evidence indicating

1161
01:07:21,881 --> 01:07:22,714
widespread ideological corruption at the
level of the professoriate 

1162
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:29,770
administration,
university department,

1163
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:35,070
University and higher education systems 
in general as well as a refusal to admit

1164
01:07:35,861 --> 01:07:38,680
to that corruption and a proclivity to 
name,

1165
01:07:38,681 --> 01:07:43,681
call deride shame and protest when such 
issues are brought to light.

1166
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:45,120
Okay.

1167
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:45,953
Such corruption particularly although 
not uniquely typifies the faculties of 

1168
01:07:50,521 --> 01:07:55,170
education where those who teach your 
children are in turn taught.

1169
01:07:55,950 --> 01:07:56,783
Because of this,
the public education system has become 

1170
01:07:59,521 --> 01:08:04,140
politicized and that politicization is 
broadening and deepening,

1171
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:05,213
presenting social danger in the form of 
the involuntary indoctrination of 

1172
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:13,680
children and compromising the proper 
function of public education itself,

1173
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:14,813
which is the creation,
autonomous self governing free thinking 

1174
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:19,394
individuals.
So I am recommending the following 

1175
01:08:22,161 --> 01:08:27,161
concrete actions affected and concern 
families should first discuss the issues

1176
01:08:28,611 --> 01:08:29,444
and formulate a plan.
I think the following two books are 

1177
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:33,524
invaluable.
One more proximately locally and one 

1178
01:08:36,381 --> 01:08:37,214
more distally.
There's a book called understanding 

1179
01:08:39,921 --> 01:08:40,754
postmodernism by Steven our hex.
The whole book provides a good 

1180
01:08:44,481 --> 01:08:45,314
introduction to the problem,
but the first chapter in particular 

1181
01:08:48,051 --> 01:08:48,884
provides a solid overview.
I think the Gulag archipelago by 

1182
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:58,040
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn is also required 
reading for many reasons,

1183
01:08:58,820 --> 01:08:59,653
not the least of which is his masterful 
analysis of the relationship between 

1184
01:09:03,561 --> 01:09:04,394
radical left wing thinking and the 
absolute collapse into tyranny and 

1185
01:09:07,881 --> 01:09:08,714
catastrophe that characterized all such 
experiments in the course of the last 

1186
01:09:12,441 --> 01:09:14,120
125 years.

1187
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:22,290
More directly,
I think students should with the backing

1188
01:09:22,451 --> 01:09:23,284
of their parents if possible,
leave their junior high and high school 

1189
01:09:27,131 --> 01:09:30,700
classes.
If any of the following topics arise,

1190
01:09:31,090 --> 01:09:35,740
this means they should stand up notre 
objections to the content.

1191
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:39,970
This sounds like indoctrination to me 
rather than education,

1192
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:45,060
so I'm leaving and then leave.
Perhaps they could encourage a classmate

1193
01:09:45,251 --> 01:09:49,630
slash friend to videotape their actions 
and posted on Youtube.

1194
01:09:50,710 --> 01:09:54,670
It wouldn't take very many students 
performing such an act to produce a very

1195
01:09:54,671 --> 01:09:55,504
powerful effect and it is certain that 
many who won't have the courage to do 

1196
01:09:59,231 --> 01:10:00,064
so.
We'll agree secretly that such action 

1197
01:10:02,111 --> 01:10:02,944
was necessary.
Here are the topics I regard as 

1198
01:10:06,891 --> 01:10:10,280
indicative of indoctrination rather than
education.

1199
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:12,590
Diversity.

1200
01:10:13,890 --> 01:10:14,040
Okay.

1201
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:16,860
Inclusivity,
equity.

1202
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:21,090
Conveniently,
these form the acronym die,

1203
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:22,283
which is exactly what the philosophy 
underpinning their grouping and use 

1204
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:30,190
should be encouraged to do.
White privilege,

1205
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:33,910
systemic racism,
gender.

1206
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:37,553
I'm not claiming that there is nothing 
to be learned about such topics or even 

1207
01:10:40,621 --> 01:10:41,454
that they shouldn't be discussed.
What I am saying is if they are brought 

1208
01:10:44,221 --> 01:10:47,520
up in an elementary,
junior high or high school classroom,

1209
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:48,623
the odds are very high that the lesson 
to be learned will be one driven by 

1210
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:53,183
ideological slash propagandistic 
concerns rather than one aimed at the 

1211
01:10:57,211 --> 01:11:00,390
inculcation of knowledge,
wisdom or skill.

1212
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:01,960
Okay,

1213
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:05,500
here are the words again,
diversity,

1214
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,760
inclusivity,
equity,

1215
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:15,870
white privilege,
systemic racism and gender.

1216
01:11:17,450 --> 01:11:17,620
Okay.

1217
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:19,990
There will be mistakes made with such an
approach.

1218
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:20,943
Some who discussed issues such as 
inclusivity and equity are going to be 

1219
01:11:24,311 --> 01:11:25,144
more reasonable than others,
but that does not change the fact that 

1220
01:11:27,671 --> 01:11:28,504
the philosophy driving the pushing 
forward of such topics is essentially 

1221
01:11:32,350 --> 01:11:33,183
ideological and propaganda stick.
So I think such active resistance will 

1222
01:11:37,571 --> 01:11:42,571
get the point across very effectively.
It is too bad and to just come to this,

1223
01:11:44,230 --> 01:11:49,120
but in my opinion,
it has think long and hard about it.

1224
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:51,223
My feeling is this,
if effective action is not taken now to 

1225
01:11:54,831 --> 01:11:58,280
counteract the politicization of the 
public school curriculum,

1226
01:11:58,460 --> 01:11:59,293
the need for such action will merely 
increase and it will take much more to 

1227
01:12:03,171 --> 01:12:07,250
forestall the process later.
Pick your poison.

1228
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:09,120
Okay.

1229
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:13,710
Good luck the best you and your family 
and happy new year.
