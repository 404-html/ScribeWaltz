1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,130
Okay,

2
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,350
I started,
I started the beginning of the class 

3
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,750
three months ago talking to you about 
what it,

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,760
what the problem was that I was trying 
to address

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,320
and the fundamental problem was the 
problem of belief systems and the issue 

6
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:40,681
is was what precisely constitutes a 
belief system and then a secondary 

7
00:00:45,071 --> 00:00:50,071
question was why are people so inclined 
to even engage in conflict to maintain 

8
00:00:53,741 --> 00:00:58,741
and expand their belief systems and then
maybe a sub question of that and is 

9
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:04,141
there an alternative to conflict with 
regards to belief systems and then the 

10
00:01:04,991 --> 00:01:09,991
last issue was something like,
well is there a way of judging the 

11
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:13,870
relative quality of belief systems?
And so those are all very,

12
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:18,871
very complicated questions.
I mean the first one is something like 

13
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:26,550
how is it possible to understand the 
structures by which we orient ourselves 

14
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,971
in the world.
The second one is something like what's 

15
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:35,760
the psychological significance precisely
of those systems?

16
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:40,680
What role does it play in psychological 
health and maybe also in social health.

17
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:42,870
The next one is

18
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:50,610
can you make it non relativistic case 
when you assess an array of different 

19
00:01:50,891 --> 00:01:55,891
value systems and then linked to that is
is it possible to hierarchically 

20
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,240
organized value systems in a manner 
that's justifiable so that something can

21
00:02:04,121 --> 00:02:08,950
be reasonably considered in a superior 
or subordinate position?

22
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:15,420
Now,
the last question drew my attention 

23
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,110
because of the implications of the first
set and the last question drew my 

24
00:02:21,311 --> 00:02:26,311
attention because I was trying to sort 
out the metaphysics in some sense of the

25
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,050
Cold War.
The question was,

26
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,260
was this just a battle ground between 
two hypothetically,

27
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:43,410
equally appropriate belief systems which
could be a morally a moral relativistic 

28
00:02:44,471 --> 00:02:45,310
perspective,
right?

29
00:02:45,311 --> 00:02:50,311
It's belief systems are arbitrary and so
combat between them is in some sense,

30
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:56,011
inevitable and even more to the point 
there isn't any other way around the 

31
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:01,890
discontinuity in some sense than combat 
or subordination because there's no way 

32
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:08,611
of adjudicating a victor because there's
no such thing as victory.

33
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,440
If there's no way of ranking value 
systems.

34
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:16,750
It's arbitrary and it's a frightening 
prospect because it means that if you 

35
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,700
have a value system and I have a value 
system and they're different and they're

36
00:03:18,701 --> 00:03:23,701
different,
I mean we can talk or you can 

37
00:03:23,701 --> 00:03:23,710
subordinate yourself or I could do the 
same,

38
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,550
but there's also no reason why we 
shouldn't just didn't engage in flat out

39
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,840
conflict.

40
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,620
Now it's complicated in the modern 
world,

41
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:37,800
obviously by the fact that conflict can 
become so untrammeled that it risks 

42
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:43,111
destroying everything and that doesn't 
seem necessarily to be in anyone's best 

43
00:03:43,111 --> 00:03:46,090
interest and less your interest happens 
to be in destroying everything.

44
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:51,091
And certainly there are no shortage of 
people whose interests tilt in that 

45
00:03:51,091 --> 00:03:53,440
direction.
Alright,

46
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,110
so the first question was,
well,

47
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,720
what does it mean to have a belief 
system?

48
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,970
And that's a very complicated problem 
and I think

49
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,760
it's a subset of the question of being.
Maybe you can break the question of 

50
00:04:13,611 --> 00:04:18,611
being into two domains which we've done 
in this class and you could say,

51
00:04:19,161 --> 00:04:24,161
well you can assess being from the 
perspective of what exists and then you 

52
00:04:24,161 --> 00:04:28,310
can assess being from the perspective of
how you ought to act.

53
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,760
So it's like you walk into a room and 
you can describe the furniture or you 

54
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:38,030
can determine how you're going to 
conduct yourself in the room.

55
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,260
Maybe it's the difference between a play
and the stage setting for a play.

56
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,670
Now,
the modernist perspective,

57
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,540
roughly speaking,
is that the fundamental reality is to be

58
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,460
found in the description of the 
furniture,

59
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,130
so to speak,
in that description of what is.

60
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,540
That's the scientific

61
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:04,180
process and the scientific process seems
to involve the stripping off of the 

62
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:10,541
subjective from perception and to some 
degree from action and the extraction of

63
00:05:11,991 --> 00:05:16,991
the commonalities across perception as a
means of delineating the nature of 

64
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:24,401
reality.
Now obviously that's a very powerful 

65
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:28,570
process and it has many advantages,
but exactly what it is that science is 

66
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:33,821
doing is not precisely clear.
One perspective might be is that we are 

67
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,580
genuinely.
I'm discovering the nature of objective 

68
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,530
reality and perhaps even the nature of 
reality itself,

69
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:46,970
but there are some problems with that 
perspective.

70
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,340
One of them being that

71
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:56,190
the scientific process seems to strip 
the subjective from the phenomena.

72
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,130
It does technically,
right?

73
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:03,350
I mean you have a hypothesis about what 
something is and you have a hypothesis 

74
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,641
about what something is and you have a 
hypothesis about some what something is 

75
00:06:06,641 --> 00:06:10,360
and we undertake a number of procedures 
to assess what the fundamental phenomena

76
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:15,371
is and then we look across our 
perceptual sets and we extract out the 

77
00:06:15,371 --> 00:06:17,990
commonalities and we dispense with 
everything that is superfluous.

78
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:22,991
Everything that's merely subjective.
So what you feel about the chair is not 

79
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:24,650
relevant to the objective existence of 
the chair.

80
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:30,340
And so it eradicates subjectivity and 
that's a very useful process because it 

81
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:35,621
does seem to enable us to grasp reality 
in a fundamental sense more profoundly,

82
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:42,730
but it leaves the subjective behind and 
maybe that's a problem because they 

83
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,910
didn't make the noise.
Okay.

84
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:45,830
Okay.
Thank you.

85
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,120
I would have,
I just didn't want.

86
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,410
Alright,
appreciate it.

87
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,870
So.
So then the issue might be,

88
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:58,871
well it is something irretrievably lost 
if you dispense with this objective and 

89
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:04,930
and also how deep a hole you dig when 
you dispense with this objective.

90
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:13,590
And I think that that's an intrinsically
associated with the problem of the 

91
00:07:14,021 --> 00:07:19,021
relationship between is an ot,
because that's an old philosophical 

92
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,690
conundrum.
I think first put forth by Dave,

93
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:27,970
David Hume,
who made the claim that no matter how 

94
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,680
much you know about something from an 
empirical perspective,

95
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,780
you cannot use that as an unerring guide
to action in relationship to that,

96
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,130
to that empirical object or set of 
empirical objects and people.

97
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,450
It's a tricky issue,
you know,

98
00:07:40,451 --> 00:07:44,620
because obviously you can use empirical 
information to inform your decisions.

99
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,670
But I think.

100
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,120
But the problem is is that there's 
multiple pathways of action that are 

101
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,271
implied by any set of data.
That seems to be the fundamental 

102
00:07:57,271 --> 00:08:00,001
problem.
It's something like that is that you 

103
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:01,651
can't draw a one to one specification to
between the empirical districts 

104
00:08:01,651 --> 00:08:03,820
description and what you should do about
that.

105
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:08,821
And like maybe an example is where you 
can gather a lot of information about 

106
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:13,051
aids and you can gather a lot of 
information about cancer and you can 

107
00:08:13,051 --> 00:08:15,841
gather a lot of information about 
educational outcomes and economic 

108
00:08:15,841 --> 00:08:19,231
outcomes and so forth.
But it isn't obvious how you then use 

109
00:08:19,231 --> 00:08:21,130
that empirical information,
for example,

110
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:23,260
how to guide policy decisions because 
you might say,

111
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:28,261
well,
how much money should we spend on 

112
00:08:28,261 --> 00:08:29,521
education compared to cancer prevention 
and how much money should be spent on 

113
00:08:29,521 --> 00:08:33,280
cancer prevention compared to curing 
aids and or or addressing disease in the

114
00:08:33,281 --> 00:08:34,150
third world country.

115
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:39,330
What happens is that the set of 
variables that you encounter while 

116
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,901
trying to make your empirical 
calculation get to be so massive so 

117
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:46,441
rapidly that there doesn't seem to be 
any logical way of linking them to a 

118
00:08:46,441 --> 00:08:50,281
behavioral outcome.
That's kind of associated with the 

119
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:50,281
postmodern conundrum as well,
which is,

120
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:51,460
well,
if you have a set of data and it,

121
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,380
it could be a literary work for that 
matter.

122
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:58,710
There's a very large number of that you 
can derive from that set of data and 

123
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:02,811
there's no simple way of deciding which 
one is going to be canonical and so it 

124
00:09:02,811 --> 00:09:04,710
isn't it.
I think the reason that you can't derive

125
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:09,830
an ot from an ias is because you run 
into something like competent tutorial 

126
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:10,500
explosion.
It's like you have an infinite number of

127
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:12,480
facts at your disposal,
roughly speaking,

128
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:17,481
and then another infinite number of ways
that you can organize those facts and 

129
00:09:17,481 --> 00:09:21,020
that massive array of facts and and and 
recategorized facts doesn't tell you 

130
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:26,010
what to do in a given situation.

131
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,520
And so maybe the question of what to do 
in a given situation is a different 

132
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,070
domain of question and I,
I believe that to be the case.

133
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,610
I think it was Stephen Jay Gould who 
talked about religion and science as to,

134
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,950
I think he called them different 
magisterium.

135
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,980
Two different fundamental domains that 
and that each had their realm of 

136
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,630
operation and one was the description of
the objective world.

137
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:56,631
Obviously that's on the scientific end 
and the other was the realm of ethics 

138
00:09:56,631 --> 00:09:58,590
and so you could put religion,
mythology,

139
00:09:58,591 --> 00:09:59,970
narrative,
the humanities,

140
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,850
all of that history.
Even for that matter to some degree,

141
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:07,851
into the,
into the ethics category and because I 

142
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:14,241
don't see a straightforward way of 
taking a set of facts and then 

143
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:18,330
transforming them into a behavioral 
compulsion.

144
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,110
Then I do think that these two things 
are reasonably regarded as overlapping 

145
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,210
and intrinsically associated.
But,

146
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:32,070
but technically and philosophically 
separable.

147
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,360
All right,
so then then the next question emerges,

148
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:37,470
well,
if they're separable,

149
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:43,110
if there has to be a domain of inquiry 
into the structure of values,

150
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,230
what might that look like?
Like how is it that you would understand

151
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,980
the psychological and sociological 
phenomena that are associated with a 

152
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:00,780
moral stance?

153
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:04,720
How,
how would,

154
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,930
how would you understand the details of 
that and then even more to the point,

155
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:14,650
is there any way of subjecting different
sets of ethical interpretation to 

156
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,790
testing so that you can judge their 
comparative validity because that's sort

157
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:22,760
of the way out of moral relativism.
Roughly speaking.

158
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:27,790
It's like first you make the proposition
that there are value structures and that

159
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:33,221
they're independent from empirical 
investigation and then the next is that 

160
00:11:33,221 --> 00:11:37,271
you investigate the possibility that you
can compare and contrast different 

161
00:11:37,271 --> 00:11:39,860
structures of ethics and draw some sort 
of conclusion.

162
00:11:39,861 --> 00:11:44,861
That's not merely arbitrary.
Now it might be turtles all the way 

163
00:11:44,861 --> 00:11:45,320
down.
That's how the old joke goes.

164
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:45,800
Right?
But,

165
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:51,430
but maybe not.
And I was interested in that again 

166
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:51,430
because I thought,
well,

167
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:55,210
are we fighting the cold war merely 
because we're having an argument or is 

168
00:11:59,851 --> 00:12:04,851
there some manner in which one of these 
systems can be just determined to be 

169
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:10,041
wrong?
And of course there was more weight 

170
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:14,151
behind that query because the Soviet 
system and the system and the system 

171
00:12:17,221 --> 00:12:22,221
that's in place in North Korea,
we're not only predicated on different 

172
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:26,541
assumptions than the western system,
but they were also extraordinarily 

173
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:29,691
murderous.
And so that seemed to add additional 

174
00:12:29,691 --> 00:12:31,170
weight to the,
to the sequence of questions.

175
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:33,840
So

176
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,240
yeah,

177
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:43,500
I was reading young at the time and 
young was Carl young was fundamentally,

178
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,720
I would say a psychologist of narrative 
of story.

179
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:51,100
And and he,
he outlined this.

180
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:56,920
He outlined the idea for me that people 
inhabited stories,

181
00:12:56,921 --> 00:13:01,921
roughly speaking,
he said actually they inhabited myths 

182
00:13:01,921 --> 00:13:02,290
and even more to the point whether they 
knew it or not,

183
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:06,340
they inhabited archetipal myths or even 
that they were possessed by them.

184
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,410
And so it was the first time I'd really 
come into contact with the idea directly

185
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:16,411
put that there was a direct relationship
between the structures that you use to 

186
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,530
orient yourself in the world and 
stories.

187
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:26,190
And so then I started to assess the 
fundamental elements of stories,

188
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:29,410
what might a story looked like,
and while I was doing that,

189
00:13:29,411 --> 00:13:32,020
that was informed by a number of other 
things that I was reading about,

190
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:37,050
including a set of.
I read the neuroscience literature with 

191
00:13:39,761 --> 00:13:42,100
regards to information processing fairly
extensively.

192
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,740
And that introduced me to a whole set of
other ideas including cybernetic ideas 

193
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,491
which have been incorporated into what I
was describing to you in this basic 

194
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:56,001
cybernetic system is a system that has a
starting point in a system that has an 

195
00:13:56,001 --> 00:14:00,640
endpoint and a system that has a 
subsystem that monitors progress or 

196
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,410
deviation from progress along the 
pathway to the end point.

197
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:09,411
And I thought,
well that looks a lot like a story or 

198
00:14:09,411 --> 00:14:09,411
map.
That's another way of thinking about it.

199
00:14:09,411 --> 00:14:09,900
And I thought,
okay,

200
00:14:09,901 --> 00:14:14,901
well that's where the overlap is.
And the fundamental story is something 

201
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:14,901
like.
It's very straightforward.

202
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:19,700
It's,
it's also the frame that you inhabit 

203
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,671
when you conceptualize the world and 
narrow and narrow and simplify the 

204
00:14:22,671 --> 00:14:26,661
world,
which you have to do because it's so 

205
00:14:26,661 --> 00:14:28,131
complex because you have this infinite 
number of facts that are laying around 

206
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:31,701
you.
So what are you doing while you're a 

207
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:31,701
mobile creature,
living creature,

208
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:35,700
not a static information processor and 
your targeted.

209
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:38,610
You're a targeted creature and otherwise
you wouldn't move.

210
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:44,270
Right?
To move is to be a targeted creature 

211
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,281
because you have to move towards 
something or away from something so the 

212
00:14:46,281 --> 00:14:48,921
targeting is built right into the fact 
that you're a mobile creature and then 

213
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:48,921
you might say,
well,

214
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:49,560
what do you target?
And the answer to that is,

215
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,680
well,
you target your target.

216
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,020
You could say you target what you aim 
for,

217
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,460
but then you could say,
well,

218
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:57,410
you,
you aim for what you want.

219
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:02,830
You target your desires and then that 
leads you into a discussion of the 

220
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,660
underlying neurobiology.
Essentially you bring to the table a set

221
00:15:05,661 --> 00:15:10,661
of inbuilt desires and the targets that 
you pick have to address the fact that 

222
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:17,540
those desires exist in the desires are 
actually grounded in necessity.

223
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,040
And this is,
this is,

224
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:24,160
this is a sidebar,
but this is where I think piaget's 

225
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,711
theory is weaker than it should be 
because piaget and you know I'm a great 

226
00:15:26,711 --> 00:15:30,470
admirer of piaget,
believed that the human infant came into

227
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,200
the world with a fairly primordial set 
of reflexes,

228
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:37,070
mostly sensory motor reflexes,
and then boot strapped him or herself up

229
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,060
on the basis of those reflexes in the 
sociological,

230
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:47,140
in the in the social surround,
and so it's a constructivist view point 

231
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,130
that the child comes in with a few basic
elements that can get it going.

232
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,530
Elements of exploration and memory 
essentially,

233
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:57,010
and then it builds itself as a 
consequence of its exploration in the 

234
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:00,500
social community.
Now I think that's true except that it's

235
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:05,501
too empty because what it fails to take 
into consideration is the fact that,

236
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,940
and I think this is.
This is an observation in some sense,

237
00:16:10,941 --> 00:16:15,941
philosophically that was first made by 
Emmanuel Kant when he criticized pure 

238
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:19,310
reason so that you can't come into the 
world structureless.

239
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:24,340
You have to come into the world with an 
inbuilt structure and then it's the 

240
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,630
interaction of that structure with the 
world that provides the information that

241
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:31,631
you can use to build yourself,
but the structure has to be there and I 

242
00:16:31,631 --> 00:16:35,411
would say that's the same mythologically
speaking as the idea that the great 

243
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:35,510
father is always there,
right?

244
00:16:35,511 --> 00:16:36,800
There's the great mother is always 
there.

245
00:16:36,801 --> 00:16:39,110
That's chaos itself.
The great father is always there.

246
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:44,111
That's order,
that's the interpretive structure that 

247
00:16:44,111 --> 00:16:46,211
you use to interact with the chaos,
and then of course the individual is 

248
00:16:46,211 --> 00:16:49,571
always there at the same time,
and piaget in some sense re retold that 

249
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:55,301
story except he didn't give enough 
credence to the fact that the infant 

250
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:02,120
comes into the world far more fully 
formed than his theory.

251
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:09,250
His theory presumes now the problem.
See the problem with that is that 

252
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:11,570
without that additional underlying set 
of,

253
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:16,750
let's call them biological constraints,
the interpretation universe gets too 

254
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:21,401
large.
You need constraints to narrow the 

255
00:17:21,401 --> 00:17:26,081
domain of phenomena that you're 
contending with and and it's in the 

256
00:17:26,081 --> 00:17:30,560
analysis of the constraints that the 
answer to how do you stop drowning in an

257
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:34,010
infinite number of potential 
interpretations emerges.

258
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:40,270
The interpretations are subject to 
constraints and that's also the way out 

259
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,840
of the moral relativist paradox as far 
as I can tell.

260
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:46,841
Now.
One of the things I really liked about 

261
00:17:46,841 --> 00:17:48,221
piaget was that he described some of the
constraints was one of the constraints 

262
00:17:48,221 --> 00:17:50,320
was as well,
all right,

263
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:55,370
if I'm going to exist in a social world 
and I'm going to because I won't exist 

264
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:55,890
at all.
If I don't exist in a social world,

265
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:01,340
then there are constraints on the way 
that I have to interact with other 

266
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,891
people and and Psj is essential point 
was I have to organize myself to play a 

267
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:10,701
joint game with you,
but the game has constraints and one of 

268
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:14,451
them is you have to want to play because
you have other options and then there 

269
00:18:14,451 --> 00:18:14,520
are other constraints.

270
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,560
You and I have to be able to play in a 
way that other people don't object to or

271
00:18:19,561 --> 00:18:23,460
maybe even that you and I have to play 
in a way that other people will be,

272
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,290
uh,
will support.

273
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:30,740
And then you can imagine another 
constraint which is you and I have to 

274
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,921
play a game in a way that other people 
would support that will last more than 

275
00:18:33,921 --> 00:18:33,921
the moment.
So it has the law,

276
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,850
it has to work today and tomorrow and 
next week.

277
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:39,540
It has to work across the span of times.
It has to work not only for you and I,

278
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,430
but it has to work for our future 
selves.

279
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,470
And so the dam constraints are starting 
to pile up.

280
00:18:43,471 --> 00:18:47,100
That's just on the socio cultural side.
That's on the constructionist side only,

281
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:52,730
but there's the biological constraints 
are equally important because not only 

282
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:56,630
does the game that you and I have to 
play have to satisfy those emergent 

283
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,170
sociological constraints,
but the game also has to be organized so

284
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:05,490
that the internal polity that that's 
composed of,

285
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,240
let's call them the fundamental 
motivational and emotional systems that 

286
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:11,240
make that,
that,

287
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,570
that,
that constitute us.

288
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,590
They have to all find satisfaction 
because otherwise the system grinds to a

289
00:19:16,591 --> 00:19:21,591
halt and so this seems to me to be the 
beginnings of an answer to the 

290
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,060
postmodern conundrum.
It's like,

291
00:19:24,061 --> 00:19:29,061
okay,
any set of facts is amenable to an 

292
00:19:29,061 --> 00:19:29,061
infinite number of interpretations.
Fine.

293
00:19:29,061 --> 00:19:32,310
Got It.
That makes deriving an is from analog to

294
00:19:32,311 --> 00:19:34,830
a very difficult endeavor,
right?

295
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,390
No problem.
All right,

296
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:39,660
but that doesn't mean that any old 
solution will work.

297
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:41,340
Why?
Well,

298
00:19:41,341 --> 00:19:46,341
first of all,
it's merely because we introduced work 

299
00:19:46,341 --> 00:19:49,550
into the conversation to begin with.
The interpretation has to be functional 

300
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,730
and again,
that's what it seems.

301
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,040
That's what seems to tie it back to the 
story.

302
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:58,310
This is also what got me interested in 
pragmatism technically speaking and so 

303
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:02,601
because if,
if your conundrum is here you are and 

304
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:04,770
there you have to be and and how to get 
there.

305
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:10,040
Then one of the constraints on the 
manner in which you interpret the world 

306
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,580
is when you apply your interpretation,
do you end up moving from the point 

307
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,080
you're at to the point you want to be,
and if the answer to that is no,

308
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:18,180
then the solution is insufficient.

309
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:23,210
Now you could call the solution untrue,
but I it's dangerous to to to introduce 

310
00:20:23,341 --> 00:20:28,341
the truth or falsity dilemmas because 
because it isn't it's functionality,

311
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,020
more functionality,
more than truth.

312
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,690
Although I think you could say that in 
the final analysis,

313
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:37,290
truth is integrally linked to function,
but I'm not going to touch that question

314
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,920
for the time being.
The point is is that your interpretation

315
00:20:40,921 --> 00:20:45,921
of the world carries within it 
implicitly a theory about its own 

316
00:20:45,921 --> 00:20:49,341
validity and the theory about its own 
validity is that if you enact it in the 

317
00:20:49,341 --> 00:20:54,091
world,
it will produce the result that you 

318
00:20:54,091 --> 00:20:55,810
desire and then the consequence of that 
is that if it doesn't produce the result

319
00:20:55,811 --> 00:21:00,811
that you desire,
that it isn't good enough theory period 

320
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:04,080
and that's how you grapple with the fact
that although you don't know everything,

321
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,260
you still have to orient yourself in the
world.

322
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:14,100
You lay out partial theories that,
that make partial predictions and if 

323
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,781
they do a good enough job,
then you don't worry about it anymore 

324
00:21:18,781 --> 00:21:18,781
and you go onto the next thing.
Okay?

325
00:21:18,781 --> 00:21:23,221
So then you think there's a lot of 
constraints piling up on your 

326
00:21:23,221 --> 00:21:23,221
interpretations.
Number one,

327
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,850
they have to work for the creature that 
you are and so you know,

328
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,750
we can lay it sort of like maslow's 
hierarchy of needs.

329
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:33,751
Something like that's not exactly the 
same because I don't think that he got 

330
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:34,480
the hierarchy right for,
for very complex reasons,

331
00:21:34,481 --> 00:21:37,660
but it's,
it's reasonably obvious to,

332
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:42,690
to observe that well,
you're not going to work out very well 

333
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:42,940
if you don't have anything to eat and 
you know,

334
00:21:42,941 --> 00:21:47,941
you you've got about a week and you if 
you don't have anything to drink and 

335
00:21:47,941 --> 00:21:48,670
obviously you need shelter and you know 
you need,

336
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,800
you need companionship and by need.

337
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,660
What I mean is that if you don't have 
these things,

338
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:55,630
then you die.
The whole game comes to a halt so we can

339
00:21:55,631 --> 00:21:59,650
ground that in self evident reality 
without any real problem.

340
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:04,710
And you might say,
well what's the list of human 

341
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:04,710
necessities?
And that that's,

342
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,880
that's a difficult thing to parameterize
because you can argue about the degree 

343
00:22:09,941 --> 00:22:14,941
to which something is necessary,
but there's some things that we know 

344
00:22:14,941 --> 00:22:14,941
about.
Well,

345
00:22:14,941 --> 00:22:16,810
we covered the basics,
temperature regulation,

346
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,310
elimination,
food,

347
00:22:18,311 --> 00:22:19,600
intake,
shelter,

348
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,720
right?
But then there's more subtle things 

349
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:24,720
like,
well,

350
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,660
children,
for example,

351
00:22:25,661 --> 00:22:27,870
die without touch,
so there's.

352
00:22:27,871 --> 00:22:32,440
There's something integral about tactile
interaction with other people,

353
00:22:32,441 --> 00:22:34,510
so we could call that love if you want 
to do that's.

354
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,250
It's not optional,
right?

355
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:41,460
Play is the same thing.
Children do not develop properly unless 

356
00:22:42,131 --> 00:22:47,131
they played,
and I would say that adults also can't 

357
00:22:47,131 --> 00:22:49,330
maintain their mental health or physical
health unless they play too.

358
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,220
And so you can say,
well,

359
00:22:51,221 --> 00:22:54,580
there's a core set of necessities,
and then off of that there's a secondary

360
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,780
set of like,
what would you call them?

361
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,010
They're not ultimate necessities,
but they're pretty high.

362
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:05,040
They're going to be pretty highly valued
by people and more or less universally 

363
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,620
pain avoidance.
For example,

364
00:23:05,621 --> 00:23:10,621
under most circumstances,
most people don't really like to be in 

365
00:23:10,621 --> 00:23:13,981
terror.
Most people really don't like to be 

366
00:23:13,981 --> 00:23:13,981
disgusted.
You know,

367
00:23:13,981 --> 00:23:17,310
you can lay out the basic emotions,
you can lay out the basic motivations 

368
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:17,310
and you can say,
well,

369
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:21,930
the game that you're going to play has 
to operate within this space that's 

370
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:22,360
defined by that set of a priory 
constraints.

371
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:27,900
Fine.
Now things are getting pretty 

372
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:27,900
constrained here.
So they had the game,

373
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:32,041
you play house to satisfy that set of 
biological demands,

374
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:38,070
intrinsic biological demands,
and it has to be something that you can 

375
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:42,390
utilize with other people voluntarily 
and it has to be something that will be 

376
00:23:43,301 --> 00:23:48,301
playable across multiple iterations and 
I would say there's a very limited 

377
00:23:48,711 --> 00:23:53,450
number of interpretive interpretive 
structures that are going to satisfy all

378
00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:55,160
of those preconditions simultaneously.

379
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,330
And to me that just blows out the the 
two things.

380
00:23:59,331 --> 00:24:03,080
It blows out the claims of moral 
relativism and it it,

381
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,010
it also demotions and this is the same 
thing in some sense.

382
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:12,460
It demolishes ideas that the manner in 
which people organize themselves in the 

383
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,110
world as individuals and as societies is
somehow arbitrary.

384
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:20,770
It doesn't look to me to be arbitrary at
all and so in is genius.

385
00:24:20,811 --> 00:24:25,100
I think in some part was observing that 
in children's spontaneously in that when

386
00:24:25,101 --> 00:24:30,101
children past the egocentric phase,
which means after they were about two 

387
00:24:30,711 --> 00:24:34,290
years of old or they're maybe they're 
what?

388
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:39,330
They're approaching three years old,
they've more or less got their internal 

389
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:42,730
mechanisms organized so that they're a 
unitary being.

390
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:48,480
Roughly speaking at three.
They start to develop the ability to use

391
00:24:48,731 --> 00:24:53,731
fictional frames of reference,
so and that's an interesting thing 

392
00:24:53,731 --> 00:24:57,511
because I would say that the fundamental
biological systems come armed with their

393
00:24:58,001 --> 00:25:00,250
own frame of reference,
so if you're hungry,

394
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:03,880
poof,
up comes a frame of reference and within

395
00:25:03,881 --> 00:25:08,881
that your perceptions are shaped,
the action proclivities are

396
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:15,800
rr primed and the world lays itself out 
around that particular biological 

397
00:25:16,241 --> 00:25:19,240
necessity and you can lay those out.
Same if you're thirsty,

398
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:24,450
same if you're too hot,
same if you want to play all those 

399
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:27,571
systems come built in,
but then the problem with that is that 

400
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:33,060
they compete because it isn't obvious 
which one should take priority and then 

401
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,540
it's not that easy to organize them in a
social space.

402
00:25:34,541 --> 00:25:39,541
And so what seems to have happened to 
human beings is that we've been able to 

403
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:42,361
replace the frame that's predicated on 
motivational necessity with abstracted 

404
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:49,510
frames that are more voluntary,
voluntarily constructed that incorporate

405
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,910
multiple motivational systems 
simultaneously.

406
00:25:51,911 --> 00:25:56,911
And that's in some sense.
That's also what it's the same thing as 

407
00:25:56,911 --> 00:26:00,211
we've learned how to think abstractly 
and so the frame that you're going to 

408
00:26:00,211 --> 00:26:00,310
lay out on the world,
if it's a good frame,

409
00:26:00,311 --> 00:26:04,990
is one that solves a whole set of 
problems at the same time and so that,

410
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:07,330
and you can slot different frames.

411
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,300
You can.
You can experiment with different frames

412
00:26:10,301 --> 00:26:15,301
and that's a precondition to being able 
to play because one of the things that 

413
00:26:15,301 --> 00:26:18,601
Piaget pointed out,
you can see this when children pretend 

414
00:26:18,601 --> 00:26:20,860
play is like for an even more clearly in
in games that have rules,

415
00:26:20,861 --> 00:26:23,860
but let's say they're in pretend play 
and they're going to say,

416
00:26:23,861 --> 00:26:28,861
well,
we're going to lay out a little 

417
00:26:28,861 --> 00:26:30,330
fictional schema here.
We're going to play out and you can be 

418
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:30,330
the cat and I'll be the.
I'll be the dad,

419
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:35,370
and then you negotiate a bit to see if 
those rules are acceptable and then you 

420
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:39,241
run it as a simulation and that's what 
kids are doing when they're playing and 

421
00:26:39,241 --> 00:26:42,480
they're experimented with different 
super ordinate frames of reference that 

422
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,250
are accessible in the world and they're 
in there.

423
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:49,340
They're learning how to develop those 
perceptual schemes and also how to 

424
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,910
interact in a manner that allows the 
scheme that they're using to find it 

425
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:55,650
social acceptability and it's 
successful.

426
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,400
The child assumes that the scheme is 
successful if both children have fun 

427
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:08,751
while they're doing it,
and so that's the volunteerism and so 

428
00:27:08,751 --> 00:27:11,901
piaget made a very interesting point 
about that that I think is absolutely 

429
00:27:11,901 --> 00:27:11,901
brilliant.
He said that

430
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:18,590
there's a difference between a game that
people will play voluntarily and one 

431
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:22,140
that has to be enforced and so then you 
can imagine an environment where gay may

432
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:27,141
is played voluntarily,
it has a certain end and game b is 

433
00:27:27,141 --> 00:27:30,171
played by force,
but both of them are moving towards the 

434
00:27:30,171 --> 00:27:33,651
same end and Piaget's claim was the game
that's played voluntarily or even more 

435
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:39,230
to the point.
The set of all games that are played 

436
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:42,201
voluntarily will outcompete the set of 
all games that are played by force if 

437
00:27:42,201 --> 00:27:44,040
they're put head to head in a 
competitive environment.

438
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:45,420
I thought,
God,

439
00:27:45,421 --> 00:27:50,421
that's such a brilliant observation 
because there you have the basis for a 

440
00:27:50,421 --> 00:27:53,910
pragmatic grounding of for the 
evaluation of ethics.

441
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It's like you can pick the target,
it doesn't matter whatever target you 

442
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,441
pick.
If the game is voluntary and aimed at 

443
00:28:03,441 --> 00:28:05,961
the target,
it will defeat a game that's imposed by 

444
00:28:05,961 --> 00:28:05,961
tyranny.

445
00:28:05,961 --> 00:28:07,350
Now it's a proposition,
but it's a pretty good proposition.

446
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,740
I would say there's a fair bit of 
evidence for this proposition and a fair

447
00:28:10,741 --> 00:28:14,340
bit of it is actually derived from 
observation of animal behavior because I

448
00:28:14,341 --> 00:28:17,550
ran you guys through the emerging 
literature on this stability,

449
00:28:17,551 --> 00:28:22,551
say of chimpanzee hierarchies and the 
chimpanzee tyrant hierarchy isn't very 

450
00:28:23,311 --> 00:28:28,311
stable and the reason for that is that 
to subordinate chimps who are three 

451
00:28:28,311 --> 00:28:32,310
quarters as strong as the dominant 
tyrant can take them out and they do,

452
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,960
and so then the question might be,
well,

453
00:28:33,961 --> 00:28:38,460
how do you have to conduct yourself as a
high dominance chimp if you're not going

454
00:28:38,461 --> 00:28:43,461
to be torn apart by those who are 
hypothetically your subordinates and 

455
00:28:43,461 --> 00:28:44,220
answer to that is,
well,

456
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,530
don't be too much of a tyrant.

457
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:53,230
Formulate some social connections.
Engage in some reciprocity with regards 

458
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:56,360
to your social relationships.
Don't oppress the females,

459
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,640
don't torment the children,
et Cetera,

460
00:28:58,641 --> 00:29:03,641
et Cetera,
because that makes you unpopular and 

461
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:06,191
then you'll get torn to shreds and so 
there are practical limits on the 

462
00:29:06,191 --> 00:29:11,171
expression of tyranny that are a 
consequence both of biological 

463
00:29:11,171 --> 00:29:14,981
limitations because people are going to 
object if the system is set up so that 

464
00:29:14,981 --> 00:29:19,631
their fundamental needs aren't met and 
they're also going to object if the game

465
00:29:20,031 --> 00:29:22,940
that's being played isn't functioning 
socially and so this is very,

466
00:29:22,941 --> 00:29:26,390
very tight set of constraints and then 
the question might be,

467
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:28,400
okay,
if you take that set of constraints,

468
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:33,410
what sort of systems can operate,
what would you say?

469
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:39,070
Well,
just that what set of systems can 

470
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:39,070
operate within those sets of 
constraints.

471
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:43,510
Then you might say if you take that set 
of all systems that might operate within

472
00:29:43,511 --> 00:29:46,420
those constraints and you look at what's
common across them,

473
00:29:46,421 --> 00:29:50,290
then you could extract out what's 
essentially a universal morality.

474
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:55,740
It's something like that and I don't see
how that proposition is precisely 

475
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:00,691
questionable.
It seems to me that all of that's built 

476
00:30:00,691 --> 00:30:02,971
on rock.
It's like there's no doubt that infants 

477
00:30:02,971 --> 00:30:06,841
bring biological necessity to the table.
I think that's fully established and 

478
00:30:06,841 --> 00:30:10,960
it's established physiologically.
It's established behaviorly.

479
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:16,510
It's established with regards to 
evolutionary history because we can take

480
00:30:16,511 --> 00:30:20,110
the motivational systems that are part 
and parcel of our being and we can trace

481
00:30:20,111 --> 00:30:23,890
their development back in some cases,
half a billion years,

482
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:29,340
so.
So the idea that the infant is a blank 

483
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:33,361
slate when it's born and thus subject,
infinite sociological manipulation is a.

484
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,310
it's a.
it's dead in the water.

485
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,280
That's just not the case,
so okay,

486
00:30:39,281 --> 00:30:44,281
so far,
so we've got that nailed down hard and 

487
00:30:44,281 --> 00:30:48,421
then the idea that your identity is also
shaped sociologically.

488
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,280
While I don't think anybody disputes 
that,

489
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:53,620
it doesn't matter where they are on the 
interpretive framework.

490
00:30:53,621 --> 00:30:58,621
They might dispute the degree to which 
that occurs and the mechanisms by which 

491
00:30:58,621 --> 00:31:02,200
it occurs,
but the fact that it occurs that's.

492
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,680
That's close enough to self evidence so 
we can just leave it there.

493
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,100
Well then the question is what are the 
consequences of the,

494
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,970
of sociological,
of associate,

495
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,140
of socialization,

496
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:16,600
and

497
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:23,420
once you admit to the existence of the 
realm of biological necessity,

498
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:28,370
you instantly put a set of constraints 
on how society is constructed themselves

499
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:30,440
so that they will not be

500
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:36,810
torn down and overthrown with that.
If you look at how kids are socialized,

501
00:31:37,751 --> 00:31:41,440
I think that Piaget's developmental 
observations are buying by,

502
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:46,441
correct the first two years.
It's mostly interactions between the 

503
00:31:46,511 --> 00:31:48,220
infant and the parents.
Um,

504
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:53,540
it's,
it's bi-directional though because the 

505
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:53,540
infant has to come to terms with the 
mother,

506
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,470
but the mother also has to come to terms
with the infants.

507
00:31:55,471 --> 00:31:59,620
So it's not even top down at the level 
of infant maternal relationship.

508
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:04,650
Quite the contrary.
If you watch a new mother adapt to a 

509
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:08,071
baby,
you can see that the mother is doing as 

510
00:32:08,071 --> 00:32:10,621
much adaptation to the baby as the baby 
is to the mother because the infant has 

511
00:32:10,621 --> 00:32:14,851
this inbuilt character already and has 
to be charmed into a relationship that's

512
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,590
love.
Does that and,

513
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:22,620
and detention.
It's very little different than 

514
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:22,620
establishing a relationship with someone
who's older.

515
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:26,290
It's,
it's lower resolution and it's harder to

516
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:29,500
make the observations because of course 
the infant is only capable of behavioral

517
00:32:29,501 --> 00:32:31,480
display count,
can't speak,

518
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:36,690
but nonetheless,
the necessity for establishing the 

519
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:36,690
individual relationship is there to 
begin with.

520
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:39,680
So even in the early stages of the 
infants socialization,

521
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,380
the process isn't state downward.
It's not great father downward.

522
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:49,420
It's mutual and then of course by the 
time the child is old enough to be 

523
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:54,701
launched out into the social world than 
all the constraints that are associated 

524
00:32:54,701 --> 00:32:59,501
with the playground are immediately 
placed on that child and that's a very 

525
00:32:59,501 --> 00:32:59,501
unforgiving landscape,
right,

526
00:32:59,501 --> 00:33:04,360
because the last thing a child wants 
really the last thing that child wants 

527
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,991
is not to have any friends or even 
perhaps equally seriously not to have a 

528
00:33:08,271 --> 00:33:09,810
best friend.
Huh?

529
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:12,740
Not read something so idiotic the other 
day that I couldn't believe it.

530
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:17,330
So the newest prince,
so Queen Elizabeth,

531
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:22,420
I guess great grandchild is off to 
daycare and in the UK and in this 

532
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:26,621
daycare,
they don't let the kids have best 

533
00:33:26,621 --> 00:33:26,621
friends because that's unfair.
I thought,

534
00:33:26,621 --> 00:33:26,930
you know

535
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:32,040
something times you see something that's
so stupid you can't even believe it.

536
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:33,480
It it,
it exists.

537
00:33:33,481 --> 00:33:36,810
And that was one of those examples 
because it's been known for quite a long

538
00:33:36,811 --> 00:33:41,811
time that one of the developmental 
milestones that children attain 

539
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:47,660
somewhere between say the age of five 
and 10 is they pick a best friend and so

540
00:33:47,761 --> 00:33:52,761
they and,
and you know the hypothesis well that's 

541
00:33:52,761 --> 00:33:52,860
unfair to all the other children.
It's like,

542
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:55,020
well first of all,
you can't be the best friend to everyone

543
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:58,230
because you then maybe there is a 
billion children,

544
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:03,260
so each of them gets one second.
It's like that's just not a very deep 

545
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:06,201
relationship.
So the idea that you can be equally 

546
00:34:06,201 --> 00:34:07,620
friendly with everyone is.
It's a preposterous,

547
00:34:07,621 --> 00:34:08,850
but even worse.
The thing is,

548
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:12,120
the thing that the child is doing is 
actually becoming.

549
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:17,920
They're stepping out of their 
egocentricity because they're best 

550
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:17,970
friends becomes more important than they
are.

551
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:23,360
And that's a precursor for adult 
relationships where you know if you're 

552
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,691
married while your partner should be at 
least as important as you are and the 

553
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:28,590
relationship should be more important.
But then when you have children,

554
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:31,080
it's like they're more important than 
you that that's that.

555
00:34:31,081 --> 00:34:33,000
It's unless there's something wrong with
you,

556
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,270
you come second in.
Your children come first and they're way

557
00:34:36,271 --> 00:34:37,370
first.
They're not just a little.

558
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,600
I mean you're necessary because without 
you,

559
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,730
they're not going to manage,
so you have to take care of yourself,

560
00:34:41,731 --> 00:34:45,270
but you're not number one anymore.
Once you have kids and less seriously,

561
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:50,450
unless you didn't learn the lessons in 
the playground and when you have a best 

562
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:50,450
friend,
you're not number one.

563
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,880
They are.
And so,

564
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,110
so anyways,
there are these constraints that emerged

565
00:34:55,111 --> 00:34:56,970
in the,
in the social landscape,

566
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:02,510
you have to have friends and also you 
have to single someone out as 

567
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:06,410
particularly unique among those friends 
and establish a genuinely reciprocal and

568
00:35:06,451 --> 00:35:11,451
caring relationship.
I can't remember the psychiatrist who 

569
00:35:11,451 --> 00:35:14,481
studied this so intently.
Unfortunately he was the first person to

570
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:21,530
do a detailed analysis of the best 
friend relationships that children 

571
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:21,940
established.
It's,

572
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,350
I'd like to give him credit for his 
ideas,

573
00:35:24,351 --> 00:35:26,180
but unfortunately I can't remember his 
name.

574
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:30,380
So.
Okay.

575
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:33,470
So what are the proposition so far?

576
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,980
You inhabit a.
The door emc in the

577
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,980
world,
it has something that's akin to a 

578
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:42,980
narrative structure.
I'm here,

579
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,680
I'm going there,
and this is the way I did it.

580
00:35:43,681 --> 00:35:45,210
It's narrative,
if you describe it,

581
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,560
it's based in biological necessity,
but it's shaped by social socialization 

582
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:56,330
and the fact of of that base and that 
shaping means that the set of 

583
00:35:57,091 --> 00:36:00,930
interpretive Schema that you can lay out
in the world are bounded.

584
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:07,210
Those would be functional hypothetically
functional systems and maybe they 

585
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:09,240
compete over over the evolutionary time 
span,

586
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:14,780
but there's something in common across 
that set of functional interpretations 

587
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:19,071
and if you extract that out,
you can get the initial images of what 

588
00:36:19,071 --> 00:36:21,390
you might describe as an archetype.
Lee,

589
00:36:21,391 --> 00:36:25,620
universal morality.
That's what archetypes are fundamentally

590
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:31,490
so and to say all that is no more than 
to say that people can obstruct across 

591
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:36,230
instances and we can obviously do that.
So then the question is can you start to

592
00:36:36,871 --> 00:36:40,920
develop an articulated picture of what 
that archetipal

593
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:45,450
structure of universal morality might 
be?

594
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:49,260
And so my answer to that was basically,
well,

595
00:36:49,261 --> 00:36:52,680
let's look at old stories,
as many old stories as we can collect,

596
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,640
and if the stories are stories that have
survived for a very long period of time,

597
00:36:56,641 --> 00:36:57,940
so much the better because it,
it,

598
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:58,620
it,
it,

599
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:03,740
that indicates that they're peculiarly 
memorable and peculiarly functional,

600
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:08,520
because if they weren't memorable than 
they'd have been forgotten.

601
00:37:08,521 --> 00:37:13,521
And if they weren't functional,
they wouldn't have managed to be the 

602
00:37:13,521 --> 00:37:16,851
foundation stories for,
for cultures that lasted for thousands 

603
00:37:16,851 --> 00:37:18,420
or even tens of thousands of years.
So,

604
00:37:18,421 --> 00:37:19,440
and then we could say,
well,

605
00:37:19,441 --> 00:37:24,441
let's collect a whole variety of these 
stories and see if there's patterns 

606
00:37:24,441 --> 00:37:24,441
across the.
Now the danger of that is,

607
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,390
have you collected an unbiased set of 
stories?

608
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:34,600
Danger number one.
How do you know that you're not just 

609
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:34,600
reading into the stories that's the 
postmodern problem,

610
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:36,770
reasonable,
reasonable objections.

611
00:37:36,771 --> 00:37:40,550
And so that those objections have been 
laid against people like,

612
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:44,810
um,
he wrote the golden bough Fraser,

613
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,420
who was the frazier,
who was one of the first anthropologists

614
00:37:47,421 --> 00:37:52,421
to collect stories from all over the 
world and to start to look for 

615
00:37:52,421 --> 00:37:55,091
commonalities.
The same objection has been laid at the 

616
00:37:55,091 --> 00:37:56,960
feet of people like Richard Lee or Carl 
young or Joseph Campbell.

617
00:37:56,961 --> 00:37:59,240
It's like,
how do you know you just how do you know

618
00:37:59,241 --> 00:38:01,730
you're not just cherry picking your damn
interpretations?

619
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,330
Perfectly reasonable,
perfectly reasonable objection,

620
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:10,750
and I would say that the reason I don't 
believe that I'm Cherry picking my 

621
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,810
interpretations is because I used a 
method.

622
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:17,900
It's a method that's akin to the 
multitrack multi-method method of 

623
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,611
construct validation that that clinical 
psychology and other disciplines of 

624
00:38:21,611 --> 00:38:26,171
psychology rely upon,
but it's also akin to a process put 

625
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:27,500
forward by Eo Wilson that he called 
consilience,

626
00:38:27,501 --> 00:38:30,530
and the process is something like,
well,

627
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,300
pick your level of analysis.

628
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,890
Does the phenomena manifest itself at 
that level of analysis?

629
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:41,010
Yes.
Pick another level of analysis and 

630
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:43,231
another level of analysis and another 
level of analysis and see if the same 

631
00:38:43,231 --> 00:38:46,591
phenomena manifests itself at every 
single level and then assume that the 

632
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:51,181
probability that that will happen by 
chance decreases with each additional 

633
00:38:51,181 --> 00:38:55,000
level of analysis that fits that where 
there's concordance and I thought,

634
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:55,660
okay,
that,

635
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,980
that,
that makes sense.

636
00:38:56,981 --> 00:39:01,981
So it isn't only that you can look for 
patterns and stories because you know 

637
00:39:01,981 --> 00:39:06,060
what?
If you're a hyperactive pattern 

638
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,441
detector,
which basically means like there are 

639
00:39:07,441 --> 00:39:07,441
people like that,
people who tilt towards paranoia,

640
00:39:07,441 --> 00:39:08,860
people who tilt towards conspiracy 
theories,

641
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,920
you could see it manifest itself in new 
age thinking all the time.

642
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:17,170
Then because new age thinkers are very 
high in openness but not very good at 

643
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,280
critical thinking and so they see so now
I'm going to a and B and c and d,

644
00:39:18,281 --> 00:39:19,150
they think pattern.

645
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:24,490
Then they think universal pattern,
but they don't attempt to disconfirm 

646
00:39:24,611 --> 00:39:29,611
their pattern prediction.
And so what I tried to do when I was 

647
00:39:29,611 --> 00:39:32,851
starting to see patterns emerge in the 
stories in informed by people like you 

648
00:39:32,851 --> 00:39:37,021
and Eliana and so forth was to see if 
what they were describing manifested 

649
00:39:37,021 --> 00:39:41,221
itself at any other levels of analysis.
That we're independent intellectually 

650
00:39:41,221 --> 00:39:43,780
from that stream of thinking.
And I found it in two places.

651
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:49,020
I found to cybernetics and I found it in
neuroscience and so and and that,

652
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,220
that and the neuroscience element.
That includes the physiology,

653
00:39:54,221 --> 00:39:59,221
but also the behavioral analysis that 
was done by by people most particularly 

654
00:39:59,221 --> 00:40:03,601
like like like Jeffrey Gray and the 
animal experimentalists who were 

655
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:07,441
brilliant,
brilliant scientists and who've done a 

656
00:40:07,441 --> 00:40:09,751
very good job of laying out the manner 
in which interpretive frameworks exist

657
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:14,670
within the realm of animal cognition and
and,

658
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,530
and to describe how they manifest 
themselves in the world.

659
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,430
So I thought,
okay,

660
00:40:18,431 --> 00:40:19,450
that's not too bad.
You've got.

661
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:24,451
We've got maybe four different levels of
evidence all pointing in the same 

662
00:40:24,451 --> 00:40:28,471
direction.
And so that's why I walked you guys 

663
00:40:28,471 --> 00:40:30,961
through the neuro psychology.
It's like a story is you're going 

664
00:40:30,961 --> 00:40:34,531
somewhere,
you're somewhere and you're going 

665
00:40:34,531 --> 00:40:34,531
somewhere and you're tracking your 
progress.

666
00:40:34,531 --> 00:40:35,110
Okay?
That's the story.

667
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:35,820
Well,
what,

668
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,430
what happens when you look at how people
lay out there called cognitive maps,

669
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:44,820
while it's the same thing you specify a 
target and endpoint is you specify a 

670
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,030
beginning point,
which is just where you are,

671
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,360
and then there's a mechanism,
a comparative mechanism that operates or

672
00:40:49,361 --> 00:40:53,860
multiple comparitor mechanisms that 
operate neuro physiologically.

673
00:40:53,861 --> 00:40:58,720
To Orient Yourself towards that goal and
the emotions basically emerge as a,

674
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:04,070
as a consequence of that positive 
emotions indicating that you're moving 

675
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:07,321
forward properly negative emotions 
indicating that you've encountered some 

676
00:41:07,321 --> 00:41:07,321
kind of obstacle.
It's like,

677
00:41:07,321 --> 00:41:08,020
well,
that's the basic.

678
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,140
That's the basic structure of a 
narrative.

679
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:11,890
Okay,
fine,

680
00:41:11,891 --> 00:41:14,650
so now we can see how it's instantiated 
neurophysiologically.

681
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:19,480
That adds a fair bit of credence to the 
to the entire process,

682
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:20,740
so

683
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,730
now normally when you look at the basic 
cybernetic work,

684
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:39,050
there's a hypothesis that the system is 
oriented towards a goal and that it's 

685
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:45,791
comparing what is manifesting itself in 
the world to that desire to instate as 

686
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:49,640
the system moves,
but it's too simple because people don't

687
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:54,641
precisely have gold.
They have nested hierarchy of goals and 

688
00:41:55,131 --> 00:42:00,131
so the issue of emotional regulation 
becomes more complex than are you 

689
00:42:04,501 --> 00:42:09,501
proceeding happily towards your current 
goal because your goal is composed of 

690
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:14,960
micro goals and it's a constituent 
element of a set of macro goals,

691
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:20,360
and so that makes the problem of error 
far more complex than it would be if you

692
00:42:20,761 --> 00:42:24,210
only had one frame of reference and you 
were only adjudicating your error within

693
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:29,211
that frame of reference.
The question starts to become what does 

694
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,200
it mean when you make a mistake?

695
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,680
And the answer to that,
the behavioral answer to that was,

696
00:42:36,681 --> 00:42:41,681
well,
you encounter a stimuli that's a threat 

697
00:42:41,681 --> 00:42:43,340
or maybe a punishment or an incentive 
reward or a conservatory reward,

698
00:42:43,341 --> 00:42:45,050
something like that.
It's very,

699
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:50,500
it's a.
it's a unit dimensional and 

700
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,590
oversimplified answer,
I'm not complaining about it has great 

701
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:53,300
utility,
but there's the problem,

702
00:42:53,301 --> 00:42:58,301
there's a problem and the problem is it 
doesn't take into account the nested 

703
00:42:58,301 --> 00:42:59,870
structure of this,
of your goal hierarchy.

704
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:04,900
And what that means is that it 
underestimates the difficulty of 

705
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:09,401
responding to an error.
Because the problem with an error is 

706
00:43:09,401 --> 00:43:14,081
that you don't know what the error 
signifies and that's a huge problem and 

707
00:43:14,081 --> 00:43:16,430
that's part of what I want to delve into
even in more depth today,

708
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:19,640
and so this is like Alice in wonderland 
going down the rabbit hole.

709
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:22,000
It's exactly the same thing.
That's the hole.

710
00:43:22,001 --> 00:43:24,720
The rabbit hole is you made a mistake,
right?

711
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:30,010
You made a mistake.
You've got your oversimplified 

712
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:30,010
representation of the world laid upon 
it.

713
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:33,740
It validates itself in its execution.
If it executes properly,

714
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:37,310
if it executes improperly,
then what does that signify?

715
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:40,730
And the answer isn't precisely that 
you've made a mistake.

716
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:45,350
The answer is it signifies that there's 
something in the world that you excluded

717
00:43:45,351 --> 00:43:50,351
that shouldn't have been excluded,
and that's a big problem because when 

718
00:43:50,351 --> 00:43:52,910
you've laid out a simplified schema on 
the world,

719
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:58,240
you've excluded virtually everything.
And so what that means is that as soon 

720
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,651
as you make an error,
the search space for the error 

721
00:44:02,651 --> 00:44:04,760
immediately tends towards the infinite 
and you experienced that and it's,

722
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:05,880
it's,
it's part of it.

723
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,410
Human existential experience and the way
you experienced that is,

724
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,220
especially if your mood is shaky,
is you lay out a small plan,

725
00:44:13,221 --> 00:44:18,221
like maybe you go out for coffee with 
someone that you're romantically 

726
00:44:18,221 --> 00:44:19,750
interested in and they're,
they're,

727
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,660
they're not,
uh,

728
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,950
they're not pleasant to you.

729
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:24,710
And,
and so that scenario it means,

730
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,000
well,
what does it mean?

731
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,890
Well,
you've construed yourself wrong.

732
00:44:27,891 --> 00:44:31,740
You've construed them wrong,
you've construed the opposite sex wrong.

733
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,800
You've construed human beings wrong,
you're a walking catastrophe and you 

734
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,220
might as well not even exist.
It's like,

735
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:38,850
well,
that's,

736
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,370
that's pretty extreme,
but it's not that extreme.

737
00:44:41,371 --> 00:44:46,371
I'll tell you like it's,
it's not that uncommon for people to 

738
00:44:46,371 --> 00:44:49,740
have exactly that set of catastrophic 
responses to even a minor setback.

739
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:53,310
Now it's not good for them.
And I would say no,

740
00:44:53,311 --> 00:44:58,311
just because you scraped your foot 
doesn't mean you should dig a grave and 

741
00:44:58,311 --> 00:44:58,620
jump into it.
Pull the dirt on,

742
00:44:58,790 --> 00:44:59,840
on top of you.
You know,

743
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,390
so you don't want to start by taking 
yourself completely apart,

744
00:45:03,391 --> 00:45:05,160
but that doesn't mean people won't do 
it.

745
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:07,170
They do it all the time.
In fact,

746
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:09,030
to me,
it's always a mystery that they don't do

747
00:45:09,031 --> 00:45:14,031
it every single time because the logical
inference for why didn't you get someone

748
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:19,311
interested in you could easily be 
because you're a failure as a human 

749
00:45:19,311 --> 00:45:20,940
being and at some level that's actually 
true.

750
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:21,730
Now it's,
ah,

751
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:23,850
it's true in a way that's not that 
helpful,

752
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:26,220
right?
Because it's just too catastrophic,

753
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:31,550
but it isn't obvious at all how people 
can defend themselves against that 

754
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:31,780
cascade of,
of,

755
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,270
of Ka,
Ka,

756
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:34,020
Ka,
Ka,

757
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,400
catastrophizing.
I mean,

758
00:45:35,401 --> 00:45:37,110
after all,
if you are everything you could be,

759
00:45:37,111 --> 00:45:38,910
then maybe everyone would be attracted 
to you.

760
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,630
I mean perhaps not,
but you get the point and no and no easy

761
00:45:42,631 --> 00:45:45,180
rationalization is going to let you just
brush that away,

762
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:50,570
especially if you actually happen to be 
interested in the person because that's 

763
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:50,910
even worse because then not only are you
rejected,

764
00:45:50,911 --> 00:45:55,911
but you're rejected by someone who's who
upon whom you've projected an ideal or 

765
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:01,020
perhaps on from whom you've actually 
observed an ideal.

766
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:02,150
So it's worse.
You're,

767
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:07,380
you're rejected by someone that you want
to have be attracted to you to validate 

768
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:10,740
your own miserable existence.
It's not a trivial problem,

769
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,850
so you're in this protected space that 
I,

770
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:24,490
you know,
I made an analogy between that and the 

771
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:26,331
garden of Eden or the city that Buddha 
was raised in.

772
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:29,670
It's all protected and everything inside
of this beautiful and functional,

773
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:34,700
and that's by definition because if your
frame of reference is working properly,

774
00:46:35,551 --> 00:46:38,430
then what's within it is things you 
control,

775
00:46:38,431 --> 00:46:40,320
that are functional and,
and,

776
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,400
and,
and,

777
00:46:41,401 --> 00:46:44,100
uh,
and they are serving your purposes.

778
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:44,500
So

779
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:48,450
when you're successful,
you're in the garden of Eden.

780
00:46:48,451 --> 00:46:49,920
That's one way of thinking about it.
When,

781
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:52,380
when the things that you're laying out 
in the world are delivering what they're

782
00:46:52,381 --> 00:46:55,200
supposed to deliver,
that's what you inhabit.

783
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,440
But the problem is,
is that there's always the snake inside 

784
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,811
the garden and it's,
that's the story that's echoed in the 

785
00:47:02,811 --> 00:47:02,811
story of Buddha.
In that case.

786
00:47:02,811 --> 00:47:05,100
It's Buddha's own curiosity that happens
to be the snake.

787
00:47:05,101 --> 00:47:07,290
And you could actually say the same 
thing about human beings.

788
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:10,290
Maybe it wasn't the snake.
Maybe it was eve's curiosity.

789
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:16,570
They're the same thing in some sense.
And so it's Buddhist curiosity that 

790
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:18,450
drives them outside the city to find 
disease.

791
00:47:18,451 --> 00:47:23,451
And death and to blow apart his 
paradisical conceptualization of the 

792
00:47:23,451 --> 00:47:27,471
world.
And so when we're looking at you for 

793
00:47:27,471 --> 00:47:30,090
universality,
the first thing we might say as well,

794
00:47:30,091 --> 00:47:32,290
if you have a frame of reference that 
you've laid on the world,

795
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:32,860
it's a story.

796
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:35,860
You live inside a story and the second 
thing we could,

797
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:39,100
and that's universally true,
the content of the story can differ.

798
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:40,990
That's okay,
I don't care about that.

799
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:43,700
It's the structural equivalence that I'm
interested in.

800
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:48,670
You live inside a story and you have to 
do because you have to live in something

801
00:47:48,671 --> 00:47:53,671
like that because you are goal directed 
and you have to be and you have to 

802
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:57,241
simplify the world because you're just 
not enough of you to take into account 

803
00:47:57,241 --> 00:47:58,810
everything at once.
In fact,

804
00:47:58,811 --> 00:48:03,811
you could hardly take into account 
anything at once so you don't have to 

805
00:48:03,811 --> 00:48:07,651
narrow things unbelievably and by 
narrowing and including only certain 

806
00:48:08,231 --> 00:48:11,290
things,
you exclude virtually everything else.

807
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:16,291
So you're always in the problem in this 
situation where you have this little 

808
00:48:16,291 --> 00:48:18,280
bounded universe that you inhabit,
but outside of it is chaos itself.

809
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:24,230
And,
and so that's the existential landscape 

810
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:27,130
order surrounded by chaos,
right?

811
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:28,780
It's like a tree.
It's like the,

812
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:32,050
the,
the evolutionary home of primates,

813
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:35,700
the tree with the snakes on the ground.
That's,

814
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:40,710
that's our landscape or it's the fire 
for tribal people and the terrorists of 

815
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:43,090
the forest that are beyond the,
that are beyond the.

816
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:48,720
The light that the fire casts.
It's explored territory versus 

817
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,730
unexplored territory and that's,
that's an archetype as well that,

818
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:55,090
that you can't not be in a situation 
where that's the case.

819
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,060
Even if you're among friends,
you know,

820
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:04,230
you think that's explored territory.
That's not exactly right because what 

821
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:07,231
happens if you're among friends is that 
they carefully reveal new parts of 

822
00:49:07,721 --> 00:49:12,721
themselves all the time.
So it's like they're blasting little 

823
00:49:12,721 --> 00:49:16,240
elements of unexplored territory 
territory at you constantly.

824
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:18,880
And if they don't,
then what happens?

825
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:24,750
You get bored and you look for New 
People and we know there's empirical 

826
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:29,101
data on that with regards to intimate 
relationships because there was a nice 

827
00:49:29,101 --> 00:49:32,641
study done awhile back showing that 
looking at the ratio of positive to 

828
00:49:32,641 --> 00:49:37,351
negative emotional experiences that were
most predictive of long term 

829
00:49:37,351 --> 00:49:37,351
relationship success.

830
00:49:37,351 --> 00:49:41,640
And the answer was,
now obviously it depends on how you 

831
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:44,020
would measure an event and how you would
measure positive and negative emotion.

832
00:49:44,021 --> 00:49:48,460
But that aside,
the finding was something like if you're

833
00:49:48,461 --> 00:49:53,461
in a relationship and you only have five
positive interactions to one negative 

834
00:49:53,461 --> 00:49:55,420
interaction,
then the relationship will land.

835
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:00,600
It's too negative.
But if you have more than 11 positive 

836
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,380
interactions to one negative 
interaction,

837
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:06,430
then it also ends and you think,
well that's pretty bloody peculiar.

838
00:50:06,431 --> 00:50:07,870
Why?
Why in the world would that be?

839
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:12,040
Don't you want like a 100 to one 
positive to negative interactions?

840
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:17,280
And the answer to that is what makes you
think that you wanted to relationships 

841
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,240
so that you can be happy or at least 
happy moment to moment.

842
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:24,340
Why do you think that it's not?
It's certainly not the case is that you 

843
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:24,510
know that too.
Because I'm,

844
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:29,540
I mean I bet you there's not a person in
this room who hasn't rejected someone 

845
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:30,530
because they were too nice to them.

846
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:33,170
Something like that person's no 
challenge.

847
00:50:33,171 --> 00:50:38,171
It's something like that.
You want someone who you know you can 

848
00:50:38,171 --> 00:50:41,411
get along with them,
but now and then they bite you and you 

849
00:50:41,411 --> 00:50:41,411
think,
oh,

850
00:50:41,411 --> 00:50:41,411
that's,
that's interesting.

851
00:50:41,411 --> 00:50:43,490
You know I didn't really expect that,
and then you go and puzzle over it for a

852
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:45,200
while.
You get tortured yourself about it,

853
00:50:45,201 --> 00:50:50,201
and that's one of the things that keeps 
you really linked into the relationship 

854
00:50:50,201 --> 00:50:53,651
and the reason for that is that part of 
the reason that you want the 

855
00:50:53,651 --> 00:50:53,930
relationship isn't so that you're happy 
right now.

856
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:59,100
It's so that you can live a high quality
life across multiple decades and so 

857
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:04,181
you're looking for someone that you have
to contend with who's going to push you 

858
00:51:04,181 --> 00:51:08,231
beyond what you already are and who's 
going to judge you harshly often for 

859
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:12,611
your limitations.
Now that'll make you angry and all of 

860
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:15,131
that you'll know and resentful and maybe
you'll take your revenge and all of 

861
00:51:15,131 --> 00:51:19,241
that,
but you don't want someone who thinks 

862
00:51:19,241 --> 00:51:19,460
you're perfect in your current forum.

863
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:22,520
Partly because why would you want to go 
out with someone that diluted?

864
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:28,240
So okay,
so you've got this interpretive Schema 

865
00:51:29,631 --> 00:51:34,631
laid out on the world and it excludes 
the entire world and because it excludes

866
00:51:34,821 --> 00:51:39,821
the world,
the world tends to manifest itself 

867
00:51:39,821 --> 00:51:43,370
inside that protected space on a in an 
uncontrollable manner,

868
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:49,450
and that can take you down and it takes 
you down the rabbit hole and down the 

869
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:52,130
rabbit hole is where everything is 
because when you make an error,

870
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:57,230
what that is is the manifestation of the
excluded world and the problem with that

871
00:51:57,231 --> 00:51:59,750
is that's too much,
right?

872
00:51:59,751 --> 00:52:02,510
Because if you step out of the lifeboat 
into the ocean,

873
00:52:02,511 --> 00:52:05,180
then you drown and that's,
that's not any good.

874
00:52:05,181 --> 00:52:10,070
You can't drown every time something 
manifests itself that you didn't expect.

875
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:15,620
There has to be a mechanism for 
orienting you in the face of error.

876
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:20,720
All right,
so what exactly does that imply?

877
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:24,590
The question is what you discover when 
you go down the rabbit hole.

878
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,620
I was thinking about that a lot today.

879
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:37,890
I showed you that diagram that I thought
was like a map of the phenomenal logical

880
00:52:37,891 --> 00:52:42,891
world.
The lowest resolution category is 

881
00:52:42,991 --> 00:52:46,050
something like the dragon of chaos.
And so you might say,

882
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:51,590
well,
what do you discover when you make an 

883
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:51,590
error?
And the answer is,

884
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:52,650
first,
it's a brief manifestation of the dragon

885
00:52:52,651 --> 00:52:57,651
of chaos,
and that's no more to say than when you 

886
00:52:57,651 --> 00:53:01,740
encounter the incursion of unexplored 
territory into explored territory.

887
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:07,010
The circuitry you use is the same 
circuits that we use to to respond 

888
00:53:08,701 --> 00:53:12,330
instantaneously to the presence of 
predatory forces.

889
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:18,020
We use that circuit and that makes 
perfect sense because the Predator is 

890
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:21,531
almost by definition,
the thing that lurks beyond the safe 

891
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:24,891
confines of the community.
And I told you I believe a story about 

892
00:53:24,891 --> 00:53:27,600
rats raised in naturalistic 
environments.

893
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:33,860
The rats are.
It's got the burrows on one end of the 

894
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:33,860
little field.

895
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:37,960
They're little rat hierarchy.
They're doing their little rat social 

896
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:37,960
things.
They're playing and they're laughing and

897
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,300
they're tickling each other and they're,
they're,

898
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:40,980
you know,
raising the rat families.

899
00:53:40,981 --> 00:53:44,280
And that's all working out just fine.
Rats in that situation,

900
00:53:44,281 --> 00:53:49,281
by the way,
are very difficult to get addicted to 

901
00:53:49,281 --> 00:53:49,281
cocaine.
If you want a dick,

902
00:53:49,281 --> 00:53:51,150
the rat to cocaine and you have to put 
it in a cage at isolated,

903
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:56,600
it's not really a rat anymore than any 
more than you're a person if you're in 

904
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:56,600
solitary confinement,
right?

905
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,170
I mean you're sort.
You're mostly,

906
00:53:58,171 --> 00:54:00,690
you're just misery.
Anyways.

907
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:04,470
In solitary confinement,
you'd be after cocaine nonstop and maybe

908
00:54:04,471 --> 00:54:06,780
under other circumstances,
but like a normal rat.

909
00:54:06,781 --> 00:54:11,070
It's not that interested in cocaine.
So that's just a side note.

910
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:16,160
Anyways,
the rats are doing their thing and then 

911
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:16,470
they've learned that they can go out to 
the other side of the field and they can

912
00:54:16,471 --> 00:54:20,760
get food and so one day the 
experimenters,

913
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:25,950
instead of putting food out there and 
put a cat out there and the rat goes out

914
00:54:25,951 --> 00:54:28,110
and gets a whiff of the cat,
which they do not like.

915
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:33,110
And then the rat runs home and pokes his
beak out of the borough and screams for 

916
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:36,090
like two days ultrasonically and all the
other rats are like frozen stiff.

917
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,800
Because of that.
They're not going anywhere.

918
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:42,320
And so a two day rat screaming fit is no
trivial thing that be.

919
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:46,050
I calculated that'd be the equivalent of
use screaming for two weeks,

920
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,260
so you have to be pretty upset to scream
for two weeks.

921
00:54:49,261 --> 00:54:51,240
Right,
so this is hard on the wrap,

922
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:56,360
but the reason I'm telling you this is 
the route doesn't expect the cat to be 

923
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,150
there.
The rat goes out and there was a cat and

924
00:54:57,151 --> 00:55:01,710
what it uses its Predator detection and 
alert systems to signify the presence of

925
00:55:01,711 --> 00:55:04,470
the cat and what we've done with the 
dragon imagery,

926
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:09,471
roughly speaking,
is making a Mailgun of predatory bond 

927
00:55:09,471 --> 00:55:12,541
stirs and state.
That's a symbol for what lurks beyond 

928
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:13,470
safety because we're.

929
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:18,610
We're observing our own responses in 
some sense and it's not only that we're 

930
00:55:18,871 --> 00:55:23,871
observing our own responses,
but we also have a category categorical 

931
00:55:23,871 --> 00:55:25,530
set of responses to Predator and we,
again,

932
00:55:26,070 --> 00:55:29,470
there's no speculation about this.
We already know this,

933
00:55:29,471 --> 00:55:31,740
like if you go studied monkeys,
for example,

934
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:37,400
they have distinct sets of vocalization 
that are associated with Predator 

935
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:42,231
detection that have distinct circuits.
We know that there are Predator 

936
00:55:42,231 --> 00:55:46,341
detection circuits and it's not 
unreasonable to also presuppose that 

937
00:55:46,341 --> 00:55:48,120
they underlie the phenomena,
for example,

938
00:55:48,121 --> 00:55:50,670
that human beings are very good at 
learning fear to snakes.

939
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:53,880
Snake fear might be innate like that's 
pushing the argument,

940
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:59,150
but at minimum psychologists have 
already concluded that even if snake 

941
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:00,480
fear isn't an eight,
and it probably is,

942
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:04,860
that it can be learned like that.
So you can condition people to be afraid

943
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:09,861
of pictures of snakes way faster than 
you can condition them to be afraid of 

944
00:56:11,011 --> 00:56:12,960
pictures of electrical outlets are 
handguns,

945
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:15,900
so that's well documented.

946
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,450
I don't think anybody disputes that at 
all.

947
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:23,600
So the first assumption is when 
something unexpected emerges,

948
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:29,970
so we'll call that the snake in the 
garden that you're prey and Predator in 

949
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:33,250
the monster has come to get you.
It's something like that.

950
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Now the representation of the dragon is 
more complex than mere monster because 

951
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,740
the dragon,
the mythological dragon also is the 

952
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:45,340
thing that hoards treasure.
And I really liked that symbol.

953
00:56:45,341 --> 00:56:47,680
I think it's.
I think that's also why it will never go

954
00:56:47,681 --> 00:56:52,681
away.
It's such a great symbol because it 

955
00:56:52,681 --> 00:56:52,681
says,
well,

956
00:56:52,681 --> 00:56:52,930
the unknown can take you down,
it can,

957
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:56,530
it can bite you with its fiery breath,
like a poisonous snake,

958
00:56:56,531 --> 00:57:01,531
and it can burn things like fire and 
it's an aerial Predator that can take 

959
00:57:01,531 --> 00:57:05,911
you from the air and it's a carnivorous 
Predator that can take you from the 

960
00:57:05,911 --> 00:57:05,911
ground and it's Reptilian.

961
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:09,580
It's the sort of thing that can pull you
down into the water and it's easy to see

962
00:57:09,581 --> 00:57:14,581
that as an amalgam of of the threats 
that have been laid forth for human 

963
00:57:14,581 --> 00:57:19,030
being since the beginning of time and 
and monster is an amalgam of Predator,

964
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:19,840
and you might say,
well,

965
00:57:19,841 --> 00:57:21,370
there's no such thing as a dragon.
It's like,

966
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:22,030
yes,
there is.

967
00:57:22,031 --> 00:57:27,031
It's just a loose category.
What's common across all predators 

968
00:57:27,031 --> 00:57:30,130
equals dragon.
It's not like it's not.

969
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,690
They're not real.
They're hyper real.

970
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:33,970
They're more real than the phenomena 
themselves.

971
00:57:33,971 --> 00:57:36,880
Just like an abstraction can be more 
real than the phenomenon of themselves,

972
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:40,240
and then the canonical dragon for human 
beings isn't just a predator.

973
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:45,300
We're not rabbits.
You can imagine that the dragon for a 

974
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:47,680
rabbit is just a dragon.
There's no damn treasure there at all,

975
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:52,890
but for human beings it's ambivalent 
because the thing that you don't know 

976
00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:56,290
about is also the thing that holds the 
greatest gift and why is that?

977
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:01,440
It's because the unrealized world 
manifests itself when you make an error 

978
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,110
and the unrealized world is something 
that can take you down obviously,

979
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:07,840
but it's also the source of all new 
information.

980
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:13,710
It's an infinite source of information 
and that's a really useful thing to 

981
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:16,921
know.
Error is an infinite source of 

982
00:58:16,921 --> 00:58:19,261
information and that's one of the things
that can help you recalibrate the way 

983
00:58:19,261 --> 00:58:21,430
that you interact with the world.
You think,

984
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:22,600
well,
we're interacting.

985
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:28,830
Let's say we're having a conversation 
and it's flowing melodically and all of 

986
00:58:28,841 --> 00:58:31,180
a sudden I say something and there's a 
disjunction,

987
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:32,740
right?
You're offended by it.

988
00:58:32,741 --> 00:58:35,290
There's some negative emotion that comes
up or or,

989
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,250
or,
or,

990
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:38,320
you know,
maybe I've said something to impress you

991
00:58:38,321 --> 00:58:43,321
or to be arrogant and you respond badly.
It's like we've got this melodic thing 

992
00:58:43,321 --> 00:58:47,521
going on.
It's a conceptual frame and something 

993
00:58:47,521 --> 00:58:49,660
pokes itself up to put a disjunction in 
the conversation.

994
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:50,860
It's like,
well,

995
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:54,730
that's where the inflammation is.
It's like something went wrong,

996
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:57,700
something didn't work out.
I'm not looking at the world properly or

997
00:58:57,701 --> 00:59:02,170
I don't know you well enough for as well
as I thought there's something there and

998
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:04,690
if I have any sense,
I'm going to focus my attention on that,

999
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:06,700
like not obsessively or anything like 
that,

1000
00:59:06,701 --> 00:59:11,701
but that's where all the information is 
because as long as what we're doing is 

1001
00:59:11,701 --> 00:59:14,140
working,
then we both know enough already.

1002
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,320
As soon as what we're doing together 
isn't working,

1003
00:59:17,321 --> 00:59:19,840
then that's instant evidence that 
there's something about us that needs to

1004
00:59:19,841 --> 00:59:21,470
be updated and you might think,
well,

1005
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:23,660
that's a terrible thing,
and the answer is yes,

1006
00:59:23,661 --> 00:59:25,160
of course it is.
It's a terrible thing,

1007
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:30,400
but it's also the thing,
and this is the next stage of the 

1008
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,070
development of this,
let's call it universal morality.

1009
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:36,370
It's like the universal morality might 
be found in the answer to the question,

1010
00:59:37,131 --> 00:59:38,750
what should you do when you make a 
mistake?

1011
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:42,620
Now,
one answer is catastrophic disillusion.

1012
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:45,950
That's,
that's a collapse into chaos.

1013
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:50,210
While that's no one is going to pick 
that voluntarily,

1014
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,810
let's put it that way.
It's an unbelievably unpleasant,

1015
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:59,680
terribly anxiety provoking,
shameful and painful all at the same 

1016
01:00:02,781 --> 01:00:05,210
time.
Worse,

1017
01:00:05,211 --> 01:00:10,211
it can mean the absence of positive 
emotion because if you really collapse 

1018
01:00:10,211 --> 01:00:11,300
into chaos,
not only are you overwhelmed by negative

1019
01:00:11,301 --> 01:00:14,300
emotion,
but the positive emotion system shut off

1020
01:00:14,301 --> 01:00:18,800
and that's what happens to someone who's
extraordinarily depressed and also hyper

1021
01:00:18,801 --> 01:00:23,801
anxious at the same time.
Not only are they suffering from an 

1022
01:00:23,801 --> 01:00:27,371
excess of negative emotion,
but they've got no incentive movement 

1023
01:00:27,371 --> 01:00:27,770
forward whatsoever.
Okay,

1024
01:00:27,771 --> 01:00:32,771
so that's not an optimal solution 
because it takes you out the other 

1025
01:00:32,771 --> 01:00:36,851
possible,
and so I would call that a nihilistic 

1026
01:00:36,851 --> 01:00:37,400
solution or a chaotic solution.
It's not a solution.

1027
01:00:37,401 --> 01:00:42,401
It's a disillusion and you can think 
about it as a precursor to a potential 

1028
01:00:42,401 --> 01:00:46,481
solution,
but it's very easy to get stuck there 

1029
01:00:46,481 --> 01:00:47,120
and that's why Jonah could have stayed 
in the belly of the whale along with all

1030
01:00:47,121 --> 01:00:50,210
the other people that were eaten by the 
whale and never got back out.

1031
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:52,370
And you see people like that all the 
time.

1032
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:56,480
Their error has come along,
blown out their frames of reference.

1033
01:00:56,481 --> 01:00:59,180
They've collapsed into the underworld,
into the chaotic underworld,

1034
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:04,390
and they don't know how to get out.
They have posttraumatic stress disorder 

1035
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:06,170
or they're depressed or they're hyper 
anxious or or they're.

1036
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:11,380
They're resentful and aggressive and 
destructive like there's any number of 

1037
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:16,780
states of being that can overwhelm you 
when the bottom has fallen out of your 

1038
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:21,551
life,
so it isn't something that people are 

1039
01:01:21,551 --> 01:01:21,551
going to.

1040
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:24,050
It's not an optimal solution,
let's put it that way.

1041
01:01:24,051 --> 01:01:24,400
Well,
the,

1042
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:29,650
the other,
that's a nihilistic solutions a 

1043
01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:30,530
collapse.
The other solution is

1044
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:35,270
we're talking and I don't get what I 
want from you,

1045
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:37,760
and so I say,
you better not do that again.

1046
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:42,020
I don't want to see that from you again 
and starts a tyrannical attitude,

1047
01:01:42,021 --> 01:01:47,021
right?
What I'm going to do is I'm going to 

1048
01:01:47,021 --> 01:01:48,080
take my universe of order and its 
predictions and I'm going to say,

1049
01:01:48,290 --> 01:01:50,900
you go along with this or I'm going to 
punish you,

1050
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:53,130
and that's,
that's a.

1051
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:58,480
Now there is an element in society like 
society is made up of threats like that.

1052
01:02:00,981 --> 01:02:05,981
To some degree.
It's an erotica bowl in eradicable part 

1053
01:02:05,981 --> 01:02:10,181
of society.
That would be the tyrannical aspect of 

1054
01:02:10,181 --> 01:02:10,181
the Greek king,
let's say,

1055
01:02:10,181 --> 01:02:14,040
you know,
we we've organized a set of punishments 

1056
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:14,040
and threats that keep each of us in 
alignment.

1057
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:16,310
However,
generally speaking,

1058
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:21,580
in a society that's functional,
we've decided to adopt agreement with 

1059
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:23,760
that set of principles more or less 
voluntarily and we say,

1060
01:02:23,761 --> 01:02:25,650
well,
you have rights and responsibilities and

1061
01:02:25,651 --> 01:02:29,310
I have rights and responsibilities and 
I'm willing to pay a price for years,

1062
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,580
including the acceptance of punishment 
if I transgress,

1063
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:35,640
but you're going to do the same for me,
so there are.

1064
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:40,760
There are intelligent ways that 
punishment and threat can be used and 

1065
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:44,121
bound it so,
but that could easily degenerate into 

1066
01:02:44,121 --> 01:02:48,261
tyranny and one of the methods that I 
can choose to use if I don't want to 

1067
01:02:48,261 --> 01:02:52,941
encounter error is just to enforce my 
will on everyone else and I think when 

1068
01:02:53,071 --> 01:02:58,071
that happens personally and in the 
family and in the community and in the 

1069
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:02,070
state all at the same time,
then you get the emergence of a tyranny

1070
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:03,430
and

1071
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:09,020
so I would consider those to 
counterproductive

1072
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:13,570
reactions to the emergence of the 
unrealized world.

1073
01:03:13,930 --> 01:03:17,860
It's like you say something.
I do like a collapse completely.

1074
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:21,820
Children don't like other children who 
do that by the way.

1075
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:27,180
Right?
Something that's very interesting to 

1076
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:29,191
observe,
so let's say kids have organized 

1077
01:03:29,191 --> 01:03:32,131
themselves to play a little game of 
baseball with a plastic bat and a ball 

1078
01:03:32,131 --> 01:03:35,850
and you know one child pitches and the 
other child hits the ball and the child 

1079
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:39,931
catches it and puts the,
puts the batter out and the batter 

1080
01:03:39,931 --> 01:03:39,931
bursts into tears.
Well,

1081
01:03:39,931 --> 01:03:44,350
what happens is the other kids,
you know the first time that happens,

1082
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:46,660
they'll be sympathetic.
The third time that happens,

1083
01:03:46,661 --> 01:03:48,760
they won't invite that kid out to play 
baseball anymore,

1084
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:55,240
so the answer to we're not getting along
is not you get to burst into tears and 

1085
01:03:55,670 --> 01:04:00,670
and,
and manifest extraordinary emotional 

1086
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:03,191
distress because if you do that,
no one's going to want to play with you 

1087
01:04:03,191 --> 01:04:06,440
and that's a lesson that many people 
could stand learning.

1088
01:04:06,441 --> 01:04:11,441
Again,
one of the things I think that's really 

1089
01:04:11,441 --> 01:04:13,151
destabilizing our society right now 
maybe is that I'm not sure that kids 

1090
01:04:13,191 --> 01:04:18,191
have been encouraged or allowed to play 
enough in the last 25,

1091
01:04:19,041 --> 01:04:24,041
30 years and I think a lot of this 
identity stuff is actually fantasy play.

1092
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:29,560
It's delayed fantasy play because it's 
sort of what you do when you're seven 

1093
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:29,560
years old.
It's like,

1094
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:30,380
well,
I'm going to be this identity.

1095
01:04:30,381 --> 01:04:35,381
That's what you're doing when you're 
pretend you're going to go along with 

1096
01:04:35,381 --> 01:04:35,381
that because we're going to play this 
out.

1097
01:04:35,381 --> 01:04:35,381
It's like,
that's fine.

1098
01:04:35,810 --> 01:04:37,460
You don't impose that though,
right?

1099
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:39,110
Not Not.
If you're a kid that has a clue,

1100
01:04:39,111 --> 01:04:44,111
you invite people to play.
You don't insist on your identity and 

1101
01:04:44,111 --> 01:04:48,401
their compliance with it.
It's not a playable game and you don't 

1102
01:04:48,401 --> 01:04:52,931
burst into tears and runoff when someone
won't play your game because then they 

1103
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:54,170
won't play with you and then you have to
turn to force and that's.

1104
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:56,120
That's fine if that's what you want to 
do,

1105
01:04:56,121 --> 01:04:59,300
but you better look out because you 
better be ready to use it.

1106
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:05,640
This creating universal morality through
responsible making sure because this 

1107
01:05:10,330 --> 01:05:15,330
search or a better this structure being 
from a programmatic perspective,

1108
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:20,860
the does come with responsibility of 
making sure that people are trapped.

1109
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:25,000
Perhaps the medical leave structuring 
somewhere else,

1110
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,220
but we have a responsibility that 
against.

1111
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:33,080
Good question.
I mean that's part of the question that 

1112
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:35,990
in some sense motivated in some sense 
motivated the American incursion into 

1113
01:05:36,331 --> 01:05:38,190
Iraq.
Right?

1114
01:05:38,430 --> 01:05:40,950
So what's our responsibility in 
relationship to tyranny?

1115
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:42,300
That's a good question.

1116
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:49,840
Feminists are getting this for 
protesting about the petition of human 

1117
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:52,820
and say Saudi Arabia.
Yeah.

1118
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:53,430
Yeah.
Well,

1119
01:05:53,431 --> 01:05:58,431
I think that's.
I think that criticism is more emerging 

1120
01:05:58,431 --> 01:05:58,431
because of.
Because it's apparently.

1121
01:05:58,431 --> 01:06:02,550
It's apparently paradoxical in they've 
laid out a set of principles to which in

1122
01:06:02,551 --> 01:06:07,551
principle they they adhere and one of 
those principles is to reduce the 

1123
01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:10,920
destructive power of the patriarchy.
It's like,

1124
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:13,890
okay,
there is some destructive patriarchy for

1125
01:06:13,891 --> 01:06:15,780
you radio silence.
It's like,

1126
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:18,600
hmm,
now what am I supposed to do about that?

1127
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:21,270
Am I supposed to question your adherence
to those principles?

1128
01:06:21,271 --> 01:06:23,630
Which is exactly what should be done.
So I think it's a.

1129
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:24,570
it's,
it's a,

1130
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,570
it's a criticism of performative 
contradiction.

1131
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:30,660
You say you're for this,
but when it comes to act it out,

1132
01:06:30,661 --> 01:06:34,380
you don't selectively in this situation,
so if there's something wrong,

1133
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:38,040
there's something about your game that 
you're not being straight about.

1134
01:06:38,310 --> 01:06:41,160
That's the criticism and maybe there's 
rejoinders to that,

1135
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:43,800
you know?
Well,

1136
01:06:43,801 --> 01:06:44,490
okay,
okay,

1137
01:06:44,491 --> 01:06:46,410
well responsibility.
Well,

1138
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:47,970
you know,
then you'd have to look at,

1139
01:06:47,971 --> 01:06:49,040
at,
at different levels of,

1140
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:51,540
of analysis with regards to 
interactions.

1141
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:56,870
You definitely have a responsibility to 
your partner and your children.

1142
01:06:58,020 --> 01:07:03,020
Okay?
So your responsibility to your children 

1143
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:03,020
as far as I'm concerned,
is don't.

1144
01:07:03,330 --> 01:07:04,500
It's twofold.
One,

1145
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:09,530
don't let your children do anything that
makes you dislike them and there's a 

1146
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:10,560
corollary to that,
which is don't be an idiot.

1147
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:16,040
You know?
So that's partly why you need a partner 

1148
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:18,021
because your partner has to tell you 
when your demands on your children are 

1149
01:07:18,021 --> 01:07:20,330
excessive because you're kind of,
you know,

1150
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:22,380
you're not 100 percent oriented 
properly,

1151
01:07:22,650 --> 01:07:27,650
but still you're their target adult.
And so it's up to you to help them 

1152
01:07:28,410 --> 01:07:31,710
choose a path that makes you want them 
to be around.

1153
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:37,400
Right?
And that that's your critical 

1154
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,441
responsibility and hopefully your enough
of an an analog of the broader community

1155
01:07:41,010 --> 01:07:43,200
so that if they can figure out how to 
get along with you,

1156
01:07:43,201 --> 01:07:48,201
it radically increases the probability 
that they'll be able to get along with 

1157
01:07:48,201 --> 01:07:48,201
everyone.
So for example,

1158
01:07:48,201 --> 01:07:51,570
if you're playing with your children two
years old,

1159
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:53,970
you,
you help them,

1160
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,670
you encourage them to play in a manner 
that's fun.

1161
01:07:57,300 --> 01:08:00,600
And if you get that down,
then you know when you introduce them to

1162
01:08:00,601 --> 01:08:05,601
another child,
don't know how to play in a manner 

1163
01:08:05,601 --> 01:08:06,330
that's fun and so great.
You've solved the problem.

1164
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:11,570
The problem is to get your child to 
enter into the collaborative social 

1165
01:08:11,570 --> 01:08:11,570
world.
And so yes,

1166
01:08:11,570 --> 01:08:13,110
you have a primary responsibility for 
that.

1167
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:18,530
And then with regards to your,
here's something to think about with 

1168
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:22,931
regards to roles.
So my wife and I have had this 

1169
01:08:22,931 --> 01:08:22,931
discussion many times,
one of the discussions as well,

1170
01:08:22,931 --> 01:08:25,010
how are we to treat each other in 
public?

1171
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,290
And it isn't.
Her name is Tammy.

1172
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:31,070
The discussion isn't how should Jordan 
treat Tammy in public?

1173
01:08:31,071 --> 01:08:33,830
Or how should tammy treat Jordan?
That's not the discussion.

1174
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:37,460
This isn't personal.
It's how should a wife treat her husband

1175
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,000
and how should a husband treat his wife?
It's impersonal and it's partly you 

1176
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,010
don't put your partner down in public.
Why?

1177
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:51,240
Well,
it's not because you're hurting that 

1178
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:51,240
persons feelings.
That's not why.

1179
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:54,820
It's that you're denigrating the 
relationship that you are in 

1180
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:54,820
voluntarily.
You know,

1181
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:56,720
some of the most painful days I've ever 
spent.

1182
01:08:56,721 --> 01:09:00,830
One in particular I spent with a group 
of men who had been in therapy for their

1183
01:09:00,831 --> 01:09:03,890
marriage and who bloody well needed it.
I can tell you that.

1184
01:09:04,370 --> 01:09:07,640
And they spent their whole day 
complaining about their wives.

1185
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:09,860
Like it just made me sweat the whole 
day.

1186
01:09:09,861 --> 01:09:11,930
I thought,
I can't believe I'm here with you guys.

1187
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:14,020
I can't tell you.
Why was it,

1188
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:19,230
you know,
it was just happenstance more than 

1189
01:09:19,230 --> 01:09:19,230
anything.
And I thought,

1190
01:09:19,230 --> 01:09:19,700
how can you be so damn dump?
It's like,

1191
01:09:19,701 --> 01:09:24,701
it's certainly possible that you 
marriage barbara married barbarian 

1192
01:09:24,701 --> 01:09:28,421
witches fine,
but you don't have your so lacking in 

1193
01:09:28,421 --> 01:09:30,380
sense that you would discuss that in 
public.

1194
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:34,790
Not noticing that you pick them.
So basically all you're doing is holding

1195
01:09:34,791 --> 01:09:37,520
up a sign and waving it constantly.
That says,

1196
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:39,380
I'm an idiot,
I'm an idiot.

1197
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:42,080
Right,
and so well,

1198
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:44,510
Dr.
Responsibility,

1199
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:50,440
you have a responsibility to those whom 
you love and are obligated to,

1200
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:57,670
to ensure that they manifest themselves 
in a manner that's most beneficial to 

1201
01:09:57,670 --> 01:10:01,430
them over the long run.
Now you have the same responsibility,

1202
01:10:01,431 --> 01:10:04,430
I would say to yourself,
but you'll have blind spots.

1203
01:10:04,431 --> 01:10:07,880
Other people have to help you with that,
but so the rule is you know,

1204
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:13,030
you don't let your,
don't you help your wife figure out how 

1205
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:16,871
not to make a fool of herself in public 
and she extends to you the same courtesy

1206
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:21,170
and it's partly maintenance of the 
sacred nature of the relationship.

1207
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:24,650
It has nothing to do with you or her.
Precisely.

1208
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:27,470
It's broader and wider than that.
Okay,

1209
01:10:27,471 --> 01:10:29,540
so then that's two levels of 
responsibility.

1210
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:31,370
Child,
partner,

1211
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:36,520
next level of responsibility.
You're asked at your workplace to go 

1212
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:41,210
uncaught to undergo unconscious bias 
retraining new say yes.

1213
01:10:41,240 --> 01:10:42,020
It's like,
okay,

1214
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:44,570
you've just admitted that you're a 
bigot,

1215
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:46,850
right?
Because you're acting it out.

1216
01:10:46,851 --> 01:10:51,851
It's like I'm a racist bigot.
Obviously I need to be retrained and so 

1217
01:10:51,851 --> 01:10:51,851
you might say,
well,

1218
01:10:51,851 --> 01:10:53,360
I'm not going to make a fuss about it.
Right?

1219
01:10:53,361 --> 01:10:56,900
Or I've been told to do it.
Or maybe you agree with it fine,

1220
01:10:57,260 --> 01:10:58,790
and if that,
if you agree with it,

1221
01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:01,100
no problem,
you can make a case for it.

1222
01:11:01,101 --> 01:11:04,220
I think it's a week and appalling case 
personally,

1223
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:06,680
but you can make a case for it.
You could say,

1224
01:11:06,681 --> 01:11:07,120
well,
you know,

1225
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:12,130
I am interested in my,
my biases and how to rectify them and 

1226
01:11:12,130 --> 01:11:12,260
like,
fair enough,

1227
01:11:12,261 --> 01:11:13,530
you know,
people are biased,

1228
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:18,570
but if you object to it and you don't 
say anything,

1229
01:11:19,290 --> 01:11:24,290
then you're complicit and then it's on 
you and you know like a causes B and C 

1230
01:11:27,331 --> 01:11:29,670
and b causes c and d and so forth.

1231
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:34,700
The thing tends does noise,
but it has this tendency to expand and 

1232
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:38,331
you'll come home angry and upset and 
you'll go to the training program and 

1233
01:11:38,331 --> 01:11:42,171
you'll think this is ridiculous because 
that is what you'll think in all 

1234
01:11:42,171 --> 01:11:43,380
likelihood and you won't say anything 
but it eats at you.

1235
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:46,680
Well,
you've abrogated your responsibility.

1236
01:11:47,130 --> 01:11:48,690
And so,
and then you might say,

1237
01:11:48,691 --> 01:11:49,600
well,
so then,

1238
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:51,810
then that's how the community becomes 
corrupt.

1239
01:11:51,811 --> 01:11:53,610
That's how the community starts to be 
corrupt,

1240
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:58,910
is that people turn a blind eye to 
emergent pathology when they know it's 

1241
01:11:58,910 --> 01:12:03,501
pathological.
That's exactly what the Egyptian story 

1242
01:12:03,501 --> 01:12:03,501
says.
Oh,

1243
01:12:03,501 --> 01:12:07,011
cyrus is overcome by Seth because he's 
willfully blind,

1244
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:11,700
willfully blind,
which means he knows,

1245
01:12:12,330 --> 01:12:17,330
but refuses to.
He knows quote his Predator detection 

1246
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:20,700
systems have gone off monster while then
you're supposed to look okay,

1247
01:12:20,701 --> 01:12:22,620
exactly.
What sort of monster is this?

1248
01:12:22,621 --> 01:12:23,520
Well,
it doesn't have wings.

1249
01:12:23,521 --> 01:12:24,810
It doesn't have a tail.
You know,

1250
01:12:24,990 --> 01:12:29,990
you cut it down into the.
You cut it from the monster that it 

1251
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:32,280
could be into the monster that it is.
That's the first step.

1252
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:37,550
And then you take the appropriate steps 
and then you also noticed the other 

1253
01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:38,400
monsters.
Because here's something to think about.

1254
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:43,080
You're going to pay a price for speaking
up,

1255
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:45,720
but you're gonna pay a price for not 
speaking up.

1256
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:50,100
So it's like monsters on the right 
monsters on the left.

1257
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:55,110
Pick the ones you want to battle with.
If you decide not to make your stand,

1258
01:12:55,950 --> 01:12:59,640
you weaken yourself.
If you do it 100 times,

1259
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:02,160
then even if the monster was only this 
big,

1260
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:04,470
now you're this big,
it's going to eat you.

1261
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,600
You know when it was this big,
you probably could have kicked it across

1262
01:13:06,601 --> 01:13:08,220
the room.
It's too late for that.

1263
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:12,570
You have capitulated and capitulated and
so what you've done.

1264
01:13:12,910 --> 01:13:15,690
This is a way to think about it from a 
union perspective.

1265
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:18,660
This is what young was trying to get at 
when he was talking about elk alchemy.

1266
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:24,290
It's like the thing that pops up to 
object to you is this incredibly complex

1267
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:29,700
entity.
It's,

1268
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:32,310
it's the entire world encapsulated in 
the event.

1269
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,330
If you interact with it,
you unpack it.

1270
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:41,640
You differentiate your sense of the 
world and you and you gather new skills.

1271
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:46,850
So for example,
let's say there's something going on at 

1272
01:13:46,850 --> 01:13:49,911
your workplace and that you need to 
object to it because it's driving you 

1273
01:13:49,911 --> 01:13:52,851
crazy and you talk it over with your 
wife so that you've got your head 

1274
01:13:52,851 --> 01:13:52,851
screwed on straight and say,
well,

1275
01:13:52,851 --> 01:13:56,591
I've got to say something.
And you go there and you say something 

1276
01:13:56,591 --> 01:13:56,730
and you're stumbling and awkward and all
of that.

1277
01:13:56,731 --> 01:14:00,060
But,
but you watch the response and maybe you

1278
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:01,620
get what you're aiming at.
Maybe you don't,

1279
01:14:01,621 --> 01:14:03,240
but you've learned a bunch.
You've learned.

1280
01:14:03,241 --> 01:14:08,241
While I'm not as coherent as I could be,
I'm not as good at putting my arguments 

1281
01:14:08,241 --> 01:14:08,241
together.
My boss is more of a son of a bitch that

1282
01:14:08,241 --> 01:14:09,030
I,
that he thought he was.

1283
01:14:09,031 --> 01:14:10,740
This is a worst problem that I knew 
about.

1284
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:13,360
It's like differentiated,
differentiated.

1285
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:18,150
So now the landscape is higher 
resolution and so were you well,

1286
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,990
so good.
So maybe you're a little bit next,

1287
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:22,300
better prepared the next time you have 
to do that.

1288
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:27,720
And so the issue here to some degree is 
don't lose an opportunity to grapple 

1289
01:14:29,501 --> 01:14:34,501
with something that objects to you,
especially when the object objection is 

1290
01:14:34,501 --> 01:14:37,120
rather small because that's something 
you can say,

1291
01:14:37,121 --> 01:14:39,650
well I can put up with it.
It's like fair enough.

1292
01:14:39,651 --> 01:14:41,760
Like you don't want to make everything 
into a war.

1293
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:46,830
I usually use your rule of three.
If we're interacting and you do 

1294
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:47,800
something that I find disruptive,
I'll note it.

1295
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:51,970
It's like potential dragon.
Go on and I'll leave it be.

1296
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:53,890
And then if you do it again,
I think,

1297
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:58,480
oh yeah,
that probably wasn't merely situation,

1298
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:01,090
but I'll leave it be because that's 
still not enough evidence.

1299
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:04,000
But if you do it a third time,
then I'll say,

1300
01:15:04,030 --> 01:15:06,070
hey,
I just noticed this and you'll say,

1301
01:15:06,071 --> 01:15:07,090
no,
that didn't happen.

1302
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:08,440
And I'll say,
yeah,

1303
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:13,600
no one really did it happen,
but it happened here and it happened 

1304
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,531
here and I'm not making this up.
So there's something going on here like 

1305
01:15:16,531 --> 01:15:17,740
I'm not ignoring it and we can get to 
the bottom of it.

1306
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:22,920
And then they'll come up with a bunch of
objections about why that isn't 

1307
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:22,920
necessary.
And you push those aside.

1308
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:25,960
Now come up with a few more objections 
and then push those aside.

1309
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,930
And then usually they'll get mad or 
burst into tears.

1310
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:32,920
And if you push that aside,
then you get to have a conversation,

1311
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,890
right?
And then you can solve the problem.

1312
01:15:35,891 --> 01:15:36,700
But man,
it's,

1313
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:40,180
you got to be a monster because first of
all,

1314
01:15:40,181 --> 01:15:44,080
you need six arguments about why their 
objections aren't gonna stop you.

1315
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:47,680
And then you have to not be intimidated 
by the anger.

1316
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:52,890
And you have to not be swamped by 
compassion about the tiers and then you 

1317
01:15:54,101 --> 01:15:56,890
can have a conversation and people don't
do that.

1318
01:15:57,100 --> 01:16:00,580
They won't do that.
And so they don't solve the problems.

1319
01:16:00,581 --> 01:16:02,980
And so then the problem's accrue,
right?

1320
01:16:02,981 --> 01:16:05,260
And if they accrue over 15 years of a 
relationship,

1321
01:16:05,261 --> 01:16:07,450
they end up,
then they end up fat,

1322
01:16:07,570 --> 01:16:09,010
ugly,
end in divorce court.

1323
01:16:10,150 --> 01:16:10,900
So,
and that's,

1324
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:11,860
you know,
that's not a,

1325
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:17,460
that's not a great outcome.
It's a divorce court and cancer are 

1326
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:20,830
similar in their,
in their seriousness,

1327
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:21,680
not always,
but,

1328
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:27,090
but sufficiently often.
So when that error emerges,

1329
01:16:27,091 --> 01:16:29,290
it's a,
it's a glimmering.

1330
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,670
Now,
you know,

1331
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:34,240
we talked a lot about the hierarchical 
structure of goals,

1332
01:16:34,241 --> 01:16:36,710
you know,
and so here's,

1333
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:39,520
here's something that,
here's something to think about.

1334
01:16:39,521 --> 01:16:44,521
So the thing that analysis itself is 
error has a twofold nature.

1335
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:48,220
That's because it's chaos in order at 
the same time,

1336
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,520
or it's because it's all the archetypal 
structures at the same time,

1337
01:16:51,521 --> 01:16:54,130
it's the dragon of chaos.
It's the great mother,

1338
01:16:54,131 --> 01:16:55,780
positive or negative.
It's the great father,

1339
01:16:55,810 --> 01:16:59,500
positive and negative.
It's the individual hero and adversary.

1340
01:16:59,830 --> 01:17:02,440
All of that manifests itself in the 
moment of error,

1341
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:04,330
right?
The architects come forward.

1342
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:06,610
Did you make an error because you're a 
bad person.

1343
01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:09,320
Could be now.
So,

1344
01:17:09,410 --> 01:17:11,750
so one of the things to think about with
regards to that is,

1345
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:13,850
you know,
in the Mesopotamian creation story,

1346
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:15,220
when,
uh,

1347
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:17,960
when,
when time comes flooding back,

1348
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:19,430
it's so interesting that story.

1349
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:25,330
Think about what she does.
So she's the archetype of error.

1350
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:27,080
Let's say the error that can take you 
out,

1351
01:17:27,090 --> 01:17:30,200
they can dissolve you in salt water 
tears.

1352
01:17:32,330 --> 01:17:33,740
Well,
she's irritated because apps,

1353
01:17:33,741 --> 01:17:36,320
it was destroyed.
So the structure is gone.

1354
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:38,650
Carelessness is destroyed.
The structure up comes,

1355
01:17:38,651 --> 01:17:40,280
tie or not.
She's not happy.

1356
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:45,880
What does she do?
She prepares a phalanx of monstrous 

1357
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:46,400
monsters.
It's exactly what the story says.

1358
01:17:46,401 --> 01:17:51,401
She produces a whole horde of monsters 
to come at you and she puts king you at 

1359
01:17:52,401 --> 01:17:57,401
their head.
And Kenya was the king of the monsters 

1360
01:17:57,401 --> 01:17:58,940
and later,
so he's the ultimate bad guy.

1361
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,950
He's Satan,
for all intents and purposes,

1362
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:06,010
in the midst of Damien version,
it's out of him that makes human beings.

1363
01:18:06,201 --> 01:18:08,510
It's out of his blood.
But mark makes human beings.

1364
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,610
That's a critical issue,
man.

1365
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:15,850
The Mesopotamian said,
imagine the worst monster you can 

1366
01:18:15,850 --> 01:18:17,690
possibly imagine the king of all the 
monsters.

1367
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:22,130
That's the blood of human beings.
Wow.

1368
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:24,080
So what.
What does that mean?

1369
01:18:25,010 --> 01:18:26,810
Well,
it means that one of the terrible things

1370
01:18:26,811 --> 01:18:31,811
that lurks,
let's say that you've been in the 

1371
01:18:31,811 --> 01:18:35,030
longterm relationship and it collapses.
Let's say you were,

1372
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:37,700
you know,
he had a tendency towards alcoholism.

1373
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:40,760
You weren't so great with regards to 
your drug use.

1374
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:46,630
You don't have that conscientious and 
you had like four or five kinda low ran 

1375
01:18:46,630 --> 01:18:51,390
to affairs and you know it.
Your marriage collapses bank.

1376
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:55,130
Well,
who do you first meet when you fall into

1377
01:18:55,131 --> 01:19:00,131
chaos?
You meet King of the monsters and he's 

1378
01:19:00,131 --> 01:19:01,340
you like,
why did my marriage fall apart?

1379
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:02,870
What did I do wrong?
Bang,

1380
01:19:02,871 --> 01:19:03,380
Bang,
Bang,

1381
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:03,920
Bang,
Bang.

1382
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:06,080
I did all these things wrong.
Why?

1383
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:09,380
Because of that thing and habits me.
What is it?

1384
01:19:09,770 --> 01:19:11,450
Well,
that's the most horrifying question,

1385
01:19:11,650 --> 01:19:13,100
right?
Well that's why.

1386
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,130
So down there in the architectural 
space,

1387
01:19:16,190 --> 01:19:19,610
all these things lurk the heroin,
the adversary,

1388
01:19:20,110 --> 01:19:22,220
but you've just met the adversary,
right?

1389
01:19:22,580 --> 01:19:23,660
Well,
maybe you were tyrant.

1390
01:19:24,530 --> 01:19:27,650
That's certainly possible.
Maybe everything around you was chaotic,

1391
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:30,140
so what do you encounter when things 
fall apart?

1392
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:33,770
Even counter the adversary you 
encountered the tyrant,

1393
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:38,890
you encounter the catastrophe of nature 
and you encountered the dragon of the 

1394
01:19:38,890 --> 01:19:42,170
chaos and they're all intermingled.
You have to sort that out.

1395
01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:44,420
That's what happens to Ellis.
When she goes down the rabbit hole,

1396
01:19:44,660 --> 01:19:49,660
she meets the Red Queen.
The Red Queen is always running around,

1397
01:19:50,570 --> 01:19:52,160
off with their heads off with their 
heads,

1398
01:19:52,161 --> 01:19:53,900
and she says,
in my kingdom,

1399
01:19:53,910 --> 01:19:58,070
you have to run as fast as you can just 
to stay in the same place right down the

1400
01:19:58,071 --> 01:20:01,280
rabbit hole you meet the archetypes.
And so,

1401
01:20:02,990 --> 01:20:04,610
okay,
so back to responsibility.

1402
01:20:04,670 --> 01:20:05,510
Well,
one of the things,

1403
01:20:05,511 --> 01:20:07,060
soldier and incent detailed,
you know,

1404
01:20:07,070 --> 01:20:07,500
he said,
well,

1405
01:20:07,501 --> 01:20:09,900
how does society go?
Corrupt said it's easy.

1406
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:15,540
One little sin at a time.
You go to work,

1407
01:20:15,541 --> 01:20:18,030
someone's Lording it over you.
You know that they're tyrannical.

1408
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,580
You don't have the wherewithal to stand 
up.

1409
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:21,810
It's like,
okay,

1410
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:23,520
you're a slave.

1411
01:20:26,020 --> 01:20:28,660
And so if you continue to agree to be a 
slave,

1412
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:32,710
you will continue to generate tyrants.
Right?

1413
01:20:32,711 --> 01:20:34,720
And the only thing that can stop you 
from doing that,

1414
01:20:34,721 --> 01:20:37,090
I think is the right kind of terror.
It's like,

1415
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:41,360
be careful what you give up because now 
it's this logo.

1416
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:41,710
So.
Okay,

1417
01:20:41,711 --> 01:20:42,250
so,
so.

1418
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:43,910
All right,
so that's this logo.

1419
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:46,990
The logo is the thing that enables you 
to mediate between eight,

1420
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:49,900
between order and chaos.
And maybe you have to have some faith in

1421
01:20:49,901 --> 01:20:50,860
that.
It's like,

1422
01:20:50,861 --> 01:20:55,861
well,
what should you do with someone who's 

1423
01:20:55,861 --> 01:20:55,861
harassing you?
Well,

1424
01:20:55,861 --> 01:20:55,861
you should fight back.
Okay,

1425
01:20:55,861 --> 01:21:00,631
what does that.
What's the most effective way to fight 

1426
01:21:00,631 --> 01:21:00,631
back?
Well,

1427
01:21:00,631 --> 01:21:03,040
sometimes it's physical,
but that's not necessarily for the best.

1428
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:07,210
Maybe it's through articulation.
Maybe it's through analysis,

1429
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:08,740
right?
You want to be sharp,

1430
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:10,810
you wouldn't be able to decompose a 
problem.

1431
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:16,020
You want to be able to formulate an 
argument and a counter response and 

1432
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:16,990
maybe you want to be so good at that,
that people don't mess with you to begin

1433
01:21:16,991 --> 01:21:17,230
with.

1434
01:21:17,850 --> 01:21:22,850
And then you're a perfectly articulate 
counter monster and you never have to 

1435
01:21:22,850 --> 01:21:24,090
take your sword out.
That's,

1436
01:21:24,330 --> 01:21:29,080
that's the place that you want to be.
It's like people should know after three

1437
01:21:29,081 --> 01:21:34,081
seconds of interacting with you that 
harassing you will be a seriously bad 

1438
01:21:34,081 --> 01:21:36,640
idea and then you'll have a perfectly 
fine time with them,

1439
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:42,900
so and that's part of you know,
so there's some utility in meeting the 

1440
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:43,690
devil in underworld,
right?

1441
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:47,710
Because maybe he's got something to 
teach you that's certainly possible that

1442
01:21:47,711 --> 01:21:51,910
and one of the things that you can be 
taught is that your normative morality,

1443
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:56,940
which is basically your harmlessness and
your naivety masquerading as virtue is 

1444
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:01,150
completely insufficient to protect you 
in the world,

1445
01:22:01,151 --> 01:22:03,340
especially against the sorts of things 
that you're talking about,

1446
01:22:03,341 --> 01:22:08,020
which are tyrant tyranny.
Tyrants will push until you push back.

1447
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:11,620
It's in their nature.
They don't have internal controls,

1448
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:15,010
so they just push and push and push and 
push and push and push.

1449
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:17,860
Even kids do that,
like little kids do that all the time.

1450
01:22:17,861 --> 01:22:20,140
They'll just push you until they hit a 
wall.

1451
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:25,260
They're actually quite happy when they 
hit a wall because the last thing a 

1452
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:27,400
child wants is a universe without walls.
It terrifies them,

1453
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:29,410
right?
They want to see while I'm in a swimming

1454
01:22:29,411 --> 01:22:31,120
pool,
there's an edge.

1455
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:32,330
They don't want to see,
oh,

1456
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:34,090
oh,
this isn't as important.

1457
01:22:34,330 --> 01:22:36,580
This is an ocean.
I'm in the middle of an ocean.

1458
01:22:36,670 --> 01:22:39,660
I'm going to drown.
That's a terrible thing for children.

1459
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:44,680
That's why they need discipline and 
structure because it's consistency and 

1460
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:49,231
predictability and routine and all the 
things that are extraordinarily helpful 

1461
01:22:49,231 --> 01:22:50,230
to them.
Okay,

1462
01:22:50,231 --> 01:22:55,231
so now think about that hierarchy that 
we talked about so you're not in a 

1463
01:22:56,101 --> 01:22:58,510
story.
You're in nested stories,

1464
01:22:58,630 --> 01:23:01,150
and the nest is stories ground 
themselves,

1465
01:23:01,151 --> 01:23:04,930
inaction in actual embodied action.
So if you're going to sit,

1466
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:10,140
if you're going to be a good a partner,
maybe you help prepare the meals and to 

1467
01:23:11,861 --> 01:23:16,861
help prepare the meals means you pick up
a plate with your hand and you move it 

1468
01:23:16,861 --> 01:23:18,190
physically through space and you put it 
on the table.

1469
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:20,050
That's where it stops being an 
abstraction.

1470
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:24,400
So at the bottom of an ethical hierarchy
of value,

1471
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:29,380
our actions,
not things that's the scientific world,

1472
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:35,130
but actions and then you can label the 
actions with abstractions as you move up

1473
01:23:37,301 --> 01:23:42,301
the hierarchy.
So you're good at setting the table so 

1474
01:23:42,301 --> 01:23:45,210
that means you're good at making dinner,
so that means that you've got one 

1475
01:23:45,210 --> 01:23:47,941
element of good being a good partner in 
place and being a good partner is one 

1476
01:23:47,941 --> 01:23:51,811
element of being a good person and so 
you you're not so good at setting the 

1477
01:23:51,811 --> 01:23:53,260
table and you say,
well I'm not a good person.

1478
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:54,550
It's like,
well no,

1479
01:23:54,610 --> 01:23:59,610
you should go down to the higher 
resolution levels of the hierarchy and 

1480
01:23:59,610 --> 01:24:00,430
start there and that's what you do when 
you're arguing with people.

1481
01:24:00,610 --> 01:24:05,610
But there's another thing that's really 
useful about conceptualizing the 

1482
01:24:05,610 --> 01:24:07,900
hierarchy in this manner.
So don't miss it.

1483
01:24:08,680 --> 01:24:11,980
So I think what we'll do is we'll stop 
now for 10 minutes and I'll,

1484
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:17,040
because I want to bring up this diagram 
because what I want to do next is it's a

1485
01:24:17,110 --> 01:24:22,110
bleak story at the moment because the 
story is something like you're going to 

1486
01:24:22,110 --> 01:24:26,401
lay out over simplifications in the 
world and they're going to be prone to 

1487
01:24:26,401 --> 01:24:29,041
catastrophic error and then you have to 
encounter what's terrifying in order to 

1488
01:24:29,041 --> 01:24:32,881
progress.
And so what that means is that 

1489
01:24:32,881 --> 01:24:32,881
progression is always dependent on 
terror.

1490
01:24:32,881 --> 01:24:37,230
Something like that and there's some 
truth in that and that's why people 

1491
01:24:37,230 --> 01:24:40,351
don't progress,
but it's not a sufficient truth and I 

1492
01:24:40,351 --> 01:24:43,261
want to unpack that when we come back.
So let's come back in 10 minutes and 

1493
01:24:43,261 --> 01:24:43,480
then I'll,
I can unpack that.

1494
01:24:45,110 --> 01:24:48,260
There's this parable in the new 
testament that just came to mind.

1495
01:24:48,630 --> 01:24:53,630
Um,
I'm going to mangle it a bit because 

1496
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:53,630
it's not one that I have well memorized,
but,

1497
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,840
and I'm probably going to conflate two 
or three stories together,

1498
01:24:56,841 --> 01:24:58,370
but I think.
I think I've got it right.

1499
01:24:59,450 --> 01:25:04,450
Christ is walking down the road and 
someone picks them up and if the person 

1500
01:25:04,450 --> 01:25:09,281
is rich and wealthy and he has a talk,
they talk and the wealthy man basically 

1501
01:25:14,840 --> 01:25:17,510
tells him all the things that are wrong 
with his life.

1502
01:25:18,290 --> 01:25:21,410
And then he asks him what he should do 
about it.

1503
01:25:21,411 --> 01:25:26,411
And Chris says to him,
you have to give up everything you own 

1504
01:25:26,411 --> 01:25:30,851
and follow me.
And that's often be read as a criticism 

1505
01:25:30,851 --> 01:25:34,751
of wealth.
And that's actually not what the story 

1506
01:25:34,751 --> 01:25:34,751
means.
What the story means is this,

1507
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,340
this guy has a lot of wealth,
but he's still miserable.

1508
01:25:38,030 --> 01:25:42,770
And so that means that what he has is 
the obstacle to what he could be.

1509
01:25:42,830 --> 01:25:47,830
And so that's the message of the story 
is that if you're miserable with what 

1510
01:25:47,830 --> 01:25:48,350
you have,
then you have to let go of what you have

1511
01:25:48,351 --> 01:25:50,480
so that maybe you could have something 
else.

1512
01:25:50,990 --> 01:25:54,770
And so and then there's some commentary 
on that story.

1513
01:25:54,771 --> 01:25:57,680
I think other people are listening and 
they say,

1514
01:25:57,770 --> 01:26:00,830
well,
if that's the price to be paid,

1515
01:26:00,831 --> 01:26:05,831
then no one is ever to pay it.
And I think that's where the statement,

1516
01:26:06,021 --> 01:26:11,021
it is easier for a man to go through the
eye of a needle for a camel to go 

1517
01:26:11,021 --> 01:26:15,110
through an eye of the eye of a needle 
than for a rich man to enter paradise.

1518
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:18,170
I believe that's the derivation of that 
story.

1519
01:26:18,171 --> 01:26:23,171
And like I said,
that's been read as a critique of 

1520
01:26:23,171 --> 01:26:23,171
wealth,
but it isn't.

1521
01:26:23,171 --> 01:26:24,020
It's a critique of attachment.
Now,

1522
01:26:24,021 --> 01:26:25,490
you know,
in the Buddhist doctrine,

1523
01:26:27,770 --> 01:26:28,400
one of the

1524
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:33,480
impediments to enlightenment is 
attachment.

1525
01:26:33,930 --> 01:26:35,580
And people read that as saying,
well,

1526
01:26:35,581 --> 01:26:37,530
you shouldn't care for anything in the 
world.

1527
01:26:37,950 --> 01:26:42,950
And that's,
there's a nihilism that's associated 

1528
01:26:42,950 --> 01:26:44,250
with that.
There is a strong nihilistic tendency in

1529
01:26:44,251 --> 01:26:48,180
Buddhism that has to do with abandonment
of the world.

1530
01:26:48,181 --> 01:26:53,181
Do you see that in Christianity to some 
degree with people going off to lead 

1531
01:26:53,181 --> 01:26:53,210
ascetic lives in to,
you know,

1532
01:26:53,211 --> 01:26:58,211
it's.
It's part of multiple religious 

1533
01:26:58,211 --> 01:26:58,211
traditions.
That idea of asceticism and there's some

1534
01:26:58,211 --> 01:27:01,350
utility in it.
If it is your attachment say to material

1535
01:27:01,351 --> 01:27:06,351
things or status or whatever that's 
interfering with your psychological 

1536
01:27:06,351 --> 01:27:10,941
progression.
Now the idea is that you should let go 

1537
01:27:10,941 --> 01:27:13,551
of whatever it is that's interfering 
with your psychological progression 

1538
01:27:13,551 --> 01:27:16,911
because no matter how valuable what it 
is that's interfering is it's not as 

1539
01:27:17,101 --> 01:27:18,630
valuable as what you're giving up.

1540
01:27:20,660 --> 01:27:21,920
Okay.
However,

1541
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:25,100
that criticism still stands and the 
criticism was,

1542
01:27:25,101 --> 01:27:27,590
well,
if the task is that difficult,

1543
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:32,920
then no one's going to do it,
and so in in the brothers Karamazov,

1544
01:27:34,220 --> 01:27:39,220
there's a famous story called the grand 
inquisitor and it's a story told by Ivan

1545
01:27:44,030 --> 01:27:49,030
Karamozov to his brother Leo,
and Ivan is a very high status,

1546
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:53,150
intelligent,
attractive,

1547
01:27:53,690 --> 01:27:58,690
tough minded soldier and Lee.
Osha is his younger brother and he's 

1548
01:27:59,901 --> 01:28:04,901
kind of softer and less rational,
a more spiritual,

1549
01:28:05,870 --> 01:28:10,870
and also training to be a novitiate at 
the local monastery and Ivan likes to 

1550
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:15,530
tear strips off it because he's a cynic 
and an atheist,

1551
01:28:15,531 --> 01:28:19,250
and and,
and in Dostoyevsky's normal,

1552
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:23,360
brilliant manner.
He makes Ivan and incredibly powerful,

1553
01:28:23,630 --> 01:28:28,400
articulate and admirable character.
So when Dostoevsky wants to take someone

1554
01:28:28,401 --> 01:28:33,401
on and his literary investigations,
he doesn't take his enemy and turned 

1555
01:28:33,401 --> 01:28:34,790
them into some sort of weak puppet.

1556
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:39,940
He takes his enemy and turns them into 
the strongest possible enemy he can 

1557
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:43,190
imagine.
And then goes to battle against that.

1558
01:28:43,191 --> 01:28:46,220
It's a hallmark of great literature.
It's what distinguishes dusty ask,

1559
01:28:46,221 --> 01:28:47,600
for example,
from Ayn rand,

1560
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:50,450
because what Ayn rand does is she takes 
her.

1561
01:28:50,570 --> 01:28:53,810
She's a darling of the,
I would say libertarian slash,

1562
01:28:53,811 --> 01:28:58,811
right?
She takes her enemies and they're all 

1563
01:28:58,811 --> 01:28:58,811
the same.
First of all,

1564
01:28:58,811 --> 01:29:03,281
every single one of her negative 
characters is exactly the same as every 

1565
01:29:03,281 --> 01:29:03,480
other one,
and they're all bad.

1566
01:29:03,610 --> 01:29:04,210
You know,
there's,

1567
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:06,630
there's no redeeming qualities 
whatsoever in them.

1568
01:29:06,870 --> 01:29:08,340
And they also,
I would say,

1569
01:29:08,430 --> 01:29:11,250
make their weak characters who make weak
arguments.

1570
01:29:11,251 --> 01:29:16,251
That's not the way to progress.
The way to progress is to take your 

1571
01:29:16,251 --> 01:29:19,581
enemy seriously and to even inflate them
into something beyond their capacity to 

1572
01:29:19,621 --> 01:29:23,910
inflate themselves and then see if you 
can hammer out a solution to the genuine

1573
01:29:23,911 --> 01:29:26,320
problem that's being posed anyways.

1574
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:29,160
So dusty,
he does that brilliantly always.

1575
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:31,890
And that's what makes him so absolutely 
remarkable.

1576
01:29:32,940 --> 01:29:35,400
But anyways,
I even tell Lee Osha this story,

1577
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:38,190
he calls it the grand inquisitor and in 
the story,

1578
01:29:38,430 --> 01:29:42,480
Christ comes back to Earth in the 
Spanish inquisition and he's,

1579
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:47,660
he's out by a fountain and people sort 
of notice him and he starts performing 

1580
01:29:47,660 --> 01:29:50,100
miracles in a big crowd,
gathers around and it's like happy days,

1581
01:29:50,101 --> 01:29:51,000
you know.
Um,

1582
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:56,540
but then the inquisitor's shows up this 
old harsh tyrannical guy and he has his 

1583
01:29:57,361 --> 01:29:59,760
guards arrested and throwing them in 
prison.

1584
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:05,750
And so now Christ is in prison.
And the inquisitive it comes down and 

1585
01:30:06,661 --> 01:30:08,280
says to him,
well,

1586
01:30:08,281 --> 01:30:10,440
you're probably wondering why we throw 
you in prison.

1587
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:15,500
You know,
especially given that we're the members 

1588
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:15,500
of the,
you know,

1589
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:17,020
where the representatives of the church 
that you hypothetically founded and,

1590
01:30:17,350 --> 01:30:21,270
and Christ remained silent through this 
entire episode.

1591
01:30:21,810 --> 01:30:25,080
And uh,
the inquisitor basically says,

1592
01:30:25,081 --> 01:30:25,710
look,
you know,

1593
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:28,100
you laid down this ethic.
That's,

1594
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:31,570
it's wonderful,
but it's superhuman.

1595
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:34,410
No one can do it.
It's asking way too much.

1596
01:30:34,890 --> 01:30:37,290
And so you're,
you put the burden you put on people was

1597
01:30:37,291 --> 01:30:42,291
just far too great.
And so what we've done in the Catholic 

1598
01:30:42,291 --> 01:30:44,100
church in the centuries since the church
was founded is lightened the load.

1599
01:30:44,101 --> 01:30:44,690
We said,
well,

1600
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:46,080
we'd take ordinary people and say,
well,

1601
01:30:46,081 --> 01:30:51,081
there,
here's some things you can do to be a 

1602
01:30:51,081 --> 01:30:51,081
little bit better.
And you know,

1603
01:30:51,081 --> 01:30:51,930
we've instituted confession and 
repentance and all that.

1604
01:30:51,931 --> 01:30:56,340
We've kind of toned it down so that the 
average person has some hope of progress

1605
01:30:56,341 --> 01:30:59,700
and we're making headway.
And the last bloody thing we need around

1606
01:30:59,701 --> 01:31:02,430
here is you coming back and like 
screwing up all our,

1607
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:05,490
all our good efforts is.
It was nice to have you around once,

1608
01:31:05,491 --> 01:31:06,810
but once was plenty,
man,

1609
01:31:06,811 --> 01:31:08,010
we don't need you around anymore.

1610
01:31:08,460 --> 01:31:10,920
And so Christ listens to this,
doesn't say anything,

1611
01:31:10,921 --> 01:31:15,921
and then the inquisitor turns to leave 
and Christ grabs him and kisses him on 

1612
01:31:15,921 --> 01:31:19,680
the lips and the inquisitor turns white 
and then leaves.

1613
01:31:19,770 --> 01:31:24,770
And when he leaves the door,
he leaves the door open and that's the 

1614
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:25,350
end of the story.
And it's an amazing store.

1615
01:31:25,360 --> 01:31:28,950
It's an absolutely remarkable story in 
every possible way.

1616
01:31:28,951 --> 01:31:30,240
And,
and you know,

1617
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:35,280
dusty was objecting to some degree to 
the tyranny of the Catholic church,

1618
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:37,350
or even if the Christian church for that
matter.

1619
01:31:37,351 --> 01:31:42,351
But the thing that he did that was so 
damn brilliant is that he even made the 

1620
01:31:42,351 --> 01:31:45,210
inquisitor leave the door open now.
And as a balanced critique of 

1621
01:31:45,210 --> 01:31:46,980
Catholicism,
even during the inquisition,

1622
01:31:46,981 --> 01:31:51,150
it's so brilliant.
It's so emblematic of Dostoyevsky's take

1623
01:31:51,151 --> 01:31:56,151
on the world that he criticized the 
inquisitorial aspect of Christianity.

1624
01:31:56,611 --> 01:31:57,150
And it's,
of course,

1625
01:31:57,151 --> 01:31:59,530
it's the tyrannical aspect of any belief
system,

1626
01:31:59,770 --> 01:32:02,500
but noted that they bloody well left the
door open.

1627
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:04,240
Right?
So it's brilliant.

1628
01:32:04,330 --> 01:32:06,120
It's brilliant.
It's,

1629
01:32:06,470 --> 01:32:06,990
it's,
yeah,

1630
01:32:06,991 --> 01:32:07,930
it's,
it's remarkable.

1631
01:32:08,110 --> 01:32:13,110
So anyways,
the whole point that I'm making here is 

1632
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:15,751
that there are terrible impediments to 
enlightenment and the light,

1633
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:21,200
the impediments are the necessity of 
sacrifice and the necessity area of 

1634
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:23,320
necessity of the voluntary acceptance of
suffering.

1635
01:32:23,690 --> 01:32:24,910
I mean,
you see that in Buddhism,

1636
01:32:24,911 --> 01:32:26,650
you know,
because one of the canons of Buddha,

1637
01:32:26,710 --> 01:32:31,710
one of the fundamental principles of 
Buddhism is that life is suffering and 

1638
01:32:31,710 --> 01:32:34,480
that attachment makes it worse and well 
it isn't,

1639
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:39,750
it isn't precisely attachment.
It's an attachment to things such that 

1640
01:32:39,750 --> 01:32:43,000
you cannot release the things when it's 
time to let them go.

1641
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:45,250
Right?
So like you're a phoenix,

1642
01:32:45,730 --> 01:32:47,710
you're 100 years old,
your feathers,

1643
01:32:47,770 --> 01:32:49,180
they're not working anymore,
right?

1644
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:50,830
You're all wrinkly,
you're done.

1645
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:53,770
It's time to burst into flames and be 
reborn,

1646
01:32:53,771 --> 01:32:55,480
but you don't want to burn off your 
feathers.

1647
01:32:55,810 --> 01:33:00,810
You want to clean to them.
And that's not good because you have to 

1648
01:33:00,810 --> 01:33:01,810
be willing to undergo that 
transformation process.

1649
01:33:01,811 --> 01:33:03,870
And that involves like,
you know,

1650
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:08,910
if you,
if you take your self apart because 

1651
01:33:08,910 --> 01:33:09,700
you've made a mistake and you find out 
what it is about you,

1652
01:33:09,701 --> 01:33:14,701
that's not set up properly.
And that's why the mistake occurred and 

1653
01:33:14,701 --> 01:33:15,850
that's really going to happen.
For example,

1654
01:33:15,851 --> 01:33:17,560
when an intimate relationship breaks 
down,

1655
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:22,950
then you have to be in a position where 
you're willing to let the errors that 

1656
01:33:22,950 --> 01:33:24,550
are part of your character that define 
you,

1657
01:33:24,551 --> 01:33:29,551
right?
They might even be part of your 

1658
01:33:29,551 --> 01:33:30,901
identity.
You have to let you have to be willing 

1659
01:33:30,901 --> 01:33:33,091
to let them go.
You have to be willing to let them burn 

1660
01:33:33,091 --> 01:33:34,030
off and that's a hell of a thing to ask.
And so then the question might be,

1661
01:33:34,031 --> 01:33:39,031
well,
is there a less radical solution to the 

1662
01:33:39,031 --> 01:33:41,461
problem then then then crucifixion and 
resurrection or that the total emulation

1663
01:33:42,831 --> 01:33:45,700
and regeneration,
because that's the archetype will.

1664
01:33:46,450 --> 01:33:48,850
What's that?
That's the archetype will and point that

1665
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:52,360
if you want to put your self together,
you have to die and be reborn.

1666
01:33:52,390 --> 01:33:55,420
I mean that and that motif comes up all 
the time in,

1667
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:56,100
in,
in,

1668
01:33:56,260 --> 01:33:59,230
in popular popular stories and 
mythology.

1669
01:33:59,530 --> 01:34:01,690
And so they,
here's,

1670
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:06,750
here's how I think that problem can be 
resolved.

1671
01:34:07,630 --> 01:34:12,550
So let's go back to the UN story 
momentarily.

1672
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:18,240
So what happens?
And the Pinocchio Story to me is 

1673
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:18,850
analogous in its structure to the sermon
on the mountain.

1674
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:21,580
So I'm going to make a parallel between 
those two things.

1675
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:26,880
So basically what the sermon on the 
mount suggests is that you should 

1676
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:31,620
conceptualize the highest good that 
you're capable of conceptualizing and 

1677
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:34,120
orient yourself towards that and that 
having done that,

1678
01:34:34,121 --> 01:34:39,121
you should live in the moment.
So it's not like you should live in the 

1679
01:34:39,121 --> 01:34:41,110
moment.
It doesn't say that because that's often

1680
01:34:41,230 --> 01:34:42,570
Christ the Hippie,
you know,

1681
01:34:42,610 --> 01:34:47,610
so they,
the hippies who have adopted that or 

1682
01:34:47,610 --> 01:34:47,610
the,
that sort of,

1683
01:34:47,610 --> 01:34:49,240
that,
that element of Christianity say,

1684
01:34:49,241 --> 01:34:50,800
well you live for the moment,
you know,

1685
01:34:50,801 --> 01:34:51,430
and,
and,

1686
01:34:51,431 --> 01:34:54,040
and,
and in meditation and other practices,

1687
01:34:54,041 --> 01:34:56,710
some of the attempt is to get you to 
live in the moment,

1688
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:02,080
but you know,
just to tell people to live in the 

1689
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:02,080
moment,
it's like,

1690
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:02,080
what the hell kind of advice is that?

1691
01:35:02,270 --> 01:35:03,650
What about the future?
You know,

1692
01:35:03,651 --> 01:35:08,651
that it's not helpful advice.
Somebody comes to you and they're 

1693
01:35:08,651 --> 01:35:11,531
suffering dreadfully because their 
mother has Alzheimer's and they're 

1694
01:35:11,531 --> 01:35:11,531
unemployed.
Well,

1695
01:35:11,531 --> 01:35:12,060
live in the moment.
It's like,

1696
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:15,890
that's just not helpful.
It's because it's even worse than that.

1697
01:35:15,891 --> 01:35:17,120
It's judgmental.
You say,

1698
01:35:17,121 --> 01:35:22,121
well,
the only reason you're suffering is 

1699
01:35:22,121 --> 01:35:22,121
because you haven't oriented yourself.
Property live in the moment.

1700
01:35:22,121 --> 01:35:22,400
It's like,
no,

1701
01:35:22,401 --> 01:35:25,820
you're suffering because your mother has
Alzheimer's and you don't have a job,

1702
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,460
so like it's not because you aren't 
living in the moment,

1703
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:32,690
so living in the moment isn't the right 
answer.

1704
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:37,640
The right answer is something more like 
Orient Yourself towards the highest good

1705
01:35:37,641 --> 01:35:40,370
that you can imagine and then act in the
moment.

1706
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:43,400
That's a whole different story.
Now that's what happens in the Pinocchio

1707
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:48,400
Story.
Basically what happens is that Japan 

1708
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:51,180
sees the star that cutting in the 
distance and he orients himself towards 

1709
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:55,721
the highest good he can imagine.
He wants to take this creation of his 

1710
01:35:55,721 --> 01:35:59,340
and so this is manifesting itself 
conceptually at multiple levels 

1711
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:03,971
simultaneously because there's a.
there's a story about the destiny of 

1712
01:36:03,971 --> 01:36:05,900
humanity in relationship to God nested 
in the story.

1713
01:36:05,901 --> 01:36:10,550
It's like take your fallible creation,
your puppet and

1714
01:36:13,590 --> 01:36:18,590
set up the pre,
set up the conditions such that it's 

1715
01:36:18,590 --> 01:36:20,120
capable of taking on full functional 
independence.

1716
01:36:20,450 --> 01:36:21,950
It's something like that,
so that's what you do.

1717
01:36:21,951 --> 01:36:23,330
If you're a good parent with your 
children,

1718
01:36:23,331 --> 01:36:25,940
you don't protect them,
you don't offer them safety,

1719
01:36:26,210 --> 01:36:31,210
you know,
do any of that except insofar as it's 

1720
01:36:31,210 --> 01:36:33,611
necessary to facilitate their 
development as fully competent and 

1721
01:36:35,481 --> 01:36:40,481
courageous beings that the purpose of 
the protection is only to allow that 

1722
01:36:40,481 --> 01:36:41,570
developmental process to,
to continue.

1723
01:36:41,571 --> 01:36:46,571
So you,
you've Orient Japan himself and so the 

1724
01:36:46,571 --> 01:36:48,650
father orients himself and then the sun 
undertakes the voyage.

1725
01:36:49,010 --> 01:36:51,020
And so.
Alright,

1726
01:36:51,080 --> 01:36:56,080
so let's say that that's the case.
You Orient Yourself first,

1727
01:36:56,710 --> 01:37:01,710
then you can start to rely on your.
Then you can start to concentrate more 

1728
01:37:01,710 --> 01:37:03,160
on your orientation to the moment.

1729
01:37:04,430 --> 01:37:04,760
Now

1730
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:09,050
I'm going to tell you another story.
So you know,

1731
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,280
I was just watching Harry Potter the 
other day,

1732
01:37:11,281 --> 01:37:16,281
the first one and I was watching the 
quidditch game and the quidditch game is

1733
01:37:16,771 --> 01:37:19,980
very interesting because there's a game 
and a game going on at the same time.

1734
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:22,860
So the game is just the standard 
quidditch game.

1735
01:37:22,861 --> 01:37:24,780
It's kind of like basketball played on 
Brooms,

1736
01:37:24,781 --> 01:37:29,781
right?
You have to throw balls through hoops 

1737
01:37:29,781 --> 01:37:29,781
and if you get enough points you win.
But at the same time,

1738
01:37:29,850 --> 01:37:33,150
so there's the normal players and then 
there's two seekers,

1739
01:37:33,151 --> 01:37:38,151
one from each team and the seekers 
aren't playing the same game that the 

1740
01:37:38,280 --> 01:37:40,770
game is nested inside the secret game 
actually,

1741
01:37:40,771 --> 01:37:44,490
because if you're a seeker and you 
perform your task that everyone wins,

1742
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:46,590
you win.
But everyone wins.

1743
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:49,020
And so you're not even playing the 
normal game.

1744
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:50,550
You're playing the seeker game.

1745
01:37:50,550 --> 01:37:52,200
And the thing that,
that,

1746
01:37:52,440 --> 01:37:53,070
that,
uh,

1747
01:37:53,370 --> 01:37:57,000
Harry Potter chases is this thing called
snitch and the snitch.

1748
01:37:57,030 --> 01:38:02,030
This is one of the things that I can't,
I don't know how the hell jk rowling 

1749
01:38:02,030 --> 01:38:05,900
figured this out.
I cannot figure it out because that 

1750
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:05,900
snitch is a winged ball.
Right?

1751
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:10,430
And there's,
there's actually a symbol of that wing 

1752
01:38:10,430 --> 01:38:11,580
ball called the round chaos,
which [inaudible] describes in his works

1753
01:38:11,581 --> 01:38:13,170
on alchemy.
And his works on how it could be,

1754
01:38:13,171 --> 01:38:14,370
are really,
really difficult.

1755
01:38:14,371 --> 01:38:16,500
It's not easy to figure out what he's 
talking about at all.

1756
01:38:16,980 --> 01:38:20,380
But the round chaos,
which is a wing ball is,

1757
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:25,440
is it's a manifestation of the spirit.
Mercury and mercury is an emissary of 

1758
01:38:26,041 --> 01:38:31,041
the God.
So you can think about mercury has the 

1759
01:38:31,041 --> 01:38:33,240
unconscious manifesting itself in your,
in your field of experience,

1760
01:38:33,241 --> 01:38:35,520
something like that.
In any case,

1761
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:40,820
the round chaos is the container of the 
primordial material from which the world

1762
01:38:42,991 --> 01:38:45,780
is made.
And I think about it like this.

1763
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:50,940
It's this thing there.
It's that.

1764
01:38:52,050 --> 01:38:55,800
So when you encounter an normally an 
error,

1765
01:38:57,150 --> 01:39:00,030
it's a container that's a way of 
conceptualizing it.

1766
01:39:00,450 --> 01:39:02,190
And what does it contain?
Well,

1767
01:39:02,191 --> 01:39:05,370
it contains in some sense it contains 
the whole world.

1768
01:39:05,690 --> 01:39:07,020
But,
but here's an example.

1769
01:39:07,290 --> 01:39:08,310
Like look,
let's say,

1770
01:39:09,780 --> 01:39:14,780
Oh God,
let's say that you've had repeated 

1771
01:39:14,780 --> 01:39:17,190
fights with your wife about how domestic
duties are going to be arranged among,

1772
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:19,860
around meal time,
and you believe me,

1773
01:39:19,861 --> 01:39:24,861
you're going to have those fights.
And so and so what's happening is that 

1774
01:39:24,861 --> 01:39:28,950
mealtimes are unpleasant because there's
a war for power going on in the kitchen,

1775
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:34,700
right?
And so then you think one day while 

1776
01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:37,941
you're gonna you're gonna note that,
and you're going to do an archaeological

1777
01:39:39,531 --> 01:39:41,990
investigation and find out just what the
hell is going on.

1778
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:48,160
And so you start unpacking the fact that
mealtimes are not pleasant.

1779
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:52,990
And so what's in that little thing that 
you're unpacking that package?

1780
01:39:52,991 --> 01:39:53,260
Well,

1781
01:39:54,730 --> 01:39:58,720
the entire power dynamic between men and
women in the modern world is inside that

1782
01:39:59,140 --> 01:40:04,140
dispute and you might find that part of 
the reason that your wife is upset about

1783
01:40:04,721 --> 01:40:09,721
the way that mealtimes are arranged 
because because her grand mother was 

1784
01:40:09,821 --> 01:40:14,821
beat by her grandfather and that's 
playing a role in it played a role in 

1785
01:40:15,821 --> 01:40:20,821
determining her unconscious expectations
and that's pathologizing one of the day 

1786
01:40:20,821 --> 01:40:23,770
to day rituals in the house.
And if you're going to unpack that,

1787
01:40:23,771 --> 01:40:26,430
you're going to have to unpack all of 
that into the.

1788
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:29,350
You take a little monster new,
decompose it.

1789
01:40:29,370 --> 01:40:34,370
You find out it's a hydrates,
got 50 heads and then you have to work 

1790
01:40:34,370 --> 01:40:35,200
through every single one of those.
It's really,

1791
01:40:35,201 --> 01:40:38,920
really difficult and so it's a container
that contains everything,

1792
01:40:38,921 --> 01:40:40,990
but the thing is if you want packet 
successfully,

1793
01:40:41,020 --> 01:40:42,820
let's say,
and you deal with it,

1794
01:40:42,910 --> 01:40:46,270
you negotiate a consensus,
then all of a sudden you get,

1795
01:40:46,330 --> 01:40:48,100
you get paced,
say around your meal times,

1796
01:40:48,101 --> 01:40:53,101
which is a major accomplishment man,
because you have to eat three times a 

1797
01:40:53,101 --> 01:40:54,220
day and it's the center,
the household and all of that.

1798
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:59,220
So,
but the thing is is that often when 

1799
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:03,811
you're,
especially in the context of a of an 

1800
01:41:03,811 --> 01:41:06,151
intimate relationship,
things will emerge that produced 

1801
01:41:06,151 --> 01:41:09,080
discontinuities and the question is,
what should your attitude towards that 

1802
01:41:09,080 --> 01:41:12,391
discontinuity be?
While you can punish the person for 

1803
01:41:12,391 --> 01:41:13,750
manifesting the discontinuity,
that's the tyrannical aspect,

1804
01:41:13,751 --> 01:41:17,170
or you can let it take the whole thing 
apart and that will happen.

1805
01:41:17,171 --> 01:41:22,171
I mean that's often how relationships 
and is that a discontinuity emerges and 

1806
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:25,900
people get into it and things go 
sideways so badly.

1807
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:29,680
The whole relationship descends into 
chaos and people bail out of it.

1808
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:35,640
So.
So it's no wonder that people want to 

1809
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:37,000
ignore it and it's also no wonder that 
they want to tyrannized it.

1810
01:41:37,030 --> 01:41:38,920
It's like,
quit bothering me with that.

1811
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:39,760
Well

1812
01:41:42,860 --> 01:41:44,900
possibly,
but probably not.

1813
01:41:44,901 --> 01:41:48,770
And also if my attitude towards you is 
quit bothering me with that,

1814
01:41:49,220 --> 01:41:52,610
your attitude towards me when I have the
same sort of problem in reverse,

1815
01:41:52,611 --> 01:41:56,270
it's going to be exactly the same and so
we're not going to get anywhere with it.

1816
01:41:57,470 --> 01:41:58,350
All right?

1817
01:41:59,030 --> 01:42:04,030
But that still is painful.
Now let's go back to the quidditch 

1818
01:42:05,270 --> 01:42:06,020
issue.
Now,

1819
01:42:06,050 --> 01:42:07,190
here's what happens is that

1820
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:12,320
Harry Potter is picked to be the seeker.
So with that being,

1821
01:42:12,321 --> 01:42:16,120
t is the secret.
Whatever he represents is the seeker and

1822
01:42:16,510 --> 01:42:21,510
he's an interesting character because 
he's touched by evil and he's a rule 

1823
01:42:21,510 --> 01:42:23,350
breaker and he's also kind of a normal 
kid.

1824
01:42:23,351 --> 01:42:25,120
He's not a hyper intellect or anything 
like that.

1825
01:42:25,121 --> 01:42:26,140
That's her mind.
These role,

1826
01:42:26,141 --> 01:42:27,610
right?
So He's,

1827
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:28,840
he's,
he's normal but,

1828
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:32,320
but super normal at the same time.
And he gets picked to be the seeker and,

1829
01:42:32,630 --> 01:42:37,630
and then you think about what is it he 
seeks and he seeks this thing that 

1830
01:42:37,630 --> 01:42:37,630
glimmers,
right?

1831
01:42:37,740 --> 01:42:41,380
It flashes in front of it.
It's made out of gold and it has wings.

1832
01:42:41,770 --> 01:42:45,100
And if he grabs it,
then he wins.

1833
01:42:45,610 --> 01:42:48,280
And so the question is,
what does that represent?

1834
01:42:48,820 --> 01:42:53,820
Now,
it's interesting that when people watch 

1835
01:42:53,820 --> 01:42:53,820
that movie,
they actually find that,

1836
01:42:53,820 --> 01:42:53,820
you know,
they think that that's kind of cool,

1837
01:42:53,820 --> 01:42:54,130
that it's a cool game.

1838
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:56,890
Um,
and it is a cool game.

1839
01:42:57,010 --> 01:42:59,200
She laid it out very nicely.
And the idea is that,

1840
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:01,120
well,
there's a game and if you play it,

1841
01:43:01,121 --> 01:43:04,360
normally you win the game,
but in that game is a metagame.

1842
01:43:04,361 --> 01:43:06,400
And if you play that properly,
then not only do you win,

1843
01:43:06,401 --> 01:43:11,401
but everybody wins.
So then the next rule is the metagame 

1844
01:43:11,401 --> 01:43:14,701
supersedes the gate.
And that's the same idea that I'm 

1845
01:43:14,701 --> 01:43:16,630
chasing here with you today about this 
metta morality.

1846
01:43:16,720 --> 01:43:21,720
It's the,
it's the morality that emerges as a 

1847
01:43:21,720 --> 01:43:22,210
consequence of the analysis of a set of 
moralities or it's the morality.

1848
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:26,740
It's the morality to which other all 
other morality's should be subjugated.

1849
01:43:26,741 --> 01:43:29,560
That's another way of thinking about it.
And I said,

1850
01:43:29,561 --> 01:43:31,250
well,
that's a terrible thing because it,

1851
01:43:31,540 --> 01:43:36,540
it involves painful sacrifice or maybe 
it involves confronting the thing you 

1852
01:43:36,540 --> 01:43:37,300
least want to confront.
That's the union dictum,

1853
01:43:37,301 --> 01:43:37,570
right?

1854
01:43:37,990 --> 01:43:39,940
If your life isn't all that it should 
be,

1855
01:43:39,941 --> 01:43:43,420
then you should find out the thing that 
you least want to confront,

1856
01:43:43,450 --> 01:43:46,390
that you're avoiding and confront that 
and that's easy to say,

1857
01:43:46,720 --> 01:43:51,720
but it's a terrible thing because it 
means you're going to have to turn your 

1858
01:43:51,720 --> 01:43:54,230
gaze to the place where you are weakest 
and most vulnerable and that is asking a

1859
01:43:54,231 --> 01:43:57,020
lot of people.
So then you might say,

1860
01:43:57,021 --> 01:43:58,340
well,
is there an alternative?

1861
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:01,810
And I think there is an alternative.
So.

1862
01:44:01,830 --> 01:44:03,290
So this is the anomaly,
right?

1863
01:44:03,291 --> 01:44:04,880
This is the ball that contains 
everything.

1864
01:44:05,210 --> 01:44:08,360
I think there is an alternative.
I think it's associated with this idea.

1865
01:44:08,630 --> 01:44:09,980
So imagine,

1866
01:44:12,380 --> 01:44:15,020
imagine we have a.
We could have a conflict.

1867
01:44:15,110 --> 01:44:20,110
If we were in a relationship,
we can have a conflict that would blow 

1868
01:44:20,110 --> 01:44:20,110
the relationship apart.
All right,

1869
01:44:20,110 --> 01:44:24,431
so we don't want to have that conflict 
and then we could have no conflict 

1870
01:44:24,431 --> 01:44:28,211
whatsoever,
which means that you would never get to 

1871
01:44:28,211 --> 01:44:30,641
say what you wanted and I would never 
get to say what I wanted because we're 

1872
01:44:30,641 --> 01:44:34,481
either identical,
which is just not happening or we're 

1873
01:44:34,481 --> 01:44:37,751
going to have conflict because you're 
going to want some things that I don't 

1874
01:44:37,751 --> 01:44:38,360
want and vice versa.
So if there's no conflict,

1875
01:44:38,361 --> 01:44:40,520
we are not in a relationship,
right?

1876
01:44:40,521 --> 01:44:45,521
So zero conflict is the wrong amount and
conflict that destroys the relationship 

1877
01:44:45,521 --> 01:44:47,450
is the wrong amount.
And then you might say,

1878
01:44:47,930 --> 01:44:49,400
well,
okay,

1879
01:44:49,610 --> 01:44:51,920
what's the optimal amount of conflict?

1880
01:44:53,260 --> 01:44:53,890
Well,
so,

1881
01:44:53,980 --> 01:44:58,980
so,
so then we can think about how people 

1882
01:44:58,980 --> 01:45:01,321
respond emotionally.
So let's say if you go after the person 

1883
01:45:01,321 --> 01:45:05,041
that you're arguing with and you say 
you're a bad person and you really make 

1884
01:45:05,041 --> 01:45:05,860
that case,
you bloody well hammered home.

1885
01:45:05,861 --> 01:45:09,490
You remember 50 things they've done that
were bad and you lay them out like,

1886
01:45:09,510 --> 01:45:11,650
I'm going to stomp you.
You're a bad person.

1887
01:45:11,651 --> 01:45:13,240
You really need to change.
Okay,

1888
01:45:13,241 --> 01:45:18,241
well first of all,
you're going to meet tremendous 

1889
01:45:18,241 --> 01:45:18,241
resistance and that's like you've got 
the hydrogen.

1890
01:45:18,241 --> 01:45:19,360
You're bringing the hydrogen bomb to the
war,

1891
01:45:19,750 --> 01:45:24,750
right,
and maybe unless you want to destroy 

1892
01:45:24,750 --> 01:45:26,851
everything,
maybe that's not the most logical 

1893
01:45:26,851 --> 01:45:26,851
solution,
but then by the same token,

1894
01:45:26,851 --> 01:45:28,990
everything's all right and we never have
any conflict.

1895
01:45:28,991 --> 01:45:33,991
That's not helpful either and you're 
going to get bored of that and you're 

1896
01:45:33,991 --> 01:45:34,480
not going to develop and so then the 
question is,

1897
01:45:34,481 --> 01:45:37,000
well,
maybe there's some happy medium here.

1898
01:45:37,780 --> 01:45:40,930
Maybe you want to be repairing this 
structure.

1899
01:45:41,140 --> 01:45:46,140
You know the structure that goes from 
micro actions up to higher order 

1900
01:45:46,140 --> 01:45:49,591
conceptualizations.
Maybe you want to be updating that on a 

1901
01:45:49,591 --> 01:45:52,561
constant basis and you want to update it
in a manner that doesn't drop you into 

1902
01:45:53,111 --> 01:45:57,280
chaos or place you in too much status 
and then the answer is,

1903
01:45:57,281 --> 01:45:57,700
well,
how?

1904
01:45:57,790 --> 01:46:02,790
Then the.
Then the question is how is it that you 

1905
01:46:02,790 --> 01:46:05,731
can calibrate your approach to error so 
that you get the benefits of doing it 

1906
01:46:05,861 --> 01:46:10,350
without the disadvantage of collapsing 
into chaos and then the issue.

1907
01:46:10,390 --> 01:46:15,390
The answer to that is something like 
it's something like once you have 

1908
01:46:20,141 --> 01:46:25,141
decided to adopt responsibility for 
being and will say that what that means 

1909
01:46:26,171 --> 01:46:31,171
is that you have conceptualized a,
a good that you're willing to devote 

1910
01:46:33,311 --> 01:46:38,311
yourself to and I think you,
you're perfectly welcome to do that on 

1911
01:46:38,311 --> 01:46:41,821
an individual basis.
I think you should do it on an 

1912
01:46:41,821 --> 01:46:44,401
individual basis.
You should consult with your ancestors 

1913
01:46:44,401 --> 01:46:45,910
while you're doing that because 
generally speaking,

1914
01:46:46,630 --> 01:46:51,630
the route to optimal,
the route to to quality of life and 

1915
01:46:52,531 --> 01:46:56,090
productivity has been laid out by other 
people.

1916
01:46:56,130 --> 01:46:58,130
We we kind of know what the parameters 
are.

1917
01:46:58,460 --> 01:47:02,440
You need to do something that other 
people find is useful and and,

1918
01:47:02,570 --> 01:47:05,090
and you have to regard it as useful as 
well,

1919
01:47:06,350 --> 01:47:09,310
or at least you have to be entertaining.
There has to be something about you have

1920
01:47:09,311 --> 01:47:12,590
value to other people that you have to 
pursue with a fair bit of diligence,

1921
01:47:14,450 --> 01:47:17,030
so you have to play a productive social 
role.

1922
01:47:18,850 --> 01:47:19,990
Probably need friends,

1923
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:26,520
probably need an intimate relationship 
and if it could be medium to long term 

1924
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:28,570
infant intimate relationship,
perhaps all the better.

1925
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:32,350
That's what most societies hold up as 
ideal could assume.

1926
01:47:32,351 --> 01:47:33,910
Well,
there's probably a reason for that.

1927
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:39,120
I think one of the reasons is is that 
your life gets fragmented otherwise 

1928
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:42,181
badly fragmented because every time you 
have a longterm relationship and and it 

1929
01:47:42,491 --> 01:47:47,491
fragments,
it's like your identity is blown into 

1930
01:47:47,491 --> 01:47:47,491
pieces.
You get fragmented across time.

1931
01:47:47,491 --> 01:47:48,220
It's,
it's not.

1932
01:47:48,340 --> 01:47:53,340
It's not good.
It breaks you into pieces and you don't 

1933
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:56,641
necessarily recovered that well.
It makes everything much more 

1934
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:01,150
impermanent and unreliable.
All of those things,

1935
01:48:01,151 --> 01:48:06,151
so it.
It introduces a tremendous amount of 

1936
01:48:06,151 --> 01:48:08,851
uncertainty into your life and it also 
means that you don't have anyone around 

1937
01:48:08,851 --> 01:48:11,701
that you can really trust and that's bad
because if you have someone around you 

1938
01:48:11,701 --> 01:48:14,701
can really trust,
then you have two brains instead of one 

1939
01:48:14,701 --> 01:48:15,460
and like you probably need two brains to
to manage your way through life.

1940
01:48:15,461 --> 01:48:16,510
It's pretty complicated,

1941
01:48:19,340 --> 01:48:21,590
so you orient yourself towards some 
good,

1942
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:27,580
highest good that you can conceptualize,
and it has to be through a consultation 

1943
01:48:27,580 --> 01:48:32,341
with your ancestors because you need to 
do the things that people have always 

1944
01:48:32,341 --> 01:48:35,761
done it and you need to do them properly
and you need to assume that that's the 

1945
01:48:35,761 --> 01:48:39,991
way that you should live unless you have
a very good reason to change it 

1946
01:48:39,991 --> 01:48:43,411
dramatically and maybe you do,
but you got to start with some axiomatic

1947
01:48:43,511 --> 01:48:48,511
set of presuppositions because otherwise
you have to invent everything on your 

1948
01:48:48,511 --> 01:48:48,520
own and you don't have enough time to do
that.

1949
01:48:48,521 --> 01:48:52,270
So you have to use normative guidelines 
and if you don't,

1950
01:48:52,271 --> 01:48:53,710
then people won't know what to do with 
you.

1951
01:48:53,711 --> 01:48:57,040
That's another big problem is if you 
live completely outside the norm.

1952
01:48:57,220 --> 01:48:58,300
I mean,
you know,

1953
01:48:58,540 --> 01:49:01,750
remarkable artists manage that to some 
degree,

1954
01:49:02,020 --> 01:49:04,900
but of course they pay for the privilege
by being remarkable artists.

1955
01:49:04,901 --> 01:49:07,480
So if there's something truly remarkable
about you,

1956
01:49:07,481 --> 01:49:10,660
perhaps you could justify deviating from
the normative path.

1957
01:49:10,661 --> 01:49:13,660
But if there isn't,
first of all,

1958
01:49:13,661 --> 01:49:18,661
there's nothing remarkable enough about 
you to justify deviating in every way 

1959
01:49:18,661 --> 01:49:20,700
from the normative path,
no matter how remarkable or so,

1960
01:49:21,810 --> 01:49:25,080
so that's part of the rescuing of the 
father from the,

1961
01:49:25,530 --> 01:49:29,880
from the depths is to to reunite 
yourself with the traditional structures

1962
01:49:29,881 --> 01:49:34,881
of your community.
You can do that in a way that you feel 

1963
01:49:34,881 --> 01:49:38,600
suits your needs best,
but I don't think you can not do it 

1964
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:40,710
because it makes you weak and then 
you'll drown.

1965
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:47,640
All right,
so let's say you have oriented yourself 

1966
01:49:47,640 --> 01:49:48,100
but not perfectly because you're full

1967
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:51,370
of mistakes and errors.
So then what do you do?

1968
01:49:51,910 --> 01:49:54,670
Because you have to fix those errors,
but you still have to be oriented.

1969
01:49:57,370 --> 01:50:02,370
This is why I started getting interested
to get interested in the phenomenon of 

1970
01:50:02,370 --> 01:50:05,511
meaning as a,
as a phenomenological experience to 

1971
01:50:05,511 --> 01:50:08,070
experience something as meaningful.
It's not exactly obvious what that means

1972
01:50:08,130 --> 01:50:10,830
to experience something as meaningful.
I think that you can.

1973
01:50:11,460 --> 01:50:13,440
You can approach it obliquely,
you know,

1974
01:50:13,441 --> 01:50:18,441
like if I said watch yourself for two 
weeks and notice when you're doing 

1975
01:50:18,441 --> 01:50:19,470
something that you regard as meaningful,
I could say,

1976
01:50:19,471 --> 01:50:20,310
well here,
here's some,

1977
01:50:20,610 --> 01:50:24,270
here's some markers.
You lose a sense of time.

1978
01:50:24,271 --> 01:50:26,820
You lose a sense of vulnerability,
you're deeply engaged in it.

1979
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:29,940
It seems,
it seems worth the effort,

1980
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:35,000
right?
You forget yourself while you're doing 

1981
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,951
it.
Maybe you forget your existential 

1982
01:50:36,951 --> 01:50:39,591
concerns while you're doing it.
You're not ruminating or obsessing about

1983
01:50:39,961 --> 01:50:41,910
the meaning of your life.
Right?

1984
01:50:41,930 --> 01:50:43,170
So,
so there's markers for,

1985
01:50:43,171 --> 01:50:45,930
it's like the flow states that chicks at
my highly described,

1986
01:50:46,870 --> 01:50:47,380
um,

1987
01:50:50,160 --> 01:50:55,160
and then you can experience it.
You experienced it under a certain sort 

1988
01:50:55,160 --> 01:50:58,191
of ritualistic conditions.
You might experience it when you go see 

1989
01:50:58,191 --> 01:51:00,801
a great movie,
you might experience it when you listen 

1990
01:51:00,801 --> 01:51:00,801
to music.
I think music is a very,

1991
01:51:00,801 --> 01:51:04,731
very standard pathway for people to have
that kind of experience because 

1992
01:51:04,731 --> 01:51:09,000
virtually everyone gets intimations of 
mute of meaning from music.

1993
01:51:09,330 --> 01:51:14,330
And I think music music is 
hierarchically structured patterns that 

1994
01:51:14,911 --> 01:51:18,510
are representative of being laying 
itself out properly.

1995
01:51:18,511 --> 01:51:23,511
It's something like that.
So it's an abstract representation of 

1996
01:51:23,511 --> 01:51:26,331
proper being and so we can,
we can grapple with the phenomena of 

1997
01:51:26,581 --> 01:51:28,980
music and we can we can bark or 
phenomena of meaning.

1998
01:51:28,981 --> 01:51:31,380
We can box it in a little bit and start 
to conceptualize it.

1999
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:33,900
W

2000
01:51:34,140 --> 01:51:39,140
we can start to conceptualize it perhaps
as the manifestation of a deep instinct 

2001
01:51:39,140 --> 01:51:43,850
and so I would say well meaning is what 
manifests itself when you are,

2002
01:51:47,130 --> 01:51:52,130
when you've oriented yourself properly 
and when you've optimized the flow of 

2003
01:51:54,690 --> 01:51:59,220
information between you and you,
between you and chaos.

2004
01:51:59,250 --> 01:52:02,610
That might be the right way to thinking 
about it because you think about a piece

2005
01:52:02,611 --> 01:52:04,230
of music because you want it to be 
predictable,

2006
01:52:04,980 --> 01:52:06,930
but you don't want it to be perfectly 
predictable.

2007
01:52:06,931 --> 01:52:11,931
You want it to be predictable with some 
interesting variations and predictable 

2008
01:52:11,931 --> 01:52:15,651
with some variations that make sense.
And maybe you can conceptualize that as 

2009
01:52:15,651 --> 01:52:18,531
something like this.
It's like it's predictable that this 

2010
01:52:18,531 --> 01:52:19,940
order of of stability,
but it's.

2011
01:52:20,020 --> 01:52:25,020
It's varying down here from time to time
and so you've got stable stability 

2012
01:52:25,021 --> 01:52:27,420
there,
but variability there and you can handle

2013
01:52:27,421 --> 01:52:28,890
that.
So you want

2014
01:52:30,460 --> 01:52:35,460
an overarching structure,
stability with some internal 

2015
01:52:35,460 --> 01:52:36,100
variability,
and maybe that's the way that you update

2016
01:52:36,101 --> 01:52:41,101
yourself without falling apart.
And then I would say you can find the 

2017
01:52:41,101 --> 01:52:45,061
pathway to the optimal rate of update by
relying on your sense of meaning.

2018
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:50,270
That's what it's for.
What it tells you is that you're.

2019
01:52:50,420 --> 01:52:55,420
You're wandering your way through the 
world between the catastrophes of chaos 

2020
01:52:55,891 --> 01:53:00,230
in the catastrophes of order and now and
then you swing into the proper locale.

2021
01:53:00,630 --> 01:53:05,630
You're where you should be.
And what happens is you get engaged by 

2022
01:53:05,630 --> 01:53:06,440
that.
You get meaningfully engaged by that and

2023
01:53:06,441 --> 01:53:07,970
it's fragile.
It'll move on you,

2024
01:53:07,971 --> 01:53:12,971
right?
Because it's very difficult to exist at 

2025
01:53:12,971 --> 01:53:14,120
that point constantly.
Your bad habits,

2026
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:16,010
all sorts of things.
Your situation,

2027
01:53:16,130 --> 01:53:18,110
there's all sorts of things that are 
going to interfere with that,

2028
01:53:18,290 --> 01:53:21,410
but that doesn't mean that that isn't 
where you should be.

2029
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:23,030
And so then you might say,
well,

2030
01:53:23,031 --> 01:53:25,760
that's where you should strive to be all
the time.

2031
01:53:26,300 --> 01:53:27,680
And then the question might be,
well,

2032
01:53:27,681 --> 01:53:30,410
what would it be like if you were there 
all the time?

2033
01:53:30,890 --> 01:53:35,600
And I think that's where intimations of 
paradise come from,

2034
01:53:36,390 --> 01:53:41,390
being when words think of it was 
wordsworth talked about intimations of 

2035
01:53:41,390 --> 01:53:44,591
immortality and childhood people tend to
romanticize their childhood because of 

2036
01:53:44,591 --> 01:53:47,810
the sense of intense engagement that 
goes along with being a child.

2037
01:53:47,811 --> 01:53:50,060
And it's one of the wonderful things 
about being around children.

2038
01:53:50,061 --> 01:53:50,660
Actually.
It's,

2039
01:53:50,690 --> 01:53:54,440
it's,
it's why they pay you for their care.

2040
01:53:54,980 --> 01:53:59,980
And the way that children pay you for 
their care is that they turn normal 

2041
01:53:59,980 --> 01:54:04,121
things into magic again when you're 
around them because you've seen it 100 

2042
01:54:04,121 --> 01:54:05,660
times before.
And so when you see it,

2043
01:54:05,661 --> 01:54:08,060
you don't see it,
you see what you already know.

2044
01:54:08,510 --> 01:54:11,210
But when a child sees it,
they don't because they don't know,

2045
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:11,960
they see it.

2046
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:14,840
And then when you watch them see it,
you see it too.

2047
01:54:14,990 --> 01:54:19,990
And so it's just,
it's tremendous fun leading a small 

2048
01:54:19,990 --> 01:54:22,160
child around to do things that you've 
done before because they're so,

2049
01:54:22,580 --> 01:54:23,690
you know,
they're like this,

2050
01:54:23,750 --> 01:54:28,750
they're like all the time and you know,
maybe that's too much and they cry and 

2051
01:54:28,750 --> 01:54:29,900
they get upset and all of that.
But a good part of the time,

2052
01:54:29,901 --> 01:54:33,560
it's just wild eyed wonder and then you 
can see the world through their eyes and

2053
01:54:33,561 --> 01:54:38,561
it's payment and so that's that sense of
being engaged like that is something 

2054
01:54:38,561 --> 01:54:41,000
that people love about children and and 
rightly so,

2055
01:54:41,120 --> 01:54:44,720
but it's also a marker to the proper way
of being.

2056
01:54:45,050 --> 01:54:46,820
You know,
there there's a dictum in the.

2057
01:54:47,620 --> 01:54:52,620
This is a union idea that there's no 
difference between the archetype of the 

2058
01:54:52,620 --> 01:54:52,760
wise old man in the archetype of the 
child.

2059
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:58,000
They're the same thing because the wise 
old man is the person who found what he 

2060
01:54:58,000 --> 01:54:59,750
had in childhood but lost,
right?

2061
01:54:59,751 --> 01:55:04,751
It's a very powerful moment.
Teeth is that the purpose of maturation 

2062
01:55:04,751 --> 01:55:07,150
is to return to the state of childhood 
as a mature b.

2063
01:55:07,430 --> 01:55:10,070
not to stay in the state of childhood,
that's Peter Pan,

2064
01:55:10,550 --> 01:55:15,550
but to make the sacrifices necessary for
maturation and then return so well.

2065
01:55:16,761 --> 01:55:17,840
How do you do that?
Well,

2066
01:55:17,870 --> 01:55:22,870
you do that in part by noting what it is
that's meaningful for you to engage in.

2067
01:55:23,270 --> 01:55:25,550
I would say it's your nervous system 
reporting to you,

2068
01:55:25,850 --> 01:55:28,130
right hemisphere and left hemisphere 
balanced.

2069
01:55:28,470 --> 01:55:33,470
The balance between chaos and order 
produces an output that says you are in 

2070
01:55:33,470 --> 01:55:34,310
the right place.
It's a perception.

2071
01:55:34,340 --> 01:55:37,430
The meaning is a perception of being in 
the right place.

2072
01:55:37,580 --> 01:55:39,620
It's the genuine thing.
However,

2073
01:55:40,310 --> 01:55:45,310
because it can be pathologized.
That's the thing and that's why I think 

2074
01:55:45,310 --> 01:55:47,340
there is a call to virtue in most great 
religious traditions.

2075
01:55:47,550 --> 01:55:50,520
If you're going to rely on your sense of
meaning to Orient you,

2076
01:55:51,060 --> 01:55:56,060
you have to play a straight game because
otherwise you warp and twist the inputs 

2077
01:55:56,520 --> 01:55:58,650
and then the mechanism won't function 
properly.

2078
01:55:59,070 --> 01:56:00,120
You know?
It's like if you.

2079
01:56:00,290 --> 01:56:01,380
If you were only.

2080
01:56:02,860 --> 01:56:07,860
If you're.
If you blinded yourself to half the 

2081
01:56:07,860 --> 01:56:10,261
world,
you can't use your perception story at 

2082
01:56:10,261 --> 01:56:10,750
yourself properly because the half of 
the world that you ignoring is gonna pop

2083
01:56:10,751 --> 01:56:13,060
up at you unexpectedly and take you 
down,

2084
01:56:13,420 --> 01:56:16,930
and so if your relationship with the 
world isn't pristine,

2085
01:56:17,150 --> 01:56:18,700
honest,
primarily,

2086
01:56:18,910 --> 01:56:22,840
then you can't rely on your own internal
orienting mechanisms and then you either

2087
01:56:22,900 --> 01:56:27,900
fall into chaos which is an absolute 
catastrophe or you have to rely on some 

2088
01:56:27,900 --> 01:56:31,561
kind of external authority and that 
makes you prone to possession by 

2089
01:56:31,561 --> 01:56:32,650
tyrannical etiologies.
For example,

2090
01:56:32,651 --> 01:56:37,651
which give you that sense of meaning 
that you showed in fact have as a 

2091
01:56:37,651 --> 01:56:37,651
consequence of your own action.

2092
01:56:39,490 --> 01:56:43,670
Sorry,
that's the question as best as I can,

2093
01:56:45,750 --> 01:56:47,890
but okay.
So if,

2094
01:56:48,780 --> 01:56:53,780
if all relationships are,
are sort of predicated on this balance 

2095
01:56:57,941 --> 01:57:02,941
between no conflict and conflict that 
destructs um,

2096
01:57:04,510 --> 01:57:09,510
then if we were,
if we were to look at this at a more 

2097
01:57:09,510 --> 01:57:12,421
macro level,
we see this sort of manifest in,

2098
01:57:14,220 --> 01:57:19,220
in history in our world,
like with conflict in between countries 

2099
01:57:19,220 --> 01:57:19,720
in between systems,
ideology,

2100
01:57:19,730 --> 01:57:24,730
etc.
But what if this sort of navigation 

2101
01:57:24,730 --> 01:57:29,260
between the exact line of no conflict 
versus conflict,

2102
01:57:29,380 --> 01:57:34,360
how does that not imply that some people
are inherently doomed to chaos?

2103
01:57:35,170 --> 01:57:37,540
It might imply that,
you know,

2104
01:57:37,541 --> 01:57:38,860
one of the things,
so look,

2105
01:57:39,020 --> 01:57:42,810
so sometimes,

2106
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:44,800
right?

2107
01:57:45,200 --> 01:57:47,450
Sometimes you don't have an answer that 
works.

2108
01:57:48,890 --> 01:57:51,860
You've announced that produces the 
highest proBability of success.

2109
01:57:52,580 --> 01:57:57,580
And like I could view the archetype of 
world from a religious perspective and 

2110
01:57:57,580 --> 01:58:01,280
say that there's such a thing as 
ultimate and final redemption.

2111
01:58:01,310 --> 01:58:02,970
That's a metaphysical claim.
I don't,

2112
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:08,160
I don't want to do that.
I think it's independent of what I'm 

2113
01:58:08,160 --> 01:58:10,241
talking about.
What I'm saying is that there's an 

2114
01:58:10,241 --> 01:58:13,121
archetypal path that's laid out in,
in the mythology of the hero and it's 

2115
01:58:13,121 --> 01:58:13,880
your best bet.
That's all.

2116
01:58:14,210 --> 01:58:19,210
It's your best bet.
It doesn't mean that if you apply it 

2117
01:58:19,210 --> 01:58:21,770
that everything is going to turn out the
way you might want it to turn out,

2118
01:58:21,771 --> 01:58:23,330
but.
But I would say this,

2119
01:58:23,480 --> 01:58:28,480
there is a way of of.
There's an interesting twist on that to 

2120
01:58:28,480 --> 01:58:32,200
mrs.
One of the things that I came to 

2121
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:33,641
understand about trying to speak the 
truth is that you can make an 

2122
01:58:33,841 --> 01:58:38,841
assumption.
You can make a fundamental assumption 

2123
01:58:38,841 --> 01:58:41,960
based on your ignorance.
Let's say I'm the ineradicable quality 

2124
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:44,710
of your ignorance,
that you can't compute the best possible

2125
01:58:44,711 --> 01:58:49,711
outcome.
What you can do instead is make a 

2126
01:58:49,711 --> 01:58:49,711
decision and one decision is,
well,

2127
01:58:49,711 --> 01:58:50,590
I'm going to say what I think and see 
what happens,

2128
01:58:52,190 --> 01:58:54,750
and then you can define that as the best
possible outcome.

2129
01:58:55,370 --> 01:59:00,370
Now you might say,
well now and then that's going to lead 

2130
01:59:00,370 --> 01:59:00,370
you into chaos.
It's like,

2131
01:59:00,370 --> 01:59:00,370
yeah,
it is.

2132
01:59:00,370 --> 01:59:00,950
It is.
It's a strange.

2133
01:59:00,980 --> 01:59:05,760
It's a strange inversion,
but regardless of all that,

2134
01:59:05,761 --> 01:59:10,380
I would still say human beings are 
finite and limited in mortal,

2135
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:12,600
you know,
and and death is final,

2136
01:59:12,630 --> 01:59:14,700
let's say.
I'm not saying that,

2137
01:59:14,701 --> 01:59:17,580
but we could easily say that doesn't 
matter.

2138
01:59:17,610 --> 01:59:21,360
This is still the best pathway forward.
It isn't certainty.

2139
01:59:21,420 --> 01:59:22,260
There's no certainty

2140
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:28,840
and it's very frequently in life.
You have poison oak or poison be like 

2141
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:32,231
you get to pick your poison.
You don't get to pick the elixir of 

2142
01:59:32,231 --> 01:59:32,231
life.
But I would,

2143
01:59:32,231 --> 01:59:36,970
but I wouldn't say.
I would also say I don't think there's 

2144
01:59:36,970 --> 01:59:38,831
any reason to be particularly 
pessimistic because we don't know what 

2145
01:59:38,831 --> 01:59:40,070
would happen if people really tried hard
to get their acts together.

2146
01:59:40,390 --> 01:59:43,820
Like if they understood the necessity of
that and really put it forward.

2147
01:59:43,821 --> 01:59:45,310
I mean,
I mean,

2148
01:59:45,320 --> 01:59:50,320
I've,
I've had lots of experience with my 

2149
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:51,971
clinical clients now.
I've seen dozens and dozens of people 

2150
01:59:51,971 --> 01:59:55,360
and we have tried jointly to get their 
lives straight her and it works almost 

2151
01:59:56,271 --> 01:59:57,230
inevitably.
Now.

2152
01:59:57,231 --> 01:59:59,240
That doesn't mean I've had clients who 
died,

2153
01:59:59,650 --> 02:00:04,650
you know,
we were three quarters through a 

2154
02:00:04,650 --> 02:00:07,660
wonderful process of psychological 
renovation and they got cancer and died 

2155
02:00:07,660 --> 02:00:07,940
so,
so there's,

2156
02:00:08,120 --> 02:00:10,580
there's no certainty associated with 
this,

2157
02:00:11,150 --> 02:00:15,350
but it's the best solution available.

2158
02:00:16,250 --> 02:00:21,250
And,
and it's also possible that it's a good 

2159
02:00:21,250 --> 02:00:21,250
enough solution.
No,

2160
02:00:21,250 --> 02:00:23,690
I was talking to my class yesterday 
about this,

2161
02:00:23,780 --> 02:00:24,570
you know,
so you,

2162
02:00:25,310 --> 02:00:28,640
if you pursue the things in your life 
that are meaningful once you've oriented

2163
02:00:28,641 --> 02:00:33,641
yourself and that means accepting the 
challenges that come along with that 

2164
02:00:33,641 --> 02:00:33,641
because one of the things that you'll 
find,

2165
02:00:33,641 --> 02:00:36,680
you even find this in music,
if you know a piece of music completely,

2166
02:00:37,040 --> 02:00:39,080
then you tend not to want to listen to 
it anymore.

2167
02:00:39,560 --> 02:00:41,210
There's still has to be some challenge 
in it.

2168
02:00:41,211 --> 02:00:43,970
You still have to track it and sometimes
music is so complex,

2169
02:00:43,971 --> 02:00:45,980
you just can't.
It just sounds like noise.

2170
02:00:46,010 --> 02:00:48,050
Modern music is often like that because 
it's so.

2171
02:00:48,500 --> 02:00:53,500
Well,
it tends towards the chaotic and so 

2172
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:53,570
it's,
I find it difficult to listen to because

2173
02:00:53,571 --> 02:00:56,120
I can't get a handle on it.
But then you know,

2174
02:00:56,390 --> 02:00:57,470
so it's too challenging.

2175
02:00:57,470 --> 02:01:00,050
And then there's other music.
Pop music is often like this,

2176
02:01:00,051 --> 02:01:01,820
it's catchy.
The first two times you hear it and then

2177
02:01:01,821 --> 02:01:03,800
you never want to hear it again.
It's too much.

2178
02:01:03,801 --> 02:01:05,960
There's too much predictability and not 
enough chaos.

2179
02:01:05,961 --> 02:01:10,961
And hopefully you find a piece of music 
that somewhere in the middle you can 

2180
02:01:10,961 --> 02:01:11,840
listen to it 50 or 100 times and each 
time you listen to it,

2181
02:01:11,841 --> 02:01:14,660
there's still some new nuance in it that
you didn't,

2182
02:01:15,200 --> 02:01:18,920
that you didn't expect before.
And so why don't you kind of want to set

2183
02:01:18,921 --> 02:01:20,810
up your life like that.
So that.

2184
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:26,800
And I think you see that the phenomena 
of meaning manifest itself at the area,

2185
02:01:28,220 --> 02:01:32,810
at the locale of optimal challenge.
So if the thing.

2186
02:01:32,811 --> 02:01:34,760
So one of the things,
for example,

2187
02:01:34,970 --> 02:01:39,970
I might say,
well let's say you want to set some 

2188
02:01:39,970 --> 02:01:39,970
goals for yourself.
We say,

2189
02:01:39,970 --> 02:01:41,990
well they're remarkable goals,
but they're all there too unattainable.

2190
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:44,930
You're just gonna find it frustrating to
pursue them.

2191
02:01:45,860 --> 02:01:48,290
It's going to be too punishing.
And then we might say,

2192
02:01:48,291 --> 02:01:50,000
well,
here's a goal and you think,

2193
02:01:50,001 --> 02:01:50,750
well,
I could do that.

2194
02:01:50,850 --> 02:01:52,400
You know,
standing on my head,

2195
02:01:52,430 --> 02:01:53,660
there's nothing,
no challenge in it.

2196
02:01:54,050 --> 02:01:59,050
Well,
both of those two extremes are gonna 

2197
02:01:59,050 --> 02:02:00,550
leave you in a state that isn't 
characterized by the optimization of 

2198
02:02:00,550 --> 02:02:02,750
engagement and meaning.
One is too difficult to punishing.

2199
02:02:02,930 --> 02:02:06,580
It's the judge and nothing else,
and the other is the ultimate unmerciful

2200
02:02:06,620 --> 02:02:11,620
mothers.
It's like you win no matter how you 

2201
02:02:11,620 --> 02:02:11,620
play.
So then you calibrate it.

2202
02:02:11,620 --> 02:02:11,620
Say,
well,

2203
02:02:11,620 --> 02:02:12,200
you know,
I need,

2204
02:02:12,920 --> 02:02:15,440
I'm,
I'm up for a challenge at this level.

2205
02:02:18,340 --> 02:02:22,690
I wouldn't recommend that because that's
just a bit like people do that you might

2206
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:27,720
want to investigate your character in 
detail and decide you know what's going 

2207
02:02:27,720 --> 02:02:30,040
on at this level of analysis.
That's pretty harsh,

2208
02:02:30,250 --> 02:02:35,250
but you can certainly continually retool
yourself at more micro levels and that,

2209
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:41,160
and I think what you do is you pick the 
level of retooling that optimizes your 

2210
02:02:41,861 --> 02:02:46,861
willing to be engaged in it.
And then what's so interesting about 

2211
02:02:46,861 --> 02:02:50,770
that is that I think is that you get the
benefits of perfection,

2212
02:02:51,190 --> 02:02:53,740
so to speak,
while still being imperfect.

2213
02:02:54,580 --> 02:02:59,580
The imperfect,
your actual imperfection has nothing to 

2214
02:02:59,580 --> 02:03:02,041
do with it.
What's relevant is the journey is the 

2215
02:03:02,041 --> 02:03:03,100
journey that you're undertaking to 
rectify the imperfection.

2216
02:03:03,490 --> 02:03:07,630
So instead of aiming to be that entity 
without flaws,

2217
02:03:07,870 --> 02:03:12,870
you're aiming to be the entity that 
continues to realize its flaws and 

2218
02:03:12,870 --> 02:03:12,870
overcome them.
Well,

2219
02:03:12,870 --> 02:03:13,780
that's a game you can play forever.

2220
02:03:14,020 --> 02:03:17,680
And that's maybe the ultimate in being 
an unflawed entity.

2221
02:03:17,710 --> 02:03:19,490
It's something like that.
So.

2222
02:03:19,640 --> 02:03:21,400
So I want to show you some pictures that
are,

2223
02:03:21,401 --> 02:03:26,050
think are associated with that.
So this one to begin with,

2224
02:03:27,160 --> 02:03:29,710
this is an absolutely amazing picture,
I think.

2225
02:03:30,230 --> 02:03:34,840
So this is bert hold firt mayan tree of 
life flanked by yves and mary ecclesia,

2226
02:03:36,010 --> 02:03:41,010
and this in some sense this,
this picture summarizes the biblical 

2227
02:03:41,010 --> 02:03:41,770
stories in one picture,
which is,

2228
02:03:41,980 --> 02:03:44,380
that's pretty amazing that,
that a picture can do that.

2229
02:03:44,980 --> 02:03:47,080
And so I'll,
let me explain the picture a little bit.

2230
02:03:47,081 --> 02:03:49,900
So the first thing you see here is that 
this is the tree.

2231
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:52,520
This is the tree of life.

2232
02:03:54,170 --> 02:03:58,520
And so it echoes the tree of the 
knowledge of good and evil,

2233
02:03:59,630 --> 02:04:03,620
but this is post fall.
So we interpreted that story of adam and

2234
02:04:03,621 --> 02:04:04,510
eve already.
He said,

2235
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:07,070
human beings became self conscious,
they discovered death,

2236
02:04:07,100 --> 02:04:12,100
they discovered morality.
It was all a consequence of interacting 

2237
02:04:12,100 --> 02:04:13,190
with the fruit and the snake,
something like that,

2238
02:04:13,191 --> 02:04:16,190
and you can read that as an as an 
evolutionary tail.

2239
02:04:17,090 --> 02:04:22,090
You can at least read it as a 
representation of the emergence of self 

2240
02:04:22,090 --> 02:04:23,390
consciousness and human beings,
and so what does that mean?

2241
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:28,680
Well,
It means that the apple in some sense 

2242
02:04:28,680 --> 02:04:29,570
was equivalent to death and that's what 
you see here.

2243
02:04:29,571 --> 02:04:31,880
You see this picking fruit from the tree
here,

2244
02:04:32,300 --> 02:04:37,300
but the fruit is.
It's on the skull side of the tree and 

2245
02:04:37,300 --> 02:04:38,790
so eve,
it's the vulnerability of eve.

2246
02:04:39,250 --> 02:04:41,370
She's naked there and displayed to the 
world.

2247
02:04:41,371 --> 02:04:43,020
It's the vulnerability of eve.

2248
02:04:43,080 --> 02:04:45,840
That's one way of thinking about it was 
the vulnerability of eve.

2249
02:04:46,140 --> 02:04:51,140
That was the catalyst to the development
of human self consciousness and I think 

2250
02:04:51,140 --> 02:04:55,881
that that's true.
It seems to be to be a reasonable 

2251
02:04:55,881 --> 02:04:59,660
proposition,
and so eve eve's relationship with the 

2252
02:05:00,121 --> 02:05:04,980
fruit and the snake doomed human beings 
to the realization of mortality.

2253
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:07,830
that's what this side of the picture 
represents,

2254
02:05:09,060 --> 02:05:14,060
and so it's a catastrophe and it's 
associated with here with the snake and 

2255
02:05:14,060 --> 02:05:15,960
the fruit.
It's human beings attempts to understand

2256
02:05:15,961 --> 02:05:18,390
how it is that they emerged into a self 
conscious world.

2257
02:05:19,200 --> 02:05:19,950
Okay,
so fine.

2258
02:05:19,951 --> 02:05:23,490
So that's on.
This is on the fall end of the story and

2259
02:05:23,491 --> 02:05:26,370
this is on the solution end of the 
story.

2260
02:05:26,371 --> 02:05:31,371
Now what you see here,
there's a skull there and there's a 

2261
02:05:31,371 --> 02:05:32,910
crucifix here and you see there's all 
these little fruits on this tree,

2262
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:38,360
so it's the apple of death that eve is 
handing out on this side and it's the 

2263
02:05:38,360 --> 02:05:39,870
host that that plays a role in the 
cannibalistic,

2264
02:05:39,871 --> 02:05:40,110
right?

2265
02:05:40,110 --> 02:05:43,530
That's at the center of christian ritual
that mary,

2266
02:05:43,531 --> 02:05:47,430
as the church is handing out as a 
medication for this.

2267
02:05:48,180 --> 02:05:51,570
So she's handing out the antidote.
Well,

2268
02:05:51,571 --> 02:05:53,070
what's the antidote?
Well,

2269
02:05:53,100 --> 02:05:58,100
it's a strange thing.
It's associated with this crucifix and 

2270
02:05:58,100 --> 02:05:59,020
that's translated into this wheat and 
host,

2271
02:05:59,021 --> 02:06:04,021
so you're supposed to eat that and that.
That is the incorporation of whatever 

2272
02:06:04,021 --> 02:06:05,220
this represents.
Well,

2273
02:06:05,221 --> 02:06:07,890
the question then is what does that 
represent?

2274
02:06:07,891 --> 02:06:09,930
It's assist.
It's a symbol of suffering.

2275
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:12,840
Obviously it's a symbol of the ultimate 
end suffering.

2276
02:06:12,841 --> 02:06:17,841
It's the weirdest thing because the 
picture proposes that to ingest,

2277
02:06:18,061 --> 02:06:23,061
the ultimate in suffering is to 
simultaneously ingest the antidote to 

2278
02:06:25,170 --> 02:06:27,060
the catastrophe of the knowledge of 
death.

2279
02:06:27,510 --> 02:06:31,050
It's very strange paradox,
but but it's the.

2280
02:06:31,230 --> 02:06:33,930
It's the proper paradox that's at the 
center of this,

2281
02:06:33,990 --> 02:06:36,420
of the great drama that's represented by
this picture.

2282
02:06:39,780 --> 02:06:42,750
A little knowledge of death destroys 
you.

2283
02:06:44,790 --> 02:06:47,850
Full voluntary acceptance of it is the 
cure.

2284
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:51,180
That's the idea.
Well,

2285
02:06:51,181 --> 02:06:53,190
that's a.
That's a hell of an idea.

2286
02:06:56,010 --> 02:07:01,010
It's not only to and to accept it is 
simultaneously in some sense to take 

2287
02:07:02,761 --> 02:07:04,170
responsibility for it

2288
02:07:06,220 --> 02:07:09,730
because you don't take responsibility 
for things that you don't accept.

2289
02:07:11,740 --> 02:07:14,230
You only take responsibility for things 
that you do accept,

2290
02:07:14,450 --> 02:07:14,860
say,
well,

2291
02:07:14,861 --> 02:07:19,861
the world is fundamentally flawed 
because its fundamental nature is 

2292
02:07:20,140 --> 02:07:22,210
vulnerability,
intolerable vulnerability.

2293
02:07:22,960 --> 02:07:24,840
I'm not going to take any responsibility
for that.

2294
02:07:24,940 --> 02:07:28,600
That that's really caden's attitude in 
the story of,

2295
02:07:29,110 --> 02:07:34,110
of cain and abel.
He externalizes responsibility for the 

2296
02:07:34,110 --> 02:07:38,320
catastrophe of his life and therefore he
doesn't make the right sacrifices.

2297
02:07:38,321 --> 02:07:43,321
And so the paradoxical injunction here 
is except responsibility for the 

2298
02:07:43,321 --> 02:07:48,151
catastrophe of your life and that way 
you transcended simultaneously and 

2299
02:07:49,421 --> 02:07:54,421
there's a,
there's an unbelievably hopeful message 

2300
02:07:54,421 --> 02:07:56,910
in there.
And the message is you're actually 

2301
02:07:56,910 --> 02:07:59,041
strong enough to do that.
You just don't know it and you won't 

2302
02:07:59,041 --> 02:07:59,380
find out till you do it.
You can't find out till you do it.

2303
02:08:00,130 --> 02:08:02,350
But if you did it,
you'd find out that it was true.

2304
02:08:02,950 --> 02:08:05,200
It's a massive risk.
It's the ultimate in risks,

2305
02:08:05,201 --> 02:08:07,450
right?
You have to be willing to loSe your life

2306
02:08:07,451 --> 02:08:09,300
in order to find it.
It's like.

2307
02:08:09,850 --> 02:08:12,070
Exactly right.
So that picture,

2308
02:08:12,071 --> 02:08:13,660
when I started to understand that 
picture,

2309
02:08:13,680 --> 02:08:18,680
well,
every time I look at it just blows me 

2310
02:08:18,680 --> 02:08:18,680
away.
I can't say it's unbelievably,

2311
02:08:18,680 --> 02:08:22,330
it's an unbelievably sophisticated set 
of ideas,

2312
02:08:23,860 --> 02:08:27,220
but I don't think it's much different 
really than this idea.

2313
02:08:27,900 --> 02:08:32,900
I mean,
buddha finds his enlightenment under a 

2314
02:08:32,900 --> 02:08:34,960
tree.
It's not fluke that that's the case.

2315
02:08:34,990 --> 02:08:37,560
That's his natural environment.
and he's sitting in the lotus.

2316
02:08:37,740 --> 02:08:42,740
The lotus opens up his thing that 
springs up from the depths and he sits 

2317
02:08:42,791 --> 02:08:47,791
there illuminated the same way.
He's got a halo that's the sun that 

2318
02:08:47,791 --> 02:08:49,060
stands for higher consciousness and 
he's.

2319
02:08:49,120 --> 02:08:52,780
He's transcended by accepting the fact 
that life is suffering.

2320
02:08:53,320 --> 02:08:57,730
He's transcended the limitations that 
are part of mortality.

2321
02:09:00,170 --> 02:09:04,130
You see that symbol there,
that swastika.

2322
02:09:04,131 --> 02:09:05,570
You see it there.
It's reversed.

2323
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:06,950
The nazis reversed it.

2324
02:09:08,830 --> 02:09:13,830
Well,
think about that mean they weren't 

2325
02:09:13,830 --> 02:09:15,800
stupid symbolism there.
SYmbols had meaning is what the swastika

2326
02:09:15,830 --> 02:09:17,710
were represented was what this 
represents.

2327
02:09:18,430 --> 02:09:22,270
Reversed.
Well,

2328
02:09:22,300 --> 02:09:25,810
that's a very bad idea.
This is the thing that this,

2329
02:09:26,080 --> 02:09:28,810
this idea is what enables people to 
transcend their suffering.

2330
02:09:28,811 --> 02:09:29,580
And buddha said,
well,

2331
02:09:29,620 --> 02:09:31,960
don't,
don't be too attached to things,

2332
02:09:32,650 --> 02:09:34,720
and what does that mean?
It doesn't mean deny the world.

2333
02:09:34,721 --> 02:09:37,870
It might mean deny the world if you're 
too in love with the material,

2334
02:09:38,380 --> 02:09:41,290
like with material wellbeing,
let's say.

2335
02:09:41,470 --> 02:09:45,910
Then your pathway to transcendence and 
meaning might be to abandon that because

2336
02:09:45,911 --> 02:09:49,390
it's constraining you.
It's making you less than you could be,

2337
02:09:49,780 --> 02:09:54,780
but the fundamental lesson,
the more fundamental lesson that's 

2338
02:09:54,780 --> 02:09:58,201
underneath that is don't let what you 
are stop you from being what you could 

2339
02:09:58,201 --> 02:09:59,230
be.
Right?

2340
02:09:59,530 --> 02:10:00,670
And so then the question is,
well,

2341
02:10:00,671 --> 02:10:04,300
what do you identify with?
Do you identify with what you are?

2342
02:10:05,870 --> 02:10:08,800
Then you're a tyrant,
do you identify with,

2343
02:10:09,130 --> 02:10:11,890
with chaos,
because that's the opposite of order.

2344
02:10:11,891 --> 02:10:16,891
Say then you're nihilistic ball.
You don't identify with either of those,

2345
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:19,510
you know,
that they're both necessary,

2346
02:10:19,511 --> 02:10:21,220
you know that you have to live with both
of them,

2347
02:10:21,221 --> 02:10:26,221
but you would,
you identify with the capacity to 

2348
02:10:26,221 --> 02:10:29,440
continually transcend what you are and 
then you seek out error.

2349
02:10:30,070 --> 02:10:33,320
That's what humility is.
It's like I'm error ridden

2350
02:10:34,060 --> 02:10:35,360
psych,
so I want to see,

2351
02:10:35,540 --> 02:10:39,230
I want to put myself in a situation 
where I can discover one of my areas,

2352
02:10:39,231 --> 02:10:42,710
hopefully not in a way that's going to 
knock me completely out of the game,

2353
02:10:42,711 --> 02:10:44,250
right?
I want to,

2354
02:10:44,420 --> 02:10:47,510
I want to seek out a challenge.
I want to find out where my limits are.

2355
02:10:47,511 --> 02:10:52,511
I want to find out where there's not 
enough of me yet and I want to do it 

2356
02:10:52,511 --> 02:10:52,950
that in a way that's engaging because 
you know,

2357
02:10:53,080 --> 02:10:55,190
you can wear yourself out fighting 
dragons.

2358
02:10:55,191 --> 02:10:57,560
So obviously you can exhaust yourself 
completely.

2359
02:10:57,561 --> 02:10:59,470
And that's not helpful.
You know,

2360
02:10:59,800 --> 02:11:01,460
one of the things I learned,
for example,

2361
02:11:01,461 --> 02:11:06,461
when I was coaching,
when I was coaching lawyers who these 

2362
02:11:06,461 --> 02:11:10,180
were people who had very high end 
careers and so they had an infinite 

2363
02:11:10,180 --> 02:11:10,180
workload.
No matter how much they worked,

2364
02:11:10,180 --> 02:11:12,410
flat out there was always way more work 
that they should do.

2365
02:11:12,410 --> 02:11:17,410
It's very difficult thing to learn to 
manage and so they were exhausting 

2366
02:11:17,410 --> 02:11:18,140
themselves and I said,
well,

2367
02:11:18,190 --> 02:11:19,730
you know,
you have to work less per day.

2368
02:11:19,731 --> 02:11:20,300
It's like,
well,

2369
02:11:20,540 --> 02:11:21,890
no,
that's not happening.

2370
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:26,090
I can't do that.
And so what I learned over time was,

2371
02:11:26,091 --> 02:11:31,091
okay,
so this is what you have to do every 

2372
02:11:31,091 --> 02:11:32,891
three months.
You have to block off four days and go 

2373
02:11:32,891 --> 02:11:34,010
have a vacation and you have to plan 
that in advance so it's in your calendar

2374
02:11:34,011 --> 02:11:39,011
so that your secretary doesn't book your
time and then you need that because you 

2375
02:11:39,011 --> 02:11:43,451
have to recuperate enough so that you 
can work as hard as you're going to 

2376
02:11:43,451 --> 02:11:46,331
work.
And of course they were nervous about 

2377
02:11:46,331 --> 02:11:46,331
that and I said,
well look,

2378
02:11:46,331 --> 02:11:46,331
we can.
We can calibrate this.

2379
02:11:46,331 --> 02:11:51,220
Let's keep track of your billable hours 
over the next year and see if they 

2380
02:11:51,220 --> 02:11:52,370
increase or decrease because I bet you 
if you take more time off,

2381
02:11:52,371 --> 02:11:54,650
you'll actually have more billable 
hours.

2382
02:11:54,650 --> 02:11:56,300
You'll actually have your cake and eat 
it too.

2383
02:11:56,301 --> 02:12:01,301
You'll get to have a vacation and you'll
be more productive and that inevitably 

2384
02:12:01,311 --> 02:12:05,420
that was what happened and so that's a 
matter of calibrating the game properly,

2385
02:12:05,421 --> 02:12:10,421
right?
You want to play a game that you can 

2386
02:12:10,421 --> 02:12:10,421
play today,
but also one that you can play next week

2387
02:12:10,421 --> 02:12:11,930
and next month.
We're not tAlking about you know,

2388
02:12:11,931 --> 02:12:13,700
your,
your career this week.

2389
02:12:13,701 --> 02:12:18,701
We're talking about you having a career 
that lasts 30 years that doesn't kill 

2390
02:12:18,701 --> 02:12:22,541
you,
that doesn't make you hate yourself or 

2391
02:12:22,541 --> 02:12:22,880
the job that doesn't make you better.
That doesn't where you to a frazzle,

2392
02:12:23,150 --> 02:12:28,150
so it has to be optimized and so I think
that you can in fact decIde to take on 

2393
02:12:28,311 --> 02:12:32,030
the load that's optimally meaningful if 
you want,

2394
02:12:32,031 --> 02:12:33,800
and then you get to have your cake and 
eat it too.

2395
02:12:34,100 --> 02:12:37,190
You're on the pathway to continual 
incremental improvement.

2396
02:12:37,190 --> 02:12:42,190
You only have to burn off a feather at a
time instead of having the whole bloody 

2397
02:12:42,190 --> 02:12:43,580
thing burst into flames,
but it's a constant.

2398
02:12:43,760 --> 02:12:47,720
It's a constant source of renewal and 
there's an idea that to be renewed,

2399
02:12:47,721 --> 02:12:49,760
you have to drink the water of life,
right?

2400
02:12:50,220 --> 02:12:53,630
That that's an old mythological idea and
what's the water?

2401
02:12:53,660 --> 02:12:55,790
The water of life.
Chaos is water.

2402
02:12:55,850 --> 02:12:57,260
Water,
water is chaos.

2403
02:12:57,350 --> 02:13:01,970
Water is what washes away.
Too much order and to stay continually,

2404
02:13:02,180 --> 02:13:07,180
let's say a refreshed by the water of 
life is to take on exactly the right 

2405
02:13:07,821 --> 02:13:12,821
amount of chaos to make sure that your 
garden is properly nourished and I think

2406
02:13:13,131 --> 02:13:17,150
meaning is actually the marker of that 
and as I said,

2407
02:13:17,151 --> 02:13:22,151
you know that I'm not.
I wouldn't consider myself either naive 

2408
02:13:22,151 --> 02:13:23,330
or particularly optimistic person.
I don't think I'm either of those,

2409
02:13:23,570 --> 02:13:25,550
but this is an actually an idea.

2410
02:13:25,790 --> 02:13:30,790
This is one of the only ideas that I've 
ever found that I really believe to be 

2411
02:13:30,790 --> 02:13:32,700
rock solid.
I actually think that it's true and it's

2412
02:13:32,701 --> 02:13:37,701
very optimistic because it says you can 
use your sense of meaning to calibrate 

2413
02:13:37,701 --> 02:13:39,750
your progress through life,
but there's rules.

2414
02:13:39,751 --> 02:13:44,751
You have to aim at the highest possible 
good that you can conceive now and 

2415
02:13:44,751 --> 02:13:45,570
that's subject update because what the 
hell you know,

2416
02:13:45,571 --> 02:13:48,090
but you,
they start by aiming at the star you can

2417
02:13:48,091 --> 02:13:51,060
see rather than the dimmer one that you 
can't yet perceive,

2418
02:13:51,600 --> 02:13:53,940
and then you decide that you're going to
do that honestly.

2419
02:13:53,970 --> 02:13:54,870
Right?
There's that.

2420
02:13:54,910 --> 02:13:59,910
That's a big decision.
So the first decision I think in some 

2421
02:13:59,910 --> 02:14:03,321
sense is a decision of love.
You're going to decide that being is 

2422
02:14:03,321 --> 02:14:05,670
worthwhile and that you're going to work
for its betterment and that's a decision

2423
02:14:05,671 --> 02:14:10,671
that's based on law,
but in the second decision is based on 

2424
02:14:10,671 --> 02:14:10,671
truth.

2425
02:14:10,671 --> 02:14:11,580
Having made that decision,
you're going to play a straight game.

2426
02:14:11,820 --> 02:14:14,730
Having made those two decisions,
I think that you can allow your sense of

2427
02:14:14,731 --> 02:14:19,731
meaning to calibrate your pathway.
And then what's so interesting is that 

2428
02:14:19,731 --> 02:14:23,361
you hit a state that's as close to 
paradise as you're going to hit right 

2429
02:14:23,361 --> 02:14:27,951
away because being engaged like that,
it's better to be engaged in the 

2430
02:14:27,951 --> 02:14:30,930
solution of a complex problem that not 
to have a problem at all.

2431
02:14:31,980 --> 02:14:36,980
And that's,
that's no different than saying it's 

2432
02:14:36,980 --> 02:14:38,880
better for there to be being the non 
being because being is a problem.

2433
02:14:40,140 --> 02:14:43,560
and so if you want to have no problems,
then you have no being.

2434
02:14:43,600 --> 02:14:44,970
And,
and you could say,

2435
02:14:44,971 --> 02:14:47,100
well,
being so miserable that maybe that's the

2436
02:14:47,101 --> 02:14:50,250
route we should take and fair enough,
but maybe you can have your cake and eat

2437
02:14:50,251 --> 02:14:52,380
it too.
You can have the damn problem,

2438
02:14:53,070 --> 02:14:54,810
it can be a problem we're solving.

2439
02:14:54,930 --> 02:14:59,930
And you can be so engaged in solving the
problem that it justifies the fact that 

2440
02:14:59,930 --> 02:15:01,080
the problem exists.
And then you get,

2441
02:15:01,140 --> 02:15:06,140
then you get to have,
you get to have the problem and the 

2442
02:15:06,140 --> 02:15:09,561
solution at the same time.
And maybe That's better than not having 

2443
02:15:09,561 --> 02:15:12,111
the problem at all.
And I believe that because one of the 

2444
02:15:12,111 --> 02:15:12,111
things I have seen,
and I've seen this so interesting,

2445
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:15,900
so interesting when I've been lecturing 
to people especially more recently,

2446
02:15:15,950 --> 02:15:18,900
and this is also manifested itself on 
cell phone,

2447
02:15:18,901 --> 02:15:23,901
youtube,
I'm talking to people a lot about 

2448
02:15:23,901 --> 02:15:27,081
responsibility and it's young men in 
particular that seemed to be responding 

2449
02:15:27,081 --> 02:15:28,200
to that and I think that's partly 
because I think that young women in some

2450
02:15:28,201 --> 02:15:31,860
sense have their responsibility map 
already laid out for them.

2451
02:15:32,310 --> 02:15:37,310
It's also less voluntary in some sense 
for women because they have more 

2452
02:15:37,310 --> 02:15:38,220
complicated problems to solve in the 
first part of their life,

2453
02:15:38,250 --> 02:15:40,020
right?
Take because they have to get the family

2454
02:15:40,260 --> 02:15:41,700
problem solved.
But whatever.

2455
02:15:42,240 --> 02:15:47,240
I've been talking very in a very 
delineated matter about responsibility,

2456
02:15:48,330 --> 02:15:50,070
whIch is a strange thing to sell to 
people,

2457
02:15:50,071 --> 02:15:52,770
but responsibility is what gives your 
life meaning.

2458
02:15:53,220 --> 02:15:58,220
And so then you might say,
well then take on ultimate 

2459
02:15:58,220 --> 02:16:00,711
responsibility and what happens?
You have an ultimately meaningful life 

2460
02:16:00,711 --> 02:16:00,711
and then you might say,
well,

2461
02:16:00,711 --> 02:16:03,270
if your life is ultimately meaningful,
it doesn't matter if it's

2462
02:16:04,230 --> 02:16:07,200
punctuated by tragedy or even predicated
on tragedy.

2463
02:16:07,590 --> 02:16:12,360
It's worth it.
and I think that's true,

2464
02:16:12,420 --> 02:16:15,180
and everything I've seen indicates to me
that's true.

2465
02:16:15,181 --> 02:16:18,660
Every time I get my clients to take on 
more responsibility.

2466
02:16:18,940 --> 02:16:20,790
You know what?
And it isn't an injunction.

2467
02:16:20,791 --> 02:16:23,010
You're a bad person.
You should take on responsibility.

2468
02:16:23,130 --> 02:16:26,310
It has nothing to do with that.
You can defIne the damn responsibility.

2469
02:16:26,460 --> 02:16:29,080
It isn't something that someone else 
should impose on you.

2470
02:16:29,081 --> 02:16:30,040
It's not a matter of doing

2471
02:16:30,040 --> 02:16:32,410
what you should do in some abstract 
manner.

2472
02:16:32,680 --> 02:16:37,680
It's not that it's the choice of what 
game you're going to play and you know 

2473
02:16:38,291 --> 02:16:40,270
you can play the game of the seeker,
I would say.

2474
02:16:40,271 --> 02:16:45,271
And if you play that game,
then everyone wins and it's the best 

2475
02:16:45,271 --> 02:16:45,770
game you can play.
And so the,

2476
02:16:45,870 --> 02:16:50,870
the,
the answer in some sense to the tragedy 

2477
02:16:50,870 --> 02:16:53,611
of life,
to the catastrophe of life to the fall 

2478
02:16:53,611 --> 02:16:56,940
is to adopt the responsibility of 
mortality that goes along with that and 

2479
02:16:57,071 --> 02:17:00,700
to play that game maximally.
And paradoxically,

2480
02:17:00,760 --> 02:17:03,670
it's in willingness to do that,
that the solution emerges.

2481
02:17:04,180 --> 02:17:09,180
And I don't know.
I have done my best with every single 

2482
02:17:09,180 --> 02:17:12,571
thing I've talked to you guys about.
I have done my best to do what 

2483
02:17:12,571 --> 02:17:14,170
dostoyevsky he does in his novels,
which is I make a proposition and then I

2484
02:17:14,171 --> 02:17:19,171
spend months or years trying to figure 
out if I can take the bloody thing 

2485
02:17:19,171 --> 02:17:23,971
apart,
if there's something wrong with it 

2486
02:17:23,971 --> 02:17:26,010
because I want to fInd out,
I want to hit it with a hammer and 

2487
02:17:26,010 --> 02:17:28,561
seeing if it breaks.
And what I've been trying to do is to 

2488
02:17:28,561 --> 02:17:29,080
tell you all the things that I've 
gathered,

2489
02:17:29,081 --> 02:17:29,770
let's say,
or,

2490
02:17:29,800 --> 02:17:34,800
or laid out or articulated or discovered
over the last 30 years that I have not 

2491
02:17:34,800 --> 02:17:37,510
been able to break with the biggest 
hammer that I could take to them.

2492
02:17:38,290 --> 02:17:41,920
And I guess that's the fundamental one,
is that I believe that the,

2493
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:43,550
the,
um,

2494
02:17:44,290 --> 02:17:47,080
the idea that lurks in these images

2495
02:17:49,180 --> 02:17:54,180
derived from very different cultures.
It's the same idea.

2496
02:17:57,120 --> 02:17:59,910
Life is suffering,
right?

2497
02:18:00,390 --> 02:18:04,680
Indisputable.
What do you do about that?

2498
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:12,280
You voluntarily accepted and then strive
to overcome the suffering.

2499
02:18:13,201 --> 02:18:18,201
That's a consequence of that.
And you do that for you and you do that 

2500
02:18:18,201 --> 02:18:19,500
in a Way that makes It better for other 
people.

2501
02:18:19,740 --> 02:18:23,250
And then that works.
And one question might be,

2502
02:18:23,251 --> 02:18:24,450
well,
how well does it work?

2503
02:18:24,750 --> 02:18:28,830
And the answer is have.
The only way that you can find out is by

2504
02:18:28,831 --> 02:18:31,140
trying it.
That's it.

2505
02:18:31,230 --> 02:18:36,230
That's the existential element of it.
The proof is to be derived by the 

2506
02:18:36,230 --> 02:18:37,380
incarnation of the attitude in your own 
life.

2507
02:18:37,680 --> 02:18:41,040
no one can tell you how it will work for
you.

2508
02:18:41,370 --> 02:18:46,370
It's the thing that your destiny is to 
discover that and you have to make.

2509
02:18:47,490 --> 02:18:49,260
You have to make the decisions to begin 
with.

2510
02:18:49,290 --> 02:18:52,140
It's like because you can't do this 
without commitment,

2511
02:18:52,170 --> 02:18:57,170
you have to commit to it first.
That's the act of faith that that 

2512
02:18:57,170 --> 02:18:58,320
character guard was so insistent upon.

2513
02:18:59,010 --> 02:19:01,800
You have to say,
I'm going to act as if being as good,

2514
02:19:01,801 --> 02:19:04,830
I'm going to act as if truth is the 
pathway to enlightenment.

2515
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:08,880
I'm going to act as if I should pursue 
the deepest meaning possible in my life.

2516
02:19:09,360 --> 02:19:11,880
And there's there's reasons to do none 
of those.

2517
02:19:12,580 --> 02:19:15,720
There are real reasons,
so it's really a decision,

2518
02:19:16,320 --> 02:19:21,320
but you cannot find out what the 
consequences of the decision is unless 

2519
02:19:21,320 --> 02:19:24,381
you make the decision.
I think the same thing happens when you 

2520
02:19:24,381 --> 02:19:25,740
get married by the way,
so if you think you might leave,

2521
02:19:25,800 --> 02:19:28,550
you're not married and then you think,
well,

2522
02:19:28,551 --> 02:19:29,840
the marriage didn't succeed.
It's like,

2523
02:19:29,841 --> 02:19:31,940
well,
maybe you were never married because the

2524
02:19:31,941 --> 02:19:36,020
rule is you don't get to leave and 
there's a reason for that rule.

2525
02:19:36,320 --> 02:19:41,320
Now I'm not saying that there aren't 
situations where there should be 

2526
02:19:41,320 --> 02:19:41,320
exceptions made for that.
That's not the point.

2527
02:19:41,870 --> 02:19:44,900
The point is that there's some games you
don't get to play unless you're all in,

2528
02:19:46,330 --> 02:19:51,330
and the other thing that's so 
interesting about being alive is that 

2529
02:19:51,330 --> 02:19:51,330
you're all in.

2530
02:19:52,400 --> 02:19:54,440
No matter what you do,
you're all in.

2531
02:19:54,680 --> 02:19:59,680
this is going to kill you,
so I think you might as well play the 

2532
02:19:59,680 --> 02:20:03,881
most magnificent game you can while 
you're waiting because do you have 

2533
02:20:04,401 --> 02:20:06,410
anything better to do?
Really,

2534
02:20:07,400 --> 02:20:10,370
why not pick the best thing possible 
that you could do?

2535
02:20:11,660 --> 02:20:16,660
Why not do that?
Maybe you could justify you're wretched 

2536
02:20:16,660 --> 02:20:16,850
existence to yourself that way I think 
you could.

2537
02:20:17,300 --> 02:20:19,310
That's what it looks like.
You know,

2538
02:20:19,311 --> 02:20:22,260
people find such meaning in the 
responsibilities they adopt.

2539
02:20:22,261 --> 02:20:25,490
It stops making them ask questions about
what life is for.

2540
02:20:25,491 --> 02:20:27,410
If you have a newborn child,
for example,

2541
02:20:28,520 --> 02:20:33,520
like unless you're really in a bad way,
psychotically depressed or or maybe your

2542
02:20:33,531 --> 02:20:37,340
personality really needs some retooling,
you stop thinking about

2543
02:20:39,210 --> 02:20:44,210
anything but ensuring that that baby is 
doing well and if someone comes along 

2544
02:20:44,671 --> 02:20:48,090
and asks you an existential question 
about your commitment to that,

2545
02:20:48,390 --> 02:20:52,290
the right response is why are you asking
me such stupid questions when,

2546
02:20:52,380 --> 02:20:53,990
when the,
when this,

2547
02:20:54,050 --> 02:20:56,670
this is manifesting itself right in 
front of your eyes,

2548
02:20:56,700 --> 02:20:59,130
like how blind can you be?
That isn't a time for,

2549
02:20:59,460 --> 02:21:04,460
for questions about the meaning of life.
The answer is right in front of you and 

2550
02:21:04,460 --> 02:21:06,450
if you can't see it,
it's not because life has no meaning.

2551
02:21:06,451 --> 02:21:10,000
It's because you're blind.
I mean that's what they image of,

2552
02:21:10,150 --> 02:21:15,150
of,
of the virgin mother and the child is 

2553
02:21:15,150 --> 02:21:15,150
all about.
It's like,

2554
02:21:15,150 --> 02:21:15,900
what's the answer to the meaning of 
life?

2555
02:21:16,770 --> 02:21:18,420
Here's an answer.
IT's like,

2556
02:21:18,421 --> 02:21:19,680
well,
I'm going to criticize that.

2557
02:21:19,710 --> 02:21:21,330
Well,
go right ahead.

2558
02:21:21,960 --> 02:21:22,650
You know,
it's like,

2559
02:21:22,680 --> 02:21:23,790
it's like what?
What?

2560
02:21:23,850 --> 02:21:24,680
You're.
You're like a.

2561
02:21:24,730 --> 02:21:26,640
You're like a,
what do you call that?

2562
02:21:26,730 --> 02:21:29,370
A termite.
KnowIng on a temple,

2563
02:21:30,300 --> 02:21:35,300
there's no,
there's no utility and that sort of 

2564
02:21:35,300 --> 02:21:35,300
criticism.
You're,

2565
02:21:35,950 --> 02:21:40,560
it's blindness and it's the same thing 
with regards to the path of the hero.

2566
02:21:40,561 --> 02:21:44,310
It's like it glistens in front of you 
and you can criticize it.

2567
02:21:44,340 --> 02:21:44,700
It's like

2568
02:21:46,900 --> 02:21:47,320
fine.

2569
02:21:48,260 --> 02:21:51,440
Put the cart before the horse and see 
how far you get.

2570
02:21:54,840 --> 02:21:58,080
So I thought to bring full closure to 
the class,

2571
02:21:58,410 --> 02:22:03,410
I was trying to solve this terrible 
puzzle that confronted me for and many 

2572
02:22:04,621 --> 02:22:09,621
other people about how it was that human
beings got themselves in such a tangle 

2573
02:22:09,871 --> 02:22:14,871
about what they believed,
such a tangle that we were pointing the 

2574
02:22:14,871 --> 02:22:16,230
ultimate weapons of destruction at one 
another,

2575
02:22:16,260 --> 02:22:17,910
which by the way,
we are still doing.

2576
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:21,660
I thought,
okay,

2577
02:22:21,661 --> 02:22:24,000
well I understand that we need to are 
belief systems.

2578
02:22:24,001 --> 02:22:29,001
They orient us and that means there will
be conflict between belief systems and 

2579
02:22:29,011 --> 02:22:31,980
that can be a catastrophe and that's 
being played out everywhere.

2580
02:22:31,981 --> 02:22:33,390
Again,
in very many ways.

2581
02:22:34,620 --> 02:22:36,240
What's the solution to that?
Well,

2582
02:22:36,870 --> 02:22:41,520
one possibility is there's no solution.
It's just mayhem all the way around.

2583
02:22:41,670 --> 02:22:46,670
Could be the case,
but it seemed to me as I delved into it 

2584
02:22:46,670 --> 02:22:50,630
that the proper solution to that was to 
live properly as an individual because 

2585
02:22:50,941 --> 02:22:54,600
you're more powerful than you think way 
more powerful than you think.

2586
02:22:54,630 --> 02:22:57,450
I mean god only knows what you are in 
the final analysis.

2587
02:22:58,470 --> 02:23:03,470
You're blind to your own weaknesses,
but you're also blind to your own 

2588
02:23:03,470 --> 02:23:04,170
strengths and so then I think,
well,

2589
02:23:04,230 --> 02:23:07,350
if you've got your act together and be 
better for you and instantly it would be

2590
02:23:07,351 --> 02:23:09,990
better for your family.
Assuming they wanted you to get your act

2591
02:23:09,991 --> 02:23:11,610
together and not everyone does,
but.

2592
02:23:12,330 --> 02:23:14,130
And then it would be better for the 
community.

2593
02:23:14,280 --> 02:23:19,280
It's like how far could you take that if
you stopped wasting time and if you 

2594
02:23:19,280 --> 02:23:22,521
start lying and if you oriented yourself
to the highest possible good that you 

2595
02:23:22,521 --> 02:23:23,430
could conceive of it and you committed 
to that,

2596
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,910
how much good could you do?
Well,

2597
02:23:26,911 --> 02:23:28,800
I would say,
why don't you find out?

2598
02:23:33,060 --> 02:23:38,060
So that's what I think you should do.
You should find out you don't have 

2599
02:23:38,060 --> 02:23:39,360
anything better to do and there's 
nothing in it.

2600
02:23:39,420 --> 02:23:43,140
As far as I've been able to tell,
there's nothing in it but good,

2601
02:23:45,410 --> 02:23:45,950
so

2602
02:23:47,350 --> 02:23:52,350
maybe you could sort yourself out so 
that you wanted nothing but the good and

2603
02:23:53,100 --> 02:23:58,100
and then maybe you could help make that 
manifest in the world and maybe we 

2604
02:23:58,100 --> 02:23:59,350
wouldn't have all these terrible 
problems.

2605
02:23:59,380 --> 02:24:02,830
Then at least we'd have fewer of them 
and that would be a start.

2606
02:24:03,310 --> 02:24:08,310
So it's the.
It's the answer to the problem of 

2607
02:24:08,310 --> 02:24:13,291
humanity is the is the is the integrity 
of the individual.

2608
02:24:14,620 --> 02:24:19,620
That's the answer.
So and states that are predicated on 

2609
02:24:19,721 --> 02:24:24,400
that realization are healthy,
so in states that aren't,

2610
02:24:25,090 --> 02:24:30,090
are doomed to stagnation and 
catastrophic collapse and personalities 

2611
02:24:31,301 --> 02:24:36,301
that are predicated on self tyranny and 
the tyranny of others are doomed and 

2612
02:24:39,240 --> 02:24:43,600
them to collapse.
So and then you think,

2613
02:24:43,601 --> 02:24:44,500
well,
what's the barrier?

2614
02:24:44,501 --> 02:24:49,501
The barriers are you willing to accept 
the responsibility and part of the 

2615
02:24:49,501 --> 02:24:52,630
answer to that is reduced the damn 
responsibility until it's tolerable.

2616
02:24:53,140 --> 02:24:54,820
You don't have to have to fix everything
at once.

2617
02:24:55,150 --> 02:25:00,150
You could just start by fixing the 
things that you could fix or you could 

2618
02:25:00,150 --> 02:25:04,081
even do it more.
You can do it with even less self 

2619
02:25:04,931 --> 02:25:09,931
sacrifice.
you could start by fixing only the 

2620
02:25:09,931 --> 02:25:09,931
things that you want to fix.
God,

2621
02:25:09,931 --> 02:25:12,940
you can get a massive way that way,
so do it.

2622
02:25:13,180 --> 02:25:18,180
See what happens.
That's what you should have been taught 

2623
02:25:18,180 --> 02:25:20,821
in university right from the beginning.
It's like aim at the highest good tool 

2624
02:25:20,821 --> 02:25:25,081
yourself into something that can attain 
it and go out and manifested in the 

2625
02:25:25,081 --> 02:25:27,490
world and everything.
that everything that comes your way will

2626
02:25:27,491 --> 02:25:27,850
be

2627
02:25:30,870 --> 02:25:33,720
everything that comes your way will be a
blessing and so,

2628
02:25:36,190 --> 02:25:41,190
oh,
you have to do is give up your 

2629
02:25:41,190 --> 02:25:42,241
resentment and your hatred.
I know that's a hard thing to give up 

2630
02:25:42,241 --> 02:25:46,290
because he had plenty of reason for it.
That's probably a good place to stop,

2631
02:25:48,460 --> 02:25:49,490
so it's a pleasure.

2632
02:25:50,530 --> 02:25:54,060
Thank you.
