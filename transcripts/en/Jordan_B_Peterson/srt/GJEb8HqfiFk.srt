1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,290
The good news is that there was some
overlap.

2
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:06,420
So I think that despite all the cue
cards on here,

3
00:00:06,421 --> 00:00:07,910
we will be able to,
um,

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:13,170
answer quite the cross section a.
So in some cases they've been split up

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,680
between Dr Pearson and Dr Doidge.
Uh,

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,170
in other cases it's just a generally
speaking.

7
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:21,350
So Dr Peterson,
I think,

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,870
nice way to conclude your remarks.
Um,

9
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:29,560
why are the postmodernists doing this
and to what end?

10
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,510
Well,
I think you should distinguish between

11
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:49,230
the postmodernists and postmodernism and
in some sense,

12
00:00:49,231 --> 00:00:51,780
because you don't want to be thinking
that,

13
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,650
you know,
each radical person on the left,

14
00:00:55,651 --> 00:01:00,651
let's say for the time being is a full
fledged Avatar of postmodernism because

15
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:02,430
they're not,
they're like,

16
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:03,443
you know,

17
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,860
60 percent reasonable human being and 40
percent puppet mouthpiece of a toxic

18
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:11,850
etiology,
you know,

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,910
and so it's fragmented across people and
that makes it,

20
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:17,940
of course much more complicated because
you get to know someone like that and

21
00:01:17,941 --> 00:01:18,751
you think,
well,

22
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:21,960
they've got some good intentions.
Not nearly as many as they think they

23
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:24,300
have,
but they have some good intentions and

24
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:27,240
you know,
they have a history of really things not

25
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:30,450
so good that happened to them.
It's no wonder they feel kind of angry

26
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:31,284
about it,
so like,

27
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,980
but then that's why you got to get to
the bottom of things.

28
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:37,500
It's like,
and the bottom is very far down.

29
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:42,501
It's like
this is where things get crazy.

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,433
It's like,

31
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,560
well,
there's a battle between two ways of

32
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:49,940
being in life,
you know,

33
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:54,290
and I've taken that apart to some degree
in my lectures on Cain and Abel and one

34
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:59,090
way of life is to make the sacrifices
that you have to and to try to aim

35
00:01:59,091 --> 00:02:03,050
towards the good and hope that the
sacrifices that you make please the

36
00:02:03,051 --> 00:02:04,700
Lord,
so to speak.

37
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:06,380
It's how you bargain with the future,
right?

38
00:02:06,381 --> 00:02:10,880
You make sacrifices in the present
toward something you hope will be good

39
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:14,970
in the future and you hope that pleases
the reality and it's smiles on,

40
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,570
you know,
and then,

41
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,950
and then the other way of being is that
you noticed that your hard work is often

42
00:02:21,951 --> 00:02:24,110
ignored and that you don't get what you
want.

43
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:27,710
Well less deserving.
People do and it turns you against life

44
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:30,200
itself.
Like it turns you against more.

45
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:30,890
Worse than that.

46
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,980
It turns you against being.
I don't know how else to put it.

47
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:35,710
I mean because I've studied,
you know,

48
00:02:35,711 --> 00:02:39,170
like why do you go into Connecticut into
a classroom and shoot a bunch of

49
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:43,580
elementary school kids and Ben Yourself?
I think he shot himself,

50
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:46,550
but it doesn't matter because usually
that's what happens.

51
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,790
It's like what stared of state of mind
do you have to be in to do that?

52
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,440
Well,
I knew what sort of state of mind you

53
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:54,560
have to be in to do that,
but the only way to describe it,

54
00:02:54,561 --> 00:02:58,310
it's sold down there that,
you know,

55
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:01,000
it gets fundamentally.
It's like,

56
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,440
well that's the pathway of cane.
It's like being as something that should

57
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:10,060
not be despise every bit of it.
I'm going to take my revenge on it.

58
00:03:10,061 --> 00:03:13,240
I'm going to find the most innocent
people I possibly can and make them

59
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:16,270
suffer and then I'm going to do away
with myself.

60
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,990
And that shows you exactly what I think
and you know,

61
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,930
people are like that man.
That's why that's the oldest story,

62
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,110
but it's basically the oldest story we
have about human beings,

63
00:03:26,111 --> 00:03:29,500
Cain and Abel.
It's like a paragraph long that story

64
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:33,520
and it's just a punch man.
That's why I remembered it for God only

65
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:38,521
knows 10,000 years maybe.
So why are they doing it?

66
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,150
Well,
they aren't doing it.

67
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:43,690
It's like we're doing it.
That's the thing.

68
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,980
It's not them.
It just happens to be that there are

69
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:52,180
sort of more doing it now than you know,
maybe the radical right is,

70
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:54,070
you know,
but it could easily be flipped around

71
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:57,250
and well that brings me back to the same
issue.

72
00:03:57,251 --> 00:03:57,791
It's like,
well,

73
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,350
what do you do about it?
It's like,

74
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,040
join the group,
engage in group conflict,

75
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,300
give up all your beliefs so that you
don't believe anything so that you don't

76
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,150
engage in group conflict.
Well then you're nihilistic and

77
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:14,650
hopeless.
It's like,

78
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:16,960
so what do you do?
Those are your choices.

79
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:17,351
Well,
no,

80
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:20,980
they're not.
The other choice is get yourself

81
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:24,970
together and every way like you want to
fight this,

82
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:27,670
whatever this is,
you want to fight it.

83
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,500
Well,
you got to be strong because you're

84
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:32,350
going to have to make the right
decisions at a moment's notice when,

85
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,100
when the tiny little bits of this
manifest itself in your own life,

86
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:40,060
it's like you're going to stand up at
work when they want to retool your

87
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:42,910
unconscious biases.
Well,

88
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:45,910
probably not because people don't.
Well,

89
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:46,930
why not?
Well,

90
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:48,400
it's no bloody wonder,
you know?

91
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:50,680
I mean,
look what happens,

92
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,521
you know?
I said,

93
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:52,960
no,
I'm not using those words.

94
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:56,730
It's like,
you know,

95
00:04:56,731 --> 00:05:00,150
when I didn't do it blindly all the way,
certainly never predicted what was

96
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,740
going,
who the hell could have predicted what

97
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:03,750
was going to happen?
Like certainly not me,

98
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:07,210
but it's no wonder that people shut up
and you know,

99
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,650
hide like why not?
It's the smart thing to do in the short

100
00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:14,040
term.
Well you know how you feel when you

101
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:17,250
hide,
you know you feel like a pathetic,

102
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:22,251
scared rabbit and that's what you are.
So you gotta be more than a pathetic,

103
00:05:23,101 --> 00:05:25,590
scared rabbit and you do that by

104
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,430
you do that by facing the chaos that
exists in your own life and turning it

105
00:05:35,431 --> 00:05:37,860
into order not stopped.
That's how it goes.

106
00:05:37,861 --> 00:05:40,350
So it isn't them,
you know,

107
00:05:40,351 --> 00:05:42,420
that's the problem.
It would be so easy.

108
00:05:42,421 --> 00:05:46,830
You could just get rid of them.
It's like that's just doesn't work.

109
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,650
Dr Doidge have our young people have
been forced to overdevelop their left

110
00:05:54,651 --> 00:05:58,460
brains or have their right side of the
been underdeveloped.

111
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,380
If so,
how do we avoid this?

112
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,313
No.

113
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,480
Is this better?
I'm going to defer to or bring you back

114
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:26,210
to Ian mcgilchrist book,
and so yeah,

115
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:29,120
the brain is plastic and arguably,
you know,

116
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:34,870
if you start using a suite of cognitive
skills over and over and they were more

117
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:38,500
left brain,
you could develop more left brained.

118
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,860
I'm a balance that was more left brained
or right brained.

119
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,600
And in the course of civilization,
according to Mcgilchrist,

120
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,960
there were certain times where they hit
the sweet spot and he goes,

121
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:58,350
he has a whole historical account in his
book of which times and civilization,

122
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,860
you know,
actually Athens,

123
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:04,010
500 BC,
all those incredible playwrights,

124
00:07:04,011 --> 00:07:04,890
Euripidean,
[inaudible],

125
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,800
these plays like Medea and east Gillis
and sophocles.

126
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:11,600
It go deep,
deep into emotion in the unconscious.

127
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,880
That's,
that's being hit.

128
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,780
And that then you have aristotle
describing logic really for the first

129
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:19,550
time.
And then there are moments in the

130
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,470
renaissance where there's a nice
balance,

131
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:26,330
but mcgilchrist himself is very
concerned as am I.

132
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:31,700
That education has really taken a huge
turn to left brain function.

133
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,540
Um,
and I think part of that has to do with,

134
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:36,860
uh,
well,

135
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,800
part of it has to do with a
philosophical problem and that is modern

136
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:43,040
science is I think in general a very
good thing.

137
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:47,660
It's not a perfect thing and it has a
number of very materialist assumptions

138
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,730
and many,
many people

139
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,830
misunderstand the following thing.
I see this in medicine all the time.

140
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,581
They say,
well,

141
00:07:55,581 --> 00:07:57,510
what are your statistics for that?
You know,

142
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,030
statistics are a means to an end.
We're trying to find out what works for

143
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:05,840
a particular illness or something.
If you can measure it in the current

144
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,450
mindset of modern science,
it is real.

145
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,160
But there are things of course,
that we were not good at measuring now

146
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,520
with computers and technology,
what's Ha and bureaucracy,

147
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:21,200
what we're seeing in society is certain
things are easier to measure and those

148
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:23,240
are the things that are taught that are
privileged.

149
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,780
Your job is often judged and you know,
for many,

150
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:31,070
many people buy these silly little
things that are easy to quantify.

151
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:36,310
And that pushes things more towards a
kind of left brain approach if combined

152
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:40,790
with some of the materialist
underpinnings of modern science and

153
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,520
certain aspects of philosophy.
Um,

154
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:48,500
now there's always a kind of a rebellion
against that and a lot of the interest

155
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:50,950
in aspects of the east or meditation
and,

156
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,950
and,
and certain aspects of literature are

157
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:54,770
in,
you know,

158
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:59,310
in some ways,
often more right brained things.

159
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,060
And because if you live a totally left
brained approach,

160
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:05,520
and I realize I'm speaking with a vast
generalization here,

161
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,330
but it doesn't really become toxic and
it feels like your soul,

162
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:10,980
your psyche,
whatever you want to call it,

163
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:13,110
it's very much left out of it.
So,

164
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,380
to answer the question now with that
background,

165
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:19,080
uh,
I think that education is moving very,

166
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:20,520
very left brained.

167
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,480
Um,
and I mean,

168
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,240
I think it's a real problem.
I think that the skills that we're

169
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,280
working on are very,
very left brained.

170
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,900
And so the reason you want to have a
liberal education,

171
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,080
for instance,
uh,

172
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,070
we talked about mill and the role of
free people have to learn how to govern

173
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:42,990
themselves.
But you know,

174
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:47,880
there are
western books that really do hit that

175
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:52,140
balance very beautifully and those are
the things that are being dismissed from

176
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,240
the curriculum,
uh,

177
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:57,510
so often.
And it comes both from the left and from

178
00:09:57,511 --> 00:09:58,344
the right.
I mean,

179
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,120
you know,
over and over,

180
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,280
you know,
people go after things like music for

181
00:10:02,281 --> 00:10:04,020
instance.
That's one of the first things to be

182
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:08,160
taken out of the curriculum because what
does it deliver that's an immediately

183
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:12,000
helpful and so on or reading poetry and
things like that.

184
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:14,550
Those things get cut back.
So yeah,

185
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,470
I,
I have,

186
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,040
um,
I think that there,

187
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,330
there is,
the balance is not right now

188
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:26,360
I have a bit of a comment on that 1
million units and keeping with Norman's

189
00:10:26,361 --> 00:10:31,361
reference to John Piaget mean one of the
things piaget pointed out was that the

190
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,250
precursor to moral behavior is the
ability to play with others,

191
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,950
to play.
Like technically,

192
00:10:39,951 --> 00:10:44,090
I mean children set up a little fantasy
world and then they take their roles in

193
00:10:44,091 --> 00:10:47,090
it and they play and they do that
voluntarily unless one of the kids

194
00:10:47,091 --> 00:10:49,150
doesn't know how to play.
Right.

195
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,440
And so the kid that doesn't know how to
play says,

196
00:10:51,441 --> 00:10:56,270
you better play my game or I will play
with you in any sensible kid,

197
00:10:56,271 --> 00:10:58,490
just runs off and finds another play
partner.

198
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,990
But you know,
we don't let this is such a cliche.

199
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,930
We don't let her children play,
you know,

200
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:09,650
and that's a big problem because they
just learn how to play in a structured

201
00:11:09,651 --> 00:11:13,790
environment that's not play because it's
a play is when you have to invent your

202
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:18,530
own game and invent your own rules and
negotiate the rules and know.

203
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:22,700
And so all these kids is that,
I think they're hyper protected because

204
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,940
they're born to older mothers and you
know,

205
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,610
there's hardly any of them.
And so the mother's heart over

206
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,280
protective than the sword,
the fathers for that matter,

207
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,280
but they're old and they're not going to
have another kid.

208
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:37,040
So they hyper value the child and
there's only one of them.

209
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,870
And so they don't have siblings and
like,

210
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,320
and then they structure everything.
So the kid has the best of everything,

211
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,080
which they do,
except they don't have any freedom to be

212
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:46,900
idiot children and to,
you know,

213
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,710
eat dirt and fall on their head and all
that sort of thing that you have to do.

214
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,760
And you know,
it's no wonder of the reason it's a

215
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:56,170
demographic issue,
you know,

216
00:11:56,171 --> 00:11:59,080
it's no wonder it's happening.
But a lot of these kids that are

217
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,880
screaming and squawking about you better
play my game or else they just don't

218
00:12:03,881 --> 00:12:04,800
know how to play.
They,

219
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,030
they really don't.
And so it's no wonder.

220
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,930
And
that's death to morality because it's

221
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,800
predicated on free play know.
So that's a problem.

222
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:20,070
And so
that's not something I knew what to do

223
00:12:20,071 --> 00:12:20,960
about,
don't,

224
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:21,920
you know,
you know,

225
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:22,853
don't,
don't,

226
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,793
don't

227
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,910
you try to encourage your kids.
Sorry,

228
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,180
you try to encourage your kids,
you make them courageous,

229
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:33,340
you don't protect them.
That's different,

230
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,230
right?
You make them courageous,

231
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,510
you don't protect them.
So that's,

232
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,880
you just make them weak then.

233
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,693
Sure.

234
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,590
A lot of questions about,
uh,

235
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,810
human rights tribunals and human rights
councils.

236
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:49,130
So just to kind of summarize a bunch of
them into one.

237
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,920
Um,
is there ever a legitimate use for human

238
00:12:51,921 --> 00:12:54,980
rights tribunal or counsel,
and if you could comment also,

239
00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:00,250
I'm going forward in the fight over
gender expression,

240
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,850
gender identity,
um,

241
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,420
how do people combat or,
or,

242
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:07,520
or,
or win that fight in front of human

243
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:12,521
rights courts and tribunals and um,
yeah,

244
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,890
we'll leave it at that.
Oh no,

245
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,480
there is no excuse for them.
That's why they're called social justice

246
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:24,450
tribunals in Ontario like that.
That's what they're called.

247
00:13:24,451 --> 00:13:26,700
And so look it up yourself and that's
what they are.

248
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,880
So we had a court system that works
perfectly well,

249
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:33,270
which doesn't mean it worked very well,
but it means it works better than any

250
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,640
alternative.
And if anyone has ever be able to think

251
00:13:35,641 --> 00:13:40,180
up and a human rights tribunal can
suspend nor normal jurisprudential

252
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,360
standards.
They use preponderance of evidence.

253
00:13:42,361 --> 00:13:47,070
They don't assume individual innocence
and they can change the rules as they

254
00:13:47,071 --> 00:13:49,470
see fit.
And so those bloody things are

255
00:13:49,471 --> 00:13:53,610
pathological to the core and their,
their mouthpieces of the postmodernist

256
00:13:53,611 --> 00:13:56,910
neo Marxists as far as I'm concerned.
And they're setting up a parallel law

257
00:13:56,911 --> 00:13:58,770
system and they're also doing that.

258
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,130
They're also,
and this is,

259
00:14:05,131 --> 00:14:09,000
this is the wind government,
they're also forcing the universities to

260
00:14:09,001 --> 00:14:13,350
adopt particular deficiencies of sexual
harassment that make every,

261
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,140
uh,
let's call it complicated interchange

262
00:14:16,141 --> 00:14:20,130
between human beings into a act of
violence.

263
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,490
Not that I'm trying to justify stupidity
or oppression,

264
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:27,390
but we're all stupid and we're all
oppressors and so the probability that

265
00:14:27,391 --> 00:14:29,810
we'll make some sort of dopey sexual
errors,

266
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,360
100 percent and now that's become
grounds for,

267
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,630
you know,
accusations of rape and where they're

268
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,850
forcing the universities and the
colleges to become parallel legal

269
00:14:38,851 --> 00:14:41,850
systems as well.
And that's already well advanced.

270
00:14:41,851 --> 00:14:45,330
It's already being adopted at the UFT.
It's as a consequence of direct

271
00:14:45,331 --> 00:14:50,220
legislation and you better look out
because even if the people who are

272
00:14:50,221 --> 00:14:54,290
running those right now are reasonable,
which they're not,

273
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:58,700
they will absolutely be replaced by
people who exactly want that kind of

274
00:14:58,701 --> 00:15:02,870
power and will absolutely use it.
So no,

275
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,200
those things should be abolished.
We have a legal system.

276
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,163
No,

277
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,460
the law society now,
I may not have this exactly right,

278
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:16,820
but I've got it mostly right.
The law society in Ontario has already

279
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:20,150
decided that lawyers are racist,
they're going to force them to undergo

280
00:15:20,151 --> 00:15:22,540
on unconscious bias training and they've
come to,

281
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,480
and they're agreeing by the way,
um,

282
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,070
they've already come to the conclusion
that because the legal profession does

283
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:31,490
not have the precise representation that
you would expect if you did a

284
00:15:31,491 --> 00:15:35,360
demographic analysis of the population
according to the terms defined by the

285
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:39,200
social justice warriors,
that it's racist and that they're racist

286
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:42,260
and that they need to be trained
unconscious first.

287
00:15:42,261 --> 00:15:43,530
It's like,
so go ahead.

288
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,500
Lawyers like line up,
man,

289
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:49,040
admit your guilt.
You're done and you deserve that too.

290
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,230
So,
Yep.

291
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:57,350
Starting to become afraid of the answers
to these questions,

292
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:01,970
um,
can left and right wing people ever

293
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,830
meaningfully communicate with each
other.

294
00:16:03,831 --> 00:16:06,230
And I'm wondering if you can comment a
little about temper mentality and the

295
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:07,070
differences there in

296
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,980
that's what they do in a democracy.
Look,

297
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,950
the lefties,
they're high in openness and low in

298
00:16:13,951 --> 00:16:18,570
conscientiousness and that means they
don't like responsibility that much,

299
00:16:18,571 --> 00:16:21,390
but they're pretty damn creative and
they're not very orderly,

300
00:16:21,391 --> 00:16:24,510
especially they're not very orderly.
And that's part of conscientiousness by

301
00:16:24,511 --> 00:16:27,060
the way,
and so they're good at being artists and

302
00:16:27,061 --> 00:16:29,850
they're good at being entrepreneurs,
but they're terrible at running things.

303
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,100
But then the conservatives on the other
side,

304
00:16:32,101 --> 00:16:34,830
there are low in openness,
which is the treat creativity.

305
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,360
That doesn't mean they're stupid by the
way.

306
00:16:36,361 --> 00:16:37,940
It just means they're,
they're,

307
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:40,890
they're,
they're thinking isn't as free form,

308
00:16:40,891 --> 00:16:43,140
let's put it that way.
And so it's more constrained and they're

309
00:16:43,141 --> 00:16:45,510
high in conscientiousness,
especially orderliness.

310
00:16:45,511 --> 00:16:48,300
So they're damn good at running things
that already work.

311
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,500
So you need the liberals.
There wouldn't be high openness,

312
00:16:52,501 --> 00:16:54,750
low conscientiousness if there wasn't a
niche for it.

313
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,320
And you need the conservatives and
sometimes the liberals are right,

314
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,200
the border should be more open because
that's their fundamental claim.

315
00:17:01,201 --> 00:17:02,730
And sometimes the conservatives are
right.

316
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:05,190
The borders between things should be
more closed and,

317
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,220
and because they're both right some of
the time.

318
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,800
And because the environment keeps
snaking around,

319
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,280
you have to have dialogue between the
two sources constantly,

320
00:17:14,281 --> 00:17:18,120
constantly so that the,
the Paula de can orient itself as the

321
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:21,780
snake of the environment moves.
And that's why you need free speech.

322
00:17:21,781 --> 00:17:24,180
And so the left and the right get along
perfectly well together,

323
00:17:24,181 --> 00:17:27,390
as long as they can talk to each other,
but as soon as they can't talk to each

324
00:17:27,391 --> 00:17:29,010
other,
then the alternative,

325
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,490
there's only one alternate to
alternatives to negotiation.

326
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:36,390
Simple as that one is slavery,
the other risk tyranny.

327
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,640
So those you cannot negotiate with will
either become your slaves or your

328
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,380
tyrants.
So you wipe outs free speech,

329
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,500
then that's what you're left with.
And that's why free speech isn't just

330
00:17:46,501 --> 00:17:48,360
another right,
for Christ's sake,

331
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,380
it's not another right?
How dumb can you be to think that you

332
00:17:52,381 --> 00:17:56,760
don't know anything if you think that
it's the mechanism by which people have

333
00:17:56,761 --> 00:17:57,810
different opinions

334
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,800
talk instead of strangling each other.
So and,

335
00:18:04,101 --> 00:18:05,580
uh,
but if you want them to strangle each

336
00:18:05,581 --> 00:18:08,640
other,
which you might then really,

337
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,960
you might then take away the right to
express their opinion and watched the

338
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:17,580
whole thing go up in flames and go like
this because maybe that's what a big

339
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:19,590
part of you wants.
So

340
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,920
do you see any connection between
antisemitism and postmodernism

341
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:27,900
specifically on university campuses?

342
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,110
I had an insight the other day,
um,

343
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:35,530
and it actually came through some
psychoanalytic reading.

344
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:41,540
Um,
I googled anti Semitic images

345
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,120
and I invite you to all do that.
And three quarters of those images came

346
00:18:49,031 --> 00:18:54,031
up as an old man with the big nose and
he was doing really one of three things.

347
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,240
He was counting his money.
He was torturing a child or in an

348
00:19:05,021 --> 00:19:09,370
Israeli guys.
He was stealing territory and it just,

349
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,730
it was amazing.
And I thought of a picture of what Jews

350
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,880
look like and there's men and women and
they're all ages and there's lots of

351
00:19:15,881 --> 00:19:19,210
children.
And that was interesting.

352
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:23,920
There was one picture of a woman who was
like a bad Jew.

353
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,670
She was witch.
And

354
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,640
there are some psychoanalytic concepts
that I'll share with you now that I

355
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:39,110
think relate both to postmodernism and
anti antisemitism.

356
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,690
And it's this,
you know,

357
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,130
analytically,
if things go well when we're in her

358
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:47,150
mother's womb,
you know,

359
00:19:47,151 --> 00:19:51,410
there's a sense we,
we think of a kind of a paradise that

360
00:19:51,411 --> 00:19:52,520
human beings beginning.

361
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:58,300
And of course there are many stories
about the expulsion from paradise.

362
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:03,790
But if our childhoods go well and we're
the apple of our parents die and they

363
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:08,770
hold us and they sued us and we imagined
we want milk and milk arises.

364
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:13,120
There's this early period where there's
this kind of narcissistic,

365
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,540
it's not in a negative way,
just wonderful thing where everything

366
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,060
works out where we're totally
egocentric,

367
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,290
but it's appropriate and we're in a kind
of a paradise.

368
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:27,700
And of course in the course of life,
we move in and out of that now then

369
00:20:27,701 --> 00:20:31,840
reality hits and reality hits in terms
of discomforts.

370
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,020
And so it's,
it's a kind of natural biological thing

371
00:20:35,021 --> 00:20:37,300
that happens.
But as we get older,

372
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,890
we learned that to go into society,
there are limits on us and there are

373
00:20:41,891 --> 00:20:44,890
rules
and

374
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:51,750
if can't deal with that,
we develop an image in our minds of that

375
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,250
he or it's usually a,
he for mythological reasons.

376
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:00,140
Rules are often tied into,
um,

377
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,420
the masculine and nature is often tied
into the feminine.

378
00:21:04,421 --> 00:21:06,400
And in many cross cultural mist,

379
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,550
the,
the representative or the symbol of the

380
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,050
rule giver that I don't like,
that I don't detest is often a male.

381
00:21:16,051 --> 00:21:20,970
A father and old,
and one of the things about Judaism,

382
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:25,320
everybody who studied it knows is
there's a lot of laws and there's a lot

383
00:21:25,321 --> 00:21:30,321
of rules and the picture of God in
Judaism is often depicted as a man who

384
00:21:33,121 --> 00:21:36,630
can be angry or a times punitive and so
on.

385
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:42,140
So I think one of the things that has
happened is that's caused antisemitism,

386
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:48,600
is that the the Jew,
a pot onto the Jew is projected,

387
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:53,220
are discontent with the fact that in
life one of the things we have to do is

388
00:21:53,221 --> 00:21:57,450
face limit and rules and even the French
psychoanalyst talked about the no of the

389
00:21:57,451 --> 00:22:02,451
father and saw the superego is a
negative male image and one of the

390
00:22:02,611 --> 00:22:03,480
things about

391
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:10,470
having had a very protective upbringing
or overprotected upbringing that Jordan

392
00:22:11,771 --> 00:22:16,771
was describing and I was describing
earlier is as I put it earlier,

393
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:17,860
I said,
if you've,

394
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:22,360
if you've had a denatured existence and
then you come up against limits and

395
00:22:22,361 --> 00:22:24,820
adult life,
it feels that all the problems are

396
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:27,770
caused by human beings and rules.
I'm,

397
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,450
I'm sorry for the long answer,
but it's,

398
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,580
it's,
it's a serious,

399
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:32,310
serious question.
You know,

400
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:37,770
I talked a lot about some of the very
good things in classical liberalism and

401
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:42,370
classical liberalism can be shared by
modern conservatives and modern

402
00:22:42,371 --> 00:22:44,530
liberals.
There are liberal liberals and liberal

403
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:46,450
conservatives.
There are also a liberal conservatives

404
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:51,460
and liberals and I don't see anything
better than the classical liberal

405
00:22:51,911 --> 00:22:54,670
arguments to keep us talking to each
other,

406
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:58,450
but that's not to say that liberalism is
perfect.

407
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:04,100
I'm liberalism to some degree because it
doesn't take a position on things and

408
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,440
stays open on things in ways that
certain traditional approaches don't.

409
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:13,870
They,
they will take a position on things does

410
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:18,900
slip easily into relativism and
relativism basically says a and

411
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:25,570
relativism is embraced by postmodernism
when they're not trying to change the

412
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,470
world in a particular way.
So it's,

413
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,830
it's on and off again.
Kind of relationship.

414
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:35,280
Relativism says that there is no solid
philosophical underpinning for thought

415
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:42,160
thoughts about right and wrong or good
and evil or how we should act,

416
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,330
and that creates a massive amount of
anxiety and when ever any of us in our

417
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:52,331
lives come up against the limit or
border or some kind of essential.

418
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:58,220
If we've been raised relativistically,
as many young people have today to

419
00:23:58,221 --> 00:23:59,450
think,
well,

420
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,910
you know,
you're not really entitled to take your

421
00:24:01,911 --> 00:24:05,600
point of view too seriously at all
because nothing's really right or wrong.

422
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:08,180
It's just a value judgment.
Um,

423
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:13,360
then you can start to resent or be angry
about rules or limits.

424
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:17,630
So part of the postmodern attack is on
anything,

425
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:18,883
uh,
uh,

426
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:22,790
certain things in biological which seem
akin to laws.

427
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:25,970
I'm not saying that there are laws of
nature of the way.

428
00:24:25,971 --> 00:24:29,480
There are laws of human beings,
but there are these regularities or

429
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:33,620
patterns in nature that we see and we
often as a short form,

430
00:24:33,621 --> 00:24:38,300
call them laws and postmodernism often
attacks those and says no.

431
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:43,301
They're just socially constructed,
which means imagined to in some way or

432
00:24:43,311 --> 00:24:46,430
other appease or please a social,
a social group.

433
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,940
So this is a long roundabout answer,
but I think that many of us carry within

434
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:59,411
us a deep resentment in our narcissistic
parts of ourselves that in this life we

435
00:25:02,511 --> 00:25:07,511
have to adapt to limit and law.
And that can come up as depicting an

436
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:15,230
image of an older man who represents
someone who's hidebound by law,

437
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,050
um,
and doesn't have a spirit and is

438
00:25:18,051 --> 00:25:20,900
fundamentally greedy and trying to take
something away from you.

439
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:22,723
And,

440
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,993
uh,

441
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,790
that shows up in postmodernism.
And by the way,

442
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,810
you know,
the idea,

443
00:25:28,811 --> 00:25:30,310
for instance,
that the Jew is greedy.

444
00:25:30,311 --> 00:25:34,110
I haven't completely figured that out,
but I've got an answer for that.

445
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,993
Okay.
Well,

446
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,840
but I just want to say a few things.
It's very interesting.

447
00:25:37,841 --> 00:25:42,841
The old man is often abusing a child in
those antisemitic images.

448
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:47,530
And of course there were stories about
Jews kidnapping,

449
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,070
gentel children and sucking their blood
and eating their blood and so on and so

450
00:25:51,071 --> 00:25:54,340
forth is Passover.
I think that's a hint that this is the

451
00:25:54,341 --> 00:25:59,341
child's view of a terrifying father
image that is trying to take something

452
00:26:01,571 --> 00:26:03,940
away from you.
And of course

453
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,090
it's about patriarchy,
isn't it?

454
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:10,450
I mean,
the idea is this man represents the

455
00:26:10,451 --> 00:26:15,070
tribe or some kind of control and,
and postmodernism is very much against

456
00:26:15,071 --> 00:26:16,780
that.
So again,

457
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:21,160
today I spoke a lot about rational
things,

458
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:24,880
but Jordan has spoken about mythology
and you know,

459
00:26:24,881 --> 00:26:28,210
they're very,
very deep archetypal and mythological

460
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:32,530
things that are driving a lot of this
and that's why it's worth,

461
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,900
you know,
Google antisemitic images and you'll see

462
00:26:34,901 --> 00:26:38,280
what I mean.
We're also,

463
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,530
you know,
one thing to consider is if,

464
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:43,290
if you're a minority,
you should at least have the decency be

465
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:44,280
unsuccessful,

466
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,201
right?
You know,

467
00:26:54,201 --> 00:26:56,090
what,
if you regard the system is corrupt,

468
00:26:56,091 --> 00:26:58,720
then you're going to regard the people
who are successful say

469
00:26:58,721 --> 00:27:02,020
disproportionately even as ultimately
corrupt.

470
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:05,290
And that's kind of convenient if you're
angry about the fact that you're not

471
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:06,550
successful.
And so,

472
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,890
you know,
that's not the only driving force,

473
00:27:08,891 --> 00:27:10,570
but that's,
that's a good part of it,

474
00:27:10,571 --> 00:27:11,140
man.

475
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,390
So,
you know,

476
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:17,660
there's nothing better than being
punished for your virtues.

477
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,433
So,

478
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:26,480
but you touched on this briefly,
but there were quite a few questions

479
00:27:26,481 --> 00:27:28,850
about it.
So I think it's worth rehashing and

480
00:27:28,851 --> 00:27:30,080
perhaps expanding,
uh,

481
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,270
on,
uh,

482
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,920
what do you make of this strange
bedfellows ship between the politically

483
00:27:33,921 --> 00:27:36,620
correct,
left and Islamic activities?

484
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:39,320
Is there an element of cognitive
dissidence?

485
00:27:39,321 --> 00:27:43,670
And I'm wondering if you could also
touch on bill 59 in Quebec right now.

486
00:27:43,671 --> 00:27:46,490
This is kind of the Sharia compliance
bill that's going on over there.

487
00:27:46,491 --> 00:27:48,590
Basically thought crimes against the
prophet.

488
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,880
Um,
we'll,

489
00:27:49,881 --> 00:27:51,680
we'll see you legally reprimanded.

490
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,893
Oh,
I'll start.

491
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,050
Start.
So the first part.

492
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:02,600
Good.
Just tell him.

493
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,040
Just tell me the first part of that
question again if you would tell us.

494
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,221
Oh yeah,
yeah,

495
00:28:06,221 --> 00:28:06,971
yeah.
There's nothing,

496
00:28:06,971 --> 00:28:09,430
there's nothing,
there's nothing contradictory about that

497
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,910
except you know,
arguments have layers,

498
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,020
very many layers and something can be
contradictory at one level and,

499
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,590
and,
and non contradictory of another.

500
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,210
It means you're thinking is disorganized
in some profound way,

501
00:28:22,211 --> 00:28:25,420
but it happens all the time because
you're thinking is a disorganized in

502
00:28:25,421 --> 00:28:28,600
some profound way.
But when push comes to shove,

503
00:28:28,601 --> 00:28:30,730
you find out what the basic motivation
is.

504
00:28:30,731 --> 00:28:33,430
And that's why I said already the enemy
of your enemy,

505
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:38,670
the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
And so if your fundamental goal is to

506
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,900
enhance women's freedom,
let's say,

507
00:28:40,901 --> 00:28:44,140
well then it's going to be pretty rough
to be crop climb into bed with,

508
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:46,600
let's say the Saudis,
as I already mentioned.

509
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:51,310
But if your fundamental goal is to recap
havoc with Western civilization,

510
00:28:51,311 --> 00:28:52,001
it's like,
well,

511
00:28:52,001 --> 00:28:53,140
hey,
that's not a problem.

512
00:28:53,141 --> 00:28:54,730
There's still cognitive dissonance
there.

513
00:28:54,731 --> 00:28:57,700
That's you can sacrifice the whole
rights thing.

514
00:28:57,701 --> 00:28:59,830
It's like,
it's not like you were ready for that to

515
00:28:59,831 --> 00:29:03,100
any great degree anyways at the bottom
of your nasty little soul.

516
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:08,460
So there no cognitive dissonance there.
It's just another tactic as far as I can

517
00:29:08,471 --> 00:29:10,600
tell.
And you know the fact that it also

518
00:29:10,601 --> 00:29:15,601
allows for broad scale attacks on what
you might consider this.

519
00:29:16,511 --> 00:29:20,800
Maybe as putting it a bit too bluntly.
The only country in the Middle East that

520
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:25,530
has any resemblance of of success,
then so much the better because they're

521
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,560
just representations of patriarchal
oppression.

522
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:32,680
Because how could they be anything else
since there's no such thing as

523
00:29:32,681 --> 00:29:35,320
competence properly defined within the
patriarchy.

524
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:40,810
So forget about cognitive dissonance.
You just watch what people do when

525
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,980
they're,
when they face a

526
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,910
paradox.
And then you'll understand their deeper

527
00:29:44,911 --> 00:29:45,880
motivations,
just

528
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,233
so

529
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,980
I've just been told that they're
actually going to be closing the

530
00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:58,060
auditorium momentarily.
So I worried that's going to be the very

531
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,133
last,
uh,

532
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,340
question.
Uh,

533
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,640
however I will say that on behalf of the
entire audience,

534
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,660
thank you so very much to both of you
gentlemen and scholars for,

535
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,321
for,
for,

536
00:30:08,321 --> 00:30:10,690
um,
bringing together both nature and

537
00:30:10,691 --> 00:30:14,110
nurture with all of your backgrounds and
forming our own opinions,

538
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:16,980
beliefs,
and hopefully acting as role models and

539
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:19,510
how we should combat political
correctness in our own lives.

540
00:30:19,511 --> 00:30:20,344
So thank you.

541
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,900
Thank you.
