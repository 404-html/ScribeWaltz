1
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,960
Wait,
she's

2
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,400
actually
trying

3
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,280
to to improve the coherency

4
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,113
of this manuscript by all.
I gave you the summary for the whole 

5
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:02,880
thing last week,
week before,

6
00:06:02,881 --> 00:06:03,714
and now I'm going to write a summary for
every chapter and hopefully that'll 

7
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,853
provide a structure for the more
either elaborate or vague depending on 

8
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:15,790
your perspective arguments that fall.
So,

9
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,473
so anyways,
what you have is the summary of the 

10
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:23,264
preface,
which is very short and then a summary 

11
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:26,114
of
the argument that I've been making 

12
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:34,890
through that
it's reasonable to conceive of the world

13
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:35,924
in two ways.
Just trying to reduce that argument to 

14
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:45,851
its essential aspect.
And then the last two pages contain

15
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,910
a description of the instinctive 
response to novelty

16
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,680
and the manner in which that response 
finds its representation and mythology.

17
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,770
And maybe by next week I'll have like 
four more chapters,

18
00:07:04,771 --> 00:07:07,010
summaries or something for you.
Then you look.

19
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:16,260
Okay,
so where are generally.

20
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:19,783
We've been discussing the possibility 
that the dangers that are inherent to 

21
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:25,214
group identity,
which is the tendency of group identity 

22
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:29,234
to adopt that totalitarian stamps,
which is a consequence of its of any 

23
00:07:33,351 --> 00:07:36,650
groups propensity to try to maintain 
that structure over time.

24
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:38,483
We're we're discussing the possibility 
that that inevitable tendency of the 

25
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:46,661
group might be heightened in its danger 
by certain types of individuals.

26
00:07:47,221 --> 00:07:50,240
Psychopathology,
and I was trying to make the argument

27
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,581
it's interesting,
you know,

28
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:53,414
this week in the Atlantic monthly,
there's a discussion of William James 

29
00:07:56,631 --> 00:07:57,464
and his,
his inquiry into religious 

30
00:07:58,461 --> 00:07:59,294
phenomenology,
which was apparently motivated in large 

31
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:04,610
part by his use of nitric oxide,
but there's an also an argument in there

32
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:05,444
that elaborates upon shelly Taylor's 
findings in social psychology that 

33
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,490
positive illusions according to tailor 
foster mental health.

34
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,353
Anyways.
That idea has now spread right out into 

35
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:17,564
the mainstream press and the guy who 
wrote the Atlantic monthly article and 

36
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,793
just making the point that
the validity of a belief might be 

37
00:08:26,361 --> 00:08:28,190
determined by whether or not it makes 
you happy.

38
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,720
She's a very,
very,

39
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:31,520
very dangerous perspective.

40
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:34,953
It's back to this,
back to this minority might these and I 

41
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:38,924
brought that up is because of course 
that's a point that's absolutely 

42
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:42,860
contrary to the point that I've been 
trained in making this class,

43
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:46,430
which is it's the individual tendency to
deceive themselves,

44
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,473
to deceive ourselves,
but the deceit oneself about the nature 

45
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:51,284
of reality as it's defined personally.
That constitutes the basic form of 

46
00:08:55,561 --> 00:08:57,720
psychopathology attorneys with the 
group,

47
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:58,973
which is a necessary but dangerous 
structure into something that's 

48
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,850
pathologically dangerous.
Now the argument,

49
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,743
basically I'll start,
we'll discuss that argument today a 

50
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:13,020
little bit more detail,
but then I want to flip

51
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,473
to the last part of the course which is 
a discussion of the process and that 

52
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:18,684
hopefully will serve as an antithesis to
this individual pathology so you can 

53
00:09:23,671 --> 00:09:24,301
describe,
you know,

54
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:25,134
you can define thing something very well
by describing its opposite and that's 

55
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:32,160
why we have anti heroes and literature 
at least in part because they're good,

56
00:09:32,161 --> 00:09:32,994
bad examples and you can infer the 
opposite of something from the 

57
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,560
description of that thing.

58
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,010
So it's perfectly reasonable to started 
description of

59
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,770
identification with heroism.
I suppose by discussing its opposite.

60
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,490
You said,
I wrote a quote from him on page 211.

61
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,673
He said,
who alone has reason to lie himself out 

62
00:09:54,991 --> 00:09:58,620
of actuality and his answer to that was 
he who suffers from it?

63
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,213
Well,
that's an interesting statement because 

64
00:10:01,621 --> 00:10:04,170
obviously it's not a description of an 
individual person

65
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,293
or a way of drawing a distinction 
between those who lie and those who 

66
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:11,124
don't.
Really.

67
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,720
It's more a way of saying that since 
it's obvious that everybody suffers from

68
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:16,554
actuality that everyone has sufficient 
motivation to lie and what we're going 

69
00:10:22,821 --> 00:10:24,600
to try to get out a little bit today 
again,

70
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,770
is
precisely what that motivation is

71
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,690
and then what the consequences,
the inevitable consequences of following

72
00:10:33,691 --> 00:10:35,400
them additive and outpatient might be.

73
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,613
I made the point last week that it's 
difficult to get a picture of the 

74
00:10:46,311 --> 00:10:47,144
process that serves as the adversarial 
counterpart to the mythological hero 

75
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,483
because
the reason that that process has been 

76
00:10:56,091 --> 00:10:56,924
described as a personality and mythology
because it consists of a number of a 

77
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,993
number of things simultaneously and it's
difficult to discuss something that 

78
00:11:05,601 --> 00:11:07,730
consists of a number of things 
simultaneously.

79
00:11:07,731 --> 00:11:08,564
Because when we discuss anything,
you have to break it down into its 

80
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,784
constituent elements and you risk over 
simplifying the personality or reducing 

81
00:11:15,651 --> 00:11:16,484
it to something to one single thing that
it's not and the tendency ally is a 

82
00:11:20,601 --> 00:11:21,434
bunch of things at once that are all 
interrelated and it would be a mistake 

83
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:28,310
to try to reduce it to a single thing,
but I think at least in part

84
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:31,923
you can,
or one of the essential aspects of the 

85
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:34,534
tendency to lie as rejection error.
Now there's a quote I'm going to read 

86
00:11:38,411 --> 00:11:39,244
you.
A quote from Milton behavior described 

87
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:45,340
Satan's attitude and a
I have a little comment on that.

88
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,100
He says,
first which way I fly is hail myself,

89
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:59,380
am hill and in the lowest deep,
a lower,

90
00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:01,150
deep,
still threatening to devour me,

91
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,480
opens wide to which the hell I suffer 
seems to heaven.

92
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,433
The Devil Who's traditional 
representation of evil refuses any 

93
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:10,444
recognition of imperfection,
refuses to admit I was an error in my 

94
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:15,244
action or in my representation,
accepts as a consequence of unbending 

95
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:22,750
pride.
Eternal misery refuses Metanoia,

96
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,290
which is confession and reconciliation's
remains forever.

97
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:29,590
The spirit that refuses and rejects this
is a quote,

98
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,420
oh,
then at last,

99
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:36,430
relent is there no place left for 
repentance now for pardon left,

100
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:43,180
not left by submission,
and that we're disdain for bids,

101
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:44,014
me and my dread of shame among the other
spirits beneath whom I seduced with 

102
00:12:48,491 --> 00:12:51,910
other promises and other violence than 
to submit boasting.

103
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:56,260
I could subdue the omnipotent I me a 
little.

104
00:12:56,261 --> 00:12:57,094
Know how dearly I abide that boast so 
vein under what torments inwardly I 

105
00:13:00,701 --> 00:13:01,600
grown well.

106
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,250
They adore me on the throat of hell with
dynamic sector,

107
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,550
high advanced,
the lower still,

108
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:10,210
I fall only supreme and misery.
Such joy,

109
00:13:10,211 --> 00:13:11,290
ambition,
fines,

110
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,700
but say I could repent and could have 
obtained by active grace,

111
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:18,700
my former state.
How soon should height recall?

112
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:22,210
High thoughts.
How soon unsay what fain submission.

113
00:13:22,211 --> 00:13:23,044
Swore.
These would recant vows made in pain as 

114
00:13:25,841 --> 00:13:29,260
violent and void for never can.
True reconcilement girl,

115
00:13:29,261 --> 00:13:32,170
where were wounds of deadly Hayden peers
so deep,

116
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:35,860
which would lead me to a worse relapse 
and heavier fall.

117
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,340
So should I purchase deere short 
intermission,

118
00:13:39,341 --> 00:13:42,700
bought with double smart vis,
knows my punisher.

119
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,683
Therefore,
as far from granting heat as I from 

120
00:13:45,521 --> 00:13:48,320
begging piece,
all hope excluded us

121
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,790
such refusal,
the inability to say I was wrong,

122
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:54,803
I'm sorry,
I should change means the death of hope 

123
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,240
and existence and how it should be.
This

124
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,490
right?

125
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,323
Rejection of fact means alienation from 
meaning from truth and life without 

126
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:07,434
meaning is suffering without recourse 
where the have nothing but construction 

127
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:15,140
in accordance with self definition.
So the idea I guess what we're trying to

128
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:20,250
do in a sense as to unpack what 
rejection of error means.

129
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,473
You already know from looking at a 
picture we put together of the 

130
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:28,640
mythological portrait or portrayal of 
reality that the,

131
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,870
that all new information is gathered as 
a consequence of contact with a known.

132
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,150
I mean this is just a definition,
right?

133
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,073
You can't gather anything,
any new information unless you're 

134
00:14:39,331 --> 00:14:41,160
somewhere that you haven't been so to 
speak.

135
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,013
You have to be in territory that's 
unexplored to gather anything that's 

136
00:14:45,631 --> 00:14:47,180
normal.
Now,

137
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,290
the problem with that from a moral 
perspective,

138
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:50,124
so to speak,
since we're dealing with behavior and 

139
00:14:52,441 --> 00:14:55,520
emotion,
is that the only way that you can get to

140
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:56,354
be somewhere that you don't know is by 
admitting to the existence of anomalous 

141
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:04,220
to the existence of anomaly and that's 
tantamount to an admission that you were

142
00:15:04,221 --> 00:15:05,054
incorrect.

143
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:10,690
The idea of
having your vision of yourself and where

144
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:14,120
you are and you're contracting with a 
vision of where you want to be.

145
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,980
That's that's sort of your own 
definition of what constitutes the world

146
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:21,230
and both of those polls are subject to 
modification,

147
00:15:21,231 --> 00:15:23,600
but you're the one who decides what the 
polls are.

148
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,453
I mean you're.
You're setting up the rules of the game 

149
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,880
and then if by your own definition,
your actions which are designed to bring

150
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:34,040
where you are to where you want to be 
produced,

151
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:36,740
a contrary result,
that's anomalous.

152
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,100
That's an enormous piece of information.
By your own definition,

153
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,333
see you.
I stress that because the problem with 

154
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:44,954
talking about something like error is 
that you might think that implicit in 

155
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,124
that discussion is the notion that 
there's some that you have to make 

156
00:15:51,381 --> 00:15:54,140
recourse to an idea of absolute truth to
talk about error,

157
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,063
but you don't like.
This model is predicated on the notion 

158
00:15:57,741 --> 00:16:01,550
that you define the terms of the 
argument for yourself,

159
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,583
which is to say you're the one who 
decides where you are and also where 

160
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:07,574
you're going.
I mean you pull in information from 

161
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,990
outside to make those decisions of 
course,

162
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,033
but still your game and if the actions 
that you've constructed produce results 

163
00:16:17,421 --> 00:16:20,600
that you didn't intend,
that's what constitutes an anomaly.

164
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,740
So it isn't that you have to know 
anything about absolute truth,

165
00:16:23,741 --> 00:16:24,574
so to speak,
to determine when you are in fact an 

166
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:27,770
error because you make the decisions.

167
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:37,060
Establishing a relationship or an aspect
of that information that you get back in

168
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,063
the context of that relationship when it
contradicts information is coming from 

169
00:16:42,231 --> 00:16:43,064
another source
rather than rather than it being some 

170
00:16:46,821 --> 00:16:50,340
sort of internal framework that you have
established.

171
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,223
Yes.
It's a conflict between the meaning 

172
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:56,300
you're getting two different 
relationships.

173
00:16:56,301 --> 00:16:58,320
You have.
I would say that that's.

174
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,203
I would say that that's an equivalent,
that's an equivalent phenomenon because 

175
00:17:02,181 --> 00:17:07,181
it is one of the examples I'm using the 
text made about abortion because you can

176
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:08,024
say,
well,

177
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,643
there's a lot of emotional intensity 
surrounding the abortion debate because 

178
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:17,210
it pits to cultural schemas against the 
against one.

179
00:17:17,211 --> 00:17:20,360
Another one says,
the right to life is paramount,

180
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,560
which is a perfectly no one position,
and the other position says no,

181
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:26,180
the right to freedom,
right to free choices.

182
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,320
Paramount.
Now,

183
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,273
under most circumstances,
most people in this society except both 

184
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:31,670
of those,
uh,

185
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:36,260
moral presuppositions about abortion,
happens to be one situation,

186
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,200
assuming good will on both sides,
so to speak.

187
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,423
I'd have to be one situation where the 
phenomena of the world presents us with 

188
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,830
puts those two positions necessarily at 
odds.

189
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,903
So then a third decision is necessary,
which is the decision to hierarchically 

190
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,353
arranged to preceptive presuppositions.
So it can be the case that one 

191
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:56,424
philosophical stance that's done in most
circumstances and another valid in most 

192
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:03,120
circumstances and meet in a third place 
and more in opposition.

193
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,293
So then you get a situation where there 
there was an environmental phenomena 

194
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,300
which would be the possibility of 
unwanted possibility of abortion,

195
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,140
that the two moral systems,
which are modes of adaptation,

196
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:19,560
do not properly address.
And then what happens?

197
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,723
Well that's,
that's the eruption of an anomalous 

198
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:27,150
occurrence into a cultural structure and
one of the things that happens when that

199
00:18:27,151 --> 00:18:28,740
sort of thing happens is that you get a 
war.

200
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,980
There is a war in this country between 
those two positions.

201
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,680
It's just mostly still fought at the 
level of words,

202
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:39,360
but not always.
So that's the.

203
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,020
That's a conflict of values.
And you said,

204
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:43,854
for example,
that the most difficult moral decisions 

205
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,120
always come about when there's a 
conflict of duty.

206
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,440
One valid principle says actually 
pattern a.

207
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:53,483
another valid principle says action 
pattern be the two action patterns 

208
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,433
juxtapose,
juxtapose what was producing Iran 

209
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,403
irreconcilable situation.
Then then the question is what do you 

210
00:19:03,871 --> 00:19:05,310
do?
What can you do?

211
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,473
Well,
that's part of what we're going to get 

212
00:19:07,671 --> 00:19:08,504
at when we,
when we get to the end of the argument 

213
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:15,060
today,
it's impossible here and it's impossible

214
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:15,990
there.
What do you do?

215
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:16,890
That's the question.

216
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,223
Yeah.
I guess I was wondering whether those 

217
00:19:19,761 --> 00:19:23,450
two situations are analogous,
but the emphasis was slightly different.

218
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:24,403
Whether you've got to resolve it 
internally or when did you've got to 

219
00:19:26,901 --> 00:19:30,540
resolve it in a sense of several hundred
connections with one of those.

220
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,420
Well,
that's an.

221
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,040
That's an option.
That's an option.

222
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,573
I would say one of the things we're 
going to discuss today is consequences 

223
00:19:38,381 --> 00:19:39,214
of response patterns to anomalous 
information and I would say well one 

224
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:46,650
common way of dealing with the normal 
occurrence that's so tight.

225
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,753
It's just a fortify the position that 
you think is most appropriate and 

226
00:19:50,681 --> 00:19:53,690
exclude the rest.
Well,

227
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,490
it's that sort of solution writ large 
and society.

228
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,940
I mean it has its advantages.
It's protected,

229
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:05,560
but it's also that sort of solution that
taken to an extreme causes.

230
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,370
What causes the walls to rise up around 
communities.

231
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:11,973
One way of eliminating anomalous 
information is to increase the 

232
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,200
conformance and within the group and to 
put more barriers up.

233
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,780
Just stop information from flowing in.
It's a good solution,

234
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,333
but it has its problems,
so anyone's is your idea that all the 

235
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:29,690
anomaly is personal error is experienced
as personal level.

236
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,100
The asset.
I mean that's basically the idea.

237
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,410
Exactly.
Is that the unknown?

238
00:20:35,411 --> 00:20:37,870
Actually,
because the unknown,

239
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,823
the way that we're construing it is a 
phenomena that appears cloaked in 

240
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:42,963
effect.
It's always necessarily making its 

241
00:20:44,831 --> 00:20:47,140
appearance on the scene of individual 
consciousness.

242
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,290
So the thing is you're acting out.
Your moral presuppositions,

243
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,950
which you have determined by your own 
rules are the ones you should act out.

244
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:59,160
Then a piece of information pops up its 
ugly head suggesting that your means are

245
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:02,050
wrong,
or in a catastrophic case,

246
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,770
the manner in which you construe the 
present or your ends are wrong.

247
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,260
In which case you're.
You're really,

248
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:08,920
you're really in trouble.
Well,

249
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,100
the question is what?
Then?

250
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:14,320
What do you do that?
Well,

251
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,330
that's part of what we're going to.
There's,

252
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,950
there's three alternatives.
I think.

253
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,053
One is that you can even just
pretend the anomalous thing never 

254
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:24,874
happened and continue on in your path as
if the world was the way you thought it 

255
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:31,000
was when you know it not to be the case.

256
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,523
That's one.
The other is to actively take measures 

257
00:21:34,451 --> 00:21:39,451
to get rid of the anomalous information.
That's a more extreme,

258
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:41,260
very tough.
That first position.

259
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,753
The second is to give up your whole 
moral system and the underground 

260
00:21:48,491 --> 00:21:50,800
advantage to that is the normal systems 
or hey,

261
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,693
in a sense,
I mean they they have a protective 

262
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:55,900
function certainly,
but to adhere to the means that you have

263
00:21:55,901 --> 00:21:56,734
to discipline your behavior.
So I made a comment in there at one 

264
00:22:01,561 --> 00:22:02,394
point about the dark side of of 
liberalism as well as many comments 

265
00:22:06,511 --> 00:22:08,150
about the dark side of conservatives.

266
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,103
One of the reasons to be extraordinarily
to welcome novel information is so that 

267
00:22:17,091 --> 00:22:17,924
you can dissolve all those structures to
which you might have otherwise had to 

268
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:22,124
adhere.
The problem with adhering to those 

269
00:22:23,631 --> 00:22:25,340
structures is that it takes a lot of 
work,

270
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,510
like if you want to be an optimal member
of any given society.

271
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,303
There's a whole structure of discipline 
that's necessary to adhere to and it's 

272
00:22:35,691 --> 00:22:40,250
easy to say,
I'm very tolerant when actually what you

273
00:22:40,251 --> 00:22:43,430
mean is I can't tolerate any of this 
responsibility.

274
00:22:43,431 --> 00:22:45,680
I'll just let it go and everything's 
okay,

275
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,813
but you can get away with that for a 
long time because usually you're 

276
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:52,100
protected by other people who are 
adhering to the rules and who makes sure

277
00:22:52,101 --> 00:22:55,310
that like the unabomber,
make sure that you stay alive.

278
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,950
So
okay,

279
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:01,080
well the.
Okay,

280
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:01,973
so
this argument always loops back onto 

281
00:23:06,271 --> 00:23:07,104
itself because the processes are 
actually can only be described as in 

282
00:23:10,471 --> 00:23:11,304
terms of feedback loop,
so it's very difficult to get a handle 

283
00:23:13,231 --> 00:23:15,810
on the origin of the story,
so to say,

284
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,620
so to speak.

285
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,453
But
why would you reject the appearance of 

286
00:23:21,571 --> 00:23:25,110
anomalous information?
Say animals don't seem to do that.

287
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,910
While I'm on the argument that I've been
trying to present is that as you pointed

288
00:23:29,911 --> 00:23:31,920
out,
we all have a reason to lie.

289
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,181
She said,
well,

290
00:23:33,181 --> 00:23:36,630
why would you bother on?
His answer was,

291
00:23:36,631 --> 00:23:37,770
well,
because you suffered from it.

292
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,600
That's a good answer.
Well,

293
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:40,443
now it's a one sentence description of 
the process that I was trying to 

294
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:46,340
describe in the chapter on the 
development of self consciousness.

295
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,210
The problem for human beings is that 
even for animals,

296
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,133
the appearance of an anomalous piece of 
information is sufficient to activate 

297
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:58,780
the right frontal cortical circuitry 
that governs negative AFLAC.

298
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:02,630
Sprite and a normal occurrence stops you
in your tracks.

299
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:06,320
So if you're a rabbit and you're hopping
along the bush and you hear a noise that

300
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:07,154
shouldn't be there,
or you see a shape that's moving like a 

301
00:24:09,111 --> 00:24:11,330
Predator,
what will happen to you?

302
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:14,390
That's something that should not be.
What will happen to you

303
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,360
is that you will freeze,
right?

304
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:21,680
Because the systems that govern anxiety 
and inhibition of behavior gripped,

305
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,570
gripped your critical apparatus.
Same thing happens in people.

306
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,720
Our first response to an anomalous 
event,

307
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,350
it is anxiety and the cessation of 
ongoing behavior,

308
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:36,140
which is exactly how it should be.
Because if an anomalous event occurs,

309
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:39,140
it's.
It indicates by its very nature that the

310
00:24:39,141 --> 00:24:43,070
plan you were undertaking is wrong.
Because otherwise the anomalous piece of

311
00:24:43,071 --> 00:24:46,130
information wouldn't have showed up.
But the problem with us is that

312
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,503
the whole domain of anomaly,
which can be conceptualized as a place 

313
00:24:53,271 --> 00:24:55,370
and is conceptualized that way in 
mythology,

314
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:56,623
is contaminated by our knowledge of the 
potential consequences of air and those 

315
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,033
consequences.
I mean you can kind of divided into two 

316
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,533
camps.

317
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:10,270
One price of admission of error is that 
you have to regard yourself as less than

318
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:14,510
the group that you identify with it.
Just to say that you look like a fool in

319
00:25:14,511 --> 00:25:18,830
front of people who theoretically you 
want respect and admiration.

320
00:25:18,831 --> 00:25:19,664
Prop knows can be actual people or they 
can be the people that live in your 

321
00:25:23,211 --> 00:25:27,350
head.
So the Super Ego Persona,

322
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:29,960
persona five doesn't really matter 
either way.

323
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:30,794
It's the same thing.
You have to recognize yourself as less 

324
00:25:33,351 --> 00:25:34,184
than you might be.
That's one consequence and people are 

325
00:25:37,521 --> 00:25:40,490
very terrified about that.
We don't like exposure of our weaknesses

326
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:41,324
in front of the social group.
Even Freud pointed out in his 

327
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:47,300
interpretation of dreams,
common anxiety dream was to appear naked

328
00:25:47,301 --> 00:25:49,970
in front of a crowd,
which is basically you could say,

329
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,793
to expose your vulnerability to to the 
world or to have that vulnerability 

330
00:25:55,941 --> 00:25:56,774
accidentally exposed,
but when you make a fool of someone 

331
00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:59,960
that's exactly what you're doing.

332
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:02,900
It's like they have pretentions which 
are there plans.

333
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,033
You just twist them appliance fall and 
you see the person behind the plans and 

334
00:26:08,201 --> 00:26:09,034
while they turn red and turned away 
because their vulnerability has been 

335
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:13,820
made manifest to the group and also 
themselves.

336
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:17,090
It's very unpleasant to occurrence.
That's shaming part,

337
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,600
so that's one reason.
The other reason is that for us,

338
00:26:20,601 --> 00:26:25,370
the whole domain of it normally has a is
contaminated by the threat of mortality,

339
00:26:25,371 --> 00:26:26,204
which is something that's not true for 
animals at all because animals can't 

340
00:26:27,951 --> 00:26:32,500
conceive of themselves as an object.
That faces is extreme limitations.

341
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:36,170
The limitations of mortality,
so we have real reason to turn away from

342
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,680
anomaly.
You know,

343
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,760
you want to make it concrete.
For example,

344
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:45,130
I wake up in the morning,
have an 18 year side

345
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:47,963
that ache,
which is an anomalous piece of 

346
00:26:49,981 --> 00:26:50,814
information since you're always acting 
too as a general rule at least maybe if 

347
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,673
you worked out at the gym tonight night 
before you have already made reasoning 

348
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,263
and the ache is bounded by an 
explanation and it's an effect of 

349
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:02,370
Valence is basically zero.

350
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:05,070
I mean you might be able to sniff that 
day in favor the side,

351
00:27:05,071 --> 00:27:07,080
but you're not going to walk around in 
the state of terror.

352
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,930
If you have already made explanation for
the anomaly,

353
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,620
then there's none.
There's an.

354
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,040
It has an unbounded potential 
significance.

355
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,660
Now,
under normal circumstances,

356
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,310
you would like to think,
well,

357
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,413
it doesn't go that serious.
I'll go on with my life and see what 

358
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,050
happens.
If your hypochondriacal,

359
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:26,060
which means that,
well,

360
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,043
it means that you're.
It's easy for you to blow things out of 

361
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:33,600
proportion.
We allow your fantasy too,

362
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:34,463
which is a hypothesis generating machine
to work on providing potential 

363
00:27:38,341 --> 00:27:41,430
explanations for the egg,
which might range from,

364
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,773
I slept wrong too.
This is the incipient incipient sign of 

365
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:49,590
the cancer that will kill me.
I know someone,

366
00:27:49,591 --> 00:27:50,424
for example,
who's father and grandfather both died 

367
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,004
of a heart attack when they were in the 
neighborhood of 40 and he's 35 and he's 

368
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:58,853
borderline agoraphobic,
which basically means that he can't 

369
00:28:01,201 --> 00:28:02,034
tolerate any fluctuations in his heart 
rate because that's one of the signs of 

370
00:28:06,121 --> 00:28:06,720
anger phobia.

371
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,910
People of anger phobia,
if their heart rate goes up,

372
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,920
they tend to think,
oh no,

373
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,060
this is the event that will either lead 
me to make a fool of myself or that will

374
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:15,930
kill me.
Well,

375
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,773
he's in a situation.
It's pretty much like that all the time 

376
00:28:18,091 --> 00:28:21,570
because every time he feels some 
unexplained internally then thanks.

377
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:26,010
That's the end of me.
I could see his.

378
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,590
You can see why he would be neurotic in 
a situation like that.

379
00:28:28,591 --> 00:28:30,750
I mean he has good reason for doubting 
the intake,

380
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:31,883
for doubting the easy explanations for 
the existence of this anomalous 

381
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:39,300
information because heart disease is 
hereditary.

382
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,840
He's a little overweight.
He drinks a little bit too much.

383
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:46,440
He smokes a little bit too much.
He works too hard.

384
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,173
Is good reason for being afraid,
but that's the sort of thing that the 

385
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,753
animals never going to experience 
because an animal can't use it's cortex 

386
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:56,363
against it's limbic system in a sense,
which is something we can what your 

387
00:28:59,401 --> 00:29:01,310
cortex is supposed to do,
your frontal cortex,

388
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,530
then anomalous piece of information pops
up.

389
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:08,220
Your frontal cortex is supposed to map 
out a behavioral pattern that eliminates

390
00:29:08,221 --> 00:29:09,054
the valence from the phenomenon,
but sometimes you can't do that because 

391
00:29:11,311 --> 00:29:14,850
your frontal cortex basically says,
oh no,

392
00:29:14,851 --> 00:29:19,170
this might be the thing that exposes my 
weaknesses to the group or kills me,

393
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,093
in which case your limbic system 
response to that labeling as if that in 

394
00:29:22,831 --> 00:29:25,740
itself is threat and out of control you 
go,

395
00:29:25,741 --> 00:29:29,100
which I think is an explanation for 
panic attacks,

396
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,340
for example,
catastrophic reasoning,

397
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,650
but everybody has.
For me,

398
00:29:34,651 --> 00:29:35,610
the x,
for me,

399
00:29:35,611 --> 00:29:40,500
the mystery of panic attacks is more why
people just don't have the time really,

400
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,423
really,
because the people who haven't had good 

401
00:29:42,761 --> 00:29:45,670
reason for having them,
but those reasons are very much like the

402
00:29:45,671 --> 00:29:47,020
reasons that we all have,

403
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,353
so

404
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:53,140
we're lucky is the answer.
I think under most circumstances,

405
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:54,643
fine.

406
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,640
We're protected by our implicit theories
of belief,

407
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,900
it systems of belief,
and most of us,

408
00:30:03,901 --> 00:30:04,734
I suppose we're taught as children.
If a minor physical anomaly arises that 

409
00:30:10,321 --> 00:30:11,154
the best course of action is to carry on
at least as a motive hypothesis testing 

410
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:23,130
and that's affordable for lots of 
acquired adaptations.

411
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,823
Sounds awesome.
Willing to consider explanations might 

412
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,993
be what?

413
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:31,963
Well,
that's what sure,

414
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,090
and that's one of the things you teach 
in cognitive behavioral therapy,

415
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,373
which is.
But the thing is most of us are lucky 

416
00:30:37,491 --> 00:30:40,790
you see with most people who are 
neurotic,

417
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:44,020
if you provide them with an alternative 
explanation that day five,

418
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:47,150
it has no impact whatsoever on their 
symptomatology.

419
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,760
So you take someone who has obsessive 
compulsive disorder,

420
00:30:49,761 --> 00:30:50,594
for example,
camp which is often manifested in fear 

421
00:30:53,091 --> 00:30:55,100
of contamination.
So here's the line of logic.

422
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,920
There was a garbage can,
garbage cans are dirty,

423
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:58,963
dirt contains bacteria.
Bacteria might kill me or worse my 

424
00:31:01,881 --> 00:31:02,714
children.
So this is an example going from a case 

425
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:06,440
that I know were university educated 
woman.

426
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,990
Nothing wrong with your intelligence,
perfectly normal,

427
00:31:08,991 --> 00:31:11,720
unless she was encountered something 
that was contaminated.

428
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,203
You do response prevention treatment,
which is that you have personally 

429
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,600
encountered the thing that if you're the
most dependent,

430
00:31:17,601 --> 00:31:19,940
stopped him from doing their habitual 
response passage,

431
00:31:19,941 --> 00:31:22,940
which for her was washing her hands 
until they were so raw,

432
00:31:22,941 --> 00:31:25,100
they were shiny anyways.

433
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,250
Um,
she thought that there was a possibility

434
00:31:28,251 --> 00:31:30,170
that if she encountered something that 
was contaminated,

435
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:33,410
which was a category that gotten broader
and broader as her disease progressed,

436
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,480
did she carry home and disease to her 
children?

437
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:36,980
Um,
problem.

438
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,813
See,
the problem with that line of reasoning 

439
00:31:38,361 --> 00:31:39,194
is that it's possible and yeah,
you could say to her and she could 

440
00:31:41,811 --> 00:31:46,730
understand that the probability of such 
an event occurring was virtually zero,

441
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:52,090
but the fact of virtually zero was not 
sufficiently satisfying for that to calm

442
00:31:53,241 --> 00:31:55,880
her because point zero,
zero,

443
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:56,714
zero one percent was too much.
So you couldn't rationally reduce the 

444
00:32:01,431 --> 00:32:02,264
probability to,
to a small enough degree so that her 

445
00:32:06,081 --> 00:32:08,510
thought of that probability could 
regulate your emotions.

446
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:09,703
And the only reason we don't know why,
those sorts of thoughts regulate our 

447
00:32:12,321 --> 00:32:13,154
emotions.
So you're willing to accept it on faith 

448
00:32:15,381 --> 00:32:17,120
for whatever reason you jumped in the 
car.

449
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,303
Do all sorts of things that are 
dangerous without any real 

450
00:32:21,621 --> 00:32:22,454
consideration.
I knew another woman who was an 

451
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:28,940
agoraphobic first thing she used to do 
when she went into any new building when

452
00:32:28,941 --> 00:32:31,370
she didn't like doing.
Let's check out little fire escapes.

453
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,700
Why it might be a fire,
right?

454
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,170
There might be a fire.
What's the profitability?

455
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,050
Lots of low.
She knew that.

456
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,770
She knew that the probability was low 
just like the rest of us know,

457
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,760
but the capacity of that information to 
inhibitor anxiety was gone.

458
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:47,863
The only thing you can do under those 
circumstances is actually have people 

459
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,460
act out,
not caring.

460
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:53,903
Then then then that works.
Some people argue that her 

461
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,133
rationalization,
that behavior is something that comes 

462
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:04,734
after her behavior in that something 
that causes in other words is it isn't 

463
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:12,150
necessarily it.
Couldn't it be one of two things?

464
00:33:12,151 --> 00:33:14,610
Either she she will interest the 
building and things.

465
00:33:14,611 --> 00:33:16,460
My my dentist,
there can be fire,

466
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:17,303
I have to check fire escapes or maybe 
she walked into a building or anxiety 

467
00:33:20,311 --> 00:33:21,660
rises and she says,
I have to check.

468
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:22,723
Sure,
sure.

469
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:23,743
That's possible.
Some of these explanations or post hoc 

470
00:33:26,331 --> 00:33:27,164
rationalizations and it's hard to tell 
like I'm not trying to specify a causal 

471
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:32,910
sequence.
What happens in Andrew Phobia I think is

472
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,153
the behavioral avoidance takes 
precedence over the cognitive 

473
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,400
rationalization,
whatever they are,

474
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,620
but how does the agoraphobic,
because they go to the mall,

475
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:42,050
something frightening happens and they 
run away.

476
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:43,243
Now it's the running away that 
constitutes the point of origin for the 

477
00:33:46,011 --> 00:33:48,590
pathology.
Now they may say,

478
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,513
I ran away because you know,
here's my set of cognitive 

479
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,623
rationalizations.
Many of which might be post hoc 

480
00:33:55,431 --> 00:33:56,264
explanations for my behavior,
but the thing is when you run from 

481
00:33:58,791 --> 00:33:59,624
something,
what you are doing regardless of what 

482
00:34:01,731 --> 00:34:02,564
your thinking is,
labeling it as something so frightened 

483
00:34:05,031 --> 00:34:09,110
that I have to run away from and that's 
the most profound level of labeling that

484
00:34:09,111 --> 00:34:12,930
you can actually utilize it much more 
real than it will.

485
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,813
The secondary or even tertiary semantic 
labeling that we usually associate with 

486
00:34:17,841 --> 00:34:18,674
categorization to run from something 
means to categorize it as too 

487
00:34:22,071 --> 00:34:25,550
frightening to be to bear and also one 
more thing.

488
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,413
It also means to categorize yourself,
and this is even more important as 

489
00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:31,154
something that's so small that in that 
situation the only thing that can be 

490
00:34:33,861 --> 00:34:37,130
done is to run away,
but the reason that the exposure therapy

491
00:34:37,131 --> 00:34:41,740
works is probably mostly because it.
It counters that latter argument,

492
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:46,280
which is that when you,
when you teach someone exposure,

493
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,310
when you use exposure to help someone 
overcome their fears,

494
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:53,510
what you were doing is teaching them 
that they're not so small.

495
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:58,130
That fear will devour them and that's 
what causes the generalization.

496
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,360
It's learning that.

497
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,490
So can you tell us a profound social 
expectation in a situation?

498
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,490
Absolutely,
absolutely no.

499
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:07,403
Or that the therapist uses social 
pressure and everything else to to 

500
00:35:10,681 --> 00:35:13,860
foster the notion that the person can 
withstand the exposure.

501
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,300
Okay.

502
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,680
Can I just translate something benefit 
that I,

503
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,720
that I seem to be hearing in a sense 
from what you said today so far,

504
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:21,951
if,
if I May,

505
00:35:21,951 --> 00:35:26,951
it seems as if the thing that for Texas 
from ethology,

506
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:28,933
the ability to,
to attribute and multiple meanings to 

507
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:32,084
something that the ability that our 
prefrontal cortex gives us is the same 

508
00:35:35,181 --> 00:35:37,650
thing.
That can cause a problem also,

509
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:43,410
you've got a conflict and absolutely,
absolutely.

510
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:47,670
The thing about any religious myths,
for example,

511
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,533
myths of the fall state fundamentally 
that the development of self 

512
00:35:52,221 --> 00:35:57,221
consciousness which is associated with 
tremendous expansion of cortical ability

513
00:35:57,631 --> 00:36:02,631
plus the ability to model the self as an
object precipitated that catastrophe and

514
00:36:02,821 --> 00:36:06,750
emotional catastrophe,
but the cure for the catastrophe is more

515
00:36:06,751 --> 00:36:09,270
of the same disease,
right?

516
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:13,380
So it's the problem is that a little 
self consciousness is terrible.

517
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:18,210
A lot however,
might might be redemptive and that's the

518
00:36:18,211 --> 00:36:19,044
notion that underlies,
that underlies all sorts of redemptive 

519
00:36:21,691 --> 00:36:22,524
mythologies and that's the notion that's
underlying the argument that I'm trying 

520
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:29,451
to elaborate up today because if you 
know enough about yourself,

521
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,100
then the consequences of a of a narrow 
self consciousness can be removed.

522
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:36,031
And I would say,
well,

523
00:36:36,031 --> 00:36:40,050
what myths are trying to teach you as if
they're trying to teach you something,

524
00:36:40,051 --> 00:36:40,890
which they're really not.

525
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:41,461
I mean,
they're just,

526
00:36:41,461 --> 00:36:44,430
they're.
What they're trying to teach you is that

527
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,220
your normal conception of who you are is
much too narrow.

528
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:51,563
Now you know at some level you know 
that's true because you're modeling 

529
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:55,123
yourselves wrong obviously because 
you're too complex for yourself 

530
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,913
tomorrow.
It's like no one thinks that they have 

531
00:37:02,581 --> 00:37:03,414
an accurate model of cosmological 
processes and it's certainly arguable 

532
00:37:07,801 --> 00:37:12,801
that the processes that make up each of 
us as individuals are complex at a level

533
00:37:14,071 --> 00:37:14,904
that's exponentially greater than any 
cosmological process that we could 

534
00:37:18,001 --> 00:37:18,834
possibly conceive of.
So the notion that your model of 

535
00:37:21,511 --> 00:37:24,270
yourself is inaccurate.
That's just a statement of fact.

536
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:26,363
The part that's not so factual is how 
you can get valid information to 

537
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:30,414
increase the breadth of that model.
What I'm basically trying to point out 

538
00:37:34,111 --> 00:37:36,660
is that mid you can do that is with 
Amanda,

539
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,513
is a large part,
is our accumulated attempt to construct 

540
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:45,570
a story that accounts for our behavior 
in the world.

541
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,260
We watch ourselves act and derive 
conclusions.

542
00:37:49,261 --> 00:37:54,261
As a consequence,
your entire life is a lie and everything

543
00:37:56,491 --> 00:37:58,800
bad that happens to you,
even though you recognize it,

544
00:37:58,801 --> 00:37:59,634
it's bad and you're miserable
outside cause I never resigned with 

545
00:38:04,381 --> 00:38:06,140
yourself.
What?

546
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,073
What?
What's intrinsically rewarding about 

547
00:38:08,971 --> 00:38:09,804
lying to yourself?
If you know that you're making yourself 

548
00:38:11,191 --> 00:38:12,024
miserable because look,
any defined terror is better than any 

549
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:21,330
undefined terror because it defined 
terror has a boundary and an undefined.

550
00:38:21,331 --> 00:38:23,160
Tara has none,
and that's the law.

551
00:38:23,161 --> 00:38:23,994
Here's an example.
There's been some reliable studies of 

552
00:38:26,581 --> 00:38:27,414
late that indicate that gay men who 
engage in high risk behavior for aids 

553
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:38,260
are less anxious after being diagnosed 
with aids than they were before

554
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:44,170
because the possibility the possibility 
is worse than the actuality.

555
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,590
No matter how bad the actuality is,
possibility is worse.

556
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:50,630
So what about if your product because of
pride and not fear,

557
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:51,150
like if

558
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:51,983
it's just.
I think those that that's always the 

559
00:38:53,111 --> 00:38:54,820
case as far as I've been able to 
determine.

560
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:55,963
It's not.
That's why I said you can't say this is 

561
00:38:57,401 --> 00:39:00,640
just one thing.
These things conglomorate together,

562
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:01,743
but people that I've dealt with who were
severely neurotic enough so that their 

563
00:39:05,141 --> 00:39:09,820
whole life was a lie and literally it 
was pride as well that was stopping them

564
00:39:09,821 --> 00:39:11,860
from letting go.
They wouldn't say,

565
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,430
well look,
you understand?

566
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:14,373
For example,
he treated one patient who had an 

567
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,140
obsessional neurosis that lasted 20 
years.

568
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:21,303
He said,
I cannot reconcile myself to the fact 

569
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,633
that I wasted two years.
So you think of what that admission 

570
00:39:29,321 --> 00:39:32,300
requires.
You know,

571
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,900
you have a finite time and if you've 
blown,

572
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:37,120
not only have you blown out a big chunk 
of it,

573
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:41,920
but in the course of blowing it out you,
you've added to the cumulative misery of

574
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,080
the world.
You know,

575
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:43,914
lots of people who are non physically,
physiologically unhealthy use their 

576
00:39:49,601 --> 00:39:53,770
neurotic misery to manipulate others 
around them to their own ends,

577
00:39:53,771 --> 00:39:57,220
to make people feel guilty,
to get them to do what they want because

578
00:39:57,221 --> 00:39:58,750
they don't think they can just come 
right out and say,

579
00:39:58,751 --> 00:39:59,920
you know,
would you please do this?

580
00:39:59,921 --> 00:40:04,180
They have to manifest some sign of 
weakness so that they force other people

581
00:40:04,181 --> 00:40:05,014
to take care of.
All of that has to come up and be 

582
00:40:07,061 --> 00:40:09,640
admitted before you can step away from 
this situation.

583
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:11,503
What was Satan afraid of eternity like 
you had nothing more to lose everything 

584
00:40:16,171 --> 00:40:17,460
to gain because it,
sorry.

585
00:40:17,461 --> 00:40:20,130
Groups and gets gotten sucked back into 
heaven.

586
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,140
Like where did pride become fear for 
Satan in paradise lost.

587
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,510
I can't answer.
I don't know.

588
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,600
Like I don't know enough to answer that 
question specifically.

589
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:32,310
I mean,
the only thing I can,

590
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,383
the only thing I can say about that is 
that these processes feedback onto one 

591
00:40:36,541 --> 00:40:36,820
another.

592
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,730
I mean

593
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,720
the more low.
Okay,

594
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,180
let me go through this argument to some 
degree and maybe it'll.

595
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,490
Maybe it'll shed a little bit of light 
on that question.

596
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:47,823
Okay.

597
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:49,913
What happens?
What's the consequence of injection of 

598
00:40:52,021 --> 00:40:56,070
air?
While we know that before you can engage

599
00:40:56,071 --> 00:40:56,904
in any sort of creative exploration,
you have to at least admit that 

600
00:40:58,651 --> 00:41:00,900
something went wrong and so you say,
well,

601
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,960
there's something wrong with my and let 
some level of analysis.

602
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,033
That's the admission.
Then the next process is to engage in 

603
00:41:07,261 --> 00:41:08,094
some sort of creative exploration,
which is basically the generation of 

604
00:41:10,291 --> 00:41:14,790
hypothesis and they're testing.
You find out you made someone upset,

605
00:41:14,791 --> 00:41:15,830
for example,
accidentally,

606
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,730
well then you think,
well,

607
00:41:17,731 --> 00:41:18,564
maybe this was wrong with my approach,
and then we talked to them first about 

608
00:41:20,731 --> 00:41:21,930
that.
See if that was right in.

609
00:41:21,931 --> 00:41:23,300
If that wasn't,
throw it out.

610
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,143
Hypothesis to side.
Pick up another one and act it out and 

611
00:41:26,521 --> 00:41:30,210
see if you get the information you want,
so on and so forth to get the answer and

612
00:41:30,211 --> 00:41:32,220
let's create an exploration.

613
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:32,721
Say,
well,

614
00:41:32,721 --> 00:41:35,180
what happens as a consequence of 
creative exploration?

615
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,030
Well,
look,

616
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:43,120
remember we talked about symbols of the 
chaos that existed prior to the creation

617
00:41:44,931 --> 00:41:46,160
of the world,
so to speak.

618
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,353
That chaos was symbolized by the dragon 
as a general rule is composed of the 

619
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:55,190
union of all things that are now often 
it's the source of all things,

620
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:57,530
not just objects,
but subjects as well.

621
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,440
So it's everything that we see as 
distinct,

622
00:42:00,441 --> 00:42:04,010
melded into some paradoxical unity,
and that stands for the unknown.

623
00:42:04,011 --> 00:42:06,140
As such.
Now Piaget said,

624
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:07,963
when children that children construct 
themselves as a consequence of their 

625
00:42:11,751 --> 00:42:12,584
creative exploration,
which basically means that the child 

626
00:42:15,531 --> 00:42:19,040
doesn't know anything about the world,
it's a very bounded domain of knowledge.

627
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,720
What it does is encountered the vast,
I've known explore,

628
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:25,363
generate information,
and now that information constructs 

629
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:29,023
itself as a subject which means grants 
itself a self and also the world as an 

630
00:42:33,841 --> 00:42:34,820
objective reality.

631
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:38,180
So that's what the notion that chaos 
also contains.

632
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:39,014
The subject means that as you gathering 
like you build yourself out of the 

633
00:42:43,641 --> 00:42:46,340
information you generated in the process
of exploration,

634
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:50,300
have you stopped exploring?
Although that has obvious conclusions,

635
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:52,640
it doesn't.
It means you start building yourself.

636
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:54,083
We already know that a system that stops
growing because everything around the 

637
00:42:58,281 --> 00:43:01,220
system changes of its own accord decays 
over time,

638
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,233
and we know what the decay means.
He's life comes to a standstill and the 

639
00:43:06,201 --> 00:43:08,990
negative forces that are underneath 
order rise up.

640
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:12,660
So that story basically says,
reject anomaly.

641
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,480
Personality stops developing.
Then you're in the kingdom that's coming

642
00:43:17,481 --> 00:43:19,790
to a standstill where everything's 
paralyzed.

643
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,070
There's no water and everything's dying.
Well,

644
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:22,904
what that means is that the mere fact of
not progressing means that you go 

645
00:43:27,711 --> 00:43:32,000
backwards and your life becomes well as 
those debt,

646
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,130
a desert,
nothing grows in the desert.

647
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:39,530
Everything's unbearable there.
So you say if you reject the possibility

648
00:43:39,531 --> 00:43:40,364
of growth,
what necessarily occurs is that all 

649
00:43:43,731 --> 00:43:47,210
that's left for you is a life that gets 
worse and worse and worse,

650
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,140
worse,
worse.

651
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:51,140
Now,
if your life goes from bad to worse,

652
00:43:51,141 --> 00:43:56,141
over time,
we know already.

653
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:59,210
This is just addresses the comment you 
made last week.

654
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,750
You punish an animal,
you make me.

655
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,150
That's one way of making meaning 
anyways.

656
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:06,403
If you construct your relationship with 
the world such that over time the 

657
00:44:11,031 --> 00:44:13,850
likelihood is that everything will go 
from bad to worse.

658
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:17,800
The other consequences of that is that 
your attitude towards you existing Cisco

659
00:44:17,801 --> 00:44:20,310
and go from bad to worse as well,
saying,

660
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:21,203
well,
why do people are people consumed with 

661
00:44:23,001 --> 00:44:23,834
hatred and a desire for revenge,
which has played out completely milk 

662
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,473
story.

663
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:37,010
Once Satan determines that admission of 
error is completely out of the question,

664
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:42,270
he turns his attention to taking revenge
on existence.

665
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,093
I'm trying to trying to provide an 
explanation for why that's a necessary 

666
00:44:46,661 --> 00:44:47,494
consequence of this because if you stop,
if you eliminate a priority and 

667
00:44:53,171 --> 00:44:54,004
necessity for further deny yourself the 
possibility of positive change and 

668
00:44:57,201 --> 00:44:58,034
adaptation,
the necessary consequence of that is 

669
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:02,120
increased personal,
suffered,

670
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:06,780
and that it's a very likely given that 
you're narrowing your personality,

671
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:09,660
which means you get weaker and weaker is
very,

672
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:10,523
very likely under those circumstances 
that you're going to become more and 

673
00:45:13,501 --> 00:45:14,334
more full of revenge because life's so 
unfair after all and hatred because 

674
00:45:18,601 --> 00:45:21,120
you're always being tortured even though
you're doing it to yourself.

675
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:22,333
We the rationalization is why do all 
these terrible things constantly happen 

676
00:45:26,981 --> 00:45:27,814
to me?
It must either be that everyone's 

677
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:33,990
against me.
This is a perfectly common hypothesis,

678
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:39,000
or the conditions of existence itself 
are so unbearable that everything should

679
00:45:39,001 --> 00:45:41,760
be eradicated,
which as we talked about last week,

680
00:45:41,761 --> 00:45:42,594
is the essential.
That's the essential Credo 

681
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:45,810
Mephistopheles,
right?

682
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:46,643
The world is so intrinsically so 
unbearable that the only proper course 

683
00:45:50,851 --> 00:45:52,590
of action is to work for it.
So elimination.

684
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:57,270
How last week I tried to tie that into 
stalins reasoning.

685
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:58,770
Basically.
Yes,

686
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,633
that's what it looks to me like.
That was the philosophy that 

687
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:05,490
characterizes step.
Everyone's against me,

688
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,310
that's for sure.
He was a real paranoid

689
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:10,673
and he worked throughout his life to 
continually develop his capacity to 

690
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,640
destroy larger and larger swaths of 
people.

691
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,260
I don't think there's much difference 
really.

692
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:35,490
See,
I think like this is not always the case

693
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:38,640
because suicide is motivated by all 
sorts of different reasons,

694
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,073
but it's certainly the case and I said I
think this is particularly true about 

695
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,440
adolescent suicide is that it's an act 
of revenge because.

696
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:47,663
Well it and it also is an illustration 
of how deep the motivation for revenge 

697
00:46:51,001 --> 00:46:51,834
can be because adolescents,
suicidal fantasies are often go along 

698
00:46:55,321 --> 00:46:59,040
the lines of old.
All those people be sorry when I'm gone,

699
00:46:59,041 --> 00:46:59,874
and then there's a whole fantasy about 
how the funeral rule progress in all 

700
00:47:01,951 --> 00:47:02,784
these people who paid in sufficient 
attention or being otherwise cruel will 

701
00:47:05,731 --> 00:47:07,910
file by and think about all the terrible
things they did.

702
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:09,023
So on and so forth.
And while the truth of the truth of the 

703
00:47:11,221 --> 00:47:12,054
matter is that a suicide leaves a hole 
in a community that can be reconciled 

704
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:16,973
because the people who are leftover are 
always faced with the question of why 

705
00:47:19,981 --> 00:47:20,670
did this happen?

706
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,560
And also what could I have done about 
it,

707
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:24,720
both of which are essentially 
unanswerable.

708
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:26,243
So
the question that you're posing to some 

709
00:47:29,141 --> 00:47:29,974
degree,
this is one murder worse than a million 

710
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:32,673
for it.
And I would say that they don't some in 

711
00:47:35,861 --> 00:47:36,694
a sense just as just as you are,
society is predicated on the idea that 

712
00:47:42,101 --> 00:47:45,850
every individual is of incalculable 
worth when you can't.

713
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:47,283
One thing of incalculable worth is worth
as much as 20 things of incalculable 

714
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:52,840
work.
So it's not.

715
00:47:52,841 --> 00:47:54,220
It's not an additive.
Phenomenal.

716
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,870
Sorry,
I think you were saying sort of thing.

717
00:47:57,150 --> 00:48:02,150
The vengeful aspect motivates both.
The Newman Newman conceptualized suicide

718
00:48:03,311 --> 00:48:06,400
is he felt that was the mythological 
explaining.

719
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:10,420
Explination was regressive wish for 
incest with the great mother,

720
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:15,900
which is a very awkward way of saying,
if only I was gone,

721
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,890
if only I banished back to the point 
that I had come from.

722
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:21,993
Then all of these problems that I'm 
faced with would just disappear and 

723
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:30,560
that's also something that's character 
and newman imagined that to census,

724
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:36,340
an attractive force pulling someone down
below the earth,

725
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:41,920
so that's just a desire for death as a,
as a solution to the problems of life.

726
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,560
You can also say these things are 
complicated.

727
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:49,690
Maybe you can also say that you thought 
that the collective unconscious produced

728
00:48:49,691 --> 00:48:50,524
conference Satori fantasies,
which basically meant that if your 

729
00:48:52,751 --> 00:48:54,160
conscious mind,
so to speak,

730
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:58,420
which was in part,
your linguistically constructed itself,

731
00:48:58,690 --> 00:48:59,523
was failing to take certain 
possibilities into account than the 

732
00:49:02,651 --> 00:49:03,484
collective unconscious,
which you might think about as 

733
00:49:04,781 --> 00:49:07,780
manifesting itself in fantasies that you
really can't control.

734
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,720
It just pop up like fantasies of death.
For example.

735
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:12,423
Often,
although they may have a pathological 

736
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:15,453
aspect,
they also hold out at least in 

737
00:49:16,991 --> 00:49:19,780
possibility the seeds of a cure because 
you could say,

738
00:49:19,781 --> 00:49:21,220
well,
if you were here

739
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:28,280
and you're convinced that this is 
unbearable,

740
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:29,683
the notion that a death is necessary is 
a first order attempt to hypothesize 

741
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:37,743
that the thing that constrains your 
interpretation of meaning should 

742
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,073
disappear.
Which is to say that the fact that your 

743
00:49:45,141 --> 00:49:50,141
life has become so twisted that you 
regard it as unbearable is evidence that

744
00:49:50,961 --> 00:49:54,020
your motive interpretation is so 
outdated that it should die.

745
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:57,010
No,
that's a perfectly reasonable answer.

746
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:59,240
Sacrificial Motif for,
and I read the other day,

747
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,250
I didn't know this,
that the idea of sacrificing of fingers,

748
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,320
very common throughout our camp 
mythology.

749
00:50:06,321 --> 00:50:10,640
I didn't know that my finger is 
something that's very important.

750
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:14,900
That's the same idea as a sacrifice of a
virgin sacrifice of heroes.

751
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:19,220
That if things are unbearable,
you either have to kill what's making it

752
00:50:19,221 --> 00:50:21,860
unbearable so that something new can 
come into being.

753
00:50:21,861 --> 00:50:24,020
That's one mode of the sacrificial 
hometeam,

754
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:25,183
but the other thing is is another thing 
that underlies the sacrificial is the 

755
00:50:27,831 --> 00:50:30,560
idea of the exposure of the hero to the 
forces of the unknown.

756
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:33,160
That's great.
That's another segment

757
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,720
on that diagram.
Just one.

758
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:41,470
It doesn't matter.
You know,

759
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:45,420
basically we about suicide.
It's like returning to the source of,

760
00:50:45,421 --> 00:50:47,350
all right,
turn into the world,

761
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:48,460
right?
Because that,

762
00:50:48,461 --> 00:50:52,430
that unconscious chaos that precedes 
existence has a paradise aspect,

763
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:53,283
right?
Because there's no tension of opposites 

764
00:50:54,401 --> 00:50:55,234
there,
which basically means there's just no 

765
00:50:56,321 --> 00:50:57,154
being at all,
but which could be a relief knew under 

766
00:51:00,461 --> 00:51:01,470
certain conditions.
So

767
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:04,410
is that it?
I'm just saying within that framework,

768
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,333
is that.
Would you say that's heading into chaos 

769
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:11,930
or is that going back a long time?

770
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:13,041
Well,
it depends.

771
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:16,850
You see,
if you move from border,

772
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:19,610
like where's,
where's the source of all things?

773
00:51:19,611 --> 00:51:21,440
Where's the break?
Can we put the great mother?

774
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,150
Yeah,
sure,

775
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,340
sure.
No problem.

776
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:29,450
This is anomalous information here.
So you say,

777
00:51:29,451 --> 00:51:31,820
well,
chaos is not known as such.

778
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:35,630
He never encountered that because you 
always encounter things that are more or

779
00:51:35,631 --> 00:51:36,464
less within a determinant framework.
You never see what you don't understand 

780
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:40,804
and its entirety,
or maybe that occurs to people who are 

781
00:51:42,561 --> 00:51:43,394
having some sort of mystical experience.
Mostly what you see are things that you 

782
00:51:47,751 --> 00:51:51,950
can somewhat define that pop up in your 
day to day experience.

783
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:52,933
Those are actual anomalous pieces of 
information that you have some 

784
00:51:55,521 --> 00:51:58,070
definitional handle on what the great 
mother would be.

785
00:51:58,071 --> 00:52:03,071
The story
you can think of,

786
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:04,244
the great mother as the agent of chaos,
which is a perfectly reasonable the way 

787
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:09,410
look at it because in the mythological 
progression,

788
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:12,050
she's the first offs right there.
Okay,

789
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:13,173
good.
The original chaos separates into the 

790
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,860
great mother in the grateful on.
Alright,

791
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:20,900
so she is the first child of chaos.

792
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,140
Subset essentially of class.

793
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:25,593
She's the form of the form.
That chaos takes in your actual 

794
00:52:28,121 --> 00:52:28,954
experience.
So wouldn't it be more effort in that 

795
00:52:31,391 --> 00:52:32,224
diagram to say the chaos there is really
the great mother because what do you 

796
00:52:36,161 --> 00:52:38,430
start going back?
Well,

797
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:39,323
you have talking about that.
That's where the entire diagram comes 

798
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:44,400
from because that's the world split into
it's conduct.

799
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:45,263
It's complicated because for example,
many figures of the great mother have a 

800
00:52:48,101 --> 00:52:49,900
snake wrapped around.
Well,

801
00:52:49,901 --> 00:52:50,734
that's because the.
The association between the Dragon of 

802
00:52:53,171 --> 00:52:55,270
chaos in the great mother is very,
very close.

803
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:58,510
So to say this is the great mother is 
true,

804
00:52:58,511 --> 00:53:01,480
but it's not just that.
It's also the origin of the great father

805
00:53:01,481 --> 00:53:02,314
and also the origin of the hero.
So the mythological figures are 

806
00:53:06,221 --> 00:53:09,250
contaminated by each other because 
they're north tight category,

807
00:53:09,310 --> 00:53:12,130
so lots of like the Gorgon is another 
example.

808
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:14,710
Great mother.
Her hair is snakes,

809
00:53:14,711 --> 00:53:18,250
which is representative of chaos.
Now when you look at her,

810
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,640
you turned to stone,
which means be terrified.

811
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,540
So she's an agent of chaos.
But chaos is more like that.

812
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:26,693
That first order category is more than 
just the kind of normally that you 

813
00:53:30,691 --> 00:53:33,660
encountered during your day to day life.
It's the source of everything.

814
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,320
So it's outside the whole process.

815
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:41,850
Okay.
I was just saying,

816
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:45,090
I mean I know that this symbol is mesh 
together on that level,

817
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:45,924
but if we're,
if we're bringing them into a more 

818
00:53:47,341 --> 00:53:48,730
systematic framework,
yeah.

819
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:54,260
Then to to kill yourself,
you will eliminate the self entirely.

820
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:59,940
It would essentially be to send yourself
into if you're nothing,

821
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:01,680
what,
where everything came.

822
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:02,460
Right?
Right.

823
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:05,160
Exactly.
So which is somewhat different from what

824
00:54:05,161 --> 00:54:05,994
you encounter if that.
If that is the diagram of the way we 

825
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:10,230
encountered life,
then

826
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:12,773
I would say that the things that make 
you desire a return to nothingness are 

827
00:54:17,791 --> 00:54:18,624
the the actual anomalous phenomenon,
threatening for the women that you've 

828
00:54:21,661 --> 00:54:24,090
encountered,
like the sum total of all of them.

829
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:25,373
So it's repeated appearances of 
intolerable information produced within 

830
00:54:30,311 --> 00:54:32,820
you.
The desire to advantage basically.

831
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:36,780
So
anyways,

832
00:54:36,781 --> 00:54:38,670
the fingers,
the fingers are contaminated.

833
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:40,980
That's why time at,
for example,

834
00:54:40,981 --> 00:54:43,440
in the,
in the Mesopotamian myth,

835
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:44,880
I mean absolute.

836
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,570
He's known in the Mesopotamian myth,
right?

837
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:50,640
The concert,
he gets very little press and that story

838
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:54,900
is not for lions devoted to you.
The gods killing your stupid me,

839
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:57,680
and of course the anti map rises up,
right?

840
00:54:57,690 --> 00:54:59,460
Because he's the thing that protected 
them,

841
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:01,373
but that's all that's known about.
Hammerhead timeout is female and the 

842
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:09,660
wife of absent and the mother of Marta,
but she's also the serpent,

843
00:55:09,661 --> 00:55:11,130
the mindset,
the bottom of the ocean.

844
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:13,590
That's the mother of everything,
the source of everything.

845
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,710
So there you can see the overlap between
the mythological domain.

846
00:55:17,711 --> 00:55:18,960
She's female,
but she's also.

847
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,790
She lives at the bottom of the ocean.
So

848
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:24,963
derive is a notion of what suicide was 
based on the fantasies for people who 

849
00:55:28,441 --> 00:55:29,274
may come down to commit suicide or did 
he just follow a train of reasoning to 

850
00:55:33,541 --> 00:55:34,374
decide that suicide was designed for?
I don't know that I don't know the 

851
00:55:39,781 --> 00:55:41,460
details of the conclusion he came to.

852
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:42,383
He wasn't practicing therapist.
Is it possible he got so excited about 

853
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:49,830
the system that he was pulling together?
Sure.

854
00:55:49,831 --> 00:55:51,640
That's always possible.
That's all.

855
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:53,850
It's just,
it's more a story.

856
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:56,100
It's more a way of looking at the 
situation.

857
00:55:56,101 --> 00:55:56,934
Maybe it's not.
It's not unreasonable to suppose that 

858
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:01,643
people who commit suicide,
wish for the cessation of their 

859
00:56:03,631 --> 00:56:07,740
experience been since.
That's what suicide producers as well as

860
00:56:07,741 --> 00:56:08,574
a lot of general,
a lot of misery on the part of people 

861
00:56:10,141 --> 00:56:12,480
left behind one of the like there's the 
psychoanalytic,

862
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:16,610
this is a human Erickson actually a 
okay.

863
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:18,300
If you can't tell what motivates that 
behavior,

864
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:22,410
look at the effects.
The effects are the are motivated.

865
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:25,000
How you can say that's a pretty extreme 
position.

866
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,313
It is an extreme position,
but they'll tell you if your partner of 

867
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:29,223
your own life that produces very 
interesting consequences at least as a 

868
00:56:31,331 --> 00:56:31,840
heuristic.

869
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,310
Like you can say,
no,

870
00:56:33,311 --> 00:56:34,990
that's not always true.
Fine.

871
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:36,213
It's not always true,
but if you do something and it has a 

872
00:56:39,311 --> 00:56:40,990
certain effect and you say,
well,

873
00:56:40,991 --> 00:56:43,870
I didn't intend that effect and you ask 
why did I do that?

874
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:49,240
A first order hypothesis.
The hypothesis is I did intend that,

875
00:56:49,241 --> 00:56:50,074
but I didn't know.
And if you follow that line of 

876
00:56:52,331 --> 00:56:53,220
reasoning,
if you can,

877
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:57,670
well it can have some have very salutary
effects,

878
00:56:57,671 --> 00:56:58,504
especially if the thing that you didn't 
intend has happened like two or three 

879
00:57:01,271 --> 00:57:02,104
times because then it's.
There's some indication that of 

880
00:57:04,691 --> 00:57:06,400
complicity.
It's only one occurrence.

881
00:57:06,401 --> 00:57:07,150
Well,
you know,

882
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:09,310
mistakes happen,
but if it keeps happening to you.

883
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:13,900
Lucky I think the other state was,
if it's pointing a gun at you,

884
00:57:13,901 --> 00:57:14,734
it's likely that it wants to shoot the 
same sort of idea and that was in 

885
00:57:17,711 --> 00:57:18,990
reference to the Cold War.

886
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:22,090
Why were people conspiring to build 
weapons,

887
00:57:22,091 --> 00:57:22,924
to destroy the world?
While the simple maybe too simple 

888
00:57:25,571 --> 00:57:28,870
explanation is on some level that was 
the intent,

889
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:32,440
but I buy that argument was certainly 
appeared to be 10th.

890
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:34,660
I mean,
he was practicing it all the time.

891
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:38,230
Now the question is how much was that?
The intent of the West?

892
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:40,360
Well,
that's not an answerable yet,

893
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,433
but I would suspect to a large degree,
does that apply to other people's 

894
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,530
behavior?
Well,

895
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:50,230
it's dangerous to apply it to other 
people's behavior,

896
00:57:50,231 --> 00:57:54,160
but
it isn't the principal that I rely on as

897
00:57:54,161 --> 00:57:58,120
an absolute explanation,
but it's a useful hypothesis.

898
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:01,090
Especially like I said,
the same thing keeps happening.

899
00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:03,550
See you,
Elizabeth.

900
00:58:03,551 --> 00:58:04,450
You made the point,
you know,

901
00:58:04,451 --> 00:58:08,830
neurotic people will find themselves 
trapped in in misery that they recognize

902
00:58:08,831 --> 00:58:11,530
clearly is misery without stepping 
outside of it,

903
00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:12,703
and I would say well that that fact 
indicates that they prefer the misery 

904
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:22,020
they have to the possibilities and they 
don't have to.

905
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:23,303
It's the only way to explain.
It's not the only way to explain 

906
00:58:26,111 --> 00:58:26,944
anything,
but it's one way of accounting for the 

907
00:58:28,601 --> 00:58:29,434
fact of resistance in psychotherapy,
the underground where the point is made 

908
00:58:35,071 --> 00:58:38,110
that separate is fun.
It gets attention.

909
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:39,520
That's,
that's,

910
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,353
that's the secondary gain hypothesis.
That's it's an effective manipulative 

911
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:49,500
strategy has all sorts of self 
reinforcing a side effects.

912
00:58:51,311 --> 00:58:52,144
I mean that's why it occurs.
Rejection of anomalies is very 

913
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:57,580
negatively reinforcing.
That's one of the reasons why it's while

914
00:58:57,581 --> 00:58:58,414
it has this attracted aspect,
so if you don't attend to all those 

915
00:59:03,161 --> 00:59:05,080
things that indicate that you're in 
error,

916
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:08,590
I mean to the degree that you're 
successful and no one attending to them,

917
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,420
you're not anxious,
you're not depressed,

918
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:12,250
you're not confused,
you know,

919
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:13,533
but the problem is all that information 
that you don't process first of all 

920
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,333
isn't transformed by you into something 
usable and second bull as far as I've 

921
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:22,880
been able to tell.

922
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:23,713
It accumulates over time and then what 
happens to you is that in a year are 

923
00:59:27,561 --> 00:59:30,980
getting smaller and smaller just because
that's the way things work.

924
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:35,930
Basically if you stagnate,
you get sicker and sicker and the things

925
00:59:35,931 --> 00:59:36,764
that you yourself have labeled as 
threatening because when you refuse to 

926
00:59:40,251 --> 00:59:41,084
process something,
what you're saying or what you're doing 

927
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:47,780
is that thing is terrible for me to 
contemplate.

928
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:53,130
So what you're doing is transforming 
chunks of the world into the category of

929
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:56,203
those things that are too terrifying to 
come to conflict or you're leaving them 

930
00:59:58,911 --> 00:59:59,744
in that category,
which is a more accurate way of looking 

931
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:05,780
at it.
Sooner or later you're this high and the

932
01:00:05,781 --> 01:00:09,350
world that you've transformed into 
threat is everywhere around you and it's

933
01:00:09,351 --> 01:00:10,184
only a matter of time until you're weak 
enough so that the whole thing falls in 

934
01:00:12,951 --> 01:00:13,310
on you.

935
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:14,143
Is there a difference between ignoring 
it and just interpreting it in such a 

936
01:00:17,181 --> 01:00:18,014
way like the positive bias but don't 
know where nothing was ever your fault 

937
01:00:20,451 --> 01:00:23,300
and like you're the martyr.
Like anything bad that happens to you is

938
01:00:23,301 --> 01:00:25,070
because there's some evil force out 
there that we're.

939
01:00:25,071 --> 01:00:25,904
You're kind of taking it in,
only putting such a spin on it that 

940
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:30,860
you're saying,
here's this unknown thing.

941
01:00:30,861 --> 01:00:31,694
I'm making it known,
but labeling it wrong on purpose that 

942
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:35,100
way.

943
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,200
Well,
that's just a.

944
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:40,170
that's just a variant of the same theme,
but it accumulates well,

945
01:00:40,171 --> 01:00:42,810
but I think
it's a.

946
01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:45,120
it's a.
it's a feedback mechanism.

947
01:00:45,121 --> 01:00:46,970
That's right.
There's a feedback mechanism at work,

948
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:52,460
so you get smaller and smaller.
You a new mislabeled the problem or.

949
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:53,453
Well,
actually I think really what you're 

950
01:00:54,091 --> 01:00:54,924
doing is that you're not pulling the 
label off it because we already know 

951
01:00:57,511 --> 01:01:00,450
that anomalous information manifests 
itself is threat.

952
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:01,583
It's right.
That's how your right frontal cortex 

953
01:01:03,151 --> 01:01:03,984
works.
Basically mistake comes up in the form 

954
01:01:06,571 --> 01:01:09,900
of threat.
That's how it's indicated on them,

955
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:10,793
so it's already labeled as threat.
Your job when you explore is to 

956
01:01:15,090 --> 01:01:19,370
transform the threat into something 
irrelevant or something beneficial north

957
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:21,270
to merely label it as something 
different,

958
01:01:21,271 --> 01:01:22,104
but to actually change it by altering 
your behavior into something that's 

959
01:01:24,631 --> 01:01:26,940
usable.
If you don't do that well,

960
01:01:26,941 --> 01:01:31,941
then what's happening is that the 
determinant world transforms itself back

961
01:01:32,551 --> 01:01:37,551
into terrifying chaos and you're just 
failing to stop that from happening.

962
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:41,220
It'll do that all by itself,
but by labeling it an evil force,

963
01:01:41,221 --> 01:01:42,054
you've made an effort to get rid of 
forest and everybody making it even 

964
01:01:45,491 --> 01:01:46,200
more.
That's true.

965
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,300
That's certainly at least worse for 
others,

966
01:01:48,301 --> 01:01:49,330
and I would say,
well,

967
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:51,960
yes,
yes.

968
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:52,831
Oh,
that's right.

969
01:01:52,831 --> 01:01:53,664
I mean,
but there's more motivation to that 

970
01:01:55,890 --> 01:02:00,480
because as you're weakening yourself and
your hatred for life grows,

971
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,433
your desire for revenge accelerates.
So then if you could take the next step 

972
01:02:04,441 --> 01:02:05,251
and say,
well,

973
01:02:05,251 --> 01:02:07,680
not only is this anomalous information 
intolerable,

974
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:09,600
but it's evil,
then I can kill it.

975
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:10,463
Well then you've got everything set 
because you can remove the source of 

976
01:02:12,451 --> 01:02:13,284
your trouble.
You can act out your hostile fantasies 

977
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:19,680
and you can feel justified because 
you're patriotic or which is all

978
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:22,013
rubbish.

979
01:02:22,590 --> 01:02:23,111
Um,
yeah.

980
01:02:23,111 --> 01:02:23,561
It's like,
no,

981
01:02:23,561 --> 01:02:24,394
you're talking about stuff and the world
is so terrible that it must be 

982
01:02:27,551 --> 01:02:28,384
destroyed.
Is it possible to distinguish that from 

983
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:33,970
like the world is so terribly fascism of
it must be destroyed,

984
01:02:33,971 --> 01:02:34,570
are?

985
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:35,403
Yes,
I would say.

986
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,510
Sure.
Absolutely.

987
01:02:36,511 --> 01:02:39,530
That's distinguishable because one of 
the hallmarks of the hero,

988
01:02:39,531 --> 01:02:40,364
and this is something that the night I 
was at pains to outline in the latter 

989
01:02:43,501 --> 01:02:46,590
part of the manuscript is the hero has 
two functions.

990
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:49,650
One is to transfer,
transform,

991
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:50,693
unexplored territory into explored 
territory which is just Marta battle 

992
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:54,983
against time,
but also to update the social structure 

993
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:03,780
which has both manifested internally and
externally as that becomes necessary,

994
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:05,363
so the pro.
Now we know the problem with updating a 

995
01:03:08,101 --> 01:03:13,101
social structure is that sometimes that 
takes on a revolutionary aspect and then

996
01:03:13,471 --> 01:03:14,304
for all the adherence of that social 
structure who were either going and 

997
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:17,833
forest revolution,
that heroic activity is going to seem 

998
01:03:19,951 --> 01:03:20,784
like a demonic demonic force and that's 
why people are so irritated inheritance 

999
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:27,600
because they pop up the normalist 
information and for good reason.

1000
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:28,463
I mean careless hermeticism is very,
very dangerous because it produces 

1001
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:34,320
schismatic activity and break societies 
down,

1002
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:35,633
but it also,
it's like a genetic mutation that's the 

1003
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:39,960
best.
That's the best metaphor.

1004
01:03:39,961 --> 01:03:44,961
I know it's like a 999 revolutions are 
counterproductive,

1005
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:48,470
but the one revolution in the thousand 
dollars isn't counterproductive,

1006
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,313
is absolutely necessary and the problem 
is how do you distinguish between the 

1007
01:03:52,861 --> 01:03:53,880
two?
I mean,

1008
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,073
if you just use the odds,
the first thing you'd say is all 

1009
01:03:57,841 --> 01:04:02,100
revolutionary shouldn't be regarded.
The skepticism like extreme skepticism,

1010
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:03,323
but not skepticism to the point where a 
priority they should be eliminated 

1011
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:08,150
because one of them just quite the.
Well,

1012
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:09,270
it just might be the hero.

1013
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:15,300
So
I,

1014
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:18,993
I'm,
I'm still trying to translate what 

1015
01:04:22,031 --> 01:04:22,864
you're talking about into sort of a 
parallel framework and what I was just 

1016
01:04:27,191 --> 01:04:31,060
thinking of is there might be two ways 
to change the social system.

1017
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:34,540
One by coming back as a caring,
advocating.

1018
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:35,973
Okay.
The way things should be telling people 

1019
01:04:37,031 --> 01:04:38,990
what beliefs you're placing,
they have.

1020
01:04:39,330 --> 01:04:42,070
The other thing is to come back changed,
right?

1021
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:42,820
Right,
right.

1022
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:43,520
Then with.
Yes.

1023
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,353
Yeah.
And then your relationships with other 

1024
01:04:44,671 --> 01:04:46,160
people change.
Well that's,

1025
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:48,810
that's,
that's the sort of the sort of path that

1026
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:50,060
the.
Well,

1027
01:04:50,061 --> 01:04:54,000
that I want to outline in more detail 
next week because one,

1028
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:54,903
I think one,
one piece of evidence that should 

1029
01:04:57,870 --> 01:04:58,703
justify skepticism is the overt desire 
of the revolutionary to maintain their 

1030
01:05:03,511 --> 01:05:04,344
position at all cost and to transport 
everyone around them because then you 

1031
01:05:07,961 --> 01:05:10,200
think,
was that revolution or is that,

1032
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:12,450
is that fascism masquerading as 
revelation?

1033
01:05:12,451 --> 01:05:15,600
Which it almost always is.
So like a communist ideologue,

1034
01:05:15,601 --> 01:05:17,590
he wants to transform a capitalist 
society.

1035
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:22,150
Isn't the revolutionary just he's just a
fascist on the left wing.

1036
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:23,733
There's no heroism map,
but I guess I suppose the other thing 

1037
01:05:26,231 --> 01:05:31,180
that one might be skeptical of his 
revolutionaries in groups because that's

1038
01:05:31,181 --> 01:05:33,860
sort of a contradiction in terms,
right?

1039
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:39,600
So not always for either of those,
but that's still a sign I would say,

1040
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:43,750
but I think that the notion of coming 
back change,

1041
01:05:43,751 --> 01:05:44,584
that's the issues.
I think what these myths are trying to 

1042
01:05:47,621 --> 01:05:52,621
point out is that the only permanently 
effective form of social revolution is a

1043
01:05:54,281 --> 01:05:55,114
personal revolution and then just acts 
itself out where that social change is 

1044
01:05:59,471 --> 01:06:01,990
just a necessary consequence of that 
personal change.

1045
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:06,310
It isn't something that's being enforced
or even planned out to a degree.

1046
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:10,430
It's just
let me know.

1047
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:11,350
That strikes me,
is

1048
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:15,310
that what strikes me as a justifiable 
position,

1049
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:16,413
at least then you're also much less 
likely to make catastrophic errors 

1050
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:23,680
because your primary concern is always,
what am I doing wrong?

1051
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:26,730
Or here's the situation,
how am I contributing to it?

1052
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:28,550
Not,
you know,

1053
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:31,270
where are all the bad people?
Who are really causing more trouble,

1054
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:36,000
so I mean I knew lots of this is kind of
a sarcastic comment I guess,

1055
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:37,103
and I knew lots of environmental 
activists in graduate school who may be 

1056
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:40,500
filthy apartments.

1057
01:06:41,150 --> 01:06:41,983
It's like they couldn't even keep their 
personal territory clean and yet they 

1058
01:06:45,461 --> 01:06:49,090
were willing to engage in activities 
that in terms of their own fantasies,

1059
01:06:49,091 --> 01:06:52,690
had the potential impact of 
restructuring society.

1060
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,050
Practice what you preach.
Well,

1061
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:57,700
at least.
Yeah.

1062
01:06:57,701 --> 01:07:01,750
At least at least act it out so that you
can see on your own territory,

1063
01:07:01,930 --> 01:07:03,330
one if it works,
and two,

1064
01:07:03,331 --> 01:07:07,930
if you can actually even acted out.
So the thing is,

1065
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:10,840
while you know there's a lot nip,
funny mythological statements,

1066
01:07:10,841 --> 01:07:13,780
like the man who rules himself is,
has,

1067
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:16,480
has a.
I don't know the quote precisely.

1068
01:07:16,481 --> 01:07:17,314
The man who rose himself has performed a
more difficult task than the man who 

1069
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:20,374
wrote the city.

1070
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:26,530
It's hard to rule a city,
but what it means is it is actually.

1071
01:07:26,531 --> 01:07:30,490
The truth is you're much more 
complicated phenomenon than a city.

1072
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:34,960
And to bring yourself under some sort of
control is much more difficult than.

1073
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:37,453
It's more difficult than bringing the 
given social structure under control 

1074
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:43,410
because the social structure assemble,
Harrison plus,

1075
01:07:43,411 --> 01:07:44,244
it's also equivalent to bringing in 
social structure and control because 

1076
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:52,600
what you're composed of in large part is
the sum total of social structures.

1077
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:55,480
Now they as they be generated over a 
neck stretches of time,

1078
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:57,160
so inside you,
for example,

1079
01:07:57,161 --> 01:07:59,410
like if you want to reconcile the 
abortion debate,

1080
01:07:59,770 --> 01:08:01,840
that's an internal reconciliation as 
well.

1081
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:05,620
You have to rethink the philosophical 
presuppositions

1082
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:08,133
sufficiently deep enough so that you 
come to a solution that brings the two 

1083
01:08:10,871 --> 01:08:13,030
sides together.
That can hold,

1084
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:15,060
take place inside before it takes place 
outside.

1085
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:18,350
Go past it
at some level.

1086
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:22,210
The most powerful social movements bring
these two things together.

1087
01:08:22,610 --> 01:08:23,443
I'm like the,
I'm not drinking in the early days of 

1088
01:08:27,911 --> 01:08:28,744
solidarity,
which is one of the things that really 

1089
01:08:29,981 --> 01:08:33,460
impressed me about it.
It was the way it translated to,

1090
01:08:33,630 --> 01:08:34,463
of personal transformation or the way in
which the civil rights movement evolved 

1091
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:43,000
in this country requiring a personal 
change,

1092
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:46,660
uh,
which was through it in a collective way

1093
01:08:47,260 --> 01:08:50,410
created social change or in the women's 
movement.

1094
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:51,970
I mean,
in other words,

1095
01:08:51,971 --> 01:08:55,150
it seems like in these genuine social 
movements,

1096
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:58,150
change occurs both in the macro and 
micro level.

1097
01:08:58,151 --> 01:09:01,390
They're brought in consonance with one 
another.

1098
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:02,201
Well,
I mean,

1099
01:09:02,201 --> 01:09:03,034
that's,
that strikes me at least as a plausible 

1100
01:09:04,331 --> 01:09:06,130
hypothesis,
you know,

1101
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:07,180
um,
I remember,

1102
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:08,920
um,
George Orwell,

1103
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:10,120
right?
He was,

1104
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:12,640
he started out as a socialist 
ideologically,

1105
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:14,230
but then,
well,

1106
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:15,303
one of the things that transformed him 
from a mere idea log into a writer of 

1107
01:09:18,311 --> 01:09:21,610
note and a political commentator of note
was that he decided,

1108
01:09:21,611 --> 01:09:24,220
he,
he noted that in his experience,

1109
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:27,940
most academic socialists weren't all 
that fond of the poor.

1110
01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:30,910
This was particularly true in Britain 
where there a higher class structure,

1111
01:09:30,911 --> 01:09:31,744
so they were from the upper classes and 
acted out there detests than the lower 

1112
01:09:35,711 --> 01:09:36,544
classes in all their action patterns 
while holding the ideological belief 

1113
01:09:39,611 --> 01:09:42,130
that the poor were in fact,
morally superior.

1114
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:43,720
Somewhat.
Orwell did was,

1115
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:46,450
well,
he went to Paris and London and lived in

1116
01:09:46,451 --> 01:09:51,451
Paris among dishwashers and in in Great 
Britain among traps and coal miners,

1117
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:57,430
forcing himself to overcome what he soon
recognized was a very deep set prejudice

1118
01:09:57,431 --> 01:10:01,070
against everything that the poor 
represented well.

1119
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:01,943
Then what happened to her well was he 
dropped his socialism very rapidly 

1120
01:10:04,271 --> 01:10:05,104
because he found that the ideological 
structure was nowhere near profound 

1121
01:10:08,891 --> 01:10:11,020
enough to encompass what he'd 
experienced.

1122
01:10:11,021 --> 01:10:14,560
Plus it had enormously dangerous side 
effects,

1123
01:10:14,561 --> 01:10:17,800
which he increasingly came to recognize.
So maybe,

1124
01:10:17,801 --> 01:10:18,634
I mean maybe that's a.
maybe that's because one of the things 

1125
01:10:20,561 --> 01:10:21,394
that everyone would like to figure out 
is like how do you distinguish a 

1126
01:10:24,731 --> 01:10:27,490
pathological revolution from a valid 
revolution?

1127
01:10:28,030 --> 01:10:32,830
And I mean I would say if you're asking 
someone else to bear more of the costs,

1128
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:35,660
then you're actually bearing.
Then that's one sign that it's.

1129
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:37,960
That there's some sort of pathology at 
the bottom of it,

1130
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:39,633
who knows,
but that seems like a reasonable first 

1131
01:10:41,561 --> 01:10:46,561
approximation.
So I guess you also have to see like who

1132
01:10:46,661 --> 01:10:47,494
gets what out of it?
The communist revolution as far as I've 

1133
01:10:51,301 --> 01:10:52,134
been able to determine,
just replaced one tyrannical group that 

1134
01:10:56,381 --> 01:10:57,214
at least we're,
we're bound by tradition with another 

1135
01:11:00,101 --> 01:11:04,370
tyrannical group that were completely 
unbound by tradition and,

1136
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:08,410
and even more tyrannical
because the problem was,

1137
01:11:08,411 --> 01:11:11,680
is that
the only reason

1138
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:14,203
the Russian revolutionaries were more 
moral than the tsar was because they 

1139
01:11:16,801 --> 01:11:19,860
didn't have any power.
They couldn't do anything.

1140
01:11:19,861 --> 01:11:22,460
So when they look to themselves more,
I'm harmless.

1141
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:23,850
I mean,
I've put anybody in prison.

1142
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:28,940
Of course they don't have a prison,
but when they got prisons they certainly

1143
01:11:29,221 --> 01:11:30,280
put lots of people.
Hang on.

1144
01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:35,550
So
what other comments,

1145
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:38,693
Daniel?
No.

1146
01:11:38,930 --> 01:11:39,763
Okay.
So

1147
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:43,651
yeah.
Okay.

1148
01:11:43,651 --> 01:11:47,220
So we basically got to this point in the
argument now,

1149
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:52,080
which you doing?
Oh,

1150
01:11:52,081 --> 01:11:54,770
I'm just outlining this argument so that
I don't forget where I am.

1151
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:58,770
Basically it goes like this over here.

1152
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:02,343
Okay.
So the question is how to get out of 

1153
01:12:05,551 --> 01:12:09,730
this.
I mean,

1154
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:12,270
if we're willing to take nature,
if notion seriously,

1155
01:12:12,271 --> 01:12:15,630
which is that everyone has sufficient 
reason to lie.

1156
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:19,710
Then the question is,
given that as a premise,

1157
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:24,660
the conclusion is perhaps to a much 
larger degree than we believe.

1158
01:12:24,661 --> 01:12:26,400
We're lying to ourselves.
Now,

1159
01:12:27,090 --> 01:12:28,710
one of the thing,
shelley Taylor,

1160
01:12:28,711 --> 01:12:29,544
she's the social psychologist who's been
promoting this positive self delusion 

1161
01:12:33,570 --> 01:12:35,880
notion.
One of the valuable things she's done,

1162
01:12:35,881 --> 01:12:39,000
I think was although I don't think she 
drew the right conclusion from it,

1163
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:40,193
was that she noted that many people who 
we regard as normal and healthy in fact 

1164
01:12:46,801 --> 01:12:49,920
erect around themselves,
barriers of positive illusions.

1165
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:55,670
Now she drew from that the conclusion 
that to be normal and healthy,

1166
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:58,920
well first of all,
the normal people were healthy,

1167
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,260
which is.
I have a real problem with that,

1168
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:03,240
but I mean you can see.

1169
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:04,073
You can see how that necessarily emerges
as a consequence of psychological 

1170
01:13:06,511 --> 01:13:07,344
methodology in a sense because okay,
I made the argument to begin within the 

1171
01:13:12,361 --> 01:13:15,750
class that as soon as you apply a field 
like psychology or medicine,

1172
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:17,183
you're out of the domain of science and 
into the domain of morality because you 

1173
01:13:19,501 --> 01:13:23,850
have to make judgments about what 
constitutes the good if you have to now,

1174
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:27,000
but people who are in the domain of 
science don't like to admit that,

1175
01:13:27,001 --> 01:13:27,834
so they try to figure out ways to 
determine what's moral scientifically 

1176
01:13:30,391 --> 01:13:31,920
without ever having to address the 
problem.

1177
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,720
And the easiest way to do that is by 
saying,

1178
01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:35,820
well,
here's the normal distribution,

1179
01:13:36,230 --> 01:13:39,630
right?
The optimal level is the midpoint.

1180
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:43,320
So you take the average person,
you see how many positive sell solutions

1181
01:13:43,321 --> 01:13:45,390
they have around.
When you say those average people,

1182
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:47,580
they're normal.
That defines healthy.

1183
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:50,340
Therefore positive self lesions are 
necessary,

1184
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:54,030
but this is like this is a real problem 
because first of all,

1185
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:56,300
many things that are average,
we don't consider ideal.

1186
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:59,150
I mean that's why the two words exist in
opposition.

1187
01:13:59,350 --> 01:14:03,300
It was like we know strive for average 
intelligence or average athletic ability

1188
01:14:03,301 --> 01:14:06,090
or average beauty or average 
accomplishment at any level.

1189
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:09,270
We're always moving towards some sort of
ideal anyway,

1190
01:14:09,271 --> 01:14:13,450
so I think shelley Taylor got caught and
trapped in a sense she got caught in her

1191
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:15,890
own unconscious presuppositions and 
said,

1192
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:18,820
well,
normal people have to be healthy.

1193
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:19,654
By definition,
normal people have lost a part of the 

1194
01:14:21,221 --> 01:14:22,360
self illusions.
Therefore,

1195
01:14:22,361 --> 01:14:26,740
positive self lesions are necessary.
There's lots of flaws in that argument.

1196
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:28,193
I buy the argument that many people who 
are considered normal by normal 

1197
01:14:32,711 --> 01:14:37,150
standards erect barriers of self 
positive illusions around themselves,

1198
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:38,253
but the fact that they do that as no 
indication whatsoever that is necessary 

1199
01:14:41,621 --> 01:14:42,454
or desirable because the argument that 
I've been trying to outline this whole 

1200
01:14:45,401 --> 01:14:46,234
course is that
to the degree that the members of the 

1201
01:14:49,511 --> 01:14:50,344
society,
to the degree that a member or members 

1202
01:14:52,541 --> 01:14:53,374
of a society erect positive self 
illusions around themselves to protect 

1203
01:14:57,161 --> 01:15:00,400
their normality,
they will make their group pathological.

1204
01:15:00,910 --> 01:15:01,743
Pathological it gets.
The more likely it is to do something 

1205
01:15:04,241 --> 01:15:05,230
terrible.
Other groups,

1206
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,030
the sickness is going to come out 
somewhere.

1207
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:12,813
Our target,
our timescale analysis in psychology is 

1208
01:15:14,871 --> 01:15:17,300
something really,
but we don't ever question.

1209
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:18,453
It was like,
you know,

1210
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:22,760
a given phenomenon can have a beneficial
effect at

1211
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:28,100
at the level of analysis of a minute,
a detrimental effect.

1212
01:15:28,101 --> 01:15:30,380
If you look at its effect over the 
course of a day,

1213
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:31,613
I'm mildly beneficial effect.
If you look at it over the course of a 

1214
01:15:33,441 --> 01:15:35,810
week,
you know tremendously detrimental effect

1215
01:15:35,811 --> 01:15:36,644
if you look at it over the course of a 
year in the same thing can have all 

1216
01:15:39,381 --> 01:15:40,214
sorts of different effects depending on 
your parameters of evaluation and 

1217
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:46,550
generally psychologists pick one 
parameter evaluation and say,

1218
01:15:46,551 --> 01:15:47,384
well,
that's representative of the whole 

1219
01:15:48,291 --> 01:15:52,190
temporal framework and that's just.
It's not a justifiable conclusion.

1220
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:53,373
Say people who are high in self 
deception may appear more psychological 

1221
01:15:58,311 --> 01:16:00,650
help psychologically healthy in the 
short term.

1222
01:16:00,830 --> 01:16:05,360
If you define psychological health as 
the absence of anxiety and depression in

1223
01:16:05,361 --> 01:16:06,194
the short term,
but you don't know anything about what 

1224
01:16:07,881 --> 01:16:09,650
that means for their interpersonal 
behavior.

1225
01:16:09,950 --> 01:16:11,600
You don't know anything about what that 
means.

1226
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:12,493
You don't know anything about what that 
means for the course of their lifespan 

1227
01:16:14,981 --> 01:16:15,814
or for the children.
You have no idea what it means for the 

1228
01:16:17,541 --> 01:16:20,000
relationships with the group or between 
groups,

1229
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:21,073
so until you answer all those questions,
you know you have to be pretty careful 

1230
01:16:23,091 --> 01:16:23,924
about saying about making it as radical 
acclaim as self deception is necessary 

1231
01:16:29,301 --> 01:16:30,134
for psychological.

1232
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:35,670
Can we ask what types of self deception?
Well,

1233
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:41,750
shelley tailoring,
Jonathan Brown.

1234
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:43,583
My understanding is that these are the 
types of things that come from making 

1235
01:16:47,261 --> 01:16:49,680
down comparisons.
So I'm.

1236
01:16:50,130 --> 01:16:51,220
I'm better than average.

1237
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:54,141
Yeah.
She said,

1238
01:16:54,141 --> 01:16:55,490
she says those are innocuous,

1239
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:56,860
right?
Right.

1240
01:16:56,861 --> 01:16:59,350
That's my understanding.
So when asked,

1241
01:16:59,351 --> 01:17:00,161
for example,
with you,

1242
01:17:00,161 --> 01:17:02,560
ask people to read their ability on the 
multitude of trades.

1243
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:04,450
If everybody in this room rated 
themselves,

1244
01:17:04,451 --> 01:17:05,284
we'd all,
the whole group as a whole would be 

1245
01:17:06,701 --> 01:17:08,910
above average,
above average.

1246
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:11,000
This is a positive illegitimate.

1247
01:17:11,070 --> 01:17:14,940
Thanks Garrison in Wisconsin where every
child is above average,

1248
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:15,913
right?

1249
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:17,550
That's true.
But we can't.

1250
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:19,300
We can't by definition I'll be above 
that.

1251
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:22,410
So that sort of definition of positive 
illusions,

1252
01:17:24,420 --> 01:17:25,253
but isn't it sort of a leap to go from 
that type of positive allusion to self 

1253
01:17:29,581 --> 01:17:34,581
deception that could have
the content of which has to do with your

1254
01:17:35,041 --> 01:17:35,874
relationships with other people in the 
truths about the world and in all kinds 

1255
01:17:38,341 --> 01:17:39,340
of other things being where's.

1256
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:41,733
Well it isn't relief because called in 
the rewalk has just finished a study on 

1257
01:17:44,531 --> 01:17:47,710
people who are high in self deception 
and found that over the course of a five

1258
01:17:47,711 --> 01:17:48,544
year period,
those very people were in fact rated by 

1259
01:17:51,521 --> 01:17:52,354
their peers as much more dislikable 
ended more psychological troubles than 

1260
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:56,270
people who are lonely.
So

1261
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:57,343
self deception the same as his.
The people who were thinking that they 

1262
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:02,440
above average or are these the same 
things?

1263
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:05,623
In other words,
it self deception question sort of self 

1264
01:18:08,961 --> 01:18:11,030
perception would be the denial of 
information.

1265
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:12,750
Positive illusion would be,

1266
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:13,733
yeah,
that hasn't.

1267
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:16,980
That hasn't been completely sorted out 
because what if you told this person?

1268
01:18:16,981 --> 01:18:18,420
No,
the truth is you are at

1269
01:18:19,450 --> 01:18:22,230
and they accepted it.
In other words,

1270
01:18:22,231 --> 01:18:23,970
it seems to me that they're looking 
slightly different.

1271
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:25,093
Well,
like I said in the literature as as a 

1272
01:18:26,631 --> 01:18:27,464
whole that hasn't been sorted out.
Even like where we're using one of the 

1273
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:33,540
inventories of self deception in our lab
right now,

1274
01:18:33,541 --> 01:18:35,810
the trend is sort some of this element.
It's got different.

1275
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:40,010
It's one scale with different factors,
sub categories,

1276
01:18:40,011 --> 01:18:40,844
one of which is self enhancement,
which would be more like I'm more than 

1277
01:18:43,221 --> 01:18:45,200
average and the other ones,
there's two others,

1278
01:18:45,201 --> 01:18:48,800
one of which has to do with the denial 
of negative information and maybe one of

1279
01:18:48,801 --> 01:18:49,940
those is more powerful,
logical,

1280
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:53,460
and maybe one isn't pathological level.
Although I wouldn't bet on,

1281
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:55,063
but I don't know for sure.
I'm just really the difference because 

1282
01:18:57,021 --> 01:18:57,854
if you say that I.
If you suggest that if you believe that 

1283
01:19:00,141 --> 01:19:00,974
you are better than you are,
then that means you're not going to 

1284
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:05,690
believe you need to fix.
One of the things that we did with this,

1285
01:19:05,691 --> 01:19:06,524
by the way,
we've done an experiment with this 

1286
01:19:07,851 --> 01:19:09,310
questionnaire and we found that people 
who are.

1287
01:19:09,910 --> 01:19:12,800
He gives these people standard tests of 
psychological health.

1288
01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:16,340
Well you can't tell because they might 
be lying because they lie after all,

1289
01:19:16,570 --> 01:19:19,670
neurotic.
Let's say they're not

1290
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:23,210
neurotic,
so what we did was we took,

1291
01:19:23,211 --> 01:19:24,044
we took people,
we looked at your tendency to self 

1292
01:19:25,431 --> 01:19:28,190
enhanced,
we divided them into high sulfur and low

1293
01:19:28,191 --> 01:19:29,024
sulfur enhances.
Then we gave them 20 photographs to 

1294
01:19:31,011 --> 01:19:31,844
rate.
We use the neo five factor personality 

1295
01:19:33,910 --> 01:19:37,490
more to see how they would rate other 
people who were just.

1296
01:19:37,790 --> 01:19:38,623
We took a census cross section of race 
and niche and then we call and we used 

1297
01:19:43,251 --> 01:19:44,084
five new adjectives per picture and I 
collapsed them all together to kind of 

1298
01:19:46,971 --> 01:19:47,804
get their average,
their average personality influential 

1299
01:19:51,561 --> 01:19:52,394
more,
which is imagine you force all those 

1300
01:19:55,370 --> 01:19:57,470
pictures together.
You get a competent individual,

1301
01:19:57,680 --> 01:19:59,570
plus you get a composite personality 
score.

1302
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:00,823
People high in self enhancement regard 
others as more negative because we put 

1303
01:20:06,321 --> 01:20:07,154
all the negative adjectives in one 
category and all the pauses and another 

1304
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:11,430
has more negative than they regard 
themselves,

1305
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:14,430
so I would say no,
there's no difference.

1306
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:16,343
The mechanism from the positive 
illusions is making downward 

1307
01:20:19,471 --> 01:20:21,630
comparisons,
which is exactly what these people did,

1308
01:20:21,970 --> 01:20:23,020
right?
Well,

1309
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:24,173
call it phone.
The people who do that are rated by 

1310
01:20:26,521 --> 01:20:29,770
their peers as less,
well,

1311
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:30,713
less socially as worse than people who 
don't over the long term short term 

1312
01:20:36,001 --> 01:20:38,170
advantages,
but that's neuroticism.

1313
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:40,440
That's short term advantage because 
that's where people do it.

1314
01:20:40,530 --> 01:20:43,830
People also tend to make a comparison to
when they have their sights set,

1315
01:20:44,350 --> 01:20:45,183
well this is something that Aaron is 
trying to work this out because she 

1316
01:20:47,251 --> 01:20:48,084
thinks that some of these,
these inventories of self deception are 

1317
01:20:52,051 --> 01:20:55,140
contaminated with optimism and I think 
she's right.

1318
01:20:55,141 --> 01:20:55,974
Is that optimistic?
People who think I can make the future 

1319
01:20:59,401 --> 01:21:02,940
brighter than probability says it is 
likely to be,

1320
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:03,953
which I think is a perfectly reasonable 
stance and is dependent on your ability 

1321
01:21:06,331 --> 01:21:07,164
to work.
She thinks those people get lumped 

1322
01:21:08,521 --> 01:21:09,354
together with the self deceivers proper 
because if they took as their reference 

1323
01:21:14,071 --> 01:21:18,510
group one level of accomplishment that I
think I can do better for myself.

1324
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:19,531
Right,
right.

1325
01:21:19,531 --> 01:21:22,560
Well a lot of this has to be pulled 
apart compared to their peers.

1326
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:23,940
Right?
Absolutely.

1327
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:27,030
I mean,
and it's not all that easy to pull out a

1328
01:21:27,031 --> 01:21:29,880
positive belief in the future and its 
possibilities from.

1329
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:32,790
I've already got that positive future 
now,

1330
01:21:32,791 --> 01:21:35,430
even though all the evidence suggests 
that the contrary is true,

1331
01:21:35,970 --> 01:21:39,750
so that's right.
A fantasy about how good things might be

1332
01:21:39,751 --> 01:21:43,920
is not necessarily pathological unless 
you presume that things are already that

1333
01:21:43,921 --> 01:21:44,731
way.
In fact,

1334
01:21:44,731 --> 01:21:45,564
you need it.
He needed a fantasy like that to keep 

1335
01:21:47,371 --> 01:21:48,990
you going ahead.
So

1336
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:56,010
which is exactly what we're talking 
about.

1337
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,890
Well,
here's another example.

1338
01:21:58,891 --> 01:21:59,724
We ran an experiment because we're very 
interested in this particular line of 

1339
01:22:02,971 --> 01:22:03,804
research because it contradicts 
everything that I'm trying to say in 

1340
01:22:05,131 --> 01:22:05,964
this course.
So that personally irritates me as well 

1341
01:22:09,841 --> 01:22:10,674
as I,
you know,

1342
01:22:12,090 --> 01:22:13,470
for all sorts of other reasons.

1343
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:14,573
I just can't believe that shelly 
Taylor's writing like 5,000 years of 

1344
01:22:17,970 --> 01:22:20,610
religious traditions gathered from all 
over the world are wrong.

1345
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:23,070
Just strikes me as highly unlikely.
Anyways,

1346
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:29,850
test that has been used to discriminate 
psychopaths from non psychopathic.

1347
01:22:29,851 --> 01:22:32,850
No.
So think about psychopaths is that while

1348
01:22:32,851 --> 01:22:35,070
they're not very pleasant to be around 
in the term,

1349
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:37,170
although superficially they can be very 
charming.

1350
01:22:37,710 --> 01:22:39,870
In fact,
they make a study of how to be charming.

1351
01:22:40,230 --> 01:22:41,063
In fact,
if you do group therapy with second 

1352
01:22:42,841 --> 01:22:45,240
perhaps,
which is very bad idea,

1353
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:46,613
they become more effective psychopaths 
because they pick up the whole 

1354
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:50,183
psychological vocabulary and an array of
professional techniques that they would 

1355
01:22:53,011 --> 01:22:55,800
never otherwise have access to.
So anyways,

1356
01:22:55,950 --> 01:23:00,510
they're not very anxious and depressed,
but they're also dangerous,

1357
01:23:00,830 --> 01:23:01,663
you know,
was a test that has been used to 

1358
01:23:02,701 --> 01:23:04,700
distinguish psychopaths from non second 
pass.

1359
01:23:04,940 --> 01:23:07,370
It's called the Newman card playing 
task.

1360
01:23:08,290 --> 01:23:11,650
Daniel computerized it up for use in 
this study.

1361
01:23:13,210 --> 01:23:17,450
It consists of an extinction paradigm.
None of you are going to take this.

1362
01:23:19,170 --> 01:23:21,670
You might
mean

1363
01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:27,520
well knowing it depends.
You can't take it.

1364
01:23:27,521 --> 01:23:28,354
If you listen to this,
you probably shouldn't take it anyways 

1365
01:23:29,831 --> 01:23:30,664
because he'd been in this course,
so you'll kind of know what the hell's 

1366
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:34,270
going on possibly.
So you wouldn't be a good subject.

1367
01:23:34,810 --> 01:23:38,180
Okay.
So stay out of my anyways.

1368
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:41,013
Anyway,
so.

1369
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:42,483
Okay,
so you have 100 cards and they're 

1370
01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:45,423
stacked.
The deck is staff and in the first deck 

1371
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:49,563
there's 10 cards and their face cards,
every time you turn around and face you 

1372
01:23:53,290 --> 01:23:54,770
get a quarter,
you start with someone,

1373
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,033
get a quarter,
and then in the next deck of 10 the 

1374
01:23:58,151 --> 01:23:58,984
subject doesn't know this one out of 10 
of the cars makes you lose randomly and 

1375
01:24:03,491 --> 01:24:06,040
in the next day,
two of the 10 make you news.

1376
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:07,023
Then three,
10,

1377
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:07,873
four,
10,

1378
01:24:07,950 --> 01:24:09,190
five,
and so on.

1379
01:24:09,191 --> 01:24:10,840
All the way until the end.
We're a 10 out of 10.

1380
01:24:10,841 --> 01:24:11,620
Make loose,
lose.

1381
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:13,600
Now the your instructions are.
Do you ever ring again?

1382
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:15,550
Nope.
It's an extinction paradigm.

1383
01:24:15,830 --> 01:24:16,663
So you mean the first time you went you 
went in for the first 50 percent of the 

1384
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:22,740
right because you went 10 times,
then you went nine.

1385
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:26,100
Then you have the
cards,

1386
01:24:26,170 --> 01:24:27,003
either winners or losers.
Now all you have to do is segway to 

1387
01:24:28,631 --> 01:24:29,464
stop.
Now the object is to maximize your 

1388
01:24:31,061 --> 01:24:32,110
money.
Obviously.

1389
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:33,393
Well,
high self deceivers make half as much 

1390
01:24:35,051 --> 01:24:38,830
money as low self to seniors because 
they don't know when to quit and I think

1391
01:24:38,831 --> 01:24:40,420
the reason they don't know when to quit 
is because

1392
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:46,110
losing is indication of error.
It's labeled with negative apnic.

1393
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:49,420
That's what stops you.
If you have essentially ignore all signs

1394
01:24:49,421 --> 01:24:50,254
of there.

1395
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:53,260
Well you're not gonna stop doing 
something stupid as fast as you should.

1396
01:24:53,650 --> 01:24:57,040
So anyways,
they make half as much money's low,

1397
01:24:57,041 --> 01:24:59,760
self deceived.
So wait,

1398
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:01,000
I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

1399
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:02,980
So they keep going longer than they 
should,

1400
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:04,233
but do you.
You start losing money or just stop 

1401
01:25:05,450 --> 01:25:08,000
winning every time.
One of these sort.

1402
01:25:08,001 --> 01:25:10,360
And maybe my explanation was confusing.
Yeah.

1403
01:25:10,390 --> 01:25:12,250
You either wait a quarter or lose a 
quarter.

1404
01:25:12,810 --> 01:25:14,440
That's right.
Right.

1405
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:18,770
So the ratio of wins,
two losses decreases over time

1406
01:25:20,590 --> 01:25:23,680
and you should stop somewhere in the 50 
slash 50 range,

1407
01:25:23,681 --> 01:25:24,514
right?
Or maybe a little after that because 

1408
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:27,070
whatever.
But somewhere around there,

1409
01:25:27,071 --> 01:25:27,904
when you're losing as often as you're 
winning and you can see the numbers 

1410
01:25:31,031 --> 01:25:33,790
total up on the screen and the quarters 
appear or disappear.

1411
01:25:34,270 --> 01:25:36,790
So you can tell when you hit the 
maximum.

1412
01:25:37,420 --> 01:25:41,680
So then that seems to be complicated 
with the optimism variable

1413
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:46,680
because if somebody just thinks,
well I'm just kidding,

1414
01:25:46,870 --> 01:25:47,703
keep going,
you know,

1415
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:49,840
well it's,
it's conceivable.

1416
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:50,673
It's like this is,
this is a hard thing to factor out and 

1417
01:25:51,870 --> 01:25:54,520
it's conceivable if it's contaminated by
optimism,

1418
01:25:54,521 --> 01:25:56,860
I would say that I'm to the 
circumstance.

1419
01:25:56,861 --> 01:26:00,880
So the test optimism is unwarranted past
a certain point.

1420
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:05,840
So to be up and you'd have to assume 
that isn't stacked and therefore it came

1421
01:26:05,841 --> 01:26:06,674
back.
But since the things that decreasing 

1422
01:26:07,220 --> 01:26:08,053
incrementally one by one and when you're
going to figure out pretty quickly that 

1423
01:26:10,071 --> 01:26:11,480
it was set up,
well,

1424
01:26:11,481 --> 01:26:12,121
yeah.
Well that's,

1425
01:26:12,121 --> 01:26:14,630
that's the hope is you figure it out.
That's right.

1426
01:26:14,730 --> 01:26:17,240
Stop in.
Lots of things in life are like that.

1427
01:26:17,241 --> 01:26:17,990
I mean,
you know,

1428
01:26:17,990 --> 01:26:21,590
to do something and it's working,
it's working and then it doesn't work so

1429
01:26:21,591 --> 01:26:23,730
well and then it works even less well 
than you know.

1430
01:26:23,780 --> 01:26:27,380
Sooner or later you should quit.
Now obviously that can be contaminated,

1431
01:26:27,381 --> 01:26:29,630
that fight persistence.
The other thing we get,

1432
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:32,690
and you have these people put their 
finger in a pain device,

1433
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:35,810
minor league paid device you need is 
just a.

1434
01:26:35,910 --> 01:26:36,743
it's just a lever.
It's kinda about a sharp dull butter 

1435
01:26:40,611 --> 01:26:43,370
knife and it sits on your finger and 
there's weights on it.

1436
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,100
When you first put your thing and you 
can take it off whenever you want,

1437
01:26:46,101 --> 01:26:48,890
when you first put your finger in there,
it doesn't hurt at all,

1438
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:51,440
but the pressure,
some,

1439
01:26:51,850 --> 01:26:54,980
the pain detectors,
some of the pain and all always say is,

1440
01:26:54,981 --> 01:26:57,680
well tell us when this hurts.
So people are looking at it.

1441
01:26:58,220 --> 01:26:58,671
Oh,
it hurts.

1442
01:26:58,671 --> 01:26:59,504
Now we also say,
take your finger out when a reasonable 

1443
01:27:01,101 --> 01:27:02,950
person would do so.
So you know,

1444
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:05,670
they usually stayed there for about 30 
seconds or so and then they say,

1445
01:27:05,671 --> 01:27:06,021
well,
you know,

1446
01:27:06,021 --> 01:27:08,480
that's enough.
It's completely harmless,

1447
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:12,710
but the high self esteem is stay in 
there longer than the most up to now you

1448
01:27:12,711 --> 01:27:14,660
might say,
well they're persistent.

1449
01:27:14,890 --> 01:27:17,120
Well they are.
They are persistent and sometimes that's

1450
01:27:17,121 --> 01:27:20,030
good and it's hard to tell when it's not
good,

1451
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:21,530
but sometimes it's not good.

1452
01:27:21,530 --> 01:27:22,363
And I would say leaving your finger in a
laboratory pain device longer than 

1453
01:27:25,131 --> 01:27:27,100
average.
It's probably not good

1454
01:27:33,260 --> 01:27:37,110
at
immediate behavioral.

1455
01:27:38,450 --> 01:27:42,440
If you're optimistic and you have these 
far reaching goals that can be healthy.

1456
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:47,180
If you apply those in small,
like my immediate behavioral level,

1457
01:27:47,181 --> 01:27:48,014
things like this should have been 
behavioral like you're not supposed to 

1458
01:27:49,851 --> 01:27:51,040
figure out cognitively.
Okay.

1459
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:53,410
It's incremental.
Absolutely.

1460
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:58,100
They will never.
I mean by definition they're optimistic.

1461
01:27:58,101 --> 01:27:58,934
Sense is why?
Because unless you have the ability to 

1462
01:28:00,471 --> 01:28:03,990
adapt to the everyday information,
you can't learn and get.

1463
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:05,490
Right.
That's the yes.

1464
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:06,333
So that's,
that's a good explanation for the 

1465
01:28:08,110 --> 01:28:09,200
phenomenon.
The experiment.

1466
01:28:10,050 --> 01:28:12,460
It's not a definitive experiment by 
means,

1467
01:28:13,310 --> 01:28:17,120
but it's interesting because it even 
argues against the short term utility of

1468
01:28:17,630 --> 01:28:18,463
a failure to process the information 
that indicates that you're in here and 

1469
01:28:21,771 --> 01:28:25,340
it is linked to self deception since we 
use this self deception questionnaire.

1470
01:28:25,820 --> 01:28:27,000
So.
So you're,

1471
01:28:27,060 --> 01:28:30,770
you're putting the psychopathology of 
neuroticism with psychopathy?

1472
01:28:34,820 --> 01:28:35,710
Yes,
I guess so.

1473
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:41,890
I guess what I should say though,
having said that,

1474
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:42,793
is that
this doesn't mean that I don't believe 

1475
01:28:49,161 --> 01:28:49,994
that there are genetic predispositions 
to different forms of psychopathology 

1476
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:56,690
and it also,
it also doesn't mean that I believe that

1477
01:28:56,691 --> 01:28:59,270
everyone plays on the same field,
so to speak.

1478
01:28:59,660 --> 01:29:00,493
So it may be an if you say you have an 
extensive family history of 

1479
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:05,513
schizophrenia,
well that means that it's going to take 

1480
01:29:08,731 --> 01:29:09,564
a lot less to push you over the edge,
then it would a normal person and the 

1481
01:29:14,581 --> 01:29:16,650
fact that you've gone over the edge,
so to speak,

1482
01:29:16,651 --> 01:29:17,484
is not any indication necessarily that 
your moral character was any less than 

1483
01:29:21,121 --> 01:29:24,570
the next person's.
So the parameters of the game shift with

1484
01:29:25,050 --> 01:29:25,883
genetic and environmental context,
which is to say that I guess partly 

1485
01:29:30,180 --> 01:29:31,013
different people have different 
temptations and also different 

1486
01:29:32,731 --> 01:29:33,564
weaknesses and,
but I do think that there's a moral 

1487
01:29:37,771 --> 01:29:41,210
aspect to illness.
So

1488
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:46,980
no,
that's pretty troublesome.

1489
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:50,910
Okay.
Before we leave the,

1490
01:29:50,911 --> 01:29:53,170
uh,
tailor for Shelley Taylor hardcore,

1491
01:29:53,171 --> 01:29:54,004
real quick thing,
it's important to point out that what 

1492
01:29:55,231 --> 01:29:57,330
she actually says,
and it's been pointed out,

1493
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:58,233
I called the block.
Another critique is not the positive 

1494
01:30:00,151 --> 01:30:00,984
illusions are correlated mental health,
but positive illusions are correlated 

1495
01:30:03,711 --> 01:30:06,150
with the absence of depression and 
anxiety,

1496
01:30:06,630 --> 01:30:08,490
which is a very different thing.
Well,

1497
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:11,050
she takes the argument farther than that
because look,

1498
01:30:11,130 --> 01:30:11,963
she wrote a self help book for people 
telling them how to use positive self 

1499
01:30:15,221 --> 01:30:17,070
illusions to enhance the mental 
function.

1500
01:30:17,970 --> 01:30:18,803
So there she's extrapolating beyond the 
mere statement of absence of depression 

1501
01:30:24,811 --> 01:30:25,644
and anxiety,
which is not a statement I have a 

1502
01:30:26,641 --> 01:30:29,220
problem with because psychopaths for 
example,

1503
01:30:29,221 --> 01:30:32,850
or low in depression and anxiety,
it's taking the argument the next step.

1504
01:30:32,851 --> 01:30:33,990
That's the problem.
Right?

1505
01:30:34,430 --> 01:30:37,620
So,
so I do think she goes beyond just,

1506
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:38,593
well these,
these restricted forms of 

1507
01:30:40,801 --> 01:30:45,000
psychopathology are less frequent among 
people who are high in self deception.

1508
01:30:45,180 --> 01:30:47,430
That in itself is just an interesting 
phenomenon.

1509
01:30:47,850 --> 01:30:50,760
It's the next step.
It's sort of disturbs me.

1510
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:55,470
So is that so satisfying?
Yeah,

1511
01:30:55,471 --> 01:30:56,670
that's what I was saying.
Oh,

1512
01:30:56,671 --> 01:30:57,540
okay.
Okay.

1513
01:30:58,140 --> 01:30:58,800
Okay.
Sorry,

1514
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,790
I guess I misunderstood what you meant.

1515
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:06,350
That's cool.
Is it magical to have hope in the face?

1516
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:08,560
Like almost like hope against hope?

1517
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:11,290
Well this is,
this argument gets more complicated.

1518
01:31:11,300 --> 01:31:12,133
They're like,
one of the things that she's found is 

1519
01:31:14,171 --> 01:31:17,890
that people who say if you're diagnosed 
with intractable cancer,

1520
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:19,113
well she's found that people who 
overestimate their chance of survival 

1521
01:31:22,690 --> 01:31:25,840
live longer now this is,
this is tough.

1522
01:31:25,841 --> 01:31:26,680
I mean,
you know,

1523
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:29,800
that's the piece of her evidence that's 
really compelling,

1524
01:31:30,070 --> 01:31:34,030
but I would suggest,
and hopefully I can do more than suggest

1525
01:31:34,031 --> 01:31:37,870
at some point that that was because she 
has optimism.

1526
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:39,093
Her notion of self deception improperly 
incorporates this sort of optimism that 

1527
01:31:44,711 --> 01:31:45,610
we've been discussing.

1528
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:48,333
It doesn't.
That card there that I couldn't just be 

1529
01:31:49,351 --> 01:31:50,970
like,
I'm going to be one of the,

1530
01:31:51,030 --> 01:31:51,863
the psychopaths and play till the end 
because I keep hoping that the next car 

1531
01:31:54,421 --> 01:31:56,490
would be like the one that gives me a 
quarter.

1532
01:31:57,330 --> 01:31:58,950
I hope I'm not pathological.

1533
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:00,100
You don't

1534
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:02,310
know how you behave in the task either.
So you know,

1535
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:03,153
I wouldn't draw.
Don't draw inferences about your 

1536
01:32:04,721 --> 01:32:07,000
behavior in hypothetical because you 
don't know.

1537
01:32:07,210 --> 01:32:08,380
He might've stop.
Right?

1538
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:09,340
I mean,
I don't do either.

1539
01:32:09,341 --> 01:32:10,174
Maybe you would play around with the Eq,
but it's also possible that some of the 

1540
01:32:13,601 --> 01:32:15,370
people just didn't care about the damn 
quarters.

1541
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:20,700
Like the game,
thanks quarters to play the games at the

1542
01:32:20,701 --> 01:32:21,270
hurricane.

1543
01:32:21,270 --> 01:32:22,740
Awesome.
It's kind of a dog game.

1544
01:32:23,290 --> 01:32:25,200
We tell people you're supposed to win 
the money.

1545
01:32:25,201 --> 01:32:28,140
It's like proper behavior during this 
test is winning the money.

1546
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:30,270
So the goal is set.
So mean,

1547
01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:31,530
you know,
like I said,

1548
01:32:31,531 --> 01:32:32,364
it's not,
it's not,

1549
01:32:34,730 --> 01:32:38,220
it's not a definitive cakes.
So did you have,

1550
01:32:38,221 --> 01:32:39,240
did you have another college

1551
01:32:39,790 --> 01:32:43,650
I wanted to ask?
I'm talking about hope and,

1552
01:32:43,670 --> 01:32:44,470
and,
um,

1553
01:32:44,470 --> 01:32:46,760
anxiety and everything.
The words pride,

1554
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:48,550
fear,
hatred and revenge.

1555
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:53,060
What's the neuropsychological valence of
like rape,

1556
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,180
like fears,
you know,

1557
01:32:55,780 --> 01:32:57,880
activation of the right.

1558
01:32:59,290 --> 01:33:01,450
But what about pride in this?
So,

1559
01:33:01,610 --> 01:33:03,950
I don't know about this,
but the,

1560
01:33:04,090 --> 01:33:05,720
the,
the negative emotions,

1561
01:33:05,721 --> 01:33:06,830
they tend to clump,
right?

1562
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:09,110
If you look at the neuroticism scale of 
the Neil,

1563
01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:13,940
all negative emotional states are in the
same subscale.

1564
01:33:13,941 --> 01:33:16,430
Essentially.
Egg Anger for example,

1565
01:33:16,431 --> 01:33:19,190
correlates very highly with fear.
So,

1566
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:20,840
but we know the name

1567
01:33:21,020 --> 01:33:21,853
anger is activation of the left cortex.
And I was wondering if revenge might be 

1568
01:33:28,431 --> 01:33:29,420
the same way.
I mean,

1569
01:33:29,421 --> 01:33:33,340
it seems like there's an approach,
there's an approach aspect rather than,

1570
01:33:33,370 --> 01:33:34,950
uh,
rather than avoiding.

1571
01:33:35,430 --> 01:33:38,040
Yeah,
no,

1572
01:33:38,460 --> 01:33:39,580
that's a good point.
If I don't know,

1573
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:40,433
I don't know what we haven't.
We haven't progressed very far in the 

1574
01:33:43,021 --> 01:33:48,021
study of sorts of higher order emotions.
I don't know what the neuropsychological

1575
01:33:48,470 --> 01:33:51,840
mean as you.
Anger is not necessarily proactive,

1576
01:33:51,841 --> 01:33:54,540
but active aggression certainly seems to
involve approach,

1577
01:33:54,550 --> 01:33:55,383
but so
a lot of it may be in response to the 

1578
01:34:02,820 --> 01:34:03,653
become,
the farther you go in terms of overt 

1579
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:06,373
behavior,
the more complex it has to be from the 

1580
01:34:08,001 --> 01:34:10,730
original impression.
Okay.

1581
01:34:12,410 --> 01:34:13,243
Well this is just to say that fear is 
one of the fundamental responses that 

1582
01:34:19,581 --> 01:34:23,570
happens that happens instantly in the 
right frontal cortex,

1583
01:34:23,571 --> 01:34:24,404
but then as soon as you're getting into 
hatred and revenge or getting into 

1584
01:34:25,950 --> 01:34:26,783
plants,
secrets is naturally going to be 

1585
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:33,410
excavating systems in different systems 
to though that's a really good.

1586
01:34:33,411 --> 01:34:37,280
That's an astute comment because when 
you say aggression for example,

1587
01:34:37,370 --> 01:34:38,203
what you're saying is a word that 
contains 40 different categories of 

1588
01:34:41,001 --> 01:34:43,400
behavioral output because there's 
defensive aggression,

1589
01:34:43,730 --> 01:34:48,730
there's instrumental aggression,
anger just been just for starters,

1590
01:34:49,881 --> 01:34:52,800
there's aggression that's socially 
appropriate.

1591
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:54,650
There's aggression that's socially 
inappropriate.

1592
01:34:55,010 --> 01:34:57,470
There's aggression.
That's punishment elicited aggression.

1593
01:34:57,471 --> 01:34:58,304
That's fear elicited a aggression as a 
response to challenge to group identity 

1594
01:35:02,361 --> 01:35:04,910
and all those different things are under
the rubric of one word,

1595
01:35:04,911 --> 01:35:08,720
but as you point out involve activation 
of systems.

1596
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:12,350
It may be in complete opposition to one 
another at times.

1597
01:35:13,590 --> 01:35:17,640
It seems to to be something that like if
it seems to me,

1598
01:35:17,641 --> 01:35:18,474
if there's two totally different things 
in everyday life we call hope and one 

1599
01:35:20,771 --> 01:35:24,010
would be sort of equivalent to the hero 
and the other one would be equivalent to

1600
01:35:24,011 --> 01:35:28,600
like an over rigid identification with a
social structure because like if you say

1601
01:35:29,170 --> 01:35:32,020
you have hope in the future that that 
look can be the kind of thing that keeps

1602
01:35:32,021 --> 01:35:34,390
you looking for other alternatives and 
helps you find a way around.

1603
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:38,020
Messaging sort of motivates you forward 
into anomaly or whatever.

1604
01:35:38,021 --> 01:35:39,640
Like the hero to encounter the new 
information.

1605
01:35:39,910 --> 01:35:42,700
Or you can have a kind of thing that we 
don't distinguish.

1606
01:35:42,701 --> 01:35:46,570
We call it home too,
but it's the kind of thing where you say

1607
01:35:46,630 --> 01:35:50,120
it keeps you from finding a way around 
things because you say this one though,

1608
01:35:50,260 --> 01:35:51,093
I felt like faith because hope I think 
you can actually categorically defined 

1609
01:35:57,661 --> 01:35:58,494
hope in a sense,
and I would say hope is what you 

1610
01:36:00,781 --> 01:36:01,614
experienced as a consequence of the 
positive valence of an anomalous 

1611
01:36:04,651 --> 01:36:07,860
occurrence,
which is to say that you experienced the

1612
01:36:07,861 --> 01:36:08,694
effect of hope when you're faced with an
acute or satisfaction with an incentive 

1613
01:36:12,631 --> 01:36:13,464
reward and that accompanies activation 
left from the cortex is I think what 

1614
01:36:16,801 --> 01:36:17,634
you're talking about is this and you're.
I think you're making a distinction 

1615
01:36:19,771 --> 01:36:21,390
between blind faith,
which is,

1616
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:22,351
oh,
everything's gonna.

1617
01:36:22,351 --> 01:36:23,360
Turn out wonderful.
You know what?

1618
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:25,530
Even when the barbarians are at the 
gate,

1619
01:36:25,531 --> 01:36:27,720
so to speak,
and the faith that says,

1620
01:36:28,110 --> 01:36:28,943
no matter what comes up,
which means I know that things will 

1621
01:36:31,231 --> 01:36:32,064
transform.
I can deal with the transformations if 

1622
01:36:33,691 --> 01:36:37,350
my attitude is proper and it's certainly
the case that those two things can be.

1623
01:36:37,950 --> 01:36:40,280
One is adolescent phase.
That's nice.

1624
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:41,233
It's all my.
It isn't even faith in the sense its 

1625
01:36:43,891 --> 01:36:44,724
reliance on the group,
like if I followed with a group of 

1626
01:36:46,581 --> 01:36:49,590
maintained or protect me from those 
things I can control.

1627
01:36:49,630 --> 01:36:51,260
The other one is,
you know,

1628
01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:55,170
I know the world is a dynamic place.
There's something in me that can respond

1629
01:36:55,171 --> 01:36:57,420
to it.
That's like an absolutely.

1630
01:36:57,540 --> 01:37:02,100
I think that's the antithesis of the of 
the position that motivates the lock.

1631
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:03,383
It's also the case.
See what other questions are trying to 

1632
01:37:05,671 --> 01:37:09,870
answer is we know the group has it 
protected nature.

1633
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:16,220
That's also necessary,
but that can be pathologist,

1634
01:37:16,470 --> 01:37:17,303
so the question is given that the group 
is necessary that it's maintenance is 

1635
01:37:19,951 --> 01:37:20,784
necessary that people have to identify 
with how is it that the pathological 

1636
01:37:24,331 --> 01:37:27,990
aspect can be reduced and I would say to
the degree that you're able to move your

1637
01:37:27,991 --> 01:37:28,824
faith from blind reliance on the group 
to have your own capacity to address 

1638
01:37:32,731 --> 01:37:35,940
anomalous information and transform it 
into unexplored territory.

1639
01:37:36,270 --> 01:37:39,810
You're you to the degree that you're 
able to do that.

1640
01:37:39,811 --> 01:37:40,644
You can civil status when you're 
dependent ties on the group because you 

1641
01:37:44,011 --> 01:37:46,300
have this alternative standpoint.
That's great.

1642
01:37:46,350 --> 01:37:49,050
There's two ways.
There's two modes of protection from the

1643
01:37:49,051 --> 01:37:51,430
great unknown.
One is well,

1644
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:52,313
dad will do everything.
That's one way of looking at the other 

1645
01:37:55,060 --> 01:37:58,440
end as well.
No now saying can do everything,

1646
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:02,760
but if I'm willing to meet whatever 
happens when it happens,

1647
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:08,120
I can heighten the probability of 
success to to its highest possible level

1648
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:13,290
that works out because first of all,
you're always practicing and that's.

1649
01:38:13,291 --> 01:38:15,750
That's psychological hygiene as far as 
I'm concerned.

1650
01:38:15,950 --> 01:38:16,783
You know,
I think that's why so many religious 

1651
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:23,360
traditions concentrated on heightening 
attention to day to day processes,

1652
01:38:24,450 --> 01:38:25,283
so there's little bits of anomalous 
information are always cropping up in 

1653
01:38:27,871 --> 01:38:28,704
your interpersonal interaction to your 
professional work and everything that 

1654
01:38:31,771 --> 01:38:33,300
you do and if you.

1655
01:38:34,020 --> 01:38:34,853
If you learn how to respond to those 
normal occurrences that are relatively 

1656
01:38:38,581 --> 01:38:40,290
small,
well they're happening.

1657
01:38:40,590 --> 01:38:42,060
First of all,
you keep your personality,

1658
01:38:42,061 --> 01:38:42,894
how you practice knowing how to do it,
so you increase your confidence in 

1659
01:38:46,681 --> 01:38:47,514
yourself.
You decrease the amount of territory 

1660
01:38:50,011 --> 01:38:52,620
around you,
this contaminated by the unknown,

1661
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:56,970
and you increased the likelihood that 
when something really catastrophic comes

1662
01:38:56,971 --> 01:38:59,160
along that you'll make the right 
decision.

1663
01:38:59,850 --> 01:39:00,810
It's important,
you know,

1664
01:39:00,811 --> 01:39:04,980
because you see in places like Germany 
for example,

1665
01:39:05,130 --> 01:39:05,963
and certainly not uniquely all sorts of 
people who we might have hoped would 

1666
01:39:10,051 --> 01:39:10,884
have been more resistant to the Nazi 
ideology fell over like sheep when 

1667
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:20,040
paraded out the intellectual community 
seemed to have no better record than the

1668
01:39:20,251 --> 01:39:22,830
community at large in Germany.
So,

1669
01:39:25,750 --> 01:39:28,350
which,
which to me indicates that despite their

1670
01:39:28,351 --> 01:39:32,220
accumulation of facts,
there was no concentration whatsoever on

1671
01:39:32,221 --> 01:39:33,054
the development of character.
We can necessarily weakens the 

1672
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:36,833
resistance of that.

1673
01:39:41,570 --> 01:39:45,040
Um,
so I'm trying to think about what,

1674
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:45,933
how you can distinguish between the 
optimist and the psychopath and your 

1675
01:39:48,121 --> 01:39:51,010
experiments and what is used to be to 
me,

1676
01:39:51,011 --> 01:39:52,960
uh,
in my experience and my experience that,

1677
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:57,060
um,
or maybe at least from requirements that

1678
01:39:57,130 --> 01:40:02,130
the psychopath goes on ignoring threat.
But even while being punished,

1679
01:40:03,610 --> 01:40:04,443
I'm numb.
I'm trying to figure out if it's been 

1680
01:40:05,531 --> 01:40:07,600
punished by the known or unknown unknown
things.

1681
01:40:07,601 --> 01:40:10,150
Because when he sticks his finger in the
thing,

1682
01:40:10,151 --> 01:40:11,830
that's something that's known that it's 
going to hurt you.

1683
01:40:11,860 --> 01:40:13,520
You know,
they stick it in longer.

1684
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:15,520
That's what I'm trying to figure out.
The optimist,

1685
01:40:16,780 --> 01:40:21,780
I think ignores the red but does not 
keep going on when being punished

1686
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:24,760
by,
by the known or the unknown.

1687
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:26,421
I don't,
I don't,

1688
01:40:26,421 --> 01:40:27,590
I don't.
If it breaks down,

1689
01:40:27,890 --> 01:40:30,440
it breaks down that straightforwardly.
Payne.

1690
01:40:30,980 --> 01:40:31,813
I'm the optimist is someone I think 
who's willing to endure and voluntarily 

1691
01:40:36,801 --> 01:40:40,010
meet threatening conditions in order to 
attain their hand,

1692
01:40:40,250 --> 01:40:43,480
but who also modifies their behavior as 
a consequence of encountered.

1693
01:40:43,490 --> 01:40:46,460
That's,
that's the critical time is the optimist

1694
01:40:46,461 --> 01:40:48,170
is who's healthy is,
has,

1695
01:40:48,171 --> 01:40:50,600
uh,
an ideal that may even be impossible.

1696
01:40:50,750 --> 01:40:52,070
In fact,
I think in some ways,

1697
01:40:52,071 --> 01:40:55,540
if you don't have an impossible,
then your ideal is wrong.

1698
01:40:55,630 --> 01:41:00,630
It should always supersede your grass.
That's the whole point of an ideal.

1699
01:41:01,810 --> 01:41:05,350
It's something that as you approach it,
it receives but transforms you along the

1700
01:41:05,351 --> 01:41:06,820
way.
So you might say,

1701
01:41:06,821 --> 01:41:08,650
well,
that's a pathological fantasy consensus.

1702
01:41:08,710 --> 01:41:11,500
It can never be brought into existence,
but there's a difference between

1703
01:41:13,190 --> 01:41:14,023
your conception of the future as an 
ideal place and your and your belief 

1704
01:41:17,511 --> 01:41:18,344
that despite all evidence to the present
is that ideal place at least in so far 

1705
01:41:22,221 --> 01:41:23,480
as it's composed of you

1706
01:41:24,490 --> 01:41:27,090
art from all these other horrible people
that have been surrounded.

1707
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:28,683
So like the distinction between 
persistence and stubbornness or 

1708
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:36,520
hardheadedness or whatever.
I'm trying to understand the distinction

1709
01:41:36,521 --> 01:41:37,354
between a hope,
kind of hope necessarily report to risk 

1710
01:41:42,221 --> 01:41:44,440
action and optimism.

1711
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:45,891
Yeah.
Well,

1712
01:41:45,891 --> 01:41:46,724
again,
I would say that I would say that's 

1713
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:48,583
faith.
Actually Cornell West talks about leap 

1714
01:41:50,790 --> 01:41:52,130
of hope.
Oh yes.

1715
01:41:52,170 --> 01:41:53,003
Okay.
Required to sustain political activism 

1716
01:41:55,710 --> 01:41:56,880
face of.
Right.

1717
01:41:58,270 --> 01:41:59,103
In the face of evidence.
This face of evidence that all your 

1718
01:42:01,641 --> 01:42:03,470
personal efforts are useless.
Yeah.

1719
01:42:03,710 --> 01:42:04,880
Right.
Right.

1720
01:42:04,910 --> 01:42:07,880
So that's healthy.
Depends.

1721
01:42:09,410 --> 01:42:11,000
Again,
it's very.

1722
01:42:11,270 --> 01:42:12,103
It's very dangerous to try to identify a
definition of something that can be 

1723
01:42:15,861 --> 01:42:18,800
defined as healthy.
Okay.

1724
01:42:18,860 --> 01:42:20,590
That's all.
Let me see if I can address that.

1725
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:23,270
Weren't particularly adaptive.

1726
01:42:29,660 --> 01:42:33,380
I mean our society is predicated on the 
idea that despite all appearances,

1727
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:34,313
something divine about the individual.
I think what Cornell West is referring 

1728
01:42:38,601 --> 01:42:41,950
to is the necessity of acting on that 
belief even though it,

1729
01:42:42,530 --> 01:42:44,480
even though number one,
it's incomprehensible,

1730
01:42:44,540 --> 01:42:47,210
and number two,
it seems to exist despite the evidence.

1731
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:48,231
Now you say,
well,

1732
01:42:48,231 --> 01:42:50,060
what would separate that from a 
delusion?

1733
01:42:50,510 --> 01:42:52,790
Well,
I think there is evidence to support the

1734
01:42:52,791 --> 01:42:54,950
notion that it's accurate because for 
one thing,

1735
01:42:55,160 --> 01:42:55,993
those societies that make that 
presupposition seemed to work much 

1736
01:42:58,790 --> 01:42:59,623
better than those who don't.
And that strikes me as a form of 

1737
01:43:01,671 --> 01:43:02,504
evidence plus,
I mean what we consider evidence that's 

1738
01:43:05,361 --> 01:43:07,640
very difficult to to come to any 
agreement about.

1739
01:43:07,850 --> 01:43:12,850
But it also strikes me that if you look 
at traditional wisdom in these myths,

1740
01:43:13,161 --> 01:43:15,410
for example,
what's constantly pointed out is,

1741
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:18,920
look,
you don't understand the function of the

1742
01:43:18,921 --> 01:43:19,754
individual.

1743
01:43:19,850 --> 01:43:20,683
There's more to it than meets the eye.
The more to it being at the individual 

1744
01:43:24,201 --> 01:43:28,580
is the phenomenon that creates order out
of chaos.

1745
01:43:29,390 --> 01:43:31,520
So the incarnation of Martech,
so to speak,

1746
01:43:31,850 --> 01:43:32,683
plus the force that rejuvenates the 
archaic social system when it needs to 

1747
01:43:36,771 --> 01:43:39,320
be rejuvenated.
And now those two things,

1748
01:43:39,321 --> 01:43:41,040
account for the divinity of the 
individual,

1749
01:43:41,041 --> 01:43:42,470
so to speak.
And I would say,

1750
01:43:42,471 --> 01:43:44,420
well,
even though it may not be evident to you

1751
01:43:44,421 --> 01:43:47,750
necessarily in your actions,
how that is playing out,

1752
01:43:48,050 --> 01:43:50,570
if you're doing it for the right 
reasons,

1753
01:43:51,610 --> 01:43:53,690
then it will play itself out.
Neat.

1754
01:43:53,730 --> 01:43:56,300
You said,
all revolutions start invisibly,

1755
01:43:56,750 --> 01:43:57,583
which is his explicit recapitulation of 
a hero myth because the hero's always 

1756
01:44:00,741 --> 01:44:04,940
born under know trivial and threatened 
conditions.

1757
01:44:05,450 --> 01:44:07,100
So Moses,
for examples,

1758
01:44:07,440 --> 01:44:11,990
he's gonna be he's threatened with death
by the Pharaoh and let go on a river and

1759
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:14,480
in the Christian story,
Christ is born in the stable,

1760
01:44:14,481 --> 01:44:15,980
inherited,
threatens him with Gaf.

1761
01:44:16,490 --> 01:44:20,300
And that's just a sign that you know 
terribly important things.

1762
01:44:20,720 --> 01:44:23,840
Many have the May have the outside 
appearance,

1763
01:44:23,870 --> 01:44:24,703
even a failure,
but that's no indication necessarily 

1764
01:44:26,811 --> 01:44:28,550
that their failure,
well then you say,

1765
01:44:28,551 --> 01:44:29,384
well,
how the hell do you separate that from 

1766
01:44:30,021 --> 01:44:31,300
delusion?
Well,

1767
01:44:32,180 --> 01:44:36,410
that ties into that's a good way of 
closing and that ties into this book.

1768
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:39,300
He can't tell using objective evidence 
if you're,

1769
01:44:39,410 --> 01:44:41,210
if what you're doing is going to be 
successful,

1770
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:43,220
partly because you have the wrong 
timeframe.

1771
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:45,410
So maybe the thing you're doing is 
absolutely right.

1772
01:44:45,411 --> 01:44:46,244
No one knows for 300 years.
You're not going to know it because 

1773
01:44:48,291 --> 01:44:50,330
you're not going to be here.
So how do you know?

1774
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:51,950
Well,
the only thing I can say,

1775
01:44:51,980 --> 01:44:52,813
the only way I can think of that you 
might know is by watching how your 

1776
01:44:55,551 --> 01:44:56,384
actions,
by watching how your belief in actions 

1777
01:45:00,490 --> 01:45:01,790
slip.
Say it again.

1778
01:45:02,810 --> 01:45:04,010
What is it that you want?

1779
01:45:06,130 --> 01:45:06,963
Let me just get this right.
The thing that tends to turn people 

1780
01:45:11,751 --> 01:45:16,160
against life is the fact that life is 
full of inexplicably tragedies.

1781
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:17,473
I would say that if you can develop a 
motive of an attitude towards the world 

1782
01:45:21,651 --> 01:45:24,680
that is characterized by an increase in 
the ability to bear,

1783
01:45:24,681 --> 01:45:25,514
it's tragic circumstances,
that that's evidence that your attitude 

1784
01:45:28,431 --> 01:45:29,570
is correct.
Now,

1785
01:45:29,571 --> 01:45:32,270
the only person who's going to be able 
to determine that is you,

1786
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:35,570
because it's not going to be evident 
necessarily the people around you and it

1787
01:45:35,571 --> 01:45:38,510
may not play out the way you would want 
it to in the external world.

1788
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:40,033
So then the question is how is it that 
you can come to the state where you can 

1789
01:45:42,741 --> 01:45:44,960
trust your own judgment about your 
beliefs?

1790
01:45:44,990 --> 01:45:48,350
Given that people's beliefs get out of 
hand all the time and they say,

1791
01:45:48,351 --> 01:45:49,670
well,
this belief is right,

1792
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:52,940
well that that ties back into this.

1793
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:54,313
If you fill up your head with 
information that you know to buy your 

1794
01:45:56,961 --> 01:45:57,794
own definitions of truth to be false,
then you can ensure that you're not 

1795
01:46:01,761 --> 01:46:03,290
going to be able to trust your own 
judgment.

1796
01:46:03,710 --> 01:46:05,180
Now,
the problem is there's going to be times

1797
01:46:05,181 --> 01:46:06,014
in your life where your judgment is the 
only judgment that can even possibly be 

1798
01:46:09,411 --> 01:46:10,244
valid and it it better be the case that 
when you're in that circumstance that 

1799
01:46:13,971 --> 01:46:14,804
your head is free enough of lives so 
that you can be certain that the 

1800
01:46:17,481 --> 01:46:20,210
decision you're making is right.
So I would say,

1801
01:46:20,211 --> 01:46:23,350
and this is the thing that's going to 
underlie the last lecture in the course,

1802
01:46:23,351 --> 01:46:26,990
is there's two poles of this.
There's two.

1803
01:46:27,010 --> 01:46:30,620
Paul's that underlie your ability to 
determine if you're on the right path is

1804
01:46:30,621 --> 01:46:31,454
way one is you're doing something that 
you're interested in that's meaningful 

1805
01:46:35,121 --> 01:46:38,240
enough so that you say,
even with all the tragedy of life,

1806
01:46:38,480 --> 01:46:41,210
the fact that I can do this makes it all
worthwhile.

1807
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:42,373
And the second thing is,
you better make sure that you're not 

1808
01:46:44,031 --> 01:46:44,864
diluted in what's making you interested 
in and the only way you can be sure of 

1809
01:46:47,210 --> 01:46:48,043
that is that you're not lying because 
you might end up developing an interest 

1810
01:46:50,401 --> 01:46:54,390
in the expert because that happens to 
people or in slaughtering,

1811
01:46:54,870 --> 01:46:56,370
and then their interest guides them 
somewhere.

1812
01:46:56,371 --> 01:46:57,900
It shouldn't have gone.
And I would say,

1813
01:46:57,901 --> 01:46:58,734
well,
that's because they pathologize 

1814
01:46:59,551 --> 01:47:02,400
themselves by filling their brains,
so to speak,

1815
01:47:02,430 --> 01:47:05,320
filling their mind because the 
information they know too,

1816
01:47:05,850 --> 01:47:08,790
they know is not vertical.
So there's two poles.

1817
01:47:08,820 --> 01:47:12,900
One is where something meaningful 
manifests itself.

1818
01:47:13,140 --> 01:47:15,340
Follow it.
Now people want to do that anyway.

1819
01:47:15,390 --> 01:47:19,590
That's what makes your life interesting.
The other thing is whenever you have the

1820
01:47:19,591 --> 01:47:20,424
opportunity,
make sure that you tell yourself the 

1821
01:47:21,421 --> 01:47:22,650
truth,
because if you don't,

1822
01:47:23,130 --> 01:47:27,060
your interest is going to become sick 
and then a lead you somewhere.

1823
01:47:27,061 --> 01:47:28,050
You do not want to do it

1824
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:36,733
anyways.

1825
01:47:37,540 --> 01:47:39,580
So our last classes next week,

1826
01:47:41,970 --> 01:47:46,970
hold everything up.
I have your assets.

1827
01:47:47,950 --> 01:47:48,783
Yes.
Yes.

1828
01:47:48,950 --> 01:47:53,750
Would you say that most of the time if a
person continually the thing,

1829
01:47:53,751 --> 01:47:54,690
no,
it is.

1830
01:47:54,950 --> 01:47:59,950
That they might have behavior so much in
the days they don't like that.

1831
01:48:00,500 --> 01:48:03,010
It continually create like the weight,
let's say.

1832
01:48:04,010 --> 01:48:06,430
Would you say that that's probably 
rationalization that most of it.
