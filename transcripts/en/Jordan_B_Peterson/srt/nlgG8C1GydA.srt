1
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,470
I'm Steven Blackwood.

2
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,070
I'm part of a small team of people
founding a new university in Savannah,

3
00:00:33,071 --> 00:00:36,250
Georgia.
I'm the president of that new institution.

4
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:40,570
I'm here today at Cambridge
University and ancient,

5
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,100
a gust and beautiful institution and I
have the great pleasure today to have

6
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:48,490
with me,
Dr. Jordan Peterson,

7
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,880
professor of psychology at
the University of Toronto,

8
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,530
and I think it is safe to say an
uninsurable figure of our time.

9
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,610
Jordan, it's a real pleasure to
have you here today. Thank you.

10
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,000
Thanks. Pleasure to be here.
Just unbelievable place.

11
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,610
Jordan and I are going to talk today
about what he has called the inflection

12
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:13,560
point and my hope is that
that conversation will lead us

13
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,120
okay

14
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,260
into a discussion of the
possibilities for cultural renewal.

15
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,410
Indeed,
the possibilities for the,

16
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,330
the renewal, the renaissance
of a more fully human culture.

17
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:30,650
John,

18
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,760
I think you've called that the inflection
point or called our cultural temporal

19
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,850
moment to kind of inflection point.
Why don't we start there?

20
00:01:37,851 --> 00:01:39,530
What is the inflection point?

21
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,860
Well,
I think we're deciding,

22
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,920
we're trying to decide if there's such a
thing as a direction to move forward to

23
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,080
into the future.
That's what it looks like to me mean.

24
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,470
On the one hand we're making tremendous
technological progress in all sorts of

25
00:01:57,471 --> 00:01:58,910
directions simultaneously.

26
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:04,070
And that seems to be having mostly
positive effects, especially economically,

27
00:02:04,071 --> 00:02:05,630
especially on a global scale.

28
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,020
And another hand we seem more confused
about are the foundations of our culture

29
00:02:12,561 --> 00:02:14,630
and the potential directions
that we're moving in.

30
00:02:14,631 --> 00:02:19,631
Then we have been for a while and that
seemed especially acute in educational

31
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:24,530
institutions and that seems to be a
consequence of the constant cultural

32
00:02:24,531 --> 00:02:27,830
critique that's been generated.
I would say mostly on the,

33
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:33,020
on the postmodern edge edge of
the academic, what would you say?

34
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,070
Academic uh, territory. So,

35
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,290
so we're trying to figure out
what's next,

36
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,930
what do we have to offer to students,
all of that.

37
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,013
[inaudible] [inaudible]

38
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,170
I know that it was,
it does.

39
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:55,171
Yesterday was published the
50th Anniversary Edition
of Solzhenitsyn's Gulag

40
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:00,100
archipelago with a forward

41
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,000
that, uh, you've, uh,
foreword written by you,

42
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,290
which I think you've described the writing
of is one of the greatest honors of

43
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:12,220
your life, if I got that
right. Yes. Academic. Now,

44
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:16,840
I suppose the question I have there is,
is why is that so important?

45
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,560
Well, the book was important
because it was the first,

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
it was the first work that succeeded in
undermining the Marxists project from a

47
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:33,220
moral and an intellectual
perspective simultaneously. I mean,

48
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:38,221
other people had pointed out the
terror of the Soviet enterprise,

49
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,600
Malcolm Muggeridge and George Orwell,
among others, often people on the left,

50
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:44,590
interestingly enough.

51
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:50,130
But it was always possible right up
until the end of the 1960s for the people

52
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:56,401
who held on to that collectivist utopian
dream in the west to rationalize what

53
00:03:57,701 --> 00:04:01,450
had happened in the Soviet Union,
partly by sweeping it under the rug,

54
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,820
but also partly by,
um,

55
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,240
while using the old adage that you can't
make an omelet without breaking a few

56
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:10,144
eggs.

57
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:15,270
It became obvious by the end of the
1960s that the Omelet wasn't very well

58
00:04:15,911 --> 00:04:19,480
prepared and that millions of eggs,
so to speak,

59
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,540
to Belabor a metaphor,
had been broken.

60
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,250
And so when Solzhenitsyn
wrote his great book, um,

61
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,370
it became impossible for anyone who was

62
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,910
willing to be part of the cultural moment
to ignore the fact that something had

63
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:41,911
gone dreadfully sideways and that it
couldn't be attributed merely to a cult of

64
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:46,990
personality or to some abnormality
that wasn't intrinsically part of the

65
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:47,980
doctrine itself.

66
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,480
And so that was partly what soldier
soldier Knutsen revealed about the Soviet

67
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,280
Union as such.
But at the same time,

68
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,140
the evidence that precisely the same
thing had been happening in places like

69
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:02,530
Maoist China perhaps to
even a larger degree, well,

70
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,120
undoubtedly to a larger degree.

71
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,420
And then in Cambodia and all the other
places where Marxism produced utterly

72
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:14,320
murderous consequences.
Um,

73
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,800
and so that was the book that did that
and it made Marxism morally repugnant.

74
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,660
Um,
it all,

75
00:05:23,661 --> 00:05:28,661
it was also one of the
events that catalyze the
transformation of Marxism into

76
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:30,580
identity politics as far as I'm concerned,

77
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,860
because a lot of the people who held the,

78
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:37,540
the victim victimizer
narrative as sacrosanct,

79
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,610
that that was the appropriate
way to look at the world,

80
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,390
to divide people into identity
groups of whatever form.

81
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:48,400
And then to see history as the
battle between them, the history,

82
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,410
the present and the future that
that trans, that transmuted,

83
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,850
especially in France because even
though the Marxists had beaten, um,

84
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,810
unmasked, the murderousness of the
doctrine had been masked. That didn't,

85
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,240
the people who had held that doctrine,

86
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:07,670
we're still looking for
the easiest lateral move.

87
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:12,740
And so that was one of the driving forces
for the development of postmodernism,

88
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,730
not the only one.

89
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,380
It's the postmodernists are also figured
out something or run across something

90
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:20,120
that really is an intractable problem.

91
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,370
They ran across the problem
of categorization and that
that actually happened in

92
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:27,200
multiple disciplines at the same time,

93
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,800
including artificial intelligence
in psychology. People realize,

94
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:33,290
start to realize about
in the early sixties,

95
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,780
and it was probably under
the pressure of the AI types,

96
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:41,000
that it was very difficult to perceive
the world because objects aren't just

97
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:46,001
there for the looking because every object
is made of sub objects and as part of

98
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,280
a higher order structure of objects
and defining what constitutes the

99
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:55,070
appropriate boundary to put
around a phenomenon so that
it can be perceivable as

100
00:06:55,071 --> 00:06:57,530
an object turns out to be a
virtually impossible task.

101
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,260
We're not sure how it can be managed.

102
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,880
And so the,

103
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:08,100
that realization of the intrinsic
complexity of things led to a crisis,

104
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:12,140
I would say an intellectual
crisis, which was, well,

105
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,210
if there's a near infinite number of ways
to perceive a finite set of entities,

106
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,600
how is it that you can call
any one interpretation,

107
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,700
either canonical or valuable?

108
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,180
And that's part of the
postmodern skepticism,

109
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:29,900
let's say a Meta narratives and it's
actually a reasonable critique. Um,

110
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:32,600
the problem is as far as I'm concerned,

111
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:36,110
that what the postmodernists
did was used that problem,

112
00:07:36,111 --> 00:07:38,840
which is a genuine problem,
uh,

113
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,020
as a critique of the
structure of the West.

114
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,500
And then instead of addressing
the problem directly, which is,

115
00:07:45,501 --> 00:07:47,390
well the world is very complex,

116
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:51,410
but we do in fact perceive it and
they're actually our value structures.

117
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:56,090
They just circumvented that and pop
back into a bastardized form of mark.

118
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:59,930
The bastardized form of Marxism that
we see today is identity politics and

119
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:04,160
that's been extraordinarily destructive
to the universities. Well, let's,

120
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,180
well let's, let's, let's talk, talk

121
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,580
about that a bit more
because it seems to me that,

122
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:12,410
that it would be a great shame if
people were to think that your,

123
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,363
uh,

124
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:18,470
your writing this foreword to Solzhenitsyn
was simply to document something as

125
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:23,471
an historic phenomenon as essentially
important as that historic documentation

126
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:24,643
is.

127
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:29,950
It seems to me that what is of interest
to you is not simply to shed light on

128
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:31,341
the terrors,

129
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:35,600
the hundred million slaughtered a in
the course of the various Communist

130
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:37,250
revolutions of the 20th century.

131
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,230
Those various etiologies motivated
by Marxism and other, uh,

132
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,710
other forms of, of, uh,
philosophical ideology.

133
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:50,300
But because it seems to me that
you take what was present in that

134
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:54,140
philosophically,
ideologically still to be at work in,

135
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,010
in to have been,
as

136
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,050
it were,
reborn in the west.

137
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,630
And so I suppose what I'd like
to ask you about is what are the,

138
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,700
what are the characteristics of

139
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,110
the Marxist ideology that
led to those, that, that,

140
00:09:09,111 --> 00:09:11,610
that very obvious death and destruction,
which in a,

141
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:14,070
in a subtler way you see to be,

142
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,810
am I right to say you see to be at
work in the West? Uh, so I like it.

143
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,160
It seems to be very important that
we have a deep sense of what the,

144
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,440
the governing assumptions of our culture,

145
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:27,780
our or it's hard to transcend them.
Yeah.

146
00:09:27,781 --> 00:09:31,770
Well that is exactly the issue because
the question is whether or not the past

147
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:32,730
is over.
I mean,

148
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:37,350
there's a Mark Zack Marxist
philosopher named Richard Wolff,

149
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:41,250
who challenged me recently
on youtube to a debate.

150
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:44,610
And really the answer that
I posted was this forward.

151
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:49,470
And he accused me of being stuck in
the past. You know, it's, well the,

152
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,730
you know,
the,

153
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:55,380
the wall fell in 1989 in the
horrors of the Soviet era are over.

154
00:09:55,381 --> 00:09:58,740
And we, we, we can't paint,

155
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,880
we can't eternally tar Marxism with
the brush of these past events. I mean,

156
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:08,930
as if these events are over or as if 50
years is sufficient time to forget about

157
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,590
the corpse us. But that's
his idea, you know,

158
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,720
and to me it's the same idea that you
might put forward if you are a neo Nazi by

159
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:20,130
saying that, well, you know,

160
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:25,340
all that happened back in
1945 the fundamental doctrine
was sound and we cannot

161
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:30,600
allow our judgment about these eternal
truths manifested in the national

162
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:35,601
socialists doctrine to be forever tainted
by some unfortunate historical events.

163
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,350
And I think that that's just,
well, I don't even know what
to say about it. I mean,

164
00:10:40,351 --> 00:10:44,820
one of the telling things about his
comments was that he only talked about the

165
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,450
Soviet Union and not all the other
terrible places that the same doctrine had

166
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:51,420
been implemented with
equally murderous effects.

167
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,290
And so that was quite the
argument by evasion. But I,

168
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:59,310
what I tried to do in the forward and
in my thinking in general is I'm always

169
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:02,850
trying to get to the bottom of things.
What's at the bottom?

170
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,820
And it seems to me that what happened,

171
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,340
if you look at what happened
in the Russian revolution,

172
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,480
like the first thing you want to
do is give the devil his due. Okay.

173
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:16,560
And the way you do that is by pointing
out that hierarchical structures,

174
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,960
not we'll,
we'll start even before that.

175
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,090
People have problems
that have to be solved.

176
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,240
Life is a sequence of problems
that have to be solved.

177
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,770
If you don't solve the problems that life
puts forward, you suffer and you die.

178
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,920
So assuming that you don't
want those two outcomes,

179
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:36,540
then there are problems you have to
solve. And, and so you have to set an aim.

180
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:40,500
And the aim is to solve the problem.
And then because we're social creatures,

181
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:44,850
we have to solve the problems
by organizing collectively.
And the way we do that,

182
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:48,240
generally speaking, in relationship
to an aim, is to produce a hierarchy.

183
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:52,140
And the reason for that is that if you
have a problem and you want it to be

184
00:11:52,141 --> 00:11:54,790
solved and you a variety
of people working on it,

185
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:58,120
you're soon going to discover that some
people are much better at solving the

186
00:11:58,121 --> 00:11:58,960
problem than others.

187
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:03,670
And that will inevitably produce a
hierarchy and it should because then the,

188
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,120
even the,
the structure of authority is,

189
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,360
is in sync with the aim and the aim is
valuable because it's a problem that

190
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:15,550
everybody agrees that
is an actual problem.

191
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,430
So you're going to get hierarchical
organizations and you should.

192
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,670
Now the problem with that is that as
soon as you produce a hierarchical

193
00:12:21,671 --> 00:12:23,590
organization,
two things happen.

194
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,610
One is that a small minority of the
people do almost all the creative work.

195
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,840
That's the pre to principal.

196
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,430
And the other is that the benefits of the
hierarchy flow disproportionately to a

197
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:36,070
small number of people at the top.
So,

198
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,350
and that's another manifestation
of the pre to principle.

199
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:41,740
And it is something that marks pointed
out, although he blamed it on capitalism,

200
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:45,940
which, which is a big mistake.
Even if you're concerned for those,

201
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:50,740
the hierarchy dispossesses so you
produce a hierarchy, both the work,

202
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,280
the work flows from a minority of people
and the benefits flow to a minority of

203
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:57,190
people, and those might not be
the same people by the way, right?

204
00:12:57,191 --> 00:13:01,330
Because hierarchies aren't perfect in
their ability to distribute resources as a

205
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:06,190
consequence of a productive effort
that that's part of the problem with

206
00:13:06,191 --> 00:13:07,570
hierarchical organizations.

207
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,960
But then what the hierarchy does is
produce a layer of the dispossessed that

208
00:13:13,031 --> 00:13:17,650
stack up at the bottom near zero, and it's
the majority. It's always the majority.

209
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,240
So that's the price you
pay for hierarchies. Now
what the left does is say,

210
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:27,490
look at the dispossessed and keep the
hierarchy flexible enough so that it can

211
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:29,570
twist and band and transform unnecessary,

212
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,620
but also so that the dispossessed
don't fall so close to zero,

213
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,730
that aid that they're done,
they're in misery B,

214
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:40,030
that the talents they might
possess can't be utilized.

215
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:44,800
And see that the whole structure doesn't
become so untenable that it destroys

216
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:48,910
itself because of the inequality,
perfectly reasonable propositions.

217
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,410
And so then you could say,
well,

218
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:55,000
there's a certain number of people on
the left who are genuinely motivated by

219
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,830
concern about dispossession as well
as the dispossessed of course, fine.

220
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:03,130
So that's to give the devil his due.
And so then you might say, well,

221
00:14:03,131 --> 00:14:04,570
there was moral reasons.

222
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:08,380
There were more reasons for at least a
subset of those who are involved in the

223
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,450
Russian revolution to be involved.

224
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,730
They were interested in
helping the dispossessed,

225
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:17,210
but there's a problem and this is the
problem of the left. There's a problem.

226
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,250
So on the right as well.

227
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:21,160
The problem on the right is once
the hierarchy is established,

228
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:25,390
those who dominate the top have every
right to overstate the moral virtue of the

229
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:29,350
hierarchy because it privileges
them in particular on the left.

230
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:33,310
The problem is is that it's not easy
to distinguish between care for the

231
00:14:33,311 --> 00:14:37,990
dispossessed and hatred for
those who occupy positions of,

232
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,320
well, you could say authority.
The leftists would say power.

233
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:45,490
You could also say competence, which I
think is more to the case or ability.

234
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:50,880
It's not easy to distinguish care for the
dispossessed from hatred for those who

235
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,580
occupy the preeminent positions in
the hierarchy. And if it's power,

236
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:59,780
then it's hatred for power, but if
it's competence and it is competence,

237
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:03,530
if the hierarchy is functional, then
it's hatred for the competent. Okay.

238
00:15:03,531 --> 00:15:06,230
Then you say, all right, so those
are the two competing motivations,

239
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,650
care for the dispossessed and
hatred for the, let's say competent.

240
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:13,460
Let's play that out.
Historically speaking and see,

241
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:15,110
which is the more powerful force.

242
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,020
While that got played out very
rapidly in the Russian revolution.

243
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:23,290
And what happened was even if there
was a s a minority and perhaps even a

244
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:25,670
majority,
although there wasn't,

245
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:29,630
but perhaps even a majority of those
who truly cared for the dispossessed,

246
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:32,840
those who hated the
competent slaughtered them,

247
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:37,820
it turned out that the hatred
was a much more potent, uh,

248
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,840
geopolitical force than the compassion.
And then,

249
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:45,000
and another twist
occurred too because the,

250
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:49,670
the narrative was Bursch Waze
against proletariat, let's say.

251
00:15:49,671 --> 00:15:53,120
And so that's those at the upper most
pinnacle of the hierarchy against those

252
00:15:53,121 --> 00:15:56,360
who were the dispossessed. And that
was also the historical narrative.

253
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:00,740
And then it was the right
and responsibility of those
who are oppressed to rise

254
00:16:00,741 --> 00:16:05,100
up. But that ran into another problem,
which is basically the problem that the,

255
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:08,810
that the, the postmodernists,
especially on the feminist side,

256
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,200
have now identified as
intersectionality. It's like, well,

257
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:17,050
it turns out that you're, you can so
easily be placed into one group. I,

258
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,780
in fact, this is the perception
problem that we talked about before.

259
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,310
There's a very large number of groups.
You can be placed in it.

260
00:16:24,311 --> 00:16:27,320
It might be an unlimited
number of groups in fact.

261
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:32,570
And so then if you're motivated
primarily by hatred and your, your,

262
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,480
your desire is to produce
as much mayhem as possible.

263
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:40,070
You can take any given person and you
can analyze the multiple groups that they

264
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,180
belong to. And then you can find one
group in which they're the oppressor.

265
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,930
And then because there's no excuse
whatsoever for the oppression,

266
00:16:47,931 --> 00:16:51,590
even if there's one dimension of your
identity along which you're an oppressor,

267
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:54,500
then you're grist for the,
for the,

268
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:58,940
for the bone crushing mill of the,
of the Soviet work cap.

269
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,350
And that's exactly what happened. And
so as the Soviet revolution progressed,

270
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:07,280
more and more people got
thrown into the cauldron,

271
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:12,290
let's say the socialists, the students
to religious people, the, all the, the,

272
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,590
the old, the original Revolutionary
Stellan had all of them killed.

273
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,760
Cause there was some,

274
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,090
and if it wasn't you that was guilty
because of your group membership,

275
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:22,680
then they just expanded
the capacity that the,

276
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:27,020
the parameters of the idea of group,
well you're not an MPR oppressor,

277
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:31,300
but your grandfather was a landowner.
Well that's good enough. That's, that's,

278
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,020
that's your class. That's, that's,

279
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:36,710
and so that's sufficient justification
to throw you to the wolves as well.

280
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:42,070
And so what you saw is this
just unbelievable expansion
of murderousness driven

281
00:17:44,151 --> 00:17:49,151
by the twin improper presuppositions that
you could define people by their group

282
00:17:50,251 --> 00:17:55,251
identity and that history was best
conceptualized as a battle between the

283
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,490
fortunate, the unfortunate long
those group identities. Yes.

284
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,160
If we could pick up that,
that notion of the,

285
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:04,310
the group identity and the
collect what you call the co,

286
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,880
the collectivist thinking,

287
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:11,310
it seems to me that might be opposed
to a kind of robust view of the human

288
00:18:11,311 --> 00:18:16,020
individual as the site of
responsibility and agency suffering.

289
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:20,910
And so it seems to me that, uh, what
I'd like to ask you about is the,

290
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:22,500
is the connection between,

291
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:27,890
or the ways in which the collectivist
thinking results in the annihilation of

292
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,970
all human particularity,

293
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:34,650
whether it's economic or a familial or,

294
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,960
uh, uh, you might say,

295
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,350
it seems to me that what's going on in
the collectivist thinking is the absolute

296
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,970
enemy of

297
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,110
human particularity and freedom itself.
That's

298
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:49,270
the enemy of the idea of the individual,
the sovereign individual,

299
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,580
which is the central idea of the West.
I mean,

300
00:18:51,581 --> 00:18:54,130
and that's manifested in the
underlying religious structure.

301
00:18:54,131 --> 00:18:56,890
So if you think about
Christianity for example,

302
00:18:56,891 --> 00:19:00,820
you think about Christianity
psychologically is strip
it of its metaphysics,

303
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,980
at least for the purposes of the argument.

304
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:08,320
You see the emergence of the idea of
the divine individual as, as well as,

305
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:13,390
as what, as, as part of what's what,
as part of divinity itself, right?

306
00:19:13,391 --> 00:19:17,970
As an integral part that's part of the
trinitarian idea of the part of, uh,

307
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,420
of divinity itself.

308
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:23,950
And that divinity to me
is the capacity of the,

309
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:28,030
of individual consciousness to
generate order from potential.

310
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,550
So the way I look at people,
first of all,

311
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:34,060
so like people who have been
criticizing what I'd be doing,

312
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:39,540
think about my philosophy such as it is
not that it's mine as a sort of variant

313
00:19:42,011 --> 00:19:46,840
of iron Rand's ideas of the centrality
of the individual individual above all,

314
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,430
that's not the issue. It's a
conceptual issue. Is that what,

315
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,900
what, what category is to
be primary? And for me,

316
00:19:55,901 --> 00:19:59,770
the individuals to be primary.
And there's a variety of reasons for that.

317
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,341
First of all,

318
00:20:00,341 --> 00:20:04,810
the individual is the locus of suffering
and also the locus of responsibility.

319
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,401
So,

320
00:20:05,401 --> 00:20:09,640
so those are really the two reasons that
the individual has to be made primary.

321
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,220
Um, but, and, and the divinity
element of the individual. And,

322
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,710
and this I think is coated
in our deepest stories,

323
00:20:17,711 --> 00:20:20,110
it's really deeply coded in genesis,

324
00:20:20,111 --> 00:20:23,530
particularly in the opening chapters
of opening verses of Genesis,

325
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,980
is that what human beings confront in
their lives is akin to what God himself

326
00:20:29,381 --> 00:20:31,060
confronted at the beginning of time.

327
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,480
And so it's easy for us to believe
that we're deterministic creatures like

328
00:20:36,671 --> 00:20:39,490
clocks and,
and that it's the past,

329
00:20:39,491 --> 00:20:42,880
the drives us forward in a
deterministic manner into the future.

330
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,340
But I don't believe that's the case.

331
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,850
I actually don't think there's any that
that's the case because people are so

332
00:20:48,851 --> 00:20:52,450
complex. You actually can't predict
them as if they're deterministic,

333
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:56,500
excepted in very constrained
circumstances. And so it's a hypothesis,

334
00:20:56,501 --> 00:21:01,270
but it's not a very good one. Um,
and although it has its utility,

335
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,840
what, what, what seems
to me to be the case,

336
00:21:04,841 --> 00:21:09,580
and I think this is how people
conceptualize themselves
and how they act towards

337
00:21:09,581 --> 00:21:14,260
themselves and towards other people and
how our social structures or political

338
00:21:14,261 --> 00:21:15,640
structures are constituted,

339
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
is that human beings constantly
confront a landscape of possibility.

340
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:25,660
It's potential itself. And, and we
have a belief in the idea of potential.

341
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:29,380
We have an idea that there
are things that could be,

342
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,800
it's a very strange conception of
reality because it's not a materialistic

343
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:37,210
conception because things that could be
aren't measurable in any sense, right?

344
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:42,390
But we certainly act as if they exist
and we all treat each other as if our,

345
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,310
one of our fundamental ethical

346
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:51,160
requirements is for you to
confront that potential properly.

347
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:55,930
And that would be to live up to your
responsibility is you have these gifts and

348
00:21:55,931 --> 00:22:00,490
talents and, and possibilities
that have been granted to you.

349
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,630
And if you fail to make use of
them, your talents, let's say,

350
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,030
then that's a sin of sorts.

351
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,270
And that's a religious
way of thinking about it.

352
00:22:10,271 --> 00:22:12,910
But it doesn't matter because
that's how people treat each other.

353
00:22:12,911 --> 00:22:17,380
If you have a child, for example,
or or, or a spouse or a friend,

354
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:22,410
brother to anyone you care about and
you see you have the intuition that they

355
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:27,250
could be making more of themselves
and what they have, then they are,

356
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,230
then you're deeply disappointed in that.

357
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:34,060
And the reason you're disappointed in
that is because there's a call to us,

358
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,280
an existential call to confront
that potential. That's,

359
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:43,430
that's everywhere that faces us in every
direction and to transform it into the

360
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:47,830
most functional and
habitable order possible.

361
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:52,770
And the way that that is to be done
properly is with truth. And, and,

362
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:57,780
and I think that all of those ideas
are integral to the Judeo Christian

363
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:01,090
substrate of Western culture.
They're fundamental ideas.

364
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:05,680
And so if you put the group
before the individual,

365
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:08,890
then all of that disappears when you're,

366
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,320
when you're debating
with the radical leftist,

367
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,180
postmodern types about free speech,

368
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,630
you're actually not debating with them
about free speech because they don't

369
00:23:16,631 --> 00:23:18,070
believe in free speech.

370
00:23:18,071 --> 00:23:23,050
It's not part of their conceptual universe
because for for speech to be free and

371
00:23:23,051 --> 00:23:24,160
therefore valuable,

372
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,760
the people conducting the conversation
have to be sovereign individuals capable

373
00:23:31,271 --> 00:23:35,590
of generating independent
thought independent of their
canonical group identity

374
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,430
and reach a consensus through
that process of dialogue,

375
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,280
none of that exists in
the postmodern world.

376
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:45,720
All of those preconceptions
would be attributed. Well.

377
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,830
Something like Euro centric
neocolonialism, something like that.

378
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,910
It seems to me that wasn't work at
that is a radical dismissal of the

379
00:23:52,911 --> 00:23:55,850
possibility that the individual
has access to anything at all.

380
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,160
That is to say that that that in,

381
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,810
if you don't do believe in free speech
is fundamentally motivated by the,

382
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:03,680
by or,

383
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,000
or sustained by the confidence
that our discourse or dialogue,

384
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:11,210
that human thinking itself
can reach something stable,

385
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:16,330
that it has a relationship beyond the by
beyond immediacy and that and that and

386
00:24:16,701 --> 00:24:21,110
that there's me on power and beyond power.
It reaches beyond power to truth.

387
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:25,790
There's no point in ever having a
conversation about anything if the

388
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:29,600
conversation itself doesn't have access
to something transcendent. Exactly right.

389
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,980
Well.
So what happens with,

390
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:34,550
and this is especially true for
people like food call Dera too,

391
00:24:34,551 --> 00:24:36,020
to some degree as well,

392
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:39,740
the first thing you do is you define
the fundamental motivation has power.

393
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,920
Because that's all there is, is there's
the dominance of one group or the other.

394
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:47,990
And so then the dialogue has to serve
power because that's all there is.

395
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:51,720
And so yeah, all of that is
obliterated. And, and by,

396
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,500
by doing that actually, the, the,

397
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:59,300
the postmodernist make it impossible
for them to solve the conundrum that

398
00:24:59,301 --> 00:25:02,060
validly drove poss
postmodernism to begin with.

399
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,930
So the conundrum is infinite set
of potential interpretations.

400
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:10,210
That's a real conundrum. That's the
problem of complexity, right? And,

401
00:25:10,211 --> 00:25:13,310
and it's real. So then
the question is, well,

402
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:15,800
is there any solution to
the problem of complexity?

403
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,100
And this is where issues of moral
relativism start to become, um,

404
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:24,950
PR paramount. Because if there's no
solution to the problem of complexity,

405
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:29,330
then there's no canonical interpretations.
And all the interpretations are just,

406
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:32,330
well, what would you call
it? They're there expedient.

407
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,870
They have the expedience of power.
But see,

408
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,960
my best pathway through that essentially
I think has come from the developmental

409
00:25:41,631 --> 00:25:42,321
psychologist,

410
00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:46,880
Sean Piaget and Piaget could
be considered a Neil Kantian.

411
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:47,660
You know,

412
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:52,660
the cots fundamental doctrine was
act such that if your action became a

413
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:56,690
universal maximum that that would
be of universal benefit. And so,

414
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:01,480
and but by Piaget differentiated that and,
and,

415
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:02,110
and,

416
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:06,860
and demonstrated how that evolved
naturally in the course of the spontaneous

417
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:10,580
maturation of children through play.
It's, it's absolutely brilliant.

418
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:12,530
So I can give you a quick example.

419
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:17,531
So my granddaughter who's 14 months
old has just learned a new game.

420
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,160
And the game is,

421
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:23,090
she plays it with her wooden spoon and
the game is she has the spoon and then

422
00:26:23,091 --> 00:26:26,600
she looks at you and then she gives you
the spoon and then you take it from her

423
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:30,650
and she lets it go and then she watches
you and then you give the spoon back and

424
00:26:30,651 --> 00:26:32,240
she's very happy to get the spoon back.

425
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,220
But she's also very
happy to give it to you.

426
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:38,330
And then she turns to the next person
and she gives them the spoon and then she

427
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:42,860
gets it back. And then you can play
with there. And the play is, well,

428
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,670
now you've, you've, you've, you've,

429
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:48,540
you've started to embody the
principle of reciprocity, right?

430
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,830
We can trade and, and it's a
repeating game. It's not one trade.

431
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,620
You don't end up with a spoon.
And I don't end up with this bone.

432
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,800
We both have the spoon some
of the time across time.

433
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,890
And there's some utility in
the exchange itself. Okay.

434
00:27:01,891 --> 00:27:04,260
So she's playing without
in thrilled about,

435
00:27:04,261 --> 00:27:08,040
and no wonder because it's a
walloping walloping discovery.

436
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:10,560
And so then you take the
spoon from her and maybe you,

437
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,730
you hold it a little longer
than she expects and that
makes her a little nervous.

438
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,370
But then you give it back and then
she's relieved and that makes her happy.

439
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,150
Or You cover the spoon with your hand
and then she's a bit confused about where

440
00:27:21,151 --> 00:27:21,661
it might be a new,

441
00:27:21,661 --> 00:27:24,510
show it to her and you give it
back and she's happy about that.

442
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:28,830
Or she reaches out to grab it and you
pull it away a little bit and move it back

443
00:27:28,831 --> 00:27:31,290
and forth. So she has to do a
little more effort to get it.

444
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:36,300
And as long as you don't push
that, and it's a bit of a
challenge to her, uh, both,

445
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:39,840
both physically in terms of,
of coordination,

446
00:27:39,841 --> 00:27:42,510
but also psychologically in
terms of delay of gratification.

447
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:47,370
She also finds that gratifying and the,
and the reason for that is that you're,

448
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,690
you're showing how her,

449
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:53,750
how robust and resilient the idea of
reciprocity is across sequences of

450
00:27:54,331 --> 00:27:57,810
transformations. And it's just this little
thing you do at the table. You think,

451
00:27:57,811 --> 00:28:00,030
well that's nothing. It's
like, no, it's something.

452
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:04,800
And so the P is Yeti and idea
is something like there's an,

453
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,790
there's an implicit morality that
emerges to constrain the infinite set of

454
00:28:08,791 --> 00:28:09,630
interpretations.

455
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:14,631
And it has to do with the structure that
we'll maintain reciprocity optimally in

456
00:28:14,971 --> 00:28:15,804
the largest,

457
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,460
including the largest number of people
across the largest amount of time. And so,

458
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,730
and so the way that I've been portraying
that for the people who've been

459
00:28:23,731 --> 00:28:24,690
listening to my lectures,

460
00:28:24,691 --> 00:28:28,860
is that what you need to
take responsibility for
yourself as if you care for

461
00:28:28,861 --> 00:28:32,100
yourself. Okay. So first we
figure out what's yourself. Well,

462
00:28:32,101 --> 00:28:34,860
it's not just you now
because you aren't just,

463
00:28:34,861 --> 00:28:39,240
you now you're the community of
use that extra stretch across time.

464
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,760
So in order for you to take
care of yourself properly,

465
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:46,560
now you have to learn to play an iterative
game with yourself that's sustainable

466
00:28:46,561 --> 00:28:49,260
and even potentially
improvable across time.

467
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,630
And there aren't many games
that you can play like that.

468
00:28:51,631 --> 00:28:54,630
So that starts to radically
constrained the set of possibilities.

469
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:58,530
And then it's more constrained than that
because not only do you have to play a

470
00:28:58,531 --> 00:29:02,250
game with yourself that can repeat
across time to minimize suffering,

471
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,500
to remove the possibility of death,

472
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:07,680
to allow for the possibility of
productive movement in a certain amount of

473
00:29:07,681 --> 00:29:12,300
happiness. But you have to do that with
other people around you and across time.

474
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:17,160
And so there's you and the multiple
use embedded in your family and the

475
00:29:17,161 --> 00:29:21,990
multiplicity of your family members
embedded inside a culture and,

476
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,540
and the extension of
that culture across time.

477
00:29:24,541 --> 00:29:28,740
And so for you to act properly than all
of those things have to be harmoniously

478
00:29:28,741 --> 00:29:30,030
balanced at the same time.

479
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:34,110
And that radically reduces the
set of potential interpretations.

480
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:38,850
And that's the antidote to
the, to the chaos of, of, of,

481
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:43,850
of the infinite array,
potential perceptual, uh,

482
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:48,850
worlds and, and well, and then there
are questions that emerge out of that.

483
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:51,130
Like, well, what's the
best way to play that game?

484
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:55,860
But we certainly know that a reciprocity
fairplay the spirit of fair play is,

485
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,270
is,
is immensely important to that.

486
00:29:58,271 --> 00:30:01,510
And that's what Piaget documented
and that Wa it's what we all know.

487
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:05,530
And also that there's something about
truth that's absolutely integral to that

488
00:30:05,531 --> 00:30:09,490
as well. So, and the
postmodernists just, they just,

489
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:13,450
they got the problem, right, but they,

490
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,100
they never went the next steps.
And it's partly because, well,

491
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:19,451
why is it,

492
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:23,350
why is it they had an easy answer at hand
that required almost no transformation

493
00:30:23,351 --> 00:30:25,120
in their original worldview?
Well,

494
00:30:25,121 --> 00:30:28,810
we'll just keep the Marxism will just
transform it into something that looks

495
00:30:28,811 --> 00:30:32,440
different and that'll be good
enough. Minimal change. So

496
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:35,830
it seems to me that that, that the,
that the, the, the, the collective,

497
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:39,340
the collective is thinking that's at work
in the insistence that only the group

498
00:30:39,341 --> 00:30:44,341
matters has the effect of radically
annihilating the integrity of the

499
00:30:44,861 --> 00:30:47,710
individual. In fact, that may be even,
it's a, its essence. Well I think,

500
00:30:47,711 --> 00:30:49,860
I think it's,
it's a actually that is the saying.

501
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:52,600
I believe so at the bottom
and because there's a,

502
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,390
there's a murderousness at
the bottom of the collectivism

503
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:59,730
that needs to be accounted for.
And so I see what's at the bottom.

504
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,520
And this is partly a consequence,

505
00:31:02,521 --> 00:31:05,850
say of the insistence that the
west is a patriarchal tyranny. The,

506
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:08,730
the desire is it's the
Cain and Abel Desire.

507
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,580
See Cain was jealous of Abel.

508
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,430
Not so much because
Abel was God's favorite,

509
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:19,500
but because Abel deserved to be God's
favorite because he had done things right

510
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,060
and it's very bitter.

511
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:26,240
It's very bitter in life to see a gap
widening between you and someone else,

512
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,013
period.

513
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:31,920
But it's particularly bitter if you know
the gap is widening because the person

514
00:31:31,921 --> 00:31:36,750
who is doing well is doing,
is actually doing good and doing well.

515
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:41,930
And that implies at least in eradicating
the vagaries and randomness of life,

516
00:31:42,691 --> 00:31:46,770
and I'm, I'm perfectly aware
of those as factors. It's,

517
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,570
it's bad enough to be down,

518
00:31:48,571 --> 00:31:53,250
but it's worse to know that you're down
because you've put yourself down and

519
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,080
then you have a choice,

520
00:31:55,081 --> 00:32:00,081
which is do you do turn against the ideal
itself because it becomes so painful

521
00:32:00,601 --> 00:32:05,601
to gaze upon it or do you destroy
the ideal out of vengeance and spite?

522
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,650
And that's,
and that's,

523
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,210
that's a simpler pathway forward then
decomposing and deconstructing yourself

524
00:32:12,211 --> 00:32:16,500
and being reborn.
The Christian idea for,

525
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,730
for lack of a better word,

526
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:23,300
is that something has to be sacrificed
in order for the potential of the future

527
00:32:23,581 --> 00:32:27,180
to be manifested in the best possible way.
There's always a demand for sacrifice.

528
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,500
The question is what should be sacrificed?
And the answer is you.

529
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:36,450
That's the answer. It's you that should
be sacrificed. And then the question is,

530
00:32:36,451 --> 00:32:37,460
well,
what part of you and,

531
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:40,790
and the answer to that as the
part of you that's not worthy,

532
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:44,270
that needs to be put into the
flame that needs to be burnt off.

533
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,270
And that's a process of death.
And rebirth.

534
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:49,670
And if there's lots of you
that has become corrupt,

535
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:54,910
then most of what passes through
the fire will be burnt off.

536
00:32:55,371 --> 00:32:59,120
And that's terribly painful for people.
It's, that's the desert. You know,

537
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:03,200
w imagine that your, that your essential
personality structure is tyrannical.

538
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,120
So you're a rigid idealogue,

539
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:09,440
you're cast in stone and so you decide
to move from the tyranny who escaped from

540
00:33:09,441 --> 00:33:13,010
the tyranny. Well, where do
you end up where you don't
end up in the promise land,

541
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:17,000
you end up in the desert for 40 years
and maybe you die there. I mean,

542
00:33:17,001 --> 00:33:21,290
even Moses did. So it's out of
the frying pan into the fire,

543
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:25,400
that's for sure. And it's no wonder
that people are loath to let go.

544
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,530
And then the more
tyrannical they've become,

545
00:33:27,531 --> 00:33:31,370
the more they've restricted their
possibility and all of that and sold their

546
00:33:31,371 --> 00:33:35,720
soul to the dogma of human beings. Let's
say a soldier Knutsen would describe it,

547
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,370
the less there is of them that will be
left after everything is stripped bare.

548
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:44,180
And that's a terrifying,
that's a terrifying possibility.

549
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:47,660
It's much easier to take the other
route and it becomes easier and easier.

550
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:51,500
And then while there are other motivations
that pile up as well, bitterness,

551
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:55,220
the hatred that bitterness can, because
you know, you've lost your chance, right?

552
00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:00,280
You had your chance and you've,
and you've squandered it and the,

553
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,430
and the feeling of that.

554
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:06,440
I think that's why Cain tells God after
he gets caught after his murderous act,

555
00:34:06,441 --> 00:34:10,160
he says that his punishment is more
than he can bear because it's the

556
00:34:10,161 --> 00:34:13,160
realization of what he's done.
He's destroyed his own ideal.

557
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:15,170
And that's what you do
if you're a collectivist,

558
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:19,280
you destroy yourself as an
individual and that's all you have.

559
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,020
And so there's,

560
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:26,000
there's nothing in that except I
would say a continually opening pet of

561
00:34:26,001 --> 00:34:27,560
hopelessness and despair.

562
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,460
And then that drives bitterness and
hatred and desire for revenge and all of

563
00:34:31,461 --> 00:34:35,780
that. It's a terrible cycle and we've
seen it play itself out over and over and,

564
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:40,340
and, and, and we haven't yet
precisely learned from that. So to me,

565
00:34:40,341 --> 00:34:44,960
it's part of an eternal struggle.
You know, it's been outlined as a,

566
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,670
as a war in some sense.

567
00:34:46,671 --> 00:34:50,780
That's going on in the human psyche
since the beginning of time for for all

568
00:34:50,781 --> 00:34:51,830
intents and purposes,

569
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:56,490
it seems to me, Jordan, that your position
is, is fundamentally a positive one.

570
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:59,310
It's an affirmation of human dignity,

571
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:04,260
the freedom that dignity demands
and an affirmation of the infinite

572
00:35:04,261 --> 00:35:05,910
particularity of human life.

573
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,040
If one were to contrast
the collectivist thinking,

574
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:15,870
on the one hand we've, when might call
it a kind of abstract rationality,

575
00:35:15,871 --> 00:35:20,760
is if there's one solution to fit them,
one size fits all kind of top down logic.

576
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,710
What's on the other side?
What's the,

577
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,170
what's the antidote to
that in the individual

578
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:29,860
it is particularly, I mean one of the
things I talk about in 12 rules for life,

579
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:34,210
and this is an in my lectures, this
is become a, a meme, strangely enough,

580
00:35:34,211 --> 00:35:36,190
something that's widely
distributed on the web,

581
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,310
partly because there's
comical element to it.

582
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:42,330
It's to clean up your room and everyone
laughs about that because I'm taking

583
00:35:42,331 --> 00:35:45,060
that seriously. It's like,
oh, clean up your room.

584
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:48,450
Everyone's mother has told them
that a thousand times. Right,

585
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:50,880
but I tried to explain why.
It's like,

586
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:55,080
well you have a bit of chaotic
potential right in front of you.

587
00:35:55,410 --> 00:36:00,410
It's in some sense infinite
in its potential and the
the domain in which you can

588
00:36:01,081 --> 00:36:05,950
manipulate that might be rather restricted
because of the restrictions that that

589
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:08,010
are part and parcel of your existence.

590
00:36:08,011 --> 00:36:12,120
But maybe you have your room and you
might think you might have contempt for

591
00:36:12,121 --> 00:36:15,840
that and so it's a complete bloody
catastrophe, but you don't have to,

592
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:19,740
you could think, well, I've
got a little, it isn't a room.

593
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,370
It's a place of potential and as
soon as you know that, then it's,

594
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:26,400
it's not your room anymore.
It isn't a room.

595
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:31,470
The room that you see is
your preconception of the
space that you inhabit.

596
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:35,130
What's there is,
is a fragment of infinity.

597
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:39,840
That's what's there and
what you see is the,

598
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:40,710
is the,

599
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:45,710
is the low resolution consequence of
your assumption and lazy habit and

600
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:49,590
blindness. That's your initial room and
you think, well no, that's not the room.

601
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,750
See part of what artists do.
For example,

602
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:55,050
when van Gogh Paints a room
and you look at it glowing,

603
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:59,250
he's trying to show you what's
beyond your perception of the room.

604
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:00,750
And I mean this technically,

605
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:05,640
like the way that your visual system
is set up is that whenever memory and

606
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:10,170
presumption can, can, can
replace direct perception,

607
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,390
it will because it's simpler.

608
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:17,630
So you literally see what you expect to
see and if what you see is dull and drab

609
00:37:18,331 --> 00:37:22,020
and boring and pointless and, and, and,

610
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:26,340
and uninspiring, then that's
you. It's not what's there.

611
00:37:26,341 --> 00:37:31,341
And what the artist does when he or she
represents that mundane reality is to

612
00:37:31,441 --> 00:37:34,830
remind you of what's behind it.
The potential that's there.

613
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,700
And so what I'm suggesting to people
is that they take the potential that's

614
00:37:38,701 --> 00:37:41,730
right in front of them. It's
like, okay, and here's the rule

615
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:47,790
you're aiming up.
There's something that you could change,

616
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,870
that you would change now might
be a very small thing. Could,

617
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,960
well that's within the
grasp of your power would,

618
00:37:54,961 --> 00:37:59,070
is within the grasp of your
will to combine those two
things might be very small

619
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:03,780
shift. You might only be willing to make
a very tiny step forward. It's like fine,

620
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:04,980
good enough,

621
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:09,980
make a tiny step forward and that makes
you a slight bit stronger than you were

622
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:14,160
before. And then the next step
can be slightly larger and it's,

623
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:17,070
it's the path of humility.
It's what people,

624
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:21,810
it's what people act out when.
So there's this cathedral,

625
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:25,920
it's actually, it's not a cathedral,
it's an oratorial in Montreal,

626
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,720
I think it's the second
largest one in the world.

627
00:38:27,721 --> 00:38:32,721
It's set on a hill at the top of a hill
and there's a huge staircase leading up

628
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:34,530
to it from the bottom of the hill.

629
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:39,860
And people often who are crippled and
who were on crutches and so forth are in

630
00:38:39,881 --> 00:38:43,480
wheelchairs, go there and make
their way painfully up the hill.

631
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,580
Or maybe they do that on their knees.

632
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:50,350
And the idea is that they're
struggling incrementally uphill,

633
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:55,390
step-by-step despite their burdens to
reach the city of God on the hill and

634
00:38:55,931 --> 00:38:57,670
they're acting out.
That's life.

635
00:38:57,671 --> 00:39:02,020
It's like the proper aim is
the city of God on the hill.

636
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,220
And what is that?
Well,

637
00:39:03,221 --> 00:39:06,550
that's that place that we talked
about already where these levels of

638
00:39:06,551 --> 00:39:11,551
responsibility are stacked together
harmoniously so that you're acting in your

639
00:39:11,711 --> 00:39:16,000
best interest and in your family's best
interest and in and in the world's best

640
00:39:16,001 --> 00:39:20,740
interest. And I would say in the
best interests of reality itself,

641
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:25,150
right? Assuming that we have some
integral role to play in reality,

642
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,220
which is certainly at least
true at the human level.

643
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:31,960
That's the city of God on the hill
that beckons to everyone and you,

644
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,580
you move up that you
move towards that humbly.

645
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:40,870
So that's one step at a time and you
do it despite your burden and you're

646
00:39:40,871 --> 00:39:44,200
suffering all of that. And that's
all dramatized in that and it's,

647
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,940
it's a perfect dram of that.

648
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:49,510
And would you even say it is not to
be despite your suffering, it's in,

649
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:52,330
in through your particular suffering.
We, one thing that strikes me about,

650
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:55,240
you know, clean up your
room, clean up your room.

651
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,180
Yes it is the affirmation of the
particularity of your life. I mean,

652
00:39:58,181 --> 00:40:01,840
one thing that strikes me about deepest
in our human experience is that it is

653
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:06,010
infinitely particular. I
mean, you mentioned your, your
granddaughter. I mean the,

654
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:10,780
the, the loves, the people,
the experiences, the places
that were shaped by it.

655
00:40:10,781 --> 00:40:12,630
They're not places in the abstract.
This,

656
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,850
this top down sense as if
there could be the, you know,

657
00:40:15,851 --> 00:40:20,200
the same kinds of clothes and the same
kinds of experience for all human beings.

658
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:20,590
It,

659
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:25,590
that that's the enemy of the very
deepest truth of our human experience,

660
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,410
which it seems to me is
infinitely particular,

661
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,750
but not infinitely
particular in the center,

662
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:34,210
which those particularities
just go off into nothingness.

663
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:38,800
Those particulars are precisely our
points of access to the transcendent,

664
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:42,360
to the infinite, to the, to
the, to, to, to, to that switch.

665
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,280
That's where the reality is.
Yes.

666
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:48,290
So that's why young said that modern men
can't see God because they don't look

667
00:40:48,291 --> 00:40:49,840
low enough. Yes. They're not,

668
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,220
there aren't paying attention to the
importance of the particularities because

669
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,440
the particularity is where the
pen meets the paper, right? Yeah.

670
00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:00,290
And it's just a tiny dot
every, every, like when you're,
when you're writing, it's,

671
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,490
it's a dot.
And then it extends into a,

672
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:05,450
in those transform into words
and sentences and paragraphs,

673
00:41:05,451 --> 00:41:10,430
but the particular act is where the pen
meets. Yes, yes, yes. That focal point,

674
00:41:10,431 --> 00:41:12,680
right?
That's the center of the cross by the way.

675
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:16,980
Yes. Yes. Well, you mentioned
the cross, I mean certainly in
the, in, in, in, in, in the,

676
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,340
in the history of,
of the West,

677
00:41:20,341 --> 00:41:23,880
one of the ways has come through as
a and in the east to is in Christian

678
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:27,690
theology is the very notion
of the incarnation. You
know, what does that to say,

679
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:32,460
but that the infinite is in the
particular and that they, that,

680
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:34,040
that they are,
that they are co

681
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:39,040
inherence that the infinite in fact has
no life except in the particular and the

682
00:41:40,671 --> 00:41:45,671
particular itself has a relation
to her is comprehended by that.

683
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:46,724
Very infinite.

684
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:51,790
And so it seems to me that that what is
going on there is an affirmation that

685
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,620
every particularity,

686
00:41:54,621 --> 00:41:59,090
no matter how tiny itself
has revelent Tori of,

687
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:04,550
of a transcendent, and I think
it was from the gospel of Thomas,

688
00:42:04,551 --> 00:42:07,550
but I might have this wrong. The
Kingdom of God is spread upon the earth.

689
00:42:07,551 --> 00:42:11,120
But men do not see it. And that's
that. That's that infinite,

690
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,570
that infinite possibility in
each moment of particularity.

691
00:42:14,571 --> 00:42:18,260
And that is what artists, that is what
great artists are reminding herself.

692
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,940
They'll take
a slice of space and time.

693
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,480
It was it money who painted the haystacks.

694
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:31,070
He went out into the fields in France and
he painted the same haystack like many,

695
00:42:31,071 --> 00:42:35,410
many times under different conditions of
lighting. And to show how different my,

696
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:39,050
if it's a, if it's a haystack,
it's the same thing, but it wasn't,

697
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:41,030
he paid attention to the particularities.

698
00:42:41,031 --> 00:42:44,630
And so what great artists are
trying to do is, well first of all,

699
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:48,020
so imagine the painting.
So it's a painting of a landscape.

700
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:53,380
And so the first thing is that it's layers
of time because the painter has gone

701
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:56,780
out there and seeing the landscape and
then seeing it again and then seeing it

702
00:42:56,781 --> 00:42:58,760
again and then seeing it again
and then seeing it again.

703
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:02,150
And it has to pay attention to the
particularities of the light and the color

704
00:43:02,151 --> 00:43:06,020
and all of that to represent
it properly. So it's and, and,

705
00:43:06,021 --> 00:43:09,090
and the mere fact that he's done that is,
it's,

706
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:14,160
it's the acting out of the idea that
in this tiny slice of time and space,

707
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:20,570
there's something worth attending
to for an infinite amount of time.

708
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,360
But you can't be because
you just can't do it.

709
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:26,870
But you need to know that you couldn't
do it and then it would be worthwhile.

710
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:31,730
And so the painter encapsulates
the landscape and then
frames that it says like,

711
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,653
look,

712
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:38,020
look through this window
at the transcendent that's
behind the low resolution

713
00:43:39,381 --> 00:43:42,560
representation of your assumption,
the blindness that you, the,

714
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:47,270
the expedient blindness that
you by necessity bring to
bear, to every situation.

715
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:51,260
Remember, what's behind this.
Always remember what's behind this.

716
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:52,820
And that's what art calls us to do.

717
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:57,410
That's what beauty calls us to do is to
make contact with that. And then you say,

718
00:43:57,411 --> 00:43:58,850
well,
the problem with the,

719
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:03,740
particularly the problem with the
particularly is that it brings suffering.

720
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:08,090
And the bringing of suffering
with particularly can also
allow evil to enter the

721
00:44:08,091 --> 00:44:12,620
world because that particular suffering
can engender bitterness and resentment

722
00:44:12,621 --> 00:44:15,170
and hatred and all of those things.
And the desire to destroy.

723
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:19,490
So the particularity carries with it a
tremendous risk and a tremendous burden.

724
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:21,650
And so the answer, the question is, well,

725
00:44:21,651 --> 00:44:25,790
how do you tolerate the particularity
and take advantage of the potential?

726
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:29,810
And the answer is to make a relationship
with the infinite that's behind the

727
00:44:29,811 --> 00:44:33,600
particularity. And that's the
fundamental religious idea is to,

728
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:37,020
if you can maintain the particularly,

729
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:42,380
but also stay in contact with what's
transcendent and infinite beyond that,

730
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:47,670
then you can then you have the potential
strengths to tolerate the catastrophe

731
00:44:47,671 --> 00:44:51,390
of what's limited and then you get
to have your cake and eat it too.

732
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,180
In principle.

733
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:55,930
Yes, yes. I want to return to
education in a moment, but,

734
00:44:56,170 --> 00:45:00,310
but on the way there, as it were.
Jordan, I want to ask you, uh,

735
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:04,360
you've, you've talked about
this, this the inflection point.

736
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:10,390
What is the inflection point and how
might it be understood relative to, uh,

737
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:13,810
what I would I take to be a very decadent,

738
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:18,940
a worldview in its last gasps?
It seems to me, even that, uh,

739
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:23,520
many of the, uh, frankly
simply slanderous, uh,

740
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:24,940
attacks on you personal,

741
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:29,320
personally blatant
misrepresentations of the,

742
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:34,330
the very plain fact what you're saying,

743
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:38,500
it seems to me that there's an
animus there that is precisely,

744
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:42,100
there's an animist there. But the
question is where is that coming from?

745
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:45,470
Well, we, if you look at
a Derrida for example,

746
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:49,570
and his critique of the idea of
logo centrism, you know, as, as the,

747
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,060
as the central Motif of the
West, let's say, and he,

748
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:58,540
and he knew at multiple levels what
that critique meant because he knew what

749
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:02,000
logos meant. Logos means embodied
truth. And there is of course,

750
00:46:02,001 --> 00:46:03,260
a religious dimension to that.

751
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:07,570
And so he was criticizing the
notion of fowl logo centrism and,

752
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:11,930
and so he was going right at the core
of the doctrine of the individual.

753
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:15,200
Now the question is, why
might someone do that? Now,

754
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:19,760
I think the reason for that
fundamentally is that there's a terrible

755
00:46:19,761 --> 00:46:23,830
responsibility that goes along with it.
So imagine that you offered people here,

756
00:46:23,831 --> 00:46:26,600
here's the offer.
Offer one.

757
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:30,990
You don't matter.
It's,

758
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:36,160
it's a really say the
narrowest of materialist view
points is you weren't here

759
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:39,920
then you were for a brief period
of time and then you're gone.

760
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:42,920
And that all washes out in
the endless sands of time.

761
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:46,970
Nothing in your life is significant.
Nothing about humanity is significant.

762
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,720
Nothing about the world itself is
significant. It's all a matter of blind,

763
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:53,300
random chance.
And it's all the same in the end.

764
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:56,840
Who cares in a million years,
right?

765
00:46:57,330 --> 00:47:00,530
And and the price you pay
for that is insignificance.

766
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:05,420
But the advantage that you gained from
that is that fundamentally you have no

767
00:47:05,421 --> 00:47:08,120
responsibility because
nothing you do matters.

768
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,170
And so then there's no moral burden.
There's no obligation. And of course,

769
00:47:12,171 --> 00:47:16,940
if you can gather expedient pleasure
while you're deteriorating pointlessly,

770
00:47:16,941 --> 00:47:21,290
then that's all to the good. So
it's, it's a libertinism as well.

771
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:25,490
And that's inviting obviously because
short term pleasure is by definition

772
00:47:25,491 --> 00:47:26,240
inviting.

773
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:30,970
And so you can abandon any pretension
to a relationship with the infinite.

774
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:34,060
And consider that only a sign
of delusion and weakness.

775
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:37,960
Assume that your life is material
and irrelevant. It doesn't matter.

776
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:42,970
And then you can shrug
off all responsibility and
pursue short term pleasure.

777
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:47,440
While there's some real advantages in
that, it's very, it's a very easy pathway.

778
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:51,730
The alternative is, as far as I'm
concerned, is no, you don't understand.

779
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:53,920
You are the,

780
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,960
you are the center of the
world as center of the world.

781
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:03,990
It has many centers and you do partake
in this process of casting the potential

782
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,650
of the future into the reality
of the present and the past.

783
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:10,630
That's what your consciousness does.

784
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:15,990
And the quality of what you
produce is dependent on your,

785
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,190
on the ethics of your choice.

786
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:22,720
Your choice between good and evil in
every moment is what determines the course

787
00:48:22,721 --> 00:48:26,950
of the world. And that's on you. It's
like, well, that's deeply meaningful,

788
00:48:26,951 --> 00:48:28,330
but it's unbelievable.

789
00:48:28,331 --> 00:48:32,200
It's in it's ultimate
responsibility in the literal sense.

790
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:35,320
And I think that in order
for us to set things right,

791
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:39,880
we have to understand that we have
to take on that burden of ultimate

792
00:48:39,881 --> 00:48:43,930
responsibility as if it's not
only as if it's ours, which it is,

793
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:47,230
but as if there isn't anything
better that we could do. And I,

794
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:50,290
and one of the things that I found so
gratifying about the lecture to her that

795
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:54,920
I've been doing is that and why keep doing
it. The live events in particular, um,

796
00:48:55,060 --> 00:49:00,060
cause we've done about 100 of them now
so far is that when I explained to the

797
00:49:00,131 --> 00:49:02,590
audiences,
and this is especially true,

798
00:49:02,591 --> 00:49:06,430
it's speed seems to be especially
true of of men but of young men,

799
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:11,620
but not so young even to
say, look, you have, you,

800
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:16,750
you have an ethical obligation to lift
the heaviest load you can possibly

801
00:49:17,351 --> 00:49:18,370
conceive of.

802
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:22,960
And that's the primary
call to adventure in life.

803
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:28,470
And that call to adventure
is so worthwhile that it
justifies the particularity.

804
00:49:29,921 --> 00:49:32,710
Everybody, it's like lights go
on and they think, oh, I see.

805
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:37,690
So you need a meaning to set against
the suffering and to protect you against

806
00:49:37,691 --> 00:49:40,780
that temptation towards men.
Malevolence you need that. Well,

807
00:49:40,781 --> 00:49:43,540
where's the meaning to be
found? Well, it's not happiness,

808
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:47,770
it's not short term pleasure. It's
not, it's not self development,

809
00:49:47,771 --> 00:49:51,790
it's not self esteem. It's none of
those things that are so focused on, on,

810
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,740
on the individual's psyche event.
It's,

811
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:58,510
it's literally the stumbling uphill
towards the city of God with your burden.

812
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,090
People go, well, that's
where the meaning is.

813
00:50:01,091 --> 00:50:04,510
And they know that because they
know responsible people, they know,

814
00:50:04,511 --> 00:50:08,380
they admire responsible people.
They already got that say, well,

815
00:50:08,381 --> 00:50:11,080
that's what you should be calm.
And they think, and not only that,

816
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:14,620
that's what you could become because
that's what you are in the deepest sense.

817
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:17,740
Yes. Yes. Would you, would
you say that, that, that,

818
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:20,920
that the antidote denialism is meaning?

819
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:26,530
And if so, uh, you know, I think you've
described yourself Jordan, as you've said,

820
00:50:26,531 --> 00:50:29,270
I think the surfer not the wave.

821
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:32,090
And I suppose I want to
ask you what is the wave,

822
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:35,140
because it seems to me where
it a moment of very great, uh,

823
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,390
cultural potential and it
could go any number of ways,

824
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:42,570
but that the very fact of
what one might call it,

825
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:46,250
the Jordan Peterson phenomenon,
a worldwide,

826
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:50,990
your book translated into
dozens of languages. Your
rec lecture halls packed, uh,

827
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:56,950
is a sign of a longing, a self
conscious longing for, for, for,

828
00:50:56,951 --> 00:50:59,330
for meaning. How would, how would you,

829
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,870
how would you describe what that
wave is that, that you didn't create,

830
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:06,290
but that you will start speaking
some of its technological? So,

831
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,980
so I would say that wave is,
it's got multiple levels and so,

832
00:51:09,981 --> 00:51:12,680
so we could start from,
well it will start from,

833
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:16,190
I would say what's most obvious and
that would be the medium rather than the

834
00:51:16,191 --> 00:51:20,870
message. So I, um, and these people
that I'd been associated with,

835
00:51:20,871 --> 00:51:23,210
this intellectual, dark web group, we're,

836
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:26,600
we're in the fortunate position of
being early adopters of extraordinarily

837
00:51:26,601 --> 00:51:30,590
powerful technologies. So, and, and
the technologies are twofold. There's,

838
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,800
there's online video and
then there's podcasts.

839
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:37,880
And so they're technologically
revolutionary in a variety of ways.

840
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:43,060
So online video is revolutionary because
it brings something closely akin to a

841
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:49,271
live performance to an infinitely large
number of people on demand permanently.

842
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:55,550
So then you think, well, what's the
advantage of a book? Well, it's permanent.

843
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,290
It's relatively low cost. It's
easily distributable. Right. So what,

844
00:52:00,291 --> 00:52:03,770
what's the advantage to online
video? Well, it's, it's inexpensive.

845
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:08,540
It's not inexpensive. It's free. It's
far easier to produce than a book.

846
00:52:08,541 --> 00:52:12,410
Like the lag time from video
to publication is the day.

847
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:16,850
Like we can put this online today
instead of the three year lag that a book

848
00:52:16,851 --> 00:52:21,230
would require and then far more
people can watch and listen,

849
00:52:21,231 --> 00:52:26,150
then can read because reading
is a minority ability and
in some sense really fat,

850
00:52:26,530 --> 00:52:28,430
real expert level reading.

851
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:32,120
You know that because such a tiny minority
of people buy books and people are

852
00:52:32,121 --> 00:52:34,760
made uncomfortable by books,
they're intimidated by them.

853
00:52:34,761 --> 00:52:37,790
Even if they have the intelligence
in principle to do the reading,

854
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:41,480
it's not part of their cultural mill.
You, that's a small minority of people.

855
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:44,900
And so all of a sudden
online video allows,

856
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,670
allows the spoken word to have the
same impact as the written word.

857
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,220
And that's deadly.
That's a good and Berg Revolution.

858
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:57,520
And then with podcasts
that's even magnified because
you don't have to sit and

859
00:52:57,981 --> 00:53:02,210
watch a podcast. You can walk around,
you can exercise, you can do the dishes,

860
00:53:02,211 --> 00:53:03,530
you can,
you can drive.

861
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:08,620
Many people who come to my lectures are
like long haul truckers and guys who run

862
00:53:08,631 --> 00:53:13,580
forklifts and you know they're in their
machinery all day and all they do is

863
00:53:13,581 --> 00:53:18,500
listen to podcasts and so all of us and
they can listen to the podcasts because

864
00:53:18,501 --> 00:53:22,530
more people can listen, then can read
and maybe way more people can listen,

865
00:53:22,531 --> 00:53:23,870
then can read.
We have no idea,

866
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:28,800
maybe the potential market 10 times as
big and so they can do it when they want

867
00:53:28,801 --> 00:53:32,580
to. They can also do it in private.
If you read and you're on the subway,

868
00:53:32,581 --> 00:53:33,870
people can tell you're reading.

869
00:53:33,871 --> 00:53:36,570
If you're sitting at home and reading
well then you're with a book and if you're

870
00:53:36,571 --> 00:53:37,770
uncomfortable with a book,

871
00:53:37,771 --> 00:53:41,340
you think that's pretentious
or presumptuous or part
of a class that you don't

872
00:53:41,341 --> 00:53:44,400
belong to or anything that
makes you feel inferior. Well,

873
00:53:44,401 --> 00:53:49,320
you can just circumvent that you listened
in private and so people and people

874
00:53:49,321 --> 00:53:53,500
are taking that opportunity like mad.
And so that's part of the way it's,

875
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:58,140
let's say that technological revolution
in communication that's illustrated that

876
00:53:58,141 --> 00:54:01,890
people have far more depth and capacity
to concentrate that anyone would have

877
00:54:01,891 --> 00:54:05,190
imagined.
You didn't see this with Netflix and HBO,

878
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:06,900
it used to be on TV.

879
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:10,350
There was an idea that while movie
was about as long as you could attract

880
00:54:10,351 --> 00:54:12,030
people's attention for 90 minutes,

881
00:54:12,031 --> 00:54:15,180
that's the most the typical
person could concentrate for.

882
00:54:15,181 --> 00:54:17,280
It's like that turned out
to be complete rubbish.

883
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:22,350
People will follow these incredibly
complex like literary level net narratives

884
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:23,790
breaking bad,
for example,

885
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:27,810
that has multiple characters following
multiple streams of development for,

886
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:30,900
for endless hours and
they'll binge watch it.

887
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:35,490
So we have way more capacity for sustained
concentration that we thought and

888
00:54:35,491 --> 00:54:40,170
these new bandwidth unlimited
technologies are revealing that to us.

889
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:43,650
And I happened to be an early
adopter of this and so that's,

890
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:46,710
that's part one of the wave.
And then,

891
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:51,870
then there's the message part and it has
something to do with cr culture for a

892
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:56,250
very long time has articulated
out a a right of rights.

893
00:54:56,310 --> 00:55:00,150
You have rights, you need to demand them,
you need to claim them. It's like, but,

894
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:01,620
but that's,
that's,

895
00:55:01,621 --> 00:55:06,621
that's half the story and it's not the
most salutary half because it turns out

896
00:55:06,691 --> 00:55:11,170
that the meaning in your life isn't the
consequence of the claiming of rights.

897
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:14,220
The rights are in some sense
what other people owe you.

898
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:17,850
I know there's more to it than that,
but, but it's that in large part. Well,

899
00:55:17,851 --> 00:55:20,490
you can just get what
you're owed. It's like, no,

900
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,830
that's not where you're going to find
your meaning. What you're going to find,

901
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,400
where you're going to find
your meaning is responsibility,

902
00:55:26,401 --> 00:55:29,400
which is the other half of the
rights responsibility equation.

903
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:34,380
And people don't know that this
is the, the, the, the, the, that,

904
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,540
what would you call,
this is where,

905
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:39,660
this is where this is the point
where things come together properly.

906
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:43,560
You need a meaning in your life to
forestall the suffering and to make you

907
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:47,790
strong enough to resist malevolence
where's the meaning to be found? Rights,

908
00:55:47,791 --> 00:55:52,200
impulsive, pleasure and
happiness. No responsibility.

909
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,360
Oh,
who would have guessed that?

910
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:59,220
It's not part of the narrative because
the responsibility narrative even is

911
00:55:59,221 --> 00:56:02,760
usually about duty or patriotism or
something like that, which which is okay,

912
00:56:02,761 --> 00:56:06,360
but it's, it's, it's an ideological
narrative too in its own right.

913
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,790
This is different. It's like, no,

914
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:13,791
you don't understand is that what makes
life worth living is to pick up the p

915
00:56:14,550 --> 00:56:18,660
two two to take it's kits,
task atrophy,

916
00:56:18,661 --> 00:56:23,661
and embrace it and carry it and to
realize through that who you are.

917
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,370
So one of the things I figured
out in this lecture tour,

918
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:31,840
there's this old idea that you go into
the abyss and to Nietzsche and idea that

919
00:56:31,841 --> 00:56:32,980
you can gaze into the abyss.

920
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:36,760
You gaze long and what you
find in the abyss is a monster.

921
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:40,120
Tolstoy wrote about that. That's the
dragon at the bottom of the abyss.

922
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:44,380
Let's say that Satan himself for that
matter. And, but if you go into that,

923
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:49,330
into that as deeply as you can, what
you find is your, you find, you find,

924
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,160
you find your, your, your,

925
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:54,940
your fragmented father in a,

926
00:56:54,941 --> 00:56:59,760
in a comatose condition, in a, in
a, in a, in a desiccated and, and,

927
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:04,600
and separated condition. And
then you revivify that. Well,

928
00:57:04,601 --> 00:57:06,490
what does that mean?
It means something.

929
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:09,400
It means that if you look in the darkness,
you find the light.

930
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:10,540
That's one thing it means,

931
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,210
and that the light really
stands out against the darkness.

932
00:57:13,211 --> 00:57:16,990
But the light is to be found
in the darkness. So that's
a very interesting thing.

933
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:19,780
That's a quest narrative,
but it means more than that.

934
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,750
It means something fundamental.
So we know, for example,

935
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:27,070
that if you take yourself
out of your current state of,

936
00:57:27,850 --> 00:57:32,320
of predictability and safety,
and you put yourself in a new situation,

937
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:36,160
you'll learn, right? You'll observe,
you'll incorporate new information.

938
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,370
So that's a cognitive issue.
But that isn't all that happens.

939
00:57:39,371 --> 00:57:44,320
What happens is that new genes turn on
within you and code for the production of

940
00:57:44,321 --> 00:57:49,180
new proteins that happens neurologically.
New parts of you turn on.

941
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:53,740
And so the idea is that if you can move
yourself out into the world and push

942
00:57:53,741 --> 00:57:56,860
yourself out against a
maximum array of challenges,

943
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:01,660
more and more of you turn
on turns on into, and then
the question would be, well,

944
00:58:01,661 --> 00:58:06,280
what would you be if all of you that
could be turned on was turned on?

945
00:58:06,281 --> 00:58:10,330
And the answer would be, you would be
the resurrection of the ancestral father.

946
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:11,800
That's what you would be.

947
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:15,760
And so that's why Christ says I am
the way and the truth and the life,

948
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,400
and no one comes to the
father except through me.

949
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:23,490
What that means is that if you take
on the unbearable burden of being

950
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:28,240
voluntarily, then that transforms
you into the ancestral father.

951
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:29,770
And that's true.

952
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:34,600
And so that's unbelievably optimistic
because what it is so interesting because

953
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:37,330
it's, it's dark beyond
belief rights to say, well,

954
00:58:37,331 --> 00:58:41,250
the world is characterized by suffering
and by malevolence of a depth that's

955
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:44,830
virtually beyond comprehension.
But if you choose to comprehend that,

956
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:49,900
what you discover in that is the
light that destroys the darkness.

957
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:54,650
And that's, well, that's announced really
something to discover. It's, it's, uh,

958
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:56,043
it's,

959
00:58:56,620 --> 00:59:00,670
it's the discovery that there isn't a
discovery that's more profound in that

960
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:04,510
that's the search for the holy grail or
the philosopher's stone, all of that.

961
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:05,381
It isn't that the,

962
00:59:05,381 --> 00:59:09,940
isn't that the search and
indeed the finding that every
human being is made for.

963
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:14,680
Um, what I want to ask you, Jordan,
is about the role of education here.

964
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:16,060
So it seems to me that,

965
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:20,770
that what the meaning that people are
finding in your work that you can listen

966
00:59:20,771 --> 00:59:25,640
to in podcast. You can, you can, you can,
while you're doing a long run, uh, uh,

967
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:29,030
drive, uh, across the prairies
or wherever it may be.

968
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:32,780
But it seems to me that,
that the,

969
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:37,920
the deconstruction of our culture by a
world view that has denied the integrity

970
00:59:39,171 --> 00:59:44,060
of the individual that has denied the
individual's relation to the transcendent,

971
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:49,070
to any stable, knowing, denied
the dignity of the individual,

972
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:52,610
that, that deconstruction. It's
not for no reason that the, uh,

973
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:57,410
the postmodern view calls
itself deconstruction that
has very deconstructive

974
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:02,370
effects in my view, in the world. It seems
to me that the rebirth of, uh, or the,

975
01:00:02,470 --> 01:00:07,470
the renaissance of a more adequate to
more fully human culture depends on more

976
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:12,680
than, um, it depends on
institutional life. We need
cultural forms. We architecture,

977
01:00:12,681 --> 01:00:17,600
there's all kinds of, uh, fully
a full culture is a complex, uh,

978
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:22,520
uh, an infinitely complex
structure. Uh, but I think we've,

979
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,630
we've as it were,

980
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:28,190
deleted out the memory banks
in so many profound ways.

981
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:31,820
And so what I'm, what I'd like to ask you
about is the still have the libraries.

982
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:34,430
We still have the libraries. Well,
thank God for that. Thank God for that.

983
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:37,430
And this is where I want to turn to
education because you say in, uh, uh,

984
01:00:37,431 --> 01:00:42,170
at one point you say that that we need
to rescue the treasure trove of the past,

985
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:43,051
the Chinese restaurant.

986
01:00:43,051 --> 01:00:46,610
He rescued the values of the treasure
trove of the past and integrate them.

987
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:49,630
And I suppose I'd like to ask you
about the rules of the university

988
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:54,440
these are for, is to remind people
to, to, to lead people to doing that.

989
01:00:54,441 --> 01:00:54,890
I mean,

990
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:58,130
we wandered around Cambridge today and
you showed me King's chapel for example,

991
01:00:58,131 --> 01:01:02,270
which is so beautiful that it's just
beyond belief. And that's a call, right?

992
01:01:02,271 --> 01:01:04,810
That's it's a call to a mode of being.
And it's a,

993
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:08,810
Socrates believed that all
learning was remembering. And,

994
01:01:08,850 --> 01:01:13,850
and it's true in the sense that we just
discussed is that through encounter with

995
01:01:13,851 --> 01:01:15,890
the tragedy of life and
the malevolence of life,

996
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:19,820
that that more of you will come to
manifest itself. But that can be,

997
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:25,000
that can be facilitated
by your incorporation of
the greatness of the past.

998
01:01:26,061 --> 01:01:28,190
So you say, well, each great philosopher,

999
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:32,600
each great thinker is a fragment
of the ultimate ancestral being.

1000
01:01:32,601 --> 01:01:35,540
It's a fragment of, of
God the father, let's say.

1001
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:39,890
And you get a fragment from Nicha and
you get a fragment from Plato and you get

1002
01:01:39,891 --> 01:01:43,670
a fragment from Vichtenstein and you get
a fragment from Shakespeare and, and,

1003
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:46,400
and there's something,
imagine this,

1004
01:01:46,401 --> 01:01:49,430
there's something that makes
all those people great.

1005
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:53,600
It's whatever greatness is
and it's broken up apart.

1006
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:57,710
It's broken up across all of them.
But if you went, if you experience,

1007
01:01:57,711 --> 01:02:02,320
if you're exposed to each of them,
then you absorb what's your,

1008
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:07,220
you're exposed to and have the
possibility to imitate it and absorb that

1009
01:02:07,221 --> 01:02:12,170
greatness across its, its fragmentation
across many people. And then you can,

1010
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:14,360
that can come to awaken that within you.

1011
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:18,230
And that is the purpose of
the universities. And the
reason for that, it isn't,

1012
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:22,770
it isn't something casual. It's like,
well it's, it's, it's good to be more.

1013
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:25,350
If you go to university and
you take a humanities degree,

1014
01:02:25,351 --> 01:02:29,250
you'll come out more well rounded. You
know, that's, that's not the, that's not,

1015
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:32,760
it's such, it's such a weak way
of putting it. It's that no,

1016
01:02:32,761 --> 01:02:36,300
you wake up and realize who you are and
then you're ready to take the world on

1017
01:02:36,301 --> 01:02:39,120
your shoulders.
And that's what the universities are here.

1018
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:41,910
And that's what students,
students are dying for. That,

1019
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:46,110
that's why men are abandoning
the universities is because
that call isn't there.

1020
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:49,490
Yes. Well there's just no answer
to the call. You might say the,

1021
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:52,190
it seems to me that the
wave is the longing,

1022
01:02:52,370 --> 01:02:54,140
the longing for that call to be answered.

1023
01:02:54,141 --> 01:02:57,220
And it seems to be that
there are universities that
have failed us and utterly

1024
01:02:57,230 --> 01:03:00,780
failed. They're antithetical.
Do you might call them the,

1025
01:03:00,781 --> 01:03:04,870
the water main that is distributing
a worldview that is corrosive of,

1026
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:09,860
of, of, of, of what is best in the human
being? Well, the, the, the doctrine.

1027
01:03:09,861 --> 01:03:12,670
So one of the fundamental
doctrines of the,

1028
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:17,290
of the collectivists leftist,
especially on the feminist end of things,

1029
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:21,250
is the idea that western culture
is a patriarchal tyranny.

1030
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:23,710
And so first of all, we could say, well,

1031
01:03:23,711 --> 01:03:28,711
that's inappropriate psychologically
because the way that you represent culture

1032
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,630
architecturally is with the
tyrant and the wise king.

1033
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:35,200
And so you can say that there's
the tyrant and that's always true.

1034
01:03:35,201 --> 01:03:38,590
But you also have to say that there's
the wise king, but there's no wise king.

1035
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:43,720
There's only a tyrant. Okay. And that
tyrant is, that's all men. It's all male.

1036
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:47,620
And so, and so then, and so
that's a view of history, right?

1037
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:50,260
Is that the view of history is that,
well,

1038
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:54,460
women have been the primary force of
oppression in relationship to women

1039
01:03:54,461 --> 01:03:55,750
throughout history has been men.

1040
01:03:55,930 --> 01:04:00,930
No idea about the cooperative endeavor
of men and women or their mutual desire

1041
01:04:01,661 --> 01:04:03,250
to lift each other out of misery,

1042
01:04:03,251 --> 01:04:06,850
which is a much more accurate way of
representing history and a much more

1043
01:04:06,970 --> 01:04:09,220
grateful, inappropriate way. None of that.

1044
01:04:09,221 --> 01:04:13,210
No one's a patriarchal tyranny and
men are responsible. Okay, well,

1045
01:04:13,211 --> 01:04:15,070
so where does that leave young men?
Well,

1046
01:04:15,071 --> 01:04:19,990
let's say young men are attempting to
manifest competence in the world and to

1047
01:04:19,991 --> 01:04:23,290
become good people. Well, there's
no good and there's no competence.

1048
01:04:23,291 --> 01:04:26,110
There's only power and it's
related to the patriarchal tyranny.

1049
01:04:26,380 --> 01:04:29,980
And so that conflation
of competence with power,

1050
01:04:29,981 --> 01:04:33,370
which is an absolutely
pathological move in my estimation,

1051
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:38,700
is also the desire to discourage
and to devalue and to destroy.

1052
01:04:39,841 --> 01:04:43,480
And partly it's based on fear
because the idea would be, well,

1053
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:47,800
a fully fledged man is nothing but a
powerful tyrant and therefore dangerous,

1054
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:51,370
better to emasculate him completely.
So it's nothing but harmless.

1055
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:54,430
Even though he's useless,
he can't do anything that's bad,

1056
01:04:54,670 --> 01:04:58,480
which is an unbelievably horrifying,
that's the castrating mother,

1057
01:04:58,481 --> 01:05:02,440
the Friday and castrating mother.
That's the terrible element of, of the,

1058
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:05,620
of the female body politic.
That's the evil queen.

1059
01:05:05,621 --> 01:05:09,970
That's the counterpart to the evil
king. Something we never talk about. So,

1060
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:14,590
and that's what's facing young men is
that at least they're discouraged from

1061
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:19,600
becoming what they could be. Um,
yeah, at least they're not encouraged,

1062
01:05:19,601 --> 01:05:22,690
but it's worse than that.
They're actively discouraged.

1063
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:24,700
And so the universities have become,

1064
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:30,300
they've become institutions of active
discouragement and especially for men.

1065
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:32,410
And so what's the consequence of that?
Well,

1066
01:05:32,411 --> 01:05:35,710
especially in the humanities and
social sciences. Well, it's obvious.

1067
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:39,310
All you have to do is look at the
statistics. All the men are leaving.

1068
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:43,240
There won't be a man left
in the humanities and social
sciences in 15 years at

1069
01:05:43,241 --> 01:05:46,900
the current rate of, of gender
transformation of the disciplines.

1070
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:51,850
And then you see this equally appalling
phenomena occurring phenomenon occurring,

1071
01:05:51,851 --> 01:05:56,851
which is that virtually all of the female
dominated disciplines are politically

1072
01:05:57,281 --> 01:05:58,060
correct.

1073
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:01,990
And I think that the reason for that is
that the reasonable women don't know how

1074
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:04,420
to regulate the behavior
of the unreasonable women.

1075
01:06:04,930 --> 01:06:09,930
The benevolent queen can't regulate the
evil queen and that and that hatred for

1076
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:13,090
the patriarchy.

1077
01:06:13,091 --> 01:06:17,710
That's the feminist part of the
postmodern neo Marxist monster is,

1078
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:22,480
is has decided that he masculine
[inaudible] and weak men are preferable to

1079
01:06:22,481 --> 01:06:23,710
tyrants and,
but,

1080
01:06:23,711 --> 01:06:26,410
and those are the only options because
there's no such thing as genuine

1081
01:06:26,411 --> 01:06:29,560
competence. What do you want to
call young men forward to do?

1082
01:06:29,561 --> 01:06:31,270
Is to take their place and say,
look,

1083
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:35,170
you have to understand
it's not just about you,

1084
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:38,950
is the world will be a lesser
place without, without that,

1085
01:06:38,951 --> 01:06:42,490
which you could reveal to it
because of your particular rarity.

1086
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:47,760
And that whole that you leave by the
absence of your presence is going to be

1087
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:51,250
filled with something terrible,
not just something neutral,

1088
01:06:51,251 --> 01:06:54,940
but something terrible. And
that's on you. And so you, you,

1089
01:06:54,941 --> 01:06:58,750
you have a calling that's,
that's vital. And, and people,

1090
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:01,750
people need that. They are die. They die.

1091
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:02,750
Yes.
Yes.

1092
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:06,200
It seems to me that the ideology that's
dominant and very much of the university

1093
01:07:06,410 --> 01:07:08,900
is not only destructive
and all these ways,

1094
01:07:08,901 --> 01:07:13,901
but chess boring and that it's patent
inadequacy to our deepest human longings,

1095
01:07:16,761 --> 01:07:18,500
male, female of, of,

1096
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:23,501
of all of all races and kinds that the
deep transcendent longings that we all

1097
01:07:23,661 --> 01:07:27,020
have, the need for self
longing, for self knowledge,

1098
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:29,670
that that idiotic elegy is,

1099
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:33,090
it is patently inadequate
to at satisfaction.

1100
01:07:33,091 --> 01:07:35,630
And what I see in young people
today, many, many young pills,

1101
01:07:35,631 --> 01:07:39,140
I know you see this in the
thousands that you encounter is,

1102
01:07:39,141 --> 01:07:42,620
is they're not interested in
fighting some cultural war.

1103
01:07:42,770 --> 01:07:47,420
They simply want to discover
the deepest truth of themselves.

1104
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:51,710
And, um, so I want to ask you a little
bit about, about the role of education.

1105
01:07:51,711 --> 01:07:54,200
We talked about the lighting up and the,
the awakening,

1106
01:07:54,410 --> 01:07:57,350
the encounter with depth
and truth. Um, you know,

1107
01:07:58,070 --> 01:08:02,810
there's a certain kind of abstract view
of education as though it's a kind of

1108
01:08:02,811 --> 01:08:06,170
inert process. So you're just sort
of downloading into the, into the,

1109
01:08:06,171 --> 01:08:10,710
into the mind. But in fact,
the nature, yeah, sure. Of

1110
01:08:10,710 --> 01:08:15,110
our, of our, of our, of our,
the nature of our souls is that,

1111
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:16,130
that it's

1112
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:20,510
an, it's a dynamic reality. You know,
the room who's not just the room,

1113
01:08:20,511 --> 01:08:23,300
it's the place in which you would, you
encounter yourself in the, in, in the,

1114
01:08:23,301 --> 01:08:24,560
in the rule of clean up your room.

1115
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:27,290
But it seems to me that
that's what's going on in, in,

1116
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:29,000
in all education at its best,

1117
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:33,110
and that it's not enough simply for the
library to be there. Their needs there,

1118
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:36,360
certain mediation of the institution.
So for example, we could have,

1119
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:39,470
there's a piano in the other side of
this room, you know, we could say, well,

1120
01:08:39,471 --> 01:08:43,070
there's a piano, you're free to play the
piano. Uh, but I, I can't play the piano.

1121
01:08:43,071 --> 01:08:44,970
I don't know the cords and the
scales. I haven't, I haven't.

1122
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:49,950
And yet if I, if I, if I did all that,

1123
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:55,520
then what I can make happen on the piano
is infinitely richer than if I've never

1124
01:08:56,251 --> 01:08:58,500
learned to play the piano.
And I suppose,

1125
01:08:58,590 --> 01:09:01,530
I suppose when we talk about rescuing
the values of the treasure trove

1126
01:09:01,590 --> 01:09:05,550
discipline as the precondition
for freedom. Yes. Right?
Which is, which is, uh,

1127
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:07,950
which is actually a Nietzschean idea,
at least in part.

1128
01:09:07,951 --> 01:09:10,110
I mean it's older than that.
It's the apprenticeship idea.

1129
01:09:10,111 --> 01:09:12,510
It's that it's that before,

1130
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:17,340
before you can be a painter who can
paint what's beyond mere memory,

1131
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,640
you, you have to inculcate
that discipline skill.

1132
01:09:20,641 --> 01:09:25,641
And a lot of that is painful
repetition and hard grinding work.

1133
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:30,600
It's the sacrifice of the present for
the future. But once you manage that,

1134
01:09:30,601 --> 01:09:34,440
then things open up and virtually
everything you learn to value is like,

1135
01:09:34,441 --> 01:09:39,060
that's very, very, very difficult to
learn to write. And there's arbitrary,

1136
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:42,750
arbitrary rules that you have
to follow and bind yourself to.

1137
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:44,430
And while you're learning those rules,

1138
01:09:44,431 --> 01:09:48,720
the probability that you have any creative
freedom to speak of or any facility

1139
01:09:48,721 --> 01:09:52,740
with the rules is very low. You're
a, you're a rank beginner and,

1140
01:09:53,010 --> 01:09:54,570
and even to some degree,

1141
01:09:54,571 --> 01:09:58,140
whatever creativity you have is
going to have to be stifled. Well,

1142
01:09:58,141 --> 01:10:02,790
you're passing through that, that
key hole. But if you pass through it,

1143
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:05,340
then something massive
opens up on the other side.

1144
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:09,480
And it is definitely the case
that disciplinary institutions,

1145
01:10:09,481 --> 01:10:13,410
universities are exactly that
is their places of guidance and,

1146
01:10:13,470 --> 01:10:17,670
and their places to encourage people to
develop the discipline that's necessary

1147
01:10:17,671 --> 01:10:21,720
to see beyond the discipline. I mean
that's why we have disciplines, right?

1148
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:23,850
I mean the words aren't there by accident.

1149
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:27,810
You have to narrow yourself first
and then you can broaden outward.

1150
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:31,890
And so that's, and that's part of the
process of maturation, that part of the,

1151
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:34,020
that's part of the sacrifice of childhood.

1152
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:37,320
Say in childhood you're
nothing but potential,

1153
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,990
but it's not realized and you
don't know how to realize it.

1154
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:41,460
And so then the question is,
well,

1155
01:10:41,461 --> 01:10:43,920
how do you get to a point where
you realize the potential?

1156
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:47,940
And the answer is you sacrifice almost
all of it to a single direction.

1157
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,050
This is niches,

1158
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:52,680
commentary on the Catholic Church because
he a great admirer of the Catholic

1159
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:56,220
Church, despite the fact that
he was also a radical critic.

1160
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,790
Critic of Christianity said the cow.

1161
01:10:59,090 --> 01:11:03,270
The thing about the Catholic church
is that it forced everything to be

1162
01:11:03,271 --> 01:11:06,540
interpreted within a single
explanatory framework.

1163
01:11:06,780 --> 01:11:11,010
And that was a discipline.
And once that discipline was established,

1164
01:11:11,011 --> 01:11:14,250
then the discipline mind
could in every direction,

1165
01:11:14,251 --> 01:11:17,360
which is precisely what
happened. And so, and, and,

1166
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:21,390
and that's the thing about growing up is
that when you're a teenager and a young

1167
01:11:21,391 --> 01:11:23,820
adult,
you have to sacrifice everything.

1168
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:27,750
You could have been as a child to be
the one thing that you're aiming at.

1169
01:11:28,170 --> 01:11:32,250
But then that opens up and
the universities are part
and parcel of that process

1170
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:35,660
and you need the guidance because the,
the,

1171
01:11:35,810 --> 01:11:40,740
the library is too large to wonder
through it unaided. Yes. And that,

1172
01:11:40,741 --> 01:11:44,620
and I think that comes down to, to the,
to the question of, of what you need to,

1173
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:49,220
what are, what are the books that can be
read to be transformative. I mean we, we,

1174
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:50,700
you know, the, the,

1175
01:11:50,701 --> 01:11:54,450
the otherness that realizes in
that awakens and opens up the self,

1176
01:11:54,451 --> 01:11:58,110
that light that turns those lights on
is not just a random otherness. I mean,

1177
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:01,770
you can look at a brick wall
all day and never get anything.

1178
01:12:01,771 --> 01:12:06,660
Like would we get by looking at the
king's chapel that we just came from a few

1179
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:08,190
minutes ago, that, that the,

1180
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:12,660
the levels of pattern and depths and
beauty that are present in that building,

1181
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:20,030
that's a kind of metaphor
for what the most wonderful,

1182
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:23,760
most contexts of our own,

1183
01:12:24,210 --> 01:12:28,410
of our own past offered to us. You know,
they're, they are lying on the shelf,

1184
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:32,280
but when opened up,
uh, and explored fully,

1185
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:35,130
they open up in us the,
there are portals.

1186
01:12:35,370 --> 01:12:40,290
So I suppose in my book a book
isn't a paper. Yes, that's
you, that's your memory.

1187
01:12:40,291 --> 01:12:44,580
That's your perception of the book. It's
a portal. Yes. And, and, and you know,

1188
01:12:44,581 --> 01:12:47,580
one of the ideas,
the postmodern idea is that well,

1189
01:12:47,581 --> 01:12:51,420
there's no canon and if there is a
canon and it's only there to support the

1190
01:12:51,421 --> 01:12:54,630
tyrannical patriarchy because of
course the tyrannical patriarchy is the

1191
01:12:54,631 --> 01:12:55,620
explanation for everything.

1192
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:58,290
But I've been trying to solve
that problem technically with,

1193
01:12:58,650 --> 01:13:02,850
I have a small staff that trying to
produce an educational system online and

1194
01:13:02,851 --> 01:13:06,330
we'd been trying to understand, well
what is it that makes a book canonical?

1195
01:13:06,450 --> 01:13:08,190
There's actually a
technical answer to that.

1196
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:12,840
So you imagine that books exist
in relationship to one another.

1197
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,660
That's a perfectly reasonable
postmodernist claim by the way.

1198
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:18,150
Books exist in relationship
to one another. Okay,

1199
01:13:18,151 --> 01:13:21,450
well some books have hardly any
relationship to other books.

1200
01:13:22,410 --> 01:13:25,890
Those are trivial books. Now they
might be undiscovered works of genius.

1201
01:13:25,891 --> 01:13:28,080
That's another possibility
if there recently written,

1202
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:32,100
but it doesn't matter because you can't
separate the wheat from the chaff at

1203
01:13:32,101 --> 01:13:34,470
present. It's too difficult.
There's too much chaff.

1204
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:36,330
But if you go back into the past,

1205
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:40,650
you can rank order books by the degree
to which they've influenced other books.

1206
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:43,560
So it's like citations in some sense.

1207
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:47,460
And the books that have influenced the
largest number of other books are the

1208
01:13:47,461 --> 01:13:50,010
canonical books and the
ultimate canonical book.

1209
01:13:50,011 --> 01:13:53,580
And the West is clearly the biblical
corpus because it's influenced virtually

1210
01:13:53,581 --> 01:13:54,091
everything.

1211
01:13:54,091 --> 01:13:58,710
And so you have to know it because
it's implicit in everything else.

1212
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:01,080
And so you start there
and so you have that,

1213
01:14:01,410 --> 01:14:05,730
you have that knowledge at least to some
degree. And it gives you the foundation,

1214
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:09,090
the metaphorical foundation,
the conceptual foundation,

1215
01:14:09,091 --> 01:14:11,950
the mythical foundation
that you can use to then,

1216
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:15,760
well maybe you can now that now
Shakespeare opens up to some degree of now

1217
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:19,870
Milton opens up to some degree in Dante,
opens up to some degree and you think,

1218
01:14:19,871 --> 01:14:19,991
well,

1219
01:14:19,991 --> 01:14:24,991
why should those open up and answer as
well as the social constructionist claim?

1220
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:29,680
You're at least in part
a historical creature.

1221
01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:33,280
Well then those books are about you.
They're the,

1222
01:14:33,370 --> 01:14:37,210
the patterns in those books are the
patterns of your perceptions and your

1223
01:14:37,211 --> 01:14:40,660
actions. And without understanding
them, then you don't know who you are.

1224
01:14:40,661 --> 01:14:45,180
And you can't guide yourself properly
through life. And so you, you,

1225
01:14:45,210 --> 01:14:48,490
you come into university and you
encounter experts and they say, look,

1226
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:50,890
this is canonical.
Why?

1227
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:55,150
Because it's had a disproportionate
influence on everything else. So you need,

1228
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:59,050
there's something here that you need to
know about because it's about you. And,

1229
01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:01,180
and it isn't about the
you that's here now.

1230
01:15:01,181 --> 01:15:05,080
In some sense it's about the you
that can unfold across time in the,

1231
01:15:05,081 --> 01:15:09,430
in the best possible way. So each of
those works is a call to adventure.

1232
01:15:09,790 --> 01:15:13,870
Every painting that's a great painting
or a building like that. King's chapel.

1233
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:17,410
If that's not a call to adventure,
I mean, what else could it be?

1234
01:15:17,530 --> 01:15:20,680
We were talking about that.
So these ancient buildings,

1235
01:15:20,681 --> 01:15:23,860
these great ancient buildings
that Europe is littered with,

1236
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:28,270
these were people would, we're aiming
at something beyond themselves,

1237
01:15:28,271 --> 01:15:30,090
beyond the span of their lifetime.
They,

1238
01:15:30,370 --> 01:15:34,900
they engaged in the co the collective
manifestation of these great works to aim,

1239
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:39,700
to, to, to participate in aiming something
that at something that was beyond them.

1240
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:42,000
It was a divine aim.
They had that,

1241
01:15:42,190 --> 01:15:46,930
that will to produce this beauty
that transcended centuries. You know,

1242
01:15:46,931 --> 01:15:50,440
and maybe the will that produces
beauty is always aligned with that,

1243
01:15:50,441 --> 01:15:54,130
which transcends centuries. Maybe those
are the same things. He even paintings,

1244
01:15:54,131 --> 01:15:55,360
oil paintings, you know, they,

1245
01:15:55,630 --> 01:16:00,630
they take a moment in time and they cast
it into a permanent form that can be,

1246
01:16:01,180 --> 01:16:04,750
it can be preserved across centuries.
And so there's something about,

1247
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:09,940
there's something about the establishing
a relationship with eternity that's key

1248
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:12,100
to the construction of
something that's beautiful.

1249
01:16:12,101 --> 01:16:16,900
And then that in itself becomes a call
to a relationship with an eternity. So,

1250
01:16:16,901 --> 01:16:21,190
and you need that people hunger for it.
I'm at the University of Toronto,

1251
01:16:21,191 --> 01:16:25,420
there's the, the, there's the European
cathedrals side of the campus,

1252
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:26,350
the older part.

1253
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:31,660
And then there's the modern factory side
of the campus and it's sold deadening.

1254
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:36,130
My building is made out of cinder blocks,
you know, and my, my brother in law,

1255
01:16:36,131 --> 01:16:39,490
who's his own sort of genius
calls that hosel architecture,

1256
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:43,490
anything could happen there and you
could wash it away. And it's like,

1257
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:45,610
and it's just, it's, it's, it's,

1258
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:49,840
I have my students now and then sit in
a classroom like that and look at it and

1259
01:16:49,841 --> 01:16:54,550
tell me how it makes them feel. Random
wires hanging from the ceiling, you know,

1260
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:57,520
nothing but cinderblock the
cheapest form of construction.

1261
01:16:57,521 --> 01:16:59,950
Nothing that's beautiful, pure, boring,

1262
01:16:59,951 --> 01:17:04,951
dull utilitarianism with these bare
shiny desks and terrible fluorescent

1263
01:17:05,471 --> 01:17:09,980
lighting. It's like it's ugly, right to
the core and it, and it's corrosive. It

1264
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:11,720
eats away at the heart of the university,

1265
01:17:11,721 --> 01:17:15,040
which is about the beauty that's eternal.
And,

1266
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:19,160
and that isn't optional.
It's not impractical. It's,

1267
01:17:19,161 --> 01:17:21,920
it's the most practical. It's, it's,

1268
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:26,030
it's that upon which the idea of
practicality itself is predicated.

1269
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:27,830
And that's the university.

1270
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:32,630
And people should be flocking to the
university's dying to be educated because

1271
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:34,220
they are dying to be educated.

1272
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:39,400
I have dozens of young men who come to
me all the time after my talks and say,

1273
01:17:39,681 --> 01:17:44,000
look, they give me a note. When
did last night, here's the note,

1274
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:48,860
six weeks, six months ago, I was deeply
suicidal. I had no reason to live.

1275
01:17:48,861 --> 01:17:51,770
I was completely nihilistic, said,
I started watching your lectures.

1276
01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:55,820
I started to adopt a
more responsible outlook.

1277
01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:57,200
I realized that that was important.

1278
01:17:57,201 --> 01:17:59,930
I started to try to tell the
truth and to put myself together.

1279
01:18:00,110 --> 01:18:03,770
And without that I wouldn't be here.
And that's a little note.

1280
01:18:03,771 --> 01:18:06,800
And that happens over and over,
you know?

1281
01:18:06,801 --> 01:18:10,370
And then I go talk to journalists
and this happened in Scandinavia.

1282
01:18:10,371 --> 01:18:12,470
It happened with his GQ interview.
I just did.

1283
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:16,520
While your message is primarily
directed towards young men, so I can,

1284
01:18:16,521 --> 01:18:20,180
there's this judgment about that. It's
like, oh, there's a problem with that.

1285
01:18:20,181 --> 01:18:24,560
Is there, I mean that wasn't the point,
but that is the audience is what,

1286
01:18:24,650 --> 01:18:25,483
there's something,

1287
01:18:25,490 --> 01:18:29,000
there's something wrong with talking
to young men and encouraging them.

1288
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:33,830
It's like that makes me somehow somehow
suspicious the hatred of humanity that

1289
01:18:33,831 --> 01:18:38,430
is present in that critique is
mindblowing. It, it's, it's, it's,

1290
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:42,110
it's absolutely beyond belief
and you think, well, it's
only misogyny. It's like,

1291
01:18:42,111 --> 01:18:43,580
no, it's not. It's like what?

1292
01:18:43,610 --> 01:18:46,460
Who are you leaving for the
women to have as partners?

1293
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:50,660
These did demolished and week,
whether it's a zero sum quality of it.

1294
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:55,610
I mean as if, as if, as if lifting up any
human being is not a good for all of us.

1295
01:18:55,611 --> 01:19:00,440
I mean there's the whole point about the
necessity of our care for the oppressed

1296
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:04,250
is because they are part of us know
you only care about them in groups.

1297
01:19:04,850 --> 01:19:07,160
The individual impressed
person is irrelevant.

1298
01:19:07,161 --> 01:19:09,320
It's the group of oppressed
people that's relevant.

1299
01:19:09,321 --> 01:19:14,170
And so if you just help one
person, no. Well you see then,
then that's, that's that,

1300
01:19:14,171 --> 01:19:17,240
that, that flies at the heart
of the collectivist doctrine.

1301
01:19:17,330 --> 01:19:18,200
You said something very,

1302
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:21,410
very powerful when you talked about
the people should be flocking to the

1303
01:19:21,411 --> 01:19:22,244
universities.

1304
01:19:22,270 --> 01:19:24,800
You're in an image that comes to
my mind is the image of a fountain.

1305
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:29,630
And know people come to the
fountain to drink, to slake
their thirst. And, and, and,

1306
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:31,970
and,
and it seems to me that we need,

1307
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:34,370
we need new institutions
of higher education.

1308
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:37,880
That's the fountain of living
water. Yes. Yes. Moses.

1309
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:40,400
That's why Moses is a master
of water in the desert.

1310
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:43,620
So we thought a master
of stone mass. Yes. Yes.

1311
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:45,290
And one thing that really
excites me, Jordan, is that,

1312
01:19:45,291 --> 01:19:49,790
is that what we see right now is, is this
longing. There's so many thirsty people,

1313
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:52,010
it seems to me we simply need to,

1314
01:19:52,610 --> 01:19:57,140
to build new fountains because as you
say, the books are in the library. We can,

1315
01:19:57,230 --> 01:19:57,740
we can,

1316
01:19:57,740 --> 01:20:02,740
we can give a rebirth to the past in the
form of the hunger and thirst that are

1317
01:20:02,871 --> 01:20:06,530
in young people simply by feeding
it. And that, it seems to me that,

1318
01:20:06,531 --> 01:20:07,440
that there's a kind of

1319
01:20:07,980 --> 01:20:12,060
cultural pacivity, particularly when it
comes to the university. People say, Oh,

1320
01:20:12,061 --> 01:20:15,120
well, you know, you could never do
anything about that. Well, you know,

1321
01:20:15,121 --> 01:20:18,470
the university, they're just, well, you
just have to kind of write them off. Well,

1322
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:21,480
why don't you have to do that? Why
can't we start new ones? People,

1323
01:20:21,481 --> 01:20:24,530
there've been thousands of universities
started over over two years,

1324
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:28,230
come into the university and they've
got this facade of cynicism. You know,

1325
01:20:28,231 --> 01:20:31,800
that partly because they haven't had
great experiences with the educational

1326
01:20:31,801 --> 01:20:34,860
system and it's no wonder partly,
but it goes all the way back to the,

1327
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,120
to the beginning.
Yes.

1328
01:20:36,121 --> 01:20:38,840
I mean you've talked about this in dating
in your booklet into the university to

1329
01:20:38,910 --> 01:20:40,500
interrupt,
but that the,

1330
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:45,480
what moves in in the whole k to 12
educational system in a certain sense,

1331
01:20:45,630 --> 01:20:50,630
was founded with in large part to bring
about that collectivist control and to,

1332
01:20:51,460 --> 01:20:56,250
to stultify. And to annihilate the,
the, the freedom of the individual.

1333
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:59,430
And so that's,
that's pretty well ingrained.

1334
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:02,070
By the time someone comes to university
and no wonder they don't like it,

1335
01:21:02,071 --> 01:21:04,590
they don't think they like educational
institutes as swab and then,

1336
01:21:04,591 --> 01:21:07,350
but they're still desperate enough
to come and they might say, well,

1337
01:21:07,351 --> 01:21:10,440
I'm doing this practically because I
needed a degree to get a job, which is,

1338
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:13,440
you know, as perfectly reasonable.
It's perfectly reasonable as a,

1339
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:17,460
as a fragmentary ambition.
It's a good fragmentary ambition,

1340
01:21:17,820 --> 01:21:19,920
but their, their, their,

1341
01:21:19,970 --> 01:21:24,540
their core is dying for something
deeper than that. And they're coming,

1342
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:30,090
they're coming to university. The way
that you enter a cathedral properly,

1343
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:33,480
if you enter it properly, they
come prayerfully. They're hoping,

1344
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:36,750
but they won't talk to anyone
about it. They're hoping, God,

1345
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:41,820
I hope that what I need is here.
And if you provide that,

1346
01:21:41,821 --> 01:21:45,300
then they're just overwhelmed by it.
And,

1347
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:47,030
and then they're motivated to,

1348
01:21:47,031 --> 01:21:51,480
to work and to move and to put themselves
together because it doesn't take much

1349
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:55,950
water on to really transform a part
surface. And these young people,

1350
01:21:55,951 --> 01:22:00,030
they have their cynical facade and it's
easy to be intimidated by that because

1351
01:22:00,031 --> 01:22:02,790
they're, they're judgmental in
their lectures, in your lectures,

1352
01:22:02,791 --> 01:22:05,760
and maybe they're not paying attention
and they're snapping gum in there playing

1353
01:22:05,761 --> 01:22:07,640
with their computers,
but there,

1354
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:11,970
there is part of them that's at the
back listening and hoping that something

1355
01:22:11,971 --> 01:22:16,440
will emerge that will captivate them and
when that happens then well then well

1356
01:22:16,441 --> 01:22:20,460
then that's when it becomes something
absolutely remarkable to be an educator

1357
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:25,080
because then you're providing guidance
and you're providing the guidance that

1358
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:28,590
that's, that's well that's,
that's, that's the bread,

1359
01:22:28,591 --> 01:22:32,270
that's more than mere material brand
and then the students are extraordinary,

1360
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:36,630
extraordinarily rewarding to work with
because there are so, it's not pleased.

1361
01:22:36,630 --> 01:22:37,890
It's way more than pleased.

1362
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:42,480
They're so engaged by what's happening
that the whole thing comes alive. That's,

1363
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:45,730
that's when it's a great thing
to be an educator. And what,

1364
01:22:45,930 --> 01:22:48,810
it's been great for me to go
on this lecture tour because,

1365
01:22:49,620 --> 01:22:53,160
which is why I keep doing it is
because every evening it's like that.

1366
01:22:53,161 --> 01:22:57,600
I get 2,500 people in an auditorium and
I start talking about the things we've

1367
01:22:57,601 --> 01:23:01,470
been talking about it. Everybody's
dead silent and they're locked onto it.

1368
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:06,250
And it's an unbelievably gratifying
process. And then people come up and say,

1369
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,560
you know, oh, this has
been so useful to me.

1370
01:23:09,070 --> 01:23:12,070
Things were so terrible and
falling apart in so many ways.

1371
01:23:12,071 --> 01:23:15,280
And like all of a sudden I'm just
stacking these things up and putting them

1372
01:23:15,281 --> 01:23:19,960
together. So interesting watching the
young men who come in and talk to me,

1373
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:24,230
and it's, it's young women as well. Well
in North Idaho, always just so young, uh,

1374
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:27,340
many of the women come and say thank you
very much for what you've done for my

1375
01:23:27,341 --> 01:23:30,250
sons for example.
But the men come up and they say,

1376
01:23:30,251 --> 01:23:32,470
it's like they're telling me a secret,
you know?

1377
01:23:32,471 --> 01:23:35,380
And it's the sort of secret that you'd
only tell an intimate friend that you

1378
01:23:35,381 --> 01:23:38,500
trusted. It's like, you know,
man, I wasn't doing so well.

1379
01:23:38,530 --> 01:23:42,700
And these are often rough looking
guys. You know, they say, look,

1380
01:23:42,730 --> 01:23:44,830
I've been really trying to
get my act together. You know,

1381
01:23:44,831 --> 01:23:47,410
I've been working it out with
my wife and I, I've been,

1382
01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:50,500
I've been trying to get my relationship
with my son straightened out.

1383
01:23:50,501 --> 01:23:52,060
And here's my father by the way.

1384
01:23:52,061 --> 01:23:55,660
He came along with me and we're getting
along just fine and it's really working

1385
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:59,560
and they say it hushed voice, you
know, and they say thank you very much.

1386
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:03,610
And I say, great, that's so great. I'm
so thrilled to hear that. And they,

1387
01:24:03,790 --> 01:24:08,170
they're telling me that because they're
hoping that I would in fact be thrilled

1388
01:24:08,171 --> 01:24:11,260
to hear that because they want to tell
it to someone who would be thrilled to

1389
01:24:11,261 --> 01:24:16,060
hear it. And I am thrilled to hear
it because I do believe that the,

1390
01:24:16,061 --> 01:24:20,860
that redemption is something
that is accomplished at the
level of the individual.

1391
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:23,890
And every time you hear someone say,
um,

1392
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,630
that they've, they're, they'd
oriented themselves properly.

1393
01:24:28,631 --> 01:24:33,490
It's like a bell rings in
heaven to exactly that and so,

1394
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:39,280
well, so, well, so that's absolutely,
and chronically overwhelming,

1395
01:24:39,281 --> 01:24:41,890
but it's,
it's absolutely remarkable to see this,

1396
01:24:41,891 --> 01:24:44,980
to see how much desperation
there is for this.

1397
01:24:45,190 --> 01:24:48,750
When I talk to audiences about the
relationship between responsibility and

1398
01:24:48,751 --> 01:24:53,680
meaning, they inevitably go dead silent.
There's not a, there's not a Russell,

1399
01:24:53,681 --> 01:24:57,280
there's not a cough. It's like, is
that the secret? Is that the secret?

1400
01:24:57,281 --> 01:25:01,720
Is that it's the voluntary
adoption of responsibility?
It's like, well, that's the,

1401
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:03,790
that's the central message of the West.

1402
01:25:03,791 --> 01:25:08,620
It's like to pick up your cross and it
and know and everyone's been told that,

1403
01:25:08,621 --> 01:25:12,400
but they don't know what it means because
if it's not being articulated enough

1404
01:25:12,401 --> 01:25:14,860
so that it becomes something
that's practical, it's like, yes,

1405
01:25:14,861 --> 01:25:18,160
look at the terrible responsibilities
you have right in front of you.

1406
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:23,020
Your family is hurting, you're in
trouble. There's problems in the world.

1407
01:25:23,021 --> 01:25:28,021
It's like all of that's right there and
all you have to do is all you have to do

1408
01:25:28,211 --> 01:25:32,260
is take responsibility for it and
then you've got what you need.

1409
01:25:32,440 --> 01:25:35,260
All of a sudden think, oh, that's
what I needed. I didn't know that.

1410
01:25:35,410 --> 01:25:39,070
I thought that was something to avoid.
It's an impediment to short term,

1411
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:43,180
hedonistic pleasure, you know,
went to happiness. There's
nothing happiness about,

1412
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:46,420
happy about lifting the suffering
of the world. Onto your shoulders.

1413
01:25:46,421 --> 01:25:48,070
It's like this is way,

1414
01:25:48,370 --> 01:25:52,420
way better than happiness isn't
what you feel in the king's chapel.

1415
01:25:53,410 --> 01:25:58,390
It's something so magnificent that
happiness pales in comparison.

1416
01:25:59,030 --> 01:26:00,790
So it's, it's, it's thin,

1417
01:26:00,791 --> 01:26:05,791
grool happiness and young people know
they're pursuing hedonistic pleasure and

1418
01:26:06,021 --> 01:26:07,010
you know,
no wonder,

1419
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:11,000
but there's nothing in it that sustaining
and all it does is make you cynical.

1420
01:26:11,030 --> 01:26:15,020
It's like is that's all there is
another one night stand, another,

1421
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:17,240
another binge party.
You know,

1422
01:26:17,241 --> 01:26:21,590
and it's not like I have anything
against in principle against some of that

1423
01:26:21,770 --> 01:26:24,890
exuberant,
youthful hedonism.

1424
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:30,260
But, but it's, it's not. If, look,

1425
01:26:30,261 --> 01:26:34,400
the universities have turned into
places of parties, why? Well,

1426
01:26:34,401 --> 01:26:38,570
because that's what the students find
best to do there. Well, that's not good.

1427
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:43,190
What you want to offer them as a
reason to not party. It's like, no,

1428
01:26:43,191 --> 01:26:46,010
you got to understand, you
come to this class, hung over.

1429
01:26:46,190 --> 01:26:47,930
You're not going to be able to get it.

1430
01:26:47,931 --> 01:26:49,490
You don't go on to be
able to write properly.

1431
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:52,700
You're going to pay a price
for that hedonism. It's like,

1432
01:26:52,701 --> 01:26:55,160
and the price will be too high
for you to bear. It's like,

1433
01:26:55,161 --> 01:26:58,730
oh well nef hedonism for me. Then I'm
like, I've got something important to do.

1434
01:26:59,090 --> 01:27:01,370
That's the way out of that.
But that,

1435
01:27:01,371 --> 01:27:04,730
that thing that's more important has
to be offered and it can be offered.

1436
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:08,000
So when I've seen it happen over
and over to people and it's, it's,

1437
01:27:08,010 --> 01:27:10,760
it's extraordinarily good for them.
If you're an addict,

1438
01:27:10,761 --> 01:27:13,010
and I've talked to many
people who are addicted,

1439
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:17,330
you need a reason to stop being addicted,

1440
01:27:17,331 --> 01:27:19,760
which means you need something
better than the drug.

1441
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:23,510
Well that's what you offer at
universities. It's something better.

1442
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:26,930
It's something better than everything
else. And if you're not offering that,

1443
01:27:26,931 --> 01:27:31,490
then it's all a facade. It's all
a factory, a knowledge factory,

1444
01:27:31,730 --> 01:27:35,690
which is the modern university
factory knowledge factory products.

1445
01:27:36,010 --> 01:27:40,270
It seems to me. And we'll conclude
here, I think momentarily,

1446
01:27:40,690 --> 01:27:45,690
it seems to me that that the time is ripe
for a radical in beautiful rebirth of

1447
01:27:47,890 --> 01:27:50,950
a more fully human culture.
And when I hear you speak Jordan,

1448
01:27:50,951 --> 01:27:55,530
about your lectures and you know what,
what moves me deeply is,

1449
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:56,230
is the,

1450
01:27:56,230 --> 01:28:01,230
the love that you have for
the people who come to you.

1451
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:06,880
And I suppose I want to just
conclude on a question, uh,

1452
01:28:07,150 --> 01:28:07,983
about,

1453
01:28:09,820 --> 01:28:13,000
I want to conclude on
an optimistic note by,

1454
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:16,540
by drawing out what's in that love.

1455
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:20,290
It's that the potential that is,
that lies in those,

1456
01:28:20,390 --> 01:28:24,490
in each and every individual
for deep transformation,

1457
01:28:24,491 --> 01:28:28,880
for connection to the transcendent
and, and, and, and, and, and,

1458
01:28:28,881 --> 01:28:33,640
and just to talk about that, that
longing, that seems to me that, that,

1459
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:38,110
that longing is overwhelming.
And if only we can start to,

1460
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:41,920
can refill the fountains with
water or build new fountains,

1461
01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:47,310
that the possibilities are beyond our
imagining for the point we're at right at

1462
01:28:50,610 --> 01:28:53,760
the moment. Yeah. That's what partly
why this is an inflection point too,

1463
01:28:53,761 --> 01:28:58,320
because so many things
that are transforming the
landscape of possibility is

1464
01:28:58,321 --> 01:29:01,140
opening up to us in a way that it,
it never has,

1465
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:03,960
partly because of our
technological transformations.

1466
01:29:03,961 --> 01:29:08,961
And so the importance of
the particularities of our
ethical choices are becoming

1467
01:29:09,301 --> 01:29:14,301
more and more exaggerated because
while we're going to build artificial

1468
01:29:15,061 --> 01:29:17,430
intelligence and it's going
to be a reflection of us,

1469
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:20,670
and so we better make sure that it
reflects the part of us that we want

1470
01:29:20,671 --> 01:29:21,504
reflected.

1471
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:25,950
And you talked about that care for people
as they care for me is predicated on

1472
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:28,650
my realization that I
prefer heaven to hell.

1473
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:31,350
Having done what I could to explore hell,

1474
01:29:31,410 --> 01:29:34,590
let's say in my academic career
and in my private life and in my,

1475
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:36,210
and in my clinical practice,

1476
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:40,650
and to see what's there that unnecessary
suffering and not malevolence is like,

1477
01:29:40,651 --> 01:29:45,180
well, it would be best to move away
from that towards something better.

1478
01:29:45,260 --> 01:29:48,410
That's something I genuinely
believe that it's, it's,

1479
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:51,330
it's for the best for
everything that we aim up.

1480
01:29:51,331 --> 01:29:54,510
And then when I see someone decide
to aim up, I think, well that's,

1481
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:59,010
that's something that's one more step
away from hell. It's not just the,

1482
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:03,600
it's not just the climbing up the hill
painfully towards the city of God.

1483
01:30:03,601 --> 01:30:05,670
It's move away from the abyss.

1484
01:30:05,671 --> 01:30:08,100
And I think it's easier for
people to believe in the abyss.

1485
01:30:08,101 --> 01:30:11,910
It was for me to believe in the existence
of malevolence and apocalypse and

1486
01:30:11,911 --> 01:30:15,810
catastrophe. I mean, all you have to do
study history to believe that they call.

1487
01:30:15,811 --> 01:30:19,590
Not that anything,
but that a way from that,

1488
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:22,680
while away from that is a
morphous, right? It's, it's again,

1489
01:30:22,681 --> 01:30:26,190
it's like Moses leading his people from,
from the tyranny in Egypt. It's like,

1490
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:30,870
well, where are we going?
Well away from that,

1491
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:35,850
well, that's into the desert
and that's where we are now.
Well, that's not so good,

1492
01:30:35,851 --> 01:30:38,670
but at least it's a way from
that. Well, that's something,

1493
01:30:38,671 --> 01:30:40,830
but then there's something
beyond that. It's like, well,

1494
01:30:40,831 --> 01:30:43,910
what is it that we're striving
towards and and well, we,

1495
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:47,460
we can each imagine that in our own way
in some sense, but I would say, well,

1496
01:30:47,461 --> 01:30:50,490
you start locally,
it's like fix up what you can fix up.

1497
01:30:50,610 --> 01:30:54,240
When you see a problem that announces
itself to you, a small problem,

1498
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:58,860
that's your problem that you could fix.
That's your one step forward.

1499
01:30:58,980 --> 01:30:59,813
Take it.

1500
01:30:59,940 --> 01:31:03,710
Yes. It seems to me, in addition to
that, that life of the individual, we'd,

1501
01:31:03,740 --> 01:31:08,740
we need to think very broadly about the
institutional life that supports all of

1502
01:31:09,361 --> 01:31:12,900
that individual realization and freedom.

1503
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:16,140
We need to think about universities
when you think about our architecture,

1504
01:31:16,141 --> 01:31:19,650
we need to think about that
is to say that, that the,

1505
01:31:19,710 --> 01:31:23,790
the whole horizon that lies
before us needs to be considered

1506
01:31:25,590 --> 01:31:30,510
for the fullness of possibility that,
that it holds.

1507
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:35,250
And that those possibilities are
not realizable simply by, you know,

1508
01:31:35,310 --> 01:31:37,860
this individual doing this
and that and are doing that.

1509
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:41,420
But that they also require a kind of,
um,

1510
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:47,840
it requires that we think about the
whole and that we allow to give birth.

1511
01:31:48,001 --> 01:31:53,001
We allow to come into being the
kinds of institutional lives,

1512
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:55,830
institutional life that,
um,

1513
01:31:56,970 --> 01:32:00,910
upon which our realization upon
which that awakening depends.

1514
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:03,810
And so it's simply can't
be simply a matter of,

1515
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:07,030
of our living our lives and
a kind of solitary way. No.

1516
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:10,660
Or thinking about what do
we know what to think about,

1517
01:32:10,661 --> 01:32:14,230
what are the fountains on which,
you know, if we're in the desert,

1518
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:18,490
it seems to me that, that, okay, so
we're in the desert. It's a, it's a,

1519
01:32:18,491 --> 01:32:20,980
it's a lonely and dry place,

1520
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:26,760
but there are the dirty of fragments or
the narrative that the Israelites come

1521
01:32:27,281 --> 01:32:30,930
to worship the false idols because the
narrative fragments and that is the PR

1522
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:36,120
precisely the moment paradoxically
at which we can rediscover ourselves,

1523
01:32:36,431 --> 01:32:38,800
what our, what our nature,
what our longing is for.

1524
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:43,630
And so it seems to me that we're at
a time of astonishing possibility,

1525
01:32:44,170 --> 01:32:47,680
but that we must take it up.
Well, hopefully, you know,

1526
01:32:47,681 --> 01:32:50,560
when you train graduate students and
new train undergraduates, you know,

1527
01:32:50,561 --> 01:32:55,270
you orient them towards the truth and
then they learn to teach in accordance

1528
01:32:55,271 --> 01:32:56,110
with that and that,

1529
01:32:56,320 --> 01:33:00,430
and that facilitates the process that
we're describing and that they regard the

1530
01:33:00,431 --> 01:33:03,730
relationship with individual students
as a of paramount importance.

1531
01:33:03,731 --> 01:33:07,680
And see the teaching is something that's
noble and the research as well. Yes, yes.

1532
01:33:07,690 --> 01:33:09,400
The awakening of each
particular individual.

1533
01:33:09,401 --> 01:33:14,401
It's an educational institution
is precisely what allows
them to go on in 10,000

1534
01:33:15,131 --> 01:33:20,131
ways in 1,000 thousand ways throughout
their lives to to to transmit and open up

1535
01:33:22,150 --> 01:33:26,710
those transcendent possibilities.
Thank you Jordan. Very much.

1536
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:27,640
My pleasure.
