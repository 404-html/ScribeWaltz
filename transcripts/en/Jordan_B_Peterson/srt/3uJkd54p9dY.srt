1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,450
All right.
Welcome back.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,620
So the next four lectures are also
oriented towards discussion of primarily

3
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:21,660
clinical theories of psychology and 
psychopathology.

4
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:28,013
We're going to talk about lines of 
thinking that in some ways run parallel 

5
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:32,664
to those of the site ground lists 
because the thinkers we're going to 

6
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:37,530
discuss now and with a few small 
exceptions,

7
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,263
well all of them,
all of the thinkers we're going to 

8
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:46,131
discuss in the next four lectures were 
either influenced heavily by Freud,

9
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:50,550
human adler or
word themselves,

10
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:55,551
thinkers who influenced Freud in me up.
So there's an intellectual continuity

11
00:00:59,130 --> 00:00:59,963
stretching over with,
with people who are deeply educated and 

12
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:06,250
who are very thoughtful.
There's intellectual continuity ideas,

13
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,210
stretching over exceptional spans of 
time.

14
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,970
And so it's exactly the sort of thing 
that you would,

15
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,680
that sort of relationship is exactly 
what you'd imagined.

16
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,900
Um,
Roger has had a variety of influences,

17
00:01:18,901 --> 00:01:19,734
so let's say Freud and Jung and Adler,
but he was also very much influenced by 

18
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,480
phenomenological ideas and the 
phenomenologists app were,

19
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:34,170
and our phenomenologies a brand of 
philosophy and

20
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,640
which I'll explain more deeply.

21
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,473
And the other primary domain of 
influence on Rogers was Christianity 

22
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:44,310
likely.
And,

23
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,143
and then
Christianity also via probably northern 

24
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:52,010
European culture as far as I can tell.
The reason I'm,

25
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,093
I'm talking specifically about 
Christianity in relationship to rogers 

26
00:01:55,771 --> 00:01:59,940
is because as a young man,
he was a fundamentalist Christian and he

27
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,350
was a seminarian.
So we had,

28
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,530
he was quite oriented towards
mainline Protestant Christianity.

29
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,830
But when he was in university,
he had a crisis of belief,

30
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:14,430
I suppose,
when he was even going to go to China as

31
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:17,040
a missionary at one point.
Um,

32
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,503
but he had a crisis of belief in 
university because he'd also been 

33
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:21,444
scientifically trained.
His father was a farmer who used rather 

34
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:26,184
advanced farming techniques.
And so rogers was trained to think 

35
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:29,544
scientifically from a very young age and
he experienced the conflict between his 

36
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:36,090
religious belief and his scientific 
presuppositions quite intensely.

37
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,480
And in that battle is formal Christian 
belief was the loser.

38
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,893
However,
his thinking is very much influenced by 

39
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:49,290
fundamentalist Protestant 
presuppositions.

40
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,483
And,
uh,

41
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,440
the effect of those all described as we 
walked through Roger's thinking.

42
00:02:58,810 --> 00:02:59,643
Now
it's important to understand the 

43
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:07,831
philosophical underpinnings of a global 
personality or psychology theory because

44
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:17,460
every theory is set within a set of 
assumptions,

45
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,660
things that you have to assume to be 
true in order to proceed with the theory

46
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,450
and like the axioms in,
in,

47
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,680
uh,
in classical geometry,

48
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,990
you can't prove the axiom that you have 
to accept them.

49
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,003
Once you accept the axioms,
then you can move forward and use the 

50
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,004
whole system.
I think the reason that systems have to 

51
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:37,200
have axioms,
which are items,

52
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:41,080
elements of belief is because every 
system is incomplete,

53
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,000
right?
It doesn't cover the entire world.

54
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:49,290
And so in some sense you need a place to
dispense with your ignorance.

55
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:51,580
And the way you do that is by making 
assumptions.

56
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:52,414
We're going to act as if the following 
is true and then you can proceed with a 

57
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,650
partial theory and you'll have some 
success with it.

58
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:01,623
But it's useful to understand the 
presuppositions because they'd orients 

59
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:05,254
you properly towards the theory.
Now Rogers is a phenomenologist and 

60
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:11,764
phenomenology is a brand of philosophy,
which I believe started with Edmund 

61
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,743
Husserl but was probably made most 
influential by his student Martin 

62
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,210
Heidegger.
Now heidegger

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,440
was,
there was a philosopher,

64
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:30,274
I suppose something somewhat like Nicha 
and that he was very much his thinking 

65
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:35,404
around,
very much counter to what you might 

66
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:40,010
describe as general academic philosophy.
Um,

67
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,163
for example,
heidegger believed that ever since the 

68
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:44,854
time of Plato,
which is when people think philosophy 

69
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:53,011
began more or less western philosophy 
had taken an erroneous direction.

70
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,683
It had become too concerned with the 
nature of structures of thought and not 

71
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:02,980
concerned enough about the nature of 
being.

72
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,293
And so you can determine those two 
things being as how things are and 

73
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:09,010
thought of course is how you represent 
things.

74
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:14,970
And one of heidegger's
missions was to reestablish being as the

75
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:21,550
central
reality of philosophy.

76
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:27,090
Now that begs a question,
which is what is being well

77
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:31,743
to conceptualize reality as being is not
to conceptualize it the same way that 

78
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:37,660
you conceptualize it

79
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,333
in terms of modern Western thought.
Because one of the presuppositions at 

80
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:48,634
the basis of modern Western thought is 
that the most intelligent way to divide 

81
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:54,904
up the world is in terms of subjective 
and objective experience or subjective 

82
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:02,840
and subjective experience and object of 
world.

83
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,153
So the fundamental scientific 
presupposition you might say is that 

84
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,320
there is an objective world.
It's the real thing.

85
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,310
You come to that by performing certain 
procedures,

86
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:18,500
documenting them,
describe them,

87
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:21,950
the outcome of those procedures,
documenting them and then allowing other

88
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,784
people to do the same thing,
operating under the presupposition that 

89
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:29,870
if they experience the same outcome from
the procedures,

90
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,200
then what they're experiencing is real.
That's basically the scientific method,

91
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,330
right?
Method results.

92
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,550
You detailed the method,
which is how you act on the world.

93
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:38,384
You'd get the results,
you compare them maybe across multiple 

94
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:41,774
observations that you do and then other 
people do multiple observations that 

95
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:47,060
you've come up with that with a 
consensus,

96
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,223
but it's a method bound consensus and 
then of course you abstract out general 

97
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:53,600
principles from that and it works very 
powerfully,

98
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:55,070
right?
Make no mistake about it.

99
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,473
The objective,
the idea that there was an objective 

100
00:06:59,030 --> 00:06:59,863
external world and that that's the best 
way to conceptualize reality is an 

101
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:04,730
unbelievably powerful tool.

102
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:08,933
Now,
whether or not it's an accurate 

103
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:10,194
description of reality,
that's a much more difficult question 

104
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,230
and it's partly a matter of definition 
actually,

105
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,263
you know,
it's the case that there are different 

106
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:22,420
forms of geometry.
You might know this,

107
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:23,254
you can start from the presupposition 
that reality has a three dimensional 

108
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:31,060
structure and then you're basically 
within the realm of Euclidean geometry.

109
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:31,894
But you can also start with the 
presupposition that reality has a four 

110
00:07:34,451 --> 00:07:35,284
dimensional structure and that kind of 
geometry was invented in the late 18 

111
00:07:38,711 --> 00:07:39,544
hundreds and it turned out to be the 
perfect geometry to describe the 

112
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:42,334
universe that Einstein conceptualized 
when he came up with his great theories 

113
00:07:45,671 --> 00:07:48,460
in,
in the second decade there abouts of the

114
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,473
20th century.
So it's interesting because you can 

115
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:52,204
start from different assumptions,
build tools on the basis of those 

116
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:58,060
assumptions and sometimes you find out 
that those tools work very well.

117
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,903
Indeed.

118
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:05,940
Now it's not that easy to think of flaws
in the subjective experience,

119
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,470
objective world conceptualization.
And that's partly for,

120
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,560
as for us as modern people,
it forms the basis of so much of what we

121
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:19,660
think that we just think about it as 
axiomatic.

122
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,480
It's just true.
It doesn't bear any question,

123
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,553
but I'm going to offer you a couple of 
examples of why it might bear some 

124
00:08:27,161 --> 00:08:30,430
questioning and you can,
you can think about,

125
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,353
you can think about it.
The first problem is is that the 

126
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,540
classical scientific view of the world 
has a very difficult time accounting for

127
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:42,010
certain things.
So for example,

128
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,353
these are called quality a often by 
people who were interested in 

129
00:08:45,761 --> 00:08:46,594
consciousness.
So knowing the wavelength of light 

130
00:08:49,631 --> 00:08:53,080
doesn't seem to tell you much about the 
subjective experience of color.

131
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,100
You know,
we experienced for example,

132
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,410
in a non continuous fashion,
right?

133
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,230
Cause we see discrete colors like you'd 
see in a rainbolt.

134
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,270
I mean they shade into each other to 
some degree,

135
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:06,360
but it's not like they go from light red
to dark red in the continuum.

136
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,463
There's clear demarcations of color.
While that's because of the way your 

137
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:13,320
brain is wired.
You know,

138
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,780
it seems like over the course of 
evolution,

139
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:16,614
what we've learned is that parsing up 
that wavelength fragment in terms of 

140
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:20,934
categories which would be the different 
colors that we see has substantial 

141
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:24,624
practical utility.
Now what are the things you might ask 

142
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:26,791
is,
well,

143
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:29,880
do those colors exist?
Well,

144
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:33,810
objectively they don't seem to exist as 
colors.

145
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:36,570
Partly because of the,
the wavelengths that we see are actually

146
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:39,870
continuous.
So when one color shades into another,

147
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,500
there's no radical transformation in 
wave lake length.

148
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,960
It's a continuum,
but we see it categorically.

149
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,340
Okay,
so is that real or not?

150
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,490
Or The colors we see real or not?
Well,

151
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:53,190
that's a good question.
Um,

152
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,760
you can't get a collective experience of
pain.

153
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,580
Like you can get a collective experience
of the blackboard,

154
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,810
but pain seems to be something that's 
limited to subjective perception,

155
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:09,120
but it's very difficult.
No one acts as if pain isn't real.

156
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,220
I mean,
I would say that

157
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,630
of all the things that you might 
consider real,

158
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,900
we act as if pain is the most real 
thing.

159
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,910
You certainly can't argue yourself out 
of it.

160
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:21,744
For example.
It seems like a fundamental element of 

161
00:10:24,121 --> 00:10:25,620
experience.
Okay,

162
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:26,454
so that's two places.
We also have no account in the 

163
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:30,030
subjective objective,

164
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,533
what breakup bifurcation of the world.
We have no explanation whatsoever for 

165
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:40,600
consciousness.
That seems like a big problem,

166
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:41,434
right,
because you could make a case that 

167
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,573
there's no being without consciousness.
Like is there something if there's no 

168
00:10:48,641 --> 00:10:49,960
one there to perceive it.
By the way,

169
00:10:49,961 --> 00:10:50,794
that is not the same question as if a 
tree falls in the forest and there's no 

170
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:55,390
one there to hear it.
Does it make a sound?

171
00:10:55,391 --> 00:10:59,350
It's not the same question.
It sounds superficially the same,

172
00:10:59,351 --> 00:11:01,690
but this is a much more complex question
because we don't know.

173
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:02,524
For example,
if we don't know the relationship 

174
00:11:05,801 --> 00:11:06,634
between time and consciousness,
like we have a certain perception of 

175
00:11:10,091 --> 00:11:10,924
time.
We have a certain temporal realm within 

176
00:11:12,941 --> 00:11:13,774
which we exist.
Our refresh rate for our vision for 

177
00:11:16,001 --> 00:11:17,590
example,
is about 60 hertz,

178
00:11:17,591 --> 00:11:21,430
which is why you can see computer 
screens flicker or if they have a reflex

179
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,540
rate that's slower than that.

180
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,860
So 60 hertz to us looks continuous,
but you know,

181
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:30,730
there's a lot of microseconds in a 
second for a computer,

182
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,593
especially a fast process it computer 
that can do maybe a trillion operations 

183
00:11:34,391 --> 00:11:38,920
per second if it was watching,
so to speak a movie,

184
00:11:38,921 --> 00:11:39,754
it would just see a picture still 
picture that was there forever and then 

185
00:11:43,391 --> 00:11:44,224
another still picture that was there 
forever and like it wouldn't have the 

186
00:11:46,661 --> 00:11:50,470
impression of continuous movement.
So there's this weird subjective element

187
00:11:50,471 --> 00:11:52,990
to time.
It's very difficult to understand.

188
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,223
And then here's a more,
here's a more complex criticism of the 

189
00:11:56,661 --> 00:11:57,960
subject object idea.

190
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,853
I thought about this for a long time.
So the best example I know of it is I 

191
00:12:05,931 --> 00:12:06,764
read this book a while back written by a
kgb officer and it was published after 

192
00:12:11,211 --> 00:12:12,540
the fall of the,
you know,

193
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:16,490
the wall and the Soviet Empire.
And this KGB officer claimed that he had

194
00:12:16,491 --> 00:12:17,324
worked in a biological warfare unit in 
the Soviet Union and the purpose of the 

195
00:12:21,201 --> 00:12:22,034
biological warfare unit was to turn 
infectious diseases into aerosols so 

196
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:29,540
that they can be sprayed on enemy 
populations.

197
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,050
And so they were working on two things,
developing a very,

198
00:12:33,051 --> 00:12:36,140
very silent infection.
And so if you're willing to infection is

199
00:12:36,141 --> 00:12:36,974
one that's very severe but also very 
transmissible cause those things are 

200
00:12:40,221 --> 00:12:41,054
separate.
And then also one that could survive 

201
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:45,920
being aerosolized because it turns out 
that that's quite difficult,

202
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,690
which we should all be very thankful 
about.

203
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,940
And one of the projects they were 
working on was uh,

204
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,650
an attempt to cross Ebola with smallpox.

205
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,830
Now he bulla is,
you all know about Ebola,

206
00:12:57,831 --> 00:13:00,560
I presume it's uh,
it's very,

207
00:13:00,561 --> 00:13:01,394
very fatal although they've learned ways
to treat it now and maybe have a 

208
00:13:04,521 --> 00:13:06,380
vaccine.
But at that time it was very,

209
00:13:06,381 --> 00:13:10,760
very fatal and a small smallpox is 
incredibly contagious.

210
00:13:10,761 --> 00:13:11,594
And so they were hoping they could 
develop something that you said it was 

211
00:13:13,701 --> 00:13:15,290
very,
very contagious and very,

212
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:20,300
very deadly and that you could spray on 
civilian populations.

213
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,000
Now you know,
here,

214
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:27,080
here's where it gets tricky.
It gets tricky here because

215
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,473
how you answered this question 
inevitably lead inevitably depends on 

216
00:13:32,631 --> 00:13:33,464
how you define truth and truth is 
actually something you have to define 

217
00:13:37,671 --> 00:13:39,290
before you can have a conversation about
it,

218
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,680
which is a kind of a strange thing
anyways.

219
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:47,803
You can make a case that determining how
to cross Ebola with small parks and 

220
00:13:52,281 --> 00:13:53,114
aerosolize.
It is a perfectly valid scientific 

221
00:13:56,451 --> 00:13:57,284
question

222
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,053
and because science is value free,
it's very difficult to make an argument 

223
00:14:03,251 --> 00:14:04,084
that that's any worse experiment than 
any other kind of experiment or any 

224
00:14:06,911 --> 00:14:09,280
other kind of investigation.
And you could also imagine,

225
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:13,210
even if you didn't go to the 
aerosolization stage,

226
00:14:13,211 --> 00:14:14,800
that positive things might come out of 
it.

227
00:14:14,801 --> 00:14:15,634
Maybe you'd end up with a more detailed 
understanding of DNA or something as a 

228
00:14:19,211 --> 00:14:22,180
consequence of the investigation that 
would have positive consequences.

229
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,553
But it still seems
that the idea of doing scientific 

230
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,890
research across Ebola,
smallpox,

231
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,380
there seems to be something wrong about 
that.

232
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,743
And it's maybe that sense of wrongness 
as well that can't be captured with 

233
00:14:42,711 --> 00:14:44,950
inside,
inside scientific models.

234
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,413
And so
one of the things that you claimed him 

235
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:54,390
and Rogers and the is that in some sense
is that the scientific reality has to be

236
00:14:56,661 --> 00:15:00,920
encapsulated within a,
an ethical reality rather than the other

237
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:04,160
way around.
Now Rogers would say,

238
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:04,994
you know that feeling you have when you 
hear about someone crossing Ebola with 

239
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,550
smallpox,
that feeling you have in your body,

240
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,363
that's a real thing.
That feeling and that that's part of 

241
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:17,234
being

242
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,473
now

243
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,580
for the phenomenologists being is 
actually,

244
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,800
it's complicated
to define and it's hard to understand,

245
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,853
but what the phenomenologists do,
we start with a different set of 

246
00:15:31,551 --> 00:15:32,384
assumptions.
They don't assume that the best way to 

247
00:15:35,691 --> 00:15:36,524
approach reality is to break it up into 
the subjective and the object they 

248
00:15:39,951 --> 00:15:40,784
presume instead that the way that you 
should approach reality is by assuming 

249
00:15:43,671 --> 00:15:46,910
that all of your experiences real,
all of it.

250
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:47,923
Now,
that doesn't mean there are different 

251
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,750
categories of experience,
you know,

252
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:51,584
because you could still say a dream and 
the experience you have walked dreaming 

253
00:15:56,841 --> 00:15:57,674
of walking down the street and walking 
down the street are still different 

254
00:16:00,831 --> 00:16:02,960
things and the phenomenologists would 
say,

255
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:03,794
yes,
you can keep your categorical 

256
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,193
distinctions in tact,
but you have to say that they're both 

257
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:09,674
real.

258
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,623
Now

259
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,613
this is an assumption and I told you why
the assumptions generating part of the 

260
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:16,754
reason the assumption has generated the 
alternative assumption is because there 

261
00:16:19,641 --> 00:16:20,474
are problems that emerge with the set of
assumptions that make up the scientific 

262
00:16:25,371 --> 00:16:26,030
worldview.
Now,

263
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:30,020
it's not that surprising that the 
scientific worldview can't encompass the

264
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:34,790
subjective because the scientific world 
view was actually established by,

265
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,863
by Bacon and descartes safe and by well 
by other thinkers of that time it was 

266
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,124
set up to exclude the subjective from 
the conceptualization of objective 

267
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,374
reality.
So you can't really criticize science 

268
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:50,354
because he does that.
But you can say the fact that this 

269
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:57,971
objective is excluded is a fault or at 
least an incompleteness.

270
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,850
And that incompleteness sometimes has 
extraordinary,

271
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,013
extraordinarily serious consequences 
that you can't just dismiss because you 

272
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:07,731
might say,
well,

273
00:17:07,731 --> 00:17:08,564
had the Russians being the Soviet being 
successful in crossing Ebola with small 

274
00:17:13,601 --> 00:17:16,640
pox and aerosolizing it,
then we might all be dead.

275
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:17,863
And then you might think that any theory
that leads everyone to be dead might 

276
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:27,850
reasonably crypt be criticized for its 
assumption to universal truth.

277
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,880
Now you can debate that,
but,

278
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,500
and,
and rightly so,

279
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:34,334
but all I'm pointing out is there are 
reasons to go at this from another 

280
00:17:37,101 --> 00:17:37,934
approach.

281
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,830
Now,
it was Roger's basic assumption that,

282
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,230
okay,

283
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,063
you are more likely to be properly 
oriented in life if you adopted a 

284
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:51,624
phenomenal logical approach to your 
experience and to break up reality in 

285
00:17:57,991 --> 00:18:00,030
that manner.
So let me give you an example.

286
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,230
When I,
when my daughter was about three,

287
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,440
she have nightmare and she came running 
into

288
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,393
her parent's bedroom and
she told me her dream and she was all 

289
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,203
upset by it.
She might've even been younger than 

290
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:22,334
three at that point,
had she and dreamed that there was a 

291
00:18:24,651 --> 00:18:25,484
clear stream and that it was quite 
beautiful and that there was garbage 

292
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,650
littering the bottom of it.
Now by that time,

293
00:18:33,651 --> 00:18:34,484
you know,
she kids are quite sophisticated in 

294
00:18:35,871 --> 00:18:37,520
their ability to categorize.
You know,

295
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:41,480
by that time she'd already learned the 
difference between kid and adult things.

296
00:18:41,481 --> 00:18:45,440
And you think that's a bloody complex 
form of discrimination,

297
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,303
you know,
because like what objective features do 

298
00:18:48,801 --> 00:18:52,850
adult things sharing common that 
differentiates them from kid things?

299
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,860
You,
you can't actually come up with a set of

300
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,710
objective criteria that allows that 
distinction to be made.

301
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,390
But kids,
by the time they're three years,

302
00:18:59,391 --> 00:19:00,224
got a pretty clear grasp of that.
So they can come up with very 

303
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:05,300
sophisticated classifications,
um,

304
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,210
about the same time.

305
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:11,210
But one of my friends had a two year old
who went outside their house one day and

306
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:12,884
look down the street and there were a 
couple of garbage cans knocked over and 

307
00:19:14,931 --> 00:19:16,040
the kid said,
oh,

308
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,520
and you know that's also extremely 
sophisticated because you think,

309
00:19:19,521 --> 00:19:24,521
you know the a whole street is a very 
complex visual set of visual stimuli.

310
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,813
And to be able to glance at that and 
then to know that something is out of 

311
00:19:28,641 --> 00:19:32,540
place and then to make an utterance 
solid to draw people's attention to it,

312
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:36,020
is it ridiculously sophisticated 
cognitive out?

313
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,800
And my daughter was doing the same thing
within the context of her dream.

314
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,930
So she was upset about this.
Now it's quite interesting because you'd

315
00:19:43,931 --> 00:19:44,600
think,
well,

316
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,600
why would someone who was three be upset
about the fact that a stream beautiful,

317
00:19:50,601 --> 00:19:53,090
clear stream was but had garbage in it?

318
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,780
You know,
it's,

319
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,613
it's a really,
it's like innate environmentalism or 

320
00:19:57,711 --> 00:19:59,960
something like that and concerned for 
the environment.

321
00:19:59,961 --> 00:20:01,730
And that could easily be the case.
You know what I mean?

322
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,213
If we followed our environment up 
continually during our evolutionary 

323
00:20:07,131 --> 00:20:09,800
history that was likely to have very 
negative consequences.

324
00:20:09,801 --> 00:20:10,634
Even birds clean their own nest and so 
do with bees and you know they keep 

325
00:20:13,221 --> 00:20:14,054
their hives clean and all of that.
So it could be a very primordial 

326
00:20:16,731 --> 00:20:19,000
instinct.
Anyway,

327
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:22,370
she came in with the stream and she was 
quite upset and then you think,

328
00:20:22,371 --> 00:20:24,290
well there's a couple of things you 
could do about that.

329
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:29,150
You could say it's just a dream,
don't worry about it,

330
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,650
go back to sleep.
But you know,

331
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,750
that's a philosophical statement,
right?

332
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,623
And it's,
it's,

333
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,613
it's a misleading one.
Or You could argue that it was 

334
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:42,080
misleading one because what does,
it's just a dream mean.

335
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,760
Well it means that it's certainly not 
something to take.

336
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:50,050
Like you would take serious take 
something that occurred during the day.

337
00:20:50,051 --> 00:20:54,580
Seriously,
it's a mirror like a fantasy.

338
00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:00,620
But with the definition of fantasy being
some fundamentally useless

339
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,423
act of what the play,
I suppose that you can ignore with no 

340
00:21:11,741 --> 00:21:13,060
consequences.
And not only that,

341
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,670
but you should ignore it.
And you know,

342
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:19,690
that's,
that's not necessarily true because

343
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:22,563
then you're making the case or you might
be making the case that you don't have 

344
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:27,790
to pay attention to products of your 
imagination.

345
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,310
That seems like a pretty dopey thing to 
tell a child given a,

346
00:21:31,311 --> 00:21:32,144
that anything creative that you ever 
produced is going to come out of your 

347
00:21:34,691 --> 00:21:35,524
imagination and be the way that you set 
goals and plans for your future is by 

348
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,310
imagining them dreaming about them.
Right?

349
00:21:42,311 --> 00:21:44,500
Everyone knows what it means to pursue a
dream.

350
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,240
And you know,
you might say,

351
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:47,110
well,
if you're depressed,

352
00:21:47,111 --> 00:21:49,270
it means all your dreams have 
disappeared.

353
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,493
It's like so maybe you shouldn't be 
telling your child that it's just a 

354
00:21:54,851 --> 00:21:57,460
dream and so you can go,
you can ignore it and go back to sleep.

355
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,920
You know,
you don't know exactly what you're doing

356
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:01,300
when you,
when you do that,

357
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,630
you're certainly not paying attention to
the child's experience because it's,

358
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,980
she did have that image you had.
It did make her upset.

359
00:22:08,981 --> 00:22:09,814
And those are facts.
And as far as people like Rogers would 

360
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:14,050
be concerned,
those are facts about reality.

361
00:22:14,051 --> 00:22:17,710
Are there elements of reality?
And they should be dealt with as such.

362
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,343
So I told her to close her eyes and to 
bring the dream image at inner 

363
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,390
imagination,
which she could do very well.

364
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,453
And then to imagine that she had some 
rubber boots on and that she could go 

365
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:35,254
into the stream and pick out the garbage
and put it in the garbage bag and that 

366
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,750
there was a garbage can nearby and she 
could put it in the garbage can.

367
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:41,584
And so we went through that and that 
calmed her down and then she went back 

368
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:46,264
to bed.

369
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,590
And then you might say,
well,

370
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:52,900
what?
What am I doing doing that?

371
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:54,671
Because you might say,
well,

372
00:22:54,671 --> 00:22:56,530
that's just a fantasy.
Just like the dream.

373
00:22:56,531 --> 00:22:59,410
And because they're just fantasies,
neither of them have anything to do with

374
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:02,440
reality.
But you know that again,

375
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:03,274
that's not very sophisticated way of 
thinking because the dream presented my 

376
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:06,874
daughter with a problem.
Or You could even say a class of 

377
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:09,394
problems and the class of problems,
it includes all of those things that 

378
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:17,530
people do too.
And I and other animals,

379
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:20,080
of course,
all the ways that the environment can be

380
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:20,914
defiled.

381
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,120
Well that actually is an existential 
problem.

382
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,820
And then you might say,
well,

383
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,150
what should you do about it now?
So that might be,

384
00:23:31,151 --> 00:23:31,984
well,
maybe you should do something about it 

385
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,170
in so far as you can do something about 
it,

386
00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:39,700
because then you're conceptualizing 
yourself as an active agent and not just

387
00:23:39,701 --> 00:23:44,050
a passive victim or a passive recipient 
of the problem.

388
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,110
You could actually do something about it
and that's a way different messages.

389
00:23:48,111 --> 00:23:51,380
Then it's just a dream.
You can ignore it and go back to sleep.

390
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,050
You know what?
You've maybe you shouldn't actually tell

391
00:23:54,051 --> 00:23:56,360
your child to be ignoring reality and go
back to sleep.

392
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,553
Maybe you should be telling them to wake
up and see reality as clearly as they 

393
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:01,124
possibly can and not ignore any of it,
including their fantasies in their 

394
00:24:05,091 --> 00:24:05,924
dreams.
And that doesn't mean that they're 

395
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:07,634
fantasies have the same reality as the 
reality that you experience with 

396
00:24:11,121 --> 00:24:11,954
everyone else.
But the fact that it's not the same 

397
00:24:14,931 --> 00:24:15,764
reality that you experienced with 
everyone else doesn't mean it's not 

398
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:21,650
reality.
Now Rogers would claim for example,

399
00:24:21,651 --> 00:24:26,651
that to ignore a private experience,

400
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:29,693
yeah,

401
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,990
warps you fundamentally.

402
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:34,723
So

403
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,730
here's the basic outlines of his view of
the world.

404
00:24:37,731 --> 00:24:38,960
So there,
there's first of all,

405
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:43,520
you exist within a phenomenological 
field now phenomenon,

406
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:44,703
phenomenon and comes from the Greek word
famous thigh and famous thigh means to 

407
00:24:48,531 --> 00:24:49,364
shine forth.
And so phenomena are those things that 

408
00:24:53,181 --> 00:24:54,014
shine forth for you.
Now the way to understand that is to 

409
00:24:58,191 --> 00:25:03,191
imagine that you're reading a book and 
maybe a passage of it really strikes you

410
00:25:04,251 --> 00:25:06,470
as meaningful.
Well then you might say,

411
00:25:06,471 --> 00:25:08,600
well,
why?

412
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,960
There's lots of passages in the book.
If someone else was reading the book,

413
00:25:11,961 --> 00:25:16,220
it's not obvious that the same passage 
would strike them.

414
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,140
And then you might say,
well,

415
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,650
is that a consequence of the structure 
of you as as a,

416
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:23,300
as a,
as an interpreter of the book?

417
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,700
Or is it a consequence of the contents 
of the book?

418
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:28,100
And the answer to that is you actually 
can't tell because

419
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,810
the book is neither the thing that's 
printed nor the reader.

420
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:37,220
The book is the interaction between the 
reader and and the book.

421
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,160
And that interaction is actually unique 
for each person,

422
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,203
even though there might be some 
commonalities across people because 

423
00:25:43,101 --> 00:25:44,960
otherwise he wouldn't even be able to 
talk about a book.

424
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:47,723
Well,

425
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,770
regardless when you're interacting with 
something,

426
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:54,783
some things announced themselves on your
field of consciousness and other things 

427
00:25:58,601 --> 00:26:01,450
don't.
And so the phenomenologists would say,

428
00:26:01,451 --> 00:26:03,970
well,
some things shine forth for you.

429
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,560
Well,
other things don't.

430
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:07,683
It's a little bit like
one of Ewing's ideas about the 

431
00:26:12,611 --> 00:26:16,000
development of the self.
Don't believe that

432
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:21,340
if you follow the things that announced 
themselves to you as meaningful,

433
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,343
that they would take you through a 
descent to begin with where you would 

434
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:31,780
encounter things you were afraid of or 
terrified of and disgusted by and wanted

435
00:26:31,781 --> 00:26:32,614
to avoid.
And then the consequences of that would 

436
00:26:34,781 --> 00:26:37,960
be that you did incorporate a lot of new
material into your personality.

437
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:38,973
And the consequence of that would be 
you'd be reborn roughly speaking as a 

438
00:26:41,981 --> 00:26:44,970
stronger person.
And then if you just kept doing that all

439
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:45,804
the time for the rest of your life in 
small and large ways that you'd become 

440
00:26:48,391 --> 00:26:51,930
more and more and more fully 
differentiated and developed.

441
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,183
And he would have said that the,
the ultimate potential target of that 

442
00:26:57,331 --> 00:27:01,180
kind of development was what he 
described as the self.

443
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
The south is a multifaceted
conceptualization,

444
00:27:07,461 --> 00:27:08,294
so that's not all there is to it,
but the self from the union perspective 

445
00:27:11,061 --> 00:27:14,780
is who you could be if you could be who 
you most deeply are.

446
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,480
If you didn't shy away from anything,
if you,

447
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:22,930
if you accurately encountered and then 
integrated,

448
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,910
even in a phd,
Rdm sense your experience.

449
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:28,280
Now that's,
that's exactly the same idea that Rogers

450
00:27:28,281 --> 00:27:30,830
had.
He believed that

451
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,910
there's a phenomenal field and it's full
of experience.

452
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,103
All of your experience manifests itself 
as the phenomenal field is quite 

453
00:27:40,651 --> 00:27:41,484
interesting because if it means also 
that other people are part of your 

454
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:46,140
phenomenal field,
part of your experience,

455
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:48,323
and then that within that field there's 
a circumscribed area that he described 

456
00:27:53,941 --> 00:27:56,490
as the self that's different than the 
union itself.

457
00:27:56,491 --> 00:27:59,250
So it's somewhat terminal,
logically confusing.

458
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:00,683
Rogers self is more like Freud's ego,
but rogers would define the self as 

459
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:09,120
those aspects of the phenomenal logical 
field that you,

460
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:14,760
that you call I,
I felt like

461
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,800
I've had clients who tended to talk in 
the third person about their emotions or

462
00:28:23,551 --> 00:28:24,384
they would say the body,
they wouldn't say I maybe they're 

463
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,760
describing cutting themselves and they'd
say,

464
00:28:29,761 --> 00:28:34,760
well
the body needed to be cut.

465
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:36,933
And

466
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,080
what Rogers would say about that was 
that

467
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,263
person existed in the phenomenological 
field and part of that phenomenal 

468
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:50,090
logical field was demarcated by the 
self,

469
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,433
but the self hadn't expanded to 
incorporate as much of that 

470
00:28:54,201 --> 00:28:56,270
phenomenological field as it should 
have.

471
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:58,603
The other concept he had was the con.
Another concept he had was the concept 

472
00:29:01,401 --> 00:29:02,234
of the organism.
Now you could think of the self as what 

473
00:29:06,681 --> 00:29:07,514
you identify with it and then you can 
think of the organism as all those 

474
00:29:11,961 --> 00:29:15,380
things that are unique to you that you 
might identify with the eye.

475
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,873
Now it's tricky because imagine that you
get angry during the fight with some 

476
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:23,240
argument and they say you're angry and 
you say,

477
00:29:23,241 --> 00:29:25,060
no,
I'm not lost.

478
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:27,020
Like,
what exactly are you doing there?

479
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,183
The other person,
we're going to assume the other person 

480
00:29:29,281 --> 00:29:33,890
is right for the sake of this argument.
They can clearly see that you're angry,

481
00:29:33,891 --> 00:29:35,510
but you're not

482
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:37,913
allowing

483
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,033
the organism organismic manifestation of
motivational state or emotion to be 

484
00:29:44,261 --> 00:29:47,530
incorporated with those things that you 
identify with.

485
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:50,563
Rogers would call that in grows.
And he believed that in congruence was 

486
00:29:58,521 --> 00:30:03,521
roughly equivalent to psychopathology.
So that part of your goal was to,

487
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,053
was for the organism to respond 
appropriately to the broader 

488
00:30:15,301 --> 00:30:18,840
phenomenological field.
Now we can talk about what appropriately

489
00:30:18,841 --> 00:30:20,310
means,
but we won't do that yet.

490
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:24,900
And then what the south was supposed to 
do was accurately symbolically represent

491
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:28,590
organismic responses to the broader 
phenomenological field.

492
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:30,803
So now you can see that there are 
similarities between that concept and 

493
00:30:34,801 --> 00:30:38,130
say Freud's idea of the ego and the ID.
No,

494
00:30:38,131 --> 00:30:38,964
cause the Ed was this sort of external 
thing and that was the home of 

495
00:30:42,301 --> 00:30:46,230
motivational land,
emotional forces that couldn't be easily

496
00:30:46,231 --> 00:30:51,231
integrated into the ego and for partly 
because the Superego said,

497
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,280
for example,
that they were wrong.

498
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,310
And so there is this,
these sets of phenomena you know,

499
00:30:56,311 --> 00:30:59,100
that all of the different clinicians are
talking about,

500
00:30:59,101 --> 00:30:59,934
but all of them are talking about it 
starting from different initial 

501
00:31:02,221 --> 00:31:03,054
presuppositions and it's like
a group of people in the room shining a 

502
00:31:06,901 --> 00:31:08,940
flashlight on a very complex object.

503
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,773
You know,
they're all standing in a slightly 

504
00:31:10,261 --> 00:31:12,960
different position.
The complex object is the same thing,

505
00:31:12,961 --> 00:31:13,794
but you can only see parts of it.
And so you need both couple different 

506
00:31:16,411 --> 00:31:21,411
ways of looking at things so that you 
can come up with a cohesive and coherent

507
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:24,090
account of something that's actually 
beyond your understanding.

508
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:24,924
Because of course not only kit,
can you not accurately symbolically 

509
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:34,521
represent the phenomenal logical world,
the entire domain of your being.

510
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,930
You can't accurately represent even the 
organismic,

511
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,640
the aspect of that field that's related 
to the organismic you.

512
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:49,020
There's this part of you on top that you
identify with,

513
00:31:49,021 --> 00:31:49,854
I roughly speaking,
and it's trying to model a mortal of 

514
00:31:53,881 --> 00:31:54,714
something very complex.
And of course that's extraordinarily 

515
00:31:56,611 --> 00:31:59,040
difficult.
Now why is it doing that?

516
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,570
That's the central mystery of 
consciousness.

517
00:32:04,571 --> 00:32:05,404
You know there's this problem that 
consciousness researchers always 

518
00:32:09,221 --> 00:32:11,800
referred to.
It's an annoyingly termed,

519
00:32:11,801 --> 00:32:12,634
I think it's called the Zombie problem.
And the Zombie problem is the why is 

520
00:32:17,831 --> 00:32:18,664
consciousness unnecessary?
Like why is it necessary for something 

521
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,970
complex like a human being to actually 
have awareness and self awareness?

522
00:32:27,971 --> 00:32:28,804
Why couldn't it just wander through the 
world reacting in predetermined 

523
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:37,980
deterministic fashion?
Zombie like no awareness robot.

524
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:41,450
Like let's say what's consciousness for

525
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:49,410
Rogers doesn't really discuss that.
And so we won't at the moment,

526
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,930
although I think there are some 
reasonable ideas.

527
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,110
Consciousness,
for example,

528
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,700
I was used to generalize between certain
phenomena anyways,

529
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:03,840
regardless,
there's the self,

530
00:33:03,841 --> 00:33:06,150
the organism in the broader 
phenomenological field.

531
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,490
Let's say you go into a

532
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,640
pub bar

533
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:19,283
and you're,
you've been there many times and so you 

534
00:33:21,931 --> 00:33:23,610
know the people in there,
you know where to sit,

535
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,190
you know what's going to happen.
You met friends there.

536
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:28,980
You might say that your organism

537
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,110
exists

538
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,190
at least in part as a very accurate 
model of that broader,

539
00:33:35,191 --> 00:33:36,360
phenomenal,
logical world.

540
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,440
And then inside that
you're aware of your knowledge,

541
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:47,390
the bar.
And so

542
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:54,250
if your organism is properly adapted to 
the broader phenomenological field,

543
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,600
when you go into the bar or other 
familiar place,

544
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,793
things that you expect and want happen 
instead of things that you neither 

545
00:34:04,111 --> 00:34:06,040
expect nor one.
And you could say,

546
00:34:06,041 --> 00:34:10,630
well perhaps that's a reasonable
definition of adaptation though.

547
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:13,510
This isn't biological or evolutionary 
adaptation,

548
00:34:13,511 --> 00:34:16,370
right?
This is personal lab application there.

549
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:19,510
They're similar in some ways,
but importantly different.

550
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:21,923
I mean you can be adapted to an 
environment without that in any way 

551
00:34:24,251 --> 00:34:27,280
having any effect whatsoever on your 
evolutionary adaptiveness.

552
00:34:27,281 --> 00:34:28,114
So

553
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,353
okay,

554
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:32,733
now if you're,
maybe you're not very well organismic 

555
00:34:36,221 --> 00:34:39,640
Lee adapted to the environment,
you have a more love it.

556
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:43,270
And because of that,
when you go somewhere familiar,

557
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:44,223
people don't like you as much as you 
think they do and you're not nearly as 

558
00:34:47,651 --> 00:34:50,350
much of a master of that situation as 
you think you are.

559
00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:51,783
And what are the consequences of that?
So that would mean that your self 

560
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,753
representation is too rigid and 
simplistic and full of defenses to 

561
00:34:59,050 --> 00:34:59,883
notice the discrepancy between your 
organism and the broader environment 

562
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:06,430
that's pathological.
And the way that's going to be marked is

563
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,670
first by anxiety.
You know,

564
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,533
maybe you tell a joke,
there's some people sitting around you 

565
00:35:11,771 --> 00:35:13,660
to tell the joke and you see people kind
of,

566
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:16,150
you know,
making that face and maybe rolling their

567
00:35:16,151 --> 00:35:16,871
eyes.
It's like,

568
00:35:16,871 --> 00:35:18,580
well that's not exactly,
you might think,

569
00:35:18,581 --> 00:35:19,600
well they're joking,
you know,

570
00:35:19,601 --> 00:35:21,010
they're just,
they're just teasing me.

571
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,143
Well maybe they're not.
Maybe they're damn sickie or stupid 

572
00:35:23,651 --> 00:35:26,260
stories and you've told them 50 times 
and you're not very funny.

573
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,390
And they'd rather you work in the bar at
all.

574
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,630
And it may be that you'll actually 
notice that,

575
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,123
but you don't necessarily notice it in a
symbolically fully symbolically 

576
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,384
developed.
Now what that would mean is maybe you 

577
00:35:39,991 --> 00:35:44,991
start feeling anxiety and Roger's 
identify as different levels of feeling.

578
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:51,510
It might start with this subception and 
to sub seed something,

579
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,900
which is a word that I guess comes from 
general semantics,

580
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,363
is to
have the event affect the way that 

581
00:36:02,851 --> 00:36:07,620
you're interacting with the world in 
ways that you don't necessarily notice.

582
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:08,843
So it's sort of equivalent to the idea 
of subliminal when you're talking about 

583
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:13,104
advertising,
a message is flashed out unit Stokley 

584
00:36:16,351 --> 00:36:18,450
changes the way that you're interacting 
with the world.

585
00:36:18,451 --> 00:36:21,000
But you don't notice that that,
and that happens to people all the time.

586
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:23,310
I mean it's actually a part of our 
normal cognitive structure.

587
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,383
And when you walk into this room,
the room tells you all sorts of things 

588
00:36:27,901 --> 00:36:28,734
about how to behave and you don't notice
that the room is telling you those 

589
00:36:32,101 --> 00:36:32,934
things because you know what it's 
telling you so well that you just acted 

590
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,143
out.
You don't need to go through all the 

591
00:36:37,381 --> 00:36:41,280
complex processes of actually perceiving
and thinking about it.

592
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,533
And so Roger's point is that you can 
detect things organismic Lee that will 

593
00:36:46,801 --> 00:36:47,634
affect the nature of your experience 
without necessarily either even 

594
00:36:51,271 --> 00:36:54,690
perceiving that or definitely not 
symbolically representing it.

595
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:01,190
Now maybe the social discomfort that's 
inherit in the situation rises up to the

596
00:37:01,801 --> 00:37:04,680
level of perception that's not 
symbolization yet.

597
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:05,853
And then you might think,
well what does it feel like to be 

598
00:37:08,131 --> 00:37:08,964
anxious?

599
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,150
Well that,

600
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:15,870
and I'm not asking what are the 
objective markers of being anxious cause

601
00:37:15,871 --> 00:37:19,860
we actually don't know those.
We know we can kind of infer them.

602
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,203
Sometimes people's heart rate goes up 
but sometimes it decelerates and then 

603
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,090
there are facial expressions that are 
associated with anxiety.

604
00:37:27,091 --> 00:37:30,240
But you have to use those to infer.
If you get anxious,

605
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,000
I don't feel your anxiety,
I have to infer it.

606
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:33,953
But if you get anxious,
you feel your anxiety and so then the 

607
00:37:36,271 --> 00:37:39,090
question might be,
well what does it mean to feel anxious?

608
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:40,723
Well

609
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:42,723
that's a hard question and the reason 
it's a hard question is because you 

610
00:37:44,981 --> 00:37:48,790
never have to answer it because if you 
tell someone I felt anxious,

611
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:49,683
then they refer to their own feelings of
anxiety and then they know what you 

612
00:37:52,211 --> 00:37:53,044
mean.
And you never have to come up with an 

613
00:37:54,251 --> 00:37:57,880
explanation of what it feels like.
The feeling this,

614
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:58,863
the,
the idea that the feeling is an element 

615
00:38:00,491 --> 00:38:03,910
of experience is something that we just 
take for granted.

616
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,590
You know,
I got angry today.

617
00:38:05,591 --> 00:38:07,540
Everybody nods or maybe I tell a little 
story.

618
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:08,051
I didn't say,
well,

619
00:38:08,051 --> 00:38:08,884
you know,
I go out on the bus and I was missing 

620
00:38:10,481 --> 00:38:11,314
like 2 cents.
And I asked the bus driver if he would 

621
00:38:13,331 --> 00:38:16,420
let me get on the bus and he didn't.
And not really annoyed me because I take

622
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:20,810
that bus every day and the driver knows 
me and I got angry and everybody nod.

623
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,053
And the reason they know od is what 
partly because they can imagine that 

624
00:38:24,401 --> 00:38:26,410
that's how they would have reacted in 
that situation.

625
00:38:26,411 --> 00:38:27,244
But even more importantly,
they accept the reality of angry as a 

626
00:38:31,181 --> 00:38:33,310
response and they know what it feels 
like.

627
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:36,670
So,
but explaining it,

628
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:38,943
that's a much more difficult thing.
So the point is is that you can have 

629
00:38:43,181 --> 00:38:46,090
experiences that you know of.
First of all,

630
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:46,924
you can have experiences that you don't 
know that would be the sub sieved 

631
00:38:49,031 --> 00:38:49,864
experiences.
Then you can have experiences that you 

632
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:52,564
perceive,
but that you haven't symbolically 

633
00:38:54,371 --> 00:38:55,204
represented.
And those might be emotional or 

634
00:38:56,171 --> 00:38:57,004
motivational experiences.
And then you can have experiences that 

635
00:38:59,741 --> 00:39:00,574
you have symbolically represented in a 
way that that captures their just 

636
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:08,140
accurately in a way that's reflective of
your adaptation or lack thereof.

637
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:09,003
To the broader phenomenological world 
and Rogers would say that ladder state 

638
00:39:13,331 --> 00:39:14,260
is preferable.

639
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,343
You know how to act or you know that you
didn't act properly and you know how to 

640
00:39:22,271 --> 00:39:23,104
fix it,
which is almost as good and you 

641
00:39:24,671 --> 00:39:25,504
represent that accurately.
Now you might imagine that you could 

642
00:39:29,861 --> 00:39:30,694
concentrate on the mismatch between 
organismic responses and the 

643
00:39:34,301 --> 00:39:35,134
environment.
That's what behavior therapist really 

644
00:39:37,631 --> 00:39:38,980
do.
They say,

645
00:39:38,981 --> 00:39:39,814
well,
how are you acting and what are the 

646
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:42,334
consequences?
But that isn't really where Roger's 

647
00:39:44,381 --> 00:39:45,214
goes.
Rogers is more psychoanalytic then the 

648
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:50,104
behavior therapists and what he seems to
be primarily concerned of is about is 

649
00:39:53,411 --> 00:39:54,244
whether or not your self representation 
is an accurate representation of of how 

650
00:39:58,571 --> 00:40:02,080
your organism is responding.
In some sense for Rogers,

651
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:07,380
the organism takes the place of God.
It's more or less omniscient.

652
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:14,220
So your organism is going to tell you 
the truth in every situation and it's up

653
00:40:14,471 --> 00:40:15,304
to you whether or not you're going to 
pay attention to that and make sense of 

654
00:40:19,061 --> 00:40:19,894
it or whether you're going to engage in 
any of the different kinds of 

655
00:40:23,741 --> 00:40:24,574
shenanigans that you might engage in to 
stop yourself from going through the 

656
00:40:28,571 --> 00:40:30,700
complex process of symbolization.

657
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,860
Because you might say,
well,

658
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,440
you're back in the bar and you might 
say,

659
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,393
well,
you notice the anxiety and then you 

660
00:40:38,051 --> 00:40:40,540
know,
different ways of symbolizing it come to

661
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:43,960
mind.
These people are all people are all just

662
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:47,560
jerks.
And then another thing comes to mind is,

663
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:48,394
well maybe nobody likes me.
And then maybe another idea that's 

664
00:40:53,321 --> 00:40:55,330
associated with symbolization comes to 
mind,

665
00:40:55,331 --> 00:40:56,590
which is,
well,

666
00:40:56,591 --> 00:40:59,920
maybe there's elements of my social 
behavior that I should adjust.

667
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:05,500
And I presume that if Roger's was having
a conversation with one of his clients,

668
00:41:05,501 --> 00:41:06,334
he would assume that that was the most,
that was the most fruitful potential 

669
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,134
step towards accurate symbolization.
Now Roger's felt that anxiety emerged 

670
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:21,841
when the south concept was not 
accurately symbolically representing the

671
00:41:23,141 --> 00:41:23,974
organisms experiences.
And so that would be in some sense if 

672
00:41:27,491 --> 00:41:28,324
you're a house divided within yourself,
then your pathological from a Rogerian 

673
00:41:34,131 --> 00:41:34,964
perspective,
and you can think about that in some 

674
00:41:37,071 --> 00:41:41,600
sense as a move away from necessary 
simplicity

675
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,153
mean

676
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:45,533
if your self concept is set up property,
it doesn't contain contradictory and 

677
00:41:50,221 --> 00:41:53,460
misleading bits of information.
Everything works seamlessly together.

678
00:41:53,461 --> 00:41:56,970
And so what that would mean is that you 
think about something,

679
00:41:56,971 --> 00:41:57,804
you act it out and it works.
And then that's an indication that the 

680
00:42:02,491 --> 00:42:07,050
organization between say these different
three different levels of being is,

681
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,413
while the right word is ice to morphine,
each represents the other with 

682
00:42:11,401 --> 00:42:12,234
sufficient accuracy.
And so that means that you're congruent 

683
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,613
and if you're congruent,
then the world is treating you not only 

684
00:42:22,141 --> 00:42:23,730
in the manner that you want to be 
treated,

685
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,090
but also in the manner that's most 
likely

686
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:28,563
two

687
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:33,170
further your actions in the world as an 
organism.

688
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,813
And so that's partly why Rogers believed
that the organism had wisdom because 

689
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:39,403
it's natural proclivity was to operate 
in the world effectively and to expand 

690
00:42:45,531 --> 00:42:47,090
its competence.
At the same time

691
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,920
I was self actualized person because 
that's one of Roger's phrases is someone

692
00:42:54,141 --> 00:42:56,990
who self concept accurately represents 
their organismic

693
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:58,123
Ba.

694
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:09,480
Now Rogers was primarily a clinician as 
well

695
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,350
and his theories were derived from his 
clinical experience

696
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:19,413
and his theories informed his clinical 
practice and Roger's invented or 

697
00:43:23,471 --> 00:43:24,304
developed when he believed to be a new 
kind of therapy and he called that 

698
00:43:28,601 --> 00:43:29,434
client centered therapy.
Now you've probably heard about student 

699
00:43:32,051 --> 00:43:32,884
centered education in Rogers.
I ideas have had a tremendous amount of 

700
00:43:36,641 --> 00:43:37,474
influence,
certainly not at least in educational 

701
00:43:38,831 --> 00:43:42,430
psychology also in conflict reduction of
various sorts.

702
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,293
Yeah.

703
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,600
You start with Rogers initial 
assumptions,

704
00:43:47,601 --> 00:43:48,434
which is first of all that you should 
regard your experience as real second 

705
00:43:53,841 --> 00:43:54,674
that your organism will give you 
accurate information about the totality 

706
00:43:58,611 --> 00:44:02,210
of experience
and third,

707
00:44:02,211 --> 00:44:07,160
that your self concept should accurately
encompass your actual experience.

708
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,980
There are implications of that theory 
for therapy.

709
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:16,030
And one of the implications is that you 
can figure out what you should do if you

710
00:44:16,281 --> 00:44:17,114
want to because your organism
will tell you or at least hint at you 

711
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:28,160
about which directions are correct and 
which directions are.

712
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:33,330
And if you follow those,
then you're going to naturally gravitate

713
00:44:33,331 --> 00:44:34,164
towards a state of being where you're 
more and more accurately represented by 

714
00:44:37,111 --> 00:44:38,550
yourself,
but also that

715
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:44,130
your representation and your organism 
are going to act more effectively in the

716
00:44:44,131 --> 00:44:44,964
world.
They're not bumping up against each 

717
00:44:45,871 --> 00:44:50,871
other all the time and you know,
there no one even conflict anymore.

718
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:57,660
And so that's the goal of the self 
actualized person if therapy

719
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:04,020
in part is the art of furthering that 
process of self actualization.

720
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,300
Now Rogers,

721
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:13,413
yeah,

722
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:19,130
Rogers was opposed to
diagnosis because he felt that it didn't

723
00:45:23,431 --> 00:45:27,660
sufficiently
represent the

724
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:34,220
vital minutia of the client's individual
experience.

725
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:35,963
And I think that's,
I think that his plane was extremely 

726
00:45:40,891 --> 00:45:42,630
important.
No,

727
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:43,483
because
medicine psychiatry tends to declassify 

728
00:45:49,891 --> 00:45:52,890
everything
and you might say,

729
00:45:52,891 --> 00:45:53,724
well,
are the psychiatric diagnostic 

730
00:45:54,631 --> 00:45:55,464
classifications real?
And then answer that is it depends on 

731
00:45:59,461 --> 00:46:02,490
what you mean by real anyway.
Think,

732
00:46:02,491 --> 00:46:05,280
well that's an annoying answer,
but it is.

733
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:06,203
It is still the answer.
And so I could say if I was being 

734
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:10,793
cynical,
although I don't really think it's a 

735
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:15,570
cynical response,
if I was willing to sound cynical,

736
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,213
that the only reason that psychiatrists 
diagnose their clients is so that 

737
00:46:20,551 --> 00:46:21,384
insurance companies can pay the bills.
And I actually believe that that's more 

738
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:25,824
true than the claim that the psychiatric
diagnostic categories accurately 

739
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:33,150
actually capture the essence of the 
person's problems.

740
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:38,430
In my clinical experience,
classification

741
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:40,793
has had almost a zero utility.
And the reason for that is because it's 

742
00:46:43,741 --> 00:46:44,574
too low resolution.
It doesn't capture the individual 

743
00:46:46,741 --> 00:46:47,574
property.
Because the thing about a client 

744
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:54,840
clinical client is that it's precisely 
their individuality.

745
00:46:54,841 --> 00:46:55,674
That's the fundamental issue.
It's like they have to make their way 

746
00:46:58,801 --> 00:46:59,634
through the world in their body and 
their in their time and their position 

747
00:47:04,921 --> 00:47:08,100
in culture with their advantages and 
disadvantages.

748
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:13,140
And that requires
our unique,

749
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:17,070
a solution that's unique in many ways.
And one that's also personal.

750
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:26,180
And Rogers also wasn't a particularly
great fan of the psychoanalysts tendency

751
00:47:29,651 --> 00:47:34,651
to look for the causes of present 
behavior in past events.

752
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,473
So he didn't,
he didn't regard fishing in the past as 

753
00:47:41,681 --> 00:47:42,514
a useful,
necessarily useful expedition or as a 

754
00:47:46,471 --> 00:47:47,304
necessary expedition.
Although if issues of the past came up 

755
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:52,870
in therapy,
he was perfectly willing to,

756
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:56,200
to,
to deal with them.

757
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:57,713
He didn't accept except the Freudian in 
theory that the fundamental cause of 

758
00:48:01,451 --> 00:48:06,451
psychopathology was saying traumatic 
past experience.

759
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,230
Right

760
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:16,370
now this gives Rogerian therapy a 
particular flavor.

761
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:20,300
You could also call it non directive 
therapy.

762
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:24,110
Now if you're a behavior therapist,

763
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:33,070
you might actively strategize with your 
client about what they're going to do in

764
00:48:33,561 --> 00:48:37,010
the next week and then once they've 
established their goals,

765
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:38,503
you might offer some hints about what 
strategies they could use to monitor 

766
00:48:41,991 --> 00:48:42,824
themselves and to attain those goals and
maybe you'll even have them keep track 

767
00:48:46,911 --> 00:48:50,000
of it.
Roger's generally speaking,

768
00:48:50,001 --> 00:48:50,834
wouldn't do something that directed and 
in fact he strove not to unduly 

769
00:48:56,001 --> 00:48:59,650
influence the client's decisions about 
important future of.

770
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:04,750
And in that way he was quite similar to 
Freud because Freud would sit behind,

771
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,540
would sit.
So the client would be laying on a couch

772
00:49:08,541 --> 00:49:13,400
and Freud would set so that the client 
is patient actually couldn't see him and

773
00:49:13,401 --> 00:49:16,280
then he would listen to the person free 
associate,

774
00:49:16,281 --> 00:49:18,800
which in some sense means that they 
would ramble on.

775
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:20,183
And he was attempting by doing that to 
facilitate the self realization of 

776
00:49:27,861 --> 00:49:29,840
their,
of their own memories.

777
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:34,070
If things happen to you in your past and
they still cars you emotion,

778
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:36,800
let's say they're more than 18 months 
old for the sake of argument,

779
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:38,653
Freud would assume that if you kind of 
wandered around that memory somewhat 

780
00:49:41,571 --> 00:49:42,404
haphazardly and in an in an association 
will weigh the way conversations 

781
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:50,420
naturally unfold,
that you would bring things to light and

782
00:49:50,421 --> 00:49:52,850
that would allow certain kinds of 
emotional expression and that,

783
00:49:52,851 --> 00:49:56,360
and in fact in itself would be curative.
But for,

784
00:49:56,361 --> 00:49:57,194
I didn't want to with your fear with 
that process or guide it to any great 

785
00:49:59,031 --> 00:50:00,740
degree.
And so rogers was like that.

786
00:50:00,741 --> 00:50:01,574
He,
he wanted you to make your own 

787
00:50:02,331 --> 00:50:03,164
decisions.
So he believed that the therapeutic 

788
00:50:06,021 --> 00:50:11,021
endeavor required
could not,

789
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:15,730
could not occur unless certain 
conditions were met

790
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,510
and the conditions were

791
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:25,120
willingness to tell the truth.
So

792
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,090
when we're not,
when a client comes to see me,

793
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:34,610
one of the first things I tell them is,
you can tell me anything you want.

794
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:40,070
Although you're perfectly within your 
rights to maintain your privacy.

795
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:44,570
You can tell me anything that you want,
but tell me the truth as much as clearly

796
00:50:44,571 --> 00:50:45,830
as you can.
Because if you don't,

797
00:50:45,831 --> 00:50:48,080
there isn't,
I don't know what's going on with you.

798
00:50:48,081 --> 00:50:51,770
And there's not a possibility,
not any possibility at all that I can,

799
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:53,203
that this process will be useful if 
we're talking about things that don't 

800
00:50:57,021 --> 00:50:57,854
exist.
So one precondition is the person is 

801
00:51:00,081 --> 00:51:03,650
willing to come and see you because that
means they want to transform.

802
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:07,610
The second precondition is that they're 
going to communicate with you.

803
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,690
And communication means they're going to
do their best to tell the truth.

804
00:51:11,691 --> 00:51:13,310
But the therapist takes the same

805
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:16,323
vow in a sense.
And so one of the things that I tell my 

806
00:51:18,431 --> 00:51:23,431
clients is that I will never let them do
anything that makes me resent them.

807
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:25,533
So if I'm asked to step out of my way 
for some reason to take an additional 

808
00:51:29,081 --> 00:51:32,200
session or maybe to meet them somewhere 
and I do it,

809
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:37,620
they can be assured that there won't be 
a price that will be extracted from them

810
00:51:38,861 --> 00:51:43,750
later for interfering with the smooth 
flow of my day.

811
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:48,760
So,
and the other thing that I do,

812
00:51:48,761 --> 00:51:52,120
and I've learned this from Rogers and 
from the other people I've read,

813
00:51:52,121 --> 00:51:57,121
is that I listen to people talk and then
sometimes something will occur to me and

814
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:00,303
I don't think about it as I thought 
something because I'm actually somewhat 

815
00:52:05,051 --> 00:52:09,700
a follower of Nick Nietzsche's dictum,
which is that the fact that you think is

816
00:52:09,701 --> 00:52:10,534
no proof that the fact that you 
experienced thoughts is no proof that 

817
00:52:14,861 --> 00:52:18,040
you thought.
They just appear.

818
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:19,893
Well,
you don't think that you think up your 

819
00:52:20,621 --> 00:52:21,910
dreams,
right?

820
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,730
You have your dreams.
There you are in band.

821
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:27,430
They're the dreams.
Are you having them?

822
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:30,010
Well,
it doesn't seem like it.

823
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:30,873
It seems like you're experiencing this 
in some sense the same way experienced 

824
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,580
the external world.
You know what voluntary creating them.

825
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:40,600
Well why do you think anything different
about your thoughts?

826
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:45,440
And that's a very useful thing to 
realize by the way.

827
00:52:45,441 --> 00:52:46,274
Because otherwise you think your your 
thoughts and then if you have negative 

828
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:49,064
thoughts while then you assume that 
they're true and they're not true just 

829
00:52:53,031 --> 00:52:53,864
because you think them,
they're just thoughts and maybe they're 

830
00:52:55,371 --> 00:52:57,410
true and maybe they're useful and maybe 
they're not.

831
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,280
So stepping back from them a little bit 
is incredibly,

832
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:03,320
it's like Buddhist detachment in a 
sense.

833
00:53:03,321 --> 00:53:04,154
It's an incredibly useful thing to do.
I mean that's another thing that's 

834
00:53:06,651 --> 00:53:09,980
really characteristic of modern people 
because especially if they're smart,

835
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,740
they think,
they think first of all,

836
00:53:13,010 --> 00:53:18,010
and second they think that the things 
they think are true and neither of those

837
00:53:18,081 --> 00:53:18,914
things are necessarily true.
And abandoning your belief in the makes 

838
00:53:21,891 --> 00:53:22,724
you
much less rigid and much more able to 

839
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:32,243
expand your preconceptions or even 
radically change them when the 

840
00:53:34,921 --> 00:53:38,250
circumstances demand them.
So

841
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:41,813
the person has to be
wanting to change in principal in a 

842
00:53:45,991 --> 00:53:46,824
positive direction.
They have to be willing to tell the 

843
00:53:48,811 --> 00:53:49,644
truth.
Then the next element of Rogerian 

844
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:53,490
psychotherapy is something that he 
called

845
00:53:55,410 --> 00:54:00,410
unconditional positive regard
and unconditional positive regard.

846
00:54:02,991 --> 00:54:07,940
And the Rogerian tradition is something 
like radical acceptance.

847
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:13,490
It's actually a hallmark of modern child
rearing techniques.

848
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:19,570
You should wholeheartedly accept all 
aspects of the person's being.

849
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:26,620
Now,
Rogers believed that are positive,

850
00:54:28,071 --> 00:54:32,000
that partly because he also believed in,

851
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:35,910
what was it called,

852
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,640
conditions of worth.

853
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,690
Here's a condition of worth.
I don't like you when you act like that.

854
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:51,050
So you imagine you might tell a child 
that,

855
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:52,813
I don't like you when you act like that,
and maybe you tell them that about a 

856
00:54:56,571 --> 00:54:57,404
bunch of things that they do,
but maybe those are integral parts of 

857
00:55:00,981 --> 00:55:05,981
the child's Ba and by making your lack 
of acceptance,

858
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:10,543
no,
you make it impossible for the child to 

859
00:55:14,271 --> 00:55:15,104
incorporate those aspects of his 
organism organismal experience into his 

860
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:19,673
self concept.
You can see echoes of the Super Ego 

861
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:27,500
Eagle idea there.
And so rogers would say,

862
00:55:27,501 --> 00:55:28,334
well,
if someone comes into psychotherapy and 

863
00:55:30,561 --> 00:55:32,900
experiences unconditional positive 
regard,

864
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:37,340
that means that they'll be able to 
reveal those elements up there.

865
00:55:37,370 --> 00:55:42,370
Organismic experienced that have been 
rejected and say by the social world and

866
00:55:42,561 --> 00:55:43,394
themselves
experienced them and then potentially 

867
00:55:47,481 --> 00:55:51,290
incorporate them within the self concept
and that that's going to be a good thing

868
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:52,543
because rogers is a great believer in 
the natural inevitability of positive 

869
00:55:56,750 --> 00:56:01,750
transformation.
If if you set that up as your goal,

870
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:03,703
he also believes that that should be 
your goal and that it's actually your 

871
00:56:06,711 --> 00:56:10,490
natural goal.
If for example,

872
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,020
you haven't been subjected to arbitrary 
conditions of worth.

873
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:18,783
Yeah.

874
00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:21,410
Now I'm going to read you something that
Rodger's road,

875
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:27,160
which is quite interesting and I think I
found it extremely effective.

876
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:42,210
Oh yes.
That's another thing I should mention.

877
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:48,020
There is one other important assumption 
in the idea of self actualization.

878
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,753
The other thing that Roger's tried to 
ensure that his clients develop was 

879
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:04,530
autonomy and independence.
Now for Rogers,

880
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:11,360
there was very little difference between
the move towards autonomy and in any and

881
00:57:11,731 --> 00:57:15,840
personal independence and the process of
self actualization.

882
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,753
Now,

883
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:27,860
given that we're looking back at Roger's
work 50 years later,

884
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:34,900
you might ask yourself is if
autonomy and independence is a necessary

885
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:42,340
precondition for psychological health
because you could make the case that

886
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:49,420
productive interdependence
and more communal orientation is equally

887
00:57:50,301 --> 00:57:51,134
healthy,
but that's not a Rogerian 

888
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,233
presupposition.

889
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:58,213
So

890
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:02,180
his ideal is the fully functioning 
individual.

891
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:15,500
So here's his hypothesis with regards to
psychotherapy,

892
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:18,583
assuming a minimal mutual willingness to
be in contact and to receive 

893
00:58:22,341 --> 00:58:23,174
communications,
we may say that the greater the 

894
00:58:26,151 --> 00:58:26,984
communicated congruence of experience,
awareness and behavior on the part of 

895
00:58:29,991 --> 00:58:30,824
one individual,
the more the ensuing relationship will 

896
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:37,040
involve a tendency towards reciprocal 
communication with the same qualities,

897
00:58:38,330 --> 00:58:39,163
mutually accurate understanding of the 
communication's improved psychological 

898
00:58:42,681 --> 00:58:43,514
adjustment and functioning in both 
parties and mutual satisfaction in the 

899
00:58:46,131 --> 00:58:48,140
relationship.
Okay,

900
00:58:48,141 --> 00:58:52,850
so let's unpack that.
Assuming a minimal mutual willingness to

901
00:58:52,851 --> 00:58:55,190
be in contact and to receive 
communication.

902
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,113
Well,
the first thing you might say is that 

903
00:58:56,671 --> 00:58:59,060
it's pretty much though the hallmark of 
a relationship,

904
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:02,330
right?
Because if you're not in contact,

905
00:59:02,331 --> 00:59:04,100
while clearly you don't have a 
relationship,

906
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,050
and if you are in contact but you're not
communicating,

907
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,900
you probably don't have a relationship.
Yeah.

908
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,740
All right.
So,

909
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:13,763
and you know,
that also begs the question of exactly 

910
00:59:15,031 --> 00:59:15,864
what a relationship is for,
and that's something that's very much 

911
00:59:18,601 --> 00:59:19,434
worth considering because people don't 
really usually know what a relationship 

912
00:59:22,431 --> 00:59:23,264
is for.
They certainly know that as a general 

913
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:26,810
rule,
they're going to pursue them,

914
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:29,600
but they don't really have any idea,
in some sense,

915
00:59:29,601 --> 00:59:34,190
what the optimal state is or what the 
desired finance state should be.

916
00:59:34,350 --> 00:59:35,183
You know,
of course the desired final state 50 

917
00:59:37,371 --> 00:59:38,750
years ago was marriage,

918
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:42,300
but
I don't,

919
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:46,600
it's certainly the case now that most 
people who are couples aren't married.

920
00:59:47,770 --> 00:59:48,940
Now you might ask yourself,
well,

921
00:59:48,941 --> 00:59:49,774
what's the utility of a relationship and
what's the utility of a longterm 

922
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:54,873
relationship?
While the Rogerian answer to that would 

923
00:59:58,121 --> 01:00:03,121
be
the more based on trust,

924
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:08,303
the relationship is,
the more likely that you're going to be 

925
01:00:12,551 --> 01:00:14,890
in contact and to receive 
communications.

926
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:20,810
And then as a consequence of that,
you're going to

927
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,473
become better and better at representing
your organismal experience within your 

928
01:00:31,221 --> 01:00:32,054
self concept.
And that's going to facilitate your 

929
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:37,750
movement towards self awareness and self
actualization.

930
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:41,980
It's a two brains are better than one 
idea.

931
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,111
So we say,
well,

932
01:00:44,111 --> 01:00:46,270
we established a relationship.
Okay.

933
01:00:46,271 --> 01:00:49,180
And the goal of our relationship is to 
make things better.

934
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:51,213
And we,
we make a presupposition that the way 

935
01:00:52,721 --> 01:00:57,340
you make things better is by telling the
truth as you see it.

936
01:00:57,670 --> 01:01:00,730
So remember,
this is a phenomenological theory.

937
01:01:00,731 --> 01:01:05,110
And so the truth that Rogers is talking 
about isn't objective truth.

938
01:01:05,111 --> 01:01:08,890
And I suspect that that,
at least in part because establishing an

939
01:01:08,891 --> 01:01:13,060
objective truth within the confines of a
relationship is I think it's technically

940
01:01:13,061 --> 01:01:13,894
impossible.
And we talked about that before because 

941
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:17,193
each interaction between the members of 
a couple or people in any relationship 

942
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:26,350
is contaminated in a sense by all of the
other interactions they've ever had.

943
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:29,260
Plus everything they bring to bear on 
the situation.

944
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,610
And there's just no untangling that 
objective.

945
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:34,260
You know?
What did you mean when you said that?

946
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,190
That.
Well,

947
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:36,270
God,
you know,

948
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:40,200
you can argue about that for,

949
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:43,620
to the point of divorce and for 10 years
afterwards,

950
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:44,773
you know,
without ever coming to a satisfactory 

951
01:01:45,931 --> 01:01:47,820
conclusion.
All right?

952
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:49,013
The grade greater,
the communicated congruence of 

953
01:01:50,641 --> 01:01:51,474
experience,
awareness and behavior on the part of 

954
01:01:52,711 --> 01:01:53,544
one individual,
the more the ensuing relationship will 

955
01:01:55,591 --> 01:01:59,040
involve a tendency towards reciprocal 
communication with the same quality.

956
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:00,420
Okay?
So here's the idea.

957
01:02:00,870 --> 01:02:03,380
You go see a psychotherapist or a jury 
psychotherapist,

958
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,253
and at least in principle,
this is someone who's mastered or is it 

959
01:02:07,831 --> 01:02:12,150
tempting to master these basic modes of 
being?

960
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:14,340
So what they're going to do is they'll 
tell you,

961
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:17,460
I'm going to tell you the truth as I see
it.

962
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:22,890
And so the way I see that happening in 
psychotherapy is that when someone comes

963
01:02:22,891 --> 01:02:24,960
to see me,
I listened to them.

964
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:29,310
And that means that I'm not distracted 
by anything else.

965
01:02:29,311 --> 01:02:32,940
I'm not thinking about anything else.
I'm not thinking about what I'm going to

966
01:02:32,941 --> 01:02:33,774
say next.

967
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,630
I'm not thinking about the things I have
to do today.

968
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:40,830
I'm not thinking about the last time I 
saw this person.

969
01:02:40,831 --> 01:02:41,664
I'm not allowing my attention to wander 
away from the person and then I'm 

970
01:02:46,441 --> 01:02:47,274
watching them
and listening to them at the same time 

971
01:02:50,641 --> 01:02:52,920
and those are the same things because to
really listen to someone,

972
01:02:52,921 --> 01:02:53,754
you also have to watch them because then
you sub c perhaps or perceive all the 

973
01:02:57,811 --> 01:03:00,690
nonverbal elements of communication that
go along well,

974
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:01,553
partly with voice tone,
but a with I direction and partly with 

975
01:03:04,171 --> 01:03:06,880
very subtle transformations of facial 
gesture.

976
01:03:06,881 --> 01:03:08,160
So sometimes,
for example,

977
01:03:08,370 --> 01:03:11,640
I see on my clients that they'll all of 
a sudden turn into a child.

978
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:12,503
It's very interesting.
It's like there'll be recounting some 

979
01:03:14,161 --> 01:03:14,994
experience.
It's like fixation from a Freudian 

980
01:03:16,531 --> 01:03:17,690
perspective.
There'll be,

981
01:03:18,110 --> 01:03:20,100
there'll be describing some experience 
from the,

982
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:21,083
from the distant past and for a second 
there expression will approximate who 

983
01:03:24,661 --> 01:03:27,060
they were when they were six years old.
It's really,

984
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:27,953
it's really something remarkable to see 
and you can see these things if you 

985
01:03:30,691 --> 01:03:34,470
really pay attention and then as they 
talk,

986
01:03:38,310 --> 01:03:39,143
I'm watching what's happening inside me 
as I listened to their words and all 

987
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:47,370
sorts of things will happen.
Sometimes I'll get an image or sometimes

988
01:03:47,371 --> 01:03:48,204
I'll get a memory of something we talked
about before or sometimes I'll notice 

989
01:03:51,901 --> 01:03:52,734
that what they're saying right now is 
different than something they said five 

990
01:03:55,171 --> 01:03:56,400
minutes ago.
And so then I'll say,

991
01:03:56,401 --> 01:03:57,780
wait a sec.
No,

992
01:03:58,020 --> 01:03:58,853
I'm trying to understand what you're 
telling me and I noticed that you just 

993
01:04:01,831 --> 01:04:02,664
said this and it seems to imply this,
but then you know a couple of minutes 

994
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:07,343
ago when we were talking about that,
then you said this and I don't see how 

995
01:04:09,541 --> 01:04:10,374
those two things are the same and I'm 
not doing that because I want them to 

996
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:16,463
rectify the paradox.
I'm doing that because I want to 

997
01:04:19,801 --> 01:04:20,634
understand what they are saying.
And if someone says 80 u and then they 

998
01:04:23,431 --> 01:04:25,350
say be,
you don't know what they're saying.

999
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:28,770
And so the question is for 
clarification,

1000
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:32,220
there's no other direction than that.
And then maybe,

1001
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:34,140
you know,
I'll have little image,

1002
01:04:34,141 --> 01:04:36,180
like the sort of a fragment of a dream 
and I'll say,

1003
01:04:36,181 --> 01:04:39,690
wait a second with what you just said 
when you said what you just said,

1004
01:04:39,691 --> 01:04:40,524
this is what I experienced.
And then maybe we'll talk for awhile 

1005
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:45,230
about what that might mean.
And,

1006
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,350
and I'll,
I can say to them what,

1007
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,610
so for example,
sometimes,

1008
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:53,820
sometimes people will come to my office 
and they do all sorts of strange things.

1009
01:04:53,821 --> 01:04:54,654
Like I had one client who had
psychosomatic epilepsy and one of the 

1010
01:05:01,691 --> 01:05:04,720
first times I saw her,
she had a seizure in my office.

1011
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:06,273
And,
uh,

1012
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:07,503
I was watching her and it didn't really 
matter to me that she was having a 

1013
01:05:10,961 --> 01:05:11,794
seizure.
And I thought that's pretty weird 

1014
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:15,610
because normally when someone's having a
seizure,

1015
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:18,180
it's like you get affected

1016
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:18,810
by it,
right?

1017
01:05:18,810 --> 01:05:19,830
I mean there's,
there's,

1018
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:20,693
there's sensations that emerge in your 
mid section and there's thoughts of 

1019
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:26,820
emergency and,
and you know,

1020
01:05:26,821 --> 01:05:29,520
cause your body in some sense is 
mimicking their body,

1021
01:05:29,521 --> 01:05:32,130
which is what your body does all the 
time when you're talking to people.

1022
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:33,173
And that produces a sense of urgency.
And I just sort of watched her have the 

1023
01:05:36,241 --> 01:05:37,230
seizure and I thought,
oh,

1024
01:05:37,231 --> 01:05:40,650
it's not real.
It's not real seizures.

1025
01:05:40,780 --> 01:05:42,810
But she was very good at it and you 
know,

1026
01:05:42,811 --> 01:05:43,644
as far as she was concerned,
she couldn't tell if the seizures were 

1027
01:05:45,211 --> 01:05:46,044
real or not.
And sometimes if you have cycle genic 

1028
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:49,344
epilepsy,
you've had an epileptic seizure at one 

1029
01:05:51,211 --> 01:05:55,290
point that was genuine.
Well it's very exceptionally complicated

1030
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,750
and it's not easy to develop psychogenic
epilepsy,

1031
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:58,913
but
she had developed it and part of the 

1032
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:03,260
reason was

1033
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:06,423
that she thought that she was toying 
with the idea at that existence as a 

1034
01:06:10,121 --> 01:06:15,121
psychiatric patient would require less 
effort and responsibility and so she got

1035
01:06:15,431 --> 01:06:16,264
tangled up at one point with one of the 
mental hospitals and they diagnosed her 

1036
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:22,630
with paranoid schizophrenia,
which is not something I would recommend

1037
01:06:22,631 --> 01:06:24,610
it,
especially if you don't actually have it

1038
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:25,863
because once you've got the diagnosis,
well are you really going to know that 

1039
01:06:30,071 --> 01:06:31,830
you what's going to happen?
Hey,

1040
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:35,160
you do something like that.
You have a psychogenic epileptic seizure

1041
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:36,093
and a variety of other symptoms there.
The consequence of a very complex 

1042
01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:42,543
complex in in union terms,
there is a secondary motivation and 

1043
01:06:45,791 --> 01:06:49,240
Friday in terms you go through with the 
whole routine,

1044
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:53,020
then you end up in a psych hospital and 
you see four experts and they tell you a

1045
01:06:53,021 --> 01:06:53,854
paranoid schizophrenia.
Do you really think you're going to not 

1046
01:06:55,571 --> 01:06:58,360
believe that or at least 10% of you is 
going to believe it.

1047
01:06:58,361 --> 01:06:59,194
You're going to wonder after that.
And if another 20 people tell you that 

1048
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:05,080
and you're put on medication,
which you could easily be,

1049
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:06,273
then a year later while you might still 
not have paranoid schizophrenia but you 

1050
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:11,830
are not going to be doing very well.
So

1051
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:15,763
well that's a good example of what 
happens when your self concept and 

1052
01:07:18,621 --> 01:07:23,060
you're organismic valuing systems aren't
working carefully in tandem

1053
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:25,723
anyway.
So someone might be telling me a story 

1054
01:07:28,281 --> 01:07:28,791
that's,
you know,

1055
01:07:28,791 --> 01:07:29,624
like a story,
a story about something terrible that 

1056
01:07:31,311 --> 01:07:34,460
happened to them and like I'll just be 
sitting there like a brick wall.

1057
01:07:34,461 --> 01:07:38,780
It's like you're not effecting me.
And sometimes don't tell people that.

1058
01:07:38,781 --> 01:07:39,650
It's like,
I don't know why,

1059
01:07:39,651 --> 01:07:41,150
but you know,
that's a pretty terrible story.

1060
01:07:41,151 --> 01:07:43,670
But I'm having no emotional response to 
it at all.

1061
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:47,150
Do you have any reason you have any idea
why that might be?

1062
01:07:48,290 --> 01:07:49,430
Well then maybe we'll,
you know,

1063
01:07:49,431 --> 01:07:52,610
often people aren't very happy when you 
tell them that and that's fine.

1064
01:07:52,611 --> 01:07:54,830
They can be unhappy with that.
That's perfectly okay.

1065
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:58,700
But the thing is now they know that 
there's at least one person that they've

1066
01:07:58,701 --> 01:08:01,160
communicated with who's actually telling
them the truth,

1067
01:08:01,850 --> 01:08:04,400
who is actually not affected by their 
story.

1068
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:08,150
Because look,
if someone sits down beside you and they

1069
01:08:08,151 --> 01:08:08,984
tell you a terrible story,
the probability that you're going to 

1070
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:12,254
tell them that that had no effect on you
is basically zero because really rude 

1071
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:20,480
not to be negatively affected by someone
who's telling you a very sad story.

1072
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:24,530
But if you're negatively affected by it,
I just know a true,

1073
01:08:24,531 --> 01:08:25,364
you're not doing them any good at all.
All you're doing is providing them with 

1074
01:08:27,321 --> 01:08:28,154
evidence to maintain what could easily 
become a delusion if they worked on it 

1075
01:08:30,891 --> 01:08:33,470
long enough.
By contrast.

1076
01:08:33,471 --> 01:08:34,304
Sometimes people will come into my 
office and they'll tell me something 

1077
01:08:37,131 --> 01:08:40,790
that just seems trivial and it make me 
tear up.

1078
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:43,730
So which means I can actually feel 
emotions.

1079
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:45,433
It'll make me tear up,
but it's just something they just 

1080
01:08:46,761 --> 01:08:48,500
barely,
they barely alluded to.

1081
01:08:48,501 --> 01:08:49,334
You know,
I've got a client a while back told me 

1082
01:08:50,721 --> 01:08:51,554
that we had had a session family session
where I had suggested to some of the 

1083
01:08:58,161 --> 01:08:58,994
members of this person's family that 
things might go better for them and 

1084
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:07,430
their child,
who was one of my clients,

1085
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:08,653
if for the next two weeks,
what they practice doing was watching 

1086
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:18,191
each other's behavior during the day and
finding one thing that they could make a

1087
01:09:20,151 --> 01:09:21,350
positive comment about.

1088
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:23,030
Now,
and this isn't a game,

1089
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:25,880
like if you play it as a game,
then it isn't going to work.

1090
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:26,923
If you're going to do this properly,
what you do is you watch and then you 

1091
01:09:29,481 --> 01:09:30,314
notice when the person does something 
that actually makes you feel positively 

1092
01:09:33,141 --> 01:09:36,890
towards them and then you tell them you 
did this.

1093
01:09:36,891 --> 01:09:39,350
It has to be specific.
It can't be at the end of the day.

1094
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:40,970
While you were pretty good today.
It's like,

1095
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:43,340
no,
that's not going to work and you have to

1096
01:09:43,341 --> 01:09:47,180
notice something they actually did.
It's usually something trivial,

1097
01:09:47,181 --> 01:09:48,500
like,
um,

1098
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:49,933
I really appreciate the fact that you
took your dirty dinner plate off the 

1099
01:09:55,041 --> 01:09:57,260
table and rinsed it off and put it in 
the dishwasher.

1100
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,360
It's like,
you think that's so damn trivial.

1101
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:01,010
It's hardly worth commenting on.
It's like,

1102
01:10:01,011 --> 01:10:01,490
no,
no,

1103
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:02,271
no.
It's not at all.

1104
01:10:02,271 --> 01:10:04,970
That's exactly the sort of specific 
thing that you comment on.

1105
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:08,600
If it did in fact make you happy.
You know,

1106
01:10:08,601 --> 01:10:10,280
when you can think about that in 
behavioral terms,

1107
01:10:10,281 --> 01:10:10,851
you could say,
well,

1108
01:10:10,851 --> 01:10:15,560
if you don't,
if you want someone to do something that

1109
01:10:15,561 --> 01:10:18,440
you like,
you should tell them when they do things

1110
01:10:18,441 --> 01:10:21,230
that you like,
so that they know what you like.

1111
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:23,960
But of course that means that you're 
putting yourself on the line too,

1112
01:10:23,961 --> 01:10:24,794
right?
Because if the person knows what you 

1113
01:10:25,611 --> 01:10:27,080
like,
then they can withhold it from you.

1114
01:10:27,081 --> 01:10:29,300
And so you're not going to do that 
unless you trust them.

1115
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:31,160
You're really not.
So you know,

1116
01:10:31,161 --> 01:10:31,994
you might be in a relationship,
you might be in a marriage where never 

1117
01:10:35,181 --> 01:10:36,014
once during the whole bloody marriage.
Do you ever tell the other person what 

1118
01:10:38,391 --> 01:10:40,370
actually makes you happy?
It's like that's,

1119
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:41,263
that's stupid by the way.
So like if you want to have a really 

1120
01:10:44,061 --> 01:10:46,430
miserable time of it,
that's an excellent way to start.

1121
01:10:46,430 --> 01:10:47,263
You could also add to that the 
presumption that if they really loved 

1122
01:10:49,791 --> 01:10:51,050
you,
they know what you liked,

1123
01:10:51,170 --> 01:10:52,003
which is also what
your partners no smarter than you 

1124
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:02,180
generally speaking and you don't have a 
clue what it's going to make them happy.

1125
01:11:02,181 --> 01:11:03,950
So I don't know why you'd expect them 
to,

1126
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:04,933
especially if they're male,
while you'd expect them to return the 

1127
01:11:07,311 --> 01:11:10,100
favor.
So then you teach them,

1128
01:11:10,101 --> 01:11:12,140
you know,
like probably take four years.

1129
01:11:12,141 --> 01:11:15,480
It's like I like when you do this and 
then of course they won't.

1130
01:11:15,481 --> 01:11:17,460
So you might have to mention it again in
a month.

1131
01:11:17,461 --> 01:11:18,061
You might think,
well,

1132
01:11:18,061 --> 01:11:21,690
it's going to take 18 months to train 
this person at least,

1133
01:11:21,691 --> 01:11:22,680
I mean,
they're smart,

1134
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:25,590
they're smarter than a dog,
but not much smarter.

1135
01:11:25,591 --> 01:11:26,424
So you have to be,
you have to use repetition and you have 

1136
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:30,900
to be judicious about it.
And if you do that,

1137
01:11:31,090 --> 01:11:31,923
and now that person is also doing that 
to you and you both know that you're 

1138
01:11:34,141 --> 01:11:34,974
doing that and you're both trying to 
make things better than you're going to 

1139
01:11:37,981 --> 01:11:39,750
communicate about it.
And then with any luck,

1140
01:11:39,751 --> 01:11:42,570
things will get better.
But that means you actually have to want

1141
01:11:42,571 --> 01:11:43,530
things to get better.

1142
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:47,220
And that's part of the problem of 
course,

1143
01:11:47,221 --> 01:11:49,350
because not everybody wants things to 
get better.

1144
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:50,573
And there's a part of everyone that 
would be just as happy if they didn't 

1145
01:11:52,321 --> 01:11:55,640
get better.
So anyways,

1146
01:11:57,650 --> 01:11:58,483
Roger's idea is that if you
communicate properly with the person 

1147
01:12:02,991 --> 01:12:03,824
that you're in the relationship with,
that you can model proper being in some 

1148
01:12:07,461 --> 01:12:08,294
sense,
and that at least you can attempt 

1149
01:12:10,011 --> 01:12:11,600
tomorrow it.
And then as you attempt it,

1150
01:12:11,601 --> 01:12:14,300
you'll get better and better at it.
And as you get better at it,

1151
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:16,940
the other person will get better at it.
But that works too.

1152
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:20,480
So I had a client who was very anxious 
person.

1153
01:12:20,481 --> 01:12:21,314
So when the person first came to see me 
and they couldn't even talk on the 

1154
01:12:24,111 --> 01:12:27,500
phone,
and now they're doing,

1155
01:12:29,270 --> 01:12:31,550
they're acting publicly,
they're acting in public.

1156
01:12:32,210 --> 01:12:35,110
And that's been the consequence of about
seven years of,

1157
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:40,540
I would say Rogerian conversations were 
almost all that I did was listen,

1158
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:43,693
now the uncover,
I don't quite get the unconditional 

1159
01:12:46,671 --> 01:12:47,504
positive regard thing,
although I know white rodgers said it 

1160
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:50,833
and his idea that arbitrary conditions 
of worth can make someone pathological 

1161
01:12:54,261 --> 01:12:56,150
or true,
but

1162
01:12:57,820 --> 01:12:58,653
I think a more nuanced sense of 
unconditional positive regard is what 

1163
01:13:01,331 --> 01:13:02,164
happens when you watch the person and 
they tell you something and as they're 

1164
01:13:04,151 --> 01:13:04,984
telling it to you,
you can see a little part of them sort 

1165
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:08,073
of come alive and that often happens 
when their face loses a fair bit of its 

1166
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:15,640
rigidity and you can see more of what 
they were like when they were a child,

1167
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:18,400
sort of peeping through.
So their face sort of opens up.

1168
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:21,340
You can think a hot that was really good
for that person.

1169
01:13:21,341 --> 01:13:22,174
Whatever they've been telling me that 
they'd be doing that was right on the 

1170
01:13:24,341 --> 01:13:25,600
right track.
And then you can say,

1171
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:26,434
look,
I noticed that when you talked about 

1172
01:13:27,311 --> 01:13:28,144
this,
you know,

1173
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:29,920
your,
your face for the ox do,

1174
01:13:29,930 --> 01:13:31,660
you didn't look as anxious.
You were smiling,

1175
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,670
you know,
and it was a genuine smile.

1176
01:13:33,671 --> 01:13:34,504
And for like a second or two there you 
looked like you were doing well and you 

1177
01:13:36,791 --> 01:13:37,624
were happy.
It's like,

1178
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:41,170
let's do a bunch more of that because 
you know,

1179
01:13:41,171 --> 01:13:44,230
if you see in someone that they're 
capable of experiencing that,

1180
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:48,040
then you could help them experience that
more.

1181
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:51,430
And that's the purpose of a longterm 
relationship

1182
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:53,833
is that

1183
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:55,663
you have your weaknesses and 
inadequacies and you can't think the 

1184
01:13:59,050 --> 01:14:02,720
think yourself out of them by yourself,
partly because they colored the way that

1185
01:14:02,721 --> 01:14:03,554
you think.
And so you need somebody else to bang 

1186
01:14:05,181 --> 01:14:06,014
yourself up against to contend with so 
that all the knots in your soul can get 

1187
01:14:10,281 --> 01:14:13,750
ironed out and you're doing the same 
thing for the other person.

1188
01:14:13,751 --> 01:14:15,970
And then both of you are on an upward 
spiral.

1189
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:21,010
And in some sense that's the core theory
of Rogerian psychotherapy.

1190
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:26,710
It's like genuine,
honest communication can heal people and

1191
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:31,510
genuinely disown his communication can 
make them pathological.

1192
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:34,900
And
in some sense,

1193
01:14:34,901 --> 01:14:39,901
I think Roger's got closer to the truth.
If you invert Rogers presupposition,

1194
01:14:41,431 --> 01:14:42,264
that's as close to the truth as any 
psychotherapist is gone to see makes 

1195
01:14:46,731 --> 01:14:49,480
people pathological.
And that's true.

1196
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:52,450
A lot of,
and you'll notice this as well,

1197
01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:53,403
a lot of what you're doing in 
psychotherapy and in any genuine 

1198
01:14:55,271 --> 01:14:59,410
relationship is a moral endeavor.
You're trying to make things better,

1199
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:05,880
and if the other person is deceiving 
themselves or lying or failing to become

1200
01:15:05,921 --> 01:15:07,770
aware of things that they should become 
aware of,

1201
01:15:07,930 --> 01:15:08,763
they're going to get bent and twisted 
out of shape and then they're not going 

1202
01:15:11,501 --> 01:15:12,334
to be congruent,
congruent with their body or with the 

1203
01:15:13,631 --> 01:15:14,464
broader world,
and then they're going to suffer and 

1204
01:15:16,811 --> 01:15:17,644
then that will cascade.
Then all sorts of things will start to 

1205
01:15:19,241 --> 01:15:20,150
happen.
And you know,

1206
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:24,160
that's the past to perdition and an 
involuntary trip to the underworld.

1207
01:15:26,350 --> 01:15:27,183
When we meet again,
I think I'll show you a little clip of 

1208
01:15:29,621 --> 01:15:34,180
Rogerian psychotherapy because a woman 
in the 1950s agreed to be filmed,

1209
01:15:34,360 --> 01:15:36,580
which had a dramatic effect on her life,
by the way.

1210
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:37,793
But,
um,

1211
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:38,711
it,
it presented,

1212
01:15:38,711 --> 01:15:39,544
provides a nice
real world illustration of what Rogers 

1213
01:15:43,541 --> 01:15:45,750
is doing when he's trying to listen.
