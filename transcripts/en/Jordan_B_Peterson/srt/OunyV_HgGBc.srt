1
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:07,943
If
you pay attention to the things that 

2
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:15,000
shine forth because what you're seeing 
is the reality instead of the map,

3
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,600
you're gaining access to the real 
information that's in the world.

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,750
It's not pre packaged information 
because that can be false.

5
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:22,763
It's the real information flowing up 
from the ground of being and if you pay 

6
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:26,034
attention to that,
it will help you move towards the goals 

7
00:00:28,771 --> 00:00:31,890
that you've already established for 
yourself as a good citizen that are,

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,620
that are part of the inbuilt value 
structure that you've adopted,

9
00:00:34,621 --> 00:00:36,510
but at the same time it will do 
something else.

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,780
It will lead you to transform the nature
of those goals because as you pursue the

11
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:46,860
thing that guides your interest and more
and more information is revealed.

12
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,640
Then by absorbing that information which
is learning,

13
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:53,850
essentially you build yourself into a 
different person,

14
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:56,910
a stronger and more informed person and 
a more,

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,953
a more intact person,
a person with more integrity and with 

16
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:01,074
more straight than with more direction 
and at the same time you differentiate 

17
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:06,630
your map and so you're living more and 
more in the real world.

18
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:07,643
So as you approach your specific goal,
even if it's a culturally conditioned 

19
00:01:10,051 --> 00:01:10,884
goal,
the learning that you do along the way 

20
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,660
transforms you and it transforms the 
nature of your goal.
