1
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,710
Good afternoon and welcome colleagues 
invited guests,

2
00:00:08,711 --> 00:00:09,544
members of the general public who are 
following today's proceedings of the 

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,910
Standing Senate committee on legal and 
constitutional affairs.

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:17,583
Today we continue our consideration of 
Bill CC and act to amend the Canadian 

5
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,610
Human Rights Act and the criminal code.
And with this,

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,473
our last day of hearings on the bill,
we will move to clause by clause 

7
00:00:30,881 --> 00:00:31,714
consideration tomorrow with us today for
the first hour or Jordan b Peterson 

8
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:37,714
professors,
psychology department at the University 

9
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,210
of Toronto and from the D dot,
Jared Brown Professional Corporation,

10
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,050
a d,
jared brown lead counsel.

11
00:00:47,051 --> 00:00:49,450
Uh,
thank you gentlemen for being here.

12
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,320
You both have up to five minutes for 
opening statements.

13
00:00:53,321 --> 00:00:56,230
And Mr Peterson,
I believe you're going to lead off.

14
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,610
Yes sir.
The floor is yours.

15
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:01,323
So I think the first thing I'd like to 
bring up is that it's not obvious when 

16
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,210
considering a matter of this sort what 
level of analysis is appropriate.

17
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,290
If you're reading any given document,
you can look at the words or the phrases

18
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:15,124
are the sentences or the complete 
document or you can look at the broader 

19
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:22,801
context within which it is likely to be 
interpreted and when I first encountered

20
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:25,960
bill [inaudible] and its surrounding 
policies,

21
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,063
it seemed to me that the appropriate 
level of analysis was to look at the 

22
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:32,500
context of interpretation surrounding 
the bill,

23
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:33,663
which is what I did when I went and 
scoured the Ontario Human Rights 

24
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,630
Commission webpages and examine its 
policies.

25
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,033
I did that because at that point the 
Department of Justice had clearly 

26
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:45,484
indicated on their website in a link 
that was later taken down that bill see 

27
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,993
16 would be interpreted in within the 
precedence policy precedence already 

28
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:56,770
established by the Ontario Human Rights 
Commission.

29
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,920
So when I looked on the website,
I thought,

30
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:02,110
well,
there's broader issues at stake here.

31
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,810
And I tried to outline some of those 
broader issues.

32
00:02:04,811 --> 00:02:07,330
In the initial.
You may or may not know.

33
00:02:07,331 --> 00:02:12,331
I made some videos criticizing bill c 16
and it's and a number of.

34
00:02:12,371 --> 00:02:14,920
It's a of the policies that surrounding 
it.

35
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,143
And I think the most egregious elements 
of the policies are that it requires 

36
00:02:21,131 --> 00:02:22,900
compelled speech,
the,

37
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:23,734
uh,
the Ontario Human Rights Commission 

38
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,483
explicitly states that refusing to refer
to a person by their self identified 

39
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:32,344
name and proper personal pronoun,
which is the pronouns that I was 

40
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:40,381
objecting to a can,
the can be interpreted as harassment.

41
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:42,184
And so that's,
that's explicitly defined in the 

42
00:02:43,721 --> 00:02:45,350
relevant policies.
Um,

43
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,570
so I think that's appalling,
first of all because there hasn't been a

44
00:02:49,571 --> 00:02:50,404
piece of legislation that requires 
Canadians to utter a particular form of 

45
00:02:54,161 --> 00:02:57,850
address that has particular ideological 
implications before.

46
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,220
And I think that it's aligned that we 
shouldn't cross.

47
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,250
Um,
then I think that the,

48
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:08,200
the definition of identity that's 
enshrined in the surrounding policies is

49
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,240
ill defined and poorly thought through 
and also incorrect.

50
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:16,983
It's incorrect in that identity is not 
and will never be something that people 

51
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,234
define subjectively because your 
identity is something that you actually 

52
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:28,750
have to act out in the world as a set of
procedural tools,

53
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,793
which most people learn.
And I'm being technical about this 

54
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:36,040
between the ages of two and four.
It's a fundamental human reality.

55
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,620
It's well recognized by the relevant 
say,

56
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:39,454
developmental psychological authorities,
and so the idea that identity is 

57
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:43,864
something that you define purely 
subjectively is an idea without status 

58
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:50,920
as far as I'm concerned.
I also think it's unbelievably dangerous

59
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,053
for us to move towards a representing a 
social constructionist view of identity 

60
00:03:57,521 --> 00:03:58,660
in our legal system.

61
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,793
The social constructionist view insists 
that human identity is nothing but a 

62
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:06,340
consequence of socialization,
which is which and,

63
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,420
and there's an inordinate amount of 
scientific evidence suggesting that that

64
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:12,514
happens to not be the case.
And so the reason that this is being 

65
00:04:16,061 --> 00:04:16,894
instantiated into law is because the 
people who are promoting that sort of 

66
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:21,604
perspective,
or at least in part because the people 

67
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:23,614
who are promoting that sort of 
perspective know perfectly well that 

68
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:27,910
they've lost the battle completely on 
scientific grounds.

69
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,253
It's implicit in the policies of the 
Ontario Human Rights Commission that 

70
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:33,920
sexual,
uh,

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,520
identity,
a biological sex,

72
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,950
gender identity,
gender expression,

73
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,013
um,
sexual proclivity all vary 

74
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,230
independently.
And that's simply not the case.

75
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:47,080
It's not the case scientifically.
It's not the case factually.

76
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,153
And it's certainly not something that 
should be increasingly taught to people 

77
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:52,420
in high schools,
elementary schools,

78
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:53,980
and junior high schools,
which it is,

79
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:55,180
and it is being taught.

80
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,133
I included this,
a cartoon character that I find 

81
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:00,814
particularly reprehensible,
aimed obviously at it as it is at 

82
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:04,384
children's,
somewhere around the age of seven that 

83
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,873
contains within it the implicit can be 
implicit claims as a consequence of its 

84
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:14,470
graphic mode of expression that these 
elements of identity,

85
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:16,780
our first canonical and second 
independent.

86
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:19,600
And neither of those happened to be the 
case.

87
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,003
I think that the inclusion of gender 
expression in the bill is something 

88
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:29,830
extraordinarily peculiar given that 
gender expression is not a group.

89
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:32,680
And that according to the Ontario Human 
Rights Commission,

90
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,810
it deals with things as mundane as how 
behavior and outward appearance,

91
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:39,310
such as dress,
hair,

92
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,230
makeup,
body language,

93
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:43,540
and voice,
which now as far as I can tell,

94
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:47,710
a open people to charges of hate crime 
under bill [inaudible] 16,

95
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:50,350
if they dare to criticize the manner of 
someone's dress,

96
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:53,020
which seems to me to be an entirely 
voluntary issue.

97
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:58,650
So I think that the Ontario Human Rights
Commission's,

98
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,253
uh,
attitude towards vicarious liability is 

99
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,133
designed specifically to be punitive in 
that it makes employer's responsible 

100
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:08,690
for,
um,

101
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:09,823
harassment or discrimination,
including the failure to use a 

102
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,830
preferred,
preferred pronouns.

103
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:16,723
They have vicarious liability for that.
Whether or not they know what's 

104
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:20,324
happening,
whether or not the harassment was and 

105
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:25,610
whether or not the harassment was 
intended or unintended.

106
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:28,370
So all stopped with that.
Thank you.

107
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,263
Mr Brown.

108
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,033
I'm a litigator in Toronto,
act and all manner of commercial and 

109
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:36,170
employment disputes.
I'm not an academic.

110
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,250
I live with my clients in the land 
illegal reality and how the law actually

111
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:42,680
works.
About two years ago,

112
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:43,514
I began to see claims of discrimination 
included in every employment related ct 

113
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:47,054
claim.
My phone now rings weekly with human 

114
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:50,510
rights.
Tribunal matters.

115
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,810
It has become a reality for employers 
across Canada.

116
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,440
In August of last year,
I became aware of Dr Jordan Pearson.

117
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,200
He was discussing

118
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,630
what he saw as a problematic law,
poorly written.

119
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,730
That's when I observed the oddest thing 
happening.

120
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:07,160
Lawyers,
academic lawyers,

121
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,460
important people began to say that he 
had the legal stuff wrong.

122
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,480
Nothing unusual about this bill,
and they also said,

123
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,450
you don't get to go to jail if you 
breach a human rights tribunal order.

124
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,273
What was happening is they weren't 
defending the law but downplaying its 

125
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:23,510
effects.
Now,

126
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:24,344
as a practicing lawyer,
anytime a lawyer and particularly an 

127
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:28,670
academic says,
look away,

128
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:31,370
there's nothing to see here.
It gets my antenna way up.

129
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:33,643
So I did some research which can be 
found in the brief that I filed in 

130
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:38,480
advance of today.
It sets out the path,

131
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:42,980
the prison on this I knew as a 
commercial litigator that anyone can end

132
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:45,230
up in jail if you breach a tribunal 
order.

133
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:47,960
It is a simple civil contempt of court 
process.

134
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:51,620
People go to jail for this,
but what about the freedom of expression

135
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:52,454
issue?

136
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,300
It's a foundational issue.
We all know that section two,

137
00:07:56,301 --> 00:08:00,290
b of the charter sets out that everybody
has the fundamental freedoms of thought,

138
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,390
belief,
opinion and expression,

139
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,213
and we all know that the government is 
successfully restricted freedom of 

140
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:09,050
expression over the years.
But what if rather than restricting what

141
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:09,884
you can say,
the government actually mandated what 

142
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:14,240
you must say.
In other words,

143
00:08:14,241 --> 00:08:16,460
instead of legislating that you cannot 
defame someone.

144
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:18,200
For instance,
the government says,

145
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:20,030
when you speak about a particular 
subject,

146
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,893
let's say gender,
you must use this government approved 

147
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:24,554
set of words and theories.
The American jurisprudence clearly 

148
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:32,450
defines this is unconstitutional 
compelled speech in Canada.

149
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,313
The Supreme Court has annunciated the 
principle that anything that forces 

150
00:08:36,441 --> 00:08:39,560
someone to express opinions that are not
their own is a penalty.

151
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,753
That is to Talbot's Herrion and as such,
alien to the tradition of free nations 

152
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:44,804
like Canada.
Now to see [inaudible] get us to 

153
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:49,650
compelled speech,
the Minister of Justice is summarized.

154
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:53,780
Bill see 16 as the enactment amends the 
Canadian Human Rights Act to that gender

155
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:54,614
identity and gender expression to the 
list of prohibited grounds of 

156
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:57,414
discrimination.
The Department of Justice website used 

157
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:01,764
to say that we must look to the Ontario 
Human Rights Commission policies for 

158
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:04,824
definitions on these terms.
Ontario's policies on gender identity 

159
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,114
and gender expression are so my brief.
They state that gender based harassment 

160
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:15,750
can involve refusing to refer to a 
person by their self identified name and

161
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:16,584
proper personal pronoun,
refusing to refer to a trans person by 

162
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:20,064
their chosen name,
and a personal pronoun that matches 

163
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:24,180
their gender identity will likely be 
discrimination.

164
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,703
The law's otherwise unsettled as to 
whether someone can insist on any one 

165
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,083
gender neutral pronoun in particularly 
if the Harasser didn't know or didn't 

166
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:34,590
intend to harass.
It's still harassment.

167
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,030
Now,
why is this important?

168
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,433
Well,
in Ontario Human Rights Commission as a 

169
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:40,200
policy development creature of the 
legislature,

170
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,140
it creates the policies which interpret 
the code,

171
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,340
but what is most important,
the tribunal must follow these policies.

172
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,620
It is bound by them so the commission 
creates the law on pronouns and Ontario.

173
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,583
The policies on pronouns were introduced
into the legal framework after the law 

174
00:09:56,071 --> 00:10:00,930
had left the legislature federally,
the same process will be followed as the

175
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:01,763
Department of Justice had said so a 
similar guideline will be developed as 

176
00:10:04,381 --> 00:10:05,214
with the Ontario policies.
Federal guidelines must be followed by 

177
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:10,470
the federal tribunal.
The guidelines will mandate pronouns.

178
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,390
This will happen after the bill leaves 
the Senate,

179
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,410
mandating use of pronouns requires one 
to use words that are not their own,

180
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,130
which imply a belief in or an agreement 
with a certain theory on gender.

181
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,593
If you try to disavow that theory,
you can be brought before the human 

182
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:27,640
rights commission for Ms Dot gendering 
or potentially find yourself guilty of a

183
00:10:27,641 --> 00:10:30,300
hate crime.
To sum up on the subject of gender,

184
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:34,740
we're going to have government mandated 
speech now in a on the constitutionality

185
00:10:34,741 --> 00:10:35,574
of the proposed bill,
the Department of Justice said on its 

186
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:38,490
website,
look,

187
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,160
there's a variation of this bill that 
already exists in most of the provinces.

188
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,200
I don't believe that's a robust argument
in favor of constitutionality.

189
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,323
I would refer you to the comments of the
now Chief Justice Mclaughlin of the 

190
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,920
Supreme Court and the decision to 
Taylor.

191
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,330
It's in my brief.
The chilling effect of leaving overbroad

192
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,960
provisions on the books cannot be 
ignored.

193
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:58,943
While the chilling effect of human 
rights legislation is likely to be less 

194
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,480
significant than that of a criminal 
prohibition,

195
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,583
the vagueness of the law means it may 
well determine more conduct than can 

196
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:09,750
legitimately be targeted as a lawyer on 
the ground,

197
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,913
I worry about poorly drafted a poorly 
drafted law and its impact on my 

198
00:11:13,261 --> 00:11:14,940
clients.
As a Canadian,

199
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,940
I worry about parliament tacitly 
authorizing compelled speech.

200
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:19,883
The brief I provided to the committee 
contains a comprehensive legal opinion 

201
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:25,410
that I published back in December on 
[inaudible].

202
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,543
There's a table that shows how the 
federal human rights regime mirrors the 

203
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:33,100
Ontario system in terms of enforcement 
of policies and guidance or wrap up sir.

204
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,573
And finally,
it includes the case law that underpins 

205
00:11:36,301 --> 00:11:37,530
the opinion.
Thank you.

206
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,013
Thank you both.
And we'll begin the questions beginning 

207
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:42,684
with a different.

208
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:43,990
Sure.
So Baker.

209
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,323
Thank you.
Thank you Mr. Chairman and thank you to 

210
00:11:46,681 --> 00:11:51,681
the witnesses for their presentation.
As the witnesses know,

211
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,310
the nine provinces in Canada,
uh,

212
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,313
have,
uh,

213
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:00,910
uh,
the,

214
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:01,744
um,
the provision in their laws including 

215
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:07,054
Ontario and also the words expression,
as I recall appears in four or five 

216
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:14,780
provinces.
Um,

217
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:20,670
so what you are arguing is against what 
we already have in law,

218
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,433
your reference to the criminality to,
to the sections of the criminal code at 

219
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:31,084
our last meeting,
senators wow correctly pointed out that 

220
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,380
sections three,
18 and slash 19

221
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,380
starts off by genocide
under the heading genocide.

222
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:50,220
The next heading is a public incitement 
likely to lead to a breach of the peace.

223
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:54,790
And you know,
what a breach of the peace is,

224
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:59,530
Mr Brown,
willful promotion of hatred.

225
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,343
These things are.
And then there are defenses listed as 

226
00:13:05,561 --> 00:13:07,540
you know,
in that criminal code provision,

227
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,050
there are several defense,
if you honestly believe in what you said

228
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,370
is if,
if you,

229
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,240
you know,
the,

230
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,910
the defenses are extensive in the 
criminal code,

231
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:18,460
they've worked well for Canada.

232
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:20,883
So

233
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,340
what do you have to say about the facts 
of what's presently in the criminal code

234
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:31,920
and your reflection that somehow,
uh,

235
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,033
the genocide heading,
the heading on public incitement on 

236
00:13:37,301 --> 00:13:38,134
willful promotion of hatred somehow that
these provisions should not be included 

237
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:43,750
under those headings?

238
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:45,903
I think I have to be clear,
my presentation relates to the 

239
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:50,170
amendments of the human rights code or 
the Criminal Code,

240
00:13:50,171 --> 00:13:51,004
and that is in fact how a one like Dr 
Peterson may in fact find themselves on 

241
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:57,790
the wrong side of jail.
And so if you have,

242
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,200
if you've reviewed the,
uh,

243
00:13:59,201 --> 00:14:04,201
the publication in the opinion,
I say that a simply by breaching the,

244
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:08,560
a proposed amendment to the,
uh,

245
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,710
to the human rights act,
um,

246
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:15,100
and particularly with somebody who is 
deliberately doing so for instance,

247
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:17,530
somebody was saying,
I'm not going to use those words,

248
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,550
that person,
if they are dragged before the tribunal,

249
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,490
the Ontario Tribune or the federal 
tribunal,

250
00:14:24,491 --> 00:14:25,324
I've indicated to you already that the 
Department of Justice has said they're 

251
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:30,400
going to pass the same guideline on 
pronouns.

252
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,350
And so what I'm suggesting to you is 
that if somebody says,

253
00:14:35,351 --> 00:14:38,620
I'm not going to use those words are 
brought before the tribunal,

254
00:14:38,621 --> 00:14:39,454
the Federal Tribunal and the tribunal 
then delivers an order for payment of a 

255
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:44,590
fine.

256
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:48,120
And alternatively a nonmonetary remedy.
I,

257
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,800
he cease and desist order,
uh,

258
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,540
an order to do something,
to compel them to do something.

259
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,090
And that person who's brought before the
tribunal says,

260
00:14:56,091 --> 00:14:59,540
I'm not doing that.
They will find themselves in contempt of

261
00:14:59,541 --> 00:15:00,374
court and prison is the likely outcome 
of that process until they purge the 

262
00:15:05,481 --> 00:15:07,160
content.
That's what I'm suggesting.

263
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,530
I'm not suggesting to you that,
uh,

264
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,670
that the,
uh,

265
00:15:10,671 --> 00:15:12,830
amendments to the criminal code,
um,

266
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,580
well I'm,
I'm not advocating genocide.

267
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:18,180
I guess let's just say that.
And My,

268
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,043
my presentation here is,
is restricted to what I see as the 

269
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:23,870
Pronoun policy issue in the compelled 
speech issue.

270
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:24,973
So it covers the provincial legislation 
if you distraught to disagree with that 

271
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:31,910
we've had in place in the provinces for 
decades in some cases,

272
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:32,873
is the policies that were enacted after 
it left the legislature and which will 

273
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:38,760
be enacted after this bill leaves this,
the,

274
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:39,703
this committee.

275
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,043
I would also like to add to that the 
fact that once I made the video stating 

276
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:48,790
that I wouldn't use the Z and Zer 
pronouns,

277
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:49,624
for example,
which I regard as part of the 

278
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,263
ideological linguistic vanguard,
the university lawyers after carefully 

279
00:15:56,021 --> 00:15:56,854
considering what I said,
sent me two letters to cease and desist 

280
00:15:59,321 --> 00:16:00,154
in my public utterances because they 
believed that not only was I violating 

281
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:03,694
the university standards of conduct,
but then I was also violating the 

282
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,710
relevant provisions of the Ontario Human
Rights Commission.

283
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,750
Therefore,
as far as I could tell,

284
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:14,320
vindicating the statement that I made 
when I made the video to begin with,

285
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:15,154
which was that the act of making the 
video itself was probably already 

286
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:22,300
illegal and they didn't do that lightly 
on the provincial.

287
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,620
Yes.
Senator to put.

288
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,500
Thank you.
Chair and thank you gentlemen.

289
00:16:29,501 --> 00:16:32,080
Both of you for being here.
Um,

290
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,600
two questions.
One for Dr Peterson at the get go.

291
00:16:37,601 --> 00:16:38,434
And then one for the two of you.
Hopefully the chair will indulge me a 

292
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,280
deliberations of this bill.
And during deliberations of this bill,

293
00:16:48,281 --> 00:16:49,114
we keep hearing the term respect,
throwing around respect as indeed 

294
00:16:53,651 --> 00:16:57,580
critical in debates of legislation as 
sensitive as this.

295
00:16:57,581 --> 00:16:58,414
And there are a lot of people here who 
need to be reminded that respect works 

296
00:17:02,351 --> 00:17:04,960
both ways,
including people at this committee.

297
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,790
Uh,
Dr Baker,

298
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:10,810
Senator Baker has already referred to 
comments as genocide.

299
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,840
I don't think anybody here is promoting 
genocide.

300
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,030
However,
Dr. Peterson,

301
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:20,920
can you comment on the notion of respect
where some of your critics say,

302
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,250
why can you not just respect your 
students,

303
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,690
just use the gender neutral pronouns?
How do you respond to that?

304
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:30,121
Well,
first of all,

305
00:17:30,121 --> 00:17:33,150
I'd have to be convinced that doing so 
would do more good than harm.

306
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:37,040
And I don't believe that and I think I'm
actually in a reasonable position to,

307
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,450
to,
to justify my claim.

308
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,313
I think that the danger that's intrinsic
to the law far outweighs whatever 

309
00:17:44,011 --> 00:17:44,844
potential benefit it might produce.
Especially given that there's no hard 

310
00:17:47,551 --> 00:17:48,384
evidence whatsoever for any.
I would also like to point out that the 

311
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:52,854
people who are promoting this 
legislation claim to be acting on the 

312
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:58,410
behalf behalf say of the transgender 
community,

313
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:02,550
but they weren't not elected nor 
appointed to act as such representatives

314
00:18:02,551 --> 00:18:03,820
and they're doing it on their own.
Say.

315
00:18:03,821 --> 00:18:05,220
So.
I've received many letters,

316
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:09,820
at least 30 now from transgendered 
individuals indicating that the,

317
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,733
they are not in accordance with the 
claims of these so called 

318
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:17,640
representatives to be representing or 
with the intent of the legislation,

319
00:18:17,641 --> 00:18:20,460
which has actually made them more 
visible rather than less visible,

320
00:18:20,461 --> 00:18:20,860
which is.

321
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,693
And the less visible is what they had 
preferred with regards to respect is 

322
00:18:25,051 --> 00:18:30,051
that you don't meet people generally 
speaking in a mutual display of respect.

323
00:18:30,931 --> 00:18:35,931
You generally meet people in a mutual 
display of alert neutrality,

324
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:39,870
which is the appropriate way to begin an
interaction with someone because respect

325
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:40,704
is something that you earn as a 
consequence of reciprocal interactions 

326
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:47,550
with wwe that are dependent on something
like reputation,

327
00:18:47,551 --> 00:18:50,310
which is also a consequence of repeated 
interactions.

328
00:18:50,311 --> 00:18:53,790
And so the notion that addressing 
someone by their,

329
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,073
um,
self-defined self identity isn't 

330
00:18:56,611 --> 00:18:59,880
necessarily an indication of basic human
respect for them,

331
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:00,714
I think is entirely spurious argument,
especially given that there's no 

332
00:19:03,331 --> 00:19:04,164
evidence that moving the language in a 
compelling manner in this direction is 

333
00:19:07,621 --> 00:19:08,454
going to have any beneficial effect.
We're supposed to assume that just 

334
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,310
because hypothetically the intent is 
positive,

335
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:15,144
that the outcome will be positive and 
any social scientist worth his or her 

336
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:22,050
salt knows perfectly well that that's 
rarely the case.

337
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,093
So

338
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,760
Dr Brown,
uh,

339
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:27,850
you've talked about a nonmonetary 
orders,

340
00:19:27,851 --> 00:19:30,220
uh,
that could include sanctions like orders

341
00:19:30,221 --> 00:19:32,920
to undertake sensitivity and anti bias 
training.

342
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,133
I would like a,
either one or both of you to comment on 

343
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,183
whether you could explain why an 
individual may have a strong objection 

344
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:45,880
to undertaking such a training.
And Mr Brown,

345
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,550
could you let the committee know how 
serious the sanction could be?

346
00:19:48,551 --> 00:19:50,770
An of course you already dead on that.
Uh,

347
00:19:50,771 --> 00:19:52,780
if you refuse to undertake such an 
order,

348
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,270
uh,
and specifically at the federal level,

349
00:19:55,271 --> 00:19:56,290
but what would,
what would,

350
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:58,770
why would people have an objection to 
taking such training?

351
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,663
I think I'm going to let Dr Peterson 
answer why he or someone like him might 

352
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,880
have an objection to undertaking that 
type of training.

353
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,233
Obviously,
once again with the severity of that 

354
00:20:08,411 --> 00:20:10,120
decision.
If it gets before the tribunal,

355
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,600
well,
I have a profound objection to,

356
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,430
to undergoing such training.
In fact,

357
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,970
I would flatly refuse under all 
conditions to undergo it.

358
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,250
And the reason,
there's multiple reasons for that.

359
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,970
The first reason is that the science 
surrounding the,

360
00:20:24,971 --> 00:20:25,804
uh,
the so called charge of implicit bias 

361
00:20:28,211 --> 00:20:31,470
that's associated with perception is by 
no means settled in,

362
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,613
in to such a degree that to one of the 
three people who designed the most 

363
00:20:36,311 --> 00:20:39,640
commonly used measure,
which is the implicit association test,

364
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:40,563
has detached himself from the other two 
researchers on the grounds that the use 

365
00:20:44,681 --> 00:20:45,514
of the test has become,
has far its scientific validity and 

366
00:20:49,211 --> 00:20:50,044
reliability.
It's nowhere near valid or reliable 

367
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:54,130
enough to be used in the manner that 
it's been using.

368
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,143
And even the more a pro iat researchers 
who developed the test have admitted to 

369
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:00,874
that publicly,
even though they haven't stressed it 

370
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,160
nearly to the degree they showed up.

371
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,910
So first of all,
the sciences is not settled and is being

372
00:21:06,911 --> 00:21:07,744
used absolutely inappropriately and I 
can say that as a clinician because I 

373
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:15,280
know that and as a psychometrician I 
know the criteria for using a test for a

374
00:21:15,281 --> 00:21:16,114
six essentially diagnostic purposes and 
the iat doesn't even come close to 

375
00:21:19,121 --> 00:21:21,610
what's necessary.
Then the next issue is,

376
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:22,803
well,
where's the evidence that an anti 

377
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,383
unconscious bias training works?
There's no evidence and what little 

378
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:31,270
evidence there is suggests that it 
actually has the opposite effect because

379
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,313
people don't like being brought in front
of a reeducation committee and having 

380
00:21:35,681 --> 00:21:38,740
their fundamental perceptions.
You see their perceptions,

381
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:42,040
not even their thoughts,
but their perceptions themselves altered

382
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:45,100
by collective Fiat.
It's an unbelievable honor sir.

383
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,623
We have a very engaged committee,
concise questions and concise responses 

384
00:21:49,631 --> 00:21:50,790
with the helpful,
uh,

385
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,633
senator prep.

386
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:58,830
Thank you for being here.
I want to briefly for the documents from

387
00:21:58,831 --> 00:21:59,664
the Ontario Human Rights Commission says
some people may not know how to 

388
00:22:03,181 --> 00:22:04,014
determine what Pronoun to use.
Others may feel uncomfortable using 

389
00:22:06,961 --> 00:22:08,670
gender neutral pronouns.
Generally.

390
00:22:08,671 --> 00:22:09,504
When in doubt,
ask a person how they wish to be 

391
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:13,590
addressed Tuesday.
If you don't know which Pronoun to use,

392
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:14,443
his preferred,
simply referring to their person by 

393
00:22:16,381 --> 00:22:19,590
their chosen name is always a respectful
approach.

394
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,740
So you can use the pronoun,
you can choose,

395
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:27,770
you can use their chosen name.
So if someone chooses to change his name

396
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,453
from Paul to Peter,
surely you'd use Peter because it's a 

397
00:22:32,491 --> 00:22:33,324
matter of simple politeness and respect.
If that same person is the person 

398
00:22:37,051 --> 00:22:40,320
chooses to cheat,
to change our name from Paul to Paula,

399
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,270
won't.
I won't use you.

400
00:22:42,271 --> 00:22:45,300
Use the name Polo simply as a matter of 
respect.

401
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,580
What's the difference here?

402
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,653
Well,
I guess the issue with that and the 

403
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,123
speaker about the legal issue there is 
that you're now introducing the full 

404
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:54,570
force of the law behind the requirement 
to use.

405
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:55,763
And I'm dealing obviously with,
with respect to the pronoun issue in 

406
00:22:58,051 --> 00:22:59,820
terms of not addressing somebody by 
their,

407
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,460
by their legally registered name,
for instance.

408
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,200
Um,
uh,

409
00:23:04,201 --> 00:23:06,750
I don't think that's where we're running
into trouble here.

410
00:23:06,751 --> 00:23:10,650
I think the issue becomes that if you 
don't address somebody by the,

411
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,543
uh,
the pronoun that they self identify by 

412
00:23:13,171 --> 00:23:18,120
as I've read out to you the fact that 
the full force of the law will be behind

413
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,030
a that person.
I'm that that's what I,

414
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:24,210
I'm a finding as trump,
troubling in the legislation,

415
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,253
but the Ontario Human Rights Commission 
gives people the alternative not to use 

416
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:33,360
pronouns and use the person's chosen 
name it,

417
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,253
which is always a respectful approach.
So pronouns are not necessary or not 

418
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:38,700
mandatory.

419
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:43,080
You can always choose the person's 
chosen name as a respectful approach.

420
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:47,270
And therefore,
I'm not aware that anybody,

421
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,770
that there is a,
um,

422
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,760
a piece of legislation that compels you 
to use my proper name.

423
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,670
In other words,
once again,

424
00:23:55,671 --> 00:23:59,930
it's the fact that the full force of the
law will be behind it when we're dealing

425
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,750
with the group being identified in the 
legislation.

426
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,980
And so,
for instance,

427
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,110
I were not to call you by your chosen 
name.

428
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:09,620
I'm not sure you'd enjoy the full force 
of law behind you.

429
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,740
Uh,
um,

430
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,250
as a result of that.
And that's what I'm suggesting to you is

431
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,490
the difference here.
I'm just sorry.

432
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,383
When you said that you always base 
whatever you say on what the Ontario 

433
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,873
Human Rights Commission is saying,
and I'm quoting from the Ontario Human 

434
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,233
Rights Commission document.
They're saying we're not mandated 

435
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,593
mandating pronouns.
You can always use the person's chosen 

436
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:32,690
name as a respectful approach.
I respectfully disagree,

437
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,560
but then,
well I would say then that's actually an

438
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:39,790
indication of just exactly how important
the policy documents are written because

439
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,540
I can quote this one which which is also
from the Ontario Human Rights Commission

440
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:45,460
website that says,
and I quote,

441
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,503
refusing,
refusing to refer to a person by their 

442
00:24:47,981 --> 00:24:51,010
self identified name and proper 
personal,

443
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,713
proper personal pronouns.
Counts constitutes gender based 

444
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:56,920
harassment.
And so if there.

445
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:57,933
If the policies are written in a 
coherent manner and there wasn't 

446
00:24:59,891 --> 00:25:00,724
internal contradictions,
then your statement would be a 

447
00:25:02,351 --> 00:25:04,930
reasonable objection.
But since it's not written that way,

448
00:25:04,931 --> 00:25:07,830
and I do believe firmly that that's a 
testament to the.

449
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:11,500
To the degree to which it's supporting 
written set of policies,

450
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,870
is it?
It's full of internal contradictions and

451
00:25:13,871 --> 00:25:14,704
that'll be worked out very painfully 
within the confines of people's private 

452
00:25:17,471 --> 00:25:18,304
lives.

453
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,660
Thank you sir.
Good.

454
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:21,830
Well,
senator batters.

455
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,070
Thanks very much.
Both of you for being here.

456
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,320
First of all,
Dr Peterson.

457
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,573
I want to go back to this issue of 
personal pronouns and if you could 

458
00:25:30,651 --> 00:25:32,750
please tell our committee more about 
this issue.

459
00:25:32,751 --> 00:25:35,990
It's something that I was not at all 
familiar with prior to this bill

460
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,133
being introduced and in particular about
the gender neutral pronouns and your 

461
00:25:42,801 --> 00:25:43,634
experience in pushing back against being
forced to use those general neutral 

462
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,530
gender neutral pronouns.

463
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:49,843
Well,
I don't think the people who initiated 

464
00:25:51,501 --> 00:25:52,334
this legislation ever expected that 
there would be an absolute explosion of 

465
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,950
of identities,
first of all,

466
00:25:57,951 --> 00:26:01,370
and also so-called personal pronouns as 
there has been.

467
00:26:01,371 --> 00:26:02,204
I think facebook now recognize as 
something like 71 separate gender 

468
00:26:05,361 --> 00:26:08,720
identity categories,
each of which in principle is associated

469
00:26:08,721 --> 00:26:13,070
with its own set of pronouns and so it's
become what linguistically and it's.

470
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,143
It's become a parody essentially.
It's become linguistically unmanageable 

471
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,500
and it's also the case that words can't 
be introduced into the language by Fiat.

472
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,840
I don't.
I can't even think of a time when that's

473
00:26:23,841 --> 00:26:24,674
actually work.
We're not exactly sure how words enter 

474
00:26:26,221 --> 00:26:28,550
the common parlance,
but it's certainly not that way.

475
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,190
And so the,
the,

476
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,810
the legislation devolves into a kind of,
of,

477
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,380
of the absurdity as far as I can tell.
I mean,

478
00:26:36,381 --> 00:26:37,214
one of the people that I discussed this 
with claim that the way that you kept 

479
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:40,664
track of someone's personal pronouns was
to use your cell phone as an adjunct to 

480
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:46,830
your communication.
And I mean that's,

481
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,880
you wouldn't say anything like that if 
you knew anything about

482
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,273
common human nature,
let's say in the matter in which people 

483
00:26:55,261 --> 00:26:57,140
communicate with one another.
So

484
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,860
the types of pronouns are talking about 
just so everyone's clear,

485
00:26:59,861 --> 00:27:02,170
because I don't think these are common 
common parlance,

486
00:27:02,171 --> 00:27:03,004
um,
ze Zer and what other sorts of gender 

487
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:07,240
neutral pronouns are we discussing?

488
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,393
Well,
I have very bad memory for that sort of 

489
00:27:10,021 --> 00:27:11,730
thing,
but if you're interested in that,

490
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:16,170
you can find lists of them very rapidly 
on the web and they'd been produced by,

491
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,243
I think they'd been produced by people 
whose essential desire is to gain 

492
00:27:22,111 --> 00:27:25,160
linguistic control.
That's,

493
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,103
that's,
that's as simple as I can put it is to 

494
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:31,550
gain linguistic control,
but they're not used popularly and,

495
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:32,403
and that seems to me to be a real 
problem as a consequence that you make 

496
00:27:36,361 --> 00:27:40,470
failure to make their use something that
could carry a criminal penalty.

497
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,753
So I just don't understand that and,
and I don't understand how the 

498
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:45,294
government can justify imposing a 
criminal penalty on the use of words 

499
00:27:48,511 --> 00:27:53,250
that no one either knows or uses it.
It just seems preposterous to me.

500
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,050
But there it is.

501
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,850
Could you please also tell us a little 
bit more about the,

502
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:00,660
your personal experience in pushing back
against this?

503
00:28:00,661 --> 00:28:03,880
And I mean many are familiar with your 
story but not everyone.

504
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,010
So I just want to give you a little.

505
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,330
Well,
I made a video,

506
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:09,630
actually made three videos,
but we'll just talk about one of them.

507
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:10,464
I thought I made one criticizing bill c 
16 for the reasons that I already 

508
00:28:13,891 --> 00:28:17,500
described because I went and read the 
policies and I made my hair stand on end

509
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,730
to the surrounding policies.
And,

510
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:20,564
uh,
so I made a video stating essentially 

511
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:26,070
that and detailed out my reasons and um,
you know,

512
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:29,130
I've been following the battle of let's 
say,

513
00:28:29,131 --> 00:28:33,090
ideologies on campus for a very long 
period of time and I suppose I have some

514
00:28:33,091 --> 00:28:33,924
expertise in that and there's a,
there's an ideological war that's 

515
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:40,730
ripping a campuses apart and it's 
essentially between a,

516
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:45,690
an ideological variant that's rooted in 
what's come to be known as postmodernism

517
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:50,691
with kind of the Neo Marxist base and,
and modern modernism.

518
00:28:51,751 --> 00:28:55,230
I would say that that's accounting for 
all the turmoil on campuses.

519
00:28:55,231 --> 00:28:58,950
And I see this as an extension of this 
campus turmoil into the broader world.

520
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:59,783
And,
and I really believe that is the proper 

521
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:02,970
level of analysis.
I truly believe that.

522
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,140
And so I said that I believe that this 
is the V,

523
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,023
a vanguard issue in a kind of 
ideological war and that I'm not going 

524
00:29:11,221 --> 00:29:13,500
to participate on the side of the people
whose,

525
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:16,740
whose ideological stance I find 
reprehensible,

526
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,460
unforgivable and reprehensible,
especially the Marxist element of it.

527
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:21,863
And so I announced that I was going to 
use these words because I don't believe 

528
00:29:24,571 --> 00:29:26,940
that they're instantiating to protect 
anyone's rights.

529
00:29:26,941 --> 00:29:28,560
I believe they're,
that the,

530
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,693
the,
the ideologues who are pushing this 

531
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:31,644
movement are using unsuspecting and 
sometimes complicit members of the so 

532
00:29:35,131 --> 00:29:39,570
called transgender community to push 
their ideological vanguard forward.

533
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:43,120
And I firmly believe that so I'm not 
participating in that.

534
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,373
And the fact that it's potentially 
illegal for me not to participate in 

535
00:29:47,231 --> 00:29:51,130
that is something that I regard as.
I think that's absolutely dreadful.

536
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,033
It's,
it makes,

537
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:52,893
it puts a shutter in my heart as a 
Canadian that we could even possibly be 

538
00:29:55,691 --> 00:29:57,940
in a situation like that.
You know,

539
00:29:57,941 --> 00:29:58,774
if,
if the,

540
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,050
if the identity claims that are 
instantiated in this lead,

541
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,630
in the policies surrounding this 
legislation are applied,

542
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,610
it's going to be held for the 
psychiatrist,

543
00:30:06,611 --> 00:30:07,444
excuse my language.
It's going to be very difficult for the 

544
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,413
biologists and the psychiatrists next.
And I think we'll see that happening 

545
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:15,400
very soon.
Thank you,

546
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,580
Senator Gold.

547
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,540
Thank you.
And thank you for being here.

548
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,290
Um,
uh,

549
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,060
I,
I'm never been a practicing lawyer.

550
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,230
I was a constitutional law professor and
I'm a free speech guy.

551
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:30,943
Um,
so I appreciate the importance of the 

552
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:35,554
issues that are being raised.
I think respectfully they were answered 

553
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:42,430
free speech issues were answered quite 
compellingly by my former colleague,

554
00:30:42,431 --> 00:30:45,610
Brenda Cosmin and testimony before this 
committee.

555
00:30:45,611 --> 00:30:47,950
But I,
I wanted to make three points,

556
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,190
um,
uh,

557
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:53,240
Mr Peterson and there are questions sort
of varied in this point.

558
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:55,743
I think I heard you say that you thought
that the harm to this legislation 

559
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,610
outweighs the good but,
but,

560
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:01,863
but there is the trans community suffers
harm regularly when they're 

561
00:31:04,871 --> 00:31:05,704
discriminated against and whatever else.
One might say and worry about human 

562
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:12,454
rights tribunals and the like.
This bill addresses and would take a 

563
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:20,560
major step forward towards reducing 
harm,

564
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,623
uh,
that are particularly vulnerable 

565
00:31:22,391 --> 00:31:25,090
community experiences.

566
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,913
Second,
let's see if we could zero in on where 

567
00:31:28,391 --> 00:31:29,224
we might agree that
there is nothing in the law that 

568
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,093
criminalizes or creates a,
an offense to criticize the notion that 

569
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,393
identity as a social construct,
which you do to criticize the way in 

570
00:31:45,491 --> 00:31:46,324
which words come into the language.
The Modern Hebrews and example of where 

571
00:31:49,571 --> 00:31:51,850
it's coming in by fee and the academy 
says,

572
00:31:51,851 --> 00:31:55,300
does it as well for Shakespeare gave us 
so much of our language,

573
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,493
but there's nothing in this bill that 
stands in the way of you taking a 

574
00:32:00,041 --> 00:32:04,720
principal position against all aspects 
of this including your criticisms of the

575
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:07,810
activist.
And the issue is the Pronoun.

576
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,120
And,
and unless I'm reading it wrong,

577
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:11,823
uh,
Senator Pratte pointed out the Ontario 

578
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:20,700
Human Rights Commission policy does not 
say that refusing to use a person's self

579
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:26,970
identified name or personal pronoun does
Constitute Gender based harassment.

580
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,890
I May,
I may be wrong,

581
00:32:29,891 --> 00:32:33,190
but I believe it said it could and I 
think that's a real difference.

582
00:32:33,191 --> 00:32:35,020
If,
if I turn to you and say,

583
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,183
look,
please call me they because how I see 

584
00:32:40,371 --> 00:32:41,204
myself now,
because it's hurtful for you to call me 

585
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:47,040
sir,
or miss whatever,

586
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:50,960
whatever it would be a.
But you refuse.

587
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:51,720
And I say,
well,

588
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,553
Kate,
if you're uncomfortable with that 

589
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:55,910
because you're not comfortable with 
that,

590
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:00,970
call me mark,
and you refuse to continue to call me by

591
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:03,560
the name that I'm telling you is perfect
to me.

592
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,620
Is that not in fact,
something that,

593
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,950
is that not something that the law can 
properly address?

594
00:33:17,951 --> 00:33:22,880
This is you were knowingly hurting me.
Uh,

595
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,790
and,
and in that respect,

596
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:30,790
our courts ultimately,
I think are capable of striking a proper

597
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:33,340
balance between people who slip up or 
who,

598
00:33:33,341 --> 00:33:34,174
for whatever reasons,
just can't get the words out of their 

599
00:33:36,131 --> 00:33:41,050
mouth and those that persist and 
intentionally causing it to respond.

600
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:44,080
Would you agree with my characterization
of the,

601
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,323
uh,
free speech as it applies to these 

602
00:33:46,751 --> 00:33:47,561
issues?
Let me jump in.

603
00:33:47,561 --> 00:33:48,394
Just on the legal point,
after Dr Peterson posted these videos 

604
00:33:52,271 --> 00:33:53,104
and after he ruins to the consciousness,
the Ontario human rights commission 

605
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,233
deemed fit to release a new policy 
document called questions and answers 

606
00:34:01,811 --> 00:34:04,360
about gender identity and pronouns.
And in so doing,

607
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:08,400
they said that refusing to refer to a 
trans person by their chosen name and pr

608
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,303
and a personal pronoun that matches 
their gender identity or purposely 

609
00:34:12,371 --> 00:34:15,010
misgendering will likely be 
discrimination.

610
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:15,843
So I think it's a little bit more 
certain than what you may have a 

611
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:21,200
indicated in your comments,
but I'll love Dr. um,

612
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,920
a and once again that was,
that policy was,

613
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:28,950
was put out after Dr Peterson began to 
speak on the issue and so I think that's

614
00:34:30,431 --> 00:34:33,160
very telling that it was a,
a response if you will,

615
00:34:33,161 --> 00:34:34,000
to this,
this,

616
00:34:34,001 --> 00:34:36,220
um,
this issue that Dr Peterson raised.

617
00:34:36,221 --> 00:34:37,054
I going to know obviously Dr Pearson to 
go ahead with the other element of your 

618
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:41,480
question very briefly sir.
Well,

619
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:42,323
so I would say that the very idea that 
calling someone a term that they didn't 

620
00:34:48,101 --> 00:34:53,101
choose causes them such irreparable harm
that legal remedies should be sought.

621
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:54,893
Um,
rather than regarding it as a form of 

622
00:34:56,321 --> 00:34:59,350
impoliteness that legal remedies should,
should be sought,

623
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,213
including potential violation of the 
hate speech codes is an indication of 

624
00:35:03,761 --> 00:35:08,170
just how deeply the culture of 
victimization is sunk into our society.

625
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,690
Okay.
We'll leave it.

626
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:11,830
There are a senator from

627
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,633
same topic with Mr Brown at when the 
Minister of Justice was before this 

628
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:24,020
committee.
She said the following,

629
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,393
there is nothing within bill [inaudible]
that would compel somebody to have to 

630
00:35:29,571 --> 00:35:30,404
call somebody by the pronouns he or she 
or otherwise can you comment on 

631
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,000
preposition?
But I'd

632
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,470
agree with that.
There is nothing in the bill,

633
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,390
but the problem is that in the,
uh,

634
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:45,570
the government of Canada,
Department of Justice website,

635
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,050
um,
they,

636
00:35:47,051 --> 00:35:49,260
uh,
in their questions and answer section of

637
00:35:49,261 --> 00:35:51,420
their website which was pulled down in 
December,

638
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:55,440
it's that top five of my brief.
It makes very clear that the definitions

639
00:35:55,441 --> 00:35:56,274
of the terms gender identity and gender 
expression have already been given by 

640
00:35:58,531 --> 00:35:59,364
the Ontario Human Rights Commission.
The commission has provided helpful 

641
00:36:02,221 --> 00:36:05,070
discussion and examples that can offer 
good practical guidance.

642
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,933
The Canadian Human Rights Commission 
will provide similar guidance on the 

643
00:36:08,581 --> 00:36:10,740
meaning of these terms in the Canadian 
Human Rights Act.

644
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:14,580
Now I take that to the legislative 
intent and I'll agree with you that the,

645
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:15,443
that the bill itself on its face does 
not seem to imply any manner of 

646
00:36:17,431 --> 00:36:18,264
compelled speech.
But when we're tying it so deliberately 

647
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,950
and with this expectation,
that's where I think you get into a,

648
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:23,873
into some trouble.

649
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,793
Mr Barney,
he spoke about the chilling effects of 

650
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:31,043
overly broad accusation.
I'm wondering if you consider the terms 

651
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:37,480
gender identity and gender expression to
be equally,

652
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:42,340
or do you consider one broader than the,
um,

653
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,940
I think they are overly broad 
definitions and,

654
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:48,863
uh,
and I think the only thing I can offer 

655
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,380
as a lawyer and a litigator is that,
um,

656
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,360
the courts don't like overbroad terms 
and I,

657
00:36:56,361 --> 00:37:01,290
and I would refer you to the decision of
a London boy Berto Court of Appeal,

658
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,513
where in that case the court of appeals 
is the objective of statutory 

659
00:37:05,101 --> 00:37:06,200
interpretation is,
does,

660
00:37:06,201 --> 00:37:07,034
is to discern the legislative intent 
from the language of the legislation if 

661
00:37:09,991 --> 00:37:12,660
possible.
And to give effect to such intent.

662
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:15,330
This objective becomes difficult to 
attain.

663
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,373
Where there is conflict in precision or 
a lack of clarity in the legislation of 

664
00:37:20,011 --> 00:37:20,844
particularly of particular concern in 
the area of human rights law is that a 

665
00:37:23,851 --> 00:37:26,830
lack of clarity will cast a chill on the
exercise on the,

666
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:30,240
of the fundamental freedoms such as 
freedom of expression and religion.

667
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,500
And so,
um,

668
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:32,603
while I personally believe that the,
that the terms are not properly or not 

669
00:37:35,281 --> 00:37:37,920
clearly defined and,
and somewhat ambiguous,

670
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:41,430
the courts don't like that type of 
legislation either,

671
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,750
just to add two things.
Um,

672
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:48,290
with regards to the chill,
it's already the case and I've seen this

673
00:37:48,291 --> 00:37:50,720
among my own students when they're 
teaching personality,

674
00:37:50,721 --> 00:37:51,554
which is what I teach,
which also involves a assessment of 

675
00:37:53,961 --> 00:37:54,794
gender differences between men and women
that the proclivity now is for the 

676
00:37:58,611 --> 00:37:59,444
advanced phd students to avoid any such 
discussions in their classrooms because 

677
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:05,540
of the potential cost of transgressing 
against,

678
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:07,370
uh,
an unknown norm,

679
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:10,370
let's say is so high that it's just 
easier to teach other things.

680
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,460
And so I've seen that clearly and with 
multiple people.

681
00:38:13,461 --> 00:38:14,294
And I would also say that it's no 
trivial matter that the department of 

682
00:38:18,471 --> 00:38:19,304
Justice's link to the Ontario Human 
Rights Commission and their statements 

683
00:38:22,431 --> 00:38:23,264
about how this legislation was going to 
be interpreted mysteriously disappeared 

684
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:27,014
in the middle of December.
Of all the things that have happened to 

685
00:38:28,521 --> 00:38:32,510
me happened in relationship to this ad 
that I'd been studying.

686
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:35,680
I think that was the most chilling.
So because it was the,

687
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:36,543
it was the,
what would you say it was the smoking 

688
00:38:37,991 --> 00:38:38,800
pistol,
right?

689
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,410
Because the issue is what's the right 
level of analysis?

690
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,300
He just supposed to look at the 
legislation.

691
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,000
Well,
since the Justice Department said no,

692
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,340
you're supposed to look at the 
surrounding policies.

693
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:50,860
Well that's what I did and that's what I
based my case on.

694
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:52,660
And then all of a sudden the link to 
those,

695
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:53,863
the link tying those two things together
just vanished and people had to go into 

696
00:38:56,741 --> 00:38:58,870
the Internet archives to,
to,

697
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:02,560
to fish it back out so that it could 
remain part of the public record.

698
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,800
I think that's absolutely scandalous.
Thank you.

699
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,240
Senator.
I'm adver.

700
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:11,913
Thank you chair.
And thank you both of you for being 

701
00:39:13,071 --> 00:39:14,270
here.
Um,

702
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,650
I was trying to take notes,
but I think I got this right of Peterson

703
00:39:18,651 --> 00:39:23,651
that you talked about this bill as being
an expression of vanguard of ideology.

704
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,590
Am My,
am I right in thinking in,

705
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:27,850
in?

706
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:28,683
Well,
I was thinking more about the policies 

707
00:39:29,741 --> 00:39:31,750
that surrounded it but,
but yes.

708
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,410
Yeah.
So I'm trying to.

709
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,680
Where would you as a party of one are 
saying that published documents from the

710
00:39:40,471 --> 00:39:44,640
Canadian psychological association,
the American Psychological Association,

711
00:39:44,641 --> 00:39:49,350
the Canadian Medical Association,
the American Psychiatric Association,

712
00:39:49,351 --> 00:39:50,184
the Canadian Psychiatry Association,
and the United Nation human rights 

713
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:57,090
experts.
So these are all,

714
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,040
you know,
these are no parties at one associated.

715
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:02,760
They are all,
I imagine,

716
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:03,623
lots of psychologists and members of the
Canadian Psychology Association and the 

717
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:09,083
Canadian Psychiatry.
So how would you describe what you're 

718
00:40:10,981 --> 00:40:14,190
saying,
which is your opinion,

719
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,700
which you are absolutely entitled to 
with what everyone is saying,

720
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
plus the feelings and testimonies of the
people who have suffered over 30 years.

721
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:29,250
We've been taking issues to court.
These are people who will.

722
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,470
We listened to.
So how would we describe that?

723
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,220
Okay.
Well,

724
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,053
with regards to your second point,
if the people that you're listening to 

725
00:40:35,821 --> 00:40:36,654
are randomly selected from a population,
then their opinions are worthless from 

726
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:41,064
the perspective of,
of testimony because you don't know if 

727
00:40:42,781 --> 00:40:45,900
you're dealing with a biased sample.
And that's a big problem with the public

728
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:46,734
consultation process that underlies this
bill and you can not appreciate that if 

729
00:40:50,941 --> 00:40:53,370
you'd like,
but it's standard practice in any,

730
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:57,960
in any polling institution or any body 
that's attempting to extract the genuine

731
00:40:57,961 --> 00:41:00,540
opinion out of a so called community of 
people.

732
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:01,523
And if that isn't followed then you 
can't tell if the information that 

733
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:04,643
you're receiving is bias.
And this with regards to your first 

734
00:41:07,351 --> 00:41:08,184
point,
what exactly are all those people who 

735
00:41:09,661 --> 00:41:10,494
aren't thinking the same way as me sake.
You said that there's a bunch of them 

736
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,063
and a bunch of groups,
but you never said what they're saying 

737
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,423
precisely.

738
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,413
Well,
I think our chair who drew me out to 45 

739
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:24,830
percent of your fund to vet out what 
they're all saying,

740
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:29,630
but in general they say they oppose 
discrimination and harassment because of

741
00:41:29,631 --> 00:41:33,410
gender identity and gender expression 
and then there's three pages.

742
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,473
I can show it.

743
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,550
I oppose discrimination against gender 
identity and gender expression.

744
00:41:38,551 --> 00:41:39,384
That's not the point.
The point is the specifics of the 

745
00:41:41,491 --> 00:41:45,650
legislation that's around it and the 
insistence that people will have to be a

746
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:48,780
half to use compelled speech.
That's what I'm objecting to.

747
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:51,150
I've dealt with all sorts of people in 
my life,

748
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:54,600
very people who don't fit in and now all
sorts of different ways.

749
00:41:54,601 --> 00:41:55,434
I'm not a discriminatory person.
There's 500 hours of my teaching to my 

750
00:41:59,431 --> 00:42:01,290
classrooms on tape,
on Youtube,

751
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:04,920
but nobody's found a smoking pistol.
I'm not a discriminatory individually,

752
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,670
but I think this legislation is 
reprehensible and I do not believe for a

753
00:42:08,671 --> 00:42:10,890
moment that it will do what it intends 
to do.

754
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:11,873
I also don't think that my opinion 
deviates substantially from the bodies 

755
00:42:14,971 --> 00:42:15,804
that you're describing because you 
haven't provided any evidence that they 

756
00:42:17,881 --> 00:42:18,714
say anything other than discrimination 
is a bad thing and I think that 

757
00:42:21,211 --> 00:42:24,750
unreasonable discrimination is a bad 
thing and it's unreasonable.

758
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:25,584
When people are judged for any reason 
other than the specific competence that 

759
00:42:29,191 --> 00:42:30,024
they bring to say a given physician.
It's not in anyone's best interest that 

760
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:33,863
that occurs,
but I don't think that you've 

761
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,413
demonstrated in the least that the 
opinions that I'm putting forward are 

762
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:40,163
exist in opposition to the standard 
practices of a say of my particular 

763
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:44,094
discipline.

764
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:49,630
So could you.
Could you repeat one more time?

765
00:42:49,851 --> 00:42:52,290
Your response to Senate says Golden 
Pratt,

766
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:57,080
that the Ontario human rights commission
has provided what I would say reasonable

767
00:42:57,081 --> 00:43:02,081
alternatives to your.
Your objection to using pronouns?

768
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,110
Well,
I think it's been made clear in the,

769
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:07,023
in the presentation so far is that it 
depends on which part of the Ontario 

770
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,660
Human Rights Commission's policies you 
read.

771
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:12,853
And that's a big problem.
I mean that's one of the reasons I 

772
00:43:15,231 --> 00:43:16,064
criticized this to begin with was 
because when I went through the 

773
00:43:18,531 --> 00:43:19,364
policies,
I could see that you're absolutely 

774
00:43:21,081 --> 00:43:23,120
incoherent.
So for example,

775
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,560
here,
let me give you another example.

776
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:25,394
So there's an insistence in the Ontario 
Human Rights Commission that sexual 

777
00:43:28,191 --> 00:43:29,024
preferences and immutable phenomena,
which indicates at least in principle 

778
00:43:32,811 --> 00:43:35,300
that it's biologically grounded,
but on the same,

779
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,790
by the same token,
in exactly the same policies,

780
00:43:37,791 --> 00:43:38,624
they presume that sexual identity,
gender identity and gender expression 

781
00:43:41,511 --> 00:43:43,310
are entirely independent.
It's like,

782
00:43:43,311 --> 00:43:44,144
sorry guys,
you can't have both of those because 

783
00:43:46,611 --> 00:43:51,010
one's a and one's not a and you can't 
put those together and like there's.

784
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:51,933
There's endless numbers of places in the
policy surround surrounding bill c 16 

785
00:43:57,561 --> 00:43:58,394
that are characterized by that kind of 
logical incoherency I mean what you're 

786
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:02,173
going to do to people who are 
transgender who are making the claim 

787
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,070
that they were saved born that way at 
birth,

788
00:44:07,071 --> 00:44:10,010
which is a strong claim.
That's a biological claim.

789
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:11,023
It indicates that there's a direct 
causal connection between some 

790
00:44:13,701 --> 00:44:17,150
biological phenomena and the expression 
of a particular identity.

791
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:19,760
It's actually the strongest defense that
people who have,

792
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:23,420
let's call them nonstandard sexual 
identities or gender identities,

793
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:24,403
have to defend the claim.
So I have to wrap it up there and move 

794
00:44:26,631 --> 00:44:31,631
on to a senator well avenue Mr at.
Thank you

795
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:32,940
very much.
Mr Chair,

796
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:38,820
I'll leave the time for our guests to 
put in their translation devices.

797
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:44,180
Thank you very much for being here.
My question is for Mr Peterson,

798
00:44:44,971 --> 00:44:46,590
do you have the interpretation now,
sir,

799
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:51,303
so

800
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:55,340
I'm still trying to orient myself a 
little bit in this bill.

801
00:44:55,341 --> 00:44:59,750
I'm a little bit lost in the arguments 
for and against,

802
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:00,763
but some arguments really struck me 
because some people said that without 

803
00:45:04,431 --> 00:45:09,310
this bill
there might be suicides.

804
00:45:09,311 --> 00:45:11,140
People would become depressed.

805
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,913
Okay.

806
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,200
Transgender people of course,

807
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:21,750
and

808
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:22,803
it seems to me that this is almost an 
extreme position that without this bill 

809
00:45:26,831 --> 00:45:28,900
there would be an explosion of suicides 
and depression.

810
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:32,520
So I'd like to ask you a question.
As a professor now you work in the,

811
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:34,120
the,
the social sciences,

812
00:45:34,121 --> 00:45:39,121
you study human behavior.
Are there studies or statistics

813
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:47,350
about the consequences that this bill 
would have on those people?

814
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,233
Is this bill,
would this bill save as many lives and 

815
00:45:52,611 --> 00:45:54,110
help as many people as it says?

816
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:56,580
Well,
in,

817
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,413
in principle,
we would have that information if the 

818
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:03,000
policies that have already been 
introduced by the provincial governments

819
00:46:03,001 --> 00:46:05,580
were assessed properly,
but as far as I know,

820
00:46:05,581 --> 00:46:06,414
there's been no known studies indicating
that the introduction of this 

821
00:46:09,451 --> 00:46:12,350
legislation specifically has done 
anything to modify the,

822
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:15,840
the unfortunate rates of suicide,
depression,

823
00:46:15,841 --> 00:46:18,740
anxiety and so forth that are bitter 
characteristic.

824
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:19,703
Well,
you could say often of marginalized 

825
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,370
groups,
but that's a bit of an overstatement.

826
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,280
So no,
I don't that,

827
00:46:25,281 --> 00:46:26,114
that,
that was part of my original claim is 

828
00:46:27,121 --> 00:46:29,250
that there's no evidence that this sort 
of,

829
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,140
um,
legal redress,

830
00:46:31,141 --> 00:46:34,440
let's say is going to produce any of the
positive consequences that are intended.

831
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,920
And I do believe that by making the 
issue,

832
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:41,040
let's say painfully visible,
that's one way of thinking about it.

833
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:44,220
There's actually had the opposite effect
and it's,

834
00:46:44,221 --> 00:46:44,670
you know,
it's,

835
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:45,540
it's,
it's very,

836
00:46:45,541 --> 00:46:47,460
very common and this is something 
that's,

837
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,473
that's well known in,
in the relevant social sciences that 

838
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,073
just because you intend something to 
happen when you make a large scale 

839
00:46:54,601 --> 00:46:55,434
transformation doesn't indicate in any 
manner that that's going to be the 

840
00:46:58,741 --> 00:46:59,574
outcome.

841
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:00,583
I mean,
it would be lovely if things were that 

842
00:47:01,441 --> 00:47:02,274
simple and I mean the best social 
scientists always insist that you build 

843
00:47:06,931 --> 00:47:10,530
an outcome analysis into any,
into any broad scale,

844
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:11,453
what would you call a social 
intervention because there's a good 

845
00:47:14,911 --> 00:47:17,850
chance it'll backfire,
there's a high chance it'll backfire,

846
00:47:17,851 --> 00:47:18,684
so it's all presupposition and it's 
based at least in part on the notion 

847
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:26,880
that the transgender community is a 
community and that there are voices that

848
00:47:26,881 --> 00:47:30,640
speak for them homogenously and that 
this is what they all want and that will

849
00:47:30,641 --> 00:47:34,860
work as intended.
And to me looking at this from,

850
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:37,020
from the social science perspective,
it's,

851
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:39,013
it's,
there's nothing about it that's 

852
00:47:39,881 --> 00:47:43,060
credible.
Missy and I also don't buy the intent,

853
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:44,760
so good.

854
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,910
Senator Dupuis.
See Ms Dot.

855
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:49,603
Thank you,
Mr Chairman.

856
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:53,750
Okay.

857
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:54,803
First of all,
I'd like to ask a question to Mr 

858
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,880
Peterson and perhaps I would also have a
question for Mr Brown.

859
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:08,380
My question is as follows,
Dr Peterson.

860
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,050
I'm trying to understand your position.

861
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:12,633
Okay.

862
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:14,583
Do you see a difference
between the opinions that you expressed 

863
00:48:20,561 --> 00:48:23,710
that you were expressing today on this 
issue

864
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,060
as part of this public consultation?

865
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:31,380
Okay,

866
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,453
and the actions that you take as a 
university professor where you are in a 

867
00:48:39,601 --> 00:48:42,930
position of authority and power over 
your students?

868
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:48,681
Well,
first of all,

869
00:48:48,681 --> 00:48:52,430
I don't necessarily consider myself in a
position of authority and power.

870
00:48:52,431 --> 00:48:55,100
I consider myself in a position of 
responsibility.

871
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:56,443
Those aren't the same thing,
so I don't agree with the way that the 

872
00:48:59,120 --> 00:48:59,953
question is formulated and I don't 
understand what that has to do with my 

873
00:49:02,961 --> 00:49:05,660
stance.
I mean if I believe that the legislation

874
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:10,100
is going to do more harm than good and I
also firmly believe which I do,

875
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:14,510
that it is more in the issue of 
ideological move than,

876
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:15,373
than,
than something that's designed to 

877
00:49:16,431 --> 00:49:18,770
address the concerns that it purports to
address.

878
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,650
I would also like to point out briefly 
that you know,

879
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:22,813
what should have happened when I made 
that video and this is relevant to the 

880
00:49:24,801 --> 00:49:25,634
question,
was that like maybe people paid 

881
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:28,664
attention to 10 minutes to do to it for 
10 minutes and maybe he'd got a 

882
00:49:31,071 --> 00:49:32,750
newspaper article and then it 
disappeared.

883
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,810
But I put my finger on something.
That's what I thought.

884
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,900
And the fact that this issue hasn't gone
away in nine months,

885
00:49:38,901 --> 00:49:39,734
quite the contrary,
it's exploded not only in Canada but in 

886
00:49:42,171 --> 00:49:43,004
all sorts of parts of the world means 
that I means to me that I have some 

887
00:49:46,281 --> 00:49:47,114
evidence that my choice of level of 
analysis was correct and that there's 

888
00:49:50,031 --> 00:49:52,250
far more going on here,
so to speak.

889
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,113
Then the mirror surface issue that we're
purporting to discuss and so I take 

890
00:49:57,591 --> 00:50:01,700
exception to the notion that I'm somehow
abandoning my personal responsibility to

891
00:50:01,701 --> 00:50:02,534
my students,
which is something that I believe is in 

892
00:50:04,041 --> 00:50:04,874
fact driving what I'm doing.
I believe that my obligation to my 

893
00:50:07,311 --> 00:50:08,144
students constantly used to tell them 
what I think and to make that as 

894
00:50:11,361 --> 00:50:15,230
informed and careful and opinion as I 
can possibly matter.

895
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:17,150
Map Master.
And that's what I do.

896
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,120
Zip asked him component.
You can see.

897
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,103
I think that you understand that if you 
come to participate or to appear a 

898
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:28,724
Senate committee studying a bill,
regardless of what we think of the 

899
00:50:31,881 --> 00:50:36,800
question
that.

900
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:39,410
I mean,
my question for you is,

901
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,130
do you make a difference between your 
opinion,

902
00:50:43,131 --> 00:50:48,131
what you say and the fact that the 
university which pays you,

903
00:50:48,441 --> 00:50:53,441
I believe unless I'm wrong,
the university considers you to be under

904
00:50:55,311 --> 00:50:56,144
its legal responsibility and so you are 
in a situation of authority over your 

905
00:51:04,521 --> 00:51:08,780
students and this means that you can 
give an,

906
00:51:08,781 --> 00:51:10,370
a or an f to your students

907
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:14,480
components of the legislation.
That's rolling.

908
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:16,690
I'm going to move on.
Senator Mcdonald,

909
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:21,950
you can care
for you.

910
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,433
Um,
the thing that concerns me most in this 

911
00:51:26,551 --> 00:51:30,420
legislation is compelled speech.
And I think that's very concerning.

912
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:31,983
Um,
this committee is hearing from Megan 

913
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:38,400
Murphy who told us her opposition to 
this concept of gender fluidity,

914
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:42,120
fluidity because you believe gender is a
social construction.

915
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:43,493
And Dr Gad Saad also posed for this 
legislation because of his belief in 

916
00:51:47,371 --> 00:51:48,204
evolutionary biology.
What this shows is that with bill 

917
00:51:51,961 --> 00:51:56,130
[inaudible] and we are prematurely 
shutting down a discussion on gender and

918
00:51:56,131 --> 00:51:58,600
sex as far from settler appears to be 
fair,

919
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,290
settled.
Uh,

920
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:01,243
and in my opinion,
when we looked at the provincial 

921
00:52:02,041 --> 00:52:06,750
definition is set up by the commissions.
We are enshrining the theory of a gender

922
00:52:06,751 --> 00:52:09,800
spectrum into the law.
I'm one of you can comment on

923
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:11,693
that's exactly what we're doing.
We're in and I think I think that that 

924
00:52:14,161 --> 00:52:16,980
might even be more dangerous than in my 
opinion,

925
00:52:16,981 --> 00:52:17,814
than the compelled speech issue because 
the social constructionist view of 

926
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:24,360
gender isn't another opinion.
It's just wrong.

927
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,260
So because I can.
I can tell you why that is fairly.

928
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:31,500
I'll take one minute to do that.
Well,

929
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:36,210
the proposition that's instantiated,
for example in this particular visual,

930
00:52:36,211 --> 00:52:39,690
which is a good representation of the of
the philosophy of the policies,

931
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,033
is that there is no causal relationship 
between these four dimensions of 

932
00:52:44,101 --> 00:52:49,101
identity and that's palpably observed.
I mean 98 percent of people.

933
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:50,143
It's 99 point seven percent of people 
who inhabit a body with a given 

934
00:52:53,611 --> 00:52:56,970
biological sex identify it with that 
biological sex.

935
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:59,910
It's.
It's incredibly tightly linked.

936
00:52:59,911 --> 00:53:00,744
If you can't
attribute causality to a link that 

937
00:53:04,231 --> 00:53:05,970
that's tight,
that's tight.

938
00:53:05,971 --> 00:53:06,804
You have to dispense with the notion of 
causality altogether and then of the 

939
00:53:10,111 --> 00:53:10,944
people who who identify as say,
as male or female who were also 

940
00:53:14,131 --> 00:53:15,780
biologically male or female.

941
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,673
The vast majority of them have this 
sexual preference that would go along 

942
00:53:18,991 --> 00:53:21,810
with that and the gender identity and 
gender expression.

943
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:23,063
These,
these levels of analysis are 

944
00:53:23,971 --> 00:53:24,804
unbelievably tightly linked and the,
the evidence that biological factors 

945
00:53:28,351 --> 00:53:32,460
play a role in determining gender 
identity is in a word overwhelming.

946
00:53:32,461 --> 00:53:36,720
There isn't a serious scientist alive 
who would dispute that now you get,

947
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:37,703
you get disputes about it,
but they always stem from essentially 

948
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:43,770
from the humanities.
And as far as I'm concerned,

949
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:44,663
I've looked at it very carefully.
Those arguments are entirely 

950
00:53:47,491 --> 00:53:48,324
ideologically driven.
It's a tenant of the ideology that 

951
00:53:51,091 --> 00:53:51,924
identity is socially constructed.
And that's partly why it's been 

952
00:53:54,181 --> 00:53:57,840
instantiated into law because there's no
way they're going to win the argument,

953
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,480
but they can certainly win,
let's say the propaganda war,

954
00:54:00,481 --> 00:54:03,570
especially by foisting,
this sort of reprehensible,

955
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:05,970
uh,
advertising information on children.

956
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,150
And that's part of the,
that's part of the express intent.

957
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:10,163
I would add.
A trans complainants have been covered 

958
00:54:13,231 --> 00:54:16,860
under the existing grounds of sex before
the tribunals across Canada.

959
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:21,480
And as the Minister of Justice said,
they are bringing this legislation in as

960
00:54:21,481 --> 00:54:23,940
a symbolic gesture.
And so,

961
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:24,873
uh,
I leave it to you to question what that 

962
00:54:25,741 --> 00:54:26,730
gesture may be,
but,

963
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:27,683
but this community has been protected 
under the existing grounds that are 

964
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,060
found in most of the human rights codes 
across,

965
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:33,894
uh,
across Canada and on the grounds of sex 

966
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:38,330
here,
Senator Israel,

967
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:43,410
uh,
Mr Brown or Mr Peterson,

968
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:44,830
the,
uh,

969
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:48,670
Justice Wagner from the Supreme Court in
a seminar,

970
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:51,270
the Ottawa University,
uh,

971
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,193
in early March of this year,
which was a couple of months ago that 

972
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:57,600
stated the following,
of course,

973
00:54:57,601 --> 00:55:01,050
he was not giving a decision from the 
bench you.

974
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:04,470
Nobody was expressing his views.
And if you allow me,

975
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:05,304
I will quote him.
It's short when the court eventually 

976
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:11,910
faces a question touching on transgender
identity.

977
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:16,380
These to preposition will provide 
essential frames of reference.

978
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:19,770
First one,
that identity is not fixed,

979
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:24,390
but changing as the first proposal.
And then the second one,

980
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:29,280
that identity is not innate but 
contextual.

981
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:32,460
I'll repeat that the identity is not 
innate,

982
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:33,870
but contextual or,

983
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:35,780
uh,
end of quote.

984
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,730
Um,
I,

985
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:38,573
I,
I read that and I try to understand the 

986
00:55:41,511 --> 00:55:43,160
implication,
uh,

987
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:44,960
of this,
you know,

988
00:55:44,961 --> 00:55:47,180
those two binary kinds of,
uh,

989
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:48,023
of,
uh,

990
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:48,973
elements of that and he says the court,
so I bet that he might have spoken to 

991
00:55:53,871 --> 00:55:56,720
colleagues or you know,
the profession generally

992
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,113
would you,
would you have a quarrel with that kind 

993
00:56:02,661 --> 00:56:03,494
of approach to the definition of 
transgender a reality or a few things 

994
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:09,543
that it's a proper way of approaching 
legally the issues because as you 

995
00:56:16,251 --> 00:56:18,830
forcefully explain,
uh,

996
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,140
somebody,
one day my challenge,

997
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:21,711
uh,
you know,

998
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:25,930
the proposal,
the policies and all wet could stem from

999
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:29,380
the enactment of those legislations.
So in other words,

1000
00:56:29,381 --> 00:56:32,410
we'll find ourselves into court one day 
and we will have to,

1001
00:56:32,411 --> 00:56:33,250
are,
you know,

1002
00:56:33,251 --> 00:56:34,084
to analyze and argue the case at least 
taking into account that references 

1003
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:41,253
those references.
That just is wagner mentioned not long 

1004
00:56:43,661 --> 00:56:45,080
ago.
So I'll you,

1005
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:47,020
you will react to that.
Well,

1006
00:56:47,021 --> 00:56:50,560
I want to make sure I understand your 
question properly.

1007
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:51,513
So

1008
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:53,060
when,
when the justice said this,

1009
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:53,923
was he implying that the identity is not
fixed but it is changing and that 

1010
00:56:58,761 --> 00:57:03,100
identity wasn't innate and it was 
contextual or was he outlining the,

1011
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:03,983
the,
the,

1012
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:05,910
the arena within which

1013
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:07,380
this debate might take place?
No,

1014
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:08,710
he was essentially,
it was,

1015
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,420
you know,
there was another speech on this.

1016
00:57:10,450 --> 00:57:11,283
Essentially it was more if I can use an 
expression that Mr Brown will 

1017
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:16,520
understand.
It was rather an arbitrary,

1018
00:57:16,521 --> 00:57:17,710
you know,
in a conference.

1019
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:20,740
The conference was about identity.
But of course,

1020
00:57:20,741 --> 00:57:21,660
uh,
since uh,

1021
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:26,050
you know,
identity is a topic of comment on common

1022
00:57:26,051 --> 00:57:28,370
debates in Canada.
He felt that,

1023
00:57:28,371 --> 00:57:29,870
uh,
it was fully,

1024
00:57:29,871 --> 00:57:30,910
if he would,
you know,

1025
00:57:31,210 --> 00:57:32,043
I should say,
put his grain of salt in the public 

1026
00:57:34,241 --> 00:57:38,170
debate by establishing what he thinks 
is,

1027
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:39,253
you know,
out to define transgender identity and 

1028
00:57:41,950 --> 00:57:44,560
establish some parameters.
Let's,

1029
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,830
let's assume that it is changing and 
contextual.

1030
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:49,533
Okay.
Then why is conversion therapy a 

1031
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:52,570
problem?
See,

1032
00:57:52,571 --> 00:57:53,404
this is what I see.
The thing is is that when I started 

1033
00:57:55,511 --> 00:57:56,344
opposing this bill,
people immediately assume that I was 

1034
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,104
transphobic and racist and all these 
other epithets that they're perfectly 

1035
00:58:02,051 --> 00:58:04,150
willing to try it forth at a moment's 
notice,

1036
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:05,373
but you know,
there's been a tremendous attempt to 

1037
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:09,520
make conversion therapy for people who 
are gay,

1038
00:58:09,521 --> 00:58:10,480
illegal,
right?

1039
00:58:10,481 --> 00:58:14,500
And the proposition is predicated on the
idea that the identity,

1040
00:58:14,501 --> 00:58:18,640
the sexual preference,
identity is not changing nor contextual.

1041
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:19,743
It's fundamental.
And really what that means is that it's 

1042
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:23,110
grounded in something like biology.
It's,

1043
00:58:23,111 --> 00:58:23,741
okay,
fine,

1044
00:58:23,741 --> 00:58:24,940
let's scrap that.
Okay,

1045
00:58:24,941 --> 00:58:26,890
now it's going to be changing and 
contextual.

1046
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:27,963
Okay,
then why can't it be changed with 

1047
00:58:29,741 --> 00:58:30,574
context?
So this is part of the problem with the 

1048
00:58:34,091 --> 00:58:34,924
policies.
Is there so incoherent that they're 

1049
00:58:36,281 --> 00:58:39,250
going to work against the people that 
they're designed to protect?

1050
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,980
Now people have a hard time believing I 
care about that,

1051
00:58:41,981 --> 00:58:42,814
but you know,
the fact that I've been called things 

1052
00:58:44,381 --> 00:58:49,210
doesn't mean that that's what I am.
So you know a lot of people who have,

1053
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:50,613
let's call it a nonstandard identity,
the tightest argument they have for 

1054
00:58:55,331 --> 00:58:56,164
public acceptance of that identity is 
that it's powerfully constrained by 

1055
00:58:59,441 --> 00:59:03,160
biological processes that are beyond 
their voluntary control.

1056
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:04,353
So instantiate this view of humanity,
the social constructionist view of 

1057
00:59:07,751 --> 00:59:08,584
humanity,
and you can waive those claims goodbye 

1058
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:10,773
because they are completely,
they are at complete odds with the 

1059
00:59:14,561 --> 00:59:18,290
social constructionist view point and I 
think that's a big mistake and I,

1060
00:59:18,291 --> 00:59:19,124
I really do believe that that will 
backfire hard against the people who 

1061
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:26,120
this legislation is designed to protect.
If it's mutable,

1062
00:59:26,121 --> 00:59:26,954
changeable,
only subjective and transformable on a 

1063
00:59:30,021 --> 00:59:30,854
whim,
then why should anyone have any respect 

1064
00:59:33,261 --> 00:59:34,370
for it?
Gentleman,

1065
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:35,223
they going to have to intervene.
The hour has flown by and we very much 

1066
00:59:38,391 --> 00:59:40,850
appreciate your appearance here today 
and your testimony as well.

1067
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:41,743
Thank you.
We'll suspend briefly before hearing 

1068
00:59:44,241 --> 00:59:45,074
from an expert.
