1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,930
So how are we going to do this?
Are People just going to ask?

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,730
All right,

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,280
yes.
Speed brings chaos.

4
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,010
So you would ask that.
The question is,

5
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:35,070
the question is speech brings order out 
of chaos.

6
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,163
That's what I said,
but it appears that speech brings chaos 

7
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:42,320
out of order as well.
And the answer to that is it does,

8
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,583
right?
There was only so many complications I 

9
00:00:45,141 --> 00:00:47,300
could address in the talk 
simultaneously.

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,633
If you look at,
if you look at the most archaic of 

11
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:52,514
Archetypal Heroes,
the heroes confront something that 

12
00:00:55,731 --> 00:00:56,564
represents chaos.
It's usually a monster that bears a 

13
00:00:59,151 --> 00:00:59,984
treasure of some sort,
and that's a symbolic representation of 

14
00:01:03,111 --> 00:01:05,360
the class of all unexplored things,
right?

15
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:06,194
Because things that we have not yet 
explored are threatening and 

16
00:01:08,121 --> 00:01:11,420
destructive,
but also offer us infinite potential,

17
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,200
but more elaborated hero stories,
let's say.

18
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,240
Also reverse that and say that,
well,

19
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:19,610
there are times when the order has 
become so corrupted,

20
00:01:19,611 --> 00:01:22,280
rigid,
that free speech fragments that into its

21
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:24,230
parts so that it can rejuvenate itself.

22
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,580
And so actually in the gospels,
that's the hero.

23
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:32,840
That Christ is basically represented as.
He's not so much the dragon.

24
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:35,810
Confronting the dragon slayer who 
gathers the treasure,

25
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:36,644
although that's implicit in the in the 
juxtaposition of Christ with the figure 

26
00:01:40,311 --> 00:01:41,144
of like a Serpentine Satan,
but Christ is the thing that stands up 

27
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,104
against the corrupt state and 
rejuvenated through speech and so 

28
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,320
technically speaking,
free speech.

29
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:52,154
The logos is the thing that mediates 
between chaos and order and you can 

30
00:01:55,131 --> 00:01:57,150
think about this is represented in,
in,

31
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,550
in,
in many cultures.

32
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:01,190
This idea,
you can see it most specifically,

33
00:02:01,191 --> 00:02:02,024
I would say in the Dallas 
conceptualization because in the Dallas 

34
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:07,820
world being is made out of chaos and 
order,

35
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,010
Yin and Yang,
masculine and feminine.

36
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,270
Fundamentally it's chaos in order in 
order is the fact that wherever you go,

37
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,283
there are things you understand in order
and chaos is the fact that wherever you 

38
00:02:18,051 --> 00:02:18,884
go there are things you don't understand
and so the idea is that being is made 

39
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:25,310
out of the things that you understand 
and the things that you don't understand

40
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,263
and it's always that way,
which is why dow is the symbol of being 

41
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:31,790
per se,
and it's the case.

42
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,740
Your brain is adapted.
In fact,

43
00:02:33,741 --> 00:02:34,574
it's partly why it has two hemispheres 
for the world that you understand and 

44
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:41,180
the world you don't understand the world
you understand roughly speaking,

45
00:02:41,181 --> 00:02:44,990
being handled by the left and the world.
You don't understand roughly speaking,

46
00:02:44,991 --> 00:02:47,180
being handled by the right.
Well,

47
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,390
it's that line down the middle,
that's Dow,

48
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,643
that's meaning,
and if you have one foot in chaos and 

49
00:02:53,511 --> 00:02:55,970
one foot in order,
you're maximizing information,

50
00:02:55,971 --> 00:02:56,804
float and rejuvenating yourself at the 
same time that you're maintaining 

51
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,330
structure and you will report on that 
internally as engagement in the world.

52
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,853
It's the most fundamental orienting 
sense that you have and it's deeply 

53
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:12,070
instantiated neurologically,
unbelievably deeply,

54
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:17,290
and so it really is the case from an 
evolutionary perspective that reality is

55
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,130
chaos and order.
It's that to which you're adapted and so

56
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:21,964
sometimes you're speaking on behalf of 
chaos and sometimes you're speaking on 

57
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:25,324
behalf of order.

58
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,070
It's more complicated than now too 
though,

59
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:30,170
because when we have a dialog saying 
we're,

60
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,670
we're mutually attempting to climb 
towards the truth.

61
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,920
Instead of convincing each other that 
we're right,

62
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,430
say,
then what we're doing is engaging in the

63
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:40,264
simultaneous fragmentation of old and 
archaic belief systems and they're 

64
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:44,794
updating and you can experience that 
because someone will say something that 

65
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,173
sets you back and then you'll get what 
they're saying and it'll click together 

66
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:54,910
and what you're experiencing is the 
death of a of a,

67
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,900
of an old conceptualization structure,
its disintegration,

68
00:03:59,050 --> 00:03:59,883
and then it's reconfiguration in a 
tighter and tighter order and people 

69
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:05,110
love that.
They live for that.

70
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:05,680
It's,
it's,

71
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,513
it's really,
it's what keeps you alive and you can 

72
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,980
experience that in a deep conversation,
a truthful conversation,

73
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,130
a meeting of the minds and soul,
and people love that.

74
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:15,964
It's curative.
All psychotherapists know this because 

75
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:19,594
what you do in psychotherapy as well,
in addition to helping people face the 

76
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:27,340
things that they're most afraid of so 
that they can overcome them,

77
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,400
is to allow them to tell someone the 
truth.

78
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,070
What happened to you all?
Listen,

79
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,653
so they tell you and they take 
themselves apart and put themselves 

80
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:38,170
together.
Well,

81
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:42,820
they're speaking the truth about what 
happened and it puts them together.

82
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,950
It's at the.
No,

83
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:48,490
the two fundamental elements of 
psychotherapy are let's find what you're

84
00:04:48,491 --> 00:04:49,324
afraid of and avoiding and help you 
confront it so that you can gather the 

85
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:53,194
information that's there and let's allow
you to lay your story out in all of its 

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,560
catastrophe in detail so that you can 
straighten yourself out through speech.

87
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,990
It's exactly what happens in 
psychotherapy,

88
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,170
so when it should happen in every real 
relationship,

89
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:10,660
it's.
It's the spiritual purpose of a marriage

90
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:11,650
fundamentally,
right?

91
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:16,090
Because you face someone who's different
than you that you are tied to and cannot

92
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:19,600
run from,
and so you can reveal your really,

93
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,860
really,
it's a critical.

94
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,760
It's a critical part of marriage because
if you can run from someone,

95
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:25,594
they will never show you their true face
because if someone shows you their true 

96
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:30,910
face,
you will run,

97
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,580
and so you say,
in a marriage ceremony,

98
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,990
I will allow you to show me your true 
face and I will not run,

99
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,680
and unless you mean that you'll never be
married.

100
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,873
You'll never understand what it means 
and you'll never reap the benefits of 

101
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:47,860
it.
Which are practical obviously,

102
00:05:47,861 --> 00:05:52,270
but also spiritual and psychological.
There's a reason for the vow,

103
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,313
but it has to be a vow because otherwise
you have a back door open and you'll 

104
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:57,154
never really tell the person what your 
light and no bloody wonder because 

105
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:03,160
really,
who wants to know what you're like,

106
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,950
not even you.
That's for sure.

107
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,253
I'm not surprised.
I want to thank you because what was 

108
00:06:14,261 --> 00:06:17,530
surprising about your lecture today was 
this concept of altruism.

109
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,373
I think you've been able to just put 
everything together and at the end come 

110
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:25,050
up with a higher value of altruism and 
to was a surprise.

111
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,033
You don't come in here and I have a 
relationship with altruism and the one 

112
00:06:29,501 --> 00:06:33,450
that I find that it's difficult for me 
is that this is an evolutionary process.

113
00:06:33,451 --> 00:06:35,930
So my brain is an organ is developed.
You know,

114
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,210
and and I'm amazed at how often I think 
of three people,

115
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,081
me,
myself,

116
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:45,850
and I do the point where where I've 
actually written down,

117
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,443
counted all of the iterations of me,
myself and I and neither my thoughts or 

118
00:06:50,591 --> 00:06:53,560
my speech or even in someone else's.
Then you'll get the page.

119
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,540
We think of.
We,

120
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:56,943
as far as I've been able to ascertain,
it's because I have to expend energy to 

121
00:07:00,341 --> 00:07:01,174
think about someone else and and and yet
yet I'm addicted to decent comfort 

122
00:07:07,091 --> 00:07:09,760
because my natural evolution is what?
Peace and comfort.

123
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:12,860
You hear it in alcoholics anonymous.
Take the problem.

124
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,900
You're addicted to ease and comfort.
How do I overcome my,

125
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:24,050
my sense of ease and comfort to be able 
to make altruism

126
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,980
a more natural state of being.

127
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,050
Good.
Good.

128
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,870
Good question.
So the question is,

129
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:36,530
the first was a comment about the 
emphasis in my talk today on altruism,

130
00:07:37,201 --> 00:07:38,034
and the second is how do I,
how do people overcome their proclivity 

131
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,920
to only act on their own behalf?
Okay,

132
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:44,754
so the first thing I will say is that I 
don't believe that what I spoke about 

133
00:07:48,421 --> 00:07:51,330
today was in favor of altruism.
And,

134
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,110
and that's not a negative comment on 
your question,

135
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,410
but there.
So there's a,

136
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,710
there's,
there's a pride.

137
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,563
Here's a primary religious injunction.
Treat the other person like you would 

138
00:08:03,841 --> 00:08:04,674
like to be treated yourself.
That does not mean be nice to other 

139
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:08,964
people.
It does not mean sacrifice yourself 

140
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,610
excessively for other people.
It means think about the other person as

141
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,454
if they were you,
and figuring out how you can mutually 

142
00:08:20,371 --> 00:08:23,490
interacts to better both of you.
At the same time,

143
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,980
you have to build yourself into the 
equation.

144
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,173
It's an equation.
It's not that it's not that others are 

145
00:08:30,091 --> 00:08:32,580
more valuable,
it's that we're all valuable,

146
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:34,140
were equally valuable,
and then you think,

147
00:08:34,141 --> 00:08:35,790
well,
how do you remind yourself of that?

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,920
And the answer to that is through terror
because terror is the genuine motivator,

149
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:41,754
so they save.
Fear of God is the beginning of all 

150
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:47,220
wisdom.
What does that mean?

151
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,893
On means?
First that you don't get away with 

152
00:08:49,741 --> 00:08:54,741
anything and it's really useful to know 
that because if you really know that you

153
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:57,980
won't to get away with while you still 
will because people are stupid but,

154
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,900
but at least it will mitigate the 
possibility.

155
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,270
So
here,

156
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:05,280
I'll tell you something that young said.
This is quite.

157
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,450
This is quite profound and I think the 
right answer to this question.

158
00:09:09,451 --> 00:09:14,260
So young believed he was interested in 
the emergence of higher morality.

159
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,740
Something that the developmental 
psychologist,

160
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:18,900
Yom Piaget was also interested in.

161
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:21,750
Here's a thought.
We started out as individuals,

162
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,940
then we learned to play games with other
people,

163
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:25,140
kids,
children,

164
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,820
learn how to play games with other 
children,

165
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:29,610
and that made them social.
So our society is a game.

166
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:34,170
It's a giant gate that we're all playing
together voluntarily.

167
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,220
And so children will first learned how 
to play the game and only later did they

168
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:39,054
learn the rules of the game and he 
learned how to play the game first and 

169
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:43,560
then learn the rules,
how to speak the rules,

170
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,753
and then at some point they realized 
that they were also creators of the 

171
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:47,574
rules.
And so that's moral development on a 

172
00:09:51,781 --> 00:09:52,950
continual on,
on a.

173
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:57,390
it's not a continuum,
it's fractured staircase upward,

174
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:02,130
but young was interested in elements of 
moral action that were higher than that.

175
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:04,980
And so he conceptualized it 
symbolically.

176
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:05,814
So imagine this,
you did this in the last book he wrote 

177
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:09,350
called mysterium conjunction us.

178
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,093
So imagine that you exist so that your 
conceptual structures and your emotions 

179
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:17,580
are in an uneasy relationship with one 
another.

180
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,700
So you're sort of a house divided 
amongst yourself.

181
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,073
And so what you have to do is you have 
to put together your mind and your and 

182
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,160
your emotions so that they're working as
a,

183
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,233
as a unit,
and you do that in part by actually 

184
00:10:28,771 --> 00:10:29,604
being forthright about what it is that 
you want for yourself and to other 

185
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:36,480
people and to learn how to negotiate 
that so that inner tension disappears.

186
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,463
And so now you're a unified.
You're a unified entity of emotion and 

187
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:43,950
thought they're not conflicting with one
another.

188
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:48,930
And then what you do is you take that 
entity which is still in some sense,

189
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:52,140
separate from your body because you're 
not acting these out and you bring those

190
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:52,974
two together and he thought about that 
as the psychological equivalent of the 

191
00:10:56,251 --> 00:11:00,510
incarnation had integrated spirit 
integrating with the body.

192
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,523
And what that means is that you take 
your emotions and motivations and 

193
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:09,120
capacity for thinking that are now one 
thing and you act out those things you.

194
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:09,983
So you embodied them in the world.
And that's another thing that brings 

195
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:12,804
integrity.
And then there was a step past that in 

196
00:11:14,401 --> 00:11:17,350
the step past that is to understand that
there's no d.

197
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,760
So you have the integrated spirit,
mind and body

198
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,333
in opposition to the world and this,
the next thing you do is realize that 

199
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:29,360
there is no opposition with the world.
Is that what you are is a.

200
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,050
This is very,
very complicated.

201
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,180
You're walking down the street,
but the street is a good example of this

202
00:11:36,181 --> 00:11:38,100
in Toronto and they're guesstimated 
alcoholic,

203
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:41,190
schizophrenia,
littering the landscape so to speak.

204
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,900
You walk around them,
you say,

205
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:44,760
well,
that's not me.

206
00:11:44,761 --> 00:11:45,750
It's like,
yes it is.

207
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:46,973
It's you in so far as your tendency is 
to react in a negative way and to start 

208
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:53,094
the territory.
It's a disturbance in your field of 

209
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:57,250
being.
It's you.

210
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,653
Now you don't know what to do about it 
and I wouldn't recommend that you do 

211
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:02,410
anything because you'd probably just 
make it worse.

212
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,180
It's a very big problem that's lying 
there on the sidewalk and it may be well

213
00:12:07,181 --> 00:12:08,014
beyond your capacity to fix it,
but in so far as it's a disturbance in 

214
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:14,170
your field of being,
it's you,

215
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:19,840
it's you and all the problems that are 
in the world that you experience there,

216
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:24,841
you and so you stop thinking about 
things in terms of an opposition between

217
00:12:24,881 --> 00:12:25,714
what's good for you and what's good for 
the world because there is no 

218
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:28,114
difference.

219
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,163
There's no difference between the two 
and that that doesn't mean that the 

220
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:32,164
pathway from what's good for you in your
more limited domain to what's good for 

221
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:39,250
everyone is an easy one to compute.
It's very,

222
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:41,410
very difficult.
But there is no,

223
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,930
there is no technical difference between
them,

224
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:47,800
you know,
so if I'm engaged in a psychotherapeutic

225
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:50,740
dialogue with my clients when I'm doing 
it properly,

226
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,383
it's not like they're learning from me.
It's that we're learning together and 

227
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,470
every time I solved one of their 
problems or help them solve one of their

228
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:02,680
problems are you help myself.
So of one of my problems,

229
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:05,050
you know,
because people bring to me,

230
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:05,884
bring into my sessions the terrible 
things that go wrong with people in 

231
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:11,200
life.
Their partner has cancer,

232
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:15,010
their father's father has Alzheimer's,
they're suffering with alcoholism.

233
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,143
Their career is collapsing like these 
aren't things that are happening to 

234
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:19,474
them.

235
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:20,523
These are things that happen to everyone
and to figure out how to solve that for 

236
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,170
someone is to figure out how to solve it
for yourself.

237
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:30,920
There's no difference whatsoever and so 
and then so there's to know that to,

238
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,490
to think of that and certainly works in 
in a,

239
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,440
in a,
in an intimate relationship.

240
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:39,130
If you think that you're somehow 
different than your wife,

241
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,000
while certainly she's going to remind 
you otherwise constantly,

242
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,620
but it's an.
It's an error.

243
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:45,454
It's an error because you're.
You're tied together so tightly that 

244
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,463
whatever happens to one inevitably 
happens to the other and that's true in 

245
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:59,110
in the work reality that we all inhabit.
So then the terror thing emerges.

246
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,083
When you start to realize that those 
problems that you don't address that or 

247
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:08,941
maybe magnified by your impulsive and 
foolishly self centered and instrumental

248
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:10,564
behavior,
you're manipulating the world on behalf 

249
00:14:12,221 --> 00:14:17,221
of your own narrow interests,
those will come back to haunt you and so

250
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,890
it's a terrifying thing to think 
through,

251
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,440
but once you think through and 
understand it,

252
00:14:23,441 --> 00:14:26,980
then what happens is you're more afraid 
of acting selfishly,

253
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,980
then you are willing to do it.
You think,

254
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,060
no,
I'm not doing that.

255
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,730
Why?
Because I know all hell will break loose

256
00:14:33,731 --> 00:14:38,140
if I do that and I'm not going there.
And so the terror element is a huge one.

257
00:14:38,141 --> 00:14:38,974
It makes it,
it,

258
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:42,250
it,
it fortifies your because you can't just

259
00:14:42,251 --> 00:14:45,220
act
properly.

260
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,500
You don't have the moral fortitude for 
that.

261
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,440
You can aim it the good and run from 
what's terrible.

262
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,130
Then you're,
then you're motivated.

263
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,400
So if I've understood you,
I just want to recap,

264
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,180
if you're suggesting a subsidiary with 
your environment,

265
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,400
not the,
not the few,

266
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,870
uh,
reaching out to your environment.

267
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,160
That's an expenditure of energy,
but rather as an investment.

268
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,870
Yes,
it's an investment.

269
00:15:08,871 --> 00:15:10,550
That's a very good way of putting it.
Yes.

270
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,630
I was wondering if you could,
if it's plausible,

271
00:15:14,631 --> 00:15:15,464
it's race on our market.
Typical or narrative origin for some of 

272
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:19,203
the intellectual
denied the structures of language as 

273
00:15:25,261 --> 00:15:29,940
corresponds to reality.
Denied the psyche of the individual.

274
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:31,253
I think you've done some of your top two
that you think is possible from a 

275
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:37,830
psychological perspective to trace the 
narrative,

276
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,920
origin,
postmodernism and human behavior,

277
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,660
or is it so unnatural?

278
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:43,951
No,
no,

279
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:44,350
no,
no.

280
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,183
It's an architect,
architect.

281
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:48,760
I mean there's always.
There's always a forest,

282
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:50,020
so to speak,
that opposes.

283
00:15:50,021 --> 00:15:53,530
The logo's always had that.
That's the hostile brothers.

284
00:15:53,531 --> 00:15:57,520
It's a classic archetypal story.
There's always cain and Abel.

285
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:02,200
There's always hostility between the two
primary modes of operating in the world,

286
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,220
so and this is the.
This is the modern manifestation of that

287
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,650
and it's partly.
It's partly a good thing.

288
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:13,150
Maybe in some sense because it's useful 
to be deeply challenged.

289
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,290
It's good to have an enemy because the 
enemy makes you think.

290
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:19,990
The enemy tells you things that no one 
else will tell you.

291
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,740
It's a DNA and it's an advert.
Adversity.

292
00:16:22,741 --> 00:16:24,460
It's an ad.
It's the adversary that,

293
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,410
that,
that,

294
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:30,410
that stops you from being merely inert,
and so postmodernism plays that role.

295
00:16:30,941 --> 00:16:33,160
It's,
it's extraordinarily critical,

296
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:38,230
but,
but things can go too far and and,

297
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,970
and the motives and things can go too 
far when they go too far,

298
00:16:42,971 --> 00:16:43,804
they reverse.
That's what happens and hopefully 

299
00:16:45,971 --> 00:16:48,190
they're reversing now hopefully

300
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:56,603
as being mainly associated,
we seem to be seeing something that had 

301
00:17:02,431 --> 00:17:05,980
a different form today that might be,
is more associated with the family.

302
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,713
Can you speak to that and also what is 
the nature of this power over men that 

303
00:17:12,941 --> 00:17:15,120
it seems to be able to silence us.

304
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,890
Okay,
so the question is,

305
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,243
the totalitarian forms that we've seen 
primarily in the past have been male 

306
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,913
and,
but maybe we're seeing something 

307
00:17:26,091 --> 00:17:29,540
different now.
I really don't think it's different.

308
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,374
I think it's,
it's of the other common kind that's 

309
00:17:33,591 --> 00:17:37,550
expanded in its dominion,
so you imagine that there's an essential

310
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:38,384
feminine pathology just as there is an 
essential masculine pathology and the 

311
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:46,430
essential feminine pathology.
Freud mapped out it's the eternal mother

312
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,600
and the mother is the mother that gets 
too close to her children.

313
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,290
Right.
And intermingles herself with them too,

314
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:57,930
too great.
A degree that in her attempts to protect

315
00:17:57,931 --> 00:17:58,764
them undermines them fatally.
And so there's a classic representation 

316
00:18:03,571 --> 00:18:04,404
of the feminine in the West and the 
classic representation is married and 

317
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,690
here,
here's one of the representations.

318
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:10,524
It's lovely and it's derived at least in
part from the story of Mary and the 

319
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:15,690
snake in the garden of Eden.

320
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:20,690
And so Mary has her foot on a serpent 
and she's holding Christ off to the side

321
00:18:21,181 --> 00:18:22,500
like this.
Well,

322
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,300
that's exactly what mothers have always 
done.

323
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:25,703
It's a biological portrait of human 
women is they hold their infants out of 

324
00:18:29,971 --> 00:18:33,150
the reach of the terrible Serpentine 
Predator.

325
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,990
Obviously that's what we do.
Well that's fine,

326
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,250
but adults aren't infants and neither 
are children.

327
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:45,090
And if you treat them like they are,
you undermine them,

328
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,390
you,
you,

329
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,720
you,
you pathologize them,

330
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:52,560
you turn them into old infants.
That's an ugly thing.

331
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,350
And that's the Friday a nightmare you 
know,

332
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,613
in,
in this happens in therapy very 

333
00:18:58,201 --> 00:18:59,220
frequently.
I mean,

334
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,980
you can be tangled into a terrible 
relationship with your father.

335
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:07,220
That's often either because he was 
absent or abusive or tyrannical.

336
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,820
Something like that,
but that the standard pathology with mom

337
00:19:11,821 --> 00:19:14,950
is she did everything for you.
Well,

338
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:19,440
what's left for you to do nothing 
including never leaving.

339
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,223
Right,
and that's the motivation for the woman 

340
00:19:26,641 --> 00:19:30,780
who's nothing but protective mother.
There's no role outside of nurturing,

341
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,480
of nurturing,
nurturing,

342
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,160
of nurture,
and of infants,

343
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:39,390
of nurturer,
of infants.

344
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:40,561
Well,
you just keep them.

345
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:42,210
Infants,
they'll never leave.

346
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:47,130
It might kill you in your sleep,
but they'll never leave.

347
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,760
Sure,
sure.

348
00:19:50,761 --> 00:19:51,594
I mean it's so comical watching the 
feminist postmodernist in particular 

349
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:56,243
rattle on about the absence of gender 
reality and act out the archetipal 

350
00:20:01,741 --> 00:20:06,150
devouring mother at exactly the same 
time for them,

351
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:07,703
for them.
The world is divided into predators and 

352
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:11,334
infants and the predators are evil and 
need to be stopped and the infants need 

353
00:20:15,871 --> 00:20:18,360
to be cared for.
Well,

354
00:20:18,361 --> 00:20:22,920
that's what the mother does,
but adults are not infants

355
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,940
and all you do is destroy them when you 
treat them that way,

356
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:29,640
especially when they're adolescents and 
just starting to develop.

357
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,540
Now there's.
There's a rule that I attempted to abide

358
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:34,374
by when I had small children and the 
rule was don't do anything for your 

359
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:43,260
children that they can do themselves and
it's annoying that rule because it takes

360
00:20:43,261 --> 00:20:47,290
you like 15 seconds to to dress a two 
year old,

361
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,180
but you let the two year old dress 
himself.

362
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:53,650
It's like 15 minutes or 20 minutes or 
half an hour.

363
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:54,484
You chase them around the house,
but if you let them learn to dress 

364
00:20:57,011 --> 00:20:58,780
themselves,
then you don't have to dress themselves.

365
00:20:58,781 --> 00:20:59,614
Any direct dress them anymore and they 
can do it and you do that with setting 

366
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:04,090
the table and you do that with 
everything.

367
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:04,781
It's like,
no,

368
00:21:04,781 --> 00:21:05,614
it's okay.
You do that now while I care for you so 

369
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:08,530
much.
Let me do that for you.

370
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:09,364
It's like I don't care for you at all 
when I say that I don't care for you at 

371
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:12,904
all.
I'm going to stop doing everything I 

372
00:21:14,081 --> 00:21:17,410
possibly can for you as rapidly as I 
possibly can say,

373
00:21:17,411 --> 00:21:18,101
well,
that's great.

374
00:21:18,101 --> 00:21:18,934
That's how you work in an old age home.
Do not do anything for the inhabitants 

375
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:24,934
that they can do themselves because you 
robbed them of the last vestiges of 

376
00:21:27,011 --> 00:21:27,940
their independence,
right?

377
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,550
It's what you do when you're a manager,
if you're a good manager,

378
00:21:30,551 --> 00:21:31,384
you make yourself superfluous by 
extending autonomy and independence to 

379
00:21:35,891 --> 00:21:38,980
the people that you manage so that they 
can take over the whole job.

380
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,173
You don't do that by doing everything 
for people and you certainly don't do 

381
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:43,924
that by dividing the world 
archetypically and uncritically into 

382
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,980
predators.
Those who have more and victims,

383
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,873
infants,
those who have nothing and acting like 

384
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:56,740
all you can ever do is protect them.
Protect.

385
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,300
First of all,
you can't protect people.

386
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,790
You can only make them strong.
That's it.

387
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,773
You cannot protect them.
You can make them strong and then they 

388
00:22:04,271 --> 00:22:06,520
can predict themselves,
but then they don't need you.

389
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,970
Right,
and there's the underground pathological

390
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:11,920
elements of the devouring mother.
It's like,

391
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,360
never leave me.
Here's the deal.

392
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,570
I'll do everything for you.
You just never leave,

393
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,510
right?
That's sleeping with your mother,

394
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:20,440
right?

395
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,240
That's the Friday a nightmare,
right?

396
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,490
You don't invite your child into your 
bed,

397
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,750
right?
You distinguished between them and you,

398
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,613
you distinguish between them and your 
husband and you facilitate their 

399
00:22:31,841 --> 00:22:32,674
independence.
A part of the reason why it's useful to 

400
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:35,884
have a mother and a father is because 
the mother has to fall insanely in love 

401
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:40,930
with the infant or she'd throw it out 
the window,

402
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:42,003
right?
Because they're.

403
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,890
They're insanely demanding and they're 
always right,

404
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,293
right?
Because the right way to treat an 

405
00:22:46,871 --> 00:22:49,390
infant,
especially before nine months is I'll do

406
00:22:49,391 --> 00:22:51,640
everything for you and you're always 
right in your needs.

407
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,090
Take priority over everyone's at one 
else's and anybody that threatens you is

408
00:22:55,091 --> 00:22:56,890
terrible.
Exactly right,

409
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:00,820
but after once the kid is ambulatory and
starting to be independent,

410
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,530
that's the wrong attitude.
The attitude then is no,

411
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,073
get the hell on with it,
and men who are less prone to negative 

412
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:10,654
emotion and less compassionate are much 
better at fostering that kind of 

413
00:23:14,141 --> 00:23:18,070
independence and so it's usually then 
when they step into the family and start

414
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,083
playing with the kids rough and tumble 
play and pushing them forward and 

415
00:23:22,421 --> 00:23:23,254
saying,
you know,

416
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,070
get on with it.

417
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,170
You can do it.
You can do it at home.

418
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,350
It's very hard for a mother to play both
those rules because she has to fall,

419
00:23:29,351 --> 00:23:32,470
so in love with her infant that it's 
difficult for her to be young,

420
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,410
universal caregiver and disciplinarian 
at the same time,

421
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,583
you know,
because the roles are the roles run 

422
00:23:37,601 --> 00:23:38,434
contrary to one another.
So now women have entered the political 

423
00:23:40,031 --> 00:23:40,864
sphere right on moss and so they're 
gonna bring their essential nature with 

424
00:23:44,441 --> 00:23:47,960
them all the while saying there's no 
such thing as essential nature.

425
00:23:47,961 --> 00:23:48,770
It's like,
yeah,

426
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:49,603
there is.

427
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,143
Can we grow by the state of Western 
civilization using the new chain idea 

428
00:23:57,791 --> 00:23:58,840
that God is dead?

429
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,473
Well,
it's the wrong question in some sense 

430
00:24:02,971 --> 00:24:07,380
because I think it's too diffuse to me.
They issue Morris,

431
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,513
do you have problems in your life that 
you're not addressing that you could 

432
00:24:11,401 --> 00:24:13,710
solve?
And the answer is yes,

433
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:17,400
and it's an easy thing to figure out.
You sit on your bed one morning and say,

434
00:24:17,401 --> 00:24:20,430
okay,
there's some things that need to be done

435
00:24:20,431 --> 00:24:25,020
that I don't want to do that I could do 
that would make things better by the end

436
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,400
of the day.
What are they?

437
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,653
Well,
your,

438
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,823
your conscience will deliver those 
soccer's no time flat now and then you 

439
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:32,910
might have to say,
okay,

440
00:24:32,911 --> 00:24:37,911
well how do I entice myself into doing a
few of those and if you ask,

441
00:24:38,221 --> 00:24:39,054
instead of trying to force yourself to 
do it like you're a tyrant and a slave 

442
00:24:42,121 --> 00:24:42,954
at the same time,
you can usually negotiate with yourself 

443
00:24:45,121 --> 00:24:48,000
so that you'll start to sort those 
things out,

444
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,403
sort them out,
put your house in order and then move 

445
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:54,460
out.
Move on and out.

446
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,850
Yes,
that's a 40 and slipped by the way.

447
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,550
So it's important because the thing is 
you have a practice domain right there.

448
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,530
There are things that are within your 
grasp that you couldn't fix.

449
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:14,820
Fix them and you'll learn.
You'll learn because it's harder than it

450
00:25:14,821 --> 00:25:15,654
looks,
fixed them and you'll learn how to fix 

451
00:25:17,131 --> 00:25:20,850
things and then something else will 
beckon as another problem that you could

452
00:25:20,851 --> 00:25:23,910
fix.
You know you all have your problems.

453
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:24,893
What does that mean?
Like there's an infinite number of 

454
00:25:26,101 --> 00:25:28,140
problems in the world.
Some of them happened to be yours.

455
00:25:28,141 --> 00:25:30,480
Why is that?
I don't know exactly,

456
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,940
but you have your problems.
Great.

457
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,940
Solve them.
You know,

458
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,750
one of the things I learned as a 
therapist,

459
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,593
every therapist has to learn this is 
because one of the things you wonder 

460
00:25:40,591 --> 00:25:41,424
when you're first starting to be a 
clinician is how do you not take the 

461
00:25:44,311 --> 00:25:46,350
catastrophes of your client's home with 
you?

462
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,680
And the answer to that is because it's 
immoral to.

463
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:55,570
They're not your problems,
they're their problems like their,

464
00:25:55,571 --> 00:25:56,670
their,
their life.

465
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,590
You all,
your problems are your life.

466
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,543
You don't want to solve someone else's 
problems for them because you take away 

467
00:26:02,101 --> 00:26:02,934
the deep meaning.
That's to be found in having them work 

468
00:26:06,151 --> 00:26:09,120
through the problems on their own.
And then you steal the credit.

469
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:10,890
Well,
I can help you with that.

470
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,150
It's like,
well,

471
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:13,560
yeah,
maybe,

472
00:26:13,561 --> 00:26:15,780
but I don't help you with the next 
problem.

473
00:26:15,781 --> 00:26:17,970
Then.
So in any case,

474
00:26:17,971 --> 00:26:21,480
you sort sort out the problems that are 
right in front of you and you will,

475
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,553
it will make you grow very,
very rapidly and then you'll be able to 

476
00:26:24,601 --> 00:26:27,210
sort out more complex problems without 
making them worse.

477
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,733
So.

478
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,330
So you mentioned that through discussion
and dialogue,

479
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,730
we can order the chaos of the world 
together.

480
00:26:35,731 --> 00:26:38,070
But do you not think that there needs to
be a higher creator,

481
00:26:38,071 --> 00:26:41,940
an essence of grace,
but it would be possible like how can we

482
00:26:41,941 --> 00:26:44,370
each being flawed,
even working together

483
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,020
create meaning or something good?

484
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,203
We don't understand what we are.
We don't understand our own 

485
00:27:00,831 --> 00:27:01,664
consciousness.
It has a quality of some sort and it 

486
00:27:04,971 --> 00:27:08,450
meant it manifests itself within us.
It's an orientation towards the good.

487
00:27:08,451 --> 00:27:10,100
That might be one way of thinking about 
it,

488
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,473
freedom to do evil,
but an orientation towards the good and 

489
00:27:13,941 --> 00:27:18,380
so you participate in whatever that 
transcendent element of you is while you

490
00:27:18,381 --> 00:27:21,440
try to speak the truth and sort out the 
world.

491
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:26,740
It serves as a guide.
So I know that you're making a,

492
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:31,340
a,
a query about some transcendent reality.

493
00:27:31,341 --> 00:27:32,174
Maybe the transcendent reality of God,
but that's the best answer you're going 

494
00:27:35,301 --> 00:27:39,500
to get out of me.
Yes.

495
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,270
Okay.
Two questions.

496
00:27:47,271 --> 00:27:48,104
What's my opinion on the alt right and 
what's my opinion on cultural 

497
00:27:50,271 --> 00:27:51,104
appropriation?
The idea of cultural appropriation is 

498
00:27:53,091 --> 00:27:54,230
absolute nonsense.

499
00:27:55,180 --> 00:28:00,180
That's that.
Thank you.

500
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,253
No,
there's no difference between cultural 

501
00:28:03,701 --> 00:28:05,590
appropriation and learning from one 
another.

502
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,810
They're the same thing.
Now,

503
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:08,644
that doesn't mean I can't,
that doesn't mean that there's no theft 

504
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:14,540
between people.
There is no,

505
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:18,340
and it doesn't mean that just because 
you encounter someone else's ideas,

506
00:28:18,341 --> 00:28:21,490
you have an immediate right to those 
ideas as if they were your own.

507
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:26,560
But the idea that manifesting in your 
own behavior,

508
00:28:26,561 --> 00:28:27,394
some element of another culture,
the idea that that's somehow immoral is 

509
00:28:30,191 --> 00:28:33,450
insane.
It's actually one of the bases of peace.

510
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,513
You know,
one of the things that the various 

511
00:28:35,771 --> 00:28:36,604
groups of human beings that exist have 
to offer each other is the tremendous 

512
00:28:39,581 --> 00:28:41,890
value of their culture.
You know,

513
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,110
it's been really interesting to me,
for example,

514
00:28:44,111 --> 00:28:48,520
to watch the response of,
of all of everyone,

515
00:28:48,521 --> 00:28:52,150
but for this argument to you,
for young Caucasian males to hip hop,

516
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,793
you know,
there's an aggressiveness about hip hop 

517
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:55,774
that's really attractive to young 
Caucasian males and there's something 

518
00:28:57,521 --> 00:28:59,650
absurd about,
about the,

519
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:00,783
the,
the spectacle of the young Caucasian 

520
00:29:03,671 --> 00:29:07,900
males taking on the persona of inner 
city black gang members.

521
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,540
You know,
but,

522
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:13,450
but I'm sympathetic to it because 
there's an aggressiveness to that,

523
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,583
to that art form that's a necessary 
corrective to the insistence that the 

524
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:22,930
highest moral virtue for a modern man is
harmlessness,

525
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:26,620
which is observed.
Women don't even like harmless man.

526
00:29:26,621 --> 00:29:28,280
They hate them.
They liked that.

527
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,750
No.
What women

528
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:38,750
want are dangerous men who are civilized
and they want to help civilize them.

529
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,140
That's beauty and the beast.

530
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:43,341
So,
you know,

531
00:29:43,341 --> 00:29:44,174
I'll tell you a funny story and only 
engineers could have come up with this 

532
00:29:46,461 --> 00:29:47,294
because they are the only ones that have
the unparalleled blindness to social 

533
00:29:51,351 --> 00:29:53,480
convention that would allow them to 
discover it.

534
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,583
So the Google engineers,
I like engineers by the way because 

535
00:29:56,811 --> 00:29:59,840
they're very straightforward.
The Google engineers wrote a book awhile

536
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:04,340
back called a billion wicked thoughts,
which was a study of Internet searches,

537
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,263
billions of them literally,
and they were looking a lot of 

538
00:30:07,161 --> 00:30:07,994
pornography use.
And while there's lots of known about 

539
00:30:09,651 --> 00:30:12,530
male pornography use,
partly and it's easy to understand.

540
00:30:12,531 --> 00:30:13,364
I mean males are pretty visually 
oriented in what attracts them to 

541
00:30:17,091 --> 00:30:17,924
pornography is fairly straightforward.
You can tell that if you look at 

542
00:30:21,561 --> 00:30:22,394
graffiti and a men's washroom,
you know it's like two circles and the 

543
00:30:25,521 --> 00:30:28,280
triangle and the men are absolutely 
transfixed.

544
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,993
Bye

545
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:47,180
For women in the story is more complex.
They use pornography too,

546
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:48,014
but it tends to be literary because 
women tend to like words more than they 

547
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,014
like visual stimuli.
And so the Google guys tried to track 

548
00:30:53,331 --> 00:30:54,164
down the architectural structure of how 
they didn't use those words of female 

549
00:30:57,321 --> 00:30:58,154
pornography use.
And so some of you know how many of you 

550
00:31:00,981 --> 00:31:04,290
know what a Harlequin romance is.
Okay,

551
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,170
good.
So those are archetypal stories,

552
00:31:06,171 --> 00:31:08,150
right?
That's the taming of the wild man.

553
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,120
Essentially by the,
by the desirable in virgin a woman.

554
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:15,170
And if you think women don't want that,
then you better bloody well come up with

555
00:31:15,171 --> 00:31:18,290
an explanation for 50 shades of grey.
Right?

556
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,183
Which is the most,
the most rapid selling novel in human 

557
00:31:21,141 --> 00:31:24,380
history and,
and merged at exactly the same time that

558
00:31:24,381 --> 00:31:25,214
all of this noise about the lack of the 
absence of gender roles is being 

559
00:31:28,161 --> 00:31:29,530
produced on Mohs.

560
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:32,990
It's like perfect female fantasy.
It's exactly archetypally correct.

561
00:31:32,991 --> 00:31:33,824
It's beauty and the beast,
so what the dual guys showed was the 

562
00:31:37,311 --> 00:31:38,144
structure of beauty and the beast,
although they didn't use that as a 

563
00:31:39,681 --> 00:31:43,940
reference that the female pornographic 
fantasy was wild guy,

564
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,853
you know,
somewhat careless about the wants and 

565
00:31:47,301 --> 00:31:49,670
desires of others attractive to 
everyone.

566
00:31:49,671 --> 00:31:50,930
Therefore,
high status,

567
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:55,070
tamed by the magic of a single woman and
brought into a relationship with her.

568
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,061
Okay,
so,

569
00:31:56,061 --> 00:31:58,490
but here's the comical part.
This just made me laugh,

570
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,353
man.
It was like,

571
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:00,283
what were the five categories of most 
desirable male entity used most broadly 

572
00:32:05,031 --> 00:32:06,930
and female pornography.
Oh,

573
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,270
it's so embarrassing.
Women,

574
00:32:08,271 --> 00:32:13,271
you have to cover your head while I say 
this because Vampire Werewolf,

575
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:20,180
billionaire,
surgeon and pirate.

576
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,270
All right.
Another question.

577
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,313
Yes.

578
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,003
A,

579
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,423
I hear a lot

580
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:49,890
what you're saying.
I want to drag you back to Yelp,

581
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,773
right?

582
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,433
Yes.

583
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,480
What the
we have right now and now the core is to

584
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,223
believe in ethnic nationalism,
but not the sort of oppositional 

585
00:33:04,661 --> 00:33:09,030
nationalism that we all know.
It's more of a rag salt or,

586
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:14,310
or do gyn universal nationalism.
Do you think this core belief of the alt

587
00:33:14,631 --> 00:33:17,480
right is.
What is it logical?

588
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,740
Is it revenue?

589
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,583
Complete,
complete identification with the father 

590
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,593
and that's necessary,
but the purpose of identification with 

591
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:31,970
the father is to become the son,
right,

592
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:32,923
and I mean that in all of its symbolic 
manifestation and the problem with 

593
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:38,474
nationalism is that it forgets that it 
forgets that the purpose of the nation 

594
00:33:41,001 --> 00:33:44,230
is to give rise to the individual.
And so,

595
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:47,600
and what's happened now because our 
identities have become fragmented,

596
00:33:47,601 --> 00:33:51,980
is that there's a call to re constitute 
the father and that's.

597
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,080
And that's at the core of the alt right,
thinking.

598
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,810
Well that's the benevolent part of the 
alt right.

599
00:33:56,811 --> 00:33:59,500
I mean there's a downside.
There's a negative side to everything.

600
00:33:59,501 --> 00:34:00,334
I mean,
one of the things that's quite 

601
00:34:00,951 --> 00:34:03,240
disturbing about the alt right is it's 
pro click,

602
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:06,320
continual proclivity to degenerate into 
anti Semitism.

603
00:34:06,321 --> 00:34:08,390
And I see that in the comments,
for example,

604
00:34:08,391 --> 00:34:13,270
on my videos continually.
So it's oversimplified and there's a,

605
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,113
there's a terror,
there's also no true recognition or not 

606
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:18,224
sufficient recognition that the state is
also a pathological monster and the all 

607
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,833
right should understand that because of 
course that's what the left continually 

608
00:34:25,131 --> 00:34:26,180
claims,
right?

609
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,640
The state is a pathological monster.
Oh,

610
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,040
they're trying to produce.
Sorry,

611
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:31,640
this,
the left is trying to produce.

612
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:32,803
I got that wrong.
It's the basis of the alt right's 

613
00:34:35,361 --> 00:34:36,194
criticism of the left.
The old right says the left is trying 

614
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,553
always trying to expand the dominion of 
the state and the state is a 

615
00:34:42,321 --> 00:34:43,154
pathological monster.
Yet what we should do is become 

616
00:34:45,051 --> 00:34:46,430
nationalists.
So like,

617
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,890
sorry guys,
there's a bit of a paradox there.

618
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,780
And uh,
well,

619
00:34:50,781 --> 00:34:51,614
so,
so that's basically what I would say 

620
00:34:53,151 --> 00:34:55,290
about that.
It's not surprising and,

621
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,670
and as long as the radical left keeps 
pushing the way they keep pushing,

622
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,620
then all right is going to continue to 
grow.

623
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:01,603
Although it's very also very difficult 
to tell at now to what degree to how 

624
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:09,380
large the movement is or how serious it 
is or any of those things at the moment.

625
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,543
So,

626
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:14,080
so just to bring you back to cultural 
appropriation,

627
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:15,483
is it possible that that plus about half
a dozen other similar things that 

628
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:19,963
appeared in the last 10 years rather 
than be kind of like an empty or or 

629
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:25,683
ridiculous baseless philosophy are in 
fact tactical tactical constructs by 

630
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:31,923
postmodernist and in March there's think
tanks we evidence for that would be in 

631
00:35:35,741 --> 00:35:38,700
the fact that they are always 
selectively

632
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:43,700
enforced in a way which is the most 
destructive possible to our occurrences.

633
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,030
So,
so that's,

634
00:35:45,031 --> 00:35:46,440
uh,
that,

635
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:48,630
that kind of opens the broader question 
of,

636
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:51,810
of conspiratorial action among political
groups,

637
00:35:51,811 --> 00:35:54,090
let's say.
So here's a way of thinking about it.

638
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:58,950
And I think this works.
So in any coherent philosophy,

639
00:35:58,951 --> 00:35:59,784
there's an impetus to action.
That's partly what makes the philosophy 

640
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:03,384
coherent.
And postmodernism is a coherent 

641
00:36:05,491 --> 00:36:07,350
philosophy.
It has an impetus to action.

642
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,513
Now it's very difficult to describe the 
entire structure of postmodernism 

643
00:36:13,561 --> 00:36:16,320
because it's fuzzy at the edges.
It bleeds into other things.

644
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,030
But imagine that there's a,
there's a core of,

645
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,473
there's a core of central concerns.
Now imagine that most people who are 

646
00:36:23,401 --> 00:36:27,600
normally postmodernists only understand 
fragments of that core concern,

647
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:33,170
and so if you take the typical 
indoctrinated social justice warrior,

648
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,690
Third Year Women's studies student,
you might say,

649
00:36:36,691 --> 00:36:37,524
well,
she's only 15 percent postmodernist and 

650
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:45,570
85 percent still human,
so but if you get,

651
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,080
if you get 10 people like that together,
20 people like that together,

652
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,813
each,
there's enough of the postmodernist 

653
00:36:52,531 --> 00:36:53,364
doctrine that fills the room because 
it's fragmented into different people 

654
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:02,030
that you have a coherent spirit that 
animates the group and it will act as if

655
00:37:02,581 --> 00:37:03,414
it has the intelligence of the 
philosophy and it will manifest itself 

656
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:08,280
as if it's conspiratorial.

657
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,443
Now there are elements that are also 
conspiratorial because people do things 

658
00:37:12,241 --> 00:37:15,200
consciously as well,
but you should always assume,

659
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,810
assume stupidity before you assume 
organized malevolence.

660
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,690
Right?
Right.

661
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:24,563
It keeps you.
It keeps your thinking player because 

662
00:37:26,701 --> 00:37:27,534
it's like.
It's not like there's no such thing as 

663
00:37:29,311 --> 00:37:30,144
organized malevolence,
but it's rare and it requires a lot of 

664
00:37:32,941 --> 00:37:33,774
skill.
Whereas sort of distributed stupidity 

665
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,360
that can act conspiratorially without 
having to have a central agent.

666
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:43,920
And so look there first and then and 
only with great evidence,

667
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,710
make the next set of presuppositions.
So

668
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:03,040
I first found out about you on which
uses it

669
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:11,890
for that
reason,

670
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,460
people feel like they can say anything,
something,

671
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:22,510
maybe something is lost because on 
facebook when your reputation is tied to

672
00:38:22,971 --> 00:38:25,760
all the opinions that you feel like you 
might want to test out,

673
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,680
but on,
on a place where it's anonymous,

674
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:28,723
it's not,
it's dark and you have an international 

675
00:38:30,771 --> 00:38:32,030
appeal.
You have this,

676
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,143
uh,
if I started at Jordan Peterson spread 

677
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:35,853
within five minutes,
I've got people from 10 different 

678
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:38,404
countries or countries that aren't,
don't have English as their main 

679
00:38:42,311 --> 00:38:44,410
language are joining in and talking 
about,

680
00:38:44,411 --> 00:38:47,290
you know,
the man who yells out the emperor has no

681
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:48,124
clothes.
I know we talked about how archetypes 

682
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:54,490
seems to manifest.
What are you at

683
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:02,910
that is actually not me,
it's my wife

684
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:06,230
because she knows what I am and you 
know,

685
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:08,870
it's not,
it's not all that great,

686
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,713
but all things considered

687
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,830
architectural point of view,
what has manifested?

688
00:39:14,831 --> 00:39:16,600
What are you in embodying?
That seems to.

689
00:39:16,601 --> 00:39:17,434
I mean,
we don't need to see your real ugly 

690
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:19,174
face,

691
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,640
Jesus,
right?

692
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,250
I told you the story at the beginning of
the lecture.

693
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:43,610
I've been trying to solve a problem and 
I really done everything I can to try to

694
00:39:44,311 --> 00:39:45,144
solve that problem and I've been talking
about what I learned and who I learned 

695
00:39:49,441 --> 00:39:51,030
it from for 30 years,
you know,

696
00:39:51,031 --> 00:39:54,930
and that's had a positive impact as far 
as I can tell them,

697
00:39:54,931 --> 00:39:59,750
the people to whom I've taught it and so
I,

698
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,750
I'm someone who's tried to solve the 
hardest problem that he could find.

699
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,460
That's,
that's all.

700
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:10,630
Thank you.

701
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,250
Do you think individuals today should 
have a,

702
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,133
a viewed relationship with religion and 
God to kind of rebuild the moral 

703
00:40:21,661 --> 00:40:23,940
authority that's been lost?

704
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,500
Absolutely.
Yeah.

705
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:27,523
I think the question was,
do I think that modern people should 

706
00:40:29,681 --> 00:40:32,200
have a renewed relationship with 
religion and God?

707
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,011
It's like,
yes,

708
00:40:33,011 --> 00:40:35,440
absolutely.
But it has to be predicated on,

709
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,170
on higher consciousness,
so to speak,

710
00:40:38,171 --> 00:40:39,970
and I mean that.
I mean that very technically.

711
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:41,963
So this is what happened.
This is how our religious systems 

712
00:40:44,051 --> 00:40:46,870
developed.
I'll give you the very brief version.

713
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:50,710
So if you look at the structure of a 
chimpanzee troop or a wolf pack,

714
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:51,963
there's an ethic and there has to be 
because otherwise the wolves would tear 

715
00:40:54,641 --> 00:40:56,680
each other apart and so with the 
chimpanzees.

716
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:57,523
So the chimpanzees in their,
in their dominance hierarchy structure 

717
00:41:00,871 --> 00:41:04,840
is learn how to act out a society just 
like the wool stoop.

718
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:05,823
So here's a rule for a wolf.
Wolfej wants to be top dog and wolf be 

719
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,560
wants to be top dog.
And so they,

720
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,553
they snarl at each other and they puff 
out their funnel and they look big and 

721
00:41:14,441 --> 00:41:16,720
ferocious and they turned sideways to 
scare each other.

722
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,450
And then one of them chickens out,
rolls over and shows his neck.

723
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,810
And basically that is the acting out of,
well,

724
00:41:22,811 --> 00:41:23,644
I'm a useless applicant and you know,
your majesty can do what he will with 

725
00:41:27,341 --> 00:41:30,040
me.
And then the proper wolf king says,

726
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:30,874
yeah,
well I might need your useless carcass 

727
00:41:32,651 --> 00:41:36,020
to hold down a moose tomorrow so I 
couldn't tear out your throat,

728
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:36,854
but I won't.
And then they both get up and go along 

729
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:39,614
in the pack.
And so the reason I'm telling you that 

730
00:41:40,701 --> 00:41:43,580
is because there's an ethic there.
Here's another ethic among animals.

731
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,480
So if you,
if you take juvenile male rats,

732
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,093
they need to play,
they need to engage in rough and tumble 

733
00:41:51,291 --> 00:41:54,260
play or they develop attention deficit 
disorder by the way,

734
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,183
which is quite interesting and something
to think about for your little rats in 

735
00:41:58,281 --> 00:42:00,770
school that are developing attention 
deficit disorder.

736
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:03,440
So if you,
if you,

737
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:07,010
if you take a juvenile rat and he knows 
he's going to be able to go into a space

738
00:42:07,011 --> 00:42:07,844
where he can play,
he'll work to open a door to enter that 

739
00:42:09,501 --> 00:42:10,334
space.
So that's how you know he's motivated 

740
00:42:11,241 --> 00:42:14,270
because you can't ask them because you 
can't speak rat and neither can he eat.

741
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,373
So you let go in the play space and 
you'll add another rat go in there of 

742
00:42:18,401 --> 00:42:19,234
about the same age.
And imagine one rats 10 percent bigger 

743
00:42:21,141 --> 00:42:21,974
than the other.
So what happens first is the rats 

744
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:25,790
wrestle.
It's not aggressive.

745
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:29,990
They wrestled just like worldwide 
wrestling federation guys wrestle,

746
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,140
you know,
and,

747
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:32,063
and for many of the same reasons,
and the rats will pin each other and if 

748
00:42:34,491 --> 00:42:35,324
you pin the other rat you went.
So if you're 10 percent bigger than the 

749
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,720
little rat,
then you can always pin them.

750
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,200
You can always win.
Okay.

751
00:42:42,201 --> 00:42:43,034
So then what happens is the big rap 
becomes dominant and the little rat 

752
00:42:45,201 --> 00:42:46,034
becomes subordinate.
They have a wrestling match and then 

753
00:42:47,091 --> 00:42:51,170
they part the next time they meet 
because it's an iterated game,

754
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,980
the next time they meet the little ride 
has to ask the big role to play.

755
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:58,430
And he does that the same way that you 
ask a child to play,

756
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,264
you know,
you do your play stance just like a dog 

757
00:43:01,491 --> 00:43:03,590
does.
You can understand when a dog does that.

758
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,080
And so the little rat,
you know,

759
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:08,600
gets playful with the big rat and then 
they play.

760
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:09,763
But if you pair them repeatedly,
the big grand house to let the little 

761
00:43:11,871 --> 00:43:12,704
rat win at least 30 percent of the time 
or the little rat won't invite them to 

762
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:18,200
play anymore.
It's right.

763
00:43:18,201 --> 00:43:19,550
That's cool.
That's so cool.

764
00:43:19,551 --> 00:43:20,450
Man.
Jack Yak,

765
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,750
Yak Panksepp discovered that he also 
discovered that if you tickled rats,

766
00:43:23,751 --> 00:43:26,060
they giggle,
but they do it ultrasonically,

767
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:28,910
so you have to.
You have to like that.

768
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,940
So he discovered the play circuit.
It's a major,

769
00:43:31,941 --> 00:43:35,320
major neuroscience discovery,
and so there's an emergent ethic.

770
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:39,740
Can play a fair play ethic.
And now hale,

771
00:43:39,741 --> 00:43:41,210
I can't remember what your question was.

772
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:46,731
Oh yes.
Okay.

773
00:43:46,731 --> 00:43:47,271
So,
so,

774
00:43:47,271 --> 00:43:48,104
so what happens is,
is that that there is an ethic that 

775
00:43:51,141 --> 00:43:51,974
emerges out of social interaction,
but then because human beings are 

776
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:58,220
conscious,
we watched that ethic emerge and then we

777
00:43:58,221 --> 00:43:59,054
start telling stories about it.
We tell stories about the honorable 

778
00:44:01,251 --> 00:44:05,120
person and the honorable person who 
doesn't just win today's game,

779
00:44:05,121 --> 00:44:05,954
but when's it in a way that makes 
everyone invite them to play games 

780
00:44:08,031 --> 00:44:09,680
infinitely into the future.
Right?

781
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:10,514
So that makes you the Metta player.
That's what you're trying to be your 

782
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:14,133
all.
And that's the hero who goes into the 

783
00:44:14,901 --> 00:44:15,740
unknown,
right?

784
00:44:15,741 --> 00:44:19,010
It's the person who acts in proper 
interactions with other people.

785
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,900
It's,
it's truly an emergent.

786
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:23,360
It's an emergent ethic.
It's real.

787
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:24,194
It's more real than anything else.
We map that and that's somehow 

788
00:44:26,391 --> 00:44:28,610
associated with our consciousness,
well,

789
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:29,623
we need to understand these sorts of 
things in order to put a biological 

790
00:44:32,191 --> 00:44:33,024
structure underneath our religious 
thinking again and to tie it into our 

791
00:44:36,271 --> 00:44:37,104
scientific knowledge and to become awake
and aware of these sorts of things so 

792
00:44:40,021 --> 00:44:40,854
that we can reestablish the foundation 
underneath our culture and it's a 

793
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:47,940
terrifying thing to do because it does 
place a burden on people.

794
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:48,773
Right,
but you want to burden you and it's so 

795
00:44:50,401 --> 00:44:51,234
interesting.
It's really one of the things that's so 

796
00:44:53,251 --> 00:44:55,950
cool about what's been happening.
I don't understand this.

797
00:44:56,410 --> 00:45:00,450
I commented on this at the University of
Toronto debate.

798
00:45:00,451 --> 00:45:04,230
The first thing I did which was 
unexpected to me and everyone else.

799
00:45:04,231 --> 00:45:05,400
They didn't know what the Hell I was 
doing.

800
00:45:05,401 --> 00:45:06,340
As I said,
I looked around,

801
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:06,781
I said,
hey,

802
00:45:06,781 --> 00:45:07,614
you know,
80 percent of the people in this room 

803
00:45:09,151 --> 00:45:10,470
are men.
It's like,

804
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:11,693
why is that something's going on here 
and it's an indication that men and 

805
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,860
women have different interests.
Ninety one percent of my viewers of man,

806
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,020
what the hell?
Why is that?

807
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:19,883
Look at this room.
It's almost all men and men don't come 

808
00:45:23,131 --> 00:45:25,080
to these sorts of things generally 
speaking,

809
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:26,243
right?
Maybe because they're stubborn and 

810
00:45:26,971 --> 00:45:27,990
ornery,
but,

811
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:32,380
but so there's also something 
specifically in this for men and,

812
00:45:32,381 --> 00:45:33,390
and by,
by,

813
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:35,400
by implication for women because what do
you want?

814
00:45:35,401 --> 00:45:36,420
Useless man.
No,

815
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,760
you don't want useless man,
that's for sure.

816
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:42,450
Although if you have a useless man,
you get to dominate him.

817
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:44,173
And so maybe that's not such a big price
to pay for having someone around that 

818
00:45:46,681 --> 00:45:49,910
you can treat like an infant.
So that's the downside of the,

819
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:50,773
of the war between men and women,
but a woman with any sense once a man 

820
00:45:53,731 --> 00:45:58,230
who's dangerous but team.
So maybe that's part of.

821
00:45:58,770 --> 00:45:59,550
Well we'll leave it

822
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:04,550
that
characterize your classroom

823
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:14,600
occupying this space of the cognitive,
a general he will say,

824
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,273
I just want to know if you can 
substantiate the fact that there is a 

825
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:22,803
extraordinary diverse range of 
disciplines which required different 

826
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,130
kinds of skills,
uh,

827
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:28,283
in the university.
Also with the kind of confounding 

828
00:46:31,051 --> 00:46:31,884
variable that the university has made 
may not be considered by some people to 

829
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:37,044
be the most exclusively.
The exclusion was once was as a as a 

830
00:46:41,761 --> 00:46:43,570
representation of the enlightened.

831
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:45,390
Okay.
Well I can talk.

832
00:46:45,391 --> 00:46:47,990
Let me talk about the situation at the 
Ivy League universities.

833
00:46:47,991 --> 00:46:51,560
First,
the question broadly speaking covers the

834
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,513
other question about intelligence and 
about its diverse manifestations and 

835
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:56,503
about its role in selection for 
universities to go back and look at the 

836
00:47:00,921 --> 00:47:03,500
records at Harvard for example,
in the early 19 sixties,

837
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:06,790
the typical icu at for a Harvard student
was about 100,

838
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:09,590
five to 110,
not much above average,

839
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,170
but that's because they were finishing 
schools for the,

840
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,210
for the rich,
roughly speaking,

841
00:47:14,211 --> 00:47:17,570
and you know your.
If you had a rich father and he made his

842
00:47:17,571 --> 00:47:18,404
money,
he was probably well above average in 

843
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:23,510
intelligence,
but if you are his offspring,

844
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:24,703
there's regression towards the mean.
So there's no reason to assume that by 

845
00:47:27,141 --> 00:47:30,760
nature of your position you are going to
be particularly intelligent anyways.

846
00:47:30,761 --> 00:47:35,370
The average Ivy League student wasn't,
was bright but not outstanding.

847
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,650
So now it's like 100 Iq,
145,

848
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:41,200
three standard deviations above the mean
because.

849
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:42,083
And the reason for that is because 
they're selected by the sat scholastic 

850
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,350
aptitude test.
It's an Iq test.

851
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,960
They won't say it's an Iq test,
but that doesn't matter.

852
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:52,540
It isn't tech,
it's an Iq test.

853
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,313
It's a simple as that.
Any any task that contains a 

854
00:47:58,571 --> 00:47:59,404
sufficiently diverse range of problem 
solving questions that's rank ordered 

855
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:05,770
in,
in,

856
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:10,090
in accuracy among people is an Iq test.
The correlations like point eight,

857
00:48:10,091 --> 00:48:12,880
five.
So and what has happened,

858
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:16,300
there's two things that have happened.
I mean the Ivy Leagues have got more and

859
00:48:16,301 --> 00:48:20,050
more selective because they can and so 
the average Iq of their students is just

860
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:24,370
continued to move upwards and then the 
average Iq of the population is actually

861
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:27,010
increased to a substantive degree to 
over the last 50 years.

862
00:48:27,011 --> 00:48:27,844
Partly because partly perhaps mostly 
because of improved nutrition and and 

863
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,280
information exposure along among the.

864
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,660
Like the more deprived members of the 
culture.

865
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:42,310
It's better to watch tv than to sit 
alone in your crib for example,

866
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:44,770
and isolated and people have enough food
now.

867
00:48:44,771 --> 00:48:45,604
So the really low end of the 
intelligence spectrum is being 

868
00:48:47,771 --> 00:48:48,604
truncated.
And the general population Iq is 

869
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:55,210
increased.
So with regards to institutions like the

870
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:57,100
University of Toronto,
say they average Iq at the University of

871
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,940
Toronto was somewhere between 120 130 
and we know that because we've tested it

872
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:02,223
and it's not surprising because you're 
basically selected for cognitive 

873
00:49:04,301 --> 00:49:05,111
prowess,
right?

874
00:49:05,111 --> 00:49:07,870
Because grades are rough marker of 
intelligence.

875
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:08,793
Conscientiousness,
by the way also matters independent 

876
00:49:10,931 --> 00:49:11,764
trade because the best two predictors of
university grades are conscientiousness 

877
00:49:14,741 --> 00:49:17,260
and intelligence,
not creativity by the way.

878
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,070
Zero correlation with creativity.
So yes.

879
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:28,400
Comments on this free.
How is committing suicide?

880
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:32,560
Why is that happening?
Guilt,

881
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:36,450
yes.
What you want?

882
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:40,903
Yeah.
There's lots for people to be guilty 

883
00:49:41,841 --> 00:49:42,720
about.
You know,

884
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:43,563
I mean you might say,
to what degree should you bear the 

885
00:49:45,741 --> 00:49:49,480
horrendous guilt of your ancestors?
And that's a.

886
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:51,320
that's a really hard question.
I mean,

887
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:52,793
the radical left answer would be to the 
degree that you're privileged by your 

888
00:49:55,611 --> 00:49:57,380
ancestry,
you should bear their guilt.

889
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:00,980
Well,
Robo,

890
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:03,620
yes.
The question is then what you do?

891
00:50:03,621 --> 00:50:04,940
Well,
what you should do is,

892
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,073
what I suggested today,
I would say is take responsibility for 

893
00:50:08,301 --> 00:50:09,134
your lives and understand that what you 
have came at a terrible cost and that 

894
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:17,180
you have an ethical obligation to use it
properly and that would be sufficient to

895
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:19,850
pay for the sins of your ancestors,
so to speak.

896
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:25,060
I think it's absolutely reprehensible 
that the radical left dares to attribute

897
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:31,190
to to ethnically identified groups,
collective guilt.

898
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:33,680
There's absolutely no excuse for that.

899
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,520
It's completely murderous and that 
should be rejected out of hand.

900
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,073
So,
but that's independent of the issue 

901
00:50:40,461 --> 00:50:41,294
about what you should do given that part
of your wealth is a consequence of 

902
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:47,053
historical catastrophe.
So you should try to sort that out 

903
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:52,430
roughly speaking and for everyone's 
benefit,

904
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:56,060
but not necessarily because you're any 
more guilty personally.

905
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,120
You're guilty as hell personally,
but so is everyone else.

906
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,510
That's the critical thing.
So is everyone else okay?

907
00:51:02,511 --> 00:51:04,610
I would.
I would like to answer that question,

908
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,190
but I can't.
And the reason,

909
00:51:07,191 --> 00:51:09,650
there's two reasons for that.
One is that it's,

910
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:10,993
there's,
there's a large element of the answer 

911
00:51:12,291 --> 00:51:15,560
that has to be legal and I can't do 
that,

912
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:16,783
and the other part of it is because I've
actually too tired to formulate a 

913
00:51:19,221 --> 00:51:24,170
coherent response to that and I don't 
want it formulated incoherent response.

914
00:51:24,171 --> 00:51:28,370
So I'm sorry that I can't be.
I mean obviously I believe that people's

915
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:32,600
right to communicate should be as 
untrammeled as possible,

916
00:51:32,601 --> 00:51:37,220
but to bridge the gap between that and 
your specific concern requires a feat of

917
00:51:37,221 --> 00:51:38,054
mental energy that I can't do at the 
moment and maybe maybe ever that at the 

918
00:51:41,991 --> 00:51:42,824
back.

919
00:51:56,550 --> 00:52:01,480
The
social construct of a safe space that

920
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:08,730
our view on this whole white privilege 
thing.

921
00:52:08,731 --> 00:52:13,731
Is that university,
all these other universities?

922
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:16,443
No,
I think the idea of white privilege is 

923
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:21,340
absolutely reprehensible and it's not 
because white people aren't.

924
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,190
You know,
we have all sorts of privileges and most

925
00:52:26,191 --> 00:52:27,024
people have privileges of all sorts and 
you should be grateful for your 

926
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:31,410
privileges and work to deserve them,
I would say.

927
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:36,890
But the idea that you can target an 
ethnic group with a collective crime,

928
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:38,123
regardless of the specific innocence or 
guilt of the constituent elements of 

929
00:52:41,371 --> 00:52:42,204
that group,
there is absolutely nothing that's more 

930
00:52:43,951 --> 00:52:46,750
racist than that.
It's absolutely a boring.

931
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:47,603
I can't

932
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:53,390
thank you.

933
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:55,453
If you,
if you really want to know more about 

934
00:52:56,481 --> 00:52:59,150
that sort of thing,
you should read about the Kulaks in the,

935
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:01,460
in the Soviet Union in the 19 twenties,
k,

936
00:53:01,461 --> 00:53:02,630
u l a,
k,

937
00:53:02,631 --> 00:53:03,464
s because they were.
They were farmers who were very 

938
00:53:05,571 --> 00:53:08,390
productive.
They were the most productive element of

939
00:53:08,391 --> 00:53:11,120
the agricultural strata in,
in Russia.

940
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,433
And they were virtually all killed or 
raped and robbed by the collectivists 

941
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,930
who insisted that because they showed 
signs of wealth,

942
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:22,030
they were criminals.
And,

943
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,210
and,
and,

944
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:24,173
and,
and,

945
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:26,520
and Roberts.
So.

946
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:27,953
And one of the consequences of the 
prosecution of the Kulaks was the death 

947
00:53:30,691 --> 00:53:33,600
of 6 million Ukrainians from a famine in
the 19 thirties.

948
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:34,613
The idea of collectively held guilt at 
the level of the individual as a legal 

949
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,013
or philosophical principle is dangerous.
It's precisely this sort of danger that 

950
00:53:45,031 --> 00:53:48,300
people who are really looking for 
trouble would push.

951
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:49,600
So,
and,

952
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:50,433
and just a cursory glance at 20th 
century history should teach anyone who 

953
00:53:53,491 --> 00:53:58,491
wants to know exactly how,
how unacceptable that is with regards to

954
00:53:58,771 --> 00:54:00,270
your first,
okay,

955
00:54:00,271 --> 00:54:02,850
there's the safe space issue,
but you also said something right at the

956
00:54:02,851 --> 00:54:03,710
beginning,
you,

957
00:54:03,711 --> 00:54:04,544
you,
you announced your sexual preference at 

958
00:54:06,661 --> 00:54:08,730
the beginning and I understand exactly 
why you did that,

959
00:54:08,731 --> 00:54:09,564
but I have a comment about that and this
is something for people in the audience 

960
00:54:12,841 --> 00:54:13,674
to think about.
I've received at least 25 letters from 

961
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:18,083
transsexual people and that's quite a 
few because there aren't that many 

962
00:54:19,981 --> 00:54:21,210
transsexual people,
right?

963
00:54:21,211 --> 00:54:22,620
So,
so they're rare.

964
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:25,590
They're very rare and every single one 
of them.

965
00:54:25,591 --> 00:54:26,424
But one was supportive and the one that 
wasn't supportive was mildly critical 

966
00:54:29,821 --> 00:54:32,280
and they said exactly the same thing 
that you said.

967
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:33,780
Rough.
Roughly speaking is that.

968
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:36,000
And so what we.
One of the things we want to remember is

969
00:54:36,001 --> 00:54:39,870
that just because some some noisy 
activists stand up and say,

970
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:44,280
because I'm a member of this group,
or even worse because I say I'm a member

971
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,114
of this group,
I am therefore an advocate for that 

972
00:54:47,491 --> 00:54:50,580
group's interests is we should just 
dispense with that,

973
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:51,813
um,
with that self identification as a 

974
00:54:54,811 --> 00:54:59,670
worthy representative instantaneously 
because it's predicated on the idea that

975
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:04,700
one dimension of a person's identity is 
sufficiently what would you say,

976
00:55:06,271 --> 00:55:11,271
broad and all encompassing so that you 
can infer their political stance,

977
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:13,680
for example,
which you can't.

978
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:16,410
And so the,
the Trans people that have written me,

979
00:55:16,411 --> 00:55:18,090
they all say the same thing.
A,

980
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,790
those people do not speak for me.
B,

981
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,040
we're not all the same.
See,

982
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:24,053
most of us think that the enforced 
pronoun issue is doing nothing but 

983
00:55:27,271 --> 00:55:30,660
drawing negative attention to us.
D,

984
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:34,710
most of us just want to be referred to 
by the other Pronoun.

985
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,330
That's the whole point.

986
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:43,130
So thank you.
So

987
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:47,960
this has been very,
very reassuring to me because one of the

988
00:55:47,961 --> 00:55:48,794
things I presume right from the onset 
was that there was no evidence 

989
00:55:51,531 --> 00:55:52,364
whatsoever that this nonsensical,
logical legislation and the postmodern 

990
00:55:55,341 --> 00:55:56,174
idiocy behind it is in fact demanded by 
this community or that it will in any 

991
00:56:01,611 --> 00:56:04,370
way be in anyone's best interest.
No,

992
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:07,240
I don't buy it.
I think it's rotten,

993
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:10,490
right to the core.
So then the safe,

994
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:13,970
safe space issue.
It's like if you need a safe space,

995
00:56:13,971 --> 00:56:16,580
see a therapist.
Really,

996
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:20,870
really university university is not a 
safe space.

997
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:24,340
If University has done right,
it is a radically space.

998
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:25,323
If you want to go somewhere and get 
yourself taken apart intellectually and 

999
00:56:29,051 --> 00:56:32,260
then hopefully put back together,
then you go to university.

1000
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,650
Everything you believe should be 
challenged in every possible way,

1001
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:37,630
but not in a destructive sense.
Right?

1002
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:41,200
Like when you're renovating a house,
you don't just burn it to the ground and

1003
00:56:41,201 --> 00:56:42,034
walk away,
but that's what the postmodernists due 

1004
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,220
to adolescence,
by the way,

1005
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:50,080
you dismantle it in consultation with 
its occupant,

1006
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:54,170
attempting to build something even more 
beautiful and functional on the.

1007
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:56,890
On the foundation.
It's not a safe space,

1008
00:56:56,891 --> 00:56:58,150
you know,
in my classes,

1009
00:56:58,151 --> 00:57:00,550
and I tell my students this right at the
beginning,

1010
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,890
I'm trying to get them to understand why
they are Nazis,

1011
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:07,623
right?
There isn't anything more unsafe than 

1012
00:57:09,611 --> 00:57:11,470
that.
And all of them,

1013
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:14,870
virtually all of them,
right back to me afterwards and say that

1014
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:15,903
this was the most worthwhile class I've 
ever had in my life and it changed my 

1015
00:57:18,581 --> 00:57:19,151
life.
It's like,

1016
00:57:19,151 --> 00:57:19,984
well,
I'm teaching you the worst possible 

1017
00:57:21,431 --> 00:57:24,250
thing about yourself and your response 
is,

1018
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:25,293
oh,
that was so useful and I'm way better 

1019
00:57:27,131 --> 00:57:28,330
than I was.
You know,

1020
00:57:28,331 --> 00:57:29,270
it's,
it's.

1021
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:30,183
But it's in keeping with the idea that 
you need to be exposed to things that 

1022
00:57:32,561 --> 00:57:35,740
you fear and hate because that's where 
salvation lies,

1023
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:38,350
roughly speaking.
So yes,

1024
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:40,760
uh,
you mentioned how humanity

1025
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:46,240
and also how the good we need to attain 
is essentially achieved through inactive

1026
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:47,143
faith.
We're just speaking the truth the best 

1027
00:57:47,781 --> 00:57:50,240
we can.
And what I've been thinking about is how

1028
00:57:50,241 --> 00:57:53,950
can we have competence in existence and 
the good of the logos?

1029
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:56,800
Is there anything to ground our 
competencies?

1030
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:57,933
That's a great question.
So what is there anything to ground our 

1031
00:58:00,251 --> 00:58:02,080
confidence in the logos?
Yeah,

1032
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:03,550
sure.
Two things.

1033
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:04,443
One,
the testimony of the ages to practical 

1034
00:58:08,681 --> 00:58:10,000
experience.
Try It,

1035
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:12,410
try it.
You know,

1036
00:58:12,430 --> 00:58:13,263
and what you,
you start by while doing what I 

1037
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:15,424
suggested earlier,
which is fixing the things around you 

1038
00:58:16,751 --> 00:58:20,800
that you can fix because that's like the
embodied manifestation of the logos.

1039
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:22,840
That's by the way why Christ was a 
carpenter,

1040
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:24,250
are continually speaking,
right?

1041
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:26,740
Because he fixed things.
So and you know,

1042
00:58:26,741 --> 00:58:29,080
if you're a bad carpenter,
the things you fix fall apart.

1043
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:30,123
So there's truth in being a carpenter,
but then the next thing is you probably 

1044
00:58:34,481 --> 00:58:36,610
can't speak the truth because no one 
can,

1045
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:37,893
but you cannot say things you know to be
lies and that's a really good place to 

1046
00:58:42,071 --> 00:58:43,290
start.
And all you know,

1047
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:45,670
you can learn to pay attention to that 
very rapidly.

1048
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,360
You kind of know already,
but you,

1049
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:50,260
it's a consultation with your embodied 
being.

1050
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:52,450
When you say something,
you know to be false,

1051
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:57,040
you won't be able to stand up straight.
You'll get week,

1052
00:58:57,041 --> 00:59:00,370
you'll feel a physical d division take 
place inside you.

1053
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:01,353
It's a shame because what you're not,
you're failing to bear the burden of 

1054
00:59:04,751 --> 00:59:08,470
your existence and you're revealing that
to yourself by your use of deceit.

1055
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:09,813
Stop saying things you know to be false 
and then watch what happens and this is 

1056
00:59:13,301 --> 00:59:16,990
the existential element of it.
It can't be proved as far as I can tell,

1057
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:19,480
the same way that you would prove a 
scientific hypothesis.

1058
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:20,613
It can only be proved in the confines of
your life and you actually have to 

1059
00:59:23,571 --> 00:59:24,404
sacrifice your life to the logos in 
order to find out because the only way 

1060
00:59:29,181 --> 00:59:31,400
you'll test it is by acting it out and 
see what happens.

1061
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,160
You don't get to do it twice.
So.

1062
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:39,170
But I think the consequences will reveal
themselves relatively quickly.

1063
00:59:39,171 --> 00:59:43,430
My experience has been that because I'm 
always working with my clients,

1064
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:46,790
I say clinical clients 20 hours a week 
roughly speaking,

1065
00:59:46,791 --> 00:59:51,410
and we're always working on stating 
things more clearly,

1066
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,600
trying to make things better,
you know,

1067
00:59:53,601 --> 00:59:54,434
and,
and it almost inevitably at least makes 

1068
00:59:57,290 --> 01:00:00,350
the horrible things bearable,
which is a lot better,

1069
01:00:00,351 --> 01:00:01,200
you know?
And,

1070
01:00:01,201 --> 01:00:06,201
and sometimes makes mediocre things way 
better as people's lives expand.

1071
01:00:06,471 --> 01:00:08,540
And they get more confident and,
and,

1072
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:10,880
and straightened things out around them.
So,

1073
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,313
so it's the testimony of the ages and 
your willingness to test and 

1074
01:00:14,571 --> 01:00:16,820
existentially in,
in the confines of your own life.

1075
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:21,050
You'll find that there isn't anything 
more interesting than you can do because

1076
01:00:21,051 --> 01:00:21,884
what it takes,
the predicted it takes the stultifying 

1077
01:00:25,101 --> 01:00:25,934
predictability out of your life.
You never know what will happen if you 

1078
01:00:28,881 --> 01:00:31,100
say something that's true,
it's a miracle.

1079
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:34,340
Miracles will happen.
And that's a very interesting.

1080
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:37,490
It's crazily interesting.
And so that's good.

1081
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,353
Crazily interesting.
You've got that to set to say that you 

1082
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:44,570
got that to set against tragedy and so 
well,

1083
01:00:44,571 --> 01:00:46,310
so you can try it.
