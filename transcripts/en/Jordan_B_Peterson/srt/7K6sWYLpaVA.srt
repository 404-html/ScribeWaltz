1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,223
Okay,
so I'm speaking with MFA and you may 

2
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:04,374
remember that Dr Jay had invited me 
awhile back to speak at Ryerson 

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,420
University on a Saturday and that's been
a rather popular youtube video and um,

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,260
he's been defending me and,
and making comments about free speech on

5
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:22,350
the Ontario Psychological Association 
listserv.

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,360
That's correct.
If I got the details right,

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,090
but maybe you could tell everybody 
what's been happening.

8
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:27,924
Okay,

9
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,331
sure.
So,

10
00:00:29,331 --> 00:00:30,320
uh,
back in November,

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,170
one of our members that will put out her
name,

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,440
but she wrote a piece where she 
basically,

13
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,000
I'll just say what I wrote,
um,

14
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,220
she basically said that,
um,

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,243
that you shouldn't have a forum for 
discussing what you were supposed to 

16
00:00:44,391 --> 00:00:45,224
discuss and that was the top of you.
We're going to have the University of 

17
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:48,733
Toronto,
the debate,

18
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,320
the debate.
Exactly.

19
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,220
And so she wrote a,
uh,

20
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,220
a piece,
um,

21
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:59,120
and put online and she posted it to the 
list serve and I essentially wrote in my

22
00:00:59,121 --> 00:00:59,954
email to the list or whatever.
I've written a number of comments about 

23
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:03,550
this.
Uh,

24
00:01:03,551 --> 00:01:05,930
and mostly I've been saying every time 
I'm,

25
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,870
one of your stories comes up or another 
similar story comes up,

26
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:10,280
I'm posting it,
they're saying,

27
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:11,960
look,
this is what's going on,

28
00:01:11,961 --> 00:01:12,794
this is not some mad ramblings.
This is a legitimate concern about 

29
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:20,840
ideology run amok.
And either I get met by silence or I get

30
00:01:20,841 --> 00:01:21,560
people,
you know,

31
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,230
ask me why I'm so angry or why I'm 
taking it so personally.

32
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,150
Or I get people emailing me back 
channel,

33
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,940
mostly older people,
most of the oldest psychologists who say

34
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:29,923
we support you completely over,
afraid to say anything because of the 

35
00:01:32,331 --> 00:01:33,164
consequences.

36
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,273
And what do you think they're.
What consequences do you think they're 

37
00:01:36,231 --> 00:01:37,064
afraid of

38
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,020
that?
I don't know.

39
00:01:39,021 --> 00:01:39,770
I mean,
I,

40
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,550
some of them work with these colleagues,
um,

41
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,393
others may be trying to get 
professorships or trying to get tenure 

42
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,123
and they were afraid that uh,
these people who do a hold positions in 

43
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,930
academia could hold them down.
I think that's the biggest,

44
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,143
it's a perverse effect of the tenure 
system because it tends to silence 

45
00:01:56,561 --> 00:01:57,394
people before they have tenure.
And so then of course they practice 

46
00:02:00,581 --> 00:02:03,130
being silent and by the time they do 
have tenure,

47
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,070
if you've practiced being silent for 
eight or 10 years,

48
00:02:06,071 --> 00:02:07,990
then,
or six years for that matter,

49
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,450
then it's going to be pretty hard to 
break that habit.

50
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,890
So,
so what,

51
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,130
so what are they objecting to with 
regards to your postings?

52
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,093
So whenever I post something,
it starts off pretty neutrally and I've 

53
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:22,950
written a long a message to the Ontario 
Psychological Association.

54
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:25,440
I sent it to the president.
I asked them to read it to them,

55
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,563
uh,
they are convening or they had convened 

56
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,780
a meeting,
uh,

57
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,990
to deal with this issue.
And,

58
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,010
um,
it was very,

59
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:33,300
very long.
And I said,

60
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,810
I have not actually done anything wrong.
I post links to stories such as yours,

61
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:41,811
like the last Friday one at mcmaster.
And then somebody goes one of two ways.

62
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:45,990
Either somebody will impugn my character
or my motives.

63
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,023
Uh,
recently somebody had implied that your 

64
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:50,304
message is full of hate.
They actually use that word and someone 

65
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:54,640
who has hate in his heart,
you know,

66
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,290
so and by extension myself or they will 
ask a question and I will address it,

67
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,900
but for the most part they're 
mischaracterizing what I'm stating.

68
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,510
And so I will simply say,
look,

69
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:06,400
I did not say that.
Show me where I said that.

70
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:09,070
And more often than not they're not 
picking on any specific issue.

71
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,670
It's just the,
the theme because on the Old Pa,

72
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:16,060
apparently if you're on one side of an 
issue it's okay.

73
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,790
If you occupy a different position they 
won't accept it.

74
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,100
And so what,
what do you think has is going to happen

75
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:22,934
and what have people,
like you said that they've convened in 

76
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,680
our so called emergency meeting about 
this issue.

77
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,550
And so do you have any idea why it's an 
emergency and,

78
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,990
and,
and what,

79
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,310
what they're planning to do?

80
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,293
Well,
I think they consider an emergency 

81
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:38,004
because I'm one of the board members.
She's the one who wrote that piece 

82
00:03:40,831 --> 00:03:42,240
saying that you shouldn't have this 
debate.

83
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,283
And I,
she took umbrage at a post that I wrote 

84
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,840
where she's from noisy.
And you know,

85
00:03:48,841 --> 00:03:50,430
I don't say this like they're not being 
facetious,

86
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,530
she doesn't always eat.
And another person from Boise

87
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,930
instituted this studies in education.
For those of you who don't know,

88
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,280
you might,
if you were feeling charitable,

89
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:02,460
you would recall it regardless as 
ideologically possessed.

90
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,670
Right?
Right.

91
00:04:04,671 --> 00:04:05,504
So,
um,

92
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,363
so she's from and she's the one who 
wrote the piece and then somebody else 

93
00:04:08,391 --> 00:04:10,590
will always.
He wrote what anybody,

94
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,060
any reasonable person would say.
It was a,

95
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:14,150
um,
a fair comment,

96
00:04:14,151 --> 00:04:15,800
which is basically trying to say,
look,

97
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,550
can we all just be a bit more polite in 
our tone,

98
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,393
more respectful.
And she listened to five points that we 

99
00:04:21,231 --> 00:04:23,510
should all aspire to,
which I don't disagree with,

100
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,920
but the problem is she's also from noisy
and there's a subtext to the message,

101
00:04:27,921 --> 00:04:30,710
which is basically this message is 
directed at me.

102
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,750
So what I did was I wrote,
and by the way,

103
00:04:32,751 --> 00:04:36,590
she posted this after the president had 
already shut down the discussion.

104
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,130
As soon as he shuts it down,
I really attract,

105
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,993
I'm not going to say anything but to 
other people put postings on and they 

106
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,610
directly,
uh,

107
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,640
you know,
basically,

108
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,390
like I said,
they,

109
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:50,870
they mischaracterize me and they looked 
me and tried to make me look bad.

110
00:04:50,871 --> 00:04:54,170
And so I spoke out and in one of my 
pieces I said to her,

111
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:55,730
if you really believe in what you're 
saying,

112
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,713
I said,
please make sure you apply this to the 

113
00:04:57,621 --> 00:05:01,130
people who are on the other side,
the ones we're calling to shut down this

114
00:05:01,131 --> 00:05:02,210
discussion.
I said,

115
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,053
you know,

116
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,920
the president of the OPA shut down the 
discussion.

117
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:08,740
What exactly does that mean?
How does he,

118
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,660
I believe,
how does he do that?

119
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,180
Why did he do it?

120
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,250
Well,
he sends out an email and says,

121
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,840
please,
this is getting a bit out of hand.

122
00:05:17,841 --> 00:05:20,450
Will you please not talk about this?
That's about the extent of it.

123
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,780
And reasonable people will refrain.
I shouldn't even say reasonable.

124
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,870
Let's say,
um,

125
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,100
people are trying not to cause conflict 
will,

126
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:28,880
we'll stop posting,
which I have done.

127
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,520
And their concern is,
I think that the tone gets out of hand.

128
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,200
And again,
I don't think there's any tone.

129
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,810
The worst she can say about my tone is 
it's blunt.

130
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,860
There's no name calling.
It's literally every single time I say,

131
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,820
show me where I said this,
you know,

132
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,651
or if you,
you know,

133
00:05:42,651 --> 00:05:46,400
you're mischaracterizing that.
Or I say your argument is irrational,

134
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,410
irrelevant.
Basically,

135
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,131
uh,
you know,

136
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:51,680
don't appeal to emotion.
We're dealing with facts here.

137
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,060
Let's deal with them.
And,

138
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,200
and you know,
and the team.

139
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,420
And

140
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:59,210
do you have any examples of this sort of
things that you've posted that you could

141
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,590
share with us?

142
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:02,630
Certainly.
So in one of the postings,

143
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,473
so this woman who again,
posting something that seemed 

144
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:05,760
reasonable,
um,

145
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,410
I basically said to her,
I said some,

146
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,180
I'll just read this,
a couple of paragraphs.

147
00:06:09,181 --> 00:06:11,370
Some members might find my direct 
rational,

148
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,204
logical and fact based fact based 
messages not only with respect to the 

149
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:16,104
issues themselves,
but also with respect to claims made by 

150
00:06:17,851 --> 00:06:19,890
those who disagree with me.
For instance,

151
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,903
when I respectfully state,
please show me where I said or did this 

152
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,770
to be rude,
offensive or inappropriate,

153
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,990
which to me is a gross misuse of such 
terms.

154
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,093
However,
some of those same people have directly 

155
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,460
stated or implied that I am a 
misogynist.

156
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,120
I transfer a big,
get,

157
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,120
hateful,
reprehensible,

158
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:37,043
unreasonable,
and unwilling or unable to engage in 

159
00:06:38,671 --> 00:06:39,504
respectful discourse.
The next step is where I got where 

160
00:06:42,031 --> 00:06:44,340
things got heated.
I said moreover,

161
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:45,200
and I mentioned the,
uh,

162
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:47,160
the colleague I alluded to a few minutes
ago.

163
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,313
I'm explicitly stated on this with a 
survey in November that she did not 

164
00:06:50,671 --> 00:06:51,504
believe that Jordan Peterson should have
been given a forum to discuss what any 

165
00:06:54,571 --> 00:06:58,170
reasonable person would agree is far 
from an unequivocal issue.

166
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,543
She posted a link.
I posted it to an online article she co 

167
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,540
wrote,
and this is critical,

168
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,603
uh,
that stated her reasons for what most 

169
00:07:05,761 --> 00:07:06,594
objective people should find a 
concerning call for censorship of not 

170
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:10,044
only non hateful ideas,
but also scientific investigation and 

171
00:07:13,081 --> 00:07:13,914
discussion as well as civil debate about
poorly conceptualizing worded 

172
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,180
legislation that could potentially cause
unforeseen harm.

173
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,733
I wrote that and her response was she 
actually posted a response and I hadn't 

174
00:07:27,121 --> 00:07:28,560
heard from her for quite some time and 
let me just read it.

175
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:29,394
She posted or an annotate.
I have just as much right to express my 

176
00:07:32,461 --> 00:07:35,910
opinion as anyone else.
I already put you on notice once,

177
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,280
but I will say it again.
Please leave me alone.

178
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,250
That's what I think led to the emergency
meeting and you know,

179
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,143
look at the context I have every right.
I have just as much right to express my 

180
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:48,890
opinion as anyone else.
I agree with that.

181
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,950
But why would she be calling for other 
people not to have that same?

182
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:53,840
Right?
They bought prosy is astounding.

183
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,520
And so Carolyn,

184
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,670
I really don't know.
They may ask me to,

185
00:07:59,671 --> 00:08:00,270
uh,
you know,

186
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,780
to leave the LPA.
They may ask me to leave the LISTSERV.

187
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,140
I'm one of the OPA strongest advocates.
I just,

188
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,053
you know,
every time I'm in the media I will 

189
00:08:08,131 --> 00:08:10,770
mention the work that they do.
They do a lot of excellent work,

190
00:08:10,771 --> 00:08:11,604
including the presence so that he's.
He's done excellent work for 

191
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:16,260
homelessness and for promoting 
psychology.

192
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,650
So the worst they can do is,
is try to pick me out.

193
00:08:19,651 --> 00:08:24,651
I know that this member in question was 
trying to enact something against me.

194
00:08:25,651 --> 00:08:26,310
So,
you know,

195
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,340
some sensor like more formal censure it,
it never happened.

196
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:30,460
Aside from a public review.

197
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,400
Precisely.
I mean,

198
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,860
you read some of the things that you've 
written.

199
00:08:36,861 --> 00:08:40,670
I mean,
why is it that you're being targeted?

200
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:42,380
Well,
first for an emergency meeting,

201
00:08:42,381 --> 00:08:45,260
which seems a bit like overkill,
but perhaps it isn't,

202
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,040
but what is it that they're,
what is it that they have on you?

203
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:53,090
So to speak that would result in 
centering of that sort?

204
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,290
They literally have nothing because I've
not called anybody names.

205
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,180
Um,
you know,

206
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,350
even when I called the a member 
immature,

207
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:02,184
I didn't name them at all.
So the worst they can say is the tone 

208
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,190
might become a bit hostile.
But this is what worries me.

209
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:08,940
I,
again,

210
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,620
I might be forceful,
I might be blunt,

211
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,450
I might be repetitive and verbose,
but I stick to the facts.

212
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:16,930
Uh,
and right.

213
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,023
And the problem is those facts are on 
the wrong side of their ideology and 

214
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:21,474
that's what's propelling them.
They can tell you them and the other 

215
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:26,970
thing is that,
so as I mentioned that he receives quote

216
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,870
unquote dozens of complaints from 
members who this is what is incredible,

217
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,450
who are basically saying that they do 
not want,

218
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,593
they can't tolerate the distress that 
comes along with knowing that I'm 

219
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:40,500
writing emails to the LISTSERV and that 
they might give up their membership.

220
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,590
This is a kind of issue that's going on 
and again,

221
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,513
if you look at my posts and I've written
to the OPA and every time someone 

222
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:48,720
criticizes me,
I specifically write,

223
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,590
show me one thing that I've written 
that's inappropriate or offensive.

224
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:57,640
No one's ever called and they can't and 
you have a record of all these postings.

225
00:09:57,641 --> 00:09:59,500
I presume I have them all.
Yes,

226
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,750
there.
Is there anything in them that you would

227
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:02,584
be.
I mean that you've written that you 

228
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:07,480
would be unwilling to make public,
assuming that you could get rid of names

229
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:08,314
and so on that might identify people.
Is there anything that would make you 

230
00:10:10,571 --> 00:10:12,490
uncomfortable about revealing publicly?

231
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,673
The only thing I'd be concerned about is
making sure that we're not violating 

232
00:10:16,661 --> 00:10:17,494
some ethical code,
which I guess would be portraying a 

233
00:10:20,711 --> 00:10:22,840
psychologist or a psychologist in a 
negative light.

234
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:25,930
Um,
I don't know if this qualifies as that.

235
00:10:25,931 --> 00:10:29,200
I think this is having an honest 
discussion about a personal.

236
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,600
You would only be,
I would suspect,

237
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:34,434
responsible for portraying psychology in
a negative light if your portrayal was 

238
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:42,450
unfounded from a factual perspective.
I would presume,

239
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:47,490
I mean
reasonable leeway in a,

240
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,500
in a,
in a policy of that sort.

241
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:52,350
Although the problem is those things are
subject to interpretation.

242
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,760
Right?
And that's my concern is,

243
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,860
is that interpretation I will seek legal
counsel.

244
00:10:59,861 --> 00:11:04,210
I don't know if our coverage applies to 
such a situation.

245
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,363
Um,
but I will ask the lawyers that we have 

246
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,690
insurance for and see if this would 
count as that.

247
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,640
I really don't.

248
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,810
What's happened to you,
if anything,

249
00:11:13,811 --> 00:11:17,080
as a consequence for hosting me at 
Ryerson.

250
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:19,420
I mean,
not a lot of attention.

251
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,300
The only consequence is that people have
been thanking me for being someone who's

252
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,373
standing out and saying you're standing 
up and saying we need to have this 

253
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:30,060
discussion.
Nothing so far.

254
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,053
Oh,
well that's good.

255
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,680
Yeah.
That's two.

256
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,660
Now the thing is,
um,

257
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,630
my next contract is coming due at 
Ryerson.

258
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:39,040
I'm cinema,
sessional lecturer.

259
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,220
I've been teaching it for 15 years.
Um,

260
00:11:41,221 --> 00:11:42,054
I always get the positions I applied for
it because I've taught so far off on a 

261
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:48,210
total of 160 courses at universities.
Excellent reviews.

262
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,730
And um,
if I find this term,

263
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:53,290
that's the first time ever that I don't 
get the positions I applied for,

264
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,680
that's the consequence we will find out.
I don't think that they would do that.

265
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,933
I think we have a pretty strong union,
but I don't have tenure as we were 

266
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:00,814
talking about.
I don't have a secure position and I've 

267
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:05,110
got a very busy clinical practice,
but to stop teaching,

268
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:08,350
to be not to be able to communicate with
students who want to learn,

269
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,333
who wanted to learn about critical 
thinking and being motivated to 

270
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:13,720
challenge ideas that be,
you know,

271
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:14,980
a horrible consequence.

272
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:15,571
Yeah.
Well,

273
00:12:15,571 --> 00:12:16,920
there's always youtube,
you know,

274
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:23,660
what facing you,
but it is certainly possible with you've

275
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:24,503
got something to say that people need to
hear and it actually constitutes 

276
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,550
reasonable quality education that in in 
a,

277
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:31,703
I would not say precisely in a pinch,
but it certainly is an alternative and 

278
00:12:34,741 --> 00:12:36,620
you have full control over that.
Well,

279
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,090
it'd be very interesting to see what 
happens with your,

280
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:43,230
with your contract renewal and we can 
certainly have another talk at that time

281
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,100
whether it goes badly or whether it goes
well either way.

282
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,490
So what do you think's going to happen 
to you?

283
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,820
What do you think's going to happen to 
you overall as a consequence of this?

284
00:12:53,821 --> 00:12:55,980
What are you afraid of,
if anything?

285
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,023
I mean the worst that could happen is 
that somehow the college decides that 

286
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:01,940
this is,
you know,

287
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,910
this warrants some kind of heavy 
sanctions.

288
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,773
That would be,
you know,

289
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,670
somehow I lost my registration over 
this.

290
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:13,260
That's the college of psychologists got 
involved in Ontario rather than just the

291
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,463
Ontario Psychological Association 
because the college for everyone who's 

292
00:13:17,581 --> 00:13:18,414
listening to colleges,
the body that regulates our clinical 

293
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,633
side,
clinical psychologists licensure in 

294
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:28,050
Ontario,
and to have them make any action against

295
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,430
one of their,
one of the,

296
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,710
one of the licensed psychologists and 
Ontario,

297
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:33,210
that can be a very,
very serious thing.

298
00:13:33,211 --> 00:13:34,044
That was definitely something that 
worried me while it still worries me to 

299
00:13:36,151 --> 00:13:36,984
some degree,
but certainly worried me a lot back in 

300
00:13:38,971 --> 00:13:42,480
October and November when,
when the remote was more negative,

301
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,390
when the university was responding 
negatively,

302
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:47,460
for example,
to what I was doing and sending me those

303
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:48,810
warning letters.
I mean,

304
00:13:48,811 --> 00:13:50,790
so far nothing,
nothing has come of that.

305
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,840
But um,

306
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,381
yeah,
I mean,

307
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:57,540
and that's the only real yes it is know.
And practically speaking,

308
00:13:57,541 --> 00:14:00,180
let's say the Ontario Psychological 
Association Listserv,

309
00:14:00,181 --> 00:14:02,940
the LPA lists or um,
a lot of people send out referrals.

310
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,043
And so if I'm qualified to deal with one
of the cases that they send out to you 

311
00:14:07,111 --> 00:14:11,210
can be guaranteed that certain people 
will not pass that referral by way of,

312
00:14:11,211 --> 00:14:13,320
I met my practice is busy enough as it 
is,

313
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:14,700
but you know,
that would be a potential consequence.

314
00:14:14,701 --> 00:14:17,210
This is why other people might not want 
to speak out.

315
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,830
And again,
if I'm applying it

316
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,510
is,
it is this sort of thing that,

317
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,390
that is why people don't want to speak 
out.

318
00:14:24,391 --> 00:14:25,230
And it,
it also,

319
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:26,970
I mean,
I get letters,

320
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,223
hordes of letters,
dozens of letters from people who say 

321
00:14:30,721 --> 00:14:33,690
exactly that if they're afraid to speak 
their mind,

322
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,583
students and students and people from 
all other walks of life who are afraid 

323
00:14:37,681 --> 00:14:38,514
to speak their mind because they're 
targeted by my people who have 

324
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,570
censorship on their mind and malice in 
their hearts,

325
00:14:45,571 --> 00:14:46,404
I would say.
And who are willing to use whatever 

326
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:51,560
means necessary to intimidate people 
whose opinions they don't agree with.

327
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,350
So exactly,
it's really not good.

328
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:57,990
And the thing is though,
this is what's worrying me is that the,

329
00:14:57,991 --> 00:14:59,300
uh,
the OPA OPA.

330
00:14:59,301 --> 00:15:00,134
And what I can tell from the comments 
that people don't see what you're 

331
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:02,970
saying.
I mean,

332
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:05,740
I think they think you're being 
hyperbolic reactionary.

333
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,890
Um,
you know,

334
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,743
they say,
show me one case and now the thing is 

335
00:15:09,261 --> 00:15:11,420
they always apply it to the transgender 
issue.

336
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,433
And I say,
please try to see it at a different 

337
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:16,310
level.
It's not just to put transgenders you,

338
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:19,540
that's just the context under which it 
happens.

339
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,760
But the actual issue,

340
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,980
look,
this was about preferred pronouns.

341
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:28,480
It would've died out in about a week and
it hasn't died out at all.

342
00:15:28,481 --> 00:15:29,314
Quite the contrary.
Everyone with any sense knows perfectly 

343
00:15:31,481 --> 00:15:34,660
well that this is about far more than 
and preferred pronouns.

344
00:15:34,661 --> 00:15:37,610
That just happened to be the issue.
Does your,

345
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,473
so to speak?

346
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:39,843
And.
Yes.

347
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,040
But I have to say though that the most 
recent,

348
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:42,874
uh,
when I posted the talks that you had on 

349
00:15:44,201 --> 00:15:45,034
Friday at mcmaster university where they
shamefully a shut you down and you 

350
00:15:50,321 --> 00:15:54,280
weren't able to speak.
When I posted that somebody wrote me and

351
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:55,114
again,
and they wrote to me privately and then 

352
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:56,914
publicly on the lists are asking me 
about why won't you just say they are 

353
00:16:00,671 --> 00:16:03,760
focusing on that even though we can 
cruise is a deeper issue.

354
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,090
This is the rigidity with which they're 
seeing this issue.

355
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,480
A reaction.
The reaction.

356
00:16:12,481 --> 00:16:13,314
Why won't he just say they to viewing 
what happened at mcmaster university is 

357
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:19,740
a little bit on the peculiar side I 
might say.

358
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,300
So,
you know,

359
00:16:21,301 --> 00:16:21,960
it's,
it's,

360
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,180
what do they say?
Swallowing a camel.

361
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:25,710
Well,
straining at a nap.

362
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,440
I think that's how that saying goes.
So,

363
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,540
um,
all right,

364
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:31,374
well,
so is there anything else that you 

365
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:33,084
wanted to talk about tonight or is that,
does that basically cover your concerns 

366
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,480
and describe what's been happening to 
you reasonably well?

367
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,440
I think it does.
I mean,

368
00:16:41,441 --> 00:16:42,274
and I'll,
I'll look into it and see what I'm able 

369
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:45,304
to maybe post publicly so that people 
can see what kind of discussions are 

370
00:16:47,921 --> 00:16:48,910
being had.
It,

371
00:16:48,911 --> 00:16:50,080
you know,
I won't put any names,

372
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,920
it will just simply be no,
this,

373
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,400
this is the manner in which we're,
we're,

374
00:16:54,401 --> 00:16:55,570
um,
we're communicating.

375
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,470
And again,
I

376
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,303
managed to,
that would be that people can judge for 

377
00:16:58,731 --> 00:17:00,360
themselves,
you know,

378
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,960
because at the moment it's sort of he 
said,

379
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:04,520
she said,
which is not great.

380
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,593
I mean it's not like mean certainly I'm 
listening to what you say and believe 

381
00:17:08,781 --> 00:17:09,614
that you're portraying it accurately,
but it's much better for people to be 

382
00:17:12,801 --> 00:17:16,340
able to make that judgment themselves.
So that would be,

383
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,203
that would be a useful thing to do.
Assuming that you can do it without 

384
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:24,800
compromising yourself or anyone else in 
any unreasonable manner.

385
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,113
But I also don't think it's unreasonable
to make things like this public because 

386
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,613
quality can make something public.
You really have to wonder what's going 

387
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:33,434
on.
So if there's a restriction against 

388
00:17:36,801 --> 00:17:40,730
sharing what's been happening on what's 
more or less a public,

389
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:41,863
it's more or less a public forum.
I know that it's part of the Ontario 

390
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:45,854
psychological association,
but it's not exactly private 

391
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:50,410
communication and if you're going to 
get,

392
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,473
if you're going to get in trouble for 
what you're posting and it's 

393
00:17:53,731 --> 00:17:55,770
unreasonable,
it would be useful for people to be able

394
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:58,480
to see that.
But you can decide that so.

395
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,840
Well,
I'm sorry Jordan,

396
00:18:01,841 --> 00:18:05,420
if I can say one more thing just because
I do want to be fair to,

397
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,450
to sell then.
I mean,

398
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:11,530
as I alluded to earlier is concerned is 
that it might be violating some OPA.

399
00:18:11,531 --> 00:18:12,364
OPA is hosted by the APA,
the American psychological association 

400
00:18:14,351 --> 00:18:17,020
lists or for whatever reason,
and he's concerned that,

401
00:18:17,021 --> 00:18:18,340
you know,
that it might be violating that.

402
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,880
So for him shutting things down,
I have no problem with that.

403
00:18:21,881 --> 00:18:24,430
If he's worried about that reason.
It's the,

404
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,320
it's the,
um,

405
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,910
I guess the message coming from the 
other members,

406
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:28,953
which is essentially they themselves are
saying they shut it down because we 

407
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,860
don't want to hear it and they think I'm
being just to again too arrogant or,

408
00:18:35,861 --> 00:18:37,090
or forceful.
But again,

409
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:37,924
that's not the real reason.
The real reason is that they don't like 

410
00:18:39,821 --> 00:18:41,990
what I have to say and um,
but,

411
00:18:41,991 --> 00:18:42,430
uh,
but again,

412
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,630
I understand the,
uh,

413
00:18:43,631 --> 00:18:45,690
you know,
the ostensible reason for which,

414
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,120
uh,
they're,

415
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:46,481
you know,
they're,

416
00:18:46,481 --> 00:18:47,314
they're shutting down the discussion.
I just want to make sure I'm clear on 

417
00:18:48,971 --> 00:18:50,560
that and I don't want to misrepresent 
that.

418
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,543
That's what they're saying.

419
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,121
Yeah.
Yeah.

420
00:18:53,121 --> 00:18:56,990
Well,
I mean it's hard to hard to know what to

421
00:18:56,991 --> 00:18:58,610
say about that.
I appreciate,

422
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,220
I appreciate what you're saying about 
it.

423
00:19:00,221 --> 00:19:01,054
I mean,
it still seems to me that the whole 

424
00:19:01,911 --> 00:19:02,744
point of a list service so that people 
can communicate their ideas and I do 

425
00:19:07,581 --> 00:19:08,414
believe that we're entering an age where
forceful discussion is going to be 

426
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,790
regarded as somehow will oppressive and 
violent.

427
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,624
And the problem is it's very difficult 
to discuss anything of importance 

428
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:19,100
without a certain amount of 
forcefulness,

429
00:19:19,101 --> 00:19:19,934
which you know,
is also directness and bluntness and 

430
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,080
speech.
That's to the point.

431
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,470
And we certainly don't want to interfere
with that and otherwise.

432
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,930
Well,
for obvious reasons,

433
00:19:29,931 --> 00:19:31,970
for obvious reasons.
Alright.

434
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,890
Well thanks very much for talking about 
this and I,

435
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,793
I guess I'll know.
We'll know very soon exactly how this 

436
00:19:37,971 --> 00:19:41,090
went and maybe I can talk to you again 
when we find out.

437
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,550
I'll give you an update to find out 
what,

438
00:19:43,551 --> 00:19:44,490
uh,
what they decide.
