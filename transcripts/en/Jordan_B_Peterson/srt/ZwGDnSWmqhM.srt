1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,460
Yeah.

2
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,190
When I had talked to people about doing 
the future authoring program,

3
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,203
they often put it off.
And it's not surprising because it's 

4
00:00:05,921 --> 00:00:07,730
hard and,
and b,

5
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,980
but it's more than that.
They think,

6
00:00:08,981 --> 00:00:10,150
well,
I don't know how to write.

7
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,170
I'm going to do a bad job.
I don't really like assignments.

8
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,430
I'm going to have to do it perfectly.
I need to wait till I have enough time.

9
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:19,773
And like one of those is enough to stop 
you cold and all five of them you're 

10
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:24,550
just done.
And so I tell people,

11
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:25,623
do it haphazardly,
a tiny bit at a time and badly because 

12
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:32,614
you can do that.
I tell my students when they're doing 

13
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,284
their thesis master's thesis,
write a really bad first draft and then 

14
00:00:38,441 --> 00:00:39,274
we have a little conversation about that
because they don't think I mean that 

15
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,070
because it sounds like a cliche in some 
sense.

16
00:00:45,071 --> 00:00:47,500
It's not a cliche,
it's not a cliche at all.

17
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:48,334
It means

18
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,090
you're a terrible writer.
But,

19
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,070
but if someone put a gun to your head 
and said,

20
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:59,960
you have to have your a hundred page 
thesis done by next Monday or I'll shoot

21
00:00:59,961 --> 00:01:02,660
you.
But I don't care how terrible it is.

22
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,780
You would sit down and write it and the 
thing is,

23
00:01:05,781 --> 00:01:08,630
then you have it right then,
then you have something and then you can

24
00:01:08,631 --> 00:01:10,730
fix it.
You can iterate and fix it.

25
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,610
That bad first draft.
That's the most valuable thing.

26
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:17,270
And so that's what you need.
You need a bad first draft of yourself.

27
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,733
And there's,
there's an idea that young developed 

28
00:01:20,961 --> 00:01:23,480
about the trickster and the gesture,
the comedian,

29
00:01:23,481 --> 00:01:24,314
right?
That the trickster is the precursor to 

30
00:01:26,001 --> 00:01:26,834
the savior.
And that's one of the things I learned 

31
00:01:28,191 --> 00:01:29,024
from young that was just,
it's so unlikely you'd never think that 

32
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:34,070
it's so amazing that that might be the 
case.

33
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,320
But the,
the,

34
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,470
the,
the,

35
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,900
the,
the satirical in the erotic and the,

36
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,050
and the troublemaker that the comedian,
the fool,

37
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,470
the fool is the precursor to the savior.
Why?

38
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,750
Because you're a fool when you start 
something new.

39
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,940
And so if you're not willing to be a 
fool,

40
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:52,280
then you'll never start anything new.
And if you never start anything new,

41
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:53,114
then you won't develop.
And so the willingness to be a fool is 

42
00:01:55,821 --> 00:01:59,150
the precursor to transformation.
And that's the same as humility.

43
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:01,190
And so if you're going to write your 
destiny,

44
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,113
you can do a bad first job.
You're going to get smarter as you move 

45
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:06,830
forward.
That's the thing is that,

46
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,290
so something beckons to you.
That's what happens here.

47
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,130
Maybe the star that Japan wished on was 
the wrong damn star,

48
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,290
but at least it was a star,
right?

49
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:16,940
At least it was in the sky.

50
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,230
At least it moved him forward.
And so you say in your life or something

51
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:25,040
grips you and fills you with interest 
and you think,

52
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:25,970
well,
should I do that?

53
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,910
And the answer is,
if not that,

54
00:02:28,911 --> 00:02:32,720
then something.
What if it's a mistake?

55
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,690
It's a mistake.
Rest assured,

56
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,180
what do you know?
You're going to stumble around,

57
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:39,920
right?
And what's going to happen is this,

58
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,730
you're going to move to,
you're going to not stay in stacy's.

59
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,330
You're not going to wander around in 
circles.

60
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,160
And I see people like that.
They said,

61
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:48,110
well,
I never knew what to do and now I'm 40

62
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,810
it's like,
that's not so good.

63
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,720
That's not so good.
And you might say,

64
00:02:53,721 --> 00:02:56,060
well,
and there is literature to that suggests

65
00:02:56,061 --> 00:02:56,894
that people are a lot more unhappy when 
they look back in their lives about the 

66
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:02,464
things they didn't do than they are 
about the mistakes they made while they 

67
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:06,520
were doing things.

68
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,590
And so that's really worth thinking 
about too,

69
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:09,424
because there's redemptive mistakes and 
a redemptive mistake would be a mistake 

70
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:15,370
that you make when you go out try to do 
something.

71
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:16,204
You know,
you actually,

72
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:16,931
you think,
okay,

73
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:17,764
I'm going to try and do this.
When you're not good at it and you make 

74
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:21,150
a bunch of mistakes.
It's like what?

75
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,043
What's the consequence if you pay 
attention is you're not quite so stupid 

76
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:27,430
anymore.
That's the thing is you've been informed

77
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:29,440
by your,
by the results of your errors.

78
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:32,030
And so what happens is you're,
you,

79
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,920
you follow the beacon,
you follow the light and you're blind.

80
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:37,170
So you don't know where the light is.
It's,

81
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:40,480
it's dimly apprehended only and you're 
afraid to follow it.

82
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:44,290
But you decided to take some stumbling 
steps towards it.

83
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,870
And as you take stumbling steps towards 
it,

84
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,913
you become illuminated and enlightened 
and informed because of the nature of 

85
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:52,444
your experience.
Because you're pushing yourself beyond 

86
00:03:53,801 --> 00:03:54,634
where you are and you're going into the 
country that you have not yet been in 

87
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,323
and you learn something.
And so what happens then is the star 

88
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:01,384
moves,
you move 10 feet towards it and you 

89
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:03,821
think,
no,

90
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:05,380
that's not right.
I didn't get it right.

91
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,420
It isn't there.
It's actually there.

92
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,583
And so then you,
you see it somewhere else and you shift 

93
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:13,900
yourself slightly and you move forward.
And that's what happens is that

94
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:21,450
you continue as you change the thing 
that guides you forward moves,

95
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,430
right?
It's like God in the,

96
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,840
in the,
in the desert,

97
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:26,674
in Egypt,
the pillar of light that you're 

98
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:28,810
following,
it's moving.

99
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,780
It's not a permanent thing.
You move towards it,

100
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:34,000
it moves away,
it guides you forward.

101
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,350
And so you say,
well,

102
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,820
is what I'm aiming at paradise itself.
And the answer to that is no,

103
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,654
because what do you know you,
you couldn't see paradise if it was 

104
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:45,670
right in front of you,
but you might get a glimmer of it.

105
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,313
And so you move towards it and you grow,
and then the next time you open your 

106
00:04:50,951 --> 00:04:52,870
eyes,
you see a little bit more clearly.

107
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,690
And that's what happens is that just 
happens over and over,

108
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,250
right?
It keeps moving.

109
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:04,430
And so you move like this,
but the thing that's so cool is that all

110
00:05:04,861 --> 00:05:05,694
those zigs and zags you say,
and each of those zags is and Zags is a 

111
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:10,200
catastrophe.
I hit a wall,

112
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:12,570
my God,
and then I had to die a little bit and I

113
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:15,480
barely got back up.
It's a phoenix transformation at each,

114
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,090
at each turn,
and it's painful.

115
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,430
But the thing is is that even though 
you've,

116
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,450
you've traveled 20 miles,
let's say on that road,

117
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,670
and you've only moved three miles 
forward,

118
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,510
you've moved three miles forward instead
of falling backwards.

119
00:05:30,511 --> 00:05:33,630
Because that's the thing too,
is that if you stand still,

120
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,040
you fall backwards.
You cannot stand still because the world

121
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:38,874
moves away from you.
If you stand still and there's no 

122
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,680
[inaudible],
there's only backwards.

123
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,680
And so if you're not moving backward,
back forwards,

124
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:49,780
then you're moving backwards.
And that's more,

125
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,690
more of the underlying truth of,
of the matthew principle,

126
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,820
to those who have everything more will 
be given from those who have nothing.

127
00:05:59,821 --> 00:06:02,730
Everything will be taken.
It's a warning.

128
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:08,090
Do not stay in one place.
Well,

129
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,090
as you zig and zag,
maybe the,

130
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,620
maybe the cataclysm of each 
transformation starts to lessen.

131
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:18,860
There's not so much of you that has to 
die with every mistake

132
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:24,470
and maybe you end up oriented at least 
reasonably properly.

133
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,530
And if you were sensible,
that would have been your trip,

134
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,060
but it wasn't right.
It's that,

135
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:30,550
and perhaps it's a lot worse.
Did Not.

136
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,930
Perhaps there's no shortage of 
backtracking,

137
00:06:32,931 --> 00:06:35,840
but it doesn't matter because as you 
stumbled forward,

138
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,440
you,
you eliminate and inform yourself.

139
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,483
And perhaps that's partly because the 
world is made of information and if you 

140
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,943
encounter it and tangle with it,
then it informs you and then you become 

141
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:53,150
informed and then you're in formation 
and then you're ready.
