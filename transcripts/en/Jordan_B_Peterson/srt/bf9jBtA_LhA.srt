1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,123
I got a video yesterday from a group in 
California that are trying to refocus 

2
00:00:05,841 --> 00:00:06,674
the Democrats and I want to tell you a 
little bit about it today and take it 

3
00:00:11,061 --> 00:00:14,360
apart and analyze it.
If we're all in luck,

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,600
given the importance of a stable,
intelligent,

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:18,463
functional two party political system in
the u s and in consequence everywhere 

6
00:00:23,031 --> 00:00:23,864
else in the world,
the video will make a reasonable case 

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,733
for something approximating and returned
to normative political debate in image 

8
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,503
and word.
I'll show you the whole thing first and 

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,070
then we'll take it apart.

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,060
We stand for the working men and women 
always have,

11
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,283
always will,
and we define ourselves by what we've 

12
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:51,990
done to help them get their shot at the 
American dream,

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,950
social security,
the Gi bill,

14
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:01,170
the Civil Rights Act,
medicare saving an auto industry,

15
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:02,843
23 million people with health insurance 
for the first time in their lives and 

16
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:11,340
all along it was American workers,
farmers and factory workers,

17
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,670
immigrants and engineers of every color 
speaking every language we're building,

18
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:19,230
the highest standard of living the world
had ever seen.

19
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:20,843
Who's innovations were changing history,
whose courage made America of beacon of 

20
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:28,050
hope and freedom for those living in 
tyranny around the world?

21
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,270
Working People made America work.

22
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,683
Then something happened.
Some people in Washington took the side 

23
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:42,390
of the powerful against American 
workers.

24
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:48,230
That game got fixed for an entire 
generation and come flatline.

25
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,250
Big donors made sure lawmakers cared 
more about Wall Street than your street.

26
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:54,803
Back in the 80s a CEO made 30 times what
is workers made now they make 300 times 

27
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,710
since the great recession,
almost all of the income gains have gone

28
00:02:04,711 --> 00:02:09,711
to the top 0.01% not 1% 0.01% instead of
raising your salary,

29
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,250
they buy back stock to increase their 
own bonuses.

30
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,353
They merged companies and reduce 
competition so they can make even more 

31
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:20,910
money.
All while your cable bill gets bigger,

32
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,390
your cell phone bill gets higher,
you're internet gets slower,

33
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,463
the seat on your flight gets smaller,
their taxes get lower and your health 

34
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:30,930
bills get raised.
Who's looking out for you?

35
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,363
The people in power are so busy giving 
tax breaks to the wealthiest that they 

36
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:38,940
blow up the deficit and leave nothing 
for roads and bridges,

37
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,980
nothing for veterans or Medicare,
nothing for job training.

38
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,880
Something has to change
and we're going to change it.

39
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,613
A new generation of leaders who know 
what needs to be done and who have the 

40
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:58,200
will to stand up to those who would hold
us back.

41
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,393
We want our America back.
The land of decency and fairness of 

42
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,513
generous hearts and big dreams and the 
freedom for anyone who wants to work 

43
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:13,420
hard to make those dreams come true.
I don't care what your politics are.

44
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,710
I don't care what God you pray to or 
what color your skin is.

45
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,663
I don't care if you ride a tractor and 
run a business and I hope your business 

46
00:03:20,071 --> 00:03:23,820
is a big success as long as everybody 
plays by the same rules,

47
00:03:23,821 --> 00:03:25,740
the same rules,
the same rules,

48
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:29,430
because this is America,
this is America,

49
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,470
this is America,
and this

50
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:36,630
is our generation's great calling to 
rise to the challenge like those who had

51
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:40,930
the courage before us to build a future 
for all Americans.

52
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Not just a few to fight for the higher 
pay working people have more than earned

53
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,710
to fight to make healthcare available to
everyone who needs it.

54
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,993
Just stop those who would try to cut the
social security and Medicare benefits 

55
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:59,770
that are rightfully yours to protect the
environment instead of selling it to the

56
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:00,604
highest bidder to fight for a government
free of corruption where your 

57
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:05,014
representatives work only for you
to build a future that is just and free 

58
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,400
full of hope and opportunity.
Our Future,

59
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:20,460
our children thank us for leaving 
because democracy is built not bought by

60
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:24,850
the strong and the free.

61
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,710
So that's the statement,
the story,

62
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,210
the appeal to voters and the 
establishment of direction.

63
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,410
We want to take a look at the images,
assessed the text,

64
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:53,603
determine what's in the video and 
equally importantly determine what is 

65
00:04:57,391 --> 00:05:00,570
not.
So I'll give you some background first.

66
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,570
This is about the group that's created 
it.

67
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,263
After the election in 2016 we created a 
political organization to work on the 

68
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:15,690
important issue of expanding the reach 
of Democrats and focusing on shared core

69
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:18,660
values.
Future majority.

70
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,913
That's the name of the organization.
Under the leadership of Mark Rydell 

71
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,060
continues to work on a vast scale to 
rebrand and define the party,

72
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,090
particularly in red and purple states 
and districts.

73
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,260
In an effort to shore up our base,
speak to swing voters and turn out those

74
00:05:34,261 --> 00:05:38,820
voters who we lost in the last election 
built,

75
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,970
not bought created by Marshall 
Herskovitz,

76
00:05:41,971 --> 00:05:42,804
Gregg Hurwitz and Kelly.
Corey is the cornerstone of a new 

77
00:05:46,021 --> 00:05:51,021
initiative that answers the question.
What do Democrats stand for?

78
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,580
The four minute film celebrates the 
singular importance of working people in

79
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:58,730
the creation of modern America.
Well,

80
00:05:58,731 --> 00:05:59,564
calling out the big donor influences 
that have eroded our democratic 

81
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:06,080
institutions over the past few decades.
It is a patriotic,

82
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:10,850
optimistic solutions oriented 
affirmation of core American values,

83
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,980
decency,
fair play,

84
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:17,840
the belief in a boundless future that 
seem too often forgotten in our partisan

85
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:18,674
era.
It's a call to action to build a future 

86
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:24,350
that has just in free full of hope and 
opportunity.

87
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,360
First is the name of the video itself 
built,

88
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,500
not bought.
This is obviously a direct appeal to the

89
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:34,334
idea of labor as opposed to capital and 
is in keeping with the traditional 

90
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:41,840
Democrat emphasis on the contribution of
the working class.

91
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,123
I think it skews a little left and an 
unfortunate manners strategically 

92
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,413
because the amazing infrastructure 
around us was built and bought since 

93
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:51,404
people need to be paid for their labor 
because capital contributes just like 

94
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:55,784
labor,
but perhaps that's a forgivable 

95
00:06:57,411 --> 00:06:58,610
rhetorical flourish.

96
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,160
Let's turn from that to the opening 
shot.

97
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,403
We stand for the working men and women.
We opened moving forward to a sun 

98
00:07:10,421 --> 00:07:11,254
dappled mountain vista that indicates 
the possibility of awkward movement 

99
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,920
progress and we switched to an image of 
a typical American nuclear family.

100
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,770
I liked the choice of that image a lot 
to open.

101
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:28,540
The opening scene of a film is 
particularly important and the fact that

102
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:29,374
these filmmakers chose to highlight the 
typical American nuclear family strikes 

103
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:35,590
me as a reasonable,
intelligent,

104
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,220
cautious,
and somewhat traditional initial choice

105
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,993
and we define ourselves by what we've 
done to help them get their shot at the 

106
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:47,240
American dream.
Social Security,

107
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:50,540
the Gi bill,
the Civil Rights Act,

108
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,063
medicare saving an auto industry,
23 million people with health insurance 

109
00:07:57,081 --> 00:07:58,760
for the first time in their lives.

110
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,543
This is followed by a 22nd section 
detailing the Democrats contribution to 

111
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:05,404
the higher standards of living currently
enjoyed by working class people in the 

112
00:08:09,191 --> 00:08:10,024
United States.
This seems to me to be handled with 

113
00:08:12,131 --> 00:08:13,750
reasonable credibility.

114
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,370
Long.
It was American workers,

115
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,593
farmers and factory workers,
immigrants and engineers of every color 

116
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,610
speaking every language we're building,
the highest standard of living the world

117
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:28,670
had ever seen who's innovations were 
changing.

118
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,504
History,
whose courage made America a beacon of 

119
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:35,120
hope and freedom for those living in 
tyranny around the world,

120
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:40,370
working people make America work.

121
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:45,520
I like this section quite a bit and 
found it surprising.

122
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,240
It was surprising because of the 
unabashed appreciation shown by the film

123
00:08:51,391 --> 00:08:52,224
makers for the effort put in by working 
class people to produce a higher 

124
00:08:58,501 --> 00:08:59,334
standard of living.
There's some genuine appreciation for 

125
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:02,184
the fact that this occurred,
and I see this as standing at quite 

126
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:10,881
marked contrast to the all too typical 
dialogue on the radical left,

127
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:16,251
concentrating on the pernicious effects 
of modern culture by image and word.

128
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:17,094
The filmmakers in this section testified
the utility of the efforts of people in 

129
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:21,774
the working class to producing the 
productive and relatively wealthy 

130
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:27,600
society that exists in the United States
and elsewhere today.

131
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,643
So I thought that was really good.
I also think it's important not to miss 

132
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:36,060
the positivity.
Radical inclusion of a young boy playing

133
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:36,894
in army helmet with an airplane.
That's a bit of respect shown both to 

134
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,240
the way boys typically play in the 
military all simultaneously.

135
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,980
So that's quite something.

136
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,813
Then something happened.
Some people in Washington took the side 

137
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:55,500
of the powerful against American 
workers.

138
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,180
The game got fixed for an entire 
generation.

139
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,253
Income flatlined.
Big donors made sure lawmakers cared 

140
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,390
more about Wall Street than you are 
street.

141
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:11,790
Back in the 80s a CEO made 30 times what
is workers made now?

142
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:15,810
They make 300 times since the great 
recession,

143
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:20,870
almost all of the income gains have gone
to the top 0.01% not 1% 0.01% instead of

144
00:10:23,731 --> 00:10:24,564
raising your salary,
they buy back stock to increase their 

145
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:27,504
own bonuses.
They merged companies and reduce 

146
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:31,410
competition so they can make even more 
money.

147
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,910
All while your cable bill gets bigger,
your cell phone bill gets higher,

148
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,510
you're internet gets slower,
the seat on your flight gets smaller,

149
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,600
their taxes get lower,
and your health bills get raised.

150
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,040
Who's looking out for you?

151
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,370
Yeah.
I think that the section we just watched

152
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,293
is the weakest part of the film and I 
think it's inclusion was an error of 

153
00:10:51,881 --> 00:10:54,570
other reasons to decry access 
inequality.

154
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,523
I thought the emphasis on the unnamed,
they and the images of wealth is under 

155
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,890
and luxury were unsophisticated,
cliched,

156
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:02,724
and unnecessarily divisive.
It is absolutely necessary for the 

157
00:11:05,521 --> 00:11:09,750
Democrats and for all those who wish for
return to politics as usual,

158
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:14,610
to distinguish between the majority of 
wealthy individuals in the US who are in

159
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:17,550
their money honestly and through benefit
to society,

160
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,413
freely chosen by consumers and the 
minority who gathered their position 

161
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,613
through unsavory or counterproductive 
means there is almost nothing more 

162
00:11:26,371 --> 00:11:27,204
important than distinguishing between 
the successful who earn their success 

163
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,673
and those who managed it through 
exploitation and conflating the two is 

164
00:11:34,931 --> 00:11:37,890
an assault on the ideas of competence,
aspiration,

165
00:11:37,891 --> 00:11:39,960
and accomplishment.
As such,

166
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,830
I truly believe that all this section 
was a regressive mistake,

167
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,873
a call to resentment as a reason for 
civic engagement and an insult to the 

168
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:49,164
hardworking people of the u s whose 
accomplishments were celebrated just 

169
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:55,390
prior to the deliverance of this darker 
message.

170
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:57,163
The people in power are so busy giving 
tax breaks to the wealthiest that they 

171
00:12:00,561 --> 00:12:03,710
blow up the deficit and leave nothing 
for roads and bridges,

172
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:08,780
nothing for veterans or Medicare,
nothing for job training.

173
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,180
Something has to change.

174
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,930
Now I found this section problematic to 
the people in power.

175
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,303
Well for a lot of the last while those 
people were also Democrats and the tone 

176
00:12:22,521 --> 00:12:24,470
in this section in the film we just 
watched,

177
00:12:24,471 --> 00:12:27,320
it implies that it was someone other 
than the people who are addressing you,

178
00:12:27,321 --> 00:12:30,980
her responsible for the current mess.
I think this part of the film would have

179
00:12:30,981 --> 00:12:31,814
been a lot stronger,
had the Democrats taking some 

180
00:12:33,771 --> 00:12:34,604
responsibility for the corruption that 
there decrying instead of attributing 

181
00:12:38,571 --> 00:12:42,920
its existence to unnamed others lurking 
somehow in the background.

182
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,443
This was a great opportunity in the 
course of the film for the Democrats to 

183
00:12:47,181 --> 00:12:48,014
note their own contributions to the 
current state of affairs and to promise 

184
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:52,184
to do better

185
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,223
and we're going to change it.
A new generation of leaders who know 

186
00:12:58,471 --> 00:13:02,070
what needs to be done and who have the 
will to stand up to those who would hold

187
00:13:02,071 --> 00:13:02,904
us back.

188
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,800
They're at a disability to be made.
It's appearance again.

189
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,500
It's not good to look for the cause of 
trouble outside.

190
00:13:09,501 --> 00:13:12,680
It's an ethical error.
It's another place where the film makers

191
00:13:12,681 --> 00:13:13,514
missed an opportunity to take 
responsibility on the part of the 

192
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,200
Democrats for what's happening around us
today.

193
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,240
That's an ethical mistake.

194
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,433
We want our America back,
the land of decency and fairness of 

195
00:13:25,731 --> 00:13:26,564
generous hearts and big dreams and the 
freedom for anyone who wants to work 

196
00:13:30,261 --> 00:13:34,400
hard to make those dreams come true.
I don't care what your politics are.

197
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,790
I don't care what God you pray to or 
what color your skin is.

198
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,160
I don't care if you ride a tractor and 
run a business.

199
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,890
Your Business is a big success as long 
as everybody plays by the same rules,

200
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:49,030
the same rules,
same rules because this is America.

201
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,640
This is America,
this is America.

202
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,390
I like this section a lot and again 
found its inclusion.

203
00:13:55,391 --> 00:13:56,224
Quite surprising.
There's even a bit of nostalgia for the 

204
00:13:58,481 --> 00:13:59,314
past,
something never seen on the progressive 

205
00:14:01,571 --> 00:14:04,690
landscape.
There's emphasis on generosity,

206
00:14:04,691 --> 00:14:05,524
certainly,
but also real consideration given to 

207
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:09,790
aspirations,
big dreams,

208
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,660
something that has been woefully lacking
in the discourse generated by the left.

209
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:18,580
This is reiterated in the statement and 
the freedom for anyone who wants to work

210
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:19,414
hard to make those dreams come true,
which is again remarkable for its 

211
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:24,334
unabashed insistence that there's a 
relationship between hard work and 

212
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:30,670
success and that success in itself is 
desirable,

213
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,530
admirable,
and worth pursuing.

214
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:34,883
Then there's a positive disavowal in my 
opinion of identity politics with each 

215
00:14:38,581 --> 00:14:39,414
speaker alone and identified visually as
an individual and insistence on fair 

216
00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:46,230
play,
an analog of equality,

217
00:14:46,231 --> 00:14:47,064
of opportunity,
not outcome and this direct statement 

218
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,543
from a policeman no less,
and I hope that your business is 

219
00:14:53,721 --> 00:14:54,554
successful,
very radical in a time where success is 

220
00:14:57,261 --> 00:15:00,770
all too often reflexively equated with 
privilege and oppression.

221
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,173
I think the ethos in this section stands
in powerful contradiction to that 

222
00:15:05,181 --> 00:15:06,014
presented earlier,
we're wealth and success was negatively 

223
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:11,990
portrayed,
which attitude is going to prevail?

224
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,423
It's obvious to me that the ladder 
message is most desirable and also most 

225
00:15:17,091 --> 00:15:20,270
likely to generate a favorable majority 
response.

226
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,660
People vote their dreams,
not the realities,

227
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:24,643
and it is perfectly reasonable for the 
Democrats to reconstitute themselves as 

228
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:28,724
the party that can make the dreams of 
individuals come true even if those 

229
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:35,480
individuals occupy a lower rung on the 
economic ladder.

230
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:40,720
And to do so by insisting upon a fair 
playing field the same rules and to know

231
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,853
finally that this characterizes America,
this borders on stating that a shared 

232
00:15:47,121 --> 00:15:47,954
value structure is a necessary 
precondition for social harmony and for 

233
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:53,780
the possibility of progress and upward 
mobility.

234
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:55,423
Much more of this on the part of the 
Democrats is necessary and would be 

235
00:15:58,161 --> 00:16:00,110
widely applauded and welcomed.

236
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:01,763
And this is our generation's great 
calling to rise to the challenge like 

237
00:16:06,491 --> 00:16:11,020
those who had the courage before us to 
build a future for all Americans,

238
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:16,590
not just the few to fight for the higher
pay working people have more than earned

239
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,303
to fight to make healthcare available to
everyone who needs it to stop those who 

240
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:23,194
would try to cut the social security and
Medicare benefits that are rightfully 

241
00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:30,580
yours to protect the environment instead
of selling it to the highest bidder,

242
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,193
to fight for a government free of 
corruption where your representatives 

243
00:16:35,021 --> 00:16:35,854
work only for you
to build a future that is just and free 

244
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:45,490
full of hope and opportunity.
Our Future,

245
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,520
our children thank us for leaving 
because democracy is built not bought by

246
00:16:52,751 --> 00:16:54,910
the strong and the free.

247
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,493
Yeah.

248
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:08,650
The film ends positively with a call to 
the future to build something promising.

249
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,093
It's marred once again in my opinion by 
the reference to those who had cut 

250
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:16,250
benefits and sell the environment to the
highest bidder.

251
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,533
More politics of resentment,
but uses positive imagery of 

252
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:21,044
infrastructure,
productive work and aspirational 

253
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:23,834
engagement presents a promise to fight 
corruption and closes with something 

254
00:17:27,831 --> 00:17:29,930
positive about both strength and 
freedom.

255
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,610
It could have been better for the 
reasons I outlined,

256
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:38,770
but it could have been a lot worse.
There's much less of the radical left is

257
00:17:38,771 --> 00:17:39,604
tilt towards identity politics that has 
characterized so much of the recent 

258
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:43,544
democratic conversation.
There's a strong sense of shared 

259
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:47,264
American society values.
There's tremendous emphasis on a fair 

260
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:53,440
playing field and the importance of 
promise of hard work,

261
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,920
not something typical of those who 
insist,

262
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,920
for example,
on equity or equality of outcome,

263
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,070
and do claim that our whole societies of
patriarchal tyranny,

264
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,653
in my estimation,
this film is a welcome move towards 

265
00:18:06,361 --> 00:18:07,194
classical liberal values and away from 
the divisive politics of political 

266
00:18:10,411 --> 00:18:13,680
correctness and naive but dangerous 
utopianism.
