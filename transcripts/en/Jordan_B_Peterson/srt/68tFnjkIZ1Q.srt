1
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:18,090
All right,
so we're going to leap out of the

2
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,660
psychoanalytic domain now and start
talking about at form of approach to

3
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:31,641
personality and its transformations
that's predicated on a different set of

4
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:38,691
different philosophical assumptions.
And it's a bit tricky to navigate this

5
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:43,890
because
it requires the adoption of a different

6
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:46,290
frame of mind.
And of course that's the case with all

7
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:48,750
the theorists that we're going to be
discussing.

8
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:55,020
Um,
phenomenology probably had its most

9
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:03,250
thorough explication
in the philosophy of Martin heidegger

10
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:12,510
and heidegger was actually trying to
reconstruct western philosophy from the

11
00:01:16,461 --> 00:01:21,461
bottom up.
He thought that we had been pursuing an

12
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,810
improper pathway conceptually,
really ever since the time of the

13
00:01:26,811 --> 00:01:27,680
ancient Greeks.

14
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,553
[inaudible]

15
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,920
back around the turn of the century,
the previous century,

16
00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:39,290
that from the 19th to the 20th century,

17
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,270
a new form of geometry was invented and
that geometry was predicated on

18
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:49,210
different axioms than Euclidean
geometry.

19
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,180
Now,
people had thought for thousands of

20
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,270
years that the world was properly
described by Euclidean geometry.

21
00:01:55,271 --> 00:02:00,010
And you know,
when you employ a system like Euclidean

22
00:02:00,011 --> 00:02:00,880
geometry,
you have,

23
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,300
there's axioms that you have to accept
and they're like the rules of the game.

24
00:02:04,301 --> 00:02:07,330
And once you accept the axioms then you
can go ahead and play the game.

25
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:13,350
But there are other forms of geometry
invented and in the,

26
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,700
in the later part of the 19th century.
And it turned out that those forms with

27
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:23,670
different axioms actually described the
world better than the Euclidean forums.

28
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,580
So sorta like the transformation from
Newton to Einstein.

29
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,570
This was the transformation from Euclid
to say,

30
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,820
I think I've got his name right,
Reman,

31
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:34,481
r,
I,

32
00:02:34,481 --> 00:02:34,961
e,
m,

33
00:02:34,961 --> 00:02:37,420
a,N ,
n who developed a new form of geometry.

34
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,570
And it turned out to be just the
geometry that Einstein needed when he

35
00:02:40,571 --> 00:02:44,080
was putting his theories forward.
And the reason I'm telling you that is

36
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:48,040
because
you can think of systems that have

37
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,410
different axioms as,
as different tools,

38
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:55,330
same idea that piaget was trying to
express when he talked about how

39
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,470
children's cognitive representations
underwent

40
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,990
staged transformations so that they were
starting to apply new principles.

41
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,480
Not only a new way of looking at the
world,

42
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:11,380
but they were fundamentally retooling
their presumptions about how the world

43
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:14,950
operated.
And heidegger tried to do the same thing

44
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:17,170
with philosophy.
And so,

45
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,310
and it's tricky to figure out exactly
what he was talking about,

46
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:21,931
but,
but I'll,

47
00:03:21,931 --> 00:03:25,240
I'll give it a shot and then we can move
forward with Rogers.

48
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:31,030
So since the dawn of the scientific
world and likely before that,

49
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,740
we have tended to believe that we are
subjects in a world of objects.

50
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,270
And that's obviously a very useful way
to view the world.

51
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:44,560
And you can tell that because
formalizing that in the form of science

52
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,860
has enabled us to extend control over
the world in ways that we were not able

53
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:53,360
to before,
um,

54
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,030
to formulate the idea of an objective
truth has been extraordinary useful

55
00:03:58,031 --> 00:04:00,880
maneuver.
And so the idea roughly is that

56
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,680
everyone's perceptions can be
contaminated by their own biases and

57
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:09,280
their own fantasies.
That subjective biases and fantasies and

58
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:14,610
you can overcome that by stringently
specifying the conditions under which an

59
00:04:14,981 --> 00:04:18,370
observation takes place.
So that would be an experimental method.

60
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,990
Having multiple people view the
consequences separately.

61
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,080
Have them detail out what the
consequences are and then look for

62
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:27,760
commonalities across them.
And you think,

63
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:30,010
well,
the common leds across the set of

64
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:33,670
observations constituted description of
the objective world.

65
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,530
And that's been insanely powerful.
Um,

66
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,950
crazily powerful.

67
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,630
I mean,
that's not all there is to the

68
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,840
scientific method,
but it's a big part of it.

69
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:48,880
Now,
there is an emergent problem with that.

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,920
Perhaps it's complicated,
but one of the emergent problems with

71
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:58,921
that is maybe a consequence of stripping
the subjectivity out of the world.

72
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,580
So what science does is consider
anything subjective as a form of bias or

73
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:10,960
error in the observation and then get
rid of it.

74
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:15,730
And so what you're left with when you
formulate the scientific world is a

75
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:19,660
world that stripped of subjectivity.
Now the problem with that is that you're

76
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:22,000
a subject.
And so when you strip the world of its

77
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:25,420
subjectivity,
that sort of leaves you isolated,

78
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:30,480
like an isolated being with no necessary
connection to objective reality in the

79
00:05:32,051 --> 00:05:37,051
midst of a set of impersonal fact.
And that seems to have psychological

80
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:41,140
consequences.
And the psychological consequences are

81
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,220
that,
well,

82
00:05:42,221 --> 00:05:45,400
for example,
I think it's easier to develop a

83
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:47,020
nihilistic sense of being.

84
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,560
For example,
if you believe that the world is nothing

85
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:55,561
but objects and that you're
fundamentally an object among many and

86
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,550
not a particularly important one at
that.

87
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:05,020
So there are psychological consequences
to adopting the scientific worldview.

88
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,790
Prior to the emergence of the scientific
worldview,

89
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:14,300
people were more embedded in what you
might think about as a mythological

90
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:15,380
landscape.
You know,

91
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:20,030
where every element of being had it's
place in something that approximated a

92
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:22,430
master plan or at least a meaningful
plan.

93
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,790
And so the idea of the meaning fullness
of life was not necessarily such a

94
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:30,770
pressing intellectual concern.

95
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:35,923
And then,

96
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,840
well,
and so we don't know the full extent of

97
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:41,660
that.
I mean I've talked to you a little bit

98
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:44,750
about niches.
Idea is expressed at the end of the 19th

99
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:49,130
century about the death of God and his
prognostication that the collapse of

100
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:55,450
classic systems of meaning would open up
people to possession by nihilism and

101
00:06:56,721 --> 00:07:00,200
also by potentially totalitarian
political systems.

102
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:02,300
And that seems to have been what
happened now.

103
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:06,500
Heidegger was very concerned about that
among other things,

104
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:12,100
and so he decided to reconsider reality
from the bottom up and so what he did

105
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:17,090
was generate an alternative set of
axioms.

106
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:18,410
He said,
he said something like,

107
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:23,540
well,
what if we decide to make reality?

108
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:27,890
Everything that we experience,
forget about the subject object divide.

109
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,720
One of the other problems with the
subject object divide for example,

110
00:07:32,721 --> 00:07:34,370
is accounting for consciousness,
right?

111
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:37,850
Because it's a problem that science
really hasn't got any distance with at

112
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:38,150
all.

113
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,770
As far as I can tell.
I mean,

114
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:42,830
people have been trying to crack the
secret of consciousness obviously for a

115
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:45,740
very long time,
but they've been trying to do it

116
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,510
formally and using scientific methods at
least for the last 50 years,

117
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,630
and my sense of that is that they've got
absolutely nowhere.

118
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:58,340
Maybe that's a bit unfair.
We're better at representing how

119
00:07:58,341 --> 00:08:02,150
conscious experiences manifest
themselves in the brain.

120
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,320
But we're certainly no better at
understanding how it is that we

121
00:08:06,321 --> 00:08:08,780
experience things.
And that's the problem of Kalia,

122
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,900
that that's how the philosophers
describe it.

123
00:08:11,901 --> 00:08:14,510
And quality is the quality of your
experience.

124
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:16,820
Like the,
the fact of pain for example,

125
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:21,560
in the pain you feel is by no means
identical at least as far as you're

126
00:08:21,561 --> 00:08:24,770
concerned to some pattern of
neurological activity.

127
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,030
Right?
It's pain.

128
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,030
It seems to be a fundamental reality of
something.

129
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:31,280
In fact,
I think pain is the fundamental reality.

130
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,280
I think it's the only thing that people
will never deny but and so,

131
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:40,940
so there are these aspects of your
existence that are subjective,

132
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:44,090
like your experience of color and your
experience of beauty and just your

133
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:49,091
experience of things or maybe just your
experience and your experience plays a

134
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,960
in role in the structure of being
itself.

135
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,730
Cause you might ask,
well what would there be if there was

136
00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:59,610
nothing conscious and you could say,
well

137
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,680
what would there be if there was nothing
conscious of being?

138
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,840
Well,
it's a tricky question because it

139
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:11,841
depends on your a priori axioms,
but it's not obvious what there would

140
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:14,220
be.
In the absence of a conscious observer.

141
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,420
There wouldn't obviously be any duration
between things.

142
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,870
It would be very difficult to specify
things in terms of size.

143
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:26,850
There wouldn't be any of the qualities
that we experience that we experience

144
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:30,660
are being as having cause color doesn't
seem to be an intrinsic part of the

145
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:31,200
world.

146
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,780
Smell doesn't seem to be intrinsic part
of the world.

147
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,020
It's very difficult.
The more you think about it,

148
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:40,980
you'd find the more difficult it is to
determine exactly what their would be if

149
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:45,210
there was no one to observe it.
And that's not the tree in the forest

150
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:46,230
idea.
Precisely.

151
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:50,190
It's not so much if a tree falls in the
forest and there's no one to hear it,

152
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:52,770
does it make a sound?
Because that's more a matter of the

153
00:09:52,771 --> 00:09:56,820
definition of sound than anything else.
This is more like if there's a tree in

154
00:09:56,821 --> 00:09:59,820
the forest and there isn't anyone,
is there a tree?

155
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,830
And that's a whole different question.
Anyway,

156
00:10:02,831 --> 00:10:07,831
so what heidegger did,
partly because he was not pleased,

157
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:13,041
I suppose with the metaphysical
consequences of the scientific worldview

158
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:18,600
and also perhaps because he wasn't very
happy about our ability to account for

159
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:22,350
consciousness.
He decided to see what would happen if

160
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:24,030
he played a different kind of game.

161
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,880
And you can do that in an intellectual
discussion.

162
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:27,661
You know,
you can say,

163
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:30,540
well,
here's the set of axioms out of which

164
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,720
assistant will emerge.
Like here's a set of rules out of which

165
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:36,180
a game would emerge.
Same idea.

166
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,850
What if we start with a different set of
rules?

167
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:42,780
Let's see what we can do if we do that.
You kind of do that when you play one

168
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:45,740
video game rather than another,
you know their little worlds that pop

169
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,130
out there.
There's different,

170
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,140
there's a different underlying structure
and then you can go inside that world

171
00:10:50,141 --> 00:10:53,340
and experiment with it and see what,
what comes out of it.

172
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,120
So heidegger decided to say,
okay,

173
00:10:57,121 --> 00:10:59,910
what we're going to do instead is we're
going to assume that everything we

174
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:02,760
experience is real.
We're going to make our field of

175
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:07,761
experience itself reality.
And so that would mean from heidegger's

176
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:13,881
point of view that everything about
the being that manifests itself to you

177
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:18,600
is to be regarded as equally real.

178
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,210
So then you think,
well that makes pain a fundamental

179
00:11:21,211 --> 00:11:23,730
reality that makes it anxiety,
a fundamental reality.

180
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:27,180
It makes beauty and color fundamental
realities.

181
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:32,181
They're not self-evidently reduceable to
anything else which they would be,

182
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,440
which they are in this scientific from
the scientific perspective because you

183
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,830
have to think about them as
manifestations of some more fundamental

184
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:44,490
underlying material reality.
And I guess that's another problem with

185
00:11:44,491 --> 00:11:48,810
the subject object model and the
material model.

186
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:54,770
When you aggregate Adam's,
when you arrange them in certain forms

187
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,510
and when they manifest themselves as
certain molecules and then in more

188
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:01,840
complex structures,
they seem to take on all sorts of

189
00:12:01,841 --> 00:12:06,580
qualities that you couldn't predict if
you just knew about the sub atomic

190
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:10,930
particles in the atoms themselves.
And so of course they're what are called

191
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,310
emergent properties.
And you say,

192
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:16,580
well you can
observe hydrogen and you can observe

193
00:12:16,581 --> 00:12:20,840
oxygen,
but that doesn't make itself evident for

194
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:22,820
you to be able to predict the properties
of water.

195
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,340
And of course that's a much simpler
problem.

196
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,400
All things considered.
Then the problem of figuring you out

197
00:12:28,401 --> 00:12:31,760
here,
this crazily complex aggregate of these

198
00:12:31,761 --> 00:12:34,700
hypothetical hypothetically simple
entities,

199
00:12:34,701 --> 00:12:39,701
but it isn't obvious how their elemental
properties can combine to produce you.

200
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,500
It's not obvious at all.
It's certainly not obvious how a

201
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:50,501
material that's supposed to be dead
matter so to speak can can manifest

202
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,220
consciousness no matter how complex Lee,
it's arranged.

203
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,013
So

204
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:03,910
the phenomenologists,
heidegger leading them were attempted to

205
00:13:06,011 --> 00:13:11,011
produce a philosophical model of being,
and we'll talk more specifically about

206
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,890
the phenomenologists after we're done
with Rogers,

207
00:13:14,891 --> 00:13:19,891
but he's,
he fits in that philosophical framework.

208
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,453
And

209
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,940
one of the things that I've thought,
this is a bit of a tangent,

210
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,790
but I'll move back to the moral
afterwards.

211
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,930
See,
I really liked the psycho analyst and I

212
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:50,440
liked the idea that you have a psyche
that's inside of you and that that is

213
00:13:50,441 --> 00:13:54,040
structured in partly consciously and in
part conch unconsciously.

214
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,550
There's something about that that's
really cool and I've learned a lot from

215
00:13:57,551 --> 00:14:00,250
the psychoanalyst,
but you know there is a funny

216
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,220
consequence of thinking the way they
think.

217
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,220
And you do think the way they think,
even if you don't know it,

218
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:09,700
like we tend to think that a lot of us
has inside our head.

219
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,640
You know,
that's the psyche model basically,

220
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:16,030
but the more I've practiced as a
clinical psychologist,

221
00:14:16,031 --> 00:14:18,010
the last,
I've actually been convinced that that's

222
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:20,020
true.
So I could say,

223
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:22,120
well,
let's say I want to know about your

224
00:14:22,121 --> 00:14:23,740
personality.
We think,

225
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:24,760
well,
I want to know you.

226
00:14:24,761 --> 00:14:28,480
I want to know about your subjectivity.
I didn't want to know what's inside of

227
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:30,520
you,
but that isn't actually what you do want

228
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:32,350
to know.
If you're doing clinical work,

229
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:34,480
say with someone you want to know,

230
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,840
did they have any friends?
That's really important because if

231
00:14:39,841 --> 00:14:44,580
you're miserable and anxious and badly
placed in life and misbehaving,

232
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,390
one of the reasons that all of that can
occur is because you don't have any

233
00:14:48,391 --> 00:14:49,500
friends.
You don't know anyone,

234
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:54,950
and that's not something that's you.
It's it's you localized in a broader

235
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,650
sphere.
And then you might say,

236
00:14:57,651 --> 00:15:00,170
well,
do you have a job and well,

237
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:02,480
let's talk about the job.
Do you actually make enough money with

238
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:05,420
your job?
Is it satisfying for you in any way?

239
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:07,490
Are you bullied all the time?
When you're at work?

240
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,210
Does it provoke anxiety?
Is it a career that allows you to go

241
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:13,070
somewhere?
Are you overworked?

242
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,200
Well,
but let's start with just the first

243
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:17,120
question.
Do you have a job?

244
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,410
Well,
if the answer to that is it,

245
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:21,770
no,
you have a serious problem and that

246
00:15:21,771 --> 00:15:25,530
would enough might be to depress you and
make you anxious and hopeless and

247
00:15:25,531 --> 00:15:26,990
nihilistic and all of those things.

248
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,280
And you could say,
well,

249
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:30,980
you're not reacting very well to not
having a job.

250
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,850
But that's kind of a foolish objection.
Even though some of it might be true.

251
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,610
One problem is,
is that you're not reacting very well to

252
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:40,160
not having a job.
But another problem is that you don't

253
00:15:40,161 --> 00:15:42,920
have a job and that actually constitutes
a problem,

254
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,780
right?
You don't get to eat.

255
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,380
You don't have a place to live.
So those aren't psychological problems.

256
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:50,630
Precisely.
Even though a psychological problem

257
00:15:50,631 --> 00:15:52,880
could make it worse.
Well,

258
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:56,030
are you as educated as you should be?
That's another question.

259
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,690
How do you handle drugs and alcohol?
Are they taking you down a bad pathway,

260
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,460
you know?
Um,

261
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:05,000
what about intimate relationships?
Do you have one?

262
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,090
Do you have a plan for one or they,
is that a never ending series of

263
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:10,580
catastrophes or something that you avoid
completely.

264
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,520
That's a big problem.
And maybe people don't,

265
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,800
aren't attracted to you for one reason
or another.

266
00:16:15,801 --> 00:16:18,170
And you could think about that as a
psychological problem,

267
00:16:18,171 --> 00:16:22,520
but it's an interpersonal problem.
And the degree to which that's a

268
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:27,110
psychological problem is,
is certainly an specified when you first

269
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,330
begin to talk to somebody.
What about your family?

270
00:16:29,331 --> 00:16:32,300
Do you have a family?
Cause it's hard to be in the world all

271
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:33,980
by yourself.
That's for sure.

272
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,940
It makes things a lot more stressful.
Even though having a family can also be

273
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:40,040
extraordinarily stressful.
You don't,

274
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,190
do you have plans to have children?
How are you doing with your parents?

275
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,590
Do you get along with your siblings?
You know,

276
00:16:45,591 --> 00:16:48,830
all of that.
All of that to me is more fundamental.

277
00:16:48,831 --> 00:16:52,370
And it's outside of you.
Those are elements of your experience

278
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,640
more broadly conceptualized more than
they are objects of your psychology or

279
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,200
of your internal experience.
You know,

280
00:17:00,201 --> 00:17:01,034
it's sort of like

281
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,010
while a person is,
uh,

282
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,790
is it is a creature that exists at
multiple levels of analysis,

283
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,820
right?
Something might go wrong with you at a

284
00:17:12,821 --> 00:17:15,250
cellular level,
so maybe you're born with a genetic

285
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:19,720
abnormality so something's wrong with
you molecularly or you have something

286
00:17:19,721 --> 00:17:22,810
wrong with a major Oregon.
Or maybe there's something wrong with

287
00:17:22,811 --> 00:17:26,830
you psychologically or maybe you're in a
pathological family or maybe you're

288
00:17:26,831 --> 00:17:29,980
stuck in a pathological social system
and,

289
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,930
and figuring out what's why you're
suffering means going up and down those

290
00:17:34,931 --> 00:17:37,810
different levels.
Trying to specify the appropriate level

291
00:17:37,811 --> 00:17:40,600
for analysis and also the appropriate
level for intervention.

292
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,820
And for me as a,
as I've said,

293
00:17:42,821 --> 00:17:46,090
even though I'm a great admirer of the
psychoanalysts and I do things like

294
00:17:46,091 --> 00:17:49,380
dream analysis,
which I really find you an incredibly

295
00:17:49,381 --> 00:17:53,220
useful and enlightening the first,
the fundamental level of analysis is,

296
00:17:53,221 --> 00:17:55,080
well what's your experience structured
like?

297
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,080
Exactly.
And that isn't localized in you.

298
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:02,160
Now the behaviorists do that too because
it's one of the things I really liked

299
00:18:02,161 --> 00:18:04,020
about the behavioral approach to
psychotherapy.

300
00:18:04,021 --> 00:18:05,730
It's very,
very concrete and practical.

301
00:18:05,731 --> 00:18:07,500
It's like they'll say,
well,

302
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,130
there are certain things that you need
to have in order to live properly and

303
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:14,790
maybe you don't have the skills or the
wherewithal where with all to accumulate

304
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:17,880
them and we'll break them down into tiny
little pieces and you'll practice.

305
00:18:17,881 --> 00:18:20,250
So for example,
with someone who doesn't have any

306
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:22,950
friends,
then you do a micro analysis of their

307
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:27,540
social skills say and maybe an analysis
of the kinds of anxiety that are

308
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,880
stopping them from going out and meeting
people.

309
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,790
And then you address those things
practically one by one.

310
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,590
You try to get the person to have some
friends.

311
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,980
He tried to figure out how they can
establish an intimate relationship.

312
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,440
You see if you can help them sort out
their family,

313
00:18:40,441 --> 00:18:42,330
you do what you can about their
employment.

314
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:46,650
And a lot of that's only tangentially
related to really in some sense to the

315
00:18:46,651 --> 00:18:50,070
structure of their psyche.
But one of the things you'll see if you

316
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,450
work as a clinician or as a counselor is
that most of the time people come and

317
00:18:54,451 --> 00:18:57,060
see you because they have problems,
not because they have psychological

318
00:18:57,061 --> 00:19:00,810
problems and those things are not that
easy to distinguish.

319
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,150
You know,
it's sort of the psychoanalytic idea

320
00:19:03,151 --> 00:19:04,830
sort of like,
well if you just start your act

321
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,630
together,
everything would work out for you.

322
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,280
It's like,
yeah,

323
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,100
there's some truth in that,
but,

324
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,720
but you know,
if you're 55 years old and you've just

325
00:19:19,721 --> 00:19:24,260
been laid off work
and maybe through no fault of your own,

326
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:29,300
it isn't obvious how much getting your
act together is going to help you find

327
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:32,630
another job.
Because the actual problem that you're

328
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:36,200
facing me have relatively little to do
with you.

329
00:19:36,201 --> 00:19:40,430
And that would especially be the case if
you're maybe on the bottom half of the

330
00:19:40,431 --> 00:19:44,810
intelligence distribution for example.
And so it isn't as easy for you just to

331
00:19:44,811 --> 00:19:48,140
go out and pick up new skills at the
drop of a hat,

332
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,630
you know?
And that gets harder as you get older

333
00:19:50,631 --> 00:19:53,810
because your Iq actually declines quite
substantially as you get older.

334
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,680
That that working or the the fluid
intelligence part anyways,

335
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,260
exercise can keep that at bay by the
way.

336
00:20:00,261 --> 00:20:03,530
It's the best way to keep that at bay.
So anyways,

337
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:09,530
you can think from the phenomenological
viewpoint of your experience as a whole

338
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,740
instead of you being a subject in an
objective world.

339
00:20:12,741 --> 00:20:16,280
And so here's another way of of here's
something that's quite useful.

340
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,370
Young talked about this because he was
moving towards a phenomenological

341
00:20:19,371 --> 00:20:22,310
perspective later in his life.
The last book he wrote was called

342
00:20:22,311 --> 00:20:27,311
mysterium [inaudible] and he talked
about three conjunctions that needed to

343
00:20:27,441 --> 00:20:31,520
take place in order for someone to be
well constituted psychologically.

344
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:36,910
And you know how piaget talked about
learning that you could not only follow

345
00:20:37,251 --> 00:20:40,670
rules but that you could make rules for
new games as sort of the highest level

346
00:20:40,671 --> 00:20:45,650
of moral development.
I would say young extended the Piagetian

347
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:48,100
moral continuum up past

348
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,410
what piaget had envisioned.
Now he didn't,

349
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,710
he didn't do that cause he wasn't trying
to extend Piaget's model.

350
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,890
But,
but you can think about it the same way.

351
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:01,510
It's not easy to come up with a moral
motive being say,

352
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:04,270
that transcends the ability to make
rules for new games.

353
00:21:04,271 --> 00:21:05,530
That's damn smart,
man.

354
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,040
That's,
that's,

355
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,190
that's a major home run by piaget as far
as I'm concerned.

356
00:21:09,191 --> 00:21:11,530
But Young said something like this said,
look,

357
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:14,770
when you're going through the process of
psychological integration,

358
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,990
here's a way of conceptualizing it.
And he thought about this as

359
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:26,310
symbolically as male female pairings.
Because as I've tried to point out the

360
00:21:26,921 --> 00:21:28,780
most,
one of the most fundamental character

361
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:33,010
categories that are mythological
imagination uses to structure the world

362
00:21:33,011 --> 00:21:34,870
is the category of masculine and
feminine.

363
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,670
And it moves that around.
You know,

364
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:38,080
it's,
it's a fundamental metaphor.

365
00:21:38,081 --> 00:21:39,580
So you can move that around anywhere.

366
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,130
And so young thought,
well one of the things that you're

367
00:21:42,131 --> 00:21:46,480
trying to do is to get your thoughts and
your emotions integrated.

368
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,101
And so,
you know,

369
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:51,100
the Classic Enlightenment Viewpoint,
roughly speaking,

370
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:54,310
is something like passion is the enemy
of reason,

371
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:57,670
right?
And so to the degree that your rational,

372
00:21:57,671 --> 00:22:00,250
it's sort of a Friday viewpoint.
It's cause he got your emotions under

373
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:04,960
control and there's some truth in that,
but not enough truth.

374
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,690
I like the Piagetian idea better,
which is that,

375
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,370
no,
no that isn't what happens.

376
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:11,800
What happens if,
if you're playing the proper game is

377
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:15,190
that you integrate your emotions
underneath.

378
00:22:15,191 --> 00:22:18,280
You're thinking something like that.
So they're all working in the same

379
00:22:18,281 --> 00:22:19,180
direction,
you know?

380
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:23,110
So for example,
you can make your anxiety work against

381
00:22:23,111 --> 00:22:26,780
you or for you.
And one of the ways I did,

382
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:29,890
I made a program called the future
authoring program that I think helps

383
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:30,724
people do that.

384
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:33,220
Because one of the things you see when
you're talking to people and they're

385
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:36,310
trying to solve problems is that they're
afraid to face the problem.

386
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:39,220
And so then their anxiety is working
against them.

387
00:22:39,221 --> 00:22:42,970
And you can think about it as a,
as antagonistic to rationality.

388
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:46,480
But then I could say,
well why don't you think for a while

389
00:22:46,481 --> 00:22:50,170
about what your life would be like if
you didn't face this problem?

390
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,860
Because if you think that through,
if you have a problem and you really

391
00:22:53,861 --> 00:22:58,000
think through what the consequences are
going to be in three to five years of

392
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,640
not facing it,
then you're going to get more afraid of

393
00:23:00,641 --> 00:23:02,230
not facing it,
then facing it.

394
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:06,100
And that's great because then your
anxiety instead of standing in front of

395
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:08,980
you,
instead of you having a dragon that's

396
00:23:08,981 --> 00:23:11,920
guarding the path in front of you,
where you have one chasing you down the

397
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:14,890
path from behind,
that's a lot more useful.

398
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,040
And so,
you know,

399
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:21,940
that's just a minimal example of the
utility of getting your emotions and

400
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:24,760
your,
and your thoughts aligned the same way.

401
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,880
The same thing happens with aggression.
You know,

402
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,240
one of the most common reasons that
people come and seek psychotherapy

403
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:35,020
really is because they're too agreeable.
But what that means is they're not

404
00:23:35,021 --> 00:23:37,240
assertive enough.
They have an integrated their capacity

405
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:39,460
for aggression.
And so other people can push them around

406
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,060
and,
and they're very conflict avoidant.

407
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,040
And,
and so the consequences of that across

408
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:50,390
time is that you don't stand up for
yourself well enough and you get taken

409
00:23:50,391 --> 00:23:53,330
advantage of.
And that spirals badly downward.

410
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:58,331
And so partly what you do when you're
doing assertiveness training with people

411
00:23:59,031 --> 00:24:03,950
is you find out what they're angry about
and there are usually angalee angry if

412
00:24:03,951 --> 00:24:06,470
they're not assertive enough because
other people are taking advantage of

413
00:24:06,471 --> 00:24:06,590
them.

414
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:11,180
Or You could say because they're not
putting their own necessities forward

415
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:13,460
with enough force.
It's hard to distinguish between those

416
00:24:13,461 --> 00:24:15,320
two things.
But anyways,

417
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:16,920
you,
he try,

418
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,940
you get them to talk about what they're
angry about that often makes them cry

419
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:23,270
often many times.
And then you get them to kind of

420
00:24:23,271 --> 00:24:26,180
envision what they would want to have
instead,

421
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,140
which they're often afraid to do because
people are afraid to think about what

422
00:24:30,141 --> 00:24:33,980
they want because that makes it more
clear when they're not getting it and

423
00:24:33,981 --> 00:24:35,210
that's painful,
right?

424
00:24:35,211 --> 00:24:38,630
Or maybe they're afraid of hoping so
they won't specify a clear aim.

425
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,090
But anyways,
you get them to think about what they

426
00:24:41,091 --> 00:24:43,520
might want.
Instead you get them to think about the

427
00:24:43,521 --> 00:24:46,670
costs of not pursuing that.
And then you help them develop

428
00:24:46,671 --> 00:24:51,671
strategies for integrating their
aggression and with their thinking so

429
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:56,900
that they can come up with a plan to
approach the world in a more confident

430
00:24:56,901 --> 00:24:57,110
way.

431
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:59,060
So for example,
someone might come to me and say,

432
00:24:59,061 --> 00:25:02,420
I'm being bullied badly at work.
And so then I'll say,

433
00:25:02,421 --> 00:25:05,930
well what are your options?
You have to put up with it.

434
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,700
Well we'll,
we'll figure that out.

435
00:25:07,701 --> 00:25:09,500
Cause maybe you do,
maybe you don't have options,

436
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,520
but here's how to find out.
Get your damn cv together so it's

437
00:25:13,521 --> 00:25:14,900
pristine,
right?

438
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,720
It's,
it's ready to go get over your fear of a

439
00:25:17,721 --> 00:25:20,480
new interview because it,
people are generally afraid of that.

440
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,850
Get over your fear of applying for a new
job.

441
00:25:22,851 --> 00:25:25,790
Start thinking about what it would mean
to have a different job.

442
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,410
Start thinking about what it would mean
to have a better job even because maybe

443
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,650
your fear is just making you stuck here.
But I can tell you one thing,

444
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,680
if someone's picking on you at work and
you don't have options,

445
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:37,873
you lose.

446
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,970
So you get the person to start building
a strategy.

447
00:25:40,971 --> 00:25:41,804
It's like,
okay,

448
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:44,480
if you're going to tell this person to
stop,

449
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:48,320
you have to know how to make them stop
and one and the one thing you need for

450
00:25:48,321 --> 00:25:50,720
sure is an option.
And if you can't,

451
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,290
if you don't have an option,
then maybe we start thinking about the

452
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:58,010
fact that you need some more training or
something like that because you cannot

453
00:25:58,011 --> 00:26:01,790
negotiate if you don't have any power.
So because while,

454
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,820
especially if you're dealing with
someone who's really out to get you or

455
00:26:04,821 --> 00:26:07,630
really disagreeable,
if you don't have a leg to stand on and

456
00:26:07,631 --> 00:26:10,400
they'll just push you over and maybe
they'll jump on youtube because that's

457
00:26:10,401 --> 00:26:11,920
what they're like and they enjoy it
anyways,

458
00:26:11,921 --> 00:26:16,910
so it's no joke.
So you'll put your options behind you

459
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:18,680
and then you start to think about
strategy.

460
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,820
So I tell people,
look,

461
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,660
if you're being harassed at work,
you documented every time it happens and

462
00:26:23,661 --> 00:26:26,570
you write it down.
So you've got like 20 stories about it

463
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,050
and it's fully documented.
And then you go confront the person at

464
00:26:30,051 --> 00:26:32,150
some point.
But with at least three pieces of

465
00:26:32,151 --> 00:26:36,500
evidence and you have some sense of what
you tell them about what will happen if

466
00:26:36,501 --> 00:26:39,080
they don't stop.
So you have to figure out,

467
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:40,610
well,
if they don't stop,

468
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,070
what are you gonna do about it?
Leave.

469
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,280
Not if you can't leave.
So you,

470
00:26:45,281 --> 00:26:46,770
you,
you have to be able to,

471
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,500
what is it wield a big stick and speak
softly,

472
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,210
but you see that way.
It's,

473
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:55,680
that's how you take your aggression,
which is an absolutely necessary part of

474
00:26:55,681 --> 00:27:00,681
your psyche and manifest it up into a
sophisticated means of dealing with the

475
00:27:01,231 --> 00:27:02,790
world.
You don't just suppress it.

476
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,181
You say,
well,

477
00:27:03,181 --> 00:27:06,540
I should be able to put up with it,
or I wish I wasn't so angry or

478
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,230
something.
It's like,

479
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:10,920
forget that.
That's all it will happen is your blood

480
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:13,740
pressure will stay high and you'll die
of a heart attack because anger for

481
00:27:13,741 --> 00:27:16,680
example,
it's a very toxic emotion and it does

482
00:27:16,681 --> 00:27:19,440
cause heart damage over time.
It's the only emotion that we really

483
00:27:19,441 --> 00:27:23,550
know that's been linked to things like
cardiovascular risk and anger is,

484
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,030
is toxic because it's like you're
driving a car.

485
00:27:27,031 --> 00:27:28,620
You've,
you're stepping on the gas and pushing

486
00:27:28,621 --> 00:27:32,220
on the brake at the same time because
anger tells you to run away and to

487
00:27:32,221 --> 00:27:35,460
attack at the same time cause you don't
know what's going to happen.

488
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:39,270
And so it,
it really amps up the physiological

489
00:27:39,271 --> 00:27:41,610
demand on your body.
And so if you,

490
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,010
including your heart and your
musculature,

491
00:27:44,011 --> 00:27:46,200
so if you stay like that for like 10
years,

492
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:51,030
you know you're going to age 20 years
and that's a bad plan.

493
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:54,930
So,
so you know,

494
00:27:54,931 --> 00:27:59,160
you take your underground emotions and
you integrate them into a sophisticated

495
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:01,800
reality.
Now

496
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,090
Young said,
so first of all,

497
00:28:06,091 --> 00:28:08,280
unite your,
you unite your mind.

498
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,380
You're thinking,
let's say with your emotions.

499
00:28:10,381 --> 00:28:13,920
So that makes one thing instead of two
fighting things.

500
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,960
Okay,
that's a good one.

501
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:20,730
And then the next conjunction he talked
about was it isn't enough to unite your

502
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,030
mind and your emotions.
And he thought about that as a male

503
00:28:24,031 --> 00:28:27,210
female pairing symbolically.
Now that's how it would manifest itself

504
00:28:27,211 --> 00:28:30,900
sometimes in dreams.
So you take the masculine element and

505
00:28:30,901 --> 00:28:35,190
the feminine element,
the thinking and the emotion unite

506
00:28:35,191 --> 00:28:37,500
those.
And that makes you more like one thing.

507
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:38,670
Okay.
And now all of a sudden that's

508
00:28:38,671 --> 00:28:41,070
represented as symbolically mail,
that one thing,

509
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:44,640
and it unites with something else that's
now represented symbolically feminine

510
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,290
female,
that's the body.

511
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,870
So you take the mind,
emotion,

512
00:28:48,871 --> 00:28:51,450
integration and integrate that in your
body.

513
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:55,590
So what does that mean?
You act it out instead of just thinking.

514
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,320
So there's this philosophical idea
called a,

515
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,580
now I'm going to forget what it's
called.

516
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,180
It's a contradiction in action.
There's actually a technical term for

517
00:29:06,181 --> 00:29:07,770
it,
but that's when you think and believe

518
00:29:07,771 --> 00:29:08,604
something,
but you're,

519
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,000
but you don't act it out.
And so that means there's a dissociation

520
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:17,001
in you somehow between your abstract
representations and what you manifest in

521
00:29:17,851 --> 00:29:19,830
action.
While that's another form of

522
00:29:19,831 --> 00:29:22,110
discontinuity that isn't doing you any
good.

523
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,130
You know the driver's going one way and
the cars going the other and you won't

524
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:28,710
even be able to understand yourself if
you do that.

525
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,290
But even more,
you're not putting your principles into

526
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:34,770
practice so you're disassociated.
You're being is dissociated.

527
00:29:34,771 --> 00:29:37,980
So once you get your mind in your
emotions working together,

528
00:29:37,981 --> 00:29:40,710
then the next thing to do is to act that
out consistently.

529
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,020
So that was the second conjunction as
far as young was concerned.

530
00:29:44,021 --> 00:29:47,230
And then the third one was,
this is the tough one and this is the

531
00:29:47,231 --> 00:29:52,000
one that's related to phenomenology.
You erase the distinction between

532
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:54,880
yourself and the world.
Okay,

533
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,300
that's a tough one.
So imagine you're dealing with someone

534
00:29:58,301 --> 00:30:00,220
who's hoarding.
Now,

535
00:30:00,221 --> 00:30:04,540
people who are hoarding are often older
or neurologically damaged or they have

536
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:07,900
obsessive compulsive disorder.
But then you walk into their house and

537
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,300
there's like 10,000 things in their
house.

538
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:11,380
There's,
there's,

539
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,480
there's,
there's maybe a hundred boxes and you

540
00:30:13,481 --> 00:30:17,500
open up a box and in the box there's
some pens and some old passports and

541
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:22,390
some checks and their collection of
silver dollars and some hypodermic

542
00:30:22,391 --> 00:30:24,280
needles and some dustin,
you know,

543
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,080
a dead mouse and,
and,

544
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:30,100
and there's boxes and boxes and boxes.
It's like that in the house.

545
00:30:30,101 --> 00:30:33,250
It's absolute chaos in their absolute
chaos,

546
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,630
not order chaos.

547
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,140
And then you think is that their houses
that they're being,

548
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,890
is that their mind?
And the answer is there's no difference.

549
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,230
There's no difference.
So you know,

550
00:30:44,231 --> 00:30:44,921
I could say,
well,

551
00:30:44,921 --> 00:30:48,400
if you want to organize your psyche,
you could start by organizing your room

552
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,290
if they,
if that would be easier because maybe

553
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:53,260
you're a more concrete person and you
need something concrete to do.

554
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:57,340
So you go clean up under your bed and
you make your bed and you organize the

555
00:30:57,341 --> 00:31:00,580
papers on your desk and you think,
well just exactly what are you

556
00:31:00,581 --> 00:31:03,400
organizing?
Are you organizing the objective world

557
00:31:03,401 --> 00:31:07,210
or are you objecting your field?
Or are you organizing your field of

558
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:09,850
being like your field of total
experience?

559
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:13,780
And young believed that.
And I think there's a Buddhist doctrine

560
00:31:13,781 --> 00:31:17,230
that sort of nested in there that at the
highest level of psychological

561
00:31:17,231 --> 00:31:20,290
integration,
there's no difference between you and

562
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:21,610
what you experience.

563
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:23,260
Now you think,
well,

564
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,600
I can't control everything I
experienced,

565
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:28,910
but that's no objection because you
can't control yourself anyways.

566
00:31:28,911 --> 00:31:33,100
So the mere fact that you can't extend
control over everything you experience

567
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:37,210
is no argument against the idea that you
should still treat that as an extension

568
00:31:37,211 --> 00:31:38,740
of yourself.
So you could say,

569
00:31:38,741 --> 00:31:41,740
well,
let's say you have a longstanding feud

570
00:31:41,741 --> 00:31:45,670
with your brother while sat a
psychological problem.

571
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,160
Is that him?
Is it a problem in the objective world?

572
00:31:48,161 --> 00:31:51,040
Or is,
is it a problem in your field of being?

573
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:54,640
And it's very useful to think that way
because you might ask,

574
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,730
what could you do to improve yourself?
Well,

575
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,850
let's step one step backwards.
The first question might be,

576
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:03,280
why should you even bother improving
yourself?

577
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,010
And I think the answer to that is
something like,

578
00:32:06,011 --> 00:32:09,400
so you don't suffer any more stupidly
than you have to.

579
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:11,770
And maybe so others don't have to
either.

580
00:32:11,771 --> 00:32:13,240
It's something like that,
you know,

581
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:15,250
like there's a real injunction at the
bottom of it.

582
00:32:15,251 --> 00:32:20,251
It's not some casual self-help doctrine.
It's that if you don't organize yourself

583
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:23,560
properly,
you'll pay for it and in a big way.

584
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,530
And so will the people around you now
and you could say,

585
00:32:26,531 --> 00:32:27,760
well,
I don't care about that,

586
00:32:27,761 --> 00:32:30,670
but that's actually not true.
You actually do care about that because

587
00:32:30,671 --> 00:32:33,010
if you're in pain,
you will care about it.

588
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,790
And so you do care about it,
even if it's just that negative way,

589
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:37,850
you know?
Um,

590
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:41,840
it's very rare that you can find someone
who's in excruciating pain who would

591
00:32:41,841 --> 00:32:43,700
ever say,
well,

592
00:32:43,701 --> 00:32:48,380
it would be no better if I was out of
this sort of pain is one of those things

593
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:53,240
that brings the idea that it would be
better if it didn't exist along with it.

594
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,360
It's in controvertible so you get your
act together so that there isn't any

595
00:32:58,371 --> 00:33:00,740
more stupid pain around you than
necessary.

596
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,360
Well,
so then the question might be,

597
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:04,040
well,
how would you go about getting your act

598
00:33:04,041 --> 00:33:05,480
together?
And the answer to that,

599
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,570
and this is a phenomenological idea too,
it's something like,

600
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:13,160
look around for something that bothers
you and see if you can fix it.

601
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,890
So now you think,
well,

602
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:19,100
let's say there,
let's say you go into a,

603
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,400
you can do this in a room.
It's quite fun to do it just when you're

604
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:23,780
sitting in a room,
like a room,

605
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:26,060
maybe your bedroom,
you can sit there and just sort of

606
00:33:26,061 --> 00:33:26,990
meditate on it.
Think,

607
00:33:26,991 --> 00:33:30,380
okay,
if I wanted to spend 10 minutes making

608
00:33:30,381 --> 00:33:33,350
this room better,
what would I have to do?

609
00:33:33,351 --> 00:33:35,060
And you have to ask yourself that,
right?

610
00:33:35,061 --> 00:33:37,610
It's not a command.
It's like our genuine question and

611
00:33:37,611 --> 00:33:41,240
things will pop out in the room that you
know you like there's a stack of papers

612
00:33:41,241 --> 00:33:44,390
over there that's kind of bugging you
and you know that maybe little order

613
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:46,730
there would be a good thing and you know
you haven't,

614
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,300
there's some rubbish behind your
computer monitor that you haven't

615
00:33:50,301 --> 00:33:54,230
attended to for like six months and the
room would be slightly better if it was

616
00:33:54,231 --> 00:33:57,290
a little less dusty in the cables
weren't all tangled up the same way.

617
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:02,090
And like if you,
if you allow yourself just to consider

618
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:05,720
the expanse in which you exist at that
moment,

619
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:09,650
there'll be all sorts of things that'll
pop out in it that you could just fix.

620
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,630
And you know,
I might say,

621
00:34:11,631 --> 00:34:14,180
well if you were coming to see me for
psychotherapy,

622
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:18,050
this easiest thing for us to do first
would just be to get you to organize

623
00:34:18,051 --> 00:34:19,340
your room.
You think,

624
00:34:19,341 --> 00:34:21,740
well is that psychotherapy?
And the answer is,

625
00:34:21,741 --> 00:34:24,440
well,
it depends on how you conceive the

626
00:34:24,441 --> 00:34:29,441
limits of your being.
And I would say start where you can

627
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:30,800
start.
You know,

628
00:34:30,970 --> 00:34:33,590
if,
if something announces itself to you,

629
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,450
which is a strange way of thinking about
it,

630
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,870
as in need of repair that you could
repair,

631
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,940
then hey,
fix it.

632
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:45,290
You fix a hundred things like that,
your life will be a lot different.

633
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:48,620
Now,
I often tell people to fix the things

634
00:34:48,621 --> 00:34:52,130
you repeat every day because people tend
to think of those as trivial,

635
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:53,323
right?

636
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,160
You get up,
you brush your teeth,

637
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,900
you have your breakfast,
you know you,

638
00:34:56,901 --> 00:34:59,180
you have your routines that you go
through every day.

639
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,930
Well though those probably constitute
50% of your life.

640
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,071
And people think,
well,

641
00:35:04,071 --> 00:35:05,990
they're mundane.
I don't need to pay attention to them.

642
00:35:05,991 --> 00:35:06,501
It's like,
no,

643
00:35:06,501 --> 00:35:07,640
no,
that's exactly wrong.

644
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,060
The things you do every day,
those are the most important things you

645
00:35:11,061 --> 00:35:14,390
do hands down.
All you have to do is do the arithmetic.

646
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:20,010
You figure it out right away.
So a hundred adjustments to your broader

647
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,930
domain of being and there's a lot less
rubbish.

648
00:35:23,931 --> 00:35:26,650
And there's a lot of less rubbish around
it,

649
00:35:26,651 --> 00:35:31,651
a lot fewer traps for you to step into.
And so that's in keeping with ewing's

650
00:35:32,601 --> 00:35:36,620
idea about erasing the dis.
Once you've got your mind and your

651
00:35:36,621 --> 00:35:39,330
emotions together,
and once you're acting that out,

652
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:44,660
then you can extend what you're willing
to consider yourself and start fixing up

653
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:48,720
the things that are part of your broader
extent.

654
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,460
Now sometimes you don't know how to do
that.

655
00:35:50,461 --> 00:35:52,920
So you might say,
imagine you're walking down bloor street

656
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:56,610
and there's this guy who's like
alcoholic and schizophrenia and has been

657
00:35:56,611 --> 00:35:59,580
on the streets for 10 years.
He sorta stumbled towards you and you

658
00:35:59,581 --> 00:36:01,590
know,
incoherently mutters something.

659
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:06,150
That's a problem.
And it would be good if you could fix

660
00:36:06,151 --> 00:36:07,770
it,
but you haven't got a clue about how to

661
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:11,490
fix that.
You just walk around that and go find

662
00:36:11,491 --> 00:36:14,490
something that you could fix.
Because if you muck about in that,

663
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,220
not only is it unlikely that you'll help
that person,

664
00:36:17,221 --> 00:36:19,530
it's very likely that you'll get hurt
yourself.

665
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:23,610
So you know,
just because while you're experiencing

666
00:36:23,611 --> 00:36:26,280
things,
announced themselves as in need of

667
00:36:26,281 --> 00:36:27,810
repair,
doesn't mean that it's,

668
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:30,390
you write that in there that should
repair them.

669
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:32,790
You have to have some humility.
You know,

670
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,060
you don't walk up to a helicopter that
isn't working and just start tinkering

671
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:36,894
away with it.

672
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:39,480
You have to stay within your domain of
competence.

673
00:36:39,481 --> 00:36:42,210
But most of the time if people look at
their lives,

674
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:45,780
you know,
it's very interesting thing to do.

675
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,450
I liked the,
I liked the idea of the room because you

676
00:36:48,451 --> 00:36:50,620
can do that at the drop of a hat.
You know,

677
00:36:50,621 --> 00:36:52,650
we'd go back to where you live and sit
down and think,

678
00:36:52,651 --> 00:36:55,380
okay,
I'm going to make this place better for

679
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:59,970
half an hour.
What should I do it they have to ask and

680
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:03,870
things will just pop up like mad.
And it's partly because your mind is a

681
00:37:03,871 --> 00:37:06,090
very strange thing.
As soon as you give it a name,

682
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:10,110
a genuine aim,
it'll reconfigure the world in keeping

683
00:37:10,111 --> 00:37:13,140
with that aim that that's actually how
you see to begin with.

684
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,770
And so if you set it a task,
especially if you have to be genuine

685
00:37:16,771 --> 00:37:18,870
about it,
which is why you have to bring your

686
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:22,830
thoughts and emotions together and then
you have to get them into your body so

687
00:37:22,831 --> 00:37:26,250
you're acting consistently,
you have to be genuine about the aim.

688
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:30,300
But once you aim,
the world will reconfigure itself around

689
00:37:30,301 --> 00:37:32,700
that aim,
which is very strange and,

690
00:37:32,701 --> 00:37:34,200
and it's,
it's,

691
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,990
it's technically true.
You know,

692
00:37:36,991 --> 00:37:41,100
the best example of that,
you have all seen this video where you

693
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:46,200
watch the basketballs being tossed back
and forth between members of the white

694
00:37:46,201 --> 00:37:48,840
team versus the black team.
And well,

695
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:51,150
you're doing that.
A gorilla walks up into the middle of

696
00:37:51,151 --> 00:37:52,830
the video and you don't see it.
It's like,

697
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,200
you know,
if you thought about that experiment for

698
00:37:55,201 --> 00:37:57,570
about five years,
that would be about the right amount of

699
00:37:57,571 --> 00:38:00,540
time to spend thinking about it.
Because what it shows you is that you

700
00:38:00,541 --> 00:38:05,130
see what you aim at and that man,
if you can get one thing through your

701
00:38:05,131 --> 00:38:08,430
head and as a consequence of even being
in university,

702
00:38:08,431 --> 00:38:10,530
that would be a good one.
You see what you a at.

703
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:15,830
And so because one
inference you might draw from that is be

704
00:38:16,201 --> 00:38:19,170
careful what you aim at.
Write it.

705
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,980
What you aim at determines the way the
world manifests itself to you.

706
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:27,750
And so if the world is manifesting
itself in a very negative way,

707
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:31,380
one thing to ask is,
are you aiming at the right thing?

708
00:38:31,381 --> 00:38:32,131
Now,
you know,

709
00:38:32,131 --> 00:38:36,220
I'm not trying to reduce everybody's
problems to an improper aim.

710
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,770
People get cut off at the knees for all
sorts of reasons.

711
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:39,790
You know,
they get sick,

712
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:42,840
they have accidents,
there's a random element to being,

713
00:38:42,841 --> 00:38:44,290
that's for sure.
But,

714
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,190
and so you don't want to take anything,
even that particular phrase too far.

715
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:52,030
You want to bind it with the fact that
random things do happen to people.

716
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:54,970
But it's still a great thing to ask.
Okay.

717
00:38:54,971 --> 00:38:58,090
So Rogers was a phenomenologist and he
was interested in,

718
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:03,450
he didn't start his philosophy from the
perspective of subject versus object or

719
00:39:04,361 --> 00:39:07,870
from the idea of psyche,
like sort of inside you,

720
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,580
your mind with its layers.

721
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:14,080
That's not how we looked at it.
And so let's go through,

722
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,800
well,
I'll introduce you to rogers.

723
00:39:17,801 --> 00:39:19,630
I think I'll,
and then we'll talk about it more next

724
00:39:19,631 --> 00:39:22,630
time.
I'm going to start with something that I

725
00:39:22,631 --> 00:39:26,290
learned from him that I think it was of
crucial importance and so we'll set the

726
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:29,080
stage for the further discussion with
with this,

727
00:39:29,081 --> 00:39:34,060
and I'm going to read it to you,
assuming a minimal mutual willingness to

728
00:39:34,061 --> 00:39:36,370
be in contact and to receive
communications,

729
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:40,420
we may say that the greater the commuted
con communicated congruence of

730
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:45,070
experience,
awareness and behavior on the part of

731
00:39:45,071 --> 00:39:47,830
one individual.
The more the ensuing relationship will

732
00:39:47,831 --> 00:39:51,850
involve a tendency towards reciprocal
communication with the same qualities,

733
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:56,080
mutually accurate understanding of the
communication's improved psychological

734
00:39:56,081 --> 00:39:59,590
adjustment and functioning in both
parties and mutual satisfaction in the

735
00:39:59,591 --> 00:40:02,020
relationship.
It's quite a mouthful.

736
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:05,920
What does it mean?
Assuming a minimal mutual willingness to

737
00:40:05,921 --> 00:40:08,320
be in contact and to receive
communications.

738
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,480
Okay,
we're having a conversation.

739
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:14,680
I'm deciding I'm going to listen to you.
Right?

740
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:17,950
That's different than the people,
how people generally communicate.

741
00:40:17,951 --> 00:40:21,160
Because usually when they communicate,
they're doing something like,

742
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,560
okay,
we're going to have a conversation and

743
00:40:23,561 --> 00:40:26,620
I'm going to tell you why I'm right and
all win.

744
00:40:26,621 --> 00:40:30,190
If you agree,
or maybe you're having a conversation

745
00:40:30,191 --> 00:40:31,960
where I don't know what you're trying to
do,

746
00:40:31,961 --> 00:40:34,630
maybe you're trying to impress the
person you're talking to so you're not

747
00:40:34,631 --> 00:40:36,340
listening to them at all.
You're just thinking about what you're

748
00:40:36,341 --> 00:40:37,990
gonna say next.
Okay,

749
00:40:37,991 --> 00:40:40,300
so that's not this.
This is,

750
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:45,540
you might have something to tell me and
so I'm going to listen on the off chance

751
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:49,390
that you'll tell me something that would
really be useful for me to know.

752
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,620
And so you could take about it as an,
as an extension of the Piagetian.

753
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:59,920
Piaget talks about the fundamental,
the fundamentally important element of

754
00:40:59,921 --> 00:41:02,680
knowledge being to describe how
knowledge is sought,

755
00:41:02,681 --> 00:41:04,600
the process by which knowledge is
generated.

756
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,470
Well,
if you agree with me and I find that

757
00:41:08,471 --> 00:41:10,360
out,
I know nothing more than I knew before.

758
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:14,170
I just know what I knew before and maybe
I'm happy about that because you know,

759
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:17,380
it didn't get challenged.
But I'm no smarter than I was before,

760
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:20,500
but maybe you're different than me.
And so while I'm listening to you'll

761
00:41:20,501 --> 00:41:22,360
tell me something I would,
I don't like,

762
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:25,510
maybe it's something I find contemptible
or difficult,

763
00:41:25,511 --> 00:41:27,040
whatever.
Maybe you'll find,

764
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:31,120
you'll tell me something I don't know
and then I won't be quite as stupid and

765
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:34,580
then maybe I won't run painfully quite
as many things.

766
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,770
And that's a really useful thing to
know,

767
00:41:36,771 --> 00:41:40,660
especially if you live with someone and
you're trying to make longterm piece

768
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,440
with them is they are not the same as
you.

769
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,890
And they're way they look at the world
in the facts that they pull out of the

770
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:47,510
world aren't the same as your facts.

771
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,220
And even though you're going to be
overwhelmed with the proclivity to

772
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:55,910
demonstrate that you're right,
it is the case that two brains are

773
00:41:55,911 --> 00:42:00,650
better than one.
And so maybe nine of the 10 things they

774
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:05,651
tell you are dispensable or maybe even
49 out of 50 but one thing,

775
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:09,320
all you need to get out of the damn
conversation is one thing you don't

776
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:11,720
know.
And one of the things that's very cool

777
00:42:11,721 --> 00:42:16,520
about a good psychotherapeutic session
is that the whole conversation is like

778
00:42:16,521 --> 00:42:21,521
that all you're doing is trying to
express the truth of the situation as

779
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:26,390
clearly as possible.
That's it.

780
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,200
And so now rogers' proposition,
and I'll tell you why he derived it,

781
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:38,300
was that if you have a conversation like
that with someone,

782
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:42,130
it will make both of you better.
It'll make both of you is

783
00:42:42,131 --> 00:42:45,470
psychologically healthier.
So there's an implicit presupposition

784
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:48,830
that the exchange of truth is curative.

785
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,900
Well,
that's a very cool idea.

786
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,790
I mean,
it's a very deep idea.

787
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:56,690
I think it's the most profound idea.
It's the,

788
00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:00,560
it's the idea upon western civil upon
which Western civilization,

789
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:04,970
although not only Western civilization,
is actually predicated the idea that

790
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:07,580
truth produces health.
But for Rogers,

791
00:43:07,581 --> 00:43:10,220
that was the entire purpose of the
psycho therapeutic alliance.

792
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:13,100
You come to see me because you want to
be better.

793
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:16,610
You don't even know what that means
necessarily.

794
00:43:16,611 --> 00:43:19,100
Neither do I.
We're going to figure that out together.

795
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:20,810
But you come and you say,
look,

796
00:43:20,811 --> 00:43:24,830
things are not acceptable to me.
And maybe there's something I could do

797
00:43:24,831 --> 00:43:27,230
about that.
So that's the minimal precondition to

798
00:43:27,231 --> 00:43:29,600
engage in therapy.
Something's wrong.

799
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,020
You're willing to talk about it
truthfully and you want it to be better.

800
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,470
Without that,
the therapeutic relationship does not

801
00:43:36,471 --> 00:43:38,660
get off the ground.
And so then you might ask,

802
00:43:38,661 --> 00:43:41,000
well,
what relationships are therapeutic and

803
00:43:41,001 --> 00:43:44,090
answer that would be if you have a real
relationship,

804
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,140
it's therapeutic.

805
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:48,050
If it isn't,
what you have is not a relationship.

806
00:43:48,051 --> 00:43:50,480
God only knows what you have.
You're a slave,

807
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:53,570
they're a tyrant,
you know you're both butting heads with

808
00:43:53,571 --> 00:43:55,970
one another.
It's a primate dominance hierarchy

809
00:43:55,971 --> 00:43:57,350
dispute.
Oh,

810
00:43:57,351 --> 00:43:59,360
I don't know.
You're like two cats in a barrel or two

811
00:43:59,361 --> 00:44:01,610
people with their hands around each
other's throats.

812
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:06,470
But what you have is not a relationship.
So all right,

813
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:10,010
we may say that the greater the
communicated congruence of experience,

814
00:44:10,011 --> 00:44:12,470
awareness and behavior on the part of
one individual,

815
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:15,170
that's,
that's a reference to the same idea that

816
00:44:15,171 --> 00:44:20,171
I was describing with regards to yoke.
So let's say you come and talk to me and

817
00:44:20,301 --> 00:44:22,760
you want things to go well,
well I'm going to have to more or less

818
00:44:22,761 --> 00:44:25,820
be one thing.
Because if I'm all over the place,

819
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:29,450
you can't trust any continuity in what I
say.

820
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:30,860
There's no end.

821
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:34,500
There's no reason for you to believe
that I'm capable of actually telling you

822
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,650
I'm capable of expressing anything.
That's true.

823
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:42,150
So the truth is something that emerges
as a consequences of getting yourself

824
00:44:42,151 --> 00:44:46,560
lined up and beating all the,
what would you call

825
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,300
all the impurities out of your,
out of your,

826
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:55,200
out of your soul for black of a better
word.

827
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:57,660
You have to be integrated for that to
happen.

828
00:44:57,661 --> 00:45:00,240
And you do that at least in part by
wanting to tell the truth.

829
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:04,980
The more the ensuing relationship will
involve a tendency towards reciprocal

830
00:45:04,981 --> 00:45:09,630
communication with the same qualities.
So one of the things that I've been

831
00:45:09,631 --> 00:45:12,510
quite influenced by Rogers,
one of the things I tried to do in my

832
00:45:12,511 --> 00:45:17,270
therapeutic sessions is first of all to
listen to really listen and then well,

833
00:45:17,271 --> 00:45:20,310
well I listen,
I watch and well I'm listening.

834
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:22,890
Things will happen in my head,
you know,

835
00:45:22,891 --> 00:45:26,310
maybe I'll get a little image of
something or I'll get a thought or a

836
00:45:26,311 --> 00:45:29,280
question will emerge and then I'll just
tell the person what that is.

837
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:31,020
But it's sort of directionless,
you know?

838
00:45:31,021 --> 00:45:34,590
It's not like I have a goal except that
we're trying to make things better.

839
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:38,070
I'm on the side of the person,
I'm on the side of the part of the

840
00:45:38,071 --> 00:45:40,920
person that wants things to be better,
not worse.

841
00:45:41,610 --> 00:45:45,540
And so then those parts of us have a
dialogue and the consequence of that

842
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:48,810
dialogue is that certain things take
place and then I'll just tell the person

843
00:45:48,811 --> 00:45:51,360
what happened.
And it isn't that I'm right.

844
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:55,050
That's not the point.
The point is is that they get to have an

845
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:57,810
hour where someone actually tells them
what they think.

846
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,900
Here's the impact you're having on me.
You know,

847
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,840
this is making me angry.
This is making me happy.

848
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,720
This is really interesting.
This reminds me of something that you

849
00:46:06,721 --> 00:46:09,010
said an hour ago that I don't quite
understand.

850
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:13,740
And the whole,
the whole point is not for either person

851
00:46:13,741 --> 00:46:18,540
to make the proposition or convince the
other that their position is correct,

852
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:23,690
but merely to have an exchange of
experience about how things are set up.

853
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:28,320
And it's extraordinarily useful for
people because it's often difficult for

854
00:46:28,321 --> 00:46:31,320
anyone to find anyone to talk to that
will actually listen.

855
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,220
And so another thing that's really
strange about this listening is that if

856
00:46:35,221 --> 00:46:37,590
you listen to people,
they will tell you the weirdest bloody

857
00:46:37,591 --> 00:46:40,350
things so fast.
You just cannot believe it.

858
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:43,500
So if you're having a conversation with
someone and it's dull,

859
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:47,760
it's because you're stupid.
That's why you're not listening to them

860
00:46:47,761 --> 00:46:52,170
properly because they're weird.
They're like wombats or albatrosses or

861
00:46:52,171 --> 00:46:55,170
rhinoceroses or something like they're
strange creatures.

862
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:58,680
And so if you are actually communicating
with them and they were telling you how

863
00:46:58,681 --> 00:47:00,750
weird they really are,
it would be,

864
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:04,020
it would be anything but boring.
So,

865
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,960
and you can ask questions.
That's a really good way of listening.

866
00:47:06,961 --> 00:47:09,900
But you know,
one of Roger's points is,

867
00:47:09,901 --> 00:47:11,520
well,
you have to be oriented properly in

868
00:47:11,521 --> 00:47:12,354
order to listen.

869
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:15,450
And the orientation has to be,
look what I want out of this

870
00:47:15,451 --> 00:47:19,050
conversation is that the place we both
end up is better than the place we left.

871
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:21,300
That's it.
That's what I'm after.

872
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:24,300
And if you're not after that,
you've got to think why the hell

873
00:47:24,301 --> 00:47:27,720
wouldn't you be after that?
What could you possibly be after that

874
00:47:27,721 --> 00:47:31,780
would be better than that?
You walk away smarter and more well

875
00:47:31,781 --> 00:47:35,500
equipped for the world than you were
before you had the conversation.

876
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:38,920
And so does the other person.
Well maybe if you're bitter and

877
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:41,410
resentful and angry and anxious and you
know,

878
00:47:41,470 --> 00:47:45,070
generally annoyed at the world,
then that isn't what you want.

879
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:48,610
You want the other person to walk away
worse than Youtube because you're full

880
00:47:48,611 --> 00:47:52,330
of revenge,
but you know you'll get what you want if

881
00:47:52,331 --> 00:47:56,920
you do that.
So we know from our research that such

882
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:00,730
empathic understanding is already
defined that I want to hear you.

883
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:04,330
I want to hear what you have to say so
we can clarify it and move forward.

884
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:07,570
I want to have your best interests in
mind and mine as well.

885
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:10,960
But you know both at the same time and
your families too.

886
00:48:10,961 --> 00:48:13,870
If we could manage that,
we're after making things better.

887
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,410
We know from our research that such
empathic understanding,

888
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:19,630
understanding with a person,
not about him.

889
00:48:19,631 --> 00:48:22,510
It's such an effective approach that it
can bring about major changes in

890
00:48:22,511 --> 00:48:25,480
personality.
Some of you may be feeling that you

891
00:48:25,481 --> 00:48:28,270
listen well to people and that you have
never seen such results.

892
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:32,170
The chances are very great that you have
not been listening in the manner that

893
00:48:32,171 --> 00:48:33,790
I've described.
Fortunately,

894
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:37,750
I can suggest a little experiment that
you can do to test the quality of your

895
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:40,480
understanding.
The next time you get into an argument

896
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:44,020
with your wife or your friend or a small
group of friends stopped the discussion

897
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:47,080
for a moment and for an experiment
institute this rule.

898
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:52,990
Each person can speak up for himself
only after he has first restated the

899
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:57,280
ideas and feelings of the previous
speaker accurately would accurately

900
00:48:57,281 --> 00:49:00,310
means is they have to agree with your
restatement.

901
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:04,660
Now that's an annoying thing to do
because if someone is talking to you and

902
00:49:04,661 --> 00:49:06,880
you disagree with them,
the first thing you want to do is take

903
00:49:06,881 --> 00:49:09,370
their argument,
make the stupidest possible thing out of

904
00:49:09,371 --> 00:49:11,560
it that you can.
That's the straw man,

905
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:15,310
and then demolish it.
It's like so then you can walk away

906
00:49:15,311 --> 00:49:19,960
feeling good about it and you know you
primate diamonds dominated them really

907
00:49:19,961 --> 00:49:20,794
nicely,
so,

908
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:22,690
but that isn't what you do.
You say,

909
00:49:22,691 --> 00:49:24,490
okay,
well I'm going to take what you told me

910
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:27,670
and maybe I'm even going to make your
argument stronger than the one you made.

911
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:30,520
That's useful if you're dealing with
someone that you have to live with

912
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:33,340
because maybe they can't bloody well
express themselves very well,

913
00:49:33,341 --> 00:49:37,320
but they have something to say so you
make their argument strong.

914
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:40,480
All right?
Then you see what this would mean.

915
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,630
It would mean that before presenting
your own point of view,

916
00:49:43,631 --> 00:49:46,750
it'd be necessary for you to really
achieve the other speakers frame of

917
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:50,530
reference to understand his thoughts and
feelings so well that you could

918
00:49:50,531 --> 00:49:53,140
summarize them for him.
Sounds simple,

919
00:49:53,141 --> 00:49:55,540
doesn't it?
But if you will try it,

920
00:49:55,541 --> 00:49:59,080
you'll find that it's the most difficult
thing that you've ever done.

921
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:00,610
Okay,
good.

922
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:02,650
We'll leave it at that and then we'll
see you on Tuesday.
