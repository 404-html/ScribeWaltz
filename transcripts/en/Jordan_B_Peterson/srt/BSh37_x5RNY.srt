1
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:07,910
Okay,
so we're going to wrap up Freud today.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,333
So Freud
occupies a strange position in the 

3
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:22,410
history of psychology because Freud 
wasn't a psychologist,

4
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:23,244
he was a medical doctor,
and many of the people whose theories 

5
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:30,720
were discussing that work clinicians 
were mds,

6
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,583
not psychologists.
Well then of course when Freud was 

7
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:34,980
around,
at least when he was trading,

8
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,010
psychology hadn't yet become an 
independent science.

9
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:39,683
Now the same was true of Yom,
and part of the consequence of that was 

10
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:43,734
that when the new science of psychology 
developed into what you're studying 

11
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:48,534
today is psychoanalysts and the medical 
community basically stayed outside of 

12
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:54,750
that.
And there's never really been a

13
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,083
meeting of the minds between 
experimental psychologists and 

14
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:00,923
psychoanalysts.
Although by the 1980s the cognitive 

15
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:09,720
psychologists were promoting their 
discovery of the cognitive unconscious,

16
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,810
which always felt to me a little bit 
ungrateful given that Freud had actually

17
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,860
laid the groundwork for the theory of 
the unconscious or an elaborated that in

18
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:21,870
quite great detail,
you know,

19
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,000
almost a hundred years before there's,
there's some resistance in this.

20
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,990
And that's what a psychoanalyst would 
say.

21
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,953
There is some resistance among the 
experimental psychology community to 

22
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:34,620
Credit Freud with any of his real 
discoveries.

23
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:35,454
And I think that's very unfortunate,
partly because he did make the 

24
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:41,130
discoveries.
And B,

25
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,260
the psychoanalysts still understand more
about the nature of the unconscious than

26
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:47,094
modern experimental psychologists 
because modern experimental 

27
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:50,694
psychologists insist on viewing the 
brain as that cognitive processors 

28
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:58,230
something like a computer.
And that isn't what it is.

29
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,850
It's a living system composed of other 
living subsystems.

30
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,840
And that means that as we've discussed 
already,

31
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:07,883
that the human psyche and its 
subordinate components are better 

32
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:13,224
conceived of as personalities and 
subpersonalities then in any other 

33
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:17,844
manner then in systems or an or an 
information or that information 

34
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:23,160
processing machines.
And it's,

35
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,080
it's,
it's,

36
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:24,923
I think perhaps the most fundamental 
accomplishment of psycho analysis 

37
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:34,020
following Nicha actually to view the 
human mind,

38
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:39,021
the human psyche as a place of 
relatively integrated subpersonalities,

39
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:42,270
um,
mean

40
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,410
when even when modern people talk about 
themselves,

41
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:49,800
they talk about the eye,
which would be roughly the ego in Friday

42
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:50,634
and terms,
they tend to think of themselves as a 

43
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:52,614
unitary.

44
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,753
So nomina but
the problem with that notion is that 

45
00:02:58,381 --> 00:02:59,214
people continually do things that they 
find themselves doing things that in 

46
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:03,214
principle they don't want to do or 
things that they're ashamed of or lying 

47
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:09,550
when they don't want a liar,
generally misbehaving.

48
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:10,384
And so also of course everybody's 
observations that you can try to tell 

49
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:16,540
yourself what to do,
but that doesn't work very well.

50
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,560
So you know you've experienced this 
undoubtedly in your own life many,

51
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:24,040
many times when you're sitting down and 
you're trying to study for something,

52
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,290
particularly if you're not very 
interested in it,

53
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,573
they had all sorts of alternative 
possibilities will make themselves 

54
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,070
manifest in your,
in the theater of your,

55
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:37,840
of your imagination.
And in a sense what's happening in those

56
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:42,841
situations is that
parts of you that that are organized,

57
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,740
organized around other goals or from the
authority perspective,

58
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:48,574
say driven by other desires are trying 
to hijack control of your motor output 

59
00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:00,210
and that frequently happens so that you 
find yourself,

60
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:01,624
for example,
procrastinating or rationalizing or 

61
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,993
displacing,
those are all Freudian concepts at 

62
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:12,550
displacement would be instead of doing 
the work you're supposed to do,

63
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:14,020
you go off and do some other work.

64
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,650
No,
it's not a bad way of procrastinating,

65
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:18,484
but it's not great because you're not 
focusing on what you should be focusing 

66
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:22,624
on.
And so in some sense you're at war with 

67
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:27,910
yourself and the major player in the 
war,

68
00:04:27,911 --> 00:04:29,860
at least in principle,
is the ego.

69
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,783
And that would be equivalent to Freud's 
conscious money that at least in the 

70
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,533
initial phases of his theory,
it's somewhat complicated to talk about 

71
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:38,044
Freud because of course it's theory 
developed across time and in the 

72
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:41,854
beginning he basically broke the mind up
into the conscious mind and the 

73
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:47,530
unconscious mind.
And you can think of the conscious mind,

74
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,903
well that's you.
Essentially that's the you that you can 

75
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,904
refer to during day to day experience.
And then the unconscious mind is a 

76
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:56,614
storehouse of two broad classes of 
phenomena and one would be drives that 

77
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:06,034
are grounded in instinct that are either
at odds with your current goal or 

78
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,120
memories often traumatic that you 
haven't been able to integrate into your

79
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,410
conscious framework.

80
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,020
And so those pesky things take on their 
own life.

81
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,113
You know,
if you,

82
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,493
if you take an animal,
then you take out increasingly large 

83
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,643
segments of its cortex,
say the animal still organizes itself 

84
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:39,730
into that animal,
like it starts to lose function,

85
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:40,564
especially if you go deep into the brain
and you can kill an animal if you go 

86
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:46,150
deep into the brain.
But if you stay on the cortical surface,

87
00:05:46,151 --> 00:05:46,984
you can take an awful lot of brain 
tissue out without interfering with a 

88
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:52,750
lot of the animal's ability to sustain 
itself.

89
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:56,560
And what that shows is that the brain is
organized in such a way.

90
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:57,394
So that isolated components of it,
we'll take on a function of the entire 

91
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:06,030
personality,
not demonstration in some sense that the

92
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:10,230
sub elements of the,
of the psyche or or perhaps subsystems,

93
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,930
subsystems of the brain can organize 
themselves into functional living units.

94
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,210
And it stands to reason.
I mean if you lose an arm,

95
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,044
you don't stop functioning.
You just reorganize your personality 

96
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,520
minus the arm.
And if you,

97
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,773
you,
if,

98
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,673
if you have only managed to integrate a 
certain subset of the potential psychic 

99
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:29,804
manifestations of your mind,
then that subset is going to formulate 

100
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:35,054
the main personality.
But all the other things that you're 

101
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:37,154
ignoring or can't integrate,
they're going to have a life of their 

102
00:06:38,661 --> 00:06:40,790
own.
They don't just disappear.

103
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,493
And so Freud offers the unsettling idea 
that you're by no means master in your 

104
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:48,614
own house.
And one of the ways you can determine 

105
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:54,020
that is by watching yourself do things 
that you don't want to do.

106
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,380
And those are things,
for example,

107
00:06:57,381 --> 00:06:58,214
that you'd have a hard time facing up to
because of course most of the things 

108
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,544
that you don't want to do are things 
that you might be ashamed of or anxious 

109
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:05,030
about.

110
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,630
And then of course there's the defeat 
that you suffer when you,

111
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,350
when your ego is hypothetically and 
control of the circumstance and you find

112
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:13,184
your behavior or your thoughts directed 
in some direction under the control of 

113
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,960
something that you think that you've 
mastered.

114
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,960
You can really see this in conditions 
like anorexia.

115
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,140
So especially if it's accompanied by 
Bulemia,

116
00:07:27,141 --> 00:07:29,810
which it often is.
So anorexia is a,

117
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:30,943
an eating disorder that causes people,
I think essentially become extremely 

118
00:07:34,281 --> 00:07:35,114
disgusted with their own physiology,
with their own physical being and warps 

119
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,210
their perceptions terribly.
So,

120
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,420
um,
I had,

121
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,253
uh,
uh,

122
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,880
an anorexic client at one point and um,
she was a rather small woman,

123
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,530
maybe five,
two or something like that,

124
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,633
quite thin.
Obviously she had anorexia and I asked 

125
00:07:55,461 --> 00:07:59,870
her what she was in my office if her 
thigh was bigger or smaller than mine.

126
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,190
And she said,
well,

127
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:02,690
it was about the same size.

128
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,793
So I took a piece of paper and I'm sat 
on at 10 I drew the outline of my thigh 

129
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,840
on it.
And then I had her sit on the same piece

130
00:08:11,841 --> 00:08:14,300
of paper and she drew the outline of her
thigh.

131
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:17,840
And of course there was probably that 
much space on both sides between the two

132
00:08:17,841 --> 00:08:18,674
outlines,
which probably looked at that for 15 

133
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:21,740
minutes.
You know,

134
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,633
she,
she could not believe that that could 

135
00:08:24,081 --> 00:08:24,914
possibly be the case.
And I think what happens in our 

136
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:31,160
anorexics is that they stopped being 
able to look at their whole bodies.

137
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,280
So when you,
when you look at yourself in the mirror,

138
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,090
you kind of have to look in a gestalt 
manner.

139
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:41,240
You have to get a picture of the whole.
Alternatively,

140
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:45,140
you can focus on small parts,
but the more you focus on parts,

141
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:48,440
the more difficult it is to see the 
parts in relationship to the hole.

142
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:49,723
And anorexics get unbelievably focused 
on small elements and they confuse 

143
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:55,590
themselves.
So for example,

144
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:58,410
if they're looking at their arms and 
there's some flesh on it,

145
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,043
they,
they are unable to make a distinction 

146
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:06,030
between the flesh and fat.
And they want no fat,

147
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,980
they want to go right down to the bone 
and they can't because they're concerned

148
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:11,814
about that tiny little part or maybe 
this tiny little park or wherever they 

149
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:15,684
happen to be focused there.
They get completely unable to perceive 

150
00:09:18,181 --> 00:09:22,470
their own bodies and it's quite striking
how far that can go.

151
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,410
And then the believe mick end of it is,
well the,

152
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,300
the person will starve themselves for a 
long period of time.

153
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,613
And of course we'll think about this and
modern physiological terms feeding 

154
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:38,070
behavior is regulated by the 
hypothalamus.

155
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:38,904
And that's a,
that's an ancient brain area that the 

156
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,403
controls fundamental motivational 
systems and it's right above the spinal 

157
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:45,840
cord and it's a very,
very,

158
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:48,570
very powerful center of Control in the 
brain.

159
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,270
It's functional enough.
I think I told you this before,

160
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:52,104
that if you take a cat and you take off 
its entire cortex and even most of its 

161
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:56,574
emotional systems,
if you leave it just with the 

162
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:58,464
hypothalamus and the spinal cord,
which basically means it has almost no 

163
00:10:00,661 --> 00:10:01,494
brain,
it can organize its behavior almost 

164
00:10:03,331 --> 00:10:05,730
perfectly as long as you keep it in a 
simple environment.

165
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:10,260
So anyways,
the anorexic attempts to starve.

166
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,053
But so that's a conscious goal you might
say or or that might be an ego related 

167
00:10:17,191 --> 00:10:18,024
goal.
Or You could even think about it as a 

168
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:19,734
goal that's motivated by other 
unconscious forces because maybe she 

169
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:24,870
doesn't know exactly why she wants to 
start.

170
00:10:24,871 --> 00:10:25,704
But in any case,
what generally happens is she'll run 

171
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:34,050
into an emotionally upsetting situation 
now,

172
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,300
emotional upset,
act,

173
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:37,134
say it,
it makes you anxious or it puts you in 

174
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:42,510
emotional pain that activates higher 
brain centers then the hypothalamus,

175
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:43,650
but they're still pretty low.

176
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:44,483
There's still pretty primordial.
And one of the things that kind of 

177
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:49,500
emotional upset does,
let's call it stress,

178
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,550
is shut off your longterm planning.
And the reason for that is,

179
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:56,070
is that if you're stressed in the,
in the,

180
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,180
in,
in the immediate,

181
00:10:57,181 --> 00:10:58,014
now your body and brain presume that you
should devote divert resources from the 

182
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:06,900
hypothetical future to solving the 
problem that's right in front of you.

183
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,420
And that's often a more behaviorally 
oriented,

184
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,450
uh,
solution like freezing or withdrawing or

185
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:13,284
something like that.
So it shuts off your prefrontal cortex 

186
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,710
on.
As soon as that happens,

187
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:19,500
then the hypothalamus,
which is as I said,

188
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:24,360
a very powerful system just reaches up 
in some sense and dominates the person.

189
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,090
I mean it's been there for God only 
knows how long,

190
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:27,924
you know,
tens of millions of years and it's job 

191
00:11:30,061 --> 00:11:33,270
is to stop you from starving to death.
And you know,

192
00:11:33,271 --> 00:11:36,150
you could imagine that over the course 
of evolutionary history,

193
00:11:36,151 --> 00:11:41,070
anybody who had a relatively weak 
feeding instinct died.

194
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,323
And so they were at our ancestors.
And so what happens to the Baleen is 

195
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:50,850
something will upset them and then 
they'll get an uncontrollable desire for

196
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,220
often something that's high calorie and 
sweet and full of fat,

197
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,083
logically enough because they're 
starving and then they'll eat like a 

198
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:59,140
whole quart of ice cream in two loaves 
of bread.

199
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,660
And you know,
they described the state that they're in

200
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:04,510
while they're doing that as dissociated,
you know,

201
00:12:04,511 --> 00:12:07,180
it doesn't feel like them.
Well,

202
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,103
you can imagine why in some sense,
I mean partly is the whole realm of 

203
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:15,130
eating behavior and it eating is as some
personality.

204
00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:17,140
It's not just a behavior and it's not a 
drive.

205
00:12:17,141 --> 00:12:19,810
Like when you think about when you're 
hungry,

206
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:25,410
it's not like your brain is moving.
You literally step by determined step.

207
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,453
It's that you start fantasizing about 
food and you start thinking about what 

208
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:30,940
you may be wanting.

209
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,773
Then you start to make plans about where
you're going to go or how you're going 

210
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:36,340
to cook it and what social,
you know,

211
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:39,550
what social surroundings going to be in 
a whole bunch of things.

212
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,050
And that's,
that's the hungry you well in an,

213
00:12:43,051 --> 00:12:43,884
in an anorexic or Bulimic,
the hungry part of the person is so 

214
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:50,830
dissociated from the part,
the ego part,

215
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:51,664
but they're basically in a war.
But one of the problems with being in a 

216
00:12:54,461 --> 00:12:57,910
war with your hypothalamus is that it 
almost always wins and it's a good thing

217
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,920
because otherwise you die.
You know,

218
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:02,920
and lots of anorexic stu manage to 
starve themselves to death.

219
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:08,520
And so that's a good example of just 
exactly how dissociable the mind can be.

220
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:09,394
And the mind is,
is also the brain is dissociable in the 

221
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:15,550
strangest possible ways.
So here's an example.

222
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,550
I don't remember the name of this 
syndrome,

223
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:19,780
it might pop into my mind.

224
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,470
But so you can have a particular kind of
stroke.

225
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,633
And here's the effect of the stroke.
You develop the fixed delusion that a 

226
00:13:30,371 --> 00:13:33,490
person who's very close to you capgras 
syndrome,

227
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,940
a person who's very close to you has 
been,

228
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:37,803
has died or being kidnapped or somehow 
disappeared and has been replaced by 

229
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:46,561
their exact double.
And so and so it's obviously something,

230
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,040
it manifests itself as something akin to
psychosis.

231
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,353
And what happens is that the stroke 
damages the relationship between the 

232
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:02,200
generally the visual systems that 
identify faces and the emotional systems

233
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,880
that tag that identified face with 
familiar emotions.

234
00:14:05,881 --> 00:14:06,714
So basically what happens is,
let's say it happens to you and it's 

235
00:14:08,861 --> 00:14:10,780
your mother,
you look at your mother,

236
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,670
but it isn't your mother.
You know,

237
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:16,720
your mother comes with a whole complex 
of memories and you know,

238
00:14:16,721 --> 00:14:20,920
she's sat in there in a very broad 
context of memory and emotion.

239
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,770
And then you look at this person and it 
looks like your mother,

240
00:14:23,771 --> 00:14:24,604
but none of that is happening.
And so then you develop this idea as 

241
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:28,600
well,
if it's not my mother,

242
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,434
it looks exactly like my mother.
Well then what could possibly be going 

243
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:32,464
on in the answer as well?
Obviously she's being taken away and 

244
00:14:36,371 --> 00:14:37,204
replaced by her exact duplicate.
People get into real trouble with this 

245
00:14:39,731 --> 00:14:43,510
sort of delusion as you might imagine,
because they get obsessed with trying to

246
00:14:43,511 --> 00:14:46,210
solve the problem.
Like what did you do with my mother?

247
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:48,340
And you can understand why,
but here's the,

248
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,470
here's a weirder thing even,
which is that it's,

249
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,960
it's modality specific so that if they 
listened to their mother on the phone,

250
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,390
that's their mother.
So,

251
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,360
so you see exactly how dissociable the 
brain is.

252
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,030
The mind is even down to small,
um,

253
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:08,630
sub function.
So there are people with strokes who can

254
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:10,310
sing,
but who can't talk.

255
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,000
And there are people who lose nouns and 
there are people who lose only versed.

256
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,860
And there are people who can identify 
things,

257
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:16,694
but they can't name them.
So the idea that the brain is a 

258
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:25,451
dissociable entity is obviously correct.
And here's another example of it.

259
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,510
While you dissociate all the time.
Now,

260
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:32,900
if you look at the way the brain is 
structured,

261
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,890
so there's a strip right about here 
called the motor strip.

262
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:37,963
And if you are doing brain surgery and 
you touch someone with an electrode on 

263
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:41,954
that strip,
they'll move the corresponding part of 

264
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,430
the body.
And the hands are very,

265
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,264
very overrepresented.
And so is the face and the lips and the 

266
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:53,720
tongue for obvious reasons.
We fiddle around with the world a lot.

267
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,170
We move our arms and our hands a lot.
The feed are overrepresented too.

268
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,460
And then we communicate about that with 
our face and our count.

269
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,380
So there's huge representation there.
Um,

270
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,770
so,
and if you touch that,

271
00:16:06,771 --> 00:16:10,130
you'll get a mo emotion,
or at least the person who will will,

272
00:16:10,131 --> 00:16:10,964
um,
describe a strong impulse to move well 

273
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,660
out of that grew the prefrontal cortex.
And the best way to think of what people

274
00:16:17,661 --> 00:16:22,340
think about that as the substrate of 
abstract thought.

275
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,293
It's not really a good way of thinking 
about it because you're not really out 

276
00:16:26,661 --> 00:16:27,494
to think you're out to act.
And the reason you think is so that you 

277
00:16:31,311 --> 00:16:34,670
can try out some actions in a little 
world.

278
00:16:34,671 --> 00:16:37,670
And found a seat before you implement 
them in your behavior.

279
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,610
Right?
So to think things,

280
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,453
things through means to conjure up an 
abstracted world and then to conjure up 

281
00:16:44,301 --> 00:16:49,301
a representation of yourself acting in 
that world to calculate the consequences

282
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,040
and then to decide whether you're going 
to implement it.

283
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:52,903
Well that's another form of dissociative
ability because you can think without 

284
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,014
acting,
now you know it certainly that part of 

285
00:16:59,691 --> 00:17:00,524
you that's able to corner up the 
alternative worlds that human beings 

286
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:05,330
seem to particularly identify with.

287
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,193
You know that part that's thinking at 
least modern people really think of the 

288
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:10,094
part that's thinking as them or the part
that's capable of conjuring up abstract 

289
00:17:13,521 --> 00:17:14,354
ideas.
And if it wasn't dissociable you just 

290
00:17:16,071 --> 00:17:19,010
act out everything you thought,
well that wouldn't work very well.

291
00:17:19,011 --> 00:17:21,380
So the brain is actually designed in 
many ways,

292
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:24,800
so to speak,
to be dissociable now.

293
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:28,730
So if you understand that and then you 
understand the two,

294
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:34,260
the two l of the two sets of phenomena 
that are likely to be dissociated,

295
00:17:35,961 --> 00:17:36,794
then you kind of got the essence of 
Freudian theory and the things that are 

296
00:17:39,321 --> 00:17:44,000
likely to be dissociated are one 
memories that were traumatic.

297
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,770
And I'll,
I'll talk about that in a minute.

298
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,040
And two impulses,
they're not,

299
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,720
they're not even drives,
which was the Freud,

300
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:55,210
you'd way of thinking about it.
They're subpersonalities troublesome sub

301
00:17:55,211 --> 00:17:56,044
personalities.
And you can imagine that those would be 

302
00:17:58,621 --> 00:18:01,560
linked to complex,
positive and negative emotions.

303
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,990
One might be resentment,
guilt,

304
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:05,430
shame,
anger,

305
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,460
anxiety,
jealousy,

306
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,200
rage,
lust.

307
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,063
All of those emotions are,
are difficult to integrate into a 

308
00:18:14,581 --> 00:18:15,414
personality property.
Partly because in their pure 

309
00:18:17,821 --> 00:18:21,100
manifestation,
they're not there.

310
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,210
They disrupt the social order,
you know,

311
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:25,044
so like,
think about how well regulated all of 

312
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:29,040
you are sitting here,
you know,

313
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:29,810
and you think,
well,

314
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:30,643
you're 6 million years since you 
dissociated or since you've diverged 

315
00:18:34,351 --> 00:18:35,184
from chimpanzees.
If we took a bunch of chimpanzees that 

316
00:18:37,591 --> 00:18:39,690
knew each other as well as you know,
each other,

317
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,540
this place would be an absolute brutal 
massacre.

318
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,150
So you know,
for,

319
00:18:45,151 --> 00:18:45,984
for whatever reason,
you can control your primordial 

320
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,350
instincts.
That's one way of looking at it.

321
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:54,930
That's how Freud would look at it.
You've learned to control them.

322
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,453
And Freud's theory,
and this is where it differs from the 

323
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:02,340
theories that we talked about earlier,
say with regards to piaget,

324
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,250
Freud's theory is really more about 
control.

325
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:10,460
He thought of all of these potential 
subsystems and memories conflicting with

326
00:19:12,571 --> 00:19:14,820
each other like a war,
like a Hob.

327
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:15,654
See in war.
So hobbes was the philosopher who said 

328
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:21,000
that life is nasty,
brutal and short.

329
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,660
And that in the state of nature,
everyone is at war with everyone else.

330
00:19:24,661 --> 00:19:26,670
And so you need a,
uh,

331
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,240
a Leviathan,
a talk down control system,

332
00:19:30,241 --> 00:19:34,800
a Leviathan who will punish any deviance
from the social contract.

333
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,990
Well,
that's the Freudian Super Ego.

334
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,540
Now,
Freud thought of the unconscious and the

335
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:44,010
conscious mind to begin with,
but later he dissociated that up into in

336
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,023
ego and superego.
And then he thought that each of those 

337
00:19:47,431 --> 00:19:50,490
had their unconscious elements.
So you know,

338
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:51,324
so you,
if you're under the grip of an ID 

339
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:58,470
related subpersonality,
let's say you can be conscious of that,

340
00:19:58,471 --> 00:19:59,304
but there's the possibility for all 
sorts of other interrelated 

341
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,090
subpersonalities to emerge.

342
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:07,590
So those would be in your unconscious 
and it's also possible and highly likely

343
00:20:07,591 --> 00:20:08,424
in fact that the way that you're 
perceiving the world and the way you're 

344
00:20:10,981 --> 00:20:11,814
acting in it and even what you state as 
your goals are influenced in ways that 

345
00:20:16,051 --> 00:20:19,670
you don't understand by the action of 
these unconscious systems.

346
00:20:19,671 --> 00:20:21,450
So for example,
you know,

347
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,480
maybe some of you are headed for medical
school and if I asked you why,

348
00:20:24,481 --> 00:20:28,080
he'll give me six humanitarian reasons.
But the actual reason is,

349
00:20:28,081 --> 00:20:28,914
is because you know,
your grandmother would be disappointed 

350
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:34,590
if you weren't and she might not even be
alive anymore.

351
00:20:34,591 --> 00:20:35,700
You know,
she may have,

352
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:40,350
your mother may have imitated your 
grandmother so that that ideal is firmly

353
00:20:40,351 --> 00:20:41,184
embodied in her.
And that set up the unspoken 

354
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:47,130
expectations about your behavior ever 
since you were a tiny child.

355
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:52,060
So that's an interesting sub element of,
of psychodynamic theory too.

356
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:55,120
And it's really something to watch for 
in your personal relationships.

357
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,463
It's very,
very frequently if you watch carefully 

358
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:01,330
that you can see someone,
especially someone you love,

359
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:02,164
cause you have to know them well being 
taken over in some sense by the spirit 

360
00:21:06,821 --> 00:21:08,630
of one of their ancestors.
And I,

361
00:21:08,631 --> 00:21:13,631
I don't mean this in a metaphysical way,
I mean that the,

362
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:16,150
the,
the thought,

363
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,680
the personality of the grandmother or 
the personality of the mother has a,

364
00:21:20,681 --> 00:21:23,380
has a structure that's well known to 
the,

365
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:24,663
to the individual in question.
And that individual spent a lot of time 

366
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,143
imitating them in all sorts of ways.
And those imitated structures can be 

367
00:21:31,751 --> 00:21:34,450
passed down generation to generation.
I mean,

368
00:21:34,451 --> 00:21:35,284
in fact,
that's partly what constitutes your 

369
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:38,140
culture,
right?

370
00:21:38,141 --> 00:21:38,974
It's the imitated personality of all of 
your ancestors that constitutes your 

371
00:21:42,671 --> 00:21:44,980
culture and those things can possess 
you.

372
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:45,903
It,
he ologies possess you and exact not 

373
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,080
exactly the same way,
but in a very similar way.

374
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:53,140
So,
okay,

375
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,990
so you've got the end and you've got the
ego and the superego.

376
00:21:55,991 --> 00:21:59,710
And as in the Harpsi and worldview,
there's real tension between them.

377
00:21:59,711 --> 00:22:00,544
So that the end is always trying to get 
its base gratifications it's based 

378
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:10,291
desires ratified now in the in Friday 
and times that was mostly problematic in

379
00:22:11,921 --> 00:22:15,910
relationship to sex and the reasons for 
that are quite clear.

380
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,463
There was no valid birth control,
there was very little employment option 

381
00:22:23,651 --> 00:22:24,484
for women.
So there's sexual behavior had to be 

382
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:26,891
very,
very,

383
00:22:26,891 --> 00:22:27,724
very tightly regulated or they'd fall 
outside of the social structure into 

384
00:22:30,371 --> 00:22:34,060
prostitution or something like that.
And then there was that,

385
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:38,350
the threat of various venereal diseases,
most particularly syphilis,

386
00:22:38,351 --> 00:22:40,960
which is as awful a disease as you can 
imagine it,

387
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,123
it can imitate or mimic all sorts of 
other diseases and it's transmissible 

388
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,540
from mother to child.
So it's a nasty one.

389
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,260
So sick.
It was very difficult for the victorians

390
00:22:53,261 --> 00:22:56,410
to integrate sexuality because,
well,

391
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,120
exactly.
How did you do that there?

392
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:02,110
The the one pathway to potential 
integration.

393
00:23:02,111 --> 00:23:06,010
Something the Super Ego say would 
approve of was a miracle pathway.

394
00:23:06,011 --> 00:23:08,470
But you know,
people back then that,

395
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:10,990
you know,
in the 1960s people were getting married

396
00:23:10,991 --> 00:23:14,550
around 19 or 20 but that's actually a 
historical anomaly.

397
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:18,040
I mean typically speaking in the 
Victorian age,

398
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,023
a man usually couldn't afford to get 
married til he was in his mid to late 

399
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:22,743
twenties he just didn't have the 
resources and women who were married 

400
00:23:24,431 --> 00:23:25,264
usually younger than that,
but so there was a long period of time 

401
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,393
for men particularly,
but also for women where the sexual 

402
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:36,220
drive from a Friday and perspective was 
in full,

403
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,180
was fully flourishing,
fully manifesting itself.

404
00:23:40,181 --> 00:23:43,810
But there was no socially approved mode 
of expression.

405
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,183
And so under conditions there's a war 
between the ID and the superego in a 

406
00:23:48,901 --> 00:23:49,250
sense.

407
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,230
And the Portland Ego was crushed in the 
middle.

408
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:54,800
Now you could certainly see that when we
were watching the movie,

409
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:55,663
the crumb brothers movie,
because they are basically in the same 

410
00:23:57,261 --> 00:23:58,190
situation,
right?

411
00:23:58,430 --> 00:23:59,263
There was no socially approved way that 
they could manifest any sexual or any 

412
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:03,974
aggressive behavior.
And what happened as a consequence was 

413
00:24:05,931 --> 00:24:09,880
that the both of those fundamental 
subpersonalities,

414
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:10,723
let's call them,
become incredibly pathologized as 

415
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:18,170
particularly characterized by resentment
and the desire for revenge.

416
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,110
Because remember these systems think,
you know,

417
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:24,740
if someone's excrutiatingly sexually 
frustrated,

418
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:25,574
let's say,
and let's think about it in the broader 

419
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,170
scheme of things because sexuality isn't
really,

420
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:34,550
it's not a narrow unit,
dimensional drive it,

421
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,913
you know,
it's associated with playfulness and 

422
00:24:37,251 --> 00:24:38,084
it's associated with the desire for 
social contact and the desire for 

423
00:24:40,671 --> 00:24:42,530
communication and the desire for 
touching.

424
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,910
Like it's a complicated multi branching 
phenomena.

425
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:47,180
Well,
in,

426
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,820
in the case of the people who we were 
watching in the movie,

427
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:53,840
none of that was either integrated into 
their personalities,

428
00:24:53,841 --> 00:24:56,990
let's say,
or permitted by society.

429
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:58,140
And so it,
it,

430
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,233
it was bent and warped and,
and frustrated and then generated all 

431
00:25:02,421 --> 00:25:06,650
sorts of ideas about resentment and 
revenge around it.

432
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:07,813
So you can develop an incredibly,
an incredibly pathological 

433
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:16,610
subpersonality in the one cartoon,
if you remember when it was the one that

434
00:25:16,701 --> 00:25:21,701
was most disturbing where Mr Natural 
brought Robert that headless woman.

435
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:27,050
So he wanted pure gratification without 
responsibility.

436
00:25:27,051 --> 00:25:27,884
So it's a really it driven phenomenon.
And so he had intercourse with her and 

437
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:34,670
immediately after that was unbelievably 
guilty.

438
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:37,880
You know when you can see.
So you think about what that must mean.

439
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:41,340
It's like someone is under the grip of 
one subpersonalities.

440
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,573
It's shaping all of their thoughts and 
their memories and their emotions and 

441
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:47,780
all of a sudden that becomes gratified.
So it's satiated,

442
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:51,410
it disappears in Bang up comes the other
one and it's,

443
00:25:51,411 --> 00:25:52,100
you know,
wealth.

444
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,580
In this particular example it was guilt 
and shame and anxiety,

445
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:58,620
terror even and self loathing,
all of those things.

446
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:03,470
And if you read about the experiences of
people who commit particularly atrocious

447
00:26:03,471 --> 00:26:04,880
crimes,
it's very,

448
00:26:04,881 --> 00:26:05,714
very common for them to experience 
exactly that there are driven by sexual 

449
00:26:09,951 --> 00:26:14,410
slash aggressive impulses because those 
are generally the ones that culminate in

450
00:26:14,411 --> 00:26:16,610
a particularly atrocious,
you know,

451
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,533
individual crimes and they'll commit 
them and then the instantly flip back 

452
00:26:20,991 --> 00:26:21,824
into their normative personality.
Except they're absolutely terrified by 

453
00:26:24,381 --> 00:26:25,880
what they did.
And you know,

454
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:30,881
it's more than one person is inhabiting 
the same psyche and it's very,

455
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:34,310
now they're tied together by memory,
generally speaking.

456
00:26:34,311 --> 00:26:37,820
Although Freud would say you can also 
dissociate memory.

457
00:26:37,821 --> 00:26:38,654
And so Freud talk,
talked about memories being repressed 

458
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,820
and that's caused an awful lot of 
trouble because,

459
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,750
well,
for a whole variety of reasons because

460
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:56,410
because memory is not cat memory is not 
the object of recording.

461
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,760
It's not the objective unbiased 
recording of actually occurring events.

462
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,373
First of all,
because you cannot actually objective 

463
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:10,590
where you record certain kinds of 
events.

464
00:27:10,591 --> 00:27:11,424
Like we've talked about this before,
you can't really objective where you 

465
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:14,603
record a discussion between a man and a 
woman who'd been married for 20 years 

466
00:27:18,301 --> 00:27:20,970
about anything important because for 
them,

467
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,283
each word and each phrase and each 
sentence and each facial expression has 

468
00:27:26,191 --> 00:27:30,990
to be interpreted within the context of 
the entire relationship in order for the

469
00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:33,300
meaning of the utterances to be 
extracted.

470
00:27:33,301 --> 00:27:35,690
And there's just no way you can record 
that in a video.

471
00:27:35,691 --> 00:27:36,524
You,
you'd have to have video the entire 

472
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,860
relationship and so you're not going to 
do that.

473
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,620
And so memory is a very,
very peculiar thing.

474
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:44,454
And the idea that you could have an 
objective record is not a very 

475
00:27:46,891 --> 00:27:49,890
sophisticated idea.
Anyways,

476
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,860
Freud's idea,
in some sense he had a rail,

477
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:54,750
uh,
somewhat,

478
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:01,730
I hate to say it was an insufficiently 
sophisticated notion of what memory was.

479
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:06,240
Now I hate to say that because Freud was
a very sophisticated person,

480
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,553
but he did in some sense believe in the 
existence of an objective interpersonal 

481
00:28:11,491 --> 00:28:12,324
world.
And so he thought if something terrible 

482
00:28:13,831 --> 00:28:18,030
happened to you when you were a child,
that you had a record of the memory,

483
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:21,090
it was there as the mammary,
as the event,

484
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:26,870
and then you needed something that would
like a sensor that would repress that.

485
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:30,000
And then you needed a place for it to be
repressed into,

486
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,430
which would be the unconscious.
But if you,

487
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,330
but if you take apart a traumatic 
memory,

488
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:40,050
generally speaking with someone and he,
then he also,

489
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:40,884
sorry.
He also thought that that repressed 

490
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:47,091
memory might be represented in a,
in a symptom,

491
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,390
a symbolic symptom.
So I think,

492
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,280
I think that the repression theory,

493
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,790
okay.

494
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:58,790
Suffers from the inadequacy of its 
representation of memory.

495
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:00,680
Because here,
here's a different way of thinking about

496
00:29:00,681 --> 00:29:03,460
it.
It's more in keeping with the layer more

497
00:29:03,461 --> 00:29:06,920
than the hierarchical layer model that 
we've been entertaining as we progress.

498
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:12,310
So imagine that you were molested by 
your uncle because it's usually a family

499
00:29:14,031 --> 00:29:16,880
member when you're for sexually 
molested.

500
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,790
Okay.
The first thing you have to ask yourself

501
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,790
is just exactly what kind of memory do 
you have.

502
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,220
Imagine you're completely sexually 
naive,

503
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:30,170
which basically means you know nothing 
about the sexual act and and it's,

504
00:29:30,171 --> 00:29:33,230
and it's implications or the mechanics.
But this happens to you.

505
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:36,680
So the first question is how do you 
represent that?

506
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,590
And the answer is because to rip,
to remember something,

507
00:29:39,591 --> 00:29:41,950
you have to represent it.
That's the thing.

508
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,680
Cause you don't just have a memory of 
that event.

509
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:48,550
It's always interpretation because 
there's so many things going on.

510
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,830
Well,
so maybe you,

511
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:53,950
maybe your representation is pain and 
confusion,

512
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,053
something like that.
And then there'd be another layer over 

513
00:29:57,971 --> 00:30:02,650
that which would be the necessity for 
secrecy because of course the person who

514
00:30:02,651 --> 00:30:05,950
does the molesting is going to tell you 
what one of two things.

515
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,140
It's three,
maybe it's good for you.

516
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:10,140
You asked for it.
Um,

517
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:13,780
don't tell anyone or,
or they'll think you're a bad person.

518
00:30:13,781 --> 00:30:16,150
This will be our little secret.
Something like that.

519
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:21,270
So then there's that whole overlay of 
secrecy and inadmissibility.

520
00:30:22,451 --> 00:30:23,830
And what are you supposed to do about 
that?

521
00:30:23,831 --> 00:30:24,664
When you're for how you're supposed to 
understand that something has just 

522
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:29,590
transpired,
that you're not allowed to share it with

523
00:30:29,591 --> 00:30:30,424
anyone.
You don't have a model of the world 

524
00:30:32,111 --> 00:30:34,390
that's sophisticated enough to account 
for all that.

525
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,613
And so then

526
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:40,810
perhaps from then on,
what you do is avoid thinking about it.

527
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,880
Now,
that's not the same as repression.

528
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:43,923
Avoiding thinking about something is not
the same as repression because it 

529
00:30:46,961 --> 00:30:49,840
doesn't require an active repressor in 
order to do it.

530
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,820
And then maybe,
you know,

531
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:56,920
years later you start to recall what 
happened.

532
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:57,754
But what you recall is an unclear mess 
and the read and maybe most of it 

533
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,271
because you might say,
well,

534
00:31:04,271 --> 00:31:05,104
how are things represented as memories 
when you can't develop a sophisticated 

535
00:31:09,311 --> 00:31:11,290
representation?
And what seems to happen,

536
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:12,124
and this is in a sense the reason 
reversive Freud and theory is that 

537
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:15,790
right?

538
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,470
The the

539
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,463
and is represented in the body.
And so you can think about the 

540
00:31:24,251 --> 00:31:28,960
representation of advance as a 
multilayered neurological phenomenon.

541
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:32,830
And so if you were in town or something 
that's unexpected or frightening,

542
00:31:32,831 --> 00:31:34,720
the first thing that happens is that 
very,

543
00:31:34,721 --> 00:31:37,720
very ancient reflex of systems act 
first.

544
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,290
And those things are fast.
And so that's the sort of thing that for

545
00:31:41,291 --> 00:31:44,050
example might protect you against a 
snake bite.

546
00:31:44,051 --> 00:31:46,330
If a snake jumped out at you are going 
to jump backwards.

547
00:31:46,331 --> 00:31:47,164
And believe me,
you do that before you even see the 

548
00:31:48,881 --> 00:31:49,714
snake because it probably takes you a 
quarter of a second to produce complex 

549
00:31:53,471 --> 00:31:54,304
visual representation of the snake.
And if you wait around for a quarter of 

550
00:31:57,251 --> 00:31:58,960
a second,
then you're dead.

551
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,003
And so what's happened is that your 
nervous system has conserved basic 

552
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:06,840
reflexes that are only a few snaps as 
long.

553
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:10,420
So maybe those work between your retina 
and your spinal cord,

554
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,553
your retina,
and maybe a very primordial emotional 

555
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:13,960
system.

556
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,793
Like the Amygdala is wired up to detect 
things like snakes and it just sends a 

557
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,233
message down to your spinal cord or,
or slightly more sophisticated motor 

558
00:32:22,871 --> 00:32:23,704
control systems that says jump backwards
now and then maybe you think about it 

559
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:27,933
isn't even till after that that your 
heart rate goes up and your blood 

560
00:32:31,061 --> 00:32:31,894
pressure goes up and you start to 
breathe heavily and then there's a wave 

561
00:32:34,511 --> 00:32:35,344
of fear and revulsion,
which is perhaps there to teach you not 

562
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:40,820
to do such a stupid thing again.
You know,

563
00:32:40,821 --> 00:32:44,600
we don't exactly know why you would 
experience negative emotion,

564
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:45,434
you know,
or what function the negative emotion 

565
00:32:46,761 --> 00:32:47,594
has except that we do know that a 
pattern of neurological behavior that's 

566
00:32:51,891 --> 00:32:52,724
followed by a punishment or a threat is 
likely less likely to be re implemented 

567
00:32:58,551 --> 00:32:59,780
in the future.
Okay,

568
00:32:59,781 --> 00:33:00,614
so the reaction to the anomalous thing 
is barley and then maybe it's emotion 

569
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:09,230
and then maybe it's image like 
imagination.

570
00:33:09,231 --> 00:33:10,064
You know,
what just happened and then maybe it's 

571
00:33:11,301 --> 00:33:12,134
articulated speech,
but lots of things don't get past image 

572
00:33:15,261 --> 00:33:16,094
to articulate in speech.
And some things I think don't even get 

573
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:19,820
past body.

574
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,833
Sorry about that.

575
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,333
So I don't think that these traumatic 
memories are so much repressed as Freud 

576
00:33:34,121 --> 00:33:37,630
had it as never brought forward for 
development.

577
00:33:37,631 --> 00:33:39,010
So,
um,

578
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,353
let me,
I'll tell you a story about how this 

579
00:33:41,381 --> 00:33:42,250
might work.
Okay.

580
00:33:42,251 --> 00:33:45,790
So one time I had this client,
she was about 27 I only saw her once.

581
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,430
This is when I was just training to be a
psychotherapist.

582
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,013
And she came into me and she said that 
she had been plagued by these thoughts 

583
00:33:54,971 --> 00:33:57,910
of being sexually abused when she was a 
child.

584
00:33:58,570 --> 00:33:59,620
And I said,
well,

585
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:02,140
who was doing this to you?
And she said,

586
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:03,280
well,
it was my brother.

587
00:34:03,281 --> 00:34:05,920
And I said,
she said he was a lot older than me.

588
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:10,030
And so I formulated this mental model of
her being,

589
00:34:10,031 --> 00:34:10,864
you know,
somewhere between 10 and 13 and her 

590
00:34:12,161 --> 00:34:12,994
brother being somewhere between say 15 
and 20 because the way she described it 

591
00:34:16,961 --> 00:34:17,850
was,
you know,

592
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:22,300
that she was overpowered by our larger,
a physically larger male.

593
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,600
So we talked for awhile and then she 
finally told me,

594
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:25,991
I said,
well,

595
00:34:25,991 --> 00:34:28,030
how old were you when this happened?
And she said,

596
00:34:28,031 --> 00:34:29,170
well,
I was four.

597
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,371
Okay,
and now,

598
00:34:30,371 --> 00:34:31,181
and then I said,
well,

599
00:34:31,181 --> 00:34:33,040
okay,
how old was your brother?

600
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,151
And she said,
well,

601
00:34:34,151 --> 00:34:36,790
he was six.
And so I said,

602
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:37,900
well look,
you know,

603
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:38,973
here's one way of looking at it.
Like you're looking at it from the 

604
00:34:41,531 --> 00:34:44,920
perspective of the four year old.
It's a regression in some sense.

605
00:34:44,921 --> 00:34:49,480
That's still how old you are as far as 
experiencing the memory.

606
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:54,550
Here's an alternative hypothesis.
Your brother wasn't a Predator,

607
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:57,850
you were both terribly supervise 
children.

608
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,850
Well,
you know,

609
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:05,200
that made the lights go on and you're in
her mind because she never thought about

610
00:35:05,201 --> 00:35:06,034
it that way.
Like she'd never taken that 

611
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,433
representation,
which would be her emotional experience 

612
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,910
as a four year old related to a six year
old.

613
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,880
A six year old is a lot bigger and more 
powerful than the four year olds.

614
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:16,743
Right.
It's,

615
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,730
it's,
it's you know,

616
00:35:18,731 --> 00:35:21,940
50% owner.
So it's a big deal when you're four.

617
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,373
But if the,
if the issue for the memory is its 

618
00:35:26,651 --> 00:35:30,160
relevance to current conceptualization 
and behavior,

619
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,670
it was much better for her to update the
memory in a sense.

620
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,890
And think,
well yeah,

621
00:35:35,891 --> 00:35:39,360
like a six year olds this and like the 
four year olds this high.

622
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,203
I'm like,
what the hell were my parents doing 

623
00:35:41,071 --> 00:35:41,904
anyways?
And that's an entirely different story 

624
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,100
than,
than the one.

625
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,250
And she had come up with come in with,
you know,

626
00:35:47,251 --> 00:35:49,020
and that seemed to be a great relief to 
her.

627
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,570
And that's partly because,
you know,

628
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,910
if you're bothered by a traumatic 
memory,

629
00:35:53,911 --> 00:35:54,744
it keeps resurfacing on which it will.
And it's actually one of the ways of 

630
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:01,710
identifying a traumatic memory is that 
the thing won't leave you alone.

631
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:05,460
It keeps coming up and dreams.
And when your mind is wandering,

632
00:36:05,461 --> 00:36:06,294
it'll keep coming up when your mind is 
wandering and maybe it'll come up when 

633
00:36:08,581 --> 00:36:11,520
you're going to sleep at night and like 
it invades your mind.

634
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,380
There's a reason for that.
And the reason is is that the underlying

635
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:19,380
emotional systems that are associated 
with anxiety,

636
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:24,530
so those are mostly hippocampus and the 
Amygdala duel duo in some sense that are

637
00:36:24,811 --> 00:36:25,644
mediating those there an alarm system 
and the alarm is something that's 

638
00:36:30,601 --> 00:36:31,434
potentially dangerous has happened.
You need to figure out what it means so 

639
00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:36,630
that you can miss stop that from 
happening in the future.

640
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,160
Okay,
so you need a plan,

641
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:38,994
you need and get applied and you do have
to do a causal analysis of the 

642
00:36:42,361 --> 00:36:45,840
relationship between your behavior and 
the traumatic outcome.

643
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,530
That would be the first thing and then 
you have to come up with a way that that

644
00:36:49,531 --> 00:36:50,550
won't happen again.

645
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,253
And of course for my client,
that happened pretty much right away 

646
00:36:54,811 --> 00:36:55,644
because now she was a 27 year old woman 
and the probability that she was going 

647
00:36:58,501 --> 00:36:59,334
to be subject in any serious way to a 
situation the same as the one she was 

648
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:07,380
remembering was zero.
But,

649
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:10,130
and I've seen this in other clients too,
is when,

650
00:37:10,131 --> 00:37:11,160
when they're,
when they're,

651
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,570
when,
okay.

652
00:37:12,571 --> 00:37:15,150
I had another client who,
who,

653
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:16,950
uh,
when she was,

654
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:19,910
I think I told you about her briefly,
when she was young,

655
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,753
four years old,
she jumped in a shopping cart and went 

656
00:37:23,761 --> 00:37:24,594
down a hill,
like a paved hill in the shopping cart 

657
00:37:26,421 --> 00:37:27,254
is filled out at the bottom and hurt 
herself and they took her to the 

658
00:37:29,521 --> 00:37:30,354
hospital and you know,
so then she's all primed for being 

659
00:37:32,911 --> 00:37:33,780
threatened.
And then,

660
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:36,480
so that kind of means you're open to 
rewire.

661
00:37:36,481 --> 00:37:37,290
We need some sense.

662
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,123
And so then when she's in the hospital,
they don't let her parents come and see 

663
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:42,090
her for a couple of weeks.
You know,

664
00:37:42,091 --> 00:37:42,924
so the trauma,
the pain and the anxiety and the threat 

665
00:37:46,261 --> 00:37:48,030
than the ambulance ride and all those 
things,

666
00:37:48,031 --> 00:37:50,490
which sort of puts you in a state like 
this,

667
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,800
which might be at like a,
uh,

668
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:53,783
state that's particularly conducive to 
learning if something traumatic is 

669
00:37:57,301 --> 00:37:59,340
happening,
you should be learning about that,

670
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,260
what the world's like around that right 
now.

671
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,693
And,
uh,

672
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:07,790
she developed it a permanent trauma 
related paranoia about institutions,

673
00:38:08,581 --> 00:38:09,414
which turned by the time I met her,
had turned into a whole philosophy of 

674
00:38:12,901 --> 00:38:16,630
institutional oppression.
But it's core was that terror.

675
00:38:16,631 --> 00:38:18,000
And you know,
rightly so,

676
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:18,923
it's core was that combination of 
physiological trauma and psychological 

677
00:38:22,741 --> 00:38:23,574
trauma and you know,
mishandling of the situation by people 

678
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:29,910
in authority.
So,

679
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:31,943
so you can see under those circumstances
how a traumatic memory can become the 

680
00:38:34,651 --> 00:38:37,250
core,
a whole large subpersonality.

681
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,760
Now it has to be taken apart very 
carefully,

682
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:40,923
especially if that sub personality isn't
the kind that can be easily integrated 

683
00:38:44,621 --> 00:38:45,760
into the world.
So,

684
00:38:45,761 --> 00:38:46,594
for example,
if you're paranoid about all 

685
00:38:48,011 --> 00:38:48,844
institutions,
you're in real trouble because in a 

686
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:51,694
modern world you're faced with,
there's necessity of dealing with 

687
00:38:53,921 --> 00:38:54,754
institutions all the time.
And if you're more distrustful and 

688
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:01,450
paranoid about them,
then you couldn't be,

689
00:39:01,451 --> 00:39:03,940
if you were sophisticated,
all of that's going to happen is they're

690
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:06,010
going to continually mistreat you.
Right?

691
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:07,900
Cause I mean if a dog comes up to you 
and it's,

692
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:10,750
it's looking suspiciously and barking 
and growling,

693
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,180
you're not going to pet it.
You know,

694
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:17,560
the way you interact with the system,
it depends the,

695
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,453
the reaction of a system to you is 
dependent to a large degree on how you 

696
00:39:22,061 --> 00:39:24,580
approached the system.
So anyways,

697
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,100
the dissociate ability ideas,
a really good one

698
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:30,040
mean

699
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,440
if you want to get to know yourself 
better.

700
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,500
And this is sort of a combination of 
Freud and in union ideas.

701
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,693
One of the things to do is to,
so imagine that you have some sort of 

702
00:39:39,431 --> 00:39:42,310
goal in mind.
The first question is you that you might

703
00:39:42,311 --> 00:39:45,460
ask yourself is why do you have that 
goal?

704
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:48,940
What are the influences on you that have
set that goal up?

705
00:39:48,941 --> 00:39:49,774
Cause it easily could be conscious or 
partially conscious or poorly explained 

706
00:39:55,121 --> 00:39:57,550
or implicit,
any of those things.

707
00:39:57,551 --> 00:40:00,460
So you want to know that,
why are you doing what you're doing?

708
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:02,500
Okay.

709
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,333
And the second thing is if you find 
yourself avoiding things on the way to 

710
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,404
that goal,
the next question is why are you 

711
00:40:10,721 --> 00:40:12,700
avoiding them?
And you know,

712
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:16,360
that'll mean delving into parts of 
yourself that are quite hidden and quite

713
00:40:16,361 --> 00:40:17,890
uncomfortable.
So for example,

714
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,113
if you discovered that the reason you're
pursuing a particular goal is because 

715
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:27,780
it's what your parents want you to do,
one question that immediate you're rises

716
00:40:28,241 --> 00:40:29,080
is,
yeah,

717
00:40:29,081 --> 00:40:29,914
but is that what you want to do?
And you know that that's a very 

718
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:38,980
complicated question because you'd have 
to dissociate the part of you that's the

719
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:39,814
you that doesn't want to do it from the 
part of you that's the you that does 

720
00:40:42,821 --> 00:40:43,654
want to do it.
And then you have to figure out why in 

721
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:47,350
the world you'd be avoiding.
So you know,

722
00:40:47,351 --> 00:40:48,184
it might be that you're an unbelievably 
angry that you've been tilted towards 

723
00:40:52,901 --> 00:40:56,500
this particular goal for reasons that 
have nothing to do with your choice.

724
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:00,970
And so that every time you have the 
opportunity to study or,

725
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,930
or accomplish something that would move 
you farther to that goal,

726
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:08,230
you're either not motivated.
So you can't pay attention,

727
00:41:08,231 --> 00:41:09,880
you can't study,
you can't learn,

728
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,833
and you procrastinate all the time,
or you actually do seriously 

729
00:41:14,201 --> 00:41:15,970
counterproductive thing.
So people,

730
00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:17,920
for example,
people can be

731
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:20,480
okay.

732
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,790
I just had someone write me here a while
ago,

733
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,813
um,
because he was watching the youtube 

734
00:41:24,561 --> 00:41:27,980
lectures and he said that he had dreams 
for six weeks,

735
00:41:27,981 --> 00:41:31,190
that he drove his car off a cliff and 
crashed it.

736
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,653
And then at the end of the series,
he drove his car off the cliff and 

737
00:41:35,571 --> 00:41:36,404
crashed it.
And he asked me what that meant and I 

738
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:38,624
said,
well,

739
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:42,680
the dream is telling you that you're 
being far too careless with your life.

740
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,660
Like that's what driving cliff off a car
off a cliff repeatedly needs.

741
00:41:47,661 --> 00:41:48,680
It's like,
you know,

742
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:52,160
that's a good descent,
unconscious descent into the underworld.

743
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,360
Well,
and he was being warned,

744
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:57,950
the,
the psychological reality was such that

745
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:02,700
the warning was extremely serious and so
was the danger.

746
00:42:02,701 --> 00:42:03,750
And so then you might say,
well,

747
00:42:03,751 --> 00:42:06,150
why would he drive himself off a cliff?
Well,

748
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:08,370
you know,
that's a suicidal gesture.

749
00:42:08,371 --> 00:42:09,240
And then you might ask,
well,

750
00:42:09,241 --> 00:42:11,640
why would money be suicidal?
And that could be,

751
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,713
well,
they're out for revenge against their 

752
00:42:13,471 --> 00:42:14,304
parents or they're out for revenge 
against the whole world or they're out 

753
00:42:16,561 --> 00:42:17,394
for revenge against themselves or they 
just want to make their painful 

754
00:42:19,951 --> 00:42:20,784
consciousness go away.
Or they're living a messy and pointless 

755
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:24,803
and painful life and,
and they want to punish themselves for 

756
00:42:27,031 --> 00:42:27,790
it.
And you know,

757
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:28,623
it's very,
very complicated and tangled down there 

758
00:42:30,991 --> 00:42:34,440
at the bottom of things and people don't
really like to look into it.

759
00:42:34,441 --> 00:42:35,274
And I suppose to some degree that's the 
shadow element because what you find 

760
00:42:39,241 --> 00:42:42,980
there is seldom what you want.
I mean,

761
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:43,823
one of the prime victims of unions,
psychotherapy and most psychotherapies 

762
00:42:47,581 --> 00:42:50,910
are predicated on the idea that you 
should find out what you're avoiding and

763
00:42:50,911 --> 00:42:53,370
then you should figure out how to 
voluntarily face it.

764
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:54,563
Now you might add to that,
you should find out what you're doing 

765
00:42:57,211 --> 00:43:00,810
and why and see if that's actually what 
you want to be doing.

766
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:02,183
And if those reasons are reasons you 
like that might you know in some sense 

767
00:43:05,461 --> 00:43:08,340
some up therapy in a couple of phrases,
but

768
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,353
in order to manage that then you have to
look at all the things you've been 

769
00:43:14,271 --> 00:43:15,260
avoiding.
Well,

770
00:43:15,261 --> 00:43:16,370
what do you avoid?
Well,

771
00:43:16,371 --> 00:43:18,410
it isn't rainbows and cookies,
right?

772
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:19,483
The things that you avoid are the things
that no one wants to look at and so 

773
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,660
humans,
primary dictum for his psychotherapeutic

774
00:43:26,661 --> 00:43:30,860
practice was a Latin phrase which is in 
sterk wiliness invented tour,

775
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:31,873
which I'm probably pronouncing wrong,
which means either in fill it will be 

776
00:43:35,631 --> 00:43:40,631
found or where are you want most is to 
be found where you least want to look.

777
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,860
You know those nausea.
That's what that,

778
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:47,060
that's how horrible philosophy,
but you can see that it's almost self.

779
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:52,070
It's almost self fulfilling because of 
course the things you're going to avoid.

780
00:43:52,071 --> 00:43:53,750
Are there things that you don't want to 
face?

781
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:54,643
Obviously now the shadow element of the 
psyche in some sense when you were 

782
00:43:59,691 --> 00:44:01,610
watching the movie,
for example,

783
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:02,623
you saw these drives mostly sexual and 
aggressive that were manifesting 

784
00:44:06,381 --> 00:44:07,820
themselves in all sorts of ways.

785
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:11,390
And so that would be navy,
the repressed or unincorporated elements

786
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:13,580
of the end.
But then there was a side of,

787
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,480
there was another more complex side of 
that where the,

788
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,740
the,
the,

789
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:22,400
the people were reacting to that,
you know,

790
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:25,000
cause they felt downtrodden and 
oppressed and,

791
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:26,263
and antisocial and critical of social 
structure and all of that because they 

792
00:44:31,621 --> 00:44:34,830
were unable to manifest themselves 
properly in the world.

793
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:38,490
And that produced fantasies of extreme 
destruction,

794
00:44:38,491 --> 00:44:40,240
exceptional destruction,
and for them,

795
00:44:40,241 --> 00:44:41,074
and they were mostly sexually related,
but for other people that can manifest 

796
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,264
itself in incredibly violent fantasies 
about the destruction of society as 

797
00:44:49,201 --> 00:44:50,034
such.

798
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:51,423
So

799
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:55,040
if you can't invite all the parts of you
out to play,

800
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:58,100
the parts that get left behind are not 
very happy about it.

801
00:44:58,101 --> 00:45:00,410
And they don't just sit around having a 
tea party,

802
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:01,670
you know,
they turn into,

803
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,710
they turned in,
especially as you mature,

804
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:07,340
they turn into these work monsters and 
they're,

805
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:11,240
their mode of action in the world is 
anything but positive.

806
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,260
And the Freudian world,
like the,

807
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:16,283
the,
the world of the psychoanalytic 

808
00:45:17,511 --> 00:45:18,344
unconscious is quite a terrifying place 
because it makes you second guess 

809
00:45:22,551 --> 00:45:23,570
everything.
It's like,

810
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:25,670
it's not a paranoia.
Okay,

811
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:27,930
okay.

812
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:30,030
You never,
it's very,

813
00:45:30,031 --> 00:45:30,864
very difficult once you're trained 
psychoanalytically to ever assume that 

814
00:45:35,221 --> 00:45:40,020
someone's benevolent motivations are 
only what they claim they are.

815
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:43,530
You're always looking for the other 
missing piece.

816
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:46,110
And I think it's extremely useful 
because you know,

817
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:46,944
you run into people in particular to 
idiot logs who will claim that they're 

818
00:45:50,011 --> 00:45:52,230
acting on the world's behalf.
It's like,

819
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:54,653
yeah,
who made you is saying and why should I 

820
00:45:57,451 --> 00:45:59,550
believe that all the good is on your 
side?

821
00:45:59,551 --> 00:46:01,590
Like what is it that you're not talking 
about?

822
00:46:01,591 --> 00:46:04,650
What it is that,
what is it that you're not revealing?

823
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:07,320
I got something from Greenpeace once,
for example,

824
00:46:07,321 --> 00:46:12,321
that was asking for donations.
And the brochure was just photographs of

825
00:46:12,541 --> 00:46:14,610
all the people who were on the board.
I thought,

826
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:16,023
okay,

827
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:18,493
why do I want to see photographs of all 
the people who are on the board of 

828
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:22,053
Greenpeace?
Or the other question is why do they 

829
00:46:24,471 --> 00:46:27,680
want to show them?
Well you don't have to fake very hard to

830
00:46:27,681 --> 00:46:29,120
figure that out.
You know,

831
00:46:29,121 --> 00:46:29,954
it's a status maneuver.
What you'd expect in a mail out like 

832
00:46:32,871 --> 00:46:33,441
that is,
you know,

833
00:46:33,441 --> 00:46:37,430
here's six things that we've done in the
last year that improve the planet.

834
00:46:37,431 --> 00:46:38,264
And you know,
here's what we spent in relationship to 

835
00:46:41,361 --> 00:46:44,180
administrative costs and here's why it 
was a good idea,

836
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:48,740
not here's our leaders.
Now there's something wrong there.

837
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:49,663
And I mean that's,
I picked Greenpeace cause it just 

838
00:46:51,051 --> 00:46:53,480
happened to pop in money.
But it's the case for all sorts of,

839
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,100
of organizations.

840
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:59,170
So,
all right,

841
00:46:59,171 --> 00:46:59,950
so

842
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:04,360
freud by 1900 had identified a lot of 
different functions of the unconscious.

843
00:47:04,361 --> 00:47:08,110
And so here's four of them.
One was the unconscious,

844
00:47:08,111 --> 00:47:08,944
how to conservative function,
which meant that it stored memories 

845
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,500
often unaccessible to voluntary recall.
Now,

846
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:17,500
we don't really know how memories are 
stored in the brain,

847
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:18,334
but here's,
here's I guess so when you have an 

848
00:47:21,761 --> 00:47:22,594
experience,
imagine that that produces a pattern of 

849
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:29,780
neural activity.
It's just neuro,

850
00:47:29,781 --> 00:47:33,680
but a pattern of that activity in your 
brain and in your body,

851
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:40,180
at least part of how you remember is to 
reactivate that pattern,

852
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:41,373
but it's not that simple obviously,
because otherwise you docked out all 

853
00:47:44,951 --> 00:47:48,880
your memories precisely and we don't 
know exactly how that initial

854
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:54,170
pattern of experience gets edited down 
to the thing you remember,

855
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:55,004
but we do know that it it,
it gets edited down in some ways as a 

856
00:47:58,701 --> 00:48:02,000
consequence of its relevance to your 
current goal structure.

857
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:06,680
How that happens,
it seems computationally impossible.

858
00:48:06,681 --> 00:48:08,900
We really don't understand how it 
happens at all.

859
00:48:08,901 --> 00:48:13,220
We don't understand how you can compute 
what's relevant and what isn't.

860
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,540
It seems that the world is too complex 
for that to even be possible.

861
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:19,093
So Conservative dissoluted the 
unconscious contains habits once 

862
00:48:22,671 --> 00:48:26,600
voluntary,
now automatized and dissociated elements

863
00:48:26,601 --> 00:48:29,660
of the personality which may lead a 
parasitic existence.

864
00:48:30,020 --> 00:48:30,853
That's,
so I talked to a little bit about 

865
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:34,423
traumatic memories and how they might 
form the node of the development of the 

866
00:48:36,981 --> 00:48:37,814
subpersonality,
but there's something else that's worth 

867
00:48:39,681 --> 00:48:42,960
understanding too.
So let's say you,

868
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,053
you start practicing a new minor mode of
being a new attitude or a new 

869
00:48:48,501 --> 00:48:50,810
personality attribute or new habit,
let's say.

870
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:54,800
It can be a fairly small thing.
When you first start practicing it,

871
00:48:54,801 --> 00:48:57,710
you're not very good at it.
For those of you who are musicians,

872
00:48:57,950 --> 00:48:59,840
you know when you first start to play a 
piece,

873
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:02,840
you're very inefficient at it.
And then the more you practice it,

874
00:49:02,841 --> 00:49:04,730
the more efficient you get.
It's,

875
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:07,100
it's quite weird.
I'm not a very good pianist,

876
00:49:07,101 --> 00:49:09,200
but I learned to play one really 
difficult song.

877
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,720
But the terrible thing is,
is a learn to play it.

878
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:15,050
And then at some point I'll realize that
I don't know the notes anymore.

879
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:16,940
And as soon as I realized I don't know 
the notes,

880
00:49:16,941 --> 00:49:18,890
I can't use those habit patterns 
anymore.

881
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:20,510
And then I have to figure out the notes 
again.

882
00:49:20,511 --> 00:49:21,680
It's very,
very annoying,

883
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:22,873
but anyways,
when you first start practicing 

884
00:49:24,381 --> 00:49:25,760
something,
it's effortful.

885
00:49:25,761 --> 00:49:30,020
It requires a lot of brain activation.
That's what the scanning studies show,

886
00:49:30,021 --> 00:49:30,854
but as you practice it more and more,
the amount of the brain that you use 

887
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,450
starts to shrink.

888
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:36,353
It generally moves left cause the right 
hemisphere is more involved in novelty 

889
00:49:39,651 --> 00:49:40,484
processing.
It generally moves left and then it 

890
00:49:42,051 --> 00:49:42,884
moves back and the area gets smaller and
smaller and smaller until you've 

891
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:50,930
generated up a little machine or it's a 
little hard wired.

892
00:49:50,931 --> 00:49:53,960
Some personality that takes care of that
particular operation.

893
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,033
Now that's where thinking about too,
because what that means in some senses 

894
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:02,540
that your brain is full of the things 
that you've practiced,

895
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:05,840
and that's not exactly psychological,
right?

896
00:50:05,841 --> 00:50:08,480
It's psychophysiological.
It's part of your psyche,

897
00:50:08,481 --> 00:50:09,314
but it's also hardwired into your brain.
If you want to overcome one of those 

898
00:50:11,991 --> 00:50:12,824
habits,
you have to build a new machine that 

899
00:50:13,971 --> 00:50:14,804
shuts it off.
You can't just get rid of it and then 

900
00:50:17,241 --> 00:50:20,090
what happens if you get stressed?
Often that new machine will get,

901
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:24,403
don't know exactly how it happens.
The stress will reduce the functioning 

902
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:29,360
of the new machine and old habit to pop 
back up.

903
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:30,403
Some of you all have noticed this.
How many of you have moved away from 

904
00:50:33,471 --> 00:50:35,900
home?
Okay,

905
00:50:35,901 --> 00:50:36,734
so how many of you noticed when you go 
to your family of origin that all sorts 

906
00:50:42,801 --> 00:50:43,634
of personality traits that you thought 
you abandoned immediately come flooding 

907
00:50:48,231 --> 00:50:50,000
back?
So are you,

908
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:52,040
you know that,
you know that sensation,

909
00:50:52,041 --> 00:50:53,780
right?
You go back there and it's like bang,

910
00:50:53,781 --> 00:50:55,760
there's a groove and you're right in it 
and you know,

911
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:59,540
maybe you're as mature as a 30 year old 
when you're at your own house,

912
00:50:59,541 --> 00:51:01,310
but as soon as you come home it's like 
poof,

913
00:51:01,311 --> 00:51:02,144
you're 14 again.
And it's partly because that's the 

914
00:51:03,801 --> 00:51:06,500
expectancy situation set up by your 
parents.

915
00:51:06,501 --> 00:51:07,334
But it's also partly because you just 
don't understand how much of your 

916
00:51:11,541 --> 00:51:15,270
behavior is automatic and cued by 
ongoing events.

917
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:17,570
It's habitual.
And so those,

918
00:51:17,571 --> 00:51:18,404
you might think of those as somewhat 
dissociated elements of the personality 

919
00:51:20,991 --> 00:51:23,090
as well.
Creative,

920
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:27,650
the unconscious serves as the matrix of 
new ideas.

921
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:32,060
So that's a more union idea and the way 
that seems to work.

922
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:34,973
You might think,
how in the world can you come up with a 

923
00:51:36,331 --> 00:51:39,000
new idea because it doesn't make sense,
right?

924
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:42,030
I mean,
what are you conjuring something out of?

925
00:51:42,031 --> 00:51:44,220
Nothing.
Well,

926
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:47,010
and you can say,
well they're combinations of old ideas,

927
00:51:47,011 --> 00:51:47,844
but you know,
that's not that helpful because you 

928
00:51:48,841 --> 00:51:52,050
can't just take a bunch of old ideas and
like shuffled them and come up with some

929
00:51:52,051 --> 00:51:55,500
new spectacular ideas.
It's a lot more complicated than that.

930
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:58,680
So here's one way to think about

931
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:03,110
brought forward,
investigated in some sense,

932
00:52:03,111 --> 00:52:03,944
the surface of the creative unconscious.
And he was more concerned about the 

933
00:52:07,431 --> 00:52:11,810
relay he called Freud's unconscious,
the personal unconscious.

934
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:12,823
So that might be the unconscious that 
you have that's related specifically to 

935
00:52:15,981 --> 00:52:19,040
your experiences,
conscious and unconscious.

936
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:21,380
Like it can be d you'll have a dream 
once.

937
00:52:21,381 --> 00:52:23,750
For example,
hope I've got this right,

938
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:25,123
that Freud and him were excavating the 
basement of a structure and that and 

939
00:52:30,071 --> 00:52:34,070
that you'll broke through and found 
another huge structure underneath that.

940
00:52:34,071 --> 00:52:38,390
And that's just about exactly right.
And so there's the personal unconscious.

941
00:52:38,391 --> 00:52:40,220
And then underneath that,
in theory,

942
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:43,490
there's what you'd called the collective
unconscious and that would be,

943
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:48,530
God only knows what that is.
But in part what it would be is whatever

944
00:52:48,531 --> 00:52:49,364
it is that makes you human from an 
evolutionary perspective and we don't 

945
00:52:52,731 --> 00:52:53,564
know,
like you have a specific mode of being 

946
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:59,300
that's a human mode of big,
I think it was Eo Wilson,

947
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:04,301
who's a great entomologist and also the 
originator of sociobiology,

948
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:10,280
which is like a branch of evolutionary 
psychology.

949
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:11,783
Um,
he studied dance forever and social 

950
00:53:13,671 --> 00:53:18,671
behavior of ants and he's one sad if,
if we could talk to enhance,

951
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,470
we wouldn't have anything to say to 
them.

952
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:25,530
And what he meant by that is that like,
answer,

953
00:53:25,531 --> 00:53:28,620
interested in a bunch of things that you
just don't care about at all.

954
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:31,230
Like they're not jealous.
They don't get jealous.

955
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,273
They don't fall in love.
They don't have sexual feelings or 

956
00:53:35,941 --> 00:53:39,060
behaviors.
They're not a cognitive creature.

957
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:39,973
It's like,
what the hell are you going to talk to 

958
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:43,250
an aunt about how it's,
how is it going carry him?

959
00:53:43,251 --> 00:53:44,700
That grain of sand,
it's like an ant.

960
00:53:44,701 --> 00:53:46,710
Doesn't mean that doesn't even care 
about that.

961
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:47,903
And so it's interesting.
It's really a profound observation 

962
00:53:50,551 --> 00:53:51,384
because what it indicates is that you 
couldn't even communicate with someone 

963
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:58,560
unless you were 99% the same as they 
are.

964
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:03,660
Because to communicate with someone 
means you have to share a whole massive,

965
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:05,580
immense set of presuppositions.

966
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,710
So for example,
if I say,

967
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:13,040
um,
I got jealous at a party last week,

968
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:15,840
it's like,
you're not going to say,

969
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:18,690
what do you mean jealous?
That isn't going to be your question.

970
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:19,561
You're going to say,
well,

971
00:54:19,561 --> 00:54:23,760
what were their particular circumstances
that he elicited that response?

972
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:27,840
I don't have to explain anger.
I don't have to explain playfulness,

973
00:54:27,841 --> 00:54:28,840
hunger,
oh,

974
00:54:28,841 --> 00:54:31,080
you know,
all the basic human motivations that you

975
00:54:31,081 --> 00:54:31,914
see displayed,
say the typical adventure movie or 

976
00:54:33,601 --> 00:54:34,434
romantic comedy.
It's like those don't need explanation 

977
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:37,524
because we're the same.
And it's that sameness that constitutes 

978
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:44,430
the essence of the collective 
unconscious.

979
00:54:44,431 --> 00:54:49,431
Now his hypothesis was that you're not 
only biologically structured,

980
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:54,480
you know in terms of your morphology of 
your physiology,

981
00:54:54,481 --> 00:54:56,970
but that that extends right up into your
brain structure.

982
00:54:56,971 --> 00:54:59,370
And even above that,
into the contents.

983
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,233
Either the contents of your psyche or at
least into the way that your psyche 

984
00:55:04,891 --> 00:55:06,780
becomes organized across time.

985
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,850
And you know,
it seems,

986
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,013
it seems like a hypothesis that's so 
bloody obvious that you can't believe 

987
00:55:13,081 --> 00:55:15,240
that people would have disputed it for 
so long.

988
00:55:15,241 --> 00:55:16,074
But experimental psychologists were very
strongly influenced by behaviorists and 

989
00:55:21,421 --> 00:55:22,254
the behaviorist assumed partly for 
ideological reasons and partly for the 

990
00:55:26,371 --> 00:55:31,371
sake of scientific simplicity that human
beings were blank slates and that all we

991
00:55:32,161 --> 00:55:34,740
were was what we learned.
Well,

992
00:55:34,741 --> 00:55:39,120
there's a book out now called human 
universals.

993
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,173
I'm unfortunately,
I can't remember the name of the author 

994
00:55:42,181 --> 00:55:43,590
right now,
but it's a book.

995
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:44,453
It's a work of sociology slash slash,
anthropology and this person has 

996
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:51,080
collected human commonality.
So what's the,

997
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:53,190
what's the same about people everywhere?
Well,

998
00:55:53,191 --> 00:55:57,150
we pretty much all wear clothes 
sometimes for protective purposes,

999
00:55:57,450 --> 00:56:00,870
but if not generally for at least for 
ceremonial purposes,

1000
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:04,050
there's pair bonding in societies.
People Fall in love.

1001
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:07,110
The basic emotions are the same.
We use fire.

1002
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:09,090
That's a big deal.
You know,

1003
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,280
cause no other animal can manage that.
There's,

1004
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:16,260
there's literally dozens and dozens of 
universal commonalities across people.

1005
00:56:16,261 --> 00:56:20,220
And that's part of the substructure of 
the collective unconscious.

1006
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:24,400
So anyways,
back the creative idea.

1007
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:25,563
Well partly your creative act is going 
to be a consequence of your attempts to 

1008
00:56:30,371 --> 00:56:31,204
integrate the peculiarities of your own 
experience with the peculiarities of 

1009
00:56:36,611 --> 00:56:40,000
your culture and the spirit and did more
general

1010
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:45,310
phenomena states of being that you share
it with other people.

1011
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:50,020
So because you come into the world and 
have your own viewpoint,

1012
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:51,183
you're,
you have access to information that no 

1013
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:53,824
other person has access to.
And so to some degree that can be the 

1014
00:56:56,981 --> 00:56:59,890
basis of your creativity,
just that information.

1015
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:04,600
But then in order to communicate it,
which is also part of being creative,

1016
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:05,500
right?
Cause he,

1017
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,333
you can't just be,
if you're creative but no one can 

1018
00:57:07,721 --> 00:57:08,590
understand you,
your,

1019
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:11,290
it's more like your schizophrenia then 
like your creative,

1020
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:12,124
right?
You have loose associations and so 

1021
00:57:13,601 --> 00:57:14,434
forth,
but you cannot put together a coherent 

1022
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:16,264
story.
So then you have to take that unique 

1023
00:57:17,711 --> 00:57:21,400
information and integrate it with your 
cultural knowledge,

1024
00:57:21,401 --> 00:57:25,180
your cultural narratives and grounded in
universal human biology.

1025
00:57:25,181 --> 00:57:27,550
And then you can present that as a 
creative act.

1026
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:28,933
Now

1027
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,710
that's one possible place for the origin
of new ideas.

1028
00:57:34,711 --> 00:57:35,700
But here's another,

1029
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:37,523
so

1030
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:39,283
remember we talked about Piaget and 
piaget basically said that to begin to 

1031
00:57:43,341 --> 00:57:44,174
understand something you acted out.
So you represent the world with your 

1032
00:57:47,541 --> 00:57:48,374
body by sitting on a chair,
you represent the chair with your body 

1033
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:52,333
by walking through a doorway,
you represent the doorway with your 

1034
00:57:54,201 --> 00:57:56,240
body.
By grabbing a glass,

1035
00:57:56,241 --> 00:57:58,430
you do the same thing.
So you're matching,

1036
00:57:58,550 --> 00:57:59,383
you're imitating the world all the time.
So you're mapping it onto your 

1037
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,700
physiological structure.
So okay,

1038
00:58:04,701 --> 00:58:08,900
so that you get a sense that would be,
that's kind of what understanding means,

1039
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:11,420
you know,
cause that's a complex term to sort of,

1040
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:14,060
to understand what does it mean to 
understand something.

1041
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:16,620
It means to get a grip on it.
And you know,

1042
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:18,920
we use those,
those terms for a reason.

1043
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,390
It's to be,
you know,

1044
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:23,300
you're standing firmly in relationship 
to it.

1045
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:25,880
You can handle it,
all of those things.

1046
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:29,780
So that's one.
So that's the beginning.

1047
00:58:29,781 --> 00:58:33,500
But then also you're capable of 
imitating so you can imitate yourself,

1048
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:37,760
which is what you do when you repeat 
experiences that had a positive outcome.

1049
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:40,880
But you can also imitate other people.
But then you think,

1050
00:58:40,881 --> 00:58:43,160
okay,
well who are those people imitating?

1051
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:44,863
Well,
the answer to that is it's like we're 

1052
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:52,090
led screens and we're constantly 
rippling imitations of imitations,

1053
00:58:54,501 --> 00:58:55,334
of imitations,
of invitations across our physiological 

1054
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:00,163
landscape.
I mean you guys are the sum total of a 

1055
00:59:02,961 --> 00:59:03,794
very long evolutionary process,
but you're also the sum total of an 

1056
00:59:06,621 --> 00:59:11,621
incredibly long process of mimicry.
And so what you mimic is your culture.

1057
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,560
So you can think of your culture.
It's something with the personality,

1058
00:59:15,561 --> 00:59:16,394
it's complex personality,
and it's the personality of your 

1059
00:59:18,621 --> 00:59:22,670
ancestors that perfectly reasonable way 
of looking at and you imitate that.

1060
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,083
You know?
That's why we call our our laws of body 

1061
00:59:27,291 --> 00:59:28,220
of laws.

1062
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:31,820
And you could say that the legal system,
especially with English common law,

1063
00:59:32,030 --> 00:59:32,863
is the articulate,
articulated representation of the 

1064
00:59:36,351 --> 00:59:39,530
imitative customs and rituals of the 
entire society.

1065
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:42,050
It's been brought right up into full 
articulation,

1066
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:47,290
but it was there to begin with.
So part of where you draw your,

1067
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:54,440
your,
your material for creativity is that you

1068
00:59:54,441 --> 00:59:55,274
observe the behaviors and interactions 
of all people who've been imitating all 

1069
00:59:58,641 --> 01:00:02,930
people since the beginning of time.
And that's unbelievably informative.

1070
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,780
It's way more informative than you could
ever represent.

1071
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:06,793
You know,
how much information someone can 

1072
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:11,540
indicate with just lifting your eyebrow 
a quarter of an inch,

1073
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:12,950
right?
That can indicate irony.

1074
01:00:12,951 --> 01:00:13,784
Anik can indicate the relationship of a 
joke to another set of jokes that that 

1075
01:00:16,491 --> 01:00:19,730
person knows that you and it,
it's very complicated.

1076
01:00:19,731 --> 01:00:22,250
You can't articulate all that,
but in some sense,

1077
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:23,270
you know it,
right?

1078
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,220
You're a player in that game.

1079
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:26,840
Well,
now and then,

1080
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,160
so then imagine,
okay,

1081
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:29,053
you've got all that embodied to the 
degree that you're a sophisticated 

1082
01:00:31,851 --> 01:00:32,684
player,
then your imagination is representing 

1083
01:00:34,791 --> 01:00:39,050
you and it's representing the world.
So that's an abstraction,

1084
01:00:39,051 --> 01:00:39,884
right?
Because your imagination is not the 

1085
01:00:40,941 --> 01:00:43,310
world.
It's a representation of the world.

1086
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:47,180
And then what you can do.
So that means in the imagination,

1087
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:51,080
there's all sorts of information that's 
about the imitative behavior.

1088
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:54,830
And then Ben,
you can talk about the image.

1089
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:57,140
That's sort of what you do when you 
interpret a dream.

1090
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:58,363
So what's your dream doing?
Your imagination is watching you wander 

1091
01:01:01,251 --> 01:01:02,084
around in the world,
you know when you have your category 

1092
01:01:03,981 --> 01:01:04,814
systems and your theories and so forth.
And so then the dream puts forth what 

1093
01:01:08,901 --> 01:01:09,734
that like an image,
an image representation of what that 

1094
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:14,294
might signify.
And it's in this weird language which 

1095
01:01:16,251 --> 01:01:18,860
has an image,
an image laden language.

1096
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:21,830
It can be,
it can range from completely incoherent,

1097
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:26,360
just juxtaposed images to unbelievably 
complex and sophisticated,

1098
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:27,433
full develop narratives.
And that's part of the process by which 

1099
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:31,903
the information that's embedded in you 
and the culture at a behavioral level 

1100
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:39,650
moves up to the imagination and then 
pops up into articulated space.

1101
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,110
So you have a dream,
the dream is about you.

1102
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,930
And then you talk about the dream and 
what you're doing.

1103
01:01:44,931 --> 01:01:49,460
You're trying to translate the images 
into articulated representations.

1104
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:50,413
And that's also a good way of thinking 
about how memory moves from the bottom 

1105
01:01:53,721 --> 01:01:56,120
up.
And what's interesting,

1106
01:01:56,750 --> 01:01:58,270
you know,
you know,

1107
01:01:58,271 --> 01:02:01,520
when sometimes you have a realization or
a moment of insight,

1108
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:03,013
you know,
and that there's a feeling that goes 

1109
01:02:03,681 --> 01:02:05,420
along with that.
It's like a charge.

1110
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:08,210
And I think it's a charge that you get 
from,

1111
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:09,253
from simplifying something,
but also from experiencing the new 

1112
01:02:11,991 --> 01:02:15,320
possibilities that emerge as a 
consequence of that realization.

1113
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:20,490
What seems to happen is that you have 
the behavioral realm,

1114
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:23,380
let's say the things you act out and all
the things you imitate.

1115
01:02:23,381 --> 01:02:24,870
It's very,
very complex.

1116
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,140
And then on top of that,
you have the image of that,

1117
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:29,123
right?
And you're trying to get the image 

1118
01:02:29,821 --> 01:02:30,654
right,
but it's really hard because this 

1119
01:02:31,321 --> 01:02:34,980
changes and this floats around.
So you're trying to get those lined up.

1120
01:02:34,981 --> 01:02:35,814
And then on top of that you're trying to
get your articulated representations 

1121
01:02:38,161 --> 01:02:42,060
lined up so that you can say what you 
know about who you are.

1122
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:44,310
And when all those come together,
you think,

1123
01:02:44,311 --> 01:02:45,750
man,
I've got my act together.

1124
01:02:45,751 --> 01:02:48,030
But now and then you'll have an insight.
You know,

1125
01:02:48,031 --> 01:02:49,920
you'll think,
well like this woman who,

1126
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,470
who I told you about who had be 
molested,

1127
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:54,360
the insight was while I was a little 
kid,

1128
01:02:54,361 --> 01:02:56,790
but so was my brother Bang.

1129
01:02:56,790 --> 01:02:57,623
It's like wow,
all sorts of things that didn't make 

1130
01:02:59,881 --> 01:03:02,070
sense anymore.
Just fall into place.

1131
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:06,360
You get this articulated representation 
that can sum up a whole bunch of,

1132
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:11,580
what would you call them,
divergent and apparently unrelated image

1133
01:03:11,581 --> 01:03:12,414
representations.
And then all of a sudden your path 

1134
01:03:14,281 --> 01:03:15,114
forward is clearer because you know more
about who you are and you know more 

1135
01:03:17,671 --> 01:03:20,340
about how you,
where you're going.

1136
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:24,150
So that is in large part what's 
happening in psychoanalysis.

1137
01:03:24,151 --> 01:03:26,280
It's certainly what happens with dream 
analysis,

1138
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,350
which is something that Freud also 
pioneered.

1139
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:32,910
No Freud believed that dreams were 
wished fulfillments and you know,

1140
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:38,910
and he believed that the function of 
dreams about wish fulfillment,

1141
01:03:38,911 --> 01:03:40,920
where to protect sleep.
So for example,

1142
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,113
navy,
you're really thirsty and you go to 

1143
01:03:44,551 --> 01:03:47,430
sleep and you dream about drinking 
water.

1144
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:51,210
Some of you who have consumed too much 
beer the night before,

1145
01:03:51,211 --> 01:03:53,250
it might be familiar with those sorts of
dreams.

1146
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:54,533
And so you're dreaming that you're 
searching out fountains and you're 

1147
01:03:57,301 --> 01:04:01,950
drinking and Freud's interpretation that
would be,

1148
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:05,460
well,
you should stay asleep.

1149
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:10,650
And so the dream is providing your 
underlying,

1150
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:12,083
interrelated motivational systems say 
the one that governs thirst with the 

1151
01:04:15,421 --> 01:04:18,960
fulfillment of its desire.
But I think that's,

1152
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:19,853
I really think that's wrong,
although it's weird because dreams of 

1153
01:04:22,261 --> 01:04:24,120
course could be doing all sorts of 
things,

1154
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:29,660
but what seems to happen instead,
I realized this most particularly once I

1155
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:31,074
heard about a study about the effects of
testosterone cycling testosterone on 

1156
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:39,060
female sexual activity.
So the plan is this,

1157
01:04:39,061 --> 01:04:39,894
is that in women,
testosterone levels vary across the 

1158
01:04:42,631 --> 01:04:45,950
monthly cycle and so does sexual desire.
And

1159
01:04:47,490 --> 01:04:49,560
what seems to happen is that as 
testosterone,

1160
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:50,543
testosterone increases,
the frequency of sexual acts doesn't 

1161
01:04:54,901 --> 01:04:55,734
necessarily increase,
but the frequency of sexual fantasy 

1162
01:04:58,801 --> 01:04:59,634
increases.
And so the f the hormone is driving the 

1163
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:05,070
fantasies and then the fantasies drive 
the behavior.

1164
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:05,933
It's something like that.
And so the dream isn't fulfilling a 

1165
01:05:09,331 --> 01:05:10,164
wish.
What it's doing is that's how the 

1166
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:16,680
motivational system manifests itself in 
a plan for action.

1167
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:17,681
It's like,
well,

1168
01:05:17,681 --> 01:05:18,514
you could be,
you should be going to look for sources 

1169
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:23,260
of water if you're thirsty.
And so because of the,

1170
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:24,333
you know,
your hypothalamus has to communicate 

1171
01:05:25,541 --> 01:05:26,374
with you somehow.
It doesn't just grip your behavior and 

1172
01:05:28,601 --> 01:05:30,910
move you around like a robot,
you know,

1173
01:05:30,911 --> 01:05:35,320
it has to indicate what the state,
what your state is.

1174
01:05:35,321 --> 01:05:36,154
It does that all sorts of ways.
And then start tilting you towards a 

1175
01:05:39,251 --> 01:05:40,084
solution using your memories and your 
skills and everything that would be 

1176
01:05:42,401 --> 01:05:45,310
related to successful outcomes of that 
form,

1177
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:46,893
that form in the past.
And the other thing I should say about 

1178
01:05:49,991 --> 01:05:50,824
creativity,
and this is I think something very 

1179
01:05:52,241 --> 01:05:55,890
useful for understanding people's 
reactions to psychoanalysis.

1180
01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:00,760
I have a lot of creative people in my 
clientele for a variety of reasons.

1181
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:01,743
And some who aren't creative and 
creativity is a trade and most people 

1182
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:07,960
aren't creative.
It's not common.

1183
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:09,423
So,
and some people who are creative are so 

1184
01:06:10,841 --> 01:06:11,674
creative,
it's just absolutely beyond 

1185
01:06:13,091 --> 01:06:14,230
comprehension.
So,

1186
01:06:14,730 --> 01:06:17,230
um,
Picasso for example,

1187
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:22,410
created 65,000 works of art three a day 
for 65 years now that guy was created.

1188
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:26,553
So anyways,
lots of people aren't creative and 

1189
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,290
they're not interested in psychoanalytic
ideas.

1190
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:34,030
They're not interested in architectural 
ideas.

1191
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:34,864
They're not really gripped by narrative.
So if you happen to be one marker for 

1192
01:06:37,871 --> 01:06:38,980
creativity,
by the way,

1193
01:06:38,981 --> 01:06:42,670
for openness is I'm really liking 
fiction.

1194
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:44,553
So,
and women actually like fiction more 

1195
01:06:46,091 --> 01:06:49,990
than men and because women are actually 
slightly higher and part of openness,

1196
01:06:49,991 --> 01:06:52,690
the men are.
So what else?

1197
01:06:52,691 --> 01:06:54,490
If you,
you like poetry,

1198
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,140
you know,
and it gives you an aesthetic,

1199
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:57,513
an aesthetic experience.
If you really get deeply involved in 

1200
01:06:59,741 --> 01:07:00,574
music,
if you're able to produce things that 

1201
01:07:02,591 --> 01:07:03,424
are created.

1202
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,690
So if you have the kind of mine that 
works in association.

1203
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:09,900
So for example,
if I told you guys up,

1204
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:11,163
all right,
write down as many words as you can in 

1205
01:07:13,271 --> 01:07:15,490
the next three minutes that begin with 
the letter l.

1206
01:07:16,420 --> 01:07:19,390
Those of you who are more creative would
come up with more words.

1207
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,480
So there's a verbal fluency component,
I could say.

1208
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:24,370
Okay.
Um,

1209
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:26,620
how many uses can you think of for a 
break?

1210
01:07:27,220 --> 01:07:28,053
And then I would score that.
The first would be how many uses you 

1211
01:07:30,461 --> 01:07:31,294
came up with.
That'd be the sheer number I'd throw 

1212
01:07:32,861 --> 01:07:35,410
away.
The stupid ones that make no sense.

1213
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:38,180
And often you have to get a panel of 
people to,

1214
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,420
to make that judgment strike you.
You know,

1215
01:07:40,421 --> 01:07:42,760
you could say,
well it's a thing.

1216
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:45,220
You could use it as a thing.
It's like no x,

1217
01:07:45,221 --> 01:07:47,020
you don't get,
you don't get a score for that.

1218
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:48,213
So then you get another score for how 
uncommon your response was because 

1219
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,113
that's an originality dimension.
And actually if you calculate those two 

1220
01:07:57,521 --> 01:08:01,900
dimensions,
fluency and originality from a divergent

1221
01:08:01,901 --> 01:08:04,480
thinking tasks,
which is the one I just told you about,

1222
01:08:04,570 --> 01:08:08,110
you can predict how creative people 
aren't quite well anyways.

1223
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:09,363
The really creative people seem to have 
a deep wellspring of unconscious ideas 

1224
01:08:13,031 --> 01:08:13,864
that are always flowing forth.
And some of those people dream like mad 

1225
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:20,930
and they have extremely sophisticated 
and complex dreams and those dreams seem

1226
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:23,510
to guide their behavior.
So,

1227
01:08:23,730 --> 01:08:24,563
and that's quite,
that's quite entertaining when you see 

1228
01:08:26,691 --> 01:08:27,524
that in psychotherapy,
if you have an interest in such things 

1229
01:08:29,451 --> 01:08:30,560
and you might say,
well,

1230
01:08:30,561 --> 01:08:33,800
how do you know if your dream 
interpretation is true?

1231
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:35,600
And that's for that is,
well,

1232
01:08:35,601 --> 01:08:36,434
how do you know how you interpreted?
The last book you read is true and 

1233
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:40,940
that's you.

1234
01:08:40,940 --> 01:08:41,773
That is you don't know how you don't.
And even if you did and you don't know 

1235
01:08:45,561 --> 01:08:47,180
how you know it,
right?

1236
01:08:47,181 --> 01:08:48,014
Because lots of people can read a book 
and they come away with slightly 

1237
01:08:49,911 --> 01:08:50,744
different interpretations of it.
And that's because did imagine that the 

1238
01:08:53,541 --> 01:08:58,541
book is a multilevel pattern and then 
the reader is a multilevel pattern.

1239
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:03,140
And then if you put those two together,
you get a multilevel pattern that's made

1240
01:09:03,141 --> 01:09:03,974
out of the reader end of the book.
And that's going to be unique for every 

1241
01:09:06,411 --> 01:09:07,244
single reader except that we have 
commonalities of structure and so that 

1242
01:09:10,581 --> 01:09:14,990
we can communicate about it.
So you read a book and it strikes you,

1243
01:09:14,991 --> 01:09:17,270
certain things strike you and certain 
things seem right.

1244
01:09:17,271 --> 01:09:20,720
If you do a dream interpretation,
it's a collaboration between you and the

1245
01:09:20,721 --> 01:09:24,110
client about the,
about the interpretation.

1246
01:09:24,111 --> 01:09:27,350
So usually what I do is I have people,
first of all,

1247
01:09:27,351 --> 01:09:30,140
they'll tell me their dream from 
beginning to end.

1248
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:31,393
Now,
Freud would say already you're 

1249
01:09:33,201 --> 01:09:36,170
introducing all sorts of bias because 
they're not telling you the dream.

1250
01:09:36,171 --> 01:09:39,960
They're telling you the dream as they 
interpret and remember it.

1251
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:40,761
It's like,
yeah,

1252
01:09:40,761 --> 01:09:41,960
that's a problem.
So,

1253
01:09:41,961 --> 01:09:43,370
but you do what you can,
you know,

1254
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:44,383
and I tell people,
just write it down as fast as you can 

1255
01:09:46,311 --> 01:09:47,144
and try not to think about it too much 
because we don't want post dream 

1256
01:09:49,671 --> 01:09:50,504
editing.
So then I'll listen to it and then then 

1257
01:09:54,621 --> 01:09:55,454
they'll tell it to me again slowly,
and then I'll listen to a sentence and 

1258
01:09:58,251 --> 01:10:01,610
I'll let my associational network work 
on it and see if,

1259
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:02,503
see what that reminds me of.
And then I'll ask the person what it 

1260
01:10:05,241 --> 01:10:07,520
reminds them of.
And then we'll talk about these.

1261
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:11,030
Those are the direct associations.
So those are the things Freud would call

1262
01:10:11,031 --> 01:10:12,800
free associations.
And you could say,

1263
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:16,220
well around every utterance,
like a sentence,

1264
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:18,740
there's a collection of potential 
meanings,

1265
01:10:18,741 --> 01:10:19,310
right?

1266
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:21,530
And those meetings might be direct 
meanings,

1267
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:25,610
like really tightly associated with it 
to sort of loose meanings.

1268
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:26,743
And so you can hit it back and forth 
with the client and therapist until you 

1269
01:10:30,471 --> 01:10:31,041
faint.
Oh yeah.

1270
01:10:31,041 --> 01:10:32,360
Okay.
That seems to be,

1271
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:33,463
that seems to be where that's going.
And you're also thinking about it and 

1272
01:10:35,441 --> 01:10:36,274
relationship to the person's current 
life experiences and the rest of the 

1273
01:10:39,231 --> 01:10:41,870
dream and maybe all the dreams they told
you about before.

1274
01:10:41,871 --> 01:10:45,950
So it's insanely complicated,
but it's what people do when they listen

1275
01:10:45,951 --> 01:10:48,140
to a conversation,
you know,

1276
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:50,450
how do you,
how do you know your interpretation of a

1277
01:10:50,451 --> 01:10:53,120
conversation is true?
Well,

1278
01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:56,143
you know,
there's a variety of ways that you can 

1279
01:10:57,081 --> 01:10:59,180
approximate that,
but yet you don't know.

1280
01:10:59,181 --> 01:11:02,030
And there's lots of different ways of 
interpreting a conversation.

1281
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:04,250
That's why the postmodernists,
you know,

1282
01:11:04,251 --> 01:11:06,890
ended up in their little hole with 
regards to literature.

1283
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,660
They realize that,
well,

1284
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:11,450
there's no limit to the number of ways 
you can interpret a book.

1285
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:13,470
And,
but then they took the next step,

1286
01:11:13,471 --> 01:11:14,304
which,
which was that therefore it has no 

1287
01:11:15,391 --> 01:11:16,141
meaning.
It's like,

1288
01:11:16,141 --> 01:11:16,531
no,
no,

1289
01:11:16,531 --> 01:11:18,030
no,
wrong,

1290
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:22,280
wrong.
That's very unsophisticated thinking.

1291
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,153
It just means that the way the book 
portrays meaning is exceedingly complex 

1292
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:27,593
and you can't describe it using normal 
linear rationality doesn't mean the 

1293
01:11:31,741 --> 01:11:34,360
meaning isn't there.
That's so pathetic cetera.

1294
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:39,050
That it's dangerous too because it means
that nothing has any meaning.

1295
01:11:39,051 --> 01:11:41,520
And you know that's the most dangerous 
theory that,

1296
01:11:42,030 --> 01:11:46,260
so anyways,
you talked to the person about the dream

1297
01:11:46,261 --> 01:11:49,080
and the dream image and about what that 
triggers off in their memory.

1298
01:11:49,081 --> 01:11:53,190
And you also watch what they say because
sometimes,

1299
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:55,430
so for example,
someone,

1300
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:56,393
this just happened recently,
someone might be describing a dream 

1301
01:11:58,501 --> 01:11:59,670
where they,
you know,

1302
01:11:59,671 --> 01:12:01,920
where they're wandering around somewhere
and they'll say,

1303
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:03,780
and I'm taking the wrong road.

1304
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:04,771
You Think,
oh,

1305
01:12:04,771 --> 01:12:05,604
okay,
well now we know what your dream meant 

1306
01:12:06,481 --> 01:12:09,720
cause you just said it.
I'm taking the wrong road.

1307
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:10,733
And that's a Freudian slip.
And it's so interesting because if you 

1308
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:16,020
listen to people tell their dreams,
you have to kind of listen.

1309
01:12:16,050 --> 01:12:16,883
It's like they have two minds talking at
the same time and one is describing the 

1310
01:12:20,731 --> 01:12:21,564
dream,
but the other one is describing their 

1311
01:12:23,401 --> 01:12:25,530
life and they don't even notice the 
connection.

1312
01:12:25,531 --> 01:12:26,970
And you pointed out and they go,
oh yeah,

1313
01:12:26,971 --> 01:12:27,810
right,
right.

1314
01:12:27,811 --> 01:12:30,540
I didn't know I said that.
And that's a Freudian slip.

1315
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:34,200
And I think what's happening in part is 
the right hemisphere,

1316
01:12:34,201 --> 01:12:37,770
which is an image accumulation and 
aggregation system.

1317
01:12:37,771 --> 01:12:42,771
It's kind of a low resolution pattern.
Collection System uses mostly images and

1318
01:12:43,381 --> 01:12:45,450
it tries to put them together in 
meaningful ways,

1319
01:12:45,451 --> 01:12:46,284
but the meaning is vague and 
comprehensive and then the left 

1320
01:12:49,651 --> 01:12:52,680
hemisphere roughly speaking,
which is the linguistic hemisphere,

1321
01:12:52,860 --> 01:12:53,693
is trying to state what that says in 
words and it's very difficult to make 

1322
01:12:57,601 --> 01:12:59,550
that,
to make that transformation,

1323
01:12:59,551 --> 01:13:00,384
but that's why I dream analysis works 
and part is because you're facilitating 

1324
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:04,253
the movement of the information in the 
images into the articulated part of the 

1325
01:13:07,981 --> 01:13:08,814
personality.

1326
01:13:09,020 --> 01:13:13,170
You're moving information up the 
abstraction hierarchy to the point where

1327
01:13:13,171 --> 01:13:18,000
it can be well utilized and that's now 
I'll end this with,

1328
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:18,923
I'll end this discussion of Freud with a
description of some research that was 

1329
01:13:23,821 --> 01:13:24,654
done recently by relatively recently,
let's say the last 20 years by this 

1330
01:13:29,551 --> 01:13:34,551
psychologist at the University of Texas 
at Austin who's name is James Pennebaker

1331
01:13:36,061 --> 01:13:38,400
and pennebaker's,
a particularly smart psychologist.

1332
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:39,683
He had this idea,
Freud had another idea that was related 

1333
01:13:42,301 --> 01:13:43,134
to therapy and he thought that what 
happened if you came into therapy and 

1334
01:13:45,271 --> 01:13:49,860
you talked about a traumatic event with 
that you are cured by Catharsis,

1335
01:13:49,861 --> 01:13:54,240
which meant that that trauma had to have
a bunch of emotion associated with it.

1336
01:13:54,241 --> 01:13:55,074
And that was repressed.
But it was down there and kind of 

1337
01:13:56,341 --> 01:13:59,670
struggling to get up and causing you all
sorts of stress and misery,

1338
01:13:59,671 --> 01:14:00,840
trying to hold it down.

1339
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:05,670
And then if you could just tell someone 
about it and like express your feelings,

1340
01:14:05,850 --> 01:14:06,683
then that would help you.
Expressing your feelings does not help 

1341
01:14:08,851 --> 01:14:10,110
you by the way.
But,

1342
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:11,363
but because that turns out to be wrong,
although it's wrong in an interesting 

1343
01:14:15,131 --> 01:14:16,600
and useful way,
cause it's sort of,

1344
01:14:16,780 --> 01:14:17,613
it's almost right.
So with pennebaker did was he took 

1345
01:14:20,171 --> 01:14:24,490
undergraduates and he had them come into
the lab and for three on three sick,

1346
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:25,653
sick quenches days and he had them write
for 15 minutes each day about the worst 

1347
01:14:29,591 --> 01:14:30,424
thing that they had ever done or the 
worst thing that had ever happened to 

1348
01:14:32,231 --> 01:14:33,064
them.
Often people are traumatized by 

1349
01:14:34,301 --> 01:14:37,180
something they did.
Not something that happened to them.

1350
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:38,014
In fact more often cause someone watches
themselves do something absolutely 

1351
01:14:41,051 --> 01:14:42,610
horrific.
And then they think,

1352
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:44,620
oh my God,
I did that.

1353
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:46,900
Who am I?
They don't know.

1354
01:14:47,230 --> 01:14:48,100
Then that's,
you know,

1355
01:14:48,101 --> 01:14:50,920
things started coming unglued.
So anyways,

1356
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:52,563
pennebaker had them do that and then for
the next two weeks they felt pretty 

1357
01:14:55,001 --> 01:14:55,834
wretched about it.
And so that's interesting cause if they 

1358
01:14:57,551 --> 01:14:58,384
would have only measured the result of 
the intervention in a two week timespan 

1359
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:03,700
everyone wanted to said,
never,

1360
01:15:03,701 --> 01:15:06,820
never write down your traumatic 
experiences cause it'll make you worse.

1361
01:15:07,150 --> 01:15:07,983
But over the next six months,
what happened in particular was that 

1362
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:14,410
their physical health improved.
They went to the doctor last,

1363
01:15:14,411 --> 01:15:15,244
they reported less illness and so forth.
It's because their overall level of 

1364
01:15:18,131 --> 01:15:21,280
stress decreased for complex reasons 
that we can talk about later.

1365
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:24,400
But then pennebaker being and excellent 
scientist,

1366
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:25,391
he thought,
okay,

1367
01:15:25,391 --> 01:15:27,940
well Catharsis works here.
You're expressing your,

1368
01:15:28,030 --> 01:15:30,070
you know,
trauma and poof you're fixed.

1369
01:15:30,071 --> 01:15:32,710
But he went back and he thought,
well wait a second,

1370
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,070
maybe how you express it matters.

1371
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:35,903
So we went back and he counted all the 
words that were associated with emotion 

1372
01:15:38,890 --> 01:15:42,220
and all the words that were associated 
with understanding and cognition.

1373
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:47,430
And what he found was two things.
One was the more words that you used,

1374
01:15:47,431 --> 01:15:48,264
particularly as your narrative developed
that indicated comprehension and 

1375
01:15:52,271 --> 01:15:55,240
understanding the better you did over 
time.

1376
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:59,560
And so what happens is not,
it's not the expressing of your emotion,

1377
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:00,843
it's the expressing of your emotion and 
then the weaving of the memory into a 

1378
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:11,070
new coherent representation from which 
you derive a moral.

1379
01:16:11,620 --> 01:16:15,670
So what's the moral of a trauma?
Don't let it happen again.

1380
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:16,983
That's the moral and the the threat 
systems are going to be throwing that 

1381
01:16:20,111 --> 01:16:22,570
thing up at you constantly until you 
figure it out.

1382
01:16:22,660 --> 01:16:26,020
How did I get into this?
How do I avoid it in the future?

1383
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:28,780
And it doesn't mean it's your fault,
but your anxiety systems,

1384
01:16:28,781 --> 01:16:29,710
they don't care about that.

1385
01:16:30,070 --> 01:16:33,520
They care about how you're not going to 
fall into the same hole.

1386
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:37,120
And the only way to do that is to 
analyze the causal pathways that lead to

1387
01:16:37,121 --> 01:16:37,954
the whole to begin with and see if you 
can either reconfigure your behavior in 

1388
01:16:41,681 --> 01:16:43,750
your attitudes so that that doesn't 
happen again.

1389
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:46,750
Or maybe you just don't go those places 
anymore,

1390
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:48,033
you know,
either way and you're the trauma threat 

1391
01:16:52,091 --> 01:16:52,924
systems.
As soon as you come up with a 

1392
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:58,030
comprehensive representation that you 
believe in,

1393
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:00,220
they'll leave you alone.
And this can happen very,

1394
01:17:00,221 --> 01:17:02,380
very rapidly.
Like with nightmares,

1395
01:17:02,381 --> 01:17:03,214
I,
I've cured people's nightmares in one 

1396
01:17:04,391 --> 01:17:05,440
session,
no problem.

1397
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:09,060
I asked them to bring the nightwear 
mirror too,

1398
01:17:09,670 --> 01:17:12,920
opt in to their imagination.
Maybe someone's chasing them.

1399
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:14,120
It's like,
okay,

1400
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:17,450
think about them chasing.
You got to visualize it.

1401
01:17:17,451 --> 01:17:19,580
Really visualize it.
The more real you make it,

1402
01:17:19,581 --> 01:17:20,300
the better.

1403
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:21,530
Okay?
They're being chased.

1404
01:17:21,531 --> 01:17:23,390
How are you feeling?
I'm all anxious in the frame.

1405
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:26,930
Okay,
turn around and look at the thing that's

1406
01:17:26,931 --> 01:17:29,210
chasing you.
So they do that.

1407
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,610
Then maybe they tell saying what it is 
or whatever,

1408
01:17:31,611 --> 01:17:33,770
but maybe they don't even do that.
And I say,

1409
01:17:33,771 --> 01:17:34,191
okay,
now,

1410
01:17:34,191 --> 01:17:35,024
before you go to bed at night,
just when you're almost falling to 

1411
01:17:37,311 --> 01:17:38,144
sleep,
you're in a hypnagogic state where 

1412
01:17:39,171 --> 01:17:41,450
images are starting to come.
You run that,

1413
01:17:42,070 --> 01:17:44,030
they run that Poof,
that nightmare is gone.

1414
01:17:44,570 --> 01:17:45,403
And the reason for it is that they've 
now reconfigured themselves as the 

1415
01:17:49,101 --> 01:17:51,590
thing,
not the thing that's being chased.

1416
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:52,543
That's prey animal.
They've configured themselves as the 

1417
01:17:54,951 --> 01:17:59,120
thing that can turn around and face the 
thing that's chasing them.

1418
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:04,370
And that's the same Motif as the dragon 
hunting the union archetypes,

1419
01:18:04,371 --> 01:18:05,204
right?
Face what you're afraid of it not will 

1420
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:09,440
cure you.
And that's really one of the fundamental

1421
01:18:09,441 --> 01:18:13,350
motifs of Freud and psychoanalysis.
So you know,

1422
01:18:13,351 --> 01:18:14,184
when you have an exam on Thursday,
I'll post questions about sort of 

1423
01:18:16,851 --> 01:18:20,690
representative questions on the exam 
when I get home after this lecture,

1424
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:24,350
probably deceiving the liquor there.
The essays are,

1425
01:18:24,351 --> 01:18:26,990
that test is here.
It's multiple choice.

1426
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:29,780
You'll have no problem finishing it.
It's not that loan.

1427
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:32,030
And if you've done the readings and come
to the lectures,

1428
01:18:32,570 --> 01:18:36,820
you'll probably do fine.
So it's not a tricky test.
