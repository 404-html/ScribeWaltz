1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:03,763
Okay,
so we're going to talk about piaget 

2
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:16,110
today and as I believe I mentioned to 
you before,

3
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,890
Psj was perhaps the 20 20th centuries 
for most developmental psychologist.

4
00:00:21,991 --> 00:00:24,480
He didn't regard himself as a 
psychologist.

5
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:27,270
However,
fact,

6
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:28,104
a lot of the people who've been great 
psychologists have come in from outside 

7
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,950
the field.
It's often engineers,

8
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:33,023
for example,
engineers that helped us establish most 

9
00:00:34,471 --> 00:00:36,960
of our statistics anyways.
Piaget,

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,820
I suppose would have regarded himself 
more as a biologist be called themselves

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,673
a genetic epistemologist,
and by genetic he didn't mean the genes 

12
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:50,670
that organize your cells and spin you up
out of nothing.

13
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:51,983
He meant beginnings as in genesis and 
then an epistemologist with someone who 

14
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:56,994
was interested in how structures of 
knowledge emerge and how they're 

15
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:01,704
constituted.
So we actually thought of himself as a 

16
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:03,744
biological philosopher now know one of 
the things that's kind of sad about 

17
00:01:09,331 --> 00:01:10,164
learning about great theories is that 
you'll hardly ever learned about how 

18
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:17,490
peculiar that people who formulate them 
are.

19
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,323
Because generally they're 
extraordinarily interesting people you 

20
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:20,964
know,
and that that in some ways that often 

21
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,680
they get sanitized in some way once 
they've become respectable.

22
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:30,681
And that's really quite unfortunate.
Piaget was really a genius.

23
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,970
He was offered a position at a large 
museum,

24
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,800
and I remember,
I remember correctly,

25
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:41,730
it was perhaps it wasn't director,
but it was the position of approximately

26
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:44,760
that stature.
He was offered that when he was 10 years

27
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:48,180
old,
he'd written a paper on Mollusk behavior

28
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:53,181
which was published and his parents told
the museum people that he,

29
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,600
of course they didn't know he was 10,
you know,

30
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,640
that he probably wasn't up for the job 
at that time.

31
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,380
So,
but that gives you some example,

32
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:05,790
some idea about the magnitude of his 
intellect and Piaget wrote a lot.

33
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,550
And you know,
usually what you hear about if you study

34
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,190
piaget in North America,
if you hear about piaget,

35
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:13,260
you hear about his stages of 
development,

36
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,400
sensory motor,
etc.

37
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,483
And uh,
that really wasn't what piaget was all 

38
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,264
that interest to Vietnam.
There wAs something about the idea of 

39
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:24,594
countable stages that seem to appeal to 
north american developmental 

40
00:02:29,221 --> 00:02:30,054
psychologists,
but piaget didn't really regard that 

41
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,693
necessarily as either the central or the
most important part of this theoretical 

42
00:02:36,211 --> 00:02:37,100
edifice.
Um,

43
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,183
and you know,
part of what piaget has been criticized 

44
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,123
for in recent years is that the stages 
don't necessarily occur either as he 

45
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:47,070
described her in the order that he 
described,

46
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:52,071
but in some ways he wouldn't have found 
that particularly distressing because it

47
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:57,141
was more of an attempt to explain how 
the personality emerged out.

48
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,913
Nothing in some ways because in some 
ways you've kind of emerged out of 

49
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,831
nothing,
you know,

50
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:03,664
and it's not that easy to figure out for
piaget in some ways you've sort of 

51
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:07,804
booted up.
Although he wouldn't haVe used that 

52
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:12,610
metaphor obviously having existed in the
time before.

53
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,780
That was a commonly known phenomena.
So

54
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,980
he also was concerned abouT high level 
metaphysical problems.

55
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:24,814
And so one of the things that really 
motivated piaget was the contradiction 

56
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:34,060
between science and religion.
That was very painful for him.

57
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,373
And one of the things that he had set 
out to do as a young man was to bridge 

58
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:40,984
the gap between science and religion.
And in some ways you might think about 

59
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:44,464
that in relationship to the sorts of 
things we talked about last class is 

60
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:48,514
that
he was attempting to bridge the gap 

61
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:56,290
between a description of the world and a
prescriptive description of the world,

62
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,950
which means what the world is and how 
the world should be or what the world is

63
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:02,110
and how you should act.
and

64
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,473
I think that's the most straightforward 
way of thinking about the division 

65
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:10,060
between religion and science because you
need to know how to act.

66
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:10,923
You can think about it as a division 
between morality and science or you can 

67
00:04:12,861 --> 00:04:15,940
think about it as a division between 
behavioral wisdom and science,

68
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:18,210
which I think is even a better way of 
thinking about it because it,

69
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,180
it takes the specifically religious 
element out of it.

70
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,820
so,
but anyways,

71
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,840
piaget wanted to devote his life to 
solving that problem.

72
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:29,674
And I would say that's what he did.
He also identified an interesting stage 

73
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:34,894
that you also hear very little about,
but seems to be to be something worthy 

74
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,480
of note and also worthy of 
consideration.

75
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,823
He thought that many people in their 
late adolescence went through a 

76
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,124
messiaNic stage.
And what he meant by that was that when 

77
00:04:48,161 --> 00:04:51,400
late adolescents or young adults,
we're trying to orient themselves in the

78
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:52,234
world,
they were trying to figure out how they 

79
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:57,010
might plot their pAth forward in life so
that they actually made a difference,

80
00:04:57,011 --> 00:04:57,844
you know,
so they started to become concerned 

81
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:03,250
about the state of the world and about 
their role in determining that state and

82
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,453
getting interested in and perhaps 
involved in large scale political or 

83
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:09,250
social movements.

84
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,083
And he was the only psychologists that 
I've ever seen who actually identified 

85
00:05:12,881 --> 00:05:14,380
that as a stage,
but it's switched.

86
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,700
We're thinking about,
you know,

87
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,713
because it certainly is the case that 
many young people do pass through a 

88
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:23,230
stage that's something like that.
And,

89
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,800
um,
it's interesting to speculate on it as a

90
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,310
standard part of human development.
Now.

91
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:31,144
I think it's probably more 
characteristic of people with certain 

92
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:34,414
personality types.
So I suspect if you're more extroverted 

93
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:38,560
and you're more open,
um,

94
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,320
particularly more open,
which is the creativity dimension in the

95
00:05:41,321 --> 00:05:45,730
big five that you're more likely to be 
politically and socially,

96
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,080
uh,
compelled,

97
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,221
you know,
so we know,

98
00:05:48,221 --> 00:05:49,054
for example,
that openness is a very good predictor 

99
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:53,230
of things like political liberalism and 
uh,

100
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,093
you know,
certainly a lot of the millennial 

101
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:56,674
movements and that religious movements 
that you see on campus that have what 

102
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,403
would arguably be a political base 
seemed to be associated with high 

103
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,114
openness.

104
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,540
So maybe that stage doesn't occur in 
everyone's life,

105
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,850
but it certainly seems to occur in many 
people's lives.

106
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:14,630
Okay.
So now you might ask yourself,

107
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:16,280
well,
what was piaget up to?

108
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:21,281
And while he wanted to figure out a lot 
of things and he was interested in very,

109
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:24,350
very fundamental issues.
So for example,

110
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:28,070
his theories dealt with things like 
number in space.

111
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,590
Product can't see that very well.
It doesn't matter.

112
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:32,750
I'll tell you what it says,
time and speed,

113
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,400
permanent objects.
How did,

114
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,360
how did a person developed the notion of
what constituted a permanent object?

115
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,060
How do you know when one thing is the 
same?

116
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:42,830
When it changes into something 
different,

117
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:43,664
so for example,
if you pour one bit of liquid from one 

118
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:46,334
container into another,
how do you know that the amount of 

119
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:49,670
liquid is the same?
Um,

120
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,990
how do children develop their ideas of 
chance and causality?

121
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,860
How do they develop their concerns about
morality and their moral knowledge?

122
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,260
What,
what the,

123
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,190
what are they doing when they're 
playing?

124
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:02,383
And I think actually piaget's most 
fundamental contribution as far as I'm 

125
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:09,290
concerned,
came in his studies and analysis of play

126
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:13,550
and also to some degree his,
his analysis of dreams and he also spent

127
00:07:13,551 --> 00:07:17,360
a lot of time giving serious 
consideration to the role that imitation

128
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:18,194
played in,
in the scaffolding of the human 

129
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,670
personality.
And so,

130
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,120
um,
so some of the,

131
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,283
so,

132
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,950
uh,
piaget believed that,

133
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,953
well,
I think this is the easiest way to talk 

134
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:45,230
about it.
Actually will use this diagram here.

135
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,500
So I'll shut this light,
go off.

136
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,920
It took me a long time to construct this
diagram.

137
00:08:01,921 --> 00:08:04,440
So not because it's all that technically
difficult,

138
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:07,160
but it took a while to think it up.
So I want to give you a little bit about

139
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,660
background to it.
So I imagine that

140
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,213
one of the things that distinguishes a 
human being from a computational device 

141
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:18,814
say,
or at least the standard sort of 

142
00:08:19,451 --> 00:08:22,660
computational devices that are primary 
cognitive problem,

143
00:08:22,661 --> 00:08:26,440
is how to perceive the world so that we 
can act in it so that we can get what we

144
00:08:26,441 --> 00:08:28,330
need to have or one.
Okay,

145
00:08:28,331 --> 00:08:31,270
so all three of those things are roughly
equivalent importance,

146
00:08:31,271 --> 00:08:32,104
right?
You have to be able to perceive and you 

147
00:08:34,031 --> 00:08:36,850
have to be able to act because if you 
can't act and he can't get what you need

148
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:39,490
and if you can't get what you need,
then of course there isn't an you.

149
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,743
And so we're trying to always solve 
those problems simultaneously and we're 

150
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:46,420
also trying to do it in a way that's 
sustainable.

151
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,273
Now,
what that means in part is that the 

152
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,100
knowledge structures of human beings are
organized or or they are organized along

153
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:57,804
those three dimensions in those three 
dimensions also constitute the problem 

154
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:01,320
space.

155
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,153
In some sense,
that has to be addressed for a solUtion 

156
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:05,244
to be useful.
So not only do you have to be able to 

157
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,873
perceive in some accurate manner,
but the accuracy is determined in part 

158
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:12,803
on in terms of whether or not the way 
that you're perceiving helps you pursue 

159
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:17,214
something that you want to pursue and 
then the utility of wanting to pursue 

160
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:20,904
something is dependent to some degree on
the relationship between the utility of 

161
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:26,970
that and the things that you need to 
continue to survive.

162
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,673
Now some psychologists have addressed 
that by thinking about such things as 

163
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:34,140
fundamental drives,
you know,

164
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,003
and that was mostly a behavioral idea in
some ways and the drive might be hunger 

165
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,153
and,
and the idea of a drive would be that 

166
00:09:41,731 --> 00:09:42,564
hunger is a motivator that helps you put
together a strings of motor behaviors 

167
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:48,540
that are sort of run out in automatic 
sequence so that you can,

168
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:49,853
you can get the end that you want and 
continue one perhaps to fulfill another 

169
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:54,144
drive.

170
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,440
But the idea of drive is a little bit on
the oversimplified side.

171
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,603
although it has its place.
I think that you can conceptualize the 

172
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:06,930
relationship between all of these by 
thinking in the following manner.

173
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:11,370
So imagine first of all that people are 
after something,

174
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,590
generally speaking.
Now,

175
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,470
if you look at us,
you can kind of tell that were the sorts

176
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:17,304
of creatures that are after things and 
the way that you can tell that is first 

177
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:23,070
of all that we can move and do so 
frequently,

178
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:27,030
so we're always on a voyage of some sort
of a journey of some sort from point one

179
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:31,680
to point to or from point a to point b.
I would say as well that that's also the

180
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:35,820
hallmark of a simple story.
If you're telling someone a story,

181
00:10:35,821 --> 00:10:39,030
generally what you do is you tell them 
about a time that you were somewhere and

182
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:41,100
then you did some things and you went 
somewhere else.

183
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,570
It's a very,
very simple story.

184
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,413
Now the advantage of thinking about it 
as a story is that it helps you 

185
00:10:50,431 --> 00:10:51,264
understand that the entire cognitive 
structure can't be reduced to 

186
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,770
necessarily anything that's,
for example,

187
00:10:58,771 --> 00:11:02,910
that's drive like you have to think 
about it as more personality like and so

188
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,120
you want something you orient yourself 
towards.

189
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,050
Now,
the way you do that,

190
00:11:07,051 --> 00:11:09,840
generally speaking,
is with your sensory and your conceptual

191
00:11:09,841 --> 00:11:10,591
systems,
right?

192
00:11:10,591 --> 00:11:12,780
So for example,
if you want to walk towards the door,

193
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,853
then you turn your head and you make 
yourself a mortal of the door and that 

194
00:11:17,281 --> 00:11:18,114
model has to be bounded by its relevance
to your action so you know the things 

195
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:25,980
that are going to be relevant to you 
about the door,

196
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:28,200
for example,
might be whether or not it's tall enough

197
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:29,034
for you to walk through or whether or 
not the door is open or closed so that 

198
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:33,450
you can,
as you're walking towards it,

199
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:34,284
you can organize your body so that you 
can interact with the object as you see 

200
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:38,994
fit.

201
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,163
Now you pick your goals,
know search for all sorts of different 

202
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:46,650
reasons and some of those reasons are 
more fundamental than others.

203
00:11:46,651 --> 00:11:49,620
So for example,
fundamental by fundamental,

204
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:53,160
I would mean likely what I mean by 
fundamental,

205
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,110
something like evolutionarily ancient,
you know,

206
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:57,580
so the,
the older,

207
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,473
the necessity or the older,
the system that's evolved to to allow 

208
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:04,624
you to pursue the necessity,
the more fundamental it is and there's 

209
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,043
not.
There's ways of identifying what 

210
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:13,210
constitutes the fundamental elements of 
goal seeking behavior,

211
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,930
and you can do that in part by comparing
yourself to other animals,

212
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,730
you know,
and so mammals,

213
00:12:18,731 --> 00:12:19,564
for example,
all seem to jet to experience something 

214
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,300
that you might regard as anger or at 
least defensive aggression.

215
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:26,620
They're all hungry,
you know,

216
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,170
they all have the,
the,

217
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,580
they all act as if they're,
they're,

218
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,620
they're,
uh,

219
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:35,470
uh,
they highly value sexual behavior and so

220
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:35,860
forth.

221
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,693
And so those,
you can't really think of those things 

222
00:12:37,661 --> 00:12:41,680
as a specifically human.
They're a lower level than that now.

223
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,323
So at a fundamental level,
you have biological systems that are 

224
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:50,590
setting forth what might constitute a 
goal.

225
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,633
And you can think about that.
You can think that what the system is 

226
00:12:53,921 --> 00:12:54,754
doing is setting the goal or you can 
think that the system is driving 

227
00:12:57,191 --> 00:12:59,980
behavior.
But a better way of thinking about it is

228
00:12:59,981 --> 00:13:00,814
that the fundamental motivation 
motivational system sets up a framework 

229
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:08,980
that's like a personality that then acts
in the world.

230
00:13:08,981 --> 00:13:12,640
And so this personality has something in
mind that it wants.

231
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,863
It has a collection of perceptions that 
organize itself around that thing that 

232
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:17,584
it wants,
and then it has a plan or associated 

233
00:13:19,991 --> 00:13:20,824
motor behaviors that it can lay out in 
the world that will take it from the 

234
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:26,800
point where it is to the point that it 
wants to be okay now.

235
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:27,663
So once you know that,
then you can start to think about these 

236
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:34,210
plans or these goals or these stories or
these frameworks.

237
00:13:34,211 --> 00:13:36,790
I think those are all.
You can even think about them as games.

238
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:37,624
In some ways.
You can think about them at different 

239
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:43,390
levels of complexity.
Now what piaget was trying to do in part

240
00:13:43,391 --> 00:13:48,391
was to describe how a framework of this 
sort or a sub,

241
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:53,560
a sub element of personality might 
develop itself and complexity over time.

242
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,993
So,
so the diagram I have here before he 

243
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,990
shows these little oval like figures and
in the bottom left hand corner there's a

244
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,660
box that says what is in the top right 
hand corner.

245
00:14:07,661 --> 00:14:08,494
There's a box that says what should be,
and then there's some arrows showing a 

246
00:14:10,991 --> 00:14:14,680
planned sequence of behavior.
And the idea is that you have a sense of

247
00:14:14,681 --> 00:14:15,514
where you are and you have a sense of 
where you're going and that constitutes 

248
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:20,230
the framework within which you're 
looking at the world.

249
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,243
And then within that framework there's 
different things that you can do with 

250
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:26,650
your body in order to advance from the 
first point,

251
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,553
the second point.
Now it's important to understand that 

252
00:14:31,511 --> 00:14:32,344
this sort of thing is grounded in 
behavior and not in conception because 

253
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:36,363
it helps you also understand the nature 
of these fundamental elements of 

254
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:41,104
personality.
The fundamental elements of personality 

255
00:14:42,941 --> 00:14:47,380
or not descriptions of the world are 
tools for acting in the world,

256
00:14:47,381 --> 00:14:49,570
including the associated behaviors.
Now,

257
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:50,523
whether they're behavioral or to some 
degree depends on their level of 

258
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:55,780
abstraction.
So,

259
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,920
so here's how you.
How to think about that.

260
00:14:57,921 --> 00:15:01,430
So imagine that you say that someone's a
good person and you might say,

261
00:15:01,431 --> 00:15:05,510
well that's a description of the and 
that.

262
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,403
And when you think about description,
you tend to think about description in 

263
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:10,790
the way that you would describe an 
object in the world,

264
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,020
like a scientific description.

265
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,000
But when you talk about someone as a 
good person,

266
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,330
you're actually not describing them as 
an object in the world,

267
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,020
wouldn't even describe yourself as an 
object in the world,

268
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:21,854
that way what you're doing is using a 
shorthand to represent a higher the 

269
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:31,190
hierarchical arrangement of their 
personality and you can get away with it

270
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:33,770
because when you say good person to 
someone,

271
00:15:33,771 --> 00:15:34,604
they already have an understanding of 
good person and they know what that 

272
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:37,514
hierarchy is and so you don't have to 
explain the whole thing to them and you 

273
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:41,294
can understand each other without even 
necessarily knowing exactly the details 

274
00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:45,314
of what you're talking about.
But I'm going to tell you now what I 

275
00:15:47,901 --> 00:15:49,880
think you mean when you say that sort of
thing.

276
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:54,520
So imagine that good person is a 
description at the very,

277
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,930
at the top end of a hierarchy.
Okay?

278
00:15:56,931 --> 00:15:57,764
because good,
the good is a very high level 

279
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,970
philosophical abstraction.

280
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,130
It's a high level value.
Be good.

281
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,170
Okay.
So what does that mean?

282
00:16:06,171 --> 00:16:08,060
If you decompose it?
Well,

283
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,970
we'll do it in a relatively 
straightforward manner.

284
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:11,804
One that isn't really.
It's more observational than 

285
00:16:14,661 --> 00:16:16,430
philosophical.
So let's say you take,

286
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,713
you take someone who's a 40 year old 
mother for the sake of argument and who 

287
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,313
will say she also has a job.
So if she's a good person and she's a 

288
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:29,534
mother,
you might think that's one sub element 

289
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:31,904
of her personality.
If she's a good person is being a good 

290
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:35,090
parent.
Right?

291
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:35,924
And I think you've put person above 
parent in the hierarchy because to be a 

292
00:16:38,871 --> 00:16:42,260
good person you can be a good parent 
without being a good person,

293
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:45,230
but it's hard to see how you could be a 
good person without being a good parent.

294
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,210
So,
and maybe if you're a good person,

295
00:16:47,211 --> 00:16:48,044
you're more than a good parent,
you know you're probably a good partner 

296
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:52,640
and maybe you're good at your job and 
like there are,

297
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,533
there are large domains of activity that
you're good at or good in and with some 

298
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,223
your behavior across that are average 
year behavior across that or something 

299
00:17:02,631 --> 00:17:02,990
like that.

300
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,690
Then you ended up reasonably being 
described as a good person.

301
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,524
Maybe you're a good friend as well and 
so good person has levels of hierarchy 

302
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,113
underneath it and were.
And then each of those things that have 

303
00:17:14,511 --> 00:17:15,344
levels of hierarchy,
each of those entities at the level of 

304
00:17:18,711 --> 00:17:19,910
hierarchy,
right underneath,

305
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:20,744
good person can also be decomposed.
So we're going to decompose them and 

306
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:24,434
we're gonna see what happens.
Because partly what happens is if you 

307
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:28,700
decompose them,
you get right to the bottom.

308
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:33,050
It's not an infinite decomposition.
And so I also think this is one way that

309
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:36,520
you can think about the relationship 
between the mind and the body because of

310
00:17:36,521 --> 00:17:37,354
the relationship between the mind and 
the body is a very tricky thing because 

311
00:17:39,771 --> 00:17:42,920
the mind seems to be made of stuff 
that's other than the body.

312
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,083
And I think there's some truth to that 
partly because we don't really 

313
00:17:45,891 --> 00:17:48,290
understand consciousness,
but there are.

314
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,603
But that's a complex problem and I think
you can get a fair ways in addressing 

315
00:17:53,431 --> 00:17:57,270
the mind body problem without having to 
drag into the problem of consciousness.

316
00:17:57,271 --> 00:17:58,800
So okay,
so we could say,

317
00:17:58,801 --> 00:18:02,550
well good person sub element of that is 
good parent.

318
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,633
Then you might think,
well what is it that you need to be 

319
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:08,160
doing to be a good parent?
And we might say,

320
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:11,250
well,
you have to have a good job,

321
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,650
maybe that's one up in the hierarchy,
but whatever,

322
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,663
you have to have a good job because 
otherwise you can't provide for your 

323
00:18:16,351 --> 00:18:20,070
children and you have to be able to care
for the children.

324
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:20,551
You might say,
well,

325
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:23,760
someoNe's good at caring for children 
and then you might ask them,

326
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:24,594
well,
what does it mean to be good at caring 

327
00:18:25,921 --> 00:18:26,754
for children?
And then you have to sort of think of 

328
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,800
the sub elements that would go into 
caring for children.

329
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,633
And so one of them here is you have to 
know how to cook a meal or complete a 

330
00:18:36,571 --> 00:18:37,404
meal and then you also have to know how 
to play with the baby so we could 

331
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:41,004
concentrate on playing with the baby.
And so what you do when you're playing 

332
00:18:43,711 --> 00:18:45,660
with a baby,
you might play peekaboo.

333
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,360
You might tickle the baby and you might 
clean the baby.

334
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,980
Okay?
Now you start thinking,

335
00:18:49,981 --> 00:18:54,120
well obviously once you're starting to 
get down to that level of detail.

336
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,280
So that's a high resolution model,
right?

337
00:18:56,281 --> 00:18:57,114
You're,
you're starting to move from a low 

338
00:18:58,021 --> 00:19:01,290
resolution model,
good person to a high resolution model,

339
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:05,370
which are what are precisely the 
multitude of elements that make up being

340
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:06,570
a good person.
Well,

341
00:19:06,571 --> 00:19:09,420
if you're playing peekaboo with a baby,
for example,

342
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,660
all of a sudden you're doing something 
that's not exactly conceptual.

343
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:13,823
Being a good person is conceptual,
but playing peekaboo isn't conceptual 

344
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:17,814
and the reason it's not conceptual,
it's because he actually have to move 

345
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:20,610
your hands to do it.

346
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,013
So if you get to a high enough level of 
resolution in the description of a 

347
00:19:25,591 --> 00:19:26,424
personality,
what you start describing our patterns 

348
00:19:28,441 --> 00:19:30,720
of behavior,
now they have associated,

349
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,003
you know they have an associated 
motivational framework and a viewpoint 

350
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:37,530
that goes along with them so that I 
would say,

351
00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:38,364
well,
even while you're playing peekaboo with 

352
00:19:39,151 --> 00:19:40,900
the baby,
that the,

353
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,053
the element of you that's playing 
peekaboo is best described as a 

354
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,733
subpersonality.
It's a playful subpersonality and then 

355
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:49,644
it's the subpersonality that 
specifically knows how and is motivated 

356
00:19:53,011 --> 00:19:53,844
to play peekaboo.
But what it's composed of is no longer 

357
00:19:56,881 --> 00:20:00,780
as subpersonality it starting to be 
composed of actual movements.

358
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,330
So,
and then underneath that,

359
00:20:03,331 --> 00:20:05,190
if you go to higher resolution,
like,

360
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:07,140
okay,
what's the movement composed of?

361
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:07,974
Well obviously you start to have to talk
about musculature and then if you go 

362
00:20:10,471 --> 00:20:12,540
below that,
it's molecular movements and so on,

363
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:13,374
but,
but once you're down below a voluntary 

364
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:17,640
movement,
there's really no you there anymore,

365
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,270
right?

366
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,810
You sort of fade into unconsciousness 
because you know how to go like this,

367
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,003
but you don't exactly know how to move 
the specific muscles that enable you to 

368
00:20:26,341 --> 00:20:28,110
go like that.
Or even if you do,

369
00:20:28,111 --> 00:20:31,200
you don't know how to twitch the muscle 
fibers or something like that.

370
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,210
Right?
There's some law.

371
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,173
You don't know how to operate the cells.
There's some level of resolution 

372
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,673
underneath voluntary motor control that 
that basically runs on automatic and to 

373
00:20:41,581 --> 00:20:44,850
some degree you're capable of like 
steering it,

374
00:20:44,851 --> 00:20:45,684
but you're not really capable of.
You're certainly not capable of being 

375
00:20:48,341 --> 00:20:50,670
conscious of it.
So the,

376
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:54,400
the abstract moral conception,
which is also a description,

377
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,263
good person hits the world at the level 
of motor output now and a lot like even 

378
00:20:59,981 --> 00:21:01,460
your sensory movement.
A lot of outs,

379
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,440
motor outPut,
right?

380
00:21:02,441 --> 00:21:04,720
Because a lot of what you're doing with 
your eyes is moving them,

381
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:05,973
so all right,
now what does that have to do with 

382
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:08,974
piaget?

383
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,023
Well,
one of the ways of understanding piaget 

384
00:21:11,711 --> 00:21:12,544
is that he built.
He was really interested in 

385
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:19,741
understanding how that entire system 
came to be and his theory is a bottom up

386
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:22,510
theory.
He says,

387
00:21:22,511 --> 00:21:23,290
okay,
yeah,

388
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,730
this is this.
This is.

389
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,313
He hasn't said this,
but it's a very useful way of thinking 

390
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,374
about it because piaget believed that 
you started with small elements of what 

391
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:34,204
he called reflexive behavior and then 
you learn to chain them together and 

392
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:39,214
increasingly complex structures and then
you chain those complex structures into 

393
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:44,344
more and more complex structures and so 
on and so forth until you built up the 

394
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:50,140
entire hierarchy.
But you tended to start from the bottom.

395
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,363
So piaget was particularly interested in
what the minimum conditions were for 

396
00:21:57,911 --> 00:21:58,744
something to emerge into the world so 
that he could build itself out of 

397
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:05,170
nothing.
And that's really what he was interested

398
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:07,390
in when he was starting to talk about 
infant development.

399
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,450
And so piaget's hypothesis with 
something like this,

400
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:16,150
well kill babies are born very,
very immature.

401
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,700
You might even say that they're born 
premature,

402
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,900
so I'm a human baby.
If you took a mammal,

403
00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:27,901
have read about human size and you said,
well what's its average gestation period

404
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:31,630
across the animal kingdom?
You'd find out that for an animal of our

405
00:22:31,631 --> 00:22:35,140
size we should have a gestation period 
of pregnancy period of two years.

406
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,143
So we don't.
We hAve a gestation period of nine 

407
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:41,110
months.
And so you might ask,

408
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:45,100
well why is that?
And the answer is complicated.

409
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:50,130
Obviously you've got to hear some of the
reasons as far as people can tell 'em we

410
00:22:50,141 --> 00:22:55,141
have big heads and they've really been 
expanding rapidly over particularly over

411
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:56,374
the last 2 million years.
But let's say since we split off from 

412
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:01,750
chimps,
that's about 6 million years.

413
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,240
We have very,
very large heads and you know,

414
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:05,074
if you look at a baby,
a baby's head is pretty damn 

415
00:23:06,881 --> 00:23:09,190
disproportionately large compared to its
body.

416
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,023
Like a baby's like a third hat.
And so even when the baby's little nine 

417
00:23:14,681 --> 00:23:15,760
months old,
well,

418
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,623
nine months after conception and maybe a
year and three months before it's 

419
00:23:20,381 --> 00:23:23,140
supposed to be born,
it's head is already extremely big.

420
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,390
Now you think,
well what's the problem with that?

421
00:23:25,391 --> 00:23:27,610
And the problem with that is while the 
bigger your head is,

422
00:23:27,611 --> 00:23:30,070
the harder it is to be born.
And you might say,

423
00:23:30,071 --> 00:23:30,904
well why haven't the pelvic areas of 
human beings adjusted females in 

424
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:36,274
particular adjusted so that they could 
handle the birth with a larger head and 

425
00:23:40,631 --> 00:23:42,850
the answer to that as well,
they have to some degree,

426
00:23:42,851 --> 00:23:45,590
which is why women have wider hips that 
men do.

427
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:50,620
But the problem is is evolution is a 
conservative business and it can only in

428
00:23:51,351 --> 00:23:53,780
some sense tinker with what it's already
got.

429
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:58,781
And so if you look at the basic bought 
your basic body plan,

430
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,253
your basic body plan in it,
most in its most fundamental levels was 

431
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:07,580
established some tens of millions or 
even hundreds of millions of years ago.

432
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:08,683
And then the basic mammalian body plan 
was established say 60 million years 

433
00:24:12,261 --> 00:24:14,240
ago.
And so if you go,

434
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:15,074
I went to the smithsonian wants and they
have a skeleton museum at the 

435
00:24:17,481 --> 00:24:19,640
smithsonian.
It's sort of like a zoo for,

436
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,623
for skeletons and it's really 
interesting place to go because you can 

437
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:28,360
see much more help and like mammals are 
when you see their skeleton.

438
00:24:28,361 --> 00:24:30,530
So for example,
if you see a bat skeleton,

439
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,650
it looks just like a human skeleton,
except the fingers are really,

440
00:24:33,651 --> 00:24:36,080
really long.
But it's the rest of it's like,

441
00:24:36,081 --> 00:24:36,914
yeah,
that's basically the same skeleton as a 

442
00:24:38,421 --> 00:24:39,254
human being.
IT's just that the pieces have blown up 

443
00:24:41,031 --> 00:24:42,920
in size or shrunk or,
or,

444
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:43,903
or contorted or something like that.
But it's exactly the same damn 

445
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,350
structure.
So as,

446
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,850
as the brain was growing in the skull 
was getting larger and women,

447
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:53,803
women's bodies had to adapt to that 
while there was parameters within which 

448
00:24:57,141 --> 00:24:58,190
the body had to work.

449
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,023
And it turns out that if you make the 
hips any wider and you make the hole in 

450
00:25:01,371 --> 00:25:04,580
the middle of the many bigger than the 
hips start to lose structural integrity.

451
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,760
And the other thing that starts to 
happen is the woman can't run.

452
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,163
So there's this weird,
you imagine that evolution takes place 

453
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:11,864
within this set of constraints and so 
what's happening is the baby gets born 

454
00:25:15,111 --> 00:25:15,944
way earlier.
The women's hips are wider with the 

455
00:25:17,781 --> 00:25:21,080
larger pelvic whole but not so wide.
They can't run and not so wide.

456
00:25:21,081 --> 00:25:25,670
They're not strong and the baby's head 
is collapsible roughly because the bones

457
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:29,390
aren't completely fused at birth and so 
generally,

458
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,460
especially if it's a larger baby,
if it's born,

459
00:25:31,461 --> 00:25:34,700
when it,
when it emerges just after birth,

460
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:38,360
it's head is quite compressed.
Cone Shaped even so.

461
00:25:38,361 --> 00:25:39,194
And that's hard on the baby,
but it's not nearly as hard on the baby 

462
00:25:41,061 --> 00:25:43,010
or the mother as not being born at all.

463
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:47,170
So anyways,
babies are born pretty premature and you

464
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:48,004
know,
that puts a tremendous burden on human 

465
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:54,770
parents because of course the child is,
I can't even walk for the first year.

466
00:25:54,771 --> 00:25:59,060
Whereas you take a deer when a deer is 
born or an animal like that,

467
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,980
you know,
it's three minutes later,

468
00:26:00,981 --> 00:26:01,814
it's wobbling around on its feet and 
then it's running away from lions the 

469
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:05,300
next morning.
It's like,

470
00:26:05,301 --> 00:26:06,620
that's,
that's not us.

471
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:07,490
You think,
why not?

472
00:26:07,491 --> 00:26:09,680
It's well were born very premature and 
very,

473
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:13,280
very vulnerable and you know,
it's a major load on the,

474
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,110
on the parents.
Anyways.

475
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,500
One question piaget was interested in 
is,

476
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:21,170
well,
what exactly is a baby born with?

477
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:22,940
And he thought,
well,

478
00:26:22,941 --> 00:26:26,150
they're born with a couple of things.
One is here's three things.

479
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:26,984
In a sense you might think they're born 
with a couple of reflexes and what you 

480
00:26:30,351 --> 00:26:31,184
might think of a as a reflex is that 
it's a built in module of sensory motor 

481
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,570
capability and maybe it and it,
you know,

482
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,230
maybe there's a motivational element to 
it as well.

483
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:46,170
So I would say it's a built in 
subpersonality and it's a very narrow.

484
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:49,240
Subpersonality has a very narrow cast.
And so one thing,

485
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,500
one thing babies can do is route.
So if you touch them on the site,

486
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:54,360
if they're cheap,
then they route.

487
00:26:54,361 --> 00:26:55,194
And basically what that means is that 
they use their mouth and their head to 

488
00:26:57,871 --> 00:27:00,930
search for something to latch onto with 
their mouth.

489
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:05,850
And that would generally be a nipple.
So they come pre wired to be able to use

490
00:27:05,851 --> 00:27:06,684
their mouth and their tongue and certain
muscles have their head in order to 

491
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,320
figure out how to feed and that's 
actually a very complicated behavior.

492
00:27:13,321 --> 00:27:14,154
And so one of the things you see with 
babies is that their mouth and their 

493
00:27:16,951 --> 00:27:21,951
tongue is quite wired up already.
So if you're looking at a newborn baby,

494
00:27:22,021 --> 00:27:26,700
the intelligent part of the baby in some
sense like the part that's already there

495
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,090
is very much oriented towards health and
its tongue.

496
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,360
And that's sorta like freud's idea of an
oral stage in some sense.

497
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:33,901
Although,
you know,

498
00:27:33,901 --> 00:27:36,480
you could debate that,
but that's partly why freud thought that

499
00:27:36,481 --> 00:27:37,314
way.
He knew that babies were very mouth 

500
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,940
oriented.
It once they can start using their hands

501
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,630
and they can pick up objects.
What do they do with objects?

502
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,270
I put them in their mouth.
Right?

503
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,890
Why?
Well,

504
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,430
because that's what babies do partly,
but that's not the only reason.

505
00:27:53,431 --> 00:27:56,250
It's like if you look at the.
Okay,

506
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,400
so back in the fifties,
forties,

507
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:03,800
maybe even earlier than that,
there is a neurosurgeon named what?

508
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:04,763
Wilder penfield who worked at the 
montreal neurological institute and he 

509
00:28:07,141 --> 00:28:09,350
was one of the people who first did,
um,

510
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,850
surgery for example,
for epilepsy.

511
00:28:11,851 --> 00:28:12,684
So if you hAve epilepsy,
what happens is generally you kind of 

512
00:28:14,881 --> 00:28:15,714
have a short circuit,
there's a malfunctioning set of neurons 

513
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:19,403
usually in the hippocampus and they've 
produced like a positive feedback 

514
00:28:22,531 --> 00:28:23,364
electrical circuit and it's like a 
little electrical storm and it'll start 

515
00:28:26,401 --> 00:28:29,100
in damaged tissue and that's spread 
across the whole brain.

516
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,503
And one of the things the early 
neurosurgeons were doing was dividing 

517
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:33,624
the brain into to stop the hemisphere 
that had the damage from being able to 

518
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,680
spread pathological electric electricity
across the entire brain.

519
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:44,970
Now when you're doing brain surgery,
you don't want to take out anything that

520
00:28:44,971 --> 00:28:45,804
isn't absolutely necessary.
And so one of the things the brain 

521
00:28:48,151 --> 00:28:51,720
surgeons do and still do and still do is
that they do brain surgery.

522
00:28:51,721 --> 00:28:52,554
When you're conscious,
which is quite a horrifying thought 

523
00:28:55,981 --> 00:28:56,814
really,
because you know your head is stuck in 

524
00:28:58,321 --> 00:28:59,970
this little machine that doesn't let it 
move.

525
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:00,804
and then they're poking around in your 
brain and you have to tell them what's 

526
00:29:02,761 --> 00:29:06,330
going on while you're doing it.
And if you start being able to respond,

527
00:29:06,331 --> 00:29:09,280
then I presume they assume that they've 
made a mistake and you know,

528
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:10,463
tough luck for you at any ways.
Penfield was interested not only in you 

529
00:29:15,531 --> 00:29:17,550
know,
conducting his surgery properly,

530
00:29:17,551 --> 00:29:19,680
but also in mapping out the brain to 
figure out,

531
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:22,450
well,
what parts of it could use and you know,

532
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,320
do you have to keep and what parts can 
you maybe get rid of?

533
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,153
And part of that was because there was 
an idea for a long time among 

534
00:29:28,681 --> 00:29:29,514
neurologists called equal potentiality,
which meant that the cortex was an 

535
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:34,854
undifferentiated mass of tissue and you 
can take out parts of it without really 

536
00:29:38,281 --> 00:29:39,114
much loss of function at all.
Which that turned out not to be exactly 

537
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:44,314
right.
Although it wasn't as stupid as an idea 

538
00:29:46,091 --> 00:29:46,924
as it might seem,
because the cortex is less 

539
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:50,830
differentiated than other parts of the 
brain.

540
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:53,200
But it turns out that if you take out 
parts of it,

541
00:29:53,201 --> 00:29:54,034
like the prefrontal cortex,
the damage that it does is not 

542
00:29:56,561 --> 00:29:57,394
immediately evident.
But if you watch the person for any 

543
00:29:58,991 --> 00:30:02,530
length of time will usually their lives 
fall apart if their prefrontal cortex is

544
00:30:02,531 --> 00:30:04,430
being damaged enough.
Anyway.

545
00:30:04,431 --> 00:30:05,264
So penfield was trying to figure out 
what the brain does and so he was using 

546
00:30:08,111 --> 00:30:12,760
electrodes to touch the surface and what
he found,

547
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,960
if you imagine that this is the frontal 
part of your brain here,

548
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:18,850
and it's called that because it's at the
front,

549
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,240
right?

550
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:24,240
And so there's a back part of it has to 
do more with sensory processing and then

551
00:30:25,271 --> 00:30:26,104
there's a fissure down the middle.
And on The front side of the fisher 

552
00:30:28,991 --> 00:30:32,150
there's an area that's roughly triangle 
shaped on the back of the fisher,

553
00:30:32,151 --> 00:30:35,530
there's another area that's roughly 
triangle shaped and the front part,

554
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,693
if you touch it with a,
with an electrode like up the right 

555
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,230
current,
obviously,

556
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,333
then people will report feeling 
something on different parts of their 

557
00:30:44,711 --> 00:30:45,544
body.
And then if you touch the part that's 

558
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,150
behind the fisher,
so roughly about here,

559
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:49,984
so then they'll,
they'll be inclined to move or feel the 

560
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:55,570
impulse to move.
And so what,

561
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,463
what then feel did was draw a little map
of what parts of the brain were 

562
00:31:01,571 --> 00:31:02,404
connected to,
what sensory sensations in the body and 

563
00:31:04,271 --> 00:31:05,104
what parts of the brain were contained 
connected to what motor sensations and 

564
00:31:08,171 --> 00:31:08,560
he.

565
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,510
He built this thing called a homerun 
keyless.

566
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,540
It's a little,
it's a little picture and the picture is

567
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,540
of this creature that's laid out on the 
cortex.

568
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,390
It's sort of like a dismembered body in 
some sense,

569
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:20,643
and the size of each part corresponds to
the amount of tissue that's devoted to 

570
00:31:24,101 --> 00:31:26,650
processing that brain or that bodily 
area.

571
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,400
And what you see is very,
very interesting because if you look,

572
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,970
there's a sensory homonculus.
ThAt's how your body looks to your brain

573
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,990
from a century perspective.
And there's a motor home oculus,

574
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,420
which is how your body looks to your 
brain from the perspective of being able

575
00:31:40,421 --> 00:31:42,340
to operate it.
What you see for example,

576
00:31:42,341 --> 00:31:45,040
is with both the sensory and the motor 
cortex.

577
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,083
The hand is as big as the whole body and
the thumb is as big as the rest of the 

578
00:31:50,081 --> 00:31:50,914
hand.
And then the mouth and the tongue are 

579
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:55,510
also that big and so is the face.

580
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:58,590
So you've got this little itty bitty 
body because what are you,

581
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:01,000
what are you going to do with your back?
You know,

582
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,033
you,
you can't pick up anything with your 

583
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:04,054
back and you're also not very good.
Really your sensory perception on your 

584
00:32:07,571 --> 00:32:08,404
back is not very high resolution.
So if I had one of you stand up and I 

585
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,440
put three fingers on your back this far 
apart and I said,

586
00:32:14,441 --> 00:32:17,800
how many fingers were there?
You wouldn't be able to tell.

587
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,913
You'd say one probably,
but you can't tell even if you space 

588
00:32:21,911 --> 00:32:24,760
them out quite a bit if you pushed 
simultaneously.

589
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:25,594
Whereas on the surface of the hand you 
can tell immediately because this is a 

590
00:32:28,961 --> 00:32:29,794
high resolution part of your body.
And of course you know you can really 

591
00:32:33,761 --> 00:32:34,594
move your little tentatively,
technically appendages here and they're 

592
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:39,680
highly wired up to the brain as well and
very,

593
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:40,514
very sensitive.

594
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,850
But the reason I told you all that,
because it's also particularly true with

595
00:32:43,851 --> 00:32:46,520
the mouth and the and the lips and the 
tongue.

596
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,473
And then also the entire face,
because your face is extraordinarily 

597
00:32:50,661 --> 00:32:54,560
mobile and you broadcast emotion with 
that and so it's a,

598
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:58,520
it's a communication device of the 
highest order and so it has to be really

599
00:32:58,521 --> 00:33:01,520
wired up.
You have so much neuro control over your

600
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:02,354
face that you can actually teach 
yourself to fire single neurons in the 

601
00:33:05,481 --> 00:33:06,314
tissue underneath your eye.
So which you certainly not going to be 

602
00:33:08,691 --> 00:33:10,430
able to do with your back.
And then of course,

603
00:33:10,431 --> 00:33:13,490
well why would you anyways,
so now,

604
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:14,743
so what I tell you that in part so that 
you get some more understanding of how 

605
00:33:18,201 --> 00:33:20,930
the child is wired up because that 
mouth,

606
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:24,680
tongue lip sort of arrangement that,
that,

607
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:25,603
that the baby is born with is very,
very powerful learning circuit and it's 

608
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:32,450
established quite nicely right at birth.

609
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,733
And so then the baby can start exploring
the world using parts of it that are 

610
00:33:37,971 --> 00:33:41,120
already there.
And a big chunk of that is the mouth.

611
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,410
So,
and you know,

612
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,393
you know how this works.
Some of you have recently had dental 

613
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:47,924
surgery of one form or another,
or at least you can remember when you 

614
00:33:49,971 --> 00:33:50,804
had it.
Maybe you had a tooth pulled or a 

615
00:33:51,621 --> 00:33:55,670
filling or you had racist put in or 
something.

616
00:33:56,090 --> 00:34:01,090
So one of the things you'll notice if 
you lose a tooth isn't your damn tommy's

617
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,580
in there where the tooth was for the 
next six months.

618
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,503
Right?
Fiddling around and you can do it 

619
00:34:07,971 --> 00:34:09,620
consciously,
which you will sometimes,

620
00:34:09,621 --> 00:34:10,454
but even if you're not attending to it,
your tongue will be in there checking 

621
00:34:12,951 --> 00:34:16,460
out every tiny little crack and crevice 
in the new area.

622
00:34:16,461 --> 00:34:17,294
And what it's doing is updating your map
of the map of your body because your 

623
00:34:20,121 --> 00:34:24,200
mouth wants to know what part of it's 
you and what part of it isn't.

624
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,033
Because first of all,
you're not supposed to chew the parts 

625
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,910
that are you.
And second of all,

626
00:34:28,911 --> 00:34:30,710
if there's any foreign body in the 
mouth,

627
00:34:30,711 --> 00:34:31,544
obviously you want to get that out of 
there for endless numbers of reasons so 

628
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,363
you can detect surface variation with 
your lips and tongue with tremendous 

629
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:42,290
accuracy.
And of course,

630
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:46,400
you know there's all sorts of uses that 
people put that ability to.

631
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:47,234
It's also one of the ways that people a 
test each other out for sexual 

632
00:34:50,931 --> 00:34:52,040
compatibility,
right?

633
00:34:52,041 --> 00:34:53,970
Because that's all mouth and tongue work
rough.

634
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:54,853
Not all of it obviously,
but at least some reasonable proportion 

635
00:34:58,491 --> 00:35:01,130
of it.
And so that's also a part of exploratory

636
00:35:01,131 --> 00:35:03,920
behavior.
So you're testing for things like health

637
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:04,710
with,
with,

638
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:08,000
with kissing smell.
So anyways,

639
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:09,680
it's a major part of you,
you know,

640
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,573
and not only is it the part that you,
that you explore the world with so that 

641
00:35:14,091 --> 00:35:16,400
you can figure out what to eat and what 
not to eat,

642
00:35:16,401 --> 00:35:19,700
which is a big problem for omnivores,
right?

643
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:23,660
Because we can eat damn near anything 
that's a complex cognitive problem,

644
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:28,370
but you also can use it as a tool for 
exploring the contours of the world.

645
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,250
Now animals really do that with smell,
right?

646
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:33,920
Because your typical animal is a smell 
based creature.

647
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:37,650
Whereas human beings aren't really so 
much that probably because we became and

648
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:41,400
for a bunch of other reasons,
but smell is a tremendously powerful

649
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,560
modality and it's pretty much fully 
there.

650
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,880
At birth as well,
and you know,

651
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:52,290
mothers report that they can distinguish
their baby by smell of virtually,

652
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,030
you know,
a day or two after they're born and they

653
00:35:54,031 --> 00:35:54,864
know what the smell and babies can 
certainly smell their mothers and their 

654
00:35:58,111 --> 00:36:00,570
fathers as well.
It doesn't take very long at all.

655
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,063
So anyways,
the baby's got its mouth and so it can 

656
00:36:04,411 --> 00:36:08,190
start getting somewhere with that.
And then it's also got basic reflexes,

657
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:09,024
you know,
and now what a baby does in some sense 

658
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:15,900
is if it starts developing from the 
middle and the top downward and outward.

659
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,000
So the mouth and the nose are all wired 
up.

660
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,863
I start to get wired up fairly quickly.
They're not much to begin with because 

661
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:25,224
the baby will move its eyes 
independently and it's not very good at 

662
00:36:28,051 --> 00:36:32,160
focusing,
although it's focal length is actually,

663
00:36:32,161 --> 00:36:32,994
it's natural focal length is pretty much
exactly the distance from breast to 

664
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,130
mothers are,
which makes perfect sense,

665
00:36:38,131 --> 00:36:38,964
right?
Because the baby wants to be able to 

666
00:36:39,841 --> 00:36:43,620
communicate extraordinarily well to 
produce a bond with the mother.

667
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,970
And that happens most frequently with 
during breastfeeding,

668
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,833
which is also extremely good for the 
baby because the baby gets touched and 

669
00:36:51,451 --> 00:36:52,830
babies really,
really,

670
00:36:52,831 --> 00:36:54,870
really,
really need to be touched.

671
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,030
If you don't touch them,
they die.

672
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,343
So even if you feed them,
shelter them in all those sorts of 

673
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:01,680
things,
they have to be touched and it's,

674
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,630
it's very good for the baby's 
development.

675
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:07,690
So anyways,
the baby starts out with it's,

676
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:08,823
it's uh,
its ability to explore with its mouth 

677
00:37:11,311 --> 00:37:12,144
and its tongue in its and its ability to
smell and that it starts to develop its 

678
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:15,984
eyes,
but it does that in concert with 

679
00:37:17,521 --> 00:37:20,030
developing other parts of its body.
No one.

680
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,550
So the baby,
if you put the baby on its stomach,

681
00:37:23,551 --> 00:37:26,250
then it starts to exercise its ability 
to lift up.

682
00:37:26,251 --> 00:37:26,511
It's,
hey,

683
00:37:26,511 --> 00:37:27,344
I didn't.
So it kind of gets that going and it 

684
00:37:28,861 --> 00:37:31,260
starts to learn how to use its arms and 
its legs.

685
00:37:31,261 --> 00:37:34,440
And um,
so one thing you can do for a baby

686
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,410
for example,
to help and get going.

687
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:45,020
So let's say the baby's in its crib,
it's laying face upward.

688
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,390
Okay?
You can give it a mobile.

689
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,730
How if you go into a baby store and you 
look at mobile,

690
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:54,710
what you'll see as maybe the top part is
like to coat hangers,

691
00:37:54,711 --> 00:37:55,544
right?
It's like a cross and then there's 

692
00:37:56,721 --> 00:37:59,930
things hanging from it and the things 
will be,

693
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:01,160
I don't know,
maybe they're cute.

694
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:05,030
Who knows hello kitty things or some 
damn thing like that,

695
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,150
you know,
and they're facing you.

696
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,123
Well that's a stupid mobile because you 
aren't the person who's supposed to be 

697
00:38:13,581 --> 00:38:16,670
looking at the hello kitty thinks the 
baby's supposed to be looking at it.

698
00:38:16,671 --> 00:38:19,250
So those should be facing down and they 
never are.

699
00:38:19,251 --> 00:38:22,250
They're always facing sideways.
So when the baby looks at all it sees is

700
00:38:22,251 --> 00:38:23,084
a bunch of horizontal lines.
So let's assume that you're reasonably 

701
00:38:26,661 --> 00:38:27,494
bright and you get one that the baby can
see and then maybe it should be black 

702
00:38:30,861 --> 00:38:31,694
and white or at least really,
really bright primary colors because 

703
00:38:34,161 --> 00:38:36,500
it's easier for baby could detect that 
black and white.

704
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,333
It's really good because baby is pretty 
good at detecting edges and so that 

705
00:38:39,761 --> 00:38:42,640
thing will move around the baby lay 
there and watch it,

706
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,920
you know?
And and babies,

707
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:45,754
they,
I think they kind of look like they're 

708
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:47,524
stoned on lsd
and I actually think that's technically 

709
00:38:51,611 --> 00:38:52,444
correct because one of the things that 
hallucinogens do is reduced the 

710
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,290
inhibiting power of memory on 
perception.

711
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:00,443
And of course babies have no inhibiting 
power of memory on perception because 

712
00:39:04,151 --> 00:39:04,984
they have no memory.
So there are pretty much completely 

713
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:08,764
overwhelmed by the world all the time.
so they laying there watching this 

714
00:39:11,711 --> 00:39:12,544
mobile and you know,
you can shake it and maybe they'll have 

715
00:39:15,191 --> 00:39:19,030
a little reflex at that or,
or you can interact with somebody in the

716
00:39:19,031 --> 00:39:22,360
baby will start checking that out and 
we'll watch it and watch watching to the

717
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:26,410
watch party so that it can get its eyes 
organized.

718
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:30,280
And it does that in concert to some 
degree with its motor ability,

719
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:31,450
you know,
because you might say,

720
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:36,400
imagine your cross side a little bit 
like the baby and you're looking at that

721
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:38,980
thing and there's two of them.
And you might think,

722
00:39:38,981 --> 00:39:40,810
well,
how do you know there's not two of them?

723
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,993
And the answer to that is what?
You have to whack it with your hand as 

724
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,174
soon as you walk with your hand,
you're going to find out if it's one 

725
00:39:47,801 --> 00:39:48,634
thing or two things.
Once you figure out whether that's one 

726
00:39:50,081 --> 00:39:51,370
arm or two arms,
you know,

727
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:56,700
and so the baby is starting to to whack 
itself against the world and watched the

728
00:39:56,771 --> 00:39:57,604
consequences to help it start to build 
up its ability to interact with the 

729
00:40:00,671 --> 00:40:02,350
world and its ability to model the 
world.

730
00:40:02,351 --> 00:40:04,870
And so one of the things you watch,
for example,

731
00:40:04,871 --> 00:40:08,020
if you put a baby in the crib and it's 
got a mobile there,

732
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:08,973
you want to kind of move to mobile down 
so that it's close enough so that the 

733
00:40:11,531 --> 00:40:13,660
baby might be able to bump it because 
babies,

734
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,250
if you,
if you don't swaddle them,

735
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:19,570
they lay there and their hands and legs 
sort of float in space like this.

736
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,030
And It's because they're not really very
well connected to them.

737
00:40:22,031 --> 00:40:24,070
And that's why a baby will poke itself 
and die now.

738
00:40:24,071 --> 00:40:24,904
And then with his thumb and it's rather 
amusing to watch and it kind of bleak 

739
00:40:27,581 --> 00:40:28,414
manner be.
So a baby will lay there and it'll poke 

740
00:40:30,331 --> 00:40:31,164
itself and will go like that.
And what it's just discovered is that 

741
00:40:33,941 --> 00:40:38,680
there's some relationship between that 
random movement and that sensation.

742
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,023
Okay,
now,

743
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:41,483
okay,
so let's say it's laying there and it's 

744
00:40:42,461 --> 00:40:43,294
floating around in space and it's 
fortunate enough so that it's leg comes 

745
00:40:48,131 --> 00:40:50,360
into contact with an element of the 
mobile.

746
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,220
Well that will make the mobile do 
something interesting and novel.

747
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,040
And when the bait,
when the mobile,

748
00:40:57,041 --> 00:40:57,874
that's something interesting and novel 
that triggers a reflex and the baby and 

749
00:41:00,311 --> 00:41:03,700
the and the reflex is that the baby will
orient towards it and look.

750
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:07,060
And so for piaget that was the circuit.

751
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,313
That was the beginning of the baby's 
ability to sort of start bootstrapping 

752
00:41:11,951 --> 00:41:12,784
it up in the world.
And he thought what you needed was the 

753
00:41:15,011 --> 00:41:15,844
ability to move a little bit at least.
So that'd be the reflex say or even 

754
00:41:19,691 --> 00:41:20,524
randomness.
And then you needed the ability to 

755
00:41:22,511 --> 00:41:23,344
refine that movement.
So you needed to be able to practice it 

756
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:32,020
and you need it to be able to improve 
with practice and you need it to be able

757
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:32,854
to imitate.
And warming of the things that piaget 

758
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:37,730
thought,
which I think is so smart,

759
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,593
it's so smart,
is that a lot of what babies did was 

760
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,330
imitate themselves.
So for example,

761
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,433
maybe they're,
they're laying in bed and they're 

762
00:41:46,851 --> 00:41:49,550
starting to get some sense of the 
connection between,

763
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:52,910
of how their arms and legs work and so 
they can maybe make,

764
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:55,280
start to make sort of broad gestures and
that's it,

765
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:58,880
but now and then they are lucky in their
sort of flinging your arms around them,

766
00:41:58,890 --> 00:41:59,723
they hit them all bile and they'd get a 
little reflex out of that if it's a 

767
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:03,734
startle and an indication of interest.
And then they'll sit there and practice 

768
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:09,710
how to whack that thing with their hand.
And so then what.

769
00:42:09,711 --> 00:42:10,544
So what they're doing is they kind of 
accidentally produced a phenomena of 

770
00:42:15,381 --> 00:42:16,214
interest and they noted the consequence 
and then what they do is try to 

771
00:42:19,581 --> 00:42:20,414
reduplicate the phenomena of interest.
So basically what they're doing is 

772
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:28,430
manifest in different patterns of quasi 
voluntarily read reflex plaza,

773
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:29,763
involuntary reflex of behavior.
And then if that produces something of 

774
00:42:34,371 --> 00:42:36,380
note,
they'll practice imitating it.

775
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:42,310
So when my daughter was about 18 months,
maybe not even at all,

776
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,540
13,
14 months,

777
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:53,680
maybe old enough to sit up anyways and 
old enough to start to do some things by

778
00:42:53,681 --> 00:42:56,050
herself.
We bought her these books.

779
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:00,010
They were disney books,
hardcover cardboard books,

780
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,050
you know,
five pages long or something.

781
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,290
Each of the pages was quite thick 
because it was made out of cardboard and

782
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,653
they,
four of them would come in a little box 

783
00:43:07,931 --> 00:43:11,290
which is about four inches high and 
about an inch and a half wide.

784
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:12,723
And if you really careful you could take
out the books and then you can put all 

785
00:43:16,541 --> 00:43:17,374
of them back in.
It wasn't that easy because the first 

786
00:43:20,651 --> 00:43:22,210
one wasn't too hard,
but they got,

787
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:23,543
you know,
consistently more difficult as you kept 

788
00:43:25,241 --> 00:43:28,960
putting each of the men because the 
parameters of the exercise changed.

789
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,350
And she must have spent,
I don't know,

790
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:37,540
150 hours dumping those out,
picking them up,

791
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:39,940
putting them in.
And you might say,

792
00:43:39,941 --> 00:43:41,170
well,
what was she doing?

793
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:42,851
And you know,
you'd say,

794
00:43:42,851 --> 00:43:45,070
well,
she was putting books in a box.

795
00:43:45,071 --> 00:43:47,200
That's not what she was doing.
First of all,

796
00:43:47,201 --> 00:43:50,830
they weren't books to her and it wasn't 
a box because she didn't know what a box

797
00:43:50,831 --> 00:43:51,664
was,
what she was doing was practicing going 

798
00:43:53,141 --> 00:43:53,974
like this,

799
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,320
you know,
and matching the size of something to,

800
00:43:57,321 --> 00:43:58,154
uh,
to the size of something else and not 

801
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:01,880
very complicated and maybe you know,

802
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:08,580
so there is a jar of apple juice.
OkaY.

803
00:44:08,581 --> 00:44:10,380
So you might say,
well pick that up.

804
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:12,480
Okay,
well you can pick it up like this.

805
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,910
You can pick it up like this,
you can pick it up like this,

806
00:44:14,911 --> 00:44:15,744
you can pick it up like this.
Like there's a lot of things to 

807
00:44:17,971 --> 00:44:18,804
practice.
And each of those movements is a 

808
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,324
different sensory motor capacity that 
has an incredibly wide range of 

809
00:44:26,941 --> 00:44:27,774
potential applications.
So a child will sit there and fiddle 

810
00:44:30,661 --> 00:44:31,494
about their hands in their arms and the 
rest of their body for untold hours 

811
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:35,964
because what they're doing is building 
up these basic sensory motor systems 

812
00:44:39,331 --> 00:44:41,760
from the bottom up so that they can,
you know,

813
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:42,643
so.
So they practice them in one domain 

814
00:44:43,861 --> 00:44:44,694
where there's some challenge and then 
they're starting to build new 

815
00:44:46,861 --> 00:44:51,180
exploratory tools that they can go out 
and practice on the rest of the world.

816
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,170
So you know,
once you can grip a,

817
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:58,320
I'd say once you can grip a mobile and 
you can let go,

818
00:44:58,321 --> 00:44:59,154
which is something babies actually have 
a hard time doing because they have a 

819
00:45:01,021 --> 00:45:03,810
grip reflex and they're quite strong 
when they're first born.

820
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:07,970
If you put your fingers in their hands,
you can lift them right off the ground,

821
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:08,813
the cling to you.
And that's probably old chimpanzee 

822
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,113
gripping behavior because chimps grabbed
to their mothers first and then they're 

823
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:17,310
like carried around like that for about 
three years now.

824
00:45:17,311 --> 00:45:20,340
Since you don't have much for.
It's kind of useless for the baby,

825
00:45:20,341 --> 00:45:21,174
although they're pretty good at getting 
your hair and your glasses and your 

826
00:45:23,341 --> 00:45:24,174
nose.
And so when you got to get them to let 

827
00:45:26,581 --> 00:45:28,050
go.
So anyways,

828
00:45:28,051 --> 00:45:30,510
they'll sit there and practice all these
little sub routines.

829
00:45:30,511 --> 00:45:32,850
And so you'll see this too.
If you have a baby,

830
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:34,763
you got your baby in the highchair,
maybe it's nine months old and you're 

831
00:45:36,931 --> 00:45:37,764
trying to feed the baby,
which is often very challenging because 

832
00:45:41,221 --> 00:45:42,054
babies are very curious and annoying and
troublesome and tough and ordinary and 

833
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:46,613
exploratory and,
and misbehaving and provocative and all 

834
00:45:49,741 --> 00:45:52,230
those things because they need that to 
learn about the world.

835
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,393
And they'll,
they'll do something like maybe they'll 

836
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:59,870
eat and they'll drop the spoon and a 
will go in the floor and they think,

837
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:02,220
oh,
gravity,

838
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:04,860
that's interesting.
So then you'll give them their,

839
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:05,873
their spoon again,
and the first thing they'll do is take 

840
00:46:07,321 --> 00:46:08,154
their food and finding it on the floor 
and then they'll do that launch because 

841
00:46:10,951 --> 00:46:11,784
they're kind of interested in this whole
twisting the spoon and having things 

842
00:46:16,021 --> 00:46:16,854
fall on the floor phenomena.
And so it's part of the reason why it's 

843
00:46:19,051 --> 00:46:21,600
often hard to feed babies is because 
even if they're hungry,

844
00:46:21,601 --> 00:46:23,760
you feed them three things and then 
they're not starving.

845
00:46:23,761 --> 00:46:25,970
And then they're so hyper curious that 
they're gonna,

846
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:27,750
you know,
try to do something else.

847
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:30,390
So,
but what they're doing is they're,

848
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:31,453
they're continually utilizing their 
basic reflexive behavior and building 

849
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:37,163
more and more complex structures up on 
the basis of that and with each time 

850
00:46:40,741 --> 00:46:41,574
they do that,
it opens up a new toolbox for them and 

851
00:46:43,171 --> 00:46:44,004
they know,
expand outward and start to interact 

852
00:46:45,781 --> 00:46:46,614
with the world.
And so that's one way also of 

853
00:46:49,441 --> 00:46:54,441
understanding
where a baby's personality comes from.

854
00:46:57,830 --> 00:46:58,663
Ali's is complicated because
there are things about babies that are 

855
00:47:03,031 --> 00:47:03,864
sort of

856
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:08,760
their parameters of personality or 
somewhat determined at birth.

857
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:12,990
So I'll tell you how I conceptualized 
this.

858
00:47:12,991 --> 00:47:13,824
It's,
it's how you might conceptualize the 

859
00:47:15,121 --> 00:47:15,954
relationship between nature and nurture.
I don't know if this is a good metaphor 

860
00:47:19,231 --> 00:47:20,064
or not.
It's not the most elegant metaphor in 

861
00:47:21,811 --> 00:47:23,280
the world,
but it's worked for me.

862
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,473
So imagine for example,
that a baby at three months of age can 

863
00:47:30,491 --> 00:47:33,910
be a corn baby or nervous baby.
Now that is the case.

864
00:47:33,911 --> 00:47:34,744
We know that even right at birth you 
could kind of figure out whether a baby 

865
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:40,810
is a baby or or nervous paypal.
that's neuroticism.

866
00:47:40,811 --> 00:47:43,210
That's the fundamental dimension of 
negative emotion.

867
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:44,883
So you might say that one baby's nervous
behavior might have this range and 

868
00:47:48,821 --> 00:47:49,654
another baby's nervous behavior might 
have this range and another baby's 

869
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,033
nervous behavior by cab,
this range and most of the time it sort 

870
00:47:55,481 --> 00:47:56,314
of in the middle of that range and now 
and then it'll manifest behaviors that 

871
00:47:59,921 --> 00:48:02,710
are associated with what's extreme for 
it.

872
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:03,543
So even if you have a calm baby,
sometimes it'll get upset and even if 

873
00:48:05,741 --> 00:48:08,680
you have a baby that's always upset,
sometimes it will be caught.

874
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:14,640
So then you might ask yourself,
well to what degree can you modulate the

875
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:16,354
baby's nervous behavior?
So let's say you want to have more calm 

876
00:48:19,691 --> 00:48:21,760
baby,
and so you're going to do some things to

877
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:22,623
make that baby calm.
The question is how much transformation 

878
00:48:27,281 --> 00:48:28,114
can you make?
And the answered that to some degree is 

879
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:31,074
it depends on how much effort you make.
Some changes that are close to the 

880
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,850
average of the baby's natural curve of 
responses are fairly easy to make.

881
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:43,450
So you can shift the baby a little bit 
towards being more calm without too much

882
00:48:43,451 --> 00:48:46,570
work.
But if you want to shift it more towards

883
00:48:46,571 --> 00:48:47,404
being calm,
then that's going to take more work and 

884
00:48:48,731 --> 00:48:50,560
if you're going to shift it more to be 
calm,

885
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:53,380
that's going to take more work and it's 
not linear.

886
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:58,810
So what happens is at some point you 
kind of reach a practIcal limit.

887
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:02,110
You're not going to make your baby more 
calm than you know.

888
00:49:02,111 --> 00:49:02,944
Maybe you could move it one standard 
deviation or two standard deviations 

889
00:49:05,921 --> 00:49:07,930
from its natural

890
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:12,810
resting place when it was first,
when it first emerged as a creature.

891
00:49:12,811 --> 00:49:16,830
But if you're going to move it three to 
three standard deviations from the fifth

892
00:49:16,831 --> 00:49:20,040
percentile to the 95th percentile,
you're going to be working out.

893
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:22,120
You're not going to be doing anything 
else with the baby.

894
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:23,243
So you can start to conceptualize the 
relationship between nature and nurture 

895
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:30,210
as a cost relationship.
So for example,

896
00:49:30,211 --> 00:49:32,790
iq is quite stable,
but you can move iq,

897
00:49:32,791 --> 00:49:36,210
but it's really expensive.
So there's a practical limit to it.

898
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,373
So I think if you take twins that are 
adopted out at birth in order to get a 

899
00:49:42,451 --> 00:49:45,270
15 point difference in iq between the 
twins,

900
00:49:45,271 --> 00:49:46,104
by the time they become adult,
one twin has to be at the 95th 

901
00:49:49,081 --> 00:49:49,914
percentile for wealth in their family 
and the other twin has to be at the 

902
00:49:52,261 --> 00:49:55,560
fifth percentile for wealth.
So that's a massive difference,

903
00:49:55,561 --> 00:49:56,640
right?
It's huge.

904
00:49:56,641 --> 00:49:57,474
And so it's such a big difference.
You're not going to produce that with 

905
00:49:59,971 --> 00:50:00,804
any degree of ease in the real world.
But so environmental transformations of 

906
00:50:05,281 --> 00:50:07,230
biological parameters,
cost,

907
00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:09,150
that's a very useful way of thinking 
about it.

908
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,550
So.
So anyways,

909
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:13,140
back to the baby.

910
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:15,163
Now

911
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:24,390
the baby is starting to organize itself 
from the bottom up.

912
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:25,553
And so here's,
here's kind of a way to about how that 

913
00:50:28,281 --> 00:50:29,114
works.
Piaget pointed out that this is quite 

914
00:50:32,661 --> 00:50:34,340
well known in the development 
literature,

915
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:39,730
that babies that are younger than three 
don't really play well with others

916
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:47,600
and it's complicated because they can 
play some things with others.

917
00:50:47,601 --> 00:50:48,434
So for example,
you can play peekaboo quite well with 

918
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:52,330
the nine month old,
you know,

919
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:53,203
so there's some sorts of simple games 
that that babies can play with you 

920
00:50:57,590 --> 00:50:59,780
pretty much as soon as they get their 
eyes focused.

921
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:03,980
And one of the funny things about babies
when they're very young,

922
00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:04,814
even below nine months,
is that they already have a sense of 

923
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:06,854
humor,
which is something I've never been able 

924
00:51:08,211 --> 00:51:09,044
to figure out.
So they can play a little comical games 

925
00:51:10,971 --> 00:51:11,804
with you as soon as you're smart enough 
to figure out what the baby's up to 

926
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,170
roughly speaking as they.

927
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:21,170
They appreciate humor absurdly early and
it's very difficult to understand why.

928
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,360
But anyways,
it doesn't matter.

929
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,793
The psg eddie and idea was in some sense
that what the baby does to begin with 

930
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:31,610
his first plays games with itself.
So it's exploring,

931
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:32,533
you know,
and then it produces some phenomena of 

932
00:51:34,311 --> 00:51:37,040
interest and then it replicates that 
until it masters it.

933
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:37,874
And then it just keeps doing that and 
gets to be more and more and more 

934
00:51:40,221 --> 00:51:42,470
complex.
And then by the time it's about three,

935
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:43,903
it's complex enough so that all of its 
little microsystems are kind of 

936
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:49,110
integrated into one thing,
you know,

937
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:51,710
so it's got a set of routines for being 
hungry.

938
00:51:51,711 --> 00:51:53,750
It's got a set of routines for being 
anxious,

939
00:51:53,751 --> 00:51:56,120
it's got a set of routines for being 
exploratory,

940
00:51:56,420 --> 00:52:01,420
it's got a set of routines for seeking 
attention from its parent and so on.

941
00:52:01,611 --> 00:52:02,444
And then it starting to build some 
overarching unity among all of those 

942
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:12,100
micro processes so that it can segue 
smoothly between them.

943
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,390
And you can really see this starting to 
happen at two because you know,

944
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:17,263
you've heard of the terrible twos and 
what happens in the terrible two's is 

945
00:52:19,551 --> 00:52:22,660
that the child is still fairly 
unintegrated.

946
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,533
so they'll go there quite a riot to be 
around because they're staggeringly 

947
00:52:26,691 --> 00:52:27,590
emotional.
You know,

948
00:52:27,591 --> 00:52:31,310
they'll go from Guinea beyond belief to 
crying outrageously,

949
00:52:31,311 --> 00:52:32,144
too.
So angry that if you ever saw an adult 

950
00:52:33,861 --> 00:52:34,694
that angry,
you'd immediately run away and call the 

951
00:52:36,471 --> 00:52:39,260
police.
And they can do that like in 15 minuteS.

952
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,360
They just cycle through these things 
very,

953
00:52:41,361 --> 00:52:42,760
very rapidly.
So and,

954
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:43,623
and weirdly enough adults will notice 
behaviors or they'll see behaviors in 

955
00:52:48,651 --> 00:52:49,484
children that would be absolutely 
outrageous and adults and they don't 

956
00:52:52,101 --> 00:52:54,500
even really,
it doesn't phase them at all.

957
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:57,050
It shows you how well adapted we already
children because you know,

958
00:52:57,290 --> 00:53:00,170
a child who's having a tantrum,
if the child is good at it,

959
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:03,080
you know,
they'll fling themselves onto the floor,

960
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:05,120
which you rarely see an adult do.

961
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:06,343
And then the pound and kick and scream,
and then if they're really good at it 

962
00:53:10,371 --> 00:53:12,440
and some of them get really amazingly 
good at it,

963
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:15,170
they'll hold their breath until they 
turn blue and pass out.

964
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:18,250
So I try that one night when you're,
you know,

965
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:21,680
when you don't have anything to do in 
your color is off,

966
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,573
you know,
just see if you can kick and scream on 

967
00:53:24,441 --> 00:53:27,750
the floor for awhile and then hold your 
breath until you turn blue and pass out.

968
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:32,070
You can't.
And that just shows you how committed to

969
00:53:32,071 --> 00:53:32,904
the tantrum a child can be.
So it's easy to stop that sort of 

970
00:53:36,931 --> 00:53:37,764
behavior by the way.
So if your child throws a tantrum that 

971
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:41,243
said home,
just go away and then eventually the 

972
00:53:44,161 --> 00:53:44,994
child will turn blue and pass out,
then they'll come to and there isn't 

973
00:53:47,161 --> 00:53:50,240
anyone there and that's not really an 
exciting outcomes.

974
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:51,073
So if you do that two or three times,
the child usually figures out that it's 

975
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:55,300
really not worth the hassle.
If you want him to choke,

976
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:56,153
to continue,
wait until they turn blue and pass out 

977
00:53:58,231 --> 00:54:01,860
and then really freak out.
Especially if you could do that randomly

978
00:54:01,861 --> 00:54:02,850
a few times,
man,

979
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:05,610
you'll get that child just having 
tantrums,

980
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,190
turning blue and passing out pretty much
everywhere.

981
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,650
So don't,
don't do that.

982
00:54:10,651 --> 00:54:13,750
That's a bad idea.
So all right,

983
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:17,670
now.
So the got and idea in some sense is the

984
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,760
child builds up these little reflexes 
and these little,

985
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:21,653
we'll call them subpersonalities because
it's a better way of thinking about it 

986
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:25,043
and it starts to build them around.
Modern psychologists would think more 

987
00:54:30,031 --> 00:54:32,670
thAt it starts to build them around 
motIvational systems.

988
00:54:32,671 --> 00:54:34,710
Piaget would necessarily say that,
but,

989
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,000
and then at some point the child starts 
to enter the social world.

990
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:46,680
Now it's simple in some ways to think of
the child before three is not social and

991
00:54:46,681 --> 00:54:51,420
then the child after three is social,
but it's not really accurate,

992
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:53,310
right?
Because if you think about it,

993
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:54,953
the child is being social right from the
beginning of its development because 

994
00:54:58,201 --> 00:55:00,210
first of all it has to figure out,
for example,

995
00:55:00,211 --> 00:55:02,490
how to feed even if it's not being 
breastfed.

996
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,473
It Has to figure out how to participate 
in a playful and social manner around 

997
00:55:08,041 --> 00:55:08,874
feeding and that's particularly the case
if the child has to breastfeed because 

998
00:55:11,461 --> 00:55:15,060
breastfeeding is very complex process.
First of all,

999
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:17,520
you have to get the mother to cooperate 
and you can't fight her,

1000
00:55:17,521 --> 00:55:18,354
for example,
and so there's all sorts of rules about 

1001
00:55:20,071 --> 00:55:20,904
breastfeeding that the baby has to 
follow and so the babies actually 

1002
00:55:23,221 --> 00:55:24,054
entering into fairly complex social 
relationships in games right from the 

1003
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:29,753
beginning,
and that's especially true if it also 

1004
00:55:30,721 --> 00:55:34,390
has siblings because if you have a baby 
and maybe have a two year old,

1005
00:55:34,391 --> 00:55:35,224
the two year old and the baby are 
playing right off the bat and they're 

1006
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:40,380
two year olds are amazingly good at 
playing with newborns.

1007
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:41,723
It's quite staggering to watch them and 
so if you're thinking about having 

1008
00:55:43,891 --> 00:55:46,200
children,
and I also recommend not just having one

1009
00:55:46,201 --> 00:55:47,034
because one child is way more work than 
three because you have to amuse one 

1010
00:55:50,491 --> 00:55:52,680
child all the time.
Whereas if you have three,

1011
00:55:52,681 --> 00:55:54,910
you can ignore them completely and 
they'll just raise each other.

1012
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:58,770
It's actually much better for the 
children,

1013
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,280
you know,
as long as you're there not to make sure

1014
00:56:00,281 --> 00:56:02,430
that they don't lie to each other on 
fire and that sort of thing,

1015
00:56:02,431 --> 00:56:05,250
which is your basically your jaw.
So okay.

1016
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:06,383
But we'll ask for the time being as if 
the child isn't social till three 

1017
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:12,480
because that's simplification,
but it's a useful one.

1018
00:56:12,481 --> 00:56:13,314
So piaget was also extremely interested 
in how the child became social and I 

1019
00:56:19,591 --> 00:56:23,330
think apart from his ideas about,
you know,

1020
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:26,170
the,
the self generation of the baby from the

1021
00:56:26,171 --> 00:56:30,450
bottom upwards using its own reflexes 
and its own capacity to be explored.

1022
00:56:30,451 --> 00:56:33,670
The other thing that piaget was 
extraordinarily good at

1023
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:41,540
laying out and andy and remarkable at 
discovering what's the role of games.

1024
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:47,840
And so piaget was the first 
psychologist,

1025
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,033
I would say,
who discovered just how important it is 

1026
00:56:53,611 --> 00:56:55,860
to have kids play.
Now,

1027
00:56:55,861 --> 00:56:59,730
the problem with players that it's fun 
and so utilitarian people,

1028
00:56:59,731 --> 00:57:01,740
especially ones that are really 
conscientious,

1029
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:04,980
have this idea that if it's fun,
it can't really be good for you.

1030
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:10,280
And so because of that,
the role of play in children was not and

1031
00:57:11,131 --> 00:57:15,450
still isn't appreciated in the full 
dimensions of its importance.

1032
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:17,270
So for example,
you know,

1033
00:57:17,271 --> 00:57:19,890
we take the kids that are in grade one 
there like six,

1034
00:57:19,891 --> 00:57:21,270
you know,
what are we doing for them?

1035
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,490
We put them in chairs like the ones 
you're in,

1036
00:57:23,491 --> 00:57:26,190
you've been in that damn chair for like 
16 years,

1037
00:57:26,191 --> 00:57:27,024
you know,
it's like we take those little 

1038
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:29,393
characters and we put them in chairs and
we expect them to sit there and listen 

1039
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:34,360
to adults for six hours a day while 
it's,

1040
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,160
it's so idiotic that it's beyond 
comprehension.

1041
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:40,500
It's no wonder tHe little gliders are 
hyperactive,

1042
00:57:40,501 --> 00:57:42,480
you know,
that just means they're alive.

1043
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:43,703
They shouldn't be taken out into the 
school yard and supervised well playing 

1044
00:57:46,891 --> 00:57:50,430
until they're completely exhausted.
Then they should have a little nap.

1045
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,250
Then maybe you could teach them 
something for awhile,

1046
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:54,623
but

1047
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:56,743
stopping them from playing on an or or 
not facilitating play among them is 

1048
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:02,413
absolutely crazy because that's exactly 
how children come to become social in 

1049
00:58:06,381 --> 00:58:07,214
the world.
And the reason for that is that the 

1050
00:58:09,711 --> 00:58:14,711
games children play are analogs of the 
activities that adults engage in.

1051
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:16,970
Well,
it's not that hard to figure it out.

1052
00:58:16,971 --> 00:58:18,530
Figure that out.
If you think about it,

1053
00:58:18,531 --> 00:58:21,470
I mean think about playing monopoly or 
you're a teenager,

1054
00:58:21,471 --> 00:58:24,200
you play monopoly.
How many people have played monopoly?

1055
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:26,870
Great.
Everybody's played monopoly.

1056
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,130
Well,
what are you doing?

1057
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:30,830
You're,
it's like evil capitalist pig gain,

1058
00:58:30,831 --> 00:58:32,050
right?
So,

1059
00:58:32,051 --> 00:58:34,490
and you know,
if you're going to grow up to be an evil

1060
00:58:34,491 --> 00:58:36,950
capitalist pig,
then you can get a good practice,

1061
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:40,040
good practice going by playing monopoly 
and you can,

1062
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:43,970
you can become part of the one percent,
which is what you have to do to win,

1063
00:58:43,971 --> 00:58:44,804
right?
You need to have all the hotels and so 

1064
00:58:46,821 --> 00:58:51,560
no one else has any hotels and you know,
you play that and it's fun.

1065
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:56,630
It's fun.
So it's an analog of real life now.

1066
00:58:57,230 --> 00:58:58,063
It's an analog of real life in many ways
because most of the things that you do 

1067
00:59:01,281 --> 00:59:05,900
with other people involve adhering to a 
set of shared rules.

1068
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:07,933
And most of the things that you do with 
other people involve cooperating and 

1069
00:59:12,141 --> 00:59:15,430
competing with them.
so if you're playing monopoly,

1070
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,030
are you cooperating or competing?

1071
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:22,340
How many people think competing?
Okay.

1072
00:59:22,341 --> 00:59:25,160
How many people think cooperating?
Okay,

1073
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:30,350
you're cooperating.
Are you playing the same rules?

1074
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:33,200
Are you playing by the same rules?
Well,

1075
00:59:33,201 --> 00:59:34,550
yes.
Unless you're cheating.

1076
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:36,770
If you're cheating,
you're not playing monopoly,

1077
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:37,970
right?
You're cheating.

1078
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:38,863
ThAt's a different game.
So to play monopoly you have to 

1079
00:59:41,301 --> 00:59:44,270
cooperate because you have to all agree 
to sit in the same place.

1080
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:46,520
You have to agree not to steal the 
money.

1081
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:50,330
You have to agree that the stupid rules 
which are completely arbitrary,

1082
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:52,790
are the ones that are going to govern 
your life for the next,

1083
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,410
you know,
two hours.

1084
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:58,490
You have to agree to try.
You have to agree to try to have fun.

1085
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:01,670
You have to agree to try to be like a 
good player,

1086
01:00:01,671 --> 01:00:04,200
which means you don't get all sniffly 
and whiny when someone,

1087
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:07,690
when you land on someone's boardwalk and
they completely bankrupt you,

1088
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:10,430
you know,
so you're cooperating like mad.

1089
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,760
And another thing piaget pointed out,
which is absolutely lovely,

1090
01:00:13,761 --> 01:00:14,594
is that you can have a game without 
cooperation and competition at the same 

1091
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:20,503
time.
So there's no such thing as cooperative 

1092
01:00:22,701 --> 01:00:26,630
games.
You have to have for it to be a game,

1093
01:00:26,631 --> 01:00:27,464
it has to be competition within 
cooperation or it can be cooperation 

1094
01:00:31,161 --> 01:00:33,200
within competition,
within cooperation.

1095
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:34,363
You know,
these things are very complex and the 

1096
01:00:35,601 --> 01:00:37,220
nasty.
So if you're playing hockey,

1097
01:00:37,221 --> 01:00:39,050
for example,
is,

1098
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:43,340
is hockey and aggressive game or come or
a cooperative game?

1099
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:46,380
Well,
you have to play by the rules.

1100
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,130
So both teams agree to that.
You're on the ice at the same time.

1101
01:00:49,131 --> 01:00:51,560
You don't bring a basket basketball,
you don't bring a chess game.

1102
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:52,543
you're there to play hockey.
Are you cooperating or competing with 

1103
01:00:55,221 --> 01:00:56,870
your teammates?
Well,

1104
01:00:56,871 --> 01:00:57,620
both,
right?

1105
01:00:57,620 --> 01:01:00,620
You're cooperating with them because you
want everyone to win.

1106
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:01,483
Plus,
you want everybody to get better at 

1107
01:01:02,631 --> 01:01:03,464
playing across time,
but you're competing with them because 

1108
01:01:05,271 --> 01:01:08,870
maybe you can be the star of the game 
and everybody's happy about that.

1109
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:10,340
And then with the other team,
well,

1110
01:01:10,490 --> 01:01:12,290
are you cooperating or competing with 
them?

1111
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,630
Well,
as long as you're playing by the rules,

1112
01:01:14,631 --> 01:01:15,464
you're cooperating,
but there's obviously an element of 

1113
01:01:16,941 --> 01:01:18,200
competition.
Now,

1114
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:21,680
almost every human activity has those 
elements.

1115
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,710
There's a body of rules underneath it or
if they're not rules,

1116
01:01:24,711 --> 01:01:26,840
they're at least social conventions,
right?

1117
01:01:26,841 --> 01:01:30,320
There are things that people understand 
are allowed and not allowed,

1118
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:32,960
and then there's a competitive and a 
cooperative element.

1119
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:33,853
Alright,
so that's what children's start to 

1120
01:01:35,361 --> 01:01:38,180
become particularly exposed to when 
they're about three.

1121
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:39,943
I'll piaget pointed out that there were 
in some sense two classes of children's 

1122
01:01:43,161 --> 01:01:43,994
games.
There was the games that have a really 

1123
01:01:46,401 --> 01:01:51,290
clearly defined aim and that'd be the 
goal and that'd be like,

1124
01:01:51,291 --> 01:01:52,124
you know,
in the little circles that we were 

1125
01:01:52,551 --> 01:01:55,250
talking about,
that's where you're trying to go.

1126
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:56,443
Now,
the thing about it being a game is that 

1127
01:01:58,700 --> 01:01:59,533
all of you have to be trying to go there
at the same time and so what piaget 

1128
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:04,453
realized was that just as the child is 
trying to integrate all their little 

1129
01:02:08,001 --> 01:02:11,420
micro games inside them into some sort 
of unified thing,

1130
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:12,313
which would be the child,
a stable personality across time and 

1131
01:02:15,111 --> 01:02:17,510
capable of weathering the storms of 
life.

1132
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:18,823
When a group of children get together,
they build another one of those 

1133
01:02:21,211 --> 01:02:22,044
routines,
but it includes all of them and so the 

1134
01:02:24,001 --> 01:02:24,840
kids might say,
well,

1135
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:28,500
let's play hide and go seek.
That's a good one,

1136
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:29,543
and everyone knows the rules to hide and
go seek and you can win or lose it 

1137
01:02:32,551 --> 01:02:33,301
heightened,
go seek.

1138
01:02:33,301 --> 01:02:34,134
But what you're trying to do is you have
to bring your subpersonalities all the 

1139
01:02:38,131 --> 01:02:42,240
way up to their integrated state 
underneath a metal structure,

1140
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:45,180
but that's organized by the collection 
of children.

1141
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:46,740
So the child would say,
well,

1142
01:02:46,741 --> 01:02:50,220
do you want to play hide and go seek?
And you're supposed to say you're either

1143
01:02:50,221 --> 01:02:54,390
supposed to say yes or perhaps positive 
another game.

1144
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:55,673
You're not supposed to freak out or get 
angry or say that that's a stupid game 

1145
01:02:58,171 --> 01:02:59,004
or run back to your mom because then 
you're not going to be very popular and 

1146
01:03:01,681 --> 01:03:02,514
you're not going to get to play,
and if you don't get to play well then 

1147
01:03:04,621 --> 01:03:04,990
you're.

1148
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:05,823
You're ruined because if you don't learn
how to play with others between two and 

1149
01:03:09,001 --> 01:03:09,834
four,
you never learn and then you're some 

1150
01:03:11,131 --> 01:03:11,964
poor outcast and maybe you end up in 
jail or at least you end up like 

1151
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:20,090
isolated and and awkward and and poorly 
socially integrated.

1152
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:25,940
And that's not good because if you don't
get into the kids' games at three,

1153
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:29,400
all of them start moving ahead and you 
don't.

1154
01:03:29,790 --> 01:03:32,220
And the farther they've moved ahead past
you,

1155
01:03:32,221 --> 01:03:34,290
the less likely it is that they're going
to play with you.

1156
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,153
So one of the things that's really worth
thinking about if you're going to have 

1157
01:03:38,071 --> 01:03:38,904
kids is you have a job as a parent and 
your job as a parent is to make your 

1158
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:47,361
child socially acceptable,
especially to other children by the time

1159
01:03:47,551 --> 01:03:50,640
they're three.
And if you don't do that well,

1160
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:55,250
that's not very good.
You'll pay for it and so will your child

1161
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:58,080
and you know,
there's been lots of longterm followup.

1162
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:58,933
So on this sort of thing and it seems 
pretty evident that if the kid isn't 

1163
01:04:01,851 --> 01:04:02,684
socialized by

1164
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:06,230
for then good luck.

1165
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:10,290
There is no evidence at all from the 
developmental literature,

1166
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:13,290
which is quite a dismal literature that 
you can fix that.

1167
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,660
So anyways.
All right,

1168
01:04:15,661 --> 01:04:17,400
so the children don't get together and 
they say,

1169
01:04:17,401 --> 01:04:20,850
well here's what we're going to do.
And everyone says yes.

1170
01:04:20,851 --> 01:04:25,650
And so they orient their personalities 
towards that goal and then they interact

1171
01:04:25,651 --> 01:04:26,484
in a cooperative and competitive way in 
pursuing the goal and that's a game and 

1172
01:04:30,871 --> 01:04:31,704
what they're doing is practicing being 
social human beings and so and they do 

1173
01:04:35,761 --> 01:04:38,100
that with all sorts of different games.
and then you might say,

1174
01:04:38,101 --> 01:04:40,860
well here's something really worth 
thinking about.

1175
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:43,680
What does it mean to be a functional 
human being?

1176
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:46,903
It to me it means to be the sort of 
human being that can be a good player 

1177
01:04:50,851 --> 01:04:54,690
across multiple games.
So you might think,

1178
01:04:54,691 --> 01:04:57,240
for example,
you tell your kid,

1179
01:04:59,410 --> 01:05:02,470
I'll tell you the story,
but hockey game that I saw once

1180
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:06,013
hockey parents say 10 percent of them 
should just be jailed as soon as they 

1181
01:05:08,601 --> 01:05:12,080
enter the arena.
So when my kid played,

1182
01:05:14,370 --> 01:05:18,100
I don't know what you'd call it,
a level

1183
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:20,380
high level hockey for a while when he 
was a kid anyways,

1184
01:05:20,381 --> 01:05:22,150
he was a good,
here's a good hockey player,

1185
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,553
but it was really unbearable.
So we didn't do it for very long for a 

1186
01:05:25,991 --> 01:05:27,400
variety of reasons.
But anyways,

1187
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:30,880
on his way to learning how to play 
hockey,

1188
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:35,170
he was in one of these uh,
local leagues.

1189
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:36,213
We had an arena just around the corner,
fortunately enough and he wasn't the 

1190
01:05:39,431 --> 01:05:42,060
best player on the team.
There was a,

1191
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,130
another kid on the team who was,
who is better,

1192
01:05:45,131 --> 01:05:46,960
I would save.
And uh,

1193
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:49,233
he uh,
he was in a championship game at one 

1194
01:05:51,671 --> 01:05:53,320
point.
He hadn't been in very many championship

1195
01:05:53,321 --> 01:05:55,210
games because there's teams often work 
very good.

1196
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,193
But anyways,
it was the local championship and we 

1197
01:05:58,961 --> 01:06:01,690
went and watched and it was a really fun
game,

1198
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:03,160
you know,
like it was really close,

1199
01:06:03,161 --> 01:06:06,790
I think if I think it was three,
three till the final 15 or 20 seconds,

1200
01:06:06,791 --> 01:06:10,120
and then some kid from the other team 
scored a really good goal,

1201
01:06:10,121 --> 01:06:10,571
you know,
it was,

1202
01:06:10,571 --> 01:06:11,404
it wasn't one of those things where they
accidentally kicked the pocket into the 

1203
01:06:13,121 --> 01:06:13,770
[inaudible] or something.

1204
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:16,660
It was a really nice play.
And so it was a tight game.

1205
01:06:16,661 --> 01:06:17,494
The teams were well matched,
the local league had made sure like 

1206
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:24,400
they'd set up teams together and then if
one team kept winning to consistently or

1207
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:25,234
one losing to consistently being sort of
revamp the team so they were roughly 

1208
01:06:28,571 --> 01:06:30,070
equal,
which I really liked because,

1209
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,590
you know,
all the kids got a reasonably equal shot

1210
01:06:32,591 --> 01:06:35,020
at it and everybody got to develop.
so anyways,

1211
01:06:35,021 --> 01:06:36,460
we were watching that.
It was pretty fun.

1212
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,760
And uh,
they,

1213
01:06:38,790 --> 01:06:39,623
the star kid,
he was skating around out there and the 

1214
01:06:42,521 --> 01:06:43,354
game ended and he went off the ice and 
he smashed his hockey stick onto the 

1215
01:06:46,121 --> 01:06:48,360
cement because he was all irritated and 
you know,

1216
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:49,203
which was pretty pathetic.
And then his father came running up to 

1217
01:06:52,211 --> 01:06:52,871
him and said,
oh,

1218
01:06:52,871 --> 01:06:54,880
you got robbed.
It was really terrible,

1219
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:58,030
you know,
the rafting was bad and you play it very

1220
01:06:58,031 --> 01:07:00,190
well and you should have won the game.
And he didn't say,

1221
01:07:00,191 --> 01:07:01,024
you know,
stop being a little rat and smashing 

1222
01:07:02,141 --> 01:07:04,660
your hockey,
stick onto the cement like your three,

1223
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:05,890
which is what he should have said.

1224
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:07,590
He,
he

1225
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:12,190
basically rewarded his child for 
narcissistic,

1226
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:18,520
a immature misbehavior.
So it was pretty pathetic.

1227
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:21,430
Was child abuse as far as I'm concerned,
sort of up the second,

1228
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:22,870
man.
That's stupid.

1229
01:07:22,871 --> 01:07:24,820
What are you going to do?
You're going to train your child to be a

1230
01:07:24,821 --> 01:07:26,860
narcissist.
That course,

1231
01:07:26,861 --> 01:07:28,960
that's child abuse.
It's moronic.

1232
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,970
Of course it was due to his own 
foolishness,

1233
01:07:30,971 --> 01:07:33,070
but I don't know if that's criminal,
right?

1234
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:35,380
But it was really pathetic.
So,

1235
01:07:35,381 --> 01:07:37,270
but no,
but think about this now for a minute.

1236
01:07:37,271 --> 01:07:39,370
So you might think,
well what did that kid do wrong?

1237
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:40,630
It's like,
well,

1238
01:07:40,631 --> 01:07:42,690
he wanted to win,
so that's okay.

1239
01:07:43,150 --> 01:07:44,890
You should want to win.
If you're playing a game.

1240
01:07:44,891 --> 01:07:45,724
I mean you're not any fun if you're 
playing a game and you're not trying to 

1241
01:07:48,101 --> 01:07:51,250
win and there's nothing more miserable 
than playing a game with someone.

1242
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:52,093
At the end of they say,
well you won because I wasn't really 

1243
01:07:53,921 --> 01:07:54,940
trying.
It's like,

1244
01:07:55,310 --> 01:07:56,890
no,
you're not going to play with them again

1245
01:07:56,891 --> 01:07:57,724
if they do that.
And that's kind of interesting because 

1246
01:07:59,051 --> 01:08:01,780
it means they've done something wrong.
No,

1247
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:05,200
when even a kid can figure that out.
And so you might tell your kid,

1248
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:10,560
be a good sport
and it doesn't matter whether you win or

1249
01:08:10,561 --> 01:08:12,150
not.
It matters how you play the game.

1250
01:08:12,151 --> 01:08:12,984
Now what the hell kid doesn't know how 
to what to make of that and you hardly 

1251
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:16,160
believe it.
You think,

1252
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:17,470
yeah,
it doesn't matter if you win.

1253
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:18,313
So I don't know what this means,
but you'll tell the child that and so 

1254
01:08:21,351 --> 01:08:22,430
then you might think,
well,

1255
01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:27,490
what does it mean to be a good sport?
And and that and that.

1256
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,620
How you played the game is more 
important than whether you win or lose.

1257
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:32,450
Okay,
so think about it this way.

1258
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:39,140
What's your goal?
Well,

1259
01:08:39,141 --> 01:08:39,974
you might say to win the hockey game,
but that implies you're only going to 

1260
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:43,093
play one hockey game,
but it's going to play 100 hockey games 

1261
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:47,093
and then forget about that.
What if you're going to play 100 hockey 

1262
01:08:48,601 --> 01:08:49,434
games and 200 basketball games and 50 
chess games and you're going to have a 

1263
01:08:53,311 --> 01:08:54,144
bunch of jobs and you're going to have a
bunch of friends and you can have a 

1264
01:08:55,681 --> 01:08:59,940
bunch of relationships and all of those 
have a game like structure and let's say

1265
01:08:59,941 --> 01:09:00,774
that you're a real son of a bitch when 
you play hockey and so no one ever 

1266
01:09:02,461 --> 01:09:04,740
invites you to do any of those other 
things.

1267
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:05,641
It's like,
well,

1268
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:08,100
you win the game,
but you lose the metagame.

1269
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:09,953
The metagame is the game that's made up 
of all the games you're ever going to 

1270
01:09:12,091 --> 01:09:17,091
play and what a parent means when they 
say it doesn't matter whether you win or

1271
01:09:17,791 --> 01:09:20,460
lose,
it matters how you play the game is that

1272
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:21,533
the metagame is more important than the 
game and you should learn how to play 

1273
01:09:23,791 --> 01:09:26,640
games so that whether or not you win or 
lose,

1274
01:09:26,910 --> 01:09:31,560
people really want to play with you 
because if they want to play with you,

1275
01:09:31,561 --> 01:09:32,460
man,
you're set.

1276
01:09:32,490 --> 01:09:34,290
Right?
So here's,

1277
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:35,790
here's a cool game.
So,

1278
01:09:35,791 --> 01:09:37,830
okay,
you two are going to play this game.

1279
01:09:37,831 --> 01:09:39,000
Are you ready?
Okay.

1280
01:09:39,001 --> 01:09:42,630
So here's the deal.
I'm going to give you $20.

1281
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:47,430
You have to give some of that to him.
You want to get to offer once.

1282
01:09:47,670 --> 01:09:49,740
If he rejects it,
neither of you get anything.

1283
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:51,780
Okay?
How much are you going to give him?

1284
01:09:52,590 --> 01:09:53,820
10.
Would you take that?

1285
01:09:53,950 --> 01:09:54,980
Okay?
Okay.

1286
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,120
What?
Why?

1287
01:09:57,780 --> 01:10:01,620
I mean like these better than not 
second,

1288
01:10:01,850 --> 01:10:03,540
clara maass,
right?

1289
01:10:04,170 --> 01:10:04,681
Yeah.
Yeah.

1290
01:10:04,681 --> 01:10:05,514
So here's.
This experiment is being done all over 

1291
01:10:06,721 --> 01:10:07,554
the world.
And so basically what they find is that 

1292
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:13,890
people pretty much offer 50 slash 50.
Now here's something cool.

1293
01:10:13,891 --> 01:10:17,670
Let's say you go play this game and use 
20 bucks in your planet with really poor

1294
01:10:17,671 --> 01:10:19,890
people.
And so you,

1295
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:22,650
you set the game up.
So you say,

1296
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:25,060
look,
offer him two bucks,

1297
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:27,090
he's poor,
he'll take it.

1298
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,190
So you offered to box,
what does he do?

1299
01:10:30,490 --> 01:10:32,720
He tells you to screw off,
right?

1300
01:10:32,730 --> 01:10:35,040
And he's more likely to do that if he's 
poor.

1301
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:37,590
So that's pretty interesting.
[inaudible],

1302
01:10:37,591 --> 01:10:39,390
like a classical economists would say,
look,

1303
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:41,820
what you should've done was offered them
a dollar.

1304
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:45,120
It's like you get 19,
you get 19,

1305
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:45,983
he gets a dollar,
he's going to take the damn dollar 

1306
01:10:47,371 --> 01:10:50,280
because it's better than nothing.
But thAt is more people are like,

1307
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:53,340
it's like you give them a dollar and you
get 19,

1308
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,440
they want to punch you,
right?

1309
01:10:55,441 --> 01:10:56,274
They're not going to take that.
And that's because they don't want to 

1310
01:10:59,191 --> 01:11:00,360
play the game that way.

1311
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:04,990
They want to play the game so that it's 
fair across multiple games.

1312
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:08,170
Now you might say,
let's say you're playing out in front of

1313
01:11:08,171 --> 01:11:11,700
a whole bunch of people like we were now
and let's say a whole,

1314
01:11:11,701 --> 01:11:12,534
all these people are going to be able to
invite you to play the same game and so 

1315
01:11:15,091 --> 01:11:18,720
maybe you're going to be able to make 
$400 in the next hour or so.

1316
01:11:18,721 --> 01:11:19,441
Then you might say,
well,

1317
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:20,274
what should I do if I wanted everybody 
to invite me to play this game as much 

1318
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,440
as possible,
then how much would you offer?

1319
01:11:25,340 --> 01:11:27,150
Fifteen.
15.

1320
01:11:27,151 --> 01:11:28,380
Exactly.
That's cool.

1321
01:11:28,381 --> 01:11:30,270
So that means actually you lost the 
gate,

1322
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:31,230
the one game,
right?

1323
01:11:31,231 --> 01:11:34,440
Because you only get 15,
five and he gets 15,

1324
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:35,820
but like everyone's thinking,
hey,

1325
01:11:35,821 --> 01:11:38,890
I'm going to play it escape with her.
Well that's,

1326
01:11:38,930 --> 01:11:42,510
that's what it means when you tell 
someone to play the game properly.

1327
01:11:43,290 --> 01:11:44,123
You say,
act as if while you're playing a 

1328
01:11:45,251 --> 01:11:46,084
specific game that there's a higher 
order moral principle that has to do 

1329
01:11:48,421 --> 01:11:49,254
with the total number of games that 
you're going to play across your entire 

1330
01:11:51,781 --> 01:11:54,900
life and play that game properly.
Yeah,

1331
01:11:54,901 --> 01:11:55,734
well that's the evolution of higher 
moral thinking in part from a piagetian 

1332
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:00,720
perspective.
It's bloody brilliant.

1333
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,680
So right.
We'll see you tuesday.
