1
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,913
We know that the snake is
utilized conceptually in metaphorically 

2
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:39,550
as representation of transformation,
right,

3
00:00:39,551 --> 00:00:43,660
because the snake is something that can 
shed its skin and be reborn.

4
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:48,460
We know that a snake is something that's
innately attractive and terrifying human

5
00:00:48,461 --> 00:00:52,150
beings and other primates so that if you
come across a snake,

6
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,140
you're likely to be at least startled,
if not horrified by it,

7
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:56,974
but also attracted to it in a way that 
is underneath your voluntary 

8
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:01,750
consciousness,
right?

9
00:01:01,751 --> 00:01:02,584
Because snakes attract orienting reflex 
isn't they activate the systems 

10
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:06,874
underneath your consciousness that 
actually governed the structure of that 

11
00:01:09,071 --> 00:01:09,904
consciousness.
We know that the snake can be well 

12
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:16,420
represented as well as internal chaos,
so imagine this,

13
00:01:16,421 --> 00:01:21,421
imagine that it's not unreasonable for a
self conscious mind searching for a mode

14
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:23,344
of self representation to remark on the 
parallels between the structure of the 

15
00:01:27,071 --> 00:01:27,904
snake and the spine and the brain.
Given that a snake is essentially a 

16
00:01:31,181 --> 00:01:32,014
spine with a brain and then imagine as 
well that the most archaic aspects of 

17
00:01:36,521 --> 00:01:37,354
our nervous system,
those that govern novelty and orienting 

18
00:01:40,271 --> 00:01:41,104
and anxiety responses are in fact 
precisely those that were described by 

19
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:45,154
Mclean as nested inside the reptilian 
brain and then imagine along with the 

20
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,410
Hindu Yogis,
that the purpose of Kundalini Yoga is to

21
00:01:53,411 --> 00:01:56,860
activate the circuitry that's associated
with that snake,

22
00:01:56,861 --> 00:01:57,694
so to speak,
to produce a permanent state of alert 

23
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,580
wakefulness.
It's associated with consciousness.

24
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,293
So imagine this.
Imagine an animal like like a zebra 

25
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,360
grazing mindlessly in the herd with no 
consciousness whatsoever,

26
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,293
and then imagine it's relatively 
undeveloped cortical structures 

27
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:22,764
activated suddenly by the movement of a 
lion off in the perimeter and then 

28
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:31,860
imagine for that brief moment that Zebra
is actually conscious state.

29
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:34,770
That requires a tremendous amount of 
energy and difficult to maintain,

30
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:35,604
but because the threat and the 
uncertainty manifest itself within the 

31
00:02:40,291 --> 00:02:41,124
zebras mode of consciousness,
it wakes momentarily and then imagine 

32
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:45,564
that human beings are like that.
Zebra always because we've become self 

33
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:53,970
conscious because we know that the 
unknown is around us all the time.

34
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:56,910
Even when we think we're safe,
we're never safe.

35
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,953
Imagine that the reason we're so 
conscious because as a consequence of 

36
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:04,420
our discovery,
of the possibility of our own mortality,

37
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,403
all this underlying circuitry that in 
other animals is only apparent when 

38
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:12,280
they're startled or afraid or interested
or curious.

39
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,233
In human beings.
It's on all the time and that's what 

40
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,694
makes us conscious and the reason for 
that is because we developed enough 

41
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,114
cortical elaboration to note that we're 
always threatened by everything that's 

42
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:26,140
around us and then imagine that.
Well,

43
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:27,430
that's pretty awful,
isn't it?

44
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:31,420
Because it's at the basis of all our 
innate existential terror,

45
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,403
but then imagine as well that without 
that terror pushing us forward and and 

46
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,180
our constant reference to the dangerous 
aspect of the unknown,

47
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,410
we would have never been motivated to 
produce the kind of societies that we've

48
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,603
produced,
which are essentially very remarkably 

49
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:49,324
elaborated devices that enable us to 
find some protection from that unknown 

50
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,620
and to manipulate,
manipulate it effectively,

51
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:01,710
and then remembering that Surrey,
we will return to genesis young says,

52
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,303
snake is was regarded by early gnostic 
Christians as a kind of daddy who's 

53
00:04:10,141 --> 00:04:10,974
faculties were more developed and 
advanced than the original daddy that 

54
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:15,660
actually structured the world.

55
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,190
The idea there being that the world 
initially was a pretty dismal place.

56
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,263
Everyone wasn't conscious.
We all existed at the level of the 

57
00:04:23,851 --> 00:04:26,790
animal and then the snake came along and
said,

58
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,100
wake up.
Wake up.

59
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,113
And the movement from that state of 
unsolved consciousness paradise to this 

60
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,990
profane state of awakening can be 
regarded not so much as a descent but as

61
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:42,470
an asset of sorts,
even though a painful one.

62
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,460
And then you have Gareth,
this commentary from Mephistopheles,

63
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,120
his representation of Satan and his 
capacity for temptation,

64
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,133
who says,
follow the adage of my cousins snake 

65
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:02,090
from dreams of godlike knowledge,
you will wake to fear in which your very

66
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:02,924
soul shall quake a statement,
associating the human tendency to 

67
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:13,880
attribute to all revolutionary sources 
of new information,

68
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:14,973
a kind of demonic being,
and then you have the problem of the 

69
00:05:19,461 --> 00:05:20,294
woman.
Now we know that within the context of 

70
00:05:22,731 --> 00:05:23,564
the Judeo Christian tradition,
women have unduly suffered for their 

71
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:27,374
role in tempting humanity in the 
embodied form of Adam towards higher 

72
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,250
order self consciousness.

73
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,083
And then you think,
well,

74
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,193
let's just take a look at how human 
beings and their mating relationships 

75
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,214
differ from those of other animals like 
chimpanzees to whom we are very closely 

76
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,820
genetically related.
And if you look at the mating strategies

77
00:05:46,821 --> 00:05:47,654
of female chimpanzees,
you see that they really don't care who 

78
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:52,340
they sleep with,
so to speak.

79
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,353
Any old chimpanzee will do.
Now the last dominant male chimps to be 

80
00:05:57,561 --> 00:05:59,930
chased away by the more dominant male 
chimps.

81
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:00,764
But if a female than less dominant chip 
can get the hell away from the watchful 

82
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,300
gaze of the dominance hierarchy,
they're perfectly happy to mate.

83
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,383
Human females are not like that.
There is selective maters and there's a 

84
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:13,334
tremendous body of evolutionary 
psychological information that suggests 

85
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:17,774
that although both genders,
value intelligence and physical 

86
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:22,094
appearance,
females value the ability to attain 

87
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:26,744
dominance,
hierarchy status in men far more than 

88
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:30,190
men.

89
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:34,010
I admire the ability to attain dominant 
status in women,

90
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,873
which is to say that men don't care for 
what a woman has with regards to 

91
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:41,510
potential for attaining status.
Whereas with women,

92
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:44,660
it's one of the strong determinant of 
mating preference.

93
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,340
So then let's say,
look,

94
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,850
we don't know why the hell are cortex 
has expanded so rapidly,

95
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,460
somewhere between five and 3 million 
years ago.

96
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,443
Let's offer this as a hypothesis.
The women started to get choosy and 

97
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:57,884
because they were so damn complicated,
the whole human species had to 

98
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:06,070
exaggerate it's cortical growth prior to
any even use for that critical growth,

99
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,130
just so that the men had an even hand in
the competition.

100
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,920
Right?
So women put tremendous selection,

101
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:16,250
pressure on the human being.
To develop tremendous,

102
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,233
tremendous cortical expansion.
Now we already know that from a 

103
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:25,580
mythological perspective that women are 
frequently cast into the same conceptual

104
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:26,414
domain,
the temptress domain as the benevolent 

105
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:32,330
aspect of the unknown,
and we know as well from representations

106
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:33,164
of hero mythology that it is the 
individual who goes out to confront 

107
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:36,914
chaos,
who's most likely to free from the 

108
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,380
dragon,
not only treasured,

109
00:07:40,381 --> 00:07:41,214
but a virgin,
say in the case of mythological 

110
00:07:43,251 --> 00:07:46,010
representations like St George and the 
dragon

111
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,730
in the Old Testament in genesis,
there's no.

112
00:07:53,731 --> 00:07:54,564
There's this notion that not only did 
people become self conscious because 

113
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,960
they did something,
but they did this voluntarily,

114
00:08:00,961 --> 00:08:01,470
right?
They,

115
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:04,050
they,
they made this decision on their own.

116
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,160
So Milton puts words into God's mouth 
and says,

117
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,233
so will fall.
He meaning the human being and his 

118
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:18,820
faithless progeny.
Whose fault,

119
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,910
whose about his own ingrained he had of 
me?

120
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,310
Oh,
he could have I made him justin,

121
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:28,060
right?
It's efficient to have stood though free

122
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,620
to fall,
and then you think,

123
00:08:29,621 --> 00:08:32,530
well,
maybe the notion of the heritable sin of

124
00:08:32,531 --> 00:08:37,210
Adam characterizing human beings in 
their fallen existential condition isn't

125
00:08:37,211 --> 00:08:38,044
just the black heart ravings of 
fundamentalist southern Baptist 

126
00:08:40,691 --> 00:08:41,710
lunatics,
right?

127
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,400
There's something to this.
Human beings are the only creatures that

128
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:46,234
seem to live at odds with their own 
experience and it's not so unreasonable 

129
00:08:49,751 --> 00:08:54,130
to suppose that it's hard dawning 
capacity for self consciousness that put

130
00:08:54,131 --> 00:08:54,964
us in that uncomfortable position.
So why do I associate the eating of the 

131
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:02,630
apple with self consciousness?
Well,

132
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,650
let's,
because that's how the story lays itself

133
00:09:04,651 --> 00:09:05,484
out.
You have the collateral evidence of the 

134
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:09,270
Buddhist story of enlightenment,
right?

135
00:09:09,271 --> 00:09:12,210
His contact with death.
You have multiple media,

136
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,560
medieval representations of Eve offering
to animal to Adam.

137
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,440
Not An apple,
but a skull.

138
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,320
You have multiple representations of the
tree,

139
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:23,154
of the knowledge of good and evil and 
medieval iconography as not containing 

140
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:26,934
apples,
but containing skulls and you have the 

141
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:33,960
statements that are within the context 
of genesis itself

142
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:36,123
and the eyes of both of them were opened
and they knew that they were naked and 

143
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:44,110
they sewed fig leaves together and made 
themselves aprons.

144
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,990
Well,
there's a lot of information packed into

145
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:48,190
those two lines,
right?

146
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,500
What does it mean to have your eyes open
or half?

147
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:53,340
Your brain is visual cortex.
It's not unreal.

148
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:56,350
It's not unreasonable to presume that 
that means a quick

149
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:02,520
I quit magnification of consciousness.
Your conscious during the day,

150
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:05,640
that's when your eyes are open or what 
happens when your eyes are open?

151
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,260
Well,
you know you're naked.

152
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,280
Well,
what does that mean?

153
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,031
Well,
you know,

154
00:10:09,031 --> 00:10:10,210
you're vulnerable,
right?

155
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,570
To social comment,
to social judgment,

156
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,950
to dominance,
hierarchy,

157
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:14,784
status maneuvering,
and to all the terrible things that the 

158
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:21,690
unknown world can can wreak upon you.
And so then what do you do?

159
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,490
Well,
you create culture,

160
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,533
right?
And that's what this little sentence 

161
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:29,460
says and they sewed fig leaves together 
and made themselves aprons.

162
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,240
That's a pretty eventful sequence all 
crammed up in two little sentences.

163
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:43,040
So then what happens?
I think it's extremely interesting.

164
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,370
So before Adam and eve figure out that 
they're naked,

165
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,323
they're cruising around the garden,
having a fine time doing whatever they 

166
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:50,024
want.
They don't take any thoughts for the 

167
00:10:50,811 --> 00:10:51,770
future.
Right now.

168
00:10:51,771 --> 00:10:52,604
Don't have a prefrontal cortex.
They're living in a in a paradox lists 

169
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,510
environment like an animal lives.
Well,

170
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:02,620
what happens after they become self 
conscious?

171
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,890
Well,
prior to this,

172
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,230
Adam's walking around with God,
right,

173
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,990
and you think about what that means.
It means something like this.

174
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,153
An animal isn't in the world of good and
evil and animal nature points out is 

175
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:16,320
beyond good and evil,
right?

176
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:21,470
Enraptured in entirely by the actions of
automatic instinct governed by processes

177
00:11:22,831 --> 00:11:25,560
that are completely transcendent.
The animals,

178
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,423
nothing but a force of nature.
There no opposition between the animal 

179
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:31,470
in the world.
The animal is the world,

180
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:37,500
and just as in the case of the animal,
prior to the eating of the apple,

181
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,483
Adam walks around the garden with God.
There no discontinuity between him and 

182
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:49,191
the and the transcendent world as such.
But as soon as he becomes naked yards,

183
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,280
well why?
Well that doesn't need to be answered.

184
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:55,114
All you have to do is think about it.
Why would you hide if you know you're 

185
00:11:58,001 --> 00:11:59,920
naked?
It's simple.

186
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,830
You hired because you think you can get 
hurt.

187
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:03,783
You think that whatever you are is so 
vulnerable that if it shows itself to 

188
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:12,220
the transcendent to others,
to the natural world,

189
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,830
that something terrible will happen.
And then you think,

190
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,290
well,
that's a pretty logical presupposition,

191
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,610
right?
Look at us.

192
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,330
So God comes cruising around the garden 
after Adam and Eve,

193
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,193
the apple in the cool of the day,
and Adam and Eve hide themselves among 

194
00:12:33,781 --> 00:12:36,540
the trees of the garden.
And God says to Adam,

195
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,750
Hey,
where are you?

196
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,170
And Adam says,
I heard your voice.

197
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,920
And I was afraid because I was naked and
I hid myself.

198
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:47,963
And that story has bottomless depth 
because it means something like this at 

199
00:12:54,301 --> 00:12:55,134
the beginning of genesis,
there's this notion that there is a 

200
00:12:57,181 --> 00:13:00,060
transcendent relationship between the 
individual and God,

201
00:13:00,061 --> 00:13:00,894
right?
The identity of logo send the 

202
00:13:02,461 --> 00:13:04,130
individual,
right?

203
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:04,973
I know it shouldn't by the way,
that our entire idea of intrinsic human 

204
00:13:08,731 --> 00:13:11,040
right,
it's predicated on is we've been at some

205
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:16,041
pains to demonstrate a relationship 
between the limited and the limitless,

206
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,820
eradicated by the dawn of self 
consciousness.

207
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,840
What does that mean?
Well,

208
00:13:21,841 --> 00:13:25,080
let's say you have a destiny just for 
the sake of argument,

209
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:25,650
right?

210
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,483
Because you are a being with a 
tremendous history and an unbelievable 

211
00:13:29,881 --> 00:13:32,220
potential.
So let's say you have a destiny just for

212
00:13:32,221 --> 00:13:33,054
the sake of argument.
What would cause you to hide from that 

213
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:38,280
destiny?
Well,

214
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,173
obviously
your own reflections on your mortal 

215
00:13:42,751 --> 00:13:43,710
vulnerability,
right?

216
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:44,663
How could I be characterized by any 
transcendent power whatsoever when I'm 

217
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,570
susceptible to social alienation,
right?

218
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,583
When I have this body which is capable 
of terrifying degeneration that will 

219
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:04,470
eventually decay into old age and that 
is bounded by death.

220
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,513
How could I be good for anything which 
is precisely what this little story 

221
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:14,190
says,
and so God figures out that Adam and eve

222
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,450
ate the fruit and that's pretty decisive
move because once you wake up,

223
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,070
sorry,
you're awake,

224
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:23,070
and he says,
and this is not an injunction,

225
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,080
by the way,
this is a description.

226
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,860
All right,
you've done it now unto the woman.

227
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:29,694
He says,
I will greatly multiply the Isaura Nih 

228
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:34,290
conception in sorrow shall bring forth 
children.

229
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,420
Why?
Why?

230
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,750
Well,
we have a big CORTEX,

231
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,700
right?
Really big.

232
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,010
It grew fast,
and what that meant is that there was an

233
00:14:44,011 --> 00:14:47,610
evolutionary arms race between skull 
size,

234
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,370
date of birth,

235
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:56,250
and pelvic diameter girth.
The wider the pelvis,

236
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,540
the less effectively you can walk a 
larger the skull.

237
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,300
The bigger the brain,
the younger the baby,

238
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,090
the more dependent and vulnerable.
So what do we have?

239
00:15:06,091 --> 00:15:06,924
In the case of human beings,
the female human pelvis has already 

240
00:15:10,441 --> 00:15:13,140
stretched to the limits of its 
structural capacity.

241
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,123
So the hole in its center is as big as 
it can get without compromising the 

242
00:15:17,941 --> 00:15:22,320
structural integrity of the pelvis while
still allowing women to walk and run.

243
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,470
So how have babies adapted to that?
Oh,

244
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,313
that's simple.
A mammal of our size should have a 

245
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,094
gestation period of two years.
We have a gestation period of nine 

246
00:15:31,651 --> 00:15:32,484
months.
Why you got to get the damn baby out 

247
00:15:34,381 --> 00:15:36,810
before it's head gets too big?
What does that mean?

248
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,460
Well,
it means it's vulnerable,

249
00:15:38,461 --> 00:15:39,294
right?
Nothing more vulnerable than a baby 

250
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:42,960
human being except maybe a baby kitten 
room.

251
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:43,823
Right?
But it's got a pouch to hide in at 

252
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,190
least.
So we're born vulnerable,

253
00:15:47,191 --> 00:15:51,240
right characteristic of the birth of the
hero who suffers in childbirth.

254
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,620
Women.
Why?

255
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:53,821
Baby?
Skulls?

256
00:15:53,821 --> 00:15:54,654
Just a little bit too big,
has to be crunched and compacted during 

257
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:58,524
birth,
right?

258
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,393
The skull bones aren't joined together 
so that the baby's head can be squashed 

259
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,190
and visibly deformed during the process 
of birth.

260
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,203
Prior to the 20th century,
what was the death rate among women 

261
00:16:08,611 --> 00:16:10,290
giving birth?
One in three,

262
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,390
one in five.
Terrible.

263
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,283
Why?
That's the price you pay for 

264
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,720
consciousness

265
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,190
and I desire shall be to thy husband and
he shall rule over thee.

266
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:24,100
This is not an injunction.
This is a description.

267
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:31,350
The additional burden that dependent 
offspring place on women place them at a

268
00:16:31,351 --> 00:16:32,184
disadvantage.
What's the consequence of that from a 

269
00:16:33,721 --> 00:16:35,310
historical perspective?
Well,

270
00:16:35,311 --> 00:16:38,130
any feminist can answer that question 
right

271
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,510
and unto Adam,
he said,

272
00:16:41,511 --> 00:16:46,310
because you listened to your wife and 
have eaten the tree of which I commanded

273
00:16:46,311 --> 00:16:46,761
thee,
saying,

274
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:47,594
don't eat that cursed is the ground for 
the sake in sorrow shall thou eat of it 

275
00:16:50,781 --> 00:16:53,390
for all the days of thy life.
Fair enough,

276
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:55,400
right?
Once you're self conscious,

277
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,780
you work.
Why?

278
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,010
Well,
animals don't work.

279
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,450
Why do people work?
Well?

280
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:00,950
Because we know,
right?

281
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:03,590
We know that if it isn't gonna happen 
today,

282
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,110
it's going to happen tomorrow and if it 
isn't going to happen tomorrow,

283
00:17:06,111 --> 00:17:08,270
what's going to happen next week or the 
week after?

284
00:17:08,271 --> 00:17:09,770
The month,
after the year after,

285
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:13,190
and we bloody well better prepare.
So that's what we do.

286
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,640
Constantly prepare and prepare and 
prepare.

287
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,503
So we're not bounded and motivated by 
what's happening from second to second 

288
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,990
like the animal is in.
It's still paradisical state.

289
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:28,430
We're constantly tormented by an endless
string of what if questions,

290
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,443
because when we look at the unknown,
we can see the possibility for 

291
00:17:32,631 --> 00:17:36,160
everything including our own punishment 
or own tournament,

292
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,213
our own demise,
and so we're motivated like no other 

293
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:40,424
animal to work and so we work,
but that is another aspect that 

294
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:45,400
alienates us from paradise,
wellbeing,

295
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:49,100
being
thorns and thistles shall it bring forth

296
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,840
for the analysis.

297
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,673
You'll eat the herb of the field in the 
sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread 

298
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:58,110
til thou return unto the ground for Dust
Thou art and unto dust shall thou return

299
00:17:58,770 --> 00:17:59,603
right?
Therefore the Lord God sent him forth 

300
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:04,680
from the garden of Eden to till the 
ground from whence he was taken.

301
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:09,210
So we drove out the man and he placed at
the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims

302
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:13,980
and a flaming sword which turned every 
way to keep the way of the tree of life.

303
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,990
Adam and Eve,
right?

304
00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:25,740
The mother and father of all humanity.
So you can give them a mythological slot

305
00:18:25,741 --> 00:18:26,574
and you can say Adam is culture.
Say and Eve is nature because they're 

306
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:30,863
the archetipal parents.
It's a perfectly reasonable 

307
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:35,460
interpretation.
They have twin sons,

308
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:40,320
Cain and Abel,
so let's read first born creatures,

309
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,183
firstborn,
human creatures in the new self 

310
00:18:42,951 --> 00:18:46,620
conscious world,
so what are the first two individuals in

311
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:50,460
the new self conscious world like and 
let's find out,

312
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,660
and Adam knew,
eve,

313
00:18:51,661 --> 00:18:54,510
his wife and she conceived and Bare Cain
and said,

314
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,540
I have gotten a man from the Lord,
and again,

315
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,374
she bare his brother Abel,
the younger brother and Abel was a 

316
00:19:01,111 --> 00:19:01,944
keeper of sheep,
but Cain was a tiller of the ground and 

317
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,753
in the process of time it came to pass 
that cain brought of the fruit of the 

318
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:09,630
ground and offering unto the Lord.

319
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,990
Okay,
so we're going to remove this from its

320
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,713
history,
from its entrapment in a particular 

321
00:19:17,221 --> 00:19:21,090
temporal domain and within attempt or 
culture when to say something like this.

322
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,100
Well,
if you work,

323
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,020
you make sacrifices,
right?

324
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,123
That's what works all about and the 
reason you make sacrifices is because 

325
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,363
you're offering up to the unknown,
the fruits of your labor in the hope 

326
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,100
that as a consequence of your diligence 
effort,

327
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,750
you're going to be favored,
right?

328
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:37,584
Because otherwise,
why were the point of working is to 

329
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:42,090
transform the transcendent into 
something benevolent,

330
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,130
so your work and your work and you work 
and you say,

331
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,233
is that sufficient?
And the answer you get from the 

332
00:19:46,981 --> 00:19:50,160
transcendent is the answer.
Now,

333
00:19:50,161 --> 00:19:53,730
it's certainly true that lots of people 
work and doesn't go all that well,

334
00:19:53,731 --> 00:19:54,564
right?
They make sacrifices and they do what 

335
00:19:56,971 --> 00:20:00,510
they think they have to do and their 
life is one string of catastrophes after

336
00:20:00,511 --> 00:20:01,170
another.

337
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:03,870
Right?
So we have this situation in the process

338
00:20:03,871 --> 00:20:06,060
of time,
it came to pass that cain brought of the

339
00:20:06,061 --> 00:20:09,420
fruit of the ground and offering unto 
the Lord and Abel.

340
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,560
He also brought of the firstlings of his
flock and of the fat thereof.

341
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:16,680
And the Lord had respect unto Abel and 
his offering.

342
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,690
So what that means is that,
oh,

343
00:20:18,691 --> 00:20:21,690
they able working away.
Damn things are going great for him,

344
00:20:21,691 --> 00:20:23,130
right?
Fortune smiles on him.

345
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,240
He's doing wonderfully.
He's got everything he needs.

346
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,133
Well old cane.
He's scrounging away in the ground and 

347
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,860
things aren't going as well for him at 
all.

348
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:33,300
Right?
Plagues locusts.

349
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:35,730
You name it.
Farm life isn't going well.

350
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,480
So what happens?
Well,

351
00:20:39,481 --> 00:20:44,481
Cain was very wroth and his countenance 
fell precisely right,

352
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:49,550
because if you work diligently towards a
certain end and you don't get there,

353
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,600
then your current spouse falls,
right?

354
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:53,800
You're angry,
frustrated,

355
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:54,760
disappointed,
hurt,

356
00:20:54,761 --> 00:20:55,870
anxious,
threatened,

357
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,040
ashamed,
guilty.

358
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,690
The whole panoply of negative emotions,
and that's fair enough because of course

359
00:21:01,691 --> 00:21:02,524
if you fail,
that's what's going to be the 

360
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:04,504
consequences.
But then there's this little twist on 

361
00:21:05,861 --> 00:21:06,161
it,
right?

362
00:21:06,161 --> 00:21:06,994
This specifically human twists,
but it's like that kind of moral of the 

363
00:21:10,331 --> 00:21:11,920
whole story.
And so you find

364
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,380
the Lord saying,
oh well,

365
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,221
you know,
what's,

366
00:21:15,221 --> 00:21:18,130
what's up with you?
Why are you so unhappy?

367
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:23,320
If you just got your act together,
then you'd be accepted.

368
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,290
If you really got your act together,
which is a statement,

369
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,124
something like this.
If you keep making sacrifices and the 

370
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:31,294
same terrible thing keeps happening,
there's always the possibility that 

371
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,200
you're just actually not doing it the 
right way.

372
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,390
And if you just get yourself 
straightened up,

373
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,680
tap together,
right?

374
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:42,514
And drop the preconceptions that you 
don't really need an adjust your 

375
00:21:45,491 --> 00:21:48,460
behavior accordingly.
Then fortune would smile on you.

376
00:21:48,461 --> 00:21:50,950
And that's exactly what the Lord says to
Cain,

377
00:21:50,951 --> 00:21:54,130
right?
You don't walk around with such a crabby

378
00:21:54,131 --> 00:21:56,020
look on your face.
If you did well,

379
00:21:56,021 --> 00:21:58,240
you'll be accepted.
And if you don't do well,

380
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,060
sin lies at the door.
So what does that mean?

381
00:22:01,061 --> 00:22:01,894
Well,
this is a deep motif in ancient Hebrew 

382
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:05,434
thinking.
If the world isn't laying itself out in 

383
00:22:08,551 --> 00:22:12,000
a manner that you find acceptable,
you're faced with a tough choice.

384
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,960
Either the world is a terrible place 
bent on destruction,

385
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,033
or you're doing something wrong and it 
bloody well better be that you're doing 

386
00:22:21,181 --> 00:22:23,730
something wrong.
Because if the world is a terrible place

387
00:22:23,731 --> 00:22:27,390
bent on destruction,
you've got absolutely no hope.

388
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,180
And cain talked with Abel,
his brother,

389
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,163
and it came to pass when they were in 
the field that Cain rose up against 

390
00:22:37,261 --> 00:22:38,940
Abel,
his brother and killed him.

391
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:41,220
So what does that mean?
Well,

392
00:22:41,221 --> 00:22:43,140
it's pretty easy.
It's simple.

393
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,530
It means this will say things aren't 
going that well for you.

394
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:47,603
And it's really not because life's 
unfair and everything stacked against 

395
00:22:51,301 --> 00:22:53,580
you.
It's because you're kind of a arrogant,

396
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:56,010
stubborn,
totalitarian,

397
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:59,760
cowardly idiot.
And as a consequence of that,

398
00:22:59,761 --> 00:23:00,594
the world is turning into something 
resembling a wasteland around you and 

399
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:08,060
you have this option change
or continue,

400
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,470
or you have another option,
man,

401
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:14,350
look around.
There's all those people doing well.

402
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,350
The world's a terrible place bent on my 
destruction.

403
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,020
Wouldn't it be just the most interesting
thing?

404
00:23:20,021 --> 00:23:25,021
If as things are going to hell for me,
I could take along just for the ride.

405
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,133
Some of those successful people who are 
successful just for unfair reasons 

406
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,930
anyways.
Right?

407
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:36,340
So instead of using all that negative 
emotion has a cue that there's something

408
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:38,440
about me that might need to be 
transformed.

409
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,700
I can say,
well,

410
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:45,650
why not just eradicate the target of my 
resentment?

411
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,513
Right?
Not only because that sort of removes 

412
00:23:47,811 --> 00:23:50,900
the problem of comparison,
but more profoundly.

413
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,520
And I think sort of,
again,

414
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:53,863
eliminate Leslie profoundly,
but say you made the decision that the 

415
00:23:56,781 --> 00:24:00,050
world's a terrible place and it's based 
on your destruction.

416
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,071
And then you think,
well,

417
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:04,730
what's the logical response to that?
And then you think something like this

418
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,820
Girtha,
fouse,

419
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,913
Mephistopheles Credo,
the spirit I that endlessly denies and 

420
00:24:21,741 --> 00:24:23,690
rightly to,
for all of it,

421
00:24:23,691 --> 00:24:24,524
comes to birth,
is fit for overthrow as nothing worth 

422
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:32,180
wherefore for the world.
We're better sterilized.

423
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,200
That's all the tear is evil,
recognized is gained to me and downfall,

424
00:24:38,391 --> 00:24:41,810
rune and sin.
The very element I prosper in

425
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:43,683
and

426
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:47,130
draws our attention to this credo.
Not once,

427
00:24:47,131 --> 00:24:52,131
but twice in his writing a file.
Austin has mephistopheles say right once

428
00:24:52,921 --> 00:24:55,620
again,
gone to share,

429
00:24:55,621 --> 00:25:00,621
nothing passed with no made one.
What matters are creative,

430
00:25:00,631 --> 00:25:03,270
endless toil.
When out of snatch oblivion ends,

431
00:25:03,271 --> 00:25:05,340
the coil,
it is by gone.

432
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,990
How shall this riddle run?
As good as if things never had begun yet

433
00:25:09,991 --> 00:25:14,340
circle back existence to possess.
I'd rather have eternal emptiness.

434
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,880
And so then you think about cane,
like figures like Stella and you think,

435
00:25:20,581 --> 00:25:22,890
well,
what exactly was he motivated by?

436
00:25:22,891 --> 00:25:24,270
And on the one hand you think,
well,

437
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,060
he was trying to extend his cultural 
dominion right?

438
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,940
Played by his own self conscious 
neuroticism.

439
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:33,510
He wanted to extend the,
the,

440
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:39,410
the borders of his totalitarian 
certainty to every corner just to not be

441
00:25:40,621 --> 00:25:43,380
plagued by the unknown and you think,
fair enough.

442
00:25:43,381 --> 00:25:44,214
You know,
like we're all pretty nervous and a 

443
00:25:45,331 --> 00:25:46,680
little stability is a good thing.

444
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,753
Why?
Because they make a fundamental 

445
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:52,890
judgment,
which is the judgment of Mephistopheles.

446
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,490
Look,
life is terrible,

447
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,410
terrible,
terrible.

448
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,440
Were self conscious.
We get sick.

449
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:03,360
We go insane.
We're going to die.

450
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:07,140
Children,
innocent children suffer everywhere.

451
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:12,410
How in the world is it right to let such
a state continue?

452
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,543
Maybe it would be better.
All things considered just to bring the 

453
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:18,744
whole game to an end and so then you 
think again with Eliana that the reason 

454
00:26:24,421 --> 00:26:26,970
that humans societies fall apart is 
twofold.

455
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,110
One is things go from bad to worse of 
their own accord,

456
00:26:31,111 --> 00:26:33,090
right?
Thermodynamic reality,

457
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,340
pure entropy,
structured entities decay,

458
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:39,683
but then there's a twist.
Structured entities constructed by are 

459
00:26:44,101 --> 00:26:44,934
sped in their process of decay by the 
participants of the individuals within 

460
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:50,334
that society who have essentially 
decided that the game is not worth the 

461
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:56,364
price and that under such conditions the
only reasonable thing for a self 

462
00:27:01,131 --> 00:27:01,964
conscious,
painfully self conscious individual to 

463
00:27:04,111 --> 00:27:04,944
do is to work as hard as he or she 
possibly can to take the maximum amount 

464
00:27:10,651 --> 00:27:11,484
of revenge on the conditions of 
existence and to ensure that the entire 

465
00:27:14,881 --> 00:27:15,714
game folds up.
The consciousness disappears and that 

466
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,700
being is eradicated.
