00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,250
I'm in the UK at Penguin,
which I'm thrilled about because I think

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,143
penguin is the greatest book publisher 
in the world and and England is the 

3
00:00:09,691 --> 00:00:10,524
center of the English language and 
that's really something because England 

4
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:14,874
has brought a tradition of truth and 
clarity to the world that has 

5
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:24,471
illuminated it in many ways and I'm 
hoping that this book extends that great

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,810
English tradition one step farther,
like a good colonial should.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,273
So that's.
And I hope you read it and I hope that 

8
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:36,684
it helps you sort out your life.
I think people have found the things 

9
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:41,304
that I've said helpful in that regard 
and I've tried to distill them and 

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,170
extend them in this book and deepen 
them.

11
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,220
So hopefully that's what you will find 
when you read it.
