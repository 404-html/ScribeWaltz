Hi everyone.
I'm talking to you today from Melbourne,

2
00:00:10,991 --> 00:00:14,590
Australia,
where it's sunny and warm,

3
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:16,510
much unlike Toronto.

4
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,530
I left there five days ago
and it was blizzardy and cold,

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,600
so it's really nice to see the sun.
I've been here with my wife, Tammy,

6
00:00:25,601 --> 00:00:28,600
and a good curb.
Dainty is the name of the,

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,970
of the crew that I'm traveling with,

8
00:00:30,971 --> 00:00:35,440
a production company and they've been
really good. Um, we've been to Perth,

9
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,230
did two shows there to Adelaide,

10
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:43,570
have a show tonight at Melbourne with
about 5,000 people and Canberra, Sydney,

11
00:00:43,571 --> 00:00:47,350
Brisbane, Auckland,
Christchurch, Wellington,

12
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,310
Auckland again, Sydney,
Melbourne, and Brisbane.

13
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,510
I just wanted to let you know that there
are tickets left to a number of the

14
00:00:55,511 --> 00:00:57,790
shows on Thursday,

15
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:01,780
February 21st at the Michael Follower
Center in Wellington, New Zealand.

16
00:01:01,781 --> 00:01:04,330
There are tickets available on Saturday,

17
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:08,020
February 23rd at the Logan Campbell
Center in Auckland, New Zealand.

18
00:01:08,021 --> 00:01:10,660
There are tickets available Tuesday,

19
00:01:10,661 --> 00:01:13,300
February 26th at the ICC,

20
00:01:13,301 --> 00:01:17,380
Sydney theater at Darling
Harbor on Wednesday,

21
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:22,300
February 27th at the plenary Melbourne
Convention and Exhibition Center in

22
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:25,690
Melbourne, as you might've expected.
There are also tickets available.

23
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:27,010
And then finally,
Thursday,

24
00:01:27,011 --> 00:01:30,880
February 28th at the Brisbane
Convention and Exhibition Center,

25
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:36,030
they can all be found@jordanbpeterson.com
forward slash events.

26
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:40,810
And so many of these shows are selling
out at a relatively rapid rate.

27
00:01:40,811 --> 00:01:45,070
These latter ones were ones
we added because there was
additional popular demand.

28
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,310
So if you do want to see the
12 rules for life lectures,

29
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,300
this would be a good opportunity to do it.
Uh,

30
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,900
thanks to everyone in Australia and New
Zealand so far for making this a very

31
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,300
productive and positive trip.

32
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,480
I hope to see you there to shows
if being very gratifying and um,

33
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,740
useful and productive and
meaningful and positive,

34
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:13,390
all of those things. Uh, there are serious
conversations. Everyone seems to be,

35
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,613
um,

36
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:19,770
I would say engaged by them and focused
and it's altogether a positive thing.

37
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,970
So if you're interested,
the tickets are available and um,

38
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:31,260
I'll put a little bit more information
down at the bottom of the screen on the

39
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,930
description of the video.
So I hope to see you there.

40
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,570
Thanks very much for all the support. It's
much appreciated and quite remarkable.

41
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:42,683
Yeah,

42
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,300
experience. I would say, bye bye.
