1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,590
Okay,

2
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,023
so okay,
so we've talked a little bit about 

3
00:00:14,871 --> 00:00:19,630
motivation last time or quite a bit 
about motivation and what I,

4
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,670
I told you that I was basically teach 
you,

5
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,533
teaching you a personality neuroscience 
approach to personality and part of the 

6
00:00:27,951 --> 00:00:28,784
reason that I have to go into the 
biology to give you is to give you the 

7
00:00:32,451 --> 00:00:35,030
kind of foundation that you need in 
order to understand.

8
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,080
I would say what's essentially the 
cutting edge in personality research.

9
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:43,250
You know,
I mean I know that what we're going,

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,113
what we covered last lecture and what 
we're going to cover today are 

11
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:47,504
relatively complicated,
but if you get them right then you're 

12
00:00:49,731 --> 00:00:51,920
right at the forefront of,
of,

13
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,630
of our ideas about brain function and 
emotion and about personality.

14
00:00:56,631 --> 00:00:57,464
So you get all that at the same time and
today you'll get a little bit of 

15
00:00:59,691 --> 00:01:01,310
learning theory thrown in as well.

16
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,143
So learning learning theory is basically
what used to be what's alternatively 

17
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:08,990
described as behaviorism,
and I don't.

18
00:01:08,991 --> 00:01:11,210
I used to teach behavior is I'm in this 
class,

19
00:01:11,211 --> 00:01:15,080
but I've subsumed it underneath the 
biology because the old.

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,300
A lot of the old behavior 
presuppositions,

21
00:01:17,301 --> 00:01:20,780
although they were extremely useful,
we're not right,

22
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,280
which is exactly what you'd expect.
They were formulated in the 19 fifties,

23
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,363
um,
and it's actually the sign of the 

24
00:01:27,891 --> 00:01:31,250
progress of science that theories that 
are 60 years old or no longer.

25
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:32,810
Right.
So,

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,833
um,
we'll also cover a little bit of 

27
00:01:36,051 --> 00:01:38,330
behavioral theory today too.
So,

28
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:39,523
okay,
so the hypothesis we've been working on 

29
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:43,220
so far,
or we'll call it the working theory,

30
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,503
is that motivations set goals or more 
accurately that they define as a 

31
00:01:49,131 --> 00:01:49,964
conceptual space within which you 
perceive the world and within which you 

32
00:01:53,271 --> 00:01:54,104
act toward some goal and,
or to some endpoint and the endpoint in 

33
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,520
some sense as specified by the 
motivational system.

34
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,370
It's a hypothalamic system,
are often,

35
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:08,030
but not always,
but not only is the goal specified,

36
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:11,570
but they,
the underlying motivational systems also

37
00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:12,404
tune your perception.
So you're only looking at the things 

38
00:02:14,421 --> 00:02:17,120
that you know to be relevant to the 
pursuit of that goal.

39
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,100
And they also either disinhibit or 
activate the behavioral schemes that you

40
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:27,100
would normally use to pursue the goal.
And sometimes those are the,

41
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:28,340
let's say,
the motor schemes,

42
00:02:28,341 --> 00:02:30,950
because that would be more accurate.
When you think about behavior,

43
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:32,930
you tend to think about voluntary 
behavior,

44
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:37,931
but a motivational state will disinhibit
or activate depending on the situation,

45
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,540
autonomic responses.
So for example,

46
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:42,523
when you,
when you were food deprived and you 

47
00:02:44,571 --> 00:02:45,404
start to think about food and start to 
organize your behavior towards food as 

48
00:02:48,981 --> 00:02:50,840
an end and to perceive the world that 
way,

49
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:51,823
your body also prepares for food.
And so the motivational state is an all 

50
00:02:56,091 --> 00:02:58,550
encompassing psychophysiological 
phenomena.

51
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,383
It's not as simple as change behavior,
which was an early be behavioral theory 

52
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:06,760
or as simple as something that's merely 
setting a goal.

53
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:07,594
It's much more complicated than that.
It's useful to think about as we've 

54
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:14,770
already talked about with regards to 
psychodynamic theory.

55
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,520
It's useful to think about a motivated 
state as a micro personality.

56
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,560
It's got one aim in mind fundamentally,
so it's not particularly sophisticated,

57
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,110
but it has all the other elements of a 
personality.

58
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,483
So now,
so motivation establishes the framework 

59
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:33,580
within which goals are pursued and the 
goal itself.

60
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:34,563
And then roughly speaking emotions or at
least many of the emotions track 

61
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:40,654
progress towards goals,
and so they kind of tell you whether 

62
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:43,624
you're on the right track or not.
So that's a reasonable way of 

63
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,273
distinguishing them,
even though there is no single 

64
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:52,780
motivation system or a single emotion 
system.

65
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,560
There's some basic motivations.

66
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,140
Um,
these are the sorts of things that Freud

67
00:03:59,141 --> 00:04:01,520
would have associated fundamentally with
Ed.

68
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,913
So,
and he thought of there's this 

69
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,263
primordial and that's exactly right 
because pretty much all of these 

70
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:07,803
motivational systems we share certainly 
with other people also with other 

71
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:15,550
mammals.
And then of course with animals that are

72
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,250
farther down the evolutionary chain than
mammals.

73
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,620
So some of these systems are 
extraordinarily old.

74
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,613
In fact,
all of them are extraordinarily old 

75
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,210
hunger,
consequence of food deprivation,

76
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:26,044
obviously thirst.
Obviously people are very dependent on 

77
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,870
water.
Pain.

78
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,790
Pain's complicated.
There's,

79
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,350
there's physical pain.
And then there's,

80
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,830
it's mental equivalents and the mental 
equivalent of pain,

81
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,610
our grief,
disappointment,

82
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,370
frustration,
roughly speaking.

83
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,473
And so you can,
the way you can think about that as you 

84
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,573
know,
you saw the picture of the nervous 

85
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:53,194
system that I showed you last time with 
the branches going up into the brain 

86
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:56,944
obviously,
but with all the branches are the roots 

87
00:04:58,451 --> 00:04:59,800
say going down into the body.

88
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,633
So we discussed the central nervous 
system as a sort of all encompassing 

89
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,893
system distributed throughout the body.
Imagine that part of that network 

90
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:13,510
throughout your body is associated with 
pain reception and that would be roughly

91
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:14,703
equivalent to systems registering levels
of input that are high enough to 

92
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:20,254
potentially damage them.
That's where pain seeps seems to come 

93
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:25,300
in.
And that different pieces of that can be

94
00:05:25,301 --> 00:05:29,380
activated at different times.
So if it's psychological pain,

95
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,550
as I said,
grief,

96
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:31,384
frustration,
disappointment seems to fall into that 

97
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:35,800
category.
A loneliness as another one.

98
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,033
Um,
then maybe it's primarily the cortical 

99
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:44,050
circuitry for pain that's activated in.
Although people who are depressed,

100
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:44,884
for example,
or who are grieving often have somatic 

101
00:05:46,811 --> 00:05:47,644
pain as well.
And depression really looks like it's a 

102
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,320
pain state.
Um,

103
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,293
we know loneliness is because if you 
take like little chicks or little 

104
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:59,410
kittens and you make them lonesome and 
they'll cry which is a or,

105
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,720
or,
or peep if their chicks and you can stop

106
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:03,554
them from doing that by using opiates 
and it's not because it stops them from 

107
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:10,520
vocalizing because that would be a 
possibility.

108
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,130
Just get them so stoned on,
you know,

109
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,450
morphine that they can't peep and you 
think,

110
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:15,284
well,
they're now they're not lonesome 

111
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,240
anymore.
So that's,

112
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,403
the experiments have been done carefully
enough to factor out the effect of the 

113
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:23,630
opiates on the vocalization.
So,

114
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,613
and that's also led to some suspicion 
that people who have have had a history 

115
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:31,964
of extraordinarily painful personal 
relationships might be those who are 

116
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:39,620
more prone to opiate use.
And so opiates analgesics are,

117
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,180
they basically dampen out pain and 
frustration and disappointment and grief

118
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,163
and loneliness.
So there's an anger and aggression 

119
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:49,280
system.
It's complicated.

120
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:51,890
There's probably two of them.
One is defensive aggression,

121
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:55,850
that's probably more associated with 
neuroticism technically.

122
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,070
The other is probably predatory 
aggression.

123
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,800
And,
you know,

124
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:03,680
human beings are definitely predators 
square meters and you know,

125
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,180
uh,
our closest relatives,

126
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:06,530
chimpanzees,
for example,

127
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:07,850
they're,
they're pretty good hunters.

128
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,613
They,
they'll,

129
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,663
they'll pack,
gathered together and packs and bring 

130
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:14,360
down 30 lb,
call us monkeys,

131
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:16,700
and the meat is very popular among the 
chimps.

132
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,820
And so predatory aggression seems to be 
a separate circuit.

133
00:07:19,821 --> 00:07:24,680
And as we'll discuss further along,
I think the predatory aggression circuit

134
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:29,330
and the maternal solicitude circuit,
because there's also a care circuit have

135
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,930
evolved to be at opposite ends of the 
same distribution.

136
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:35,960
I think that's the agreeableness 
distribution in the big five.

137
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:39,200
So in one day and there's maternal 
solicitude and the other end,

138
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:43,070
there's predatory aggression and you can
imagine how those things have to inhibit

139
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:44,510
one another.
Um,

140
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,690
because well,
with,

141
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:50,000
with many mammals,
bears for example,

142
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:50,834
the males are so predatory that you have
to keep them away from the cubs because 

143
00:07:53,721 --> 00:07:55,550
they'll kill them.
Human beings,

144
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:59,300
I mean there's some aggression towards 
children,

145
00:07:59,301 --> 00:08:01,880
especially if the children aren't 
biological relatives.

146
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,060
But men are pretty caring for male 
mammals.

147
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,630
And women are actually quite predatory 
for male mammals.

148
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:09,464
So thermal regulation,
your hypothalamus takes care of whether 

149
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:15,320
you're hot or cold,
panic and escape,

150
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,613
that those are circuits that also seemed
to be associated with pain 

151
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:20,474
fundamentally,
although threat can maybe trigger them 

152
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:23,144
as well,
and the panic escape system doesn't 

153
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:29,150
exactly seem to be the same system as 
the anxiety and fear system.

154
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,360
Even though they sound they sound 
roughly equivalent,

155
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:33,194
right?
You might think of panic as just the 

156
00:08:34,461 --> 00:08:38,600
extreme level of fear.
I think fear can trigger panic,

157
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:42,200
but panic seems to be a more primordial 
circuit and if you're panicking,

158
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:47,210
there's an immense impetus to to escape.
So that's a difference.

159
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:50,660
Circuit affiliation to care.
We covered sexual desire,

160
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,943
exploration and play.
Both of those seem to be separate 

161
00:08:54,141 --> 00:08:54,974
circuit.
So Jaak Jaak Panksepp actually wrote a 

162
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:59,490
great book called affective 
neuroscience.

163
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:02,610
By the way,
if any of you are interested in like the

164
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:05,070
psychobiology of behavior and 
motivation,

165
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:05,963
Jaak Panksepp book is one of the best.
We don't have a paper by him in in our 

166
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:11,940
collection,
but he's a very smart guy.

167
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:16,200
He wrote this book called affective 
neuroscience and it's actually given its

168
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:18,660
title and the relative complexity of 
its.

169
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,570
Of its thoughts,
it's actually quite readable even though

170
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:25,060
it's a text is a little more personal 
than your typical text might be.

171
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:30,060
And Panksepp is also very interested in 
a psychodynamic and personality idea.

172
00:09:30,401 --> 00:09:33,390
So he's a very broad thinker.
And so if you're interested in,

173
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:34,920
you know,
uh,

174
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,753
an approach to psychology that sort of 
crosses the threshold from personality 

175
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:43,070
into emotion in biology,
Panksepp as well as grave.

176
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,460
There's a great paper that you're 
reading.

177
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,040
Panksepp's a very,
very good source.

178
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,933
He's a very,
he discovered the play circuit for 

179
00:09:51,301 --> 00:09:52,560
example.
Um,

180
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,790
and he also discovered that rats laugh.
So if you take a rat,

181
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,473
it laughs.
You can't hear it though because it 

182
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:02,903
laughs ultrasonically like a bat.
But if you record the rat giggling and 

183
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:11,730
then slow down the tape,
then you can tell that the rat laughs.

184
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,893
Rats need to play in.
Most mammals need to play in order to 

185
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,640
socialize them.
So,

186
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:20,160
so one of the things you can think about
this when your parents do,

187
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:20,994
and this is probably especially relevant
for the man because one of the things 

188
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:26,580
you might ask is what role do men play 
in the socialization of children?

189
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,413
And one thing that men really do seem to
do with kids is to engage in rough and 

190
00:10:30,691 --> 00:10:31,524
tumble play,
especially once they're a little older 

191
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:36,690
than to say two to five or something.
And kids love that.

192
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:40,840
They absolutely love rough and tumble 
play gets them so excited that you know,

193
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,693
they get out of control fundamentally,
but rough and tumble play is an 

194
00:10:44,371 --> 00:10:45,204
excellent mode of socialization because 
it teaches the child that the 

195
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:53,250
distinction between the aggression and 
too much aggression.

196
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,113
Right?
Because if you're wrestling with the 

197
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,673
kid,
the kid has to keep their behavioral 

198
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,100
output under a fair degree of control to
keep the game going,

199
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,113
to make it rough enough to be exciting 
but not so rough that they get hurt or 

200
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,703
you know,
that they stick their thumb in their 

201
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:11,600
dad's I or something like that.
And you can think of that from a phd and

202
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,453
sense too because it's a game,
but imagine that if you're trying to 

203
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:17,970
figure out how to configure yourself 
around other people,

204
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,210
if you haven't had that rough and tumble
play,

205
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,970
you don't really know where the 
boundaries of your body are,

206
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:24,880
you know,
and,

207
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,713
and you don't know how much you can take
and how much you can be stretched and 

208
00:11:28,441 --> 00:11:29,274
how much you can be thrown around and 
when something actually hurts rather 

209
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:33,930
than this frightening.

210
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,720
And so all of that intense sort of play 
that,

211
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,913
that,
um,

212
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,730
that boys in particular are likely to 
engage it.

213
00:11:40,731 --> 00:11:41,910
No,
the girls also like,

214
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:42,744
it
seems to be very useful for teaching 

215
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:49,280
children about how to engage with the 
world but,

216
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:50,203
and with other people in a physical way.
And that's one of the physiological for 

217
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:57,460
higher order socialization.
So it's very useful.

218
00:11:57,461 --> 00:11:57,761
I mean,
I've,

219
00:11:57,761 --> 00:11:58,594
I've always often noted that children 
who haven't had the opportunity to 

220
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:04,030
engage in physical play,
they're kind of awkward.

221
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:04,820
You know,
they,

222
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,653
they're not,
they're not seated well in their body 

223
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:09,610
and it's like they're kind of vague 
physically.

224
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:12,730
Whereas the ones who've been twisted 
around in Banton,

225
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,370
thrown up in the air and wrestled in 
general,

226
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,343
there are a lot more conscious of their 
limits and their abilities and their 

227
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:24,721
body and they're also much more able to 
invite other kids to play.

228
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,100
You can think about this with regards to
dogs.

229
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:29,290
You know if you have a dog,
you know the dog,

230
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,120
you can tell when the dog wants to play,
right?

231
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,710
What does the dog do?

232
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,560
Yeah.
Jumps around and it puts his rear end in

233
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:41,200
the air often and its head down.
It looks up,

234
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,333
which is a little bit submissive and 
little bit friendly and it wags its 

235
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:46,054
tail.
It might bark and it moves back and 

236
00:12:47,051 --> 00:12:49,810
forth and like little kids that want to 
play do well.

237
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,670
They don't put their tails in the air 
obviously,

238
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:52,780
but they,
they,

239
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:56,110
they,
they engage in play invitation behaviors

240
00:12:56,111 --> 00:12:56,944
like that,
you know,

241
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,083
little bit of teasing sometimes and 
they're trying to get some play 

242
00:13:00,551 --> 00:13:04,360
initiated on.
It's also practice for later dominance.

243
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:09,400
When chimps play the males in particular
as they approach adolescence,

244
00:13:09,401 --> 00:13:11,800
the play behavior because then they'll 
throw sticks.

245
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,910
At the old chimps who were laying down 
and sleeping or come up and poke them or

246
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,073
tease them,
and then as they become more and more 

247
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:22,890
powerful and more and more adolescence 
and into adulthood,

248
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,733
did not play,
will become full blown dominance 

249
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:26,074
challenges as you don't,
no doubt noticed if you were in junior 

250
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:32,080
high school because that's exactly what 
happens to teachers.

251
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,730
Right?
The little elementary school kids,

252
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:35,560
they're kind of cute when they 
misbehave.

253
00:13:35,561 --> 00:13:39,190
They're sort of playful book by the time
grade eight or grade nine comes around.

254
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,383
The pushing on the teacher is a lot 
harder and so you can see how play 

255
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,880
shades into dominance.
Just butte,

256
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,380
but it is a separate circuit exploration
that's a separate circuit and one of the

257
00:13:50,381 --> 00:13:51,214
things that we'll talk about today is 
Swanson's elaboration of the fact that 

258
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,033
half of the hypothalamus is 
fundamentally devoted towards 

259
00:13:58,991 --> 00:14:00,490
exploration,
which is quite cool.

260
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:02,380
It means exploration is a really,
really,

261
00:14:02,381 --> 00:14:03,214
really old system and it's sort of like 
if you haven't got anything else to do 

262
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,290
so you don't want to play.
You're not hungry,

263
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:12,630
you're not thirsty,
you're not angry.

264
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,340
You're not too warm or too cold,
et Cetera,

265
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:16,174
et cetera.
Your default isn't sort of quiescent 

266
00:14:18,781 --> 00:14:19,800
sleep,
right?

267
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,873
You don't just

268
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,890
run out of batteries and lie on the 
floor unless you're of course,

269
00:14:25,891 --> 00:14:27,360
obviously,
unless you're very tired.

270
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,613
What will generally happen is if the 
other fundamental motivational states 

271
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:32,454
have been satiated,
then you'll engage in exploration and 

272
00:14:36,061 --> 00:14:38,280
some different people at different 
rates.

273
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,623
If you're extroverted,
you'll engage in exploration in the 

274
00:14:41,971 --> 00:14:42,804
social environment and if you're open,
then you'll engage in exploration at a 

275
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:47,304
more cognitive level,
so that would be with regards to 

276
00:14:48,871 --> 00:14:49,704
artistic creativity or to fiction or or 
the expression of some sort of 

277
00:14:53,181 --> 00:14:57,410
intellectual or philosophical pursuit 
and the reason that you're wired up that

278
00:14:57,411 --> 00:15:00,470
way is because if you have a little 
extra energy,

279
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,393
you might as well use that to map out 
more of the environment so that when 

280
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:08,780
push comes to shove somewhere down the 
road,

281
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,423
he'll be in possession of more 
information and more flexible and more 

282
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:16,100
knowledgeable in your.
In your,

283
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,880
in your conceptual and perceptual 
structures and also in your actions.

284
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:23,690
So people have a pretty strong tendency 
to default to exploration,

285
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,190
but there's variability in that.

286
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:31,160
You can also sort of divide up these 
motivations as ingestive or defensive.

287
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:31,994
That's not a bad way of looking at it.
And then there's reproductive 

288
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:39,191
motivations as well.
That's unlikely to be a full map.

289
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:44,420
It kind of depends on where you put the 
emotions because we know for example,

290
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,523
that there's a separate disgust circuit 
and that doesn't seem to load with 

291
00:15:48,621 --> 00:15:50,880
anxiety or with pain.
It's,

292
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:51,714
it's its own biological
system and it seems to be associated 

293
00:15:56,691 --> 00:15:57,524
with trait conscientiousness maybe and 
also with political conservatism in 

294
00:16:01,881 --> 00:16:02,714
orderliness.
So those things are all quite 

295
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:06,290
interesting.
We all kind of clumped together and.

296
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,630
But whether that's an emotion or 
motivations,

297
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,850
not exactly clear,
but

298
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,533
we'll talk about it a little bit more.
So there's the hypothalamus and as you 

299
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:20,030
can see
it's not one thing.

300
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,073
Of course,
nothing at the macro level in the brain 

301
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:23,990
is one thing.

302
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:28,070
Obviously it's this layered thing,
just like everything else in the world,

303
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:28,904
except even more so because the brain is
so incredibly complicated and you can 

304
00:16:31,581 --> 00:16:33,770
see by looking at that there's all those
little,

305
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:38,090
all the things that are colored,
they're basically hypothalamic

306
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,543
modules,
I guess would be a reasonable way of 

307
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:46,280
putting it and you can tell they're even
at an anatomically distinct,

308
00:16:46,281 --> 00:16:49,160
so obviously they're not doing exactly 
the same thing.

309
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:53,630
So you might think of brain anatomy as 
sort of a fixed,

310
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,453
what would you call something that we've
already managed quite well and we have 

311
00:16:57,741 --> 00:16:58,574
all the categories.
Systems down in the structure of the 

312
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:02,870
brain is quite well known and that's 
really not true at all.

313
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:03,973
Like the brain is truly terra incognita 
and it isn't even like our naming a 

314
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:08,923
rituals.
Let's say our conventions are not 

315
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:15,590
necessarily appropriate for one to one 
mapping of say structure onto function.

316
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:18,440
So
they're,

317
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,240
they're,
they're sort of anatomical,

318
00:17:20,241 --> 00:17:23,210
they're markers for anatomical 
convenience in some ways.

319
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,070
Okay,
so,

320
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:25,903
so here's a way of thinking about it.
So you have your frame which specifies 

321
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:33,980
your lack.
Say I'm hungry and then a goal pops up,

322
00:17:33,981 --> 00:17:34,551
which is,
well,

323
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:35,384
I should have something to eat,
and the hypothalamus is modulating 

324
00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:39,254
perceptual and cognitive circuits so 
that you think that and so that you 

325
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:42,944
start to parse up the world into a place
where a hungry person like you could 

326
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,403
become satisfied and then the behaviors 
kick in that are relevant to that 

327
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,660
pursuit and so you can think of yourself
as popping through these sorts of frames

328
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,570
on a fairly sick basis throughout the 
day.

329
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:05,430
You know,
obviously you get hungry,

330
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:07,020
you get thirsty,
you get tired,

331
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,123
and so your consciousness is being 
modulated by subcortical circuitry that 

332
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,573
is basically charged with your self 
preservation and in some ways you come 

333
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:19,980
along for the ride.

334
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,980
I mean your consciousness is mostly 
there in some sense to detect deviations

335
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:28,800
from not so much expectation but from 
desire,

336
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,663
right?
Because you lay out one of these little 

337
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:31,074
maps on the world and then you want 
something to happen and what your 

338
00:18:34,171 --> 00:18:35,004
consciousness does more or less is more 
monitor and if something that you don't 

339
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:45,510
want to happen happens,
then consciousness will take a look.

340
00:18:45,511 --> 00:18:46,344
In some sense,
you remember that hierarchy of goals 

341
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:52,740
that I showed you from motor output up 
to higher order goals,

342
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,440
your consciousness kind of moves up and 
down that thing.

343
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:56,843
If you've made an error trying to figure
out at which level of abstraction that 

344
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:01,284
error should be rectified,
which is sort of what you do when you 

345
00:19:03,631 --> 00:19:04,464
think,
and so that process is going to kick in 

346
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:11,310
whenever you're moving towards your 
desired end and something that you don't

347
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:12,720
want to have happen,
happens,

348
00:19:12,721 --> 00:19:15,840
right?
You usually stop that sort of an anxiety

349
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:17,190
response,
the stopping,

350
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:21,390
and then if nothing else happens,
that's too bad,

351
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:23,660
well then you'll.
You'll start to explore it in.

352
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,533
Animals often do that by moving around,
but people will do that just as with 

353
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,813
equal facility just by running 
simulations in their mind and trying to 

354
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,770
calculate what went wrong.
Right?

355
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,560
Trying to think about it.
That's a form of exploratory behavior as

356
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:38,394
well.
That would be more associated with 

357
00:19:39,451 --> 00:19:41,350
trait.
Openness with intelligence.

358
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,873
So,

359
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:47,403
so there's how Swanson divides up the 
hypothalamus see the little pink things 

360
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:57,640
there on the left are part of the 
defensive circuits,

361
00:19:57,641 --> 00:19:58,474
and then the red things on the left are 
part of the reproductive circuits and 

362
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,970
you know,
obviously those,

363
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:09,310
the fact that those circuits exist lays 
onto Darwinian theory quite nicely.

364
00:20:09,431 --> 00:20:10,264
The defensive circuits obviously protect
you from dying in the reproductive 

365
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,230
circuits,
you know,

366
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,860
facilitate your reproduction,
just not much of a

367
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,800
fairly obvious conclusion.

368
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,680
And so those are all located in this,
in this essential part of the brain,

369
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,873
the hypothalamic hypothalamus.
Now this is something that's a little 

370
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:34,754
more complex,
so I'll go through it a little bit more 

371
00:20:36,051 --> 00:20:37,690
carefully.
So if you right,

372
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:38,943
this is where Swanson maps perfectly 
onto piaget and I put this one on paper 

373
00:20:46,391 --> 00:20:50,200
in as a optional reading,
but if you're interested in the sorts of

374
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:51,034
things that we're covering this class,
how it's a great paper to hack your way 

375
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:54,334
through,
even though it's very hard because you 

376
00:20:57,071 --> 00:20:57,904
learn a lot about the underlying biology
of some of these more complex clinical 

377
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:05,110
and developmental theories that we've 
covered.

378
00:21:05,111 --> 00:21:10,111
So basically what Swanson is pointing 
out is that at the lowest level,

379
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:14,650
at the highest resolution level of your 
central nervous system,

380
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,060
your,
your,

381
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,283
you have motor output circuits that are 
enabling you to move and those are 

382
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,210
communicating in large part with your 
spine,

383
00:21:25,211 --> 00:21:27,600
but also with lower parts of your 
brainstem.

384
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:31,900
So those are fundamental movements of 
the sorts that PSJ would call reflexive.

385
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:35,470
And then the locomotor pattern 
generator.

386
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,483
I think the best way to think about this
from an analogical perspective and how 

387
00:21:39,371 --> 00:21:42,730
actually Alexander Luria used this 
analogy.

388
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:46,960
He called behavioral patterns.
Kinetic melodies.

389
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,580
It's a lovely phrase,
hey,

390
00:21:48,581 --> 00:21:49,414
because you know how obviously a song is
made out of notes and then the notes 

391
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:55,720
combined into phrases and the phrase 
this combined Santa passages and then,

392
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:56,863
well,
even more interestingly than if it's an 

393
00:21:58,421 --> 00:21:59,254
orchestral piece of music,
multiple instruments are playing at the 

394
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:02,464
same time.
So it sort of extends right into the 

395
00:22:03,911 --> 00:22:07,120
social domain.
But your actions are sort of like that.

396
00:22:07,121 --> 00:22:07,954
They're made out of micro routines and 
then those are chained together and 

397
00:22:10,571 --> 00:22:13,840
those are chained together in higher 
order abstractions and so on.

398
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,913
All the way up to the cortex and so he
swanson points out that the the motor 

399
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:28,711
system has three sets of inputs,
so the cognitive system that sort of way

400
00:22:30,161 --> 00:22:33,430
up that sort of level of abstraction 
that's way up in the brain.

401
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:37,180
So the cognitive system is where you 
know you might do a voluntary auction,

402
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:38,014
so you look at something and say,
well I'm going to pick up this piece of 

403
00:22:39,581 --> 00:22:40,414
paper.
And so that's top down cortical control 

404
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:47,290
and then the state system input to the 
motor system.

405
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:52,530
The state system is your body monitoring
what's going on inside of itself and the

406
00:22:53,201 --> 00:22:56,080
autonomic nervous system is part of the 
motor output system.

407
00:22:56,081 --> 00:23:00,940
And so the state monitoring system takes
a careful look and the hypothalamus does

408
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:01,774
a fair bit of this.
Takes a careful look at what's going on 

409
00:23:03,431 --> 00:23:04,264
inside you and then activates different 
parts of your digestive and you know 

410
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:12,130
that the gut system fundamentally that,
that you have no conscious control over.

411
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:15,670
And then obviously their sensory system 
inputs to.

412
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:16,893
So.
So those are the three main inputs into 

413
00:23:19,121 --> 00:23:19,954
the,
into the motor system and that acts on 

414
00:23:21,731 --> 00:23:22,564
the environment.

415
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,583
And then the motor system has this 
hierarchical nature that's built from 

416
00:23:27,251 --> 00:23:28,084
the spine upwards and so you can think 
of like the brain as a collection of 

417
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:33,903
ever expanding control systems that 
allow you to what learn and undertake 

418
00:23:40,811 --> 00:23:43,330
evermore complex motor schemes of 
action.

419
00:23:43,331 --> 00:23:44,164
You know,
and one of the things that people think 

420
00:23:45,381 --> 00:23:48,140
about human beings is that we're very 
good at thinking,

421
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,363
right?
What we're not good at thinking like 

422
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,203
we're crazy,
crazily adaptable in terms of our motor 

423
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:56,414
output.
I mean if you watch the watch the 

424
00:23:57,921 --> 00:23:58,754
Olympics,
you know when you see human beings can 

425
00:24:01,581 --> 00:24:04,520
do things that no other animal could 
even think of doing.

426
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:05,354
I mean we're completely crazy when it 
comes to the sorts of things we can do 

427
00:24:07,851 --> 00:24:10,100
with our body.
We're good on ice,

428
00:24:10,101 --> 00:24:12,230
we're good in the water.
We can ski.

429
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:15,260
People are really good at jumping.
They can climb across buildings.

430
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,693
People who train themselves can climb 
like mad mean human beings are 

431
00:24:19,731 --> 00:24:22,340
unbelievably variable in terms of their 
motor output.

432
00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:25,640
So that's another part of our 
intelligence that's not just abstract.

433
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:26,953
And so in part that's because we have 
this very well developed cortical area 

434
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:31,814
that enables us to chain evermore 
complex patterns of behavior together 

435
00:24:36,111 --> 00:24:36,944
and also to develop patterns of behavior
that are sort of outside instinctual 

436
00:24:40,821 --> 00:24:44,090
specification.
So you imagine with an animal that has a

437
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,343
less complex brain,
a lot of its behavior is going to be 

438
00:24:48,651 --> 00:24:49,484
limited to those quads,
a instinctual patterns of behavior that 

439
00:24:52,761 --> 00:24:57,500
are devoted directly towards the 
solution of basic biological problems.

440
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,903
But you know,
we can kind of solve those without too 

441
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,124
much effort.
And then we have all the spare motor 

442
00:25:02,241 --> 00:25:04,910
capacity leftover and people do the 
weirdest things with it,

443
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,060
you know,
and,

444
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:10,490
and really remarkable.
Absolutely remarkable things.

445
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,330
So that's pretty cool.
We're pretty cool that way.

446
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,170
We don't get enough credit for it,
I don't think because human beings think

447
00:25:18,171 --> 00:25:19,880
about human being as an animal,
which,

448
00:25:19,881 --> 00:25:21,290
you know,
people are kind of loath to do.

449
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,990
We are definitely the most interesting 
animal.

450
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:29,260
I mean if you saw like a what a pygmy 
hippopotamus skateboarding,

451
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,250
you'd think that was pretty remarkable,
you know,

452
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,323
but people,
they do those sorts of things all the 

453
00:25:33,561 --> 00:25:35,060
time.
And you know,

454
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:40,070
we just take it as a matter of course,
the lowest amount of motor neuron pools,

455
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:41,840
the lowest level of the locomotor 
system,

456
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:47,170
it's locomotion and an action is formed 
by a subset of motoneuron tools.

457
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:53,480
That's wrong motor neurons in the spinal
cord,

458
00:25:53,481 --> 00:25:54,314
ventral horn that innovates the limb 
muscles responsible for locomotor 

459
00:25:57,351 --> 00:25:58,184
behavior.
I dictated this with dragon dictate and 

460
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,410
now then it does weird thing say so 
tools,

461
00:26:03,411 --> 00:26:04,850
God only knows where that came from.

462
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:09,560
So a set of motor neurons in the spinal 
cord,

463
00:26:09,561 --> 00:26:10,394
ventral horn.
So it's way down in the spine that 

464
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:15,410
innovate the law must limb muscles 
responsible for locomotor behavior.

465
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:18,980
When you start to think about the brain 
as something that moves your body,

466
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:19,963
it's a lot easier to conceptualize.
The is something that's distributed 

467
00:26:22,371 --> 00:26:25,910
through the body and your spine is 
actually quite smart.

468
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,640
So even though in some sense you don't 
think with it,

469
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,230
it's capable of very complex sensory 
detection and also motor mapping.

470
00:26:33,231 --> 00:26:34,064
And so I'm mostly relatively automated 
and relatively reflexive one level up 

471
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,850
the existence of a spinal locomotor 
pattern generator.

472
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,833
So this shows that the spine isn't 
responsible just for the most basic of 

473
00:26:48,961 --> 00:26:52,020
motor outputs or sensory inputs,
it can actually generate patterns,

474
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,093
is demonstrated by the fact that whereas
a spinal animal displays no spontaneous 

475
00:26:57,781 --> 00:27:02,250
locomotor activity.
So if you sever an animal,

476
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,380
it's nervous system.

477
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,260
So it only has the spine,
it'll just lay there,

478
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,000
you know,
you'd think it's paralyzed,

479
00:27:09,001 --> 00:27:13,230
that's what you would think.
But coordinated limb movements,

480
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:14,064
characteristic of locomotion may be 
elicited when the limbs of such an 

481
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:18,084
animal are placed on a moving treadmill 
that's providing sematic sensory input 

482
00:27:21,451 --> 00:27:24,510
to the pattern generator.
And so they've done this with people who

483
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:27,330
are paraplegic.
If you take someone who's paraplegic and

484
00:27:27,331 --> 00:27:28,164
so they can't obviously walk and you 
hoist them up and you put them on a 

485
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:33,563
treadmill and you lean them forward,
their legs will walk and that spinal 

486
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:37,824
controlled.
So that's what you're doing with your 

487
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:40,824
spine,
you know,

488
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,420
because you're not thinking when you 
walk,

489
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:44,640
you're or you're not thinking about 
walking and less,

490
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,830
you know,
less.

491
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,590
You're one of those people who can't 
chew gum and walk at the same time.

492
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:50,843
So anyway.
So it just shows you how complex you 

493
00:27:54,151 --> 00:27:54,984
are,
even at the sort of the base levels of 

494
00:27:57,541 --> 00:27:59,970
your,
of your intelligence hierarchy,

495
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:03,090
level up,
locomotor pattern controller.

496
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,240
So it's controlling the
locomotor pattern generator

497
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:10,973
in contrast,
undisturbed chronic hypothalamic 

498
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,131
animals.
Okay.

499
00:28:14,131 --> 00:28:14,964
So now one of the ways people figured 
out how the brain works was by 

500
00:28:17,491 --> 00:28:18,324
sectioning animals,
nervous systems when they alive at 

501
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:21,324
different levels of complexity.
So a spinal animal is one that's 

502
00:28:23,761 --> 00:28:26,760
basically paralyzed.
It's brain is separated from it's spinal

503
00:28:26,761 --> 00:28:27,594
cord,
but then you can separate the 

504
00:28:28,381 --> 00:28:31,440
hypothalamus with the intact spinal 
cord.

505
00:28:31,441 --> 00:28:32,274
So it's one unit from the cortex and 
even from the memory systems and even 

506
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:36,654
for most of the emotion systems.
And so the animal in some sense hardly 

507
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:41,460
has a brain at all,
you know,

508
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,323
I mean the hypothalamus is,
you saw it's a little tiny thing and 

509
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,083
everything that's on top of that can be 
separated from it and the animal can 

510
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:53,850
still act spontaneously.
So.

511
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:54,923
So here's an example if,
if this has been done with cat and if 

512
00:28:58,141 --> 00:29:03,141
you have a female cat and it's in a cage
and it's only a hypothalami animal,

513
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,373
it can basically manage like,
it can't learn new things very well and 

514
00:29:08,191 --> 00:29:13,191
it can't remember anything,
like it doesn't have episodic memory and

515
00:29:13,531 --> 00:29:14,550
so,
but it can,

516
00:29:14,551 --> 00:29:16,920
it can maintain its temperature,
it can eat,

517
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,200
it can engage in sexual activity.

518
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,030
It's got defensive aggression,
like most of the animal in some sense is

519
00:29:23,031 --> 00:29:26,460
still there from an,
from an input output perspective.

520
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,340
Um,
it's also hyper exploratory,

521
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,100
which is quite interesting because you 
wouldn't think,

522
00:29:32,101 --> 00:29:32,934
well,
animal with no brain is the most 

523
00:29:34,351 --> 00:29:37,320
exploratory kind of animal.
Well,

524
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,930
it happens to be the case as long as it 
has the hypothalamus.

525
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,850
So that shows you a how old exploration 
is,

526
00:29:42,851 --> 00:29:43,684
but it also kind of gives you some clue 
about what the rest of the brain is 

527
00:29:45,611 --> 00:29:48,580
doing mean
you,

528
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,160
you explored new things,
we'll say.

529
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,563
So what that means is you have to be 
able to tell the difference between 

530
00:29:54,131 --> 00:29:54,964
what's new and what isn't.
And so what you need to tell the 

531
00:29:57,311 --> 00:30:02,260
difference between what's new and what 
isn't is memory and so a lot of what the

532
00:30:02,261 --> 00:30:03,094
higher order parts of the brain are 
doing is basically keeping track of 

533
00:30:05,861 --> 00:30:06,850
where you've been.

534
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,343
And so if you've been somewhere before 
then the exploratory circuit is 

535
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:12,214
basically shut off as long as everything
that you're doing there is working and 

536
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:20,560
you need the whole brain basically to 
shut off the hypothalamus in some sense.

537
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:21,394
That's how the thing works.
It's like you're kind of a default on 

538
00:30:24,371 --> 00:30:25,510
system,
you know,

539
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,523
your,
your motor systems are ready to go and 

540
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:30,280
you're Kinda,
you're alive and you're ready to go like

541
00:30:30,281 --> 00:30:31,114
a wild animal.
But the cortex dampens that down and it 

542
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:34,384
does that by only allowing the 
activities that are relevant to that 

543
00:30:37,901 --> 00:30:38,734
area.
That might be none of them to function 

544
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:41,374
at any one time.
So you take off the cortex while the 

545
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:46,300
animal can still do a lot of things.
But you know,

546
00:30:46,301 --> 00:30:47,134
its ability to match its behavior to 
novel situations and to learn new 

547
00:30:50,351 --> 00:30:51,820
behaviors is very,
very limited.

548
00:30:51,821 --> 00:30:52,654
So it,
it becomes hyper exploratory but it 

549
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:56,140
can't remember anything.

550
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:59,800
And it becomes very limited in the 
flexibility of its behavior,

551
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:05,040
and so as you move farther up the 
hierarchy of complexity,

552
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,910
then you're able to do more and more 
novel and more and more complex and more

553
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:10,744
and more situation specific things.
So in the sense of providing a certain 

554
00:31:17,021 --> 00:31:20,770
level of endogenous activity,
which means self-generated activity.

555
00:31:20,771 --> 00:31:25,450
So the hypothalamic thalamic animal will
move by itself without being stimulated.

556
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:26,863
The hypothalamic locomotor region can be
thought of as a locomotor pattern 

557
00:31:30,281 --> 00:31:31,114
controller,
which generates spontaneous inputs 

558
00:31:33,071 --> 00:31:36,100
ultimately to the spinal locomotor 
pattern generator.

559
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:36,963
So this.
There's hierarchy already talked about 

560
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,564
behavioral state inputs.
There's another picture of the nervous 

561
00:31:42,521 --> 00:31:44,440
system just to remind you of how it 
looks.

562
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:49,270
Now it's distributed through the body.
Oh,

563
00:31:49,271 --> 00:31:50,104
this is very interesting too.
I didn't learn this until I read this 

564
00:31:53,591 --> 00:31:55,570
paper by Swanson.
I thought,

565
00:31:55,571 --> 00:31:57,460
that's so dumb.
How could I have not learned that?

566
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,610
Like 30 years ago,
Swanson said that.

567
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,660
Let's go back.
One did.

568
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,290
Yeah.
Raymond.

569
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:07,150
Kal was like the world's greatest 
neuroanatomist.

570
00:32:07,151 --> 00:32:09,530
He was the guy who really established 
the field,

571
00:32:09,531 --> 00:32:12,880
so did a tremendous amount of 
investigation into the fine structure of

572
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:15,730
the brain.
Like a 110 years ago,

573
00:32:15,731 --> 00:32:16,564
a long time ago,
and he pointed out that sensory systems 

574
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,510
have a dual projection within the 
central nervous system.

575
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,640
I told you guys about blind sight 
already,

576
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,503
you know,
and the fact that your eyes map onto 

577
00:32:27,401 --> 00:32:28,234
different levels of the hierarchy,
say of sensory input and motor control 

578
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,440
cajal basically outlined the circuitry 
for that one branch goes directly to the

579
00:32:35,441 --> 00:32:37,260
motor system.
So it's.

580
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:41,480
That's for I to output mappings.
So that's fast because there's not a lot

581
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:42,314
of thinking in between.
You might think that's bad because you 

582
00:32:45,321 --> 00:32:47,810
want to think,
but it's good because sometimes you know

583
00:32:47,811 --> 00:32:49,160
what to do and you don't want to thank 
you.

584
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,770
Just want to execute it as fast as you 
possibly can.

585
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:55,010
So these lower orders,
simpler inputs are good for that sort of

586
00:32:55,011 --> 00:32:55,844
thing.
One goes directly to the motor system 

587
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,393
and the other goal is more or less 
directly to the cerebral cortex where 

588
00:33:00,861 --> 00:33:01,694
sensations and perceptions are 
elaborated and voluntary motor impulses 

589
00:33:04,671 --> 00:33:05,504
are generated.
So this sort of explains for long time 

590
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,793
experimental psychology was dominated by
behaviorists who thought of the animal 

591
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:13,574
as a stimulus response machine.
And never paid much attention to the 

592
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:18,104
function of things like thought or 
emotion or complex internal states and 

593
00:33:22,311 --> 00:33:24,890
you know,
the behaviors got an awful long way with

594
00:33:24,891 --> 00:33:29,240
the idea of the animal as a sort of 
simple stimulus response machine.

595
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:32,300
And that's partly because of this 
hierarchy that we're describing,

596
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,153
you know,
because you can treat an animal as if 

597
00:33:35,811 --> 00:33:39,770
it's a pretty simple machine because it 
has all that simple machinery in it.

598
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,780
It's just that on top of that simple 
machinery,

599
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,560
there's a lot more complex machinery and
so.

600
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:46,543
But the simple machinery does a lot more
than people generally think and can do 

601
00:33:49,101 --> 00:33:53,480
more than people think.
And so the fact that there are these,

602
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:56,240
at least two projections,
they branch more than that,

603
00:33:56,570 --> 00:33:57,403
gives you right away a sense of why the 
behaviors could have been right and the 

604
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:02,750
cognitive psychologists could have been 
right.

605
00:34:02,751 --> 00:34:03,584
And even the cycle dynamic thinkers can 
be right because they're analyzing the 

606
00:34:06,951 --> 00:34:07,784
system at different levels of 
hierarchical complexity and extracting 

607
00:34:10,821 --> 00:34:11,654
out slightly different,
what would you call a observations and 

608
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:18,763
some of these things,
or even like the simpler systems can 

609
00:34:21,201 --> 00:34:22,790
have quite complex output.
So,

610
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:23,953
so one of the things that the simpler 
sensory motor system does is detect 

611
00:34:26,871 --> 00:34:29,480
snakes because primates don't like 
snakes.

612
00:34:29,481 --> 00:34:31,460
In fact,
there's a woman named

613
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,293
Lynne Isbell wrote a nice book on 
primate vision and snakes and she was 

614
00:34:37,641 --> 00:34:40,100
very curious about why human beings 
could see so well.

615
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,100
And uh,
she also noticed that we're very good at

616
00:34:43,101 --> 00:34:43,934
detecting
the sort of camouflage patterns that 

617
00:34:47,571 --> 00:34:48,404
snakes used,
especially in the lower half of our 

618
00:34:49,731 --> 00:34:50,564
visual field.
And she did this cross cultural survey 

619
00:34:53,691 --> 00:34:57,740
around the world and found out that 
where there's more predatory snakes,

620
00:34:57,741 --> 00:34:58,574
the primates have better vision.
So we of co evolved with snakes and 

621
00:35:01,731 --> 00:35:04,100
snakes gave us vision just like it says 
in Genesis,

622
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:06,590
which is pretty damn funny as far as I'm
concerned.

623
00:35:06,591 --> 00:35:07,424
And it was snakes in trees even so.
And fruit of course gave us color 

624
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:11,474
vision.
So the whole genesis story nailed it 

625
00:35:13,221 --> 00:35:15,670
pretty well.
But you know,

626
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,553
snakes have been around long enough and 
have been our enemy or say predatory 

627
00:35:19,221 --> 00:35:20,210
reptiles,
you know,

628
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,450
if you don't really want to go with a 
little snake thing that are,

629
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,620
we've,
we've evolved.

630
00:35:24,621 --> 00:35:26,990
We've evolved with them.
It's like 60 million years.

631
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,610
It's a very,
very long period of time.

632
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:33,500
So Darwin used to amuse himself in a 
Darwinian way.

633
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:38,550
He'd go to the.
There is a zoo or a rep place that shows

634
00:35:38,551 --> 00:35:40,320
reptiles,
I don't remember what they're called,

635
00:35:40,321 --> 00:35:43,950
but they had one glass cage where there 
was some kind of poisonous snake,

636
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,813
I think it was a cobra,
and Darwin would put his face right up 

637
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:51,210
against the glass and the kroger would 
go whack and he jumped back and he.

638
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,913
He did that many times because he was 
curious about whether or not he could 

639
00:35:54,871 --> 00:35:59,010
actually bring this snake avoidance 
reflex under conscious control.

640
00:35:59,011 --> 00:36:01,020
And he couldn't.
Every time the snake jumped,

641
00:36:01,021 --> 00:36:02,820
he'd jumped backwards.
He couldn't control it.

642
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,163
And so that's because all the primates 
that could control it when there were 

643
00:36:07,681 --> 00:36:08,514
snakes biting them are dead.
So it was Darwin was the beneficiary of 

644
00:36:13,321 --> 00:36:15,960
the Darwinian process in that.
In that sense.

645
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,260
So,
so the point is your body's conserved,

646
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:20,094
all these low level fast operating 
circuits and so you're a simple machine 

647
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:26,520
in this sort of complex machine and an 
extremely complex machine.

648
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,533
And then something that's so complex 
that you can't even think about it as a 

649
00:36:29,941 --> 00:36:32,310
machine and you're all those things at 
the same time.

650
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,493
There's Swanson's take on how the motor 
system and the hypothalamus are 

651
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,620
integrated,
so it's quite nice.

652
00:36:40,621 --> 00:36:45,420
He shows that hypothalamic controller,
so that's one of the circuits that we've

653
00:36:45,421 --> 00:36:48,390
been talking about that are responsible 
for a basic motivated state,

654
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,360
get sensory input,
behavioral state input.

655
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:54,900
That's about the body and the input from
the cerebral hemispheres,

656
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:55,734
hypothetically,
that's thought or or voluntary action 

657
00:36:59,041 --> 00:37:00,360
plan,
something like that.

658
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,530
And then it has output to the motor 
pattern initiator,

659
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,030
the generators and the motor neuron 
pools and then you act lovely.

660
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,830
It's a beautiful,
beautiful model.

661
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:16,170
And so you can see that it maps very 
nicely onto that with the sort of higher

662
00:37:16,171 --> 00:37:17,004
order levels of the,
of the hierarchy of sensory motor 

663
00:37:20,581 --> 00:37:21,414
framing associated with cognitive 
abstractions in the lowest levels 

664
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:28,530
associated with those sorts of things 
that you do with your spine.

665
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:30,563
And this.
I flip this upside down here because 

666
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,493
it's I,
I've been very interested in how people 

667
00:37:37,261 --> 00:37:38,094
get traumatized and it's easier to think
of trauma when you flip the thing 

668
00:37:41,521 --> 00:37:44,820
because once you develop the higher 
order abstractions,

669
00:37:44,821 --> 00:37:45,660
cortically,
you know,

670
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:46,141
you say,
well,

671
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:47,700
I'm a good person,
let's say.

672
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:48,803
Then that's sort of the fact that you're
a good person or what constitutes good 

673
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:57,570
starts to become a box.
The box within which all the things that

674
00:37:57,571 --> 00:38:01,260
are associated with it are put.
It's one of the dangers of abstraction,

675
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:03,060
right?
And categorization.

676
00:38:03,061 --> 00:38:07,410
Because if you couldn't think of 
yourself as a good or bad person,

677
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:10,410
let's say you didn't have that capacity 
for that level of abstraction,

678
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,810
which is like a binary abstraction,
right?

679
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,420
Good is,
you know,

680
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,990
one in and bad is zero.
So it's a really.

681
00:38:21,991 --> 00:38:26,991
It's a really simple abstraction and so 
if someone,

682
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,360
if you do something that a good person 
wouldn't do well,

683
00:38:30,361 --> 00:38:33,690
clearly you don't fit into one category 
because a good person wouldn't do that.

684
00:38:33,691 --> 00:38:38,260
So maybe you fit into the zero.
And that's that capacity for abstraction

685
00:38:38,261 --> 00:38:39,094
is also precisely the sort of thing that
allows human beings to undermine 

686
00:38:41,351 --> 00:38:42,520
themselves with thought.

687
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:45,850
Because once you have that capacity for 
abstraction,

688
00:38:45,851 --> 00:38:48,590
you can make these ridiculous 
overgeneralizations.

689
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:49,750
In fact,
they're really simple.

690
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,820
I'm not a good person.
I'm a horrible person.

691
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:52,893
It's like that's how a,
someone who's really depressed things 

692
00:38:54,881 --> 00:38:58,600
whenever anything goes wrong.
And so it's the danger,

693
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,530
the powerful danger of abstraction is 
that you can make a terrible mistake and

694
00:39:02,531 --> 00:39:05,560
overgeneralization this is partly 
because,

695
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:08,890
well,
let's say a harder goal.

696
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:14,020
You're out with your girlfriend and you 
flirt with someone else.

697
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:16,563
Um,
so what does that say about your 

698
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:21,250
character?
Well,

699
00:39:21,251 --> 00:39:24,250
she might think that puts you in the 
zero category like now,

700
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,960
right?
You're not a good person.

701
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,071
It's like,
well,

702
00:39:27,071 --> 00:39:28,330
it's complicated.
Is that,

703
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:31,600
is that true?
Do you belong in that zero category?

704
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,850
She might treat you like that for a week
or two.

705
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,213
I mean,
shouldn't you be taking yourself apart 

706
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:38,320
completely because you've made that 
error?

707
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,693
Or should you seek farther down the 
chain of abstractions for a more 

708
00:39:43,331 --> 00:39:45,850
specific mistake and,
or should she help you do that?

709
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:46,511
It's like,
well,

710
00:39:46,511 --> 00:39:48,220
you're not a complete zero,
you're more like a,

711
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,750
you know,
point one.

712
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,793
She could help you figure out exactly 
where in your personality hierarchy you 

713
00:39:53,681 --> 00:39:56,140
have this fault.
So being that it's a fault,

714
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,273
you know,
maybe it's an indication that the 

715
00:39:57,821 --> 00:39:59,680
relationship is over who,
who knows.

716
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:00,963
So anyways,
I wanted to show you that because then 

717
00:40:04,211 --> 00:40:05,044
you can develop a sense of how this 
hierarchical system can also lead to 

718
00:40:08,021 --> 00:40:11,920
cataclysmic overgeneralization and 
that's associated with lots of different

719
00:40:11,921 --> 00:40:12,754
mental illnesses,
especially depression because depressed 

720
00:40:14,741 --> 00:40:18,070
people generally go from a small 
mistake,

721
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:21,790
a mistake,
hard to parameterize,

722
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,190
right,
to the highest level of abstraction say,

723
00:40:24,191 --> 00:40:26,470
well,
I've made error a therefore and useless,

724
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,110
or therefore I bad.
It's not good.

725
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,300
It's too undifferentiated.

726
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,920
I put that in there to remind you that 
all these little things

727
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:42,450
are informed
by the underlying hypothalamic circuits.

728
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:48,730
So you know,
that whole hierarchy has to be.

729
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:51,820
Imagine how it's conditioned.
That whole hierarchy of motor output,

730
00:40:51,821 --> 00:40:52,654
part of it is conditioned by.
And then this is sort of like an output 

731
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,330
or an input system that Sorenson didn't 
talk about,

732
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:59,223
sort of sensory.
That whole motor sensory sensory motor 

733
00:41:03,011 --> 00:41:04,990
hierarchy,
sensory motor perception,

734
00:41:04,991 --> 00:41:05,824
action hierarchy will say has to be 
constructed so that your basic 

735
00:41:09,821 --> 00:41:13,210
motivational states stay satiated,
right?

736
00:41:13,211 --> 00:41:16,600
Because otherwise you get thirsty enough
and you die or you get hungry enough and

737
00:41:16,601 --> 00:41:17,434
you die.
It's like you have to organize your 

738
00:41:19,871 --> 00:41:23,710
behavior so that those basic motivations
stay fulfilled,

739
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,653
so each of the little ovals that make up
that hierarchy have to be organized and 

740
00:41:32,441 --> 00:41:35,270
laid out with that set of limitations in
mind.

741
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:36,103
But then of course there's a higher 
order limitation which is more the one 

742
00:41:39,441 --> 00:41:40,274
that piaget talked about,
which is that not only do you have to 

743
00:41:42,561 --> 00:41:43,394
organize your internal hierarchies to 
take care of all of your basic 

744
00:41:46,611 --> 00:41:48,800
motivations,
but you have to do that well.

745
00:41:48,801 --> 00:41:52,250
Everyone else is doing the same thing 
and so in some sense,

746
00:41:52,251 --> 00:41:53,084
the hypothalamic system that's 
generating the impetus for these layers 

747
00:41:57,441 --> 00:42:01,940
and layers of motor output also has to 
do so in a social context.

748
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,200
Because otherwise,
you know,

749
00:42:03,201 --> 00:42:05,900
you fight to the death over a stick of 
bread,

750
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,360
which seems like a very 
counterproductive thing to do.

751
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,733
So
I'm trying to point out to you how many 

752
00:42:14,271 --> 00:42:19,271
parameters those that hierarchical 
organization has to meet simultaneously.

753
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:21,763
Also,
one of the implications of that is that 

754
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,420
it's not an arbitrary system.
Again,

755
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,680
this is one of the problems I have with 
the radical moral relativists stats.

756
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,210
It's like,
wait a minute,

757
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:33,763
wait a minute.
For you to set up your perceptual and 

758
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,543
behavioral system,
it has to solve a whole bunch of 

759
00:42:40,011 --> 00:42:40,844
problems like in the really complex 
problems and they're in their kind of 

760
00:42:42,951 --> 00:42:46,760
arbitrary in some sense like you get 
hungry and you need deet.

761
00:42:46,761 --> 00:42:47,594
It's arbitrary.
So what that means is you can't fill 

762
00:42:49,761 --> 00:42:52,430
that hierarchy with just any old thing,
you know,

763
00:42:52,431 --> 00:42:57,380
not only does it have to work to keep 
all the complex parts of you functioning

764
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,040
here and now,
but it has to keep them functioning here

765
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:01,874
and now in a way that doesn't disturb 
them functioning tomorrow or the next 

766
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:08,990
day or the next week or the next month.
So that's integration across time spans.

767
00:43:08,991 --> 00:43:10,280
That's a killer,
right?

768
00:43:10,281 --> 00:43:11,114
Because he can't just go out tonight and
drink 40 ounces of vodka and then you 

769
00:43:13,551 --> 00:43:15,170
know,
write the test on Thursday,

770
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:20,480
so there's probably not.
So some of you might try so,

771
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,033
but then you also have to organize your 
behavior in the here and now with your 

772
00:43:26,451 --> 00:43:27,284
behavior spread across timeframes in the
presence of other people who are also 

773
00:43:30,891 --> 00:43:33,170
organizing their behavior across 
timeframes.

774
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:34,263
It's like once you put that many 
parameters on the organization of a 

775
00:43:36,471 --> 00:43:37,304
personality,
you can see right away that it can 

776
00:43:39,321 --> 00:43:41,270
hardly be arbitrary.
You know,

777
00:43:41,271 --> 00:43:44,000
it's tightly constrained.
Okay,

778
00:43:44,001 --> 00:43:47,180
so here's some basic emotions.
We talked about basic motivations and so

779
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:48,523
the,
the web we're going to do in a simple 

780
00:43:49,491 --> 00:43:50,324
ways.
We're going to divide them into two 

781
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:54,080
positive emotions and negative emotions.
Okay?

782
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:56,870
And that basically gives you 
extroversion and neuroticism.

783
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:01,760
So positive emotions,
they kind of fall into two classes.

784
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:07,310
The one class is the positive emotion 
you feel when you,

785
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,850
when you run a motivational frame to its
limit.

786
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,120
So you're hungry,
you go have a peanut butter sandwich and

787
00:44:14,121 --> 00:44:15,650
then you're no longer hungry.
Okay?

788
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:20,651
So what's the state?
How do you define the state after you've

789
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:23,690
eaten European butter sandwich and 
you're no longer hungry?

790
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,060
Well,
you know,

791
00:44:26,061 --> 00:44:26,894
you're not jumping up and down and 
cheering like someone who just made a 

792
00:44:28,491 --> 00:44:29,150
touchdown.

793
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:29,940
Right?
So it's,

794
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:30,773
it's not that kind of positive emotion 
that you see when people are 

795
00:44:33,661 --> 00:44:35,000
celebrating,
you know,

796
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:35,853
it's more like satisfaction and that's 
actually technically what it's known as 

797
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:41,123
satiation.
And so when a motivational routine runs 

798
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:48,780
successfully,
what happens is it eliminates,

799
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:52,410
it eliminates the necessity for it to 
exist temporarily.

800
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,060
So basically what happens is you run a 
framework to its logical conclusion,

801
00:44:57,061 --> 00:44:57,894
poof,
it disappears because it's done and you 

802
00:44:59,971 --> 00:45:01,890
know,
you might be satisfied about that,

803
00:45:01,891 --> 00:45:02,724
but that's the next thing that happens 
is another motivational framework pops 

804
00:45:05,641 --> 00:45:06,680
up in your,
you know,

805
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:09,510
you're in the same game and sisyphus 
fundamentally.

806
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:13,980
So anyways,
it's satiation.

807
00:45:13,981 --> 00:45:18,981
That is the term satiation is 
technically use to describe the state of

808
00:45:20,191 --> 00:45:21,024
being.
That's characteristic of the successful 

809
00:45:22,441 --> 00:45:23,274
execution of a motivated frame.
It's also known as consumed matory 

810
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:30,580
reward,
consummation consume.

811
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:35,660
And that's associated with 
unconditioned.

812
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:40,640
That's an unconditioned response.
It,

813
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:42,920
which means you don't have to learn it.
So it's a,

814
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:46,720
it's an unconditioned positive response,
so,

815
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:49,600
and that means that satiating

816
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,990
stimuli when delivered to a creature in 
the proper motivational frame,

817
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:57,360
have the properties of unconditioned 
rewards.

818
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:58,463
So you get three things there.
You know the satiation brings the motor 

819
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:01,703
frame motivated frame to an end.
The satiation is also known as consumer 

820
00:46:04,861 --> 00:46:05,694
Tory.
Reward Conservatory reward is very 

821
00:46:07,381 --> 00:46:12,060
similar to what the behavior is 
described as unconditioned reward,

822
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,430
unlearned,
so you can,

823
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,293
you can stack each of those things to 
know on top of each other and then 

824
00:46:17,521 --> 00:46:18,354
you've got them.
The other kind of positive emotion is 

825
00:46:21,271 --> 00:46:22,104
the positive emotion that you feel when 
it looks like you might get a 

826
00:46:24,211 --> 00:46:25,530
conservatory reward,

827
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,020
right?
Right.

828
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:29,520
Hope,
curiosity,

829
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:31,950
anticipation,
excitement,

830
00:46:31,951 --> 00:46:32,784
enthusiasm,
all of the positive emotions that we 

831
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:37,320
think of as really like happy,
happy,

832
00:46:37,321 --> 00:46:38,154
usually has to do with evidence that 
your pursuit of a valued conservatory 

833
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,180
reward is going well.
Okay?

834
00:46:45,181 --> 00:46:46,014
Now that that's incentive reward and the
reason it's called incentive reward is 

835
00:46:49,591 --> 00:46:50,424
because you're incentivized to move 
forward to the reward and the moving 

836
00:46:53,671 --> 00:46:54,504
forward,
the impulse to move forward towards a 

837
00:46:56,551 --> 00:46:57,384
desired goal.
That's what your positive emotion 

838
00:47:00,631 --> 00:47:01,464
systems,
the dopaminergic systems that are 

839
00:47:02,581 --> 00:47:05,280
nestled have the roots in the 
hypothalamus.

840
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:10,560
That's what they motivate you to do.
That's what positive emotion is.

841
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:12,810
Fundamentally positive emotion is 
there's something good.

842
00:47:12,811 --> 00:47:15,510
I'm going to go get it.
It's the I'm going to go get it.

843
00:47:15,511 --> 00:47:18,540
Part that's associated with excitement 
and positive emotion.

844
00:47:18,541 --> 00:47:20,490
It's what do you feel?
Maybe you're an extrovert.

845
00:47:20,491 --> 00:47:24,060
You want to go to a party and so you're 
probably more excited about going to the

846
00:47:24,061 --> 00:47:24,330
party.

847
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:26,210
Then you will be when you get there,
you know,

848
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:29,220
because it's the.
It's the apprehension of the reward.

849
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:32,020
That's with human beings because we're 
such weird creatures.

850
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:34,060
So often the apprehension of the 
consumer,

851
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:39,061
Terry Ward is a more powerful emotion 
than the emotion that's actually felt as

852
00:47:39,101 --> 00:47:41,140
a consequence of gaining the reward 
itself.

853
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:42,813
And that's partly,
and this is where it gets a little more 

854
00:47:43,901 --> 00:47:44,734
complicated.
That's partly because we're so bloody 

855
00:47:46,151 --> 00:47:47,890
exploratory,
you know?

856
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,753
So there's things that you can learn 
about that are associated with the 

857
00:47:52,301 --> 00:47:56,410
conservatory reward.
Those are conditioned rewards.

858
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,673
So an incentive reward and the 
conditioned reward are in the same 

859
00:47:59,981 --> 00:48:00,814
category.
Although not all incentive rewards are 

860
00:48:04,211 --> 00:48:05,044
learned,
this is where the behaviorists went 

861
00:48:05,831 --> 00:48:09,100
wrong because the behaviors thought 
there are consumer metairie rewards.

862
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:14,280
Those are unconditioned rewards to get a
conditioned to come.

863
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,770
If you condition a stimulus to an 
unconditioned reward,

864
00:48:17,771 --> 00:48:21,250
you get a conditioned stimulus with a 
conditioned reward is a response,

865
00:48:21,251 --> 00:48:22,084
but the problem with that line of 
thinking is that there's actually 

866
00:48:24,551 --> 00:48:26,320
incentive reward circuitry.

867
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:27,813
It's not just secondary learning.
It's like incentive rewards have been 

868
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:32,900
around so long,
so those are things that indicate that a

869
00:48:32,901 --> 00:48:33,734
consumer story reward is coming.
They've been around so long that your 

870
00:48:36,401 --> 00:48:37,234
brain is developed its own circuit for 
that and that's the one that produces 

871
00:48:39,461 --> 00:48:43,480
positive emotion and so that's also 
produced by the way,

872
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:44,583
if you,
when you're taking a drug of some sort 

873
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:47,253
that you really like,
that's because it's activating this 

874
00:48:50,021 --> 00:48:50,854
dopaminergic incentive reward system.
If you take a drug that activates 

875
00:48:54,191 --> 00:48:55,024
conservatory reward,
you just like lay in front of the fire 

876
00:48:56,561 --> 00:48:58,240
like a sleeping dog,
you know,

877
00:48:58,241 --> 00:49:00,580
it's not exciting.
It's cocaine,

878
00:49:00,581 --> 00:49:02,800
amphetamines,
alcohol for lots of people,

879
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:03,783
nail the incentive reward system,
and that's the dopaminergic exploratory 

880
00:49:06,881 --> 00:49:08,830
system that emerges out of the 
hypothalamus.

881
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:09,903
And it's also the thing that learns what
to associate with consumer matory 

882
00:49:13,361 --> 00:49:16,180
rewards.
So I know that's a lot to take in,

883
00:49:16,181 --> 00:49:18,400
but well,
it doesn't matter.

884
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,930
That's how it is.
So,

885
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:26,130
so the approach systems respond to ques 
of consumer Tory reward.

886
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:30,850
And they also,
they also respond to a large set of um,

887
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:34,690
biologically prepared stimuli smells,
for example.

888
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:39,430
So
now you should approach good things,

889
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:42,490
but if a bad thing happens,
what should you do?

890
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:44,860
Well,
one thing you should do is stop.

891
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,290
Another thing you should do is get the 
hell out of there.

892
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:48,483
So there's a constellation of negative 
emotions that are associated with 

893
00:49:51,881 --> 00:49:52,714
defense and avoidance.
And we kind of ran through those 

894
00:49:54,611 --> 00:49:55,570
already.
Pain,

895
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,710
grief,
frustration,

896
00:49:56,711 --> 00:49:59,680
disappointment,
and then fear,

897
00:49:59,681 --> 00:50:04,681
which is sort of what you learn.
You learn that things to be feared.

898
00:50:05,411 --> 00:50:08,740
Signal,
primary pain stimulus,

899
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:09,963
you know,
so a child is going to be afraid of a 

900
00:50:10,631 --> 00:50:11,464
needle,
especially if a child's got a needle 

901
00:50:12,401 --> 00:50:15,190
before.
Most children are smart enough to figure

902
00:50:15,191 --> 00:50:17,500
out they should be afraid of the needle 
even when they haven't had it,

903
00:50:17,501 --> 00:50:18,334
but the thing is is that if you come 
into contact with something that's 

904
00:50:21,761 --> 00:50:22,594
already caused you pain and now there's 
something that only signals that that's 

905
00:50:26,291 --> 00:50:29,300
likely to happen when you experience 
fear,

906
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:30,590
okay?

907
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:31,423
Fear is its own circuit again,
which is where the behaviors in some 

908
00:50:34,341 --> 00:50:35,174
sense wind a little bit wrong too 
because they thought of unconditioned 

909
00:50:37,370 --> 00:50:38,203
punishment,
which produces pain as the primary 

910
00:50:40,731 --> 00:50:43,790
motivational system,
so it would be unconditioned punishment,

911
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:47,480
unconditioned reward.
Then there were things you learned about

912
00:50:47,481 --> 00:50:49,250
those that produced conditioned 
punishment,

913
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:50,810
conditioned reward,
okay,

914
00:50:50,811 --> 00:50:53,480
but all of those have circuits,
independent circuits,

915
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:54,643
so the defense and avoidance,
negative emotions seem to be roughly 

916
00:50:57,771 --> 00:50:59,660
pain,
anxiety and fear.

917
00:50:59,661 --> 00:51:00,494
But then there's discussed and people 
have been looking at discussed a lot 

918
00:51:03,321 --> 00:51:05,630
lately and it doesn't load on 
neuroticism.

919
00:51:05,631 --> 00:51:08,270
It doesn't seem to load on neuroticism.
So it's its own circuit.

920
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,370
So,
okay,

921
00:51:10,371 --> 00:51:11,204
so here's another one.
Other complexity that you need to 

922
00:51:14,031 --> 00:51:17,420
grapple with,
which is there are things that hurt that

923
00:51:17,421 --> 00:51:18,254
caused you pain.
There are things that are satiating and 

924
00:51:20,871 --> 00:51:21,704
netter conservatory reward.
Then there are things that signal each 

925
00:51:25,281 --> 00:51:28,670
of those,
but there's one class of stimuli,

926
00:51:28,671 --> 00:51:30,650
so to speak,
or things that you're going to encounter

927
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:31,783
that or a paradoxical,
and that's the class of things that you 

928
00:51:34,101 --> 00:51:35,720
don't understand.

929
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:40,640
That's novelty and novelty.
It's it's novelty itself.

930
00:51:40,641 --> 00:51:44,210
That's sort of associated with what the 
phenomenologists are primarily concerned

931
00:51:44,211 --> 00:51:46,610
about.
The idea of the revelation of meaning,

932
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:47,683
because the revelation of meaning is 
mostly associated with you encountering 

933
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,480
something that you haven't already 
understood,

934
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:54,373
right?
You explore that new information comes 

935
00:51:56,211 --> 00:51:57,890
out of it,
a new you comes out of it.

936
00:51:57,891 --> 00:52:00,680
Okay,
so you're going from point a to point b,

937
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:02,533
what might happen,
where all things might happen that it 

938
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,990
appeared to demonstrate that you're on 
the right track,

939
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:12,110
so that makes you happy.
That's the yellow box,

940
00:52:12,111 --> 00:52:14,020
positive emotion.
You know,

941
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:17,270
your,
your pathway is being facilitated.

942
00:52:17,271 --> 00:52:19,760
So that's why tools are sort of in that 
category.

943
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:20,773
Or you can be moving towards point b and
you get something gets in your way and 

944
00:52:24,201 --> 00:52:26,610
that might be something that hurts you.
That'd be.

945
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,353
And that would be pain or disappointment
or frustration or grief or something 

946
00:52:32,301 --> 00:52:36,560
that signals that you might get hurt,
which is threat that produces fear.

947
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:37,663
And so the positive emotion is moving 
you towards the desired goal in the 

948
00:52:41,901 --> 00:52:46,901
negative emotion is protecting you.
And so if a negative things happened,

949
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:48,624
you'll stop and you'll reconfigure the 
behavior that you're using or the 

950
00:52:51,831 --> 00:52:54,410
framework in order to get around the 
obstacle and to continue.

951
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:57,680
Or if it's a bad now fobs to call you,
you might say,

952
00:52:57,681 --> 00:52:58,514
well,
I have not.

953
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,050
I'm too tired deet and I'm too hungry to
sleep.

954
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,700
That happens to people,
right?

955
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:09,650
It's a conflict of motivations.
And so if you get up and you go into the

956
00:53:09,651 --> 00:53:11,630
cupboard and you find out there's 
nothing to eat,

957
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:12,471
you might say,
Oh,

958
00:53:12,471 --> 00:53:14,210
to hell with it,
then I'll just go to sleep.

959
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:16,970
You know?
So sometimes the way you solve a problem

960
00:53:16,971 --> 00:53:17,804
is by flipping the problem.
It's like we're not going to solve that 

961
00:53:19,311 --> 00:53:21,650
problem right now.
We'll turn to another problem some.

962
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,870
And that's an explorer.
That's an exploratory move.

963
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:27,690
Sometimes you within the frame,
you know you go to the cupboard,

964
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,380
the cupboard is bare,
but you're hungry,

965
00:53:31,381 --> 00:53:34,600
so you walked down to the corner store 
and you get something to eat and so that

966
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:37,860
way you have sort of stayed within the 
frame and altered.

967
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,650
You know you've altered your behavior to
too.

968
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:42,993
You've thought up another path and 
altered your behavior so that that 

969
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:48,010
motivated state can run to completion.

970
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,113
Here's another way of looking at it.
You can be moving from point a to b and 

971
00:53:56,870 --> 00:54:01,280
what you predict or want is happening.
That's a good thing that keeps your mood

972
00:54:01,281 --> 00:54:03,820
straight and you happy and that makes 
you whoa.

973
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:04,683
That's a promise with the promises.
You're going to get what you want and 

974
00:54:07,401 --> 00:54:08,234
that fills you with hope.
That's positive emotion or you can have 

975
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,740
an unpredicted outcomes when you're,
you know,

976
00:54:12,741 --> 00:54:16,430
you to know you're supposed to be going 
out with your friend,

977
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:20,390
you go to the door,
you knock and there's nobody there.

978
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,340
So it's like,
what's up with that?

979
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,260
And so it's,
in a sense when that happens,

980
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,240
there's like a hole in your framework,
you know,

981
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:29,420
because your framework was predicated on
the presence of your friend,

982
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,640
right?
It was a presupposition.

983
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:33,043
And so now,
and then you'll run out of behavioral 

984
00:54:34,221 --> 00:54:37,960
routine and one of your presuppositions 
is wrong and sort of like there's a hole

985
00:54:37,961 --> 00:54:42,961
in your theory and the whole you sort of
drop into it and when you drop into that

986
00:54:43,011 --> 00:54:43,844
hole you get anxious because you don't 
know exactly what this unexpected thing 

987
00:54:47,901 --> 00:54:52,340
means.
And behind that you get exploratory.

988
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:53,780
So with most people

989
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:55,993
they're going to get afraid first.
They're gonna have negative emotion 

990
00:54:57,391 --> 00:54:58,224
first when they're little plan is blown.
And then if nothing additionally awful 

991
00:55:01,491 --> 00:55:02,324
happens and if they don't drive 
themselves crazy with some hypothesis 

992
00:55:05,121 --> 00:55:08,300
about he doesn't like me anymore.
And so no one likes me anymore.

993
00:55:08,301 --> 00:55:10,120
So I'm a terrible person,
you know?

994
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:13,460
Then the x,
once they calm down a little bit,

995
00:55:13,461 --> 00:55:17,570
the exploration circuit will come up and
maybe they'll walk somewhere else,

996
00:55:17,571 --> 00:55:19,910
go to a bar or maybe they'll stand there
and think,

997
00:55:19,911 --> 00:55:20,690
well,
you know,

998
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:22,580
this didn't work out.
So what else could I do?

999
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:25,820
And emotionally stable person,
say a non neurotic personnel,

1000
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:26,713
flip to that really fast,
especially if they're extroverted and 

1001
00:55:28,371 --> 00:55:30,140
open.
Whereas someone who's heavy,

1002
00:55:30,141 --> 00:55:30,974
a negative emotion,
you know the fact that their friend 

1003
00:55:32,661 --> 00:55:34,880
wasn't there when they told him they 
would be.

1004
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:38,570
That might just produce a hole that they
fall into and it's so deep and painful,

1005
00:55:38,571 --> 00:55:40,850
they just go home and cry.
So.

1006
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:41,833
So the neuroticism and the extroversion 
are in some sense they vary with the 

1007
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:51,620
degree to which the negative emotion 
system is strong or the positive emotion

1008
00:55:51,621 --> 00:55:53,960
system is strong and they're two 
different systems.

1009
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:56,120
And so you can think of them in some 
sense.

1010
00:55:56,121 --> 00:55:57,110
You can think of them as

1011
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:03,670
units of positive emotion per unit of 
promise.

1012
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:05,323
It's,
I mean it's a weird thing to try to 

1013
00:56:06,371 --> 00:56:11,140
quantify or units of negative emotion 
per unit of threat.

1014
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,360
So you know,
if someone,

1015
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:15,520
maybe someone.
There's a rumor going around that you're

1016
00:56:15,521 --> 00:56:16,354
going to lose your job.
Well how much should you worry about 

1017
00:56:18,311 --> 00:56:19,510
that?
Well,

1018
00:56:19,511 --> 00:56:20,530
God,
you don't know.

1019
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,210
So how do you decide?
Well,

1020
00:56:22,211 --> 00:56:23,100
you don't,
you're,

1021
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:26,020
you're wiring decide.
So if you're high in negative emotion,

1022
00:56:26,021 --> 00:56:27,850
you're going to get all anxious and 
freak out about it,

1023
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:30,550
which might be the right thing to do.
Maybe you will lose your job,

1024
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,490
and if you're emotionally stable,
you're going to think,

1025
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:35,890
God,
I probably won't lose my job,

1026
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,750
but even if I can,
even if I do,

1027
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,620
I'm not going to worry about it.
It's innate or lot of it's innate.

1028
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:42,963
So

1029
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:48,400
okay,
so to recapitulate learning theory,

1030
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,730
behaviorism,
there are unconditioned rewards.

1031
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:54,790
Those are rewards you don't have to 
learn.

1032
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,690
Those are the things that bring a 
motivated state to its closure,

1033
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:03,430
roughly speaking,
and that makes you satisfied satiation.

1034
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:05,620
That by the way,
is associated with Serotonin.

1035
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:11,340
Serotonin is a satiating neurochemical,
so if your levels of Serotonin are high,

1036
00:57:11,770 --> 00:57:12,603
you're kind of satisfied,
which means you don't experience a lot 

1037
00:57:14,591 --> 00:57:16,840
of positive emotion or a lot of negative
emotion.

1038
00:57:16,841 --> 00:57:17,674
You're just kind of satisfied.
It's a high dominance thing and it's 

1039
00:57:20,081 --> 00:57:23,260
like all the consumer terry rewards are 
there when you need them.

1040
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:26,050
You don't have to worry and you don't 
have to get too excited.

1041
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,353
Conditioned rewards or incentive rewards
indicate progress towards a consumer to 

1042
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,410
consume matory reward.
They can be learned or conditioned,

1043
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,393
but they can also be a and they're 
associated with dopaminergic activation 

1044
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:42,520
and that's the exploration circuit that 
comes out of the hypothalamus.

1045
00:57:42,670 --> 00:57:46,060
Half the hymen,
the hypothalamus does goal specification

1046
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:50,830
and the other half does exploration and 
so again,

1047
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:55,180
if you're pursuing something that's an 
identifiable goal and you fail,

1048
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:59,020
well then you're going to back off.
That's negative emotion,

1049
00:57:59,021 --> 00:58:02,440
then you're going to start to explore 
and that's that dopaminergic circuit.

1050
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:06,820
What's associated with dopaminergic 
activation,

1051
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,900
exploration,
extroversion,

1052
00:58:10,901 --> 00:58:13,150
happiness,
play enthusiasm,

1053
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:15,910
assertiveness,
and the positive element of novelty.

1054
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:17,920
Okay,
so that makes sense.

1055
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,860
Anybody have any questions?
I know that's a lot of information,

1056
00:58:20,861 --> 00:58:21,694
but I kind of designed this part of the 
course so that at this point the levels 

1057
00:58:25,601 --> 00:58:29,350
of analysis would stack up so that you 
could understand them simultaneously.

1058
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:34,870
So the hypothalamus sets up your frames 
of motivation

1059
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,920
running one of those two,
the two,

1060
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:41,370
it's positive.
Conclusion,

1061
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,190
that satisfying.
That's innate.

1062
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:46,290
It's concise,
it's conservatory reward.

1063
00:58:46,291 --> 00:58:47,124
You'll work for that.
Anything that indicates that that might 

1064
00:58:49,531 --> 00:58:51,840
happen,
that's incentive reward.

1065
00:58:51,841 --> 00:58:53,900
You can learn that,
but some of it's also innate,

1066
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:58,080
which is where the behaviors didn't know
that because they thought of all the all

1067
00:58:58,081 --> 00:59:00,690
the secondary stuff,
that condition stuff has learned.

1068
00:59:00,691 --> 00:59:02,790
It's not all learned.
Some of it's already prepared.

1069
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:05,880
You see a snake that's a threat.
You don't have to learn that.

1070
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:11,070
So fire is sort of like that as well.
I'm blonde is like that.

1071
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:13,890
Teeth are like that.
Staring eyes are like that.

1072
00:59:13,891 --> 00:59:18,891
Predatory postures are like that
loud,

1073
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:23,000
loud vocalizations.
Especially if they're like low,

1074
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:26,840
low in frequency,
they indicate a large animal.

1075
00:59:26,841 --> 00:59:27,674
All those things are things you don't 
have to learn to be afraid of because 

1076
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,273
they've been so consistently dangerous 
in the past that you've built up a 

1077
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:36,560
circuit that aren't responds 
automatically to the question

1078
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:43,540
extraversion then it seems like there 
will at least that usually.

1079
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:49,220
Do you know what I mean?

1080
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:50,540
Yeah.
It's complicated,

1081
00:59:50,541 --> 00:59:51,374
you know,
because they do play a bit of an 

1082
00:59:52,521 --> 00:59:54,800
inhibitory rule,
but they're separate circuits,

1083
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:56,283
you know,
so you can be very extroverted and very 

1084
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:00,290
high in negative emotion.
So.

1085
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:06,050
And you can be very emotionally stable 
and very low in extroversion too.

1086
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:07,333
So,
but they are definitely separate things 

1087
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:09,500
now.
It's hard,

1088
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:10,333
you know,
you can flip from laughing to crying 

1089
01:00:11,781 --> 01:00:13,580
very rapidly,
you know,

1090
01:00:13,581 --> 01:00:14,414
so people are very much capable 
experiencing mixed states of positive 

1091
01:00:17,481 --> 01:00:20,660
and negative emotion.
Plus there are forms of manic depressive

1092
01:00:20,661 --> 01:00:23,570
disorder where people are manic and 
depressed at the same time,

1093
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:26,900
which I would recommend the people I 
know that have had that.

1094
01:00:26,901 --> 01:00:29,120
They seem to think that is certainly not
fun.

1095
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:33,740
So
agitation,

1096
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:35,653
tremendous agitation.
You're probably sort of like that when 

1097
01:00:38,481 --> 01:00:39,314
you're deeply confused and you're really
bothered by it because then the threads 

1098
01:00:42,141 --> 01:00:44,570
circuits are going,
but you're also sort of wandering around

1099
01:00:44,571 --> 01:00:44,991
going,
oh,

1100
01:00:44,991 --> 01:00:45,950
what am I going to do?

1101
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,870
That's all.
That's all.

1102
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:52,280
Like approach behavior approach.
Motivation isn't always positive A.

1103
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:53,203
I mean most of the time it is,
but intensity measures and 

1104
01:00:55,731 --> 01:00:59,290
controllability matters too,
so okay.

1105
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:05,060
Unconditioned punishments,
fundamentally they produce pain.

1106
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,133
They also tend to ha.
If you run a behavioral routine or a 

1107
01:01:10,911 --> 01:01:14,660
motivated framework that results in 
punishment,

1108
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:17,420
you're less likely to run it again in 
the future.

1109
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:18,343
That's learning.
If you run a motivated frame and it 

1110
01:01:20,721 --> 01:01:21,554
works,
you're more likely to run it in the 

1111
01:01:22,161 --> 01:01:25,760
future.
That's learning to sew.

1112
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:30,170
Unconditioned punishments decrease the 
probability that you're going to run and

1113
01:01:30,171 --> 01:01:32,740
given motivational frame because it 
failed,

1114
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:34,760
right?
Do you ran out and you got hurt?

1115
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:35,713
It's like,
don't do that again as part of the 

1116
01:01:37,221 --> 01:01:40,370
purpose of memory and the pain like 
emotions,

1117
01:01:40,371 --> 01:01:42,080
just to say it again,
our pain,

1118
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,270
frustration,
disappointment,

1119
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,970
grief,
sadness is in there as well,

1120
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:49,190
so those are paying like states of 
emotion,

1121
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:51,620
conditioned punishments.

1122
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:55,250
Those are things that indicate that a 
punishment is likely.

1123
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:57,013
Some of them you can learn.
Some of them you don't have to because 

1124
01:01:59,211 --> 01:02:00,044
they're already built into you.
The negative emotions are dampened by 

1125
01:02:03,381 --> 01:02:06,620
Serotonin.
That's the fundamental brain system.

1126
01:02:06,621 --> 01:02:07,454
Fundamentally,
it's the serotonergic system is like a 

1127
01:02:09,051 --> 01:02:09,884
conductor of the orchestra.
It keeps everything in balance and 

1128
01:02:13,431 --> 01:02:16,700
Gabba.
Gabba is a anxie.

1129
01:02:16,701 --> 01:02:20,370
Lytic makes people less anxious.
It's your brain produces it.

1130
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:21,683
If you take valium or barbiturates,
they act on the Gaba system and so does 

1131
01:02:26,101 --> 01:02:26,934
alcohol.
That's part of the reason why people 

1132
01:02:28,501 --> 01:02:31,440
like alcohol because it dampens anxiety.
Now for some people,

1133
01:02:31,441 --> 01:02:34,620
alcohol or also produces dopaminergic 
activation,

1134
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:39,360
so they really like alcohol because it 
calms them down like they're not anxious

1135
01:02:39,361 --> 01:02:40,194
anymore and it it also feels produces 
incentive reward activation like 

1136
01:02:44,491 --> 01:02:47,430
cocaine.
So for some people alcohol is absolutely

1137
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:48,264
deadly drug.
You can probably find out if you're 

1138
01:02:50,491 --> 01:02:54,000
susceptible to alcoholism quite 
straightforwardly.

1139
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,810
If you want to find out,
sit in a bar,

1140
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:58,980
take your pulse

1141
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,210
down,
five shots,

1142
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:05,060
four shots.
If you're little,

1143
01:03:05,690 --> 01:03:06,523
you got to get your.
You got to get your blood alcohol level 

1144
01:03:08,001 --> 01:03:08,834
above legal intoxication or you won't be
able to tell and then take your pulse 

1145
01:03:11,571 --> 01:03:15,410
again 10 minutes later.
If your pulse has gone up eight beats or

1146
01:03:15,411 --> 01:03:16,244
more,
watch it because you're probably 

1147
01:03:18,501 --> 01:03:19,334
producing an opiate response to alcohol.
Secondary consequences of the opiate 

1148
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:24,350
responses,
a dopaminergic response,

1149
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:25,543
reasonable probability that you'll like 
alcohol enough to find it difficult to 

1150
01:03:28,851 --> 01:03:30,470
stop drinking.
Once you start,

1151
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:32,000
some of you are probably like that,
right?

1152
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:33,860
You have a few drinks.
It's like yeehaw.

1153
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,410
That's how we do it now.
Berta.

1154
01:03:36,411 --> 01:03:37,670
Anyways,
so,

1155
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:39,673
so part of that is killing the incentive
reward system and because it's an 

1156
01:03:42,231 --> 01:03:45,650
approach system and it's being queued by
the alcohol,

1157
01:03:45,651 --> 01:03:46,484
you just continue to hit it and the 
dopamine kicks only occur as your blood 

1158
01:03:51,801 --> 01:03:55,550
alcohol level is rising,
so you have to keep nailing it,

1159
01:03:55,850 --> 01:03:58,880
nailing yourself with alcohol because 
otherwise your blood alcohol level won't

1160
01:03:58,881 --> 01:03:59,714
keep rising and you won't get that nice 
enthusiasm and assertiveness that goes 

1161
01:04:03,231 --> 01:04:06,380
along with a pause.
Development of alcohol,

1162
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:10,880
neuroticism,
so this is the neuroticism dimension.

1163
01:04:12,770 --> 01:04:15,230
There's a gender difference in 
neuroticism.

1164
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:18,050
Women are about half a standard 
deviation,

1165
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:19,033
higher negative emotion than men.
It's seems like a cross cultural 

1166
01:04:22,461 --> 01:04:23,294
universal.
The differences more enhanced and 

1167
01:04:25,251 --> 01:04:26,084
egalitarian states like Scandinavia,
which is exactly the opposite of what 

1168
01:04:29,691 --> 01:04:30,620
you'd presume,
right?

1169
01:04:30,621 --> 01:04:33,890
If you were,
say as a radical,

1170
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:36,953
can't remember the name.
If you are someone who believes that 

1171
01:04:38,601 --> 01:04:40,940
everything occurs as a consequence of 
socialization,

1172
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,073
as you equalize the society,
the gender differences in personality 

1173
01:04:45,201 --> 01:04:49,910
become larger rather than smaller.
So which is not what anybody expected.

1174
01:04:49,911 --> 01:04:53,660
But that's what happened.
So boys and girls seem to have about the

1175
01:04:53,661 --> 01:04:56,690
same level of negative emotion,
but as soon as puberty hits,

1176
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:59,960
women become higher negative emotion 
than men on average.

1177
01:04:59,961 --> 01:05:04,160
There's still a lot of overlap between 
the genders and it never goes away again

1178
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:05,503
across the life course.
Once it kicks in in puberty and the 

1179
01:05:07,311 --> 01:05:09,920
reasons for that.
Women are smaller,

1180
01:05:10,010 --> 01:05:13,040
they're their upper bodies are weaker,
so they're more physical.

1181
01:05:13,090 --> 01:05:15,080
They're there at a physical 
disadvantage.

1182
01:05:15,081 --> 01:05:18,250
If they're in a dominance dispute,
they're sexually vulnerable,

1183
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:19,383
plus they have to take care of infants.
So I think those four things are 

1184
01:05:22,181 --> 01:05:23,014
probably enough to tilt the nervous 
system of women more towards negative 

1185
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:27,903
negative emotion.

1186
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:31,450
I've often thought maybe that women's 
named emotional systems,

1187
01:05:31,451 --> 01:05:35,260
the negative ones in particular,
are actually not tuned to the woman.

1188
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:38,710
I think there are tuned to the woman 
infant combination.

1189
01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:42,130
So it'd be good if you think about it 
from an.

1190
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:43,053
If you think about it for baited,
it almost has to be that way because an 

1191
01:05:45,671 --> 01:05:48,250
infant has to be carried around for like
a year and a half.

1192
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:49,413
And so at that point when you have an 
incident and maybe you're going to have 

1193
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:53,780
10,
you know,

1194
01:05:53,781 --> 01:05:55,930
you guys won't,
but in the evolutionary past,

1195
01:05:55,931 --> 01:05:56,764
that would have been the case,
you'd have an infant for much of your 

1196
01:05:58,601 --> 01:06:00,400
life.
And then you'd be a grandmother and have

1197
01:06:00,401 --> 01:06:01,690
an incident.
It's like,

1198
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:03,273
why wouldn't your nervous system be 
tuned at puberty for the two of you 

1199
01:06:06,161 --> 01:06:08,720
instead of one of you?
So how will,

1200
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:11,230
how could it be any other way?
Anyways?

1201
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:13,593
So you've got your hypothalamus.
And then on top of that you've got some 

1202
01:06:16,211 --> 01:06:17,950
circuits that deal with memory and 
emotion.

1203
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:18,813
So I'm going to run you through the 
hippocampus and the Amygdala relatively 

1204
01:06:20,981 --> 01:06:21,814
quickly.
So this is a theory that was basically 

1205
01:06:23,351 --> 01:06:27,760
put together by Sokolov was Russian 
neuropsychologist back in 1962.

1206
01:06:27,761 --> 01:06:28,594
But it's a variant of a theory that 
Norbert Wiener developed back in the 

1207
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:32,710
forties.
So here's the idea.

1208
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:38,020
You wander through the world and you,
if you're in a place that you know

1209
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:41,353
your memory systems,
the hippa campus looks inside your 

1210
01:06:45,271 --> 01:06:46,104
memory systems to see what it is that 
you want to have happen based on your 

1211
01:06:51,331 --> 01:06:53,670
understanding of the world.
Okay,

1212
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:56,910
so
you're in a motivated state,

1213
01:06:56,911 --> 01:07:00,450
but you have certain expectations that 
makes sense within that state,

1214
01:07:00,451 --> 01:07:03,660
so the hippocampus is watching what you 
think is going to happen,

1215
01:07:03,661 --> 01:07:05,190
but remember,
that's motivated.

1216
01:07:05,191 --> 01:07:06,024
It's not just expectation and then the 
hippocampus is also looking at the 

1217
01:07:09,811 --> 01:07:10,644
world.

1218
01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:13,603
Now it's looking at it interpretation of
the world because you can't help but 

1219
01:07:17,811 --> 01:07:18,644
interpret the world,
but fundamentally the hippocampus is 

1220
01:07:20,181 --> 01:07:21,014
looking inside you and outside you and 
then it seeing if what's happening 

1221
01:07:25,131 --> 01:07:28,160
inside and what's happening outside are 
the same,

1222
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:29,503
which means you know what you're doing 
and you know where you are and if 

1223
01:07:32,931 --> 01:07:35,060
they're the same.
So if it detects a match,

1224
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:36,193
then the hippocampus,
the inhibits the Amygdala and the 

1225
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,570
hypothalamus.
Roughly speaking.

1226
01:07:41,571 --> 01:07:42,404
Now what it actually seems to do,
there's a little circuit in your brain 

1227
01:07:45,021 --> 01:07:45,854
stem called the reticular activating 
circuit and it's the thing that turns 

1228
01:07:48,111 --> 01:07:48,944
your brain on at night.
If you're sleeping and you hear a noise 

1229
01:07:50,871 --> 01:07:52,340
that you shouldn't hear,
it's like bang.

1230
01:07:52,341 --> 01:07:54,770
You're awake.
It's the reticular activating system way

1231
01:07:54,771 --> 01:07:55,604
down in your brainstem,
puts your cortex into a high arousal 

1232
01:07:59,751 --> 01:08:01,280
state and Poof,
you're conscious.

1233
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:02,533
Now the hippocampus tells the reticular 
activating system to basically remain 

1234
01:08:07,161 --> 01:08:07,994
calm as well as as long as what you're 
expecting and desiring and what's 

1235
01:08:13,521 --> 01:08:14,660
happening are the same thing.

1236
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:15,763
So it's sort of like it's saying,
I know you could jump up and freak out 

1237
01:08:18,501 --> 01:08:19,334
and run about,
but you don't have to right now because 

1238
01:08:20,721 --> 01:08:24,260
everything is going according to plan.
But as soon as there's a deviation,

1239
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,020
that's an normally say.
Then the hippocampus says,

1240
01:08:27,021 --> 01:08:29,450
Whoa,
something's wrong here.

1241
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:34,610
And it inhibits the reticular activating
system that turns on your emotions,

1242
01:08:34,611 --> 01:08:35,444
especially your negative emotion,
but it primes your positive emotion and 

1243
01:08:38,151 --> 01:08:40,980
it prime some of the hypothalamic 
circuits to or disinhibit stuff.

1244
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:41,853
Because one way of solving the fact that
something isn't going well is to switch 

1245
01:08:45,831 --> 01:08:46,664
to something else,
so it's sort of like as a bunch of 

1246
01:08:49,551 --> 01:08:50,384
circuits on underneath you,
but they're being held back like race 

1247
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:54,253
horses and race horse and then something
that you don't expect happens in the 

1248
01:08:58,510 --> 01:09:00,860
gates come up a little bit because then 
you're prepared.

1249
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:02,750
Now a lot of that's negative emotion.
Oh,

1250
01:09:02,751 --> 01:09:04,550
you don't know where you are,
but a lot,

1251
01:09:04,570 --> 01:09:05,403
a lot of the rest of it is be prepared 
to do whatever the hell you might need 

1252
01:09:07,851 --> 01:09:09,380
to do next.
And so,

1253
01:09:09,381 --> 01:09:12,800
uh,
normally the hippocampus detects it.

1254
01:09:12,801 --> 01:09:14,780
Normally.
That's something unexpected.

1255
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:18,560
And then a disinhibitor to your lower 
circuitry and it gets you ready to go.

1256
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,660
Now the problem is

1257
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:25,290
how worried should you be when something
that you don't expect happens?

1258
01:09:26,710 --> 01:09:27,543
An answer to that is you don't know 
that's a big problem with life because 

1259
01:09:30,850 --> 01:09:33,910
now something went wrong.
Here's the possibilities.

1260
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:35,920
You're not looking at the world,
right?

1261
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:38,350
So it's actually a perceptual problem,
right?

1262
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:40,870
Like gray,
for example,

1263
01:09:40,871 --> 01:09:41,704
believes that you just see the world 
just like it is because he's sort of a 

1264
01:09:43,691 --> 01:09:45,340
behaviorist.
It's full of stimuli.

1265
01:09:45,341 --> 01:09:47,230
You don't have to interpret them.
That's wrong.

1266
01:09:47,231 --> 01:09:49,510
You have to interpret them.
So if something goes wrong,

1267
01:09:49,511 --> 01:09:51,490
it might be that you're looking at 
things wrong.

1268
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:54,250
Your perceptual systems are out,
it's unlikely,

1269
01:09:54,251 --> 01:09:57,610
but sometimes that's the case,
but forget that.

1270
01:09:57,611 --> 01:09:58,444
Let's say that you're looking at the 
world correctly and you know your 

1271
01:10:01,091 --> 01:10:05,500
inferences about what went wrong,
what went wrong isn't the consequence of

1272
01:10:05,530 --> 01:10:06,363
you misperceiving.
It's a consequence of some stupid 

1273
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:10,503
problem with your stupid plan.
The problem is you don't know where the 

1274
01:10:13,721 --> 01:10:18,721
error is located and that's why I think 
there's temperament.

1275
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:22,600
Sometimes if something unexpected 
happens,

1276
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:26,350
you should really freak out.
Other times you should ignore it,

1277
01:10:26,710 --> 01:10:29,170
but you can't tell which of those is 
true right away.

1278
01:10:29,230 --> 01:10:30,063
So what happens is there's a 
distribution with a little thing 

1279
01:10:32,231 --> 01:10:33,064
happens.
Some people really get upset about it 

1280
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:35,673
and other people hardly care at all.
And sometimes the people who get really 

1281
01:10:38,321 --> 01:10:39,154
upset about it or write and sometimes 
the people who don't care at all our 

1282
01:10:41,531 --> 01:10:42,364
right.
And that's why there's variability in 

1283
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:44,614
neuroticism.

1284
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:48,790
Okay?
Now what you do when you're exploring is

1285
01:10:48,791 --> 01:10:50,920
you start to decompose your plan,
right?

1286
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:51,641
If you're,
if you,

1287
01:10:51,641 --> 01:10:52,930
if you can manage it,
if you're not.

1288
01:10:52,931 --> 01:10:55,870
So like grip my anxiety that you're 
paralyzed.

1289
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,640
Then you go into your plan and you 
think,

1290
01:10:57,641 --> 01:10:59,920
well,
am I a complete loser?

1291
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:01,960
Or is it some micro thing that's gone 
wrong?

1292
01:11:01,961 --> 01:11:04,750
And then you can start to decompose it 
and reconstruct your plant.

1293
01:11:05,170 --> 01:11:08,170
Okay?
So yeah,

1294
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:11,890
the other,
the other thing that this little diagram

1295
01:11:11,891 --> 01:11:13,230
helps you understand.
It's like,

1296
01:11:13,231 --> 01:11:15,930
look,
what happens is when you're laying out a

1297
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,250
plan,
a motivated plan,

1298
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:18,203
and the hole appears in it,
you have to figure out why you fell in 

1299
01:11:20,431 --> 01:11:22,140
the hole.
And then what you have to do is you have

1300
01:11:22,141 --> 01:11:22,974
to take that motivated plan that's kind 
of running on automatic and you have to 

1301
01:11:26,311 --> 01:11:27,630
remember what it's made out of.

1302
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,153
And so what opens up underneath you when
you've made a mistake is the complexity 

1303
01:11:32,491 --> 01:11:35,760
of the plant.
And then also potentially the complexity

1304
01:11:35,761 --> 01:11:38,400
of the world on the off chance that 
you've misperceived it,

1305
01:11:38,401 --> 01:11:39,180
right?
You're just,

1306
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:42,000
someone might say you're not 
understanding me properly,

1307
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:43,403
you know,
maybe there's something wrong with you 

1308
01:11:43,981 --> 01:11:44,814
that's interfering with the perception 
and then you have to do this massive 

1309
01:11:47,191 --> 01:11:49,560
search to try to figure out where there 
are lies.

1310
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:52,980
Now,
part of the reason I believe that people

1311
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:53,873
stick to their beliefs so hard is 
because people don't like it when the 

1312
01:11:57,091 --> 01:11:59,820
hole appears in one of their big 
abstractions,

1313
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:01,043
right?
So they've got these high order 

1314
01:12:01,771 --> 01:12:02,604
representations of the world that are 
shorthand ways of representing 

1315
01:12:05,161 --> 01:12:07,530
something.
They're sort of like axioms of faith.

1316
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:08,873
And if they,
if a hole appears in one of the axioms 

1317
01:12:10,801 --> 01:12:11,634
of faith,
then all this complexity comes rushing 

1318
01:12:13,351 --> 01:12:18,351
up and it's overwhelming.
And so people hate it when you undermine

1319
01:12:19,290 --> 01:12:22,830
one of their high order abstractions.
And so I think I told you this before,

1320
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:25,020
don't do that in relationships,
right?

1321
01:12:25,021 --> 01:12:26,940
It's best not to do it to yourself as 
well.

1322
01:12:27,690 --> 01:12:32,640
I'll start with this.
These are Medusa's and what happens when

1323
01:12:32,641 --> 01:12:35,200
you see the Medusa?
Okay?

1324
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:36,720
So what,
what might that mean?

1325
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:43,590
You Bet it's a prey response and so 
that's sort of,

1326
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:46,230
that's the sort of thing that occurs 
when

1327
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:52,050
you're moving towards your goal in your 
frame and the bottom drops out.

1328
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:52,711
It's like,
oh,

1329
01:12:52,711 --> 01:12:55,650
what's there?
You don't know.

1330
01:12:56,250 --> 01:12:58,650
So what's the logical first response?
Well,

1331
01:12:58,651 --> 01:13:00,360
if you're high in neuroticism,
it's going to be this,

1332
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:01,423
you know,
freeze,

1333
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:02,753
and then,
and only then if nothing else terrible 

1334
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:06,414
happens to you,
you'll start to relax a bit and then 

1335
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:08,873
maybe you'll start to investigate the 
structure of your plan and maybe you'll 

1336
01:13:11,041 --> 01:13:12,810
start to investigate the structure of 
the world.

1337
01:13:13,170 --> 01:13:15,540
And then from a constructivist 
perspective,

1338
01:13:15,541 --> 01:13:17,010
say,
once you start to do that,

1339
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:17,963
you gather information from the world 
and then you remake your plan and you 

1340
01:13:21,211 --> 01:13:23,850
remake your conception of the world and 
then you could move on.

1341
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:28,410
So you do that under the guidance of the
positive and the negative emotions.

1342
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:29,700
Okay,
that's good.

1343
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:31,920
We'll see you Tuesday.
