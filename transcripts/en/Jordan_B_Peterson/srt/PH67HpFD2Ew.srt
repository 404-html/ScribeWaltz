1
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,263
So

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,680
was a couple of things I want to tell 
you about today.

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,020
Many things I want to tell you about.

4
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,850
I want to tell you,
um,

5
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,330
give you a schema that's going to enable
you to understand.

6
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,523
I think it will enable you to understand
stories like the one I told you last 

7
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:26,334
time you remember Jonah and the whale.
I want to provide you with this Schema 

8
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:33,960
so that you can understand stories like 
that.

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,300
But many,
many more stories like that.

10
00:00:36,301 --> 00:00:38,820
And partly what I'm telling you about 
today,

11
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:44,350
in some sense our archetypes and there's
a vr and an archetype isn't,

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,953
it's an idea that was made most popular 
over the last hundred years by Carl 

13
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,900
Young,
but it's a much older idea that not,

14
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,300
it's really a platonic ideas.
And in some ways,

15
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:57,150
and it means it means something like 
fundamental pattern.

16
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,270
And so an architect can manifest itself 
in different ways.

17
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:02,340
It could be a pattern of emotional 
response.

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,110
So that could be something that you're 
feeling.

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,160
It could be the way that that emotional 
response displays itself on your body,

20
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:08,994
on your face.

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,953
It could be the way that that emotion 
fields and displays itself on your face 

22
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:19,560
and then plays itself out as a drama in 
your local environment.

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,190
So like an angry argument is an 
architect will phenomenon.

24
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,530
And the reason it's archetipal is 
because,

25
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,130
well,
you have one them,

26
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,600
you have them,
you have them,

27
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:32,490
you have them,
everyone has them.

28
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,220
And so you can't really think about them
as individual.

29
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:38,250
You have to think about them as 
universal and you can't think about them

30
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:42,120
as something that you create in a sense,
although in a sense you do,

31
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,550
but also as something that happens to 
you.

32
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,373
Now,
when you read about young and 

33
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,083
archetypes,
it's quite confusing because you can 

34
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:53,520
never be sure whether he's talking about
an instinct and emotion,

35
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,533
a motivational system or a 
subpersonality or the subpersonality 

36
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,160
within which those things manifest 
itself,

37
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:02,994
or even the social drama that's being 
played out in time and space in the 

38
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:06,744
social world.

39
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,643
But our real archetype,
I would say is all of those things at 

40
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:09,774
the same time.
Now we use archetipal means of 

41
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:13,584
expression to represent how we act.
And that's not the same thing as resent 

42
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,220
representing what the world is made out 
of.

43
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,860
It's a very different thing and so you 
could say in some sense,

44
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,730
we tell stories and understand stories 
so that we can figure out how people act

45
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:27,564
and how they should act and then we 
conduct science so that we can figure 

46
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:30,864
out what the world's like from a 
material objective perspective and the 

47
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:35,064
two things coexist on easily.
I think the more primary form of 

48
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:39,294
knowledge is actually how to act with 
the scientific model nested inside it 

49
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:43,974
because it's the most important question
that you have to solve as a living 

50
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:48,420
organism isn't what the world is made 
out of.

51
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,400
It's how you should act in the world,
say from a Darwinian perspective even so

52
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:55,590
that you can live long enough to 
reproduce.

53
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,650
That's basically from a strict 
biological perspective.

54
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:00,484
In some sense.
That's what you have to do in order to 

55
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:04,870
be successful.
It's kind of obvious,

56
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:05,704
first of all,
because you're not very successful if 

57
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:07,384
you just go and die.
And then of course death from a genetic 

58
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:14,410
perspective and failing to leave 
offspring are much the same thing.

59
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:19,530
So
now one of the questions might be how is

60
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:26,080
it that we conceive of the world as a 
place to act in?

61
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,113
And that's partly,
I'm going to outline a hypothesis for 

62
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:34,330
you and then explain the significance of
that hypothesis.

63
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:35,164
And the hypothesis involves the 
description of what you might consider 

64
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:43,480
constituent elements and also 
transformation processes.

65
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,240
Okay.
So as far as I can tell,

66
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,403
the constituent elements of the stories 
that we tell about how people act and 

67
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:53,980
should act our characters.
Now that makes sense,

68
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:56,260
right?
Because you really can't have a drama or

69
00:03:56,261 --> 00:03:57,670
a story without characters.

70
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:01,030
Now the thing is the characters have to 
be understandable.

71
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:06,220
And so for them to be understandable,
they sort of have to be like you or they

72
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:09,160
have to be like someone that you know,
but they have to be human.

73
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,620
But then again,
it's not exactly that they're human.

74
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:16,621
Because even when you're telling a story
about what happened to you today,

75
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,780
it's interesting to think about what you
do.

76
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,550
So someone might say,
well,

77
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,680
how was your day?
And you say,

78
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:26,560
fine.
I mean maybe that's the lowest level,

79
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:30,580
lowest resolution,
highest abstract story.

80
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:33,670
My Day was fine.
It's pretty boring story.

81
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,440
It's better than terrible,
I suppose,

82
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,274
but it's,
it's not interesting and it's not 

83
00:04:37,181 --> 00:04:38,014
detailed,
but person gets the notion that things 

84
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:45,340
went according to what according to plan
or more specifically the things unfolded

85
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:46,174
the way he wanted them to,
just not exactly the same as according 

86
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:52,390
to plan because a plan is kind of a cold
cognitive thing,

87
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:53,440
you know,
or or,

88
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,150
or expectation,
expectation.

89
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,620
The cognitive scientists sort of use 
weather well while what you,

90
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,483
how you wanted them to implies that you 
have desires and emotions and 

91
00:05:03,581 --> 00:05:04,414
motivations and that they inform the way
that you're acting in the world because 

92
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:08,344
you don't just act in the world,
you act in the world so that you've 

93
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:13,210
tried to turn it into something better 
than it is right now.

94
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,520
Assuming you have any sense,
you know,

95
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:18,640
because some people act on the world to 
make it worse than it is now,

96
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:20,680
but we're going to forget about those 
people for now.

97
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,530
So when you say find someone,
you basically say,

98
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,233
roughly speaking,
I got what I wanted today without undue 

99
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,350
hassle.
Okay.

100
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:35,250
So
that's a really condensed version of the

101
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:38,680
events of the day.
And it's not a very good story,

102
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,950
although it might suffice for casual 
conversation.

103
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,361
Person might say,
no,

104
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:43,790
no,
no.

105
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,980
What did you do today?

106
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,490
And then maybe you'll say,
oh,

107
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:50,920
I woke up this morning and I went to 
university.

108
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:51,790
And uh,
you know,

109
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:55,360
the subway took a lot longer than it 
usually does.

110
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:56,440
And so,
you know,

111
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:59,440
I used that to do some studying and then
I got to school at night.

112
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,870
I particularly don't lecture,
but lunch was really good and I met some

113
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:05,240
friends.
And so that's kind of a story,

114
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:06,530
right?
And you,

115
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,110
the person that you're talking to do,
might listen to you.

116
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:11,750
It's not a particularly compelling 
story,

117
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:15,050
but it's probably better than fine.
And you might say,

118
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:15,884
well,
why did you select those elements to 

119
00:06:17,121 --> 00:06:19,100
talk about?
You know,

120
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:22,100
you didn't talk about how many times you
blinked your eyes.

121
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,173
The,
the first minute that you woke up and 

122
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:28,190
you didn't describe the motor movements 
that you use to put your left leg on the

123
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:29,024
floor and you didn't describe,
you know what bowl you used for 

124
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:34,010
breakfast.

125
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,230
And the reason you didn't do that is 
because a,

126
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:38,660
you don't remember for whatever reason,
and B,

127
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,910
you don't care and neither does have 
your listener.

128
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:41,744
But that's the peculiar things that your
listener is going to care about some 

129
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:48,230
things and not care about other things.
And if you're a good storyteller,

130
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,183
you kind of automatically know which of 
those things that you should talk about 

131
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,563
so that you're interested in which of 
the things you should ignore it so that 

132
00:06:55,761 --> 00:06:57,470
you're not boring your listener to 
death.

133
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,010
And you also understand that they will 
also understand them,

134
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,293
but you don't know how you do that.
All you know is that you're trying to 

135
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:05,774
tell an interesting story.
And in some sense what you're doing is 

136
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:09,464
you're trying to reduce a sequence of 
actions and conceptions of exceptional 

137
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:17,570
complexity to the just right,
which is like the essential or the moral

138
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:18,410
in some sense.

139
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,860
And you're trying to convey that.
And the other person is listening partly

140
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:23,840
because they want to indicate that they 
care for you.

141
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:24,883
And we'd like to know,
they want to stay caught up with your 

142
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:29,420
ongoing narrative so that they 
understand you.

143
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,480
And maybe also because they might think 
that they'll garner some,

144
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,780
you know,
bit of information factual or behavioral

145
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:38,060
that might aid them in some way,
you know,

146
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:38,894
so,
and we're doing that to each other all 

147
00:07:39,861 --> 00:07:40,694
the time and we automatically do this.
We automatically know how to tell 

148
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:43,724
stories.
And so what I'm saying is that even the 

149
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:46,034
person that you describe when you 
describe yourself to someone else isn't 

150
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:50,354
exactly you.
It's some representation of you as a 

151
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:58,130
sort of generic human being that's going
about doing certain kinds of interesting

152
00:07:58,131 --> 00:07:58,964
things in the world.
Or here's a way of thinking about it 

153
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:04,460
roughly is that you make yourself the 
hero of your own story.

154
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:06,883
And so you kind of know that because 
when you go to a movie and movies are 

155
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:12,050
usually romances,
say or hero stories,

156
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,960
we'll romances or adventures or both,
roughly speaking.

157
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,280
Um,
you know,

158
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,730
and sometimes they turn out well and 
that's a comedy and sometimes they don't

159
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:21,350
turn out so well.
And that's a tragedy.

160
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,483
But when you go there,
what you basically see as a story about 

161
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,873
another person who sort of like you,
who's the hero and what you do is you 

162
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:31,160
track them through a sequence of 
adventures.

163
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:31,994
And usually what you track them through 
isn't things were good and then they 

164
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:36,854
stayed good.
And then at the end they were still the 

165
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,550
same as they were at the beginning.
And good.

166
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:44,090
You know,
because why do you want to watch that?

167
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,013
And you might say,
well you should because isn't that 

168
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:47,144
pleasant?
The person's happy and then they stay 

169
00:08:48,681 --> 00:08:51,290
happy and then they end happy and 
everyone's happy.

170
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,000
It's why.
Why isn't that interesting?

171
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,223
But it isn't.
And really what want to see is you 

172
00:08:56,611 --> 00:08:59,220
either see,
you want to see someone get into trouble

173
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:01,950
and fail in a spectacularly interesting 
way,

174
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,023
or you want to see someone get into 
trouble and then overcome it in a 

175
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:10,410
spectacularly interesting way.
And so there's this idea in the,

176
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,543
in the story that the person has to 
undergo some kind of transformation in 

177
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:19,530
the midst of their travails and efforts 
in order for it to be interesting.

178
00:09:19,531 --> 00:09:23,940
So they have to start in one place,
they have to end up somewhere that's not

179
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:26,130
so good in a very,
very complicated way.

180
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:27,143
And then maybe by transforming nerve,
their character by transforming the 

181
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:34,270
surroundings are bread coming to some 
sort of realization or maybe just by dim

182
00:09:34,271 --> 00:09:35,104
wit and luck,
they managed to solve the set of 

183
00:09:36,961 --> 00:09:39,690
problems that emerge triumphant at the 
other end.

184
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,013
All right,
so that's the meaning of Jonah and the 

185
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:47,040
whale.
Or you remember what happens to Jonah is

186
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:50,430
that he's got this destiny he supposed 
to be pursuing.

187
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,640
Any decides that it's too much trouble?
Well,

188
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,970
not unsurprisingly,
because if you remember what he was told

189
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,970
to do was go to tale a whole city that 
they were misbehaving,

190
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,133
assuming rightly as he did that that 
would not make him pretty particularly 

191
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:07,370
park popular and maybe he'd get killed 
and even if he didn't,

192
00:10:07,371 --> 00:10:09,360
it would be extraordinarily difficult.
He thought,

193
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:10,194
there's no damn way I'm doing that.
So he denied his destiny and as a 

194
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,950
consequence he fell into the abyss and 
was swallowed up.

195
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:22,930
And then because he repented and decided
to carry on with what he was to carry on

196
00:10:22,931 --> 00:10:27,040
with his responsibilities,
the creature of the abyss spit them back

197
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,440
up and he got to go along his merry way.
Now you might say,

198
00:10:29,441 --> 00:10:30,274
well,
nothing like that has ever happened to 

199
00:10:30,971 --> 00:10:32,440
you,
but that's wrong.

200
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,560
Things like that happen to all the time 
and you know it.

201
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,210
So here,
here,

202
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,163
here's a couple of examples and you'll 
be able to draw all sorts of examples 

203
00:10:40,211 --> 00:10:41,080
from your own life.

204
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:42,780
Okay?

205
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:46,260
That's a story of betrayal.
For example,

206
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:51,380
maybe in one of your relatively 
uninformed

207
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:54,403
no

208
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,470
salaries,
you ended up establishing a relationship

209
00:10:57,471 --> 00:10:59,390
with someone who was really not good for
you.

210
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,273
And that might mean while they just,
it was just a bad personality match or 

211
00:11:04,221 --> 00:11:06,740
it might mean they really weren't good 
for you because you know,

212
00:11:06,741 --> 00:11:07,574
you could get pretty unlucky and you can
get tangled up with someone who's very 

213
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:10,934
deceitful and very malevolent and who 
could care less about your maybe who 

214
00:11:13,551 --> 00:11:14,384
even wants to hurt you.
And then you can establish a trusting 

215
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:18,890
relationship with them.
Or at least you trust them.

216
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:20,360
And then one day,
you know,

217
00:11:20,361 --> 00:11:23,630
you find out that they are not who they 
said they weren't.

218
00:11:23,631 --> 00:11:26,480
Or even more importantly,
they are not who you thought they were.

219
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,340
And so then maybe you're in a committed 
relationship and they'd be trey you with

220
00:11:31,341 --> 00:11:33,230
someone else.
And so then you think,

221
00:11:33,231 --> 00:11:36,080
well,
there you are at home and you're,

222
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,973
you know,
you're perfectly happy about being at 

223
00:11:37,881 --> 00:11:38,714
home and then your partner comes home 
and for one reason or now that you find 

224
00:11:40,641 --> 00:11:41,474
out that they're having an affair or 
that they'd be trained you or that 

225
00:11:44,631 --> 00:11:45,290
they'd lied to you.

226
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,210
And some other spectacularly important 
way.

227
00:11:47,211 --> 00:11:49,280
And maybe it's a lover and maybe it's a 
family member,

228
00:11:49,281 --> 00:11:51,080
maybe it's a sibling and maybe it's a 
friend,

229
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,120
whatever.
It doesn't matter.

230
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,240
And so here's the way of thinking about 
it.

231
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,433
The minute before they come home,
you're in one place and you remember a 

232
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:02,860
place isn't just a place,
right?

233
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,360
A place as a place in time.
Because we live in space time,

234
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:10,240
we live in time and place.
And what that means is you can be in the

235
00:12:10,241 --> 00:12:11,074
same place in one minute and a 
completely different place in the next 

236
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,790
minute,
even if you haven't even moved.

237
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,870
And so place is a very,
very complicated idea.

238
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,973
So you're sitting at home and you're 
watching oprah and you're perfectly 

239
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:24,964
content to do that.
And then the person comes home and the 

240
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:27,694
bottom of your world falls out and then 
all of a sudden you're not where you 

241
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:31,294
thought you were and it's a really weird
place that you are now because it's not 

242
00:12:34,271 --> 00:12:36,310
where you were,
that's for sure.

243
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,743
But you also don't know where it is 
because you don't know who that person 

244
00:12:41,441 --> 00:12:42,274
is that's in that room with you.
You don't know what your past with them 

245
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:46,683
was or what it meant or anything else 
about it because it was predicated on 

246
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,303
absolute misperceptions.
So none of your memories about those 

247
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:57,820
events are valid,
even though you have them as memories.

248
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,073
And then you have a worst problem,
which is if you're betrayed badly 

249
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:03,820
enough,
not only are you not going to understand

250
00:13:03,821 --> 00:13:05,950
your immediate past with that person,
oh,

251
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,900
and by the way,
your future's also gone.

252
00:13:07,901 --> 00:13:08,734
So that's a big problem as is.
Your presence has become radically more 

253
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:12,424
complex,
but it's worse than that because if 

254
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:16,120
you're really be trained,
you're also going to think,

255
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,800
who am I that I could be that stupid?
And then you're going to think,

256
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,040
what is a human being that they can be 
that corrupt.

257
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,743
And so not only at have has the,
have the fundamentals being kicked out 

258
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:30,034
of the substructure of your perceptions,
but your notion of what it means to be 

259
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:37,600
you and what it needs to be human 
might've been seriously disrupted.

260
00:13:37,601 --> 00:13:38,434
And you know,
the thing about that is that's a 

261
00:13:39,431 --> 00:13:40,264
nontrivial event.
People call that traumatic it didn't 

262
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,490
like and it,
and it's like a physical wound.

263
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:49,360
And in fact it has,
certainly if the trauma's great enough,

264
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:53,170
it can produce a psychophysiological 
wound because that sort of trauma,

265
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,253
a deep betrayal is a good example,
will damage your brain and maybe you'll 

266
00:13:57,611 --> 00:13:58,444
recover from it and maybe you won't.
And one of the ways that that's being 

267
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:02,914
represented forever in mythological 
stories is by being swallowed up by a 

268
00:14:07,301 --> 00:14:08,134
subterranean beast.
It's something that comes up from the 

269
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:13,660
depths and pulls you down and then 
you're in it.

270
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,420
Now why is that?
Well,

271
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,050
that's an extraordinarily complicated 
question.

272
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,420
But here,
here's the answer.

273
00:14:22,421 --> 00:14:23,254
As nearly as I can tell,
we evolved a very complicated 

274
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:31,000
neuropsychological system to signal 
alarm.

275
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,150
So that's anxiety threat,
the threat sensitive,

276
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,190
right.
And that makes us freeze for example.

277
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:40,330
And when you look at how an animal uses 
that system,

278
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:41,164
let's say a mammal,
just to keep it simple cause we're all 

279
00:14:42,491 --> 00:14:44,560
mammals and so we can kind of understand
mammals.

280
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,693
So if a rabbit sees a wolf for example,
it's going to freeze so that the wolf 

281
00:14:49,871 --> 00:14:50,770
can't see it.
And if I,

282
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,693
if a rack smells a cat,
even if it has never smelled a cow in 

283
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:56,660
its whole life,
it's going to also freeze.

284
00:14:56,661 --> 00:14:57,494
And interestingly with rats,
if you put rats in a natural 

285
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,234
environment,
which means they get to help little rap 

286
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,310
dominance,
hierarchies,

287
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,980
little rat families,
they're not like little white rats,

288
00:15:06,981 --> 00:15:07,814
a logan a cage,
they're happy family rats and they've 

289
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:11,384
got their burrows and they live in their
little societies that maybe there is a 

290
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:17,840
part of their territory where they can 
go get food and they're used to that.

291
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,673
So those scary out there in the day kind
of hiding because they don't like light 

292
00:15:21,561 --> 00:15:22,394
or maybe they'll scurry out at night 
cause rats are night things and they'll 

293
00:15:24,681 --> 00:15:27,350
get their food and they'll eat it or 
bring it back or whatever they,

294
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,213
whatever they do,
share it with their family or at least 

295
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:30,854
bring it back.
Well let's say that you put a cat out 

296
00:15:32,841 --> 00:15:36,410
there or maybe you even just put it out 
there and take it away so that the place

297
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:37,244
smells like cat.
Well one of those rocks goes out there 

298
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,000
and sees that cat.
First of all,

299
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:45,560
it's going to freeze and it is not a 
happy thing because imagine you're a rat

300
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:46,603
and a thing that's four times as big as 
a lion suddenly appears on your front 

301
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:50,780
yard.
It's like,

302
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:51,770
that's rough,
man.

303
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:54,980
You're going to freeze and then you're 
going to go hike downstairs and what are

304
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:55,814
you going to do?

305
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,691
Well,
if you're a rat,

306
00:15:56,691 --> 00:15:57,524
you're going to screen for 24 hours,
which is nonstop with your little beak 

307
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:04,130
poking out of your borough so everyone 
can hear you scream.

308
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,480
And that's the same given the length of 
robots,

309
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,990
life as you screaming nonstop for two 
weeks.

310
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,363
So like that rats nervous,
it's not happy about the whole cap 

311
00:16:12,831 --> 00:16:14,210
thing.
And then maybe,

312
00:16:14,211 --> 00:16:15,044
maybe if no more cat odor happens by and
no hypervigilant rat see any more cats 

313
00:16:19,971 --> 00:16:20,804
than after it screens for two weeks.
It starts to calm down a little bit and 

314
00:16:24,771 --> 00:16:27,500
maybe then it starts to remember that 
it's hungry and that you know,

315
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,620
there's things to attend to and so then 
maybe it very,

316
00:16:30,621 --> 00:16:34,250
very carefully goes back out where it 
was foraging for food,

317
00:16:34,251 --> 00:16:35,084
sort of crouched over and hypervigilant 
and not moving very much in case that 

318
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:42,440
damn cats around.
And then maybe slowly it regains control

319
00:16:42,441 --> 00:16:43,460
over its territory.

320
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,533
It runs back and forth trying to ensure 
that none of that place that used to be 

321
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:50,930
safe has got troublesome cats associated
with it anymore.

322
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,290
And so in some sense the bottom fell out
of that box life.

323
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:55,723
Now the thing is the rat has predator 
detection systems that are associated 

324
00:17:00,081 --> 00:17:04,040
with extreme anxiety and escape.
They're automatically activated whenever

325
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:07,130
there's a Predator in site and we have 
those systems too.

326
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,590
But human beings are.
You might say,

327
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:10,940
well,
okay,

328
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,180
rats have predators,
enemies,

329
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,750
humans have predators,
entities.

330
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,100
Okay,
so then we might say,

331
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:21,770
well,
what's a human predator slash?

332
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:23,240
Enemy?
Well,

333
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:24,763
it depends on how long a period of time 
over which you wish to calculate what 

334
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:30,710
constitutes human.
Because we know,

335
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:33,260
for example,
that 60 million years ago,

336
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:36,260
your primary Predator when you were 
wandering around in trees,

337
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,930
and we're only about this big with 
snakes,

338
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,980
and so snake is a Predator and an enemy 
and you know,

339
00:17:42,981 --> 00:17:43,814
you guys can easily learn how to be 
afraid of snakes and maybe you're 

340
00:17:45,711 --> 00:17:47,870
innately afraid of them to begin with.

341
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:48,703
No one.
The science on that is not exactly 

342
00:17:50,881 --> 00:17:51,714
clear,
although it's certainly indicates that 

343
00:17:52,801 --> 00:17:53,634
you can easily learn snake fear.
And a probably indicates that really 

344
00:17:56,281 --> 00:17:58,440
it's innate.
It's innate in chimpanzees.

345
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,760
So why not?
It knocks,

346
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,380
you know,
it's not that long.

347
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:02,214
Since we split off the evolutionary 
pathway from the common chimp human 

348
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,470
ancestor,
so enemies,

349
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:08,730
snakes.
What else?

350
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,623
How about crocodiles?
Most things pulled a lot of your 

351
00:18:11,881 --> 00:18:13,980
ancestors,
well not your ancestors do.

352
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,090
They got pulled under water,
but when we were wandering around on the

353
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,100
African Veldt and we went down to the 
river to have some water,

354
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:23,280
you can be sure that a fair number of us
got pulled underneath by crocodiles.

355
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:27,120
And so crocodiles and you know,
those are creepy things.

356
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:27,871
Crocodiles,
hey,

357
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:28,704
it'd be,
they figure it nightmares and they 

358
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:30,774
figure in horror movies.
And you can imagine yourself in Florida 

359
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,120
out there with alligators.

360
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,370
And I'm thinking,
you know,

361
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,760
it'd be just as well if they didn't come
too close to your boat with their little

362
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:40,790
beady eyes.
And they're great big teeth that,

363
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,480
you know,
they're unpleasant things.

364
00:18:42,481 --> 00:18:46,380
And then there's lions,
hyenas.

365
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:47,281
Okay.
And those are,

366
00:18:47,281 --> 00:18:48,114
what are those things?
You might think a lion in a hygiene or 

367
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,940
different things,
but they're not,

368
00:18:50,941 --> 00:18:54,960
I would say they're large tooth 
mammalian carnivores.

369
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,710
It's like a medic category.
And so they sort of fit in that Predator

370
00:18:58,711 --> 00:18:59,544
enemy category.
And your nervous system is prepared to 

371
00:19:01,711 --> 00:19:02,544
respond to predatory eyes and teeth.
And no wonder because predatory eyes 

372
00:19:06,841 --> 00:19:09,180
track you down at teeth,
eat you at a bite,

373
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,014
you.
And so it's a good thing that you're 

374
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,300
aware of those and that you can detect 
them rapidly.

375
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,543
Um,

376
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:17,680
yeah.

377
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,940
What else is a human enemy?

378
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,190
How about another human?
How would that be?

379
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,580
You think more people have died from 
other humans are from predators.

380
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,131
All right.
Well,

381
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:34,680
I suspect that since we'd actually been 
human,

382
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:35,514
if that's maybe 150,000 years,
because that's about when it appears 

383
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:41,310
that we were more or less genetically 
identical to what we are now.

384
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,370
My guess is that humans have got it all 
over predators.

385
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,171
I mean,
lots of us,

386
00:19:45,171 --> 00:19:49,440
God eat and let's not be too shy about 
discussing that,

387
00:19:49,441 --> 00:19:51,360
but now at least,
man,

388
00:19:51,361 --> 00:19:52,680
it's other people.
Okay,

389
00:19:52,681 --> 00:19:55,380
well what about yourself?
How about you as your own enemy?

390
00:19:56,990 --> 00:19:59,550
Then you can make it psychological.
Maybe it's not other people may,

391
00:19:59,551 --> 00:20:03,600
but it's the evil in their hearts for 
maybe it's an evil in your hearts.

392
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,303
So you see,
so this is the way of thinking about is 

393
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,660
that we have a circuit to deal with 
threats,

394
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,590
but the threats exist all the way from 
the primordial biological,

395
00:20:13,591 --> 00:20:17,940
like actual predators like snakes all 
the way up to the incredibly abstract.

396
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,773
Like my great enemy is the evil 
intentions that other people harbored 

397
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,000
towards me or that maybe I have in my 
own heart.

398
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,253
Okay?
So that's that entire complex of 

399
00:20:27,301 --> 00:20:30,570
predatory slash threat.
Slash.

400
00:20:30,571 --> 00:20:33,060
Evil because it's become psychologists 
to that point.

401
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,730
That's one of the things that can be a 
character in a movie.

402
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,890
And it is,
right?

403
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,130
It's the antagonist.
It's the adversary that's the,

404
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,023
that's the archetypal element.
It's the thing that opposes you would 

405
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:46,680
every way.
And you can locate that and all sorts of

406
00:20:46,681 --> 00:20:47,620
different places,
right?

407
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,573
You could have a story about how someone
is grappling with their own evil 

408
00:20:51,821 --> 00:20:52,654
impulses up.
What's the name of that serial killer 

409
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:55,940
thing?
Um,

410
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,093
Dexter Dexter's got that problem.
People are pretty fascinated by that 

411
00:21:00,581 --> 00:21:01,414
show,
right?

412
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,403
A serial killer who can do good,
like sort of like a human being in some 

413
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:06,394
sense,
you know?

414
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,413
So Dexter's got this psychological 
battle between good and evil in his 

415
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:12,070
heart,
or maybe the,

416
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,040
maybe the,
the enemy is externalized.

417
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,280
So maybe it's Batman and the joker and 
the joker is a pretty,

418
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:22,210
the joker is really a figure of,
of chaotic evil fundamentally,

419
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:24,400
you know,
in the Best Batman movie,

420
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,430
which was the one with,
uh,

421
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,670
well with the joker and it wasn't Jack 
Nicholson who played the,

422
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,290
yeah,
yeah.

423
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,400
Heath Ledger,
you know,

424
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:35,200
that was rough on old heath and no 
wonder,

425
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:36,034
you know,
cause he embodied this architectural 

426
00:21:37,241 --> 00:21:41,740
character and that joker was so much of 
an adversary that he didn't even want to

427
00:21:41,741 --> 00:21:43,090
win.
Right?

428
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:45,310
You can understand the adversaries that 
want to win.

429
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,520
It's adversaries that want to make 
everyone lose,

430
00:21:48,521 --> 00:21:51,520
that are really hard to understand.
And that's part of what made that movie,

431
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,830
you know,
relatively striking and memorable.

432
00:21:53,831 --> 00:21:55,810
And he really embodied that character.
Well.

433
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,123
And so one,
here's two sets of characters that make 

434
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:01,060
up stories,
heroin,

435
00:22:01,061 --> 00:22:03,250
adversary.
Okay?

436
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,870
So,
and you can,

437
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,720
you can understand that at multiple 
levels simultaneously.

438
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,840
Um,
here's another set of characters.

439
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:11,703
Now,
here's why I think these characters are 

440
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:15,754
fundamental elements of our cognitive 
structure called a cognitive 

441
00:22:18,761 --> 00:22:19,780
substructure.
First of all,

442
00:22:19,781 --> 00:22:21,280
I think that really what we want to 
know,

443
00:22:21,281 --> 00:22:23,410
it's not what it is,
but we want to know how to act,

444
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,410
how to conduct ourselves in the world.
We're moving creatures,

445
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:27,244
right?
You don't just sit there on a rock and 

446
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,740
filter seawater through our guilt.
We have to go out there and contend with

447
00:22:32,741 --> 00:22:34,690
the world,
and so we need to know how to do that.

448
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,810
We need to know how to do it and how not
to do it.

449
00:22:37,811 --> 00:22:40,620
So we can look for good examples and we 
can look for bad examples.

450
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,733
We don't want just any old good example.
We want a good example that's boiled 

451
00:22:44,831 --> 00:22:45,664
right down to excellent example and we 
want a bad example that's boiled right 

452
00:22:48,521 --> 00:22:50,500
down to excellent,
bad example.

453
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:51,693
And so a good example would be a 
character who is an amalgam of all the 

454
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:56,014
good things about good people and an 
evil character would be an announcement 

455
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,253
of all the evil things about bad people 
and the more pure in some sense in 

456
00:23:02,861 --> 00:23:03,694
essence,
both of those characters are the more 

457
00:23:05,111 --> 00:23:07,300
architectural of the story.
And so an architectural story,

458
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:10,060
he's good versus evil.
And you might think you don't believe in

459
00:23:10,061 --> 00:23:10,894
good versus evil,
but it doesn't really matter what you 

460
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:13,930
believe.
Because when you go to movies,

461
00:23:13,931 --> 00:23:17,200
you watched that and you watch it as if 
you believe it.

462
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:20,710
And I would say this is an existential 
claim by the way,

463
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,230
is that it doesn't matter what you say 
you believe,

464
00:23:23,231 --> 00:23:27,100
because what do you know about it?
What matters is how you act out what you

465
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:27,934
believe.
And if you really want to find out what 

466
00:23:29,561 --> 00:23:32,380
you believe,
you don't ask yourself what you believe.

467
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:37,620
You Watch yourself act and you deduce 
from that what you believe.

468
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,440
And so if you don't believe,
for example,

469
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,750
in a good versus evil archetipal 
struggle,

470
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,890
then what are you doing?
Watching wars,

471
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,930
for example.
Okay.

472
00:23:47,931 --> 00:23:50,150
Because obviously that's an archetypal 
story,

473
00:23:50,151 --> 00:23:52,160
just like every partner is an archetypal
story.

474
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,980
And both of those are archetypal stories
about good versus evil.

475
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,740
Okay.
Next set of categories.

476
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:03,460
So imagine that we've been living in 
familial groups for who knows how long,

477
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:10,070
let's say 3 million years.
Just for the sake of argument.

478
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:14,030
We were living in tribal groups way,
way longer than that.

479
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:14,923
You know,
if you think about a tribal group is 

480
00:24:16,191 --> 00:24:17,024
something that might extend back farther
than chimpanzees were living in 

481
00:24:20,571 --> 00:24:23,480
dominance hierarchies for way longer 
than tribal groups.

482
00:24:23,481 --> 00:24:24,314
But the family group,
you got to think we'd be living in 

483
00:24:27,351 --> 00:24:28,184
family groups for about as long as we've
been extraordinarily dependent as 

484
00:24:31,911 --> 00:24:35,210
infants and as long as we've had really 
large brains.

485
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,590
And so again,
that's,

486
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:38,830
you can't draw,
you know,

487
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,240
pipe line.
But because we'd been getting bigger and

488
00:24:41,241 --> 00:24:44,330
bigger brains for quite a long time,
but it's,

489
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:46,490
it's in the millions of years,
let's say.

490
00:24:46,491 --> 00:24:49,640
And so,
and the other thing that you might think

491
00:24:49,641 --> 00:24:52,520
about is that you know,
your cognitive apparatus,

492
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:53,354
your perceptual apparatus,
you're emotional apparatus has 

493
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,043
originated within an environment.
Obviously now we tend to think of the 

494
00:24:59,721 --> 00:25:03,140
environment as the natural environment 
and then we tend to think of the natural

495
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:03,974
environment is like a forest.
But the natural environment for 

496
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,633
propriety,
nate's say is only for us to some 

497
00:25:09,561 --> 00:25:10,580
degree.
I mean,

498
00:25:10,581 --> 00:25:11,414
first of all we,
we didn't just dwell in forests because 

499
00:25:13,131 --> 00:25:16,520
we were also veldt dwelling creatures.
But also we,

500
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,290
we didn't really dwell among trees.
We dwelled among other primates like us.

501
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,860
And so our primary environment is 
actually other people.

502
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,690
And then you might say,
okay,

503
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:29,840
what are the fundamental categories of 
the other people?

504
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,180
Well,
how about mother?

505
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,500
That's a big one because the probability
that you had a mother,

506
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:38,240
it's like it's up there at about a 
hundred percent you know?

507
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:40,370
And if there wasn't,
even if you're,

508
00:25:40,371 --> 00:25:43,190
if you lost your biological mother at 
birth,

509
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,850
if someone didn't fulfill the archetipal
role of mother,

510
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:49,000
then you don't live.
And that,

511
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:51,890
that doesn't just mean providing you 
with food and water and shelter.

512
00:25:51,891 --> 00:25:52,724
Because if you provide a child under f 
one with food and water and shelter and 

513
00:25:56,631 --> 00:25:58,040
that's it,
they die.

514
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,920
You have to pick them up.
You have to touch them,

515
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,580
you have to rock the back and forth.
You have to communicate with them.

516
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,400
If you don't give them physical 
attention,

517
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,860
their nervous systems shut down and they
die.

518
00:26:09,861 --> 00:26:14,861
And so that's part of the reason why in 
well in eastern European orphanages,

519
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:18,350
orphanages before the wall fell down,
the death rate,

520
00:26:18,351 --> 00:26:21,530
especially in places like Romania in the
orphanages,

521
00:26:21,531 --> 00:26:24,350
it's an awful story,
was unbelievably high.

522
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,183
And if the kids didn't die,
they were just so crippled 

523
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:28,310
psychologically that they never 
recovered.

524
00:26:28,311 --> 00:26:31,040
And that was because people didn't touch
them and didn't interact with them.

525
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,293
And so you need a creature playing out 
the architectural role of mother to 

526
00:26:37,731 --> 00:26:40,730
entice you into life.
Otherwise you just perish.

527
00:26:40,731 --> 00:26:42,710
So mother,
that's a category man.

528
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,190
And then,
well for others,

529
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,050
the category two,
and it's the same thing,

530
00:26:46,051 --> 00:26:48,450
applies there.
And even if you don't have a farther,

531
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:51,450
there's a male power structure around 
you,

532
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,370
a dominance heart,
they roughly speaking,

533
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,473
that acts in the paternal role.
And there's no getting away from that 

534
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:02,430
unless you don't live in a society.
And then if you don't live in a society,

535
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:04,740
then you just died because you can't 
live by yourself.

536
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:08,730
So father and mother are primary 
categories.

537
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:12,420
And then there's the primary category of
the individual because wherever you are,

538
00:27:12,421 --> 00:27:13,350
there you are.

539
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,950
And that's been the case for every human
being that's ever existed.

540
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,040
So the fundamental categories are 
individual,

541
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,890
mother and father.
Well,

542
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,140
and there's another fundamental category
which we alluded to,

543
00:27:25,141 --> 00:27:29,040
which is horrible thing that lives at 
the bottom of a pit that will devour you

544
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:32,100
and that has a psychological reality and
uh,

545
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,960
objective reality.
And that's,

546
00:27:33,961 --> 00:27:34,794
as I said,
that's equivalent to the story of Jonah 

547
00:27:36,241 --> 00:27:38,460
being gobbled up by the whale that 
happens.

548
00:27:38,461 --> 00:27:39,294
That sort of stories.
Very Comic Pinocchio is a story like 

549
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:42,534
that,
right?

550
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:47,310
Pinocchio has an existential problem.
He doesn't know how to be a real boy.

551
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,890
And it turns out that in order to become
a real boy,

552
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,980
we might regard that as a fully 
developed individual.

553
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,230
He has to go down to the bottom of the 
ocean,

554
00:27:55,290 --> 00:28:00,290
into a whale and rescue his father.
Well you,

555
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,853
it doesn't take a lot of imagination to 
see the kinship between that story and 

556
00:28:05,881 --> 00:28:06,840
the story of Jonah.

557
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,033
It's the same story.
Jonah had to reestablish his 

558
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:11,004
relationship with God the father in 
order to successfully make a passage 

559
00:28:15,241 --> 00:28:16,074
from aimless and disobedient character 
to someone who was alive on shore and 

560
00:28:21,481 --> 00:28:24,510
pursuing a particular tie.
It's the same motif.

561
00:28:24,511 --> 00:28:25,231
It's a very,
very,

562
00:28:25,231 --> 00:28:26,064
very common motif.
And the reason for that is that actual 

563
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,760
people transform,
you know,

564
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:32,643
when they hit an obstacle of some sort 
that just blows them into pieces and 

565
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:40,710
they go down into the depths,
into the abyss and they are,

566
00:28:40,711 --> 00:28:43,590
they lived down there for a while and 
it's not pleasant.

567
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:44,963
And maybe they learn something while 
they're down there if they're lucky and 

568
00:28:46,921 --> 00:28:47,754
they get back up.
And that's the story of human 

569
00:28:49,351 --> 00:28:52,500
development.
You never learn something without having

570
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:53,334
something small die.
And sometimes you learn something and 

571
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:56,634
something big dies and then you know,
you put yourself back together and you 

572
00:29:00,061 --> 00:29:03,060
pick up the pieces and you emerge 
unscathed,

573
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:03,923
hopefully,
and perhaps transformed and you carry 

574
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:05,490
on.

575
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,323
And so the human developmental story 
isn't an upward march in a linear 

576
00:29:11,371 --> 00:29:12,390
manner.
You know,

577
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:15,900
upon even slope it's perhaps upwards and
onwards.

578
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:18,990
But it's like this,
it's punctuated by catastrophes.

579
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:22,200
And of course you guys know that because
obviously,

580
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,400
I mean,
how many times,

581
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,263
how many people in this room have been 
seriously unhappy at one point in their 

582
00:29:27,691 --> 00:29:30,990
life for more than two weeks.
Okay.

583
00:29:30,991 --> 00:29:34,620
Is there anyone who hasn't had that 
experience breathing?

584
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:37,500
Yes.
Have you not had that experience?

585
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,761
Oh yeah.
Oh,

586
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:40,080
sorry.
I thought you raised your hand.

587
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:44,650
Has Anybody not had that experience?
Okay.

588
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:46,780
Okay.
So maybe not you.

589
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:49,870
Well that's good.
Congratulations.

590
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:50,770
That's really amazing.

591
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,900
So it's coming,
so,

592
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,180
yeah.
Yeah.

593
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,733
So,

594
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,080
so the thing is,
you know,

595
00:30:03,081 --> 00:30:04,790
here,
here's one way of looking at it.

596
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:09,170
That's reality.
Reality is that you're,

597
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,190
you're environment is punctuated by 
descents.

598
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:17,090
Your pathways punctuated by descents.
And when you're asked sending,

599
00:30:17,091 --> 00:30:17,924
that's one place.
And when you're descending and at the 

600
00:30:20,811 --> 00:30:22,130
bottom,
that's another place.

601
00:30:22,131 --> 00:30:22,964
And I can tell you,
and this will help you with your 

602
00:30:24,171 --> 00:30:26,530
interpretation of stories,
is that the,

603
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,320
the times when you descend is equivalent
to a voyage.

604
00:30:30,321 --> 00:30:31,154
To the underworld.
That's what a voyage to the underworld 

605
00:30:33,021 --> 00:30:33,854
means in mythology.
The bottom has fallen out and down you 

606
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:38,390
go.
And you know this sort of thing,

607
00:30:38,391 --> 00:30:41,090
because look,
if I say we're all skating on thin ice,

608
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,490
like is there anybody here who doesn't 
know what that means?

609
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,380
Okay.
So what does it mean?

610
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:51,170
What does it mean
the ice could the daily,

611
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,950
right?
The ice can fall out in anytime and then

612
00:30:54,951 --> 00:30:55,784
what happens?

613
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,580
Yeah.
Down you go.

614
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,290
Right.
And it's cold down there.

615
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,880
Yeah.
And maybe you don't get back up.

616
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,463
Yeah.
And it's the sort of story that sort of 

617
00:31:04,521 --> 00:31:07,340
sends a chill down your spine.
And it should,

618
00:31:07,341 --> 00:31:08,174
because that's life.
And so one of the things that I already 

619
00:31:11,211 --> 00:31:14,900
like about advanced personality theory 
is that it takes that into account.

620
00:31:14,901 --> 00:31:15,291
It says,
yeah,

621
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:16,130
yeah,
that's life.

622
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,380
Okay,
now that we've established that,

623
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,383
what do we do?
And so then it becomes something like 

624
00:31:22,941 --> 00:31:23,774
this.
It's not so much how do you stop 

625
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:30,020
yourself from descending and ascending?
Cause good luck with that.

626
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:33,290
But since you're going to have to do 
that,

627
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,333
how do you do it?
And so part of the reason that I called 

628
00:31:36,681 --> 00:31:40,330
this course personality and its 
transformations is because one,

629
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,160
one thing that you can learn about 
yourself as who you are,

630
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,270
and that's really useful.

631
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:48,170
But the other thing that you can learn 
about yourself is how it is that you can

632
00:31:48,171 --> 00:31:49,004
conduct yourself across time.
And that means you're going to have to 

633
00:31:52,431 --> 00:31:55,160
conduct yourself so that you can weather
storms.

634
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:58,340
And some of those might be you make a 
mistake in the ice breaks,

635
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,160
you know?
And some of it is,

636
00:32:00,161 --> 00:32:00,994
yeah,
the ice breaks and it's no mistake at 

637
00:32:03,111 --> 00:32:04,970
all.
It's just how it is,

638
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,223
you know?
So when you're one of your parents 

639
00:32:07,101 --> 00:32:09,140
develops Alzheimer's disease for 
example,

640
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,093
well you can say that's your mistake 
because you're not smart enough to do 

641
00:32:12,051 --> 00:32:13,370
anything about it,
then you know,

642
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:18,140
be a better clue in because otherwise 
the disease is going to continue.

643
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,093
But on the other hand,
really thinking about it as a personal 

644
00:32:21,111 --> 00:32:21,944
fault seems inappropriate.
It's just a catastrophe that's 

645
00:32:24,711 --> 00:32:27,860
associated with being alive.
And that's what life is,

646
00:32:27,861 --> 00:32:28,100
you know?

647
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,990
And so one of the things you see,
for example,

648
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:33,860
in all of the major trends of religious 
thinking all around the world,

649
00:32:33,861 --> 00:32:34,694
and I talk about religious thinking 
because those are the deepest kinds of 

650
00:32:37,101 --> 00:32:38,870
stories.
That's really what makes them,

651
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,570
by the way,
it's always the same message.

652
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:42,523
Life is suffering.
And the reason for that is because we 

653
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:46,520
skate on thin ice.
Okay?

654
00:32:46,521 --> 00:32:47,241
And you can say,
well,

655
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:49,550
we should pick it up the damn ice and 
fair enough,

656
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:50,330
you know?
Right.

657
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,163
Definitely.
But you should also prepare yourself to 

658
00:32:53,001 --> 00:32:55,580
swim so that when you fall in,
you don't die.

659
00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:00,860
So now the job story has a hint or two 
in it,

660
00:33:00,861 --> 00:33:01,694
you know?
So the first thing that happens is job 

661
00:33:03,801 --> 00:33:05,870
is in some sense called the action.
Now,

662
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,033
because that's an old story because it's
a primarily Judeo Christian and 

663
00:33:09,471 --> 00:33:12,680
religious story.
The call cause action takes the force of

664
00:33:12,681 --> 00:33:14,720
a divine command.
Right?

665
00:33:14,721 --> 00:33:15,800
Now you might think,
well,

666
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,693
there's such a thing exist.
And it's a silly question in some ways 

667
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:25,631
because whether or not something exists 
depends on what you mean by exist,

668
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,103
you know?
And that can vary with your 

669
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,520
philosophical presuppositions.
But it also,

670
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:32,683
it also varies on why you're asking the 
question and where you're looking for 

671
00:33:36,021 --> 00:33:38,120
the answer.
So for example,

672
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,740
here's an example.

673
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:45,740
Do you believe that there are things 
that you should do?

674
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:47,950
Okay,

675
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:49,700
thank you.
Is there anyone here who doesn't believe

676
00:33:49,701 --> 00:33:51,570
that?
Or more importantly,

677
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:53,990
is there anyone here who doesn't act 
like they believe it?

678
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,680
So you wake up in the morning and you 
think,

679
00:33:55,681 --> 00:33:58,320
God,
there's a bunch of things I should do or

680
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,810
there's some things I should do next 
week.

681
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:01,970
Aren't there some things I should do 
with my life?

682
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,130
Yes.
That's a common thought.

683
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:07,810
Does anyone not think that way?
Okay.

684
00:34:07,811 --> 00:34:09,430
So you know,
if you're not thinking that way,

685
00:34:09,431 --> 00:34:11,410
you end up pretty depressed because then
you think,

686
00:34:11,411 --> 00:34:12,244
well,
there's nothing I should do with my 

687
00:34:12,671 --> 00:34:13,504
life.
And that's not such a happy thought 

688
00:34:14,921 --> 00:34:15,754
because life is hard.
And then if there's nothing to do with 

689
00:34:17,201 --> 00:34:18,034
this wall all year,
they're stuck with is a bunch of 

690
00:34:20,111 --> 00:34:22,690
suffering and that doesn't seem like a 
very good idea.

691
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,220
Okay.
So then you might say,

692
00:34:24,221 --> 00:34:26,140
well,
what exactly does should mean?

693
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:29,763
Well,
it means that you have a moral 

694
00:34:30,341 --> 00:34:32,260
obligation of some sort.
You might say,

695
00:34:32,261 --> 00:34:33,094
well,
you decided that yourself and answer 

696
00:34:36,071 --> 00:34:37,240
that.
It's like no,

697
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,220
wrong.
You haven't decided that you yourself,

698
00:34:39,221 --> 00:34:40,054
are you kidding?
You'd be at a complete psychopath if 

699
00:34:41,831 --> 00:34:44,080
you'd decided that by yourself,
right?

700
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:46,920
I mean,
if you're even the Vegas civilized,

701
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:52,140
then you decide what it is that you 
should do or what you should do manifest

702
00:34:52,221 --> 00:34:53,054
itself within you as a context of a 
dialogue that you're continually having 

703
00:34:56,531 --> 00:34:59,200
with yourself,
but also with everyone around you.

704
00:34:59,201 --> 00:35:01,330
And not only only with everyone around 
you,

705
00:35:01,331 --> 00:35:04,130
but with the entire kit history of 
mankind.

706
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:07,930
Because we're all historical creatures.
And you know,

707
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:11,560
what you think you should do is being 
shaped by what your parents think.

708
00:35:11,561 --> 00:35:13,840
And there that was shaped by what their 
parents thought,

709
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,030
that was shaped by what their parents 
thought.

710
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:16,863
And so on,
back into the depths of history as far 

711
00:35:20,261 --> 00:35:23,860
back as you can possibly imagine,
both historically and biologically.

712
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:28,390
So in some sense there is a call to 
action within people now,

713
00:35:28,391 --> 00:35:30,430
you know,
in any sort of quest story,

714
00:35:30,431 --> 00:35:32,050
like the Hobbit,
let's say,

715
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,173
um,
or the Lord of the rings for that 

716
00:35:34,421 --> 00:35:35,380
matter.
You know,

717
00:35:35,381 --> 00:35:38,280
the story always starts with,
with a call to action,

718
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,170
right?
For some reason or another,

719
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:42,630
the little hobbit character,
which by the way is you,

720
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,483
you know,
the hobbits live in this little 

721
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:44,874
protected place and they're not very big
and they're not very smart and they 

722
00:35:47,671 --> 00:35:49,560
don't know about the wide world beyond 
them,

723
00:35:49,561 --> 00:35:52,110
where the great forces of good and evil 
are at combat.

724
00:35:52,111 --> 00:35:56,490
And one hobbit who's a little bit more 
adventurous than the rest gets called to

725
00:35:56,491 --> 00:35:58,770
act,
gets called upon to act.

726
00:35:58,771 --> 00:36:00,270
And in,
in the heartbeat stories,

727
00:36:00,271 --> 00:36:02,010
it's usually the wizard who manages it,
right?

728
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:02,843
So it's a magical figure of some sort 
who's extraordinarily wise and 

729
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,653
extraordinarily old,
who might as well be gone for all 

730
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:10,440
intents and purposes,
who says,

731
00:36:10,441 --> 00:36:11,274
you know,
it's time for you to go and become a 

732
00:36:12,661 --> 00:36:13,530
thief.
Well,

733
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,000
that's what happens in the Hobbit,
right?

734
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:19,230
It's very weird thing because obviously 
that's Frodo,

735
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:20,483
right?
Photos,

736
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,650
the hobbit in,
in the hobbit.

737
00:36:22,651 --> 00:36:24,420
And Bilbo is the hobbit and the Lord of 
the rings,

738
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,373
if I remember correctly,
the way around Bilbo is the hobbit in 

739
00:36:28,171 --> 00:36:29,550
the hobbit.
Fine Bill.

740
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:30,803
Okay,
so bill will gets called to action and 

741
00:36:33,301 --> 00:36:34,134
he's gonna go,
he's gonna go find a dragon while the 

742
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:39,330
dragon is the same thing.
That swallow joke,

743
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,570
it's the same story and the Jew and the 
dragon has a treasure,

744
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,910
which is a weird thing.
It's like what's up with dragons,

745
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,080
right?
What did they hoard?

746
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,960
Virgin.
That's the Saint George Story.

747
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,620
It's a very,
very old story or goal.

748
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:55,500
And that's weird behavior for a 
predatory lizard.

749
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,020
But anyways,
you accept that without any problems.

750
00:36:58,021 --> 00:36:58,854
Of course,
a dragon lives underground and a big 

751
00:36:59,971 --> 00:37:02,820
mountain that was excavated by doors and
sits on the treasure.

752
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:03,953
It's like we go to,
we don't have any problem with that 

753
00:37:04,951 --> 00:37:06,000
idea.
Well,

754
00:37:06,001 --> 00:37:08,280
why fate?
I mean really,

755
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,190
you really believe that and answer as 
well.

756
00:37:11,191 --> 00:37:13,350
Well enough to read the damn book and to
make the,

757
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,393
I mean,
how many people went and watched the 

758
00:37:15,391 --> 00:37:18,170
Lord of the Rings?
How many people?

759
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,343
And think about it worldwide.
How much money did a Harry Potter 

760
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:25,110
generate?
You know,

761
00:37:25,111 --> 00:37:25,944
I bet you a Harry Potter generated more 
money then the remaining steel mills in 

762
00:37:30,121 --> 00:37:30,954
Britain,
if you calculated across the amount of 

763
00:37:34,261 --> 00:37:36,960
time since those stories emerged.
Right.

764
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,460
So of course there's a lizard in a 
predatory lizard and Harry Potter too.

765
00:37:41,461 --> 00:37:42,294
It's the thing that skitters around 
underneath hogwarts and turns you to 

766
00:37:44,311 --> 00:37:46,260
stone with the glance of an eye.
Oh,

767
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,530
and does that Lizard Hoard Virgins?

768
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:50,690
Okay.

769
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:53,360
Well what's the name of the woman that 
the girl that he,

770
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:57,290
uh,
kidnaps Jenny.

771
00:37:57,830 --> 00:37:58,663
Right.
Okay.

772
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:02,480
What's the word?
Ginny from Virginia.

773
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,330
Right.
Good.

774
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,713
Good.
She's Harry's first love interest and 

775
00:38:09,111 --> 00:38:09,944
he,
he rescues her from the damn snake and 

776
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:14,250
he gets parallels,
won't paralyzed while he's doing it.

777
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,620
What rescues Harry.

778
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,190
Okay.

779
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,570
Phoenix.
Right?

780
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,770
A Phoenix.
Okay.

781
00:38:21,771 --> 00:38:24,590
So the bass of this cause bites Harry 
and so he's going to die.

782
00:38:24,591 --> 00:38:26,570
The Phoenix comes along.
Who owns the Phoenix?

783
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,910
Dumbledore.
Yeah.

784
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,470
Yeah.
What does the Phoenix do?

785
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,940
Cries and cries into Harry's wounds.
Yes.

786
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,570
But what happens then?
What happens to Harry?

787
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:41,230
He comes back to life,
death and resurrection story.

788
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:42,483
So the thing that's willing to die and 
resurrect is the thing that gets the 

789
00:38:45,821 --> 00:38:47,740
virgin from the snake.
It's like,

790
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,053
does that make sense?
Well you think it makes sense even 

791
00:38:52,691 --> 00:38:54,550
though you don't really know why it 
makes sense.

792
00:38:54,551 --> 00:38:55,384
And then what happens to the,
what happens to the Phoenix after it 

793
00:38:57,121 --> 00:38:57,954
does that
Burns itself up in a puff of flame and 

794
00:39:02,801 --> 00:39:05,410
is reborn.
So it's the story told twice.

795
00:39:05,411 --> 00:39:08,620
The thing that dies in his reporting is 
the thing that conquers the,

796
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:14,030
the serpentine and rescues the feminine,
roughly speaking.

797
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:18,520
So it's not gold in that situation,
but it doesn't matter.

798
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:20,620
It's the same story.
It's always the same story.

799
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,380
So,
and when you don't hear that story,

800
00:39:23,381 --> 00:39:27,190
like when your culture isn't providing 
you with rich stories of that sort,

801
00:39:27,191 --> 00:39:29,170
that are derived directly from your 
tradition.

802
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,213
Somebody like an unemployed welfare 
mother in Britain has it pop up full 

803
00:39:34,511 --> 00:39:35,344
fledged in her brilliant imagination and
lays out seven books and makes herself 

804
00:39:38,351 --> 00:39:40,990
more money than the queen.
Right?

805
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:41,801
Right.
And that,

806
00:39:41,801 --> 00:39:43,120
you know,
it's a cinderella story.

807
00:39:43,121 --> 00:39:46,690
It's a bloody amazing story.
And then there's all those books and all

808
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,490
those kids learn to read because of the 
books.

809
00:39:48,491 --> 00:39:49,324
And then there's all those movies and 
everybody goes and sees them and no one 

810
00:39:51,491 --> 00:39:52,324
notices that they don't know what the 
hell they're doing while they're doing 

811
00:39:54,341 --> 00:39:56,740
it.
And it follows the same old story.

812
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,153
All right?
So you've got your individual that's 

813
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:02,014
you,
the hero,

814
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,000
then you got the adversary to that.

815
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,700
That's your enemy.
Wherever that enemy might happen to me,

816
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,310
that's the forces that oppose oppose 
you,

817
00:40:09,311 --> 00:40:11,770
but mostly psychological forces of one 
form or another.

818
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:14,110
Then you've got the father.
Well,

819
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,973
there's two kinds of fathers.
What kind of good fathers and bad 

820
00:40:19,511 --> 00:40:21,640
fathers?
So here's an example.

821
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:25,840
Um,
the lion king,

822
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:29,080
so the lion king as a father,
right?

823
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:30,623
Uh,
the Fossa and the Fossa has a brother 

824
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,380
who his brother scar.
And what's up with scar?

825
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:39,483
Not a pleasant guy.
Partly maybe because he's scarred 

826
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,240
something's hat.
Well,

827
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:44,343
really he's kind of skinny.
He said he came from the shallow end of 

828
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:48,124
the gene pool.
Obviously something's happened to him 

829
00:40:49,871 --> 00:40:52,780
because he has this scar.
He's arrogant and brilliant,

830
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:57,340
which is very common set of attributes 
for negative father figures and he's out

831
00:40:57,341 --> 00:40:59,350
to do in the cake.
Right?

832
00:40:59,351 --> 00:41:01,270
So what does he represent?
Well,

833
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,673
you could say,
here's a way of thinking about it 

834
00:41:04,181 --> 00:41:05,050
sociologically.

835
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:07,330
One of the things you hear very 
frequently,

836
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:09,460
I'm sure many of you have heard this ad 
Nauseum,

837
00:41:09,461 --> 00:41:11,440
is that there's such a thing as the 
patriarchy,

838
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,120
right?
The patriarchy,

839
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:13,551
while,
okay,

840
00:41:13,551 --> 00:41:16,300
the pet patriarchy is a mythological 
construct.

841
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:20,020
And I mean that,
I mean that technically speaking,

842
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:24,340
you have a paternal figure that 
basically represents,

843
00:41:24,341 --> 00:41:25,174
it could represent the father directly 
or it can represent the structure of 

844
00:41:27,731 --> 00:41:30,070
male power.
It's not just male power.

845
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:31,930
But what if for the time being,
we'll,

846
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:34,670
we'll stick with that.
It has a positive aspect,

847
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:35,683
which is why you get to sit here and 
you're not being snowed on and freezing 

848
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:39,800
to death.
So that's the positive element.

849
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:40,783
And it has a negative element.
And the negative element is the 

850
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:46,340
arbitrary tyranny that's associated with
any social organization.

851
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:47,301
Right.
So,

852
00:41:47,301 --> 00:41:48,134
okay.
What do you think of the u of t like 

853
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,970
your first year?
Did you enjoy it?

854
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:58,400
How many people didn't enjoy it.
Okay.

855
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:02,060
How many people did enjoy it?
All right.

856
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:05,150
So more by the looks of things,
some of you and some of you are neutral,

857
00:42:05,151 --> 00:42:05,984
you'd either enjoyed it or,
or didn't to join or you don't have the 

858
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:12,440
mental energy to crank.
So,

859
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,530
okay.
So most he didn't enjoy it.

860
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,470
What the hell are you doing here?
They're like,

861
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:19,790
what?
Why bother?

862
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:24,050
So someone who didn't enjoy it and it's 
answered me that maybe you really didn't

863
00:42:24,051 --> 00:42:25,310
enjoy it,
but here you are.

864
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:26,450
Why are you still here?

865
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,830
That's the sunk cost answered.
It's like you,

866
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,890
you waited for a bus for half an hour.
It hasn't showed up.

867
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:39,320
Did the right thing to do is wait for 
another half an hour.

868
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:40,520
Right.

869
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,353
Um,
I,

870
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:42,203
well,
to put it in the more medical over to 

871
00:42:44,221 --> 00:42:45,970
him,
I approached it from a different angle.

872
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,680
So basically I changed when I was 
studying.

873
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:49,880
Oh.
How'd that work worked out?

874
00:42:49,881 --> 00:42:51,710
Well,
was it the second time?

875
00:42:51,711 --> 00:42:53,030
I did try it.
It worked out well.

876
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:53,691
Good,
good.

877
00:42:53,691 --> 00:42:57,290
So was that an unpleasant process?
Were you confused?

878
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,900
Did you come out the other end?
Um,

879
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,110
yeah,
right on.

880
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,740
Good work.
You're more mature,

881
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,560
you know more than you did five years 
ago.

882
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,050
I hope so.
Was it worth it?

883
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,180
I hope so.
All right.

884
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,200
Good.
Good for you.

885
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:12,861
Good for you.
Well,

886
00:43:12,861 --> 00:43:13,461
look,
look,

887
00:43:13,461 --> 00:43:14,660
you make a calculation.
Hey,

888
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:16,730
what's wrong with the University of 
Toronto?

889
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,970
Well,
there's 60,000 students for a starter.

890
00:43:19,971 --> 00:43:23,000
Like what the Hell do you matter?
You know,

891
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:26,900
really your numbered and it feels like 
that a lot of the time.

892
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:28,243
You know?
And so it's a very impersonal 

893
00:43:28,911 --> 00:43:31,460
institution and you're sort of tossed 
into it.

894
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,533
So you're basically facing a giant of 
some magnitude who's kind of blind and 

895
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:41,750
who sort of archaic,
which is always what culture is,

896
00:43:41,751 --> 00:43:41,960
right?

897
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:45,560
Culture's always blind because it's a 
product of yesterday and it's,

898
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:48,290
and it's archaic.
It's not up to date.

899
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:49,573
So you're going to have a problem with 
it and you have that problem when you 

900
00:43:52,011 --> 00:43:52,844
come to the university.
So you stick with it though because 

901
00:43:54,471 --> 00:43:56,060
it's,
it's got two faces.

902
00:43:56,270 --> 00:44:01,270
One face is sink or swim there guys.
And the other face is,

903
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:04,820
man,
if you're careful than you and establish

904
00:44:04,821 --> 00:44:06,740
a relationship with this kind of 
institution,

905
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:08,503
you can learn so much that you won't 
even be the same person when you come 

906
00:44:11,631 --> 00:44:12,464
out.
Maybe you'll be able to think that'd be 

907
00:44:14,541 --> 00:44:15,470
good.
You know,

908
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,053
if you learn to think,
then you don't run into sharp things 

909
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:19,364
when you wander through life because 
you're smart enough to see where they 

910
00:44:21,021 --> 00:44:22,190
are and avoid them.
You know,

911
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:26,360
and maybe you can think your way to a 
target or maybe you can even think about

912
00:44:26,361 --> 00:44:28,880
a target that's worthwhile and you can 
figure out how to attain it.

913
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,713
And maybe you learn to write and then 
you can articulate your ideas and you 

914
00:44:32,041 --> 00:44:34,530
can express them with some power and you
can make,

915
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:36,450
you know,
you can be a positive force in the world

916
00:44:36,451 --> 00:44:38,460
and you can be successful in all sorts 
of ways.

917
00:44:38,461 --> 00:44:41,060
And if you have to put up with being 
tyrannized by,

918
00:44:41,061 --> 00:44:41,701
uh,
you know,

919
00:44:41,701 --> 00:44:46,020
half dad monster with,
with Alzheimer's disease,

920
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:49,050
that's blind,
well that's life.

921
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:50,063
And it could be a lot worse because at 
least you're contending with something 

922
00:44:53,641 --> 00:44:55,560
that has a positive element.
You know,

923
00:44:55,561 --> 00:44:57,840
in lots of societies if you're up 
against the,

924
00:44:58,180 --> 00:44:59,013
the the blind giant of society,
the best that you can hope for is that 

925
00:45:01,831 --> 00:45:04,740
it isn't running around trying to stomp 
on you all the time.

926
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,910
And I would say that's more the standard
human experience.

927
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,250
So yeah,
there's a patriarch and yes,

928
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:13,590
negative,
obviously it's always been like that.

929
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:15,030
But by the same token,
you know,

930
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,133
there's good guy embedded in that too.
And that's the thing you want to have a 

931
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:20,940
relationship with.
And that's the same old story.

932
00:45:20,941 --> 00:45:21,774
It's always been like that.
There's always a wise king in a tyrant 

933
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:27,960
and they're always fighting.
And sometimes the wise king king wins,

934
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,740
sometimes the tyrant winds and then when
the tire,

935
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:35,750
when it's up to the hero to defeat the 
tyron and reestablish the rightful king.

936
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:37,943
And that's actually what you're trying 
to do when you're in university because 

937
00:45:40,831 --> 00:45:41,664
the rightful king in some sense is a 
corpse that's embedded inside the 

938
00:45:44,131 --> 00:45:47,310
university.
And your job is to reverify it,

939
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:48,653
you know,
you're the living element of the 

940
00:45:49,741 --> 00:45:52,110
university and all the knowledge is 
dead.

941
00:45:52,111 --> 00:45:54,330
It's just lying around and some of it's 
out of date.

942
00:45:54,331 --> 00:45:55,500
You know,
you come in here and you,

943
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:56,543
you revive it so that society can 
continue and so that you can benefit 

944
00:45:59,911 --> 00:46:00,870
from the relationship.

945
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:03,720
Well that's the positive and negative.
Great.

946
00:46:03,721 --> 00:46:08,100
Farther the wise king and the tyrant.
And then another,

947
00:46:08,101 --> 00:46:12,330
another level is the feminine.
The Feminine is not women.

948
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:15,220
Women partake of the feminine and the 
masculine,

949
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:18,090
just like men partake of the feminine 
and the masculine.

950
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,840
But the maternal element,
the feminine elements is nature.

951
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:24,293
Positive nature.
Well that's the thing that the 

952
00:46:25,651 --> 00:46:26,850
environmentalist,
it's love,

953
00:46:26,851 --> 00:46:29,790
right?
That's flowers and French landscapes and

954
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:31,260
you know,
pleasant days,

955
00:46:31,261 --> 00:46:35,880
picnic in the park and and beautiful 
sunshine and fresh air and clean water.

956
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:39,690
But then there's another side.
Another side is,

957
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:43,260
do you know what the Guinea worm is?
Does anybody know what a Guinea worm is?

958
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,240
Well,
I'm going to tell you,

959
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:47,100
although you're not going to be happy 
about it.

960
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:51,630
So a Guinea worm is this horrible 
parasite that burrows under the skin,

961
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,700
mostly of children,
mostly in Africa,

962
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,500
and it's about two feet long.

963
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,920
So it makes these coils around their 
legs and then it'll poke its little head

964
00:46:58,921 --> 00:47:02,040
out and then you can pull it out.
But it tends to break.

965
00:47:02,041 --> 00:47:03,750
And if that happens then it gets 
infected.

966
00:47:03,751 --> 00:47:04,584
It may be you die and so you can wrap it
around a pencil very slowly and pull it 

967
00:47:07,861 --> 00:47:09,660
out.
That's nature.

968
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,393
Now there's a doctor who's a Canadian 
doctor who wasn't reading very happy 

969
00:47:13,621 --> 00:47:14,454
about those damn getting worms and he's 
just about eradicated them and like 

970
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,230
hooray for him.
But you know,

971
00:47:19,231 --> 00:47:20,850
when we're talking about the 
environment,

972
00:47:20,851 --> 00:47:21,684
especially when we're thinking about it 
and mythological categories and we're 

973
00:47:24,061 --> 00:47:25,560
talking about nature,
it's like,

974
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,533
yeah,
yeah,

975
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,740
it's nature and all its beneficial 
glory,

976
00:47:28,741 --> 00:47:29,574
but it's also all the things that would 
just as soon eat you in the most awful 

977
00:47:32,411 --> 00:47:34,780
possible way.
And you need to know that too,

978
00:47:34,781 --> 00:47:35,614
because if you think of nature as only 
beneficial and it's positive 

979
00:47:38,681 --> 00:47:39,514
archetypical element,
that that's mother nature in all her 

980
00:47:41,891 --> 00:47:42,724
glory,
then you tend to denigrate the utility 

981
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:46,570
of the positive elements of culture.

982
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:47,653
You know,
it's culture that protects you from the 

983
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:52,780
horrible elements of nature.
You wouldn't even be able to think about

984
00:47:52,781 --> 00:47:56,890
nature is beautiful if you weren't 
already so protected from it.

985
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,083
You know,
you're more protected from it than any 

986
00:48:00,101 --> 00:48:04,180
human beings ever have been anywhere in 
the entire history of life.

987
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:08,200
And so in this unbelievably protected 
environment,

988
00:48:08,201 --> 00:48:09,034
you can think,
oh well we should go easy on nature 

989
00:48:10,301 --> 00:48:12,130
because isn't it so beautiful?
It's like,

990
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:13,203
yeah,
well,

991
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:16,480
yes and no.
And it's not all beauty.

992
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,630
It's certainly not because nature will 
eventually kill you.

993
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:22,600
So it's even if it doesn't go well,
it's going to kill you.

994
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:25,930
It will also make you sick.
It will also make everyone that you know

995
00:48:25,931 --> 00:48:26,764
sick and it will kill all of them too.
So it's not so such a bad thing to have 

996
00:48:30,161 --> 00:48:33,670
a little bit of empathy for human beings
given that we have to contend with that.

997
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:35,710
And you know,
if we're destroying everything,

998
00:48:35,711 --> 00:48:38,800
which we're not,
it's also returning the favor.

999
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,230
So,
all right,

1000
00:48:41,231 --> 00:48:43,780
so there's the sub strategy at the 
bottom of things.

1001
00:48:43,781 --> 00:48:46,540
There's this terrible monster,
but it hoards ghoul.

1002
00:48:46,541 --> 00:48:48,430
And so encountering it,
defeating it,

1003
00:48:48,431 --> 00:48:49,264
challenging it,
facing it can be unbelievably 

1004
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:53,463
productive.
And that's the symbol of the absolute 

1005
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:56,224
unknown.
That's where you go when things fall 

1006
00:48:58,091 --> 00:48:59,950
apart.
You don't know where you are.

1007
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:00,963
So where are you?
You're aware you don't know what things 

1008
00:49:03,311 --> 00:49:04,930
are.
And that's a place.

1009
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:08,500
And what's interesting about it is that 
there are rules to act in that place.

1010
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:12,160
And that's what's so helpful because you
know,

1011
00:49:12,161 --> 00:49:16,570
if you're in a place and you don't know 
what to do and that's that your die.

1012
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:19,990
But if there's a pattern to what you can
do in a circumstance like that,

1013
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:23,470
then in the land on your feet and you're
ready to contend,

1014
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:24,453
and maybe the trip down into the 
underworld is something you can 

1015
00:49:26,501 --> 00:49:27,910
undertake on your own accord.

1016
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:28,893
And you can come back with the treasurer
and steadying instead of ending up as 

1017
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,193
dragon food or worse.
And then when you're conceptualizing 

1018
00:49:35,921 --> 00:49:37,840
your relationship to other people,
well,

1019
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:40,090
well let's say the society,
first of all,

1020
00:49:40,091 --> 00:49:40,661
it's like,
yeah,

1021
00:49:40,661 --> 00:49:43,210
obviously you face a tyrant.
Of course you do.

1022
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,313
But that is all you face.
And you need to be grateful for what 

1023
00:49:46,151 --> 00:49:49,780
you've been given by your culture.
And you actually have to understand what

1024
00:49:49,781 --> 00:49:50,614
that culture is because it's you.
And if you don't rescue that part of 

1025
00:49:54,521 --> 00:49:55,354
you,
and that part of the culture that 

1026
00:49:56,021 --> 00:49:56,854
everything gets dead and stale and 
tyrannical and everything goes 

1027
00:49:59,441 --> 00:50:02,170
immediately to help.
And that's not a good thing.

1028
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:05,050
And then with regards to nature,
well,

1029
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:06,363
you obviously have to appreciate the 
positive element of nature and you have 

1030
00:50:08,831 --> 00:50:12,020
to enter into a relationship with it,
but you don't bloody well want to forget

1031
00:50:12,021 --> 00:50:12,430
that.

1032
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:15,940
Like things are out to get you.
And you know,

1033
00:50:15,941 --> 00:50:16,774
you have to be intelligent and,
and ready and awake so that you can 

1034
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,553
prevail against that.
And you have to be grateful for what 

1035
00:50:22,841 --> 00:50:23,674
you've been offered by other people.
And by the tremendous efforts of all of 

1036
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:30,790
human culture across all of the time,
it's putting you in a position where you

1037
00:50:30,791 --> 00:50:35,791
are so unbelievably privileged and have 
so many opportunities at your,

1038
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:40,390
at your disposal.
Well,

1039
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,730
so that's kind of the archetypal story 
of human beings.

1040
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:47,620
We always face nature and it's always on
our pho aside.

1041
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:48,463
We always face our culture.
It's always on our side and we always 

1042
00:50:51,471 --> 00:50:54,800
have ourselves and those things that are
arrayed against us internally,

1043
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:57,410
externally.
And that's the,

1044
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:59,600
you could say that's the existential 
world.

1045
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:00,434
It's the world of drama and the things 
that are really compelling to you as 

1046
00:51:03,891 --> 00:51:05,390
means of communicating.

1047
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:09,500
Use those categories to provide you with
information because what,

1048
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,633
what you're trying to figure out is if 
that's the landscape that makes up your 

1049
00:51:14,061 --> 00:51:16,280
being,
that's a phenomenological idea.

1050
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:18,650
How is it that you weave your way 
through it?

1051
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,870
While that's what we're going to figure 
out?

1052
00:51:20,871 --> 00:51:22,340
Well,
we go through this class.

1053
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:25,190
Okay,
so that's the mythological background.

1054
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:26,683
So there's the character or logical 
elements that I just described and then 

1055
00:51:29,301 --> 00:51:32,900
there's the punctuated movement forward.
Now,

1056
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:33,763
you know,
the problem with that is that when 

1057
00:51:34,701 --> 00:51:35,534
things fall apart,
it's not like you just fall apart 

1058
00:51:38,301 --> 00:51:41,360
psychologically.
It's not just a psychological condition.

1059
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,480
You know,
if someone's be trade you deeply,

1060
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:48,680
that might be because you're naive and 
unready and maybe that's a psychological

1061
00:51:48,681 --> 00:51:50,510
element.
Maybe you're just young and you know you

1062
00:51:50,511 --> 00:51:51,344
don't know better and you couldn't.
But there's also the real fact of the 

1063
00:51:54,681 --> 00:51:55,514
problem that you have in fact been 
betrayed and now you don't know what to 

1064
00:51:57,831 --> 00:52:00,560
do.
So there's reality in it as well as just

1065
00:52:00,561 --> 00:52:01,550
what psychological.

1066
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:03,143
And so

1067
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:05,953
one of the things that you might,
one of the ways that you might construe 

1068
00:52:09,021 --> 00:52:13,310
personality theories that have to deal 
with a description of the way people are

1069
00:52:13,311 --> 00:52:14,144
and a description of how they might move
towards mental health is that there are 

1070
00:52:17,651 --> 00:52:18,484
maps that tell you how to their maps of 
that landscape that tell you how to 

1071
00:52:22,761 --> 00:52:26,570
Orient Yourself so that you can succeed 
and even better.

1072
00:52:26,571 --> 00:52:31,040
And this is a Ph jetty and idea.
It's not only so that you can succeed,

1073
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:35,160
it's so that you can succeed in a way 
that your family succeed.

1074
00:52:35,161 --> 00:52:35,994
So that they can succeed in a way that 
society succeeds so that everything 

1075
00:52:38,871 --> 00:52:42,530
works better at the same time.
And that's really success,

1076
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:43,843
you know?
And that's like you're winning a game 

1077
00:52:45,231 --> 00:52:47,390
that everyone wants to play.
Well,

1078
00:52:47,391 --> 00:52:48,224
what a deal.
You get to move forward and everyone 

1079
00:52:50,391 --> 00:52:51,224
else gets to enjoy it.
While that's a good definition of 

1080
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:56,150
success,
it's an archetypal definition of success

1081
00:52:56,151 --> 00:52:58,490
actually,
because if you succeed property,

1082
00:52:58,491 --> 00:53:00,680
then your success benefits everyone 
else.

1083
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:05,420
So hard to imagine that there could be 
anything particularly wrong with that.

1084
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,940
All right,
so

1085
00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:10,543
that's the mythological element.
Now I want to tell you a little bit 

1086
00:53:12,081 --> 00:53:13,340
about the shamonic element.

1087
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:15,023
Now

1088
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,193
the reason I want to talk to you about 
shamanism is because of shamanism is a 

1089
00:53:20,841 --> 00:53:21,674
very,
very old phenomenon and the Shaman 

1090
00:53:23,041 --> 00:53:23,874
isn't,
looks like a phenomenon that involves 

1091
00:53:25,651 --> 00:53:29,280
the dramatization of transformation 
processes.

1092
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:30,653
So,
so one transformation process might be 

1093
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:35,603
the initiation of young men.
Now it's more typical for young men to 

1094
00:53:39,451 --> 00:53:40,890
be initiated,
then young women.

1095
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:42,443
And no one really knows why that is,
except men seem to be able to go more 

1096
00:53:45,601 --> 00:53:48,690
spectacularly wrong than women.
So well,

1097
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,840
so if you look at what,
we will talk about that later.

1098
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:52,853
But there's also competing theories that
say you don't have to initiate women 

1099
00:53:55,621 --> 00:53:56,454
because nature does that all by itself.
And I think that that's not a 

1100
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:04,640
particularly bad way of looking at it.
So women are going to be confronted with

1101
00:54:06,061 --> 00:54:10,920
the brute force of nature,
but men can either do that or not do it.

1102
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,930
And so there's in some sense an element 
of choice.

1103
00:54:12,931 --> 00:54:16,680
And so the initiation rituals take away 
the element of choice.

1104
00:54:16,681 --> 00:54:17,514
And so on a typical initiation ritual,
what happens is that young men usually 

1105
00:54:20,911 --> 00:54:24,810
at the onset of puberty or taken away 
from their familial dependence,

1106
00:54:24,811 --> 00:54:28,050
which really means their mothers,
and then they're put into some situation

1107
00:54:28,051 --> 00:54:31,620
and terrified three quarters to death.
Now more or less,

1108
00:54:31,621 --> 00:54:34,860
they do that voluntarily.
So perhaps here's an example,

1109
00:54:34,861 --> 00:54:39,420
maybe you're 13 so remember,
think about your 13 think about that.

1110
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:40,793
Okay?
And so you're still afraid of the dark 

1111
00:54:41,761 --> 00:54:44,160
when you're 13 even though they'll tell 
people that you aren't.

1112
00:54:44,161 --> 00:54:46,800
But you are.
And so like if you were dropped naked in

1113
00:54:46,801 --> 00:54:49,170
the middle of a forest when you're 13 
and it's midnight,

1114
00:54:49,171 --> 00:54:53,220
you're going to be plenty frozen with 
terror and a good thing too,

1115
00:54:53,221 --> 00:54:55,050
because you know it's dangerous out 
there.

1116
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:56,310
Okay.
So then you think,

1117
00:54:56,311 --> 00:54:57,750
well,
maybe it's just a park,

1118
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,950
but you're still out there and it's dark
and you're afraid.

1119
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:01,561
You might say,
well,

1120
00:55:01,561 --> 00:55:02,394
what are you afraid of?
And one of the things you might come up 

1121
00:55:05,641 --> 00:55:08,010
with as well,
you're afraid of what you're imagining.

1122
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:10,320
And then you might say,
well,

1123
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:11,183
does that mean that you're afraid of 
your imagination or are you afraid of 

1124
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:17,880
the things your imagination represents?
Well,

1125
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:21,030
you kind of have to think if there's no 
actual objective danger there,

1126
00:55:21,031 --> 00:55:23,010
then what you're afraid of is your 
imagination.

1127
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,353
Now,
did you guys ever see the Blair witch 

1128
00:55:26,431 --> 00:55:29,100
project?
How many of you've seen that?

1129
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:33,480
How many of you haven't know?
So it's a pretty lousy example.

1130
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,490
Anyways,
it's a horror movie.

1131
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,440
Now there's kind of two kinds of horror 
movies.

1132
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:41,820
There's the splatter type horror movie 
and I think actually those expose you to

1133
00:55:41,821 --> 00:55:46,530
discuss and then there's the fear kind 
of horror movie.

1134
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,720
And that doesn't need to have any Gore 
at all.

1135
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,673
It just makes you afraid.
And the Blair witch project is a very 

1136
00:55:51,391 --> 00:55:53,190
good example of that because all that 
happens,

1137
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:55,980
nothing happens,
nothing happens.

1138
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:59,460
But you think something terrible is 
going to happen every second.

1139
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,593
And the sense that something terrible is
going to happen keeps climbing through 

1140
00:56:02,641 --> 00:56:03,474
the whole movie.
And so what they do is put you in a 

1141
00:56:04,951 --> 00:56:08,550
state of radical uncertainty and never 
let you off.

1142
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:09,900
Okay,
well,

1143
00:56:09,901 --> 00:56:10,734
so basically they're playing with your 
imagination and that can work very 

1144
00:56:13,501 --> 00:56:14,334
effectively.
Like it's often a horror movies often 

1145
00:56:16,771 --> 00:56:17,604
more effective if they don't show you 
what's making those horrible noises off 

1146
00:56:20,751 --> 00:56:22,080
screen,
you know,

1147
00:56:22,081 --> 00:56:22,914
because no matter what,
show you the probability that it can be 

1148
00:56:24,971 --> 00:56:25,804
as personally horrible as what are their
monsters you're dredging up out of your 

1149
00:56:29,051 --> 00:56:31,930
imagination is very low.
So,

1150
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,010
okay.

1151
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:35,080
And you know,
it's reasonable to be afraid of the dark

1152
00:56:35,081 --> 00:56:37,180
because throughout our biological 
history,

1153
00:56:37,181 --> 00:56:42,181
lots of unfortunate people were devoured
by things in the dark or hurt very badly

1154
00:56:42,371 --> 00:56:43,650
by them,
et Cetera,

1155
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:45,550
et cetera.
And we're also daytime creatures,

1156
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:48,250
right?
So we don't like the dark very much.

1157
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:49,773
So
what do you do to someone if you're 

1158
00:56:52,871 --> 00:56:56,020
going to initiate them is maybe you take
them when they're 13 and you put them in

1159
00:56:56,021 --> 00:57:00,160
a really dark cave and caves.
There are so dark man,

1160
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:02,980
like if you're in a cave,
you just can't believe how dark it is.

1161
00:57:02,981 --> 00:57:03,814
It's,
it's,

1162
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:04,833
you can't see anything in a cave.
So you don't know how big this space 

1163
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:08,943
you're in is and you don't know how 
small it is and you don't know whether 

1164
00:57:12,131 --> 00:57:15,380
or not it's going to collapse or when 
it's going to stay on.

1165
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,890
And you don't know how far you are 
underground,

1166
00:57:17,891 --> 00:57:20,320
especially if the people who took you 
there didn't,

1167
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:21,513
you know,
walked around in circles and didn't let 

1168
00:57:22,361 --> 00:57:23,194
you know where you're going and then 
maybe they leave and maybe they leave 

1169
00:57:26,141 --> 00:57:27,010
for three days.

1170
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,900
And so you're sitting down there 
thinking,

1171
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:31,390
well,
what are you thinking exactly?

1172
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:33,303
Well,
you're thinking the most horrible 

1173
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:37,390
thoughts you could possibly imagine,
right?

1174
00:57:37,391 --> 00:57:40,420
I'm never going to get out of here.
They're never going to find me again.

1175
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,100
Some horrible snake thing that lives in 
the dark.

1176
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:47,110
This is going to come and eat me slowly 
because fast would be,

1177
00:57:47,111 --> 00:57:51,450
you know,
merciful and I'm,

1178
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:54,520
and then I'm also going to go completely
out of my mind so that even if something

1179
00:57:54,521 --> 00:57:56,080
doesn't eat me,
I'm going to come out of here.

1180
00:57:56,130 --> 00:57:57,730
It will be worse than being dead 
anyways.

1181
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:00,460
And so partly what you're doing in that 
circumstances,

1182
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:02,830
you're facing the demons of your own 
imagination.

1183
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:06,820
And if you can stand that,
then you grow up.

1184
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,820
And that's what an initiation ceremony 
does.

1185
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:13,030
Now,
a lot of what you'll find if you look at

1186
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:16,870
clinical theories of psychology,
the same motif applies.

1187
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:18,933
If you want to get better,
you have to find out what you're 

1188
00:58:20,621 --> 00:58:24,180
avoiding and what you're afraid of and 
maybe what you're disgusted by evil.

1189
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:25,683
And you have to expose yourself to that 
voluntarily and you have to let that 

1190
00:58:30,041 --> 00:58:32,950
change you.
And so it's not a pleasant prospect.

1191
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:36,850
I mean it's not dancing through a field 
of daisies,

1192
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,690
right?
With music play and it's not follow your

1193
00:58:40,691 --> 00:58:42,280
bliss.
You know,

1194
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:45,490
it's not the natural unfolding of a 
positive process.

1195
00:58:45,491 --> 00:58:46,324
It's not that at all.
It's the voluntary confrontation with 

1196
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,024
the things that make up life's horrors.
But what's interesting about it is that 

1197
00:58:52,091 --> 00:58:52,924
there's,
there's an idea there that lurks under 

1198
00:58:55,271 --> 00:58:57,370
the surface architecturally,
and that is,

1199
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:00,010
there's a lot more to you than meets the
eye,

1200
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:02,890
but it won't be released unless it has 
to.

1201
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:06,730
And so you're not going to even figure 
out what it is until you put yourself in

1202
00:59:06,731 --> 00:59:08,860
peril.
Now part of that,

1203
00:59:08,861 --> 00:59:11,110
you might think like,
imagine that you're,

1204
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:13,240
you're an introvert,
you're socially awkward,

1205
00:59:13,241 --> 00:59:15,970
you're hiding your audit so you feel a 
lot of anxiety and depression.

1206
00:59:15,971 --> 00:59:16,804
You don't like going to parties.
And that's because the horrible pirate 

1207
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:19,833
lives at parties and always glaring at 
you and judging you and telling you how 

1208
00:59:22,881 --> 00:59:23,714
useless an insufficient you are.
And so you go there and you don't even 

1209
00:59:26,721 --> 00:59:29,810
look at people because you know that if 
you did look at them,

1210
00:59:29,811 --> 00:59:32,090
you just see the face of the judgmental 
tyrant,

1211
00:59:32,091 --> 00:59:32,924
which by the way,
you wouldn't if you actually looked at 

1212
00:59:34,641 --> 00:59:36,290
them,
but you won't because you avoid.

1213
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:37,633
And so you're going to go there and 
you're gonna put yourself in this 

1214
00:59:39,141 --> 00:59:39,974
terrible situation.
And if you're lucky and you're a bit of 

1215
00:59:41,601 --> 00:59:42,434
weight,
then you're going to incorporate all 

1216
00:59:43,731 --> 00:59:44,564
sorts of information from the external 
world that will help you develop your 

1217
00:59:47,961 --> 00:59:50,270
social skills and make you more 
sophisticated.

1218
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:51,493
And even if that doesn't happen,
you're going to learn that you can 

1219
00:59:52,761 --> 00:59:55,220
tolerate your own fear.
And you might say,

1220
00:59:55,221 --> 00:59:56,054
well,
what's better to not be afraid or to 

1221
00:59:59,151 --> 01:00:03,440
know that you can handle being afraid 
and obviously to not be afraid,

1222
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:05,840
but give that up cause that ain't 
happening.

1223
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:07,603
So the,
the next best thing and the realistic 

1224
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:11,990
thing is to know that you're the master 
of your own fear.

1225
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:13,933
And so a lot of what we're going to talk
about in relationship to classical 

1226
01:00:16,461 --> 01:00:20,450
theories of personality is exactly that.
It's not that the world isn't terrible,

1227
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:25,280
he that the world is terrible,
but you're a lot stronger than you think

1228
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:26,540
and the way you,
okay.

1229
01:00:26,541 --> 01:00:27,374
And so part of that is the strength that
you gathered is partly the information 

1230
01:00:30,561 --> 01:00:33,020
that you gathered when you go somewhere 
that you're not good at.

1231
01:00:33,021 --> 01:00:34,880
You know,
so you were establishing new skills like

1232
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:35,714
you have at university,
but there's another part that's 

1233
01:00:36,981 --> 01:00:37,814
interesting that's related to the little
video that I showed you at the 

1234
01:00:40,581 --> 01:00:41,180
beginning.

1235
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,670
DNA turns out to be very complex 
structure.

1236
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:49,040
And so if I put you in situation a,
then DNA codes,

1237
01:00:49,041 --> 01:00:49,874
certain kinds of proteins that help make
up the way that your mind is in the way 

1238
01:00:52,581 --> 01:00:53,414
it works.
But if I take you and I put you in 

1239
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:57,770
another situation,
completely different genes turn on.

1240
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:03,700
And so what that means is that you have 
a biological repository of potential use

1241
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:05,683
lime and Patrick at the highest 
resolution level of your molecular 

1242
01:01:09,771 --> 01:01:10,604
structure.
And then if you push yourself and all 

1243
01:01:12,621 --> 01:01:16,100
sorts of different directions and you 
find different things to pursue and test

1244
01:01:16,101 --> 01:01:16,934
yourself against,
then you're going to turn on parts of 

1245
01:01:18,501 --> 01:01:22,250
yourself that aren't currently on and 
God only knows what you'd be like if you

1246
01:01:22,251 --> 01:01:26,420
turned yourself completely on.
Maybe I could use a better metaphor.

1247
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:39,873
Okay.

1248
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:48,413
I'll tell you a little bit more about 
the Shavano routines because they're 

1249
01:01:50,341 --> 01:01:51,300
more,
you know,

1250
01:01:51,301 --> 01:01:55,710
if there's a initiation archetype,
which are kind of just described to you,

1251
01:01:55,711 --> 01:01:58,640
which is you can do this for yourself.
I'll tell they're all your house,

1252
01:01:59,070 --> 01:02:02,520
then this is a good way to live.
Beats the alternative anyway.

1253
01:02:02,530 --> 01:02:03,363
So,
which is like the definition of a good 

1254
01:02:05,011 --> 01:02:08,430
way to live so mad and you're trying to 
pursue something so you've got a goal.

1255
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:09,293
That's a good thing.
You got to have a goal and you don't 

1256
01:02:10,501 --> 01:02:12,990
want to hold on to that too tightly 
because you might be wrong.

1257
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:14,293
It's,
you've gotta be willing to let that go 

1258
01:02:15,211 --> 01:02:17,040
and have a different goal,
but you need a goal.

1259
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:19,290
And then you know,
while you're pursuing goal,

1260
01:02:19,291 --> 01:02:21,810
you're going to find out that there's 
some obstacles in your path,

1261
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:25,050
obviously.
And maybe some of those obstacles are of

1262
01:02:25,051 --> 01:02:27,720
a frightening tight,
maybe the reason of a disgusting tight,

1263
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:28,583
you might say,
I don't want to turn it into that kind 

1264
01:02:29,761 --> 01:02:30,570
of person.

1265
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:31,403
So those of you who are sort of 
socialist utopia had left wingers might 

1266
01:02:34,141 --> 01:02:36,270
think that way about business people.
It's like,

1267
01:02:36,271 --> 01:02:37,104
I wouldn't,
I would recommend that you get over it 

1268
01:02:38,491 --> 01:02:41,210
as rapidly as possible.
So anyways,

1269
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:43,290
you might think there's no way I'm going
to act that way.

1270
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:46,740
So you sort of put it off limits,
say it.

1271
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:49,590
Or maybe you are afraid to do what you 
need to do next.

1272
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:51,390
Well,
here's the rule.

1273
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:56,820
Don't avoid doing things because they 
make you feel negative emotion.

1274
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:59,850
If you have to do those things in order 
to pursue your balls,

1275
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:02,190
in fact,
you should do exactly the opposite.

1276
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:03,053
So let's say you're pursuing a goal and 
you find that you're afraid about 

1277
01:03:05,371 --> 01:03:08,400
something and so you're avoiding it.
The first thing you should think is,

1278
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:10,110
Aha,
look,

1279
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:12,120
I'm afraid of something under,
I'm avoiding it.

1280
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:16,830
Dragon treasure.
Exactly there.

1281
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:19,530
And that's exactly right.
It's precisely right.

1282
01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:22,080
If you're,
if you're afraid of the thing,

1283
01:03:22,081 --> 01:03:22,914
then what that means is that you're not 
developed enough to handle it and you 

1284
01:03:25,231 --> 01:03:26,064
need to be.
So you should think about that as a 

1285
01:03:27,491 --> 01:03:29,340
discovery,
like a positive discovery.

1286
01:03:29,341 --> 01:03:33,660
You found out where you have a weakness 
and you're now able to address it.

1287
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:34,561
So,
you know,

1288
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:36,450
if you're an introvert and you think 
it's Friday night,

1289
01:03:36,451 --> 01:03:37,830
I could go to this party,
but you know,

1290
01:03:37,831 --> 01:03:39,150
I really don't want to.
But then you think,

1291
01:03:39,630 --> 01:03:42,120
oh,
that means I should go.

1292
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,370
And that's exactly right because,

1293
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:49,053
yeah,

1294
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:53,160
because you already know how to do the 
things that you know how to do.

1295
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:55,043
And it's the things that you don't know 
how to do that bother you and oppress 

1296
01:03:57,421 --> 01:03:58,254
you.
And of course those things are going to 

1297
01:03:58,741 --> 01:04:01,140
be difficult to learn about,
but you need to learn about them because

1298
01:04:01,141 --> 01:04:03,540
you need to get yourself all switched 
on.

1299
01:04:03,570 --> 01:04:04,403
How's that switched on?
Because then you'll be able to tolerate 

1300
01:04:07,711 --> 01:04:12,711
the fact that life is fundamentally 
suffering and so you don't do,

1301
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,130
world doesn't get safer.
US,

1302
01:04:14,131 --> 01:04:15,120
you've developed,
in fact,

1303
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:16,013
quite the contrary.
You just get more competent and that's 

1304
01:04:18,151 --> 01:04:18,984
been her anyways because it's 
conceivable that you don't want safety 

1305
01:04:20,821 --> 01:04:23,670
anyways.
You probably want adventure.

1306
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:27,840
You probably want to be compelled.
You probably want to be engaged.

1307
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:29,190
You know,
if you want security,

1308
01:04:29,191 --> 01:04:30,024
you might as well be dead well because 
nothing's happening then and that 

1309
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:37,010
there's no danger to be alive is to be 
contending with the,

1310
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:41,940
with the world and you want to be the 
basket that you can possibly be.

1311
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:43,283
And that's partly what we're going to 
learn about as we go through the entire 

1312
01:04:45,871 --> 01:04:46,704
course.
But certainly the elements that have to 

1313
01:04:47,851 --> 01:04:48,684
do with clinical psychology because all 
of them circulate around this 

1314
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:52,854
fundamental fee.
They have to because it's the 

1315
01:04:53,941 --> 01:04:54,774
fundamental story of mankind.
And we want to know what that 

1316
01:04:57,301 --> 01:05:01,230
fundamental story is because you're all 
human and you need to know the story,

1317
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:02,603
and then you know,
you can decide how you're going to act 

1318
01:05:03,871 --> 01:05:04,704
it out,
but at least you need to know the damn 

1319
01:05:06,211 --> 01:05:07,890
story first.
So

1320
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:10,283
we'll see you.
