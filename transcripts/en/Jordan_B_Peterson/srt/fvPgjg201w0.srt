1
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,110
So I've been informed about a couple of
things this week that have really been

2
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:14,940
bothering me and I thought that I wasn't
sure what to do about it.

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,570
I've been communicating with some of my
friends and colleagues about it,

4
00:00:18,571 --> 00:00:23,571
but that wasn't enough,
so I thought I'd try to write my

5
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:28,701
thoughts down and then talk about them a
little bit and see where I got with

6
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:34,011
that.
So I've entitled this talk Professor

7
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:39,360
Against Political correctness.
And the reason for that is because it's

8
00:00:39,361 --> 00:00:42,090
blunt and to the point,
um,

9
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,810
I'm very concerned about what's
happening in the universities.

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,990
It's not so bad in Canada.
I've been fortunate,

11
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:50,880
very fortunate the University of
Toronto,

12
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,130
but they're continually things
happening,

13
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,730
including in the administration here and
in the broader political world.

14
00:00:56,731 --> 00:01:01,080
That makes me very nervous.
I like to attribute that to the fact

15
00:01:01,081 --> 00:01:05,640
that I know something about the way that
totalitarian authoritarian political

16
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,680
states develop and I can't help but
think that I'm seeing a fair bit of that

17
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:15,681
right now.
So I guess I also wanted to do this

18
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:21,261
because there is a misapprehension that
everyone in academia is politically

19
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:26,310
correct.
And that's his true very frequently

20
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:29,430
among social scientists,
about 20 percent of whom identify

21
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:32,220
themselves as Marxists,
which in my estimation,

22
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:34,890
by the way,
is no better than identifying as Nazis

23
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,790
given the murderousness of the Marxist
doctrine and the fact that we know how

24
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:42,210
it's turned out when implemented in
multiple countries now.

25
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,690
Um,
but I'm not politically correct.

26
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:47,723
And,
uh,

27
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:52,840
I want to talk to you today about why
all this worries me.

28
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,410
So I got wind of two events this week.
Um,

29
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,870
one actually dates from last May.
Um,

30
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,280
there is a legislation passed or the
first reading of legislation in the

31
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:12,750
Federal House set in Canada about a bill
called [inaudible],

32
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,500
which was an,
is an attempt to alter the Canadian bill

33
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:21,480
of human rights.
It's tangled up with another

34
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:24,930
organization that operates at a
provincial level in Canada,

35
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,960
in Ontario,
which is the province I reside in called

36
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:31,080
the Ontario Human Rights Commission.
And uh,

37
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,850
as far as I can tell what happens at the
Ontario Human Rights Commission is

38
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:39,750
rapidly turned into policy in multiple
provinces across Canada.

39
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,110
And perhaps increasingly at the federal
level,

40
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,100
there's a liberal government in power
that's the name of the political party

41
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:49,530
in Ontario and now there's liberal
government federally.

42
00:02:49,531 --> 00:02:52,890
And um,
there's obviously a fair bit of cross

43
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:55,470
influence for better,
for worse.

44
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,590
Also this week I got wind of a
University of Toronto Human Resources

45
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:05,830
Initiative that also upset me,
I guess we could say quite profoundly.

46
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,230
And so I thought I'd talk about all of
those and try to see if I could make

47
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:14,231
some sense out of them.
So I've,

48
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,500
I'm making this video because I don't
really know what else to do.

49
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,960
I've talked to some colleagues and I've
talked to some colleagues as I or some,

50
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,410
some,
some people inside the university and

51
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:25,411
outside the university that I know and
they're upset and worried about this,

52
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:30,520
but unclear about what to do.
And all of this scares me I guess.

53
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:34,180
And here's why the law,
the changes to the law scare me because

54
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,630
cause they,
they put into

55
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:44,780
the legal substructure of the culture.
Certain assumptions about basic human

56
00:04:44,781 --> 00:04:48,440
nature that not only do I believe to be
untrue,

57
00:04:48,441 --> 00:04:51,890
I think there are also dangerous.
And ideologically motivated.

58
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:56,660
I also don't think that the reason for
the legal changes is the stated reason.

59
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,080
The Lord scare me.
The doctrines behind the law scare me.

60
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,140
You know,
when there,

61
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,220
when there's a law,
there's a body of thought that's

62
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:09,710
associated with a body of
interpretations that are associated with

63
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:11,660
it,
that flesh out the law.

64
00:05:11,661 --> 00:05:14,780
Because the law is a pretty bare thing.
And I've read,

65
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,870
I wouldn't say extensively because
extensively is a lot,

66
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:22,690
but I've read enough about the doctrines
behind the laws so that,

67
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,950
that has also may also makes me very
nervous.

68
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,780
Increasingly,
I see that these more radical ideas,

69
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:35,830
the ideas that we're going to discuss
are bought in people buy in at the

70
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:37,870
administrative level in large
organizations,

71
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,340
corporate,
governmental.

72
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,460
It doesn't matter,
it,

73
00:05:40,461 --> 00:05:45,461
it as long as the organization is large,
there's increasing administrative buy

74
00:05:45,821 --> 00:05:47,800
in.
A lot of this seems to me to be driven

75
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:50,520
by human resources departments.
Um,

76
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:55,240
which I think are generally the most
pathological elements of large

77
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:58,220
organizations.
And I say that because I've actually had

78
00:05:58,221 --> 00:06:01,460
fairly extensive experience dealing with
human resources departments.

79
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,600
Um,
I think her training is very politically

80
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:07,910
correct.
Like many disciplines,

81
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,260
we'll talk about that later.
Um,

82
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,400
the people behind the doctrines also
scare me.

83
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,300
I think that generally they're a very
bad combination of resentful,

84
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,760
uninformed,
and,

85
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:26,990
um,
that's good enough.

86
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,120
Resentful and uninformed.
That's good enough.

87
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,750
Uh,
I also think that their aims are

88
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:37,610
destructive rather than constructive.
They claim constructive aims,

89
00:06:37,611 --> 00:06:39,590
but of course everyone claims
constructive aims.

90
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:43,940
But the actions that I see undertaken
seemed to be to be driven by resentment

91
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,390
and primarily by resentment.
And,

92
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,900
and so I did,
I doubt the validity of the claims.

93
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:55,820
The claims are always for equality and
diversity and that kind of thing.

94
00:06:55,821 --> 00:06:59,540
And those words are very easy to say,
but a lot harder to put into practice.

95
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:02,030
So I'm scared by the people behind the
doctrines.

96
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,310
I'm scared by the response of my
colleagues at the university.

97
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,840
A number of them are unnerved by the
continual move towards political

98
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:14,540
correctness.
And I'm gonna tell you a couple of

99
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:18,320
responses that I've got recently from
people that I think are quite brave by

100
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:19,190
the way,
um,

101
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,550
but worried about making a statement,
putting their careers on their line,

102
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,350
worried about being tortured to death by
people online,

103
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:32,180
worried about administrative over
response or even administrative response

104
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,380
worried,
well,

105
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:36,260
here's why.
The things that I'm seeing at work will

106
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:38,060
have to be discussed in a phone
conversation.

107
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,370
This is a professor in American
professor.

108
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:44,600
I asked how this person was feeling
about

109
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,160
the position that they held at the
university.

110
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,710
I'm the person said the thing that I'm
seeing at work will have to be discussed

111
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:57,410
in a phone conversation.
It's hard for me personally to explain

112
00:07:57,411 --> 00:07:58,244
it in an email.

113
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,750
I'm not certain this is the career path
I'm interested in anymore.

114
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,610
I actually find myself sensory things,
censoring things that I'd normally say

115
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:09,700
to students and I'm not sure how to stop
that.

116
00:08:09,701 --> 00:08:13,670
Self Censorship Censorship leads to me
not truly educating them in a manner

117
00:08:13,671 --> 00:08:16,910
that will let me feel like I've done my
job well.

118
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,840
It's not as much from the administration
yet as it is from the students.

119
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:24,040
See,
I don't see that so much at the

120
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,910
University of Toronto.
The students here are so terrified of

121
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:28,640
the job market and generally speaking,
so diligent,

122
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:33,641
conscientious that they are not
particularly sidetracked by political

123
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:35,720
correctness.
So,

124
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,700
but that's obviously not my colleague's
experience in,

125
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:41,300
in the US.
This is in California,

126
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,480
another colleague,
this is more local,

127
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,260
said something I thought was very
intelligent.

128
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:51,110
I think that's why this sort of thing is
so difficult to stand up to,

129
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,530
uh,
the personal consequences of objecting

130
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:59,531
are and this person is referring to the
possibility of adverse job effects,

131
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:05,010
I guess effects on employment and you
think tenure would protect people

132
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,140
against that and I suppose it probably
does,

133
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:10,050
but that doesn't mean that people aren't
necessarily willing to put it to the

134
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:10,884
test.

135
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,800
Um,
and they're worried about being

136
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:17,220
pilloried online by social justice
warriors and,

137
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,080
and,
and,

138
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,080
and so on,
and having the reputation savaged and

139
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,310
demolished.
So you know,

140
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:24,180
and that,
that's a good,

141
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,880
that's a good,
that's a reasonable fear.

142
00:09:26,881 --> 00:09:30,990
Especially given the next part,
which is the effect of my objection on

143
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:33,840
society will be minuscule.
So there's this combination.

144
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:37,400
That's the idea anyways,
the personal consequences of jet of

145
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,340
objecting or potentially huge and the
social effects are minuscule.

146
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:46,440
There'll be no positive effect.
And so the thinking goes,

147
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,820
why put yourself and potentially your
family and your financial stability and

148
00:09:50,821 --> 00:09:55,320
all of that at risk by speaking out when
the consequences will be will be

149
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,150
minimal.
And you know,

150
00:09:57,151 --> 00:09:59,310
I've talked to other people outside of
academia,

151
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,400
academia writers for example,
we've had friends who've made a comment

152
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:06,480
online,
you know,

153
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,130
which they thought was rather innocuous.

154
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,080
That's quoted over and over again in
some,

155
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,880
sometimes in major newspapers as
emblematic of their particular stance

156
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,330
and that shows them in a very harsh
light.

157
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,570
So anyways,
this particular colleague concluded by

158
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:23,520
saying we should have acted 10 years
ago.

159
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,520
Well,
you know,

160
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,600
I feel for both of these colleagues,
I think they're both excellent educators

161
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:32,070
by the way.
And they're also,

162
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,820
I would say,
classically liberal people,

163
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,713
you know,
um,

164
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,040
they're not,
they're not you,

165
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:41,610
you wouldn't call them conservatives,
you,

166
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:43,830
you certainly wouldn't call them right
wingers.

167
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:49,010
Their people,
their concerns aren't driven by their

168
00:10:50,581 --> 00:10:52,710
political ideologies.
It's as simple as that.

169
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,130
Um,
their concerns are driven by their,

170
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:00,390
by their continued continual
observations,

171
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,420
increasingly continual observations that
things are not going in the proper

172
00:11:05,911 --> 00:11:10,050
direction and universities and that it's
becoming increasingly difficult for

173
00:11:10,051 --> 00:11:11,260
professors and,
and,

174
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:14,940
and students for that matter,
at least have of a particular kind of

175
00:11:14,941 --> 00:11:18,840
political orientation to even have the
opportunity to say what they think.

176
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,390
So,
okay.

177
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,820
So that scares me.
It scares me when I see decent people

178
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,930
and I think people who are more
courageous than average,

179
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:33,150
I'm frightened into submission and
considering altering their career paths

180
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:37,700
because they don't feel that they can
say what they think anymore and they're

181
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,780
afraid of the direction that the
universities are going.

182
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,730
So yeah,
that's scary.

183
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,390
So then I'm,
I'm a clinical psychologist.

184
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,070
This is starting to affect my clients.
I've had three clients in the last two

185
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:55,071
years who have been and who have been
driven near the point of insanity.

186
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,310
I'm by politically correct occurrences
at work.

187
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,830
One of them was a bank employee.
What what finally did her in

188
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:11,250
fundamentally was
she sent me a very long email chain

189
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:17,280
referring to a series of discussions
that happened in this bank internally

190
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,150
about whether or not the word flip
chart,

191
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:26,470
you know,
referring to those large pads of paper

192
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:28,000
that you put up on a stand.

193
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:31,540
You can flip forward and drawn kind of
an archaic technology.

194
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:36,541
Now whether or not the word flip chart
was pejorative and racist and the reason

195
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:41,671
for that was that apparently the word
flip can be used pejoratively to refer

196
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:44,710
to Filipinos,
which was something I didn't even know

197
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:49,980
and I suppose a Filipino could
conceivably take offense to having a pad

198
00:12:51,641 --> 00:12:56,200
of paper named flip chart.
Although it's hard to imagine the

199
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:58,900
circumstances under which that might
arise or at least once.

200
00:12:58,901 --> 00:13:00,550
It was hard to imagine that.
Anyways,

201
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:05,710
she gave me access to a string of email
conversations about that particular

202
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:10,711
topic and the bank did eventually agree
to stop using the term flip chart.

203
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,970
I don't know what they replaced it with,
um,

204
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,930
but you know,
she was a very,

205
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:22,690
very sensible person,
an immigrant by the way,

206
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:29,010
who couldn't reconcile
her requirement,

207
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,780
you know,
her moral requirement to work hard and

208
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:39,781
be productive and be sensible and be
conscientious with the fact that people

209
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:45,571
were being called,
called on to alter their behavior in

210
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:48,810
ways that were absolutely nonsensical.

211
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,710
And she was from an eastern European
country.

212
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:54,490
And of course for her,
this was reminiscent of the tactics of

213
00:13:54,491 --> 00:13:59,440
the worst of the ideologues in the
19 seventies and eighties and before

214
00:13:59,441 --> 00:14:01,630
that.
So it was very,

215
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:02,840
very hard on her.
She,

216
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,120
she,
she was very,

217
00:14:04,121 --> 00:14:08,560
very stressed by the situation at work.
And then I had another client who worked

218
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:13,210
in an HR department in a major
educational institute and he was always

219
00:14:13,211 --> 00:14:18,190
being called on to manifest to support
for various feminist initiatives at the

220
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,820
educational institute.
And he wasn't really all that

221
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:27,160
comfortable presenting himself as a pro
feminist because he actually wasn't one

222
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:31,330
and you can argue one way or another
about the propriety of that.

223
00:14:31,331 --> 00:14:34,260
And that's really not my point.
My point is,

224
00:14:34,261 --> 00:14:39,070
is that he believed and I think with
cars that his job would have been in

225
00:14:39,071 --> 00:14:44,071
jeopardy if he would have let his
objections to the demands of the

226
00:14:45,191 --> 00:14:47,200
political environment within the
workplace,

227
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,380
if he would have made those objections
known and it.

228
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:52,250
And I would say he,
he's,

229
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,650
he's a little bit more,
here's a little bit more to the right

230
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:57,530
than most of the people that,
that I've talked with,

231
00:14:57,531 --> 00:15:00,620
but not to any great degree.
Although like many people,

232
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:04,760
I think he's being driven in that
direction by the continual radical moves

233
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:08,420
to the left that seemed to be part and
parcel of every organization in,

234
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:10,130
uh,
in,

235
00:15:10,131 --> 00:15:15,131
in maybe in modern Western society now.
And then the other client that I had who

236
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:21,730
was very much troubled by this was a
social worker who was,

237
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,160
was,
I think she was,

238
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,220
she was,
she was an immigrant as well,

239
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:30,250
quite conservative from.
She was from a conservative culture and

240
00:15:30,261 --> 00:15:31,910
was very much,
um,

241
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,060
it had very much difficulty with the
demands,

242
00:15:35,061 --> 00:15:39,950
for example,
that she allow a non surgically altered

243
00:15:39,951 --> 00:15:44,090
transsexual men free access to the
women's shelters and the women's

244
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:45,110
shelters,
for example,

245
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:48,530
here are some of the people in them
obviously say,

246
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:53,300
or Muslim women who come from very
conservative cultures who really can't

247
00:15:53,301 --> 00:15:56,690
even function in a situation where,
you know,

248
00:15:56,691 --> 00:15:57,524
a,
a,

249
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,090
a,
a male,

250
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:04,510
a biological male has been given access
to what in principle is supposed to be a

251
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:05,690
woman's shelter.

252
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:09,050
And that was one of many things that,
that bothered her,

253
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:13,130
but we don't need to get into that.
The point is,

254
00:16:13,131 --> 00:16:16,970
is that I've had people who've been
driven to seek psychological counseling

255
00:16:16,971 --> 00:16:21,320
because of the effect of politically
correct oppression on them in the

256
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:24,140
workplace.
And so that's worrisome.

257
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,650
Um,
so that's a whole bunch of things that

258
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:31,770
make me nervous.
And then my own response scares me.

259
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,550
I find this stuff maddening.
Um,

260
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:37,320
I can't really believe the amount of
foolishness that,

261
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,793
that,
that,

262
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:45,120
that,
that has accumulated around these rather

263
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:50,121
contentious Marxist semi Marxist
political issues.

264
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,780
Uh,
which I have,

265
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,440
which I don't,
I have no respect for,

266
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,710
uh,
as I said already,

267
00:16:56,711 --> 00:17:01,711
I think that Marxism and neo Marxism is
no better than fascism and neo fascism.

268
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,240
Uh,
I think the historical evidence for that

269
00:17:04,241 --> 00:17:07,390
is absolutely clear.
I can't understand why we think it's

270
00:17:07,391 --> 00:17:12,391
acceptable for academics and their
followers to call themselves Marxists to

271
00:17:13,271 --> 00:17:14,440
neo Marxists,
but we,

272
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,460
we,
we would,

273
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,870
we,
we would not for a second countenance

274
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,720
the same thing from the fascists and the
neo fascists.

275
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,800
Anyways,
the opposite side of it is that I'm

276
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:36,660
nervous about doing this lecture and
I've also become nervous about some of

277
00:17:36,661 --> 00:17:39,780
the things that I'm teaching,
which I think I'm going to discuss this

278
00:17:39,781 --> 00:17:42,030
a little bit further,
a little further on in this,

279
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,670
in this discussion.
I think that some of the things that I

280
00:17:44,671 --> 00:17:48,690
say in my lectures now might be illegal.
I think they might even be,

281
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:51,900
I,
that they might even be sufficient to me

282
00:17:51,901 --> 00:17:55,740
to be for me to be brought before the
Ontario Human Rights Commission under

283
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,160
their amended hate speech laws.
And that scares me as well.

284
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,100
And it scares me that I think that
because it sounds paranoid,

285
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:03,390
but I'm

286
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,500
most of the time in the past when I've
been concerned that the,

287
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,850
that something is going to happen at an
administrative or bureaucratic level at

288
00:18:13,851 --> 00:18:16,060
the university,
that it,

289
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,980
it's,
it's frequently the case that when I'm

290
00:18:18,981 --> 00:18:22,040
worried about something happening that
it does actually happen and that it's

291
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:27,041
not so much worry as an ability to see
high probability outcomes down into the

292
00:18:27,081 --> 00:18:28,190
future.
So,

293
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,150
and you know,
even if even if the things that I'm

294
00:18:32,151 --> 00:18:37,151
saying are haven't been made illegal or
heaven forbid transformed into suddenly

295
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:42,890
into hate speech,
I am nervous that they might be.

296
00:18:42,891 --> 00:18:47,600
And even that's making it more difficult
for me to teach because in order for me

297
00:18:47,601 --> 00:18:50,390
to teach,
I have to say what I think is true.

298
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,920
And I can't do that if I'm afraid.
If I have to be afraid of the

299
00:18:54,921 --> 00:18:56,340
consequences.
All,

300
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:58,310
all,
all stopped talking.

301
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,150
You know,
even all,

302
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,880
if you can say one thing or the other
and there's a lot of pressure not to say

303
00:19:06,881 --> 00:19:09,520
the first thing.
And you could just as easily say the

304
00:19:09,521 --> 00:19:11,920
second thing.
It's just as easy to say the second

305
00:19:11,921 --> 00:19:15,670
thing,
why not just not bothered with it,

306
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,623
you know?
Well,

307
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,230
the reason I can do that is because if I
have something to say and I don't say

308
00:19:20,231 --> 00:19:22,420
it,
then it drives me crazy and so on.

309
00:19:22,421 --> 00:19:27,421
That's not something I'm willing to.
I'm not willing to go down that path and

310
00:19:27,491 --> 00:19:30,640
I've already decided that I'm going to
try to tell people what I think and,

311
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,890
and to tell them what I think to be the
truth,

312
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,750
even though it's the truth that I think
that I'm not saying that what I think is

313
00:19:37,751 --> 00:19:39,490
true.
I mean,

314
00:19:39,491 --> 00:19:42,520
who knows what's true.
That's why we have freedom of speech

315
00:19:42,521 --> 00:19:44,620
rate to sort out what's true so.

316
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:49,300
But I can tell you that it's true that
I'm scared about this and I think that's

317
00:19:49,301 --> 00:19:51,040
appalling.
I really think that's appalling.

318
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,180
All right,
so this is bill.

319
00:19:54,181 --> 00:19:59,181
See 16 in and somebody sent this to me
this week and pointing out what was

320
00:20:00,271 --> 00:20:03,360
happening with regards to this
fundamental Canadian human rights

321
00:20:03,361 --> 00:20:05,970
legislation.
And I'm going to do a bad job of this

322
00:20:05,971 --> 00:20:09,690
because it takes,
it takes more time than I have to do

323
00:20:09,691 --> 00:20:14,691
this properly.
So all I can do is tell you my initial

324
00:20:15,451 --> 00:20:17,820
thoughts and try to justify them as best
I can.

325
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,740
It would take months to do this lecture
properly and I haven't gotten months to

326
00:20:24,811 --> 00:20:26,700
do it properly,
so I'm going to have to do it badly.

327
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:30,540
So here we go.
So Bill [inaudible] is an act to amend

328
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:32,580
the Canadian Human Rights Act and the
criminal code.

329
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,430
So these are major.
This is a major amendment because the

330
00:20:35,431 --> 00:20:39,150
human rights act and the criminal code
or major pieces of legislation,

331
00:20:39,151 --> 00:20:42,480
they affect everyone.
And the consequences for contravening

332
00:20:42,481 --> 00:20:47,481
them are severe as severe as severe
consequences can be short of you know,

333
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,210
of illness and death.
So there are nontrivial pieces of

334
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:53,710
legislation.
Now,

335
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,980
if you guys aren't in Canada,
you might wonder why you should care

336
00:20:56,981 --> 00:21:00,310
about this.
But what's happening in Canada is

337
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:05,311
happening throughout the West.
So I'm going to concentrate on the local

338
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:07,000
occurrences,
but you can think,

339
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,030
you can be sure they're emblematic of
similar things happening in your

340
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:13,750
jurisdictions.
So because this is certainly not only a

341
00:21:13,751 --> 00:21:18,751
Canadian problem and in fact I would say
to some fairly large degree,

342
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:24,130
Canada has been reasonably free of this,
especially at the university level and

343
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:27,190
it's almost as if we're importing it
unnecessarily.

344
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:31,870
But okay.
This enactment amends the Canadian Human

345
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:36,310
Rights Act to add gender identity and
gender expression to the list of

346
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:39,220
prohibited grounds of discrimination.
Now,

347
00:21:39,221 --> 00:21:41,740
this amendment has only gone through
first reading.

348
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,620
This was back in May,
but similar legislation has already been

349
00:21:44,621 --> 00:21:46,150
passed in a number of provinces.

350
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,270
Those are the smaller like this,
they're like states.

351
00:21:49,271 --> 00:21:52,250
They're the smaller subdivisions of the
Canadian political system.

352
00:21:52,251 --> 00:21:56,140
So this hasn't been made into law
federally,

353
00:21:56,141 --> 00:21:57,900
but it,
it,

354
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,040
it's,
it's likely going to.

355
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,650
And it already has at the provincial
level as I said.

356
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,700
So
this enactment also amends the criminal

357
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:11,410
code to extend the protection against
hate propaganda set out in that act to

358
00:22:11,411 --> 00:22:15,850
any section of the public that is
distinguished by gender identity or

359
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:19,720
expression.
And to clearly set out that evidence

360
00:22:19,721 --> 00:22:22,000
that have no fence was motivated by
bias,

361
00:22:22,001 --> 00:22:24,940
prejudice,
or hate based on gender identity or

362
00:22:24,941 --> 00:22:28,990
expression constitutes an aggravating
circumstance that a court must take into

363
00:22:28,991 --> 00:22:31,420
consideration when it imposes a
sentence.

364
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,060
Okay,
so that's basically a hate crime,

365
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:37,630
a modification.
So if you commit a crime,

366
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:39,910
well that's one thing,
but if you commit a crime and it's

367
00:22:39,911 --> 00:22:43,150
motivated by bias,
prejudice,

368
00:22:43,151 --> 00:22:46,870
or hate based on age,
sex,

369
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,700
race,
ethnic identity,

370
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,710
and so,
so and other things,

371
00:22:50,711 --> 00:22:53,080
including now gender identity or
expression,

372
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,750
then that makes the crime worse.

373
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,850
It falls into the category of hate
crime.

374
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:03,180
And so that's what this modification is
intended to produce or to bring about.

375
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:09,870
So any,
any crime that is associated with bias,

376
00:23:10,571 --> 00:23:13,000
prejudice,
or hate based on gender identity or

377
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:15,880
expression is now an aggravating
circumstance.

378
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:16,923
Okay,
so,

379
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:21,910
so it's a hate crime.
Now I have some real problems with hate

380
00:23:21,911 --> 00:23:26,290
speech legislation and the reason I have
problems with it is that it's not

381
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,920
obvious when speech is motivated by
hate.

382
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,990
Angry speech can feel like it's
motivated by hate,

383
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:40,710
but angry speech is the only kind of
speech in some sense that is indicative

384
00:23:41,021 --> 00:23:42,760
of real disagreement.
I mean,

385
00:23:42,761 --> 00:23:45,740
I'm not saying that all disagreement
should be angry.

386
00:23:45,741 --> 00:23:49,190
I'm just saying that if there is real
disagreement,

387
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:55,480
the it's our anger is often the evidence
for the exam existence of real

388
00:23:55,481 --> 00:23:57,760
disagreement and if there's real
disagreement,

389
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:03,060
angry people have to talk it out because
if they don't then well then a bunch of

390
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:05,350
terrible things happened.

391
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,770
First of all,
you start losing track of who the angry

392
00:24:08,771 --> 00:24:10,210
people are.
Second,

393
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,870
they don't get to say what's on their
mind and even listened to themselves.

394
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:17,230
They don't get to have other people tell
them that they're wrong.

395
00:24:17,231 --> 00:24:21,910
They don't get to modify their
viewpoints because talking is thinking,

396
00:24:21,911 --> 00:24:23,680
you know,
and if you start people from talking,

397
00:24:23,681 --> 00:24:26,020
then you stop them from thinking and
that's a really bad thing.

398
00:24:26,021 --> 00:24:27,550
And then if you,
if you,

399
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:33,420
if you interpret hate speech too broadly
than you drive the so called haters

400
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,000
underground and then you don't know what
they're up to and when people go under

401
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:40,720
ground that isn't good.
That that's really not good.

402
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:45,280
You get the rise of all sorts of
underground political movements when

403
00:24:45,281 --> 00:24:47,950
people aren't able to express what they
think,

404
00:24:47,951 --> 00:24:51,280
even though it's unpleasant.
So if you want to know where the haters

405
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,840
are,
then you have to let them talk.

406
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:55,990
You know when we even tell two year olds
who are angry,

407
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,570
you say,
well use your words and the reason we

408
00:24:58,571 --> 00:25:02,410
tell two year olds that is because the
alternative to using your words is using

409
00:25:02,411 --> 00:25:05,740
your fists.
And so if we don't let angry people

410
00:25:05,741 --> 00:25:06,820
talk,
then the only,

411
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,030
they only have two,
two alternatives.

412
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:13,360
Well apart from changing their mind and
they're not going to change their mind

413
00:25:13,361 --> 00:25:16,210
just if you just shut someone up,
that doesn't change their mind because

414
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:21,100
partly the way you change your mind is
by talking and thinking and

415
00:25:21,101 --> 00:25:23,920
communicating with other people.
And if you shut that avenue or for

416
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:25,690
people,
then they can change their minds.

417
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:30,130
Well then they either they pull it in
and get resentful,

418
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,420
you know,
that's one option.

419
00:25:31,421 --> 00:25:34,360
They don't take any action or they get
aggressive and violent or they start

420
00:25:34,361 --> 00:25:37,900
agitating for violence.
So you know,

421
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,960
I can't help but think that,
well,

422
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,050
there's a famous psychoanalyst,
Dick Psychoanalytic Dictum,

423
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,320
if you don't understand the motivation
for something,

424
00:25:51,321 --> 00:25:53,540
look at the outcome and in further
motivation,

425
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:58,220
well if the outcome of shutting people
up is that they get violent,

426
00:25:58,221 --> 00:26:03,221
then it's hard for me to suppress the
suspicion that it was the incitement of

427
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:07,070
violence that was at least part of the
initial motivation for,

428
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,020
for producing the restriction.
Now I think there's a lot more to it

429
00:26:12,021 --> 00:26:12,854
than that.

430
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:16,620
You know,
I think a lot of it is a lot of this

431
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:20,670
desire for people not to ever say
anything upsetting is actually a

432
00:26:20,671 --> 00:26:22,620
consequence of trait.
Agreeableness,

433
00:26:22,621 --> 00:26:26,520
which is a big five psychological trait
and really agreeable people are

434
00:26:26,521 --> 00:26:29,690
egalitarianism by nature,
but they also don't like conflict and

435
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,760
but what that means is they don't like
short term conflict.

436
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,930
You know,
they don't like anybody to be upset.

437
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,830
And the problem is sometimes you have to
be upset in the present to solve

438
00:26:40,831 --> 00:26:43,530
problems in the medium and longterm.
You know,

439
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,630
you can't stop people from talking about
upsetting things because as I said,

440
00:26:48,631 --> 00:26:51,180
that's just the same as topping them
from thinking and,

441
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:54,480
and if they can't think really
complicated things through well then

442
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,140
they don't solve problems and then the
problems manifest themselves in the real

443
00:26:58,141 --> 00:27:00,450
world.
It's no joke.

444
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:06,660
So there's a recent case of Lionel
Shriver who's a WHO's A.

445
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,570
Well,
I won't talk about her.

446
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,330
You can look her up.
I'll try to stick to the point here.

447
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,200
So this is also part of bill
[inaudible].

448
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:23,260
This is modification of section two of
the Canadian Human Rights Act purpose.

449
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:28,760
The purpose of this act is to extend the
laws in Canada to give effect within the

450
00:27:28,761 --> 00:27:31,970
purview of matters coming within the
legislative authority of parliament.

451
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,410
That's Canada's highest governing body,
the principle that all individuals

452
00:27:36,411 --> 00:27:40,700
should have an opportunity equal with
other individuals to make for themselves

453
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,880
the lives that they are able and wished
to have and to have their needs

454
00:27:43,881 --> 00:27:46,130
accommodated,
consistent with their duties and

455
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:51,131
obligations as members of society
without being hindered in or prevented

456
00:27:51,681 --> 00:27:55,550
from doing so by discriminatory
practices based on race,

457
00:27:55,551 --> 00:27:57,080
national,
or ethnic origin.

458
00:27:57,081 --> 00:27:57,980
Color,
religion,

459
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:58,910
age,
sex,

460
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,970
sexual orientation,
and now hypothetically,

461
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:05,420
gender identity or expression,
marital status,

462
00:28:05,421 --> 00:28:08,690
family status,
disability or conviction for an offense

463
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,880
for which at pardon has been granted or
in respect of which are record

464
00:28:11,881 --> 00:28:14,090
suspension has been ordered.
Okay,

465
00:28:14,091 --> 00:28:17,540
so well,
what's problematic about this?

466
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,880
Well,
I've outlined some of it in yellow.

467
00:28:19,881 --> 00:28:24,050
I don't really like the idea of wished
to have the lives that they're able and

468
00:28:24,051 --> 00:28:27,650
wish to have and then to have their
needs accommodated.

469
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,123
Well,

470
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,370
it's messy,
it's messy terminology.

471
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,840
It's not easy to delineate needs.

472
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,480
There's an infinite number of them.
It's very,

473
00:28:40,481 --> 00:28:44,380
very difficult to determine whose needs
should take priority.

474
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,570
In fact,
that's why we have a free market

475
00:28:46,571 --> 00:28:49,600
society.
We have a free market society so that

476
00:28:49,601 --> 00:28:54,601
people's needs can be voted on in some
sense by the purchasing power of three

477
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:58,210
individuals so that nobody,
no central committee,

478
00:28:58,211 --> 00:29:02,170
no governing body has to decide whose
needs should be accommodated.

479
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:06,100
It's an infinitely complex problem and
it can't be solved by fit.

480
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:09,140
It's not possible and this was happened
in places like this.

481
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:12,220
This,
this was attempted in places like the

482
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:16,000
Soviet Union were need decisions.
We're constantly made by centralized

483
00:29:16,001 --> 00:29:18,820
committees and the consequences was
absolutely catastrophic.

484
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,540
Not only was it economically suicidal,
it was also murderous,

485
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:26,590
so the whole idea of having needs
accommodated is a very,

486
00:29:26,591 --> 00:29:27,640
very.
It's a very,

487
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:30,580
very slippery idea and it sounds good,
but it's very,

488
00:29:30,581 --> 00:29:35,581
very dangerous.
It's dangerous because the question who

489
00:29:36,111 --> 00:29:41,111
decides who's needs are paramount is the
crucial question and how's that it's

490
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:47,281
answered is the crucial issue and that
can go seriously wrong.

491
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,010
And then,
well,

492
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,580
the inclusion of gender identity or
expression.

493
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,430
Well,
we'll,

494
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:56,380
we'll discuss that momentarily

495
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:03,810
and there's also modification of section
three for all purposes of this act.

496
00:30:04,011 --> 00:30:06,650
The prohibited grounds of discrimination
or race,

497
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,360
national ethnic origin,
color,

498
00:30:08,361 --> 00:30:09,081
religion,
age,

499
00:30:09,081 --> 00:30:10,430
sex,
sexual orientation,

500
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,460
and then again,
newly gender identity or expression,

501
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,170
marital status,
family status.

502
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,820
So this is the criminal code
modification modification of subsection

503
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:22,511
three,
18,

504
00:30:22,511 --> 00:30:25,120
four where they define an identifiable
group.

505
00:30:25,121 --> 00:30:28,390
And this is for the purpose of
determining who fundamentally is

506
00:30:28,391 --> 00:30:31,090
uttering hate speech or discriminatory
speech.

507
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,230
And this includes all the candidates we
already described,

508
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,341
color,
race,

509
00:30:36,341 --> 00:30:38,050
religion,
national ethnic origin,

510
00:30:38,051 --> 00:30:40,660
et Cetera,
and includes gender identity or

511
00:30:40,661 --> 00:30:41,494
expression.

512
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:44,030
Um,
and so,

513
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,760
well we'll,
we'll continue to talk about that.

514
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,433
And then

515
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,700
there's modifications of sub paragraph
seven,

516
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,760
18 to a,
again with regards to hate crime,

517
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,460
evidence that the old fence was
motivated by bias,

518
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:02,710
prejudice,
or hate based on race,

519
00:31:02,711 --> 00:31:04,090
national,
ethnic origin,

520
00:31:04,091 --> 00:31:04,841
language,
color,

521
00:31:04,841 --> 00:31:07,920
religion,
etc. Including gender identity or

522
00:31:07,921 --> 00:31:10,860
expression or any other simpler similar
factor.

523
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,920
The old fence was motIvated.

524
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:13,803
Bye.

525
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,350
Okay.
So this sort of legislation has already

526
00:31:16,351 --> 00:31:19,740
come into play and provinces in Canada,
alberta,

527
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,930
british columbia,
newfoundland and labrador,

528
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:24,030
nova scotia,
prince edward island and,

529
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,600
and ontario.
And I'm going to concentrate on ontario

530
00:31:27,601 --> 00:31:31,770
because I think a lot of this is
emanating from a small coterie of people

531
00:31:31,771 --> 00:31:34,590
behind the ontario human rights
commission,

532
00:31:34,591 --> 00:31:38,790
which is a particularly pathological
organization in my estimation.

533
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:42,990
And perhaps the biggest enemy of freedom
currently extent in Canada.

534
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:48,340
And I don't say that lightly.
So the reason I think the ontario human

535
00:31:48,441 --> 00:31:52,400
rights commission is,
is an emblematic institution in this

536
00:31:52,401 --> 00:31:57,401
regard is partly because I think that
the social justice warrior type

537
00:31:58,671 --> 00:32:00,890
activists are overrepresented in the
current

538
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:06,020
provincial government,
federal or the current liberal

539
00:32:06,021 --> 00:32:08,670
provincial government.
And I can't help but shake this,

540
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:13,160
I can't help but manifest the suspicion
that that's partly because our current

541
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:19,630
premier is lesbian in her sexual
preference and that in itself doesn't

542
00:32:20,091 --> 00:32:23,510
bother me one way or another.
I don't think it's relevant to the

543
00:32:23,511 --> 00:32:28,100
political discussion except in so far as
the lbgt community has become

544
00:32:28,101 --> 00:32:33,101
extraordinarily good at organizing
themselves and has a fairly pronounced

545
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:37,430
and very,
very sophisticated radical fringe and

546
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,530
I can't help but see the hand of that in
what I'm going to read to you and you

547
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:48,170
could make up your own mind and see if
you think the same thing.

548
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,250
So the wording on the ontario human
rights commission with regards to

549
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,880
legislation like bill [inaudible] is the
same.

550
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:59,450
It's identical to that on the canadian
department of justice.

551
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,070
I,
I've given you the links here.

552
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,360
And so that's another indication to me
that there's tremendous cross talk

553
00:33:05,361 --> 00:33:08,510
between these institutions.
One at the provincial level that's the

554
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:11,930
ontario one at and one at the federal
level because the wording is identical.

555
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,450
So That's the argument for overlap.

556
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:21,390
And the other thing too,
with regards to the lbgt angle on this

557
00:33:21,391 --> 00:33:26,030
is that the wording is identical in many
regards to that that's common generally

558
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:31,040
used by lbgt activists.
And so that's why I'm putting the

559
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,630
different organizations together.
And as I said before,

560
00:33:34,631 --> 00:33:38,320
I'm not saying this is right,
it's what I've been able to sort out.

561
00:33:38,321 --> 00:33:40,330
It's,
it's what I've been able to puzzle out

562
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:43,420
and I'm putting it forward as an element
of discussion.

563
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,970
Okay.
So here's some of the definitions that

564
00:33:45,971 --> 00:33:50,350
they use and these are now explicit
categories and implicit presumptions of

565
00:33:50,351 --> 00:33:54,250
our most fundamental legal structure.
So now these have become something.

566
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,400
These definitions have become something
more than fact.

567
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:02,350
They become facts that you questioned at
your legal peril.

568
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:05,830
So here's the first one,
gender identity.

569
00:34:05,831 --> 00:34:09,490
This is directly from the ontario human
resource human rights commission

570
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,550
weBsite.
Gender identity is each person's

571
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:15,490
internal and individual experience of
gender.

572
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,690
It is their sense Of being a woman,
a man,

573
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,080
both neither or anywhere along the
gender spectrum.

574
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:26,200
Oh,
I'd also like to point out that that's

575
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:29,830
relatively.
ThiS is a petty thing to say I suppose,

576
00:34:29,831 --> 00:34:33,760
but one of the things that struck me
about the ontario human rights

577
00:34:33,761 --> 00:34:35,680
commission website is that it's very
poor,

578
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:39,970
very poorly written,
and this particular sentence is very

579
00:34:39,971 --> 00:34:41,500
poorly written and

580
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:46,890
policy that's on its way to be
transformed into legislation should not

581
00:34:46,891 --> 00:34:50,220
be poorly written because it means it's
been poorly thought through and poorly

582
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:53,090
specified and it means that the people
who are doing it,

583
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,280
art,
being careful and that makes me nervous

584
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,700
and so then there's things in here that
I don't believe to be true.

585
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:04,770
Gender identity is each person's sense
of being a woman,

586
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:08,940
a man,
both neither or anywhere along the

587
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:13,941
gender spectrum.
I don't know what neither means because

588
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:20,830
I don't know what the options are.
If you're not a man or a woman,

589
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:25,780
it's not obvious to me how you can be
both because those are by definition

590
00:35:25,781 --> 00:35:30,460
binary categories.
There's an idea that there's a gender

591
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,040
spectrum,
but I don't think that that's a valid

592
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:34,900
id.
I don't think there's any evidence for

593
00:35:34,901 --> 00:35:37,500
it.
Biological sexuality is ancient.

594
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:38,940
It's hundreds of millions of years

595
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:43,940
old and it's binary because there's two
forms of of,

596
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:46,980
of,
of biological sex.

597
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,810
Now,
of course this is predicated on the idea

598
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:51,540
that your gender is somehow independent
from your,

599
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:54,450
from your biological sex,
but that's a proposition,

600
00:35:54,451 --> 00:35:57,330
not a fact,
and even if it's true,

601
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:01,620
it's even if it.
Even if it in some manner was determined

602
00:36:01,621 --> 00:36:05,010
to be true,
it is certainly not determined to be

603
00:36:05,011 --> 00:36:09,210
true to that degree now and certainly
not to the degree that it should be

604
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:14,130
instantiated in law at most.
It's an opinion and I think it's an ill

605
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:17,770
informed opinion.
I think it's a politiCally motivated to

606
00:36:17,771 --> 00:36:22,771
neil informed opinion and now it's
sculpt the force of law and then there's

607
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:26,190
another modification which is gender
expression,

608
00:36:26,191 --> 00:36:28,080
which is something different thAn gender
identity,

609
00:36:28,081 --> 00:36:32,370
so I guess there's biological sex and
then on top of that there's gender

610
00:36:32,371 --> 00:36:35,790
identity which is separate.
They're not even correlated that they

611
00:36:35,791 --> 00:36:37,830
don't bear any relationship to one
another.

612
00:36:37,831 --> 00:36:40,410
I guess one is choice or it isn't
exactly clear.

613
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:43,980
I mean,
here's one of the things I find very

614
00:36:43,981 --> 00:36:48,830
confusing.
It seems to me that the leftist

615
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:53,831
activists have made the claim that with
regards to transsexual individuals,

616
00:36:54,141 --> 00:36:58,040
for example,
that you can Be a man in a woman's body

617
00:36:58,041 --> 00:37:01,700
and that that's a biological reality or
that you can be a woman in a man's body

618
00:37:01,701 --> 00:37:06,140
and that's a biologiCal reality,
so as long as you're

619
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:13,730
gender identity is opposite to that of
your biological,

620
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,980
cardinal,
biological sexual attributes,

621
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:21,190
then that's biologically determined.
but if your gender identity is in sync

622
00:37:21,621 --> 00:37:26,621
with your biological attributes,
theN that's a free floating cultural

623
00:37:26,991 --> 00:37:30,890
construct.
Unless I've got my logic wrong somehow

624
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:34,580
and I cannot see how both of those
things can possibly be true,

625
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:39,850
but I don't think that coherence is one
of the hallmarks of radical politically

626
00:37:40,221 --> 00:37:43,700
correct.
Think and you can tell that because

627
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,720
politically correct people like the
people who have produced this

628
00:37:47,721 --> 00:37:52,480
Legislation and these policies are
capable of saying things like it.

629
00:37:52,481 --> 00:37:55,880
Is there sense meaning each person's by
the way it?

630
00:37:55,881 --> 00:37:57,890
Is there a sense of being.
Maybe

631
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:04,450
maybe an individual can decide to be a
plurality as well,

632
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:09,370
aNd that's why there is being used as
the pronoun in this particular sentence.

633
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:13,290
Although I think the real reason is is
that the person who wrote this can't

634
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:15,670
write it,
is there a sense of being a woman,

635
00:38:15,671 --> 00:38:18,100
a man,
both neither or anywhere along the

636
00:38:18,101 --> 00:38:20,290
gender spectrum?
From my perspective,

637
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:25,000
that Sentence is entirely nonsensical
and now it's law and then okay,

638
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:27,610
so we've got biological sex,
gender identity,

639
00:38:27,611 --> 00:38:29,710
and then on toP of that we've got gender
expression,

640
00:38:29,711 --> 00:38:32,050
which I guess is how you Express your
gender identity,

641
00:38:32,051 --> 00:38:35,350
which is separate from your biological,
sexual orientation.

642
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,380
It's the way people publicly present
their gender.

643
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,710
It is the presentation of gender through
such aspects as dress,

644
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:42,461
hair,
makeup,

645
00:38:42,461 --> 00:38:44,860
body language and voice.
Okay,

646
00:38:44,861 --> 00:38:49,480
well those are canonical categories now
and it isn't clear to me because of the

647
00:38:49,481 --> 00:38:51,700
legislation.
It is possible.

648
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:56,820
I believe it's possible that my
commentary on these definitions is now

649
00:38:57,191 --> 00:39:01,300
illegal and that it's also now
potentially classifiable as hate speech

650
00:39:01,301 --> 00:39:05,110
and I would say if that's the case then
like,

651
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:17,570
well it's the sort of thing I'm going to
question and if sOmeone should be put in

652
00:39:17,571 --> 00:39:20,360
jail for questioning that and that I
questioning that,

653
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,710
then I guess I should be put in jail
because I'm going to continue to

654
00:39:24,711 --> 00:39:26,600
question it.
I think it's nonsensicAl.

655
00:39:26,601 --> 00:39:30,170
I think the formulation is absurd.
I think it has no scientific standing.

656
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:33,320
I think it's ideologically motivated.
I think it's divisive.

657
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:36,110
I think it's dangerous.
it causes chaos.

658
00:39:36,111 --> 00:39:39,950
It confuses people.
There's no upside to it and for any,

659
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:44,540
for every one person that this potential
transformation of legislation is going

660
00:39:44,541 --> 00:39:47,990
to free from oppression.
It's going to definitely confused 100

661
00:39:47,991 --> 00:39:52,991
more
and I say that as I say that as a

662
00:39:53,321 --> 00:39:55,510
clinician with some experience in this
matter,

663
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:00,000
more definitions.
The code does not define the grounds of

664
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:04,170
gender identity,
gender expression or sex instead.

665
00:40:04,171 --> 00:40:07,710
the understanding of these and Other
related terms and the implications for

666
00:40:07,711 --> 00:40:10,710
the code.
That's the ontario human rights code and

667
00:40:10,711 --> 00:40:15,360
ontario human rights commission policies
is evolving from tribunals and court

668
00:40:15,361 --> 00:40:18,180
decisions.
Social science research as well as self

669
00:40:18,181 --> 00:40:21,780
identity and common everyday use more
defInitions.

670
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:25,410
Sex is the anatomical classification of
people as male,

671
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:27,330
female,
or intersex,

672
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:28,950
usually assigned at birth.

673
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:36,110
I should also point out that the closet,
a class of intersex is so rare to be

674
00:40:36,111 --> 00:40:41,111
virtually nonexistent and it isn't
reasonable to make standard policy on

675
00:40:41,661 --> 00:40:45,230
the basis of extreme exceptions,
and the reason for that is that there

676
00:40:45,231 --> 00:40:48,680
are myriads,
millions of extreme exceptions,

677
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:53,300
and it's not possible to constitute a
collective society on the basis of

678
00:40:53,301 --> 00:40:57,080
legislation that's designed for for
exceptions.

679
00:40:57,081 --> 00:41:01,940
It can't be done by definition.
The laws to the law is fundamentally

680
00:41:01,941 --> 00:41:06,941
there to produce a collective agreement.
Okay,

681
00:41:07,921 --> 00:41:11,810
back definitions.
Once again,

682
00:41:11,811 --> 00:41:15,740
gender identity is each person's
internal and individual experience of

683
00:41:15,741 --> 00:41:18,170
gender.
We've already said that a person's

684
00:41:18,171 --> 00:41:23,171
gender identity may be the same or the
same as or different from their birth

685
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,320
assigned sex.
Well,

686
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,213
that's the theory.

687
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:32,930
Gender expression is how a person
publicly expresses a or presents their

688
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:34,910
well.
We've covered that.

689
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,840
There's another addition here.
A person's chosen name and pronoun are

690
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:42,710
also common ways of expressing gender.
others perceive a person's gender

691
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:44,600
through those attributes.
Well,

692
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,270
this is also ontario human rights
commission policy.

693
00:41:47,271 --> 00:41:49,220
Okay,
so this is the scenario I've been

694
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:54,290
running through my head.
I can envision a student or a colleague

695
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:59,530
insisting that I call call them using
gender neutral prOnouns.

696
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,920
She,
zed,

697
00:42:00,921 --> 00:42:02,900
h e or z,
h d for you,

698
00:42:02,901 --> 00:42:05,360
americans,
g or azure?

699
00:42:05,361 --> 00:42:08,180
I think it is.
I'm not doing that.

700
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:11,540
I'm not doing that.
I think it's manipulative.

701
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:14,150
I and I don't,
I don't.

702
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:18,200
Um,
I don't recognize anotHer person's right

703
00:42:18,201 --> 00:42:21,890
to determine what pronouns I use to
address them.

704
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:25,560
I won't do it
now.

705
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:28,690
again,
I think that because of these new laws

706
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,610
and that,
that,

707
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:35,440
that my decision might be illegal and
maybe it's even a decision of hate,

708
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,160
but I'm not doing it.
I think that those gendeR neutral

709
00:42:39,161 --> 00:42:43,680
pronouns are politically motivated.
I think they're connected to an entire

710
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:46,930
underground apparatus of political
motivations,

711
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:51,280
radical left political motivations.
And I think uttering those words makes

712
00:42:51,281 --> 00:42:55,870
me a tool of those motivations.
And I'm going to try to be a tool of my

713
00:42:55,871 --> 00:43:00,160
own motivations as Clearly as I can
articulate them and not the mouthpiece

714
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,050
of some murderous ideology.

715
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:07,310
A person's gender identity definitions
continued.

716
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:10,080
A person's gender identity is
fundamentally different from a not

717
00:43:10,081 --> 00:43:12,450
related to their sexual orientation.
Well,

718
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:17,520
that's rubbish fundamentally because if
you ran a correlation analysis between

719
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:21,720
gender identity and sexual orientation,
the correlation is going to be something

720
00:43:21,721 --> 00:43:25,170
like point nine five,
which indicates an almost perfect

721
00:43:25,171 --> 00:43:27,600
correlation for the vast majority of
people.

722
00:43:27,601 --> 00:43:30,540
Gender identity and sexual orientation
are the same thing,

723
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:35,840
and so it is not fundamentally different
from and not related to their sexual

724
00:43:36,661 --> 00:43:39,180
orientation.
That's just a misstatement of fact

725
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:43,500
perhaps for a minority of people.
Sometimes there are dissociable,

726
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:48,930
but that that doesn't mean that a gender
identity is fundamentally different from

727
00:43:48,931 --> 00:43:53,460
a not related to sexual orientation.
It's a complete misstatement of fact.

728
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:58,210
If there's a correlation of if there's a
correlation of any magnitude between two

729
00:43:58,211 --> 00:44:01,000
things,
then one is related to another and when

730
00:44:01,001 --> 00:44:04,210
the correlation is just about perfect,
well then they are fundamentally

731
00:44:04,211 --> 00:44:05,800
related.
So.

732
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,610
So that's another policy that's based
actually on a lie,

733
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,890
a misstatement and untruth.

734
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:17,220
All right,
so trans or transgender as an umbrella

735
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:19,380
term,
referring to people with diverse gender

736
00:44:19,381 --> 00:44:22,950
identities and expressions that differ
from stereotypical gender norms.

737
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:28,320
It includes but is not limited to people
who identify as transgender trans woman,

738
00:44:28,321 --> 00:44:31,050
trans man,
transexual crossdressers or gender,

739
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:34,470
gender variant or gender queer.
Now,

740
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:40,050
here's what I think about these terms.
You see the people who use these terms

741
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:45,090
want everyone to believe that there are
for all the good things that they say

742
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:48,390
they're for,
but I don't believe any of that.

743
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,650
I don't think that there are for good
things at all.

744
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,370
I think that they use the pretense that
there for good things,

745
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,830
you know,
that they stand for good things to

746
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:03,300
continue their nefarious activity and
one of the most nefarious elements of

747
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:06,540
their activity is the use of these
ideological clubs.

748
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,550
You know,
when the club basically is,

749
00:45:08,551 --> 00:45:11,610
here's the club,
I mean the kind of club that you hit

750
00:45:11,611 --> 00:45:14,970
people with.
If there's a difference in outcome,

751
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:19,290
then it's a consequence of consequence
of racism and bias.

752
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,920
And then if I point out the difference,
then I'm a good person.

753
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,700
So my little routine for wandering
through the world,

754
00:45:26,701 --> 00:45:30,210
making sure that I'm a good person,
unlike those other people who aren't

755
00:45:30,211 --> 00:45:33,510
good people,
that that need to be punished and

756
00:45:33,511 --> 00:45:34,380
perhaps jailed.

757
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,820
I look for inequalities and wherever I
find them,

758
00:45:38,821 --> 00:45:43,821
I attribute them to racism and so that
means I can spend my whole life doing

759
00:45:44,131 --> 00:45:48,990
nothing but being on the side of good by
ferreting out all the evil that resides

760
00:45:48,991 --> 00:45:51,810
in other people and not in me.
I don't trust people like that.

761
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:56,990
I think the continual generation of
these terms is a consequence of the

762
00:45:58,321 --> 00:46:01,470
desire to make that game continue for as
long as possible,

763
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,250
regardless of the consequences so that
the people who hold those opinions can

764
00:46:05,251 --> 00:46:09,090
always be morally correct and have a
whole set of enemies to go after.

765
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:11,460
And that's why the terms keep
multiplying.

766
00:46:11,461 --> 00:46:14,790
Because every time society moves to
become more tolerant,

767
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:17,700
more liberal,
well then that interferes with the game.

768
00:46:17,701 --> 00:46:21,060
Because the game is while we have to
find racist and horrible people.

769
00:46:21,061 --> 00:46:22,680
And so the solution to that is,
well,

770
00:46:22,681 --> 00:46:26,700
let's just continue to generate
categories more and more categories to

771
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:28,500
demonstrate how unequal people are.

772
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:31,200
Well,
because the categories are infinitely

773
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:35,190
divisible and we'll get to that later.
It's a game that never runs out and if

774
00:46:35,191 --> 00:46:39,480
you're a professional,
if you're someone whose profession is to

775
00:46:39,481 --> 00:46:42,150
be politically correct or to be a social
justice warrior,

776
00:46:42,151 --> 00:46:45,000
and that might be an academic,
especially a marxist one,

777
00:46:45,001 --> 00:46:48,330
and in all sorts of sub disciplines will
also get to that later,

778
00:46:48,331 --> 00:46:52,770
like sociology and social work and many
of the social sciences apart from those

779
00:46:52,771 --> 00:46:57,771
two and educational psychology.
That's another major offender in social

780
00:46:58,921 --> 00:47:02,100
psychology and other major offender.
Then you're,

781
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:07,130
you're publicly subsidized for your damn
viewpoints and if you can continue to

782
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:11,190
make the case that the world is full of
racists,

783
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:14,970
racists and people possessed by ethnic
hatred,

784
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,650
you know,
I'm persecuting the poor and minorities.

785
00:47:19,651 --> 00:47:22,920
That your shtick lasts forever and you
can fully justify your,

786
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:27,750
your subsidized position as well as
being on the side of right and morality

787
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:29,920
and making the world better place.

788
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:33,820
WhAt a good deal for everyone who's
politically correct

789
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,970
definition of discrimination and
harassment.

790
00:47:39,971 --> 00:47:41,530
Now,
these are truly terrifying

791
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:46,330
discrimination happens when a person
experiences negative treatment or impact

792
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:50,320
intentional or not because of their
gender identity or gender expression.

793
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:51,610
Okay?
And that could be age,

794
00:47:51,611 --> 00:47:52,510
sex,
race,

795
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:55,450
etc. Okay,
think about that sentence.

796
00:47:56,320 --> 00:48:00,820
Discrimination happens when a person
experiences negative treatment or

797
00:48:00,821 --> 00:48:02,140
impact.
Okay?

798
00:48:02,141 --> 00:48:04,000
So let's say negative impact.
Well,

799
00:48:04,001 --> 00:48:07,780
so what that means is that if I say
something that makes you feel negative

800
00:48:07,781 --> 00:48:10,810
emotion or maybe even interferes with
your happiness because those are

801
00:48:10,811 --> 00:48:15,280
actually separate things,
then you've experienced negative impact.

802
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:16,840
Okay?
Now,

803
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,960
okay,
that's bad enough because it means that

804
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:23,620
you get to decide when what I've said is
not appropriate,

805
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:27,520
but the worst part of it,
and that's not so good because you could

806
00:48:27,521 --> 00:48:31,450
misunderstand me or maybe what I'm
saying is right and you just don't like

807
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:33,340
it or you know,
there's a whole variety of reasons you

808
00:48:33,341 --> 00:48:38,341
might get upset about what I say.
So the fact that you get upset about

809
00:48:38,641 --> 00:48:40,380
something that's negative impact,
but

810
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:45,670
that doesn't necessarily mean that
something bad is how it might even mean

811
00:48:45,671 --> 00:48:47,320
that something's good,
good has happened.

812
00:48:47,321 --> 00:48:51,520
I don't think I've ever learned anything
in my entire life that wasn't preceded

813
00:48:51,521 --> 00:48:54,880
by some kind of negative impact.
We always learn things the hard way,

814
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:58,030
but the worst part of it is the next
phrase,

815
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:01,570
discrimination happens when a person
experiences negative treatment or

816
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:04,030
impact,
intentional or not.

817
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:05,320
Okay?
So here,

818
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,580
think about this.

819
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:10,470
When,
when,

820
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:13,380
when,
when you have little children and maybe

821
00:49:13,381 --> 00:49:17,380
one one runs into the other knox,
knox,

822
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:21,210
even your child down,
you set your child up and the first

823
00:49:21,211 --> 00:49:22,530
thing you say is,
well,

824
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:26,490
barbie didn't mean it.
And the reason you say that is beCause

825
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,490
we've learned and this is painful.
This is.

826
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,830
This is A painful thing that human
beings have learned.

827
00:49:31,831 --> 00:49:36,390
It's at the base of our modern legal
systems that intent matters.

828
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,540
It isn't consequences that you judge its
intent.

829
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:42,990
If I accidentally run into you,
that's way different than if I run into

830
00:49:42,991 --> 00:49:45,030
you on purpose.
You know,

831
00:49:45,031 --> 00:49:46,200
if I,
if I,

832
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,540
if,
if I kill you accidentally,

833
00:49:48,541 --> 00:49:51,660
that's manslaughter at at its worst,
if I kill you with intent,

834
00:49:51,661 --> 00:49:52,470
that's,
that's,

835
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:56,820
that's the worst form of homicide.
We judge people on intent,

836
00:49:56,830 --> 00:50:01,320
northern consequences,
and so this policy is designed to

837
00:50:01,321 --> 00:50:04,440
reverse that.
It'S now possible that you can didn't

838
00:50:04,441 --> 00:50:08,760
discriminate against someone and violate
the law and and I think maybe even be

839
00:50:08,761 --> 00:50:13,110
persecuted for hate crimes because this
is written in such a messy manner by

840
00:50:13,111 --> 00:50:15,840
doing somethIng accidental or
intentional or not

841
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:19,900
well,
who's going to judge that?

842
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,550
Well,
you can imagine who's going to judge

843
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:23,710
that.
The kind of people who would dare to

844
00:50:23,711 --> 00:50:24,544
judge that

845
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:29,570
harassment.
Harassment is a fOrm of discrimination.

846
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:35,410
It can include sexually explicit or
other inappropriate comments,

847
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,870
not defined questions,
jokes,

848
00:50:38,871 --> 00:50:39,561
name,
calling,

849
00:50:39,561 --> 00:50:41,600
images,
email and social media.

850
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:45,080
It doesn't say wHat email and social
media content,

851
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:48,050
just email and social media,
which is anotheR indication of the

852
00:50:48,051 --> 00:50:50,270
appalling level of literacy behind
these,

853
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:53,030
behind these statements,
transphobiC,

854
00:50:53,031 --> 00:50:54,560
homophobic,
or other bullying,

855
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:58,430
sexual advances touching another
unwelcome and ongoing behavior that

856
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,990
insults demeans,
harms are threatened.

857
00:50:59,991 --> 00:51:01,430
Some person in some way.

858
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:06,200
Alright,
so the first thing you might note is

859
00:51:06,201 --> 00:51:09,200
that this has been written to cover the
broadest possible range of

860
00:51:09,201 --> 00:51:11,750
possibilities.
That's the exact opposite of what good

861
00:51:11,751 --> 00:51:16,430
legislation does,
so if you combine these discrimination

862
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:21,580
and harassment that the the policies
basically allow for people to like if I,

863
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:28,070
if I unintentionally negatively impact
you with a joke,

864
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:33,230
then I'm harassing you and that's well
on its way to being well to violation of

865
00:51:33,231 --> 00:51:36,770
the ontario human rights code.
it's an offense according to the ontario

866
00:51:36,771 --> 00:51:40,310
human rights commission and it's on the
way to being a hate crime as far as I

867
00:51:40,311 --> 00:51:42,890
can tell with the modifications of
federal legislation.

868
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,200
So and then to cap it all off,
they throw this in at the end of the

869
00:51:48,201 --> 00:51:53,180
sentence,
other unwelcome and ongoing behavior

870
00:51:53,181 --> 00:51:57,350
that insults demeans,
harms or threatens a person in some way.

871
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:01,320
Okay,
so that's all pretty scary,

872
00:52:01,321 --> 00:52:06,321
but then there's more of course.
And so this is the ontario human rights

873
00:52:06,391 --> 00:52:10,200
commission developing policies on
organizational liability.

874
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:15,620
So listen to this.
Organizations are liable for any

875
00:52:15,631 --> 00:52:18,090
discrimination and harassment that
happens.

876
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:22,480
They are also liable for not
accommodating and a trans person needs,

877
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:24,360
unless it would cause undue hardship.
Well,

878
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,180
the whole issue of undue hardship is a
tricky one because I'm not exactly sure

879
00:52:28,181 --> 00:52:31,810
who adjudicates that in.
You know,

880
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,770
we'll get to that later.
They must deal with complaints,

881
00:52:35,771 --> 00:52:39,160
take steps to prevent problems and
provide a safe welcoming environment for

882
00:52:39,161 --> 00:52:40,240
trans people.
Okay.

883
00:52:40,241 --> 00:52:41,200
And,
and you know,

884
00:52:41,201 --> 00:52:43,750
old people and,
and ethnic,

885
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:48,010
ethnically diverse people and you know,
differently gendered people and all of

886
00:52:48,011 --> 00:52:52,180
that.
So fine organizations are liable for any

887
00:52:52,181 --> 00:52:54,250
discrimination and harassment that
happens.

888
00:52:54,251 --> 00:52:56,530
Okay,
well that puts a hell of an onus on the

889
00:52:56,531 --> 00:53:00,220
organization because it isn't exactly
clear to me how organizations are going

890
00:53:00,221 --> 00:53:04,960
to monitor all of their people all of
the time in the organizations.

891
00:53:04,961 --> 00:53:07,720
What if they're using social media
outside the organization?

892
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:11,020
So organizations are now liable for all
of this.

893
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:12,610
So how are you going to police all that?

894
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:14,710
Okay,
next

895
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:17,940
more on liability

896
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:24,350
from the ontario human rights code under
section 46 point three of the code,

897
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:27,540
a corporation trade union or
occupational association,

898
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:30,630
unincorporated association or employees
organization.

899
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:35,690
Now listen to this will be held
responsible for discrimination including

900
00:53:36,211 --> 00:53:40,530
acts or omissions committed by employees
or agents in the course of their

901
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:42,870
employment.
This is known as vicarious liability.

902
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:46,350
Okay.
Responsible parties violate the code.

903
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,410
Now this is where it gets.
This is where it gets horrible,

904
00:53:49,411 --> 00:53:52,320
I think where they directly or
indirectly,

905
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:56,010
intentionally or unintentionally
infringed the code or rather the

906
00:53:56,011 --> 00:53:58,500
otherwise authorized,
condoned or adopt behavior that is

907
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:01,560
contrary to the code.
It is unacceptable to choose to remain

908
00:54:01,561 --> 00:54:04,800
unaware,
ignore or fail to address potential or

909
00:54:04,801 --> 00:54:08,490
actual human rights violations.
Whether or not a complaint is made,

910
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:13,970
god you couldn't possibly design a
broader definition of liability

911
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:19,970
potential or actual human rights
violations.

912
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:22,190
Whether or not a complaint is made,
okay,

913
00:54:22,191 --> 00:54:26,420
so does that.
That means that you have vicarious

914
00:54:26,421 --> 00:54:31,421
liability.
If you fail to address a potential human

915
00:54:34,691 --> 00:54:37,810
rights violation,
whether or not a complaint is made.

916
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,910
The only thing I can say about
legislation that's written in this

917
00:54:45,911 --> 00:54:49,960
manner is that it seems to me to be
consciously designed to get as many

918
00:54:49,961 --> 00:54:52,540
people in trouble as possible.

919
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:55,831
That's it.
It,

920
00:54:55,831 --> 00:54:57,910
it.
It's designed to get as many people as

921
00:54:57,911 --> 00:54:59,620
possible in trouble at the same time,

922
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:08,180
so that brings us to the end of part one
of this talk on political correctness in

923
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:14,300
it described the increasing fear that's
spread by politically correct activism

924
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:19,770
throughout large organizations including
academic institutions like the

925
00:55:19,771 --> 00:55:24,771
university of toronto.
I also discussed the increasing all

926
00:55:24,991 --> 00:55:29,700
pervasiveness of this viewpoint because
it's not something that's localized

927
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:34,701
anymore to academic institutions.
It's spread beyond them and his is

928
00:55:36,991 --> 00:55:41,991
characteristic of the preoccupations of,
of a certain kind of administrator at a

929
00:55:44,911 --> 00:55:47,340
very large multitude of large
organizations.

930
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:52,120
And I described in detail the canadian
bill [inaudible],

931
00:55:52,590 --> 00:55:56,190
which is an attempt to modify the
canadian human rights code and the

932
00:55:56,191 --> 00:56:01,191
criminal code a to make a whole variety
of speech acts and the holding of

933
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:05,040
certain opinions or the articulate
lading of them,

934
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:08,790
um,
criminal and maybe even criminal under

935
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:11,370
the provisions of the hate of hate crime
legislation.

936
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:16,680
In part two,
I'm going to give you a more detailed

937
00:56:16,681 --> 00:56:20,970
analysis of the university of toronto's
attempts to transform its hr department

938
00:56:20,971 --> 00:56:25,390
into a politically correct organization.
I'm using the,

939
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:30,570
the goals of the university of toronto
as a cautionary tale about how such

940
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,970
political maneuvers operate at a local
level.

941
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:39,880
Again,
on the principle that a good story about

942
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:44,800
something local is a good story about
something with general significance.

943
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:48,010
In part three,
I'm going to talk about what individuals

944
00:56:48,011 --> 00:56:50,710
can do about these sorts of things,
what you as a citizen,

945
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:55,870
how you as a citizen might arm yourself
intellectually so that you can

946
00:56:55,900 --> 00:57:00,900
articulate a stance against this kind of
movement if you feel that that's in your

947
00:57:01,361 --> 00:57:05,140
best interests.
Thanks for listening.

948
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:08,320
If you want to support endeavors such as
these,

949
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:11,680
such as these,
please visit my patriot on site which

950
00:57:11,681 --> 00:57:15,760
allows you to do so.
It's a monthly subscription site that

951
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:20,530
helps me develop these videos and
continue my work on them.

952
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:23,650
Um,
and who knows if things keep up the way

953
00:57:23,651 --> 00:57:26,770
they are.
Maybe it'll be my only source of income.

954
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:29,770
Um,
after it becomes impossible for me to

955
00:57:29,771 --> 00:57:32,530
work at a university and say what I want
to say.

956
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,790
If you want to provide such support,
just google patrion,
