1
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,160
Yeah,
please join me in welcoming the

2
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:17,880
disciplines.

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,880
[inaudible]

4
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,200
hey,
so I know everybody's really eager to

5
00:00:26,201 --> 00:00:29,710
get into the question resolution at hand
and to hear from our speakers.

6
00:00:29,711 --> 00:00:34,240
So I will just introduce the resolution
and the format people have the legal

7
00:00:34,241 --> 00:00:36,910
right to decide.
He resolved that people up the legal

8
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:41,200
right to decide the pronouns by which
they will be addressed and you'll notice

9
00:00:41,201 --> 00:00:44,480
that we've dropped him disrobe
resolutions that we can discuss the law

10
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:48,130
as it is,
as it ought to be and various levels of

11
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,210
law,
provincial offices,

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,560
rollers,
federal laws.

13
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,750
Um,
and we will,

14
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,590
each speaker will speak for 15 minutes
and openings and then they'll have 10

15
00:00:56,591 --> 00:00:59,650
minutes each for bottles.
And then we'll have ample amount of time

16
00:00:59,651 --> 00:01:03,310
for questions and answers,
which I'm sure many of you have a for

17
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:05,890
both of our participants,
especially Dr. Peterson.

18
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,680
Um,
just one quick note about the spirit and

19
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,720
is going to proceed.
Um,

20
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:16,030
we are here gathered as jurists,
as officers of the court or future

21
00:01:16,031 --> 00:01:19,660
offers through as of the court in a
spirit of openness and inquiry,

22
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,120
um,
about the laws that we subject ourselves

23
00:01:22,121 --> 00:01:24,280
to.
And the laws that we govern and how they

24
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,530
shape our interactions as society.
Um,

25
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,720
so we are proceeding fearlessly and
openly and respectfully.

26
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,430
Um,
so professor party,

27
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,403
okay,
start.

28
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,600
Okay,
let's have happening

29
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,960
daily ready

30
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,200
be Queens full for inviting me to this
and putting it on.

31
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,670
You know,
this is exactly the kind of thing that

32
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,610
running mead was conceived before.
So,

33
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,121
uh,
you know,

34
00:01:55,121 --> 00:01:57,520
Nice,
nice job and a hope.

35
00:01:57,521 --> 00:02:00,670
We have a good evening.
Don't hesitate when we get on to the

36
00:02:00,671 --> 00:02:03,760
later stages,
the speak up and say your peace.

37
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:05,260
We're here to talk.
All right,

38
00:02:05,261 --> 00:02:07,300
so don't be shy.
I'm sure you will.

39
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:12,550
The resolution as stated really as
Joanna mentioned,

40
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,950
raises two questions.
One,

41
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,280
what the law actually is as of today and
secondly what the law ought to be.

42
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,540
And I suspect that Professor Peterson
and I might actually agree on the first

43
00:02:28,301 --> 00:02:30,280
one,
what the law is.

44
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:35,340
I think it's pretty clear that the law
as it exists right now as reflected in

45
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:42,841
the Ontario human rights code is that
this is true.

46
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,620
When you're read to you,
this is section one of the Ontario Human

47
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,710
Rights Code.
And I know you've probably heard this

48
00:02:53,711 --> 00:02:56,050
before.
Every person has a right to equal

49
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,540
treatment with respect to services,
goods at facilities,

50
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:02,650
and that's been included to include
education at the post secondary level

51
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,480
without discrimination because of an a
whole bunch of numerated items including

52
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,780
gender identity and gender expression.
Now it doesn't talk about pronouns per

53
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:18,961
se in the statute,
but according to the Human Rights

54
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,000
Commission of Ontario,
that's one thing it should include and

55
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:26,230
there are decisions of tribunals
especially I haven't BC,

56
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:29,050
again,
not directly on the point in the

57
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:32,920
classroom about the pronouns,
but enough to suggest that that's a

58
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,640
logical extension of the proposition.
In section one,

59
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:43,350
the more interesting question is not
what the law is but what it ought to be.

60
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:50,260
Whether or not that state of the law is
good,

61
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,740
something that we should approve them
and I'm here to argue in the affirmative

62
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,860
that that's exactly the way it's
supposed to be.

63
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:04,500
I'm going to go with these through these
essential five points to make my cases.

64
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,680
They're talking about free speech first
and then about free speech in

65
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:14,590
classrooms,
the nature of gender privacy questions

66
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,730
and then the nature of language itself.
All right.

67
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,170
First,
let's talk about free speech because

68
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,400
this question is often framed in the
context of two opposing forces,

69
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,340
one being free speech and liberty on the
one hand and on the other sort of a,

70
00:04:32,341 --> 00:04:35,740
a tyrannical government,
a social justice warriors trying to shut

71
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:39,490
down the ability of individuals to speak
for themselves,

72
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,270
and I want to suggest to you that that's
actually an artificial dichotomy.

73
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:49,890
Let me put it to you this way.
There actually is no such thing as free

74
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:53,524
speech.

75
00:04:55,510 --> 00:05:00,510
What I mean by that is that the law is
full of limits on speech.

76
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,690
I mean,
let us count the ways.

77
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:10,000
Speech is limited by the law of
defamation.

78
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,970
You can't go off and talk about your
neighbor in the repertory terms.

79
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:17,140
If it's not true,
you'll be sued.

80
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,430
Speech is limited by the law of
negligence.

81
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,970
You can't yell fire in a crowded theater
if there isn't one,

82
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:32,790
you'll be held liable for injuries.
We even have a tort called the

83
00:05:33,221 --> 00:05:36,040
intentional infliction of emotional
harm.

84
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,800
That harm being afflicted most of the
time by speech.

85
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,660
Speech is regulated and limited by the
criminal law.

86
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:52,650
We have laws that prohibit counseling a
crime suggesting to somebody or

87
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:57,740
arranging for somebody to go off and
commit a crime.

88
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,100
Even if all you've done is speak words.
We have laws that prohibit hate speech,

89
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,290
which is nothing more than speech.

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We even have restrictions of speech in
the area as minor as consumer law

91
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,460
restrictions on advertising where and
when and what it can say.

92
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,240
The proposition is this.
It is not a general rule that speech is

93
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:30,710
free.
What we have is a starting point of

94
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,770
freedom of expression in the charter and
then we have reasonable limits as

95
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:41,171
defined by societal needs.
And the question is not whether or not

96
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:45,320
this speech is free,
it's whether or not those limits are

97
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:50,180
reasonable and the reasonableness of the
limits can be defined by whether or not

98
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:52,580
they achieve a common good.
All right,

99
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,390
so let's get off this black and white
and go.

100
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,320
This is a matter of gray and in the gray
I think,

101
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,700
I hope you'll agree with me that the
gray favors this kind of outcome.

102
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:10,910
So on the point number two,
we're talking here about the ability of

103
00:07:10,911 --> 00:07:15,200
somebody to decide the programs by which
they will be addressed.

104
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:18,890
Now that's a general proposition,
but our particular focus is of course

105
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:21,620
the classroom.
So there's a student of the boss and the

106
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:26,030
teacher and the teacher refers to that
person that's came over her and that

107
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:26,721
person says,
well,

108
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:29,870
I don't want to be thought of,
I don't want to be referred to as a him

109
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:32,060
or her.
I want something to be gender neutral.

110
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,730
A third thing,
if you like

111
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,440
question,
is speech more free or less free in

112
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:47,750
classrooms than it is on the street.
I've suggested those various

113
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:52,751
restrictions that exist in the law in
general in the classroom.

114
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,840
I'd like to suggest that speech is even
more restraint because there are

115
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:03,110
obligations,
there are relationships between teacher

116
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:06,350
and students and between students and
institution.

117
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,470
So for example,
this doesn't speak to this question

118
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,710
specifically,
but just by way of example to show you

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,820
to illustrate that there are more
restrictions on speech.

120
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,950
How would you feel if you're in your
classroom,

121
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:24,170
you started off the semester and the
professor in question would refused to

122
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:28,670
refer to you by anything other than you
slimy weasel.

123
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:36,260
Now don't you think you would have a
complaint?

124
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,890
Maybe not even based on kind of the
human rights code,

125
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,830
but just on pure administrative law
principles.

126
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:48,220
Those principles suggest that a teacher
in a classroom has at least a minimum of

127
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:54,200
the responsibility to be unbiased,
to apply an even hand.

128
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:00,270
And if through language that even hand
is clearly not being addressed,

129
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,160
uh,
express,

130
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,520
then I would have saw it.
There is some kind of legal remedy

131
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,990
insight.
There are lots of other examples both in

132
00:09:09,991 --> 00:09:13,230
the classroom and outside.
Let's say you have earned a phd

133
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,760
and a person in authority.
Perhaps it's the teacher.

134
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:19,200
Perhaps it's a,
an official,

135
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,860
it doesn't really matter who it is,
but in some kind of official capacity

136
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,020
refuses will not call you.
Doctor wants to call you,

137
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:31,530
Mr,
which is actually not the title that

138
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:36,531
you've earned.
What if you're a woman and you are not

139
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:42,921
married and the teacher insists upon
calling you miss and you want to be

140
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,890
called Ms,
which is the neutral form.

141
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,760
Now,
once upon a time we were having the same

142
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:55,761
debate about myth
woman wanting to be called ms and the

143
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,980
powers that be back at that time said,
look,

144
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:01,570
there's only two.
There's Mrs or miss.

145
00:10:01,571 --> 00:10:04,000
Choose one.
Here we are again.

146
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,170
We have to choose one.
Actually there is a third choice.

147
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,810
I want to suggest that there are also
examples.

148
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:23,811
You will here to object to this idea.
Would you raise a false equivalency?

149
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:30,030
This does not say anybody has the right
to insist upon being called anything

150
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,160
because you can think of examples where
that just don't do so.

151
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:37,080
If I had a student in my classroom,
he said,

152
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,680
professor,
I would like you here for and from now

153
00:10:40,681 --> 00:10:42,810
on to police to refer to me as Your
Majesty.

154
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,840
Well,
I'm not going to do that.

155
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:49,950
I'm sorry because objectively speaking
you are not wealthy unless you can show

156
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:52,260
me your crown.
All right,

157
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:56,820
so the question is not as broad as that.
The question is actually very narrow and

158
00:10:56,821 --> 00:11:00,030
limited.
It's limited to the question of the

159
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:05,031
proper pronoun to be used for a person
who is gender neutral,

160
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,810
which brings me to point number three
and that is the nature of gender.

161
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:15,350
I want to distinguish between two
related but different ideas and those

162
00:11:16,291 --> 00:11:21,291
two ideas are gender and sex.
Now,

163
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,210
I'm not a biologist,
I'm not a psychologist,

164
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,950
I'm just a lawyer.
Emphasis on being the word justice,

165
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:35,270
but I'm going to suggest to you that the
two ideas can be distinguished this way.

166
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:42,170
Sex being the bio,
biological idea and gender being the

167
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:44,094
cultural idea,

168
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,390
you might be able to determine
somebody's sex by looking at objective

169
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:53,410
factors.
Maybe not,

170
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:54,750
I don't know,
but I'm going to,

171
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,910
I'm going to entertain that possibility.
I'm not sure you can do the same thing

172
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:04,010
for gender because gender is an
inherently subjective thing.

173
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,520
Unlike whether or not somebody qualifies
for the title,

174
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:13,540
Your Majesty.
I would have thought that whether or not

175
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:18,541
you are a male or a female or a neither
in gender terms is something only you

176
00:12:20,141 --> 00:12:20,974
can tell us.

177
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:23,983
Okay.

178
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:29,250
So I think that distinguishes the
subjective questions from the object of

179
00:12:29,251 --> 00:12:31,230
one.
As soon as you had a subjective

180
00:12:31,231 --> 00:12:35,280
question,
that the choice has to be determined by

181
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:37,260
the person who was being addressed.

182
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,570
So on to privacy,

183
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,940
our insistence upon a binary choice that
he or she in a sense reflects our need

184
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:04,060
to categorize.
But the strange thing about that need is

185
00:13:04,311 --> 00:13:09,170
that it is based upon information that
really is very personal.

186
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,020
Now,
much of the time you can tell through

187
00:13:12,021 --> 00:13:15,680
outward appearance,
but if you look at the bottom line,

188
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,340
what you're,
what you actually need,

189
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:24,640
I think to insist upon that choice.
Aren't you really asking after all at

190
00:13:26,781 --> 00:13:31,100
the bottom of it all,
you're insisting to know what that

191
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:36,101
person's junk looks like
and really nobody else's business.

192
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:44,351
But Yours,
if you refuse to indicate with the junk

193
00:13:46,341 --> 00:13:48,860
is life.
And if you,

194
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,170
and it's not clear on the,
on the face of things,

195
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:54,590
and I use that word on purpose,
which way you're going to go,

196
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,330
why should the world care?
It's really all about you.

197
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,070
I don't know.
They're just trying to categorize.

198
00:14:02,071 --> 00:14:03,750
I want to see if your one thing or the
other thing,

199
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:08,610
it doesn't matter what you are and in
fact it doesn't matter so much that you

200
00:14:08,611 --> 00:14:10,860
might be a third thing or somewhere in
between.

201
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:18,580
In other words,
nobody has the right to pry to obtain

202
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:23,170
the information necessary to make the
choice between he or she.

203
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:24,783
Okay,

204
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,150
and so finally,
let's talk about language because this

205
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,160
after all is about like we may in fact
be talking about a peculiar

206
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:44,511
characteristic of the English language
because as of right now the English

207
00:14:44,911 --> 00:14:49,911
language has just two personal pronouns
but can be used for human beings.

208
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,690
We have a third one.
It's called yet,

209
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,230
but this doesn't fit very well when
you're trying to talk about it.

210
00:14:56,231 --> 00:15:00,680
He moved there.
The English language is not unique in

211
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:01,431
this,
but not,

212
00:15:01,431 --> 00:15:05,780
nor is it universal.
There are other languages that do have

213
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,120
either a neutral third choice or are not
gendered in the first place.

214
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,240
One might be inclined to resolve this
debate by looking through the dictionary

215
00:15:19,311 --> 00:15:20,930
and say,
well I'm sorry,

216
00:15:20,931 --> 00:15:23,060
there's only two in there.
There is no third,

217
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,660
the third that you want me to use,
I can't find.

218
00:15:26,661 --> 00:15:29,480
And therefore it's not part of the
language and therefore I'm not going to

219
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:33,380
do that.
But the thing about language,

220
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:38,890
both English and all the others is that
essentially evolutionary changes over

221
00:15:42,201 --> 00:15:45,620
time.
And if you look in the dictionary today

222
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:51,370
and don't find that third thing,
look again in a year and two years,

223
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,940
in five years,
it will be there.

224
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,480
So the fact of its absence at the moment
is really not determinative of anything.

225
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:07,940
It's coming.
We might as well be ahead of the curve

226
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,840
then behind
and with that I'll give it the song.

227
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,203
Yeah.

228
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,850
So one of the things that I don't like
to do in the discussion,

229
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,620
and I suppose this is part of the whole
problem,

230
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,540
is I don't like to see linguistic
territory to the people with whom I

231
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:03,510
disagree.
And that's actually part of the reason

232
00:17:03,511 --> 00:17:07,860
why I have refused,
let's say,

233
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,160
to use a set of pronouns
that I believe are every believe the use

234
00:17:15,691 --> 00:17:18,990
of them is irrelevant in some sense to
this particular issue because I actually

235
00:17:18,991 --> 00:17:21,510
think the issue is quite a bit deeper.
Um,

236
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,183
just

237
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:30,430
and so part of my objection to using
those particular pronouns was the lack

238
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:35,471
of my desire to seed linguistic ground
to people whose political,

239
00:17:35,781 --> 00:17:40,100
philosophical,
and even deeper moral stances I do not

240
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:44,420
agree with in the slightest.
And as soon as you see linguistic ground

241
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,380
to your last call them adversaries,
you have decided that you're going to

242
00:17:49,381 --> 00:17:53,910
play a game within the rules that they
have established and therefore you lose.

243
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:59,540
So that's why I'm taking the objection
to some degree to the way that this is

244
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,460
formulated.
Because it isn't really about the right

245
00:18:02,461 --> 00:18:07,461
to decide.
It's about the right to insist upon by

246
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:10,170
force.
And you might say,

247
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,710
well,
what constitutes force?

248
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,720
Well,
I debated Brenda Cossman a lawyer and

249
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,630
she said,
because I had made the claim,

250
00:18:21,631 --> 00:18:26,100
let's say that you can be jailed for not
using this particular category of

251
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:30,390
pronouns,
which we've already agreed is enshrined

252
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,680
the necessity for doing so.

253
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,750
It was already in tried within the
current legislation.

254
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:37,380
So I'm glad that you agreed upon that.
And she basically insisted that

255
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:41,760
according to the surrounding policies,
you couldn't be jailed for that they

256
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:43,590
could just take away everything you
owned.

257
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,020
And,
and I thought that was extremely

258
00:18:46,021 --> 00:18:49,350
interesting first of all because she
seemed to think that that was all right,

259
00:18:49,351 --> 00:18:52,710
but also because she didn't actually
notice that that was kind of the point

260
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:56,670
that I was making.
Plus if you don't agree or act out the,

261
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,230
uh,
what would you call it?

262
00:18:58,231 --> 00:19:00,780
The judgement of the human rights
tribunal,

263
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:03,780
then they can take you to,
I believe it's Ontario Superior Court

264
00:19:03,781 --> 00:19:06,390
where they can nail you for captain then
and they can put you in jail.

265
00:19:06,391 --> 00:19:07,320
So yeah.
Okay,

266
00:19:07,321 --> 00:19:08,490
fine.
You know,

267
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,250
it's a nuance,
but um,

268
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:13,200
it's a non,
it's a nontrivial direct route and

269
00:19:13,201 --> 00:19:15,270
people have in fact been jailed for such
thing.

270
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:18,510
So,
so let's get to the insist upon by force

271
00:19:18,511 --> 00:19:22,740
issue here because that's where the the
issue and that's the way that this

272
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:25,920
should be formulated.
And so well we could also,

273
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:30,240
there's another problem here too.
And the problem is,

274
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:34,440
well which pronouns exactly and you
might say,

275
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:39,470
well I'm transsexual male to female to
be addressed as she and the reverse as

276
00:19:41,671 --> 00:19:43,920
he and in fact most transsexuals,
in fact,

277
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:48,810
the overwhelming majority of them,
there are about maybe 0.3% of the

278
00:19:48,811 --> 00:19:50,820
population to begin with.
And I would estimate,

279
00:19:50,821 --> 00:19:54,000
although I don't know for sure that it's
99% of them,

280
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,530
but no one really knows actually want to
be addressed by he or she.

281
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,360
They just want to be addressed by the
other one.

282
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,180
Okay.
So there's a tiny minority the size of

283
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:07,860
which no one knows who insists that that
particular categorizing categorization

284
00:20:07,861 --> 00:20:09,450
scheme,
it doesn't apply to them.

285
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,910
So the question then is,
which one does,

286
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:15,270
and the problem with that is that you
cannot actually answer that question.

287
00:20:15,271 --> 00:20:16,110
And I can,
I can,

288
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,590
I can give you a hint about that.
With regards to the ever lengthening,

289
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:23,280
uh,
acronym used by the lgbt community to

290
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:26,940
describe those who are marginalized,
you may notice that every year there's

291
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:31,941
an additional initial in that acronym.
And the reason for that is that the

292
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:37,401
potential number of identities will
multiply until it fraction down to the

293
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:44,031
level of the individual itself.
It has to because you're not a group,

294
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,350
you're not a member of a group.
You're the simultaneous member of

295
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:48,820
multiple groups.
In fact,

296
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:51,250
so many groups that they can't even be a
numerated.

297
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:56,800
And if my linguistic usage is predicated
on recognizing all of those identities

298
00:20:56,801 --> 00:21:00,340
while we might as well just go home now
because I don't have time to come up

299
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:03,010
with a million different descriptive
pronouns,

300
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:06,280
that property going or less evolved the
free market.

301
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,850
Because one of the things the free
market does is enable you to recognize

302
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:14,851
your multi-dimensional exist and say and
mind simultaneously using mutually

303
00:21:16,331 --> 00:21:20,230
agreed upon price as the determinant
that takes all of those factors

304
00:21:20,231 --> 00:21:24,180
simultaneously into account.
And actually on a pure computational

305
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:26,230
level,
there isn't any other solution to that

306
00:21:26,231 --> 00:21:28,570
problem because it's actually in
computable.

307
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,650
So the Pronoun problem becomes very,
very problematic,

308
00:21:32,651 --> 00:21:33,760
very,
very rapidly.

309
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:37,450
You can see that with the acronym growth
in the lgbt community,

310
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,970
which will,
which has to fractioning.

311
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:44,500
We'll continue the fractured because
none of those groups are homogenous in,

312
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:49,540
in any but the most trivial of senses.
So that's a big problem.

313
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,970
Which pronouns?
Okay,

314
00:21:51,971 --> 00:21:54,430
so what sort of problem is that?
Well,

315
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:00,250
in New York state for example,
they've already more or less passed into

316
00:22:00,251 --> 00:22:04,840
law the proposition that there are
pretty much as many pronoun descriptors

317
00:22:04,841 --> 00:22:06,970
as there are people claiming identities.

318
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:11,230
And so on facebook for example,
which is a good example of saint common

319
00:22:11,231 --> 00:22:13,990
parlance,
it's about 71 different gender

320
00:22:13,991 --> 00:22:18,280
identities already recognize and no
agreed upon lexicon to represent any of

321
00:22:18,281 --> 00:22:20,980
them.
And so the issue there is,

322
00:22:20,981 --> 00:22:23,440
well what stops the infinite
multiplication?

323
00:22:23,441 --> 00:22:26,860
And the answer to that is wim.
And that's actually written into the law

324
00:22:26,861 --> 00:22:30,790
because the law already states that your
identity is predicated on your

325
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:34,120
subjective and I would say whim and
that's also wrong.

326
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:38,710
It isn't.
So I was watching Louis C k and the

327
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:43,711
other night and you know he's a great
philosopher and he said if you,

328
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:49,590
I'm sorry I don't normally use profanity
but Louis C K does and I am quoting him,

329
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:52,840
you said,
well if you call someone an asshole they

330
00:22:52,841 --> 00:22:55,480
can't actually object because it's not
up to them.

331
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,300
It's up to someone else to determine if
that's the case because that that

332
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,280
identity classification is actually a so
socially negotiated process.

333
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,930
And that's the thing about your
identity,

334
00:23:07,931 --> 00:23:11,470
the idea that your identity is this
subjective construct.

335
00:23:11,471 --> 00:23:14,950
It's like I am being literally truthful
about that.

336
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:19,390
That's what two year olds think and
that's why they can't play with others.

337
00:23:19,391 --> 00:23:24,100
So two year olds are egocentric and they
cannot expand their conception of the

338
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:28,150
world to include the minds of others.
They don't really learn to do that until

339
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,860
between two and four.
And by the way,

340
00:23:29,861 --> 00:23:32,530
if they don't learn that by four,
they never learn it.

341
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:37,840
And so by the time they're for what they
learn is that your identity is actually

342
00:23:37,841 --> 00:23:41,560
a negotiation.
It's a negotiation from moment to moment

343
00:23:41,561 --> 00:23:43,480
and also throughout the course of your
life.

344
00:23:43,481 --> 00:23:46,400
So for example,
even a child who was pretending knows

345
00:23:46,401 --> 00:23:50,720
that you be the mom all be the dad will
play house.

346
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,360
You can take on that identity at all
take on this one.

347
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,320
But we both have to agree on what the
identity is or we can't play.

348
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:01,460
So your identity is actually part of the
Public Commons and the idea that it's

349
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,520
your subjective determination is it's so
primordially wrong psychologically that

350
00:24:07,671 --> 00:24:10,070
doesn't even register.
So,

351
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,610
and the notion that's already written
into the law and that's an absolute

352
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:16,550
catastrophe because in every possible
way,

353
00:24:16,551 --> 00:24:18,470
developmentally,
psychologically,

354
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:21,200
um,
philosophically,

355
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,800
biologically it's a completely untenable
proposition.

356
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,500
But it doesn't matter because it's
already written into the law.

357
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,100
It's like your identity.
It's like your reputation.

358
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:34,010
You think you get to have the reputation
you want.

359
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,540
Well,
good luck with that one.

360
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,490
We're so good at tracking reputation
that if we haven't evolved module for

361
00:24:40,491 --> 00:24:42,920
remembering reputation,
you cheat once.

362
00:24:42,921 --> 00:24:45,920
I'll never forget it and you don't get
to object to that,

363
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,570
you know?
I mean you can,

364
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:50,510
but that isn't going to change the
outcome and it doesn't change the fact

365
00:24:50,511 --> 00:24:53,930
that your reputation,
which is certainly a major part of your

366
00:24:53,931 --> 00:24:56,330
identity,
is something that's dependent on the

367
00:24:56,331 --> 00:24:58,250
interactions that you have with other
people.

368
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:03,250
Do that to revert to the notion that
that's a purely subjective construct is

369
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,650
it's just,
I just can't even believe that we're

370
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:10,820
seriously considering that at much less
writing it into the law.

371
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,240
And then there's something even more
appalling going on underneath the law

372
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:21,050
then that which is we have actually
written into the law now a social

373
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:25,220
constructivist view of identity.
And so the social constructivists

374
00:25:25,221 --> 00:25:29,930
roughly believe that all elements of
human identity are socially constructed,

375
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,250
which is very peculiar because at the
same time they also insist that all of

376
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:38,360
your identity is subjective whim.
And those two propositions aren't

377
00:25:38,361 --> 00:25:41,180
logically commensurate,
but you know the people who are

378
00:25:41,181 --> 00:25:43,730
generating this sort of thing and don't
really care about logical

379
00:25:43,731 --> 00:25:46,160
commensurability.
But in any case,

380
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:51,460
the proposition that your identity is
somehow unmoored from a reality outside

381
00:25:52,491 --> 00:25:54,830
of your subjective saying linguistic
space.

382
00:25:54,831 --> 00:25:55,970
It's also,
it's,

383
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,590
it's,
it's wrong.

384
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,990
There's no other way of putting it.
So like,

385
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,700
and this is written into the law
already.

386
00:26:01,701 --> 00:26:05,540
So the proposition is that biological
sex,

387
00:26:05,541 --> 00:26:09,590
which many of the holders of,
of saying what admiration for this law

388
00:26:09,591 --> 00:26:11,810
don't even believe exists,
which I,

389
00:26:11,811 --> 00:26:13,670
I don't even know what to say about
that.

390
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,670
But the proposition is that biological
sex,

391
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:22,570
gender identity,
gender expression and sexual preference

392
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,700
vary independently.
That's the law.

393
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:28,550
And it's wrong.
It isn't even close to right.

394
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,170
He doesn't mean they don't very but very
independently as a whole different

395
00:26:33,171 --> 00:26:34,940
propositions,
playfully,

396
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,390
completely different proposition.
So looking at this way,

397
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,750
okay,
so here's biological sex will say

398
00:26:41,751 --> 00:26:44,140
there's some amount of overlap.
I don't care,

399
00:26:44,141 --> 00:26:49,141
like make me overlap this much.
It's not because the only 0.3% of people

400
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:54,210
are miscategorized by their biological
sex.

401
00:26:54,211 --> 00:26:55,890
Okay.
So then you think,

402
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,160
well,
in terms of gender identity,

403
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:04,250
it's 99.7% of people have the same
gender identity as their biological sex.

404
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,150
So much for independent variation,
there's some variation,

405
00:27:09,151 --> 00:27:12,870
but it's not independent.
Then you add gender expression on top of

406
00:27:12,871 --> 00:27:13,471
that.
You say,

407
00:27:13,471 --> 00:27:15,870
well,
the vast majority of people who are have

408
00:27:15,871 --> 00:27:20,871
one biological sex and the same vial on
the same gender express that the same

409
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,910
way.
And almost all of those,

410
00:27:23,911 --> 00:27:28,911
we could say 97% it's probably more like
98% but maybe it's 95 I don't care.

411
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:35,870
Have the sexual orientation that you
would expect if you knew their

412
00:27:36,361 --> 00:27:39,330
biological sex,
their gender identity and their gender

413
00:27:39,331 --> 00:27:42,630
expression.
So the idea that those are very

414
00:27:42,631 --> 00:27:43,980
independently,
it's like,

415
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:44,940
okay,
fine.

416
00:27:44,941 --> 00:27:49,260
But what that means is that you either
don't know what the word independently

417
00:27:49,261 --> 00:27:52,620
means or you don't care or you've
defined it,

418
00:27:52,621 --> 00:27:54,990
you've redefined it completely.
Well,

419
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,900
he can't just muck about with the law.
That way,

420
00:27:57,901 --> 00:28:00,930
you know,
you can't instantiate a philosophical

421
00:28:00,931 --> 00:28:03,900
viewpoint into the law without noting
what you're doing,

422
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:07,980
especially if it's palpably false.
And this entire,

423
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,170
uh,
and this is partly the reason that I

424
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:12,300
objected to the thing to begin with.
It's like

425
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:18,860
apart from these logical and tenability,
given the infinite multiple

426
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:24,390
multiplication of potential identities,
apart from the fact that there's no

427
00:28:24,391 --> 00:28:29,190
consensus whatsoever on what set of
pronouns you should even hypothetically

428
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:31,880
use apart from the fact that,
um,

429
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:37,710
your identity is as socially negotiated
phenomena at its core.

430
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,860
Well,
there's the ultimate foolishness of the

431
00:28:43,861 --> 00:28:48,861
proposition that there's no relationship
between these four levels of the manner

432
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:51,570
in which human beings conceptualize
themselves.

433
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:56,040
And that's all tangled up in this one
piece of legislation,

434
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:57,300
which is why

435
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:04,890
the idea that people should have the
right legal right to force other people

436
00:29:06,221 --> 00:29:11,221
to recognize the particular game that
they're playing at that moment is it's

437
00:29:12,191 --> 00:29:15,370
multidimensionally observed and worse
than that,

438
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:18,130
it's dangerous.
And now we'll complete with that.

439
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:23,050
The reason that it's dangerous as far as
I can tell is because it's also the

440
00:29:23,051 --> 00:29:25,750
expression of an underlying all call it
ideology.

441
00:29:25,751 --> 00:29:29,270
You could call it a philosophy,
but I don't think it actually qualifies.

442
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,600
Although,
and it's mostly postmodern and the

443
00:29:31,601 --> 00:29:35,620
postmodernist are very smart people.
But you know the smart ones,

444
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:38,860
but their uh,
their,

445
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:44,820
their notion of what truth and reality
is debatable at best and pathological at

446
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,510
worst and that that's a problem because
this kind of legislation,

447
00:29:49,511 --> 00:29:53,560
he emerges immediately out of that
philosophical context and philosophy

448
00:29:53,561 --> 00:29:57,040
matters.
It's the axioms by which you Orient

449
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,110
Yourself in the world.
Those things mattered.

450
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,990
And if you write a whole new set of
axioms into the law,

451
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:06,460
which we've already done by the way,
they're going to unfold the unfold

452
00:30:06,461 --> 00:30:10,540
according to their inner logic and you
don't have any choice about that.

453
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,700
They unfold in some sense all by
themselves.

454
00:30:12,701 --> 00:30:17,050
Just like if a virus invades your body,
it unfolds all by itself.

455
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:19,810
You think little bitty virus,
great big body.

456
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,720
Well don't be thinking that the law has
a virus.

457
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:24,910
Laws are viruses.
There's something alive.

458
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,880
You add them to an ecosystem.
That's what we are.

459
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:31,540
They're going to do whatever their
internal logic demands and we're going

460
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:34,990
to see how that turns out over time.
And I've seen this sort of thing

461
00:30:34,991 --> 00:30:39,991
happened before when when people walk
down this particular philosophical path,

462
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,710
and I suppose this is the point where
people accuse me of scaremongering,

463
00:30:44,711 --> 00:30:49,711
but I have watched that sort of thing.
It's like the axiomatic presuppositions

464
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:53,740
nested inside this legislation assume
that human beings have no intrinsic

465
00:30:53,741 --> 00:30:56,110
nature.
And what that means is that they can be

466
00:30:56,111 --> 00:30:58,960
remolded in any manner whatsoever by the
state.

467
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:02,200
While we've watched that happen,
I wouldn't recommend it.

468
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:07,120
And so it's for all those reasons that I
think that the proposition is false,

469
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:11,860
the law is observed to the point of
incoherent error.

470
00:31:11,861 --> 00:31:14,620
It's actually wrong.
It's not just bad law,

471
00:31:14,621 --> 00:31:17,800
it's actually wrong.
And to boot,

472
00:31:17,801 --> 00:31:22,570
it's,
it's dangerous and it's not least

473
00:31:22,571 --> 00:31:27,250
dangerous because
it actually constitutes forced speech.

474
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:31,030
And that's a difference.
That's a very different thing from just

475
00:31:31,031 --> 00:31:34,090
saying that there are things you
shouldn't say because you'll upset the

476
00:31:34,091 --> 00:31:35,290
polity,
you know?

477
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:38,670
Fair enough.
But that's not the same thing at all.

478
00:31:38,671 --> 00:31:42,940
It's saying there are things you have to
say because you have to act and speak in

479
00:31:42,941 --> 00:31:47,290
accordance with this particular
philosophical view of human beings.

480
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,713
Good enough.

481
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:55,400
[inaudible].

482
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:05,400
All right,
three points I wanted to respond to.

483
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,660
Number one,
the,

484
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,130
the,
the force question.

485
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:17,510
Number two is the matter of the infinite
number of pronouns,

486
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,490
you know,
one per person.

487
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:26,780
And the third one
is the question of whether identity is,

488
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,320
uh,
is a negotiated matter.

489
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,810
All right,
so on the,

490
00:32:33,811 --> 00:32:38,100
on the force question,
we agreed on this.

491
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:42,110
We are talking about forced speech.
No question.

492
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,680
This is not a question about what you,
you know,

493
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,040
really ought to do in polite society.
No,

494
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:53,150
we're talking about what the law says
and what the love will make you do.

495
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:56,570
And if you don't do it,
maybe not immediately,

496
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:02,560
but eventually the cops will come.
So no bones about it.

497
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:08,240
We're talking about serious stuff here.
It's not just preferences,

498
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:12,530
it's what the state requires you to do.
So the stakes are high,

499
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:13,603
no doubt about it.

500
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,053
Oh,

501
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,750
on the infinite number of pronouns
matter.

502
00:33:19,751 --> 00:33:20,720
However,
I mean you,

503
00:33:20,721 --> 00:33:25,690
you can see that that would be
problematic if in fact we took the

504
00:33:25,691 --> 00:33:30,691
proposition to its logical extension
without pulling it back a little bit.

505
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,010
Then yeah,
if everybody is allowed to pick their

506
00:33:36,011 --> 00:33:40,540
own pronoun,
then it obviously becomes unworkable

507
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:44,710
because you can't,
they can't make sense of it if you're

508
00:33:44,711 --> 00:33:47,230
the teacher.
I mean you can't keep track.

509
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,480
I can't,
I can't,

510
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,680
can't keep track of people's first
names,

511
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:54,430
much less their pronouns.
So yeah,

512
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:57,870
if you get to the stage where there are,
you know,

513
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:01,300
13 different,
some classifications for the kinds of

514
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:06,780
gender identity that you want,
then I think the law is going to say,

515
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:10,690
well actually no.
What enabled us to do is in the first

516
00:34:10,691 --> 00:34:15,691
place was reasonable limits on free
speech and now the requirements are

517
00:34:16,421 --> 00:34:20,950
unreasonable.
What we're talking about here is really

518
00:34:20,951 --> 00:34:24,010
the ability to insist upon a gender
neutral pronoun.

519
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,080
If we got so far as to say that you can
pick our own pronoun,

520
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:33,310
then I don't think the arguments that I
made before really apply like he's now

521
00:34:33,311 --> 00:34:36,480
you're into real absurdity.
Right?

522
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:39,790
So this is not a limitless thing.
It is not suggested.

523
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:43,720
Everybody has their limits.
Limitless ability to insist upon the

524
00:34:43,721 --> 00:34:48,460
language to be used by other people.
All we're saying is that there is a

525
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:53,461
logical and reasonable case to be made
that there needs to be something that is

526
00:34:53,471 --> 00:34:54,640
neutral.
Maybe one,

527
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,670
maybe a couple,
I'm not going to give a number to it,

528
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:02,500
but granted if we get to a situation
where there is an unlimited number,

529
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:05,890
then fair enough.
That seems out of hand to me.

530
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,540
Number three,
identity as a socially negotiated

531
00:35:12,541 --> 00:35:12,991
matter.
Well,

532
00:35:12,991 --> 00:35:14,670
there's some truth to this.
Yes.

533
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:20,700
In the outside world as you are
interacting with people,

534
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,420
forming relationships with people,
uh,

535
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:28,740
of whatever kind,
maybe friendship,

536
00:35:28,741 --> 00:35:30,810
maybe intimate,
maybe you're starting a family.

537
00:35:30,811 --> 00:35:33,180
I mean your,
your gender identity is important to

538
00:35:33,181 --> 00:35:38,181
those people too and so yes,
there is certainly an of social

539
00:35:38,701 --> 00:35:42,020
negotiation in your gender.
What

540
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,920
that negotiation's not taking place with
your teacher.

541
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:50,670
It's not taking place in the classroom.

542
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:56,290
The teacher doesn't have to know what
that negotiations about.

543
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,150
It doesn't have to know its outcome.

544
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,513
Okay.

545
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:06,580
As far as the teacher is concerned,
all he or she or it needs to know is

546
00:36:07,881 --> 00:36:12,881
what you want to be called in the sense
of one or the other or neither.

547
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:14,563
That's all.

548
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:20,210
Let's try this analogy.
The

549
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:24,880
the point is that gender should be
irrelevant in the classroom.

550
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:29,110
Just like race should be irrelevant in
the classroom.

551
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:34,140
So if we had a situation in the English
language were different races were being

552
00:36:35,801 --> 00:36:40,801
referred to by different pronouns,
we might find that a little bit of Horn

553
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:48,160
because it doesn't matter.
Why would you distinguish between

554
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:50,560
someone who was white and someone who
was dark?

555
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,610
Same question with gender.
Why do you need to distinguish between

556
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:58,920
someone who was he and someone who was
chic?

557
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,710
It can if you want to and it's okay with
them,

558
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:06,630
but the point is you don't need to in
order to carry on the task you're

559
00:37:06,631 --> 00:37:10,320
supposed to be performing.
So if that person doesn't want to fit

560
00:37:10,321 --> 00:37:13,290
into that binary,
well then what's the big deal?

561
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:21,270
I think I'll leave it there.
[inaudible]

562
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:35,790
well,
you know,

563
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:40,430
it's hard to argue with the
reasonableness of the vast majority of

564
00:37:40,431 --> 00:37:45,431
that statement set of statements,
but it's the,

565
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:51,220
the acceptability of the argument is
predicated on whether or not that degree

566
00:37:51,261 --> 00:37:55,880
of reasonableness is actually already
built into the law or will be.

567
00:37:55,881 --> 00:38:00,260
And my suspicions are actually that at
some point it will be,

568
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:04,940
but I can tell you that there's going to
be a lot of carnage before them because

569
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:09,530
my worthy opponent basically pointed out
as I did previously,

570
00:38:09,531 --> 00:38:14,531
that the idea that we can evolve into a
near infinite set of pronouns by the

571
00:38:15,531 --> 00:38:18,200
way,
which the Ontario Human Rights

572
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,600
Commission policies already essentially
recognize.

573
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:24,180
So they've already admitted that
although I'm certain server Julie

574
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:28,220
certain that the people who formulated
the policies really have no idea when

575
00:38:28,221 --> 00:38:30,800
they formulated that this was going to
go beyond he,

576
00:38:30,801 --> 00:38:34,280
she and they,
they had no idea that like within five

577
00:38:34,281 --> 00:38:38,920
years that'd be 71 different gender
identities and a set of pronouns

578
00:38:38,921 --> 00:38:40,000
associated with each.

579
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,290
So I think this multiple kid
multiplicative explosion that's

580
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:45,970
occurred,
caught them by surprise.

581
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:49,210
They wouldn't have formulated the
legislation that way to begin with.

582
00:38:49,211 --> 00:38:51,550
I think if they would've had the
foresight to see what happened,

583
00:38:51,551 --> 00:38:53,920
but you never know,
but all right,

584
00:38:53,921 --> 00:38:56,020
so,
but back to the idea of these reasonable

585
00:38:56,021 --> 00:38:57,310
limits.
Well,

586
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:01,330
I think that as these matters are forced
through the courts,

587
00:39:01,331 --> 00:39:05,650
up to the Canadian Supreme Court,
that these sorts of limits will in fact

588
00:39:05,651 --> 00:39:07,540
be imposed that we'll find that it
isn't,

589
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:11,440
people don't have the legal right to be
addressed by whatever pronouns they

590
00:39:11,441 --> 00:39:15,760
choose because we run into precisely the
problems that we've been discussing.

591
00:39:15,761 --> 00:39:19,690
But the problem is is that as the
legislation is currently constituted,

592
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,430
which is more or less what we're
discussing,

593
00:39:21,431 --> 00:39:26,431
we'll perhaps it should be constituted
in a manner that would sustain a supreme

594
00:39:26,981 --> 00:39:29,020
court challenge.
If we're going to talk about should,

595
00:39:29,021 --> 00:39:30,940
and I don't think there's a hope in hell
of it,

596
00:39:30,941 --> 00:39:34,870
the way it's constituted right now would
withstand a supreme court challenge.

597
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:38,800
It'll depend on how they select the
Supreme Court justices and we'll see how

598
00:39:38,801 --> 00:39:40,960
that turns out in the future.
Because already,

599
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,470
I don't know if you know this,
but the law has been put in place so

600
00:39:44,471 --> 00:39:48,280
that the people who select our judges
are going to have to undergo mandatory

601
00:39:48,281 --> 00:39:51,430
unconscious bias retraining before
they're allowed to sit on the

602
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:54,130
committees.
And so while you can think about that,

603
00:39:54,131 --> 00:39:57,070
and if you want to,
I recommend looking into the validity of

604
00:39:57,071 --> 00:39:59,800
the tests that are used to diagnose,
so to speak,

605
00:39:59,801 --> 00:40:02,020
unconscious bias,
because they don't even,

606
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,680
they don't even come close to meeting
the necessary requirements for a

607
00:40:05,681 --> 00:40:09,100
clinical diagnostic instrument.
And there's absolutely no evidence

608
00:40:09,101 --> 00:40:13,600
whatsoever that unconscious bias
retraining produces the intended results

609
00:40:13,601 --> 00:40:16,090
and a fair bit that it actually produces
the opposite.

610
00:40:16,091 --> 00:40:19,780
So we could easily be in a position
where the supreme court itself becomes

611
00:40:19,781 --> 00:40:23,470
pathologized by this process to the
point where they won't invalidate the

612
00:40:23,471 --> 00:40:23,740
law.

613
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:27,580
But under the current circumstances,
I would say it is inevitable that they

614
00:40:27,581 --> 00:40:29,650
would,
but people are going to pay a fish's

615
00:40:29,651 --> 00:40:31,450
price for that.
It's no,

616
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:35,800
it's no simple matter to fight a vicious
piece of vicious ill written

617
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:40,600
pathological piece of legislation all
the way up through the court system to

618
00:40:40,601 --> 00:40:44,920
the Supreme Court and the number of
people who have the emotional

619
00:40:44,921 --> 00:40:48,700
wherewithal to manage that.
The strategic resources,

620
00:40:48,701 --> 00:40:52,560
the intelligence,
the team and the finances are there.

621
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:55,390
They're just nonexistent.
There might be like two people like that

622
00:40:55,391 --> 00:40:56,770
in Canada,
you know,

623
00:40:56,771 --> 00:40:59,230
I mean as her Levant did something like
that with the Alberta,

624
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,030
the Alberta human rights tribunals into,
you know,

625
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:05,200
just about did him in financially he's a
tough guy.

626
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:07,360
I'm pretty emotionally stable but it's
no joke.

627
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,160
So you know,
my proposition is that the law is kermit

628
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:13,480
currently formulated,
is observed,

629
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:16,390
it's a dirt multidimensionally it's bad
law.

630
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:21,730
And my opponents stated,
well essentially it will have to be made

631
00:41:21,731 --> 00:41:23,080
reasonable.
It's like yeah,

632
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:24,130
okay,
no problem.

633
00:41:24,131 --> 00:41:26,350
If it's made reasonable then it's made
reasonable.

634
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:29,030
But that isn't what we have now.
You might think of I,

635
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:32,650
I idea of ms cause that's actually not a
bad comparison,

636
00:41:32,651 --> 00:41:34,610
you know.
But I'd like to point out that there

637
00:41:34,611 --> 00:41:37,910
were never any legal penalties for not
using miss ever.

638
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:40,250
And language just doesn't change that
way.

639
00:41:40,251 --> 00:41:43,400
It never changes by legislative fee up.
That isn't how it works.

640
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:45,140
It changes,
especially in English,

641
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:48,410
it's bottom up process because the word
is a tool actually.

642
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:53,390
It's not a description for a thing.
And what happens is that if you invent a

643
00:41:53,391 --> 00:41:55,220
good tool,
any of you can do that.

644
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:59,120
If you invent a word that fix and and on
all the linguistic monkeys,

645
00:41:59,121 --> 00:42:03,170
I was there waiting for that tool,
they'll pick it up just like that.

646
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:06,530
And the truth of the matter is is that
no one's come up with that particular

647
00:42:06,531 --> 00:42:09,530
linguistic pro tool to solve this
particular problem.

648
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:12,650
And that's an indication that there
actually isn't a solution to it yet.

649
00:42:12,651 --> 00:42:15,530
And that's partly because it's an
exceptionally complicated problem.

650
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:20,180
And so the idea that that should be
solved in some sense by ill conceived,

651
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:23,900
ill written,
philosophically untenable legislation

652
00:42:23,901 --> 00:42:26,750
that has a,
I would say pathological impunitive

653
00:42:26,751 --> 00:42:30,590
philosophy at its face is it's not a
tenable proposition.

654
00:42:30,591 --> 00:42:33,050
And it's certainly not the law as it
currently stands.

655
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:38,030
So I guess that stopped for my,
my rebuttal.

656
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:39,163
Thank you.

657
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:45,693
Okay.

658
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,050
Okay.
We'll start taking questions.

659
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:51,930
Sure.
Okay.

660
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:59,370
I have a question for a doctor.
Keiter said that I think doctor,

661
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:04,060
any sort of already great and I was just
wondering it to speak to it a bit more

662
00:43:04,061 --> 00:43:08,770
directly when we're talking about
whether you can or someone to refer you

663
00:43:08,771 --> 00:43:11,380
or refrain from referring to you in
different ways.

664
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:14,070
I guess one issue that I'm having
difficulty,

665
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:19,180
one of up thrown down is I think we all
acknowledge that you have a right to

666
00:43:19,181 --> 00:43:21,400
force people to refer to you in certain
ways.

667
00:43:21,401 --> 00:43:26,401
If a professor was at a class and they
had a student who insisted on calling

668
00:43:26,921 --> 00:43:29,260
them a girl,
then they were male or you know,

669
00:43:29,261 --> 00:43:32,500
calling them clear or something,
or I can think of way worse words,

670
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:33,790
it would say,
well that's,

671
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,540
that's not a pronoun and that's a
derogatory label.

672
00:43:37,541 --> 00:43:40,480
That's just meant to degrade me.
Um,

673
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:44,650
but if you know who's to say what is a
pronoun and I'm not sure that it

674
00:43:44,651 --> 00:43:46,330
necessarily would change.

675
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,740
Um,
if 95 or 97 friends all insisted on sort

676
00:43:50,741 --> 00:43:51,800
of,
um,

677
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:54,820
degrading or you know,
using that pejorative label,

678
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:56,110
uh,
to the person.

679
00:43:56,111 --> 00:44:00,250
And I think that people who are
transgendered or whatever do experience

680
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,860
when people use the wrong gender labels,
do they,

681
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,380
they've experienced real predators.
They experienced that as kind of

682
00:44:05,381 --> 00:44:09,370
oppressive in that way.
So I don't know if identity is a subject

683
00:44:09,371 --> 00:44:10,650
or an object,
but,

684
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:13,060
um,
but I do know that we placed important

685
00:44:13,061 --> 00:44:15,190
demands on one another.
I don't,

686
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,800
I don't know that nature,
but I know that fundamentally like our

687
00:44:17,801 --> 00:44:20,950
society is going to work better if we
respect each other.

688
00:44:20,951 --> 00:44:24,610
And I think history bears bears that out
and that,

689
00:44:24,611 --> 00:44:29,220
that self respect and allowing people
self identification to play a role in

690
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:31,120
that,
that public aspect.

691
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:32,603
Um,

692
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:36,210
we do already have limits on how people
can refer to each other and they're

693
00:44:36,211 --> 00:44:39,300
informed by how people want themselves
to be referred to.

694
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:41,251
Okay.
Okay.

695
00:44:41,251 --> 00:44:45,540
Well that's a of questions.
So I'm not trying to be a smart Alec

696
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,580
both.
It's just not going to have to sort that

697
00:44:47,581 --> 00:44:48,970
out for a minute.
He could up.

698
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:50,610
The first thing I would say is,
you know,

699
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:53,010
pro pronouns,
and I'm not a linguist to,

700
00:44:53,011 --> 00:44:55,350
I'm not going to be able to whip this
off the top of my head,

701
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:57,240
although I do know that,
um,

702
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,720
there is a psychologist named James
Pennebaker who's written a whole book on

703
00:45:00,721 --> 00:45:02,640
pronouns,
which she might be interested in

704
00:45:02,641 --> 00:45:04,560
referring to.
And pronouns turned out to be

705
00:45:04,561 --> 00:45:08,130
extraordinarily important as signifiers,
but they're also part of what's called a

706
00:45:08,131 --> 00:45:11,010
closed linguistic category and they
don't change.

707
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,140
And so that's something that's useful to
know,

708
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,850
but you also bring up the distinction or
the lack of distinction or made a lack

709
00:45:17,851 --> 00:45:20,490
of distinction between adjectives and
pronouns.

710
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:24,720
And that's pretty interesting because
there's no real reason why if you can't

711
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:27,410
insist upon which Pronoun I used to
address you,

712
00:45:27,411 --> 00:45:30,960
you can also assist on which adjective I
use to address you.

713
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:35,150
And there's a lot more adjectives and,
and so that's cause I don't see like,

714
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,670
if you can choose your Damn Pronoun,
why can't you choose your adjective?

715
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,950
You know,
I mean adjectives are you the list of

716
00:45:40,951 --> 00:45:43,670
words you listed as pejorative.
We're actually not pronouns.

717
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:45,690
They were adjectives.
And so you can,

718
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:49,860
you can object to them.
And there's no shortage of times when

719
00:45:49,861 --> 00:45:52,170
you use a pejorative adjective to
describe someone,

720
00:45:52,171 --> 00:45:54,360
especially if you believe that they've
misbehaved.

721
00:45:54,361 --> 00:45:57,270
It's like if the person can insist upon
their pronoun,

722
00:45:57,271 --> 00:45:59,130
why can't they insist upon your
adjective?

723
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:03,090
And that's another part of this problem
with this multiplicative complexity that

724
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:05,520
it isn't addressed properly within the
law.

725
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:07,800
With regards to respect,
you know,

726
00:46:07,801 --> 00:46:08,634
you said,
well,

727
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,780
human civilization progress is a lot
better if we respect one another.

728
00:46:12,781 --> 00:46:14,700
And I actually don't believe that at
all.

729
00:46:14,701 --> 00:46:18,810
I believe that human civilization,
pr progress's and maintains itself.

730
00:46:18,811 --> 00:46:21,110
When we respect people who've earned
respect,

731
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:23,430
you don't just respect everybody
randomly.

732
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,290
Well,
what the hell uses respect?

733
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:29,370
If you just respect people randomly,
it's like inflating the currency.

734
00:46:29,371 --> 00:46:32,220
You know,
it's like the simpsons episode where you

735
00:46:32,221 --> 00:46:34,230
know,
Bart gets a trophy because it's every

736
00:46:34,231 --> 00:46:37,860
child gets a trophy day.
All you do is inflate the currency.

737
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:42,270
Respect is actually limited to that
category of people who've earned respect

738
00:46:42,271 --> 00:46:44,610
in some manners.
So whatever you're talking about with

739
00:46:44,611 --> 00:46:47,490
regards to say common decency between
people,

740
00:46:47,491 --> 00:46:50,610
it's not respect and did definitions
actually matter.

741
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:54,450
They matter a law.
And so I hear the respect argument all

742
00:46:54,451 --> 00:46:57,150
the time,
but you also can't force me to respect

743
00:46:57,350 --> 00:46:57,920
you.

744
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,750
I mean you might be able to force me to
act like I respect you,

745
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,260
but you can't force me to respect you.
It's just not possible.

746
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:07,770
And you could break me I suppose in and
then perhaps I would do it,

747
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,650
although I can't see exactly how we
precisely.

748
00:47:10,651 --> 00:47:12,720
But um,
so,

749
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:15,230
so there's a number of,
I mean I,

750
00:47:15,231 --> 00:47:18,240
I get your point and I'm not trying to
denigrate it in any sense.

751
00:47:18,241 --> 00:47:21,930
There's a complex issue here,
which is to what degree do you allow

752
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:25,860
individuals to,
to govern the conversation that's had

753
00:47:25,861 --> 00:47:27,900
about them in their presence or
otherwise.

754
00:47:27,901 --> 00:47:30,520
But I would just back to my original
argument,

755
00:47:30,521 --> 00:47:33,580
which is that's a negotiation.
It's either in negotiation,

756
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:36,310
you got three states can negotiate with
someone,

757
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:41,410
you can be their slave or you can be,
they're tired and I would pick

758
00:47:41,411 --> 00:47:43,240
negotiation.
But as far as I'm concerned,

759
00:47:43,241 --> 00:47:45,520
the law right now as it's currently
instantiated,

760
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:49,300
is a tyrant and it makes people into its
slave and we're going to pay for that.

761
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:53,200
And it's paid predicated on
hypothetically on respect and

762
00:47:53,201 --> 00:47:55,120
compassionate.
I don't buy that for a second.

763
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:58,750
I don't think that's true in the least.
And there's a huge literature on

764
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:01,450
compassion.
Here's a problem with compassion.

765
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:06,990
Mother grizzly bears are very,
very compassionate towards their cubs.

766
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,020
But if you get near those cubs,
they'll tear you to pieces.

767
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:14,410
And that's the flip side of compassion.
And I'm speaking not as a lawyer here,

768
00:48:14,411 --> 00:48:17,050
but as a psychologist that's already
well documented.

769
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:22,470
Compassion is by no means an emotion
that produces the desired social

770
00:48:22,991 --> 00:48:24,580
outcome.
Quite the contrary.

771
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,720
Quite the contrary.
Life is very much more complicated than

772
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:29,591
then.
Well,

773
00:48:29,591 --> 00:48:31,990
if you were just empathic,
everything would work out.

774
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:36,100
It's like you can't meet William Pathic
to everyone and that's a big problem.

775
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,450
So,
so I've answered some of your questions,

776
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:41,111
you know,
we'll address it,

777
00:48:41,111 --> 00:48:43,630
some of them,
but that's about the best I can do it at

778
00:48:43,631 --> 00:48:44,464
the moment.

779
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:52,850
Your take on,
it seems like every time on every step

780
00:48:52,851 --> 00:48:56,020
of the quality rates,
this slippery slope argument comes up

781
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:01,860
and the courts and society solve that
issue that you think that those are air

782
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:08,710
path.
It's a tough one because you know,

783
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:11,260
I think it was yoga.
You'll be there if he said something

784
00:49:11,261 --> 00:49:14,440
about things are hard to predict,
especially the future.

785
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:18,520
Just kind of Nice line actually.
But that's the problem with slippery

786
00:49:18,521 --> 00:49:19,690
slope arguments,
you know?

787
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:23,380
But I don't think I'm making a slippery
slope argument because I think I'm

788
00:49:23,381 --> 00:49:25,840
objecting to the law as it's currently
instantiated,

789
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,120
not as how it will be.
It's all,

790
00:49:28,121 --> 00:49:32,860
we have already written his social
constructionist philosophy into the law

791
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:36,400
that's already there.
Now what the consequences of that will

792
00:49:36,401 --> 00:49:37,270
be.
I can't tell,

793
00:49:37,271 --> 00:49:40,930
but one of the problems is it's wrong.
It's factually wrong.

794
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,250
It's,
it's statistic.

795
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:44,470
Sorry.
Actually it's statistically wrong.

796
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:48,460
That's the problem because the
insistence is that those factors that I

797
00:49:48,461 --> 00:49:50,580
described independently very,
which is a,

798
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:53,620
it's a predicative social
constructionist and postmodern is

799
00:49:53,621 --> 00:49:55,090
thinking,
but it's incorrect.

800
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:59,410
There's no evidence whatsoever for it
unless you gerrymander the notion of

801
00:49:59,411 --> 00:50:01,270
independence.
And you know,

802
00:50:01,271 --> 00:50:03,190
once you start doing that,
that's a big problem.

803
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,920
So,
so I s you know,

804
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:09,460
so I stand by my initial documentation
of the errors in the law.

805
00:50:09,461 --> 00:50:14,461
And I do think by the way that,
assuming the things continue on their

806
00:50:15,731 --> 00:50:19,720
current jurisprudential course,
which is debatable,

807
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:22,300
you know,
the Ontario Human Rights Commission and

808
00:50:22,301 --> 00:50:25,430
it's in the powers that it's abrogated.
It's being given by the,

809
00:50:25,431 --> 00:50:26,050
by,
uh,

810
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:28,070
by the legislative.
It

811
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,100
has the right to suspend normal tier of
jurors,

812
00:50:30,101 --> 00:50:34,650
prudential procedure and also precedent.
So you might want to look that up cause

813
00:50:34,651 --> 00:50:39,651
that's a real fun thing to read.
So if society continues on its current

814
00:50:40,131 --> 00:50:43,440
course and the courts operate under
their current presuppositions,

815
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:48,230
then this law will be subject to the
limits that you described and so could

816
00:50:48,231 --> 00:50:49,220
be,
but like I said,

817
00:50:49,221 --> 00:50:50,690
there's going to be carnage along the
way

818
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:55,130
are there.
So I just want to bring you a little bit

819
00:50:55,131 --> 00:50:59,120
of facts into this cause I know you're
talking to those get carried away,

820
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:03,830
but box unfortunately along both sides.
So I don't have it.

821
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,500
Mr. Peterson suggested,
uh,

822
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:07,150
the,
the,

823
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:09,340
the key distinction here,
and this is,

824
00:51:09,390 --> 00:51:11,880
this is me talking now,
not that the advocate,

825
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:17,540
the key distinction is that this
legislation doesn't prevent you from

826
00:51:17,851 --> 00:51:21,960
doing something.
It requires you to do something that is

827
00:51:21,961 --> 00:51:26,010
now outrageous proposition.
Outrageous

828
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:32,890
it speaks is bad enough because it is a
significant step away from California

829
00:51:34,051 --> 00:51:34,681
crime.
Now,

830
00:51:34,681 --> 00:51:37,920
there are some restrictions on free
speech and Mike and which are

831
00:51:37,921 --> 00:51:42,780
appropriate counseling a crime,
just watching defamation might be,

832
00:51:42,781 --> 00:51:46,380
although that has some problems,
but Kelsey and crime is the best

833
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:49,710
situation where you shouldn't be allowed
to say that,

834
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:53,820
but,
but hate speech is an expression of an

835
00:51:53,821 --> 00:51:57,480
opinion about nobody in particular
about,

836
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:59,690
it's about a group.
Now,

837
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:04,710
if you have an individual who believes
those things about a group,

838
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,270
you know,
lots of people including me,

839
00:52:08,271 --> 00:52:12,960
would say that's unfortunate.
But if you're living in a free society,

840
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:17,220
you're supposed to be allowed to say
what you think,

841
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,940
even if other people don't like it.

842
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:26,060
And RFN is the essence of free speech is
to be able to offense,

843
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:32,100
not to Burns back offense or were you
well,

844
00:52:32,101 --> 00:52:34,590
I'm going to answer that more or less as
a psychologist.

845
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:40,840
So what are the tenants of clinical
therapy including psychiatry and it's

846
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:47,840
say nonmedical forms is that
dialogue is curative.

847
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:49,750
That's actually the fundamental
proposition.

848
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:51,253
Um,
uh,

849
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,450
the thing about having someone in
therapy is,

850
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,120
you know,
and they're often like everyone bent

851
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,090
over shape quite badly.
Sometimes homicidal,

852
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:06,300
sometimes homicidal is good enough and
her 10 and vengeful and you know,

853
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:11,230
and for good reason often,
no,

854
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:12,130
no,
no joe,

855
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,990
good reason.
If you were in their shoes,

856
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:16,150
you'd feel the same way in all
probability.

857
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:22,060
You have to let those people talk.
You have to let them talk.

858
00:53:22,061 --> 00:53:25,120
They don't even know what they think
until they talk.

859
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:25,951
You know,
you think,

860
00:53:25,951 --> 00:53:26,040
you

861
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,390
think and then you talk.
It's like,

862
00:53:27,391 --> 00:53:28,224
no,
you don't.

863
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:30,210
You know,
most people can't think at all.

864
00:53:30,211 --> 00:53:32,040
And I don't mean that in a pejorative
sense.

865
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:34,060
It's very,
very difficult to learn to think because

866
00:53:34,061 --> 00:53:38,400
to think you have to hold an argument
between two opposing positions in your

867
00:53:38,401 --> 00:53:41,820
own head.
Do you have to delineate both positions?

868
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,620
And you have to make like,
no,

869
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:47,070
not a straw man out of either.
You want to make and Sam Harris

870
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:51,060
Tournament an iron man or both and then
you have to do that alone.

871
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:52,051
It's like,
yeah,

872
00:53:52,051 --> 00:53:53,940
maybe you can do that if you're
Dostoyevsky,

873
00:53:53,941 --> 00:53:57,420
but because he's the only person I've
seen who's really managed that

874
00:53:57,421 --> 00:54:00,810
consistently,
but to expect anything other than an

875
00:54:00,811 --> 00:54:05,811
unbelievably well trained mind to even
even step into that territory is naive

876
00:54:06,571 --> 00:54:09,390
beyond belief.
Almost everyone thinks by talking,

877
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:12,420
they don't even know what they think
until they speak.

878
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:16,020
And so often if you let people speak,
they'll think they'll speak and they'll

879
00:54:16,021 --> 00:54:17,130
say,
you know,

880
00:54:17,131 --> 00:54:19,890
and then they become aware of some
internal contradictions or maybe they

881
00:54:19,891 --> 00:54:21,920
shock themselves.
That happens a lot.

882
00:54:21,921 --> 00:54:22,291
It's like,
Whoa,

883
00:54:22,291 --> 00:54:25,860
I can't believe I said that.
And they hear what they have to say.

884
00:54:25,861 --> 00:54:28,290
It's being revealed themselves to
themselves.

885
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:29,610
Geez,
that just enough,

886
00:54:29,611 --> 00:54:31,560
right?
There is often enough to change them.

887
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:33,740
But,
but even if it isn't,

888
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:36,390
let's say they're particularly
intransigent and we're not debating

889
00:54:36,391 --> 00:54:38,850
about whether hate speech exists because
bloody well,

890
00:54:38,851 --> 00:54:41,430
right?
It exists and it can be unbelievably

891
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,820
pathological and I think I'm actually
quite familiar with that sort of thing,

892
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:50,450
but you want that out in the air so that
people can hear it.

893
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:53,520
You want to drive the people who hate
underground.

894
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:56,280
We know what happens psychologically
when you do that,

895
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:57,960
it's a very bad idea.

896
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:02,960
Anything you drive underground thrives.
It thrives and it partly thrives because

897
00:55:03,061 --> 00:55:06,450
it isn't even allowed to express itself
and then it festers and turned into,

898
00:55:06,451 --> 00:55:10,740
it turns into hatred that far exceeds
the original and the idea that you make

899
00:55:10,741 --> 00:55:14,370
society safe by not letting horrible
people say terrible things.

900
00:55:14,371 --> 00:55:16,650
It's like it's,
it's not a good crop position.

901
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:20,310
You want those people out in the open
where they can say what they have to say

902
00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:22,420
first of all so they can see what
they're like,

903
00:55:22,421 --> 00:55:25,980
second of all,
so that they can see how people respond

904
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:29,430
because you don't even know what you
should think in some sense until you

905
00:55:29,431 --> 00:55:32,070
watch how people respond.
You know at some,

906
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,660
well I won't go on and on about that,
but it's,

907
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:36,250
it's,
and then the question,

908
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:38,760
if there's other questions,
who defines ate cheese?

909
00:55:38,761 --> 00:55:41,310
That's a deadly one.
It's like it's great if you're on the

910
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:45,350
left and the left is in power because
the left defined statement there are

911
00:55:45,351 --> 00:55:46,860
going to be in power forever,
man.

912
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:50,190
And as soon as the people who were on
the opposite side come into power,

913
00:55:50,191 --> 00:55:54,330
they're gonna use whatever arguments you
had and their own and whatever you think

914
00:55:54,331 --> 00:55:57,000
is going to be hate speech like right
now.

915
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,910
So you should always,
and this is what the founders of the

916
00:55:59,911 --> 00:56:01,470
American constitution get,
you know,

917
00:56:01,471 --> 00:56:02,460
they always thought,
okay,

918
00:56:02,461 --> 00:56:06,660
how could a absolute mlevel malevolent
full screw this up?

919
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:09,810
They never thought,
well how can we establish the Utopia?

920
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,380
So that's what you're always thinking
when you're putting a limit on something

921
00:56:13,381 --> 00:56:15,120
including someone else's speech.
It's like,

922
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:18,000
okay,
how could the most malevolent fool

923
00:56:18,001 --> 00:56:22,320
imaginable screw this up the worst
possible way and then presume that will

924
00:56:22,321 --> 00:56:26,980
happen and then take steps so that that
isn't how it turns out.

925
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:32,550
So you are let the people who have,
who have horrifying viewpoints express

926
00:56:33,291 --> 00:56:33,761
them,
you know,

927
00:56:33,761 --> 00:56:37,840
subject to these limitations because you
want to make them into martyrs.

928
00:56:37,841 --> 00:56:40,930
That's what happened with Gif.
I can't say it properly cared wheel

929
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:42,790
dues.
He's right.

930
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,930
Yeah.
The Dutch ship who's leading the polls

931
00:56:46,931 --> 00:56:48,790
by the way,
and who has a pretty decent chance of

932
00:56:48,791 --> 00:56:51,220
winning the election.
They nailed him for hate speech and his

933
00:56:51,221 --> 00:56:53,890
popularity went up like 4%.
It's like,

934
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,980
it doesn't seem like very smart move to
me,

935
00:56:57,070 --> 00:57:00,460
but I'm sure he's not too unhappy about
it,

936
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:03,280
you know?
And it might be that the fate of the

937
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:05,260
rest on his shoulders,
maybe not.

938
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:06,670
Maybe it's marine Le Pen

939
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:10,570
in the center.
Then you both mentioned the difference

940
00:57:10,571 --> 00:57:13,240
between different degrees,
uh,

941
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:15,790
laws that are telling you not to say
something,

942
00:57:15,850 --> 00:57:20,850
which is a lot of people.
I wonder if you could talk more about

943
00:57:21,101 --> 00:57:26,101
that or why you think one is more
extreme in the other way.

944
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,100
Both seem to be imposing some
dishonesty.

945
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:37,150
Well,
I don't think that laws that restrict

946
00:57:37,151 --> 00:57:41,740
your speech in the ways that we've been
describing are any good either.

947
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:43,690
I think they're both,
um,

948
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:45,940
tyrannical.
Uh,

949
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:50,470
but the,
the requiring you to use a word that is

950
00:57:50,471 --> 00:57:52,380
not actually in the dictionary yet.
I mean,

951
00:57:52,381 --> 00:57:53,980
I said,
I suggested that language was

952
00:57:53,981 --> 00:57:57,940
evolutionary and it is,
language does change and it may well be

953
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:02,140
that we get this kind of a pronoun
sooner or later.

954
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:06,510
I'm not objecting to that at all.
I think that kind of a problem from that

955
00:58:06,511 --> 00:58:08,740
would be kind of cool.
Probably very appropriate.

956
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:12,880
And civilized society.
It's not the word I'm talking about when

957
00:58:12,881 --> 00:58:16,000
I,
when I'm criticizing it.

958
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:20,350
It's the idea that we should be changing
language by statute.

959
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:26,530
That is the problem.
That means that language is now

960
00:58:26,531 --> 00:58:29,860
considered to be in the purview of the
state.

961
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:33,850
No,
not,

962
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:36,430
not a free country.
Um,

963
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:37,430
so,
um,

964
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:39,020
that's what I'm asking,
answering your question,

965
00:58:39,021 --> 00:58:40,910
but I just think,
I mean they're both bad.

966
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:43,970
Just one's more extreme than the other
one is.

967
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:45,593
So.
So let,

968
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:48,980
let me tell you about an experiment.
So you know,

969
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:50,660
people think,
they think,

970
00:58:50,661 --> 00:58:53,750
which we've already gone through and
they do that only to a limited degree

971
00:58:53,751 --> 00:58:56,330
because thinking is hard.
And most of you do that by talking.

972
00:58:56,990 --> 00:58:59,600
Um,
but people also think they know what

973
00:58:59,601 --> 00:59:02,510
they're talking about when they say
something in general and if they don't,

974
00:59:02,511 --> 00:59:07,511
and I'm not being cruel about this,
like imagine I asked one of you to come

975
00:59:07,791 --> 00:59:10,250
up and draw a helicopter on the board.
It's like,

976
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:11,400
you know,
you're going to draw it like a

977
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:13,610
helicopter,
a five year old draws.

978
00:59:13,611 --> 00:59:17,150
It's going to be like a box with a
beanie on top of it that the stick out

979
00:59:17,151 --> 00:59:18,920
the aspect helicopters like no,

980
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:21,260
that's going to help you.

981
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:24,660
Like you don't,
what you don't know about helicopters

982
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:30,020
would still many volumes.
You're knowledge is sufficient to

983
00:59:30,021 --> 00:59:35,021
communicate kind of an abstracted
representation and a lot of your thought

984
00:59:35,711 --> 00:59:39,170
is actually like that.
You don't know as much as you think you

985
00:59:39,171 --> 00:59:40,004
know.
And so,

986
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:43,190
and that means you're more vulnerable in
many ways than you think.

987
00:59:43,191 --> 00:59:45,890
And so here's an example.
Let's say I bring you into the lab and I

988
00:59:45,891 --> 00:59:48,830
get you to fill out a political
attitudes questionnaire and I localize

989
00:59:48,831 --> 00:59:51,500
you say pathway beacon center and
radical,

990
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:54,620
something like that.
Maybe an NDP territory or something like

991
00:59:54,621 --> 00:59:57,860
that.
And then I ask you to write a 500 word

992
00:59:57,861 --> 01:00:01,340
essay about why corporations are a
blessing.

993
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,920
Okay,
now so you don't agree with it.

994
01:00:03,921 --> 01:00:04,341
Yeah,
yeah.

995
01:00:04,341 --> 01:00:06,830
I know you don't agree with it,
but like try to write a decent essay.

996
01:00:06,831 --> 01:00:09,440
If you'd run a good one,
I'll give you like an extra 10 bucks or

997
01:00:09,441 --> 01:00:10,310
something,
whatever,

998
01:00:10,311 --> 01:00:11,540
50 bucks,
whatever,

999
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:12,140
whatever.

1000
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:16,610
So you write out this essay and it's
contrary view point and I'll bring you

1001
01:00:16,611 --> 01:00:19,640
back the next week and I give you the
same political attitudes questionnaire.

1002
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:24,140
What do you think happens?
You've moved substantially towards the

1003
01:00:24,141 --> 01:00:27,110
right.
And so if I regulate what you have to

1004
01:00:27,111 --> 01:00:29,600
save,
I regulate what you think.

1005
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:32,210
And you might think no,
but you're wrong.

1006
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:35,360
Because what you think,
what you say,

1007
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:38,090
especially if you do it eventually
determines what you think.

1008
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:42,050
And,
and I am not willing to cede that to the

1009
01:00:42,051 --> 01:00:43,100
state,
but also,

1010
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:46,820
but not only because I object,
especially to this particular

1011
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:51,110
philosophical in banding of this
particular statute to say,

1012
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:56,440
but also because you see your stupid
opinion is the corrective for the

1013
01:00:56,511 --> 01:00:58,640
states.
Stupid opinions,

1014
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:02,780
like we've all just swamped in ignorance
and stupidity.

1015
01:01:02,781 --> 01:01:06,020
It's just,
it's a human condition and states are

1016
01:01:06,021 --> 01:01:09,530
horrible.
Tyrannosaur tyrannical messes and

1017
01:01:09,531 --> 01:01:12,200
individuals are like corrupt and blind.

1018
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:14,540
And so it's amazing.
We can stumble around in the world at

1019
01:01:14,541 --> 01:01:17,060
all.
But what you hope is that now and then

1020
01:01:17,061 --> 01:01:22,061
some Dingbat Otter is something vaguely
sensible that helps curb the tyranny of

1021
01:01:22,161 --> 01:01:24,710
the state.
And you're going to have to let a lot of

1022
01:01:24,711 --> 01:01:29,090
stupidity be aired before any pearls of
wisdom emerge to the surface.

1023
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:33,710
So you have to let people stumble around
like prejudice morons because that's

1024
01:01:33,711 --> 01:01:36,440
what they are.
But hopefully as they stumble and

1025
01:01:36,441 --> 01:01:39,680
listen,
they can become a little less appalling.

1026
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:42,350
And so can this state,
and that's,

1027
01:01:42,351 --> 01:01:43,410
no,
you told me envision.

1028
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:45,430
I can tell you that's for sure,
but,

1029
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:50,360
but I've never seen a utopian state and
I'm certainly never seen a perfect

1030
01:01:50,361 --> 01:01:52,910
person.
So it seems pretty perfectly reasonable

1031
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:55,130
to me to three of them be exactly that
matter.

1032
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,690
Don't let people inside your head.
It isn't a lot of obvious that they know

1033
01:01:59,691 --> 01:02:00,524
what they're doing.

1034
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:02,760
So,
yeah.

1035
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,070
Yeah.
Um,

1036
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,040
so I,
I had a thought while you both were

1037
01:02:07,041 --> 01:02:07,874
talking.
Um,

1038
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:13,930
and it seems like the sort of genesis of
this debate comes from people who they

1039
01:02:14,661 --> 01:02:18,310
feel as though the current words don't
describe them accurately.

1040
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:21,330
No,
there are men who feel like women and

1041
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,550
vice versa.
Then there's people who don't feel like

1042
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:27,570
either applied.
And I think you're Mr. Peterson.

1043
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:31,860
I think you're right to point out that
there's a kind of weird flip that occurs

1044
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:34,800
where it's no longer that the language
doesn't describe them.

1045
01:02:34,801 --> 01:02:39,801
It's that the language has to sort of
point out their exact identity and

1046
01:02:39,961 --> 01:02:43,680
uniqueness.
And I think maybe a way to sort of

1047
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:48,540
reframe the idea is not to have a
language that has to cater to every

1048
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:52,980
single person,
but sort of a singular term that can,

1049
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:57,720
didn't know whether or not someone wants
to partake in the current structure of

1050
01:02:57,721 --> 01:02:58,350
language.

1051
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:01,890
So he or she,
and then if you had a third term that

1052
01:03:01,891 --> 01:03:06,330
didn't have to have any connotations of
gender but rather stood for the

1053
01:03:06,331 --> 01:03:09,570
proposition that they know they don't
associate with you or sheet.

1054
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:14,550
And that way you can leave it sort of
facially neutral to any particular

1055
01:03:14,551 --> 01:03:15,760
person.
Well,

1056
01:03:15,761 --> 01:03:18,340
maybe not.
Maybe reasonable legislation would mean

1057
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:19,750
set up in that manner,
you know?

1058
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:22,960
But I would say let's democratize the
problem.

1059
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:27,520
As soon as someone comes up with a
solution that people find usable,

1060
01:03:27,521 --> 01:03:29,110
it's like,
it's like ms,

1061
01:03:29,111 --> 01:03:30,960
it's like I use ms,
you know?

1062
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:34,090
I think it's kind of,
that's useful.

1063
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,580
You know,
I'm actually more comfortable using it,

1064
01:03:36,581 --> 01:03:37,390
I would say.
And I,

1065
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:40,750
you know,
I kinda gone point people didn't want to

1066
01:03:40,751 --> 01:03:44,680
have their marital status advertise
publicly didn't seem necessary.

1067
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:47,650
Well,
women aren't the same as they were a

1068
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:48,090
hundred years ago.
Right.

1069
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:51,880
And they're not even close to the same
pill was a biological revolution.

1070
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:54,730
Everything's flipped upside down.
So we needed a new word.

1071
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:57,430
Okay.
We came up with one wasn't,

1072
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:02,520
it wasn't implemented by force,
was implemented by public opinion and

1073
01:04:03,311 --> 01:04:05,320
that's,
that's how it English in particular,

1074
01:04:05,321 --> 01:04:07,630
like the French French is a bit
different because they actually have

1075
01:04:07,631 --> 01:04:10,300
committees to decide what constitutes an
acceptable word,

1076
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,700
especially in France,
but also in Quebec.

1077
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,400
But in English it's like,
it's the Commons man.

1078
01:04:15,430 --> 01:04:17,380
Throw a word out there.
If you,

1079
01:04:17,381 --> 01:04:19,120
if you've,
if you've nailed the problem,

1080
01:04:19,570 --> 01:04:21,910
people will pick that up so fast.
You can't even believe it.

1081
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,610
They will just spread virally.
Well,

1082
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:26,590
we don't have that solution.
And why is that?

1083
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:28,030
Well,
because we don't know how to solve this

1084
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:30,940
problem.
And so the law legislators come along

1085
01:04:30,941 --> 01:04:31,421
and say,
well you,

1086
01:04:31,421 --> 01:04:34,540
so by asking each person to tell you
what to say,

1087
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:35,260
it's like,
no,

1088
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:40,260
sorry,
wrong plus dangerous plus motivated and

1089
01:04:40,571 --> 01:04:41,620
a variety of other things.

1090
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:45,430
So,
so sure fine could work,

1091
01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:48,260
you know,
but I can't decide if that work because

1092
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:53,340
there's a strange idea now for some
reason that in some sense the world is

1093
01:04:55,510 --> 01:05:00,470
obligated to validate your identity and
that ain't that.

1094
01:05:00,550 --> 01:05:04,330
So it's just,
and so you deal with the world as it is,

1095
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:09,070
as we all do.
And if a word comes along with it works,

1096
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:14,680
it will be used by people because people
are interacting in negotiating.

1097
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:20,640
It doesn't happen because there is a
legal idea that the world has to respond

1098
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:24,930
to your needs.
It's just not the case.

1099
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:28,980
If the world is required to,
to validate your identity,

1100
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:33,220
you are done for,
and the reason for that is that every

1101
01:05:33,221 --> 01:05:37,510
single one of you have a pathological
direction in which you are likely to go.

1102
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:41,200
And that's because every temperamental
virtue comes with a temperamental bites.

1103
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:42,490
And so the only,
you know,

1104
01:05:42,491 --> 01:05:44,560
you think you were saying,
it's like you're not,

1105
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:45,790
you're not even close.

1106
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:48,400
If I put you alone in a cave for two
weeks,

1107
01:05:48,401 --> 01:05:49,470
you'd be done.
Oh,

1108
01:05:49,471 --> 01:05:53,320
he can't.
You can't be saying on your own.

1109
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:56,140
And so what happens is that your
parents,

1110
01:05:56,141 --> 01:05:59,650
if they have any sense,
train you roughly speaking to be vaguely

1111
01:05:59,651 --> 01:06:03,370
acceptable to other people and they keep
nudging and winking at you every time

1112
01:06:03,371 --> 01:06:07,060
you're a moron so that you,
you get nudged into something

1113
01:06:07,061 --> 01:06:11,140
approximating acceptable and you're
clued in enough to pay attention.

1114
01:06:11,141 --> 01:06:14,800
So when someone raises an eyebrow or
does it find your job funny or something

1115
01:06:14,801 --> 01:06:18,970
rather subtle like that,
you immediately revise your identity.

1116
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:22,030
And we're always nudging and tapping
each other nonstop,

1117
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:25,000
exchanging information about how to stay
sane.

1118
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:29,470
And if I'm forced into a position where
I have to validate your identity,

1119
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:32,170
it's like,
what if your identity is wrong?

1120
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:35,620
What if it's pathological?
What if it doesn't serve you well?

1121
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,320
And I start validating.
You think I'm your friend.

1122
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:42,220
I'm not your friend at all.
I'm a mirror for your narcissism and you

1123
01:06:42,221 --> 01:06:45,820
will disappear and drown.
And I see this happening all the time

1124
01:06:45,821 --> 01:06:48,160
with people.
Like if you're fortunate,

1125
01:06:48,161 --> 01:06:52,930
you're surrounded by people who like you
now and wish you'd be a little better

1126
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:57,160
and they'll let you know when you're
failing on that and then you think you

1127
01:06:57,161 --> 01:06:59,620
don't even have to think that much.
All you have to use watch.

1128
01:06:59,621 --> 01:07:02,670
It's like,
is this person like rolling their eyes?

1129
01:07:02,671 --> 01:07:05,800
It that's a bad one that predicts
divorce by the way.

1130
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:08,950
And you get to Ireland and stage,
that's not good.

1131
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:10,720
But basically,
you know you're,

1132
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,970
you're fortunate that people don't
validate your damn identity.

1133
01:07:13,971 --> 01:07:16,920
It's like what makes you think you've
caught your identity?

1134
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,810
Figure note,
you're really complicated and you're

1135
01:07:19,811 --> 01:07:23,800
clueless as hell about it because he
can't represent yourself entirely.

1136
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:26,530
You're the most complicated thing that
exists.

1137
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:30,280
How are you going to come up with an
accurate definition of your identity?

1138
01:07:30,690 --> 01:07:33,010
You got a hundred people out there
helping you out.

1139
01:07:33,011 --> 01:07:36,670
If you've got any sense,
if you're vaguely tolerable and you know

1140
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:40,600
they're kind of hinting at you what not
only what you are but what you might

1141
01:07:40,601 --> 01:07:42,190
become.
Man,

1142
01:07:42,191 --> 01:07:44,650
you should welcome invalidation,
validation of your identity.

1143
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:47,460
Now malicious,
well that's a different story but it's,

1144
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:52,180
it's not that easy to separate out
accurate criticism,

1145
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:55,420
especially if it hits you right where it
hurts,

1146
01:07:55,421 --> 01:07:58,410
which is where you're wrong.
You can't separating that out

1147
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:01,450
maliciousness or hate speech.
It's like good luck,

1148
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:05,080
good luck.
You never learned anything without pain.

1149
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:09,460
And often when you receive a piece of
corrective information from someone,

1150
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:11,620
so like if you could throw that person
in jail,

1151
01:08:11,621 --> 01:08:13,870
you would,
that doesn't mean they're wrong.

1152
01:08:14,350 --> 01:08:16,040
So do you have a question?

1153
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:16,933
Yeah,
the question.

1154
01:08:17,750 --> 01:08:21,290
So looking at the past three years,
cause we do have that benefit,

1155
01:08:21,291 --> 01:08:25,100
but we have the human race Rev.
You know there has been case law but it

1156
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,170
hasn't just been pronoun use,
right?

1157
01:08:27,171 --> 01:08:29,120
It's attached to other forms of
harassment.

1158
01:08:29,121 --> 01:08:32,450
So I would kind of pause it that that's
what we're going to see,

1159
01:08:32,510 --> 01:08:36,410
that it's going to be usually cases of
employers or uh,

1160
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:39,230
you know,
hockey Canada and not allowing a mentor,

1161
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:43,040
someone who identifies as a man took to
change in the locker room,

1162
01:08:43,041 --> 01:08:44,480
that kind of thing.
So does,

1163
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:46,490
does that change your opinion knowing
that,

1164
01:08:46,491 --> 01:08:48,470
you know,
so far with the case all we do have,

1165
01:08:48,471 --> 01:08:50,990
has it been a freedom of speech,
isolated incident?

1166
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:52,340
It doesn't,
it doesn't,

1167
01:08:52,341 --> 01:08:54,380
although I'm not disagreeing with what
you said.

1168
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:56,960
The problem is as far as I'm concerned,
that,

1169
01:08:57,110 --> 01:08:58,940
and this isn't something I addressed
earlier,

1170
01:08:58,950 --> 01:09:03,950
is that bad legislation will be cooptive
by people you just cast and despise.

1171
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,190
And so even if these people are
reasonable,

1172
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:10,130
as soon as problem is,
as soon as you put bad law in place,

1173
01:09:10,370 --> 01:09:15,110
bad people rushing to enforce it.
And so you're basically stating while

1174
01:09:15,111 --> 01:09:18,030
there's a human rights organization,
say it's so,

1175
01:09:18,031 --> 01:09:21,230
so societal organization,
it's been reasonable and it's,

1176
01:09:21,231 --> 01:09:23,510
it's,
it's a decision so far,

1177
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,790
which are not completely convinced the
wait,

1178
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:28,430
but you know,
so they made some mistakes that happens.

1179
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:32,900
But the idea that under the current
legal conditions with this particular

1180
01:09:32,901 --> 01:09:35,900
legislation in place,
those are the same people that are going

1181
01:09:35,901 --> 01:09:38,420
to be running it in the near future is
wrong,

1182
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:43,580
is that people who want this kind of
power will rush in to take it.

1183
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:45,860
That's exactly,
it always happens.

1184
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,930
So it certainly happened in this
situation.

1185
01:09:47,931 --> 01:09:50,570
It's like imagine an insurance company.
So you're,

1186
01:09:50,571 --> 01:09:53,420
you worked for an insurance company and
you have to decide if grandma gets her

1187
01:09:53,421 --> 01:09:55,280
cancer treatment.
Well,

1188
01:09:55,281 --> 01:09:58,040
if you're the least bit compassionate,
your last,

1189
01:09:58,041 --> 01:10:03,041
call it 15 minutes and not yours because
every day you're making absolutely

1190
01:10:03,710 --> 01:10:06,380
brutal,
brutal decisions and you have to,

1191
01:10:06,381 --> 01:10:09,290
because the insurance company doesn't
have an infinite amount of money.

1192
01:10:09,890 --> 01:10:11,540
Well,
so what happens to people in those

1193
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:16,541
positions while either quit or they get
hard hearted as hell or people who can

1194
01:10:17,841 --> 01:10:20,630
do just that with no problem occupy the
positions?

1195
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:23,240
Well,
it's the same situation here.

1196
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:27,380
Bad legislation makes bad rulers and I
think this legislation is,

1197
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:28,833
it's,
it's,

1198
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:31,640
it's so bad.
It's almost unbelievable.

1199
01:10:31,641 --> 01:10:35,120
You know that if you're an employer,
you're basically responsible for all the

1200
01:10:35,121 --> 01:10:39,650
inaction or action of your employees.
If they offend someone,

1201
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:42,320
whether or not that offense is
documented or not,

1202
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:46,280
whether or not it was intended,
it's like who would write a piece of

1203
01:10:46,281 --> 01:10:50,600
legislation like that?
Well you can read the Ontario Human

1204
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,600
Rights Commission's policies.
It's like it's their quick plain as day.

1205
01:10:54,770 --> 01:10:57,320
So no,
I don't trust the legislation at all and

1206
01:10:57,321 --> 01:10:59,400
I don't believe that it would be
reasonably enforced.

1207
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:01,760
I think the courts will take it apart
over time,

1208
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:07,270
but
it will cost some one and it could have

1209
01:11:07,971 --> 01:11:12,971
been me and still might be a lot,
a lot so

1210
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,020
and other people will suffer while
that's happening.

1211
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:18,330
That's how I,
that's how I see you.

1212
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:20,640
Yeah.
So you've had your hand up for a long

1213
01:11:20,641 --> 01:11:22,640
time.
First of all,

1214
01:11:22,710 --> 01:11:24,900
even though I disagree with you,
thank you very much for coming to speak

1215
01:11:24,901 --> 01:11:25,960
with us.
Um,

1216
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:29,360
I had sort of two quick points.
One of them like be more planning

1217
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:31,500
question.
I thought it was interesting in response

1218
01:11:31,501 --> 01:11:33,720
to an earlier question.
You said something about pronouns being

1219
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:36,420
a linguistically closed category.
I thought that was an interesting

1220
01:11:36,421 --> 01:11:39,060
concept because we've all been using the
singular you all night,

1221
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:41,220
even though that historically didn't
exist in English.

1222
01:11:41,221 --> 01:11:44,070
So clearly things do change for announce
do change.

1223
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:48,200
But my question for you is,
your concern was that pronouns could be

1224
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:50,880
a sort of eliminate this category,
or at least that was my understanding.

1225
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:53,340
We have limitless categories all over
the place.

1226
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:55,800
Uh,
the charter recognizes that individual

1227
01:11:55,801 --> 01:11:57,750
people's conceptions of religion can
differ.

1228
01:11:57,930 --> 01:12:00,510
Names are limitless category.
Um,

1229
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:04,440
so why prone,
why pronouns in particular concern.

1230
01:12:04,441 --> 01:12:06,810
And if you don't accept the front and
someone else tells you,

1231
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:09,990
where should you get the pronoun to
refer to them as if they are not the

1232
01:12:09,991 --> 01:12:10,824
source of it.
What it's,

1233
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,030
well,
I don't well

1234
01:12:12,030 --> 01:12:14,550
care what pronouns people want to be
addressed by.

1235
01:12:14,551 --> 01:12:19,551
And of course they have different names,
but I'm not required by forced to use

1236
01:12:19,741 --> 01:12:21,750
them.
So that's the fundamental

1237
01:12:21,751 --> 01:12:24,330
characteristic.
It's like it isn't whether or not you

1238
01:12:24,331 --> 01:12:26,400
can decide to use whatever pronouns you
want,

1239
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:28,350
but you're,
that isn't what we're discussing.

1240
01:12:28,351 --> 01:12:30,730
We're discussing whether or not I should
be required by force.

1241
01:12:30,731 --> 01:12:33,600
Do you use the same pronouns?
And there's no such thing as a limitless

1242
01:12:33,601 --> 01:12:34,590
category,
by the way,

1243
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:37,050
that's an impossibility because a
category,

1244
01:12:37,170 --> 01:12:39,540
you read your post modernists,
they figured this out.

1245
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:42,240
Categories,
you acquire limits and limits,

1246
01:12:42,241 --> 01:12:44,940
exclude and marginalize.
It's the central doctrine of

1247
01:12:44,941 --> 01:12:47,370
postmodernism,
and so they're the critics of

1248
01:12:47,371 --> 01:12:49,500
categorization and that's why I'm
bringing them up.

1249
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:53,310
If you know they're not friends of
categorization,

1250
01:12:53,550 --> 01:12:56,670
I'm making the argument for the enemies
of categorization.

1251
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:59,310
And so there's no such thing as a
limitless category,

1252
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:03,600
which is also actually by the way,
why the lgbt acronym universe keeps

1253
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:08,100
multiplying is because they're actually,
what's actually happening is that there

1254
01:13:08,101 --> 01:13:11,550
is a category which you might consider
normative sexual behavior,

1255
01:13:11,551 --> 01:13:15,120
traditional sexual behavior,
and there's those who do not fit into

1256
01:13:15,121 --> 01:13:16,020
that category as well.

1257
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:18,870
No one fits into that category.
So the category,

1258
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:22,920
it's a category without limits.
That excluded is a category without

1259
01:13:22,921 --> 01:13:24,210
limits.
It's not a category.

1260
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:28,800
It falls apart of the total in court.
It tends towards infinite multiplicity.

1261
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:32,790
It has to because it contains an
infinite multiplicity and that will

1262
01:13:32,791 --> 01:13:35,640
manifest itself across time.
So,

1263
01:13:36,540 --> 01:13:38,310
um,
and then with regards to,

1264
01:13:38,370 --> 01:13:40,350
you know,
why we use the pronouns we used,

1265
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:41,430
it's like,
well who knows?

1266
01:13:41,490 --> 01:13:42,920
I don't know.
It's,

1267
01:13:42,930 --> 01:13:46,050
it's partly I don't buy the youth thing
by the way,

1268
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:48,040
cause it was valid before that.
And you know,

1269
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:50,640
so there was still a marker in the same
linguistic category,

1270
01:13:50,641 --> 01:13:52,490
but,
and technically they are close to

1271
01:13:52,491 --> 01:13:54,300
linguistic categories.
So if they change,

1272
01:13:54,301 --> 01:13:56,550
they change very slowly.
But whatever,

1273
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,320
you know,
I'm going to seed that.

1274
01:13:58,330 --> 01:14:02,970
But technically I think it's erroneous.
Can they transform much slower than

1275
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:05,000
other categories for?
So let's put it that way.

1276
01:14:05,730 --> 01:14:09,480
So where do these come from?
It's common to use the comments,

1277
01:14:09,481 --> 01:14:11,590
man.
It's like everyone decided that over

1278
01:14:11,591 --> 01:14:13,870
some extended period of time and it
seems to work.

1279
01:14:13,871 --> 01:14:16,870
So people use it to,
and it's certainly not because of

1280
01:14:16,871 --> 01:14:20,920
subjective decision.
I mean that's an element yet obviously,

1281
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:26,230
but it's only one who knows how many
elements we don't know.

1282
01:14:26,650 --> 01:14:28,020
Manny.
So,

1283
01:14:30,610 --> 01:14:32,300
all right,
well we're out of time.

1284
01:14:32,420 --> 01:14:34,570
Thank you very much for our participants
with Jack

1285
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:39,720
[inaudible].

1286
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:51,010
Herr Professor Party.
Argue devil's advocate because no other

1287
01:14:51,011 --> 01:14:56,011
law professor was willing to argue
because I think we all three agreed that

1288
01:14:56,471 --> 01:14:59,890
this was a very important conversation
and it was very satisfying.

1289
01:15:00,190 --> 01:15:02,200
Um,
so if you'd like to see more provocative

1290
01:15:02,201 --> 01:15:04,960
debates or get involved with us worth
thriving newsroom,

1291
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:08,290
they're writing needs society.
We will be hosting our student

1292
01:15:08,291 --> 01:15:11,350
leadership conference in the summer in
the country in Ontario.

1293
01:15:11,820 --> 01:15:14,670
Do we have a lot of things around?
So thank you very much for coming.

1294
01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:15,100
And things.
