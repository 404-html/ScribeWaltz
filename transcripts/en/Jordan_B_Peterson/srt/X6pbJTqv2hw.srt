1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:01,510
Okay,

2
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,420
so we'll continue with our union 
analysis of the lion king today.

3
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:18,523
We ended at the point where you remember
Mufasa had taken Simba up to the top of 

4
00:00:25,011 --> 00:00:25,844
pride rock and
described to him the fact that his 

5
00:00:30,261 --> 00:00:33,650
kingdom essentially constituted 
everything that the light touched.

6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,553
You can think about that as the domain 
of the roughly speaking of the great 

7
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,960
father with the domain of the great 
mother on the outside of that,

8
00:00:41,961 --> 00:00:46,640
that being symbolically equivalent to 
the underworld or to death or to nature.

9
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:47,523
All of those things seem to be 
approximately equally true and he 

10
00:00:50,871 --> 00:00:51,704
forbade Simba from going to investigate 
what was beyond the confines of the 

11
00:00:56,151 --> 00:01:00,320
light and in some sense that's exactly 
what a tradition does for you.

12
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,850
It because the tradition is precisely 
what defines the domain of the light and

13
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,420
to be moral from the perspective of the 
tradition.

14
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:13,400
It's akin to playing a Piagetian game,
but only adhering to the rules.

15
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,180
You know how Piaget described the fact 
that when kids first master a game,

16
00:01:17,181 --> 00:01:18,860
they learn,
they learn how to act it out,

17
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:19,903
and then they learn what the rules are 
and then they regard the rules in some 

18
00:01:22,521 --> 00:01:23,354
sense as sacred.
You can't go outside the rules and then 

19
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:28,670
later in moral development,
if they get to that stage,

20
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,504
then they start to recognize themselves 
also as formulators of the rule or 

21
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:33,884
formulators of the game.
And culture tells you don't go beyond 

22
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:39,590
the rules.
That's the definition of morality within

23
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:41,870
the box of culture and you don't go 
outside of that.

24
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:47,230
And so that's why move Fossa plays that 
particular role and it's wise because if

25
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:48,524
you go outside the domain of what you 
already understand that it's dangerous 

26
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:53,390
out there.
Clearly it's dangerous out there.

27
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:57,260
But the downside of that particular 
message,

28
00:01:57,261 --> 00:02:01,670
and this is perhaps this is the 
mythological reason why move Fossa isn't

29
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:03,500
as aware as he could be of scar.

30
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,363
You know,
his knowledge is bounded and he's not 

31
00:02:07,131 --> 00:02:09,320
aware enough of what lies outside of 
that.

32
00:02:09,321 --> 00:02:10,340
In this realm,
let's say,

33
00:02:10,341 --> 00:02:12,680
of death and destruction.
And so,

34
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,360
um,
scar is,

35
00:02:14,361 --> 00:02:18,050
he is able to overcome his,
his,

36
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:18,950
uh,
brother,

37
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,273
one.
You see this sort of thing happening to 

38
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:23,030
people very frequently,
for example,

39
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:23,864
who develop posttraumatic stress 
disorder and one of the things that's 

40
00:02:26,691 --> 00:02:31,280
not as well known about posttraumatic 
stress disorder as might be known as a,

41
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,893
it happens to you if you encounter an 
experience that sort of blows out the 

42
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:38,630
axioms of your knowledge system,
that that's one way of looking at it.

43
00:02:38,631 --> 00:02:39,464
It's so unexpected that you can't 
account for it within the confines of 

44
00:02:43,851 --> 00:02:44,684
the,
of the system that you're using to 

45
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:46,424
interpret the world.
Not often happens to people when they 

46
00:02:48,561 --> 00:02:49,394
encounter something that's truly 
malevolent and that can be within them 

47
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,660
or it can be in the form of someone else
who is genuinely out to hurt them.

48
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,493
They're often people who develop ptsd 
often but not always somewhat naive and 

49
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:07,690
they're are not aware of the full 
catastrophe of the world.

50
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:08,524
That might be one way of looking at it 
and then they encounter someone who's 

51
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,530
truly out to hurt them and they can 
detect that even in the way the person's

52
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,364
face looks or they encounter a part of 
them that's much more malevolent than 

53
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:25,030
they had ever imagined it could possibly
be.

54
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,043
And then they do something terrible and 
then they don't know what to do about 

55
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:29,590
it.
So

56
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,470
Dell or the Canadian general wrote a 
book called shake hands with the devil.

57
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,573
And it was about what happened to him in
Rwanda when he was stationed there as a 

58
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,210
UN,
a warrior or a UN soldier.

59
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,463
And I mean dillera was not naive,
but what he encountered was truly 

60
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,810
malevolent and it just blew them into 
pieces and,

61
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,420
and that that's what happens.

62
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,370
And so there's real utility in staying 
within the bounded domain.

63
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:58,983
But the problem is,
is that there may be information that's 

64
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:03,280
outside of that domain that you 
absolutely need to know.

65
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,293
And so part of the problem with being 
alive is that you have to continually 

66
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,703
determine how much you're going to 
maintain your stability and how much 

67
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:12,784
you're going to explore.
And you have to explore because the 

68
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:20,680
stable part of you gets outdated,
but if you explore it too much or too,

69
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,930
uh,
to unwisely,

70
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,750
then you could encounter things that 
flip you upside down.

71
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,060
It's actually one of the problems with 
being high in trade.

72
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:28,894
Openness,
especially if you're also high in 

73
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:31,750
neuroticism.
Because if you're open,

74
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,330
you're creative,
you're always looking for,

75
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,940
for ideas that are outside of your 
current systematic way of thinking.

76
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,163
But if you're high in neuroticism,
so you experienced a lot of anxiety and 

77
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:44,020
emotional pain and that sort of thing,
you can continually upset your own apple

78
00:04:44,021 --> 00:04:44,854
cart.

79
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,813
Now,
the other thing that you might want to 

80
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:47,434
think about,
this is really useful as far as I'm 

81
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:49,804
concerned,
is you might want to think about this 

82
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:53,230
politically and we've been doing a lot 
of work.

83
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,093
I'm going to have one of my graduate 
students actually come and talk to you 

84
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:56,314
about the work we'd be doing on 
personality and Paul and political 

85
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:00,910
belief.
So what happens with political belief is

86
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:03,850
that if you're high in openness and low 
in conscientiousness,

87
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:04,684
you tend to be a liberal.
The openness being the particularly 

88
00:05:06,671 --> 00:05:07,504
important part of that,
and if you're low in openness and high 

89
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:11,860
in conscientiousness,
especially orderliness,

90
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:12,843
you tend to be a conservative.
Now it's kind of strange because 

91
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,830
openness and conscientiousness aren't 
very highly correlated,

92
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,933
so it's not obvious why those two traits
would combine to determine political 

93
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,033
belief and and the relationship is 
actually quite strong between 

94
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:26,914
temperament and political belief if you 
measure political belief 

95
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:29,224
comprehensively,
but it seems to me that the fundamental 

96
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:33,880
distinction,
and this is the political game,

97
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,840
at least along the liberal conservative 
access is boils down to one thing.

98
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,123
It boils down to how open borders should
be compared to how close they should be 

99
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,610
and you know,
you can see that reflected,

100
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:46,444
for example,
in the attractiveness of trump to a 

101
00:05:48,551 --> 00:05:52,450
large part of the general population 
because he's going to close the borders,

102
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:53,284
build a wall,
and fortify the borders and 

103
00:05:55,601 --> 00:05:59,210
conservatives like that.
They like to have borders between things

104
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:00,044
stay tight and they don't even care if 
it's state borders or political borders 

105
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:08,660
or town borders or ethnic borders or 
borders between ideas or borders between

106
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:09,494
sexual identities.
Conservatives like to have things stay 

107
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:12,974
in the damn box where they belong,
partly because they're orderly and 

108
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:18,320
partly because they're low in openness.
They don't get any real.

109
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,070
They're not interested in what happens 
if you free up your conceptions.

110
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,730
All they see in that is the probability 
of disorder.

111
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,953
Whereas liberals who are high in 
openness and low in conscientiousness 

112
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:30,823
slash orderliness,
they get a real charge out of letting 

113
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:35,900
things out of the box so that they can 
creatively interplay.

114
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,213
Now the issue is who's correct and the 
answer is you don't know because the 

115
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:42,614
environment underneath the political 
landscape moves and so sometimes the 

116
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:46,784
right answer is tightened up.
The borders and fortify and sometimes 

117
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:50,440
the right answer is no,
no,

118
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,283
no.
Loosen things up because everything's 

119
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:53,743
getting too static and tight and we need
more information and the dialogue that 

120
00:06:58,221 --> 00:07:02,000
occurs in the political landscape with 
this is why dialogue is so important,

121
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,133
is fundamentally between these two 
opposing views of borders and because 

122
00:07:06,891 --> 00:07:10,250
you can't say with certainty which one 
is right at any given time,

123
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,623
an open dialogue has to maintain itself 
so that the entire political state can 

124
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,840
maneuver properly.
Along that moving line,

125
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,330
it's absolutely crucial.
It's really,

126
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,433
really,
really useful to know that people vote 

127
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:26,740
their damn temperament.
It gets you.

128
00:07:26,741 --> 00:07:29,600
It gives you more of an understanding,
at least in principle of your,

129
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:30,643
of those who sit on the other side of 
you on the political fence and there's 

130
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:36,170
been recent newspaper articles,
quite interesting.

131
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,300
I tweeted a couple of them about this 
company in UK called Cambridge analytics

132
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,283
and they're using the damn big five.
They can extract out big five 

133
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:45,644
information from your facebook likes.
They've got a model of every single 

134
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,100
person in the United States,
big five personality,

135
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,143
and they helped trump craft political 
messages right down to the level of 

136
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,434
apartment buildings to appeal to people 
based on their big five temperament and 

137
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:02,474
that's all recent work.
And so one of the things that's very 

138
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:05,624
interesting is we are teaching computers
to understand us so fast you can't 

139
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:09,464
believe it,
and we really do risk walking into an 

140
00:08:12,021 --> 00:08:15,380
electronic world where you will only see
what you want to see.

141
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,020
I mean,
obviously the marketers are trying to do

142
00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:19,550
that as fast as possible,
right?

143
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:23,060
They only want to send you ads that 
you're going to be interested in because

144
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:23,894
it's expensive and foolish to send you 
anything that will annoy you or that 

145
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:29,810
you'll ignore.
And so the marketers are trying like mad

146
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:33,800
to map who you are.
Even by watching your eyes there.

147
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,763
They're trying to figure out who you are
so they can send you the right 

148
00:08:36,171 --> 00:08:38,450
information.
But the danger is that that'll happen.

149
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,060
Say in the domain of news and broader 
information,

150
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,193
increasing this tendency for people to 
be siloed in their exposure to the 

151
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:45,614
external world.
It's a big sort of like each of us is 

152
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:53,081
becoming a micro celebrity surrounded by
electronic sycophants who do nothing but

153
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:56,190
tell us exactly what we want to hear.
It's a real

154
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,670
problem.
Karl Popper,

155
00:08:57,671 --> 00:08:58,504
a famous philosopher of science said 
that one of the things that you should 

156
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:03,420
do,
and this is akin to the jetty and view,

157
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,553
is you should always look for 
information that contradicts your 

158
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:08,040
current viewpoint.
Now,

159
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,060
that's painful,
right?

160
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:11,160
Because who wants their axioms?
Contradicted.

161
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,203
It can take you apart,
but it's the only way that you can 

162
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:15,384
ensure that you're learning at the same 
time that you're maintaining your 

163
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:18,774
stability and that's another reason why 
it's really necessary to engage in 

164
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:22,494
dialogue with people that you do not 
agree with because they're the ones who 

165
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:27,030
will tell you things that you don't 
know.

166
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,193
It's crew.
It's of crucial importance in the 

167
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:30,204
maintenance of your own stability.
The worst thing that can happen to a 

168
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:33,600
person,
no,

169
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,210
because there's many horrible things 
that can happen to a person,

170
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:37,044
but one of the worst things that can 
happen is that you find yourself in a 

171
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:39,984
situation where no one is offering you 
corrective feedback anymore because you 

172
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:48,270
rely on the corrective feedback provided
by other people to keep yourself sane,

173
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:50,640
to keep moving in the ever changing 
environment.

174
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,100
And if you cut yourself off from that 
feedback,

175
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,180
then well then you end up static and 
shrinking.

176
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:59,100
It's really,
it's really not good.

177
00:09:59,101 --> 00:09:59,934
You get less and less competent.
You get less and less confident and the 

178
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:04,890
threats outside of you loom larger and 
larger.

179
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,880
So that's all to do with the,
uh,

180
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,990
you know,
the domain outside the light.

181
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,580
So young would also say that out in this
domain,

182
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,743
that sort of beyond what you understand,
that's also where you encounter the 

183
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,730
archetypes of the collective 
unconscious.

184
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:21,660
Now,
that's a really,

185
00:10:21,661 --> 00:10:22,494
really complicated idea,
but what he means by that is that if 

186
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:28,320
you're put outside the domain of your 
competence,

187
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:32,280
you're going to start to use fantasy to 
organize your world.

188
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:34,680
So I can give you an example of that.
So you,

189
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,583
you,
you,

190
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:40,200
I presume most of you are old enough to 
have a conscious memory of when the twin

191
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:41,034
towers came crashing down and so 
everybody in the days after that was 

192
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:46,470
wandering around like they were in a 
daze.

193
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,570
And the reason they were in a daze is 
because,

194
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,613
well,
it wasn't exactly clear what fell right 

195
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,583
there is the physical towers fell,
but that was only a tiny bit of the 

196
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:55,884
problem because those physical towers 
were embedded in a network of meaning 

197
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:02,010
like a very,
very sophisticated network of meaning,

198
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:02,844
but also a political network and an 
economic network and a military network 

199
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,730
and their nodes inside a very complex 
system.

200
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:09,564
And so when they come crashing down,
you don't know what's come crashing 

201
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:13,470
down,
right?

202
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:14,304
So when you're out there in the unknown 
and wondering what's going on and 

203
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:17,424
wandering around in a daze,
which is exactly what happened to 

204
00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:21,090
people.
And then what Bush did,

205
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:26,190
George W was immediately turned that 
into a good versus evil drama instantly.

206
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,383
And that's an archetypal idea.
So that's when he came up with the idea 

207
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:32,760
of the axis of evil,
I think that was Iran,

208
00:11:32,761 --> 00:11:33,594
North Korea,
and I don't remember the other one at 

209
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:36,594
the moment,
but,

210
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:37,643
but he,
he,

211
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,400
he immediately turned the political 
landscape into a good versus evil drama.

212
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,383
And he said to everyone in the world 
that they were either with him or 

213
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:47,010
against him fundamentally.
And that was the,

214
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,780
that was part of the retreating into a,
I guess a more protected landscape.

215
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:56,140
That's one of the ways that human beings
deal with the encounter with a traumatic

216
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:56,974
threat.
And so the reason you meet the 

217
00:11:58,631 --> 00:11:59,464
unconscious and even the collective 
unconscious on the border of your 

218
00:12:02,831 --> 00:12:05,770
knowledge is because when you hit the 
border of your knowledge,

219
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:06,843
you start to use fantasy in order to 
bring the newest form of order out of 

220
00:12:11,801 --> 00:12:14,350
the unknown so that you can start to 
make sense out of it.

221
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:18,010
And that's what artists always do.
That's what they do.

222
00:12:18,011 --> 00:12:18,844
And so from the union perspective,
people who are engaged in creative art 

223
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,670
are the ones who are on the perimeter of
knowledge structures.

224
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:27,220
And so what they're doing is taking the 
absolute unknown,

225
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:32,230
which would be in Rumsfeld's terms,
the unknown unknowns,

226
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:35,080
and turning them into partially known 
unknowns.

227
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,123
That's what an artist does.
And and especially the more classical 

228
00:12:39,191 --> 00:12:41,590
artists who deal with mythological and 
religious themes,

229
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:42,424
which was the case for art right up 
until really until the late 20th 

230
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:46,390
century,
they're,

231
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,243
they're using these mythological ideas 
to sort of extend the domain of human 

232
00:12:50,921 --> 00:12:53,590
knowledge out beyond its current 
parameters.

233
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:58,140
And so artists do that and literary 
people do that and,

234
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,110
and dramatists do that and they help us 
extend our knowledge.

235
00:13:02,111 --> 00:13:05,920
Now that's where open people live.
That's another way of thinking about it.

236
00:13:05,921 --> 00:13:06,754
So think about it this way.
So you're in a city and the city has 

237
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:10,354
parts of it that degenerate and so you 
could think about that as order 

238
00:13:12,771 --> 00:13:13,604
degenerating into chaos.
And then the open people who are 

239
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:16,804
creative come along and they find places
in the city that have degenerated but 

240
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:22,840
that still have interesting potential,
right?

241
00:13:22,841 --> 00:13:25,330
And then they move in there where it's 
cheap to.

242
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:26,163
And they start producing art,
they start producing galleries and then 

243
00:13:28,571 --> 00:13:29,404
the coffee shops move in and then the 
thing starts to get civilized and then 

244
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:36,310
of course the more liberal conservative 
types move in.

245
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:38,530
Those would be the Yuppies,
roughly speaking.

246
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:41,560
So they're much more conservative than 
the artists,

247
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,530
but they're still liberal compared to 
the bulk of the population.

248
00:13:44,531 --> 00:13:48,730
And so the more daring people move in 
after the artists of civilized it.

249
00:13:48,731 --> 00:13:50,170
And then after that,
you know,

250
00:13:50,171 --> 00:13:51,004
then the chain stores start to move in 
and soon it's completely turned into 

251
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:54,304
sellers or something like that.
And then the artists have to go 

252
00:13:56,771 --> 00:14:00,940
somewhere else and find another place on
the boundary where they can live.

253
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,833
And it's a physical.
It's a physical boundary as much as a 

254
00:14:03,371 --> 00:14:04,840
mental boundary.
And so you,

255
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,780
because you think each of those 
personality traits,

256
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:08,643
there's five dimensions,
each of them represent the possibility 

257
00:14:11,111 --> 00:14:13,360
of inhabiting a kind of niche,
right?

258
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,300
In ecological niche.
So if you're an extroverted person,

259
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,640
your niches,
the social environment,

260
00:14:18,641 --> 00:14:20,860
if you're an introverted person,
the niches,

261
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:21,694
I think nature,
I don't know that for sure because I've 

262
00:14:23,981 --> 00:14:26,470
never figured out exactly what 
introverts are adapted to,

263
00:14:26,471 --> 00:14:30,340
but it's not exactly the social world.
If you're agreeable,

264
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:33,750
then your niche is relationships.
If you're disagreeable your niches,

265
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,560
competition,
if you're conscientious,

266
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,450
you're niche niches,
duty and effort,

267
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,823
and so
those niches are partly social because 

268
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,953
so much of her environment is social,
but they're also partly natural because 

269
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:50,920
our social being is nested inside the 
natural world and so you can think about

270
00:14:50,921 --> 00:14:51,754
the big five traits as different kinds 
of adaptations to different kinds of 

271
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,440
niches and the niche that the open 
people,

272
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,833
the open exploratory types occupy,
so that seems to make a higher order 

273
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:04,634
super factor.
Extraversion and openness called 

274
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:09,770
plasticity as opposed to stability,
which is conscientiousness,

275
00:15:09,771 --> 00:15:10,604
agreeableness and emotional stability 
and there's a playoff between those two 

276
00:15:14,061 --> 00:15:16,850
things because the stable people 
obviously are stable,

277
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,463
but the plastic types of people are more
dynamic and they're more concerned with 

278
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:23,090
transformation.

279
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:27,620
And in order to get a system optimally 
stable and dynamic,

280
00:15:27,621 --> 00:15:29,660
you have to have a continual interplay 
of those,

281
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:34,040
of those factors because static doesn't 
work because everything changes.

282
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:34,963
That's the problem with conservatism.
And the problem with liberalism 

283
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:39,650
fundamentally is yes,
everything changes,

284
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:43,070
but you have to bring forward some 
structures from the past.

285
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,810
So it's very,
it's very,

286
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,000
very difficult to get that balance 
correct.

287
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,910
So,
all right,

288
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:52,490
so anyways,
out there in the underworld,

289
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,850
in the place beyond your current 
conceptualizations,

290
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:56,803
that's the place of death and nature and
it's beyond the light and it's also the 

291
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:02,480
place of hell.
And that's what you see here.

292
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:05,030
And what do you,
how do you conceptualize that?

293
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:05,893
Well,
one of the things you'll see if you're 

294
00:16:07,581 --> 00:16:08,414
interested in this sort of thing,
if you ever go read the writings of the 

295
00:16:11,781 --> 00:16:14,540
Columbine killers that the teens,
they're very interesting.

296
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,270
They're very much worth reading,
especially,

297
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,450
I think it's Dylan Klebold who was the 
more literate of of the two,

298
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:25,580
but he tells you exactly where he went 
after brooding and brooding and brooding

299
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:26,414
on his,
his isolation and segregation from 

300
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,280
mankind.
So he's out there beyond,

301
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:35,000
he's out there in a chaotic domain and 
because he's tortured by that,

302
00:16:35,001 --> 00:16:37,280
his thoughts taken unbelievably dark 
turn,

303
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,720
like it's unimaginably dark if you're 
interested in that sort of thing.

304
00:16:41,721 --> 00:16:42,554
You could read that.
There's another book you could read 

305
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,580
called Pans,
Ram p a and zed r a m,

306
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,080
and it's a fascinating book.
It's about this guy who I think he raped

307
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,003
1200 men.
So that sort of tells you what sort of 

308
00:16:53,991 --> 00:16:54,824
guy.
He was extraordinarily physically 

309
00:16:55,911 --> 00:17:00,830
powerful and brutal and malevolent,
and he was kind of a juvenile delinquent

310
00:17:00,831 --> 00:17:01,664
type and they put them in a reform 
school and he was not well treated in 

311
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:05,690
that reform school.

312
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:08,720
It's sort of like the worst of the 
Canadian residential schools.

313
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,020
And when he came out he was not a happy 
boy.

314
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,513
And so he spent the rest of his life 
trying to be as destructive as he could 

315
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:21,170
possibly imagine and purely consciously 
with malevolent intent.

316
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,660
And then,
and,

317
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,920
and believe me,
he was pretty destructive.

318
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:27,080
He kept track of the dollar value of all
the buildings.

319
00:17:27,081 --> 00:17:27,914
He burned down.
He tried to start a war between Britain 

320
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:33,180
and the United States.
He was an all out for all out may Hamp,

321
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,690
his dying words that they are going 
gonna hang him.

322
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,990
He told the guy who was going to hang 
him too.

323
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,850
He said,
hurry up you who's your bastard?

324
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,640
I could kill 12 men in the time it takes
you to hang me,

325
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:44,743
and that's exactly the sort of person he
was and he made friends with this 

326
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,433
physician in the in the prison who he 
thought was the first person who ever 

327
00:17:52,591 --> 00:17:55,230
did something nice for him,
gave him a dollar for cigarettes,

328
00:17:55,231 --> 00:17:56,064
if I remember correctly,
and the physician encouraged him to 

329
00:17:57,901 --> 00:17:58,734
write his autobiography and so we did 
and it's available and so if you want 

330
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:03,923
view,
because you know you always think of 

331
00:18:05,731 --> 00:18:06,990
people,
you think,

332
00:18:06,991 --> 00:18:08,580
well,
people have good intentions.

333
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,850
You know that you especially think that 
if you're naive and agreeable,

334
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:12,893
so all of you who are sitting there out 
there thinking people have good 

335
00:18:15,031 --> 00:18:17,340
intentions,
you're probably high in agreeableness,

336
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:18,563
but that's not always the case.
People can have very dark motivations 

337
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:27,000
that are fully conscious and very well 
elaborated and pans around was no,

338
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,103
he was smart and his book is very well 
written and he tells you exactly why he 

339
00:18:32,101 --> 00:18:32,934
thought the way he thought and so it's a
good glimpse of exactly this sort of 

340
00:18:35,731 --> 00:18:36,564
thing where you can get to if you want 
to buy brooding on your specific 

341
00:18:39,781 --> 00:18:40,990
misfortune.
You know,

342
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:41,893
in his.
His basic credo was that human beings 

343
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:47,100
were so reprehensible that they should 
just be eliminated and believe me,

344
00:18:47,101 --> 00:18:51,120
that's what he was trying to do and 
these people who do terrible things like

345
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:51,954
the columbine shooters.
That's exactly what for block of a 

346
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:58,890
better word they're possessed by it's 
sheer malevolence and the columbine kids

347
00:18:58,891 --> 00:18:59,724
had a much more spectacular catastrophe 
planned than the one that actually 

348
00:19:02,731 --> 00:19:07,020
occurred and they knew it was going to 
be a full blown media circus and lots of

349
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:09,900
these people who engage in those sorts 
of mass murders.

350
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,950
They know about the other mass murderers
and they're engaged in a competition and

351
00:19:13,951 --> 00:19:16,770
the competition is who can do the most 
brutal thing the fastest.

352
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,633
Something like that.
So you can't just be thinking about 

353
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:23,160
people who've,
who have good intentions,

354
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:23,994
but have somehow gone wrong.
If you ever meet someone who isn't like 

355
00:19:26,581 --> 00:19:30,810
that and you think that you're just a 
tree with ripe fruit to be plucked,

356
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,540
so you don't want to be in that 
situation.

357
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:36,420
You have to keep your eyes open.
And so anyways,

358
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,000
that's basically what's encapsulated in 
this part of the story.

359
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:42,960
Now the hygienists go after the little 
lie and obviously,

360
00:19:42,961 --> 00:19:43,794
but they managed to escape it's very 
malevolent scene and a move fossa shows 

361
00:19:49,351 --> 00:19:52,170
up at the last minute to rescue them.
So,

362
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,770
and you know that there's also a 
mythological trope there,

363
00:19:55,771 --> 00:19:56,604
which is that if you go outside your 
domain of competence and you encounter 

364
00:19:59,611 --> 00:20:00,444
something you don't understand,
the first thing that you're going to do 

365
00:20:02,371 --> 00:20:06,030
is look to the knowledge structures that
you already possess to explain it.

366
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,200
Right?
And that's the,

367
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,033
you could say from a symbolic 
perspective that that's the 

368
00:20:09,961 --> 00:20:13,530
manifestation of the father because of 
course that's what you're going to do.

369
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,440
And you know what's really interesting 
too,

370
00:20:16,441 --> 00:20:17,274
is because I've had a lot of clients 
who've had ptsd and and without 

371
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:20,874
exception,
every single one of them was induced by 

372
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:23,514
one form of malevolence or another.
They have to develop a very 

373
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:26,814
sophisticated philosophy of good and 
evil to get out of it because they have 

374
00:20:29,971 --> 00:20:32,400
a worldview in which those things don't 
really exist.

375
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:34,410
There's no such thing as pure 
malevolence.

376
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,690
Well,
that's fine unless you encounter it,

377
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:40,440
and then as soon as you encounter it,
as soon as you encounter it,

378
00:20:40,441 --> 00:20:44,220
you won't know what to do and then you 
won't be able to get on with your life.

379
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,233
You'll do nothing but think about that 
and think about it and think about it 

380
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:48,750
and think about it.

381
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,583
It'll disrupt your sleep.
It'll put you into a permanent state of 

382
00:20:52,091 --> 00:20:56,500
preparation for action because the part 
of your brain that's detected that which

383
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:58,600
in my estimation by the way,
is the same part,

384
00:20:58,601 --> 00:21:02,530
at least in part that detects snakes.
It's the same damn circuit.

385
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,603
Once it's seen something like that,
it is not going to let you go until you 

386
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,770
figure it out.
And that's basically what post traumatic

387
00:21:08,771 --> 00:21:11,170
stress disorder is and you know,
to some degree,

388
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:15,310
each of you will have experienced that.
Maybe not all of you in here,

389
00:21:15,311 --> 00:21:16,144
but many of you and you can tell that.
So if you go back and you think about 

390
00:21:19,391 --> 00:21:23,770
your past and you have any memory that's
more than about 18 months old,

391
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,753
and when you think about it,
it produces a fair bit of negative 

392
00:21:26,591 --> 00:21:29,360
emotion.
Then that's like a.

393
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,730
that's like a place where there's a mini
posttraumatic stress problem.

394
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,340
And what's happened.
You remember I showed you that hierarchy

395
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,540
moving from tiny motor actions all the 
way up to high order abstractions.

396
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,673
Well you can imagine,
say you have good personnel at the top 

397
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:49,330
and you kind of use that scenario to 
construe other people.

398
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,313
People are basically good.
Well then you run into someone who is 

399
00:21:52,631 --> 00:21:53,464
not good and boom,
the whole bloody system comes tumbling 

400
00:21:56,201 --> 00:21:58,810
down because it's violated that highest 
order axiom.

401
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,813
So that's posttraumatic stress disorder.
If something has violated an axiom 

402
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:05,770
that's more differentiated,
you know,

403
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:06,604
closer to the actual motor output,
not quite so high in the abstraction 

404
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:09,994
chain,
then all it does is wipe out that part 

405
00:22:11,741 --> 00:22:12,574
of the structure.
It doesn't wipe out the whole thing and 

406
00:22:14,171 --> 00:22:15,004
you can tell if you have holes in your 
perceptual value structure by checking 

407
00:22:20,321 --> 00:22:21,154
to see if you have memories that are 
still alive in a negative way that are 

408
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,383
old enough so that they should have been
incorporated into your personality and 

409
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:33,391
so one of the things you can do,
you're doing one of the exercises that's

410
00:22:33,421 --> 00:22:34,690
on myself authoring site.

411
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:38,620
You guys do the personality analysis,
but there's another program there called

412
00:22:38,621 --> 00:22:40,870
the.
It's called the past authoring where you

413
00:22:40,871 --> 00:22:41,704
write down an autobiography and thinking
through these things that have happened 

414
00:22:46,061 --> 00:22:46,894
to you in your past that are negative is
a good way of making them go away and 

415
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,673
thinking them through.
Kind of means you have to figure out 

416
00:22:52,811 --> 00:22:54,760
what happened,
right?

417
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,880
And then you sort of have to figure out 
how to make it not happen again.

418
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:01,120
What you're trying to derive is some 
kind of causal analysis.

419
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:05,590
How is it that I was put into a 
situation where I was made vulnerable,

420
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,783
you know,
and that could be well because you're 

421
00:23:07,391 --> 00:23:08,224
only four and you couldn't protect 
yourself and now it's time to update 

422
00:23:10,331 --> 00:23:11,164
that because you're a fully functioning 
adult or there may be things that you 

423
00:23:14,621 --> 00:23:18,670
have to think through and change in your
own personality or attitudes that you've

424
00:23:18,671 --> 00:23:20,860
been holding onto since you were tiny.

425
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,873
I had this client once and she came in 
and told me that she had been sexually 

426
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:27,304
assaulted by her older brother and she 
told me the story and I kind of got the 

427
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:31,444
impression that maybe she was like eight
and he was like 17 or something like 

428
00:23:34,241 --> 00:23:35,074
that.
If she was about 27 when she came and 

429
00:23:36,761 --> 00:23:37,594
talked to me and then I found out by 
further questioning that she was four 

430
00:23:40,511 --> 00:23:41,344
and he was six and I thought she still 
had this story in her head of her being 

431
00:23:45,831 --> 00:23:48,280
tormented by this older person.
Right.

432
00:23:48,281 --> 00:23:51,500
That that's how she told the story and 
what I told her was,

433
00:23:51,501 --> 00:23:52,334
well look,
another way of looking at this is that 

434
00:23:53,571 --> 00:23:57,200
youtube were very badly supervised.
Children,

435
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,060
because I mean he was six for God's 
sake,

436
00:23:59,061 --> 00:24:00,110
you know,
he's a little kid.

437
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:04,340
That doesn't mean that what happened to 
her was any less traumatic but,

438
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,680
but he wasn't 17,
right?

439
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:10,100
The story was different than the one she
had in her head and you know,

440
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,010
by the time she left,
after we had that conversation,

441
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,520
it was clear that the way that she was 
considering the experience had radically

442
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:17,354
shifted.
And it's very interesting because you 

443
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,470
know,
you think of the past as fixed but,

444
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,713
and it is in some sense,
but the reason you remember the past 

445
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:28,700
isn't to make an objectively accurate 
record of the past.

446
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:29,983
It's so that you can use the information
in the past to prepare you for the 

447
00:24:33,321 --> 00:24:37,100
future and your mind won't leave you 
alone unless that has happened.

448
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:37,934
So if you've encountered something 
that's negative and you don't know why 

449
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:44,570
and you don't know what to do about it,
if that happens again in the future,

450
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,613
then that will stay with you.
And I think one of the things that does 

451
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:49,004
too is it increases your overall 
physiological load is actually 

452
00:24:51,831 --> 00:24:53,870
physiologists who'd been talking about 
this.

453
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,393
I can't remember the damn phrase,
but you could imagine that your mind is 

454
00:24:58,011 --> 00:24:59,720
doing something like this all the time.
It's,

455
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,330
it's,
it's,

456
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,203
it's got a record in some sense of your 
autobiographical experiences and what 

457
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:07,214
it's doing is calculating how frequently
you've been successful versus 

458
00:25:10,581 --> 00:25:13,310
unsuccessful,
and the more frequently that you've been

459
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:14,144
successful,
the higher you are up on the dominance 

460
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:18,110
hierarchy.
That's one possibility.

461
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,480
So your serotonin levels go up and 
you're calmer,

462
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,040
but also it's reasonable to assume that 
the environment is less dangerous,

463
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:25,903
right?
Because that's sort of what constitutes 

464
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,573
danger.
You're somewhere in react and something 

465
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,710
you don't want to have happen happens.
That's danger.

466
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,903
And so your brain is always trying to 
figure out how to calibrate how anxious 

467
00:25:37,311 --> 00:25:38,144
you should be.
And one of the things that does is by 

468
00:25:39,741 --> 00:25:43,280
sort of keeping track of your past 
success failure ratio.

469
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,410
And so to the degree that your past has 
been characterized by,

470
00:25:48,411 --> 00:25:49,460
we'll call them failures.

471
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,220
Those are situations where you do not 
get what you want.

472
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:53,623
Then your body,
your brain puts your body on constant 

473
00:25:56,301 --> 00:26:00,590
alert because if everything that you've 
done has resulted in catastrophe,

474
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,663
then you're somewhere insanely dangerous
and you should be like like a like a 

475
00:26:05,361 --> 00:26:06,194
prey animal that's ready to dark in any 
direction and how much you should be a 

476
00:26:10,371 --> 00:26:13,190
prey and I'm always dependent on it's an
estimate,

477
00:26:13,191 --> 00:26:14,840
partly your trait,
neuroticism,

478
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:16,603
partly your,
your success as adjudicated by other 

479
00:26:18,681 --> 00:26:19,790
people,
right?

480
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:20,624
Because they'll talk pop you up the 
dominance hierarchy if you've been 

481
00:26:22,701 --> 00:26:23,534
successful,
but also partly on your record of 

482
00:26:25,371 --> 00:26:26,204
failures and successes in the past and 
so you can go back and you can find out 

483
00:26:29,871 --> 00:26:30,704
where you have holes in your,
in the structure through which you're 

484
00:26:33,411 --> 00:26:34,244
viewing the world.
That's one way of looking at it and you 

485
00:26:35,931 --> 00:26:38,430
can sell those things up and that's a 
very.

486
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,303
That's in some sense,
that's what you're doing in 

487
00:26:40,281 --> 00:26:41,500
psychotherapy.
You know,

488
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:45,570
partly it's exposure to things you're 
afraid of and disgusted by it are likely

489
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:47,430
to avoid.
That's a huge chunk of it,

490
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,570
but if you go back into your past and 
you start talking those things through,

491
00:26:51,571 --> 00:26:54,510
it's really the same thing.
It's more abstracted,

492
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,250
so Freud of course was always when he 
was doing his sprit association,

493
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,880
a process with his clients,
he'd find that if he just let them talk,

494
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:05,903
that their speech would circle until it 
hit a place like that where they were 

495
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:10,494
confused and doubtful and then their 
speech would sort of wander around that 

496
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,513
and and then they'd have an emotional 
expression that was a consequence of 

497
00:27:16,921 --> 00:27:17,754
that.
He thought the emotional expression was 

498
00:27:19,081 --> 00:27:21,900
what was curative.
It was cathartic in his terms,

499
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,033
but later James Pennebaker,
upon whom these writing exercises I 

500
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:29,850
described,
his research is based on that.

501
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:33,090
My re,
my exercises are based on his research.

502
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,380
He found that if you brought college 
students into the to the lab and you had

503
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:40,740
them write for 15 minutes,
three times over three days,

504
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,980
about the worst thing that had ever 
happened to them or the worst thing they

505
00:27:43,981 --> 00:27:45,660
ever did.
If I remember correctly,

506
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:48,870
they got worse in the short term,
but better in the long run.

507
00:27:48,871 --> 00:27:49,704
For example,
I went and visited the doctor less and 

508
00:27:51,661 --> 00:27:52,494
markers of their physical health 
improved and so I think the reason for 

509
00:27:55,861 --> 00:27:58,470
that is because,
what is that called?

510
00:27:58,471 --> 00:28:00,990
It's called something load.
Just devoted.

511
00:28:00,991 --> 00:28:03,930
Got It right from the physiologists.
It doesn't matter.

512
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,353
They got healthier as far as I can tell,
because they basically calmed down once 

513
00:28:10,531 --> 00:28:11,364
they had gone through the negative 
memory and sorted it out properly and 

514
00:28:14,161 --> 00:28:18,270
told a properly articulated story and 
figured out how to deal with it.

515
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:21,810
Then their physiology calmed down.
Um,

516
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:23,603
and so then they weren't as stressed.
They weren't producing as much cortisol 

517
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:30,210
and so cortisol suppresses your immune 
function and so they were more likely to

518
00:28:30,211 --> 00:28:31,044
stay healthy and so well.
So that's all very much we're thinking 

519
00:28:35,341 --> 00:28:36,174
about.
That's all in the domain outside of the 

520
00:28:37,321 --> 00:28:38,970
light.
That's one way of thinking about it.

521
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,223
Now,
of course,

522
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,560
Simba and his.
And what's the girl's name?

523
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,053
Milo.
Yeah.

524
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:46,043
They're pretty cowed about what has 
happened because they sort of stumbled 

525
00:28:49,051 --> 00:28:49,884
stupidly out into the unknown.
They stumbled foolishly out into the 

526
00:28:53,551 --> 00:28:57,180
unknown and this actually highlights 
another young Ian archetype,

527
00:28:57,181 --> 00:28:58,014
and that's the archetype of the 
trickster and the trickster is like the 

528
00:29:00,451 --> 00:29:04,860
joker in the king's court and the 
trickster is someone who will be or play

529
00:29:04,861 --> 00:29:07,350
the fool.
And the thing about the fool is that the

530
00:29:07,351 --> 00:29:08,184
full is close to the truth because you 
can't learn anything new unless you're 

531
00:29:10,861 --> 00:29:12,900
willing to be a fool,
right?

532
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,870
You know what that's like.
You,

533
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,730
you know exactly what that's like.
Your you have to master a new skill,

534
00:29:17,731 --> 00:29:18,564
but you're avoiding it because you know 
that you'll be bad at it when you first 

535
00:29:21,331 --> 00:29:23,160
do it,
and if you're perfectionistic,

536
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:23,994
you're gonna say,
well,

537
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,130
I cannot allow myself to be bad at 
anything.

538
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,160
I can't allow myself to be a fool and no
wonder,

539
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,380
but the problem is is when you try 
something new,

540
00:29:31,381 --> 00:29:32,214
you're always a fool,
and so unless you're willing to be a 

541
00:29:34,351 --> 00:29:36,090
fool,
you can't learn anything new,

542
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:37,043
and that's also why you regard the 
trickster as the precursor to the 

543
00:29:39,331 --> 00:29:40,164
savior.
Archetypically speaking is because you 

544
00:29:41,951 --> 00:29:42,784
cannot do the right thing unless you're 
willing to be a fool first and that's 

545
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:48,760
really worth knowing.
Lots of times you,

546
00:29:48,761 --> 00:29:51,670
you guys are gonna,
make a stage transition in your life and

547
00:29:51,671 --> 00:29:54,760
you're going to feel like an imposter 
when you get a new job or when you get a

548
00:29:54,761 --> 00:29:55,594
promotion or something like that,
you're going to feel like an imposter 

549
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:01,480
and you are because what do you know 
when you make that first transition,

550
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,433
right,
but it's gonna make you embarrassed and 

551
00:30:04,211 --> 00:30:07,120
it's gonna make you ashamed and all of 
those things,

552
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:10,960
but you have to understand that you are 
a fool when you first try something new,

553
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:15,820
but you're a worst fool if you don't try
it and that doesn't mean you should make

554
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:16,930
like you know everything.

555
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:20,200
As soon as you're promoted or or you 
have some transition in status,

556
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,410
that's foolish.
Have the wrong sort.

557
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:24,663
But to know that,
to know that you have to be fallible in 

558
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:30,790
order to progress,
it's an unbelievably useful thing.

559
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:32,580
It can free you up.
You know,

560
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:37,210
I was talking to a writer the other day 
about his process for beginning writing.

561
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:39,670
He's written many books.
He writes a very,

562
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,590
very,
very bad first draft.

563
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,383
Right?
And that's a good way to think about 

564
00:30:44,081 --> 00:30:44,914
things is throughout your life you're 
going to be doing that is writing the 

565
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:50,920
next draft of you and it's pretty bad to
begin with,

566
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,233
but that's okay because it isn't going 
to get any better unless you put 

567
00:30:54,911 --> 00:30:57,430
yourself out into the domain of the 
unknown to begin with.

568
00:30:57,431 --> 00:30:58,264
And you know,
you might,

569
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,190
you might,
it might go badly.

570
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,540
I mean that's what happens here.

571
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,213
Anyways,
mythos that has a chat with Simba and 

572
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,980
tells them that he's.
He did what he wasn't supposed to do.

573
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:13,340
Although,
you know,

574
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,613
even in that situation with FAA says,
discipline is paradoxical because 

575
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,940
there's part of him because he's 
reasonably.

576
00:31:21,941 --> 00:31:25,120
Why's that knows that breaking the rules
like that is actually necessary.

577
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:28,420
Even though you still have to say play 
by the damn rules,

578
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,580
you know,
you have to leave that door open so that

579
00:31:30,581 --> 00:31:33,220
the rules can be broken and appropriate 
amount.

580
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,940
So he forgives him and pieces made 
between them and then

581
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,793
they're there,
they involve themselves in sort of 

582
00:31:41,321 --> 00:31:42,154
gazing at the night sky,
and so the two of them do that together 

583
00:31:44,681 --> 00:31:46,480
and the night skies and interesting 
place,

584
00:31:46,481 --> 00:31:47,314
you know,
because that's where the absolute 

585
00:31:48,461 --> 00:31:49,294
unknown resides.
One of the things you wrote a lot about 

586
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,740
was astrology,
strangely enough slash astronomy and one

587
00:31:56,741 --> 00:31:58,240
of young's contentions.

588
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,073
This is a very interesting one,
was that because of the night sky was 

589
00:32:01,631 --> 00:32:02,464
completely unknown.
People could project their fantasies 

590
00:32:04,361 --> 00:32:07,840
into it and that's what they did with,
with astrology.

591
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,940
So astrology is this cumulative fantasy 
that's going on in that roughly speaking

592
00:32:12,941 --> 00:32:16,030
in the deep unconscious,
projected onto the sky.

593
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:19,510
And so if you analyze old astrological 
writings,

594
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:22,300
what you're really doing is analyzing 
old fantasies.

595
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,283
And because of that you could develop 
some insight into the structure of the 

596
00:32:25,181 --> 00:32:26,014
mind.
And so he did the same thing with 

597
00:32:27,881 --> 00:32:30,130
alchemy in his later writings,
which are very,

598
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:32,770
very difficult to understand,
but extremely worthwhile.

599
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,510
Okay.
So anyways,

600
00:32:34,511 --> 00:32:36,790
back to the,
to the hellish domain.

601
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:39,890
Now I told you that that domain,
that's of knowledge,

602
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:40,724
you could think about that as the 
underworld or you can think about it as 

603
00:32:42,381 --> 00:32:43,214
nature,
the negative element of nature in 

604
00:32:44,361 --> 00:32:45,194
particular,
and so I mentioned that one element of 

605
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:48,134
that is hellish and that's exactly what 
the movie explains next does exactly 

606
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:52,460
that.

607
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:57,460
We go back out to this domain that scar,
the adversary or the negative king.

608
00:32:57,581 --> 00:32:58,940
Now that's another way of looking at 
him.

609
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,530
This is his,
his,

610
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:05,540
the domain over which he rules and so
you can see them.

611
00:33:05,871 --> 00:33:06,704
They're surrounded in fire.
Same idea as the hyenas surrounded by 

612
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:12,560
fire earlier.
All this green fire and smoke,

613
00:33:12,561 --> 00:33:13,394
which I think is even worse,
and this is where the movie starts to 

614
00:33:17,001 --> 00:33:17,834
draw on essentially Nazi symbolism,
at least the symbolism of totalitarian 

615
00:33:22,821 --> 00:33:24,710
states and you know,
you think about,

616
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:25,933
you think about a totalitarian state,
you think about the Nazis and their 

617
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:28,964
goosestepping.
What's happening is that every single 

618
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,250
person in the military becomes an 
identical unit,

619
00:33:34,251 --> 00:33:35,030
right?
A unit.

620
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,863
They're all uniform and they're all in 
some sense imitating the the dictator 

621
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:41,114
and in an absolutely perfect way and so 
the dictator wants to impose strict 

622
00:33:45,321 --> 00:33:50,321
uniformity on the entire population 
that's order order and one of the things

623
00:33:50,901 --> 00:33:54,080
we've discovered that's really 
interesting is that

624
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,533
disgust sensitivity is associated with 
orderliness and that's associated with 

625
00:34:00,741 --> 00:34:01,574
conscientiousness and one of the things 
about Hitler was that he was very 

626
00:34:03,981 --> 00:34:08,020
disgust sensitive and a lot of his 
hatred for non Ariens,

627
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,830
so imagine inside the area and box.

628
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:10,663
It was all uniform outside.
It was all parasites and predators and 

629
00:34:13,731 --> 00:34:16,310
so and that was a manifestation of 
disgust,

630
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,680
not a fear.
It's a whole different thing.

631
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,600
And if you read Hitler's table talk,
which is a collection of his spontaneous

632
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:27,530
dinner speeches from 1939 to 1942.
It's a very interesting book.

633
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,633
You see that his metaphor for the area 
and race was a body of pure body on 

634
00:34:34,191 --> 00:34:35,024
assaulted by parasites are predators and
that he was trying to erect a border 

635
00:34:38,631 --> 00:34:39,464
around it to keep all of that away.
So it's an immunological discussed like 

636
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:43,814
metaphor and there's some recent work 
that was published in Plos one about 

637
00:34:47,121 --> 00:34:47,954
three years ago showing that brilliant 
study should have got much more 

638
00:34:51,261 --> 00:34:52,094
attention showing that if you went 
around and sampled political attitudes 

639
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:58,640
in different countries or even within 
the same country,

640
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:03,440
what you found was that the higher the 
prevalence of infectious diseases,

641
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,143
the higher the probability of 
totalitarian political attitudes at the 

642
00:35:07,671 --> 00:35:08,504
local level.

643
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,673
And you can imagine,
well what happens if there's infectious 

644
00:35:11,661 --> 00:35:13,820
diseases is you want to put borders 
around everything.

645
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:14,923
You don't want free movement between 
ideas or people because that's partly 

646
00:35:17,511 --> 00:35:18,344
how the disease spreads.
You're going to have much more strict 

647
00:35:21,201 --> 00:35:23,540
sexual rules,
for example,

648
00:35:23,541 --> 00:35:26,150
because that's a great way for diseases 
to be transmitted.

649
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:30,020
And before Hitler went on his rampage 
against the non Ariens,

650
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:30,973
he'd cleaned up all the factories.
Like he went in there and fumigated 

651
00:35:33,861 --> 00:35:34,694
them.
It was part of the law and he went on a 

652
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,970
public health campaign to get rid of 
tuberculosis.

653
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:41,070
And he got rid of the bugs in the 
factories as well.

654
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:44,580
He used Zyklon B,
that's an insecticide,

655
00:35:44,581 --> 00:35:47,430
and now it's the gas that he used in the
gas chambers eventually.

656
00:35:47,431 --> 00:35:48,264
So first it was the bugs and the rats 
and that it was people who were that it 

657
00:35:51,301 --> 00:35:52,134
was euthanasia.
That was the next move and forest you 

658
00:35:54,631 --> 00:35:58,590
euthanasia and the rationale for that 
was compassion,

659
00:35:58,591 --> 00:36:00,720
by the way,
just so you all know,

660
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:01,680
it's,
it's,

661
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,513
it's merciful to put these people who 
are burdened some to themselves and 

662
00:36:06,451 --> 00:36:10,200
their families around the state who are 
living second grade lives.

663
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:14,550
It's merciful to euthanize them,
and that was a huge campaign in Germany.

664
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:17,340
It was after that that the more racial

665
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:23,150
purifications began,
and so that's the disgusting.

666
00:36:23,151 --> 00:36:25,520
That's unbelievably important.
It's,

667
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,373
it's,
it's because lots of times people think 

668
00:36:28,611 --> 00:36:29,444
that conservatives are more anxiety 
sensitive than liberals and that's why 

669
00:36:31,971 --> 00:36:35,300
they're closed in terms of their ideas.
That doesn't look right.

670
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,193
First of all,
conservatives are less neurotic than 

671
00:36:37,491 --> 00:36:39,260
liberals,
although the effect isn't that big,

672
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,540
so it doesn't look and they actually 
are.

673
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:44,060
They score higher in measures of 
wellbeing.

674
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,240
The most unhappy people are liberal men 
by the way,

675
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,373
so

676
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:50,643
but you know,
people are often accused if they're 

677
00:36:51,821 --> 00:36:52,654
conservative,
of being fearful and that's why they 

678
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,280
suppress other people's viewpoints,
but that doesn't look right.

679
00:36:57,281 --> 00:37:01,300
It's low openness and high orderliness 
and that looks like it's associated with

680
00:37:01,301 --> 00:37:02,134
disgust and that looks like it's 
associated with something called the 

681
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:05,764
extended immune system,
which is the proclivity of people to to 

682
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:11,500
keep themselves away from potential 
sources of contamination.

683
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,753
It's really terrifying because one of 
the things people often said about 

684
00:37:15,101 --> 00:37:15,934
Germany was that it was a very civilized
country and yet it descended into 

685
00:37:19,871 --> 00:37:20,704
barbarity.
Conscientiousness is a very good 

686
00:37:23,141 --> 00:37:26,500
predictor of long term success and so 
you could say,

687
00:37:26,501 --> 00:37:29,920
well conscientious societies are more 
civilized,

688
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:33,400
but they're also more orderly and that 
makes them more disgust sensitive.

689
00:37:33,401 --> 00:37:34,234
And so what it might have easily might 
have easily been in Germany was that it 

690
00:37:37,211 --> 00:37:38,044
was an excess of civilization rather 
than its lack that produced exactly 

691
00:37:41,801 --> 00:37:44,980
these consequences and that's a far more
frightening proposition.

692
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:47,590
And one that's I believe,
much more likely to be true.

693
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:52,710
Hitler based four times a day and he was
also an admirer of willpower so he could

694
00:37:52,961 --> 00:37:55,360
stand like this for eight hours in the 
back of a car,

695
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,433
and the thing about conscientious people
is they're very willpower oriented and 

696
00:37:59,921 --> 00:38:04,540
so if you're unfortunate enough to be 
sick chronically in the house of someone

697
00:38:04,541 --> 00:38:07,060
who's conscientious,
especially if it's a mental illness,

698
00:38:07,061 --> 00:38:07,894
you're more likely to relapse because 
the conscientious person is going to be 

699
00:38:10,961 --> 00:38:12,520
judgmental and they're going to say to 
you,

700
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,930
if your schizophrenia,
they're gonna say,

701
00:38:13,931 --> 00:38:15,850
well,
if you just organize yourself and get up

702
00:38:15,851 --> 00:38:19,180
in the morning and try a little harder,
you could overcome this,

703
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,193
which is of course true,
except you can't because you're 

704
00:38:22,181 --> 00:38:23,014
schizophrenic and so the pressure put on
you by the anger and the contempt is 

705
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,750
going to increase the probability that 
you'll relapse.

706
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,950
So orderly.
People are very judgmental and you know,

707
00:38:32,951 --> 00:38:33,784
orderliness is a very highly with things
like anorexia and the anorexic is 

708
00:38:38,081 --> 00:38:38,914
basically someone who's so disgust 
sensitive that they become unable to 

709
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:42,964
tolerate their own body and they see it 
as a source of corruption and 

710
00:38:46,331 --> 00:38:48,850
imperfection,
which of course is exactly right.

711
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:53,500
It is and it's very difficult thing to 
maintain order around.

712
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:54,963
So anyways,
so what happens out here in this 

713
00:38:57,581 --> 00:38:58,414
terrible domain where scar rules is that
thing's turned into a totalitarian 

714
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:02,890
state,
you know,

715
00:39:02,891 --> 00:39:04,690
and he's,
he's presented here as,

716
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,020
as a Nazi,
like leader and see.

717
00:39:08,021 --> 00:39:10,900
There's another thing that's really 
interesting to see even deeper than this

718
00:39:10,901 --> 00:39:14,470
from a mythological perspective.
I don't know if I can even go into it.

719
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,570
Well,
not really.

720
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,200
I guess what I'll have to do is satisfy 
myself with this observation.

721
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,950
There's always been some antagonism,
for example,

722
00:39:23,951 --> 00:39:27,930
between the Catholic Church and 
rationalism and everyone knows that it's

723
00:39:27,931 --> 00:39:28,764
a very long standing antagonism that 
sort of runs its way through at least 

724
00:39:32,741 --> 00:39:37,741
the last thousand years or so of Western
civilization and the people who regarded

725
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,243
Catholics as antithetical to science,
take the Catholics to task for that in 

726
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:47,620
describing it as prejudicial and super 
superstitious and fair enough,

727
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,320
but there's something else going on 
there that's more important.

728
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,380
And that's the observation and this is 
at a deep level,

729
00:39:53,381 --> 00:39:57,700
again,
the observation that rationality has one

730
00:39:57,701 --> 00:39:59,770
big problem,
so it's,

731
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,930
it can easily become arrogant and 
believe in.

732
00:40:01,931 --> 00:40:02,764
It's own theories,
so if you're smart and you're going to 

733
00:40:05,521 --> 00:40:07,090
be some of you people who are like that 
too,

734
00:40:07,091 --> 00:40:08,920
some of you,
your primary,

735
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,053
the primary trait that distinguished you
from other people over the course of 

736
00:40:12,461 --> 00:40:13,294
your whole life was that you are more 
intelligent than most and you may have 

737
00:40:16,121 --> 00:40:20,920
staked your identity on that and and 
overvalue intelligence and rationality,

738
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:21,754
and the problem with that is that you 
make a theory of the world and then you 

739
00:40:24,581 --> 00:40:27,280
tend to assume that it's 100 percent 
correct.

740
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:28,323
That's the tendency to fall in love with
your own theories and that's what a 

741
00:40:30,551 --> 00:40:33,280
totalitarian does.
The totalitarian says,

742
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:36,870
here's the Damn theory and it's exactly 
right and you're gonna.

743
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,140
Act it out.
Exactly,

744
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:40,540
and if you don't,
well,

745
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:41,643
we've got some special treats in mind 
for you and one of the most terrible 

746
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:45,664
things that I encountered while reading 
about totalitarianism and this was even 

747
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:49,654
more true of the Soviet Union under it,
was that the true believers and they 

748
00:40:54,881 --> 00:40:55,780
were,
many of them

749
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:01,090
were in a terrible position because 
according to their own doctrine,

750
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,343
they're already involved in the process 
that was going to bring utopia to 

751
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:06,790
mankind.
The problems had already been solved,

752
00:41:06,791 --> 00:41:09,820
but many of them were still suffering 
terribly as individuals,

753
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:12,820
but if you're a totalitarian believer in
utopia,

754
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,880
your own suffering becomes heretical.
Right?

755
00:41:15,881 --> 00:41:19,690
Because your suffering is an indication 
that the damn theory isn't correct,

756
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,673
and so then you're in a terrible 
position because you either admit that 

757
00:41:22,901 --> 00:41:23,734
the theory isn't correct and fall apart 
because of that and maybe face terrible 

758
00:41:27,191 --> 00:41:28,240
punishment as well.

759
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:33,540
Or you have to separate yourself from 
your own suffering and lie about it.

760
00:41:33,681 --> 00:41:34,514
Fundamentally,
and of course that's exactly what 

761
00:41:35,541 --> 00:41:39,650
happened in places like the Soviet Union
where everyone lied about everything all

762
00:41:39,651 --> 00:41:41,330
of the time,
to themselves,

763
00:41:41,331 --> 00:41:43,760
to their family members,
to their friends.

764
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:44,863
The entire system was completely 
permeated by lies and so you get this 

765
00:41:49,401 --> 00:41:50,234
terrible place that scars the ruler over
which is totalitarian and brutal and 

766
00:41:55,761 --> 00:42:00,761
murderous and resentful and deceitful 
and arrogant all at the same time and

767
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:08,230
that's brought about so the columbine 
guys,

768
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:09,374
for example,
when they're justifying their 

769
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:14,420
murderousness and their plans to shoot 
up the schools,

770
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:19,160
they keep making reference to the fact 
that people had slighted them,

771
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,940
for example,
you know,

772
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,180
and insulted them and that they were 
alienated.

773
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,730
They weren't bullied exactly the way the
press made it out.

774
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:26,683
I don't know if they were bullied 
anymore than people usually are in high 

775
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:29,234
school,
but they took their alienation 

776
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:32,623
personally and regarded that their 
isolation from common humanity as 

777
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:39,590
indication of the pathology of 
everything,

778
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:40,933
and then they went out to destroy and 
that's exactly what this sort of thing 

779
00:42:43,971 --> 00:42:44,804
represents.

780
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:45,683
Now it's the uniformity and you see he's
got this kind of vicious grin on his 

781
00:42:49,941 --> 00:42:53,480
face which is malicious and pleased all 
at the same time.

782
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:56,450
There is no fear in that.
It's quite quite the opposite

783
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,760
and there's another image of using 
what's essentially imagery of hell,

784
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:04,190
which everyone understands strangely 
enough,

785
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:06,810
and that associates him with the 
crescent moon.

786
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,630
The crescent moon is.
Well,

787
00:43:08,631 --> 00:43:11,660
it's a symbol of darkness and the 
underworld fundamentally.

788
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,460
So.
Alright,

789
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:17,240
so anyways,
so that's we see the underworld,

790
00:43:17,241 --> 00:43:18,074
we see that which lies beyond the light.
And in there we see a fragment of that 

791
00:43:20,961 --> 00:43:24,410
that's basically hellish and all of 
that's incorporated into the story.

792
00:43:24,411 --> 00:43:28,040
And everyone understands that when they 
see it even without,

793
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:30,590
I would say the overt references to 
Nazi-ism okay,

794
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:31,424
so now scar has a plan.
He's going to kill the king and he's 

795
00:43:35,241 --> 00:43:39,890
going to do that by putting what the 
king loves in danger.

796
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:42,043
Scar feigning.
Sympathy has enticed Simba down into 

797
00:43:46,461 --> 00:43:51,461
this ravine and scars.
Minions are going to cause a willdabeast

798
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,210
stampede,
right?

799
00:43:53,211 --> 00:43:56,520
So a mindless stampede to,
to,

800
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:58,190
uh,
to put,

801
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,670
to put him in danger.
And so that's what happens here.

802
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:07,600
The old buddies start to march into the 
ravine and everyone is making a scar,

803
00:44:09,261 --> 00:44:14,261
tells Mufasa that Simba is down in that 
ravine and entices them down there.

804
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:15,403
And so they're all off running to see if
they can save Simba and then you see 

805
00:44:21,621 --> 00:44:23,450
mythos of running in front of the 
willdabeast,

806
00:44:23,451 --> 00:44:24,284
heard,
trying to,

807
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,720
trying to find a son and and trying to 
stay ahead of them.

808
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:30,920
The mad mob that's put his son in 
danger.

809
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,440
And so he tries to escape climbing up 
the Butte,

810
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:38,100
which is almost a sheer cliff and when 
it gets to the top,

811
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,073
his brother is waiting for him there and
he asks him to pull them up and scar 

812
00:44:44,881 --> 00:44:45,714
basically before he kills them,
indicates that he's betraying him and 

813
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:54,810
puts his claws into move us,
pause and throws them off the cliff.

814
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:57,780
And so that's that.
And it's a sad part of the story.

815
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:58,683
It's a part that's very hard on kids 
because the father has died and you 

816
00:45:02,581 --> 00:45:04,650
know,
it's a rare kid who won't cry about that

817
00:45:04,651 --> 00:45:09,420
scene in particular where you see Simba 
very upset and his father dying.

818
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:13,090
Now this is a hard part of the story to 
interpret and the.

819
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:13,943
I don't know if it's because of my lack 
of ability to interpreter because the 

820
00:45:16,231 --> 00:45:18,580
story takes a weird twist here.
But there,

821
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:19,493
there is this confusion in the story 
about whether symbols and innocent 

822
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:28,080
victim who set up for the murder of his 
father or whether he actually bears some

823
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,430
guilt for it,
you know,

824
00:45:29,431 --> 00:45:32,610
and he's broken some rules and that and 
and so on.

825
00:45:32,611 --> 00:45:36,150
So he's not exactly placed in the 
position of innocence,

826
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:39,450
but of course he's also been set up by 
scar in any case,

827
00:45:39,451 --> 00:45:41,970
scar tells him that it's his fault,
pure and pure,

828
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,760
and that because of that,
he's going to have to leave.

829
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:47,520
He's going to have to be banished beyond
the kingdom.

830
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:48,413
Now

831
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:54,123
you see this motif quite quite 
frequently and hero stories where the 

832
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:01,330
hero has to be raised outside of the 
kingdom.

833
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:04,120
That happens with King Arthur for 
example,

834
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,313
and it happens with Harry Potter because
Harry Potter is raised by muggles 

835
00:46:08,531 --> 00:46:10,900
instead of being inside the magic 
kingdom.

836
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:11,973
So it's a very common theme.
And partly what it means is that it 

837
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:15,604
means two things.
One is that you do grow up alienated 

838
00:46:18,131 --> 00:46:18,964
from your culture to some degree.
There's no way around that because the 

839
00:46:21,791 --> 00:46:25,810
culture doesn't match you perfectly and 
it doesn't work for you perfectly.

840
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:26,823
And it's old and it's kind of corrupt 
and it alienates you as it's shaping 

841
00:46:29,981 --> 00:46:30,814
you,
and so you're going to develop some 

842
00:46:31,781 --> 00:46:32,614
separation from it.
And you see that in intergenerational 

843
00:46:36,071 --> 00:46:36,881
rhetoric.
You know,

844
00:46:36,881 --> 00:46:37,714
where the new generation has the 
proclivity to blame the previous 

845
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:42,790
generation for everything that's wrong 
with the current system.

846
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,160
And Fair enough,
you know,

847
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:47,290
because you do inherit everything that's
wrong.

848
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:49,690
Of course you also inherit everything 
that's going well,

849
00:46:49,691 --> 00:46:50,524
which is a good thing to also notice,
but the idea is that you can't help but 

850
00:46:54,701 --> 00:46:58,170
be alienated from,
let's call it the patriarchy for,

851
00:46:58,260 --> 00:46:59,093
for lack of a better word because it's 
got a tyrannical element and because 

852
00:47:02,501 --> 00:47:04,570
it's not matched well to you.
So,

853
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:08,410
but then there's also this other issue 
which is,

854
00:47:08,411 --> 00:47:12,160
well,
maybe you're not being successful by the

855
00:47:12,161 --> 00:47:16,090
terms that are by the values that are 
instantiated in the current system.

856
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:17,561
And you might say,
well,

857
00:47:17,561 --> 00:47:21,400
that's because the system is set up in 
an unfair manner and fair enough,

858
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:22,533
but it's also possibly because you're 
just not very good at acting out those 

859
00:47:25,181 --> 00:47:26,500
values.
Right?

860
00:47:26,501 --> 00:47:27,334
So part of the reason you get alienated 
from your culture is because culture is 

861
00:47:29,711 --> 00:47:30,490
corrupt,

862
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:34,060
but another part of the reason is you're
just not doing as well as you could be.

863
00:47:34,330 --> 00:47:35,163
You're not playing by the rules,
even your own rules properly and so you 

864
00:47:37,871 --> 00:47:42,190
get alienated and you're unsuccessful 
because of your own inadequacies.

865
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:46,840
And so the movie plays both of those.
It's obviously Simba is set up,

866
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:50,440
but there is an intimation that he's not
entirely blameless as well.

867
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:52,083
Anyways,
he's very broken up about this and no 

868
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:54,874
wonder it's also partly a story of the 
emergence of adolescence because you 

869
00:47:59,351 --> 00:48:00,184
know when you're a child and you're 
ensconced right inside the familial 

870
00:48:03,191 --> 00:48:04,024
framework,
then you sort of exist within that 

871
00:48:06,191 --> 00:48:09,280
system of rules like you would under the
psg Eddie and scheme,

872
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,353
but when you become an adolescent,
then there's much more of a proclivity 

873
00:48:13,661 --> 00:48:14,494
to break free and to start breaking 
rules and so that's also a canyon in 

874
00:48:18,131 --> 00:48:23,131
some sense to the death of the father 
and as a necessary developmental stage.

875
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:27,400
Anyway,
scar comes down into the ravine.

876
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:28,263
It's all foggy now because that goes 
along with sort of murkiness of death 

877
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:36,450
and tells Simba that it's his fault and 
that he's going to have to leave.

878
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,910
He's going to have to leave the kingdom 
of his father,

879
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:41,770
which makes sense.
Now his father is dead.

880
00:48:41,771 --> 00:48:44,470
So how are you gonna?
Once your father has died,

881
00:48:44,471 --> 00:48:47,650
how are you going to stay around in his 
kingdom so to speak?

882
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:49,143
So and then scar tries to get these 
hyenas to go track him down and kill 

883
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:55,210
them.
So

884
00:48:57,070 --> 00:49:00,780
and Zuzu goes back to tell all the rest 
of the lions that move.

885
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:01,511
Faa says,
Dad,

886
00:49:01,511 --> 00:49:06,511
in that Simba has disappeared and then 
scar takes over pride rock.

887
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,633
And so what's happened now is the 
malevolent element of the king has 

888
00:49:13,511 --> 00:49:16,210
obtained control over the state,
right?

889
00:49:16,211 --> 00:49:19,360
And so this is the king.

890
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:21,430
The wise king wasn't paying enough 
attention.

891
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:22,743
That's one way of looking at it.
And so the malevolent part of the state 

892
00:49:25,271 --> 00:49:27,160
has now got control.
This is a very,

893
00:49:27,161 --> 00:49:27,994
very old idea.
I've traced it back at least several 

894
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:34,570
thousand years in its,
in its representation in stories.

895
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:36,910
You can see it in Egyptian mythology,
for example,

896
00:49:36,911 --> 00:49:40,960
so the idea is that as the social 
structure builds and complexity,

897
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:44,200
it offers you the protection of a 
functioning complex system,

898
00:49:44,201 --> 00:49:45,034
but it also becomes increasingly likely 
to turn into a tyranny and because it's 

899
00:49:49,211 --> 00:49:50,044
more and more powerful,
the fact of its potential for tyranny 

900
00:49:51,971 --> 00:49:55,180
becomes more and more of a danger.
And so then the question is,

901
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:56,343
well,
what are the factors that encourages it 

902
00:49:59,081 --> 00:49:59,914
turning into a tyranny?
And one factor would be the wisest part 

903
00:50:03,221 --> 00:50:06,820
of it is not paying enough attention to 
the malevolent part of it.

904
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,193
And you could say that's true at the 
state level and it's also true at the 

905
00:50:10,511 --> 00:50:11,650
individual level,
right?

906
00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:12,483
You have to watch your own proclivity to
upset yourself and other people and and 

907
00:50:16,601 --> 00:50:20,410
take that into account and pay careful 
attention to it because otherwise it can

908
00:50:20,411 --> 00:50:23,260
gain control,
especially because you're going to avoid

909
00:50:23,261 --> 00:50:24,094
looking at it.
And one of the characteristics of the 

910
00:50:27,651 --> 00:50:28,484
wise king who gets overthrown by the 
tyrant is that he has an evil brother 

911
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:33,290
and he won't pay enough attention to 
him.

912
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,810
He avoids,
he doesn't look.

913
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,093
And so the,
the evil king gets the upper hand and 

914
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:42,020
that's what's happened here.
And so notice now he takes possession of

915
00:50:42,021 --> 00:50:44,480
pride rock,
not in full daylight,

916
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:45,920
right?
But at night.

917
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,353
So that ties his rule into the rule of 
unconscious processes in and 

918
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:53,700
malevolence.
Alright?

919
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:57,440
So Simba runs away from the kingdom out 
into the desert.

920
00:50:58,250 --> 00:50:59,660
Now why is that?
Well,

921
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,180
you remember,
maybe you remember and maybe you don't.

922
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:04,190
Maybe you don't know what the story of 
exodus.

923
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:06,170
When Moses takes the Hebrews out of 
Egypt,

924
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:08,600
they end up in a desert.
Well,

925
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:09,770
why?
Well,

926
00:51:09,771 --> 00:51:13,910
it's because when you leave a kingdom,
no matter how tyrannical,

927
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:18,500
you still fall into disorder,
you're in a place that's desert.

928
00:51:18,501 --> 00:51:20,340
There's no civilization there.
No,

929
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,990
that's what happened to Iraq.
After the Americans went in,

930
00:51:23,991 --> 00:51:24,411
you know,
the,

931
00:51:24,411 --> 00:51:25,244
the Americans,
the neocons were all convinced that the 

932
00:51:27,241 --> 00:51:28,074
Iraqis would welcome them with open arms
and there would be this smooth 

933
00:51:30,411 --> 00:51:33,140
transition to democracy.
Same idea in Libya.

934
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,610
It's like,
no,

935
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:35,743
that's not what happens.
What happens is the state devolves into 

936
00:51:38,421 --> 00:51:42,140
a desert chaos and maybe then you can 
make order,

937
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:42,974
but probably not.
And so Simba has left the kingdom and 

938
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:48,950
the first thing that happens is he damn 
near dies in the desert.

939
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:50,263
And so you know,
if you have an old belief system and 

940
00:51:52,911 --> 00:51:55,400
it's not working very well and you 
abandon it,

941
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:56,413
well,
good for you because you're out of the 

942
00:51:57,741 --> 00:51:59,720
old belief system,
but now you're nowhere.

943
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:02,120
One of the things that happens to 
alcoholics,

944
00:52:02,121 --> 00:52:02,954
for example,
and and draw draw other drug addicts as 

945
00:52:05,001 --> 00:52:06,620
well.
So imagine that

946
00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:10,940
you're trying to stop drinking.
All right,

947
00:52:10,941 --> 00:52:11,774
fine.
Maybe you have to undergo some medical 

948
00:52:13,731 --> 00:52:14,564
treatment so when you first stopped,
you don't die of seizures because that 

949
00:52:17,511 --> 00:52:19,730
often happens to people who are addicted
to alcohol.

950
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:20,983
So when they get valium or something 
like that from a doctor to see them 

951
00:52:23,601 --> 00:52:28,310
through the first bits of
what would you call it?

952
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:33,311
A while of sobering up and so they get 
through it and then then maybe two weeks

953
00:52:33,321 --> 00:52:35,780
later,
they're not physiologically dependent on

954
00:52:35,781 --> 00:52:39,320
alcohol anymore.
Same thing is true of cocaine.

955
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:43,130
But if you take them back and you put 
them in their environment,

956
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,080
say they go back out to the treatment 
center,

957
00:52:45,170 --> 00:52:46,003
back into the normal world,
they start drinking or using right away 

958
00:52:48,651 --> 00:52:50,210
again.
And the reason for that is that,

959
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,373
well,
let's say you've been an alcoholic for 

960
00:52:52,071 --> 00:52:53,600
20 years.
Okay?

961
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:57,530
First of all,
that's all you do for entertainment.

962
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:01,610
You drink,
all your friends are alcoholics,

963
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:03,200
right?
And so

964
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:10,110
if you're going to stop drinking,
not only do you have to

965
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,470
rid yourself of the,

966
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:18,533
of the physiological addiction,
but you have to completely learn a new 

967
00:53:21,061 --> 00:53:21,894
way of living because what do you know?
You have to get rid of all your friends 

968
00:53:24,691 --> 00:53:27,360
because they're drunks pretty much.
Or if they're not there,

969
00:53:27,361 --> 00:53:29,370
at least people who are facilitating 
your drinking.

970
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,350
So you have to build a whole new social 
network.

971
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:32,423
You don't know how to amuse yourself 
because of course the way you've done 

972
00:53:34,741 --> 00:53:37,050
that is by going to the bar or sitting 
at home drinking.

973
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:38,093
And so there's a huge hole in your life.
You abandoned the previous pathological 

974
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:45,270
mode of adaptation,
but that just leaves you with nothing.

975
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:47,910
And then you have to rebuild that thing 
from,

976
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:48,830
from,
from,

977
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:51,330
from scratch.
It's extraordinarily difficult.

978
00:53:51,331 --> 00:53:52,164
And that's why so many people fail when 
they're trying to overcome a major 

979
00:53:54,001 --> 00:53:55,440
addiction.
So.

980
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,600
Alright.
So anyways,

981
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:02,160
symbols out there in the desert.
He's left his family and the comforts of

982
00:54:02,161 --> 00:54:07,161
home and he's,
he's discovered by these by Puma and who

983
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:12,570
a little rats name to tymone yes,
he's a mere cat,

984
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:12,870
right?

985
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:13,703
Which are very cool things
and they discover them and this is sort 

986
00:54:17,041 --> 00:54:19,500
of his transition into adolescence and 
he,

987
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:21,210
he kind of finds,
and this is,

988
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,133
I would say more typical of the male 
transition into adolescence because 

989
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:27,690
females of course hit puberty so much 
younger.

990
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:28,763
The males who aren't very attractive 
when they're young and just starting to 

991
00:54:32,611 --> 00:54:35,340
undergo puberty that are very attractive
to females.

992
00:54:35,341 --> 00:54:37,890
They tend to clump together in gangs 
and,

993
00:54:37,930 --> 00:54:38,763
and,
and manage the transition over what 

994
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:43,320
could be seven years.
So,

995
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,930
and that's what happens here is Simba 
joins this little gang of,

996
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:47,790
you know,
these guys are all right,

997
00:54:47,791 --> 00:54:48,624
but you know,
they're a little on the primordial side 

998
00:54:51,211 --> 00:54:52,680
you might say,
you know,

999
00:54:52,681 --> 00:54:57,210
one of them is basically just a walking 
gastrointestinal tract and the other one

1000
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:58,290
is,
he's not so bad,

1001
00:54:58,291 --> 00:55:00,150
but he's like a foot high.
Really.

1002
00:55:00,151 --> 00:55:00,810
What good is he?

1003
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:03,780
And so he,
he's got some second rate companions out

1004
00:55:03,781 --> 00:55:05,640
here past the desert,
but he enters,

1005
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,830
he's out of childhood now and now he 
enters the adolescent world.

1006
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:11,670
What happens here is that very quickly 
in the film,

1007
00:55:11,671 --> 00:55:14,730
he goes from being a little cub to a 
full full adolescents.

1008
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:16,133
There's about a five minute transition 
and so it's the next stage in his 

1009
00:55:18,511 --> 00:55:21,630
development and now he's out there in 
this paradise,

1010
00:55:21,631 --> 00:55:23,820
which is kind of strange because 
adolescence really is no,

1011
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:24,823
no picnic.
But the idea here is that he really 

1012
00:55:26,701 --> 00:55:28,970
doesn't have any responsibilities,
right?

1013
00:55:28,980 --> 00:55:29,813
None.
And that is one thing about adolescence 

1014
00:55:31,981 --> 00:55:34,110
is,
and even the stage of life that you guys

1015
00:55:34,111 --> 00:55:34,944
are at is you have lots to do,
but you're not really responsible for 

1016
00:55:37,741 --> 00:55:38,574
anyone other than yourself.
And so even though you might be quite 

1017
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:43,380
burdened with your current 
responsibilities,

1018
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:45,023
it's nothing compared to what it would 
be like when you know you have 

1019
00:55:47,281 --> 00:55:49,830
responsibility for,
for children for example,

1020
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:52,890
or for the people that are working for 
you or or whatever.

1021
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:54,023
So anyways,
out here it's a kind of impulsive place 

1022
00:55:56,901 --> 00:55:59,040
as well.
And adolescents is like that.

1023
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:03,690
We've had high school students try to do
the future authoring program,

1024
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:04,643
you know,
where they have to think three to five 

1025
00:56:05,281 --> 00:56:09,150
years down the road.
It's like forget that they just can't do

1026
00:56:09,151 --> 00:56:10,260
it.
And I've watched them.

1027
00:56:10,261 --> 00:56:11,094
And what happens is you immediately 
become aware of just how little high 

1028
00:56:13,771 --> 00:56:16,110
school students know when they're like 
15 or 16,

1029
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:18,240
three to five years,
forget it.

1030
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,433
They don't have the world knowledge to 
project themselves out that far in the 

1031
00:56:21,721 --> 00:56:23,070
future,
not even close.

1032
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:27,160
So we've built a high school version 
that helps them design a better future.

1033
00:56:27,161 --> 00:56:29,950
Three to six months down the road and 
even that's really pushing it,

1034
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,784
but you know adolescents are more 
impulsive and they live more for the 

1035
00:56:33,251 --> 00:56:38,230
moment and
there's some utility anatomy.

1036
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:39,363
Being impulsive and living for the 
moment is one of the things that gets 

1037
00:56:41,261 --> 00:56:42,094
you pregnant as a teenager and that is 
certainly one way that the species has 

1038
00:56:44,921 --> 00:56:45,754
managed to propagate itself and so 
positive emotion and impulsivity are 

1039
00:56:50,201 --> 00:56:51,034
very tightly linked and so he's out 
there in this adolescent delusional 

1040
00:56:56,501 --> 00:56:58,720
fantasy that might be one way of 
thinking about it,

1041
00:56:58,721 --> 00:56:59,554
but more important he's out there where 
he's in a domain now where the impulses 

1042
00:57:03,371 --> 00:57:04,204
of the moment basically take precedence 
and so and I think they sing some song 

1043
00:57:10,091 --> 00:57:12,890
about,
yeah,

1044
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,710
Hakuna Matata,
right?

1045
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:17,380
Which basically means do whatever,
do whatever you want,

1046
00:57:17,381 --> 00:57:19,810
and tomorrow will take care of itself or
something like that.

1047
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:23,440
So it's very impulsive and lacks all 
responsibility.

1048
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,113
One of the things that I would recommend
to you if you want to protect yourself 

1049
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:30,790
from ideological possession,
shall we say,

1050
00:57:30,791 --> 00:57:31,624
is that when you hear people speak 
politically and they don't say anything 

1051
00:57:34,991 --> 00:57:35,824
about your responsibilities,
you should probably stop listening to 

1052
00:57:37,841 --> 00:57:41,470
them because whenever they're trying to 
offer you something,

1053
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,780
if it doesn't come along with an 
equivalent cost,

1054
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:44,763
there's something being hidden from you 
and they're appealing to the part of 

1055
00:57:47,411 --> 00:57:48,244
you.
That's what I would say at best 

1056
00:57:49,481 --> 00:57:51,100
adolescent.
So.

1057
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:52,450
Alright,
so anyways,

1058
00:57:52,451 --> 00:57:55,390
he's out there in his little adolescent 
paradise and,

1059
00:57:55,391 --> 00:57:58,960
uh,
with his dopey chums and back at,

1060
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,080
at pride rock.
Things are not good,

1061
00:58:02,081 --> 00:58:03,400
right?
Scar,

1062
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:04,623
who's arrogant and refuses to learn and 
who will not establish a reasonable 

1063
00:58:10,691 --> 00:58:12,070
relationship with the females.

1064
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:12,903
All he does is tyrannized over them.
He ends up ruling over a completely 

1065
00:58:16,151 --> 00:58:16,984
barren landscape.
And that's really what happens in 

1066
00:58:18,641 --> 00:58:21,550
totalitarian states.
And we also know quite interestingly,

1067
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:22,713
is that one of the best predictors of 
economic development in estate is the 

1068
00:58:26,321 --> 00:58:28,420
degree to which they extend rights to 
women.

1069
00:58:28,690 --> 00:58:31,390
It's one of the best predictors.
And I would say,

1070
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:32,643
well,
if you're going to tear nine your own 

1071
00:58:33,221 --> 00:58:34,870
women,
you're going to terrorize everything.

1072
00:58:34,871 --> 00:58:35,704
You're going to tear tyrannized ideas,
you're going to tear a nice structures 

1073
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:40,300
like if you have to enslave your own 
women,

1074
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:41,803
you're.
You've adapted a pretty damn 

1075
00:58:43,601 --> 00:58:47,110
pathological view of the world and the 
probability that that narrow,

1076
00:58:47,111 --> 00:58:50,170
constrained,
restricted viewpoint is going to pay off

1077
00:58:50,171 --> 00:58:52,330
for you economically is extraordinarily 
low.

1078
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,770
So anyways,
scar.

1079
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,870
It's like what happened in the Soviet 
Union to know.

1080
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,704
Part of the reason it collapsed by 1989 
is that it just could not move any 

1081
00:59:01,481 --> 00:59:02,314
farther.

1082
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,153
It was like this really complicated 
motor that was worn completely out that 

1083
00:59:06,671 --> 00:59:10,420
no one had ever taken care of and it 
just ground to a halt.

1084
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:13,780
It just stopped working because it 
because it didn't work.

1085
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:19,260
And so if you're a totalitarian and you 
won't update your system and adjusted,

1086
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:23,960
then it wears out and grinds a halt and 
everything becomes unproductive.

1087
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:25,423
Now,
it's not easy to figure out what makes 

1088
00:59:27,141 --> 00:59:29,120
us society productive because you might 
say,

1089
00:59:29,121 --> 00:59:31,070
well,
it's natural resources or something like

1090
00:59:31,071 --> 00:59:32,090
that.
First of all,

1091
00:59:32,450 --> 00:59:33,283
natural resources are very often a curse
to a country because they produce 

1092
00:59:36,651 --> 00:59:39,140
corruption.
They call that the Dutch disease.

1093
00:59:39,350 --> 00:59:41,750
There's a reason for that.
You can look it up,

1094
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:46,520
but natural resources in and of 
themselves are by no means sufficient to

1095
00:59:46,521 --> 00:59:50,510
guarantee the wellbeing of a country.
Japan has virtually no natural resources

1096
00:59:50,511 --> 00:59:51,344
at all and it's really rich and one of 
the prime natural resources actually 

1097
00:59:55,671 --> 00:59:56,000
seems.

1098
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,290
Maybe there's two.
One is honesty and other is trust and if

1099
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:03,050
you can set up a society where people 
are roughly honest,

1100
01:00:03,051 --> 01:00:03,884
which means they do what they say 
they're going to do and where the 

1101
01:00:05,451 --> 01:00:09,980
default bargaining position on both 
sides is trust,

1102
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:13,130
then the probability that that culture 
will become wealthy is very,

1103
01:00:13,131 --> 01:00:14,540
very high.
So,

1104
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:19,340
and a functional legal system is also a 
natural resource of tremendous,

1105
01:00:19,341 --> 01:00:21,050
tremendous value.
You know,

1106
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:23,960
it's partly why people in China,
for example,

1107
01:00:23,961 --> 01:00:24,794
wealthy people in China are dumping 
their money into the real estate market 

1108
01:00:27,181 --> 01:00:28,014
in North America like mad because one of
the things you do know if you buy real 

1109
01:00:31,041 --> 01:00:33,350
estate in North America,
as you actually own it,

1110
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:36,140
it's still going to be years,
20 years in the future,

1111
01:00:36,141 --> 01:00:38,720
30 years in the future.
There's no doubt about that.

1112
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:42,710
And so that fact of ownership is 
embedded in the functioning legal system

1113
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:45,950
and that's what gives those sorts of 
properties crazy value,

1114
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:52,180
much too much to the problematic 
situation for all of you people who are.

1115
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:54,253
At some point,
most of you are going to try to buy 

1116
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:58,040
property in Toronto and that's really 
going to be entertaining.

1117
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:01,340
So now look the the other thing about 
scars,

1118
01:01:01,341 --> 01:01:03,770
he's got the little Burg locked up,
right?

1119
01:01:03,771 --> 01:01:05,270
That's the vision of the king.
Well,

1120
01:01:05,271 --> 01:01:07,430
he doesn't want to know anything.
He already knows everything.

1121
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:08,613
So why does he need this stupid bird 
flying around telling them what's going 

1122
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:11,624
on?
The last thing he wants to know is 

1123
01:01:12,741 --> 01:01:16,640
what's going on a stolen.
I mean,

1124
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:17,953
God,
you gave that guy bad news or good news 

1125
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,593
he was going to have you killed.
It kept the bad news to a minimum and 

1126
01:01:24,111 --> 01:01:25,250
that's a real problem,
right?

1127
01:01:25,251 --> 01:01:27,980
Because if you torture people who bring 
you bad news,

1128
01:01:27,981 --> 01:01:30,710
then you're never going to learn 
anything while you don't have to,

1129
01:01:30,711 --> 01:01:34,070
if you already knew everything anyways.
And so that's the situation here.

1130
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:37,490
Well,
his little minions,

1131
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:40,850
the hyenas are getting pretty unhappy 
because they haven't had anything to eat

1132
01:01:40,851 --> 01:01:44,540
and the reason for that is they've just 
stripped the landscape bear,

1133
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:45,793
right?
I mean,

1134
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:47,083
I read at the demise of the Soviet Union
that something like 10 to 15 percent of 

1135
01:01:50,691 --> 01:01:51,524
the entire land mass of the Soviet Union
had been rendered permanently 

1136
01:01:54,561 --> 01:01:58,690
uninhabitable by industrial pollution.
So that,

1137
01:01:58,970 --> 01:02:01,040
I don't remember if that included 
Chernobyl,

1138
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:03,260
where that terrible nuclear accident 
took place,

1139
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:04,094
but,
but there were massive domains of 

1140
01:02:06,411 --> 01:02:10,760
devastation and in those countries that 
will take hundreds of years to fix.

1141
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:13,820
So anyways,
when scar rules,

1142
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:14,983
everyone starves.
That's a good way of thinking about it 

1143
01:02:16,791 --> 01:02:17,624
or everyone dies,
but that's okay because that's really 

1144
01:02:18,771 --> 01:02:21,420
what he's after anyway.
So that works out quite nicely.

1145
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:23,550
Now,
back out here in paradise.

1146
01:02:23,551 --> 01:02:24,211
I mean,
look at him.

1147
01:02:24,211 --> 01:02:25,044
How pathetic can you get?
Look at the expression on that 

1148
01:02:27,031 --> 01:02:28,560
creature's face.
You know,

1149
01:02:28,561 --> 01:02:29,710
he's,
he's self's,

1150
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,833
he's sated like someone who's just eat a
gallon of ice cream and he's got this 

1151
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:38,930
pathetic
self satisfied,

1152
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:39,860
naive,

1153
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:42,493
clueless unconscious grin on his face,
which the animators did a very nice job 

1154
01:02:45,831 --> 01:02:48,620
of capturing,
like that's a complicated expression and

1155
01:02:48,621 --> 01:02:51,740
you just want to slap them and that's 
exactly what should happen.

1156
01:02:51,741 --> 01:02:54,200
And that's exactly what does happen.
So anyways,

1157
01:02:54,201 --> 01:02:56,360
he's out there,
be an unconscious Dingbat.

1158
01:02:56,361 --> 01:02:57,194
Well his society is degenerating and 
that's bloody well we're thinking about 

1159
01:03:00,441 --> 01:03:02,390
because that's an archetypal trope,
right?

1160
01:03:02,391 --> 01:03:05,600
It's like things are sinking around you.
The question is,

1161
01:03:05,601 --> 01:03:07,340
what are you doing about it?
You know,

1162
01:03:07,341 --> 01:03:11,540
are you just staying in kind of a blithe
unconsciousness because you can get your

1163
01:03:11,541 --> 01:03:12,374
next meal.
Are you going to wake up and do 

1164
01:03:13,161 --> 01:03:14,600
something about it?
Well,

1165
01:03:14,601 --> 01:03:18,800
that's the call of the self.
So now we go back to two Rafiki here and

1166
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:22,460
he knows what's going on in the kingdom.
He's a symbol of the self.

1167
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:25,670
And he also has some inkling that Simba 
is still alive,

1168
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:30,020
so,
so the son of the king is still alive,

1169
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:31,790
despite the fact that the,
the,

1170
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:35,990
the land has become ruled by a tyrant 
and the sun is absent.

1171
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:36,913
He still around somehow.
And so in a union from the union 

1172
01:03:39,651 --> 01:03:43,850
perspective,
there isn't much distinction between the

1173
01:03:43,851 --> 01:03:44,684
self and the and the and the child.
The self is the sum total of all 

1174
01:03:48,411 --> 01:03:51,350
possibility and the child is possibility
itself.

1175
01:03:51,351 --> 01:03:52,184
And so,
so let's say you've become an 

1176
01:03:54,351 --> 01:03:55,850
adolescent,
you're all cynical,

1177
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:57,313
right?
And everything's falling apart around 

1178
01:03:58,461 --> 01:03:59,294
you,
which is the typical state of human 

1179
01:04:01,431 --> 01:04:02,091
beings,
right?

1180
01:04:02,091 --> 01:04:02,924
Because adolescents are cynical,
generally speaking and everything's 

1181
01:04:05,001 --> 01:04:05,834
falling around,
falling apart around them generally 

1182
01:04:07,491 --> 01:04:08,324
speaking.
And so what do you have to do in order 

1183
01:04:10,371 --> 01:04:12,590
to do something about that?
Well,

1184
01:04:12,591 --> 01:04:16,130
one is you have to be drawn by the call 
of wisdom.

1185
01:04:16,131 --> 01:04:19,310
And the other part is that you have to 
rediscover that part of yourself.

1186
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:20,353
That's a child like part that's 
associated with the sun and associated 

1187
01:04:24,051 --> 01:04:24,884
with that early,
the early exposure of similar to the 

1188
01:04:26,871 --> 01:04:27,050
sun.

1189
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:27,883
You have to find that again.
And then trust that some child like 

1190
01:04:31,551 --> 01:04:32,384
exploration and a bit of manifestation 
of faith might get you to the next 

1191
01:04:35,391 --> 01:04:37,670
place.
And so that's what's happening here with

1192
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,460
the little,
you know,

1193
01:04:39,470 --> 01:04:41,600
the baboons in the tree and the,
and the drawing.

1194
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:42,553
So anyways,
he knows that Sim was alive now and so 

1195
01:04:44,691 --> 01:04:47,420
he goes off to find them and meanwhile 
sinbad,

1196
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:50,360
his dopey companions are out hunting for
bugs,

1197
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,470
you know,
because he's a lion,

1198
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:53,323
you know,
we shouldn't eat bugs for crying out 

1199
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:57,890
loud but they are easy.
And so you see the scene where Puma goes

1200
01:04:57,891 --> 01:05:01,970
after this bug and then another lion 
shows up and chases him.

1201
01:05:01,971 --> 01:05:03,830
So she's going to kill them and eat 
them.

1202
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:05,203
And See.
That's an interesting thing because one 

1203
01:05:08,511 --> 01:05:12,080
of the things that happens,
I suppose you could think about this,

1204
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:13,603
one of the things that happens in late 
adolescence is that the formation of 

1205
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:18,243
gangs is often broken up by the 
proclivity of one or more members of 

1206
01:05:22,301 --> 01:05:25,750
that gang to get involved in an 
individual romantic relationship.

1207
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:26,823
And so the idea that the female lion is 
the carnivore female is the carnivore 

1208
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:35,500
that will devour the group is exactly 
right.

1209
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:36,573
And so what a girl will do often if 
she's in a relationship with somebody 

1210
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:43,343
like a young man or an older adolescent,
is she'll try to separate him from his 

1211
01:05:46,061 --> 01:05:48,100
dopey friends and like,
no wonder,

1212
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:49,420
you know,
why wouldn't she do that?

1213
01:05:49,421 --> 01:05:50,254
Because he does have top friends and 
it'd be better for him if he could get 

1214
01:05:53,051 --> 01:05:55,360
beyond them.
And so anyways,

1215
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:56,223
they're pretty freaked out about this.
And so then Simba goes out and has a 

1216
01:05:59,381 --> 01:06:00,214
fight with this lion to protect his 
dopey chums and I'm sure you don't need 

1217
01:06:03,731 --> 01:06:04,564
any explanation about what that means.
And they have this huge fight and Nalla 

1218
01:06:09,820 --> 01:06:10,653
who it turns out to be Pinza.
And so that goes back to the beginning 

1219
01:06:13,961 --> 01:06:16,000
of the story where when he first 
encountered her,

1220
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:17,290
she pinned them all the time.

1221
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,750
She's an anima figure,
right?

1222
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:23,140
And now what she does immediately is 
shame him.

1223
01:06:23,770 --> 01:06:25,630
So he's an figure,
in part,

1224
01:06:25,631 --> 01:06:28,480
she's an anima figure in part because 
she actually does shame him,

1225
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:29,853
right?
So she's the gateway to higher 

1226
01:06:31,211 --> 01:06:33,790
consciousness,
she makes him self conscious and rightly

1227
01:06:33,791 --> 01:06:35,890
so,
but he's also a.

1228
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:36,903
she's also a psychological figure 
because he imagined that when a young 

1229
01:06:39,401 --> 01:06:42,280
man is establishing a relationship with 
a young woman and he's,

1230
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:45,250
he's enamored of her,
he's falling in love,

1231
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:49,630
he projects an ideal onto her and that 
ideal is going to be partially fulfilled

1232
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:52,810
by the relationship,
the degree to which is unspecified,

1233
01:06:52,811 --> 01:06:53,644
and sometimes it'll collapse completely,
but he projects an ideal onto her 

1234
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,450
because otherwise you wouldn't be 
attracted to her.

1235
01:06:58,451 --> 01:06:59,284
And then the ideal judges him and so 
that makes them feel all self conscious 

1236
01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:04,483
and useless,
which is useful because he is useless 

1237
01:07:07,001 --> 01:07:08,110
and should feel that way.

1238
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:10,840
And so it's part of the impetus to 
growing up.

1239
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:13,930
So,
and of course one of the

1240
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:16,413
you need necessity in order to mature 
you because to mature is to take on 

1241
01:07:19,121 --> 01:07:22,660
responsibility and you're not going to 
feel that impetus unless

1242
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:26,990
adopting the responsibility has some 
sort of payoff.

1243
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:30,860
And women tend to mate across and up 
dominance hierarchy.

1244
01:07:30,861 --> 01:07:32,980
So they tend to actually like men who 
are useful.

1245
01:07:32,981 --> 01:07:36,040
And so if they encounter a man who isn't
used full at all,

1246
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:39,220
they're gonna.
That's exactly what's going to happen.

1247
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:42,730
They're going to not be happy about that
in the least.

1248
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:45,820
And so no wonder,
and I think the reason for that,

1249
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,780
it's economic antibiological reason.
The reason is,

1250
01:07:48,781 --> 01:07:53,500
is that women are in the position of 
having to take care of infants primarily

1251
01:07:54,610 --> 01:07:55,443
and an infant has a very heavy load and 
so even a woman who's extraordinarily 

1252
01:07:58,601 --> 01:07:59,434
competent is going to find herself 
substantially limited in her 

1253
01:08:02,231 --> 01:08:04,450
possibilities if she has an infant.

1254
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:05,613
And so then she's looking around for 
someone who will pick up part of the 

1255
01:08:07,181 --> 01:08:09,820
load.
It's perfectly reasonable and you're not

1256
01:08:09,821 --> 01:08:11,980
going to pick up part of the load if 
you're completely useless.

1257
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:13,023
And so it's in the woman's best interest
not to have two children roughly 

1258
01:08:17,931 --> 01:08:19,550
speaking.
So anyway,

1259
01:08:19,551 --> 01:08:20,384
she pins him and then he's all resentful
about it immediately because she's 

1260
01:08:23,661 --> 01:08:24,494
calling him on his stupid friends and 
the fact that he's out there 

1261
01:08:26,091 --> 01:08:29,660
gallivanting impulsively in paradise 
when there's real problems to be solved.

1262
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:33,170
And so look at him.
He's all resentful and useless and,

1263
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:37,310
and feeling put upon.
And picked upon and you just got to slap

1264
01:08:37,311 --> 01:08:38,310
him again,
fundamentally.

1265
01:08:38,311 --> 01:08:40,550
And she's just completely stunned by 
that.

1266
01:08:40,551 --> 01:08:41,870
It's like,
and tells them,

1267
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:46,700
you know,
where's the Sim by use to know right now

1268
01:08:46,701 --> 01:08:48,950
he's a little doubtful about the whole 
situation there.

1269
01:08:49,850 --> 01:08:50,683
The animators do a very nice job of this
part of the movie because one of the 

1270
01:08:53,121 --> 01:08:56,090
things you see is that his eyebrows are 
always pointing up in the middle.

1271
01:08:56,690 --> 01:08:59,090
Whereas his father's eyebrows were 
pointing down in the middle.

1272
01:08:59,091 --> 01:09:00,770
And so that's the difference between 
this,

1273
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:01,813
which is sort of like things are 
happening to me and this which is more 

1274
01:09:04,461 --> 01:09:08,240
like I'm imposing my will on things and 
that's an immature face.

1275
01:09:08,241 --> 01:09:09,074
And,
and the automators captured that 

1276
01:09:10,161 --> 01:09:13,400
brilliantly.
So here's where she shames him again.

1277
01:09:13,401 --> 01:09:16,270
She tells him how much he liked him when
he was little and,

1278
01:09:16,330 --> 01:09:17,163
and you know,
a potential king and how hurt she is 

1279
01:09:19,701 --> 01:09:23,690
that he's this useless,
wide-eyed,

1280
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:25,400
naive,
impulsive,

1281
01:09:25,401 --> 01:09:27,770
pleasure seeking adolescent.
And

1282
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:32,930
she tells him that she missed him and 
God only knows why.

1283
01:09:32,931 --> 01:09:33,764
Because look at them again.
It's like completely appalling pauling 

1284
01:09:37,791 --> 01:09:42,791
creature and this is when Puma and sing 
that song about the fact that you know,

1285
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:49,150
their friends doomed because you know,
this girl's got him and then they switch

1286
01:09:49,581 --> 01:09:54,050
into another archetipal scene and so 
they're falling in love here and so that

1287
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:58,310
paradise imagery is really highlighted 
in the movie and so they go off and have

1288
01:09:58,311 --> 01:09:59,144
this like romp self reflective romp 
through this new paradise and they 

1289
01:10:05,151 --> 01:10:10,151
wrestle around and play and then he pins
her more or less than she licks them.

1290
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:15,650
That's,
that's not so good.

1291
01:10:18,230 --> 01:10:22,090
And this is one of the most brilliant 
shots I think that the animators managed

1292
01:10:22,091 --> 01:10:26,930
because she's obviously pushing this a 
little bit farther than he knows what to

1293
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:29,570
do with.
And so they're wrestling and he,

1294
01:10:29,870 --> 01:10:33,050
she licks them and then she lays down 
and makes this face,

1295
01:10:33,051 --> 01:10:33,884
which is every single class I've ever 
showed this to all laugh when they see 

1296
01:10:38,061 --> 01:10:40,370
that image.
And that's a good example.

1297
01:10:40,371 --> 01:10:43,490
So Freud said that jokes were a good 
route into the unconscious.

1298
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:45,223
So the question is,
and this is an archetypal facial 

1299
01:10:47,631 --> 01:10:49,850
expression and everyone knows exactly 
what it means.

1300
01:10:49,851 --> 01:10:50,684
There's something sexually seductive 
about it and something very sexually 

1301
01:10:53,691 --> 01:10:54,524
seductive about it,
despite the fact that it's a linus and 

1302
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:00,440
the animators do an extraordinarily good
job of capturing that.

1303
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:05,680
And so that has a huge effect on him.
While these guys know that the games out

1304
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:08,630
man,
it's like they know their dad,

1305
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:14,530
whatever attractions they can offer our 
paling in comparison to so.

1306
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:18,360
So anyways,
things don't really progress passed out,

1307
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:21,840
but you know,
he gets a hint of her longing for him,

1308
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:22,973
what's waiting for him if he grows up 
and the fact that she's completely 

1309
01:11:25,321 --> 01:11:27,690
disappointed in him because he's so 
completely useless.

1310
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:28,763
And so now he's lounging about like some
basement dweller with cheeto dust all 

1311
01:11:33,451 --> 01:11:38,451
over his chest and trying to justify his
absolutely useless life.

1312
01:11:39,451 --> 01:11:40,284
And you know,
saying that he doesn't have any 

1313
01:11:41,641 --> 01:11:46,290
responsibility to the devastated kingdom
and he's out there were Hakuna Matata,

1314
01:11:46,291 --> 01:11:48,040
you know,
I can just do whatever I want and,

1315
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:51,780
and follow my impulsive pleasures.
And she thinks he's pretty pathetic.

1316
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,260
And the reason for that is because he is
actually pretty pathetic.

1317
01:11:55,650 --> 01:11:58,890
And she,
she tells him that she's extraordinarily

1318
01:11:58,891 --> 01:12:00,750
disappointed and he gets all pouty about
it.

1319
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:01,890
I mean,
even here,

1320
01:12:01,891 --> 01:12:05,100
you see when he,
when he's got kind of an aggressive look

1321
01:12:05,101 --> 01:12:05,934
on his face,
there's still nothing about it that's 

1322
01:12:07,771 --> 01:12:08,400
commanding.

1323
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,900
It's petulant,
right?

1324
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:12,060
It's like,
well now I'm irritated,

1325
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:17,061
but he's got no force and,
and still completely appalling in this,

1326
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:18,323
in this particular situation.
So she judges him very harshly and 

1327
01:12:21,061 --> 01:12:23,660
leaves and that makes them think,
hey,

1328
01:12:23,930 --> 01:12:24,763
it's all self conscious because this 
female that he admires wants to have 

1329
01:12:28,591 --> 01:12:31,440
nothing to do with him.
And so he's first of all,

1330
01:12:31,441 --> 01:12:33,480
then he thinks,
well maybe I'll just hate all women,

1331
01:12:33,481 --> 01:12:36,090
which is pretty pathetic conclusion.
And,

1332
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:38,190
but a very common one.
And the next is,

1333
01:12:38,191 --> 01:12:40,560
well maybe there's actually something 
wrong with them.

1334
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:42,073
Right?
Which is a very painful bit of self 

1335
01:12:43,261 --> 01:12:44,930
reflection.
So he,

1336
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:46,613
he had,
he knows that there's something wrong 

1337
01:12:47,671 --> 01:12:48,504
with him.
And then he calls out to his father and 

1338
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:49,981
says,
look,

1339
01:12:49,981 --> 01:12:52,740
you said you were always going to be 
here for me and you're not.

1340
01:12:52,741 --> 01:12:53,574
And so what's happening is that he's,
he's become aware of the insufficiency 

1341
01:12:57,001 --> 01:12:57,834
of his current adolescent value 
structure and he wants something beyond 

1342
01:13:00,721 --> 01:13:01,554
it,
which would be associated with 

1343
01:13:02,131 --> 01:13:04,410
identification with the father,
but he can't.

1344
01:13:04,710 --> 01:13:06,900
He can't find the father.
The father is dead.

1345
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:07,973
It's like when Pinocchio goes down to 
the bottom of the ocean to bring Japan 

1346
01:13:10,311 --> 01:13:11,700
Eto up from the depths,
right?

1347
01:13:11,701 --> 01:13:15,330
That's the situation that that symbol 
finds himself in.

1348
01:13:15,331 --> 01:13:16,164
Right now,
the father's gone and has to be brought 

1349
01:13:17,971 --> 01:13:21,630
up from the depths.
So this is where the movie takes the,

1350
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:25,530
they the archetypical pathway of an 
initiation ceremony.

1351
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:29,130
So he says he wants to change.
Now,

1352
01:13:29,131 --> 01:13:30,570
one of the things,
Carl Rogers,

1353
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:33,150
one of the clinicians that we'll talk 
about pointed out was that if,

1354
01:13:33,510 --> 01:13:35,220
if someone was going to come to 
psychotherapy,

1355
01:13:35,221 --> 01:13:38,520
there's some things that had to happen 
before they went into psychotherapy.

1356
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:39,623
And one thing that had to happen was 
that they had to admit that there was 

1357
01:13:41,911 --> 01:13:44,550
something wrong and they had to want to 
change.

1358
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:48,300
You had to have that before you went 
into the psychotherapeutic situation.

1359
01:13:48,510 --> 01:13:50,580
And what happens here is Simba is 
actually,

1360
01:13:50,670 --> 01:13:53,880
he's dropped his arrogance and he's 
looking upward,

1361
01:13:54,850 --> 01:13:57,750
kind of like Japan,
Eto wishing on the Star in Pinocchio.

1362
01:13:58,140 --> 01:13:58,973
He's looking upwards.
He looking towards something higher and 

1363
01:14:01,831 --> 01:14:04,920
he wants to transform himself.
So he's asked the question,

1364
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:09,540
how can I change for the better?
And he doesn't get an answer.

1365
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:13,900
And then Rafiki shows up.
So what does that mean?

1366
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:17,320
It means that as soon as you know you're
wrong about something,

1367
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:22,180
as soon as you admit that you're wrong 
about something and you open the door to

1368
01:14:22,181 --> 01:14:25,120
potential change,
that part of you will respond.

1369
01:14:25,810 --> 01:14:26,643
So,
and you know this because think about 

1370
01:14:28,151 --> 01:14:28,984
this,
you're thinking so you ask yourself a 

1371
01:14:32,381 --> 01:14:33,214
question because that's what you do when
you're thinking and then you generate 

1372
01:14:34,991 --> 01:14:36,070
some answers.
It's like,

1373
01:14:36,190 --> 01:14:38,560
it's very strange.
The thinking will actually work.

1374
01:14:38,561 --> 01:14:41,680
You can actually come up with answers if
you think about something.

1375
01:14:42,190 --> 01:14:44,020
And so this credit,
this issue is okay.

1376
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:47,530
I thought I was real good in my little 
impulsive paradise,

1377
01:14:47,531 --> 01:14:51,700
but then it turns out that I'm just a 
halfwit and I noticed that and I want to

1378
01:14:51,701 --> 01:14:52,534
do something about it.
So the question is now the question is 

1379
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:59,680
has now been posed and what you would 
say is the deeper part of yourself,

1380
01:14:59,710 --> 01:15:02,770
the part that still contains your 
undeveloped potential,

1381
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:03,843
will respond to that posed question and 
change the way that you look at things 

1382
01:15:08,021 --> 01:15:09,970
and changed the way that you act.
It'll start,

1383
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:14,650
it'll start changing things so that you 
can tap those parts of yourself that are

1384
01:15:14,651 --> 01:15:17,860
not yet developed and you certainly do 
that in psychotherapy,

1385
01:15:17,861 --> 01:15:18,694
but you can do that.
Young said that psychotherapy could be 

1386
01:15:20,291 --> 01:15:21,124
replaced by a supreme moral effort and 
by that he meant was that if you really 

1387
01:15:24,521 --> 01:15:25,354
wanted things to be better,
if you want it to get your act together 

1388
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:28,833
and you admitted that you were 
insufficient in your current state and 

1389
01:15:31,541 --> 01:15:32,374
you meditated on the issue and tried to 
figure out what you should do next to 

1390
01:15:35,951 --> 01:15:36,784
make to put yourself together,
that you would be able to find out that 

1391
01:15:39,761 --> 01:15:42,700
there's something in you that guides the
process of development.

1392
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:46,540
That's the self that's a higher.
It's the higher self in some sense.

1393
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:48,123
It's the thing that remains constant 
across transformations because you're 

1394
01:15:51,821 --> 01:15:53,050
somewhere.
Then you fall apart,

1395
01:15:53,051 --> 01:15:53,884
then you get somewhere else,
but there's something outside of that 

1396
01:15:55,511 --> 01:15:58,840
that's guiding that process and that's 
also the self.

1397
01:15:58,841 --> 01:15:59,674
That's what you could be and you can 
communicate in some sense with what you 

1398
01:16:03,401 --> 01:16:04,234
could be,
and that's a very strange thing about 

1399
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:07,450
human beings.
Anyways,

1400
01:16:07,810 --> 01:16:08,643
Rafiki shows up and Simba is sitting by 
the water self reflecting and there's a 

1401
01:16:12,521 --> 01:16:16,240
little pebble that drops into the pool 
to attract his attention and up pops the

1402
01:16:16,241 --> 01:16:18,820
self and Rafique.
He's a trickster.

1403
01:16:18,821 --> 01:16:21,730
He tells him weird jokes and he hits him
with a stick a bunch of times.

1404
01:16:21,731 --> 01:16:25,170
Thank God because someone really needs 
to and he,

1405
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:27,550
he,
he makes some stupid jokes about bananas

1406
01:16:27,551 --> 01:16:31,120
and Kinda entices Simba into following 
him,

1407
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:31,600
right?

1408
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,433
He,
he lets him know that he has a secret 

1409
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:38,230
and he entices Simba into following them
and so all of a sudden become interested

1410
01:16:38,231 --> 01:16:39,064
in something.
So if you ask yourself what the next 

1411
01:16:40,991 --> 01:16:42,910
developmental stages and you really want
to know,

1412
01:16:43,090 --> 01:16:43,923
then all of a sudden you're going to 
become interested in things that might 

1413
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:46,684
move you to the next stage.
And that'll happen more or less 

1414
01:16:49,391 --> 01:16:51,160
unconsciously.
Anyways.

1415
01:16:51,730 --> 01:16:55,930
Rafiki entices him and then runs away 
and Simba follows it,

1416
01:16:56,380 --> 01:16:57,213
and while that's where he reveals 
himself as a sage and then he tells 

1417
01:17:01,451 --> 01:17:04,240
Simba to follow him and he goes 
underground,

1418
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:06,580
and this is the initiation scene,
right?

1419
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:09,100
Which we talked about at the beginning 
of the class.

1420
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:12,650
This is the descent into the underworld 
and it's a.

1421
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:17,030
it's a prerequisite to radical 
personality transformation.

1422
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:18,073
So anyways,
he goes through this horrifying 

1423
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:23,600
underground tunnel system where 
everything's all tangled up,

1424
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:27,830
which is you'll know if you ever fall 
into chaos and everything down there and

1425
01:17:27,831 --> 01:17:28,880
chaos is tangled up.

1426
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:33,910
It's a tangled mess and he's quite and 
there's horrifying music going on in the

1427
01:17:34,011 --> 01:17:39,011
background and he goes deeper and deeper
until Rafiki says he finds a pool in the

1428
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:40,970
middle of the chaos,
a deep pool.

1429
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:42,850
That's another symbol of the self.
It's,

1430
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:43,903
it's the deep unconscious.
There's something down there that's 

1431
01:17:46,071 --> 01:17:48,650
alive that can be drawn up to the 
surface.

1432
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:49,693
And so Rafiki shows him the pool and 
Simba who's quite terrified at this 

1433
01:17:54,291 --> 01:17:55,520
point,
looks at it,

1434
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,400
and the first thing he sees is he only 
sees himself.

1435
01:17:58,730 --> 01:18:00,800
He only sees his own reflection.
And Rafiki says,

1436
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:04,580
look deeper now you see what the 
animators do here.

1437
01:18:04,581 --> 01:18:05,414
It's very cool.
So there's Simba and there's his 

1438
01:18:07,881 --> 01:18:08,714
reflection,
but you see that is already half his 

1439
01:18:10,191 --> 01:18:14,090
father and you look at the difference in
the eyebrows and the and the look.

1440
01:18:14,150 --> 01:18:14,983
So there's a,
there's a tightness of jaw and a 

1441
01:18:17,391 --> 01:18:20,540
firmness of face that starting to 
manifest itself there.

1442
01:18:20,660 --> 01:18:21,493
And that means that he starting to see 
the man he could be beyond the 

1443
01:18:24,891 --> 01:18:27,080
adolescent.
That's a good way of thinking about it.

1444
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:28,760
And then all of a sudden while they're,
you know,

1445
01:18:28,761 --> 01:18:30,290
that's a whole different face,
right?

1446
01:18:30,590 --> 01:18:32,300
That's a seriously different face

1447
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:35,033
that everything's going in and that it's
like get out of my way because things 

1448
01:18:38,611 --> 01:18:41,580
are gonna happen around me.
Very judgemental as well.

1449
01:18:41,820 --> 01:18:42,653
So it's not,
it's not naive by any stretch of the 

1450
01:18:44,521 --> 01:18:45,354
imagination,
but we know as far as a good guy and so 

1451
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:49,253
there's something archetypal about this.
And so he sees the man he could be 

1452
01:18:52,830 --> 01:18:53,663
reflected back to them and then that 
switches that actually becomes a cosmic 

1453
01:18:56,611 --> 01:18:59,130
event and we switch up to the sky 
instead.

1454
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:03,870
And so move fossa manifests himself 
basically as a solar deity

1455
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:10,290
and he tells Simba that he's forgotten 
who he is,

1456
01:19:10,710 --> 01:19:11,543
which is the son of a king,
and that he should remember that and 

1457
01:19:15,391 --> 01:19:20,010
start acting like it.
And that's an archetypal idea.

1458
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:20,963
So if you're just a useless adolescent,
then you forgotten who you are and the 

1459
01:19:23,851 --> 01:19:27,300
consequences of that is that the state 
is going to fall around,

1460
01:19:28,260 --> 01:19:29,093
fall apart around you and you're not 
going to do anything to fix it and 

1461
01:19:30,751 --> 01:19:33,510
you're not going to be good for anything
and no one's going to be able to rely on

1462
01:19:33,511 --> 01:19:35,730
you and you're going to be all whiny and
resentful.

1463
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:38,220
And then it after that,
it even gets worse.

1464
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:41,010
And so that's basically what Mufasa 
tells them.

1465
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:44,460
And so Simba is like blown away by this 
vision,

1466
01:19:44,461 --> 01:19:45,294
right?
Because he sees what he could be and 

1467
01:19:47,071 --> 01:19:49,860
also what he's not,
which is pretty damn horrifying.

1468
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:53,490
So anyways,
the storm,

1469
01:19:54,210 --> 01:19:56,790
so to speak,
clears and Rafiki comes up and,

1470
01:19:56,930 --> 01:19:57,763
and symbols a lot more thoughtful and 
not quite as whiny and resentful 

1471
01:20:00,751 --> 01:20:02,430
anymore.
And Rafiki

1472
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:04,833
leaves.
And so Simba now knows what he's 

1473
01:20:06,461 --> 01:20:08,250
supposed to do,
supposed to start

1474
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:09,083
being useless and take on moral 
requirements of setting the kingdom 

1475
01:20:13,261 --> 01:20:17,640
straight.
And so he runs back across the desert,

1476
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,890
there's all sorts of impressive music 
happening,

1477
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:20,873
and then he comes back to his kingdom 
and it's not looking so good and that's 

1478
01:20:24,001 --> 01:20:25,780
the consequence of his,
uh,

1479
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:28,080
his abandonment of it.
That's a big part of it.

1480
01:20:28,081 --> 01:20:28,914
So now it's dead,
but also his abandonment of it to 

1481
01:20:31,531 --> 01:20:34,740
nothing but malevolence and chaos.
And so

1482
01:20:36,450 --> 01:20:38,370
he's pretty taken aback at what's 
happened.

1483
01:20:38,371 --> 01:20:39,204
And Daddy,
he exaggerates his guilt or it should 

1484
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:44,190
anyways.
And nella shows up and,

1485
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:47,820
and they decide they're going to do 
something about this.

1486
01:20:47,821 --> 01:20:50,070
So in the meantime,
a

1487
01:20:52,090 --> 01:20:55,380
sim as mother is complaining about the 
fact that there's no food in the kingdom

1488
01:20:55,381 --> 01:20:56,214
anymore and that they've gone as far as 
they can and scar doesn't want to hear 

1489
01:20:58,441 --> 01:20:59,610
this.
So he,

1490
01:20:59,611 --> 01:21:03,060
uh,
he attacks her and Simba decides to,

1491
01:21:03,061 --> 01:21:04,470
uh,
to go to war.

1492
01:21:04,890 --> 01:21:05,723
And so this is where he wakes up and 
he's willing to encounter the shadow at 

1493
01:21:09,451 --> 01:21:10,284
this point.
And so we confronts scar and scars very 

1494
01:21:14,191 --> 01:21:18,170
concerned about this because actually 
sim is looking pretty impressive now had

1495
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:19,013
he thought he was dead besides and so he
tries to use treachery and whiny ness 

1496
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:24,443
and subordination to excuse himself,
but he's planning to overthrow Simba 

1497
01:21:30,690 --> 01:21:34,680
nonetheless to resist him.
So he tell scar to leave.

1498
01:21:35,310 --> 01:21:38,700
He's going to banish him to the nether 
regions outside of the kingdom,

1499
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:43,410
like scarred to him.
And scar basically refuses.

1500
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:44,873
And then a storm gathers right and
lights the dead wood around the rock on 

1501
01:21:51,361 --> 01:21:52,194
fire.
So we have another kind of descended 

1502
01:21:53,101 --> 01:21:56,370
into hell scene here.
A very common in Disney movies.

1503
01:21:56,371 --> 01:21:57,204
This,
this,

1504
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:58,043
this notion of the hero fighting the 
evil force on the edge of something 

1505
01:22:01,171 --> 01:22:02,880
that's burning.
It's quite a common motif.

1506
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,410
You see it in sleeping beauty for 
example.

1507
01:22:04,650 --> 01:22:05,483
So they have a big war and scar ends up 
putting Simba in the same position that 

1508
01:22:10,051 --> 01:22:10,884
Mufasa was in.
And then he whispers to him that he 

1509
01:22:12,841 --> 01:22:13,674
killed his father.
So Sam has been thinking all along that 

1510
01:22:15,811 --> 01:22:18,600
it was only his fault and it is sort of 
his fault,

1511
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:19,434
but he didn't know that there was a more
archetypal theme playing out in the 

1512
01:22:21,751 --> 01:22:22,584
background,
which is that societies are always 

1513
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:30,060
endangered by malevolence always,
and that's independent to some degree of

1514
01:22:30,061 --> 01:22:32,580
symbols,
decisions and his and his lack thereof.

1515
01:22:32,670 --> 01:22:34,860
Anyway,
scar tells him to because he thinks he's

1516
01:22:34,861 --> 01:22:39,861
won and that energizes Simba to have 
this sort of final battle.

1517
01:22:40,561 --> 01:22:45,561
He leaps out from the pit and they have 
a big fight and he pins him basically,

1518
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:52,520
and the female lionesses come to his aid
and Simba tells him that again,

1519
01:22:53,491 --> 01:22:54,324
that he has to leave.
And so they have a big fight that's a 

1520
01:22:56,251 --> 01:22:57,084
particularly good bit of animation.
So there's real demonic aspect discard 

1521
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:05,250
their sort of king of hell imagery and.
But he loses and then ha,

1522
01:23:07,570 --> 01:23:08,403
he blames his minions.
He blames the Hyenas for everything 

1523
01:23:10,421 --> 01:23:11,950
terrible that's happening for getting 
that.

1524
01:23:11,951 --> 01:23:12,784
They can hear him and then he falls off 
the cliff and hygienists go in and 

1525
01:23:15,911 --> 01:23:16,744
finish them off.
So it's pretty brutal ending for poor 

1526
01:23:19,931 --> 01:23:23,560
old scar.
I'm eaten by his own minions

1527
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,030
and then scars,
Dad and Simba has one,

1528
01:23:27,031 --> 01:23:29,430
and so the rains come immediately and so
what does that mean?

1529
01:23:29,431 --> 01:23:30,264
Well,
it means that when proper order is 

1530
01:23:31,171 --> 01:23:32,004
restored in the kingdom,
then everything starts to flourish 

1531
01:23:33,841 --> 01:23:37,260
again,
and so the rains come and then,

1532
01:23:40,330 --> 01:23:41,111
well,
it's raining.

1533
01:23:41,111 --> 01:23:45,220
Simba climbs up to the top of the rock 
and now he's completely mature,

1534
01:23:45,221 --> 01:23:46,054
right?
The facial pathetic facial expression 

1535
01:23:47,681 --> 01:23:48,514
disappears entirely.
Knee straightens himself up because now 

1536
01:23:49,991 --> 01:23:50,824
he's full of Serotonin.
After having defeated good old scar and 

1537
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:54,993
all the lionesses are roaring and he 
climbs up pride rock and they roar at 

1538
01:23:59,531 --> 01:24:00,730
him,
which is good.

1539
01:24:00,731 --> 01:24:03,070
They're tough and he's tough and they 
show in their teeth.

1540
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:08,071
It's not.
It's not a society of naive and harmless

1541
01:24:09,011 --> 01:24:09,844
creatures.
It's something that's got some bite and 

1542
01:24:13,031 --> 01:24:13,864
the rains come and then the next thing 
you see as the restoration of the 

1543
01:24:16,481 --> 01:24:19,450
kingdom.
And so basically what that means is that

1544
01:24:20,110 --> 01:24:24,100
if the individual is willing to confront
their own shadow and then to take on the

1545
01:24:24,101 --> 01:24:26,800
malevolent forces that continually 
undermine society,

1546
01:24:27,070 --> 01:24:30,310
then harmony can be restored and 
everyone can do well.

1547
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:33,790
And so then we have a return to the 
beginning,

1548
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:38,800
right?
And so Simba Nela are now a couple along

1549
01:24:38,801 --> 01:24:43,801
with Puma and simone,
and they have a baby and Rafiki shows up

1550
01:24:45,851 --> 01:24:50,430
and does the same thing.
You know,

1551
01:24:51,620 --> 01:24:52,453
he's,
he's got to present the baby to the sun 

1552
01:24:54,941 --> 01:24:56,890
and have all the animals bow again.
And,

1553
01:24:57,370 --> 01:25:01,570
and that's the end of the movie.
So that's all packed.

1554
01:25:06,710 --> 01:25:08,690
That's all packed into an archetypical 
tail.

1555
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:09,863
And so one of the things that young 
would point out is that you all 

1556
01:25:13,971 --> 01:25:14,804
understood this right while you were 
watching it because otherwise at some 

1557
01:25:19,551 --> 01:25:20,384
level all of these things made sense.
They all cohered and the narrative 

1558
01:25:23,511 --> 01:25:27,440
appeared to be inappropriate narrative 
even when you're a little kid it because

1559
01:25:27,441 --> 01:25:31,100
it strikes a chord inside you.
And while that cord,

1560
01:25:31,330 --> 01:25:33,470
the thing that it strikes inside you,
that's the archetype.

1561
01:25:34,310 --> 01:25:36,620
Because if there wasn't something inside
of you,

1562
01:25:36,621 --> 01:25:38,790
so to speak,
that this could communicate with,

1563
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:39,643
then it would fall on deaf ears.
And it speaks to the part of you that's 

1564
01:25:43,251 --> 01:25:44,084
most particularly human.
And it's a story of the development of 

1565
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:49,870
the sovereign individual.
That's,

1566
01:25:49,871 --> 01:25:51,860
that's the right way to think about.
So hero archetype,

1567
01:25:51,861 --> 01:25:52,694
that's another way of thinking about it 
and people are going to get that story 

1568
01:25:56,121 --> 01:25:56,954
one way or another and now and then a 
piece of public art comes along like 

1569
01:26:00,891 --> 01:26:02,660
this.
That does a good job of encapsulating.

1570
01:26:02,661 --> 01:26:07,070
It captures everyone's imagination.
And so that's why you've all seen it.

1571
01:26:07,071 --> 01:26:07,904
And why?
I presume you all enjoyed it when you 

1572
01:26:09,471 --> 01:26:13,100
were kids and maybe still enjoy it now.
So.

1573
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,080
Well that was actually faster than I 
thought it would be today.

1574
01:26:19,081 --> 01:26:20,420
So this is what I'm going to do.
Well,

1575
01:26:20,421 --> 01:26:21,254
we've got 20 minutes,
so why don't you think for a minute or 

1576
01:26:23,611 --> 01:26:26,790
two and I'll take some questions,
which I don't often do,

1577
01:26:26,820 --> 01:26:27,653
but.
And they can be any questions about 

1578
01:26:28,681 --> 01:26:33,100
anything we've covered in class.
So take a minute and.

1579
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:37,473
Yes,

1580
01:26:50,780 --> 01:26:51,780
exactly.

1581
01:27:03,160 --> 01:27:04,940
Archetype.
Yeah.

1582
01:27:05,980 --> 01:27:07,750
Yeah.
Well there's not much difference between

1583
01:27:07,751 --> 01:27:08,584
Gandalf and uh,
who's the wizard and Harry Potter 

1584
01:27:11,610 --> 01:27:12,820
Dumbledore.
There can be the same guy.

1585
01:27:12,830 --> 01:27:13,663
That's right.
Right.

1586
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:14,913
And so well that,
that is precisely the indication of the 

1587
01:27:18,221 --> 01:27:19,950
existence of an archetype.
It's like,

1588
01:27:20,150 --> 01:27:23,440
and a movie.
One time a student asked me,

1589
01:27:23,441 --> 01:27:25,000
well,
if if there are these archetypes,

1590
01:27:25,001 --> 01:27:26,830
why don't we just tell the archetype 
over and over,

1591
01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:28,930
why do we need fiction,
for example,

1592
01:27:28,931 --> 01:27:29,764
which is like a bridge.
If there's individuals here and the 

1593
01:27:31,571 --> 01:27:32,404
archetype is up here,
you know what a high level of 

1594
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:38,020
abstraction fiction sort of fills the 
gap between them and so what you want is

1595
01:27:38,021 --> 01:27:41,530
a story that's archetipal so that you 
understand its basic structure,

1596
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:42,633
but you want enough variation and 
specificity so that this new and 

1597
01:27:45,131 --> 01:27:49,450
interesting and also applicable to you,
so you have to humanize the archetype to

1598
01:27:49,451 --> 01:27:50,020
some degree.

1599
01:27:50,020 --> 01:27:51,670
Otherwise it's so abstract.
You can't.

1600
01:27:51,970 --> 01:27:55,840
You can't relate to it and and good 
stories really do that.

1601
01:27:55,841 --> 01:28:00,610
They bridge the gap and some of them are
more personal and less archetipal,

1602
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:03,970
but if they're completely non,
there's nothing about them that captures

1603
01:28:03,971 --> 01:28:05,350
you.
It doesn't have any force.

1604
01:28:05,890 --> 01:28:06,723
And then if it's too archetipal,
well it gets to be too abstract and you 

1605
01:28:08,861 --> 01:28:09,694
can't relate to it.
So good fiction writers and and good 

1606
01:28:12,521 --> 01:28:13,354
purveyors of of dramatic entertainment.
We think about it as entertainment are 

1607
01:28:17,051 --> 01:28:19,360
really good at occupying that middle 
position,

1608
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:20,733
so yep.
And they reveal the archetype through 

1609
01:28:23,051 --> 01:28:25,630
the individual.
That's one way of thinking about it and,

1610
01:28:26,110 --> 01:28:26,943
and that keeps it fresh and you know,
one of the things that you pointed out 

1611
01:28:30,521 --> 01:28:31,354
too was that you're,
you're going to be manifesting 

1612
01:28:34,511 --> 01:28:36,310
archetypal patterns of behavior in your 
life,

1613
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:37,144
whether you know it or not,
we even when you do something like fall 

1614
01:28:39,671 --> 01:28:40,504
in love,
because that's going to be a very 

1615
01:28:42,281 --> 01:28:43,114
particular experience for you,
but it's also a very common experience 

1616
01:28:45,311 --> 01:28:46,144
at the same time.

1617
01:28:46,750 --> 01:28:47,583
Right?
And,

1618
01:28:47,950 --> 01:28:48,783
and romance is older than people.
That's one way of looking at looking at 

1619
01:28:52,901 --> 01:28:53,734
it.
I mean,

1620
01:28:54,040 --> 01:28:54,873
because sex is older than human beings 
and so you're in the grip of something 

1621
01:28:58,751 --> 01:29:02,820
that's really ancient,
but at the same it's really personal and

1622
01:29:02,821 --> 01:29:03,654
so a good novelist or a writer of 
fiction is able to capture both the 

1623
01:29:07,441 --> 01:29:12,441
personal element of that to show the 
transpersonal within the personal and so

1624
01:29:13,070 --> 01:29:15,510
and in some sense,
your destiny,

1625
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:19,830
proper destiny from a union perspective 
is to consciously express an archetype.

1626
01:29:20,310 --> 01:29:22,980
And so it'd be the archetype.
There's a bunch of them,

1627
01:29:22,981 --> 01:29:23,814
but one of them would be the archetype 
of the hero and you're supposed to 

1628
01:29:25,231 --> 01:29:27,540
manifest that in the conditions of your 
own life.

1629
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:31,110
So that makes the archetype real in the 
conditions of your own life.

1630
01:29:31,560 --> 01:29:34,500
And young would also say that when 
you're doing that,

1631
01:29:34,501 --> 01:29:36,810
your experience will manifest itself as 
meaningful.

1632
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:38,783
And so it's because in some sense you're
acting in accordance with your deepest 

1633
01:29:40,981 --> 01:29:42,840
instincts,
technically speaking,

1634
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:44,000
right?
You're,

1635
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:44,833
you're acting out what it means to be 
human in the world and you're going to 

1636
01:29:47,631 --> 01:29:49,530
find that meaningful.
So

1637
01:29:52,390 --> 01:29:53,223
yes.

1638
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:42,603
Okay.
So the question is about the 

1639
01:30:43,451 --> 01:30:45,970
relationship between the shadow in the.
Okay.

1640
01:30:45,971 --> 01:30:46,804
So
the first thing you have to understand 

1641
01:30:52,270 --> 01:30:53,103
with regards to trying to come to terms 
with the conception of the shadow is to 

1642
01:30:55,841 --> 01:30:59,920
understand the idea of persona and 
persona is the you,

1643
01:30:59,921 --> 01:31:02,230
that you present when you want people to
accept.

1644
01:31:02,231 --> 01:31:05,410
And like you
often like,

1645
01:31:05,990 --> 01:31:10,990
um,
let's say that you go to a party and

1646
01:31:13,370 --> 01:31:14,203
you're trying to impress the people that
are there and you're trying to get them 

1647
01:31:16,611 --> 01:31:21,611
to like you.
And so you maybe get jabbed out a little

1648
01:31:21,681 --> 01:31:22,514
bit and you laugh and you know you're,
you go along with everyone so that they 

1649
01:31:25,881 --> 01:31:27,590
like you,
and then you go home and you're bitterly

1650
01:31:27,591 --> 01:31:31,130
resentful about the way that you were 
put down at this party.

1651
01:31:31,610 --> 01:31:33,680
And that's going to make all sorts of 
aggressive.

1652
01:31:33,681 --> 01:31:34,514
I wish I could have said it's going to 
make all sorts of aggressive and 

1653
01:31:37,491 --> 01:31:38,820
vengeful,
vengeful thought,

1654
01:31:38,821 --> 01:31:41,090
sort of flashed through your 
imagination.

1655
01:31:41,570 --> 01:31:42,403
Well,
the first part of the problem is that 

1656
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:46,070
you are too much persona,
right?

1657
01:31:46,071 --> 01:31:46,904
You sacrificed yourself in some sense 
out the party so that people would like 

1658
01:31:49,521 --> 01:31:50,354
you.
And in the second part you're refusing 

1659
01:31:52,851 --> 01:31:57,200
to admit to the existence of those 
elements of you that would have actually

1660
01:31:57,201 --> 01:31:58,610
protected you from doing that.

1661
01:31:58,610 --> 01:31:59,443
So let's say you go home and you're all 
bitter and resentful and you have 

1662
01:32:02,111 --> 01:32:02,944
fantasies of revenge that reveals to you
the shadow part of you that's 

1663
01:32:07,571 --> 01:32:08,404
aggressive.
And the thing is you actually need that 

1664
01:32:10,661 --> 01:32:11,494
because if you would have integrated 
that more successfully into your 

1665
01:32:13,271 --> 01:32:15,610
personality,
when you went to the party,

1666
01:32:15,611 --> 01:32:16,444
you wouldn't have had lit.
You wouldn't have had to let people put 

1667
01:32:18,341 --> 01:32:20,830
you down to get them to like you,
you know,

1668
01:32:20,831 --> 01:32:21,664
instead of having a face like this which
says all take anything that's coming my 

1669
01:32:25,721 --> 01:32:26,710
way,
you know,

1670
01:32:26,711 --> 01:32:27,544
you have a face and a stance that's more
determined and assertive and if you 

1671
01:32:31,090 --> 01:32:31,923
manifest that properly,
people aren't going to mess with you to 

1672
01:32:33,431 --> 01:32:35,380
begin with,
but you know,

1673
01:32:35,381 --> 01:32:37,780
you may have already adopted a morality 
that says,

1674
01:32:37,781 --> 01:32:38,614
well,
I have to be likable and I shouldn't do 

1675
01:32:39,791 --> 01:32:44,170
anything that causes any conflict and I 
shouldn't ever hurt anybody's feelings.

1676
01:32:44,270 --> 01:32:45,103
So you're just present yourself as a 
punching bag and you think that that 

1677
01:32:48,911 --> 01:32:50,560
makes you a good person,
but it doesn't.

1678
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:54,280
And there's no integration of the shadow
in that situation.

1679
01:32:55,090 --> 01:32:58,180
So you see that at the end of the movie.
You know when I mentioned this,

1680
01:32:58,181 --> 01:33:00,850
when Simba climbs up the rock to take 
control of it,

1681
01:33:00,851 --> 01:33:03,700
all the female lionesses bare their 
teeth and he roars.

1682
01:33:04,130 --> 01:33:07,210
It's like that aggressiveness is 
integrated into it.

1683
01:33:07,930 --> 01:33:08,763
And so resentment is a really good 
emotion for making contact with the 

1684
01:33:13,271 --> 01:33:16,330
shadow side because if you're resentful 
about something,

1685
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:19,990
it basically reveals two things.
It either means that you're immature and

1686
01:33:19,991 --> 01:33:24,580
you should stop whining and get on with 
things you know someone's asked.

1687
01:33:24,610 --> 01:33:25,443
This often happens with adolescents who 
are asked say by their mother to clean 

1688
01:33:27,821 --> 01:33:29,860
up the room.
They can all resentful about it.

1689
01:33:29,890 --> 01:33:31,960
It's like shut up and clean up your 
room.

1690
01:33:31,990 --> 01:33:36,010
You know it's.
It's not that much to ask or so.

1691
01:33:36,011 --> 01:33:36,844
That can be a gateway into the 
observation of your own immaturity or 

1692
01:33:40,870 --> 01:33:41,703
it's possible that you're resentful 
because people really have been poking 

1693
01:33:44,561 --> 01:33:45,394
at you too much and taking and taking 
cheap shots at you end up oppressing 

1694
01:33:49,301 --> 01:33:50,134
you.
But what that means is that you've got 

1695
01:33:51,611 --> 01:33:55,900
some things to say that you haven't been
willing to say or don't know how to say.

1696
01:33:56,770 --> 01:33:57,603
Right?
You can't stand up for yourself 

1697
01:33:58,301 --> 01:34:00,250
properly.
And in order to do that,

1698
01:34:00,251 --> 01:34:03,430
you have to grow some teeth and be 
willing to use them.

1699
01:34:03,730 --> 01:34:05,590
And again,
that's something that might violate your

1700
01:34:05,591 --> 01:34:07,090
morality because you might say,
well,

1701
01:34:07,840 --> 01:34:11,290
I shouldn't be able to bite people,
and the thing is,

1702
01:34:11,291 --> 01:34:12,124
yes,
you should be able to bite people hard 

1703
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:16,750
and if you're able to bite them,
then generally you don't have to,

1704
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:20,320
but they need to know that you can 
because otherwise,

1705
01:34:20,950 --> 01:34:22,780
especially people who are badly 
socialized,

1706
01:34:22,810 --> 01:34:23,643
they'll just keep encroaching on you and
encroaching on you and encroaching on 

1707
01:34:26,171 --> 01:34:28,150
you and encroaching on you until you.

1708
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:29,353
You put up a wall like someone who's 
really well put together won't do that 

1709
01:34:33,820 --> 01:34:38,820
because they're sophisticated.
But if you run into people who only have

1710
01:34:39,251 --> 01:34:42,850
boundaries because other people impose 
them on them and you won't do it,

1711
01:34:43,660 --> 01:34:46,720
you're going to be the bullied one in 
the office for example.

1712
01:34:47,110 --> 01:34:47,943
You're not going to get a raise.
People aren't going to credit you with 

1713
01:34:50,081 --> 01:34:50,914
your own work.
Other people are going to take credit 

1714
01:34:52,121 --> 01:34:52,954
for it.
You know when you're going to go home 

1715
01:34:54,580 --> 01:34:57,650
angry because you're doing your best and
you're trying to get along with everyone

1716
01:34:57,830 --> 01:35:00,350
and nothing ever goes your way.
Well,

1717
01:35:00,351 --> 01:35:01,184
it's because you're a pushover and you 
think that's good because you confuse 

1718
01:35:04,911 --> 01:35:09,911
harmlessness with with with morality.
It's not right.

1719
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:11,353
Just because you can't do any damage 
doesn't mean your moral just means 

1720
01:35:13,431 --> 01:35:16,610
you're.
You don't have the capability for mayhem

1721
01:35:17,990 --> 01:35:19,940
and that makes you a pushover,
mean.

1722
01:35:19,941 --> 01:35:21,600
The Yoga stuff is very,
very dark.

1723
01:35:21,601 --> 01:35:22,434
You know,
it's very dark because his notion of 

1724
01:35:25,521 --> 01:35:29,690
what constitutes a moral human being is 
much different from the typical view.

1725
01:35:30,170 --> 01:35:33,560
He really thinks you get that horrible 
side of yourself integrated.

1726
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:36,840
So it's up there where you can use it 
because otherwise you're,

1727
01:35:37,910 --> 01:35:38,750
you're dangerous.

1728
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:41,573
You can't say no to people and you'll go
along with the crowd and then if the 

1729
01:35:44,521 --> 01:35:46,860
crowd does something particularly 
pathological,

1730
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:49,920
which it's liable to do,
you won't be able to resist it.

1731
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:51,660
You won't have the strength of 
character.

1732
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:53,753
And so then you'll fall prey to crowd 
pathology and it will be because you're 

1733
01:35:57,751 --> 01:35:58,584
too agreeable with a,
with a shadow resentful side that the 

1734
01:36:01,891 --> 01:36:04,500
crowd and it's murderous intent is going
to act out.

1735
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:06,673
So

1736
01:36:08,830 --> 01:36:13,830
yes.
Yes.

1737
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:19,150
So the question is the relationship 
between archetypes,

1738
01:36:19,330 --> 01:36:21,430
archetypes in the idea of memes?
Well,

1739
01:36:21,820 --> 01:36:23,170
oh yeah,
that's a complicated one.

1740
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:28,780
So Richard Dawkins was the guy who 
originated the idea of me and his notion

1741
01:36:28,781 --> 01:36:29,614
was that you could produce an idea or a 
set of ideas that had the capacity to 

1742
01:36:34,361 --> 01:36:37,660
propagate across minds for whatever 
reason.

1743
01:36:37,661 --> 01:36:39,100
It was catchy,
let's say like a,

1744
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:40,990
like a song that gets stuck in your 
head,

1745
01:36:41,370 --> 01:36:43,930
you know it and that,
those.

1746
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:45,153
He called those memes,
which was sort of a play on the idea of 

1747
01:36:48,281 --> 01:36:49,114
genes.
So there are these stable sets of ideas 

1748
01:36:52,661 --> 01:36:55,660
that can be transferred across minds.
Well,

1749
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:56,973
I've often thought when I was reading 
Dawkins that if he would've kept 

1750
01:36:58,931 --> 01:37:03,130
thinking he would have turned into Carl 
young because an archetype is a meme,

1751
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:04,240
but it's a really,
really,

1752
01:37:04,241 --> 01:37:05,074
really deep meme.
So you could imagine that an idea has 

1753
01:37:07,631 --> 01:37:08,464
been sold around for so long and that 
people have acted out for so long that 

1754
01:37:13,751 --> 01:37:17,080
it's actually become part of the 
landscape that does the selection.

1755
01:37:18,130 --> 01:37:19,300
So think about it this way.

1756
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:31,030
So it's more or less a truism that if 
you take a male dominance hierarchy,

1757
01:37:32,290 --> 01:37:35,920
the probability that the man at the top 
of the hierarchy will leave offspring is

1758
01:37:35,921 --> 01:37:36,754
much higher than the probability that 
the men at the bottom will leave 

1759
01:37:38,670 --> 01:37:40,300
offspring.
And it's true in many,

1760
01:37:40,301 --> 01:37:43,600
many species.
Now there's a much higher probability of

1761
01:37:43,601 --> 01:37:46,630
the average female leaving offspring 
than the average man.

1762
01:37:47,770 --> 01:37:48,603
So,
so now then imagine that there's 

1763
01:37:52,061 --> 01:37:54,730
characteristics that push a man up,
a dominance hierarchy,

1764
01:37:56,030 --> 01:37:56,863
okay?
And then imagine that there are 

1765
01:37:57,421 --> 01:37:58,254
characteristics that push a man up,
a set of dominance hierarchies so that 

1766
01:38:03,301 --> 01:38:06,090
each dominance hierarchy has something 
in common with all of the others.

1767
01:38:06,091 --> 01:38:08,280
It's sort of like the idea of a,
of a good player,

1768
01:38:08,281 --> 01:38:11,550
of a game being a good sport across 
games.

1769
01:38:12,510 --> 01:38:13,560
So then imagine that

1770
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:20,640
the idea of the successful male starts 
to become encapsulated in,

1771
01:38:21,460 --> 01:38:23,500
in,
in biology,

1772
01:38:23,710 --> 01:38:27,520
because the species is going to,
the male part of the species at least is

1773
01:38:27,521 --> 01:38:32,500
going to be adapting to the selection 
pressures placed on the mail by the male

1774
01:38:32,501 --> 01:38:33,334
dominance hierarchy.
So what happens is you have a 

1775
01:38:34,541 --> 01:38:37,510
competition between men,
the men that win the competition,

1776
01:38:37,690 --> 01:38:38,523
find partners and mate so that the male 
is going to start to adapt to the fact 

1777
01:38:43,781 --> 01:38:47,560
of the selection that's implemented by 
the dominance hierarchy.

1778
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:50,230
Then you can imagine that that's going 
to take case,

1779
01:38:50,380 --> 01:38:54,490
take place across dominance hierarchies 
because this is happening in many,

1780
01:38:54,491 --> 01:38:58,570
many situations spread across time and 
so then

1781
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:05,160
the idea of how the proper man should 
act starts to become incorporated in the

1782
01:39:06,101 --> 01:39:09,250
biology and also in the expectations of 
the society.

1783
01:39:09,490 --> 01:39:10,323
And then that starts to loop.
So as the expectations become clearer 

1784
01:39:13,871 --> 01:39:14,704
and clearer,
that notion of what constitutes success 

1785
01:39:18,101 --> 01:39:19,660
becomes clearer and clearer as well.

1786
01:39:19,660 --> 01:39:22,690
And the two things get tangled together.
Now,

1787
01:39:22,691 --> 01:39:23,524
and I think you can see that a 
manifestation of that whenever you go 

1788
01:39:27,611 --> 01:39:28,444
watch a movie because you immediately 
identify the hero and you identify with 

1789
01:39:32,741 --> 01:39:33,574
it.
It's like he's the person that you're 

1790
01:39:36,850 --> 01:39:37,683
mythological imagination grasps onto and
you play that out using your body as a 

1791
01:39:42,701 --> 01:39:45,370
representational platform when you watch
the movie.

1792
01:39:45,640 --> 01:39:49,270
And so maybe you admire the hero.
If he's a successful hero,

1793
01:39:49,271 --> 01:39:50,104
you do well.
That admiration is the manifestation of 

1794
01:39:52,811 --> 01:39:53,644
the instinct that drives you towards 
that kind of behavior and not only can 

1795
01:39:57,251 --> 01:39:59,920
you manifest it,
in which case you're likely to feel good

1796
01:39:59,921 --> 01:40:00,754
about yourself because you know that 
sometimes you can feel good about 

1797
01:40:03,131 --> 01:40:03,964
yourself and sometimes not,
but you're also going to be able to 

1798
01:40:06,521 --> 01:40:07,354
recognize it when you see it in the 
world and that's going to manifest 

1799
01:40:10,211 --> 01:40:13,750
itself in admiration and admiration is 
the proclivity Dan imitate

1800
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:18,330
so the meme can be so,
so

1801
01:40:20,150 --> 01:40:22,130
you can imagine.
Dominance hierarchies are very,

1802
01:40:22,131 --> 01:40:24,650
very old.
They're like 300 million years old.

1803
01:40:25,580 --> 01:40:26,413
They've been around a very long time,
and the idea that we have an image of 

1804
01:40:29,331 --> 01:40:31,690
what it takes to climb the dominant 
targets,

1805
01:40:31,810 --> 01:40:32,643
it's more or less self evident
because that's the landscape that 

1806
01:40:36,421 --> 01:40:38,960
selected us,
and at the same time,

1807
01:40:38,961 --> 01:40:41,300
you know the,
the archetype,

1808
01:40:41,930 --> 01:40:45,830
the pattern that propagates you up.
The dominance hierarchy is also the same

1809
01:40:45,831 --> 01:40:47,540
pattern that makes you attractive to 
women.

1810
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:51,680
They're the same thing.
So,

1811
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:52,653
and of course that's a massively 
powerful selection mechanism and sexual 

1812
01:40:56,081 --> 01:40:56,914
selection is really shaped human beings.
It's turned us into what we are and 

1813
01:41:01,031 --> 01:41:02,810
that's an interesting thing too because 
you know,

1814
01:41:03,260 --> 01:41:04,093
here's one of the things that really 
bothers me about the emphasis of 

1815
01:41:07,510 --> 01:41:10,150
evolutionary scientists on randomness,

1816
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:12,393
so like the the gender mutation 
generation process is random or quasi 

1817
01:41:15,701 --> 01:41:16,534
random.
We don't know that for sure because 

1818
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:18,813
there is evidence now that you can 
inherit acquired characteristics and 

1819
01:41:21,221 --> 01:41:24,670
that was nobody thought that was 
possible 20 years ago.

1820
01:41:24,671 --> 01:41:28,480
So things are have taken a very weird 
twist and the Darwinian world.

1821
01:41:28,481 --> 01:41:29,314
But for the sake of argument,
we could say that the mutation process 

1822
01:41:32,171 --> 01:41:35,650
is random,
but the selection process isn't random.

1823
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:37,083
It's not even close to random.
Ever since creatures have been able to 

1824
01:41:40,181 --> 01:41:43,930
evaluate one another,
the selection process hasn't been random

1825
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:45,903
and so basically were selected by,
you could say by the manifestation of 

1826
01:41:48,971 --> 01:41:52,870
mind in the world,
unless you believe that women,

1827
01:41:52,871 --> 01:41:54,010
for example,
exercise,

1828
01:41:54,011 --> 01:41:55,960
no conscious choice in there mate 
selection,

1829
01:41:56,170 --> 01:41:58,690
which seems completely absurd.
First of all,

1830
01:41:58,691 --> 01:42:01,330
men consciously choose who's going to 
lead them,

1831
01:42:01,390 --> 01:42:02,223
at least in part.
You know who's going to succeed in a 

1832
01:42:03,791 --> 01:42:07,540
hierarchy and women consciously choose 
their sexual partners.

1833
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:08,913
So the idea that the selection process,
that the evolutionary process is random 

1834
01:42:12,791 --> 01:42:13,624
is it's an absurd proposition.
Sexual selection makes it nonrandom and 

1835
01:42:17,111 --> 01:42:20,230
Darwin knew that he emphasized sexual 
selection a lot,

1836
01:42:20,231 --> 01:42:23,470
but more modern biologists since the 
time of Darwin,

1837
01:42:23,530 --> 01:42:28,120
except for the last about 20 years,
downplayed the role of sexual selection.

1838
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:29,193
And I think the reason for that is that 
it brings mind into the evolutionary 

1839
01:42:34,331 --> 01:42:39,040
process in a way that they don't like 
and no wonder it's complicated.

1840
01:42:39,041 --> 01:42:39,874
You know,
it's like to some degree we're 

1841
01:42:40,931 --> 01:42:41,764
consciously directing our own evolution,
at least through the mechanism of 

1842
01:42:44,171 --> 01:42:45,004
selection.

1843
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:56,633
Yes,

1844
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:58,190
yes.
Well darkens.

1845
01:42:58,191 --> 01:42:59,024
Just thought of memes as something that 
he'd ever thought about them as 

1846
01:43:01,041 --> 01:43:04,190
something that could last long enough to
play a role in selection itself.

1847
01:43:05,670 --> 01:43:06,503
You know,
he thought about the Morris parasitical 

1848
01:43:07,830 --> 01:43:11,100
cognitive entities,
I would say that just sort of floated on

1849
01:43:11,101 --> 01:43:14,280
the surface of the mental landscape.
He never,

1850
01:43:14,850 --> 01:43:15,683
he never grappled with the idea that a 
meme could be something that could last 

1851
01:43:19,470 --> 01:43:21,990
for hundreds of millions of years 
roughly speaking.

1852
01:43:22,750 --> 01:43:23,583
So

1853
01:43:27,020 --> 01:43:29,030
we got time for one more question if 
anybody has.

1854
01:43:29,031 --> 01:43:33,850
Yes,
yes.

1855
01:43:33,851 --> 01:43:34,684
From a political perspective,
like if you divide people by their 

1856
01:43:36,401 --> 01:43:37,234
political affiliation,
it looks like liberal men are the most 

1857
01:43:39,221 --> 01:43:40,054
unhappy,

1858
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:45,550
they're higher in neuroticism.
Um,

1859
01:43:45,551 --> 01:43:49,150
I think the openness probably 
contributes to it as well,

1860
01:43:49,151 --> 01:43:49,984
but we don't.
And also possibly the low 

1861
01:43:51,741 --> 01:43:54,260
conscientiousness when my graduate 
students come in,

1862
01:43:54,261 --> 01:43:55,094
or one of the many ways we're going to 
talk about this in some detail because 

1863
01:43:57,291 --> 01:43:58,124
she's going to tell you because we've 
also looked at the personality 

1864
01:44:00,051 --> 01:44:00,884
predictors of political correctness,
which is extraordinarily interesting as 

1865
01:44:04,491 --> 01:44:07,820
well because it doesn't really seem to 
fall exactly on the liberal conservative

1866
01:44:07,821 --> 01:44:08,654
continuum.
So we'll talk more about that when we 

1867
01:44:11,541 --> 01:44:13,160
get into the big five part of the 
course.

1868
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:15,433
Okay,
good.

1869
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:18,860
We'll see you on Thursday when we're 
going to do a speed review of Freud.
