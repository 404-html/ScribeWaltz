1
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,920
Thank you all for coming out.
Well,

2
00:00:35,921 --> 00:00:40,921
good evening Dublin.
As you've just heard,

3
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,070
Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris met the 
first time in person two weeks ago now 

4
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,580
in Vancouver.
They covered an enormous amount of 

5
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,511
ground and there is I think,
an enormous amount of ground still to 

6
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:05,271
cover,
but I've asked them if they would start 

7
00:01:05,271 --> 00:01:09,891
this evening in the following way.
You're all familiar with a straw 

8
00:01:11,311 --> 00:01:14,880
manning.
Anyone who follows politics,

9
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,330
no straw manning,
but I've asked them to do the opposite 

10
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:24,411
tonight,
to start by steel manning the arguments 

11
00:01:24,411 --> 00:01:27,750
of each other to present in the best 
possible,

12
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,220
most,
most rigorous light,

13
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,760
what they understand to be the other's 
argument on all of the meat.

14
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,100
Do issues we're about to discuss.

15
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,540
I'm going to ask Sam Harris to go first 
and we're going to go from there.

16
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,420
Thank you.
So first,

17
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:55,920
thank you all for coming.
It's really,

18
00:01:55,921 --> 00:02:00,921
it's an immense privilege for us to do.
I should say many of you have sacrificed

19
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:11,881
a lot to come here.
People who have come from other 

20
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,561
countries.
I'm told you all dealt with a ticketing 

21
00:02:13,561 --> 00:02:14,560
system that seems like it was run from a
cave in Afghanistan.

22
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,580
It's,
um,

23
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,890
so again,
thank you all because it's,

24
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,920
you know,
it's one thing for us to put this date 

25
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,121
on the calendar and say we're going to 
speak here is another for all of you to 

26
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:33,301
show up.
And this is a privilege we certainly 

27
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:33,301
don't take for granted.
So it's an immense one.

28
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:39,270
So Jordan and I should say that they'll 
much of our conversation together.

29
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:42,940
Wow.

30
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,750
We'll often sound like we're debating 
it.

31
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:50,770
We will definitely have.
None of us are in the habit of pulling 

32
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,391
our punches.
There's an immense amount of goodwill 

33
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:57,420
here and it's true onstage.
It's true offstage and we're all trying 

34
00:02:58,091 --> 00:03:02,740
to refine our beliefs together in 
conversation.

35
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:07,741
So this,
wouldn't none of us view this as a 

36
00:03:07,741 --> 00:03:09,130
debate though we might stridently 
disagree about one thing or another.

37
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,880
Um,
what.

38
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,730
So what Jordan,
I think,

39
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:17,350
disagrees with me about it.
I think he is worried that I thought,

40
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,530
wow,
we clearly have a common project we're 

41
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,900
both concerned to understand how to live
lives worth living.

42
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:31,950
How can we do this individually and how 
can we build societies that safeguard 

43
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:37,170
this project for millions of people 
attempting to do this and in their 

44
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:41,340
diverse ways and so,
so many questions immediately come 

45
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,181
online when you try to do that,
but what is the relationship between 

46
00:03:45,181 --> 00:03:46,330
facts and values,
for instance,

47
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:50,560
or science and spiritual experience or 
ethical lives?

48
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,100
And we have,
as for the moment,

49
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:58,830
different answers to those westerns.
Jordan is concerned that I,

50
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,840
in my allergy to religion in 
sufficiently value the power of stories 

51
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:07,870
in general and religious stories in 
particular,

52
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:12,910
that,
that there's something more than just 

53
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,210
nakedly engaging with facts as the,
as they are,

54
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:20,211
but we do.
We don't simply come into contact with 

55
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:20,710
reality.
We have to interpret reality.

56
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:24,940
We interpreted through our senses and 
with our brands obviously,

57
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,140
but you need frameworks and as Jordan 
would say,

58
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:32,890
stories with which to do that you don't 
get facts in the Ra.

59
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:38,370
And a Jordan believes that I,
because my purpose so often is to 

60
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,950
counter what I view as the dangerous 
dog.

61
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:49,951
Most within religion.
I ignore the power and even the 

62
00:04:49,951 --> 00:04:52,910
necessity of certain kinds of stories.
Uh,

63
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,350
and certain ways of thinking about the 
world and,

64
00:04:55,351 --> 00:05:00,351
and our situation in the world that,
that not only bring many,

65
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:02,560
many millions or even billions of 
people,

66
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:06,100
immense value are in fact necessary for 
anyone.

67
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:09,160
However rational to build a society 
where all of our,

68
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,590
our,
a wellbeing,

69
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,940
uh,
can,

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,250
can be conserved.
So I think if,

71
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,190
if in brief that's,
that's Jordan's concerned about me,

72
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,540
okay,

73
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,060
so sam is concerned.
Um,

74
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:34,070
I would say above all,
with the minimization of unnecessary 

75
00:05:34,111 --> 00:05:39,111
suffering,
which seems to me to be a pretty good 

76
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:41,640
place to start and he's concerned that

77
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,750
he's concerned that in order to do that 
we need to develop an ethic.

78
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:57,380
And that ethic should be grounded in 
that realization that unnecessary 

79
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,510
suffering is worth contending with and 
dealing with.

80
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:05,200
And that and that if we make too much of
the divide between facts and values,

81
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:11,261
then we end up in a situation where our 
value structure has no super subordinate

82
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:15,800
foundational grounding.
And this is a big problem.

83
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,190
So generally in the philosophical 
community,

84
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:21,380
it's accepted,
although not universally,

85
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:26,090
that it's difficult if not impossible to
derive value from facts.

86
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,360
But the problem with that proposition is
that you end up in a situation where 

87
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,681
either you lose all your values because 
they're just arbitrary or you or you 

88
00:06:35,681 --> 00:06:37,460
have to ground them in something that 
isn't,

89
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:42,990
that that's revelatory.
And Sam is concerned that one of the 

90
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:47,651
negative consequences of grounding your 
fundamental ethic in something that's 

91
00:06:47,651 --> 00:06:51,221
revealed is the emergent consequence of 
irrational fundamentalism.

92
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,900
And so obviously that's worth contending
with.

93
00:06:53,901 --> 00:06:58,820
And so he's taking issue with the 
philosophical idea that facts and values

94
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:03,800
have to be separate and formulating the 
proposition that we can in fact ground a

95
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:08,801
universal system of values in the facts 
and that we can mediate between the 

96
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:12,821
facts and the system of values using 
using our facility for truth,

97
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:19,030
but even more specifically our facility 
for rationality and that rationality can

98
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:25,001
be the mediator between the world of 
facts in the world and the world of 

99
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:27,890
values.
And so the problem I have with that,

100
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:30,770
I guess if,
if we can skip briefly to problems,

101
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:35,771
is that it isn't obvious to me how to 
produce an ethos with sufficient 

102
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:42,491
motivating power to,
to ground that conception of the 

103
00:07:42,491 --> 00:07:47,141
minimization of suffering.
Say in the promotion of wellbeing in a 

104
00:07:47,141 --> 00:07:51,311
way that's,
that grips people in the United States 

105
00:07:51,311 --> 00:07:52,370
society.
And so I think that's,

106
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:57,430
that's part of what we're discussing and
trying to sort out with regards to the 

107
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,541
potential role of narrative and 
religious belief as an underpinning to 

108
00:08:02,631 --> 00:08:03,500
this ethos.

109
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,680
We seem to agree on the necessity for 
the universal ethos.

110
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:12,010
We even seem to agree,
I would say on what that is because 

111
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,741
certainly the minimization of suffering 
seems to me to be a very good place to 

112
00:08:14,741 --> 00:08:14,840
start.
We share,

113
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:19,841
um,
our concern with and a belief that the 

114
00:08:19,841 --> 00:08:24,191
pathway to that ethos is in some manner 
related to our ability to speak the 

115
00:08:24,191 --> 00:08:28,571
truth,
but we disagree on what that has to be 

116
00:08:28,571 --> 00:08:30,350
grounded in and how it has to be 
grounded.

117
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:35,530
My sense,
especially after thinking about our 

118
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,421
discussion is that Sam makes what 
rationality is do too much work.

119
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:43,060
And I'm hoping that not that rationality
is irrelevant or unimportant because it 

120
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,680
clearly is neither of those.
But maybe the devil's in the details and

121
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:48,380
hopefully we can get down to the details
tonight.

122
00:08:48,381 --> 00:08:49,860
And we,
we,

123
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:50,540
we,
for me,

124
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,490
we brought Douglas into the 
conversation.

125
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:57,490
He's here to serve as much more than a 
mere moderator and partly we we've 

126
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:02,960
determined that as Sam alluded to,
that what we're actually trying to 

127
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,490
figure out is what are the minimum 
necessary preconditions for the 

128
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:12,830
construction of engaged productive 
individuals with meaningful,

129
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:18,830
responsible lives in a society that's 
stable enough to sustain itself and 

130
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:22,950
dynamic enough to change what are the 
minimal preconditions for that?

131
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,790
What are the and how do we ground those 
presuppositions,

132
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:31,791
those preconditions,
and what price do we pay for for having 

133
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:32,850
them because you never get something 
without a cost.

134
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:37,851
And we thought that Douglas would be 
very interesting addition to this 

135
00:09:37,851 --> 00:09:41,751
conversation because of course he's 
concentrated on such things as borders 

136
00:09:41,751 --> 00:09:45,060
and when you set up preconditions for 
social order,

137
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:50,061
you also automatically produced such 
things as hierarchies and borders and 

138
00:09:50,061 --> 00:09:53,990
they don't come without a cost.
And so we hope to expand the 

139
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,830
conversation to include a discussion of 
those issues as well.

140
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,010
Yeah.

141
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,540
Before Douglas Chimes,
and I just want to reiterate the fact 

142
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,530
that he has not been cast here as our 
moderator though.

143
00:10:02,531 --> 00:10:06,630
If Jordan and I run off the rails,
I expect Douglas to put us back on,

144
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:11,631
and the king's English,
I'm not moderate enough to be a 

145
00:10:11,631 --> 00:10:12,170
moderator,
but,

146
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:12,710
uh,
your,

147
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,130
your more moderate than either of us 
are,

148
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:20,550
but so I want,
I want you to reset the part of your 

149
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:25,081
brain that is poised to begrudge the 
moderator taken up too much time because

150
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:30,130
every moderator has felt that.
And Bret Weinstein was brilliantly aloof

151
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,860
and uninvolved in much of our exchange 
together,

152
00:10:32,861 --> 00:10:37,861
but,
but doug was really a third participant 

153
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:37,861
here and,
uh,

154
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:41,101
and he,
he stands between Jordan and I on some 

155
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:43,160
issues in a interesting way so that 
there's a,

156
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:48,590
we have a three way conversation here 
where none of us is really sitting in 

157
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:48,640
the same spot.
So

158
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,340
can I make a quick observation about 
some of the,

159
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:56,200
some of the progress that you've already
made in Vancouver?

160
00:10:56,201 --> 00:10:59,560
Some of the Progress I hope we can make 
tonight seems to be.

161
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,030
I see one thing that hampers it,
um,

162
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,280
uh,
let me go straight to it with 

163
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,280
sandwiches.
Um,

164
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,030
I discovered a terrific phrase the other
day that our mutual friend,

165
00:11:10,031 --> 00:11:15,031
Eric Weinstein came up with,
were talking about the manner in which 

166
00:11:15,031 --> 00:11:17,380
you can discuss within the sciences 
certain scientific problems.

167
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,730
And he said,
look,

168
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:24,330
if you've got a scientist who you know 
is also basically a very literalist 

169
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:28,050
Christian,
you will listen to their argument a 

170
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,640
whole long part of the way and there's 
somewhere at the end of it,

171
00:11:30,641 --> 00:11:32,050
you know,
you're going to be worried about it.

172
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,230
And he came up with this phrase,
I love this face.

173
00:11:35,231 --> 00:11:36,670
He says,
Jesus smuggling,

174
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,470
right?

175
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:43,580
Jesus smuggling is,
you're going to follow all the way.

176
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,400
Yes.
Yes.

177
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:48,390
And then the worry is that when you get 
to the bit that you're not so good on,

178
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,250
that's when they're going to smuggle in 
Jesus.

179
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,200
Yeah.
Um,

180
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,340
my suspicion is that you have a 
reservation about some of what Jordan is

181
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:02,341
saying on the substructures on stories 
and much more because you're worried 

182
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,580
that at some point,
either on stage or off it at some point 

183
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,170
when you're not looking.
No,

184
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,760
no.
When I am looking to Jesus.

185
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:13,360
Smuggle you.

186
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:13,840
Yeah.

187
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:26,450
Yeah.
I was thinking maybe I just carry them 

188
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:26,450
in on a cross.

189
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:32,050
Well,
that isn't all to apt analogy because 

190
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,241
it's a.
It is what worries me and it's but it's.

191
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,370
It's more subtle than that because it's 
not.

192
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,700
Just to think that you're consciously 
doing it.

193
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:46,270
Is is a different claim that like 
there's a.

194
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,430
I don't think there's anything insincere
about your argument for the,

195
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,560
for the importance of religion,
but it's.

196
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:56,590
It's also possible we've all met the 
people who we believe are making the of 

197
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:00,190
arguments and are really there.
They're consciously putting the rabbit 

198
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,450
in the hat and then it pretending to be 
surprised when it pops out.

199
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:07,670
Right,
and it the analogy that magic is 

200
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:11,231
actually interesting here because we had
you.

201
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,430
We had over dinner,
we're talking about the,

202
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,950
the,
the difference between real and fake art

203
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,040
and we were talking about this parent,
this paradox that the art seems to be 

204
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,221
incredibly valuable and yet the value 
isn't located in the object itself or 

205
00:13:27,501 --> 00:13:32,501
can't be obviously located there because
a forgery that is a materially the exact

206
00:13:33,561 --> 00:13:37,730
copy of some masterpiece is essentially 
worthless and the real masterpiece.

207
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,760
Even if it suffered some damage would be
incredibly valuable and so where is the 

208
00:13:43,701 --> 00:13:48,701
value to be located?
But it worries me about your enterprise 

209
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:49,160
Jordan and the way in which you were you
were.

210
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:54,460
You seem to be linking our rational 
project and our scientific project with 

211
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,450
religion is,
is right here.

212
00:13:56,451 --> 00:14:01,451
There's A.
There's a difference between at map 

213
00:14:01,451 --> 00:14:04,090
magic as a decent analogy.
There's a difference between like 

214
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,490
paradoxically real magic is fake magic 
and fake magic is real magic.

215
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,720
The real magic in the world produced by 
magicians is the fake magic where the 

216
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,250
magician,
like someone like Darren Brown will tell

217
00:14:16,251 --> 00:14:16,910
you.
Actually no,

218
00:14:16,911 --> 00:14:21,911
I can't read minds and I,
I did put the rabbit in the hat and if 

219
00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:21,911
this is fake,
but,

220
00:14:21,911 --> 00:14:25,950
but the,
the surprise is that even knowing it's 

221
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:28,811
fake,
you can't understand how this affect is 

222
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:31,451
being achieved.
Whereas the fake magicians are the ones 

223
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:33,050
who are pretending to be real,
who are,

224
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,460
who are hiding,
who are not acknowledging the mechanics,

225
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:41,000
the real mechanics behind what is in 
fact effective.

226
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:41,390
You know,
the,

227
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,460
the,
the illusion that the rabbit pops out of

228
00:14:43,461 --> 00:14:46,040
the hat.
And what I worry with,

229
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:52,540
with some of your,
the way in which you discuss the power 

230
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:56,050
story,
the power of metaphor and the religious 

231
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,601
anchoring there is that the,
the leverage and the utility can be had 

232
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,450
even while acknowledging the real 
mechanics of it,

233
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,610
you know,
the fake the fakeness of the magic.

234
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:12,670
Right?
And you seem to suspect that it can do 

235
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,070
that.
Takes all of the wind out of the sales.

236
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,610
I'm not so sure.
I'm not so sure what of it's fake.

237
00:15:16,611 --> 00:15:17,800
And what if it isn't.
Well,

238
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:18,290
let,
let,

239
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:23,430
let.
So I would say that I do consciously 

240
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,190
participate in the process that you 
described,

241
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:26,780
but,
but you see,

242
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:31,781
I would also make the case,
and this is certainly one of the things 

243
00:15:31,781 --> 00:15:34,031
that we've been,
we've been discussing that you do it 

244
00:15:34,031 --> 00:15:37,061
unconsciously and let,
let me make the case for that from him 

245
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:40,420
because I'd really,
I've been thinking about it a lot and 

246
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,131
I'd like to see your response.
So here's what I really read the moral 

247
00:15:42,131 --> 00:15:43,640
landscape a lot and I thought about it a
lot,

248
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:46,880
you know,
and so this is what it looks like to me.

249
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,790
So you,
you,

250
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,920
you make the proposition that we have to
breach the gap between facts and values 

251
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,031
because otherwise our values are left 
hanging unmoored and that certainly 

252
00:15:58,031 --> 00:16:02,711
brings about the danger of nihilism,
but also a potential danger of swing to 

253
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:02,711
totalitarianism.

254
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:03,420
Something we agree about,
right?

255
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,670
I,
I truly do believe that.

256
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:09,380
And then you perform an operation,
not conceptual operation and you say,

257
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:14,530
surely we can all agree that.
And then you outline a story about this 

258
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:19,390
woman who lives in this horrible country
who's basically just being starved in 

259
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,580
disease ridden and tortured her whole 
life and having just a hell of a time of

260
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,220
it to put it in a phrase and then you 
say,

261
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:27,680
well surely we can all agree that that's
not good.

262
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,010
And then you contrast that with,
at least in principle,

263
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:33,260
the sort of life that we would all like 
to have.

264
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,240
If we could choose the life that we 
have.

265
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,590
And then you say,
well,

266
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:40,410
we could start with the proposition that
we should move away from this,

267
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:45,620
this terrible,
hellish circumstance and we should move 

268
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,510
towards this more ideal perspective.
And you say,

269
00:16:47,511 --> 00:16:52,280
if we could only agree on that then and 
so and so,

270
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,020
so far so good.
But this is,

271
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,720
this is.
There's a couple of things that go along

272
00:16:56,721 --> 00:17:01,721
with that that are quite interesting.
And so the first is that actually what 

273
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:05,831
you're claiming is that the highest 
moral good isn't existing in that better

274
00:17:06,351 --> 00:17:11,351
space.
The highest moral good is acting in the 

275
00:17:11,351 --> 00:17:14,030
manner that moves us from the hellish 
domain to the desirable domain.

276
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:15,990
It seems to me to be implicit in your 
argument.

277
00:17:15,991 --> 00:17:19,130
So there's a pattern of behavior that 
constitutes the ethic.

278
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,340
Well,
I would say existing in that,

279
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,900
in that better space is good enough as 
well.

280
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:28,840
Does that mean that there's the,
there's the question of what it takes to

281
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:33,841
move from where you are to some place 
better and then there's just the 

282
00:17:33,841 --> 00:17:34,530
someplace that's better.
There's both of them well

283
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,570
but,
but we perhaps we could say,

284
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,100
look,
what's the ultimate hell?

285
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,820
It might be existing in the hell that 
you described,

286
00:17:41,821 --> 00:17:43,920
but it also might be this is something 
worse.

287
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:48,921
I think.
I think that participating in the 

288
00:17:48,921 --> 00:17:48,960
process that brings about that hell is 
actually a,

289
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:53,160
that's even deeper than the hell,
so it's an analogous argument.

290
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,500
There's the state of being in a good 
state,

291
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:01,040
but there's also the state of being that
brings you to that good state and then 

292
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:04,281
there's the state of being that's in a.
that's a terrible state and the process 

293
00:18:04,281 --> 00:18:07,611
that brings you to that terrible state,
and one of the things that I've learned 

294
00:18:07,611 --> 00:18:12,410
from the architectural and religious 
texts that I've studied as well as the 

295
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:16,071
philosophical texts is that the process 
that transforms society into something 

296
00:18:17,461 --> 00:18:20,970
approximating hell is a lower hell.
Now the reasonable.

297
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,980
Let me just close the loop on that 
because I'm pretty sure I disagree.

298
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,730
You can imagine to counterexamples one,
as you could imagine,

299
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:32,731
a statistic being a.
You might even call him God,

300
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:37,720
who would create a circumstance of hell 
and populate it with innocent souls.

301
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:43,050
Right now that's presumably that action 
need not be attended by a lot of 

302
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,030
suffering or you could imagine.

303
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,070
No,
but it's still.

304
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,410
It's still wrong.
Totally wrong.

305
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,600
No.
You could even imagine someone who 

306
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:53,600
enjoys generating.
Yes,

307
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,240
it could be a source of even more wrong 
than not enjoy it.

308
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:55,800
Okay,
so.

309
00:18:55,810 --> 00:19:00,810
So we want to separate out two things.
We want to separate out these states of 

310
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,940
being and the process that brings them 
into being,

311
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:06,950
and I do believe you do that in your 
work because basically what you suggest 

312
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:10,451
is that the appropriate way to act 
ethically is to act in a manner that 

313
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:12,800
moves us away from hell and moves us 
towards a desirable state.

314
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:18,070
Now,
the thing is is that as far as I'm 

315
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:18,070
concerned,
there's a couple of things about that.

316
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,820
The first thing is that I wouldn't say 
that that mode of acting is a fact.

317
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:27,041
I would say it's a personality and that 
what you're suggesting is that people 

318
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:30,230
embodied the personality that Moves 
Society Way from hell towards heaven for

319
00:19:30,231 --> 00:19:31,280
lack of a better term.

320
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:36,490
And the reason terms and the reason I 
make that argument is because I think 

321
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:40,780
that you recapitulate the essential 
Christian message precisely by doing 

322
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:44,510
that because symbolically speaking,
at least as far as I can understand,

323
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,900
stripped of its religious con of it's 
metaphysical context.

324
00:19:47,901 --> 00:19:51,580
Let's say that the purpose of positing 
the,

325
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,310
the,
the vision of the ideal human being,

326
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,700
which independent of the metaphysical 
context,

327
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:03,870
it certainly what the symbol of Christ 
represents is the mode of being that 

328
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,871
moves us most effectively from something
approximating held to something 

329
00:20:07,871 --> 00:20:10,280
approximating heaven and then part of 
that part of that message is,

330
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,670
and this is also something that's dead 
along the lines of what you're arguing,

331
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:17,420
is that the best way to embody that is 
actually to live in truth.

332
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,290
I mean so because I would say that the 
fundamental Christian ethic,

333
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:25,760
metaphysics accepted once again is to 
act in love,

334
00:20:25,761 --> 00:20:30,761
which is to assume that being is 
acceptable and can be perfected and to 

335
00:20:30,761 --> 00:20:33,230
pursue that with truth and that you 
should embody that.

336
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:38,350
And then I would say that the purpose of
the representation we could call the 

337
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,860
mega fictions are archetypal 
representations,

338
00:20:39,861 --> 00:20:44,861
is to show that in embodied format so 
that it can be imitated rather than to 

339
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:51,370
transform into something that's diluted 
in some sense to to an abstract 

340
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:55,771
rationality.
Because I don't think the abstract 

341
00:20:55,771 --> 00:20:56,890
rationality in itself has enough flesh 
on it so to speak.

342
00:20:56,891 --> 00:20:59,620
Which is partly why in the Christian 
ethic,

343
00:20:59,621 --> 00:21:04,621
there's an emphasis that the word which 
is something roughly akin to 

344
00:21:04,621 --> 00:21:04,621
rationality,
has to make,

345
00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:07,120
has to be made flesh.
It has to be enacted,

346
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:12,230
but is the.
Is the flesh made of dogmatism and 

347
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:17,300
superstition and other worldliness?
Is that part of what gives it its shape 

348
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:22,251
and necessity?
I think traditionally historically it 

349
00:21:22,251 --> 00:21:25,161
has been,
and that's been the problem with 

350
00:21:25,161 --> 00:21:25,161
religion.
If you,

351
00:21:25,161 --> 00:21:28,731
if you denude it,
of everything that is unjustifiable and 

352
00:21:28,731 --> 00:21:30,660
the light of 21st century science and 
rationality,

353
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:36,260
I think what you have to get down to is 
something quite a bit more universal and

354
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,880
less provincial than any specific 
religion and Christianity per se.

355
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,300
Well,
it's interesting too though,

356
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,320
you know,
one of the.

357
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:50,560
One of the things,
one of the points that you do make is 

358
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,141
that you do appeal to or assume the 
existence of a transcendental internal 

359
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,210
ethics.
Something like that.

360
00:21:59,211 --> 00:22:00,620
Which I would say,
by the way,

361
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,790
since we're going down this direction,
seems to me to be something very akin to

362
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:09,791
the idea of the Holy Spirit,
which is something like the internal 

363
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:11,690
representation of a transcendent 
universal ethic.

364
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,840
Now remember,
I'm trying to strip these concepts of 

365
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,181
their metaphysical substrate.
I'm not making a case at the moment for 

366
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:19,820
the existence of the great man in the 
sky.

367
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:21,200
We can.
We can get to that later.

368
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,440
I'm saying that what seems to be the 
case is that we have underneath our 

369
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,061
cognitive architecture and our social 
architecture a layer of symbolic and 

370
00:22:31,061 --> 00:22:34,991
dramatic narrative representation that 
instantiates the same concepts but but 

371
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,360
in a,
in a,

372
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,720
in a multidimensional context.

373
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,870
One of the things we talked about in 
Vancouver for example,

374
00:22:41,871 --> 00:22:46,871
is that the religious enterprise doesn't
only emphasize rationality it.

375
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:53,620
It brings music into the play and it 
brings art into the play and it brings 

376
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:58,181
drama and it brings literature and it 
brings architecture and it brings the 

377
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,390
organizing of of cities around a central
space like it.

378
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,580
It's,
it's pushing itself.

379
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:09,670
It's manifesting itself across multiple 
dimensions of human existence 

380
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:13,421
simultaneously.
And to me that gives it a richness that 

381
00:23:13,421 --> 00:23:16,760
cannot be diluted without loss and and,
and also a motive power that,

382
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:20,600
that appear appeal to rationality I 
don't think can manage,

383
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:25,601
and this is c,
one of the things and this is maybe a 

384
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:25,601
good place for Douglas,
delete B and c,

385
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:25,730
what?
One of the things that Douglas,

386
00:23:25,731 --> 00:23:30,731
who's claimed upon multiple locations to
be an atheist and I don't know how he's 

387
00:23:30,731 --> 00:23:31,730
feeling about that and at the present 
time,

388
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,970
but it doesn't matter if one of the 
things.

389
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:40,210
One of the things Doug Douglas has has 
pointed out was that there are things 

390
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:45,610
that we've done in free countries,
let's say broadly speaking in the West 

391
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:46,490
that are worth protecting

392
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,690
and that in order to protect them in the
longest sense,

393
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,250
it's conceivable that we need a,
a,

394
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:58,350
a cognitive structure.
Something like that that can act as a 

395
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:02,960
bulwark against those forces that would 
seek to undermine and destroy it.

396
00:24:02,961 --> 00:24:06,200
And Douglas has been driven,
I would say to some degree,

397
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:11,410
to hypothesize that for Christianity,
for all its faults,

398
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:16,990
or we could say Judeo Christianity to 
broaden it for all its faults might 

399
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:20,501
provide something approximating that 
bowl work if we could only figure out 

400
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,760
how to utilize it properly.
So

401
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:24,520
yes,

402
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:36,620
I mean one of my problems on this is 
that it seems that we are where we are 

403
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:39,480
with belief in whether we wish it to be 
or not.

404
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:43,680
We cannot believe as our predecessors 
believed,

405
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:48,480
even if we wanted to.
We know too much more now and it puts us

406
00:24:48,481 --> 00:24:53,481
in this very difficult position.
But to denude also as if the entire 

407
00:24:54,631 --> 00:24:58,890
story seems to me to be a fool's errand 
for the set of reasons.

408
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,250
One of which is that from a lot of 
travel,

409
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:05,910
a lot of speaking to people from all 
around the well,

410
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:09,750
it doesn't seem at all obvious to me 
that what we have in countries like this

411
00:25:09,751 --> 00:25:13,520
one is the default position of human 
beings.

412
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,960
In fact,
it's likes me as being very rare order,

413
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:22,070
even political order,
political liberalism,

414
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,860
political freedom.
Very,

415
00:25:24,861 --> 00:25:29,861
very unusual things.
And if you like the things that helped 

416
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,060
to get through that with all of the 
caveats,

417
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:36,530
with all the caveats we can,
we could fau in all evening and it's not

418
00:25:36,531 --> 00:25:38,450
the only thing that got us there 
obviously.

419
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:42,260
But if you'd like broadly speaking,
where we are,

420
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:47,950
you've got to be very suspicious at the 
very least of saying the whole story is 

421
00:25:47,991 --> 00:25:49,760
no good.
We don't need the story.

422
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,710
We can move on.
I quote,

423
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,590
I'm quite often the radical theologian 
Don Cupitt,

424
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:59,620
who was often described as an atheist 
priest and cupid.

425
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,420
So somewhere in a recent book he said,
you know,

426
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,000
we can't help it.
He said,

427
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:09,070
for instance,
the dreams that we dream is still 

428
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,850
Christian dreams.
Whether we like that fact or not,

429
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,720
and without being able to believe 
myself.

430
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:16,790
Does that mean not being able to be a 
literal believer?

431
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:24,040
I worry.
I worry about what happens when the 

432
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,240
square is denuded completely.
And that's why this discussion tonight 

433
00:26:28,791 --> 00:26:32,180
and Youtube in particular are right on 
the cusp of this because this is.

434
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:37,600
This is where I think a lot of us are.
Even if we really wanted to believe,

435
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,970
we basically can't apply that we very 
quickly.

436
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:46,630
That's why I think there's an additional
just to refine my previous point to use 

437
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:50,721
them.
That's why there's this additional 

438
00:26:50,721 --> 00:26:52,791
thing.
I think there is a fear which you may 

439
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:52,791
have,
which I also have,

440
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:55,680
which is if there's a risk that even 
what I've just said,

441
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,160
nevermind what Jordan has also say 
there's a risk.

442
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:04,161
I think some people feel that your going
to soften up the somehow and that even 

443
00:27:05,431 --> 00:27:09,390
if neither Jordan nor I are going to 
suddenly start Jesus smuggling,

444
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,970
we might create the conditions that make
it easier for someone else to do that.

445
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,150
Yeah.
Is that a fair?

446
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,500
Yeah,
and it it.

447
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,700
It is.

448
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,410
No photos.
It's very frustrating,

449
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,740
so thank you.

450
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:39,520
Let me see if I can sharpen up what my 
concern actually is here because it's 

451
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,311
not even true to say that I think you 
need to get rid of the Jesus story or 

452
00:27:43,311 --> 00:27:48,111
even or even not.
Hey,

453
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:53,530
I'd be.
I don't even think there's something 

454
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,510
problematic with orienting your life 
around the Jesus Story.

455
00:27:54,511 --> 00:27:57,630
I think that that can be reclaimed,
but so for instance,

456
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:02,640
I was walking yesterday in this fine 
city of yours and saw someone on the 

457
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,551
sidewalk giving Taro readings to people 
he had with a Taro deck spread out.

458
00:28:08,671 --> 00:28:11,400
He had a few cards spread out and he was
soliciting people.

459
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:11,660
And,
and,

460
00:28:11,661 --> 00:28:12,500
and,
uh,

461
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,190
I'm sorry to say I didn't sit for a 
reading,

462
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,630
but to Tarot cards,
if you're familiar with them,

463
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:23,230
are the quintessential artifact of new 
age woo,

464
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:23,660
right?
Um,

465
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:28,661
there,
these are not thought of as legitimate 

466
00:28:28,661 --> 00:28:31,581
tools of divination except by people who
think that they're legitimate tools of 

467
00:28:31,581 --> 00:28:31,680
divination.

468
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:37,740
And yet a tarot reading can be truly 
powerful,

469
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:38,700
right?
I mean,

470
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,100
this is built on something,
right?

471
00:28:41,101 --> 00:28:45,190
This is not just a massive,
uh,

472
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,360
example of self deception on the part of
people reading and people getting their 

473
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,930
cards read it.
These cards can seem pressured.

474
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:59,150
I could give you all are reading right 
now and 95 percent of you would find 

475
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:05,391
what I would,
what the cards would say to be relevant 

476
00:29:05,391 --> 00:29:05,391
to your lives.
I mean,

477
00:29:05,391 --> 00:29:09,591
I could do it with an imaginary deck.
I don't even I in invisible imaginary 

478
00:29:09,591 --> 00:29:09,720
deck,
I don't know anything about Tarot cards,

479
00:29:09,721 --> 00:29:14,721
but I'm going to turn over to cards now.
One is the son and the other is the 

480
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:18,030
fallen man.
Now I know so little about Taro than I'm

481
00:29:18,031 --> 00:29:23,031
not even sure the fallen man is a 
terrible part or I think it was the 

482
00:29:23,031 --> 00:29:23,150
hanged man isn't terrible.

483
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,940
Okay,
so I've got these two cards and you know

484
00:29:26,941 --> 00:29:30,150
the sun is clearly the representation of
wisdom,

485
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:30,930
right?
And the and the.

486
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:34,440
The hanged man is the is the 
representation of,

487
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:39,441
of lost opportunity.
And I can tell you with some degree of 

488
00:29:39,441 --> 00:29:42,951
certainty that all of you are at a 
crossroads in your life where you have,

489
00:29:43,391 --> 00:29:48,391
you have good reason to believe that 
you're not making the most of your 

490
00:29:48,391 --> 00:29:52,321
opportunities right now.
I could go on like this for an hour and 

491
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,220
pretend all the wild that it has 
something to do with the car.

492
00:29:57,221 --> 00:30:02,221
It's actually been working in concert 
with the dynamics of the cosmos such 

493
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:06,280
that these cards that I turn over,
were they real,

494
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,790
would be the ones that Dave of 
necessity.

495
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:14,791
When revealing something about your mind
in this moment and obviously people 

496
00:30:14,791 --> 00:30:18,661
think in these terms about astrology and
sympathetic magic and all the rest and 

497
00:30:18,731 --> 00:30:21,910
religion is built upon this kind of 
superstition,

498
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:27,210
there is a way of understanding the 
utility of using a device like this and 

499
00:30:28,211 --> 00:30:33,211
the real effect it has on you.
I mean if I turn over the cards and ask 

500
00:30:33,211 --> 00:30:37,081
you to look at your life in this moment 
as though for the first time through 

501
00:30:37,081 --> 00:30:41,371
this lens,
considering in this case lost 

502
00:30:41,371 --> 00:30:41,371
opportunities,
right?

503
00:30:41,371 --> 00:30:44,440
Of course it's going to be valid.
That doesn't make.

504
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:47,440
It could be an incredibly useful thing 
to do.

505
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:52,940
The My.
My main concern is that at no point you 

506
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:56,620
have to lie to yourself about your state
of knowledge about the mechanism,

507
00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:01,830
right?
You don't have to believe Taro cards 

508
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:01,830
really.

509
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,890
There's deeper,
deeper mechanisms at work with someone 

510
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:06,560
who's actually good at that and so I 
agree with what you said,

511
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:07,940
but they need not be super nice.

512
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,000
No,
I don't think they are supernatural and 

513
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,891
in fact I think what happens when you 
use a projective technique like that 

514
00:31:14,891 --> 00:31:18,311
because that's essentially what it is.
If I'm good at interpersonal attunement 

515
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:21,080
and I'm quite intuitive what I'm going 
to do this and everyone does this in the

516
00:31:21,081 --> 00:31:23,750
course of a dialogue that's actually 
working well,

517
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:30,220
I'm going to flip over the cards and I'm
going to start with generic archetipal 

518
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:33,611
statements that are,
that are true in some sense for 

519
00:31:33,611 --> 00:31:36,341
everyone,
but then I'm going to watch you both 

520
00:31:36,341 --> 00:31:38,651
consciously and implicitly,
unconsciously with all of my social 

521
00:31:38,651 --> 00:31:40,040
intelligence and I'm going to see 
through very,

522
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:45,160
very subtle signs on your part when you 
respond positively to what I'm saying 

523
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:49,370
and when you respond negatively,
and I'm going to continue down the lines

524
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,560
that you established by your positive 
responses.

525
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:53,800
Brown does.
He's a mentalist,

526
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:53,900
right?

527
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:58,920
Well,
it's exactly what happens when children 

528
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:58,920
are interviewed,
for example,

529
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,050
by people who lead them as witnesses,
right?

530
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:04,051
The children infer from the emotional 
expressions of the person who's 

531
00:32:04,051 --> 00:32:06,790
interrogating them what it is that they 
actually want to hear,

532
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,590
and so they'll have even worked with 
that horse.

533
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,860
Clever Hans.
Exactly.

534
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:10,960
That's right.
Exactly.

535
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:15,980
Even horses can do this,
so carol card readers can definitely do 

536
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:15,980
this.
So,

537
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,470
so,
so,

538
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:21,590
so,
so the mechanisms behind something like 

539
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:24,871
that,
even if it appears entirely 

540
00:32:24,871 --> 00:32:26,371
superstitious on the surface,
are often deeper than it is revealed at 

541
00:32:26,371 --> 00:32:26,371
first approximation.
So,

542
00:32:26,371 --> 00:32:29,200
and I wanted to talk a little bit,
if you don't mind,

543
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,630
for a minute about rationality because

544
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,620
the,
the,

545
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,220
we've already agreed,
I think definitely stop me if I'm wrong,

546
00:32:38,221 --> 00:32:43,221
that there has to be an intermediary 
mechanism between the world of facts in 

547
00:32:43,221 --> 00:32:44,540
the world of values.
And well,

548
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:49,570
since we've talked,
I've been reading a variety of 

549
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:52,181
commentaries on Emmanuel Kant.
Mostly these are been written by Roger 

550
00:32:52,181 --> 00:32:55,670
Scruton by the way,
and this is actually the issue that they

551
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,760
can't,
um,

552
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:01,130
what obsessed about for most of his 
philosophical life.

553
00:33:01,131 --> 00:33:06,131
And what he concluded was that 
empiricism can't be right in 

554
00:33:06,131 --> 00:33:10,001
rationality,
can't be right as philosophical 

555
00:33:10,001 --> 00:33:12,371
disciplines because you need an 
intermediary structure that we have an 

556
00:33:12,371 --> 00:33:16,061
inbuilt intermediary structure.
And that structure is what mediates 

557
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:17,270
between the thing in itself.
The world of facts,

558
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:19,190
let's say,
and the outputs,

559
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,290
the values.
So then I was thinking

560
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,930
the truth is we don't quite agree on 
this in my summary of your view of me.

561
00:33:25,931 --> 00:33:30,931
I would have agreed with that,
but for me it's just facts all the way 

562
00:33:30,931 --> 00:33:30,931
down.
One cares.

563
00:33:30,931 --> 00:33:32,500
You're great.
You're describing glad.

564
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:33,850
Glad to hear it,
man.

565
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,160
Why do you need a brain then?
Well,

566
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:40,120
but brandon is yet another part of 
reality.

567
00:33:40,121 --> 00:33:44,620
And what I mean by a fact,
do anything there.

568
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:48,000
What does the brain do?
It has to do something because otherwise

569
00:33:48,001 --> 00:33:48,840
you don't need it.

570
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,380
Sure,
it does a lot.

571
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:55,340
But the,
the uh,

572
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:59,150
so your concern,
I did it to jump to the other,

573
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:04,190
where I think we're going in this 
conversation is how is it that values 

574
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:08,150
can be another order of fact that seems 
problematic to you.

575
00:34:08,151 --> 00:34:10,190
It seems problematic.
It's problematic to David Hume.

576
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:15,220
Well,
it's problematic for me for technical 

577
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:15,220
reasons,

578
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,420
which is that in order to app and we see
if we agree on this in order to perceive

579
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:25,170
and to act,
which I believe are both acts of value,

580
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:30,010
to perceive as an active value because 
you have to look at something instead of

581
00:34:30,011 --> 00:34:35,011
a bunch of other things,
so you have you elevate the thing that 

582
00:34:35,011 --> 00:34:37,750
you're perceiving to the position of 
highest value by perceiving it,

583
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,130
by deciding to perceive it.

584
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:44,350
Okay.
That gets translated in my brain into 

585
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,050
just more facts.
You're just giving me the facts of human

586
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:48,000
perception.
That's fine.

587
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,070
No,
that's no problem.

588
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:52,750
I'm perfectly happy about that.
And then in order to act,

589
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:57,780
you have to select the target of action 
from among an infinite number near 

590
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,921
infinite number,
close enough of possible mechanisms of 

591
00:35:01,921 --> 00:35:05,911
action.
And so what a biological organism does 

592
00:35:05,911 --> 00:35:08,080
is take the facts and translate them 
into perception and action.

593
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:13,470
And the only organisms that do that with
one to one mapping are organisms that 

594
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,860
are composed of sensory motor cells,
like sponges,

595
00:35:17,861 --> 00:35:22,861
marine sponges,
which are composed of sensory motor 

596
00:35:22,861 --> 00:35:24,961
cells.
They don't have an intermediary nervous 

597
00:35:24,961 --> 00:35:24,961
system,
so what they do is they sit in the water

598
00:35:24,961 --> 00:35:29,521
and they make a sponge.
They're so simple that if you grind a 

599
00:35:29,521 --> 00:35:29,680
sponge through a sieve and in salt 
water,

600
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:33,070
it'll reorganize itself into the sponge,
so that's quite cool.

601
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,960
The sponge sits in the water.

602
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,900
Don't do that,
and what it does,

603
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:38,160
what

604
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,340
it does is it there's waves on it and so
it.

605
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,240
Those are patterns and then the sponge 
opens and closes,

606
00:35:45,241 --> 00:35:48,120
pours on its surface in response to 
those patterns.

607
00:35:48,121 --> 00:35:53,121
So it maps the pattern of the waves 
right onto its behavior with no 

608
00:35:53,121 --> 00:35:56,280
intermediary of a nervous system,
but it can only map waves.

609
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:59,130
That's all it can do,
and it can only open and close pores.

610
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:04,190
That's it.
So it does one to one factor value 

611
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:04,830
mapping.
Now what happens is that as the,

612
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:08,430
as the complexity of a biological 
organism increases,

613
00:36:08,431 --> 00:36:11,520
two things happen.
The first thing that happens is that the

614
00:36:11,521 --> 00:36:16,521
sensory and motor cells differentiate.
So now the organism has sensory cells 

615
00:36:16,521 --> 00:36:20,280
and motorcycle.
So since senses to detect and census,

616
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:23,430
sorry,
cells to detect and cells to act.

617
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,380
Okay?
So then it can do,

618
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:30,410
it can detect more patterns because it's
more sophisticated at the sensory port 

619
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:33,950
perspective and it could do more things 
because it has specialized motor 

620
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,610
systems,
but then what happens is that as it gets

621
00:36:35,611 --> 00:36:40,611
even more complex,
then it puts an intermediary structure 

622
00:36:40,611 --> 00:36:44,211
of nervous tissue in there and that 
structure increases in the number of 

623
00:36:44,211 --> 00:36:44,211
layers of neurons.

624
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,280
And what that means is that as soon as 
that happens and as the sensory cells 

625
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,710
become more specialized and as the motor
output cells become more specialized,

626
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:58,490
many more patterns can be detected.
Those are roughly equivalent to facts 

627
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:01,050
and many more motor outputs can be 
manifested,

628
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:06,110
but a tremendous number of calculations 
have to has to occur in that 

629
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:10,371
intermediary nervous tissue.
And that's the structure that I'm 

630
00:37:10,371 --> 00:37:13,521
talking about.
That structure exists and it translates 

631
00:37:13,521 --> 00:37:16,731
the patterns into motor output and it 
doesn't do it on a one to one basis 

632
00:37:16,731 --> 00:37:17,880
because there are more patterns,
more facts.

633
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:22,050
Then there are motor outputs.
So what has to happen is this tremendous

634
00:37:22,051 --> 00:37:27,051
plethora of facts that surrounds us has 
to be filtered to the point where you 

635
00:37:27,051 --> 00:37:29,200
pick a single action because you can't 
act,

636
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:34,250
act otherwise,
and so the mechanism that reduces the 

637
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:37,671
number of facts to the selected action 
is the mechanism that mediates between 

638
00:37:37,671 --> 00:37:40,740
facts and values.
And it's not simply in and of itself.

639
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:46,370
It's a fact that that exists.
But it isn't a simple that what it does 

640
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,870
isn't the simple fact you can't do.
You can't explain it.

641
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:50,550
You can't understand it.
Why not?

642
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:55,580
Why not?
For the same reason that you can't look 

643
00:37:55,590 --> 00:38:00,590
for the same reason,
for the same reason that you don't know 

644
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:03,651
what a neural network is doing,
like you can train a neural network and 

645
00:38:03,651 --> 00:38:03,651
network.
There's

646
00:38:03,651 --> 00:38:08,100
a distinction between facts and facts 
that we know right there.

647
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:10,450
There is whatever it is the case,
right?

648
00:38:10,451 --> 00:38:13,210
And then there's our understanding of it
and our misunderstanding of it.

649
00:38:13,211 --> 00:38:17,140
So there are many things that we think 
we know that we're wrong about.

650
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:22,030
There are many things that we are aware 
we're ignorant of and there's this,

651
00:38:22,031 --> 00:38:27,031
there's this larger always this larger 
space of reality that we're struggling 

652
00:38:27,031 --> 00:38:31,120
to engage with and it may in fact be the
case that in evolutionary terms,

653
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:36,250
but we know it's the case that we're.
We have not evolved to understand large 

654
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,290
perfectly.
That's not the sort of monkeys we are.

655
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:41,860
Right,
and you could even argue that one,

656
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:46,950
one cognitive scientist who some of you 
may have heard of Donald Hoffman is 

657
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:51,211
arguing now know very colorfully that 
human consciousness or the human mind 

658
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:56,790
is,
is actually evolved to get things wrong 

659
00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:00,991
in a fairly specific ways so that so as 
to maximize survival.

660
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,290
And that was the argument I made in our 
first discussion.

661
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:05,620
No,
but,

662
00:39:05,621 --> 00:39:10,621
but,
but here was not quite because there's 

663
00:39:10,621 --> 00:39:13,891
still.
This still preserves the difference 

664
00:39:13,891 --> 00:39:13,891
between getting things right and getting
things wrong.

665
00:39:13,891 --> 00:39:13,891
He,
his,

666
00:39:13,891 --> 00:39:16,510
his argument is that getting things 
truly right,

667
00:39:16,511 --> 00:39:21,511
having a nervous system and a cognitive 
architecture that could really 

668
00:39:21,511 --> 00:39:24,190
understand reality quote reality as it 
is,

669
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:29,850
would be maladaptive and he has some.
He has some mathematical demonstration 

670
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:30,580
of this that,
that,

671
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,260
that,
that the,

672
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,580
the true,
the quote,

673
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:38,581
true representations of reality are 
categorically maladaptive and you had 

674
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,870
that there's certain kind of error that 
is,

675
00:39:40,871 --> 00:39:42,430
and I'm not,
I'm not sure I buy this argument,

676
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,680
but the fact that you can make this 
argument,

677
00:39:44,681 --> 00:39:49,681
the fact that you can differentiate the 
adaptively useful misunderstandings 

678
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,170
versus a true understanding,
that it's maladaptive.

679
00:39:56,171 --> 00:40:01,171
The fact that we can even talk about 
that demonstrates to me that we have 

680
00:40:01,171 --> 00:40:05,800
this larger picture of what is in fact 
true whether we know it or not,

681
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:10,860
and this is what this is what religion 
get so catastrophic.

682
00:40:12,011 --> 00:40:16,000
The wrong religion gives you some other 
mechanism whereby,

683
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:19,620
whereby to Orient Yourself in this case 
revelation,

684
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:23,840
does religion does provide those,
those functional simplifications

685
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:27,650
actually a similar purpose.
There are simplifications appropriate to

686
00:40:27,651 --> 00:40:29,310
the Iron Age?
Well,

687
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,470
some of that,

688
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:35,990
some of them are for sure,
and that's why we have to have this 

689
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:36,290
discussion because,
because mirror,

690
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,930
mirror revelation in mere tradition is 
insufficient.

691
00:40:38,931 --> 00:40:43,931
And I,
I truly believe that we can agree on 

692
00:40:43,931 --> 00:40:46,121
that.
But back to the back to the biological 

693
00:40:46,121 --> 00:40:46,121
argument.
So,

694
00:40:46,121 --> 00:40:49,790
um,
because I thought that tonight I would 

695
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,310
make a very strictly biological argument
is that so now the question is now,

696
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:56,320
so now you've got your sensory systems 
that are detecting the world of facts 

697
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:59,531
and you have your motor output system,
which is a very narrow channel because 

698
00:40:59,531 --> 00:41:02,321
you can only do one thing at a time.
And that's one of the things about 

699
00:41:02,321 --> 00:41:02,720
consciousness that's quite strange.
It's a very,

700
00:41:02,721 --> 00:41:07,721
very narrow channel.
So you have to take this unbelievably 

701
00:41:07,721 --> 00:41:10,211
complex world and you have to channel it
into this very narrow channel and you,

702
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,770
you don't do that by being wrong about 
the world,

703
00:41:12,771 --> 00:41:17,771
but you do do that by ignoring a lot of 
the world and by using representations 

704
00:41:17,771 --> 00:41:22,181
that are no more complicated than they 
have to be in order to attain the task 

705
00:41:22,181 --> 00:41:22,181
at hand.

706
00:41:22,181 --> 00:41:25,520
It's like you're losing using low 
resolution representations of the world.

707
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:30,580
They're not inaccurate because a low 
resolution representations of the world 

708
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,180
isn't inaccurate any more than a low 
resolution photo is.

709
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,660
But there are no resolution than they 
need to be in order for you to undertake

710
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:40,661
the task at hand.
And if you undertake the task at hand 

711
00:41:40,661 --> 00:41:40,820
and that goes successfully,
then what you've done,

712
00:41:40,821 --> 00:41:43,370
and this is basically the essence of 
American pragmatism,

713
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:48,700
what you've done is validated the you've
validated the validity of your 

714
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,170
simplifications.
So if the tool you have in hand is good,

715
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,100
if the ax you have in hand is sharp 
enough to chop down the tree,

716
00:41:55,190 --> 00:42:00,190
that it's a good enough acts and that's 
part of the way that we define truth 

717
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,970
pragmatically in the absence of infinite
knowledge about everything.

718
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:07,360
Okay?
So now you build up this nervous system 

719
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:07,360
between the world of facts and the world
of values and it,

720
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:12,410
and it narrows the world of facts.
And the question then is how do you 

721
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:12,500
generate the mechanism that does that 
narrowing?

722
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:14,220
And this is what's useful.

723
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,970
That's not quite how the cake is 
layered.

724
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:20,240
What the facts are up here to write 
right?

725
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:25,450
For me to,
for me to even notice that you're a 

726
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:25,450
person,
right?

727
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:27,980
Or to attribute beliefs to you or to 
have a sense of being in relationship at

728
00:42:27,981 --> 00:42:32,981
all.
This is one of those higher order 

729
00:42:32,981 --> 00:42:35,150
interpretive acts based on a many 
layered nervous system.

730
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:37,060
Yes,
it's not only bought them up yet,

731
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:39,230
but yeah,
it's bottom up and top down.

732
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:42,170
Yes and and,
but fat.

733
00:42:42,171 --> 00:42:44,930
But facts are also on the top,
right?

734
00:42:44,931 --> 00:42:46,970
It's not that we have facts here and 
values here.

735
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,080
It's,
it's,

736
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:49,750
well,
I think what I'm trying to do,

737
00:42:49,751 --> 00:42:52,440
I can't get to a fag,
but through going to do.

738
00:42:52,441 --> 00:42:54,850
I think maybe one way of thinking about 
it,

739
00:42:54,851 --> 00:42:59,851
just that you,
you are using your positing that we can 

740
00:42:59,851 --> 00:43:02,280
use rationality as a mechanism for 
mediating between facts and values,

741
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,010
I believe because otherwise there's no 
use for rationality.

742
00:43:05,011 --> 00:43:06,030
We can just have the facts.

743
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,130
So it's a process even simpler than 
that.

744
00:43:08,131 --> 00:43:11,760
It's just that for me and I think for 
everyone,

745
00:43:11,761 --> 00:43:14,640
if they will only agree to use language 
in this way.

746
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:20,390
For me values are simply facts about the
experience of conscious creatures.

747
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:24,060
Good at that experiences give us our 
values.

748
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,750
Yeah,
but they're not simple,

749
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:28,360
but at there are the goods in the 
summer.

750
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,610
Very simple.
You have in your hand,

751
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,810
put it on a hot stove is incredibly 
simple and you'll notice it'll save your

752
00:43:34,811 --> 00:43:37,460
child if you do it well.
But again,

753
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:42,580
the unpleasantness of it.
Right now it's an orthogonal.

754
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:43,710
No,
it's not.

755
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:44,280
No,
it's not.

756
00:43:44,281 --> 00:43:47,400
If you look at the way the reward and 
punishment systems work in the brain,

757
00:43:47,401 --> 00:43:50,820
you can easily train an animal using 
reward to wag its tail.

758
00:43:50,821 --> 00:43:54,210
If it's being shocked electrically,
you can do that and you can wire it very

759
00:43:54,211 --> 00:43:54,560
loaded.

760
00:43:55,140 --> 00:44:00,140
There's a range of unpleasant 
experiences we can have where we can 

761
00:44:00,211 --> 00:44:02,670
construe them as pleasant or 
unnecessary.

762
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:07,760
Right?
And that's a kind of a higher level of 

763
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:07,890
theater.
But I'm talking about,

764
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:13,160
you know,
the worst possible sensory experience 

765
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,010
that all of us will agree,
we'll agree is unpleasant,

766
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:19,130
right?
That doesn't require a story too for us 

767
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:20,010
to feel a version two.
And there's,

768
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:25,030
there are many things like that in life 
that are just just rudimentary where 

769
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,190
it's just we are,
we are organized in such a way that

770
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,690
put put us into fire.
We don't like it.

771
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:33,790
So are you clear?
Are you claiming then like this is 

772
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:36,531
another problem.
This is where I think that the argument 

773
00:44:36,531 --> 00:44:39,090
that you make,
although accurate in its rudiments,

774
00:44:39,091 --> 00:44:44,091
let's say,
is insufficiently high resolution 

775
00:44:44,091 --> 00:44:46,251
because now it sounds to me like you're 
including the domain of quality 

776
00:44:46,251 --> 00:44:48,680
unquestioningly in the domain of facts.
Now you can do that,

777
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,310
but we need to know if that's what 
you're doing.

778
00:44:50,311 --> 00:44:52,590
Like what are these facts you're talking
about?

779
00:44:52,591 --> 00:44:57,591
Are they mirrored manifestations of the 
objective world or do they shade into 

780
00:44:57,591 --> 00:44:58,000
the subject?
There

781
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:03,010
are,
there are objective facts about 

782
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:04,310
subjective experience,
so I can make,

783
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:09,370
I can make true or false claims about 
your subjectivity and that you can make.

784
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:12,290
You can make those about your,
your own subjectivity,

785
00:45:12,291 --> 00:45:17,291
right?
You can be wrong about your own 

786
00:45:17,291 --> 00:45:17,291
subjectivity.
You're,

787
00:45:17,291 --> 00:45:18,590
we're not subjectively encourageable.
Uh,

788
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:23,680
and I,
I might've said this last time in 

789
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:23,680
Vancouver.
I mean,

790
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,630
the example I often use here is to 
speculate about what jfk was thinking.

791
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,000
The moment he got shot right is not a,
a completely vacuous exercise there.

792
00:45:35,201 --> 00:45:40,201
They're literally an infinite number of 
things we know he wasn't thinking right?

793
00:45:40,371 --> 00:45:43,390
So we can make claims about his 
conscious mind at,

794
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:45,080
at,
at that moment in history,

795
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:48,410
which are scientific a,
even though the data are unavailable,

796
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:53,470
right?
So many people get confused between 

797
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:55,040
having an answers and practice and 
there'd be an answers and principle.

798
00:45:55,041 --> 00:45:55,360
I mean,
there,

799
00:45:55,361 --> 00:46:00,361
there are many trivial fact based claims
we could make about reality where we 

800
00:46:01,611 --> 00:46:04,520
can't get the data,
but we know the data are there.

801
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:05,240
So,
you know,

802
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:08,480
do you have an even or odd number of 
hairs on your body at this moment?

803
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:09,350
You know,
we,

804
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:14,370
you know,
we don't want to think about what it 

805
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:14,370
would take to ascertain that fact,
right?

806
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:14,990
But there is a fact of the matter,
right?

807
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,900
And uh,
and so it is with anything but.

808
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:20,300
So what is somebody,
what does a person way?

809
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:25,600
There's many,
many facts are blurry because you are 

810
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:25,600
going to weigh,
weigh him down to the,

811
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,950
the 100th decimal plate place.
No.

812
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:32,951
So it's like at a certain point you are 
going to be rounding and someone's 

813
00:46:32,951 --> 00:46:37,391
weight at that point is changing every 
microsecond because they're exchanging 

814
00:46:37,391 --> 00:46:38,840
adams with the air.
So there's.

815
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:44,130
So there,
there are facts that can be loosely 

816
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:44,130
defined.
Uh,

817
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:48,310
this is still,
this is true of all of our subjective 

818
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:51,400
lives too.
So if it is a fact about you that when 

819
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,820
you,
when you were praying to Jesus,

820
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:56,030
you felt an upwelling of rapture,
right?

821
00:46:56,060 --> 00:47:01,060
Subjectively,
that can be an absolutely true thing to 

822
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:01,220
say about you.
We can,

823
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:04,420
we can pair that subject of experience 
with an understanding of,

824
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:08,660
of the neurophysiological basis for it.
Uh,

825
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:12,440
you can think about it in terms of a 
larger story about your life,

826
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:17,620
but all of this can be translated into a
fact based discussion about what's 

827
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:19,110
happening for you.
And my only claim is that,

828
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:24,150
that the value part,
and hence the ethics part relates to 

829
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:29,710
the,
the extremes of positive and negative 

830
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:30,250
experience that people have

831
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,550
not.
First of all,

832
00:47:32,551 --> 00:47:37,551
I wouldn't dispute.
I don't want to dispute the fact that 

833
00:47:37,551 --> 00:47:37,650
there are stable quality of pain and 
pleasure,

834
00:47:37,651 --> 00:47:42,651
for example.
And also that there are fundamental 

835
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:43,650
motivational systems that structure our 
perception.

836
00:47:43,651 --> 00:47:46,080
So as the nervous system increases in 
complexity,

837
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:51,410
these underlying nervous system 
subsections that produce these rather 

838
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,170
stable quality,
uh,

839
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:53,220
evolve,
hunger,

840
00:47:53,221 --> 00:47:54,720
thirst,
defensive aggression,

841
00:47:54,721 --> 00:47:56,880
sexuality,
all these subsystems that,

842
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:02,020
that,
that label experience with certain 

843
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:02,760
somewhat inviolable labels.
I understand that happens.

844
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:08,110
But the point that I'm trying to make 
here is I think to try to increase the,

845
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:13,670
what would you call the breadth of the 
conversation about how facts get 

846
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:15,240
translated into,
into values?

847
00:48:15,241 --> 00:48:19,500
Because it seems to me the other thing 
that your account doesn't take proper.

848
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:25,130
And this is what surprised me so much 
about your thinking when I first 

849
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:25,130
encountered it.
See,

850
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:29,250
I think the manner in which facts are 
translated into values is something that

851
00:48:29,251 --> 00:48:30,450
actually evolved.

852
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:33,330
And it evolved over three and a half 
billion years.

853
00:48:33,331 --> 00:48:34,920
The three and a half billion years of 
life.

854
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:40,070
And it built the nervous system from the
bottom up and it built this reducing 

855
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:43,521
mechanism that takes the infinite number
of facts and translates them into a 

856
00:48:43,521 --> 00:48:45,060
single value per action.
And it does that in layers.

857
00:48:45,061 --> 00:48:50,061
And so there is a relationship between 
the world of facts in the world of 

858
00:48:50,061 --> 00:48:50,370
values.
And there has to be,

859
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:55,400
but it isn't derival one to one in the 
confines of your single existence 

860
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,110
through pure rationality.
It's way more complicated than that

861
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:03,360
if there's more to it than rationality.
Again,

862
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:09,340
it's not rationality that causes you to 
remove your hand from a hot stove and 

863
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:13,871
it's not rationality that causes you to 
like the experience of love and bliss 

864
00:49:14,181 --> 00:49:19,181
and rapture and creativity over or more 
than pointless misery and despair.

865
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:26,780
Right?
So like things other than rationality 

866
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:26,780
are clearly necessary.
Absolutely.

867
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:31,700
But the question is,
do we ever have to be irrational to get 

868
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,160
the good things in life?
And I would argue that,

869
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:38,220
that the answer to that clearly no,
there's nothing irrational about loving 

870
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:44,150
your wife or your best friend or 
yourself or even a stranger if,

871
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:49,190
if,
if what you mean by love there is 

872
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:49,910
genuinely wanting happiness for that 
person,

873
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:53,000
genuinely taken pleasure in their 
company,

874
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:58,030
genuinely wanting to,
to find a way of being where you're,

875
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:03,140
you're no longer in a zero sum condition
with a stranger or with a partner,

876
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:03,920
but you're,
you're,

877
00:50:03,921 --> 00:50:08,921
uh,
collaborating together to have better 

878
00:50:08,921 --> 00:50:11,081
lives.
Seems rationality moves through that 

879
00:50:11,081 --> 00:50:13,910
situation continuously because 
rationality is the only way that you and

880
00:50:13,911 --> 00:50:16,760
I can get our representations of the 
world to cohere.

881
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:18,650
It's,
it's when I say,

882
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,120
okay,
there's,

883
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:24,170
there's a lion behind that rock.
Don't go over there that only that only 

884
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:28,931
makes sense to you if you're playing 
this rationality game it the way I'm 

885
00:50:28,931 --> 00:50:32,521
planted.
If I mean something else by lion or I 

886
00:50:32,521 --> 00:50:32,521
mean something else by don't go over 
there.

887
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:34,030
You know,
you're confused and,

888
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:36,080
and very likely did or not.

889
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:41,810
If we're,
if we're trying to establish the 

890
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:43,671
proposition that rationality is the 
mechanism by which we make our 

891
00:50:43,671 --> 00:50:45,330
worldviews cohere,
I would agree with that in part,

892
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:50,600
we also will make them cohere because 
we're actually biologically structured 

893
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,661
the same way.
And so there's a proclivity for them to 

894
00:50:53,661 --> 00:50:55,761
go here to begin with,
but we iron out our differences through 

895
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:55,761
the exercise.
I wouldn't call it rationality.

896
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,640
I would call it logos because I think 
it's a more,

897
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,530
it's a broader

898
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:04,980
were you smuggling energy's not 
unconscious of that.

899
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:09,110
Let's say as a point of order here,
I want to,

900
00:51:09,111 --> 00:51:09,910
uh,
I'm a,

901
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,950
I'm a disconcerted by Douglas is 
silence.

902
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:18,610
I want to pivot because I know,
I know how good he is when he actually 

903
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:18,610
speaks.
Uh,

904
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:24,130
so I want to pivot to another subject 
because we can return to this at some 

905
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:24,420
point we need to have before you pivot.
So yeah,

906
00:51:24,421 --> 00:51:24,740
go for it.

907
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:30,330
I mean,
having said to you what I think your 

908
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:31,720
concern is with Jordan,
Jordan's concerned,

909
00:51:31,721 --> 00:51:36,130
and I share this just as I share some of
your concerns expressed at the outset,

910
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:42,070
Jordan's fundamental concern.
It seems to me as a one I fundamentally 

911
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:46,591
share,
which is rationalism isn't enough and 

912
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:48,520
it's

913
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,170
put it another way,
but then let me finish.

914
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:57,900
Can you both show me where it,
where it's obviously insufficient like 

915
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:00,010
music,
but there's nothing but.

916
00:52:00,011 --> 00:52:05,011
But again,
so to say that it's not to say that 

917
00:52:05,011 --> 00:52:07,381
there's more to life than being rational
is not to say and perhaps never to say 

918
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:13,740
you need to run against rationality.
Need to be irrational in order to get 

919
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:13,740
something good.

920
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:15,190
Let me,
let me express it a different way.

921
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:20,460
Yeah,
we haven't tried the purely rational 

922
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:23,500
approach yet.
We haven't tried it for very long,

923
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:24,580
well,
many,

924
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:27,670
many of us had been trying for a couple 
of centuries at least,

925
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:31,620
which is a blip.
I mean the tiniest.at

926
00:52:31,621 --> 00:52:33,780
the end of human evolution.

927
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:37,210
So I think that a concern which Jordan 
hasn't said,

928
00:52:37,211 --> 00:52:42,211
any concern I have is if we try this,
we can think of all sorts of ways in 

929
00:52:43,771 --> 00:52:48,771
which you can go wrong if you take away 
all the supporting structure can think 

930
00:52:49,111 --> 00:52:54,111
of any number of ways in which you can 
go wrong and that I suppose that that's 

931
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:59,871
at the root of the concern about where 
you might be taking us or to put it 

932
00:53:00,691 --> 00:53:05,691
another way,
if we enter the world that you would 

933
00:53:05,691 --> 00:53:07,470
suggest not everyone may not necessarily
come out as Sam Harris.

934
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:13,270
Okay.
Give me one way where you think it can 

935
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:13,270
go wrong.
And again,

936
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:16,400
we can't forget your caveat which you 
started with.

937
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:18,520
What if you're not very smart,
right?

938
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,770
Well,
the person.

939
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:25,180
So then you're basically saying that the
stupid people need their myths.

940
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:27,470
We smart people onstage don't need that.

941
00:53:27,970 --> 00:53:28,650
Right?
Well,

942
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:30,510
I am actually,
I'm looked,

943
00:53:30,511 --> 00:53:32,890
I actually am saying that to some degree
that this look,

944
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:33,850
look,
if you're,

945
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:39,090
if you're,
if you're not exceptionally cognitively 

946
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:43,681
astute,
you should be traditional and 

947
00:53:43,681 --> 00:53:45,160
conservative because if you are,
if you can't think,

948
00:53:45,161 --> 00:53:50,161
well,
you're going to think badly and if you 

949
00:53:50,161 --> 00:53:50,161
think badly,
you're going to fall into trouble and so

950
00:53:50,161 --> 00:53:54,391
it is definitely the case and this has 
been an what would you call a cliche of 

951
00:53:54,391 --> 00:53:57,430
political belief for a long time.
If you're not very smart,

952
00:53:57,431 --> 00:54:02,431
it's better to be conservative because 
then you do what everyone else does and 

953
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:07,531
generally speaking,
doing what everyone else does is the 

954
00:54:07,531 --> 00:54:07,531
path of least error moving forward.
Now,

955
00:54:07,531 --> 00:54:10,320
that doesn't mean that rationality is 
unnecessary.

956
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:12,420
It doesn't mean that old conservatives 
astute,

957
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:13,900
headless.
It doesn't mean that either,

958
00:54:13,901 --> 00:54:14,830
right?
Precisely.

959
00:54:14,831 --> 00:54:16,360
It doesn't mean that Kevin,

960
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:17,510
but,
but all can,

961
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:22,540
all conservative structures are not the 
same either and that we have many 

962
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:25,970
warring and incompatible versions of 
being conservative.

963
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:26,910
True,
true,

964
00:54:26,911 --> 00:54:31,911
and this is exactly,
this is where rationality actually does 

965
00:54:31,911 --> 00:54:34,731
play a role.
Although I don't think it's best 

966
00:54:34,731 --> 00:54:34,731
conceptualized as rationality,
precisely.

967
00:54:34,731 --> 00:54:39,111
It's definitely the case that we tend to
take douglass point that we need to be 

968
00:54:40,501 --> 00:54:45,501
bound by our traditions,
but we need to be judicious in their 

969
00:54:45,501 --> 00:54:47,700
representation and update and we have to
do both

970
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,410
the dialogue on religion.
This is what he says.

971
00:54:51,411 --> 00:54:54,020
He says,
he describes the tragedy of the clergy.

972
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:56,900
He pretty much,
he pretty much says,

973
00:54:57,290 --> 00:54:59,300
look,
if they don't believe it,

974
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,520
they recognize it's a very useful 
metaphor,

975
00:55:01,521 --> 00:55:06,521
but they don't need to believe it.
It's they tell it and he says the 

976
00:55:06,521 --> 00:55:09,140
tragedy of the clergy is they can never 
admit that what they're saying is just a

977
00:55:09,141 --> 00:55:09,710
metaphor.

978
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:14,990
Right?
So just before or after he threw his 

979
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:14,990
housekeeper down the stairs,
look,

980
00:55:14,990 --> 00:55:17,670
we can all find flaws.
We all have skeletons in our closet.

981
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:18,940
Yeah.

982
00:55:19,070 --> 00:55:20,480
Um,
but the,

983
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,040
but the,
the,

984
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:27,160
there is a way in which religion is what
he describes his philosophy for the 

985
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:31,871
masses and that if you recognize that 
most people are not gonna spend their 

986
00:55:31,871 --> 00:55:35,351
lives studying philosophy,
they're not going to be reading about 

987
00:55:35,351 --> 00:55:36,590
the differences between live Nixon comp 
that religion has to do.

988
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:42,310
Now,
I'm not saying that I agree with that 

989
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:42,310
particularly,
but there's a heck of an argument within

990
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:44,330
the which a lot of people will be living
their lives in.

991
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:49,630
I don't think it's a good argument if 
you recall or I just imagine what it's 

992
00:55:50,991 --> 00:55:53,390
like to be a child,
especially from the perspective of being

993
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:58,391
a parent.
I have two young girls and they,

994
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:02,130
you know,
they're very smart young girl.

995
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,250
They're smart,
but you know,

996
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:05,840
one of them is four and a half years old
and those almost nothing.

997
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:11,080
Right?
So she knows what I and my wife and our 

998
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:14,010
society tell her at some level.
I mean,

999
00:56:14,011 --> 00:56:19,011
at what point is she going to think for 
herself about these fundamental 

1000
00:56:19,011 --> 00:56:19,850
questions?
And I mean she again,

1001
00:56:19,851 --> 00:56:24,851
she's,
she's currently spending half the day 

1002
00:56:24,851 --> 00:56:24,851
dressed up like batgirl or cat woman.
Right?

1003
00:56:24,851 --> 00:56:29,790
So if I told her that these superheroes 
were real,

1004
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:33,830
she would believe that for the longest 
time and if she,

1005
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:38,870
if we lived in a cult that thought they 
were real or a whole society that by 

1006
00:56:38,870 --> 00:56:43,291
dint of its geographic or linguistic 
isolation managed to maintain a 

1007
00:56:43,291 --> 00:56:46,810
conversation about,
in this case batgirl and catwoman,

1008
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:52,500
that they were real and that it was 
absolutely important to honor them and 

1009
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:53,680
you'd burn in hell if you fail to do 
this,

1010
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:54,780
but this would be.

1011
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,020
We would be meeting fully grown adults 
who believed this sort of thing,

1012
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:00,370
but it seems to me,
Sam,

1013
00:57:00,371 --> 00:57:02,980
that you bring up the superhero thing 
quite a bit.

1014
00:57:02,981 --> 00:57:05,780
So I think I'll go to that directly so 
that I want.

1015
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,750
I love superheroes so well.
So.

1016
00:57:07,751 --> 00:57:08,110
So

1017
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:13,300
you make the case in a moral landscape 
that they're an ideal is real because 

1018
00:57:14,721 --> 00:57:18,170
the ideal that you define an ideal is 
real and the ideal is whatever.

1019
00:57:18,171 --> 00:57:20,510
Maximize wellbeing and gets us away from
hell.

1020
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:25,690
You said not only is that real,
you also say that's the fundamental 

1021
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:26,240
axiom.
That's the claim in the moral landscape.

1022
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:29,540
So you do make a claim that there is a 
real ideal,

1023
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:30,050
and

1024
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,770
I wouldn't necessarily put it that way,
but there's a real.

1025
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,910
We are in a circumstance where things 
can't matter,

1026
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:43,300
right?
We consciousness is the key is the 

1027
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,461
condition in which things can matter,
where there can be a range of 

1028
00:57:45,461 --> 00:57:46,490
experiences,
some of which are very,

1029
00:57:46,491 --> 00:57:49,070
very bad.
If the word bad means anything,

1030
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,830
they're bad and some of which are very,
very good.

1031
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:56,890
If the,
if the word good means anything and we 

1032
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,811
are navigating in that space,
we can't help it navigate it or seek to 

1033
00:57:58,811 --> 00:58:00,800
navigate in that space.
And religion is one.

1034
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:02,930
Okay,
we'll look more of a conversation.

1035
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:08,370
That navigation problem and I would 
argue and go back to the idea that 

1036
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:08,430
diluted one like Jordan rose

1037
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:12,680
sleeves up that girl,
we mean business now,

1038
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:17,540
but that girl in cat woman are 
approximations to a higher ideal.

1039
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:18,760
That's what they are.

1040
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,540
And and do attendance with a biblical 
idea.

1041
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:26,780
I'm,
I'm fairly sure if person there are a 

1042
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:29,120
lot of parents are perfectly content 
with bringing their children up vaguely 

1043
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:33,471
within the story they've inherited and 
at some point the children realize that 

1044
00:58:33,471 --> 00:58:37,461
the fairy doesn't bring them money when 
their teeth fall out and at some point 

1045
00:58:37,461 --> 00:58:38,730
maybe around the same time or a bit 
later,

1046
00:58:38,731 --> 00:58:41,820
they discovered the Santa Claus doesn't 
really come down the chimney and at some

1047
00:58:41,821 --> 00:58:46,821
point they realized that actually the 
whole religious thing is a kind of 

1048
00:58:46,821 --> 00:58:49,611
metaphor,
but he's got them through the formative 

1049
00:58:49,611 --> 00:58:51,441
years in some way,
often with terrible damage along the 

1050
00:58:51,441 --> 00:58:51,441
way.
I can see that,

1051
00:58:51,441 --> 00:58:52,140
but also with something else,
and I'm.

1052
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:57,230
I'm struck by the number of people,
and this is why I share some of what I 

1053
00:58:57,230 --> 00:58:58,020
think is Jordan's concerned about the 
possibility of the world.

1054
00:58:58,021 --> 00:59:01,710
You're envisaging,
which is I can think of a lot of parents

1055
00:59:01,711 --> 00:59:06,711
now,
my country and other countries as well 

1056
00:59:06,711 --> 00:59:06,711
who I'm just very struck.

1057
00:59:06,711 --> 00:59:10,560
They themselves a kind of baby boomer or
sixties atheists,

1058
00:59:11,010 --> 00:59:11,970
humanists,
whatever,

1059
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:14,010
and I start to notice,
for instance,

1060
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:18,450
that they're enrolling their children in
Christian schools and I saved them.

1061
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:23,600
Why are you doing this?
And they have fairly coherent arguments 

1062
00:59:23,931 --> 00:59:25,940
along the way with the lines.
That one I just had,

1063
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:31,210
look,
I don't particularly believe this 

1064
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:33,311
myself,
but I think it's a pretty good way to 

1065
00:59:33,311 --> 00:59:33,860
bring up the kids.
It's the structure of a kind and I'm not

1066
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:36,050
sure I can find all sorts of flaws in 
that,

1067
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:40,490
but enough people are doing it that it's
something that needs to be addressed.

1068
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:43,070
What I would.
It's I would say yes,

1069
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:48,110
it speaks to a real failure of 
imagination and an effort in the secular

1070
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:55,190
community to produce truly non 
embarrassing alternative.

1071
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:55,700
Exactly.

1072
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,190
And,
and this is,

1073
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:02,250
this is across the board.
This is not just school,

1074
01:00:02,251 --> 01:00:05,280
this is how do you conduct a funeral?
How do you get married,

1075
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:06,280
you know,
all of the it.

1076
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:09,330
What rites of passage can you offer a 13
year old

1077
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:13,140
doing here?
What are we doing to have,

1078
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:18,920
how to have the first people in history 
to have absolutely no explanation for 

1079
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,000
what we're doing at all.

1080
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:23,800
Yeah.
It is a big moment.

1081
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:24,780
Yeah.
Yes.

1082
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:30,130
And that's the noise that sharpens up my
concern perfectly,

1083
01:00:30,531 --> 01:00:35,531
because to to shrink back from that 
moment and resort to one of the,

1084
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:42,710
the pseudo stories of the past,
I consider it to be a failure of nerve,

1085
01:00:43,370 --> 01:00:45,200
both,
both intellectually and morally.

1086
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:49,790
Okay.
So let,

1087
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:51,380
let's go back to the,
to the

1088
01:00:51,650 --> 01:00:52,680
hero idea.
One of the,

1089
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:57,700
one of the things you might notice about
superheroes is that some of them are 

1090
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:00,581
actually Dante's right?
So in the Marvel Pantheon you have thor 

1091
01:01:00,581 --> 01:01:00,930
for example,
and so there's a,

1092
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:05,960
there's a very thin line between the 
idea of the superhero and the idea of a 

1093
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,820
god,
especially if you think about it in a 

1094
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:11,621
polytheistic manner.
So the modern superheroes and the Greek 

1095
01:01:11,621 --> 01:01:11,621
gods,
for example,

1096
01:01:11,621 --> 01:01:13,760
share a tremendous number of features in
common.

1097
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:15,600
And so here's,
here's,

1098
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:20,770
here's something to think about.
So there's a reason that people admire 

1099
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:23,120
superheroes and it's because they act 
out parts of the hero archetype.

1100
01:01:23,121 --> 01:01:28,121
That's the technical reason.
They're obviously acting something out 

1101
01:01:28,121 --> 01:01:28,730
because that's how you can tell they're 
superheroes.

1102
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:33,940
They share some set of characteristics 
across the set of superheroes that makes

1103
01:01:34,521 --> 01:01:37,400
them super heroes.
Now the question might be,

1104
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:42,790
what is the essential element of being a
superhero that makes you a superhero and

1105
01:01:42,951 --> 01:01:47,951
the answer,
the way that that was solved 

1106
01:01:47,951 --> 01:01:49,631
historically is that as a polytheistic 
society is developed and that was 

1107
01:01:49,631 --> 01:01:52,370
usually a consequence of isolated tribes
coming into contact with one another.

1108
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:57,550
They each had their separate deities and
then over the course of time those 

1109
01:01:57,550 --> 01:02:01,451
deities ward in actual wars with people,
but also conceptually and out of that 

1110
01:02:02,181 --> 01:02:07,181
polytheistic framework was extracted,
something that was vaguely monotheistic 

1111
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:11,321
as all of those cultures came together 
to try to determine what their highest 

1112
01:02:11,321 --> 01:02:13,190
ideals should be,
so that's the god of Gods.

1113
01:02:13,191 --> 01:02:15,410
That's a way of thinking about it or the
king of kings.

1114
01:02:15,411 --> 01:02:18,800
That's another way of thinking about it 
and that's an implicit ideal,

1115
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:20,210
but could make a case.

1116
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:24,560
You tell that to the Hindus.
I mean they got one point,

1117
01:02:24,561 --> 01:02:27,410
2 billion people,
or maybe it's one point four now who are

1118
01:02:27,411 --> 01:02:32,411
operating in a in a religiously 
saturated system that does not conform 

1119
01:02:32,841 --> 01:02:34,550
to that ideal.
There is no one

1120
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,340
topic.
They're still,

1121
01:02:36,341 --> 01:02:39,160
they're still associated.
Arguably there's three on top of it all,

1122
01:02:39,161 --> 01:02:40,570
but there's still,
um,

1123
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:45,600
there's still an attempt to generate 
that polytheistic and to integrate that 

1124
01:02:46,091 --> 01:02:51,091
polytheistic reality underneath a single
rubric or you have nothing but 

1125
01:02:51,091 --> 01:02:54,430
continually dissociation of the culture.
And I'm not saying this is necessarily 

1126
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:54,430
true

1127
01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:55,260
description of what's going on in India 
at the moment.

1128
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:56,130
Well,
I'm not,

1129
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,420
I'm not saying that this is inevitable 
either and there is a tension.

1130
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:00,830
The problem,
the problem Mrs.

1131
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:05,910
Niches,
observation and remember Jay Elliot as 

1132
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:08,121
well.
The problem with extracting out the 

1133
01:03:08,121 --> 01:03:10,371
highest God from the panoply of Gods is 
the ideal becomes so abstract that it 

1134
01:03:10,371 --> 01:03:11,220
disappears.
That's the death of God.

1135
01:03:11,221 --> 01:03:14,040
And let us track that phenomena over 
multiple cultures,

1136
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,410
not it's not something that's unique to 
the west.

1137
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:20,730
So the danger of that abstraction is 
that it gets too abstract and disappears

1138
01:03:20,731 --> 01:03:23,310
and leaves us in this situation that 
Douglas just pointed out.

1139
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:28,500
Can I throw this back to the key,
the key issue of Elton John's glass,

1140
01:03:29,141 --> 01:03:34,141
which you came up with the other night 
because that's something that I wanted 

1141
01:03:34,141 --> 01:03:34,141
to do.
Add to that.

1142
01:03:34,141 --> 01:03:35,830
That would explain why I said Elton 
John's class just now.

1143
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:40,950
Oh,
well we came back to this question of 

1144
01:03:40,950 --> 01:03:45,490
what makes something valuable,
and I used as an example in Vancouver.

1145
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,790
I'm one of those nights if I had a glass
here,

1146
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:53,850
which I,
which I said was actually it was the 

1147
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:54,850
glass that Elton John used the last time
he played in this theater.

1148
01:03:55,480 --> 01:04:00,480
Suddenly it seems to be a more valuable 
glass and that Jordan and I argued about

1149
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:05,980
what the status of that value was.
That I don't know where you want.

1150
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,680
Well,
it's just one thing in particular,

1151
01:04:08,681 --> 01:04:13,681
which is the whole issue of what it is 
you give value to and let's let's say 

1152
01:04:14,261 --> 01:04:19,261
that that glass was demonstrated for 
time to having been drunk from by Elton 

1153
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:23,440
John at his final concert at work,
no latest farewell tour,

1154
01:04:23,441 --> 01:04:28,441
whatever.
So that's already a glass with 

1155
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:34,100
something.
Let's say that over the years the whole 

1156
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:36,360
attribution of that glass becomes 
debatable over a long period of time.

1157
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:42,930
A lot of things are going to have 
happened around it and to stretch this 

1158
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:43,030
to breaking point,
possibly,

1159
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:48,780
let's say at some point people lose 
their lives over whether that is Elton 

1160
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:51,160
John's glass or not,
let's say the people to lose blood,

1161
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:57,110
not just say that.
Let's recognize that is the world we're 

1162
01:04:57,110 --> 01:04:57,110
living in with respect to the

1163
01:04:57,110 --> 01:04:58,690
so religions,
so the problem is that we end up,

1164
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,510
when we're talking about religion,
when we're talking to the same thing,

1165
01:05:01,511 --> 01:05:06,511
when you're talking about land,
you're not just talking about any 

1166
01:05:06,511 --> 01:05:10,291
inherent worth,
you're talking also about the worth of 

1167
01:05:10,291 --> 01:05:13,650
things people have given up for this and
so we end up giving the layers of 

1168
01:05:13,781 --> 01:05:14,380
things.
What knows?

1169
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:17,050
It's more than that.
We inherit more,

1170
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:22,140
more layers if the meaning,
because other people before us have 

1171
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:25,210
given that meaning to it so that by the 
time you have this object,

1172
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:30,570
it's an object of worth even if it's of 
no worth in itself at all because of the

1173
01:05:31,061 --> 01:05:34,090
amount of worth of people before you 
have given to it.

1174
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:38,860
And that seems to some extent what we're
doing with the religion discussion.

1175
01:05:38,861 --> 01:05:39,420
Yes,
yes.

1176
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:39,940
Well,
so,

1177
01:05:39,941 --> 01:05:40,420
so,
okay,

1178
01:05:40,421 --> 01:05:41,560
so,
so that's,

1179
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:43,270
that's extraordinarily productive.
I think.

1180
01:05:43,271 --> 01:05:44,890
So.
See

1181
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,590
when you start with the hypothesis of 
facts,

1182
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:53,620
then you kind of have to define what a 
fact is and so I think the simplest way 

1183
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:56,300
of doing that to begin with is that 
there's a set of objective facts.

1184
01:05:56,510 --> 01:05:59,000
That's the facts about objective 
reality.

1185
01:05:59,180 --> 01:06:04,180
You can think about that from a 
scientific perspective and we're going 

1186
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:04,190
to.
We're going to agree that that exists,

1187
01:06:04,191 --> 01:06:09,191
although it's very complicated and 
difficult to understand that exists has 

1188
01:06:09,191 --> 01:06:11,090
one set of constraints on what we can do
and what we can do.

1189
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:13,790
That's the objective world.
And then on top of that,

1190
01:06:13,791 --> 01:06:16,250
and this is where things get very,
very complicated.

1191
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:21,700
You have this layered system of meaning 
which is partly a manifestation of these

1192
01:06:22,131 --> 01:06:24,200
layers of the nervous system that I 
described,

1193
01:06:24,201 --> 01:06:29,201
but also partly a manifestation of those
layers of the nervous system operating 

1194
01:06:29,201 --> 01:06:31,820
in social space over vast periods of 
time.

1195
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,430
So that would be the social sociological
agreement.

1196
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:39,700
That's all layered on top of the 
objective world and it actually 

1197
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:42,431
constitutes part of the.
The Lens through which you view the 

1198
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:45,491
world to the degree where you actually 
see the layering in the thing,

1199
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:49,460
so like when you go to a museum and you 
look at Elvis Presley,

1200
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:54,080
Elvis Presley's guitar,
you don't look at the guitar and think,

1201
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:57,710
that's Elvis Presley's guitar.
That's not how your brain works.

1202
01:06:57,830 --> 01:07:02,600
You actually see Elvis Presley's guitar.
It's an active perception,

1203
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:06,050
so it becomes built right into your 
nervous system even though the fact that

1204
01:07:06,051 --> 01:07:11,051
that is Elvis Presley's guitar and the 
reason that that's valuable is because 

1205
01:07:11,051 --> 01:07:15,880
of a sociological agreement about what 
position Elvis Presley occupied in the 

1206
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,240
dominance hierarchy that we're all part 
of.

1207
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:21,740
And so what you see when you look at an 
artifact like that is you see a layer of

1208
01:07:21,741 --> 01:07:26,000
dominance hierarchy overlaid on top of 
an objective reality and that's actually

1209
01:07:26,001 --> 01:07:31,001
your phenomenal reality.
Now the thing that's so interesting is 

1210
01:07:31,001 --> 01:07:34,541
that layer of perception that's 
mediating between the facts and you has 

1211
01:07:34,541 --> 01:07:39,401
a structure and that's the structure 
that I've been insisting is a narrative 

1212
01:07:39,401 --> 01:07:40,850
and I think Sam thinks it's a narrative 
too,

1213
01:07:40,851 --> 01:07:45,851
because his fundamental ethic is that 
you should act in a way which means to 

1214
01:07:45,851 --> 01:07:50,471
embody a mode of being,
which means to be a personality that 

1215
01:07:50,471 --> 01:07:52,300
moves us from hell to something 
approximating

1216
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:57,310
you haven't what?
I'm struggling to understand what I 

1217
01:07:59,371 --> 01:08:04,371
don't understand this,
how any of that is a counterpoint to my 

1218
01:08:04,371 --> 01:08:06,320
concern about religion.
So for it,

1219
01:08:06,330 --> 01:08:07,800
because I agree with all that,
I mean there,

1220
01:08:07,810 --> 01:08:09,480
there are some caveats.
I would issue,

1221
01:08:09,481 --> 01:08:14,481
for instance,
it's quite possible to walk into a 

1222
01:08:14,481 --> 01:08:14,481
museum,
be shown a guitar,

1223
01:08:14,481 --> 01:08:14,481
not,
no,

1224
01:08:14,481 --> 01:08:16,130
it's elvis guitar and then

1225
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:20,900
be told it's to Elvis Presley's guitar 
and you can see in real time that change

1226
01:08:20,901 --> 01:08:23,810
and significant so that you can see the 
layers of the perceptual,

1227
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:27,340
the meeting a crew.
You might actually not even kidding,

1228
01:08:27,341 --> 01:08:30,410
you might know it.
Who else Elvis Presley is and not care.

1229
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:31,220
Right?
So there are many different,

1230
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:32,300
uh,
things on,

1231
01:08:32,301 --> 01:08:37,301
on,
on the menu here as opposed to just 

1232
01:08:37,301 --> 01:08:37,301
beholding Austrac,
Elvis,

1233
01:08:37,301 --> 01:08:38,520
Presley's guitar,
and the,

1234
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:41,150
and the same is true of the Jesus story 
or anything else that,

1235
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:44,570
that you can find layers of engagement 
with it,

1236
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:49,780
that they may be more and less useful.
My fundamental concern is that the way 

1237
01:08:50,361 --> 01:08:55,361
you are tending to dignify the religious
subset of stories as being fun,

1238
01:08:57,410 --> 01:08:59,960
foundational,
necessary,

1239
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:02,540
it just,
we criticized at our peril,

1240
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:08,140
is giving people license to believe 
things that they clearly shouldn't 

1241
01:09:09,441 --> 01:09:14,441
believe.
Things that are intrinsically divisive 

1242
01:09:14,441 --> 01:09:16,781
in intrinsically less than optimal as 
far as organizing and individual human 

1243
01:09:16,781 --> 01:09:21,551
life.
We can do better than Christianity on 

1244
01:09:21,551 --> 01:09:26,050
almost every question,
but with the possible exception of 

1245
01:09:26,050 --> 01:09:26,600
building churches.

1246
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:28,320
Okay,
so the first thing is,

1247
01:09:28,650 --> 01:09:33,650
the first thing is that I deeply agree 
with you that that mechanism can go 

1248
01:09:33,650 --> 01:09:33,930
wrong.
Okay,

1249
01:09:33,931 --> 01:09:37,230
so you have the objective world and it's
one set of constraints and then you have

1250
01:09:37,231 --> 01:09:42,231
this interpretive structure.
And I'm not saying that that 

1251
01:09:42,231 --> 01:09:42,450
interpretive structure is infallible.
It clearly isn't,

1252
01:09:42,451 --> 01:09:44,580
and neither is the process that gives 
rise to it.

1253
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:45,990
You see this,
for example,

1254
01:09:45,991 --> 01:09:50,991
in conditions like manic depressive 
disorder with religious delusions or 

1255
01:09:50,991 --> 01:09:54,270
schizophrenia,
you see what you see in those situations

1256
01:09:54,271 --> 01:09:57,960
is a pathologization of that overlay of 
meaning that can clearly.

1257
01:09:58,190 --> 01:10:03,190
Okay,
now the question is what do we do about 

1258
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:06,201
that?
How do we keep those perceptual 

1259
01:10:06,201 --> 01:10:06,720
structures which are somewhat arbitrary?
How do we keep them functional,

1260
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:12,080
and this is I think where your 
discussion of rationality is so 

1261
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:12,720
important,
particularly when you say rationality is

1262
01:10:12,721 --> 01:10:16,770
what enables us to establish what will 
you agree on in our shared reality.

1263
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:18,840
Okay,
so so imagine this,

1264
01:10:18,841 --> 01:10:22,080
so part of the way you orient yourself 
in the world of facts,

1265
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:27,140
objective facts is through your senses,
so you basically have five dimensions of

1266
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:29,520
triangulation,
so to speak,

1267
01:10:29,521 --> 01:10:32,100
to help you determine what's there in 
the objective world,

1268
01:10:32,430 --> 01:10:37,430
and then you have this multilayer 
structure that's partly biological and 

1269
01:10:37,430 --> 01:10:41,331
partly socio culture,
that cultural that enables you to 

1270
01:10:41,331 --> 01:10:44,630
distill that,
but it can go astray part because it 

1271
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:47,841
ages and becomes archaic,
which is an and demented for that 

1272
01:10:47,841 --> 01:10:51,891
matter,
which is partly your objection to the 

1273
01:10:51,891 --> 01:10:51,891
fundamentalist types.
This has been known for a very long time

1274
01:10:51,891 --> 01:10:53,880
that this sort of thing happens.
So what we do,

1275
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:56,880
the way we solved that,
we have a solution to that.

1276
01:10:57,030 --> 01:11:02,030
So partly the way we solve that is 
through articulated discourse,

1277
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,960
right?
Because you have a way of looking at the

1278
01:11:03,961 --> 01:11:08,961
world and I have a way of looking at the
world and we have to occupy the same 

1279
01:11:08,961 --> 01:11:12,201
space.
So you're probably wrong about some 

1280
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:14,991
things and I'm probably wrong about some
things and hopefully if we we can sort 

1281
01:11:14,991 --> 01:11:16,740
out the differences and make things more
stable

1282
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,670
and I would put rationality right in 
that place.

1283
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:22,790
That's by rationality is prime.
Right?

1284
01:11:22,870 --> 01:11:24,670
The problem.
Fair enough.

1285
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:26,620
But,
but there's a problem with that too.

1286
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:31,180
And I see all the times we've talked so 
far,

1287
01:11:31,630 --> 01:11:36,630
you've been,
I would say the Avatar of a scientific 

1288
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:37,150
viewpoint.
And I'd been cast,

1289
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:39,160
let's say as the Avatar of a religious 
viewpoint,

1290
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:44,430
but I've actually thought this through 
scientifically a lot and I can make a 

1291
01:11:44,430 --> 01:11:46,840
biological argument for all of this and 
a developmental argument.

1292
01:11:46,841 --> 01:11:49,300
So it isn't only rationality that does 
this.

1293
01:11:49,301 --> 01:11:52,120
So this is what the thing that was so 
cool about studying,

1294
01:11:52,121 --> 01:11:53,860
for example,
John Piaget,

1295
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:59,040
because one of the things piaget pointed
out is that children engage in 

1296
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:01,020
negotiation it,
they negotiate the rep,

1297
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:06,060
they reality just like adults do,
but they don't do it only through 

1298
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:09,841
articulated speech and neither do adults
with children do is they get together 

1299
01:12:09,841 --> 01:12:14,011
and play and this is why play is so 
important for children that starts to 

1300
01:12:14,011 --> 01:12:18,541
happen when there were about three years
of all because they can look outside 

1301
01:12:18,541 --> 01:12:21,400
their own idiosyncratic perspective at 
three and they can start to take someone

1302
01:12:21,401 --> 01:12:26,401
else's view point into consideration,
which is what you have to do if you're 

1303
01:12:26,401 --> 01:12:26,401
going to play.

1304
01:12:26,401 --> 01:12:28,840
And then what children do is they invent
little fictional realities.

1305
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:30,790
That's what they do when they're 
pretending.

1306
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:36,270
And so they assigned each other roles 
and they assigned a plot and a drama to 

1307
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:37,840
the,
to the pretend play and then they act it

1308
01:12:37,841 --> 01:12:41,020
out.
And in that action they bring themselves

1309
01:12:41,021 --> 01:12:42,970
into harmonious union.
Right?

1310
01:12:42,971 --> 01:12:46,540
Which is the act of generating a game 
that everyone wants to play.

1311
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:51,960
And Piaget's observation was,
and this is Nietzschean observation as 

1312
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:55,231
well,
but the morality that characterizes 

1313
01:12:55,231 --> 01:12:57,480
society isn't rationality top down,
although it's partly that it's also 

1314
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,270
interactions that are,
say,

1315
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:04,300
play based and bought them up,
and that's actually how it evolved to 

1316
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:07,390
begin with because animals generate 
societies that are functional,

1317
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:09,340
but they don't do it through 
rationality.

1318
01:13:09,670 --> 01:13:11,530
They can't because they don't have 
rationality,

1319
01:13:11,710 --> 01:13:16,710
they don't have articulated speech.
They have something like an embodied 

1320
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:17,740
game.
Now what happens,

1321
01:13:17,950 --> 01:13:22,950
and this is a Nietzschean observation,
he's the first person I learned this 

1322
01:13:22,950 --> 01:13:25,771
from,
is our morality emerged from the bottom 

1323
01:13:25,771 --> 01:13:28,501
up through through thousands,
hundreds of thousands of years have 

1324
01:13:28,501 --> 01:13:29,570
shared games,
let's say at the end,

1325
01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:34,590
the interweaving of those shared games 
into something approximating a morality 

1326
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:36,190
that we could all live within 
peacefully.

1327
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:41,490
That happened bottom up and then what 
happened was because we didn't know the 

1328
01:13:41,490 --> 01:13:45,751
mechanism behind that because it's 
instantiated in our nervous system 

1329
01:13:45,751 --> 01:13:47,580
invisibly.
We watched ourselves act,

1330
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:53,250
which is what we do,
and then we told stories about that 

1331
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:53,350
because that's what we do when we watch 
yourself act,

1332
01:13:53,530 --> 01:13:58,530
and then we encapsulated the morality 
that evolved in the stories and that's 

1333
01:13:59,051 --> 01:14:00,880
the religious essence of the story.

1334
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:02,640
Ten seconds

1335
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:08,740
we have to pivot to Douglas for a a,
an important question,

1336
01:14:08,741 --> 01:14:10,600
but I would just say in response to 
that,

1337
01:14:10,630 --> 01:14:11,920
Jordan,
I don't

1338
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:16,030
disagree with much of consequence in 
that.

1339
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:18,760
My concern however,
is that there is.

1340
01:14:18,930 --> 01:14:23,930
There's a,
there's a reason why we differentiate 

1341
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:26,041
childhood from adulthood and all of us 
are stunted to some degree or another in

1342
01:14:27,611 --> 01:14:31,270
a fairly perverse childhood.
And the reason,

1343
01:14:31,670 --> 01:14:32,380
I mean what,
what we,

1344
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:37,410
what we confront now is a world largely 
populated by dangerous children,

1345
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:42,820
right?
Who are in their fifth and sixth decade 

1346
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:43,660
of life.
I mean running by populated and run by.

1347
01:14:43,661 --> 01:14:44,310
Yes,
and,

1348
01:14:44,370 --> 01:14:49,370
and it's so real and if anything 
typifies the childhood of our species,

1349
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:55,590
in my view,
it is his religious orthodoxy and in so 

1350
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:59,190
far as we're breaking free of the 
orthodoxy part and getting something 

1351
01:14:59,190 --> 01:14:59,390
that's more scalable and,
and,

1352
01:14:59,391 --> 01:14:59,980
and,
and,

1353
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,610
and can survive a more pluralistic and 
cosmopolitan world.

1354
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:08,140
It is because it is being winnowed at 
every point by rationality.

1355
01:15:08,141 --> 01:15:12,310
And I think that that at some point we 
could have a fully defensible,

1356
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:16,190
rational honoring of,
of many of the things you think are,

1357
01:15:16,191 --> 01:15:19,900
are essential like the power of story,
the power of ritual or the power of,

1358
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:25,100
of,
of art that is focused on some sacred 

1359
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:25,100
purpose.
Uh,

1360
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:26,920
and the question is how to get there,
right?

1361
01:15:28,050 --> 01:15:30,430
We have a point of order.
That's one question,

1362
01:15:31,050 --> 01:15:31,540
but,
uh,

1363
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:36,780
I want to hand over to the audience for 
q and a and a for a couple of minutes.

1364
01:15:36,941 --> 01:15:41,941
I've had a sign being waved at me saying
q and a and really should have been 

1365
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:47,270
signed.
So I think what's gonna happen is we're 

1366
01:15:47,270 --> 01:15:48,510
going to use your computer.

1367
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:51,040
We're going to,
we're going to ask the audience first.

1368
01:15:51,041 --> 01:15:55,990
I think that was what we decided and I 
guess you guys get to vote by noise.

1369
01:15:56,170 --> 01:16:01,170
There's an inflection point here.
We can do one of two things and I'll 

1370
01:16:01,170 --> 01:16:04,561
let.
I'll let the first people yell and then 

1371
01:16:04,561 --> 01:16:07,321
the second people yell,
but the question is we can either 

1372
01:16:07,321 --> 01:16:09,400
continue the discussion or we can stop 
and go to q and a.

1373
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:11,230
So the first thing we'll do is say,
okay,

1374
01:16:11,231 --> 01:16:14,620
how many of you would like us to stop 
and go to q and a?

1375
01:16:18,790 --> 01:16:20,080
Okay.
Second,

1376
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:25,140
second question.
How many of you would like us to 

1377
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:25,140
continue with the discussion?

1378
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:31,100
That's,

1379
01:16:32,210 --> 01:16:36,060
that's a successful vote.
Do I want to go?

1380
01:16:36,450 --> 01:16:39,180
I'm going to see is the floor.
I want to ask a question to both of you.

1381
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:44,800
It's about the three of us,
but I think it's more about the two of 

1382
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,601
you.
Each of us to one or another degree has 

1383
01:16:49,381 --> 01:16:53,700
been described as a gateway drug to the 
alt right.

1384
01:16:55,500 --> 01:17:00,500
We've been attacked by,
by people left of center as somehow 

1385
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:05,010
inspiring or pandering to right of 
center and in many cases,

1386
01:17:05,011 --> 01:17:08,100
far right of center ideas and,
and,

1387
01:17:08,660 --> 01:17:10,190
and ethical

1388
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:11,570
and pseudo ethical commitments.

1389
01:17:12,450 --> 01:17:12,950
Uh,

1390
01:17:14,550 --> 01:17:15,290
I'm wondering.
Yeah,

1391
01:17:15,390 --> 01:17:18,060
I'm wondering,
I'm wondering if we can steal man,

1392
01:17:18,061 --> 01:17:23,061
the concerns that people have with us 
for a few minutes before addressing the 

1393
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:24,200
boy.
How do you,

1394
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:29,790
how do you view this,
this reaction to your work and.

1395
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:32,640
Well,
I'm happy to do that first.

1396
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:38,240
Can I just say before I do that was 
going to say if we were going to go to 

1397
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:41,811
audience Qa,
I understand it was reminded today that 

1398
01:17:41,811 --> 01:17:41,811
there's still a blasphemy law and 
Ireland.

1399
01:17:41,811 --> 01:17:43,910
Ah.
Well am I right on that?

1400
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:46,160
I,
I wait the police.

1401
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:47,970
I'm right on time.
Yeah.

1402
01:17:48,770 --> 01:17:53,770
In which case can I just say that I'm 
not going to be happy if we leave the 

1403
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:55,640
stage tonight in handcuffs.
I have not both committed last,

1404
01:17:55,660 --> 01:17:56,000
right?
Yeah.

1405
01:17:56,180 --> 01:18:01,180
Yeah.
And if Jordan would make hypergrid that 

1406
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:08,280
to do that in private,
we could make it a full house.

1407
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:12,450
I really do think we should be last 
semester.

1408
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:16,320
I think I must have done that already,
but I'll have to go to the tape on that.

1409
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:18,410
Um,
so.

1410
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:19,670
Well,
here's the thing,

1411
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:24,340
we've all had similar experiences on 
that and there are a number of people in

1412
01:18:24,341 --> 01:18:29,341
our friends and colleagues.
Perhaps you might say you've had it as 

1413
01:18:29,341 --> 01:18:29,590
well.
Um,

1414
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:34,840
and I think what's happening at the 
moment is that there's a set of trip 

1415
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:39,101
wires that have been put across the 
culture and for a long time,

1416
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:46,000
if you went across these trip wires,
you died reputationally speaking because

1417
01:18:48,501 --> 01:18:50,960
of the nature of the media,
new media,

1418
01:18:50,961 --> 01:18:54,860
among other things that sudden death 
isn't possible anymore.

1419
01:18:55,290 --> 01:18:57,170
Or this is not always possible.
Right?

1420
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:02,500
So for instance,
if the New York Times says that Jordan 

1421
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:02,500
is a,
you know,

1422
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:03,470
sort of leading member of the Ku Klux 
Klan,

1423
01:19:05,060 --> 01:19:08,960
it's not just that people don't believe 
the New York Times anymore,

1424
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:14,450
it's that they can go and find out for 
themselves that this is a lie.

1425
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:20,440
And that's the fundamental difference.
And it means that people are surviving 

1426
01:19:20,440 --> 01:19:24,910
the trip wire experience.
But there's a whole set of these trip 

1427
01:19:24,910 --> 01:19:24,910
wires.
And I think they've been,

1428
01:19:24,910 --> 01:19:28,490
they've been planted very strangely 
among other things.

1429
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:31,130
I mean,
the one I tripped on was Islam one think

1430
01:19:31,131 --> 01:19:33,650
to an extent.
It was the one you tripped on Jordan.

1431
01:19:33,710 --> 01:19:37,550
It was more to do with farms and 
pronouns was the first one.

1432
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,490
The Great.
The great thing about this,

1433
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:39,960
by the way,
is there,

1434
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:42,200
once you survived the first trip wire,
you know,

1435
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:47,210
my kids,
they sort of merrily jump along in no 

1436
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:47,210
man's land,
land

1437
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:51,600
live on ied after ied.
And strangely I'm still here.

1438
01:19:57,580 --> 01:19:59,250
You said steal.
Amanda.

1439
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:02,230
Here's what I think is probably 
happening.

1440
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:08,010
There was a fear that in this realm of 
uncertain values,

1441
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:12,630
which we might concede at any rate that 
we're in a,

1442
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:17,660
there is only one thing we all agree on,
but one thing we all agree on is we 

1443
01:20:18,190 --> 01:20:20,640
mustn't become Nazis.
Okay?

1444
01:20:21,810 --> 01:20:23,700
Broadly speaking,
that's the basis of our face.

1445
01:20:24,330 --> 01:20:29,330
It's the only bit of history anyone 
knows and they don't even know it.

1446
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:33,660
So they think they're all over the 
Hitler thing.

1447
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:35,850
Alright?
Haven't got a clue.

1448
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:38,700
Most of them all they know is Hitler was
a bad person.

1449
01:20:38,970 --> 01:20:39,960
This is why,
by the way,

1450
01:20:39,990 --> 01:20:43,830
anyone anyone doesn't like in politics 
is Hitler like George w Dot Bush,

1451
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:48,920
Hitler.
If you had any sense of historical 

1452
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:49,050
reference,
you might say Henry,

1453
01:20:49,051 --> 01:20:53,790
the fifth domineering father who 
shadowed you had to step out of,

1454
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:55,800
for instance,
but there Henry,

1455
01:20:55,801 --> 01:20:58,980
the fifth myth knows about that.

1456
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:04,070
So it's everything's Hitler.
So if we agree that the one thing we're 

1457
01:21:04,070 --> 01:21:06,531
all meant to do is not become Nazis.
You build these incredibly deep trenches

1458
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:13,580
around anything you think could be 
something that would lead us back to 

1459
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:17,841
that.
The problem is is that people who have 

1460
01:21:17,841 --> 01:21:20,571
done that trench building include people
who are doing it for their own personal 

1461
01:21:21,391 --> 01:21:26,391
political game,
so they build a set of trenches around 

1462
01:21:26,391 --> 01:21:30,080
their political views and they say,
if you come near this and you've gotten 

1463
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:34,020
into that trench and there were Nazi.
Some of it is for short term convenience

1464
01:21:34,021 --> 01:21:36,270
and I've no doubt that some of it is 
sincere,

1465
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:42,940
but the amount of the amount of lying 
about it makes me doubt that last bit,

1466
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:46,010
and let me add one other thing to that.

1467
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:50,800
One of the books I recommend people read
most to do with politics.

1468
01:21:50,801 --> 01:21:55,801
There's a brilliant book by Paul Berman 
who I think you know as well go power 

1469
01:21:55,841 --> 01:21:57,220
and the idealists.
It has,

1470
01:21:57,221 --> 01:21:59,950
by the way,
the worst subtitle of any book.

1471
01:22:00,700 --> 01:22:05,700
It's called power and the idealist.
The strange passion of Jasko Fisher.

1472
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:12,370
Now distinguished left wing German 
politician,

1473
01:22:12,371 --> 01:22:15,280
though he is a.
it's not,

1474
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:16,750
it doesn't,
it doesn't leap off the shelf.

1475
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:22,140
Anyhow,
the strange passion of Jasko Fisher is 

1476
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:25,020
an amazing book which I wish was taught 
in schools because he describes in this 

1477
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:29,821
book how this group of Germans who grew 
up in the 19 fifties had one but one 

1478
01:22:31,631 --> 01:22:36,631
name was.
We're not going to become like our 

1479
01:22:36,631 --> 01:22:36,631
parents.
Okay.

1480
01:22:36,631 --> 01:22:40,180
If they think it's enough to orient 
their politics around what happened,

1481
01:22:41,020 --> 01:22:46,020
uh,
the green movement melds with the part 

1482
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:47,170
of the German left,
a whole set of things happen.

1483
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:52,380
They ended up agreeing with the PLO and 
the hijackings in the late sixties and 

1484
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:53,860
early seventies.
And before you know it,

1485
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:59,160
one of your fishes housemates is on the 
plane as it's on the tarmac and he's 

1486
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:02,590
separating out the Jews.
And the Non Jews,

1487
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:09,840
we've it again,
the one thing we are meant not to become

1488
01:23:10,150 --> 01:23:13,870
was the people standing on the ramp 
seeing that way that way.

1489
01:23:13,930 --> 01:23:16,810
And we did it.
We went all the way around.

1490
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:20,050
So there's something about this that I 
just wish was better known,

1491
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:23,170
but he's not as damn easiest.
All that.

1492
01:23:23,350 --> 01:23:27,120
Like your enemies don't come with Jack 
boots and swastikas like this.

1493
01:23:27,130 --> 01:23:28,820
It's just not that easy.
No,

1494
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:30,440
they live inside you.
Right?

1495
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:31,810
That's really the case.

1496
01:23:32,870 --> 01:23:36,120
So let me try this steel manifold.
Okay.

1497
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:36,590
So.

1498
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:43,650
So the first thing that people assume 
about me is that I'm no fan of the 

1499
01:23:44,411 --> 01:23:47,470
radical left.
And that's absolutely.

1500
01:23:47,710 --> 01:23:51,940
And that's absolutely true.
I am no fan of

1501
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:52,870
the radical left.

1502
01:23:57,740 --> 01:24:00,110
How narrowly,
because there's a variety of reasons,

1503
01:24:00,111 --> 01:24:05,111
but it's primarily because I believe 
that the radical left airs in insisting 

1504
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:11,480
had every possible opportunity that the 
proper defining characteristic of each 

1505
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:16,331
individual is their group membership.
I think that that's you and you do have 

1506
01:24:17,391 --> 01:24:18,530
a group membership.
In fact,

1507
01:24:18,531 --> 01:24:23,531
you have a whole plethora of them which 
makes things quite complicated as the 

1508
01:24:23,531 --> 01:24:24,230
intersection list have already figured 
out.

1509
01:24:25,490 --> 01:24:30,490
But whenever someone brings a primary 
orientation to the world that is group 

1510
01:24:30,501 --> 01:24:32,450
centered rather than individual 
centered,

1511
01:24:32,451 --> 01:24:35,120
I think they've already made a 
catastrophic mistake.

1512
01:24:35,330 --> 01:24:40,330
And so I don't approve of the.
It's now I don't approve of left wing 

1513
01:24:40,330 --> 01:24:43,430
collectivist and I don't approve of 
right wing collectivist,

1514
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:47,470
but the right wing collectivist haven't 
overrun the universities and the lifting

1515
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:51,290
collected as so.
So that's a distinct difference.

1516
01:24:51,291 --> 01:24:51,550
Now

1517
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:59,220
leftwing collectivists enjoy acquiring a
certain linguistic hegemony because they

1518
01:25:00,521 --> 01:25:05,521
know that that's part of the way they 
can win the battle and that's what they 

1519
01:25:05,521 --> 01:25:08,191
were trying to do when they pass 
compelled speech legislation in Canada 

1520
01:25:08,191 --> 01:25:12,060
as far as I was concerned.
So I made a video saying I'm not going 

1521
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:15,841
to abide by that because I'm not using 
the reprehensible linguistic maneuvers 

1522
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:20,880
of collectivists who I detest.
So now when I did that,

1523
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:24,580
you see it was a very strange thing for 
a Canadian to do because Canadians don't

1524
01:25:24,581 --> 01:25:28,510
do that partly because Canada works just
fine.

1525
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:31,750
And so nobody comes up and says waves 
the flag saying,

1526
01:25:31,751 --> 01:25:32,310
look,
we're,

1527
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:34,570
we're wandering off a dangerous cliff 
here.

1528
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:37,420
And so then if someone does stand up and
say that,

1529
01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:42,010
then the first thing that all the other 
Canadians think and should think is that

1530
01:25:42,011 --> 01:25:46,660
there's something wrong with that person
and that would be me.

1531
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:48,460
So then the question would be,
well,

1532
01:25:48,461 --> 01:25:52,390
what variety of things could be wrong 
with Dr Peterson?

1533
01:25:52,391 --> 01:25:57,391
That's a very long list,
but the ones that might actually at 

1534
01:25:57,391 --> 01:26:01,090
better subtitled the title.
So.

1535
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:04,160
So what happened was I objected

1536
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,710
to the radical left.
That was my perspective,

1537
01:26:06,711 --> 01:26:11,210
but the people who objected to me or who
were even critical of mere curious about

1538
01:26:11,211 --> 01:26:12,200
me thought,
okay,

1539
01:26:12,201 --> 01:26:17,201
well if Peterson isn't part of the left,
then where the hell is he announcer 

1540
01:26:17,201 --> 01:26:20,480
could be anywhere on the political 
spectrum including Nazi.

1541
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:23,750
And of course that's hypothetically 
true.

1542
01:26:24,020 --> 01:26:29,020
And if I was a Nazi then that would be 
really useful for all the radical 

1543
01:26:29,241 --> 01:26:31,580
leftists.
Because if you're a Nazi,

1544
01:26:31,581 --> 01:26:36,581
as Douglas has already pointed out,
we've already decided that you're a bad 

1545
01:26:36,581 --> 01:26:39,941
person.
And if I was a bad person then no one 

1546
01:26:39,941 --> 01:26:42,641
would have to listen to me.
And so it was in the interests of the 

1547
01:26:42,641 --> 01:26:46,661
radicals who I was just whose positions 
I was disputing to cast me as a Nazi,

1548
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:52,120
but it was also a reasonable cognitive 
maneuver because there was some 

1549
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:53,180
possibility,
although it's infinitesimal,

1550
01:26:53,181 --> 01:26:58,181
given the tiny proportion of actual 
Nazis in our society that I would in 

1551
01:26:58,181 --> 01:27:02,351
fact be one and have gotten away with 
hiding that at two major universities 

1552
01:27:02,351 --> 01:27:05,660
for 25 years.
And also

1553
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:09,550
awesome

1554
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:16,130
at that point I had 250 hours of my 
lectures on youtube,

1555
01:27:16,201 --> 01:27:19,920
which was basically every word in 
essence that I ever uttered to a student

1556
01:27:19,921 --> 01:27:24,921
since 1993.
And a huge part of that actually 

1557
01:27:24,921 --> 01:27:28,131
consisted of very trenchant criticisms 
of Nazis.

1558
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:30,780
So it was difficult to pin that on me.
So,

1559
01:27:30,810 --> 01:27:31,350
so,
so,

1560
01:27:31,351 --> 01:27:36,351
but to give my critics credit,
they had their reason for vilifying me.

1561
01:27:36,690 --> 01:27:40,880
And the reason was if you object,
you might be a villain.

1562
01:27:41,550 --> 01:27:42,100
Okay.
So,

1563
01:27:42,130 --> 01:27:44,160
so that's,
that's steel man.

1564
01:27:44,161 --> 01:27:49,161
Number one.
I'm not at least the kind of villain 

1565
01:27:49,161 --> 01:27:52,580
they think I am,
although I might be some other kind of 

1566
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:55,461
villain altogether.
So then the next steel man issue is the 

1567
01:27:55,621 --> 01:27:57,990
left has a place.
Okay,

1568
01:27:57,991 --> 01:27:59,520
so why?
Well,

1569
01:27:59,521 --> 01:28:04,080
here's why.
In order to act properly in the world,

1570
01:28:04,081 --> 01:28:07,890
you have to do things.
Everyone agrees on that and to do things

1571
01:28:07,891 --> 01:28:08,640
you have to do them.

1572
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:13,640
In the social world,
you have to cooperate and compete with 

1573
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:16,041
other people.
And when you cooperate and compete with 

1574
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:16,080
other people in the service of valid 
goals,

1575
01:28:16,110 --> 01:28:18,030
valuable goals,
productive goals,

1576
01:28:18,180 --> 01:28:23,180
you produce hierarchies,
you produce hierarchies of competence 

1577
01:28:23,180 --> 01:28:24,450
and hierarchies of power.
Those aren't exactly the same thing,

1578
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:27,620
but either way you produce hierarchies,
hierarchies,

1579
01:28:27,630 --> 01:28:32,630
dispossessed people.
They dispossessed people because the 

1580
01:28:32,630 --> 01:28:36,381
spoils go to a few.
That's the problem of the unequal 

1581
01:28:36,381 --> 01:28:39,951
distribution of wealth.
And because in any hierarchy of 

1582
01:28:39,951 --> 01:28:42,801
competence,
a disproportionate number of a small 

1583
01:28:42,801 --> 01:28:43,230
number of people do most of the creative
work.

1584
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:46,050
And these are iron clad laws.
Okay?

1585
01:28:46,051 --> 01:28:48,840
So the problem with higher hierarchies 
are necessary,

1586
01:28:49,650 --> 01:28:54,650
but the problem with hierarchies as they
produce disposition and the left in 

1587
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:59,250
principal speaks for the dispossessed 
and someone has to speak for the 

1588
01:28:59,551 --> 01:29:02,140
dispossessed.
And so when the left,

1589
01:29:02,141 --> 01:29:03,630
he's looking at me and they say,
well,

1590
01:29:03,631 --> 01:29:08,631
Dr Peterson is always speaking about the
necessity of hierarchies and how can we 

1591
01:29:08,631 --> 01:29:12,951
be sure that he's not trying to justify 
them in their current position and 

1592
01:29:12,951 --> 01:29:15,540
obscure the fact that they tend towards 
tyranny and deception,

1593
01:29:15,541 --> 01:29:20,541
which they clearly do.
How do we know that he's just not 

1594
01:29:20,541 --> 01:29:23,900
reifying the present power structure for
his own aims and why should we trust 

1595
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:25,830
them?
And that's a perfectly valid objection.

1596
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:31,220
Now I believe it happens to be wrong 
because I understand the downside of 

1597
01:29:31,220 --> 01:29:35,481
hierarchies in and I also think I 
understand how to go about rectifying 

1598
01:29:35,481 --> 01:29:39,261
that,
but that's why they're objecting in so 

1599
01:29:39,261 --> 01:29:42,051
far as they don't as the.
Insofar as they're playing a straight 

1600
01:29:42,051 --> 01:29:42,840
political game and not ideological form 
of grandiosity.

1601
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:43,460
Grandiosity.

1602
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:46,390
So there's one of the thing in this 
which is worth mentioning,

1603
01:29:46,391 --> 01:29:49,010
which is the perception is that the,
the,

1604
01:29:49,011 --> 01:29:50,010
the,
as it were,

1605
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:55,140
aside from,
let's say this is the center of the 

1606
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:55,140
political access and going to have to do
this for you.

1607
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:57,310
But okay,
that's the right.

1608
01:29:57,580 --> 01:30:00,550
The presumption is that the,
it's just a cliff,

1609
01:30:01,210 --> 01:30:03,580
like if you start by saying,
I don't know,

1610
01:30:03,581 --> 01:30:06,430
I think people should pay some taxes or 
whatever,

1611
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:11,880
right?
You have that and you just go like that 

1612
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:11,880
and then it's not Susan.

1613
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:14,430
Right.
And

1614
01:30:17,450 --> 01:30:22,450
it's a really weird thing that is 
discussed because all of this look at 

1615
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:27,600
all of this is just the footnote still 
the 20th century and we're still trying 

1616
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,110
to work out what happened and why and we
don't know.

1617
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:32,260
And in the history books,
the period we're living,

1618
01:30:32,261 --> 01:30:36,380
it will be the post Holocaust,
post World War Two posts,

1619
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:41,400
ghoulag world when they were still 
trying to sort out what happened behind 

1620
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:42,820
the crime scene tape.
Okay.

1621
01:30:43,540 --> 01:30:48,540
So on the left there's a very 
interesting thing which is that you can 

1622
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:52,441
go pretty much all the way like this and
first of all there's not a very wide 

1623
01:30:53,291 --> 01:30:57,340
recognition that you had the gulag not.
There's not very much known about that.

1624
01:30:57,341 --> 01:30:59,240
People don't read,
they don't read it.

1625
01:30:59,310 --> 01:31:01,540
So.
So you can go pretty far left.

1626
01:31:01,541 --> 01:31:02,680
You just hit the vegans.

1627
01:31:05,650 --> 01:31:09,120
But there's actually,
you might be like radical

1628
01:31:09,310 --> 01:31:11,330
your fan this.
Okay.

1629
01:31:11,770 --> 01:31:16,770
So the problem is not just,
they don't know what happened on that 

1630
01:31:16,770 --> 01:31:16,770
side,
but it's worse than that.

1631
01:31:16,810 --> 01:31:18,820
There was a,
there was a young girl,

1632
01:31:18,821 --> 01:31:23,821
a commentator on the TV and the London a
couple of mornings ago arguing about 

1633
01:31:23,821 --> 01:31:26,590
trump and so on is a usual,
not very enlightening discussion.

1634
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:29,020
He's arguing with Piers Morgan and she 
says,

1635
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:30,010
you,
you keep on saying,

1636
01:31:30,011 --> 01:31:32,920
I'm a supporter of Barack Obama.
I mean,

1637
01:31:32,921 --> 01:31:34,810
I'm a communist.
She said,

1638
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:39,840
I'm literally a communist thought if 
this girl had said you knew you should 

1639
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:44,410
be more careful.
I'm literally a fascist,

1640
01:31:44,440 --> 01:31:44,640
you know?

1641
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:46,160
Yeah.
By the way,

1642
01:31:46,230 --> 01:31:47,820
I did that one carefully on that.

1643
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:49,780
No,
I'm,

1644
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:57,700
I'm alive to Youtube New York Times

1645
01:31:58,060 --> 01:31:58,840
headline.
Yeah,

1646
01:31:59,300 --> 01:31:59,830
exactly.

1647
01:32:00,110 --> 01:32:04,320
Little Fascist.
But if he's got,

1648
01:32:04,350 --> 01:32:08,020
not everyone is busy searching around,
like in Canada,

1649
01:32:08,030 --> 01:32:10,780
the one of the big discussion forums,
uh,

1650
01:32:10,781 --> 01:32:15,781
the human rights commissions found that 
there were like 11 people on this Neo 

1651
01:32:15,781 --> 01:32:19,890
Nazi forum and it turned out half of 
them were working for the Canadian 

1652
01:32:19,890 --> 01:32:22,531
government trying to find me or not.
Canadian government constituted 50 

1653
01:32:22,871 --> 01:32:27,790
percent of the Neo Nazis in Canada.
They're scurrying around looking for the

1654
01:32:27,791 --> 01:32:32,791
Nazis like this,
and on the other side it's like 

1655
01:32:32,791 --> 01:32:32,791
mainstream or the television.
Yeah,

1656
01:32:32,791 --> 01:32:33,430
I'm a communist.
I'd love to go through that again.

1657
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:36,370
So here,
here's another problem.

1658
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:38,320
This is a really interesting problem.
Okay,

1659
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:43,400
so you brought up two things and one is 
no one knows about what happened in 

1660
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:45,160
Mao's China or what happened in the 
Soviet Union,

1661
01:32:45,190 --> 01:32:47,740
which is absolutely appalling because we
should all know that.

1662
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:52,180
And so there's obviously a cliff on the 
left side.

1663
01:32:52,420 --> 01:32:57,420
Now I would say actually there is the 
possibility that as you move farther out

1664
01:32:57,490 --> 01:32:59,200
on each end of the political spectrum,

1665
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:01,710
the rate at which you deteriorate 
accelerate.

1666
01:33:01,711 --> 01:33:03,560
So it's not linear.
I think that's possible.

1667
01:33:03,590 --> 01:33:07,400
But having said that,
that's also the case on the left.

1668
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:09,590
Now,
one of the things we could say is,

1669
01:33:10,040 --> 01:33:15,040
well those idiot leftists should get 
their house in order because they won't 

1670
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:17,090
differentiate themselves from their 
radical brethren.

1671
01:33:17,810 --> 01:33:19,280
Okay,
so now we might ask,

1672
01:33:19,281 --> 01:33:22,070
well why?
We might ask two things.

1673
01:33:22,071 --> 01:33:25,100
Why and whose problem is that exactly.
Okay.

1674
01:33:25,101 --> 01:33:27,890
So the first issue of why is,
well,

1675
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:31,190
people who are left leaning have a hard 
time drawing boundaries.

1676
01:33:31,670 --> 01:33:36,670
That's what makes them left leaning and 
I mean this technically because left 

1677
01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:41,561
leaning,
people are high in openness to 

1678
01:33:41,561 --> 01:33:43,181
experience which is a creativity trait.
So they like information flow and they 

1679
01:33:43,181 --> 01:33:45,980
don't like borders between things and 
they tend to be low in orderliness.

1680
01:33:46,070 --> 01:33:49,220
So disorder doesn't discuss an upset.
Okay.

1681
01:33:49,221 --> 01:33:51,980
So they can't draw boundaries and that's
why they're on the left.

1682
01:33:52,010 --> 01:33:57,010
But boundaries have their problems.
So there's some utility in people who 

1683
01:33:57,010 --> 01:33:57,010
don't like them.
Okay.

1684
01:33:57,010 --> 01:34:01,330
But the second problem is,
and this isn't a problem that's only 

1685
01:34:01,550 --> 01:34:06,550
Germane to the left,
it's the problem of the dam 20th 

1686
01:34:06,550 --> 01:34:07,040
century.
It's like okay,

1687
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:12,700
when does the left go too far?
And the answer is nobody knows.

1688
01:34:13,430 --> 01:34:16,400
Like with the right wingers,
you can tell man,

1689
01:34:16,401 --> 01:34:20,090
it's like they make a claim of ethnic or
racial superiority.

1690
01:34:20,330 --> 01:34:23,890
It's like box Nazi,
right?

1691
01:34:23,990 --> 01:34:28,990
And then you can see that this happens 
because even back in the seventies when 

1692
01:34:28,990 --> 01:34:29,690
William f Buckley was sort of a leading 
conservative,

1693
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:34,310
he put a box around the Ku Klux Klan.
And the John Birch types and he said,

1694
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:39,400
I'm not you,
but none of that's happening on the 

1695
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:39,400
left.
Okay,

1696
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:40,850
why?
Well,

1697
01:34:41,810 --> 01:34:42,560
they say,
well,

1698
01:34:42,561 --> 01:34:44,360
we stand for diversity.
It's like,

1699
01:34:44,361 --> 01:34:47,060
well,
everyone likes diversity and well,

1700
01:34:47,061 --> 01:34:49,130
what about inclusivity?
Damn right,

1701
01:34:49,131 --> 01:34:50,510
man.
Let's include some people.

1702
01:34:50,720 --> 01:34:51,530
Well,
what about,

1703
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,660
what about equality?
That'd be good.

1704
01:34:53,661 --> 01:34:55,310
That'd be good.
Let's have so many quality.

1705
01:34:55,610 --> 01:34:56,750
It's like,
okay,

1706
01:34:56,751 --> 01:34:58,610
well how he quality.
Exactly.

1707
01:34:59,030 --> 01:35:00,590
Well then it's gradations,
right?

1708
01:35:00,591 --> 01:35:02,420
Well,
equality of opportunity.

1709
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:05,240
Damn straight.
Equality of outcome.

1710
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:11,380
Sounds good.
How about no under no circumstances 

1711
01:35:12,111 --> 01:35:14,020
whatsoever,
but you know I can

1712
01:35:20,160 --> 01:35:21,170
man.
You get somebody,

1713
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:24,620
you get somebody saying race or 
ethnicity.

1714
01:35:24,770 --> 01:35:29,770
Group member x is detestable because of 
their group identity and you think evil 

1715
01:35:29,770 --> 01:35:31,400
Nazi,
but then you see someone saying,

1716
01:35:31,550 --> 01:35:34,370
well I just wish that everybody could 
have an equal outcome.

1717
01:35:34,550 --> 01:35:36,500
What are you going to do?
You're going to are going to punch them.

1718
01:35:36,590 --> 01:35:38,240
It's what you're supposed to do with 
Nazis.

1719
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:39,220
No,
you're not.

1720
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:41,150
You're going to take hold.
That's a pretty nice person.

1721
01:35:41,151 --> 01:35:46,151
And it's like,
just because you're nice doesn't mean 

1722
01:35:46,151 --> 01:35:48,971
you're good.
And just because you stand for equality 

1723
01:35:48,971 --> 01:35:48,971
of outcome doesn't mean

1724
01:35:50,110 --> 01:35:52,220
right,
but the thing is

1725
01:35:53,450 --> 01:35:56,030
complex technical problem,
right?

1726
01:35:56,031 --> 01:36:01,031
Because it looks like you need a 
multivariate equation to define 

1727
01:36:01,031 --> 01:36:02,030
pathology on the left,
it's like,

1728
01:36:02,031 --> 01:36:05,030
well,
if you believe this and this and this in

1729
01:36:05,070 --> 01:36:08,870
and to disproportionately,
then we have to put a box around you.

1730
01:36:09,350 --> 01:36:14,350
But it's not like someone wears a symbol
on their damn shirt or tattooed onto 

1731
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:15,950
their face that enables you to identify 
them.

1732
01:36:16,550 --> 01:36:18,860
So we have a real structural problem 
here.

1733
01:36:18,861 --> 01:36:22,430
We don't know how to box in pathology on
the left.

1734
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:25,120
No one knows,
including the moderate leftist,

1735
01:36:25,121 --> 01:36:26,120
but none of us know.

1736
01:36:26,450 --> 01:36:31,450
An additional problem is that any of 
these issues may not have a solution 

1737
01:36:32,510 --> 01:36:34,850
that we can happily live with.
Right?

1738
01:36:34,851 --> 01:36:36,770
So it'd be takes it.
Let's sharpen this up.

1739
01:36:36,771 --> 01:36:39,800
And this was more in the interest of 
steel manning our critics.

1740
01:36:40,490 --> 01:36:43,730
You take a problem like immigration 
right now,

1741
01:36:43,790 --> 01:36:44,310
the,
the,

1742
01:36:44,350 --> 01:36:47,120
the,
the intuition that's driving the left.

1743
01:36:47,350 --> 01:36:51,050
Let's take the extreme case of an open 
borders ethic.

1744
01:36:51,510 --> 01:36:56,510
Borders are illegitimate.
Borders are a principal,

1745
01:36:56,990 --> 01:37:01,990
a of of selfishness and xenophobia and 
and unearned privilege,

1746
01:37:05,030 --> 01:37:10,030
right?
None of us can take credit for the fact 

1747
01:37:10,030 --> 01:37:12,701
that we were born into the societies 
were born into a and yet we have all of 

1748
01:37:12,701 --> 01:37:17,291
the advantages of having been born there
and so it is with with all of you and 

1749
01:37:17,291 --> 01:37:21,721
the weird.
None of us are currently living through 

1750
01:37:21,721 --> 01:37:24,950
the civil war in Syria now and that's a 
good thing for all of us.

1751
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:30,260
And so the concern here is that the 
moment you say,

1752
01:37:30,261 --> 01:37:33,320
well,
immigration is potentially a problem,

1753
01:37:33,740 --> 01:37:34,310
right?
Immigrate.

1754
01:37:34,311 --> 01:37:39,311
We can't just throw open the borders to 
all of humanity because what would 

1755
01:37:40,131 --> 01:37:45,131
happen,
what would happen is people would 

1756
01:37:45,131 --> 01:37:46,390
continue to cross those borders until 
the,

1757
01:37:46,391 --> 01:37:47,570
the level of,
of,

1758
01:37:47,571 --> 01:37:52,571
of wellbeing in,
in the developed world diminished so 

1759
01:37:52,571 --> 01:37:55,650
much that there was no reason to cross 
the borders anymore.

1760
01:37:55,710 --> 01:37:56,310
Right?
It would be,

1761
01:37:56,311 --> 01:37:58,200
they would just say some principle of 
Osmosis.

1762
01:37:58,490 --> 01:38:02,060
Right?
So it's even.

1763
01:38:02,150 --> 01:38:05,940
It's even worse than that,
but the concern is that this is

1764
01:38:06,050 --> 01:38:11,050
totally ethically speaking,
this is a totally illegitimate situation

1765
01:38:12,580 --> 01:38:17,580
and to shine a bright enough light on 
any particular story in Syria,

1766
01:38:17,950 --> 01:38:20,750
say,
I mean you just give me the right family

1767
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:26,500
with children and I learned enough about
them and their plight and I recognize 

1768
01:38:26,781 --> 01:38:31,781
within 30 seconds that if I were them,
I would be desperate to get to Dublin or

1769
01:38:32,931 --> 01:38:36,590
New York or San Francisco or anywhere 
but Syria.

1770
01:38:36,730 --> 01:38:41,730
Right?
And it seems like a completely,

1771
01:38:42,980 --> 01:38:43,690
uh,

1772
01:38:44,290 --> 01:38:49,290
it seems evil to in any way perpetuate 
this lottery where you pulled a bad 

1773
01:38:51,311 --> 01:38:53,050
ticket and sorry,
that's.

1774
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:56,410
This defines the rest of your life and 
the lives of your children.

1775
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:57,860
And we,
and,

1776
01:38:57,990 --> 01:39:01,720
and it,
there is no bright line where any of us,

1777
01:39:01,721 --> 01:39:02,140
you know,
well,

1778
01:39:02,141 --> 01:39:07,141
meaning people,
wherever we are in the political 

1779
01:39:07,141 --> 01:39:07,141
spectrum or wherever we are in any other
question,

1780
01:39:07,141 --> 01:39:08,200
there's no bright line where we can say,
Aha,

1781
01:39:08,260 --> 01:39:13,260
that's exactly the,
as the solution that we know is ethical,

1782
01:39:14,050 --> 01:39:19,050
that we know we can defend against all 
comers and it can survive every test of 

1783
01:39:19,931 --> 01:39:24,931
narrative.
It just goes straight to the power of 

1784
01:39:24,931 --> 01:39:24,931
stories.
You tell it,

1785
01:39:24,931 --> 01:39:28,771
you tell people a compelling enough 
story about one little girl and it 

1786
01:39:28,771 --> 01:39:32,941
changes.
Policy isn't not what happened to 

1787
01:39:32,941 --> 01:39:32,941
Angola.
Merkel,

1788
01:39:32,941 --> 01:39:35,920
she was faced with one,
one d denied refugee and all of a sudden

1789
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:38,670
the policy for Europe changed.
Uh,

1790
01:39:38,671 --> 01:39:39,700
and so this is,
again,

1791
01:39:39,701 --> 01:39:44,701
this is a,
I'm not saying there's a solution to 

1792
01:39:44,701 --> 01:39:44,701
this,
but this is the fear,

1793
01:39:44,701 --> 01:39:44,701
the fear that there's,
there's an,

1794
01:39:44,701 --> 01:39:47,180
there's an imputation of callousness on 
the part of.

1795
01:39:47,550 --> 01:39:49,450
I'm speaking specifically to you 
Douglas,

1796
01:39:49,451 --> 01:39:51,040
because it's been your issue more than 
ours.

1797
01:39:51,860 --> 01:39:56,470
How callous must you be to be worrying 
about immigration?

1798
01:39:56,530 --> 01:40:01,530
And that's that.
That's obviously there's a counter 

1799
01:40:01,530 --> 01:40:02,230
argument from the right side,
but there is a,

1800
01:40:02,260 --> 01:40:05,590
there's an ethical core to it that is,
it's difficult to dismiss.

1801
01:40:05,670 --> 01:40:10,670
And this is something which,
I mean it's not just that issues almost 

1802
01:40:10,670 --> 01:40:13,311
every issue.
We were talking a bit about this dinner 

1803
01:40:13,311 --> 01:40:14,250
that we seem to be,
well,

1804
01:40:14,251 --> 01:40:19,251
we just aren't ready for the 
communications age women and we're just 

1805
01:40:19,561 --> 01:40:22,710
not ready for.
Our brains are not yet able to cope.

1806
01:40:23,550 --> 01:40:25,210
Let me give you an example.
Uh,

1807
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:30,380
the notion of private and public speech 
that's just basically evaporated so that

1808
01:40:30,780 --> 01:40:32,760
if you,
this is the problem,

1809
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:38,300
try out an idea with your friends.
Just throw around an idea.

1810
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:42,030
We've all done it for around ideas with 
your friends.

1811
01:40:42,031 --> 01:40:45,120
If even one person is videoing it and 
might post it,

1812
01:40:45,570 --> 01:40:47,810
this is what is the world.
We're all in it.

1813
01:40:47,940 --> 01:40:50,640
It's too dangerous to try things out 
for.

1814
01:40:50,641 --> 01:40:53,890
Most people have no borders and

1815
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:58,180
so this is it.
So we are always vulnerable that are,

1816
01:40:58,210 --> 01:41:00,040
for instance,
most people in Europe,

1817
01:41:00,041 --> 01:41:01,260
for instance,
one borders.

1818
01:41:01,270 --> 01:41:04,630
I mean like overwhelming majority in 
every country want there to be borders,

1819
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:10,260
but if you show them footage of somebody
being turned away at the border that 

1820
01:41:10,260 --> 01:41:10,810
morning,
there's like,

1821
01:41:10,811 --> 01:41:12,690
we don't know what to do with it.
We,

1822
01:41:12,740 --> 01:41:17,740
we,
we have abstract principles we need to 

1823
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:20,281
abide by.
We want to abide by everybody wants to 

1824
01:41:20,281 --> 01:41:22,420
buy,
but we don't know what to do in this 

1825
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:22,450
precisely this era.
And I think we've just got to,

1826
01:41:22,451 --> 01:41:27,451
among other things,
work and all sorts of ways to find ways 

1827
01:41:27,451 --> 01:41:31,711
to think about this.
At a deeper than the ones we've managed 

1828
01:41:31,711 --> 01:41:31,711
so far,
one of them,

1829
01:41:31,711 --> 01:41:35,431
yes,
is to cope with the idea of being 

1830
01:41:35,431 --> 01:41:38,490
unbelievable luck,
but we've got unbelievable luck and then

1831
01:41:40,271 --> 01:41:43,450
the questions from that.
If I'm lucky,

1832
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:47,020
what am I,
what am I priorities?

1833
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:49,900
What am my obligation?
What am I lucky?

1834
01:41:50,200 --> 01:41:51,190
What are my obligations?

1835
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:56,340
And some people say,
my obligation is to share my home with 

1836
01:41:56,340 --> 01:41:56,380
the rest of the world.
In fact,

1837
01:41:56,390 --> 01:42:01,390
it's not that it's worse than that 
because it's because I know lots of 

1838
01:42:01,390 --> 01:42:02,470
people who've taken in a refugee and 
things like that.

1839
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:07,500
Okay.
And I have unbelievable admiration for 

1840
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:07,500
them.
That's really working the walk,

1841
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:07,500
but it's a different thing

1842
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:12,470
called your bluff when you said,
I don't see you taking in refugees into 

1843
01:42:12,470 --> 01:42:12,470
your home.
And they said,

1844
01:42:12,470 --> 01:42:12,470
oh actually there's one of the.

1845
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:16,270
I always wanted to turn up to their 
houses with some refugees.

1846
01:42:16,350 --> 01:42:21,130
Say I've got yours and go there also 
aren't 50 in the living room.

1847
01:42:21,430 --> 01:42:22,700
Exactly.
So,

1848
01:42:23,200 --> 01:42:24,160
so,
so let's,

1849
01:42:24,161 --> 01:42:26,920
let's,
let's elaborate on this a bit more.

1850
01:42:27,310 --> 01:42:30,820
Okay.
So the issue is borders exclude,

1851
01:42:31,430 --> 01:42:33,460
right?
That's a postmodern proposition,

1852
01:42:33,461 --> 01:42:36,010
or maybe you can take that even further 
than borders,

1853
01:42:36,011 --> 01:42:38,530
excluding privileged those within the 
borders.

1854
01:42:38,950 --> 01:42:39,970
It's like,
yes.

1855
01:42:40,450 --> 01:42:41,950
Okay,
so let's take that seriously.

1856
01:42:41,951 --> 01:42:44,080
Now I'm part of this.
Seriousness is poor.

1857
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:48,190
Innocent children are hurt at borders.
That happens all the time.

1858
01:42:49,350 --> 01:42:50,410
Okay?
The question is,

1859
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:54,160
are you willing to give up the borders?
Now,

1860
01:42:54,161 --> 01:42:58,900
let's think about what borders are.
Your skin is a border,

1861
01:43:00,250 --> 01:43:03,070
okay,
and your prejudice in protection of your

1862
01:43:03,071 --> 01:43:04,240
skin.
For example,

1863
01:43:04,241 --> 01:43:09,241
you won't just sleep with anyone.
You reserve the right to keep that 

1864
01:43:09,241 --> 01:43:10,600
border in tact,
right?

1865
01:43:10,601 --> 01:43:13,630
And to be choosy about the manner in 
which it's broached,

1866
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:16,300
you're,
you likely have a bedroom.

1867
01:43:16,300 --> 01:43:19,210
It probably has walls.
You have clothing,

1868
01:43:19,870 --> 01:43:21,880
you have a house,
you have a town,

1869
01:43:22,330 --> 01:43:24,790
you have a state,
you have a country,

1870
01:43:25,090 --> 01:43:27,730
and those are all borders.
It's borders within borders,

1871
01:43:27,731 --> 01:43:29,110
within borders,
without borders,

1872
01:43:29,260 --> 01:43:32,320
and you need those borders because 
otherwise you will die,

1873
01:43:33,340 --> 01:43:38,340
so we could not be too hypocritical 
about the damn borders is like we don't 

1874
01:43:38,340 --> 01:43:41,800
know how to organize fragile things 
without putting boundaries around them.

1875
01:43:41,980 --> 01:43:43,540
When you see that in Genesis,
right?

1876
01:43:43,610 --> 01:43:48,610
As soon as people realize that I'm 
sneaking in little religion here in 

1877
01:43:48,610 --> 01:43:51,661
case,
as soon as people realize they become 

1878
01:43:51,661 --> 01:43:52,160
self conscious,
they wake

1879
01:43:52,160 --> 01:43:57,160
up and realize their vulnerability.
The first thing they do is manufacturer 

1880
01:43:57,160 --> 01:44:00,290
a border between them and the world and 
we need borders between us and the world

1881
01:44:00,470 --> 01:44:04,280
and we pay a bloody price for borders 
and I say those words very carefully.

1882
01:44:04,610 --> 01:44:09,610
We play.
Pay a bloody price for borders and it's 

1883
01:44:09,610 --> 01:44:11,270
often in the price of other people's 
blood and so then the question might be,

1884
01:44:11,271 --> 01:44:16,271
well,
how should you conduct yourself 

1885
01:44:16,271 --> 01:44:17,210
ethically in a world where other people 
are paying in blood for your borders?

1886
01:44:17,510 --> 01:44:22,510
And the answer that I've been trying to 
communicate to people is get your damn 

1887
01:44:22,510 --> 01:44:24,740
house in order.
As much responsibility as you can,

1888
01:44:24,741 --> 01:44:27,950
act as effectively as you can as an 
individual in the world.

1889
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:31,250
Because then you can justify your 
privilege.

1890
01:44:31,370 --> 01:44:36,050
You can justify your luck and your good 
fortune and maybe within the confines of

1891
01:44:36,051 --> 01:44:41,051
your border you can be more productive 
and useful than you would be in the 

1892
01:44:41,051 --> 01:44:42,890
absolute absence of borders altogether.

1893
01:44:43,250 --> 01:44:46,970
And it seems to me that that's the case 
and then we have to have a discussion.

1894
01:44:46,971 --> 01:44:51,971
Okay,
the left doesn't like borders and the 

1895
01:44:51,971 --> 01:44:52,370
right is more fond of them and they're 
both right.

1896
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:55,580
And so because we don't know how strict 
the borders should be,

1897
01:44:55,581 --> 01:44:58,100
all how permeable it should be.
It shouldn't be absolute,

1898
01:44:58,101 --> 01:45:01,820
so nothing moves between borders and 
everything dies them.

1899
01:45:01,821 --> 01:45:04,460
But if the borders disappeared then we 
can't survive.

1900
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:07,250
So we have to have a discussion about 
borders all the time.

1901
01:45:07,251 --> 01:45:10,010
And that's partly that.
It's partly what we're doing here.

1902
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:11,750
We have to be more sophisticated

1903
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:17,500
things.
Very few people end up getting held 

1904
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:20,650
accountable for their own use in this 
matter as an amongst so many others.

1905
01:45:21,250 --> 01:45:26,250
There's an enormous amount to gain by 
saying something that's wrong and 

1906
01:45:26,250 --> 01:45:29,920
there's very little to gain by saying 
something is right on this.

1907
01:45:30,660 --> 01:45:31,790
I mean you just.

1908
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:35,830
Just a world of suffering and look

1909
01:45:36,230 --> 01:45:37,880
problem with this.
I mean this is,

1910
01:45:38,420 --> 01:45:43,420
this is your,
this is your area of politics more than 

1911
01:45:43,420 --> 01:45:46,991
it is mine.
But these lines that are being put down 

1912
01:45:46,991 --> 01:45:48,170
on the left at the moment of which this 
is one,

1913
01:45:49,430 --> 01:45:54,430
these other ones that are now coming up.
I mean you see today's one,

1914
01:45:55,130 --> 01:45:58,990
you can't act a role that you're on your
hands.

1915
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:03,830
You can't pretend to be someone else.
Like this is a brand new rule.

1916
01:46:04,870 --> 01:46:08,890
I'm talking about a Scarlett Johansson 
who was cast in the film as a trans

1917
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:14,520
for transgender woman.
I think Amanda Woman,

1918
01:46:15,550 --> 01:46:17,650
it might've been the other way around,
but it's scarcely matters.

1919
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:19,780
Oh,
it matches.

1920
01:46:20,730 --> 01:46:23,910
That's your fascist movements.
That's my privilege.

1921
01:46:25,190 --> 01:46:27,560
Interesting.
Because that's actually a boundary to.

1922
01:46:27,590 --> 01:46:32,590
That's actually a border to it.
So it's another case where these things 

1923
01:46:32,590 --> 01:46:33,740
reverse in a perverse manner.
Like where did that one

1924
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:34,240
come from?

1925
01:46:35,180 --> 01:46:40,180
Yeah,
well it probably came from the west 

1926
01:46:40,180 --> 01:46:40,180
coast.

1927
01:46:41,620 --> 01:46:41,980
Yeah,

1928
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:46,220
yeah.
It,

1929
01:46:46,221 --> 01:46:51,221
it seems to me that we need to somehow 
get comfortable with the increasingly 

1930
01:46:55,831 --> 01:47:00,831
public moments of,
of uncertainty on topics like this 

1931
01:47:00,831 --> 01:47:03,900
because so much of so much of safety and
reputational safety,

1932
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:09,500
as you were just alluding,
is predicated in the public sphere in 

1933
01:47:11,550 --> 01:47:16,550
either pretending to be certain or,
or false sleeping certain on a safe 

1934
01:47:17,431 --> 01:47:22,431
answer,
a safe and wrong answer to a 

1935
01:47:22,431 --> 01:47:22,431
complicated.
All

1936
01:47:22,760 --> 01:47:24,590
part of this is,
is,

1937
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:25,460
is,
um,

1938
01:47:25,730 --> 01:47:30,730
the pathology of basal instinct.
And so because the rule now is if I feel

1939
01:47:32,481 --> 01:47:34,190
sorry for you,
I'm good.

1940
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:35,990
Right?
And so,

1941
01:47:36,050 --> 01:47:41,050
so let's say there's a complex situation
that requires a tremendous amount of 

1942
01:47:41,050 --> 01:47:46,000
adult cognitive computation to solve,
like what do we do about the borders?

1943
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:49,310
Because tearing them down is not the 
answer.

1944
01:47:49,610 --> 01:47:52,130
Well,
the person who stands up and says,

1945
01:47:52,610 --> 01:47:54,860
well,
I see someone who's hurt by a border and

1946
01:47:54,861 --> 01:47:57,710
I feel empathy for them.
Then immediately says,

1947
01:47:57,830 --> 01:48:01,100
therefore I'm good,
which isn't so bad,

1948
01:48:01,130 --> 01:48:04,790
but therefore I'm also morally superior 
to you.

1949
01:48:05,210 --> 01:48:10,210
And this is.
This is one of the true pathologies of 

1950
01:48:10,210 --> 01:48:12,230
the empathic collectivists is that they 
presume that they reflects of empathy,

1951
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:17,800
marks them out as morally superior,
and that's appalling because part of it 

1952
01:48:17,800 --> 01:48:18,380
is a.
it's too easy.

1953
01:48:18,381 --> 01:48:23,381
Just because I feel sorry for you.
It doesn't mean I'm good partly because 

1954
01:48:23,381 --> 01:48:26,620
I can feel so sorry for you that I'm 
actually harmful to you and that's what 

1955
01:48:26,620 --> 01:48:28,070
happens in the case of over protective 
parents,

1956
01:48:28,071 --> 01:48:30,050
for example,
so we know perfectly well

1957
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:36,570
that empathy is not an untrammeled moral
virtue.

1958
01:48:36,571 --> 01:48:41,571
It has to be tempered by other virtues 
and carefully tempered by other virtues 

1959
01:48:41,571 --> 01:48:46,400
and so we have to stop allowing in our 
public discourse the unquestioned 

1960
01:48:46,441 --> 01:48:51,441
assumption that just because I manifest 
more pity in the moment than you do that

1961
01:48:51,691 --> 01:48:54,340
I'm somehow morally superior 
individually.

1962
01:48:54,360 --> 01:48:56,190
In fact,
not only do we have to question that,

1963
01:48:56,191 --> 01:49:00,210
we fact have to.
We have to deeply question it and say,

1964
01:49:00,630 --> 01:49:05,630
what makes you think that you're.
That you're just not taking things too 

1965
01:49:05,630 --> 01:49:09,501
far right there because there's just as 
much error on the side of too much 

1966
01:49:09,501 --> 01:49:13,371
empathy as there is on the side of too 
little empathy and that's a hard thing 

1967
01:49:13,371 --> 01:49:14,280
for everyone to learn because empathy 
feels so good.

1968
01:49:14,460 --> 01:49:18,630
Like if you feel mercy towards us 
suffering child,

1969
01:49:18,631 --> 01:49:22,440
it's like that is kind of an indication 
that you're an ethical person,

1970
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:27,360
but that's not the basis for complex and
sophisticated foreign policy.

1971
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:29,520
No,
it isn't because

1972
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:31,740
it

1973
01:49:34,850 --> 01:49:39,850
we know our empathy diminishes it almost
linear way with the numbers of people to

1974
01:49:42,771 --> 01:49:44,090
empathize with.
Right?

1975
01:49:44,091 --> 01:49:46,850
So how we spoke about this one night in 
Vancouver,

1976
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:52,140
but this has been tested.
Where did you tell someone about the 

1977
01:49:52,140 --> 01:49:55,801
plight of one little girl?
You will elicit the maximum empathic 

1978
01:49:55,801 --> 01:50:00,181
response and the Mat.
The maximum of an altruistic response 

1979
01:50:00,181 --> 01:50:01,150
that they'll get the most amount of 
money they're going to give to any cause

1980
01:50:01,390 --> 01:50:04,540
to one compelling story to save one 
little boy or girl,

1981
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:09,960
but if you start adding boys and girls 
to the to the one keeping the one the 

1982
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:13,771
same,
people's empathy degrades and their 

1983
01:50:13,771 --> 01:50:13,771
actual at their altruism degrees.
So.

1984
01:50:13,771 --> 01:50:17,250
So empathy is non quantitative almost by
definition.

1985
01:50:17,251 --> 01:50:17,290
Yeah.

1986
01:50:17,310 --> 01:50:22,310
It's also partly because in your life if
you see a person in trouble,

1987
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:28,320
something,
but if you see 100 million people in 

1988
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:31,731
trouble,
what you should probably do at least to 

1989
01:50:31,731 --> 01:50:33,140
begin with is run and what are you going
to do it?

1990
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:36,500
Maybe you could give a thousand dollars 
to one person,

1991
01:50:36,740 --> 01:50:38,790
but if you divided that up among a 
million,

1992
01:50:38,850 --> 01:50:40,040
all of that would happen.
Would you?

1993
01:50:40,041 --> 01:50:45,041
Would you wouldn't be have.
You would have no money and they 

1994
01:50:45,041 --> 01:50:45,041
wouldn't be any better off.

1995
01:50:45,041 --> 01:50:45,041
But,
but,

1996
01:50:45,041 --> 01:50:49,900
but this is just say that so much of of 
moral progress today entails unhooking 

1997
01:50:53,030 --> 01:50:58,030
from the highly salient empathy driving 
story and connecting with the actual 

1998
01:50:59,811 --> 01:51:03,920
quantitative reality to learn that it's 
500,000

1999
01:51:03,921 --> 01:51:07,970
people dying every year from heart 
disease or whatever it is,

2000
01:51:08,750 --> 01:51:10,850
or there's,
there's this is 500,000

2001
01:51:10,851 --> 01:51:15,851
people dying for this family.
The fact that that that can't be made 

2002
01:51:15,861 --> 01:51:18,470
sexy for,
for our news cycle,

2003
01:51:18,500 --> 01:51:23,500
right?
The fact that we lose attention is 

2004
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:23,500
something we have to figure out how to

2005
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:26,790
and also it can.
It's very interestingly akin to your 

2006
01:51:26,790 --> 01:51:28,580
objection that you raised before is that
there are,

2007
01:51:28,620 --> 01:51:33,620
there are adult forms of solving 
problems that aren't akin to children's 

2008
01:51:33,620 --> 01:51:33,850
play,
which is something by the way,

2009
01:51:33,851 --> 01:51:38,851
I agree with because I don't think that 
the manner in which children organized 

2010
01:51:38,851 --> 01:51:40,630
the world is the end of the way that 
things should be organized.

2011
01:51:40,631 --> 01:51:42,850
It's the basis for some of the 
organization,

2012
01:51:42,851 --> 01:51:47,851
but this is akin to the same issue,
is that the basal motivational 

2013
01:51:48,161 --> 01:51:53,161
responses,
the emotional response is no matter how 

2014
01:51:53,161 --> 01:51:55,771
well meaning aren't sufficient 
conceptual sophistication to deal with 

2015
01:51:55,781 --> 01:51:59,770
incredibly elaborate and complex systems
and then you have another problem too,

2016
01:51:59,771 --> 01:52:00,550
is that,
well,

2017
01:52:00,551 --> 01:52:05,551
that's really troublesome for people 
because they want to do the right thing 

2018
01:52:05,551 --> 01:52:06,220
globally and then you tell them,
look,

2019
01:52:06,221 --> 01:52:10,150
you don't know anything.
You don't know how to take this insanely

2020
01:52:10,151 --> 01:52:13,300
complicated system that we have and 
improve it,

2021
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:18,360
and just because you're feeling pity 
doesn't mean that you're an expert in 

2022
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:20,530
the retooling of hydroelectric systems.
For example,

2023
01:52:20,590 --> 01:52:22,990
and this one has one straightforward way
to do that.

2024
01:52:22,991 --> 01:52:24,520
I mean,
given the example,

2025
01:52:25,690 --> 01:52:30,670
there's a Kurdish demographer who lives,
who's Swedish citizen now who cited this

2026
01:52:30,671 --> 01:52:35,671
fact that it costs the same amount one 
refugee and keep them in Sweden as it 

2027
01:52:37,180 --> 01:52:40,060
does to look after 100 refugees in 
Jordan,

2028
01:52:40,090 --> 01:52:42,300
Turkey or Lebanon.
Okay?

2029
01:52:42,970 --> 01:52:44,290
So the obvious thing from that,
if you say,

2030
01:52:44,291 --> 01:52:45,600
look,
it's madness

2031
01:52:46,390 --> 01:52:47,390
to be,
for instance,

2032
01:52:47,391 --> 01:52:49,820
bringing in thousands of refugees to 
Sweden.

2033
01:52:49,821 --> 01:52:52,940
You could be looking after hundreds of 
thousands of people in the region.

2034
01:52:53,210 --> 01:52:56,600
Why is that still a tainted argument is 
because people aren't sure.

2035
01:52:56,601 --> 01:52:59,710
You're not going to smuggle in racism.
That's what I think.

2036
01:52:59,930 --> 01:53:04,930
Are you sure you're not just coming up 
with this democracy stuff in order like 

2037
01:53:04,930 --> 01:53:07,550
you're smuggling in Hitler just typed 
smuggling Jesus.

2038
01:53:07,551 --> 01:53:10,100
You're going to start with NGO figures 
and before we know it,

2039
01:53:10,101 --> 01:53:12,100
it's outfits.
That's what they think.

2040
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:17,800
But here's the thing.
This is the shortcut solution to 

2041
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:21,491
answering.
Almost every single one of these 

2042
01:53:21,491 --> 01:53:22,910
problems is assume that your 
interlocutor has good motives,

2043
01:53:24,020 --> 01:53:28,130
that they are being on this in the way 
that they're looking at it

2044
01:53:28,710 --> 01:53:31,200
and that's when I say comments about 
that.

2045
01:53:31,201 --> 01:53:31,550
Okay,
so

2046
01:53:31,630 --> 01:53:34,450
this is something I deal with in my 
clinical practice all the time.

2047
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:39,960
Okay.
So imagine that you're naive and then 

2048
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:44,520
what you are when you're naive as 
someone who thinks you trust people 

2049
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:46,300
because you think everybody has good 
motivations,

2050
01:53:46,301 --> 01:53:50,020
which is some sense with douglass is a 
recommended it and I'd say,

2051
01:53:50,021 --> 01:53:51,350
well that's just naive.
It's like,

2052
01:53:51,460 --> 01:53:55,000
just wait a second though because here's
the developmental pathway.

2053
01:53:55,420 --> 01:54:00,420
First year naive and you trust everyone 
and then someone cuts you off at the 

2054
01:54:00,420 --> 01:54:04,321
knees or multiple people do,
or maybe you cut yourself off at the 

2055
01:54:04,321 --> 01:54:07,891
knees because you trusted yourself too 
much and you didn't take into account 

2056
01:54:07,891 --> 01:54:10,060
the malevolence that lurks in your heart
and the hearts of others and so that you

2057
01:54:10,061 --> 01:54:14,980
get traumatized by betrayal and then you
become cynical and you think,

2058
01:54:14,981 --> 01:54:19,981
Jesus,
I'm a lot smarter now that I'm cynical 

2059
01:54:19,981 --> 01:54:21,160
and you are because cynical is actually 
a move up on naive,

2060
01:54:21,670 --> 01:54:26,670
but it's not the last move.
The last move is to transcend cynicism 

2061
01:54:26,910 --> 01:54:31,910
and to say that even though I know that 
there are just as many snakes in your 

2062
01:54:31,910 --> 01:54:35,821
heart as there are in my heart,
I'm going to hold out my hand in trust 

2063
01:54:35,821 --> 01:54:37,270
because that's the best way to elevate 
both of us.

2064
01:54:37,650 --> 01:54:42,650
That is the prerequisite for a sensitive
discussion to concede that

2065
01:54:46,440 --> 01:54:51,440
going on about our stuff along this to 
concede that it's not between good and 

2066
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:54,890
evil but between competing virtues.
But when it comes to something like the 

2067
01:54:54,890 --> 01:54:57,390
board has discussion,
you're dealing with justice and mercy.

2068
01:54:57,690 --> 01:55:00,290
You can not only be driven by one of 
those virtues,

2069
01:55:00,510 --> 01:55:05,510
mercy itself will lead you to hell.
Justice on its own wind unseeing can 

2070
01:55:07,171 --> 01:55:08,030
lead you to hell.
Yes,

2071
01:55:08,031 --> 01:55:08,120
yes,

2072
01:55:08,200 --> 01:55:09,220
exactly.
Well,

2073
01:55:09,221 --> 01:55:14,221
and so this also,
and we're running very short on time 

2074
01:55:14,221 --> 01:55:16,420
here,
so we should have think this is also why

2075
01:55:16,421 --> 01:55:21,421
your emphasis on truth and the emphasis 
on truth is so absolutely important 

2076
01:55:21,421 --> 01:55:25,220
because you and I obviously differ in on
a variety of different things and,

2077
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:27,490
and uh,
as Douglas does with both of us.

2078
01:55:27,491 --> 01:55:30,280
But you know,
that doesn't mean.

2079
01:55:30,580 --> 01:55:33,040
That doesn't mean that I think that 
you're a bad person.

2080
01:55:33,400 --> 01:55:38,400
I don't think that actually what I,
what I think and what I fervently hope 

2081
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:42,331
is that some of the things that you 
think are wrong actually turn out to be 

2082
01:55:42,331 --> 01:55:45,380
right in a way that would extremely 
helpful to me at everyone.

2083
01:55:45,390 --> 01:55:50,390
I know if I incorporated them.
Like I really hope that because I'd 

2084
01:55:50,390 --> 01:55:53,871
rather not be stupid and wrong if I 
could help it because then I don't have 

2085
01:55:53,871 --> 01:55:53,871
to wander into a pit.

2086
01:55:53,940 --> 01:55:58,050
And so I'm hoping that if,
if we can have a genuine dialogue and we

2087
01:55:58,051 --> 01:56:00,840
can tell each other the truth,
which is the crucial issue here,

2088
01:56:01,020 --> 01:56:06,020
then I can find out what you know that I
don't know and that'll make me stronger 

2089
01:56:06,020 --> 01:56:09,531
and it will fortify everyone around me 
and that's the basis for the right and 

2090
01:56:09,531 --> 01:56:11,400
responsibility of free speech,
right?

2091
01:56:11,401 --> 01:56:16,401
You have the right of free speech,
but that's so that you can be a 

2092
01:56:16,401 --> 01:56:19,251
responsible bearer of free speech so 
that you can say the truth so that you 

2093
01:56:20,551 --> 01:56:24,000
can set the world right in,
adjust the hierarchies and make sure the

2094
01:56:24,001 --> 01:56:29,001
borders are properly functional and so 
that we can keep this thing going 

2095
01:56:29,001 --> 01:56:30,810
properly and that is all dependent,
at least in part,

2096
01:56:31,140 --> 01:56:36,140
in large part on the truth.
But also to some degree on this faculty 

2097
01:56:36,140 --> 01:56:37,770
that you described is rational because 
we're engaged in Iraq.

2098
01:56:37,830 --> 01:56:40,650
I know rationality isn't denounced that 
that's my sense,

2099
01:56:40,651 --> 01:56:45,651
you know,
but it's certainly an adult form of 

2100
01:56:45,651 --> 01:56:47,400
communication and definitely the 
prerequisite to a discussion like this,

2101
01:56:47,610 --> 01:56:52,610
which seems to be highly useful and 
which I'm so happy that you're all 

2102
01:56:52,610 --> 01:56:57,100
willing to participate in how strangely,
how strange that is not.

2103
01:57:03,530 --> 01:57:08,530
Yes.
Well we've been showing various cards 

2104
01:57:08,530 --> 01:57:10,410
that had diminishing increments of time 
and now they have just stopped showing 

2105
01:57:10,410 --> 01:57:14,861
us car.
It's because we're totally 

2106
01:57:14,861 --> 01:57:14,861
encourageable.
But uh,

2107
01:57:14,861 --> 01:57:15,880
yeah.
I just want to reiterate what,

2108
01:57:15,910 --> 01:57:20,910
what Jordan's just said there are.
You all really are the occasion for this

2109
01:57:21,261 --> 01:57:22,730
conversation.
Even though you are,

2110
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:27,880
are in the audience and we're on stage.
We very much feel that this conversation

2111
01:57:28,491 --> 01:57:33,491
is with all of you and we know the 
conversation continues in your lives and

2112
01:57:33,570 --> 01:57:34,340
it,
again,

2113
01:57:34,341 --> 01:57:37,320
it's just a tremendous honor to show up 
and,

2114
01:57:37,380 --> 01:57:39,680
and,
and meet all of you in this space.

2115
01:57:39,681 --> 01:57:41,450
And so thank you for that.

2116
01:57:45,560 --> 01:57:49,610
I want to,
I want to thank.

2117
01:57:50,210 --> 01:57:51,500
I want to thank both of these men.

2118
01:57:51,980 --> 01:57:56,980
We,
we've never gotten together before like 

2119
01:57:56,980 --> 01:57:56,980
this and it's really,
it's a.

2120
01:57:56,980 --> 01:58:00,610
it's a great pleasure to be confronted 
and cajoled and ate your company.

2121
01:58:02,250 --> 01:58:02,420
Yeah.

2122
01:58:02,950 --> 01:58:07,950
Thank you.
Thank you.

2123
01:58:12,790 --> 01:58:14,710
Thank you.
Thank you all very much.
