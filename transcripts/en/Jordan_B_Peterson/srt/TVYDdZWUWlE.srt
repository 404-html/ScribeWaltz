1
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,310
Ladies and Gentlemen,
please welcome John Anderson.

2
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:05,020
[inaudible]

3
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,880
well, Jordan and Dave, thank you
so much for giving us your time.

4
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,920
John anderson.net is basically
dedicated to something that is very,

5
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:29,921
very dear to me as someone who is very
worried about our country and where we're

6
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:33,140
going.
And it's that you cannot,

7
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,790
cannot get good public policy
without a good public debate.

8
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,130
And it's seems now we don't have
debates anymore. We just have abusive,

9
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,930
emotional mudslinging.

10
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,820
So that's the sort of
the background theme. Uh,

11
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:54,850
but then we come to this incredible
opportunity today to engage with these two

12
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:55,904
gentlemen.

13
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,600
And I wanted to get the ball rolling
by talking about a number of issues.

14
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,490
Firstly, personal responsibility.
Then I'd like to move on to freedom.

15
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,900
What is it?
Because it's not licensed.

16
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,840
It's not what so many people think it
is today. And how do we make it work?

17
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,250
I didn't want to talk about courage
because we're going to need a lot of it

18
00:02:19,251 --> 00:02:22,280
going forward and you're
going to hear a lot.

19
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:26,150
I would see demonstrated some real courage
I think here and what we're going to

20
00:02:26,151 --> 00:02:28,940
talk about and what you're going to hear,
what you're going to witness.

21
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,450
Then a bit about social media and how we
make it all work and then it's over to

22
00:02:34,461 --> 00:02:39,310
you.
We live in an age when,

23
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,230
okay.

24
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,550
It seems that

25
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,990
there's a crisis of trust in our culture.

26
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:54,090
It seems that we are very uncertain of
our institutions and the people who make

27
00:02:57,251 --> 00:03:02,251
them up and what their might be and
indeed the research backs that up.

28
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,900
The Australian National University has
been tracking Australia's confidence in

29
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:15,901
their politicians and the political
process now for many decades we are in

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,290
unchartered waters,

31
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:21,340
record numbers of Australians no
longer have confidence in the system,

32
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:26,440
record numbers of Australians now distrust
the political process and the players

33
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:27,274
in it.

34
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,020
Just more recently we've had the latest
of a series of royal commissions of

35
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:34,540
inquiry into various institutions.

36
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:39,541
This times banking and the financial
services and we learnt that we couldn't

37
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,880
trust bankers.
Now,

38
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:47,800
there are many trustworthy bankers in
case there are any here, but plainly,

39
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,080
people were deeply
concerned by what merged.

40
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:56,190
And you stop and think about this when
people are in relationships of trust,

41
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,020
harmony and progress can be
made when it breaks down.

42
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,590
How many and progress are impaired
and people flee for safety.

43
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,080
If you don't feel safe with someone else,

44
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:16,040
you'll look for the rule book and you'll
look for policing and you'll look for

45
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:19,070
protection. So that's a good thing. We've
had the royal commission of inquiry,

46
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,040
so we know what's been going on. It's
a good thing. We've got the rest,

47
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:26,840
78 recommendations, new laws everywhere,
new surveillance, new policing.

48
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,550
But it's a tragedy that it was necessary
in the first place that people have not

49
00:04:31,551 --> 00:04:35,960
been doing what they've should
have been doing without coercion.

50
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,800
So now we've got a great big battle
as to how to resolve these things.

51
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:43,880
You say the law based approach,
but Jordan, you've said
something quite different.

52
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,290
Uh,
in the midst of all of us,

53
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:50,291
what you have said is that the
redemption of the world is not political.

54
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,870
It happens at the level of the individual.

55
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,530
That's not what we hear on the media
every night there's a new scandal.

56
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,060
It's we need more rules, we need more
policing, we need more surveillance,

57
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,480
we need a different party in power.
You're not saying that.

58
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,000
You're saying it comes back to the end.

59
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,320
The first question is do you want that?

60
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,970
Do you want a more a state
with more regulatory power?

61
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,260
Do you want a state with more
surveillance? I mean, first of all,

62
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,250
why would you think that that would
be trustworthy when all the evidence

63
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:28,060
suggests in the past that as the
state expands its surveillance power,

64
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:32,170
it actually becomes less trustworthy
rather than more. And why would you want,

65
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:37,030
you might think, well, I certainly
want someone looking into your affairs,

66
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,300
but I don't want anybody
looking into mine. Well,

67
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:42,130
good luck with that because you know,

68
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:46,210
to the degree that I have someone elect
someone to look into your affairs,

69
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:48,760
they're bloody well going to
be looking into mine as well.

70
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,750
And that just doesn't strike me as
a particularly positive development.

71
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,020
And practically because I
don't believe it'll work.

72
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:58,880
I don't think surveillance states
do make people more honest.

73
00:05:58,881 --> 00:06:01,520
I think all the evidence is the opposite.

74
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,760
And then I would say from
the individual perspective,

75
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:09,710
it's like I believe that the,
the fundamental,

76
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,090
what we got fundamentally
right in the West,

77
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:16,550
because there was a number of things
we've got fundamentally right,

78
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:18,800
even though we don't like
to admit that anymore,

79
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,040
is that the ultimate moral responsibility
for the state relies on you.

80
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,420
It relies on your moral
integrity and you know you can,

81
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,800
it's not that hard to think that through.
It's like,

82
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,360
well first of all, you have the
right and the responsibility to vote.

83
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,060
And we can say, well, that's not
exactly given to you by the state. It's,

84
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:50,960
it's something that exists in some, in
some sense, outside and before the state.

85
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,290
It's part and parcel of
your intrinsic value. Okay.

86
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,110
So that's a decision that we've
made in the west, that each person,

87
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,210
regardless of their flaws,

88
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:04,390
is characterized by a value and intrinsic
value that's so deep and so profound

89
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,110
that the very,

90
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,790
a regulation of the state
itself rests on their shoulders.

91
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,530
And that's really something that's,

92
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,360
that's why you have the right to
vote and that's worth thinking about.

93
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,320
The first question is, well, do you
think that's a good idea or not?

94
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,130
I do believe that we are in
fact sovereign individuals.

95
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:29,240
And then while let's assume
that you believe that we are,

96
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,660
because the alternative is
some sort of autocracy, right?

97
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,730
It's some sort of tyranny. It's, it's the,

98
00:07:34,731 --> 00:07:39,140
it's the parsing off of that sovereignty
to a bureaucracy or to some arbitrary

99
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,530
form of leadership and maybe you can
believe in that and you'd like a strong

100
00:07:42,531 --> 00:07:46,970
leader and fine, but you want to think
that through because if, if it's not that,

101
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:49,340
then it's you.
Well then it's,

102
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:53,960
if it's you and you have to make sure that
the ship of state is sailing properly,

103
00:07:53,961 --> 00:07:58,340
then the first thing you might want to
ask yourself is what makes you think

104
00:07:58,341 --> 00:08:00,740
you're any more trustworthy
than the people that you're,

105
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,760
that you're despising or criticizing.
I mean if,

106
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:10,770
if you are well more power to you but it
isn't self evident that you are and my

107
00:08:10,971 --> 00:08:15,740
suspicions are that it's not even self
evident to you that you are because it's

108
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:17,930
a very rare person that you come across.

109
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,110
If you talk to them with any
degree of seriousness, you know,

110
00:08:21,111 --> 00:08:23,330
they're able to lay out a whole litany of,

111
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:27,620
of ways they fall short of their
own values, their own values,

112
00:08:27,621 --> 00:08:31,160
not values that other people are
putting on them. Certainly that as well.

113
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:35,810
And they can name innumerable ways that
not only are they not doing what they

114
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:38,750
shouldn't be doing, so they're
falling short of the mark in that way,

115
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:43,820
but they're doing all sorts of things but
they definitely shouldn't be doing and

116
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:45,890
they know it. It's like, well,

117
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:53,310
we're going to put that right or not.
And my sense is,

118
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,930
you know,
I wrote a rule in my,

119
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:59,910
put your house in perfect order before
you complain about the world before you

120
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:03,060
criticize the world. What's
the idea? It's like, well,

121
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,830
you're the sovereign man.
If the states,

122
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:12,090
if the ship of state is listing
and sinking, that's you.

123
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,610
That's your problem. It's your
fault. You're not doing it right.

124
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,330
You're not educated enough, you're not
awake enough. You're not articulated in,

125
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,180
I tried to articulate it enough.
You don't know enough about history.

126
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,280
You're not taking on
enough responsibility.

127
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,390
You're looking for other people to
blame because it's convenient and, and,

128
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:35,160
and that's kind of understandable because
it's the dispersal of responsibility.

129
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,090
Who wants all that responsibility, but
there's a huge price to be paid for it.

130
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,630
The the first price that
you pay for it is, well,

131
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,520
there goes the adventure of your life.

132
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,710
It's like you could get yourself together
and be the bedrock of the state, right?

133
00:09:49,711 --> 00:09:53,820
That'd be hard ad call on everything that
you have. That would be your adventure.

134
00:09:53,821 --> 00:09:57,870
You're going to pass that off to someone
else and then then what do you do?

135
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:02,250
You've got nothing left in your life,
a triviality and you can't live.

136
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:07,170
I don't believe that people
can live ethically, trivially.

137
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:12,510
That's why I think the pursuit of the
idea that life is for happiness is wrong

138
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,200
because life is too difficult
for that to be the case.

139
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:21,380
Our lives are too profound
to characterized by
suffering and malevolence the

140
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:26,691
world is to characterized by trouble
at every level four happiness to be the

141
00:10:27,781 --> 00:10:28,740
proper solution.

142
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:34,320
There is the solution is something like
a heavy burden of ethical responsibility

143
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,440
that kind that sets the state straight.

144
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:41,160
And then in that you find
the purpose of your life.

145
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:46,490
And so not only if you want the external
monitoring and the surveillance state,

146
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:52,190
not only do you sacrifice your privacy
and invite all that invasive intention

147
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,380
and lose your impulsive freedom,

148
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,150
you lose everything that's profound
about your life and someone takes it from

149
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:04,890
you, they take your destiny from
you and that's no way to live.

150
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,873
That's just,

151
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,300
that's the tyranny that we've struggled
against in the West successfully for,

152
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,340
I would say in one way or another for,

153
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:19,490
for for a number of thousands of years
and with a substantial amount of success

154
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:24,060
to draw, dive into this. We met
in la a couple of years ago.

155
00:11:24,061 --> 00:11:27,640
I have a breakfast dive.
You're a great defender of culture to now.

156
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:32,080
When we met it was very interesting.
[inaudible] you set out the reasons, uh,

157
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:35,860
in a way for me to think he's
a card carrying progressive,

158
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,880
you know, you, you tell me where you
came from and what do you believe in,

159
00:11:39,881 --> 00:11:43,810
what you didn't, and then you
said, uh, and I'm gay married man.

160
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,970
And then you went on to say,

161
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:51,390
and I thank God every day I live in
Christian America and I thought that's a

162
00:11:51,551 --> 00:11:54,100
surprise turn in the,
and we had

163
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,990
a fantastic breakfast talking about it,

164
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:01,120
your defender of culture now all of our
cultural roots at a time when the West

165
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:05,500
seems to be its own worst enemy and
doesn't believe in its cultural roots.

166
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,290
Could you elaborate? Yeah, of
course. Well you know, first off,

167
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:12,280
as you guys I'm sure know Jordan and I
just left the Sydney Opera House a few

168
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,360
minutes ago and we've done about 120 some
odd shows where I've opened for Jordan

169
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:21,460
and it just struck me in the last two
minutes that having to follow you is much

170
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:26,200
less fun but having to go
before you, that's easy.

171
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:28,690
I'm usually just setting them up and
you're knocking it out of the park.

172
00:12:28,691 --> 00:12:31,930
But okay, I'll try. Um,
well just quickly on,

173
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:34,780
on what Jordan said about the individual
because it links exactly to that.

174
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:37,780
You know, people ask me all the
time in the Q and A's and uh,

175
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:40,030
in our meet and greets what,
what is going on?

176
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,880
Why is it that people are following this,

177
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,810
a psychologist talking about
lobsters all over the country. And,

178
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:52,020
and actually that question is what I
believe is the answer there is there has

179
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:57,901
been a complete obliteration for young
people to understand what being an

180
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:00,220
individual it is,

181
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:05,250
what being a person that owns your own
mind that decides to get out there and

182
00:13:05,801 --> 00:13:09,250
live the life they're supposed to live
that doesn't want to take from somebody

183
00:13:09,251 --> 00:13:11,650
and give to somebody else
or just take for themselves.

184
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,020
And that has really been lost.

185
00:13:14,021 --> 00:13:16,990
And what's been amazing to me is
we've done now 20 some odd countries.

186
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,670
Is that the same things that you guys are
thinking about in Sydney are the exact

187
00:13:21,671 --> 00:13:23,620
same things that people are
thinking about in Toronto,

188
00:13:23,621 --> 00:13:28,000
in Los Angeles and Stockholm.
And, and all over the country.

189
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:30,400
And that's absolutely fascinating.
So to your question,

190
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:35,440
because I am an individual,
that is what led me here,

191
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:39,310
that that's I think what led you to
want to have breakfast with me in Los

192
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,220
Angeles.
That the differences,

193
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:45,700
the immutable characteristics that we
either have in common or, or separate us,

194
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:49,120
whether it's sexuality or
gender or skin color, uh,

195
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,640
are completely irrelevant.

196
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,540
If we really want to be a
society that is truly free,

197
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:59,590
that truly respects each other, it
makes no difference. I mean, I do,

198
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:00,760
when I go to colleges,

199
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,010
I'll usually just single out
somebody in the crowd and it's like,

200
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:06,190
how sad would it be if I just
looked at you? And I was like, oh,

201
00:14:06,191 --> 00:14:08,530
well you're a white guy. You look
like you're in your early twenties.

202
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,520
As if that would give me any inclination
that I would have any insight into what

203
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:15,880
you think or how you should think
actually is the better point because you

204
00:14:15,881 --> 00:14:19,270
should think whatever you think and
hopefully be willing to have that exchange

205
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:20,230
of ideas.
Uh,

206
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:23,830
so I'm very appreciative that I live in
a Christian country because the simple

207
00:14:23,831 --> 00:14:27,160
fact is, while the media
will imply that, you know,

208
00:14:27,161 --> 00:14:30,760
every day there's another story on
how evil Christian White people are or

209
00:14:30,761 --> 00:14:32,200
something like that.
And by the way,

210
00:14:32,201 --> 00:14:34,590
I see that spreading all over the
world as well. I mean, there's a,

211
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,630
there's a weird thing going on with the
media where I thought it was really an

212
00:14:37,631 --> 00:14:42,010
American, a crumbling of the media, but
now I see it all over the place. Um,

213
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,970
I live in the freest country in
the history of the world, period.

214
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,800
The United States in 2019 is the freest
place in the history of the world.

215
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,370
You, you know, with the,
with the most tiny exceptions
on speech around, you know,

216
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:59,000
yelling fire in a crowded theater
or a direct threat of violence,

217
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,490
you can say whatever you want.

218
00:15:01,491 --> 00:15:04,490
And even being here in Australia where
you guys have it pretty good on speech,

219
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,910
I can tell people are jealous of,
of what America has.

220
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:09,070
And certainly when we were in,

221
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,530
in the UK where they have all sorts
of things where, you know, this,

222
00:15:12,531 --> 00:15:16,820
this Youtube Creator Count [inaudible]
had his dog, uh, you know, do the,

223
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,480
do the Nazi salute and, and gotten
all sorts of trouble. I mean,

224
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:24,820
we won't have this forever. And
that, that's very clear to me.

225
00:15:24,821 --> 00:15:27,100
And I would just add this,
that Douglas Murray,

226
00:15:27,101 --> 00:15:31,540
who I'm sure you're familiar with in
the UK, um, he, he's also gay and I,

227
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,030
and he's a brilliant thinker and it,

228
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,400
I didn't even want to ask him
anything about that because it's,

229
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,630
it's completely irrelevant
in a certain way.

230
00:15:37,631 --> 00:15:40,570
But the last question when I had
him on last time, I said to him,

231
00:15:40,571 --> 00:15:43,570
do you think your sexuality
has a little something

232
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,480
okay

233
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,310
to do with your sensitivity about freedom?
Because you know,

234
00:15:49,311 --> 00:15:51,050
it might be you first.

235
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:56,060
And he said that he thought his skin
was a little thinner because of that.

236
00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:00,020
And so I do think that people that
are on the outside for whatever,

237
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,150
whatever that is,
it doesn't have to be sexuality.

238
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:05,120
It can be obviously a myriad
of different issues. Um,

239
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,910
I do think you become a little
more sensitive, sensitive to it.

240
00:16:07,911 --> 00:16:12,200
And for that reason, I'm incredibly,
ah, I'll go a step further.

241
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:15,950
I am blessed that I live in the
United States of America and I can do,

242
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,560
I can live.
I'm a free man in the freest country ever.

243
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,630
And I'm very appreciative that

244
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,820
you can see why we get on I seriously.

245
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,043
Okay.

246
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,390
Can anyone push back against that?

247
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,790
And yet half the time when
you're listening to the,

248
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:34,150
the elites who have their hands
on the leavers of influence today,

249
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:37,260
you would think we lived in
cruel and depressive cultures.

250
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:41,430
Think of the four great revolutions,
the American war of independence,

251
00:16:41,431 --> 00:16:44,820
and what came out of that.
Think of the French Revolution.

252
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:49,830
Think of the Russian revolution,
I think of a mass revolution,

253
00:16:49,831 --> 00:16:53,880
which one that has produced a real
understanding of the individual

254
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,810
and secure their freedoms
in a greater way.

255
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:02,220
And we're in Australia of course,
are unbelievably blessed.

256
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,030
Do you use your word again because we've
inherited what's called a wash minster,

257
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:10,270
the best of the British house
of Congress. Uh, sorry, uh,

258
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,330
House of Representatives
based on the House of Commons.

259
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,370
Senators closely modeled on yours
and it works unbelievably well,

260
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:21,720
but you wouldn't think it listening
to the public commentary today.

261
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,010
Now let's come to freedom.

262
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,860
When you and I talked in Sydney
back just before Easter last year,

263
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:32,600
we had a great conversation then tomorrow,
enormous delight. I found that, uh,

264
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,730
we had a friend in common, Alexander
Salts or nights. There you go.

265
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:39,810
There's a fad or graph on him now.

266
00:17:39,811 --> 00:17:43,050
It doesn't look very happy when
there's a good reason for that.

267
00:17:43,051 --> 00:17:45,420
He would have been probably
busted up physically and,

268
00:17:45,421 --> 00:17:48,960
and all sorts of other ways as well.
When that photograph was taken,

269
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:54,180
he was a hero in Russia
in the Second World War.

270
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,440
But after the war,

271
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:59,850
he dared to disagree with
the regime in Moscow,

272
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:04,170
which was an unbelievably evil regime.
And for the price,

273
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,410
uh, the, uh, the price
for disagreeing was it,

274
00:18:07,411 --> 00:18:11,070
he ended up and the Gulag in a prison.

275
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:15,810
This is a remarkable book he
wrote about his experiences.

276
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,710
There were cetera. This was in the only
one I was smuggled out to the west.

277
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:24,870
There's no doubt that he's writing
shortens the life of that evil regime,

278
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:30,630
but the bit that stayed with me and which
you referred to and have many times,

279
00:18:30,631 --> 00:18:33,690
you wrote a great essay on it over
Christmas. I recommend it to you.

280
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,230
It was published in the times and then
in the Australian or you can Google it.

281
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:43,190
Was it this black recorded that one
day was lying and he sell I'd imagine

282
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,570
freezing cold,
probably ill.

283
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,000
Incredibly.

284
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,290
I'm happy and he circumstances.

285
00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:01,010
He hears the thumping of a guard down
the rows belting another prisoner up the

286
00:19:03,691 --> 00:19:07,110
screams of the prisoner and
then he writes all of that.

287
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,530
It dawned on me as I listened to it,

288
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:16,820
that the dividing line between good and
evil actually doesn't lie between captor

289
00:19:17,731 --> 00:19:21,090
and captive. Can you imagine a prisoner
in those circumstances are saying

290
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:27,560
the blog doing the beating is captive to,
he's not free.

291
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,720
Rather he said the dividing line between
good and evil lies somewhere across

292
00:19:32,721 --> 00:19:35,930
every human heart.
It's not between man and woman to let the,

293
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,850
some of the people in today's movements,

294
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:41,930
it's not between Catholic
and Baptist or man and woman.

295
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:48,250
The dividing line between good and evil
lies somewhere across every human heart.

296
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,040
That was very profound
for me in public life.

297
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:57,480
And I was telling these friends on the
way out, uh, that, um, for example, well,

298
00:19:57,481 --> 00:19:59,850
you know,
a point that came to me to be quite real,

299
00:19:59,851 --> 00:20:01,730
I was a young federal
member of parliament.

300
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,030
I was in the outback town
of Walgett and I've very,

301
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,150
very angry young aboriginal
man came up to me.

302
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:12,470
He swore his head off at me
or you said you signed size,

303
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:15,660
you stole this from us, you
ruined this, you, you know,

304
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:20,270
an absolute litany of, of my crimes
and now you're going to pay us back.

305
00:20:20,271 --> 00:20:22,790
And I remember thinking, stop, stop.

306
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:28,190
Remember that this guy has the stamp
of nobility on him too. It's just,

307
00:20:28,191 --> 00:20:33,020
I can't see it at the moment.
Okay. You know, and I've
got no right to do him over.

308
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:38,270
He's like me, he's a mixture of good
and bad. But let's tease this out.

309
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:43,460
This incredible writer who eventually
was freed, found his way to America,

310
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,760
the Americans and the West
refuse to listen to his warnings.

311
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,130
He was there like a kind of prophet

312
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,320
saying, look out, you're
losing your freedoms.

313
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:51,420
Okay,

314
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:55,680
what did he mean? How do you find
freedom when it's not physical,

315
00:20:55,681 --> 00:20:57,780
you can't move.
You're in fear of your life.

316
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,990
But in some other way he found freedom.
What's her name?

317
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,540
Can we unpack that because
I think it's important.

318
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:08,323
Well,

319
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:13,240
one of the things that soldier knits
and did, and this is something I think

320
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,690
we're thinking about,

321
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,380
I mean I thought about it for decades
because it's such a remarkable story.

322
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:25,200
I think he tells it in the second volume
of the Gulag archipelago cause it's a

323
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:29,580
three volume book, the f the full
book. Um, and it's all worth reading,

324
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,150
especially the second volume
and especially the second half.

325
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,860
And in that he details his transformation.

326
00:21:37,861 --> 00:21:41,850
I would say his psychological or
spiritual transformation. Now,

327
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,630
um,
he was on the Russian front,

328
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:50,640
which was not a pleasant place to be
because Stalin had signed a pact with

329
00:21:50,641 --> 00:21:55,110
Hitler and Hitler broke at and the
Russians were completely unprepared.

330
00:21:55,111 --> 00:21:59,760
And so to be on the Russian front at
the beginning of World War II was a very

331
00:21:59,761 --> 00:22:00,810
bad place to be.

332
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,400
And he wrote letters to a compatriot
who is complaining about the lack of

333
00:22:05,401 --> 00:22:08,790
preparation. And that's what
got him thrown in the camps.

334
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:14,060
Now it's interesting to note that Stalin
through all of the Soviet prisoners of

335
00:22:15,271 --> 00:22:16,470
war into camps,

336
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:20,280
so if you were a Soviet soldier and you
had gone to the west and fought and you

337
00:22:20,281 --> 00:22:22,110
were captured and put in a,

338
00:22:22,111 --> 00:22:26,460
say a German prisoner of war camp and
treated terribly because Stalin didn't

339
00:22:26,461 --> 00:22:30,810
sign the agreement,
it was from Switzerland,

340
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:34,050
Geneva, Geneva accords on the
treatment of prisoners of war.

341
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:37,920
And the Russians were treated so badly
that the allies used to feed them,

342
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:41,370
you know,
and it's not like they were not hungry.

343
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:45,240
And so you would end
up in a POW camp there.

344
00:22:45,241 --> 00:22:47,010
And then when you were done with that,

345
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,860
when you went home to Russia
for your hero's welcome,

346
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:54,330
you were thrown into the Gulag because
Stalin believed that the mere fact that

347
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:58,140
you'd been exposed to the West
now made you a class enemy.

348
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,390
So that was the sort of place to Soviet
Union was now soldier need to spend a

349
00:23:03,391 --> 00:23:04,650
lot of time in the gulag.

350
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:08,730
And he observed that there were
people there who he admired.

351
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,330
Now the camps were mostly
run by the prisoners.

352
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,910
So because most prisoners,

353
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,690
many prisoners became trustees and then
would move up the administrative ladder.

354
00:23:18,691 --> 00:23:21,150
And that's pretty interesting
and it really dark way, right?

355
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:24,840
Because it's like a hell that's run by
the devils and they can escape at any

356
00:23:24,841 --> 00:23:28,740
moment if they just realized that they
were the ones running it, but they didn't.

357
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:32,120
And so, um, and so that,

358
00:23:32,121 --> 00:23:35,010
that made the situation even more brutal
than it might have been because he

359
00:23:35,011 --> 00:23:39,630
noticed too that prisoners who became
guards were often more brutal than the

360
00:23:39,631 --> 00:23:44,040
civilian guards maybe to justify to
themselves what they had done. Who knows?

361
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:46,250
Anyways,
Solzhenitsyn at one point,

362
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:51,840
notice that there were people in the
camps who's comportment he truly admired,

363
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,140
who seemed incorruptible,

364
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:58,700
who wouldn't deceive or lie
or take the easy way out,

365
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,300
regardless of what it was that
they were being threatened with.

366
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:06,290
And they wouldn't sign the confessions
that everybody had designed,

367
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,410
guilty or not guilty.
They refuse to play along.

368
00:24:09,411 --> 00:24:13,640
And some of them certainly died for that,
but many people died in the gulags.

369
00:24:13,641 --> 00:24:18,470
So that was hardly an anomaly.
But he said that many of them,

370
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,510
many of the people who ran the camps
were terrified by these people.

371
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,750
And that also that many of
them were religious believers,

372
00:24:26,751 --> 00:24:27,830
which was quite interesting.

373
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:31,910
And so what he learned was that
even under terrible circumstances,

374
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,470
there were ways of being
more or less noble.

375
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,600
And I suppose it would be under terrible
circumstances where that sort of thing

376
00:24:41,601 --> 00:24:42,710
would be put to the test.

377
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,200
And it really made him think about
his own rule in his own demise.

378
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:53,750
You know, like he had Hitler
to blame, right? Because, well,

379
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,990
there was the second world war and
he had stolen to blame. And I mean,

380
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,070
if you need people to
blame for your misery,

381
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,070
those are credible people to blame.
You know,

382
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:07,040
especially both of them at the same time.

383
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:10,040
And yet he started to consider,
you know,

384
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:15,250
what did I do in my own life that
increased the probability that I ended up

385
00:25:15,441 --> 00:25:17,990
here. You know, as a citizen for example,

386
00:25:17,991 --> 00:25:21,440
who was responsible for the way that
the country operated because you know,

387
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,580
like in East Germany,

388
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,760
one third of the people in East Germany
were informers and everybody in the

389
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:32,240
Soviet system lied about everything
to everyone all the time,

390
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,660
which is of course what you would do if
one in three people were informers cause

391
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:37,640
that would be like two
people in your family.

392
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,380
And so the whole system was set up
and maintain because everyone lie.

393
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:47,780
You think, well if I stopped
lying, I'm done for, it's
like, yeah, fair enough man.

394
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:52,781
But if you keep lying and so does everyone
else you're also done for and so is

395
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:58,100
everyone else. So that doesn't seem
to be much of an option and social.

396
00:25:58,101 --> 00:26:01,640
And it's noted that there were people
even under these extreme circumstances

397
00:26:01,641 --> 00:26:02,600
that would tell the truth.

398
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:07,010
And he decided that he would go over
his life with a fine tooth comb.

399
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,590
He had nothing but time to think about.

400
00:26:09,591 --> 00:26:14,591
Every time he had acted in some manner
in his life that transgressed against his

401
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:18,950
own conscience, right? That where he
did something, he knew it'd be wrong,

402
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,810
and then to see if he could figure
out how to set it right then. Now,

403
00:26:23,811 --> 00:26:27,380
obviously he couldn't necessarily
apologize to the people against too.

404
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,850
He had transgressed,
right?

405
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:33,590
Sometimes you have to pay for something
you did in a currency other than that

406
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:34,490
which you took.

407
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:40,270
And his determination was to chronicle
his experiences in his truthful a manner

408
00:26:41,781 --> 00:26:44,000
as possible,
which was basically impossible.

409
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,520
It wasn't like he had
paper and Pencil and, and,

410
00:26:47,521 --> 00:26:51,990
and time to write and privacy. Had his
notebooks ever been discovered? Well,

411
00:26:51,991 --> 00:26:55,200
he would've been in serious trouble and
they would have been destroyed. In fact,

412
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:59,040
when he got out,
he had two copies of the full manuscript,

413
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,870
each out to a different typist.
Secretly the KGB got ahold of one,

414
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,350
destroyed it, and the type is
committed suicide, you know,

415
00:27:07,351 --> 00:27:09,740
so he basically memorize the,

416
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:14,490
the book and it's 2,400 pages
long of eight point tight.

417
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:19,290
Like it's, it's, uh, it's
one remarkable, um, work.

418
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:24,470
It's one long scream of truthful outrage,

419
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:29,520
you know, and that came out of
his decision to set himself right.

420
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,680
And then it was,
as John said,

421
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:34,710
it was smuggled into the West
where it had a walloping impact.

422
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,100
It completely demolished
at least for a long while,

423
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,540
the moral credibility of
communism completely from,

424
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:46,200
from like 1972 on, if you knew about
the existence of the Gulag archipelago,

425
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,590
you didn't get to say
anything good about communism.

426
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,880
And that lasted for a long time and
even convinced French intellectuals that

427
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:55,500
there was something wrong with communism.

428
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,740
And there's no doubt that it was one of
the historical events that caused the

429
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,830
Soviet Union to collapse. And that
was a good thing. And you know,

430
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:06,840
when it collapsed relatively peacefully,

431
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,750
all things considered
no thermonuclear war.

432
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,690
Yugoslavia was no picnic and you know,

433
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:17,691
but for the demise of one of the
most evil empires that ever existed,

434
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:21,810
it was pretty damned smooth. And certainly
the world's been in way better shape,

435
00:28:21,811 --> 00:28:23,010
especially Africa,

436
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:27,570
since the Soviet Union has disappeared
because the African economies are booming

437
00:28:27,571 --> 00:28:28,320
like mad now.

438
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:33,030
And it's partly because they aren't doing
things that are insanely foolish under

439
00:28:33,031 --> 00:28:36,180
the guide guidance of, you
know, call me in this direction.

440
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:41,540
And so Solzhenitsyn decided under these
conditions of absolute powerlessness,

441
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,630
privation,
right,

442
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:46,920
to put himself together and
to say what he had to say.

443
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,190
And that was enough to knock over.
The Soviet Union wasn't,

444
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,640
it wasn't all that knocked it over,
but it wasn't nothing.

445
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:56,490
It's sold 35 million copies.
You know,

446
00:28:56,491 --> 00:29:00,660
it's arguably the most
influential nonfiction book
of the 20th century and it's

447
00:29:00,661 --> 00:29:03,000
unbelievably powerful. You think, well,

448
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:06,780
what power do you have if you're
willing to tell the truth,

449
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,650
it's not easy to tell the
truth. It's, it's complicated.

450
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,040
You have to take yourself into
account right over the long run.

451
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,930
You have to take your family into account.

452
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,410
You have to take your society into
account. You have to think it through.

453
00:29:19,411 --> 00:29:22,590
You have to think strategically,
and then you have to find your words.

454
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:26,040
And that's hard to find your words because
you tend to use other people's words

455
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:29,250
or India.
Logical words are words that mask or hide.

456
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,260
It's not easy to find your own words,

457
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,860
but if you find your own words
and there are truthful words,

458
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:39,660
there isn't anything that can stop them
and you think, well do you believe that?

459
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:44,050
Well, let's go back to the idea,
are you sovereign citizens or not?

460
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,150
Well, if you are, well, why is that on
this? Because you have a certain faculty,

461
00:29:49,151 --> 00:29:52,000
a certain power. Well, what do you have?

462
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,180
You have the power of your convictions
and your truth and your ability to

463
00:29:55,181 --> 00:29:58,720
communicate and that's what's supposed
to set the state straight. Okay,

464
00:29:58,721 --> 00:30:00,280
so you have that.
It's like,

465
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:04,360
well then maybe it's truth that you're
pursuing and seeking if you have any

466
00:30:04,361 --> 00:30:06,970
sense and what true.
Well,

467
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,750
truth is the best reflection
you can manage of reality.

468
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,130
Imperfect because you're imperfect, but
it's the best you've got. It's like what?

469
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:20,050
What's going to be better for you than
to have reality on your site and what's

470
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:23,860
going to stand in your way if you
have reality on your site live.

471
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:27,250
I don't think so.
That isn't how it works.

472
00:30:27,251 --> 00:30:30,910
And I don't think anyone believes that
because the other thing I've noted and

473
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:34,810
discussed with people frequently is if
you have someone that you love, a child,

474
00:30:34,811 --> 00:30:38,530
let's say, and you're trying to
raise a child in a decent manner,

475
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,880
you don't tell them, look kid,
this is how the world runs.

476
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:46,390
Everything is corrupt beyond belief,
including you and your parents and,

477
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,910
and society and nature for that matter.

478
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,460
It's just complete bloody hell everywhere.

479
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:56,580
And the only possible way that you can
make it through life effectively is to

480
00:30:57,191 --> 00:31:01,000
learn to lie as brilliantly and uh,

481
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:05,410
undisguised humbly as possible.
No one does that.

482
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:10,020
Well, why not? If you believed in fall.

483
00:31:10,021 --> 00:31:12,040
So if you believe that
that was the way forward,

484
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:15,630
then that would be the right
thing to teach. But you don't,

485
00:31:15,631 --> 00:31:18,730
you teach your children to tell the truth,
even if it's painful.

486
00:31:18,731 --> 00:31:21,940
And the reason for that is
that you actually believe
in the power of the truth.

487
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,430
No. Finish that with one thing. There's,

488
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:28,810
there's a very interesting scene in
revelations is a very strange document

489
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,310
appended to the end of the primary
book in the Western Canon, right?

490
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:38,500
And it's a hallucinogenic
nightmare revelation. And in it,

491
00:31:38,501 --> 00:31:42,820
Christ comes back to earth and he's
not the merciful savior of the Gospels.

492
00:31:42,821 --> 00:31:46,810
He's the judge. And there's a reason
for that, a psychological reason.

493
00:31:46,811 --> 00:31:47,561
And the reason is,

494
00:31:47,561 --> 00:31:52,060
is that if you have an ideal
and whatever Christ is,

495
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:55,360
metaphysically, you're
psychologically, he's an ideal.

496
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:01,540
If you have an ideal, an ideal is a
judge because the ideal judges you,

497
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,700
right? Okay, so he comes back as a judge.

498
00:32:03,701 --> 00:32:07,810
He has a sword in his mouth and he
judges that saved and the, and the down.

499
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:12,490
And it's not pretty, but here's something
interesting. It's so fascinating.

500
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:18,390
He saves his worst contempt
and uses contemptuous language.

501
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,650
Says,
I will spit you out of my mouth.

502
00:32:20,651 --> 00:32:25,120
It really means I will vomit you out of
my mouth. Not if you were a bad person,

503
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,510
no one. If you were a good person,
not if you were a bad person,

504
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:33,460
but if you sat on the bloody fence,
right? If you are neither warm nor cold,

505
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,170
you wanted to play it both ways.

506
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:39,500
Well all lie when it's in my favor and
we'll tell the truth when it's expedient

507
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:42,770
for me, it's like you're, you're
in the category of the dam.

508
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:46,700
And I think that's absolutely right,
cause that's real cowardice.

509
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:50,630
If you believed in false hood, it's
like good. Get on with it, man.

510
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,350
You can be a criminal and lay your
life out and see how that works.

511
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:55,790
And if you believe in truth,

512
00:32:55,791 --> 00:32:58,970
well then perhaps you put yourself
on the line for the truth,

513
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:03,470
but you don't play the, the two sides
against the middle because there's,

514
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,400
there's nothing in that,
that isn't

515
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,930
self serving out the cost of your own
wellbeing and up the cost of everyone

516
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,120
else's.
So you have to think about,

517
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,450
you have to think about your
relationship with the truth. You know,

518
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,940
there isn't anything more important
than you can do than that.

519
00:33:20,941 --> 00:33:24,050
And because you're, you're, um, you're,

520
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:29,840
I've seen people in major corporations
that were corrupt and failing,

521
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:37,280
spend three years doing
nothing but telling the truth
often at their own peril,

522
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:40,950
fix the companies.

523
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:44,280
And it's such a relief to the
people that they were talking to.

524
00:33:44,281 --> 00:33:49,281
Cause they'd go talk to them and the
company is run by people who are not doing

525
00:33:49,351 --> 00:33:52,470
what they should be doing and
they're questioning. It's like, okay,

526
00:33:52,471 --> 00:33:55,530
well what's really going on here?
Well,

527
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,810
no one wants to talk
because they're afraid,

528
00:33:57,811 --> 00:34:00,810
but the person who's doing the
questioning actually wants to know.

529
00:34:00,811 --> 00:34:04,170
When people start opening up and he
gathers information, it's like, oh, I see.

530
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:07,650
Here's the real problems here. It's like
we've got all sorts of problems here.

531
00:34:07,651 --> 00:34:09,030
This is why the company's in trouble,

532
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:14,120
but it's okay if we know the problems
well then we can fix them and we'll go

533
00:34:14,971 --> 00:34:18,300
ahead and fix them and then the company
will work and everybody who's terrified

534
00:34:18,301 --> 00:34:19,081
and won't say anything,

535
00:34:19,081 --> 00:34:22,500
it isn't really working hard
anymore because there's so
dispirited and believing

536
00:34:22,501 --> 00:34:25,560
that the projects are corrupt and that
the leadership isn't doing what it's

537
00:34:25,561 --> 00:34:28,290
supposed to, they start having a
bit of hope. It's like, really?

538
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:32,190
You mean you're actually willing to
admit that that is the problem and you're

539
00:34:32,191 --> 00:34:36,360
going to give me a problem that is a real
problem that I could actually work on

540
00:34:36,361 --> 00:34:38,700
and actually solve and benefit from that.

541
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:42,930
And the whole company switches around and,
and that works.

542
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,720
It's not naive to believe that.

543
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:50,010
And I'll say one more thing about
trust that's very much worth knowing.

544
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,800
So this is what you learned.
If you're a clinician,

545
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:57,260
most people who trust our naive

546
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:02,450
and naive is not a virtue.
It's a fault.

547
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,170
It's partly a fault because if you're
naive and you run into someone who's

548
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:11,120
malevolent, including you, they
might do you in calculable damage.

549
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:14,540
So then you will never recover.
So that's not a good thing.

550
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:17,390
You don't want to be naive.
If you're not naive,

551
00:35:17,391 --> 00:35:20,990
that means you've been burned
once or twice or three or
four times. And you know,

552
00:35:20,991 --> 00:35:23,120
once you've been burned in that manner,

553
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,190
well then it's hard to
trust because you think,

554
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:28,100
well why would I trust
you or me for that matter,

555
00:35:28,101 --> 00:35:30,320
knowing full well that I can be betrayed.

556
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,880
And so then you're cynical and you think
that's an improvement over being naive.

557
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:39,030
You know it's, you're more mature,
cynical than you are naive.

558
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:42,750
Even if it's premature and
it's often premature and
young people, it's like, okay,

559
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:46,500
so how do you get out of that conundrum?
While this is a crucial thing to know,

560
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,760
you trust people because
you're courageous.

561
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,630
That's why it's the same
reason that you're grateful.

562
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,230
It's a mark of courage.
It's a mark of commitment.

563
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,710
It's like you and I were going to make
an agreement and you're full of snakes

564
00:36:01,711 --> 00:36:04,680
and so am I, and there's lots
of ways this can go sideways,

565
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,070
but we're going to put
together an agreement. We're
going to articulate it out.

566
00:36:08,071 --> 00:36:11,610
We're going to try to find something
that is of mutual benefit to both of us.

567
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,760
We're going to put our hands out and
shake and we're going to try to stick to

568
00:36:14,761 --> 00:36:19,650
that and we're going to risk trusting
each other, right? It's a risk.

569
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:24,360
And that's the risk of on which the state
is based. Really. Like I, I believe,

570
00:36:24,361 --> 00:36:26,700
and I think the evidence for
this is very strong, by the way.

571
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:31,850
I don't think that there is any other
natural resource than trust and for trust.

572
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:35,100
You need courage,
not naivety.

573
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:39,300
And you go to overcome your cynicism so
that you trust and then you ask yourself

574
00:36:39,301 --> 00:36:41,370
too, if you don't trust your
institutions, it's like,

575
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,143
Hey,

576
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:48,730
they're your institutions. Why don't
you go out and do something about them?

577
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,030
You think, well, I can't. It's
like that's not true. That is,

578
00:36:52,031 --> 00:36:54,590
that is absolutely not true.
That there's,

579
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:59,260
there's nothing vaguely accurate
about that. In a society like this,

580
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:04,290
almost all of our democratic
institutions are crying out for people to

581
00:37:04,421 --> 00:37:07,720
participate.
They can't find enough people to do it.

582
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:13,080
And if you participate and you and you
do it diligently and you have your say

583
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:17,860
and you're careful and trustworthy and
you and you and you and you and you speak

584
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:20,860
your mind, you can have way
more effect than you think.

585
00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:24,670
So if you're a cynical
about the institutions,

586
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:28,150
it's like look in the mirror
because those institutions,

587
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:33,130
the corruption of those institutions is
a direct reflection of your inability to

588
00:37:33,131 --> 00:37:34,150
get your act together.

589
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:39,010
And that's what it means to be a
sovereign part of the western community.

590
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,070
So it's not someone else.
So

591
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:47,460
this issue of trust. Now I would have
thought that after what he'd been through,

592
00:37:47,461 --> 00:37:48,660
and you've outlined it.

593
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,173
Yup.

594
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,800
Not alone by any means,

595
00:37:52,801 --> 00:37:57,801
but some of these people who have warned
us of the need to be responsible and

596
00:37:59,571 --> 00:38:04,020
uh, he'd history salsa. Nixon is a
classic example. What has happened.

597
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:09,040
Do you made the point that for a very
long time we understood how dangerous that

598
00:38:11,071 --> 00:38:14,250
sort of drift towards totalitarianism is.

599
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:19,700
It seems to washed out of the system
now it seems as though we don't teach

600
00:38:19,711 --> 00:38:21,120
history,
we don't respect it.

601
00:38:21,121 --> 00:38:24,390
We don't understand that it
can teach us valuable lessons.

602
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:27,780
And what worries me about
that is they all saying,

603
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:31,160
if you don't understand history,
you may very well repeat it.

604
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:36,100
Why do we walk away from

605
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,180
people we can trust warning
us of the consequences?

606
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:44,310
What if it was an interesting reason
for that that sort of brings this salt

607
00:38:44,311 --> 00:38:49,311
units in story into 2019 which
is that he was truly oppressed.

608
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:55,350
This was a life of actual oppression
right now that we have people that are

609
00:38:55,931 --> 00:38:59,230
walking around, everyone in this
room has this in their pocket.

610
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,250
And if you have this in your pocket,
I hope, yeah, hopefully it turned off.

611
00:39:03,251 --> 00:39:06,790
But if you have this thing in your pocket
and you think you're oppressed, you're,

612
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:08,730
you're very confused.
We,

613
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:13,090
we live in a time with such absurd
freedoms in the west that are so,

614
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,230
uh,

615
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:19,230
beyond imagination of what people could
only dream of two generations ago,

616
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:23,030
even one generation ago. Especially
with this, that people now are,

617
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:25,660
have a perceived depression
instead of a real depression.

618
00:39:25,661 --> 00:39:27,710
So one of the things that
I find when I go to a,

619
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:32,140
when I go to college campuses
is that these kids will
protest and they'll scream.

620
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:32,621
And that,
you know,

621
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:37,210
that everyone's all right and everyone's
a neo Nazi and the rest of this. And I,

622
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:38,830
I always find, all right, well how do you,

623
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,890
how do you break through to somebody
like that? How do you actually,

624
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,450
when they have, you know,
you've talked about this,

625
00:39:43,451 --> 00:39:47,620
when they have that look in
their eye, truly a possessed
look and there, you know,

626
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:52,600
it's this, this postmodern monster
has become sort of a secular religion.

627
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,780
Uh, and I think that's also one of the
reasons why we're Jordan's doing is

628
00:39:55,781 --> 00:39:57,460
resonating because they've,

629
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:01,060
they've removed religion from the equation
and now they have no meaning and they

630
00:40:01,061 --> 00:40:05,280
put it all into this really
competing set of ideas. Uh,

631
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,920
we're what we call the,

632
00:40:06,921 --> 00:40:10,420
the oppression Olympics where they're
constantly competing for oppression

633
00:40:10,421 --> 00:40:14,020
because they believe that victimhood is
virtue in victim hood of course is not

634
00:40:14,021 --> 00:40:14,370
virtual,

635
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,320
it's virtual is getting your life in
order and going out and doing something.

636
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:21,190
So I'm always looking for a little trick
to get through to these kids and it's

637
00:40:21,191 --> 00:40:24,550
really hard because when they have that
sort of glossed over Zombie, look, it's,

638
00:40:24,551 --> 00:40:25,384
it's tough.

639
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:30,000
And I found one trick that actually kind
of works if you can get it to them in,

640
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,230
in the most simple,
personal way.

641
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,930
And this particularly works in the
United States and I have no doubt that it

642
00:40:34,931 --> 00:40:39,100
would work here in Australia as well.
I'll say to them, anyone in this room,

643
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:43,090
does anyone in this room have it
worse than their grandparents?

644
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,580
Now I've done this, I don't
know, a hundred times.

645
00:40:45,581 --> 00:40:49,030
Probably nobody has ever
raised their hand. Nobody ever.

646
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,430
If you live in the United States,
you basically short on the,

647
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:55,930
I mean the only outsider case would be
if your grandparents were oil barons or

648
00:40:55,931 --> 00:40:58,630
something like that, and then they
lost all the money, in which case,

649
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:01,600
in which case the leftist would actually
love that too because it would show

650
00:41:01,601 --> 00:41:02,201
that,
well,

651
00:41:02,201 --> 00:41:05,280
it would show that that accumulated
wealth doesn't stay beyond generations.

652
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,130
So they're all about that. Right. So,
but if you can do something like that,

653
00:41:09,131 --> 00:41:10,870
I mean if you say,
I mean everyone in this room can do it.

654
00:41:10,871 --> 00:41:14,110
Like can everyone picture
of their grandparents? Do
you have a better or worse?

655
00:41:14,111 --> 00:41:16,510
I mean, does anyone in here have
it worse than their grandparents?

656
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:21,700
And that shows you that it's a perceived
depression, not a real oppression,

657
00:41:21,701 --> 00:41:26,080
that, that the thing that they're
fighting this patriarchal,

658
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:31,081
postmodern capitalistic thing that they
are fighting and they can't define it.

659
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:33,380
So it's hard to define it for them,
uh,

660
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:37,580
that it actually has bent
toward justice always,

661
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:42,020
always. And one when you get what
you can plant that seed in them,

662
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:43,640
I think it's a little bit of something,

663
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:45,440
but it's very hard to
break them out of that.

664
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,560
But I think the key here is understanding
that it's a perceived depression.

665
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,640
If you live in a free
society in the West in 2019,

666
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,100
you're not oppressed. You, you may be,

667
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:57,920
you maybe don't have as
well as your neighbor does.

668
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:00,350
And maybe you came from more
and they came from less.

669
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:04,580
Or maybe you're sick and they're
not, or a series of other things. Um,

670
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,060
but you've got a chance and that's
all you're supposed to have in life.

671
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:11,060
And I think getting that through
to them as opposed to, oh,

672
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:14,570
the system is horrible and I have to
now destroy the system as if they could

673
00:42:14,571 --> 00:42:19,370
magically reconstitute a system that
really would just be an effect throwing

674
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:23,260
away thousands of years of human
history that there are so wise there.

675
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:27,320
So why is it 24 years old? Is there
shouting down speakers that they could,

676
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:31,490
they could build up what nobody before
them could and that that's the danger

677
00:42:31,491 --> 00:42:32,730
there.
So I think getting them to,

678
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:35,180
to think about their own
lives where they come from,

679
00:42:35,181 --> 00:42:38,150
I think is a pretty effective way of,
of getting through to people.

680
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,230
Well, we can also say like, look,

681
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:46,090
there's a claim that the west
isn't oppressive patriarchy.

682
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:50,980
And so that's actually true.
The,

683
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:56,130
the problem with the claim is that it's
not just an oppressive patriarchy and

684
00:42:57,310 --> 00:43:00,970
there's a big difference between
something being completely something and

685
00:43:00,971 --> 00:43:02,530
something being partly something.

686
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,800
Because one of the things you might
point out is that you can look at human

687
00:43:07,841 --> 00:43:12,640
history anywhere and what you see is
a complete bloody nightmare, right?

688
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:13,690
It's,
it's,

689
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:18,690
it's death and struggle and privation
and war and horror everywhere with some

690
00:43:21,731 --> 00:43:23,140
progress,
you know,

691
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:27,040
some ability of us to pull
ourselves out of the mire,

692
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:28,240
you know,

693
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:33,240
and the West is the same is there's plenty
of catastrophe in our past and of all

694
00:43:34,091 --> 00:43:37,420
sorts. And, and I think it's,
it's necessary to know that,

695
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:42,340
but then it's necessary to separate
the wheat from the chaff. You know,

696
00:43:42,341 --> 00:43:45,830
one of the things I see
with readers who are, um,

697
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,430
unsophisticated and intellectually
arrogant is they'll read someone great.

698
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:53,470
Maybe they'll read niches for example,

699
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:58,740
and they'll find the odd thing that
needs just said that grates against their

700
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:01,120
current moral sensibilities.

701
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:04,450
Whether they do that in context or out,

702
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,400
and then they'll throw
away the whole book.

703
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,670
It's like you don't throw away
the whole book. It was nature.

704
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:15,640
You don't throw away the book.
He's like one in a billion.

705
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:19,090
You read it carefully and
you think, well, okay,

706
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:23,200
no to that.
But yes to this.

707
00:44:23,201 --> 00:44:26,230
And you do the same thing with
Dostoyevsky and you do the same thing with

708
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,073
Tolstoy.

709
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:31,680
You do the same thing with the great
writers of the past that had been down to

710
00:44:31,681 --> 00:44:36,080
us. You, you read intelligently, you
separate the wheat from the chaff, right?

711
00:44:36,081 --> 00:44:39,450
And you gain wisdom that
way. Well, you do the same.

712
00:44:39,451 --> 00:44:41,520
When you look at your own history,
it's like,

713
00:44:41,521 --> 00:44:45,630
well of course it's a bloody nightmare.
What do you expect? It's like,

714
00:44:45,631 --> 00:44:48,560
what's your point?
We're going to,

715
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:52,080
we're going to burn it down and then
we're going to have something better as a

716
00:44:52,081 --> 00:44:55,500
consequence. Well, not so
easily, not so quickly.

717
00:44:55,710 --> 00:44:58,890
Maybe we read our history
carefully and we think, okay,

718
00:44:58,891 --> 00:45:02,070
well what did we get right? Well,
what did we get right? Well,

719
00:45:02,071 --> 00:45:04,260
the sovereignty of the individual,
that's pretty good.

720
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:08,040
The fact that you have right to property,
that's pretty good.

721
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:10,650
You can argue about the limits on that,
but you know,

722
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:14,490
you don't want someone just taking
your purse. You know, it's, it's,

723
00:45:14,491 --> 00:45:18,120
it's helpful that there are things
that you can earn and own, you know,

724
00:45:18,121 --> 00:45:21,300
the dignity of the individual.
That's another one. Um,

725
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:24,630
the innocence before the law. God, that's,

726
00:45:24,631 --> 00:45:27,240
that's a miracle that we
ever came up with that idea.

727
00:45:27,241 --> 00:45:31,550
I can't believe that that idea exists
because in most cultures it's like what?

728
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:36,120
You might be guilty, okay, your
dad cause well that's easier.

729
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:39,060
You might be guilty, you know,
why go through all the trouble?

730
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,340
There's plenty of people
where you came from.

731
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,700
It's like the trouble of presuming
your innocence, it's even innocent.

732
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:48,710
It's even hard for you to do that for
yourself. And, and, and the idea that,

733
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,720
that each person has an intrinsic worth
regardless of their well externalities.

734
00:45:54,931 --> 00:45:58,170
Let's say. That's another idea.
That's a complete miracle. It's like,

735
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,550
what were you going,
what are we going to do?

736
00:45:59,551 --> 00:46:02,670
We're going to throw all that away
with the statement that we live in an

737
00:46:02,671 --> 00:46:06,800
oppressive patriarchy and then we're
going to be left with nothing and, and,

738
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,790
and what, what good is that? Well,

739
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:12,030
how about we look at our history and we
take responsibility for it. We think,

740
00:46:12,031 --> 00:46:16,500
okay, well here's some things that need to
be fixed. There's plenty of them, right?

741
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:19,740
There's plenty of them for each of
us to fix and we'll go fix them.

742
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:23,700
And maybe then we can atone for
the bloodiness of our history.

743
00:46:23,701 --> 00:46:26,850
And for our so called unearned privilege,
you know,

744
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:31,230
some of which all of us have.
And that wouldn't be good.

745
00:46:31,231 --> 00:46:33,990
That would be part of the adventure
of your life too. And that's,

746
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:39,020
that's a far more sensible and wise
approach to the diagnosis of what's wrong

747
00:46:40,111 --> 00:46:42,000
with the West then?
Well,

748
00:46:42,001 --> 00:46:45,290
it's an oppressive patriarchy and it
should be overthrown or whatever that,

749
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,930
you know, current, uh,

750
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:51,270
low resolution and resentful
in the ology happens to be.

751
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,140
And, and there's something to be
said for a bit of humility as well.

752
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:57,840
It's like really,

753
00:46:57,841 --> 00:47:01,080
you really think that you're
capable of making large scale social

754
00:47:01,081 --> 00:47:03,630
transformations and getting it right.
Do you,

755
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:09,300
you really think that you're 25, you're
30, you're 40, I don't care. You know,

756
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:12,960
what makes you think you're smart
enough to pull off something like that?

757
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:16,170
It's very, very difficult. Very, very,

758
00:47:16,171 --> 00:47:21,171
very difficult to take a system that
works not too badly and to do anything to

759
00:47:22,621 --> 00:47:24,420
it that doesn't make it worse,

760
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,010
much less to radically reconstitute it
and make it better. That's really hard.

761
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:32,290
So you know,
if you're upset about your culture,

762
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:36,190
well maybe you could think of some small
ways that are local that you could go

763
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,090
out and improve it.

764
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:41,290
I think you should start
with yourself is because Bob,

765
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:44,980
then you're only harming yourself and
you're not a bad person to practice on.

766
00:47:44,981 --> 00:47:47,020
And then you could extend
that to your fat. Well,

767
00:47:47,021 --> 00:47:52,021
at least you suffer for the consequences
of your own experiments that way rather

768
00:47:52,301 --> 00:47:53,530
than having someone else do it.

769
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:57,160
And then maybe you can work on bringing
a little more harmony into your family

770
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,860
and maybe you can get a job and
see if you're any good at that.

771
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:04,300
And then if you manage those
three things halfways respectably,

772
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:09,390
well then you could dare to put a toe
hold out into the broader community and

773
00:48:10,841 --> 00:48:11,674
think,

774
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:17,200
maybe I have an idea here that we could
tentatively attempt that might make some

775
00:48:17,201 --> 00:48:21,130
small things slightly better that we
could measure carefully and assess.

776
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:24,640
And that would be your contribution.
And maybe you get real good at that,

777
00:48:24,641 --> 00:48:28,370
you know? So by the time you're 50 or
60 and you have a solid life behind you,

778
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:33,520
you're actually capable of generating
large scale improvements carefully.

779
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:36,490
Um, you know, as you were saying
that, I was thinking, I mean,

780
00:48:36,491 --> 00:48:41,020
this is exactly what Alexandria
ocozzio Cortez is. I mean,

781
00:48:41,021 --> 00:48:44,980
this is a failed, this is a bartender
with a four 30 credit score,

782
00:48:44,981 --> 00:48:47,140
which is pretty terrible. Uh, but you,

783
00:48:47,141 --> 00:48:49,390
all she's ever done in her life has
been a bartender. Now that's fine.

784
00:48:49,391 --> 00:48:51,040
I've been a bartender at times,
but the,

785
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:53,530
her only accomplishment is
becoming a congress woman with,

786
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:57,850
I think around 15,000 votes by saying
the exact thing that the god that the

787
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,440
media wants you to say all the time.
Right.

788
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:04,770
The idea that she could write this a
green new deal and that somehow she is the

789
00:49:05,531 --> 00:49:08,470
one that can, now of course,
she didn't really write it.
You're, you know, we're not,

790
00:49:08,471 --> 00:49:09,490
we don't know who really wrote it,

791
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:14,020
but the idea that she could present
this as if she has the ideas that could

792
00:49:14,021 --> 00:49:18,460
rejigger the entire United States
economy and how we deal with energy and

793
00:49:18,461 --> 00:49:20,470
transportation and everything,

794
00:49:20,471 --> 00:49:24,010
and we're not going to have planes and
we're going to pay people unwilling to

795
00:49:24,011 --> 00:49:27,810
work. Although then she deleted that part
and put that, you know, it's like, it's,

796
00:49:27,811 --> 00:49:30,490
it's the lack of humility there.

797
00:49:30,491 --> 00:49:34,150
That's actually staggering that she
thinks no one before her might've tried to

798
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:37,240
move some of these things on the
margins a little bit, but she,

799
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:41,610
but crazy or that moving things
on the margins isn't enough. Well,

800
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:42,570
they don't believe it's enough,

801
00:49:42,571 --> 00:49:44,970
but the really crazy part
of this is that pretty much,

802
00:49:44,971 --> 00:49:47,940
I think the five or six Democratic
candidates that we have now have all

803
00:49:47,941 --> 00:49:50,730
basically signed on board this
thing, this thing, which is a,

804
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,460
I think you could probably argue
that it's unconstitutional on,

805
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:55,920
on the grounds of,
it's just taking more for the government,

806
00:49:55,921 --> 00:49:59,110
but because everything we know from
history about how economics, yeah,

807
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:02,310
well she's admitted. You can't,
they know all of Israel. She says,

808
00:50:02,311 --> 00:50:04,650
we'll tax the billionaires.
And then she also tells you,

809
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:07,980
tells you that the billionaires are the
blight on society. So it's like, well,

810
00:50:07,981 --> 00:50:11,220
which one is it because you need the
billionaires to pay for it even though it

811
00:50:11,221 --> 00:50:12,060
won't pay for it.

812
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,160
And if you don't want billionaires
when now we can't pay for it.

813
00:50:14,161 --> 00:50:14,994
So what are we doing?

814
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:20,280
Gimme gimme one you're going to write
it is Australia's longest serving prime

815
00:50:20,281 --> 00:50:25,200
minister is a man called Bob Menzies
and he was a man of incredibly powerful

816
00:50:25,201 --> 00:50:28,130
intellect and very,
very deep learning. Uh,

817
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:33,130
and he wrote fascinating me
that democracy is not a machine.

818
00:50:33,411 --> 00:50:38,411
It's a spirit in which the peculiar
Christian conception that no matter what

819
00:50:42,531 --> 00:50:44,660
your station in life is,

820
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,570
each of us has a spark of the divine
and every soul is of equal value before

821
00:50:51,571 --> 00:50:53,550
heaven.
Why do I mention that?

822
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:56,100
Partly because I think it's a
very relevant point personally,

823
00:50:56,101 --> 00:51:01,101
but it's because in the mocking and the
ridiculing have that respect for our

824
00:51:03,091 --> 00:51:06,750
faith out of the door. We've knocked
that one of the pillars of democracy,

825
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:11,040
we've knocked out the idea that whether
I agree with you or not, doesn't matter.

826
00:51:11,041 --> 00:51:14,880
I have to respect you because
they're a higher authority,

827
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,820
places as much value on
you as he does on me.

828
00:51:18,690 --> 00:51:21,450
Now it seems that the problem is that if,

829
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:22,320
okay,

830
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,000
you did disagree with me,

831
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,110
okay,

832
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:29,670
I don't have a reference frame for good
and bad anymore or for respecting you,

833
00:51:29,671 --> 00:51:31,890
therefore I have to insist on,
right,

834
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:36,420
so you're on God over my life and you
data challenge me because you want to be

835
00:51:36,421 --> 00:51:40,170
got over yours. Well, that's a,
you're an evil person though.

836
00:51:40,171 --> 00:51:42,870
You're a racist story
or something terrible.

837
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:48,230
We lack of framework for respecting one
another and it seems a massive problem

838
00:51:49,081 --> 00:51:51,410
for us. It's the problem with
the collectivist viewpoint

839
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,180
because if,

840
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:57,890
if you're defining characteristic is
that you're a member of a collective,

841
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:02,030
then you live or die by the
propriety of the collective. The,

842
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:05,780
the antidote to that is that
strange metaphysical claim,

843
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:08,540
which is that well,

844
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:11,810
which is fundamentally that we each
have a spark of the divine in us.

845
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:15,320
And you think, well, it's
easy to be cynical about that,

846
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:21,290
but you shouldn't be because
you act like it's true.

847
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:24,080
And that's worth noticing.

848
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:29,480
It's like if you have friends or family
members and you don't treat them like

849
00:52:29,481 --> 00:52:32,600
they have profound intrinsic value,

850
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:36,950
then they're not happy
with you. Right? You can't,

851
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,860
you can't have a loving
relationship without that.

852
00:52:39,861 --> 00:52:42,500
You can't have a relationship
of reciprocity without that.

853
00:52:42,501 --> 00:52:45,800
You can't have a relationship of
respect without that, none of it.

854
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:50,990
And they also want you to treat them like
they're in some sense masters of their

855
00:52:50,991 --> 00:52:53,150
own destiny, which is
also interesting, right?

856
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:58,150
Because if you have a say a 21 year
old child and they're upset with you,

857
00:52:58,611 --> 00:53:02,870
they say, well, I'm 21 years old, I'm,
I'm, I'm able to make my own decisions.

858
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:04,040
And you say,

859
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:07,670
and they want you to agree with that and
you want to agree with it because you

860
00:53:07,671 --> 00:53:10,970
hope that there are ready
to make their own decisions.
And, and you, and you think,

861
00:53:10,971 --> 00:53:14,360
well, maybe they have matured to that
point. So what are you saying? Well,

862
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:19,390
you're saying that they are gifted with
the ability to take the responsibility

863
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:25,010
to shape the reality around
them and they insist upon,

864
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:30,560
they insist upon you recognizing that in
them as a hallmark of respect and love.

865
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:32,311
And you know,

866
00:53:32,311 --> 00:53:36,630
you might be irritated because they're
not acting responsibly enough to deserve

867
00:53:36,631 --> 00:53:40,810
that, but it's still what you hope
for and want. And so like, well,

868
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:44,670
so what is it where the sovereign
cornerstone of the state, each of us,

869
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,210
what are we going to dispute that?
Well, we know the cost of that. Okay,

870
00:53:48,211 --> 00:53:52,950
well do we have that spark of divinity?
Well, what do we struggle with day to day?

871
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:57,120
We struggle with the potential that's in
front of us and transforming that into

872
00:53:57,121 --> 00:53:58,710
the reality that could be,

873
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:02,490
that's as close to a divine
faculty as anything I can think of.

874
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:07,580
It's completely mysterious that we can
wrestle with the the fabric of becoming

875
00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:11,850
and turn it into the actuality of
being and that we seem to do that as a

876
00:54:11,851 --> 00:54:15,120
consequence of our ethical choices.
Right? You make bad choices,

877
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,880
you think they're bad,
bad things happen,

878
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,320
right and you think
they're bad and so it's,

879
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:24,510
you took the potential that was there in
front of you and you made something bad

880
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:24,990
of it.

881
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:29,940
You can do that and you can also do
what's good and we know that of each other

882
00:54:29,941 --> 00:54:32,910
and that's part of the reason that we're
granted let's say the right and the

883
00:54:32,911 --> 00:54:37,830
responsibility of being the cornerstone
of the state and so that the idea that

884
00:54:37,831 --> 00:54:41,880
there is that divinity in us, I think
that's associated with our consciousness,

885
00:54:41,881 --> 00:54:44,820
whatever that is because
consciousness is a mystery.

886
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:49,020
It seems to give reality to being right.
What's being without consciousness,

887
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:51,450
there's no one there to perceive anything.

888
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:56,040
There's no one there to shape anything.
It's like, is there anything there? We'll,

889
00:54:56,041 --> 00:54:59,400
our consciousness itself seems
to be what participates in,

890
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,750
in the reality of being an and the,

891
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:06,790
the transformation of potential into
into actuality for better or for worse.

892
00:55:07,261 --> 00:55:09,000
So there's an ethical domain to it too.

893
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:13,000
It's like there's no reason for
us to be questioning these fun,

894
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:16,890
this fundamental assumption,
unless we think we have a better theory.

895
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:20,340
What is that? Well, it's your
race. It's your power structure.

896
00:55:20,341 --> 00:55:21,990
It's like that's what you want.

897
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:25,860
You want to be judged on
by collective standards.

898
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:30,790
It doesn't matter what you did in, in
this forward, I wrote for the social,

899
00:55:30,791 --> 00:55:35,310
and it's in book, you know the red, the
people who ran the magazine, red terror.

900
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:39,180
That's a hell of a magazine. Red
Terror. Because they said, well look,

901
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:43,560
if you're getting rid of the
bourgeoisie, you know, don't just be,

902
00:55:43,561 --> 00:55:46,320
start stopping with the
people who own businesses.

903
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:49,830
You want to get rid of their children too
because they're infected with the same

904
00:55:49,831 --> 00:55:52,710
damn evil spirit.
And just to be on the safe side.

905
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:56,910
How about you take out the grandchildren
to six year old, 10 year old,

906
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,320
doesn't matter. Everyone goes, you know,
and what happened in the Soviet Union,

907
00:56:01,321 --> 00:56:04,680
everyone judged on their
collective identity, right?

908
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:06,060
That's how you're going to be judged.

909
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:10,560
I'll find something about your collective
identity that's not so positive, right?

910
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:15,180
Some manner in which regardless of how
pressed you are, you're also an oppressor.

911
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:18,690
You know, for you it might be your
mail will, that would do it. You know,

912
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,970
for you it might be that
you're middle class.

913
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:26,030
I can find some dimension of your multiple
collective identities on which you're

914
00:56:26,081 --> 00:56:31,081
an oppressor and that's good enough to
do you in if you take the collectivists

915
00:56:31,481 --> 00:56:34,600
route. The alternative to
that is no, no, no, no.

916
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:41,210
We have that spark of divinity.
It's associated with a deep,

917
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:46,280
deep responsibility and it's an the
ability that goes along with that and we

918
00:56:46,281 --> 00:56:47,390
play that out all the time.

919
00:56:47,391 --> 00:56:50,750
We play it out every time we play
fair games with one another, we have,

920
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:53,870
we have decent,
honest relationships with one another.

921
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:58,760
We have business arrangements that are
honest and work and we can cooperate for

922
00:56:58,761 --> 00:57:01,280
long periods of time.
We take care of our children properly.

923
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:05,810
We take care of our old people properly.
It's all predicated on the same thing.

924
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:10,400
You have intrinsic value.
And even if you do something terrible,

925
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:13,360
let's say,
and I still have the,

926
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:18,590
the conviction that you have value,
then it's incumbent on me to say,

927
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,870
well,
you did something terrible,

928
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:25,400
but you aren't necessarily something
terrible and it might be possible for you

929
00:57:25,401 --> 00:57:29,270
to shed that and to a tone and
to read, join. Those are good.

930
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,740
And that's something too,

931
00:57:30,741 --> 00:57:34,940
and it's built deeply into our political
and economic injustice systems.

932
00:57:34,941 --> 00:57:39,320
And it's, it's no time to be
abandoning this. You know,

933
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:41,000
especially when you look around the world,

934
00:57:41,001 --> 00:57:44,990
you see as it's spreading and it's
spreading quite rapidly everywhere it's

935
00:57:44,991 --> 00:57:48,770
spreading.
Things are getting way better.

936
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:52,970
So enough crisis of
confidence in the West.

937
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:55,910
Like we've got our house to put an order.
There's no doubt about that.

938
00:57:55,911 --> 00:58:00,500
But I see no reason why we can't do
it unless we lose faith in ourselves.

939
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:05,300
And there's reason for that. Like life
is brutal. There's reason to lose faith,

940
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:09,290
but not in the final analysis.
It's, it's a mark of,

941
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:11,240
okay,

942
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:14,300
it's a mark of malevolence
and cowardice to lose faith.

943
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:18,060
The inherent problem with that though,
or just very briefly,

944
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:21,600
is that the people that are,
that are promoting these ideas,

945
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:25,830
they actually believe that the experiment
of freedom, which is all that it is,

946
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:29,370
they believe it is bad.
They believe that America is bad,

947
00:58:29,371 --> 00:58:32,040
that the freedoms that
you've won here are bad.

948
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:34,230
And what's interesting is
I've seen such a massive look.

949
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,350
I was a lefty my entire life and yeah,

950
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:42,090
and I should be judged accordingly.
But I mean, look what I've seen,

951
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:45,810
what I see now is, look, I could sit up
here and give you my, my lefty credit,

952
00:58:45,811 --> 00:58:48,660
right? So I'm gay, married,
I'm begrudgingly pro choice,

953
00:58:48,661 --> 00:58:51,740
although I'm really struggling with that
one lately because the left has now,

954
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:55,150
especially in America, guns soap,
Anna's, uh, on the board issue,

955
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:57,420
it has gone completely crazy.
I mean,

956
00:58:57,421 --> 00:59:01,050
they're literally quite literally talking
about post birth abortions. I mean,

957
00:59:01,051 --> 00:59:05,070
it's, it's, it's really nuts. Um,
I'm, I'm against the death penalty.

958
00:59:05,071 --> 00:59:08,010
I'm for reforming the prison systems
and for strong public education. I mean,

959
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:11,010
I give you a litany of lefty ideas,
right?

960
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:16,460
But I can't get invited anywhere by the
left or a democratic group or anywhere

961
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:19,170
by any of these people. But
you know, who invites me,

962
00:59:19,171 --> 00:59:22,190
the Conservatives and I go up there and
I tell them all the reasons I disagree

963
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:24,620
with them. And the Libertarians,
I mean, I like the Libertarians,

964
00:59:24,621 --> 00:59:27,740
they're mostly stone, but like, you know,

965
00:59:28,850 --> 00:59:30,950
I'm also a pro pot. Um, but,

966
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:34,550
but why is it that almost
everyone right now,

967
00:59:34,551 --> 00:59:36,920
I would say if you're a conservative,
if you're libertarian, if you're,

968
00:59:36,921 --> 00:59:39,620
so if you're a classical liberal
or sort of a disaffected lefty,

969
00:59:39,621 --> 00:59:42,470
if you're an independent and a
couple other things, if you're,

970
00:59:42,471 --> 00:59:43,760
if you're any of those,

971
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:47,450
there's a great group of people right
now that are willing to agree to disagree

972
00:59:47,451 --> 00:59:49,100
and get to exactly what your question was,

973
00:59:49,101 --> 00:59:51,140
which is how do you sit down with
people without impugning them?

974
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:54,350
The only people we're talking about at
the moment that have any institutional

975
00:59:54,351 --> 00:59:57,290
power, because you know, everyone, every
time you talk about this, someone says,

976
00:59:57,291 --> 00:59:59,930
well, but there it's for white
nationalists here and that.

977
00:59:59,931 --> 01:00:02,210
And it's like they have no power,
no one cares about them.

978
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,600
The media promotes them to make it seem
like they're massive and they're not no

979
01:00:05,601 --> 01:00:05,980
one,

980
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:09,200
but even the right does a pretty decent
job of saying that these people are no

981
01:00:09,201 --> 01:00:14,090
good. So all we're really
fighting is this hysteric what,

982
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:17,610
what was that study in the Atlantic
where it's only something like 8%. Yeah.

983
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:20,810
And the only 10% of them
think it's gone too far.

984
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:24,080
So something like 8% of the,
uh,

985
01:00:24,081 --> 01:00:28,820
of people believe really in
this postmodern progressive
yup. View of the world.

986
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:31,100
And a lot of them are
shaky within that belief.

987
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:35,000
So it seems like a big monster because
the media is always pushing it on us

988
01:00:35,001 --> 01:00:36,880
because they are allowed. But I, I'm,

989
01:00:36,881 --> 01:00:40,310
I'm extremely enthused that we've got all
over the world and met good people who

990
01:00:40,311 --> 01:00:43,370
were, who were, I think need to
be a little braver perhaps, but,

991
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,140
but are here and are willing to,

992
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:48,340
I want to call that bravery
and amendment. I bet that, um,

993
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:52,690
what you've just said reminds me
of two remarkable men in history,

994
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:56,500
a GK Chesterton and George Bernard Shaw.

995
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:59,850
They disagreed on just about
everything you could think of,

996
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:03,320
but I loved each other's company.
Now isn't that incredible?

997
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:08,700
They couldn't wait to be together to have
another good argument and a good feed

998
01:01:08,701 --> 01:01:13,430
together. That's what we need.
The genius of Western harmony,

999
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:18,700
surely as lion in our ability to respect
one another even over our deepest

1000
01:01:20,871 --> 01:01:24,440
differences. And one day, yeah,

1001
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:28,370
Chesterton was huge. He was six
foot four and very, very heavy.

1002
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:32,330
George Bernard Shaw was in great shape.
Like you'd take fellows and um,

1003
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:37,750
and at GK test it and looked at George
Van Chore slimmers a Rake and he said,

1004
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,660
bye g George,

1005
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:47,550
you look as though they must be a famine
in England and George Freeman shore

1006
01:01:47,551 --> 01:01:50,880
shot back as quickly as you got to
imagine there's a great big dog,

1007
01:01:50,881 --> 01:01:53,090
Andy and Matt and you
look like you're the core.

1008
01:01:56,990 --> 01:01:58,270
But you just mentioned curry.

1009
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:02,770
I want to get to some of the terrific
questions and people who've put up before

1010
01:02:02,771 --> 01:02:06,010
I do
curry.

1011
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:10,650
Just something you've both displayed
in spite falls and it's incredibly

1012
01:02:10,651 --> 01:02:11,484
important.

1013
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,930
We live in a culture now where
I think there's a lot of fear.

1014
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:20,010
When I was last with you were at,
and there's

1015
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:21,780
a thousand people in our auditorium,

1016
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:24,480
a lot of them are young
men and I looked around,

1017
01:02:24,481 --> 01:02:28,110
I thought these are
terrific young Australians.

1018
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:34,550
They pretty concerned about whether their
masculinity might be toxic and they're

1019
01:02:35,011 --> 01:02:38,670
pretty fearful about speaking out because
you know we had once upon a time we

1020
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:41,520
used to burn people at the stake and
where and then we went for the guillotine.

1021
01:02:41,521 --> 01:02:42,630
Then we went for the hangman's noose.

1022
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:45,450
Now we kill people in
social media and we do.

1023
01:02:45,870 --> 01:02:50,670
People get kneecapped every day and worse.
I think we owe you a great debt,

1024
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:55,230
both of you actually, because you
dared to break the ceiling. And Dave,

1025
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:59,370
you actually asked Jordan about this in
Norway. This is the beauty of modern.

1026
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:02,970
Even. I caught up a bit, you know,
I heard your conversation. You said,

1027
01:03:02,971 --> 01:03:04,120
did you ask Jordan?

1028
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:09,130
Did you expect when you started on this
journey to end up like this and you

1029
01:03:10,951 --> 01:03:12,730
asked him what it's like
to break through that,

1030
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:15,390
how do you feel about it when
you're attacked and, and,

1031
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:18,770
and you were very open
and very honest. Uh, and,

1032
01:03:18,771 --> 01:03:21,810
and you said that it's very tough
when a journalist does. You're over,

1033
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,770
but you might like to repeat
that question to Jordan. Well,

1034
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:27,360
quickly on the bravery thing,
my partner hates when I say this,

1035
01:03:27,361 --> 01:03:31,650
but I don't consider myself brave. I am
doing what I think is right. That is it.

1036
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:35,730
That really is it. I wake up every
morning and I feel that I have a,

1037
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:39,270
I have something to do that's relevant
and important and being on this tour with

1038
01:03:39,271 --> 01:03:42,030
Jordan has been life
altering and not only for,

1039
01:03:42,031 --> 01:03:44,040
I live for all the people that show there,
but I don't,

1040
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:46,740
I don't view it as bravery.
I couldn't not do it,

1041
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:50,980
I guess is the best way to say it. I got
her. I just got to make the point there.

1042
01:03:51,030 --> 01:03:53,880
I think you're probably
being very tough on yourself.

1043
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:58,170
I think the reality is that courage
is not so much not knowing fear.

1044
01:03:58,200 --> 01:03:59,610
It's overcoming it,
isn't it?

1045
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,310
And there must've been times when
you've wanted to sort of say to you,

1046
01:04:02,311 --> 01:04:05,730
I don't want to be under this attack.
Well, I guess I saw it enough when I,

1047
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,540
when I started waking up to some of what
was going on on the left and I had seen

1048
01:04:09,541 --> 01:04:12,690
the tactics over and over and
how they destroyed good people.

1049
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:17,850
I suppose that as that went on and
as I woke up and got out of it,

1050
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:22,200
I just became numb to that. And I just
wouldn't, I just wouldn't live like that,

1051
01:04:22,201 --> 01:04:23,490
I would think.
Um,

1052
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:28,530
but the question that I
asked you in Norway in effect
was you didn't set out for

1053
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:31,620
this when, when see 16
came around, you know,

1054
01:04:31,621 --> 01:04:33,390
you were doing all sorts of other things.
You got to practice,

1055
01:04:33,391 --> 01:04:38,391
you were teaching all of these other
things and you yet you've survived these,

1056
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,410
well,
it's not even the attacks.

1057
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:43,170
You've survived a road that
you didn't plan on being on.

1058
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:48,150
And the bravery that you've shown along
the way is why people keep coming back.

1059
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:50,970
They keep, they're rooting for
us more as, as you often say,

1060
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:53,760
it's like these hit pieces come
out and then in a weird way,

1061
01:04:53,761 --> 01:04:56,400
and now I see it with me.
They've moved on from you by the way.

1062
01:04:56,401 --> 01:04:59,970
They're working on me now. But uh, yeah,
yeah, I'm happy. I'm happy to help.

1063
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,690
But in a weird way,
it wasn't that you reveled in it,

1064
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:07,470
but you made a point of saying, look,
every time they do it, I'm still here.

1065
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:11,310
And I think I really took me awhile to
understand that because I always want,

1066
01:05:11,311 --> 01:05:14,340
you know, I wanted to defend my friends,
but I also wanted to defend myself.

1067
01:05:14,341 --> 01:05:16,980
And now it's like, all right,
keep coming. I'm still here.

1068
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:20,530
We must be doing something right because
I don't spend all my day attacking

1069
01:05:20,531 --> 01:05:24,280
other people. I'll gladly attack ideas,
but I don't attack people. I mean,

1070
01:05:24,281 --> 01:05:25,390
I don't think we've done anything up here.

1071
01:05:25,391 --> 01:05:28,060
Where are we attack the singular
person. Right. And that's a,

1072
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,290
that's a huge difference.

1073
01:05:29,291 --> 01:05:32,080
So the question really was you
inadvertently in a weird way,

1074
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:36,550
I'm not a big fan of Cortez. Okay,
fine, fair enough. Uh, yeah, exactly.

1075
01:05:36,551 --> 01:05:37,660
So every now and again though,

1076
01:05:37,661 --> 01:05:41,180
but I think I talked about her ideas
and I've heard talk about that in the

1077
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:44,650
public sphere. I talked about her and her
credit score, but you know, not her as a,

1078
01:05:44,980 --> 01:05:46,690
as a person,
but right.

1079
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:49,360
And she is in the public sphere
and it's also impossible to,

1080
01:05:49,410 --> 01:05:52,150
to never talk about people.
So it's you keep,

1081
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,450
you can't be that lofty all the time,
but you can try to be a little bit,

1082
01:05:55,600 --> 01:06:00,010
but that basically you inadvertently
ended up in this position where now by

1083
01:06:00,011 --> 01:06:01,570
virtue of showing bravery,

1084
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:05,650
well you sold out the Sydney
Opera House in five minutes.

1085
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:11,220
It's a matter. I think it's a matter
of being afraid of the right thing.

1086
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:15,840
That's the issue.
It's like I decided a long time ago,

1087
01:06:15,841 --> 01:06:17,180
partly from reading soldier and it's,

1088
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:20,790
and that I was going to try to be very
careful with my words and I was only

1089
01:06:20,791 --> 01:06:24,720
going to say things that I thought
well to begin with were lies.

1090
01:06:24,721 --> 01:06:28,350
Let's say I was going to try to
formulate my thoughts truthfully.

1091
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:33,750
And the reason I decided that was
because I thought that the opposite was

1092
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:38,370
hellishly dangerous.
And I really, I really,

1093
01:06:38,371 --> 01:06:40,920
I really believe that.
I truly believe that.

1094
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:46,160
And so if I say things and I think
they're true and they get me in trouble,

1095
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:49,103
then I think,

1096
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:54,780
well that's not as much trouble as I
would have got into if I would have said

1097
01:06:54,781 --> 01:06:59,280
something that wasn't true. Like it might
be more trouble right now. Who knows?

1098
01:06:59,281 --> 01:07:02,940
Right. Because you and you don't know
how these things are going to turn out.

1099
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,590
And I had this interview,

1100
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:08,400
most of you know about it with Kathy
Newman from Channel Four. Right.

1101
01:07:08,401 --> 01:07:12,180
And that was a pretty strange experience.
Um,

1102
01:07:12,510 --> 01:07:16,380
so what you're saying is it
was a great interview. Yeah,
exactly. Exactly, exactly.

1103
01:07:16,381 --> 01:07:20,070
And you know, she was pretty
professional when we went to the studio.

1104
01:07:20,071 --> 01:07:25,010
Like someone like that is professional
kind of hard surface and glossy and, and,

1105
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:28,890
and media presentable, you know,
the TV turns you into that.

1106
01:07:28,891 --> 01:07:33,891
And she was perfectly polite in a
professional way until the camera went on.

1107
01:07:34,531 --> 01:07:38,130
And then, you know, and then
she went after me and um,

1108
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:44,090
and then the whole interview when,
when the way it went, and I thought, I,

1109
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:46,800
I have like 20 interviews that day.
And,

1110
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:49,350
and so I walked away from
that and I thought, Oh God,

1111
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:53,290
they're going to take seven minutes of
that and you know, broadcast it and,

1112
01:07:53,291 --> 01:07:56,940
and make me look like a complete monster.
And that'll be the end of that.

1113
01:07:57,150 --> 01:07:59,280
And that is exactly what they did,

1114
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:04,700
except they also posted the
entire thing on youtube,

1115
01:08:06,330 --> 01:08:10,710
not knowing at all that it was
a train wreck. He had no idea.

1116
01:08:10,711 --> 01:08:12,540
It wasn't like they thought,
oh, this is a train wreck.

1117
01:08:12,541 --> 01:08:14,760
We better put it on Youtube.
It wasn't that at all.

1118
01:08:14,761 --> 01:08:16,550
They thought it was a
perfectly fine interview.

1119
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:21,620
So then it went on youtube and so,
well, so like my mood changed a lot.

1120
01:08:21,621 --> 01:08:25,760
It was first of all, well this interview
went catastrophic Lee. And then it was,

1121
01:08:25,761 --> 01:08:29,060
well they're only going to use seven
minutes of it. That's going to be a drag,

1122
01:08:29,061 --> 01:08:30,200
but I'll probably get over it.

1123
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:35,450
And then they put it online and then
there was just an incredible reaction and

1124
01:08:35,451 --> 01:08:40,451
then five 10 newspapers came out to
play the victim card for poor Kathy,

1125
01:08:41,871 --> 01:08:45,620
which was now all of the
online trolls were after her.

1126
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:48,950
And I thought that really,
really struck me.

1127
01:08:48,951 --> 01:08:53,810
I thought she's one of the
most powerful people in the UK,

1128
01:08:53,870 --> 01:08:58,190
you know, one of the thousand
most powerful, let's say,
or the 500 most powerful.

1129
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:02,690
She's no bloody victim and
she's played paid plenty. Well,

1130
01:09:02,691 --> 01:09:03,580
for what she does,

1131
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:06,960
Jordan, by the way, don't forget that that
night that this all happened, she was,

1132
01:09:06,990 --> 01:09:10,200
she did a video in her car reading
the troll, the comments by the trolls,

1133
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:13,830
because at that moment she didn't realize
she should play the victim card yet

1134
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:16,410
she was reveling in
it. Yeah. Right, right.

1135
01:09:16,411 --> 01:09:17,910
That's what it was
until she realized that,

1136
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:20,920
yeah, yeah, yeah. And so then
her, her employees said, well,

1137
01:09:20,921 --> 01:09:24,170
we had to call in the police to
investigate. What does that have to run?

1138
01:09:24,171 --> 01:09:25,900
Unbelievably crooked thing to say.

1139
01:09:25,901 --> 01:09:30,850
It's like anybody can call in the damn
police to investigate anything. It's like,

1140
01:09:31,060 --> 01:09:34,240
well, what constitutes a
credible threat? Well, there,

1141
01:09:34,241 --> 01:09:36,520
there are ways of assessing
credible threats. You know,

1142
01:09:36,521 --> 01:09:41,170
they have to be direct and
detailed. That's, that's how
you assessed suicidality.

1143
01:09:41,171 --> 01:09:44,350
For example,
if you tell me that you have a plan,

1144
01:09:44,530 --> 01:09:47,590
you know when you're going to do it,
you know where you have a gun,

1145
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:52,090
you've thought it through, it's
like that's a credible threat. Um,

1146
01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:55,660
sometimes I wish I wasn't here.
That's not a credible threat.

1147
01:09:55,810 --> 01:09:57,550
And you'll see the same
sort of thing online.

1148
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:00,250
Well then 10 newspapers
played the victim card.

1149
01:10:00,251 --> 01:10:05,251
That poor Kathy was being trolled by Bob
at that point by like a million trolls.

1150
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:08,470
Who knew there were that many trolls.
But apparently they were.

1151
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:09,880
And then I thought,
well God,

1152
01:10:09,881 --> 01:10:12,490
the whole thing is going to go sideways
again because I'm going to come out of

1153
01:10:12,491 --> 01:10:15,070
this as the villain who called forth,
you know,

1154
01:10:15,071 --> 01:10:18,670
the alright armada to take down.
Poor,

1155
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:20,350
innocent Kathy Newman.

1156
01:10:20,351 --> 01:10:23,560
And so it looked like it was going to
shift that way for about four days.

1157
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:25,510
And then, well, that didn't work.

1158
01:10:25,511 --> 01:10:28,870
There was a couple of other interviews
that started to push back that narrative

1159
01:10:28,871 --> 01:10:32,020
and, and then it switched
back to my side. But look,

1160
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:36,700
I'm making a point with this is when
I do an interview like this interview,

1161
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:38,440
um,
I don't,

1162
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,190
I follow this rule in my book rule,

1163
01:10:43,490 --> 01:10:44,323
which is it,

1164
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:51,830
let's see. I think it's eight.
We've been doing this for awhile.

1165
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:56,490
It's seven. Oh, do what is meaningful,
not what is expedient. Okay.

1166
01:10:56,491 --> 01:11:00,930
So I come to an event like this and I
have an opportunity to say things and I

1167
01:11:00,931 --> 01:11:02,790
don't come in here and think,
okay,

1168
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:07,110
here's a bunch of things I want to
convince you up. You know, it's, I,

1169
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:09,660
I don't care if you're convinced.

1170
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:12,840
It's not like I don't care
about you and you know, in,

1171
01:11:12,841 --> 01:11:16,530
in the sense that you care for
people and hope the best for them.

1172
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:20,490
But I don't care if you're convinced I,
that's not what I'm here for.

1173
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:25,440
What I'm here for is to hear the questions
and try to figure out what I think

1174
01:11:25,441 --> 01:11:29,850
about them. And then to say that
and then to see what happens.

1175
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:35,280
Like who, who the hell knows what's going
to happen? But there's, here's the if, if,

1176
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,210
if, if the world is properly
constituted through truth,

1177
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:44,160
then faith is the willingness
to have faith in truth.

1178
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:49,790
And so then you say what you believe to
be true and then some things happen and

1179
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:53,400
sometimes they're not so good, which
is why people often lie. You know,

1180
01:11:53,401 --> 01:11:56,670
you tell the truth, you get in trouble
for it. Every kid knows that. It's like,

1181
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:59,220
well, why'd you lie? Because I
thought I'd get in trouble. Well,

1182
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:02,850
obviously it's like, well, that's
not a good longterm strategy.

1183
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:06,930
It's like so you say what you believe
to be the truth and then you have the

1184
01:12:06,931 --> 01:12:10,500
faith that no matter what happens,

1185
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:13,890
if you've said what you
believe to be truth,

1186
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:19,290
whatever happens is the best thing that
could've happened and I believe that.

1187
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:24,030
I think that's how the
world is constituted and so
it's not bravery. Exactly.

1188
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:27,900
I would say it's more like faith.
It's like I'm going to say what I think.

1189
01:12:27,901 --> 01:12:31,890
I'm going to try to do that as carefully
as I possibly can and I'm going to

1190
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:36,940
detach myself from the outcome because
sometimes they'll comes terrible.

1191
01:12:36,941 --> 01:12:41,941
I met McMaster university or Queens and
there's like a bloody mob of zombies

1192
01:12:42,571 --> 01:12:45,180
pounding on the window. You know,
it's a little slice of hell.

1193
01:12:45,181 --> 01:12:47,670
You think there's doesn't
seem to be a very good idea,

1194
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:52,050
but you know the tide turns two or
three times in the next three weeks and

1195
01:12:52,051 --> 01:12:56,070
something comes out of it. And so if
you're going to have faith and truth,

1196
01:12:56,250 --> 01:13:00,660
it can't just be, well, did I get
what I want in the next second?

1197
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:04,750
That's not, that's not faith. It's
like, no, I'm going to, it's an,

1198
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:06,960
this is the other thing too
that you got to understand,

1199
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,900
I think is that without truth,

1200
01:13:09,901 --> 01:13:13,680
you don't have the adventure of your life.
You see,

1201
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:17,910
because if you tell the truth,
that means you revealing your being.

1202
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:22,410
That's what you're doing when you're
telling the truth and when you,

1203
01:13:23,460 --> 01:13:26,610
when you reveal your being,
then you're,

1204
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:31,620
you're living in the world. You're
there, you're present, right? You're,

1205
01:13:31,621 --> 01:13:35,490
you're, you're, you're,
that's being there.

1206
01:13:35,491 --> 01:13:40,140
Let's say that's you, that's your
destiny, that's your journey,

1207
01:13:40,141 --> 01:13:44,490
that's your adventure. That's what's
going to justify your life, the adventure.

1208
01:13:44,910 --> 01:13:48,480
It's not going to be easy,
but my nephew hide from your truth.

1209
01:13:48,481 --> 01:13:51,570
Well then you hide from yourself
and then you're not even there.

1210
01:13:51,571 --> 01:13:54,120
And then who the hell are
you? What are you, the puppet,

1211
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:55,980
you're the puppet of some coward.

1212
01:13:56,130 --> 01:13:59,700
You're the puppet of some dictator
or some second rate philosopher,

1213
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:03,990
some idiotic idea or a bully
you were afraid of in grade six.

1214
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:05,370
God only knows,

1215
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:10,670
but it's not you living your life and
then you lose your life and you lose your

1216
01:14:11,291 --> 01:14:15,910
soul to soul. That's what
I'm afraid of. And so,

1217
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:20,230
you know, journalists swell, they
tried to take me down. It's like, yeah,

1218
01:14:20,231 --> 01:14:23,080
well that's annoying. And it usually
takes me three days to recover,

1219
01:14:23,081 --> 01:14:27,620
but compared to not having my life and,

1220
01:14:27,890 --> 01:14:32,040
and, and, and not saying
what I have to say, that's,

1221
01:14:32,330 --> 01:14:35,830
that's nothing. It's nothing. It's,

1222
01:14:35,890 --> 01:14:40,360
it's minor inconvenience. And
then generally, if you can,

1223
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:45,410
if you can just withstand it, you know,
two weeks you get mobbed. You guys are,

1224
01:14:45,430 --> 01:14:49,990
might only need to know this. You're
going to get mob on social media. Okay?

1225
01:14:49,991 --> 01:14:54,250
So what do you do?
Unless you did something wrong,

1226
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:57,370
don't apologize.
That's the first thing.

1227
01:14:57,371 --> 01:15:00,850
Cause the no one can come to your defense.
So don't apologize.

1228
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:04,090
Maybe you even doubled down carefully,
carefully,

1229
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:08,320
not Vinge fully right carefully.
You say, no, that's what I meant.

1230
01:15:08,650 --> 01:15:12,700
And if you don't like it too bad and
you get more, then you apologize.

1231
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:15,970
A different mob comes after you. That's
not helpful and no one can defend you.

1232
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:20,980
If you can hold out for two weeks,
you'll win.

1233
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:24,720
Now it's a pretty brutal two weeks.
Cause you know,

1234
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:28,630
if you're a reasonable
person and a hundred angry
neighbors show up at your door

1235
01:15:28,631 --> 01:15:32,440
with pitchforks, you might
be thinking there's something
wrong with you. You know,

1236
01:15:32,441 --> 01:15:35,350
like you think that unless you're
a psychopathic and you think,

1237
01:15:35,351 --> 01:15:39,730
well maybe I made a mistake and it's
easy to waver and to and to back down.

1238
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:42,340
And maybe you're also afraid,
but you know,

1239
01:15:42,341 --> 01:15:46,450
if you scoured your conscience and you're
careful and you said what you had to

1240
01:15:46,451 --> 01:15:48,790
say,
then leave it lie.

1241
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:54,210
And if they'll throw the people who are
playing this game will throw everything

1242
01:15:55,961 --> 01:15:59,410
they can at you for two weeks
and if it doesn't stick,

1243
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:04,480
you're done.
And then the next time they try it,

1244
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:07,300
it doesn't work as well
as it did the first time.

1245
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:12,370
And by the 50th time they try it.
Like as far as I can tell carefully,

1246
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:18,460
the people who have enmity
for me are out of ammunition.

1247
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:22,390
They're done. I read hit
pieces now and I think, oh,

1248
01:16:22,391 --> 01:16:24,580
you just copied the hip
piece from two months ago.

1249
01:16:24,581 --> 01:16:28,780
It's like I'm perfectly
habituated to that.

1250
01:16:29,140 --> 01:16:32,950
They're out of ammunition
and maybe you know,

1251
01:16:32,951 --> 01:16:36,460
like someone creative could still
come up with some more ammunition.

1252
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:38,290
Maybe that'll happen at the Q and a,

1253
01:16:38,710 --> 01:16:43,030
but it's not bravery,
man. It's faith in the,

1254
01:16:43,150 --> 01:16:45,970
in the redeeming power of
truth and that's different.

1255
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:48,960
That's incredibly
interesting and encouraging.

1256
01:16:49,830 --> 01:16:52,350
That's come through a couple of questions.
Yup.

1257
01:16:52,470 --> 01:16:54,260
I'll just preface them
by saying [inaudible]

1258
01:16:55,770 --> 01:16:58,920
we actually did a bit of research on this
and one of the things that people say

1259
01:16:58,921 --> 01:17:03,240
is they love hearing your stories and
I love hearing you being open and they

1260
01:17:03,241 --> 01:17:06,390
love it when you connect
personally with them.

1261
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:10,920
And somebody wanted to connect with you
and Tammy Tammy's here with you on the,

1262
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:15,560
I think very conscious of the
incredible timetable that your setting.

1263
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:20,540
So is Allister there you wanted to
ask about how this works for you?

1264
01:17:23,890 --> 01:17:24,790
It's so great.

1265
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:28,750
I the opportunity for both of you in
person in a moment of uncharacteristic

1266
01:17:28,751 --> 01:17:32,170
courage, uh, close to two
years ago I got married again.

1267
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:37,030
A woman who on any objective measure
completely outranks me. Congratulations.

1268
01:17:37,031 --> 01:17:37,600
Thank you.

1269
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:41,050
Now she is very high on assertiveness
and I'm very high in conscientiousness,

1270
01:17:41,051 --> 01:17:44,320
which you will fully
understand and so we can tend,

1271
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,590
we contend a lot and it's good
and we're going somewhere good.

1272
01:17:48,610 --> 01:17:51,490
And I'm very proud for what it's worth.
Um,

1273
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:55,090
I'm aware and I imagine what your life
is like and I'm talking to you Jordan,

1274
01:17:55,091 --> 01:17:56,590
but Dave,
I don't want to exclude you either.

1275
01:17:56,950 --> 01:17:59,620
And I imagine your life being
one of constant exhaustion,

1276
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:02,710
exhilaration and probably a
fair bit of terror as well.

1277
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:06,610
And the word contending is one that
you actually used a few days ago on a

1278
01:18:06,611 --> 01:18:08,170
different platform in a different city.

1279
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:11,560
You're talking to young people and you
challenged them to marry him mate with

1280
01:18:11,561 --> 01:18:15,570
whom they would contend. And I think
of Tammy and I think of you and,

1281
01:18:15,571 --> 01:18:19,210
and we don't hear a great deal
of of Tammy, but you guys are,

1282
01:18:19,780 --> 01:18:23,470
I'm sure working really hard.
You're contending,

1283
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:27,190
you're confronting all this stuff and
you're processing it and I'm sure your

1284
01:18:27,191 --> 01:18:28,990
marriage is strengthening.
I trust it is.

1285
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:30,700
And I'd love some insight on that if you,

1286
01:18:30,701 --> 01:18:34,240
if you can speak to what you're learning
about marriage in this season of your

1287
01:18:34,241 --> 01:18:35,074
life.

1288
01:18:35,410 --> 01:18:39,220
Well the first thing we're doing is the,
Tammy is traveling with me,

1289
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:45,040
so that's very helpful and she's
paying attention, you know,

1290
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:50,100
so and we talk a lot about what is
going on but also a lot about our family

1291
01:18:51,701 --> 01:18:54,190
cause there's complicated
things going on in our family.

1292
01:18:54,191 --> 01:18:59,170
Like there are in most families and we
do our best to communicate, you know,

1293
01:18:59,171 --> 01:19:02,710
and she says what she thinks.
And I say what I think.

1294
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:06,600
And we don't always think the same thing.
You don't,

1295
01:19:06,601 --> 01:19:09,820
but we do our best to listen.

1296
01:19:10,690 --> 01:19:13,960
We do our best to assume that just
because the other person has a different

1297
01:19:13,961 --> 01:19:16,060
opinion doesn't mean that they're wrong,

1298
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:17,980
even though it would
be lovely if they were.

1299
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:23,280
And then we try to come up with a
negotiated solution that's mutually

1300
01:19:24,461 --> 01:19:29,230
acceptable, you know, and,
and we discussed strategy as
well. I mean, for example,

1301
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:34,030
when we started this tour, which was
more than a year ago, we thought,

1302
01:19:34,090 --> 01:19:37,120
you know, there's a lot of competing
things that you could think about a tour,

1303
01:19:37,121 --> 01:19:41,230
especially when we have no idea how
long it would be. Like, what was this?

1304
01:19:41,231 --> 01:19:44,020
Was this a vacation? We
were going to, you know,

1305
01:19:44,021 --> 01:19:47,860
spectacular cities all
over the world. Um, um,

1306
01:19:48,010 --> 01:19:51,730
was it time for us to spend together?
Like what was it, what were we doing?

1307
01:19:52,170 --> 01:19:56,710
And we spent two hours thinking,
it's like, no, this is work.

1308
01:19:57,490 --> 01:20:00,910
We have a remarkable
opportunity here. And, and,

1309
01:20:01,270 --> 01:20:04,480
and we're going to do the work. We're
going to hit as many cities as we can.

1310
01:20:04,990 --> 01:20:07,860
And so what does that mean?
It means we get the up in the morning,

1311
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:11,220
we make sure we're packed,
our suitcases aren't too full,

1312
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:13,650
we don't carry anything that
goes underneath the plane.

1313
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:17,670
We make sure that I don't get hungry
because then I can't perform properly.

1314
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:22,830
We make sure that I met the theater at
the right point in time and we make sure

1315
01:20:22,831 --> 01:20:27,480
that our eye is focused on the fact that
it's a great privilege and it's very

1316
01:20:27,481 --> 01:20:31,230
unlikely that we can do this. And so
we thought, okay, that's the deal.

1317
01:20:31,231 --> 01:20:33,060
And then we thought,
well,

1318
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:37,290
and then we can take an hour or two
here and there if we're fortunate to see

1319
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:41,370
some of the city and to take a break and
to do that when we count. And you know,

1320
01:20:41,371 --> 01:20:45,840
we've negotiated other details about
exactly how intense the scheduling was

1321
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:46,674
going to be.

1322
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:51,600
But it's a constant negotiation and
it is a contentious negotiation,

1323
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:56,400
which is good because these
things are complicated, you know,

1324
01:20:56,490 --> 01:20:58,620
and to think something
complicated through,

1325
01:20:58,621 --> 01:21:02,610
you need a good argument on this side and
you need a good argument on this side.

1326
01:21:02,611 --> 01:21:06,120
And then you got to have add are and see
if you can come out with an even better

1327
01:21:06,121 --> 01:21:09,240
argument as a consequence.
And so that seemed to work.

1328
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:13,950
Now there's other advantages. It
turns out the Tammy is very suited. I,

1329
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:15,840
I'm sure I'm speaking from for her,

1330
01:21:15,841 --> 01:21:19,710
but she doesn't have a microphone actually
prefers to stay in the background to

1331
01:21:19,711 --> 01:21:22,260
some degree for various reasons.
Um,

1332
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:27,960
she's very suited to a life like this.
She's quite stable emotionally,

1333
01:21:28,110 --> 01:21:33,000
so she, she doesn't suffer from a
lot of anxiety. She likes to travel.

1334
01:21:33,290 --> 01:21:37,660
Um,
she likes meeting New People,

1335
01:21:37,661 --> 01:21:41,530
she likes the adventure and
she's supporting what I'm doing.

1336
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:46,000
And so that's working
and thank God for that.

1337
01:21:46,001 --> 01:21:50,050
And then she also keeps an eye on
what I'm doing and lets me know

1338
01:21:51,610 --> 01:21:56,110
when it's going well and when she thinks
it needs improvement and, and, and,

1339
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,680
and she helps me figure
out where I'm going next.

1340
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:05,220
Because for the last two years my schedule
has been so busy that I don't know

1341
01:22:05,351 --> 01:22:10,060
what I'm doing next, usually maybe
the next day. And so her job,

1342
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:12,370
because we've also parceled out jobs,

1343
01:22:12,371 --> 01:22:17,371
is to make sure that I get wherever
I'm going next on time and ready.

1344
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,950
And so far that's brought,

1345
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:24,550
I would say in Calkin bull
benefits fundamentally. And,

1346
01:22:24,820 --> 01:22:29,350
and because we agreed on it,
we had our little constitution in place,

1347
01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:34,590
we were able to handle the stress because
I think we've been in a hundred and

1348
01:22:35,830 --> 01:22:39,760
it's damn near 150 cities in 350 days.

1349
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:43,600
And so it's very heavy traveling schedule.

1350
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:48,370
But Andy,
the other thing too is I trust her.

1351
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:52,780
She tells me the truth.
It isn't necessarily what I want to hear.

1352
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:54,580
Well you can tell that's the truth,
man.

1353
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:56,770
That's what you don't
necessarily want to hear.

1354
01:22:57,220 --> 01:22:59,110
But so she's a very good counselor.

1355
01:22:59,650 --> 01:23:04,630
And that's turned out to be
exceptionally helpful. So,

1356
01:23:06,350 --> 01:23:08,710
yeah. And I'm like their
son who refuses to leave.

1357
01:23:08,930 --> 01:23:13,760
Yeah, I like it, Ma. Yeah. Really Nice.

1358
01:23:14,550 --> 01:23:15,080
That's all right.

1359
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:17,300
I think we ought to give
Tammy a round of applause.

1360
01:23:17,540 --> 01:23:22,540
[inaudible]

1361
01:23:29,390 --> 01:23:33,280
Dave, I think one for you comes
from Monica Wilkie. Uh Oh.

1362
01:23:33,281 --> 01:23:34,940
It's about dealing with difference.

1363
01:23:35,430 --> 01:23:39,430
Thank you John. Uh, Dave, I wanted to ask,

1364
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:44,870
is it possible to come to a resolution
with someone who has different values to

1365
01:23:45,571 --> 01:23:50,400
you? So for example, if I have
free speech is my highest value,

1366
01:23:50,730 --> 01:23:54,840
and I'm talking to someone who believes
that diversity and equality is a higher

1367
01:23:54,841 --> 01:23:59,580
value and therefore free speech should
be quelled in order to achieve this.

1368
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:02,460
Is it possible to reconcile
these differences?

1369
01:24:02,990 --> 01:24:06,040
I think it is the best
example that I can give you a,

1370
01:24:06,050 --> 01:24:07,460
and I'm sure some of you have seen this,

1371
01:24:07,461 --> 01:24:10,400
I've had a couple interviews
and debates with Ben Shapiro.

1372
01:24:10,401 --> 01:24:11,960
Now Ben is an Orthodox Jew.

1373
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:15,260
He does not believe that gay
people should be married. He, well,

1374
01:24:15,261 --> 01:24:19,460
he believes that being gay is a sin
is the loose word for it. Right.

1375
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:22,580
Um, now Ben, my studio is in my home.

1376
01:24:22,610 --> 01:24:25,190
I live with my partner
and my home obviously. Uh,

1377
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:29,660
Ben and I were friends to, uh, to a
certain point, you know what I mean?

1378
01:24:29,661 --> 01:24:34,070
Like you've got like your best friend in
life who knows you the way your husband

1379
01:24:34,071 --> 01:24:36,290
or wife or partner knows you.
And then,

1380
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:40,280
and then you have sort of other
tiers of friends. Ben will never,

1381
01:24:40,281 --> 01:24:43,880
as long as we have this
disconnect, there's, you know,

1382
01:24:44,630 --> 01:24:47,170
last time I had them on when we
discussed this, he said that, you know,

1383
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:52,190
it caught fire on the Internet. He said
he wouldn't bake me a gay wedding cake.

1384
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:52,760
Right?

1385
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:56,510
Or even come to an anniversary party
because it would be celebrating something

1386
01:24:56,511 --> 01:25:00,500
that he doesn't believe in. And I remember
when we were having the discussion,

1387
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:03,320
I thought, all right, well here's
a really interesting moment.

1388
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:08,190
I can now berate him and I can
demand that he acquiesce and,

1389
01:25:08,300 --> 01:25:13,300
and put aside whatever his beliefs are
so that he will believe what I want him

1390
01:25:13,761 --> 01:25:16,070
to believe, even if I think it
is the right thing. I mean, I,

1391
01:25:16,370 --> 01:25:20,540
I think I'm a good person. I'm doing
what I'm just doing my life as I see fit,

1392
01:25:20,541 --> 01:25:23,780
right? Ben Sees the world differently. Um,

1393
01:25:24,110 --> 01:25:27,050
so can we ever truly get through that?

1394
01:25:27,051 --> 01:25:31,250
I would say yes because what we agreed
to for what we were agreeing to disagree

1395
01:25:31,251 --> 01:25:35,840
on, what we agreed to agree on was that
it's not the role of the government to

1396
01:25:35,841 --> 01:25:37,430
decide who can get married.

1397
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:40,640
Now he's less thrilled with that than
I am because I think that's a perfectly

1398
01:25:40,641 --> 01:25:43,940
fine position to take.
He, he, you know this,

1399
01:25:43,941 --> 01:25:45,920
you see this a lot with
conservatives now where they,

1400
01:25:45,921 --> 01:25:49,640
when you ask them about gay marriage,
they'll take the libertarian position.

1401
01:25:49,641 --> 01:25:51,890
They weren't taking it five years ago,
but they suddenly,

1402
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:55,040
now that they realize it's the law of
the land in the United States and it's

1403
01:25:55,041 --> 01:25:56,930
just the easy way out.
It's like, well, you know,

1404
01:25:56,931 --> 01:26:00,540
I don't really care about gay marriage.
It's anyone can get into any, uh,

1405
01:26:00,650 --> 01:26:04,550
contract that they want to. It's
the easy way out. I don't, uh,

1406
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:07,660
letting them slide on that
because we're equal. We're we,

1407
01:26:07,661 --> 01:26:11,570
we made it so it's okay now.
So I don't know that you can ever,

1408
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:12,940
okay,

1409
01:26:12,940 --> 01:26:13,600
well let's put it this way.

1410
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:18,600
I think there are issues that you will
have existential profound differences

1411
01:26:20,141 --> 01:26:22,870
with people that you will
not be able to get over.

1412
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:25,540
But that doesn't mean you have
to cut them out of your life.

1413
01:26:25,570 --> 01:26:29,440
And as I said to Ben last time we talked
about this, I hope that, you know,

1414
01:26:29,441 --> 01:26:33,460
we'll remain friends to whatever
degree our friendship is for the next,

1415
01:26:33,550 --> 01:26:37,410
let's say 50 years. And I'm a little
older than him, but when I'm, you know,

1416
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:41,980
92 and he's 37 or whatever
it is, or 37, sorry, what?

1417
01:26:41,981 --> 01:26:45,100
He's a 87. Math was not my thing. Um,

1418
01:26:45,250 --> 01:26:48,220
but when I'm 92 and he's 87,
um,

1419
01:26:48,700 --> 01:26:52,060
that may be the long game would have
worked here and he'll look back and go,

1420
01:26:52,690 --> 01:26:57,130
you know, Dave, you probably were right.
I suspect I will get him on this one.

1421
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:00,220
So I would say just generally try to be,

1422
01:27:01,570 --> 01:27:04,750
try to be as tolerant as the
other people say they are.

1423
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:07,870
They're not really that good at it.
They just talk about it a lot.

1424
01:27:07,871 --> 01:27:12,160
But if you actually try to do that and
realize that the world is not designed to

1425
01:27:12,161 --> 01:27:15,590
bow to you and that you can show
people you're a little bit better. I'm,

1426
01:27:15,591 --> 01:27:19,060
I just am a firm believer that that is
what will ultimately get there. But no,

1427
01:27:19,090 --> 01:27:21,100
you can't get everyone right there.

1428
01:27:21,101 --> 01:27:23,920
And it's for you to judge what
relationship do you want to be in.

1429
01:27:25,170 --> 01:27:25,920
Yeah.

1430
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:28,080
Thank you.
I think to bring it home then a question,

1431
01:27:28,081 --> 01:27:30,900
and I think very important than probably
troubling or goes to the heart of

1432
01:27:30,901 --> 01:27:31,860
something that's troubling.

1433
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:37,640
A lot of people now a Rochelle
on the men in the me to era.

1434
01:27:39,540 --> 01:27:43,440
I know it will bring it home
at that point, but Rochelle
was, Rachelle. Hey Roger.

1435
01:27:43,450 --> 01:27:44,283
Yeah,

1436
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:46,960
I just wanted to be clear. I've never
had a me too and sit in with the woman.

1437
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:50,940
Really good. I like that one. Yeah.

1438
01:27:51,130 --> 01:27:52,000
Yes, it is. First of all,

1439
01:27:52,001 --> 01:27:55,030
thank you very much for being
here and helping us to wake up.

1440
01:27:55,031 --> 01:27:59,890
I really appreciate it. So my question
is, as a redeemed progressive, uh,

1441
01:27:59,950 --> 01:28:04,840
what is the key to empowering men in
the me too age while maintaining healthy

1442
01:28:04,841 --> 01:28:07,720
boundaries and strong
behavioral expectations?

1443
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:12,340
Well, as the redeemed
progressive is that he said, um,

1444
01:28:13,050 --> 01:28:16,200
well no one's born guilty.
No one's born guilty.

1445
01:28:16,201 --> 01:28:19,950
If you haven't raped anybody and you have
been accosted anybody and you haven't,

1446
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:24,240
you know, done anything untoward, then
you have nothing to be guilty about it.

1447
01:28:24,241 --> 01:28:26,820
I mean, this is the consistent
theme that we've talked about here,

1448
01:28:26,821 --> 01:28:30,570
about why you should judge people as
an individual and not as a collective,

1449
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:35,610
but they've created a situation now
where people are now being born with

1450
01:28:35,611 --> 01:28:39,600
original sin. Oh, you're a white
heterosexual, usually Christian male.

1451
01:28:39,610 --> 01:28:42,930
You are the worst thing that
exists and that not, I mean,

1452
01:28:42,931 --> 01:28:46,170
it's the essence of bigotry. It's your
prejudging, right? So that's prejudice.

1453
01:28:46,290 --> 01:28:49,320
You're looking at someone
and you're prejudging them
and you think that you know,

1454
01:28:49,321 --> 01:28:53,580
everything that there, uh, not
only about, but capable of. Um,

1455
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:59,210
so I would say the further we can
get away from that, how do you,

1456
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:02,490
how do you negotiate those relationships
while if you've done something bad?

1457
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:04,440
It's on you. I mean, Jordan
addressed this already.

1458
01:29:04,620 --> 01:29:08,760
It's on you to figure out how to
make penance for that, I suppose.

1459
01:29:09,090 --> 01:29:12,300
But if you haven't done anything and most
people haven't, that's why this thing,

1460
01:29:12,490 --> 01:29:16,270
this idea, believe all women.
That's well that was like saying,

1461
01:29:16,271 --> 01:29:19,980
believe all men believe all midgets
believe all, I mean, it just doesn't, not,

1462
01:29:20,610 --> 01:29:23,320
not midgets. Now you're going to get
us in trouble. Yeah, for sure. Uh,

1463
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:27,390
seeing you just walked into it. Yeah,
you did it to yourself this time. Um,

1464
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,700
but it may,
I mean really we call little people.

1465
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:33,480
Middle people believe all little
people. Um, but, but really,

1466
01:29:33,481 --> 01:29:35,970
I mean if you could just take the
reverse, they say, believe all women,

1467
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:39,340
well now just do the other way or believe
all men. Does that sound right? You?

1468
01:29:39,420 --> 01:29:41,940
Of course you shouldn't believe all men
and you shouldn't believe all women.

1469
01:29:42,150 --> 01:29:45,630
And by the way, every time that this
happens with one of these people saying,

1470
01:29:45,631 --> 01:29:48,720
believe all women,
then the accusation gets turned on them.

1471
01:29:48,721 --> 01:29:51,870
Like our governor Gavin
Newsome in California,

1472
01:29:52,050 --> 01:29:55,110
or when it happened with Cory
booker or a series of these guys,

1473
01:29:55,111 --> 01:29:58,160
and then suddenly they go,
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, wait for
evidence when it was Kevin. Ah,

1474
01:29:58,161 --> 01:30:01,650
no, believe all women. So it's
a, it's a just a ridiculous,

1475
01:30:01,651 --> 01:30:04,260
untenable way of holding a position.

1476
01:30:04,530 --> 01:30:06,660
And if you're not guilty of something,

1477
01:30:06,661 --> 01:30:09,660
I mean that the fact that this is
happening to young people in the West,

1478
01:30:09,661 --> 01:30:11,580
especially in it,
especially young white men,

1479
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:16,110
that they're walking around feeling
like they've done something when they've

1480
01:30:16,111 --> 01:30:18,300
done nothing. Uh, what a,

1481
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:23,720
what a recipe for a disaster and the
type of totalitarian society that we've

1482
01:30:24,211 --> 01:30:25,140
been talking about up here.

1483
01:30:26,470 --> 01:30:30,930
Yeah. It's also reflective of a, of
a technical problem. I would say.

1484
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:32,543
Um,

1485
01:30:32,850 --> 01:30:37,850
we've had relatively reliable
birth control since 1960.

1486
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:41,910
Okay.
That's not very long.

1487
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:48,050
And we underestimate the unbelievable
technological triumph of birth control.

1488
01:30:55,710 --> 01:30:59,640
It's, it's the hydrogen
bomb. It's the transistor.

1489
01:30:59,670 --> 01:31:04,670
Like it's a major league
transformation in human interaction.

1490
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:09,720
Women are now free from
involuntary Ruppert reproduction.

1491
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:13,890
That's never been the case in the
entire history of the planet. Okay.

1492
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:17,910
We don't know exactly what
to do about that. Okay.

1493
01:31:17,911 --> 01:31:20,910
So the first idea in the 60s was,
hell,

1494
01:31:21,660 --> 01:31:23,430
let's party.
And you know,

1495
01:31:23,431 --> 01:31:28,431
you could see why it's like what the
rules for not engaging in promiscuous

1496
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:34,620
sexual intercourse
seemed to have vanished.

1497
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:39,960
So we had a couple of decades
of experimentation. It's like,

1498
01:31:39,961 --> 01:31:41,610
well,
how'd that go?

1499
01:31:45,220 --> 01:31:49,980
Little hard on the family.
I would say that's not so good for kids.

1500
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:55,860
AIDS that wasn't a plus,
could've killed us all.

1501
01:31:56,310 --> 01:32:00,220
And it mutated particularly to
take advantage, promiscuous sex,

1502
01:32:00,221 --> 01:32:02,410
because viruses are very tricky things.

1503
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:07,540
So it turns out that sex is a little
bit more complicated than we thought.

1504
01:32:07,541 --> 01:32:11,620
Well, it actually turns out that it's a
lot more complicated than we think. Okay.

1505
01:32:11,621 --> 01:32:16,621
And now it's four 50 60 years later
and we're trying to sort this out.

1506
01:32:16,811 --> 01:32:21,640
It's like, well, when is it
okay to have sex? Exactly.

1507
01:32:22,210 --> 01:32:24,310
And when is it not okay to have sex?

1508
01:32:24,460 --> 01:32:29,460
And what does it mean that it's okay and
what is consent me and answer to that

1509
01:32:29,561 --> 01:32:31,300
is,
well,

1510
01:32:31,301 --> 01:32:34,870
we never used to have to think these
things through because the rule was don't

1511
01:32:34,871 --> 01:32:39,610
have sex until you get married. That was
the rule. Now that isn't the rule. Okay,

1512
01:32:39,611 --> 01:32:43,750
so what's the rule? Well, we're not
having a conversation about the rule.

1513
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:47,980
We're waiting until someone does something
that seems like it might be untoward

1514
01:32:48,070 --> 01:32:52,570
and then mobbing them and
trying to extract the rule
out that way and it's not a

1515
01:32:52,571 --> 01:32:56,890
very effective way of doing it. You
know, you want to decrease campus rape,

1516
01:32:56,950 --> 01:32:59,680
that's easy.
Get rid of alcohol.

1517
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:04,510
No one has that conversation.
It's like I did my phd work on alcohol.

1518
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:09,840
50% of the people who are murdered are
drunk and 50% of the people who kill them

1519
01:33:11,110 --> 01:33:16,110
are drunk and almost all of the date rape
situations are consequences of access

1520
01:33:17,921 --> 01:33:18,850
intoxication,

1521
01:33:19,090 --> 01:33:23,470
but yet there's a party culture
on campuses and anything goes.

1522
01:33:23,620 --> 01:33:27,520
And you also have this strange thing,
especially on the radical left, which is,

1523
01:33:27,550 --> 01:33:30,460
which is unbelievably paradoxical,

1524
01:33:30,461 --> 01:33:35,461
were absolutely every form of sexual
expression imaginable is 100% permissible

1525
01:33:38,530 --> 01:33:40,000
because sex is fine,

1526
01:33:40,450 --> 01:33:45,130
but it's so dangerous that while you're
dancing with someone at a Princeton

1527
01:33:45,131 --> 01:33:45,964
mixer,

1528
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:50,320
you have to ask them two or three
times if it's okay for you to continue.

1529
01:33:51,020 --> 01:33:54,220
And, and that's, that's actually the
case by the way. I'm not making that up.

1530
01:33:54,470 --> 01:33:58,480
It's like, well, both of those things
can't be true. Now what's happening,

1531
01:33:58,481 --> 01:34:03,280
I think on the me too end of things and
the affirmative consent end of things is

1532
01:34:03,281 --> 01:34:08,281
the old sexual taboos are reasserting
themselves the idea that we can extract

1533
01:34:10,751 --> 01:34:15,751
sex out from emotional intimacy
and especially emotional intimacy.

1534
01:34:16,481 --> 01:34:21,481
I would say psychological intimacy maybe
even from longterm relationship is,

1535
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:25,750
I don't believe it's a tenable idea.
I don't think we can do it.

1536
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:30,640
And a lot of what we're seeing is the
backlash against that. It's like, well,

1537
01:34:30,641 --> 01:34:32,200
I feel used,
you know,

1538
01:34:32,201 --> 01:34:36,700
because one of the things that's happening
on the really radical end of the anti,

1539
01:34:37,030 --> 01:34:39,760
uh, sexual abuse movement
is the idea that, well,

1540
01:34:39,761 --> 01:34:44,410
if you have intercourse with someone
and then you regret it the next day,

1541
01:34:44,950 --> 01:34:48,220
that's evidence that it wasn't consensual.
Well,

1542
01:34:50,170 --> 01:34:54,310
it is in the sense evidence that it wasn't
consensual because it's evidence that

1543
01:34:54,311 --> 01:34:58,400
you didn't bloody well think it through,
right. It was good for last night,

1544
01:34:58,401 --> 01:35:02,030
but it's not good for today. It's
not very wise. The question is what?

1545
01:35:02,031 --> 01:35:03,650
What constitutes consent?

1546
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:07,490
And we need to have a very
serious conversation about that.

1547
01:35:07,491 --> 01:35:12,491
Like under what circumstances is
it acceptable to give consent,

1548
01:35:14,060 --> 01:35:18,050
but we're not mature enough to have
that conversation. We want it both ways.

1549
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:21,950
We want to be able to do whatever
we want with ever, with what,

1550
01:35:21,951 --> 01:35:24,590
with whoever we want,
whenever we want,

1551
01:35:24,770 --> 01:35:28,550
with no consequences and we want,

1552
01:35:28,730 --> 01:35:33,710
they're never to be any trouble
about consent. It's like, well, no,

1553
01:35:33,830 --> 01:35:34,970
that's not going to happen.

1554
01:35:35,420 --> 01:35:40,070
I don't think that sex works very well
outside of committed relationships.

1555
01:35:40,580 --> 01:35:42,560
I don't think there's any
evidence that it does.

1556
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:47,590
There's a strong proclivity
across cultures for,

1557
01:35:47,690 --> 01:35:49,640
for the enforcement,

1558
01:35:49,790 --> 01:35:53,060
social enforcement of longterm monogamy.

1559
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:55,280
And there's reasons for that.

1560
01:35:55,490 --> 01:35:59,000
And I think you deviate
from that at your peril.

1561
01:35:59,810 --> 01:36:02,210
So now if you,
if you want to deviate from that,

1562
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:04,400
there's all sorts of reasons to do it on,

1563
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:08,030
and I can understand why
people are interested in an
adventure and all of that.

1564
01:36:08,150 --> 01:36:12,470
But you know,
my sense also as a clinician is you don't,

1565
01:36:13,160 --> 01:36:17,030
you only really get to try out
about five people in your life.

1566
01:36:17,870 --> 01:36:20,840
You have to make a decision
pretty damn quick, you know,

1567
01:36:20,841 --> 01:36:25,790
like between 20 and 30 there's a lot of
things to get straight and longterm mate

1568
01:36:25,791 --> 01:36:26,750
is usually one of them.

1569
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:31,960
And most of the time people should be
more careful with their sexual behavior

1570
01:36:33,860 --> 01:36:37,790
when they're young, specially
when they're drunk. Then they are.

1571
01:36:38,570 --> 01:36:39,590
And I think it,

1572
01:36:39,591 --> 01:36:44,591
I just think it's so interesting that
all of the taboo reconstruction is coming

1573
01:36:46,730 --> 01:36:49,820
from the radical left.
It's not what you'd expect at all.

1574
01:36:49,850 --> 01:36:53,240
You'd think it'd be the damn right wing
Christians complaining about, you know,

1575
01:36:53,241 --> 01:36:57,640
sexual immorality. It's like, no, it's
the radical lefties. You know. You,

1576
01:36:57,641 --> 01:37:01,760
you have to have signed consent before
making any physical move. And then that's,

1577
01:37:01,761 --> 01:37:06,080
so what really, who thought
that up? That's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

1578
01:37:06,081 --> 01:37:08,210
You know how awkward that would be?

1579
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:12,290
You know you're supposed to be able to
do a little bit of nonverbal reading,

1580
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:15,220
right? I mean that's part of
romance. You don't see in it.

1581
01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:20,380
You ever see a movie where the two people
who are dating exchange consent notes

1582
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:24,020
like that doesn't happen.
So it's an unrealistic solution.

1583
01:37:24,330 --> 01:37:29,330
But I think the real solution is that
despite the fact that we have reliable

1584
01:37:30,831 --> 01:37:31,670
birth control,

1585
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:37,360
we're going to have to relearn what the
acceptable rules of propriety are with

1586
01:37:38,601 --> 01:37:40,220
regards to sexual relationships.

1587
01:37:40,370 --> 01:37:45,370
One of the things I often tell my young
clients is don't do anything physically

1588
01:37:46,311 --> 01:37:50,960
with anyone that you would talk to
them about because if you're too damn

1589
01:37:50,961 --> 01:37:55,040
embarrassed to talk about it,
well maybe it's a little premature.

1590
01:37:55,140 --> 01:37:55,980
The relationship

1591
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:59,280
to actually do it and then
there's harm in it. You know,

1592
01:37:59,281 --> 01:38:02,130
there's emotional harm in
it for on both parties.

1593
01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:05,280
There's the cheapening of both parties so

1594
01:38:08,270 --> 01:38:10,940
well, so it's going to take us
a long time to sort this out,

1595
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:15,920
but hopefully we can do it in a serious
manner and it won't be merely a matter

1596
01:38:15,921 --> 01:38:20,700
of mobbing. Those who seem to
have made an error so well,

1597
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:25,160
Jordan and dive, you've given us
unbelievably generously of your insights,

1598
01:38:25,610 --> 01:38:29,630
of your ideas, of your
experience, of your wisdom,

1599
01:38:29,870 --> 01:38:34,580
and you've done it with immense warmth
and humanity. I can't thank you enough,

1600
01:38:35,210 --> 01:38:38,630
and I think all of these good
Australians would in would agree with me.

1601
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:44,360
[inaudible]

1602
01:39:09,860 --> 01:39:09,930
okay.
