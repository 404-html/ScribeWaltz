1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,423
Bark is hard to listen to,
you have to listen to his pieces over 

2
00:00:04,981 --> 00:00:05,940
and over.
At least I do.

3
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:08,130
I don't suppose you have to if you're a 
musical genius,

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,750
but because goal interpreted them 
personally,

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:13,673
it was easier to take the music apart 
and understand in an auditory way what 

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,433
Bach was trying to do.
Music helps demonstrate the reality of 

7
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:24,390
meaning and it does that for everyone 
that does that.

8
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:26,970
For people who are deeply atheistic or 
even nihilistic,

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,253
and that's interesting too because you 
can take bitterly disaffected punk 

10
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:32,184
rockers and they listen to music and 
they're overwhelmed by a sense of it's 

11
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:38,940
really a sense of religious meaning they
don't even notice it except that without

12
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:42,510
it they'd be in trouble.
Some people who are low in openness,

13
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:43,344
which is a psychological trait and 
they're pretty opaque to what art 

14
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,423
represents and so they have a hard time 
with it or maybe they need more less 

15
00:00:51,841 --> 00:00:53,010
sophisticated art.

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,840
It's too shocking to them if it's 
sophisticated in and profound,

17
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:58,703
they can't handle it.
Lots of people are terrified by art and 

18
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,540
they like things.
They like music.

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,080
They like catch because if it's real,
it's too much for them.

20
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,190
They're terrified of it.
They'll say,

21
00:01:11,191 --> 00:01:12,220
I don't like that.
It's like,

22
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,060
isn't that they don't like it.
It's that they can't handle it.

23
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,220
They're afraid of people are even afraid
of color.

24
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,220
You know?
That's why everybody uses Bayesian.

25
00:01:20,221 --> 00:01:22,840
They're decorating and creams,
you know,

26
00:01:22,841 --> 00:01:23,674
they're terrified of color,
so people are terrified of deep truths 

27
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,103
and wonder so they.
They wouldn't be deep if they weren't 

28
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:33,360
terrifying.
When we look at the world,

29
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:38,361
we see objects,
handleable and usable objects in motion,

30
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,910
but that isn't really what the world is 
like.

31
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:46,911
What the world is like is a set of 
interlocking and interconnected patterns

32
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,073
at multiple levels of resolution from 
the tiniest to the largest all playing 

33
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:56,550
together in a patterned and somewhat 
predictable manner,

34
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,460
not completely predictable,
like music isn't completely predictable,

35
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,623
and so the reason that music is 
meaningful when you listen to it is 

36
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:03,204
because music demonstrates to you what 
the structure of the university is 

37
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:08,900
actually like and your senses.

38
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,360
Your visual sense blinds you to that 
because it's more practical in a way.

39
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,240
It shows you what you need to live right
now,

40
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,373
whereas music gives you this sculptural 
picture of quantized patterns 

41
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,160
interacting at multiple levels of 
analysis simultaneously,

42
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,610
and that infuses people with a sense of 
meaning are truly artistic.

43
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:34,611
Production is full of inarticulate,
meaning it's inarticulate because it's.

44
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,753
It's.
It's still in the developmental stage 

45
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:41,454
before articulate knowledge and so it 
grips people with a sense of 

46
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,414
significance,
but they can't necessarily say why and 

47
00:02:48,361 --> 00:02:49,194
the reason they can't say yes because 
the why for that kind of meaning hasn't 

48
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:55,290
been explicated yet.
The reason that art

49
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,740
is meaningful to people is because art 
is meaningful.

50
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,143
It's full of the next set of ideas.
That's one way of looking about it or 

51
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:06,814
it's or it's full of eternal ideas that 
people still haven't fully comprehended 

52
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,580
and so you can't help but be gripped by 
it.
