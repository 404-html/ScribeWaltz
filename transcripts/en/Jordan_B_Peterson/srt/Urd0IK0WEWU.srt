1
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,020
[inaudible].

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,100
Yeah.
We wanted to start off this boy though.

3
00:00:08,101 --> 00:00:11,760
You introducing yourself a little bit,
telling us about your general work,

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,653
particularly,
you've talked a lot about faculty 

5
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:14,934
freedom recently and I'm wondering if 
you think you want to talk a little bit 

6
00:00:17,161 --> 00:00:17,994
about what you see as the ideal 
relationship between a university and 

7
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:22,500
its faculty members?

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:24,973
Yeah,

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:25,893
I think in many ways the best thing for 
the university to do with its faculty 

10
00:00:30,011 --> 00:00:30,844
members is to leave them alone.
And I mean that in the best possible 

11
00:00:34,511 --> 00:00:35,344
way.
I mean that was actually one of the 

12
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:39,340
things I taught here from 93 to 98 and 
one of the things,

13
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,710
and,
and I have the same relationship I would

14
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:43,570
say with the university at the 
University of Toronto,

15
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:49,170
is that the universities go to a 
tremendous amount of trouble to identify

16
00:00:49,511 --> 00:00:50,344
promising people in,
in terms of their research capability 

17
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:55,660
from all over the world.
And generally speaking,

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:56,853
if you identify promising people your 
best bet as a manager is to stay out of 

19
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:05,020
their way now and to remove obstacles 
from their,

20
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:07,210
from their,
from their movement forward.

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,230
And I think that the universities do a 
credible job of that.

22
00:01:11,231 --> 00:01:13,350
Although my sense,
uh,

23
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,273
over the last few decades has been that 
increasingly there are more impediments 

24
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,740
placed in the path of,
of research.

25
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,573
For example,
I've seen that with the multiplication 

26
00:01:23,561 --> 00:01:25,870
of the powers of,
of institutional review boards,

27
00:01:25,871 --> 00:01:27,370
for example,
ethics committees,

28
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,700
which have vastly overreached there.
They're there,

29
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,910
they're reasonable powers and they slow 
things down.

30
00:01:33,911 --> 00:01:36,640
And that's a big mistake.
If you're dealing with people who are,

31
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,220
are conducting research into important 
topics,

32
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,430
then you want to do everything you 
possibly can to let them move forward as

33
00:01:42,431 --> 00:01:43,264
rapidly as possible.
In what ways do you think these 

34
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:45,754
institutional review boards or these 
ethics committees had particularly 

35
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:52,720
damage the process where the speed of 
research research?

36
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:54,310
Do you think there are times,
like,

37
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:55,144
do you have any examples in mind of when
you think they've overreached their 

38
00:01:57,101 --> 00:01:58,300
power?
Well,

39
00:01:58,301 --> 00:02:01,330
the rate they regulate think your mind 
for

40
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,970
I gotta ask him.
That one's not on yet.

41
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,990
Okay.
Well let's find it.

42
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,043
Okay,
awesome.

43
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,230
That's better.
Okay.

44
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:18,881
Oh,
you can hear me.

45
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:20,980
Which at least in principle should be an
improvement.

46
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,520
Yeah.
Well,

47
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,291
I mean,
Oh yes,

48
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:28,710
that's much better.
Yeah.

49
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,921
No.
It in,

50
00:02:29,921 --> 00:02:31,570
in the social sciences,
for example,

51
00:02:31,571 --> 00:02:35,530
the institutional review boards insist 
upon reviewing the use of questionnaires

52
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,050
in research,
which I think is,

53
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:39,430
is it's,
it's not helpful.

54
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,260
Hmm.
Questionnaires aren't dangerous and they

55
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,094
have no real policies set in place to 
determine the difference between 

56
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:45,723
dangerous research and the normal 
dangerous that people expose them to 

57
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,470
cells on to,
on a daily basis.

58
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,930
So,
um,

59
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,073
and they've certainly,
the institutional review boards have 

60
00:02:54,731 --> 00:02:56,980
certainly slow down the work in my lab,
for example,

61
00:02:56,981 --> 00:02:57,814
and made it much more onerous.
We have to do a tremendous amount of 

62
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:00,964
writing and justification for this 
study's long before they're even 

63
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:03,664
undertaken.
And then also to do a fair bit of 

64
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:07,180
paperwork to keep up with the 
documentation.

65
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,370
And I don't find that the least bit 
useful.

66
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:10,204
And I know that in the United States,
the institutional review boards domains 

67
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:16,480
of power being cut back now because of 
complaints,

68
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,160
primarily,
if I remember correctly,

69
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:18,994
primary from the,
primarily from the granting agencies 

70
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,753
because they're adding to the 
unnecessary expense that's associated 

71
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:25,834
with research.
So in the university should the 

72
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:29,914
university administration fundamentally 
exists to serve the faculty and the 

73
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:33,874
students,
and probably the students first and the 

74
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:36,094
faculty second.
But increasingly I see that the 

75
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:42,400
administration is,
is multiplying out of control and,

76
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,600
and that's quite well documented in 
terms of overall cost and some of that's

77
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,720
driven by legislation.
And so it's not,

78
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,260
it's not something that's necessarily 
intrinsic to the administration itself,

79
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,140
but that's one of the things that's 
driving the spiraling up ever,

80
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:01,380
ever upward spiring of tuition costs.
So aside from research ethics boards,

81
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:05,560
Institutional Review Boards,
ethics committees,

82
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,023
do you think that there are other ways 
that the administration has interfered 

83
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:10,420
with your work,
particularly?

84
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,733
You've recently come under fire by some 
administration at the University of 

85
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,190
Toronto for certain controversial views 
you hold.

86
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,263
You mentioned that you think the 
administration's primary obligation 

87
00:04:21,981 --> 00:04:25,570
should be to its students and then it 
should also serve as faculty.

88
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,733
Do you see the administration using that
mission properly when they try to talk 

89
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:33,760
to faculty about certain statements that
they've made,

90
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,950
or do you think that's also an overreach
of their power?

91
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,683
Well,
I think it reflects a more general 

92
00:04:39,131 --> 00:04:42,700
societal confusion about just exactly 
what our priorities are.

93
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:43,923
I made a video back in September stating
my objections to the mandated use of a 

94
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:50,614
certain category of Pronoun that I 
object to mostly on the grounds that I 

95
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:55,534
felt that the government had no right 
compelling people's speech and also 

96
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:03,520
because personally I didn't want to use 
the pronouns that were being put forward

97
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:08,521
by people I regard as holding up 
philosophical and political ethos that I

98
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,560
find really quite detestable.

99
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:12,893
And I made a video about that and 
mentioned during the video that the act 

100
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:17,074
of making the video had probably become,
had arguably become illegal and Ontario 

101
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,873
in the province I'm from and was about 
to become illegal federally with some 

102
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:27,790
new legislation and that it likely 
violated the,

103
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,830
the code of conduct that,
that,

104
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,000
that characterize the university with 
regards to its inclusiveness policies.

105
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,170
University promptly validated my 
concerns by sending me two letters,

106
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,004
telling me to stop making such 
statements because they violated the 

107
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:46,390
university's code of conduct and also 
the relevant human rights legislation in

108
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:49,840
Ontario and in the federal government.
And one of the,

109
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:50,883
I felt that the reason that the 
university did that was because they 

110
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,263
faced a certain amount of public 
pressure from people at the University 

111
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,660
of Toronto.
And that would be mostly,

112
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,553
most of that pressure came from people I
would regard as the professional 

113
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:04,130
activist types.

114
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,473
And the university said that they hadn't
received many letters accusing me of 

115
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:11,540
making the University of Toronto an 
unsafe space,

116
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:12,374
which is the sort of language that 
immediately makes you know that you're 

117
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,490
dealing with people who are 
ideologically possessed.

118
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,750
But they also,
but they failed to note at the same time

119
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:21,584
that they had received hundreds,
perhaps thousands of letters as well as 

120
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:27,440
a 10,000 signature petition supporting 
my stance.

121
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:31,460
And so I think when the administration,
uh,

122
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,773
when,
when the administration regarding it's 

123
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:34,724
duty,
it's fundamental duty to promote some 

124
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:37,904
illusory notion of safety and then also 
is willing to falsify the facts on the 

125
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:45,500
ground by omission that definitely 
overstepped their boundaries.

126
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:47,060
And I would say that,
uh,

127
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,490
they were,
they were put back,

128
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,090
they were set back on their heels,
let's put it that way,

129
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,780
by a very,
uh,

130
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,590
strident outpouring,
strident,

131
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,350
powerful outpouring of public opinion in
Canada.

132
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,183
And that was all the,
that was good for me because I got two 

133
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:03,974
letters.
And generally if you're dealing with 

134
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:06,224
human resources professionals,
then three letters is the warning and 

135
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:11,240
then the next step is something more 
serious.

136
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,550
I'm curious,
and you mentioned the term safe space in

137
00:07:13,551 --> 00:07:16,790
particular for a university,
and I want you to link this back to this

138
00:07:16,791 --> 00:07:17,624
idea that university administration 
should be serving students first and 

139
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:21,914
faculty second.
So do you think that the administration 

140
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:28,280
has some sort of compelling mandate to 
make sure that students feel safe?

141
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:28,910
No,
they haven't.

142
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,743
They have exactly the reverse mandate.
There's nothing safe about being 

143
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:34,340
educated.
If you want to be safe,

144
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:35,174
stay home,
the things that you need to be educated 

145
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:39,440
about our terrible things.
Almost always,

146
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,510
if you study history properly,
it's terrible.

147
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:43,550
If you study literature properly,
it's terrible.

148
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:44,384
If you study psychology properly,
all of these fields of endeavor teach 

149
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:48,404
you the painful things that you need to 
know to understand what human beings in 

150
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:51,590
society or like.

151
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,660
And so the idea,
first of all,

152
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,990
the idea that universities should be a 
safe space is absolutely preposterous,

153
00:07:56,991 --> 00:07:59,840
but it's also preposterous for more,
more,

154
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,780
I would say immediate reasons.
So one of the,

155
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:03,823
one of the,
there's a few things that we know is as 

156
00:08:05,811 --> 00:08:07,700
clinical psychologists,
uh,

157
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,563
as,
as a field and also as practitioners 

158
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:12,380
with regards to how to treat people who 
suffer,

159
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:13,214
let's say from an excess of anxiety.
And what you do with people who suffer 

160
00:08:16,911 --> 00:08:17,744
from an excess of anxiety is expose them
to the very things that they're afraid 

161
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:22,970
of or sometimes disgusted by.
And you,

162
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,180
you help them voluntarily expose 
themselves to such things.

163
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,110
And that doesn't make the world safer.
It makes them braver and more competent.

164
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,530
And so the,
the notion that you serve students,

165
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,060
uh,
safety concerns,

166
00:08:35,061 --> 00:08:38,240
even by shielding them from things that 
they don't wish to encounter.

167
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,500
There's,
there's absolutely,

168
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,423
I can't think of a single possible,
a valid reason why you would ever 

169
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:45,584
undertake such an endeavor.
I think it's really neat to talk about 

170
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:52,010
it in the abstract,
but that particular concern that perhaps

171
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:56,280
a lot of students and a lot of members 
of the community have with your case

172
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,450
is the particular pronoun usage issue.
So in that instance,

173
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,600
I'm wondering if you think there's a 
real harm.

174
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,090
So if someone comes to you,
one of your students let's say,

175
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,930
and would really feel more comfortable 
engaging with the deep,

176
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:14,160
troubling historical or psychological or
whatever field truths,

177
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:17,850
if you refer to the student with certain
pronouns,

178
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,690
do you really think that's a necessary 
place where they need that,

179
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,680
you know,
severe exposure or do you think there is

180
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:29,700
some sort of harm by calling them the 
Pronoun that

181
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,793
they will?
I think it's fundamentally a fabricated 

182
00:09:32,931 --> 00:09:33,764
issue.
It's been fabricated for political 

183
00:09:34,671 --> 00:09:35,504
reasons.
I know the history of the relevant 

184
00:09:36,771 --> 00:09:37,604
legislation in Ontario and initially the
legislation was basically predicated on 

185
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:45,820
the idea that that gender identity was a
social construct and that they're there,

186
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,663
we're going to be protections put in 
place for people whose gender identity 

187
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,033
had switched so that they weren't 
subject to harassment or discrimination 

188
00:09:52,851 --> 00:09:53,684
and there's no utility in subjecting 
people to counterproductive 

189
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,903
discrimination.
And I would consider discrimination 

190
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:01,184
counterproductive when the 
discrimination occurs for reasons that 

191
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:06,160
aren't relevant to the task at hand.
Sure.

192
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,010
Cause we discriminate all the time.
But the,

193
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,873
the,
the government ran the policies by a 

194
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,850
relatively select group of,
of activists and,

195
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:15,763
and transformed it into a,
a piece of policy legislation that no 

196
00:10:18,711 --> 00:10:19,544
one in their right mind would abide by 
or could abide by for that matter and 

197
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,200
reduced,
for example,

198
00:10:24,201 --> 00:10:25,034
the idea of human identity to something 
that basically transforms on a 

199
00:10:27,831 --> 00:10:28,820
subjective whim.

200
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,090
And so I don't buy any of that.
I don't,

201
00:10:31,091 --> 00:10:32,750
I don't think that that's what identity 
is.

202
00:10:32,751 --> 00:10:35,300
I don't think it's fundamentally self 
generated.

203
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,163
It might be socio culturally 
constructive to some degree and it most 

204
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,404
certainly is.
But the idea that your identity is 

205
00:10:42,711 --> 00:10:47,711
solely your choice and that you have the
right to inflict that on other people is

206
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:48,914
absolutely preposterous.
Most people grow out of that idea when 

207
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:53,550
they're two years of age.
And,

208
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:54,384
and I mean that technically because we 
know that when children hit about three 

209
00:10:57,561 --> 00:10:58,394
years of age,
they're able to start playing social 

210
00:10:59,751 --> 00:11:03,920
games and that's when they start 
learning that that identity is a,

211
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,550
is at minimum a socially negotiated 
phenomena now.

212
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,710
Okay.
So apart from that,

213
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,693
there's no agreement whatsoever on the 
set of pronouns that will be used and 

214
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,550
they've multiplied beyond anybody's,
anybody's imagination,

215
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,010
I would say including the people who 
formulated the legislation.

216
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,323
And then there's the fact that you don't
refer to people by their pronouns 

217
00:11:22,341 --> 00:11:24,320
anyways.
They're third person pronouns.

218
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:26,180
And so I don't call you,
he,

219
00:11:26,181 --> 00:11:28,160
when we're talking,
I might refer to you as he,

220
00:11:28,161 --> 00:11:30,380
if I was talking about you with someone 
else.

221
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:32,570
So most of the time it's a moot point 
anyways.

222
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,353
But doctor computers,

223
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,870
it says where it does matter,
right?

224
00:11:35,871 --> 00:11:36,704
Because certainly you could envision,
let's not talk so much about federal 

225
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:39,644
policy,
but perhaps like in an actual like 

226
00:11:40,941 --> 00:11:44,630
personal day to day setting,
do you think there is a harm?

227
00:11:44,631 --> 00:11:47,240
So perhaps you can disagree with like 
the philosophical principle,

228
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:51,410
the theoretical truth of whether or not 
identity can change subjectively with to

229
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:54,310
win.
But if someone comes up to me and says,

230
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,530
you know,
I want to be referred to as this,

231
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,693
even if I adopt some sort of view that I
don't really think fundamentally on a 

232
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:04,300
pure theoretical level,
they have an understanding of identity.

233
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:05,843
Do does that,
do I then choose to harm them or 

234
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:13,681
potentially upset to them by sticking to
my belief about what their identity is?

235
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:14,643
Well,
the first thing you'd have to establish 

236
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:17,710
is whether or not that would actually 
constitute harm.

237
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,990
That's the claim.
And the person might say,

238
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:20,860
well,
you're harming me,

239
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:23,740
but that doesn't provide evidence that 
you are people.

240
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:26,020
People presume very often that they're 
harmed by things,

241
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:26,854
that they're not harmed by it at all.
So I don't think that the mere claim 

242
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:30,274
that someone thinks that the way I would
address the might harm them gives them 

243
00:12:32,981 --> 00:12:36,220
the right to enforce by legislation the 
content of my speech.

244
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,620
I'd have just doesn't that doesn't,
that doesn't work.

245
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,753
And you know,
here's something else that's worth 

246
00:12:40,721 --> 00:12:42,970
noting from a more practical 
perspective.

247
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,280
I mean,
um,

248
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,453
I've received letters from about 30 
trends people and that's actually a lot 

249
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,850
because there aren't that many people 
and these are people who by and large,

250
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:54,850
we're very serious about their 
transformations and all.

251
00:12:54,851 --> 00:12:58,240
But one of them agreed with what I was 
doing saying first of all,

252
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,203
that they never asked to be represented 
by the activist to claim to be 

253
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:02,650
representing them.
No.

254
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:03,970
So here's a proposition,
right?

255
00:13:03,971 --> 00:13:04,804
So imagine that there's a group of 
people and that somebody is a member of 

256
00:13:07,781 --> 00:13:12,250
that group of people and then that 
person stands forthe as a member of that

257
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,500
group and says,
because I'm a member of that group,

258
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:16,390
I speak for all those people.
It's like,

259
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:16,991
actually,
no,

260
00:13:16,991 --> 00:13:17,824
you don't.
The mere fact that you're the member of 

261
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:21,610
a group,
it doesn't give you any right whatsoever

262
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:23,050
to speak on behalf of that group.

263
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,380
You need to have legitimacy as a 
representative and I don't,

264
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:30,280
I think that that you can hardly imagine
a more pernicious,

265
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:35,350
uh example say of racism then to presume
that if someone is black,

266
00:13:35,351 --> 00:13:37,270
they speak on behalf of all black 
people.

267
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,870
All black people are homogenous.
They all believe exactly the same thing.

268
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:41,823
Therefore,
if you talked to or met one of them 

269
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:45,640
you've talked to or met them all,
but there's that Dr. Peterson,

270
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:46,474
I think I'm referring to cases where the
actual people in front of you are 

271
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:50,344
telling you though that they want to,
they want to represent themselves a 

272
00:13:53,111 --> 00:13:53,801
certain way.
Right.

273
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:54,634
So we can talk about whether or not to 
the activist community is accurately 

274
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:01,120
representing actual communities.
But I'm wondering,

275
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,120
you mentioned you don't think like a 
self report of like,

276
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:04,983
Oh this is harming me or I would not be 
comfortable interacting with you unless 

277
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,583
you know,
x happened would not be an accurate way 

278
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:11,560
of describing real harm.

279
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,590
Are there better metrics we have for 
real harm?

280
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:16,630
If someone comes up to me and they say,
Oh,

281
00:14:16,631 --> 00:14:17,464
you know,
when they are feeling too warm in this 

282
00:14:19,841 --> 00:14:20,950
room,
we should leave,

283
00:14:20,951 --> 00:14:21,930
you know,
do I say,

284
00:14:21,931 --> 00:14:22,571
ah,
no.

285
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:23,404
Like you don't know how warm you are.
That's not something you can know for 

286
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,880
yourself.
That's just the self report.

287
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,770
Well,
it would depend on what they were asking

288
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:30,604
other people to do and I don't,
I don't believe that people have the 

289
00:14:33,191 --> 00:14:34,024
right to impose restrictions on what,
not so much restrictions on what I'm 

290
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:38,194
allowed to say,
but to determine the content of my 

291
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:41,680
speech,
that's an entirely different thing.

292
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:42,903
And so if it's a matter of the legal 
principle of whether or not I'm free to 

293
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:46,684
determine the content of my speech or 
the hypothetical discomfort of a 

294
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:52,130
hypothetical person because no one's 
actually asked me this yet.

295
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,093
Okay,
then I'm going to go with the freedom 

296
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:56,030
from compelled speech.
Partly again,

297
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:56,864
because I think that the idea that the 
government or any other institution 

298
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:02,360
should regulate the content of your 
speech is absolutely,

299
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,463
and it's intolerable.
I think you have a strong legal 

300
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:05,931
argument.
Right?

301
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:07,990
So the government probably shouldn't 
mandate this,

302
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,850
that I'm sure a lot of people might 
agree with that.

303
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,343
I'm still curious though,
in this hypothetical scenario that a 

304
00:15:13,801 --> 00:15:14,634
student did or a person did approach you
and they told you they would be harmed 

305
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:19,214
or they would be uncomfortable unless 
you refer to them with a certain 

306
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:21,584
pronoun.

307
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,470
Yeah.

308
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,180
What would you do?
Well,

309
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:28,923
I really have a hard time answering 
questions like that because they're 

310
00:15:30,941 --> 00:15:33,690
asked in the hypothetical.
It could certainly it could.

311
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,330
Yeah,
it could,

312
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,250
but my sense,
because I'm a clinician,

313
00:15:36,251 --> 00:15:40,030
is that I generally handle those sorts 
of things at the level of actual detail.

314
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,850
So I would say it would depend on the 
person.

315
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,970
It would depend on the situation.
It would depend on why they asked me.

316
00:15:45,971 --> 00:15:46,804
It would depend on how they asked me.
It would depend on what I thought they 

317
00:15:49,301 --> 00:15:51,220
were trying to accomplish by the 
request.

318
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,293
It would,
it would depend on whether or not they 

319
00:15:53,591 --> 00:15:55,030
were filming me.
Well,

320
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,370
they were asking me.
It would depend on whether they asked me

321
00:15:57,371 --> 00:15:59,410
in my office or in a hallway,
you know,

322
00:15:59,411 --> 00:16:03,970
I can tell the difference between a 
genuine plea for understanding and a bit

323
00:16:03,971 --> 00:16:06,190
of political theater or political 
manipulation.

324
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,093
Hm.
Now and I've dealt with people who've 

325
00:16:07,991 --> 00:16:08,824
made all sorts of requests of me,
believed me because I've had a clinical 

326
00:16:10,961 --> 00:16:13,690
practice for about 20 years and my 
experience with,

327
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,800
with the range of human behavior is I 
would say extraordinarily extensive.

328
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:18,963
And so I've made all sorts of 
adjustments to the way I interact with 

329
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,604
people.
So I can't say exactly what I would do 

330
00:16:23,261 --> 00:16:27,040
in a given situation because I firmly 
believe that the devil is in the details

331
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:32,190
and I haven't been making a case about a
specific interaction that I had actually

332
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,660
experienced or,
or,

333
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:35,680
or,
or,

334
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:36,760
or,
yeah,

335
00:16:36,761 --> 00:16:38,980
experienced.
I'd been making a case,

336
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:39,843
a philosophical fundamentally if 
philosophical case and secondarily a 

337
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:46,060
political case and I think that I've 
made the case properly,

338
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,163
but you would say that you'd recognize a
difference between a like legal 

339
00:16:50,081 --> 00:16:50,914
responsibility to do something versus 
it's sort of an individual personal 

340
00:16:53,621 --> 00:16:55,290
choice.
I should do something right.

341
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,133
Sometimes I recognize that.
I mean sometimes the legal and the 

342
00:16:58,421 --> 00:17:00,580
philosophical and the personal issue are
all the same.

343
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,623
It's simpler when that's the case,
but I also think that the issue is 

344
00:17:04,271 --> 00:17:05,560
essentially a red herring.

345
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,150
I mean,
look,

346
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,880
since I made that video for one reason 
or another,

347
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,043
the things that I've been saying have 
become quite popular and and not as 

348
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:14,584
controversial as you might think.
Most of what I've accrued so far is 

349
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:18,304
being support and the reason for that 
has very little to do with the issue of 

350
00:17:21,701 --> 00:17:22,534
pronouns.
The Pronoun issue in the Pronoun 

351
00:17:24,401 --> 00:17:25,234
controversy is a pointer to something 
that's a lot larger and that's why this 

352
00:17:27,641 --> 00:17:28,474
issue has had legs.
I'm not here because people are 

353
00:17:30,161 --> 00:17:30,994
interested in my views on pronouns.
Now I happen to put my foot down so to 

354
00:17:34,871 --> 00:17:35,704
speak at a particular place because it's
very frequently the case that if you're 

355
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,410
engaged in a complex philosophical 
dispute,

356
00:17:41,411 --> 00:17:44,080
which is the case for our society in 
general,

357
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,590
that in order to make a,
to make a statement about it,

358
00:17:47,591 --> 00:17:50,700
you have to make a statement in to an 
actual cause.

359
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,850
So you have to draw the line somewhere.
And people have asked me,

360
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:56,310
well,
why did you pick the Pronoun Hill to die

361
00:17:56,311 --> 00:17:58,620
on?
And my answer to that generally is a,

362
00:17:58,621 --> 00:17:59,940
I didn't die.
And B,

363
00:17:59,941 --> 00:18:03,750
you have to and be,
you have to,

364
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,510
you have to pick something real yeah.
To,

365
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,580
to enter into the debate.
So for example,

366
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:11,640
if I would have just made another video 
decrying political correctness,

367
00:18:11,641 --> 00:18:12,474
it would've gone nowhere at all.
But I said that there was something I 

368
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:15,354
wouldn't do.
And one of the things I won't do is use 

369
00:18:17,101 --> 00:18:17,934
the made upwards of postmodern neo 
Marxist who are playing a particular 

370
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:21,534
game with gender identity.
That's an extension of their particular 

371
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,900
reprehensible philosophy.
And if that happens to me in that,

372
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,993
um,
I have to engage in discussions about 

373
00:18:30,991 --> 00:18:33,150
whether or not if a,
you know,

374
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:33,590
if,
uh,

375
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,530
a suffering and confused person who's 
had a,

376
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,523
who's had a very like,
troubled pathway through life came and 

377
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,370
asked me politely if I would go out of 
my way to accommodate them.

378
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:47,430
I think that,
I don't think that those issues actually

379
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:49,170
belong on the same,
in the same,

380
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,580
they're not the same category of issue.
I mean,

381
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,010
so,
so I don't see that there's,

382
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,260
well I guess that's enough set of boat 
that.

383
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,900
All right,
let's transition a little bit.

384
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:04,920
So you mentioned sort of postmodernism 
and neo Marxism,

385
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:07,530
in fact in a statement and mcmaster 
university,

386
00:19:07,531 --> 00:19:08,364
you claimed that an expression of that,
the protest that you see at your events 

387
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,463
are an expression of a philosophy that's
grounded partly in postmodernism and 

388
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,210
partly in Marxism.
Yeah.

389
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:19,973
What does that mean first and secondly,
how would you say that these movements 

390
00:19:24,211 --> 00:19:26,670
are characterize in those ways?
Well,

391
00:19:26,671 --> 00:19:29,610
at mcmaster it meant that some of the 
protesters came with,

392
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,550
came and hid behind a banner that had a 
hammer and sickle on it.

393
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,243
You know?

394
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,180
So you see,
the funny thing is,

395
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:41,270
the funny thing is,
is that people laugh about that and,

396
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:43,560
and I understand perfectly well what 
while you're laughing,

397
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:44,394
but I can tell you,
you wouldn't have laughed if it would 

398
00:19:45,321 --> 00:19:47,520
have been a swastika and it's,
no,

399
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,470
no,
it's no funnier that it was a hammer.

400
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:50,880
And sickle,
you know,

401
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:51,411
the,
the,

402
00:19:51,411 --> 00:19:52,171
the,
the,

403
00:19:52,171 --> 00:19:53,004
the,
the reprehensible ideologies that are 

404
00:19:54,991 --> 00:19:55,824
based in,
in fundamental Marxism killed at least 

405
00:19:57,691 --> 00:20:01,530
100 million people in the 20th century.
And there's still apologist one in five.

406
00:20:01,531 --> 00:20:03,960
Social scientists identifies as a 
Marxist.

407
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,011
It's like,
really,

408
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:05,850
really?
That's really,

409
00:20:05,851 --> 00:20:07,410
that's really where we're going to take 
this.

410
00:20:07,411 --> 00:20:10,530
Is it after the bloody 20th century,
we're going to say,

411
00:20:10,531 --> 00:20:11,364
well,
that wasn't real communism or something 

412
00:20:12,781 --> 00:20:13,614
foolish like that.
Even though we had multiple examples of 

413
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,540
exactly what happens when those 
doctrines are let loose in the world.

414
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,853
And so what,
what happened in the 1960s in the late 

415
00:20:21,691 --> 00:20:24,960
1960s as far as I can tell,
and this happened mostly in France,

416
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,943
which has probably produced the most 
reprehensible coterie of public 

417
00:20:29,431 --> 00:20:31,560
intellectuals that any country has ever 
managed,

418
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,390
is that in,
in the,

419
00:20:33,391 --> 00:20:36,120
in the late 1960s when all the student 
activists,

420
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,013
uh,
had decided that the Marxist revolution 

421
00:20:38,581 --> 00:20:40,470
wasn't going to occur in the western 
world.

422
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,040
And,
and,

423
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,250
and had finally also realized that 
apologizing for the Soviet,

424
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:48,160
for the Soviet system was just not going
to fly anymore.

425
00:20:48,161 --> 00:20:48,994
Given,
given the tens of millions of bodies 

426
00:20:50,261 --> 00:20:52,780
that had stacked up that they performed 
a,

427
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,853
what I would call a philosophical 
sleight of hand and transformed the 

428
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:59,590
class war into a,
into a identity politics,

429
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,580
politics,
war.

430
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:01,743
And that became extraordinarily popular,
mostly transmitted through people like 

431
00:21:04,391 --> 00:21:05,224
shock Derrida,
who became an absolute darling of the 

432
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:07,564
Yale English department and had his 
pernicious doctrines spread throughout 

433
00:21:10,481 --> 00:21:14,200
North America partly as a consequence of
his invasion of Yale.

434
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,830
And what happened with the,
what,

435
00:21:15,831 --> 00:21:18,940
what happened with the postmodernist is 
they kept on pedaling their,

436
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:19,990
their,
their,

437
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:22,000
their,
their murderous breed of,

438
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:22,863
of political doctrine under a new guys 
and resentful people all over the world 

439
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:28,120
fell for it.
And I don't,

440
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,190
I don't consider that acceptable.
I,

441
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,960
you know,
one of the things I've learned,

442
00:21:31,961 --> 00:21:32,794
for example,
I teach my students in my second year 

443
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,323
personality class about what happened in
the Soviet Union and in the Gulag 

444
00:21:37,601 --> 00:21:38,434
archipelago.
And I use soldier Nitsa and has an 

445
00:21:39,911 --> 00:21:40,744
exemplar Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn as an 
exemplar of existential psychology 

446
00:21:44,861 --> 00:21:45,694
because I think he's actually the wisest
of the existential psychologist even 

447
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:51,490
though he was primarily a historian in 
literary finger.

448
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,653
Well,
most of the students don't even know 

449
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,380
what happened in the Soviet Union.
Well why is that exactly.

450
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,920
And the reason for that is that radical 
leftist ideologue,

451
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,773
intellectuals in the West have never 
properly apologized for the row for the 

452
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:08,350
role they played in the and the absolute
murderousness of the,

453
00:22:08,351 --> 00:22:09,490
of the 20th century.

454
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,200
And so students don't even know about 
it.

455
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:13,130
So they can come out to mcmaster behind 
there,

456
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,243
they're damn mineable poster with a 
hammer and sickle on it and act like 

457
00:22:17,111 --> 00:22:19,630
they're virtuous.
Do you think it's a calling,

458
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,613
getting that trend was only sort of 
significant to that specific mcmaster 

459
00:22:24,491 --> 00:22:25,324
incident?
Or do you see this type of ideology 

460
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,110
influencing campus protests beyond 
mcmaster in general?

461
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:33,790
Well,
I think the,

462
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:37,960
I think that that part of it,
it's everywhere.

463
00:22:37,961 --> 00:22:41,040
It's not just in campus protests.
I mean the,

464
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,520
the campuses are,
are,

465
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,910
are overrun in large part with 
disciplines that have,

466
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,430
in my estimation,
no valid reason to exist.

467
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,610
I think disciplines like women's studies
should be defunded.

468
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,880
Any of the activists disciplines who 
act,

469
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:55,803
who,
who's primarily primary role is the 

470
00:22:58,211 --> 00:22:59,520
overthrow us.
Uh,

471
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,150
for example,
of the patriarchy,

472
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:01,984
which is about is ill defined the 
concept as you could possibly formulate 

473
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:08,140
that it's enough that we've,
we've done enough public funding of that

474
00:23:08,141 --> 00:23:08,974
sort of thing.

475
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:09,963
We're providing,
we're providing full time destructive 

476
00:23:12,551 --> 00:23:13,384
employment for people who are doing 
nothing but causing trouble and 

477
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:16,603
seriously nothing.
You would say that because you think 

478
00:23:18,161 --> 00:23:18,994
that these departments are causing harm 
or it could have the potential to cause 

479
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:24,160
harm that university administrations to 
defund them,

480
00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:24,431
right?
No,

481
00:23:24,431 --> 00:23:25,264
I don't think they should be fun to.
Who the hell cares what I think about 

482
00:23:27,431 --> 00:23:28,264
them?
That's why I think that they should be 

483
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,130
defunded at all.
Okay.

484
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:31,323
I think they should be defunded because 
what they promote has a zero 

485
00:23:33,731 --> 00:23:34,564
intellectual credibility.
Their research methods don't qualify as 

486
00:23:37,421 --> 00:23:39,520
research methods.
There are publications,

487
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:44,350
80% of humanities publications now 
Garner zero citations.

488
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,333
That's not very citations and it's
a little trick as far as I can tell is 

489
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:56,480
what happens is that people write 
something that no one will read.

490
00:23:56,481 --> 00:23:58,310
They know perfectly well.
That new one will read it.

491
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,143
They circulated around there.
They're tiny group of compatriots who 

492
00:24:01,521 --> 00:24:02,354
occupied the same little,
little what a little area on the 

493
00:24:05,451 --> 00:24:06,284
intellectual spectrum.
So then it's peer reviewed then is 

494
00:24:08,391 --> 00:24:09,224
published by major journals who sell it 
at inflated prices to libraries who 

495
00:24:12,321 --> 00:24:13,154
squirreled away to end and only increase
the noise to signal ratio in 

496
00:24:17,481 --> 00:24:19,700
relationship to the sum total of human 
knowledge.

497
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,790
It's a scam from top to bottom.
So,

498
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:24,700
and you know,
one of the exam,

499
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,813
well let me give you an example.
So here's one of the things that really 

500
00:24:28,641 --> 00:24:30,560
bothered me about what was going on in 
Ontario.

501
00:24:30,561 --> 00:24:32,510
And this is happening everywhere.
And I made,

502
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,550
I made this claim when I made my first 
video,

503
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,533
since we have to get into this.
So the technical claim in the Ontario 

504
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:39,644
legislature legislation now,
and this is how this has already 

505
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:42,680
happened in New York,
by the way,

506
00:24:42,681 --> 00:24:44,780
this is not only a Canadian thing,
it's happening in Australia,

507
00:24:44,781 --> 00:24:47,060
it's happening in New Zealand,
it's happening everywhere.

508
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:50,030
Here's the claim.
There's biological sex,

509
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,043
there's gender identity,
there's gender expression and their 

510
00:24:52,971 --> 00:24:55,580
sexual proclivity.
And they vary independently.

511
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,520
That's the technical claim.
It's built into the Canadian law.

512
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,190
That's not true.
Not at all.

513
00:25:00,191 --> 00:25:01,024
Not a bit of that is true.
The correlation between biological sex 

514
00:25:03,681 --> 00:25:07,520
and gender identity exceeds 0.99 it's 
virtually perfect.

515
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,340
It's the very definition of non 
independent.

516
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,413
So you think almost everyone who is 
biologically male identifies as 

517
00:25:14,451 --> 00:25:15,284
biologically male,
almost everyone who identifies as 

518
00:25:17,421 --> 00:25:21,680
biologically male dresses and acts mail.
That's the gender identity element.

519
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:22,723
And almost everybody who is biologically
male who identifies as male who dresses 

520
00:25:26,631 --> 00:25:27,464
as male is in fact heterosexual.
Most things are incredibly tightly 

521
00:25:30,831 --> 00:25:31,664
linked.
But the technical claim in the 

522
00:25:32,421 --> 00:25:35,570
legislation is that they vary 
independently wrong.

523
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,853
Now I got in trouble for saying that 
because what people claimed was that I 

524
00:25:39,201 --> 00:25:40,034
was denying the existence of people who 
don't fit neatly into the gendered 

525
00:25:43,371 --> 00:25:44,204
categories,
which I wasn't doing it a zero one or 

526
00:25:45,981 --> 00:25:47,480
whatever the percentage may be.

527
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,853
That wouldn't fall neatly under that.
So suddenly if there were a perfect 

528
00:25:51,621 --> 00:25:53,120
correlation,
that would work.

529
00:25:53,121 --> 00:25:53,954
But if there's not,
it would seem perhaps that you're 

530
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,520
excluding certain people.
Right?

531
00:25:58,521 --> 00:25:59,354
So if,
if most people tend to identify a 

532
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:02,810
certain way,
but there is that 0.01 that's not,

533
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,433
I wasn't ever denying their existence.
I was denying the validity of the claim 

534
00:26:07,851 --> 00:26:11,450
that those four levels of analysis 
existed independently of one another,

535
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:14,060
which they don't.
It's a false claim.

536
00:26:14,061 --> 00:26:14,894
And the reason that the,
the radical social constructionist who 

537
00:26:17,481 --> 00:26:18,314
are pursuing this line of reasoning,
which is completely discredited as far 

538
00:26:20,661 --> 00:26:21,494
as I'm concerned,
I don't think it's any better than 

539
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:23,294
claiming that the world is flat.
The reason that they're pursuing it 

540
00:26:26,091 --> 00:26:26,924
legally is because they know perfectly 
well that they've lost the scientific 

541
00:26:29,181 --> 00:26:30,110
discussion.
I mean,

542
00:26:30,111 --> 00:26:30,944
I debated someone on Canadian public 
television who had the gall to say that 

543
00:26:33,891 --> 00:26:34,581
the,
you know,

544
00:26:34,581 --> 00:26:35,414
the scientific consensus over the last 
four decades was that there was no 

545
00:26:37,671 --> 00:26:39,740
biological differences between men and 
women.

546
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:40,983
I mean,
and that was one of the things that was 

547
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:44,100
so absurd about

548
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:44,933
that.
And there were many things that were 

549
00:26:46,201 --> 00:26:47,034
absurd about it,
was that I was in trouble with the 

550
00:26:48,781 --> 00:26:52,440
university at that point and he wasn't.
It's like first of all,

551
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,453
that is,
that is not the scientific consensus of 

552
00:26:56,011 --> 00:26:59,690
the last four decades.
Since the idea of it,

553
00:26:59,691 --> 00:27:02,190
there are no biological differences 
between men and women.

554
00:27:02,191 --> 00:27:05,250
It's the sort of thing you hear that it 
just makes your jaw drop.

555
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,353
Now what you could say is that if you 
took all the dimensions along which men 

556
00:27:10,531 --> 00:27:11,364
and women very,
and there's a substantial number of 

557
00:27:13,111 --> 00:27:15,690
them,
that there's substantial overlap between

558
00:27:15,691 --> 00:27:17,820
men and women on almost all of the 
dimensions.

559
00:27:17,821 --> 00:27:20,460
Now that's not particularly true with 
chromosomal identity,

560
00:27:20,461 --> 00:27:24,180
although there are some exceptions like 
with personality for example,

561
00:27:24,181 --> 00:27:26,460
and I happened to be somewhat of an 
expert on personality.

562
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,520
There are marked differences between men
and women,

563
00:27:29,521 --> 00:27:31,350
but the overlap exceeds the differences.

564
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,183
So for example,
women are higher in agreeableness and 

565
00:27:33,751 --> 00:27:34,584
you might say,
well that's socio culturally 

566
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:36,234
constructed.
But it turns out that it isn't because 

567
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,730
if you look across cultures and you,
you look at the cultures that have moved

568
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,593
most forward with um,
with gender equality provisions up the 

569
00:27:46,261 --> 00:27:47,094
social and political lead levels and 
that would be the Scandinavian 

570
00:27:49,261 --> 00:27:50,094
countries,
the differences in personality between 

571
00:27:52,081 --> 00:27:52,914
women,
men and women maximize in those 

572
00:27:54,211 --> 00:27:55,920
countries.
And these are tiny studies.

573
00:27:55,921 --> 00:27:56,754
These are studies that involve tens of 
thousands of people and that have been 

574
00:27:58,951 --> 00:28:01,650
well replicated by a series of 
independent researchers.

575
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,900
And so with,
with,

576
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:04,763
per,
if you add the personality differences 

577
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:08,940
between men and women across all the 
personality traits,

578
00:28:08,941 --> 00:28:11,010
you can almost perfectly segregate men 
from women.

579
00:28:11,011 --> 00:28:11,970
And that has not,
that,

580
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:12,953
that doesn't take into account the 
obvious things like arm angle and hip 

581
00:28:16,231 --> 00:28:17,064
width,
hip,

582
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,913
hip with compared to,
to waste with and shoulder width and 

583
00:28:20,371 --> 00:28:24,330
upper body strength and height and 
weight and the biochemical differences.

584
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:27,380
And I mean it's,
it's so preposterous that it's,

585
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,413
it's,
it's beyond conception to me that we're 

586
00:28:29,851 --> 00:28:33,360
actually even discussing it.
But I was making a specific claim,

587
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,950
which is the law says these four levels 
of analysis very independently.

588
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,130
The only reason they're associated with 
one another is for cultural reasons,

589
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,083
no wrong.
And you don't get to put fallacious 

590
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:49,310
scientific truths into the law,
not,

591
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,243
or if you're going to do that then I'm 
not going to abide by that particular 

592
00:28:52,621 --> 00:28:53,970
law.
I'm going to object to it,

593
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,560
which is exactly what I shouldn't be 
doing.

594
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,423
So do you think that a necessary premise
for us to accept to have a law like 

595
00:29:01,171 --> 00:29:03,480
that,
a law that extends protections and these

596
00:29:03,481 --> 00:29:04,314
groups is that these identities are 
independent from each other fully 

597
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:10,110
independent?
No.

598
00:29:10,111 --> 00:29:10,944
Could we accept like if they had just 
justified it as we know that these 

599
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:14,544
aren't fully independent,
but we think there are other good 

600
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:20,640
reasons to provide these protections.
What do you be,

601
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:23,190
what your stance on the law change?
Well,

602
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,103
the law as it's currently formulated 
doesn't in fact it undermines the 

603
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:32,700
protection that these sorts of groups 
have been pursuing is seeking for years.

604
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,773
So let's say let's take the let's,
let's accept the proposition that these 

605
00:29:37,021 --> 00:29:41,250
very independently or or that they're 
only socio culturally constructed.

606
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,040
Okay,
so where does

607
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,080
that leave your discussion of 
homosexuality?

608
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,900
So if they,
if the fundamentalist Christians say,

609
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:47,560
well,
if,

610
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,393
if homosexuality is nothing butter 
socio-cultural construct and why do we 

611
00:29:51,101 --> 00:29:53,950
have to put up with it?
It's a perfectly valid argument.

612
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,390
And he's say,
well no,

613
00:29:55,391 --> 00:29:56,170
you know,
people,

614
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,330
people are born into their sexual 
proclivity.

615
00:29:58,331 --> 00:29:59,164
Now I'm not saying that they are not 
because I'm not making either of those 

616
00:30:01,781 --> 00:30:02,614
courses.
What I am pointing out is that the 

617
00:30:03,881 --> 00:30:04,714
legislation and policies of that sword 
as currently formulated actually 

618
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:08,524
undermine the very arguments that many 
of the activists groups have been using 

619
00:30:11,621 --> 00:30:13,790
to promote the fact that they,
they are,

620
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,143
they're deserving,
let's say that they're deserving of 

621
00:30:18,281 --> 00:30:20,530
their,
of their non standard identity,

622
00:30:20,531 --> 00:30:22,750
that the nonstandard identities is 
justifiable.

623
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,390
If your sexual proclivity is nothing but
a whim,

624
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:27,230
then why should I put up with it?
Hmm.

625
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,353
No,
it's perfectly reasonable for me to say 

626
00:30:29,651 --> 00:30:29,860
no.

627
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,760
Well,
we'll just reshape it because you're in,

628
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,580
you're infinitely malleable now.
You know it,

629
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,433
it isn't exactly,
we don't exactly know the degree to 

630
00:30:37,871 --> 00:30:38,704
which such things as let's say sexual 
identity and sexual proclivity are 

631
00:30:42,221 --> 00:30:45,370
biologically predicated or socio 
culturally instantiated,

632
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,773
but when you,
when you put forward legislation that 

633
00:30:48,731 --> 00:30:51,130
insists on one to the exclusion of the 
other,

634
00:30:51,131 --> 00:30:53,110
you better be careful because you're 
going to be hooked,

635
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,153
hooked in your own news.
And so when I read through the 

636
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,270
legislation and the policies that 
surrounded that,

637
00:30:58,271 --> 00:30:59,104
I thought this isn't going to protect 
the people that it's supposed to 

638
00:31:00,911 --> 00:31:01,744
protect,
but it doesn't matter because the 

639
00:31:02,651 --> 00:31:05,020
legislation was never designed to 
protect people.

640
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:08,140
It was designed to advance a certain 
kind of political agenda,

641
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:10,600
which is partly why I'm objecting.
I'm objecting to it,

642
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,123
so I'm not willing in the slightest to 
presume that just because activist 

643
00:31:15,881 --> 00:31:19,840
groups with this postmodern Neil Marxist
ethic stand up and say,

644
00:31:19,841 --> 00:31:21,610
well,
we're on the side of the oppressed,

645
00:31:21,611 --> 00:31:25,000
that that makes them a on the side of 
the oppressed or be virtuous.

646
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:25,983
I don't buy either of those arguments.
I don't think they stand for what they 

647
00:31:28,211 --> 00:31:29,044
say they stand for.
I don't think they're promoting a 

648
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:32,710
doctrine that is going to do what they 
claim it will do.

649
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,110
I don't believe that they're good in the
rest of the world,

650
00:31:35,111 --> 00:31:35,944
bad.
I don't buy their oppressor victim 

651
00:31:37,571 --> 00:31:38,404
dichotomy.
I don't admire their philosophical 

652
00:31:40,091 --> 00:31:40,924
position.
I think they don't know anything about 

653
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:44,560
history or if they do know anything 
about history,

654
00:31:44,561 --> 00:31:45,394
then they're malevolent for pursuing 
exactly the same policies that led us 

655
00:31:48,251 --> 00:31:49,084
into terrible situations before.
So in what ways do you think the 

656
00:31:51,881 --> 00:31:52,714
policies that are being advocated,
maybe you could talk a bit about the 

657
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:59,290
particular harms you think that this 
Canadian bill would have,

658
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:05,280
even if we don't accept the theoretical 
or political or historical rationale for

659
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,053
the bail.
Could it be that it's still produces 

660
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:09,844
good consequences or do you think that 
there is even a consequentialist 

661
00:32:11,981 --> 00:32:13,870
argument against this sort of bill?

662
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,130
And if so,
what do you think?

663
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:15,964
The big letters that I've received from 
the transsexual people I described 

664
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:19,354
indicate instantly that it's not 
producing positive positive effects at 

665
00:32:21,851 --> 00:32:24,340
all.
And he said after saying,

666
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,653
well,
our political views aren't homogenous 

667
00:32:27,761 --> 00:32:29,650
and we don't like being treated as if 
they were.

668
00:32:29,651 --> 00:32:32,830
And these activists don't speak for us.
They say,

669
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:33,664
look,
most of us would just like to be a 

670
00:32:34,481 --> 00:32:35,314
little bit more invisible if we could.
And all this terrible concentration on 

671
00:32:38,741 --> 00:32:42,350
preferred pronouns and,
and identification of transsexual people

672
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:45,380
has made our lives a living hell.
Well and no wonder,

673
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:48,830
because it's hard to imagine you're 
imagine that you are having real trouble

674
00:32:48,831 --> 00:32:50,210
with your gender identity.
You know,

675
00:32:50,211 --> 00:32:53,420
and you're a six foot one guy and you 
want to transform yourself into a woman.

676
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:55,610
It's going to be hard enough for you to 
be,

677
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,473
you know,
cause I invisible in a socially 

678
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:58,934
acceptable way without a bunch of people
who purport to be speaking on your 

679
00:33:01,851 --> 00:33:02,684
behalf,
making this like issue do juror for 

680
00:33:04,461 --> 00:33:05,600
their political reasons.

681
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,180
And that's exactly what the letter 
writers have been telling me.

682
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,890
So.
So no,

683
00:33:09,891 --> 00:33:11,300
I don't,
I don't see that.

684
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,790
I mean the,
the legislation is,

685
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:14,683
was incoherent as originally formulated.
Then it was made worse by its shopping 

686
00:33:18,171 --> 00:33:19,004
before activist groups.
There no evidence whatsoever that will 

687
00:33:21,261 --> 00:33:22,094
have the outcomes that the,
that the people who formulated it 

688
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,453
hypothetically desire because I don't 
believe that they desire the best 

689
00:33:27,951 --> 00:33:30,320
possible outcome anyways.
The people look,

690
00:33:30,321 --> 00:33:31,154
the people who are formulating these 
sorts of policies state quite 

691
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,600
forthrightly,
so for example,

692
00:33:35,601 --> 00:33:37,550
if you go look at women's studies 
websites,

693
00:33:37,551 --> 00:33:38,384
they state quite forthrightly that their
aim is the destruction of the 

694
00:33:41,361 --> 00:33:43,310
patriarchy,
whatever the hell that is.

695
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:46,310
You know what I mean?
And that that's a good indication of the

696
00:33:46,311 --> 00:33:49,940
level of intellectual sophistication 
that goes into this sort of thinking.

697
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,350
What is this patriarchy exactly?
Well,

698
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,320
what is it exactly?

699
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,790
I mean,
if we're going to talk about it,

700
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:56,450
it's,
it's,

701
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:59,540
it's male domination of everything and 
nothing but oppression.

702
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,733
It's like,
really that's how we're going to define 

703
00:34:01,521 --> 00:34:03,860
our society.
Is it compared to what society?

704
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:04,723
Exactly.
Where if people be more free than they 

705
00:34:06,441 --> 00:34:07,251
are,
for example,

706
00:34:07,251 --> 00:34:08,084
in this country,
that doesn't mean they're perfectly 

707
00:34:09,561 --> 00:34:10,341
free,
but you know,

708
00:34:10,341 --> 00:34:12,080
forget that that's never going to 
happen.

709
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,670
It's like,
well,

710
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,430
this is an oppressive place compared to 
my height,

711
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:19,910
the hypothetical utopia that I would 
produce if I happen to be,

712
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,833
you know,
uh,

713
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:24,890
stolen for a week and are as I've,
as I've always,

714
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,760
as I've already pointed out,
if you were the,

715
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:30,450
the hypothetical,
um,

716
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,303
altruistic Utopian of your imagination,
then the people right behind you and 

717
00:34:35,271 --> 00:34:36,104
your bloody revolution would stab you to
death in your bed and you wouldn't get 

718
00:34:38,361 --> 00:34:41,840
to make your decisions for the benefit 
of anyone every anyways.

719
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,273
So how do you think progress should be 
made in a world where we are freer than 

720
00:34:47,601 --> 00:34:49,280
we have ever been?
Do you think we,

721
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,143
like when are there changes that are 
desirable to be made and how would you 

722
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:53,834
want to see them implemented,
if not through policy or through 

723
00:34:56,571 --> 00:34:57,404
activism?
The way that certain groups currently 

724
00:34:58,821 --> 00:35:00,020
are promotable back?
You know,

725
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,003
this happened in the 60s as far as I can
tell that we've got this misbegotten 

726
00:35:03,921 --> 00:35:06,200
idea that the way to conduct yourself as
a,

727
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,730
as a responsible human being was to hold
plaque cards up to protest,

728
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,780
to change the viewpoints of other people
and thereby usher in the utopia.

729
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:15,471
It's like,
I think,

730
00:35:15,471 --> 00:35:16,304
I think that's all appalling.
I think it's appalling and I think it's 

731
00:35:19,491 --> 00:35:20,324
absolutely,
it's absolutely observed that students 

732
00:35:22,431 --> 00:35:24,860
are taught that that's the way to 
conduct themselves in the world.

733
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,813
First of all,
if you're 19 or 20 or 21 you don't 

734
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:30,230
bloody well know anything.
You haven't done anything.

735
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:32,900
You don't know anything about history.
You haven't read anything.

736
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,330
You haven't supported yourself for any 
length of time.

737
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,100
You've been entirely dependent on your 
state and on

738
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,933
your family for the,
for the brief few years of your 

739
00:35:40,861 --> 00:35:41,694
existence and the idea that you have 
enough wisdom to determine how society 

740
00:35:44,761 --> 00:35:45,594
should be reconstructed when you're 
sitting in the absolute lap of luxury 

741
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,610
protected by,
by,

742
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:53,430
by processes that you don't understand 
is absolutely,

743
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,640
I mean it's okay,
so that's a bad,

744
00:35:56,641 --> 00:35:58,440
let's call that a bad idea.
Sure.

745
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,353
She all wait.
And then the idea that what you should 

746
00:36:03,331 --> 00:36:04,164
do to change the world is to find people
who you disagree with in shake paper on 

747
00:36:07,141 --> 00:36:10,370
sticks at them and call them names is 
also so,

748
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:14,340
and then you do that before you go out 
for here.

749
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,343
Oh,
I'll tell you how serious the activists 

750
00:36:16,621 --> 00:36:17,454
are.
This is something that's just 

751
00:36:17,881 --> 00:36:19,920
unbelievably comical as far as I'm 
concerned.

752
00:36:19,921 --> 00:36:22,110
So some of you may know that.
Um,

753
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:24,750
I participated in a debate on free 
speech,

754
00:36:24,751 --> 00:36:27,780
so called debate at free speech that the
University of Toronto hosted.

755
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,880
Um,
it turned into a forum and,

756
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,750
and whatever that is,
but it's certainly not a debate.

757
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,350
But one of the things I did when I was 
talking to the university administration

758
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:42,300
was to suggest how they might deal with 
the possibility of protestors.

759
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,171
So I said,
well,

760
00:36:43,171 --> 00:36:44,004
that's easy.
I can know how you can have absolutely 

761
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:46,920
zero protesters,
um,

762
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,350
habit in the morning.
They won't get out of bed in the town.

763
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:53,603
So we had it at nine o'clock in the 
morning and there was one MP member of 

764
00:36:57,301 --> 00:36:58,134
parliament who showed up to hand out 
some pamphlets and not a single 

765
00:37:00,211 --> 00:37:01,200
protester.
Oh.

766
00:37:01,201 --> 00:37:03,690
It's like if you want a controversial 
speaker on campus,

767
00:37:03,691 --> 00:37:04,524
just have it at seven in the morning.
You won't get a protestor within 50 

768
00:37:07,171 --> 00:37:08,004
yards of it because they'll still be 
sleeping off last night's part and the 

769
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:11,940
alcohol induced hangover.

770
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,380
Okay.

771
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,630
So,
so let me know when this question was.

772
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,553
What do I think people should do?
And I'll tell you something that's been 

773
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:26,730
very interesting to me and I can see it 
reflected here.

774
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,050
The first thing I've noticed is that,
um,

775
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,890
when I started putting my videos on 
youtube,

776
00:37:31,891 --> 00:37:32,724
which was about three years ago,
I noticed that about 85% of the people 

777
00:37:35,161 --> 00:37:35,994
that were watching the more men,
and I thought that's pretty weird 

778
00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:40,290
because about 80% of my students are 
women.

779
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,183
You know,
because men are bailing out of 

780
00:37:42,181 --> 00:37:43,014
universities like mad and there won't be
one in the social sciences and 

781
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,890
humanities left in 10 years.
But you know,

782
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,870
nobody seems particularly worried about 
that.

783
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,730
You can go look that up online if you 
want,

784
00:37:50,731 --> 00:37:51,564
and look at the enrollment curves and 
just project them 10 years out into the 

785
00:37:54,121 --> 00:37:56,160
future.
And I'd been following that for about 20

786
00:37:56,161 --> 00:37:56,790
years.

787
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,470
But one of the things,
but online it was,

788
00:37:58,471 --> 00:38:00,300
so it was 85% men.
I thought,

789
00:38:00,301 --> 00:38:01,860
wow,
that's really weird and strange.

790
00:38:01,861 --> 00:38:06,861
And then I made these political videos 
and then it popped up to 91% men.

791
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,113
And then I've noticed in the audiences 
that I've gone to talk to that it's 

792
00:38:11,191 --> 00:38:13,290
almost all men now.
Just look around here man.

793
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,070
It's like,
what?

794
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:16,710
It's gotta be 90% guys in this audience.
And I thought,

795
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,080
what the Hell is going on?
It's weird.

796
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,063
And I noticed that at the first free 
speech debate at the University of 

797
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,341
Toronto,
I made a point of it.

798
00:38:23,341 --> 00:38:24,720
I walked into the room and I thought,
wow,

799
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:25,554
these are all men.
So I had the stand up and the women 

800
00:38:27,031 --> 00:38:27,864
stand up and I used that as an example 
of the fact that maybe men and women 

801
00:38:30,781 --> 00:38:32,010
have different interests.
It was,

802
00:38:32,011 --> 00:38:33,840
you know,
just an ad hoc demonstration.

803
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:36,010
But it's really been born out by the

804
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,230
demographic analysis of my viewers and I
have,

805
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,093
you know,
several about 8 million views or 

806
00:38:40,721 --> 00:38:43,030
something like that now.
So it's a pretty big population.

807
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,113
I haven't been talking nonstop about 
personal responsibility and about the 

808
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:49,300
fact that if you want to change the 
world,

809
00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:50,134
you should bloody well get your act 
together and quit whining and sniveling 

810
00:38:52,091 --> 00:38:52,924
about how horrible everything is and 
about how people will you more rights 

811
00:38:55,271 --> 00:38:56,104
and more privileges.
And for some reason that seems to be a 

812
00:38:58,331 --> 00:39:00,760
message that's really resonating and 
among young men.

813
00:39:00,761 --> 00:39:02,890
And I think the reason for that,
first of all,

814
00:39:02,891 --> 00:39:06,040
I think young women have enough to do.
And so that's perhaps part of the reason

815
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:07,900
why the message isn't as necessary for 
them.

816
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,540
They're trying to juggle career,
they're trying to figure out how to have

817
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:11,374
a family and they don't really have any 
question about whether or not that's 

818
00:39:13,661 --> 00:39:14,620
useful and proper.

819
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:17,380
So they're off doing that and,
and whatever else they're doing.

820
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,900
But young men seem to have more of a 
choice about that.

821
00:39:19,901 --> 00:39:22,090
And many of them are essentially bailing
out.

822
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:25,870
And it's partly because I think they'd 
been well punished for their virtues.

823
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,870
And so I talked to young guys in 
particular about,

824
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:29,883
you know,
adopting some responsibility and trying 

825
00:39:31,481 --> 00:39:32,314
to straighten out their lives and to 
bear the load of being properly into 

826
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:36,123
forthrightly move through existence and 
to become a credit to themselves and 

827
00:39:39,101 --> 00:39:41,410
their community.
And that's what you should do instead of

828
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,393
waving cards at someone,
telling them to behave more property 

829
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:47,290
because you're morally superior to them.
So,

830
00:39:47,291 --> 00:39:49,510
and for some reason that message,
which is,

831
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,373
it's a really,
it's not the sort of message that you 

832
00:39:51,401 --> 00:39:53,360
would expect to sell,
right?

833
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,213
It's the exactly the opposite of 
something that you would consider a 

834
00:39:56,441 --> 00:39:56,970
salable.

835
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:57,803
But my experience has been that the 
young men in particular are so bloody 

836
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:03,940
desperate for that message that they can
hardly stand themselves.

837
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,083
And,
and it's no wonder because it's a call 

838
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:08,500
to,
it's a call to proper being,

839
00:40:08,501 --> 00:40:09,334
it's a call to heroic being and it's a 
call for people to adopt their 

840
00:40:12,311 --> 00:40:13,144
individual responsibility and to 
straighten themselves out and to find 

841
00:40:15,401 --> 00:40:18,970
out what they can be like if they took 
on the burdens of existence,

842
00:40:18,971 --> 00:40:20,680
like,
like respectable,

843
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,330
well-educated,
articulate,

844
00:40:22,331 --> 00:40:23,164
powerful people.
And that's ducks to the benefit of 

845
00:40:25,241 --> 00:40:27,520
everyone.
And so while it's,

846
00:40:27,521 --> 00:40:31,550
so that's where the responsibility lies.
And I'm not interested in the,

847
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,760
I've thought for many,
many years,

848
00:40:33,761 --> 00:40:35,950
decades really about having a political 
career.

849
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,233
I mean,
I was interested in a political career 

850
00:40:37,991 --> 00:40:42,910
when I was 13 and so every five years or
so I've probably revisited that.

851
00:40:42,911 --> 00:40:45,730
But every time I revisited,
I came to the same conclusion,

852
00:40:45,731 --> 00:40:46,564
which was that the,
the work that I was doing that was 

853
00:40:49,571 --> 00:40:50,404
focused on a philosophy of individual 
responsibility and trying to identify 

854
00:40:53,531 --> 00:40:54,364
how that philosophy had emerged in the 
West over thousands of years was more 

855
00:40:57,461 --> 00:40:59,770
important than any possible political 
action could be.

856
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:03,820
And I still don't regard what I'm doing 
as political in any sense of the word.

857
00:41:03,821 --> 00:41:04,654
I think it's,
I think it's still esophageal most 

858
00:41:06,491 --> 00:41:08,050
accurately and there's an element of 
that.

859
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,970
It's theological,
so,

860
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:10,923
so,
so I think it's individual 

861
00:41:13,511 --> 00:41:14,344
responsibility and the meaning of life 
is to be found in the adoption of 

862
00:41:16,781 --> 00:41:19,900
individual responsibility.
And that's what the university should be

863
00:41:19,901 --> 00:41:22,030
teaching people.
So Dr. Peterson,

864
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:24,670
you've mentioned these ideas of 
responsibility,

865
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:28,420
of virtue of respect.
You've I think,

866
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,810
detailed.
What do you think students shouldn't do?

867
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,950
And these examples of like protests

868
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,620
and these examples of certain types of 
activist tactics.

869
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,693
What advice would you have for students?
How can students make the changes that 

870
00:41:40,611 --> 00:41:42,350
they want to make?
Particularly,

871
00:41:42,351 --> 00:41:44,210
do you have any advice for students 
here?

872
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,650
Yeah.
Read great books.

873
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:47,450
Really,
man,

874
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,613
you've got this four year period that 
has been carved out of your lives by 

875
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:52,810
society.
They,

876
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:53,340
they,
it's,

877
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:57,410
it's given you an identity,
like a high quality identity and freedom

878
00:41:57,411 --> 00:41:58,244
at the same time.
And you're not going to get that again 

879
00:41:59,301 --> 00:42:00,770
in your life.
You've got to,

880
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:01,903
you've got a respectable identity,
university student and complete freedom 

881
00:42:05,571 --> 00:42:07,820
associated with that or as near as 
you're ever going to get.

882
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,833
And you've got these unbelievable 
libraries that are full of the writings 

883
00:42:10,851 --> 00:42:11,684
of people who were,
who are intelligent and articulate 

884
00:42:13,701 --> 00:42:16,270
beyond comprehension and you know,
and,

885
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:19,220
and you can go there and you can learn 
all this and you might think,

886
00:42:19,221 --> 00:42:20,330
well why should you learn it?

887
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,453
Um,
well you learn it to get a job or you 

888
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:25,760
learn it to get good grades or you learn
it to get a degree.

889
00:42:25,761 --> 00:42:28,250
And that's all nonsense.
It's nonsense.

890
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:29,323
The reason that you come to university 
to be educated is because there is 

891
00:42:31,521 --> 00:42:32,354
nothing more powerful than someone who 
is articulate and who can think and 

892
00:42:34,791 --> 00:42:36,560
speak.
It's power,

893
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:37,703
I mean power of the best sort and its 
authority and influence and 

894
00:42:40,281 --> 00:42:41,114
respectability and competence.
And so you come to the university to 

895
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:44,594
craft your highest skill and your 
highest skill is to be found in 

896
00:42:47,271 --> 00:42:49,730
articulated speech.
And if you're,

897
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,713
if you're,
if you're a master at formulating your 

898
00:42:52,701 --> 00:42:54,680
arguments,
you win everything.

899
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:57,650
And better than that,
when you win everything,

900
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:01,820
everyone around you wins too.
Because to transform yourself into,

901
00:43:01,821 --> 00:43:02,654
let's consider you consider your 
transformation into something 

902
00:43:05,181 --> 00:43:06,014
approximating the logos.
It means you shine a light on the whole 

903
00:43:08,991 --> 00:43:09,824
world.

904
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:11,480
Well,
there's nothing more exciting to do than

905
00:43:11,481 --> 00:43:12,314
that.
There's nothing better you can possibly 

906
00:43:13,221 --> 00:43:14,054
do.
And to think that you're going to 

907
00:43:15,081 --> 00:43:18,080
university to be trained to have a job,
it's like great.

908
00:43:18,081 --> 00:43:18,914
That's a hell of a lot better than being
unemployed and covered with cheeto dust 

909
00:43:21,591 --> 00:43:24,830
while you're snacking away in front of 
your video game in the basement.

910
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,620
But it's not.
It's not a,

911
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:29,330
and I don't have anything against video 
games by the way,

912
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,590
but it's hardly a triumphant call to to 
being in the world.

913
00:43:36,591 --> 00:43:38,690
And that's what universities should be 
calling forth.

914
00:43:38,691 --> 00:43:40,150
It's like God,
you people,

915
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:42,620
as you know,
I know what Harvard students are like.

916
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:45,620
I taught here for five years.
You people are spectacular.

917
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:47,300
You're spectacular.
You're,

918
00:43:47,301 --> 00:43:47,990
you're,
you're,

919
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:50,510
you're all capable of being world 
beaters.

920
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:51,523
You transform yourself into something 
that's articulated and sensible and 

921
00:43:54,441 --> 00:43:56,690
grounded in history and knowledgeable 
and wise.

922
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:57,523
Man,
you can do anything you want and 

923
00:43:58,851 --> 00:44:02,120
hopefully anything you want for good 
because if you have any sense,

924
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:03,043
everything you want to do would be for 
the good because there's nothing more 

925
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:10,570
compelling or meaningful or or useful in
combating the tragedy of life than to,

926
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:12,043
than to struggle with all your soul on 
behalf of the good and the university's 

927
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:17,600
isn't forgotten,
Matt.

928
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:20,690
It's what everyone's bailing out of the 
humanities and they should,

929
00:44:20,691 --> 00:44:21,524
the humanities are corrupt and they're 
corrupt because they're not telling 

930
00:44:24,381 --> 00:44:26,540
students this.
It's so bloody obvious.

931
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:27,763
It's like learn to think,
learn to speak loom to it makes you a 

932
00:44:32,521 --> 00:44:35,970
super power and individual superpower 
you have

933
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,300
under.
I know what I'm just stand.

934
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:43,410
Why that isn't just told to students.
It's not that hard to understand it.

935
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:44,700
Everyone wants to hear it.
It's like,

936
00:44:44,701 --> 00:44:45,660
really?
I could do that.

937
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:46,830
I can do that.

938
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:47,850
It's like,
yeah,

939
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:52,851
really you could do that and the whole 
society around you is labored for really

940
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,413
thousands of years to provide every 
single one of you with this spectacular 

941
00:44:56,551 --> 00:44:57,384
opportunity that you have while your 
undergraduates and graduate students 

942
00:44:59,941 --> 00:45:00,960
here.
They're just,

943
00:45:00,961 --> 00:45:01,794
everyone's just praying that you would 
come here and manifest everything that 

944
00:45:05,551 --> 00:45:08,490
you could manifest and that's what you 
should be doing.

945
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:09,383
Instead of waving plot cards and 
complaining about how you're oppressed 

946
00:45:12,571 --> 00:45:13,404
for God's sake,
you see these Yale students complaining 

947
00:45:15,751 --> 00:45:17,280
about their oppression.
It's just,

948
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,210
it just leaves me aghast and it's like,
well,

949
00:45:21,211 --> 00:45:23,100
we're against the ruling class.
It's like,

950
00:45:23,101 --> 00:45:23,491
no,
no,

951
00:45:23,491 --> 00:45:26,190
no.
Your baby ruling class members,

952
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:27,203
you're young.

953
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:32,750
[inaudible] the

954
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:37,030
only reason you're not rich is cause 
you're young.

955
00:45:37,031 --> 00:45:37,960
You know?
That's the best.

956
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,310
Really.
That's the,

957
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:43,120
if you look at the 1%,
even the dreaded 1% you know,

958
00:45:43,121 --> 00:45:45,940
most of those people are old.
Why?

959
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,890
Well,
when you progress through life,

960
00:45:47,891 --> 00:45:48,724
if you're reasonably successful,
you trade in your promising youth for 

961
00:45:51,881 --> 00:45:52,714
your wealthy old age,
but you're still blooding old when you 

962
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:58,720
trade it.
When you trade your youth for that,

963
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,900
like if you factor age out of the 
economic equation,

964
00:46:01,901 --> 00:46:03,070
things look a lot different.
One.

965
00:46:03,071 --> 00:46:04,780
Of course,
older people have more money.

966
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:05,913
If they have any sense,
they'd been collecting it for their 

967
00:46:07,091 --> 00:46:09,040
whole life.
Is that somehow unfair?

968
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:10,233
It's not unfair unless you want to want 
to be poverty stricken when you're 70 

969
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,193
and you,
and you don't want to be poverty 

970
00:46:14,831 --> 00:46:19,120
stricken,
pop poverty stricken when you're 70 so I

971
00:46:19,121 --> 00:46:21,580
just don't understand what's happened to
the universities.

972
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:25,090
I can't believe that you're not told 
when you come the first day,

973
00:46:25,091 --> 00:46:26,410
look man,
you are on,

974
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,273
you're here on a heroic mission.
You're going to take your capacity to 

975
00:46:30,131 --> 00:46:33,100
articulate yourself to levels that are 
undreamed of,

976
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:35,470
you're going to come out of here.
I'm unstoppable.

977
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:37,270
You're going to be able to do anything 
you want.

978
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:40,140
It's like that's what you're here for.
Instead,

979
00:46:40,141 --> 00:46:41,380
you're taught that.
Well,

980
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:42,214
you know,
the world's a pretty oppressive place 

981
00:46:43,211 --> 00:46:45,250
and you're probably the bottom of the 
victim pile.

982
00:46:45,251 --> 00:46:45,881
And,
and,

983
00:46:45,881 --> 00:46:46,840
and,
and there's,

984
00:46:46,841 --> 00:46:47,674
and there's,
there's virtually nothing you can do 

985
00:46:48,881 --> 00:46:49,900
about it except,
you know,

986
00:46:49,901 --> 00:46:50,734
deconstruct the patriarchy and it's so 
rude deed and so pathetic that that 

987
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,013
university should be embarrassed that 
that's what they're peddling to 

988
00:46:57,821 --> 00:47:00,040
students.
I'm embarrassed by it.

989
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:01,263
You know,
I've gone on public record telling 

990
00:47:02,501 --> 00:47:03,490
parents,
bloody well,

991
00:47:03,491 --> 00:47:07,360
send your boys to trade school because 
at least they'll learn something useful.

992
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,433
And that's a terrible thing for someone 
like me to say it because I do believe 

993
00:47:11,171 --> 00:47:12,004
that the are being articulated,
an educated in the highest possible 

994
00:47:16,271 --> 00:47:17,104
manner is there's nothing that's better 
for you and for society and why are the 

995
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:23,170
why of the university's forgotten this?
Well,

996
00:47:23,171 --> 00:47:24,004
that's postmodern neo Marxism for you.
You know that then the philosophy of 

997
00:47:27,341 --> 00:47:32,140
intense resentment and oppression and 
group identity and god,

998
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:33,093
it's just pathetic.
That reason I think a lot of students 

999
00:47:36,371 --> 00:47:39,190
here would agree with you that one of 
the main purposes of,

1000
00:47:39,191 --> 00:47:40,420
uh,
education and college,

1001
00:47:40,421 --> 00:47:41,254
particularly at Harvard,
is to develop their sense of 

1002
00:47:43,241 --> 00:47:44,860
articulation,
their ability to read,

1003
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:46,810
their ability to create a critically 
think.

1004
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:49,510
Then what comes after,
particularly at Harvard,

1005
00:47:49,511 --> 00:47:51,970
there's a big discussion on what is a 
good life,

1006
00:47:51,971 --> 00:47:56,950
what does it mean to use those skills 
that we get here and then we graduate.

1007
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:00,560
What do we do from there?
Stop.

1008
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:04,960
Unnecessary suffering.
That's what you do.

1009
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:08,080
You know that that's your calling.
It's like you say,

1010
00:48:08,081 --> 00:48:09,610
well,
what do you do after you graduate?

1011
00:48:09,611 --> 00:48:10,840
Well,
if you graduate,

1012
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:12,063
articulated and powerful,
there will be people giving you so many 

1013
00:48:15,341 --> 00:48:16,174
opportunities.
You won't even be able to keep up with 

1014
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:18,851
them.
You know,

1015
00:48:18,851 --> 00:48:20,830
and I've worked with comp,
very,

1016
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:23,470
very competent people in many different 
domains in my life.

1017
00:48:23,471 --> 00:48:26,740
Hyper competent people.
And I can tell you some very interesting

1018
00:48:26,741 --> 00:48:27,574
things about hyper competent people.
The first thing is they are not selfish 

1019
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:31,803
and they're not greedy.
And one of the great pleasures in their 

1020
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,624
lives is to find people who have the 
capacity to also be hyper competent and 

1021
00:48:38,351 --> 00:48:41,350
to open doors for them as rapidly as 
they can possibly be opened.

1022
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:43,920
They delight in that because there is,
there's nothing there.

1023
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,900
There's just very few things that are 
more intrinsically meaningful.

1024
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:48,003
If you're an accomplished person,
then to find young people who have the 

1025
00:48:50,111 --> 00:48:52,030
possibility of being accomplished and 
say,

1026
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,010
hey look,
here's an opportunity for you.

1027
00:48:54,011 --> 00:48:55,480
It's like go out there man,
kill it.

1028
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,120
And then they go up there and kill it 
and you think right on man,

1029
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,090
here's another opportunity to go ahead 
and go there.

1030
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:02,200
Nail that to anything.
No,

1031
00:49:02,201 --> 00:49:03,034
no.
They're all holding their wealth and 

1032
00:49:03,761 --> 00:49:05,050
they're not going to share it with 
anyone.

1033
00:49:05,051 --> 00:49:07,330
It's like that's absolute complete 
rubbish.

1034
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:08,343
And so you don't even have to worry 
about what you're going to do after you 

1035
00:49:10,301 --> 00:49:11,440
graduate from here.
If you,

1036
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,750
if you turn yourself into half of what 
you could be,

1037
00:49:13,751 --> 00:49:14,584
because people will be dying to offer 
you every opportunity that you can 

1038
00:49:17,351 --> 00:49:20,260
possibly make use of.
So it's,

1039
00:49:20,261 --> 00:49:21,550
it's,
it's a moot point.

1040
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:22,180
The,
the,

1041
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,013
the world is always desperately short of
people who can think and speak and you 

1042
00:49:27,311 --> 00:49:28,020
think,
well,

1043
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,760
I won't be made use of,
well,

1044
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,780
first of all,
you can't say that if you're an F,

1045
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,000
if you're at Harvard for God's sake,
I mean,

1046
00:49:34,001 --> 00:49:35,830
people already figured out who you are.

1047
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:38,760
They've already figured it out and 
they're offering you the world on a,

1048
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:41,320
on a gold platter.
It take it,

1049
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:42,820
it's yours.
Take it.

1050
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,380
It's like,
great man.

1051
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,380
Put yourself together and deserve it.
That would be great.

1052
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:50,260
And that's what everyone wants.
It's what your parents want.

1053
00:49:50,261 --> 00:49:52,050
It's also what you want.
You know it,

1054
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:54,130
it's what you want.
It's what men,

1055
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,550
it's what women want from men.
It's what men want from women.

1056
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:58,743
It's like for you to be who you could be
and then the highest faculty of the 

1057
00:50:02,441 --> 00:50:05,400
human being is articulated speech.
It's,

1058
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:09,250
it's the divine faculty and there is 
nothing more powerful than that.

1059
00:50:09,251 --> 00:50:11,920
There's nothing that's even in the same 
league,

1060
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,890
and so if you,
if you don't have faith in that,

1061
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,680
then your,
then your priorities are misplaced and I

1062
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,560
can't even understand why you wouldn't 
have faith in that being,

1063
00:50:20,561 --> 00:50:23,470
say Harvard students because look where 
it's got you already.

1064
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:26,260
You know you're already sitting on top 
of the world,

1065
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:29,840
so make deserve it.
Make use of it,

1066
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:32,150
right?
Go out there and fix things up.

1067
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,013
That's what you need to do.
There's lots of things that need to be 

1068
00:50:34,491 --> 00:50:35,324
fixed up and what you want to do is 
burden yourself with so much 

1069
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:38,534
responsibility that you can barely stand
and then you'll get stronger trying to 

1070
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:44,060
lift it up and you'll be,
won't be asking,

1071
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:45,103
what should I be doing with my life?
Or what's the meaning of life or any of 

1072
00:50:47,241 --> 00:50:48,530
that.
It will be self evident.

1073
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,840
It's self evident.
At minimum.

1074
00:50:50,841 --> 00:50:53,990
You can say there's more suffering in 
the world and there should be,

1075
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:54,883
and I could probably do something about 
that and you can do something about 

1076
00:50:57,261 --> 00:50:59,250
that.
So go do something about it.

1077
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,040
And then there'll be less suffering in 
the world.

1078
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:03,500
And then when you're 80 you can look 
back on your life and say,

1079
00:51:03,501 --> 00:51:04,334
well,
you know,

1080
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:07,400
there's less suffering in the world than
there and there would have been had.

1081
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,233
I know it existed and,
and you don't have to even have a sense 

1082
00:51:11,631 --> 00:51:12,464
of,
of ultimate destiny or even any sort of 

1083
00:51:14,031 --> 00:51:17,120
theistic belief to regard that as a 
positive good.

1084
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:18,103
Like I think it goes beyond the mere 
pragmatic utility of addressing the 

1085
00:51:21,831 --> 00:51:23,860
world's ills because I think we do live 
in a,

1086
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:24,843
in a,
in a world that has a transcendent 

1087
00:51:26,481 --> 00:51:28,880
reality as well as the reality that we 
can detect.

1088
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:31,250
But even independently if that,
it doesn't matter.

1089
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:32,690
It's like,
I mean,

1090
00:51:32,691 --> 00:51:35,750
this is part of the reason I like people
like Bill Gates is a great example,

1091
00:51:35,751 --> 00:51:36,471
man.
That guy is,

1092
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:39,560
he's after five major diseases at the 
same time,

1093
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:41,600
right?
He's trying to wipe out polio.

1094
00:51:41,601 --> 00:51:45,200
He's trying to wipe out
malaria.

1095
00:51:45,201 --> 00:51:46,280
Yeah,
exactly.

1096
00:51:46,281 --> 00:51:47,900
He's trying to wipe out malaria.
It's like,

1097
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:50,300
well what should you do with your life?
Well,

1098
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:52,820
you know,
take a look at Bill Gates and see if you

1099
00:51:52,821 --> 00:51:54,590
could do something like that.
That would be good.

1100
00:51:56,650 --> 00:51:57,483
So I said after a penis,
and you talk about this idea of ending 

1101
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,253
unnecessary suffering and this idea of 
committing one's life to that at a 

1102
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:07,190
minimum,
I mean that's the minimum thing that you

1103
00:52:07,191 --> 00:52:10,010
could do.
A lot of students I think,

1104
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:10,903
accept that premise and view what 
they're doing as trying to eliminate or 

1105
00:52:14,721 --> 00:52:15,554
reduce unnecessary suffering.
And they see activism or other forms of 

1106
00:52:18,531 --> 00:52:19,364
direct service as fulfilling that goal.
Do you simply disagree with like the 

1107
00:52:22,671 --> 00:52:23,504
content of what they think,
the tactic that they are using to end 

1108
00:52:27,021 --> 00:52:27,854
unnecessary suffering?
Or do you think that their motives or 

1109
00:52:29,991 --> 00:52:33,050
their intentions are not even the same 
as yours?

1110
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,750
It's too public.
You know,

1111
00:52:40,751 --> 00:52:41,590
there's this,
there's this,

1112
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,610
there's this old saying from the,
from the new testament about not praying

1113
00:52:45,611 --> 00:52:47,260
in public.
Right.

1114
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,530
And the idea is that if you're going to 
commune for the higher good,

1115
00:52:50,531 --> 00:52:51,364
you should do it in private because 
otherwise you're warping your ethic in 

1116
00:52:53,561 --> 00:52:57,370
some sense by demonstrating how virtuous
you virtuous you are to the world.

1117
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:58,453
It's like,
you know,

1118
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:00,610
you go out there with a stick and the 
sign on,

1119
00:53:00,611 --> 00:53:02,350
if it says I'm against poverty,
it's like,

1120
00:53:02,351 --> 00:53:03,480
yeah,
no kidding man.

1121
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,760
Really?
Like it was for poverty.

1122
00:53:07,210 --> 00:53:09,760
No one's core poverty.
So it's,

1123
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:10,690
it's,
it's,

1124
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,553
it's an abdication of responsibility 
with the mask of social virtue and you 

1125
00:53:14,771 --> 00:53:15,604
want to solve difficult problems to see,
figure out how to get along with your 

1126
00:53:17,441 --> 00:53:18,274
brother,
the one you've been fighting with for 

1127
00:53:18,941 --> 00:53:19,774
five years there.
See if you can staple your family back 

1128
00:53:21,401 --> 00:53:22,234
together,
see if he can stop fighting with your 

1129
00:53:23,411 --> 00:53:26,370
girlfriend and have a relationship that 
for more than two weeks,

1130
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:27,623
you know,
it's like there are things that you 

1131
00:53:28,501 --> 00:53:32,100
should be doing in the confines of your 
own life that are private and humble,

1132
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,083
that would,
that would constitute genuine 

1133
00:53:34,501 --> 00:53:36,420
accomplishments.
And those are the things that you should

1134
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:37,254
attend to.
And no one's going to come along and 

1135
00:53:37,891 --> 00:53:38,641
say,
hey,

1136
00:53:38,641 --> 00:53:39,720
you know,
good job.

1137
00:53:39,721 --> 00:53:42,030
You're,
you're changing the world because it's,

1138
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,950
it's private,
but it's real.

1139
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,870
And then people don't do that.
And so,

1140
00:53:45,871 --> 00:53:46,440
no,
I don't,

1141
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,850
I don't trust the activists.
I don't trust the activist ethos at all.

1142
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:51,740
Hmm.
I think,

1143
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:56,780
I think everything about it is,
is superficial and,

1144
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:01,920
and trendy and,
and too easy and,

1145
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:06,990
and it externalizes the blame.
The evil is always the elsewhere,

1146
00:54:06,991 --> 00:54:10,830
which is a dreadful mistake to make 
because the evil isn't elsewhere.

1147
00:54:10,831 --> 00:54:11,664
That's,
that's the thing that you understand 

1148
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:15,870
when you're wise is the evil is not 
elsewhere.

1149
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:19,140
It's you because you're not everything 
you could be.

1150
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:20,341
And so,
you know,

1151
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:22,440
you should work on that before going in 
talent.

1152
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:24,420
Someone else that maybe they're not who 
they should be.

1153
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:26,950
So I think it's,
you know,

1154
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:28,230
I,
so I don't buy it.

1155
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:29,064
It's too easy.
It's far too easy and it's too public 

1156
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:32,483
and it's too self congratulatory.
And then there's the murderous like 

1157
00:54:34,921 --> 00:54:35,970
Marxist element,
which,

1158
00:54:35,971 --> 00:54:38,340
you know,
I'm always often inclined to mention.

1159
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:40,523
So certainly I think you've identified 
certain causes where the public element 

1160
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:49,980
or the self congratulatory version I'm 
to do good could be harmful.

1161
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:51,900
But do you think there are cases,
for instance,

1162
00:54:51,901 --> 00:54:55,400
I'm thinking of policy influencing 
policy and being a policy maker.

1163
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:56,423
It seems like something like that public
policy could be used to eliminate some 

1164
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:05,460
unnecessary suffering,
but would involve a more public domain.

1165
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,760
Something where you are trying to 
attract followers,

1166
00:55:08,761 --> 00:55:10,620
trying to attract praise from other 
people.

1167
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:11,281
Look,
look,

1168
00:55:11,281 --> 00:55:12,114
if you,
if you've established yourself in the 

1169
00:55:13,531 --> 00:55:14,364
world as a credible human being and 
people are asking you to enter public 

1170
00:55:19,291 --> 00:55:22,620
service because of your accomplishments,
then it's time to do it,

1171
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:25,380
right?
But before that,

1172
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:29,360
it's a little on the premature site.
And if you're just setting your for self

1173
00:55:29,361 --> 00:55:32,250
forward as an Avatar of an idiot of an 
ideology,

1174
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:33,323
then there's nothing to you.
Except I think of it as the chattering 

1175
00:55:35,671 --> 00:55:39,030
of various forms of demons.
It's like you're not helpful.

1176
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,770
And if you,
if you look,

1177
00:55:40,771 --> 00:55:41,521
you want to think,
okay,

1178
00:55:41,521 --> 00:55:43,310
are you fit to lead?
That's,

1179
00:55:43,311 --> 00:55:44,640
let's put it that way.
Okay.

1180
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,830
First of all,
do you know where you're going?

1181
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:48,990
Because that's actually one of the 
hallmarks of a leader.

1182
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:49,824
Leader knows where he's going and maybe 
other people are also interested in 

1183
00:55:52,381 --> 00:55:53,214
going that way.
But the leaders I've met have carved 

1184
00:55:55,141 --> 00:55:57,360
themselves out a personal vision,
right?

1185
00:55:57,361 --> 00:55:58,194
He's not some,
it's not some cookie cutter ideological 

1186
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:04,500
solution to the ills of the planet.
They've done a detailed analysis,

1187
00:56:04,501 --> 00:56:06,420
right?
They know what they're talking about and

1188
00:56:06,421 --> 00:56:07,640
they're usually people,
well,

1189
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:10,710
they've had a successful relationship,
they've had a successful family,

1190
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:11,693
they have a couple of degrees,
they've established a business like 

1191
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:16,920
they've made themselves credible in five
or six dimensions.

1192
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:17,933
Well then maybe you know enough about 
the world to dare to mess with its 

1193
00:56:20,611 --> 00:56:22,500
internal mechanisms.
And if you,

1194
00:56:22,501 --> 00:56:24,160
if you don't have that kind of in depth

1195
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,330
knowledge,
then you should just,

1196
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,433
you shouldn't,
you should know more work on the 

1197
00:56:27,941 --> 00:56:30,520
economic systems of Western 
civilization.

1198
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:31,503
Then you should try to adjust the 
electronic systems of your automobile 

1199
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:39,370
because the latter is far less complex 
than the former.

1200
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:42,760
So of course there's utility in policy 
formulation and in,

1201
00:56:42,761 --> 00:56:45,220
in government service and in all of 
those sorts of things,

1202
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:48,910
but you have to,
you have to have transformed yourself at

1203
00:56:48,911 --> 00:56:49,744
least to some degree,
into someone who's actually competent 

1204
00:56:51,401 --> 00:56:53,620
before you should even dare to do such 
things.

1205
00:56:53,860 --> 00:56:54,610
You think,
well,

1206
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:57,440
I have read some marks and now I know 
how to change the world.

1207
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:01,563
Yup.
That's a very bad idea because the 

1208
00:57:02,541 --> 00:57:03,374
probability that you're going to take 
something complex that doesn't work too 

1209
00:57:05,991 --> 00:57:09,680
badly and fix it with your idiotic 
intervention is zero.

1210
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:15,520
Hmm.
Well put,

1211
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:24,743
we've talked a little bit about this 
idea of signaling virtue and one thing 

1212
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:29,773
that I thought about a lot of activists 
causes ones you might characterize as 

1213
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:34,183
self congratulatory seem to emphasize 
concepts like validation and 

1214
00:57:37,311 --> 00:57:39,740
affirmation.
In your experience,

1215
00:57:39,741 --> 00:57:42,200
either as a professor,
as a psychologist,

1216
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:43,243
do you think that this is an example of 
virtue signaling and perhaps provide 

1217
00:57:45,711 --> 00:57:49,400
like a definition of virtual virtue 
signaling first or do you think there is

1218
00:57:49,401 --> 00:57:52,790
some value in these types of principles 
or these types of interactions?

1219
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:57,040
I don't think there's any value in those
principles at all.

1220
00:57:57,070 --> 00:57:58,210
I mean,
I can say,

1221
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,040
well,
I think you're a really good guy.

1222
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:01,383
Yeah,
yeah.

1223
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,150
Nope.
At most,

1224
00:58:04,151 --> 00:58:05,110
that's a,
well,

1225
00:58:05,111 --> 00:58:06,420
first of all,
it's cheap and easy,

1226
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:07,993
and now I'm in the,
I'm a good guy because he's the one 

1227
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:11,470
perfectly willing to affirm you.
It's like

1228
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,920
everyone has a problem.
Let's say with self affirmation.

1229
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:21,220
This is why I hate that word,
but I'll use it temporarily.

1230
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:22,623
Um,
this is part of the reason why I'm an 

1231
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:25,053
admirer of part in part of the 
existential philosophers and 

1232
00:58:27,641 --> 00:58:28,474
psychologists,
because one of the points they made is 

1233
00:58:30,701 --> 00:58:31,534
that,
well,

1234
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:35,920
human beings are flawed creatures.
W W we have tragic lives.

1235
00:58:35,921 --> 00:58:37,270
We're very,
very vulnerable.

1236
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:41,650
And so it's very easy for us to despise 
ourselves and to end,

1237
00:58:41,651 --> 00:58:43,060
to end,
to end,

1238
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:44,380
to be empty,
to despise,

1239
00:58:44,381 --> 00:58:47,470
and have contempt for humanity itself.
And there are reasons for that.

1240
00:58:47,471 --> 00:58:48,880
We're,
we're weak,

1241
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:51,640
we're flawed,
we're malevolent.

1242
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:54,250
We don't last very long.
We're not very attractive.

1243
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,640
We have,
we have an endless litany of faults,

1244
00:58:57,670 --> 00:59:00,310
both as a species and as individuals.
Well,

1245
00:59:00,311 --> 00:59:01,900
so,
so you're stuck with that.

1246
00:59:01,901 --> 00:59:05,260
That's just part of being itself.
It's built into the fabric of being.

1247
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,030
So what do you do about that?
Well,

1248
00:59:07,031 --> 00:59:11,140
you don't go around waiting for someone 
to tell you what a good person you are.

1249
00:59:11,141 --> 00:59:12,160
That's not,
first of all,

1250
00:59:12,161 --> 00:59:13,810
it's not believable.
It's not helpful.

1251
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:14,713
That doesn't mean you should be 
commenting people into a sense of even 

1252
00:59:18,191 --> 00:59:21,410
more fallibility than they already have.
That's not clearly,

1253
00:59:21,411 --> 00:59:22,310
that's not helpful.

1254
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:25,670
But the way that you develop an,
an,

1255
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:28,520
uh,
a sense of respect for yourself,

1256
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:29,383
which is a better way of thinking about 
it or respect for humanity for that 

1257
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:33,440
matter,
which is much better than thinking about

1258
00:59:33,441 --> 00:59:38,441
it as an affirmation,
is to bear up under the damn load.

1259
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,810
And then you can recognize yourself as 
something that's flawed,

1260
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:45,160
but the can tolerate the floor and that 
can work towards alleviating it.

1261
00:59:45,161 --> 00:59:45,994
And that's,
that's the pathway to the transcendence 

1262
00:59:47,841 --> 00:59:48,674
of tragedy,
which is a much like comparing just 

1263
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:52,820
affirmation.
It's like,

1264
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:53,983
it's,

1265
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,513
you're giving a starving,
you're giving a thirsty person dust to 

1266
01:00:01,371 --> 01:00:02,380
drink.
Hmm.

1267
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,460
There's nothing to it.
You know,

1268
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:05,323
people,
it's the people have to commit to being 

1269
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:12,800
in order to withstand their own 
vulnerability and fragility.

1270
01:00:12,801 --> 01:00:15,080
And,
and essentially flawed nature.

1271
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:16,663
The way that you tolerate them is to,
the way you stand up underneath that is 

1272
01:00:19,731 --> 01:00:24,050
to adapt responsibility for it and then 
your pathways clear.

1273
01:00:24,051 --> 01:00:24,884
Then you can tolerate who you are and 
then you won't hate humanity because 

1274
01:00:28,161 --> 01:00:30,950
people hate humanity.
You hear the environmentalists,

1275
01:00:30,951 --> 01:00:32,870
the radical environmental is say such 
things.

1276
01:00:32,871 --> 01:00:33,704
I've heard people say this,
the planet would be better off without 

1277
01:00:35,991 --> 01:00:37,040
people on it.
It's like,

1278
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:37,874
well,
let's keep you away from the hydrogen 

1279
01:00:39,321 --> 01:00:41,930
bombs.
Shall we know when people think that's a

1280
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:42,764
virtuous statement,
the planet would be better off without 

1281
01:00:44,931 --> 01:00:45,820
people on.
It's like,

1282
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,990
that's,
that's what you're saying.

1283
01:00:47,991 --> 01:00:49,070
It's like,
I see.

1284
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:51,530
You don't think it's okay to be racially
genocidal,

1285
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:53,630
but it's perfectly fine to just wipe out
all of them.

1286
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:54,673
That's okay.
As long as you're not selective about 

1287
01:00:56,451 --> 01:00:58,130
it.
So we,

1288
01:00:58,131 --> 01:00:58,880
we,
we're,

1289
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,440
we're,
we're nourishing.

1290
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:02,690
People were nourishing young people on 
nothing.

1291
01:01:02,970 --> 01:01:04,070
Hmm.
It's nothing.

1292
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,250
It's like they're suffering and no 
wonder because life is suffering.

1293
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:08,213
Right.
That's the first thing you learn if 

1294
01:01:08,841 --> 01:01:11,930
you're on the road to wisdom,
life is suffering.

1295
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,540
Right.
And is it someone's fault?

1296
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,860
Yeah,
sure.

1297
01:01:15,861 --> 01:01:17,750
It's Society's fault.
It's your fault.

1298
01:01:17,751 --> 01:01:19,700
It's nature's fault.
It's God's fault.

1299
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,331
It's like,
yeah,

1300
01:01:20,331 --> 01:01:21,560
the faults everywhere,
man.

1301
01:01:21,830 --> 01:01:26,780
So what are you gonna do about that?
Bear up under it and do something useful

1302
01:01:27,290 --> 01:01:29,990
and then you can respect yourself at 
least to some degree.

1303
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:32,240
At least you're not contributing to the 
problem.

1304
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:33,201
Yeah.
You know?

1305
01:01:33,201 --> 01:01:34,034
And then maybe you can start to see the 
beauty in life and the possibility in 

1306
01:01:36,471 --> 01:01:38,990
life and the majesty in life and the,
and the,

1307
01:01:38,991 --> 01:01:43,600
and the incredible capacity of human 
beings for self transformation here.

1308
01:01:43,610 --> 01:01:44,600
Here's an example.
We've,

1309
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:48,800
we've learned this relatively recently 
and at a neuro biological level,

1310
01:01:48,801 --> 01:01:51,740
you know,
so there's been an idea,

1311
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:55,760
psychological idea that's floated around
for quite a long time,

1312
01:01:55,761 --> 01:01:56,594
a clinical idea that you expand your 
character by aggregating diverse 

1313
01:02:00,471 --> 01:02:01,580
experiences,
right?

1314
01:02:01,581 --> 01:02:04,430
It's sort of the journey everywhere to 
become who you are.

1315
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:08,120
And you can think about that from,
from a Piagetian perspective,

1316
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:10,310
a constructivist perspective and say,
well,

1317
01:02:10,311 --> 01:02:12,560
the more places you journey to in the 
world,

1318
01:02:12,561 --> 01:02:14,720
the more information you expose yourself
to.

1319
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:15,733
And then you take in that information 
and inform yourself with it and you 

1320
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:19,993
develop yourself.
Because you're more differentiated than 

1321
01:02:21,841 --> 01:02:23,580
you have a more differentiated view of 
the world.

1322
01:02:23,581 --> 01:02:24,414
It's like the basic idea is the world is
a pool of information that you can use 

1323
01:02:27,691 --> 01:02:30,030
to construct yourself out event to 
construct the world.

1324
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:33,330
And that's a lovely doctrine and I,
I believe that to be the case,

1325
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,040
but there's more to it than that.

1326
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,950
You know,
we know now that if you take someone and

1327
01:02:37,951 --> 01:02:40,020
you put them in in radically new 
situation,

1328
01:02:40,021 --> 01:02:43,920
that new genes turn on in their,
in their brain at the micro,

1329
01:02:43,921 --> 01:02:44,754
at the,
at the,

1330
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:48,720
at the microlevel new,
new new genetic structure's code for new

1331
01:02:48,721 --> 01:02:49,554
proteins and build new structures.
It's like you're actually a pool of 

1332
01:02:52,381 --> 01:02:53,214
biological possibility and the only way 
that you can determine the full extent 

1333
01:02:57,001 --> 01:02:58,350
of that,
of that pool,

1334
01:02:58,351 --> 01:03:02,100
of the possibility of that pool is by 
pushing yourself out against the world.

1335
01:03:02,101 --> 01:03:04,200
And that will physiologically transform 
you.

1336
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,480
And we have no idea what the limits to 
that are.

1337
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,970
We know in clinical psychology that you 
know,

1338
01:03:08,971 --> 01:03:09,804
what you do with people is expose them 
to the things that they're afraid of 

1339
01:03:11,971 --> 01:03:14,820
vendor or avoiding.
You don't make them less afraid by doing

1340
01:03:14,821 --> 01:03:16,110
that,
you make them braver.

1341
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:18,120
That's why it generalizes,
right?

1342
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,140
They don't come out saying,
oh,

1343
01:03:19,141 --> 01:03:19,974
the world's safe.
It's like once you've learned that the 

1344
01:03:21,541 --> 01:03:22,950
world is safe,
not safe,

1345
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:23,873
there is no going back.
That's the post traumatic stress 

1346
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,920
disorder conundrum.
There is no going back.

1347
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:32,280
But what you can learn is yes,
the world is terribly dangerous,

1348
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:33,263
far more dangerous than you think.
And people are far more malevolent than 

1349
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:39,360
you likely have the imagination to,
to conceptualize.

1350
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:41,970
But there is really more to you than you
know.

1351
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:45,450
And if you wouldn't look for safe spaces
and retreat,

1352
01:03:45,630 --> 01:03:49,260
if you would push out in the world and 
accept your responsibility and,

1353
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:50,263
and confront your limitations,
then you would discover all sorts of 

1354
01:03:52,741 --> 01:03:54,630
things about you that you have no idea 
about.

1355
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:55,763
And then you would transform it to 
something that's far more than what you 

1356
01:03:57,661 --> 01:03:58,494
are.
And,

1357
01:03:58,520 --> 01:03:59,353
and,
and it's in that process of continual 

1358
01:04:00,931 --> 01:04:04,050
transformation that you'll actually find
the essential meaning of life.

1359
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:05,790
So,
and again,

1360
01:04:05,791 --> 01:04:07,140
this is,
it's not like,

1361
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:10,440
it's not like we don't know this.
Everyone knows this.

1362
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:11,783
So,
and the universities in some sense 

1363
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:13,873
supposed to remind you of this,
but they've abdicated their 

1364
01:04:16,441 --> 01:04:17,274
responsibility as far as I'm concerned.
And in many cases are working counter 

1365
01:04:20,121 --> 01:04:20,954
productively.
They're trying to teach young people 

1366
01:04:22,201 --> 01:04:23,034
that they're,
that they're helpless victims who need 

1367
01:04:25,231 --> 01:04:29,370
to restructure society in order.
I don't know,

1368
01:04:29,371 --> 01:04:31,110
I can't even say it anymore.
It's so,

1369
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:33,120
it's so empty and dad,
it's,

1370
01:04:33,121 --> 01:04:33,691
it's,
it's,

1371
01:04:33,691 --> 01:04:35,260
it's,
it's Ah,

1372
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:37,990
you know,
I think I read this and,

1373
01:04:37,991 --> 01:04:39,870
and uh,
Eli is Canadian,

1374
01:04:39,871 --> 01:04:42,600
a book called crowds and power.
And it was one of the things that really

1375
01:04:42,601 --> 01:04:45,120
stuck in my imagination.
He did an atom,

1376
01:04:45,121 --> 01:04:49,830
a logical analysis of the word slogan,
and he said that it was derived from the

1377
01:04:49,831 --> 01:04:50,740
wealth,
uh,

1378
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:53,810
two words slew ag es,
El you a,

1379
01:04:53,811 --> 01:04:57,090
g h and Gerome,
g h a,

1380
01:04:57,091 --> 01:04:57,661
I,
r.

1381
01:04:57,661 --> 01:05:00,270
M.
And it meant battle cry of the dead.

1382
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:01,583
And that really struck me because I,
I've always had this sense that people 

1383
01:05:04,501 --> 01:05:07,020
mouthing ideologies are the puppets of 
corpses.

1384
01:05:07,021 --> 01:05:07,854
It's something like that.
Puppets of corpses of level and 

1385
01:05:10,351 --> 01:05:13,890
philosophers now,
and they speak in dead tones and they're

1386
01:05:13,891 --> 01:05:14,724
not interesting.
Like if you're listening to an Indian 

1387
01:05:16,381 --> 01:05:18,040
log of rattle,
you can hardly

1388
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,680
concentrate on what they're saying 
because it's bad.

1389
01:05:20,681 --> 01:05:25,240
It's death itself speaking again and it 
compels zero interest.

1390
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,640
And so even discussing this sort of 
thing,

1391
01:05:27,641 --> 01:05:28,474
I find difficult to even formulate the 
words because I'm so tired of that kind 

1392
01:05:32,081 --> 01:05:35,170
of that realm of that realm of 
discourse.

1393
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,273
It's like with,
there's so many tremendous things that 

1394
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:41,500
are remaining in the world for people to
do with,

1395
01:05:41,501 --> 01:05:44,230
they stopped being dead puppets of,
of,

1396
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:49,231
of sick ideas.
It's appalling to me that it even has,

1397
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:52,360
and the opposition to that even has to 
be justified.

1398
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:55,450
Our entire civilization is opposition to
that.

1399
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:56,681
And so,
I mean,

1400
01:05:56,681 --> 01:05:57,514
we can let it go if we want,
but the alternatives are far gloomier 

1401
01:05:59,801 --> 01:06:01,720
than what we have now.
I can tell you that.

1402
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:05,980
So we can let it all go and we're being 
taught to let it all go.

1403
01:06:05,981 --> 01:06:07,360
It's corrupt.
It's rotten,

1404
01:06:07,361 --> 01:06:10,210
right to the roots.
It needs to be retooled late to the very

1405
01:06:10,211 --> 01:06:11,860
concepts that we use.
It's like,

1406
01:06:11,861 --> 01:06:13,210
yeah,
what's going to replace it?

1407
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:16,990
What have we got this better?
You've got nothing that's better.

1408
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,620
What we have is something that could be 
far more than it is if people would just

1409
01:06:20,621 --> 01:06:24,760
take it to the level that it could be 
taken to and everyone wants to hear that

1410
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:27,760
and then we're all nuts.
It's been a very long answer.

1411
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:32,470
This is why 91% of the people that are 
watching my lectures are man as far as I

1412
01:06:32,471 --> 01:06:33,304
can tell.
Hmm.

1413
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:34,070
So

1414
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:34,903
that could be something we have time for
one or two more questions then we might 

1415
01:06:36,471 --> 01:06:39,200
open it up to q and.
A one more question according to connor.

1416
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:40,443
Um,
I don't want to end with it cause you 

1417
01:06:41,721 --> 01:06:42,554
were talking about your experience as a 
clinical psychologist and I'm wondering 

1418
01:06:45,111 --> 01:06:50,111
if you have any advice for students on 
general topics of like mental health,

1419
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:53,990
wellness at college.
In a lot of ways,

1420
01:06:53,991 --> 01:06:58,100
I think you have claimed that by finding
more purpose,

1421
01:06:58,101 --> 01:06:58,934
by finding more meaning by contributing,
one can develop more tolerance for 

1422
01:07:02,421 --> 01:07:04,940
oneself.
One can develop more self affirmation.

1423
01:07:05,090 --> 01:07:07,340
I'm wondering though,
if you think there are cases where there

1424
01:07:07,341 --> 01:07:08,174
are people with a lot of potential,
especially at Harvard who may doubt 

1425
01:07:10,881 --> 01:07:12,950
their abilities,
who may get quite anxious.

1426
01:07:12,951 --> 01:07:16,180
I'm sure you've interacted with students
with um,

1427
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:19,460
clients as a clinician.
How do you,

1428
01:07:19,490 --> 01:07:20,323
what advice do you give them or what do 
you think college students should know 

1429
01:07:21,711 --> 01:07:25,010
about enhancing their psychological 
wellbeing at college?

1430
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:30,250
We've done,
we've done some research on that topic.

1431
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:31,323
I mean,
one of the things that really seems to 

1432
01:07:32,711 --> 01:07:36,130
help is to write out your plans for the 
future.

1433
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:37,503
We have a program,
an online program called future 

1434
01:07:39,521 --> 01:07:40,354
authoring that we've used with Oh 10,000
university students now and raise their 

1435
01:07:43,811 --> 01:07:47,620
grade point average 25% drop their 
dropout rate by about the same.

1436
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:48,943
Uh,
it particularly works well for men who 

1437
01:07:50,921 --> 01:07:53,170
are generally underperforming women now.
And so that,

1438
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:57,760
I think it's raising them up and it also
works spectacularly well for non Western

1439
01:07:57,761 --> 01:07:58,594
ethnic minority men,
which was also extraordinarily positive 

1440
01:08:01,031 --> 01:08:02,200
because you know,
that's,

1441
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:07,060
that's well that that was a great 
unexpected outcome.

1442
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:12,190
But in some of it is to aim at something
that's worth aiming out.

1443
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:13,123
Yeah.
And,

1444
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:16,370
and how do you determine what's worth 
aiming out?

1445
01:08:16,371 --> 01:08:16,941
You think,
well,

1446
01:08:16,941 --> 01:08:20,210
okay,
here I have my miserable wretched life.

1447
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:21,313
Under what conditions would it justify 
itself as far as I'm concerned 

1448
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,600
personally?
Like under what conditions would my life

1449
01:08:26,601 --> 01:08:28,270
justify itself?
And so you,

1450
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:29,001
you think,
well,

1451
01:08:29,001 --> 01:08:32,030
what sort of future would I have to have
so that I can say this is worth it.

1452
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:34,310
And then that's what you aim for.
And that,

1453
01:08:34,570 --> 01:08:38,240
and technically that works in part 
because we know that most of the systems

1454
01:08:38,241 --> 01:08:40,370
that mediate positive emotion and human 
beings,

1455
01:08:40,371 --> 01:08:41,204
and so those would be the dopaminergic 
systems that have their roots in the 

1456
01:08:43,131 --> 01:08:48,050
hypothalamic exploratory centers are 
activated in relationship to the pursuit

1457
01:08:48,051 --> 01:08:48,884
of a goal,
not as a consequence of attaining 

1458
01:08:50,421 --> 01:08:52,610
something that's a conservatory reward 
system.

1459
01:08:52,611 --> 01:08:54,800
But human beings mostly run on incentive
reward.

1460
01:08:55,190 --> 01:08:57,530
And so it appears that the higher the 
goal,

1461
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:58,633
the more kick you get from,
from noting your progress towards that 

1462
01:09:02,241 --> 01:09:03,074
goal.
Now you have to be careful because you 

1463
01:09:04,011 --> 01:09:04,844
don't want to pick a goal that's so 
impossible that all you ever do is fail 

1464
01:09:07,401 --> 01:09:08,450
in relationship to it.

1465
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:10,930
That's an issue of self management,
right?

1466
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:12,013
You want to,
you want to pick a goal that moves you 

1467
01:09:13,461 --> 01:09:14,294
to the next plateau that you have a 
reasonable prob a reasonable but not 

1468
01:09:18,261 --> 01:09:20,600
certain probability of attaining.
So that's,

1469
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:24,020
that's part of it is to,
is to formulate a plan to decide who,

1470
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:26,360
who it is,
what it is that you want to be,

1471
01:09:26,361 --> 01:09:29,090
who it is that you want to be from a 
character logical perspective.

1472
01:09:29,091 --> 01:09:31,160
And if you're having other problems.
Well,

1473
01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:34,340
you know,
some of that is when you're talking more

1474
01:09:34,341 --> 01:09:37,730
on the clinical end of things is that,
again,

1475
01:09:37,731 --> 01:09:40,700
the devil's in the details,
but it's useful to talk to people.

1476
01:09:40,701 --> 01:09:43,070
It's useful to write about what it is 
that you're up to it.

1477
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:43,993
But it's,
it's most worthwhile to organize your 

1478
01:09:45,741 --> 01:09:46,670
life,
I would say.

1479
01:09:46,671 --> 01:09:50,030
And to,
and to pick a goal into a mad it that's,

1480
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:52,880
that's a very nice way of starting to 
straighten things out for yourself.

1481
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:54,650
So,
but I mean,

1482
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,410
I would also say like I've had many 
clients,

1483
01:09:57,411 --> 01:10:00,020
I often advocate the use of 
antidepressants.

1484
01:10:00,021 --> 01:10:00,854
I mean people for example,
people have all sorts of physiological 

1485
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:06,770
problems that compromise their movement 
forward.

1486
01:10:06,771 --> 01:10:07,604
And those have to be addressed.
I'm not saying that you can lift 

1487
01:10:09,231 --> 01:10:12,320
yourself up by your bootstraps in every 
possible situation.

1488
01:10:12,321 --> 01:10:16,010
I know that not be true.
You take whatever interventions you need

1489
01:10:16,011 --> 01:10:18,890
in order to allow yourself to continue 
moving forward in the world.

1490
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:20,143
But you know,
and what do you do to try to set 

1491
01:10:23,001 --> 01:10:23,781
yourself up?
Well,

1492
01:10:23,781 --> 01:10:27,830
I have some friends that's helpful.
Have an intimate relationship.

1493
01:10:27,831 --> 01:10:29,660
Try to make one that's reasonably 
permanent.

1494
01:10:29,661 --> 01:10:30,494
That's helpful.
Aim at having a family and children aim 

1495
01:10:32,541 --> 01:10:33,374
at being useful to the community and 
turning yourself into something that's 

1496
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:40,160
noble and respectable and powerful and,
and that'll,

1497
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:42,740
that'll help you orient yourself when 
you're young.

1498
01:10:42,740 --> 01:10:45,980
And because you'll start to see that you
could have a life that was worth living,

1499
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:47,143
that you could be not proud of.
That's the wrong way of thinking about 

1500
01:10:49,791 --> 01:10:53,600
it,
but that you could live in the right way

1501
01:10:53,601 --> 01:10:57,710
of phrasing it is that you could live in
a manner that justifies the fragility of

1502
01:10:57,711 --> 01:11:00,110
being.
That's the right way to think about it.

1503
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:04,040
That's the right way to think about 
because the fragility of being is a very

1504
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:04,874
powerful argument against its existence 
and that's been recognized by that was 

1505
01:11:09,711 --> 01:11:10,544
that that was,
that's the fundamental ethical dilemma 

1506
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:14,790
investigated by Gurth F for example,
in his,

1507
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:15,853
in his play foxed because Mephistopheles
is the mouthpiece of everyone who says 

1508
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:20,483
being is so fragile that it should be 
eradicated because it produces too much 

1509
01:11:23,401 --> 01:11:24,234
suffering.
It's Ivan chromosomes argumenting in 

1510
01:11:26,351 --> 01:11:27,184
the,
in the brothers Karamazov it's a very 

1511
01:11:28,141 --> 01:11:28,974
powerful argument.
Why should any of this be an announcer 

1512
01:11:31,471 --> 01:11:34,840
is you justify it by how it is that by 
how you exist,

1513
01:11:34,841 --> 01:11:35,674
you justify being by how you choose to 
exist and you can choose to exist in a 

1514
01:11:39,871 --> 01:11:43,650
manner that produces absolutely no 
justification whatsoever for being quite

1515
01:11:43,651 --> 01:11:45,810
the contrary.
But that's,

1516
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:49,280
that's not a pathway that I would 
recommend.

1517
01:11:49,281 --> 01:11:50,220
Yeah.
Thank you.

1518
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:52,133
My pleasure.

1519
01:11:53,170 --> 01:11:58,170
[inaudible]

1520
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:10,670
okay.
All right.

1521
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:13,310
So we have some questions I think from 
the audience.

1522
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:15,980
Um,
and I'm just going to read them in order

1523
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:19,700
and you're going to answer com.
Pretty simple.

1524
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:24,170
So our first question we have here 
reads,

1525
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:25,093
I'm a postdoc in the psychology 
department and I'm very interested in 

1526
01:12:28,251 --> 01:12:29,084
conducting research,
examining the extent to which highly 

1527
01:12:31,911 --> 01:12:36,200
politically correct individuals are 
analytical in parentheses or not.

1528
01:12:36,650 --> 01:12:37,483
I am however very concerned that this 
pursuit will potentially flip to the 

1529
01:12:42,111 --> 01:12:42,944
back proved to be quite damaging to my 
reputation and that it will likely 

1530
01:12:46,671 --> 01:12:49,520
hinder my chances of obtaining a faculty
position.

1531
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:51,110
Do you have any advice for them?

1532
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:52,453
Yeah,
I talked to talk to the members all the 

1533
01:12:55,101 --> 01:12:56,870
time and they,
and they see the same thing.

1534
01:12:58,220 --> 01:12:59,053
I'll say what I think when I get my 
first job and then they get their first 

1535
01:13:02,241 --> 01:13:02,931
job and they say,
well,

1536
01:13:02,931 --> 01:13:04,730
I'll say what I think when I,
when I,

1537
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:05,750
when I'm,
when I'm,

1538
01:13:05,810 --> 01:13:06,643
when I have tenure.
And then they get tenure and it's like 

1539
01:13:08,690 --> 01:13:10,550
15 years later,
10 years later.

1540
01:13:10,551 --> 01:13:11,384
And they don't have anything left to say
because they haven't said anything for 

1541
01:13:13,161 --> 01:13:14,930
the last 10 years.
And it's like,

1542
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:16,430
that's no way to live,
man.

1543
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:19,100
That's no way to live.
It's do your damn research.

1544
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:23,330
Pick the hardest topic you can possibly 
imagine and pursue it and state what you

1545
01:13:23,331 --> 01:13:25,460
believe to be the truth.
And let me see,

1546
01:13:25,461 --> 01:13:26,720
there's a rule.
There's a rule.

1547
01:13:26,721 --> 01:13:28,510
This is an existential rule.
And in Sweden,

1548
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:30,590
one we're really worth thinking about 
because it,

1549
01:13:30,650 --> 01:13:31,483
it's,
it's a pointer to a fundamental mode of 

1550
01:13:33,231 --> 01:13:36,560
being.
So one mode of being involved using your

1551
01:13:36,561 --> 01:13:39,490
speech strategically.
And that's exactly what it is.

1552
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:41,870
Questions about this,
this person is basically asking,

1553
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:46,130
should I use my ability to communicate 
strategically and strategically?

1554
01:13:46,131 --> 01:13:46,964
Is,
should I aim at getting the job I want 

1555
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:52,160
with my actions?
Well,

1556
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:55,430
the answer to that is it's better than 
not aiming at anything.

1557
01:13:55,550 --> 01:13:56,650
So that's one answer.
And,

1558
01:13:56,651 --> 01:13:57,230
and,
and,

1559
01:13:57,230 --> 01:13:58,940
and it's a reasonable answer.
But here's,

1560
01:13:58,950 --> 01:14:03,290
here's a different answer.
This is a fundamental dilemma of faith.

1561
01:14:03,291 --> 01:14:04,124
I would say

1562
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:08,253
the fundamental dilemma of faith is 
whether or not you should live by the 

1563
01:14:10,121 --> 01:14:11,140
truth.
Hmm.

1564
01:14:11,770 --> 01:14:12,220
And

1565
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:13,053
you determined to live by the truth.
When you make the decision that if you 

1566
01:14:17,351 --> 01:14:18,184
tell the truth,
the outcome is the best possible 

1567
01:14:19,811 --> 01:14:21,850
outcome.
You see,

1568
01:14:21,851 --> 01:14:24,910
that's an existential decision,
right?

1569
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:25,773
And it's predicated on,
it's predicated on something like faith 

1570
01:14:28,301 --> 01:14:29,134
in the fundamental nature of being.
Because if you allow yourself to the 

1571
01:14:32,231 --> 01:14:36,340
degree that you can with the truth,
then what you're doing is acting out the

1572
01:14:36,341 --> 01:14:37,174
proposition that being is structured in 
the best possible manner because 

1573
01:14:40,181 --> 01:14:41,014
otherwise you wouldn't ally yourself 
with the truth and if you decided to 

1574
01:14:43,481 --> 01:14:47,140
ally yourself with the truth and you act
in a manner of commensurate with that,

1575
01:14:47,141 --> 01:14:50,830
then your life will unfold in a 
particular way and you have to take your

1576
01:14:50,831 --> 01:14:52,480
chances if you're going to live like 
that.

1577
01:14:52,481 --> 01:14:54,610
But the advantage to that is that,
well,

1578
01:14:54,611 --> 01:14:55,444
one advantage is you don't compromise 
yourself and maybe you don't want to 

1579
01:14:58,271 --> 01:14:59,104
compromise yourself because yourself is 
what you have to stave off the 

1580
01:15:03,521 --> 01:15:05,110
catastrophe of being.

1581
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:05,943
And if you compromise that,
then you have nothing except perhaps 

1582
01:15:08,021 --> 01:15:10,960
what other people will give you.
It's a pathway to weakness.

1583
01:15:11,170 --> 01:15:13,240
Now I have a graduate student.
As it happens,

1584
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:14,373
who is doing exactly that?
We started doing empirical analysis of 

1585
01:15:16,601 --> 01:15:19,300
politically correct beliefs and it's 
been absolutely fascinating.

1586
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:21,490
First of all,
they do cohere.

1587
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:23,200
So the way we did it was we,
we,

1588
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:24,053
we collected about 400 statements that 
were deemed by people in the press and 

1589
01:15:28,301 --> 01:15:31,420
so forth as indicative of politically 
correct belief.

1590
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,433
We did that agnostically and this is a 
standard standard construct validation 

1591
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:39,490
process in psychology is that if you 
want to find out if something exists,

1592
01:15:39,491 --> 01:15:44,491
he wanted to find out if the elements of
that that entity say a domain of beliefs

1593
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:47,410
covariates such that if you hold one 
belief,

1594
01:15:47,411 --> 01:15:49,270
you're much more likely to hold another 
belief.

1595
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:54,240
And so then you can pile up the beliefs 
that are likely to occur if one occurs.

1596
01:15:54,490 --> 01:15:55,323
And the the,
the essential way to do that is to 

1597
01:15:56,981 --> 01:15:57,814
oversample the domain of beliefs,
subject them to a factor analysis and 

1598
01:16:00,941 --> 01:16:04,060
see how they cohere.
And we found that there were two factors

1599
01:16:04,061 --> 01:16:06,970
that were associated with the 
politically correct belief and that they

1600
01:16:06,971 --> 01:16:07,804
were very powerfully predicted by 
personality and most particularly by 

1601
01:16:09,971 --> 01:16:10,804
trait agreeableness,
which was not a predictor of 

1602
01:16:12,821 --> 01:16:15,790
conservatism or liberalism particularly,
but,

1603
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:19,450
but more to the point,
the student who's doing that,

1604
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:20,740
uh,
her name is,

1605
01:16:20,830 --> 01:16:23,800
her name is Christine brophy.
She's very brave girl,

1606
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:25,180
very,
very tough girl.

1607
01:16:25,570 --> 01:16:27,310
And uh,
she's,

1608
01:16:27,610 --> 01:16:31,960
she's pursued this forthrightly and it's
led to nothing but opportunity,

1609
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:34,810
crazy amounts of opportunity.
Now it's a tough road to hoe.

1610
01:16:34,811 --> 01:16:35,644
She knows perfectly well.
She's not going to be very popular in 

1611
01:16:37,271 --> 01:16:38,230
certain domains,
but,

1612
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:39,393
but,
but that's no reason not to pursue 

1613
01:16:41,171 --> 01:16:42,640
something.
The issue is,

1614
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:45,010
are you interested in it?
Do you want to find out the truth?

1615
01:16:45,011 --> 01:16:47,890
Are you willing to pursue it?
And Are you willing to stake yourself on

1616
01:16:47,891 --> 01:16:48,900
that?
And if,

1617
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:49,783
if the answer is no,
then you're not willing to stake 

1618
01:16:51,521 --> 01:16:52,354
yourself on yourself.
And then God help you because you'll 

1619
01:16:55,001 --> 01:16:58,180
have to be given something by someone 
else to stake yourself on.

1620
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:02,410
And they can always take it away.
So it's like don't be thinking,

1621
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:05,530
don't be thinking politically about your
career.

1622
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:07,750
It's foolish.
It doesn't work.

1623
01:17:07,870 --> 01:17:10,070
It really doesn't work.
You'll be second rate

1624
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:10,903
at fast,
you'll be second rate and frightened at 

1625
01:17:12,681 --> 01:17:13,514
fast.
You'll never hit the top ranks if you 

1626
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,240
perform like that.
And having said that,

1627
01:17:17,241 --> 01:17:21,410
I would also say don't be an idiot.
Don't make unnecessary enemies.

1628
01:17:21,411 --> 01:17:22,244
Right?
I mean there's no point in making 

1629
01:17:23,841 --> 01:17:25,520
unnecessary enemies.
That's,

1630
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:29,330
that's not wise.
But don't sell yourself short.

1631
01:17:29,331 --> 01:17:30,164
You know,
you might be on the cutting edge of an 

1632
01:17:31,011 --> 01:17:34,250
entire new domain of psychology if you 
actually get it right.

1633
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:38,750
And so maybe you won't be popular among 
your superiors for the time being.

1634
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:39,703
You can't talk to the people who are 
above you in the dominance hierarchy 

1635
01:17:41,211 --> 01:17:42,590
anyways.
It's awesome.

1636
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:43,633
You can barely talk laterally.
You pretty much have to broadcast your 

1637
01:17:45,981 --> 01:17:49,280
message down.
And so the fact that,

1638
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:51,610
well enough said about that.
No,

1639
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:52,453
it's a bad idea.
Pursue your damn research and tell the 

1640
01:17:54,021 --> 01:17:56,390
truth about it and let the chips fall 
where they will.

1641
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:57,253
Well,
you're much better protected that way 

1642
01:17:58,131 --> 01:18:00,170
then by doing anything else.
Second question,

1643
01:18:00,430 --> 01:18:01,263
how have university has been ruined by 
Marxism or rather by the massive growth 

1644
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:09,290
of student life bureaucracies that seek 
to train rather than educate.

1645
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:11,293
They haven't been completely ruined,
but the humanities and the social 

1646
01:18:13,551 --> 01:18:14,780
sciences are both in trouble.

1647
01:18:16,210 --> 01:18:17,043
Oh,
hi.

1648
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:23,063
Could you please speak to the legitimacy
of Harvard's decision to penalize 

1649
01:18:26,401 --> 01:18:27,234
students for being part of single gender
organizations that are not officially 

1650
01:18:30,751 --> 01:18:32,700
recognized by the university?
Uh,

1651
01:18:32,940 --> 01:18:33,990
for example,
fraternities,

1652
01:18:33,991 --> 01:18:35,250
sororities,
and final clubs.

1653
01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:36,743
It's cowardly.

1654
01:18:37,350 --> 01:18:38,183
Hm.

1655
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:41,010
It's cowardly.
It's politically correct.

1656
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:42,133
It's,
it interferes with freedom of 

1657
01:18:42,961 --> 01:18:43,794
association.
So I would think they would have more 

1658
01:18:46,921 --> 01:18:49,950
important things to do.
All right.

1659
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:55,940
Do you think,
do you think that victim hood narratives

1660
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:02,283
and critiques of oppression,
which make up much of the political 

1661
01:19:04,751 --> 01:19:05,584
discussion on college campuses are a 
symptom of a psychological need to 

1662
01:19:10,990 --> 01:19:11,823
deflect guilt because of,
because of a lack of another better 

1663
01:19:17,081 --> 01:19:18,160
method of redemption?

1664
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:21,150
Yeah,
I think that is part of it.

1665
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:22,740
I mean,
because I don't,

1666
01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:24,000
I don't,
it's not,

1667
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:29,840
I'm speaking more strongly in some sense
then perhaps would be optimal.

1668
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:35,660
Partly because time is short.
I know that young people have a mess.

1669
01:19:36,831 --> 01:19:37,664
I,
Yanik urge Piaget actually identified 

1670
01:19:40,771 --> 01:19:43,410
that as,
as part of the developmental process,

1671
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:44,553
uh,
that that was the typified late 

1672
01:19:46,771 --> 01:19:50,820
adolescence
and it's admirable in many ways.

1673
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:56,870
It needs to be directed in the most 
powerful possible,

1674
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:01,500
powerful,
prosocial manner possible.

1675
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,050
And that's what the university should be
doing.

1676
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:09,570
And by training students to be noisy,
ill informed,

1677
01:20:09,571 --> 01:20:13,680
historically ignorant agitators,
narcissistic agitators,

1678
01:20:13,681 --> 01:20:17,370
let's add that they're doing them a 
tremendous disservice.

1679
01:20:17,371 --> 01:20:18,204
Like when I was at mcmaster for example,
where the last very vocal protest 

1680
01:20:21,691 --> 01:20:25,470
occurred mostly what I felt about the 
protesters with sorrow.

1681
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:26,311
Cause I,
you know,

1682
01:20:26,311 --> 01:20:27,360
I looked out there,
I saw,

1683
01:20:27,361 --> 01:20:28,860
well there's these,
there young people,

1684
01:20:28,861 --> 01:20:29,694
they're university students,
they're because they went to university 

1685
01:20:30,931 --> 01:20:34,470
at least in principle to learn something
about themselves and about the world.

1686
01:20:34,471 --> 01:20:36,810
And instead they've been transformed 
into these.

1687
01:20:36,811 --> 01:20:39,960
Like they were chanting,
they were chanting like

1688
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:41,513
wow

1689
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:43,583
profanities at me.
And really that's a best you can do 

1690
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:47,933
your,
if come out and you're dopey little 

1691
01:20:48,631 --> 01:20:50,610
group,
you'll hide behind the hammer and sickle

1692
01:20:50,611 --> 01:20:54,000
because of one of your fashionable 
professors convinced you that was a good

1693
01:20:54,001 --> 01:20:54,834
idea.
And the best you can do is organize 

1694
01:20:56,251 --> 01:20:59,580
yourself and chant profanities at me.
You know,

1695
01:21:00,150 --> 01:21:02,010
it's so sad.
These are,

1696
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:03,023
these are,
we can be doing something better than 

1697
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:05,993
that.
I mean card come out and they have a 

1698
01:21:08,131 --> 01:21:11,160
useful protest of some sort.
At least if you're going to come out and

1699
01:21:11,161 --> 01:21:11,994
protest,
make it a high quality protest stead of 

1700
01:21:14,251 --> 01:21:15,084
like cursing at me in repetitively.
So dowel and unimaginative and and 

1701
01:21:20,791 --> 01:21:22,380
pathetic.
And so,

1702
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:25,950
no,

1703
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:27,210
I forgot what the question was.

1704
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:32,560
Eight more.
Okay.

1705
01:21:34,470 --> 01:21:35,303
Five minutes.
In cases where people have sworn 

1706
01:21:37,561 --> 01:21:38,394
chastity throughout life,
under voluntary and noncoercive 

1707
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:41,873
circumstances,
is it possible to still develop fully 

1708
01:21:44,220 --> 01:21:45,053
and not suffer from the consequences of 
having never undergone sexual 

1709
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:50,550
maturation?
If so,

1710
01:21:50,551 --> 01:21:53,010
how is it possible?
Wow,

1711
01:21:55,460 --> 01:21:57,490
I didn't expect that one.
I can tell Ya.

1712
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:02,930
Sometimes people have to make a 
sacrifice,

1713
01:22:03,770 --> 01:22:04,820
right?
And

1714
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:09,560
everyone always has to make sacrifices.
That's actually something that I learned

1715
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:11,083
from reading mythology because the 
ancient myths always talk about 

1716
01:22:14,601 --> 01:22:17,600
sacrificing people claim not to 
understand what that means.

1717
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:22,400
You always have to let go of something 
in order to progress into the future.

1718
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:24,193
In fact,
that's the most fundamental discovery 

1719
01:22:25,311 --> 01:22:27,170
human beings ever made as far as I can 
tell,

1720
01:22:27,171 --> 01:22:28,004
because it's,
it's exactly the same thing as 

1721
01:22:29,211 --> 01:22:31,940
discovering the future.
And we discovered the future,

1722
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:34,130
right?
We're the only creatures that we know of

1723
01:22:34,131 --> 01:22:34,964
who really can conceive of the future 
and the future is something that's made 

1724
01:22:38,001 --> 01:22:40,130
better by letting go of things in the 
present.

1725
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:41,600
Right?
That's impulse control.

1726
01:22:41,601 --> 01:22:43,190
And you can look at it that way if you 
want.

1727
01:22:44,150 --> 01:22:46,910
The person who wrote this is obviously 
wrestling with something,

1728
01:22:46,911 --> 01:22:48,680
you know,
and maybe they're wrestling with a hyper

1729
01:22:48,681 --> 01:22:50,800
dominant sexual impulse that,
that,

1730
01:22:50,810 --> 01:22:51,643
that,
that threatens to be master instead of 

1731
01:22:53,391 --> 01:22:56,450
servant.
And so who knows what they have to do in

1732
01:22:56,451 --> 01:22:57,284
order to bring themselves under control.
I would say that less radical solutions 

1733
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:04,153
might first be advised,
but I can write because you don't have 

1734
01:23:08,531 --> 01:23:09,364
to,
you don't want to whip yourself with a 

1735
01:23:10,331 --> 01:23:12,550
bigger whip then you need to use.
Right.

1736
01:23:12,551 --> 01:23:13,384
And I think that's,
that's minimal necessary force doctrine 

1737
01:23:15,371 --> 01:23:18,040
essentially.
But so yeah,

1738
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:21,280
so that's how I would answer that 
question.

1739
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:23,350
Pretty good if I want.
You weren't expecting

1740
01:23:24,810 --> 01:23:25,643
Dr. Peterson,
you say that the meaning of life is to 

1741
01:23:26,941 --> 01:23:30,060
take an individual responsibility for 
the burdens of existence.

1742
01:23:30,270 --> 01:23:35,270
If each person can justifiably choose 
his own way of taking on these burdens,

1743
01:23:36,090 --> 01:23:36,923
then how can we prevent individuals from
committing actions that are clearly 

1744
01:23:40,411 --> 01:23:41,760
moral injustices?

1745
01:23:43,690 --> 01:23:44,523
Well,
we can't.

1746
01:23:45,090 --> 01:23:46,810
Hmm.
I mean,

1747
01:23:47,530 --> 01:23:51,330
that happens all the time.
I think the best way,

1748
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:53,950
there's all sorts of mechanisms for 
regulating it,

1749
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:54,813
right?
We have all sorts of mechanisms for 

1750
01:23:55,691 --> 01:23:59,920
regulating it.
Civil society and policing regulates it.

1751
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:01,203
Expectations between family members and 
friends regulated your conscience 

1752
01:24:04,421 --> 01:24:05,254
regulates it.

1753
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:06,693
MMM.

1754
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:13,760
But I don't believe that people do.
As a general rule commit illegalities or

1755
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:20,310
or worse because they've taken on 
responsibility.

1756
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:21,353
That isn't how it works.
The pathway to criminality is not to be 

1757
01:24:24,541 --> 01:24:25,374
found in the adoption of responsibility.
You don't say that about criminals 

1758
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:29,343
swallow.
If he would've just taken on a little 

1759
01:24:30,121 --> 01:24:32,910
less responsibility than he wouldn't be 
in jail.

1760
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:33,691
No,
that is now.

1761
01:24:33,691 --> 01:24:34,524
It works.
So what the question is more something 

1762
01:24:37,381 --> 01:24:37,831
like,
well,

1763
01:24:37,831 --> 01:24:40,350
if people are allowed to direct 
themselves,

1764
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:43,770
how do you stop them from picking a path
that's improper?

1765
01:24:43,771 --> 01:24:44,604
And I would say that that,
and I do believe that that's the 

1766
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:47,214
essential question.
And I would say part of that is that if 

1767
01:24:49,321 --> 01:24:53,250
you're going to be self directed,
let's say at least to some degree,

1768
01:24:53,730 --> 01:24:54,563
then you have to tell the truth because 
otherwise you pathologize yourself and 

1769
01:24:58,321 --> 01:25:00,060
you can't rely on your own judgment 
then.

1770
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:00,893
And that that's part of the reason why 
the truth is so necessary is that if 

1771
01:25:02,971 --> 01:25:03,804
you're going to use yourself as the 
mechanism by which you Orient Yourself 

1772
01:25:07,531 --> 01:25:08,364
in the world and you better make sure 
that you're not transforming yourself 

1773
01:25:12,121 --> 01:25:14,280
into something that's predicated on 
error.

1774
01:25:14,970 --> 01:25:16,870
And so,
so the,

1775
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:17,950
the,
uh,

1776
01:25:17,950 --> 01:25:18,783
the,
the attempt to speak the truth is as a 

1777
01:25:20,371 --> 01:25:24,780
form of psychophysiological hygiene.
That's one way of thinking about it.

1778
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:25,973
And if,
if you're oriented as well as you can 

1779
01:25:28,650 --> 01:25:29,483
towards the articulated truth,
then you can increasingly rely on your 

1780
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:33,930
own judgment.
And that's,

1781
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:38,430
and that's the,
that's the best defense say against,

1782
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:40,650
against the dark side.

1783
01:25:43,030 --> 01:25:44,800
You've attached a number of useful 
ideas.

1784
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:47,890
If this is a fun one,
number of useful ideas,

1785
01:25:47,891 --> 01:25:48,724
for instance,
self overcoming personal responsibility 

1786
01:25:51,010 --> 01:25:53,860
to a viral meme,
social justice conflict,

1787
01:25:54,370 --> 01:25:55,203
how can we attach and useful ideas to 
the social justice side of this 

1788
01:25:58,211 --> 01:26:02,860
controversy and convert it into a 
growthful movement for all involved?

1789
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:05,313
Well,
I do think that is what's happening to 

1790
01:26:06,311 --> 01:26:07,144
some degree.
I think that the political dialogue 

1791
01:26:09,761 --> 01:26:14,761
that's emerging is precisely that.
I don't know how we can do it.

1792
01:26:16,230 --> 01:26:21,120
I know what I know how I've been doing 
it to some degree.

1793
01:26:21,810 --> 01:26:24,150
I've been doing it by saying what I 
think

1794
01:26:24,460 --> 01:26:25,293
[inaudible]

1795
01:26:25,570 --> 01:26:27,850
and carefully,
you know,

1796
01:26:28,110 --> 01:26:28,943
and and knowing that I'm prone to error 
and listening to feedback because I 

1797
01:26:32,471 --> 01:26:34,510
would like to know where I'm making 
errors.

1798
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:37,810
I had advisors,
my friends,

1799
01:26:38,350 --> 01:26:39,183
while I was undertaking this who were 
telling me constantly everything I was 

1800
01:26:42,941 --> 01:26:43,774
doing that was second rate and and 
egotistical and careless and all of 

1801
01:26:48,851 --> 01:26:51,940
those things.
And so I would say,

1802
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:54,120
okay.

1803
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:54,953
I would say to some degree,
maybe that question is specified at the 

1804
01:26:57,421 --> 01:26:59,880
wrong level of analysis is that you 
should,

1805
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:00,923
you should learn to articulate what you 
think and that's what you have at your 

1806
01:27:05,131 --> 01:27:05,964
disposal.
And,

1807
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:07,950
and with you people in the audience,
man,

1808
01:27:07,951 --> 01:27:08,784
you've got power at your disposal,
you're all super bright and super 

1809
01:27:10,951 --> 01:27:12,560
conscientious and like,
you know,

1810
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:13,433
your powerhouses,
you might not know it and maybe some of 

1811
01:27:15,511 --> 01:27:17,780
you forgotten that because you'd come to
Harvard and of course,

1812
01:27:17,781 --> 01:27:20,160
so 50% of you are below average at 
Harvard,

1813
01:27:20,190 --> 01:27:21,023
but that doesn't mean that you're not 
like hyper capable cause you're hyper 

1814
01:27:24,391 --> 01:27:25,224
capable.
So get your act together and say what 

1815
01:27:27,001 --> 01:27:28,920
you think.
And that'll do the trick,

1816
01:27:28,950 --> 01:27:29,560
man.
That'll,

1817
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:30,393
that'll,
that'll,

1818
01:27:30,630 --> 01:27:32,610
that'll work just fine.
Dr. Peterson,

1819
01:27:32,611 --> 01:27:34,950
we're running out of time.
So I'm gonna ask you one last question.

1820
01:27:35,070 --> 01:27:35,903
I think it's an important one,
especially for some of the people who 

1821
01:27:38,131 --> 01:27:40,380
don't think you should be speaking here 
today,

1822
01:27:40,650 --> 01:27:43,440
whether some of them are in this room or
some of them were outside earlier.

1823
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:44,813
The question reads,
give an extremely elevated violence and 

1824
01:27:47,131 --> 01:27:47,964
murder rates against trans people.
Why have you chosen to threat in a 

1825
01:27:51,121 --> 01:27:54,450
population that is already facing job 
discrimination,

1826
01:27:54,570 --> 01:27:55,800
murder,
etc.

1827
01:27:57,500 --> 01:27:58,610
Oh,
I'm not threatening them.

1828
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:00,433
I don't think there's any evidence.
The fact that a handful of noisy 

1829
01:28:02,751 --> 01:28:03,584
activists consider me a threat is no 
criteria of proof of any sort of 

1830
01:28:06,861 --> 01:28:09,580
anything.
And I mean so,

1831
01:28:09,610 --> 01:28:11,720
so I just reject that entire,
all,

1832
01:28:11,721 --> 01:28:16,721
every single word in that question is 
meaningless as far as I'm concerned.

1833
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:19,033
So people think,
someone said just because someone said 

1834
01:28:22,791 --> 01:28:23,624
that,
what I said is a threat to trans people 

1835
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:25,873
does not make it true.
And I have the testimony of a fair 

1836
01:28:29,421 --> 01:28:32,810
number of trans people that that's 
actually not only not true.

1837
01:28:32,811 --> 01:28:35,360
It's palpably false.
So,

1838
01:28:35,361 --> 01:28:37,250
sorry,
not guilty.

1839
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:38,433
Hm.

1840
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:42,100
Very Canadian of you to apologize there.
Yeah,

1841
01:28:42,110 --> 01:28:44,180
but not so much to say that I'm not 
guilty,

1842
01:28:47,630 --> 01:28:48,680
I suppose.

1843
01:28:49,940 --> 01:28:54,940
Yeah.
For that.

1844
01:29:03,350 --> 01:29:04,200
Well,
first of all,

1845
01:29:04,201 --> 01:29:06,090
I want,
I don't consider threats of violence,

1846
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:09,540
so we have to be very careful when we 
use our words.

1847
01:29:10,290 --> 01:29:11,123
So,
so someone saying something and 

1848
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:15,750
[inaudible] relatively brief or not the 
same thing.

1849
01:29:16,290 --> 01:29:17,123
And second,
there's no possible way I can answer 

1850
01:29:18,331 --> 01:29:20,850
that question because I know nothing 
about the threats.

1851
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:24,270
I know nothing about who uttered them.
I know nothing about who reported them.

1852
01:29:24,660 --> 01:29:26,910
It's so,
it's your question is basically,

1853
01:29:27,030 --> 01:29:30,420
some people said some bad things after I
taught.

1854
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:32,220
It's like,
could be,

1855
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:34,590
but I have no idea what to do about 
that.

1856
01:29:34,591 --> 01:29:35,424
And I don't take responsibility for it.
It's not specific enough to take 

1857
01:29:37,951 --> 01:29:40,300
responsibility for.
Okay.

1858
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:44,460
So we do have the officers have to go 
home.

1859
01:29:45,090 --> 01:29:46,980
Um,
I appreciate that you have an opinion,

1860
01:29:47,370 --> 01:29:49,640
but at some point,
um,

1861
01:29:50,490 --> 01:29:53,130
at some point we do need to call it a 
day.

1862
01:29:53,490 --> 01:29:54,750
Um,
thank you.

1863
01:29:54,751 --> 01:29:57,180
Akash and Professor Peterson so much.

1864
01:29:57,810 --> 01:30:02,810
[inaudible].
