1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:05,800
Many of you will no doubt.
Remember Lindsay Shepherd,

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:07,383
she was the teaching assistant in the 
Department of communications at Wilfrid 

3
00:00:10,331 --> 00:00:11,164
laurier university who was subjected to 
a three member panel of inquiry after 

4
00:00:14,831 --> 00:00:15,664
she showed a video taken from Canadian 
public television of me debating the 

5
00:00:19,181 --> 00:00:22,620
compelled speech legislation introduced 
in federal bills.

6
00:00:22,621 --> 00:00:23,454
See 16 she showed my discussion with 
Nicholas Matt who held the opposite 

7
00:00:27,701 --> 00:00:28,534
position.
Here is part of the discussion and 

8
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:33,280
question,
what do we do this?

9
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:34,114
Let's take a moment.
We're going to explain a few basic 

10
00:00:35,171 --> 00:00:36,004
things here.
The issue of so called non traditional 

11
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:40,630
pronouns goes together with 
nontraditional gender identities.

12
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,720
New York City for example,
recognizes 31 such gender expressions.

13
00:00:45,881 --> 00:00:47,380
In other words,
besides man and woman,

14
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,250
there are 29 other gender expressions.
For example,

15
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,720
Penn Gender Queer,
gender,

16
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:53,554
gender fluid,
crossdresser by gendered gender blender 

17
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,590
and the list goes on and Nicholas,
this is where I want to bring you in the

18
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:02,810
discussion because you teach this,
you teach trans studies,

19
00:01:02,811 --> 00:01:03,644
so if you would give us a brief primer 
on so many gender identities that in 

20
00:01:08,501 --> 00:01:12,250
your view require non traditional 
pronouns.

21
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,263
Basically,
it's not correct that there is such a 

22
00:01:16,571 --> 00:01:19,420
thing as biological sex.
And I'm a historian of medicine.

23
00:01:19,421 --> 00:01:22,210
I can unpack that for you at great 
length if you want.

24
00:01:22,211 --> 00:01:24,490
But in the interest of time,
I won't.

25
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,700
The three member panel included 
professors,

26
00:01:27,701 --> 00:01:28,960
Nathan Ramboo,
Canna,

27
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:29,943
her supervisor,
her bird Pimlott in charge of the 

28
00:01:32,171 --> 00:01:33,004
master's program and Adriana Joel 
Manager of gendered violence and sexual 

29
00:01:37,361 --> 00:01:38,194
assault prevention,
shepherd tape the meeting and released 

30
00:01:41,321 --> 00:01:42,154
it publicly producing what I think was 
the biggest scandal that ever envelop 

31
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,203
it.
Canadian University and certainly the 

32
00:01:47,621 --> 00:01:51,070
only one in living memory that became 
news internationally.

33
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,040
Nothing has,
can you share people from those ideas?

34
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,653
Am I supposed to come for them and uh,
make sure that they are insulated away 

35
00:01:59,051 --> 00:02:00,100
from this?
Like is that,

36
00:02:00,101 --> 00:02:00,934
what's the point of this is because to 
me that is so against what a university 

37
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:06,460
is about.
So against it,

38
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:10,310
I was not taking sides.
I was presenting both arguments.

39
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,183
Okay.
So the thing of it is about this is if 

40
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:16,540
you're presenting something like this,
it,

41
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,583
uh,
you have to think about the kind of 

42
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,800
teaching climate that you're creating.
And this is actually,

43
00:02:23,801 --> 00:02:28,801
these arguments are counter to the 
Canadian human rights code.

44
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,690
Uh,
ever since I know that you talked about,

45
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,990
um,
[inaudible] ever since this past,

46
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,670
it is discriminatory to be targeting 
someone,

47
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:40,803
um,
due to their gender identity or gender 

48
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:43,384
expression.
So bringing something like that up in 

49
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:47,230
class,
not critically,

50
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,880
and I understand that you're trying to 
like,

51
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,743
it was critical.

52
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,310
I introduced it critically.
How so?

53
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,560
Like I said,
like I said,

54
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:56,530
it was in the spirit of debate.
Okay.

55
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,060
In the spirit of the debate is slightly 
different than being like,

56
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:01,750
okay,
this is,

57
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,500
this is like a problematic idea that we 
want when we want to unpack.

58
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,423
But that's taking sides.
Like it's taking sides for me to be 

59
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:09,701
like,
oh,

60
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:10,534
look at this guy.
Like everything that comes out of his 

61
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:13,330
mouth is bs,
but we're going to watch anyway.

62
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,283
Okay.
So I understand the position that you 

63
00:03:17,001 --> 00:03:22,001
were coming from and your positionality,
but the reality is that it has created a

64
00:03:22,721 --> 00:03:25,970
toxic climate for some of the students.
Hey,

65
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,000
you know how many,
it's great.

66
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,590
Ooh,
like how many,

67
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:30,424
okay.
One,

68
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,570
yes.
May I speak?

69
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,353
I have no,
I have no concept of of like how many 

70
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:38,080
people complained like what their 
complaint was.

71
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:40,510
You haven't showed me the complaint.
Yes,

72
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,510
I understand that this is upsetting,
but there's also confidential at the end

73
00:03:44,511 --> 00:03:47,680
of confidentiality matters.
The number of people's confidential.

74
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,633
Yes.

75
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,553
Although the university apologize 
publicly for its treatment of shepherd 

76
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,243
as did Ramboo Kenna,
it is not clear at all that the powers 

77
00:03:55,831 --> 00:03:56,664
that be so to speak learned their lesson
and the mistreatment of shepherd not 

78
00:04:00,391 --> 00:04:05,391
only continued but arguably intensified,
so she decided to press her case legally

79
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,033
and presented the statement of claim 
against the three and Wilfred laurier 

80
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,160
early in the second week of June.
It lists in painful detail the many ways

81
00:04:16,531 --> 00:04:17,364
that this situation was mishandled 
during and after the initial 

82
00:04:20,101 --> 00:04:20,934
inquisition.
I also discussed the situation with 

83
00:04:24,151 --> 00:04:28,920
Howard Levitt shepherds lawyer.
I decided that Wilford Loria had learned

84
00:04:28,921 --> 00:04:29,754
very little from its public 
embarrassment and the shepherds claims 

85
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:35,010
were valid,
justifiable and necessary,

86
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,053
including her statement that our future 
lack of employability in academia was 

87
00:04:39,691 --> 00:04:44,310
improbable to say the least.
I've been on hiring committees and I can

88
00:04:44,311 --> 00:04:48,450
tell you that even then the slightest 
whiff of scandal is enough to disqualify

89
00:04:48,451 --> 00:04:51,660
a candidate
and consequence.

90
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,920
Not only did I decide to read and post 
the entirety of shepherds claims,

91
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:56,843
which I will do in a few minutes,
I also decided to launch a claim of my 

92
00:04:59,671 --> 00:05:00,504
own against the same defendants.
I thought that two lawsuits might make 

93
00:05:03,991 --> 00:05:04,824
the point better than one.
I'll read some of my claim to after 

94
00:05:08,551 --> 00:05:09,384
shepherds and you can all make up your 
own minds about the suitability of this 

95
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:13,770
course of action.

96
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,900

97
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,650

103
00:05:50,661 --> 00:05:53,210
your absence and without further notice 
to you.

104
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,063
Yeah,

105
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,193
to Nathan Ramboo Cana and to Adria Joel

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,513
The plaintiff claims the following 
against the defendants individually and 

108

112
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:39,890
500,000 punitive damages in the amount 
of $1 million.

113
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:44,000
The plaintiff resides in the town of 
Waterloo in the province of Ontario,

114
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,450
the defendant's Herbert Pimlott Lord and
Nathan Ramboo.

115
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:51,320
Kenna are professors at the defendant 
Wilfrid laurier university.

116
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,173
Pim Log was the coordinator for the 
Master's program of the university and 

117
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:56,774
Ramboo.
Kenna at the relevant time was the 

118
00:06:58,371 --> 00:06:59,204
professor for the course which shepherd 
was a teaching assistant for both had 

119
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,124
considerable influence over the 
plaintiff's employment as a teaching 

120
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,660
assistant and status as a master's 
student.

121
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,513
The defendant,
Adrian Joel was at all relevant times 

122
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,690
acting manager of the university's 
diversity and equity office in charge of

123
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,643
gender violence prevention.
The defendant university is a creature 

124
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:26,870
of statute created pursuant to the 
provisions of the Wilfred Laurier.

125
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:30,470
Hey Act.
The university is vicariously liable for

126
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:34,850
all of the conduct of the individual 
defendants referred to herein and at all

127
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:35,684
relevant times,
created an environment supporting and 

128
00:07:37,941 --> 00:07:38,774
facilitating acquiescing to and 
implicitly and sometimes explicitly 

129
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,753
endorsing that conduct.
The constituent statute of the 

130
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:47,774
university to Wilford Laurier Act 1973 
as amended 2001 and 2016 in providing 

131
00:07:55,131 --> 00:07:55,964
the fundamental jurisdiction and 
authority for the university to operate 

132
00:07:58,610 --> 00:07:59,443
states as its object in section four 
that the objects of the university are 

133
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:05,990
for the pursuit of learning through 
scholarship,

134
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,033
teaching,
and research within a spirit of free 

135
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:10,094
inquiry and expression.
The university has no other object and 

136
00:08:13,821 --> 00:08:18,530
no jurisdiction and no jurisdiction to 
operate otherwise.

137
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,013
The university has no other object and 
no jurisdiction to operate otherwise 

138
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:28,160
pursuant to section five powers of the 
university.

139
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,413
The act further states that the 
university has all powers necessary and 

140
00:08:32,031 --> 00:08:32,864
incidental to the satisfaction and 
further its of its objects as a 

141
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:36,974
university.
The constituent statute creating an 

142
00:08:39,921 --> 00:08:43,910
empowering the university provides it 
with no other power or authority.

143
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,423
Shepherd was at all relevant times.
A student in the university master's 

144
00:08:49,221 --> 00:08:53,210
program pursuing your master's degree 
and employed as a teaching assistant for

145
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:54,044
a course under Ramboo Cana.
And following that under Professor 

146
00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:59,790
Judith Nicholson as a teaching 
assistant,

147
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:03,030
shepard supported a class taught by 
professor Rambo Kinda.

148
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,523
She was generally responsible for 
teaching to groups of approximately 25 

149
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:08,334
students,
was assigned topics and was entitled 

150
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,513
pursuant to the policies of the 
university and have ramboo Canna to 

151
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:15,204
devise her own curriculum.
Rambo Ghana wasn't indifferent mentor 

152
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,003
who had only met with Shepard twice 
about his course and only then briefly 

153
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,330
ironically given his complaint against 
her as delineated below.

154
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,313
He provided her with very limited 
direction as to the content to provide 

155
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:32,064
to her students in his classes.
The topic for one of our communication 

156
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:40,170
classes held on November 1st,
2017 was grammar.

157
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,453
She taught three classes that day.
Shepherd introduced the topic of the 

158
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:45,984
grammatical correctness of gender 
neutral language in the evolution of 

159
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:49,824
various languages and do facilitate.
Discussion on this subject showed a 

160
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:54,504
field minute extract from a TV Ontario 
program moderated by and Pakan 

161
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,023
consisting of a debate between professor
Jordan Peterson of the University of 

162
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,603
Toronto,
Psychology Department and Nicholas Matt 

163
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,960
from the University of Toronto's sexual 
diversity studies program,

164
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,163
Peterson and Nicholas Matt.
We're debating compelled gender 

165
00:10:15,211 --> 00:10:16,044
pronouns.
Peterson argued against being required 

166
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:19,014
to use these new words,
which he argued had not developed 

167
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:22,254
organically.
Matt took an opposing position shortly 

168
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:26,754
following that class,
Ramboo Kana ordered her to attend a 

169
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:29,634
meeting the very next day with himself 
Pimlott the program coordinator for the 

170
00:10:33,691 --> 00:10:34,524
entire Master's program and Adrian Joel 
Acting Director of the diversity and 

171
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:39,540
equity office.

172
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,823
Both Rambo,
Kana and Pimlott had considerable 

173
00:10:42,571 --> 00:10:45,120
authority over shepherds.
Fate at the university,

174
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:50,400
apparently so to Joel Shepherd had never
been called into such a meeting.

175
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,713
Indeed,
Rambo Kana to that point had barely 

176
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,580
acknowledged her existence at this 
session.

177
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,360
All three lambasted shepherd viciously 
attacking her personally,

178
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,343
falsely alleging that there had been a 
complaint or complaints about her 

179
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:07,560
tutorial and insisting that in playing 
the TV Ontario clip,

180
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,690
she had been threatening to her 
students.

181
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,213
Ramboo Kanick claimed that are showing 
this TV Ontario clip breached the 

182
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,700
Charter of rights and freedoms and 
federal bill [inaudible],

183
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,790
which is not even govern provincially 
regulated universities,

184
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:24,420
created an unsafe learning environment 
and was illegal.

185
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,823
Shepherd was accused of Targeting Trans 
folks even though Shepard had chosen no 

186
00:11:29,311 --> 00:11:33,480
side had up until that point,
disagreed with what she understood to be

187
00:11:33,481 --> 00:11:37,320
Peterson's perspective and presented the
arguments and the debate neutrally.

188
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:38,723
Rambo Kana attacked and slandered 
Peterson claiming that he was part of 

189
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:42,324
the alt right and that playing a clip of
Peterson without first providing any 

190
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:50,751
previous context to the students was 
like neutrally playing a speech by Adolf

191
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,683
Hitler.
Shepherd argued the doing is he asked 

192
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:56,440
would be taking sides and that was not 
her role.

193
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,603
She was then further rebuked for taking 
that position at various points during 

194
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:04,720
that almost hour long vicious and 
abusive attack,

195
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,140
shepherd was reduced to tears.
Ironically,

196
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,153
rather than being a present day 
personification of Adolf Hitler as 

197
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:16,180
Ramboo county implied Jordan Peterson 
has spent decades educating his students

198
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:17,014
about the evils of the Holocaust and 
specifically as part of his 

199
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:20,734
psychological teachings has studied and 
taught how individuals degenerate 

200
00:12:23,681 --> 00:12:25,930
ethically to the point where they take 
place.

201
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,410
Okay.

202
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,930
To the point where they take part in 
atrocities.

203
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,473
Okay.

204
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,533
As part of his psychological teachings,
he has studied and taught how 

205
00:12:37,151 --> 00:12:37,984
individuals degenerate ethically to the 
point where they take part in 

206
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:43,090
atrocities.
During the meeting,

207
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:46,720
shepherd was effectively attack as a 
protege and supporter of Peterson.

208
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,183
Pimlott continued to libel Peterson 
explaining that people like him live in 

209
00:12:51,311 --> 00:12:52,144
a fantasy world of false conspiracy and 
accusing Shepard of being an agent of 

210
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:56,854
those ideas because she had neutrally 
shown this video with it's opposing 

211
00:12:59,861 --> 00:13:00,694
viewpoints.
Ramboo can have falsely but 

212
00:13:02,831 --> 00:13:03,664
imaginatively claimed that shepherd 
herself was targeting people based on 

213
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:07,864
their gender identity or gender 
expression and in doing so had violated 

214
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:15,970
the Federal Human Rights Code of Bill.
See 16 although shepherds conduct was in

215
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:18,460
no way violet of of that or any law.

216
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:19,783
Yeah.

217
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,633
Sheppard asked the individual defendants
whether her job as a teaching assistant 

218
00:13:23,341 --> 00:13:25,950
was to shield her students from debate 
and ideas.

219
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,113
Ramboo Kana asserted that it was,
and then accused her of targeting 

220
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:32,640
students due to their gender expression 
and identity.

221
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:36,180
When Shepard pointed out that she had 
not taken sides in this debate,

222
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:39,510
the three rebuked her for creating a 
toxic climate.

223
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,183
The three refused to advise shepherd 
what the complaint was or who 

224
00:13:44,521 --> 00:13:45,354
complained,
claiming that even the number of 

225
00:13:47,101 --> 00:13:51,210
complaints was confidential.
As was subsequently ascertained,

226
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,220
there had been no complaint at all.

227
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,150
Yeah,

228
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:54,983
shepherd protested that she did not 
understand how we're teaching methods 

229
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:58,404
constituted any disservice to the 
university since the idea is in the 

230
00:14:01,231 --> 00:14:03,720
video were already part of social 
currency.

231
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,180
Joel responded without any foundation 
accusing her of spreading transphobia.

232
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,033
Ramboo Kana added to jewel's attack by 
essentially comparing her actions to 

233
00:14:14,581 --> 00:14:15,414
white supremacy.
Contrary to the allegations of the 

234
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:19,074
defendants at this meeting,
shepherd conducted herself at this 

235
00:14:21,631 --> 00:14:22,464
seminar precisely as her role required 
and singularly represented the 

236
00:14:25,681 --> 00:14:29,490
principles of the Wilfrid laurier 
university act for this,

237
00:14:29,491 --> 00:14:33,060
she was viciously attacked by Rambo,
Canna Pimlott and Joel.

238
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,360
They continued to abuse her even after 
she began sobbing,

239
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,080
accusing Shepard of causing harm to 
unnamed students.

240
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,590
Shepherd apologized for crying during 
the meeting.

241
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,513
Pleading.
I am stressed out because to me this is 

242
00:14:46,831 --> 00:14:47,664
wrong so wrong,
noting that the very spirit of the 

243
00:14:50,311 --> 00:14:54,770
university to challenge ideas that you 
already have and reminding them that she

244
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:56,720
had not taken any side or position.

245
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:58,903
The meeting concluded with Shepard being
advised even after she promised to show 

246
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:06,680
no further videos of Peterson or 
anything of the like that she now had to

247
00:15:06,681 --> 00:15:11,540
run all of her seminar notes passed 
Ramboo Kenna to obtain specific approval

248
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,374
for any future clips of anyone that she 
attended to show and that Rambo Canna 

249
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,920
might have to sit in on her future 
classes.

250
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,340
She was prohibited from showing any 
further videos.

251
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,610
Finally,
they suggested to her that her job might

252
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:26,444
be in jeopardy.
The conduct of the defendants was 

253
00:15:29,391 --> 00:15:33,680
objectively outrageous and flagrant.
They had reckless disregard for the fact

254
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:34,603
that the foreseeable consequences of 
their conduct would cause shepard to 

255
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:39,770
suffer emotional distress,
which it did.

256
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,623
There are various policies of the 
university which constitute a contract 

257
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:44,714
between the university and its members 
including Shepherd Article 1.01 of the 

258
00:15:49,341 --> 00:15:53,150
procedures relating to the prevention of
harassment and discrimination policy.

259
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:53,983
6.1 of the university notes that 
informal resolution possibilities as 

260
00:15:58,521 --> 00:16:02,240
well as emotional academic and 
departmental supports will be explored.

261
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,033
None of this occurred.
It also noted in article 1.02 of the 

262
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:12,470
procedures relating to the prevention of
harassment and discrimination policy 6.1

263
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,423
that if the concern falls outside of 
this policies jurisdiction or could be 

264
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,403
more appropriately dealt with elsewhere,
the individual will be referred to the 

265
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:22,364
appropriate office that also did not 
occur under article 3.02 of policy 6.1 

266
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,433
the office of dispute resolution and 
support will determine whether a 

267
00:16:33,171 --> 00:16:34,004
complaint may go forward.
Article Three Point Oh four states that 

268
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:37,754
the office is available to provide 
guidance on the preparation of a 

269
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:41,084
complaint or response to a complaint.
That guidance was not provided to 

270
00:16:44,811 --> 00:16:45,644
shepherd.
Article 5.01 of policy 6.1 states that 

271
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:51,314
an investigation may be required when 
other efforts to resolve the complaint 

272
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:55,993
have not been successful or not 
appropriate in the complaint by Jackson 

273
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:00,980
referred to below.

274
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,263
No other efforts to resolve the 
complaint were considered before 

275
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:05,384
proceeding to the formal investigation 
of shepherd article 8.03 of policy 6.1 

276
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:12,043
states that Wilfrid laurier university's
prevention of discrimination and 

277
00:17:14,841 --> 00:17:18,860
harassment policy is not intended to 
inhibit academic freedom.

278
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,173
It was used by Ramboo Kana,
Joel and Pimlott for precisely that 

279
00:17:23,031 --> 00:17:23,864
purpose.
Article 8.05 notes that the university 

280
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:31,340
may take disciplinary action against 
those who make allegations of harassment

281
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:35,780
or discrimination which are reckless,
malicious or not in good faith.

282
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:39,950
Although Pimlott Ramboo,
Kana and Joel had acted recklessly,

283
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,813
maliciously and in bad faith and it was 
ultimately determined by the university 

284
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,520
that this meeting never should have 
occurred.

285
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,250
No action has been taken by the 
university against them and shepherd was

286
00:17:50,251 --> 00:17:53,160
provided no protection from their 
predations.

287
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:54,803
The prevention of harassment and 
discrimination policy provides in 

288
00:17:57,361 --> 00:17:58,194
article 1.02 that each member of the 
campus community is responsible for 

289
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:02,784
helping to create an environment that 
promotes mutual respect and 

290
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:08,100
understanding for the dignity and rights
of others.

291
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,150
This policy was violated by Rambo 
counter pim law and Joel.

292
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,553
The prevention of harassment 
discrimination policy defines workplace 

293
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:16,944
harassment in article 2.04 as engaging 
in a course of vexatious comment or 

294
00:18:21,751 --> 00:18:26,250
conduct against a worker in the 
workplace that is known or reasonably to

295
00:18:26,251 --> 00:18:29,490
be known to be unwelcome or workplace 
harassment.

296
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:34,140
This provision to was violated by Rambo,
Canna Pimlott and Joel.

297
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,573
Article 2.07 defines a poisoned 
environment as were harassing or 

298
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:40,974
discriminatory behaviors are severe and 
or pervasive and cause unreasonable 

299
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:46,980
interference with a person's study or 
work environment.

300
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,053
A poisoned environment may be created.
A poisoned work or learning environment 

301
00:18:51,151 --> 00:18:53,370
is one that is intimidating,
hostile,

302
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,323
and or offensive.
A poisoned environment can arise even 

303
00:18:57,781 --> 00:18:58,614
from a single incident.
It may be created by the comments or 

304
00:19:01,321 --> 00:19:04,620
actions of any person regardless of his 
or her status.

305
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,370
Ramboo Bukana,
Pimlott and Joel created a poisoned work

306
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:09,204
environment for shepherd and thereby 
breached the university's contractual 

307
00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:12,930
obligations to shepherd.

308
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,903
Article Four Point Oh four states that 
the university will take appropriate 

309
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:22,380
steps to fairly investigate,
respond to allegations of discrimination

310
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:26,580
and or harassment in accordance with the
procedures relating to this policy.

311
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,850
No such steps were taken.
Instead,

312
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,713
shepherd was wrongly attacked by the 
members of the administration until 

313
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:37,770
public and alumni outcry forced the 
university to retreat from its position.

314
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,880
Following this meeting being publicized,
mcclachi president of the university was

315
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,170
interviewed on the agenda by Steve 
Pakan,

316
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,153
the same show,
from which the clip of the debate 

317
00:19:48,691 --> 00:19:49,524
between Dr. Peterson and Matt was taken.
She was repeatedly asked by Pakan 

318
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,533
whether Shepard had done anything wrong 
by showing this clip from his earlier 

319
00:19:57,901 --> 00:19:58,734
show,
mcclatchy effectively defended the 

320
00:20:00,751 --> 00:20:02,940
conduct of Ramboo County,
Joel and Pimlott.

321
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,320
She refused to acknowledge the shepherd 
had not acted improperly,

322
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,183
despite pagans continuing to press her 
on this shepherd had the foresight to 

323
00:20:12,031 --> 00:20:15,990
taper inquisition when it began and 
after outrage from the public and alumni

324
00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:16,770
erupted.

325
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:20,400
The president of the university,
Debra mcclachi and Ramboo.

326
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:24,300
Kenna issued apologies in Ramboo Kennis 
forced apology.

327
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,193
He continued to lie,
still insisting that there had been a 

328
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:30,900
complaint and that he had been doing his
duty by addressing it.

329
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,303
It was only when public and alumni 
outrage group that mcclachi was 

330
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:36,683
ultimately forced to admit that what 
happened to Ms. Shepherd in the meeting 

331
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:43,650
was shameful and that the material she 
showed was entirely appropriate.

332
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:44,723
That was a quote.
This was only after an investigator 

333
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,270
found that there never had been any 
complaints,

334
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,910
formal or informal,
and that Ramboo Kinda Pim.

335
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:54,010
Lots and Joel statements to the 
contrary.

336
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,933
We're false and deceitful.
The university admitted in this 

337
00:20:57,701 --> 00:20:58,534
statement from its president that this 
meeting never should have happened at 

338
00:21:00,821 --> 00:21:03,070
all.
No formal complaint,

339
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:08,160
nor even an informal concern relative to
university policy had been registered as

340
00:21:08,861 --> 00:21:10,150
to the screening of the video.

341
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,673
The president only when besieged 
acknowledged that these errors and 

342
00:21:14,261 --> 00:21:15,094
judgment were compounded by the 
misapplication of the university's 

343
00:21:18,071 --> 00:21:21,610
policies and procedures,
that basic guidelines and best practices

344
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:22,444
on how to appropriately execute the 
roles and responsibilities of staff and 

345
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:26,104
faculty were ignored or not understood 
that procedures on how to apply 

346
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:33,470
university policies and under what 
circumstances were not followed and that

347
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,100
institutional failure allowed this to 
happen.

348
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:40,600
The president noted that as there was 
institutional failure,

349
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:44,350
the responsibility ultimately started 
and ended with her.

350
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,483
She further acknowledged that Ms. 
Sheppard was targeted with vitriol by 

351
00:21:49,481 --> 00:21:50,314
members of the university.
Mcclatchy admitted that shepherd was 

352
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:53,854
involved in absolutely no wrongdoing and
publicly stated that the university was 

353
00:21:58,241 --> 00:22:01,300
taking action to ensure that this did 
not occur again,

354
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,740
a claim that was and remains entirely 
false.

355
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,440
Shepherd has never received redress of 
any kind,

356
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:12,400
nor has she been consulted about the 
input that this treatment has had on her

357
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,840
and her career prospects.

358
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:14,943
Instead,
she was subjected to continuing abuse 

359
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:18,544
and it talks at climate from the 
university and its representatives as 

360
00:22:21,161 --> 00:22:26,161
described below
in mcclatchy's apology on November 21st,

361
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,173
2017 she states that quote supports were
in place to support student involvement 

362
00:22:31,841 --> 00:22:32,674
in a situation who are targeted with 
extreme vitriol through the situation 

363
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,903
and quote.
Yet she and the university offered 

364
00:22:38,801 --> 00:22:42,940
shepherd no such support in mcclachi 
claiming to be troubled.

365
00:22:42,941 --> 00:22:45,830
By the way,
quote everyone and quote involved in the

366
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:48,340
situation was targeted with extreme 
vitriol.

367
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,270
She showed the same and equal concern 
for shepherds predators.

368
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:56,500
As for Shepard herself.
The president also acknowledged that the

369
00:22:56,501 --> 00:23:01,000
rationale for invoking the gender and 
sexual violence policy did not exist,

370
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,840
that it was misapplied and that this was
a significant overreach.

371
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,243
Shepherd relies on mcclatchy's 
admissions here in mcclachi claim that 

372
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,673
quote Lauria is committed to the abiding
principles of freedom of speech and 

373
00:23:14,771 --> 00:23:18,930
freedom of expression and quote,
her conduct throughout entirely betrayed

374
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:23,940
that goal in Ramboo Canis disingenuous 
apology to Shepard on November 21st,

375
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,370
2017 he stated open quote.

376
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,413
While I still cannot discuss the student
concerns raised about the tutorial and 

377
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:33,544
quote,
but no student concern had even been 

378
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,664
raised about the tutorial prior to his 
and his codefendants bullying of 

379
00:23:39,671 --> 00:23:40,504
shepherd.
He acknowledged that his meeting with a 

380
00:23:42,161 --> 00:23:42,994
panel of three people would be an 
intimidating for shepherd and would not 

381
00:23:46,731 --> 00:23:50,120
have invited a productive discussion 
ramboo can.

382
00:23:50,121 --> 00:23:50,954
His apology claimed that he quote did 
not do enough to try to support her 

383
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:58,460
shepherd and quote when he did 
absolutely nothing at all,

384
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,323
but instead attacked her following the 
public outcry the next time shepard met 

385
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:04,334
with her students,
the chair of the Department of 

386
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,110
Communications.
Peter Erkhart attended that tutorial and

387
00:24:09,111 --> 00:24:09,944
offered shepard students but not 
shepherd emotional support suggesting 

388
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:17,240
that they would be welcome to go to the 
campus wellness center.

389
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,630
He sat at the back of the room for the 
entire tutorial,

390
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,553
effectively shutting down any discussion
on the issue and undermining shepherd's 

391
00:24:24,711 --> 00:24:26,030
role in her classroom.

392
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,063
Erkhart proceeded on behalf of the 
university to publicly insult shepherd 

393
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:35,840
when asked by email,
by Maclean's magazine why he appeared in

394
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,910
her class on that day.
He responded,

395
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,550
quote,
I assume she recorded it.

396
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:44,090
Why not ask her for the recording and 
quote.

397
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,540
He then sent maclean's a second email.
Open quote,

398
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,830
sorry.
You're a pro.

399
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:49,783
I should have assumed that you've 
already heard that particular recording 

400
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,173
and quote.
Using his position of power and 

401
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:58,340
authority over shepherd to intimidate 
and embarrass her publicly.

402
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:04,040
Professor Elisia Slowinski,
who shepherd was taking a masters course

403
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:04,874
from asked in front of the class for 
Shepard to put away her laptop and then 

404
00:25:08,721 --> 00:25:09,554
said in front of other master's students
that she gave this instruction because 

405
00:25:12,561 --> 00:25:13,394
she did not want to be recorded even 
when shepard assured her that she was 

406
00:25:16,701 --> 00:25:17,534
not recording the class.
Further alienating and creating a toxic 

407
00:25:20,421 --> 00:25:21,620
environment for shepherd.

408
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,533
Following these events,
Ramboo Canis course ended and shepherd 

409
00:25:26,631 --> 00:25:30,290
was assigned to be the teaching 
assistant to Professor Judith Nicholson,

410
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,273
a professor of communication who had 
publicly taken a negative position 

411
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,550
against shepherd prior to shepard being 
assigned to her.

412
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,193
Before that semester even started,
Nicholson had signed an open letter 

413
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,140
supporting Pimlott and Ramboo.
Kenna.

414
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,820
This made the university assigning 
shepard to her tutor.

415
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,673
Lich entirely inappropriate,
created a poisoned environment for 

416
00:25:52,371 --> 00:25:55,130
shepherd and made it impossible for her 
to succeed.

417
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,653
Shepherds apprehensions about 
Nicholson's lack of objectivity toward 

418
00:25:59,301 --> 00:26:00,134
her.
We're quickly born out on three 

419
00:26:02,151 --> 00:26:04,940
occasions during their relatively brief 
dealings,

420
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:05,893
Nicholson without provocation,
harassed and abused shepherd and 

421
00:26:08,721 --> 00:26:12,890
deliberately create a difficulty for her
from the outset of their meeting,

422
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,950
Nicholson told shepherd that it was her 
quote,

423
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,873
academic freedom and quote and that no 
one is permitted to make the university 

424
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:21,044
look bad,
implying that shepherd had improperly 

425
00:26:23,151 --> 00:26:23,420
done.

426
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,730
So.
On the second occasion,

427
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,120
she sent out a course syllabus with a 
territorial acknowledgement,

428
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:29,961
I.
E.

429
00:26:29,961 --> 00:26:33,260
A reference to the aboriginal tribe 
which had once been on the land,

430
00:26:33,261 --> 00:26:34,094
which Wilford Lauria was on shepherd.
Considering this irrelevant to the 

431
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:38,834
syllabus and a ludicrous act of 
political correctness and virtue 

432
00:26:41,781 --> 00:26:42,614
signaling.
Cut that part of the note and tweeted 

433
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:45,504
it,
noting that such acknowledgements were 

434
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:49,170
now even on the syllabus of university 
courses,

435
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,453
Nicholson demanded in front of the other
teaching assistants that she delete her 

436
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:54,234
tweet when shepard protested,
that all she was tweeting was the 

437
00:26:57,181 --> 00:27:00,510
university logo with the course name and
territorial acknowledgement.

438
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,260
Nicholson threatened to take her to the 
dean if she did not remove it.

439
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,910
Nicholson also absurdly claimed that 
this territorial acknowledgement was her

440
00:27:08,911 --> 00:27:09,744
intellectual property.
She proceeded to complain to the Dean 

441
00:27:12,421 --> 00:27:13,254
about Shepherd's tweet in an attempt to 
further endanger shepherds position in 

442
00:27:16,681 --> 00:27:17,514
the university.

443
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:22,170
The Dean informed Nicholson that the 
acknowledgement was not her intellectual

444
00:27:22,171 --> 00:27:23,004
property and called an urgent meeting 
with the two departments which shepherd 

445
00:27:26,551 --> 00:27:27,384
was associated with the communication 
studies and the cultural analysis and 

446
00:27:30,511 --> 00:27:34,170
social theory departments at least in 
part to discuss these issues.

447
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:35,483
It was clear that if shepherd had 
tweeted positively about the land 

448
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:41,160
acknowledgement she would not have been 
in difficulty with Nicholson.

449
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,073
The third occasion was in March,
2018 when shepard needed to reschedule 

450
00:27:46,411 --> 00:27:47,244
her last class of the year and utilize 
polling software with a link to 

451
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:50,994
available alternate days for her class 
to fill out their available alternate 

452
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:57,270
dates.
When Shepard found times that all of her

453
00:27:57,271 --> 00:27:58,104
students were available to meet,
she emailed Nicholson to seek her 

454
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:01,554
approval for the new dates.
Nicholson reprimanded her copying two 

455
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:06,384
deans claiming falsely that shepherd had
moved these classes without Nicholson's 

456
00:28:09,691 --> 00:28:10,524
consent in advance even though the 
letter was just such a request and the 

457
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:17,370
request on its face was premised on 
Nicholson's consent.

458
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:18,863
When Shepard advised Nicholson that she 
never had any intention of changing the 

459
00:28:21,721 --> 00:28:22,554
date without Nicholson's approval,
which was why her letter explicitly 

460
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:26,304
requested that approval.
Nicholson counseled shepherds tutorial 

461
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:32,250
entirely.
This was despite the fact that alternate

462
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:35,040
dates were available for Shepard and our
students to attend.

463
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,323
Nicholson instructed shepard students to
attend sessions of the other teaching 

464
00:28:39,481 --> 00:28:40,314
assistants on dates which were largely 
coincident with dates which shepard and 

465
00:28:43,711 --> 00:28:44,544
her students had arranged.
Since this was to have been shepherds 

466
00:28:47,071 --> 00:28:49,890
last class,
she never saw her students again.

467
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,863
Ethan Jackson,
a transgender activist who has attacked 

468
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:57,330
shepard throughout the events described 
herein,

469
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:58,463
launched a formal,
patently frivolous harassment complaint 

470
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:06,150
against her to which even after Ms. 
Sheppard had completed her coursework at

471
00:29:06,151 --> 00:29:09,000
the university so she would not see 
Jackson again.

472
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:13,560
The university responded by proceeding 
with a formal investigation.

473
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,573
Despite its inherently vexatious bad 
faith and frivolous allegations which 

474
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:19,973
pursuant to the applicable policies the 
university should not have proceeded 

475
00:29:23,851 --> 00:29:24,684
with.

476
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:30,260
Jackson had an online crowd funding page
seeking a sex change operation,

477
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,050
which was initially denied because of 
his mental health issues.

478
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,273
Additionally,
Jackson was banned from the University 

479
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,950
of Waterloo campus in 2013 for 
protesting and d platforming,

480
00:29:41,951 --> 00:29:42,784
a member of parliament who was to give a
speech on abortion by dressing up as a 

481
00:29:46,391 --> 00:29:47,224
giant vulva and yelling.
Jackson was invariably hostile to 

482
00:29:51,251 --> 00:29:56,251
shepherd Jackson's allegations against 
shepherd where that a,

483
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,543
she was on her telephone during one 
class and purportedly disengaged from 

484
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:03,190
participation in that class.
B,

485
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:08,340
Ms. Sheppard had made four tweets with 
screenshots from Jackson's controversial

486
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:09,363
social media account.
Sea Shepherd responded to Jackson 

487
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:14,344
walking into the printing room and 
angrily ordering her to leave the room 

488
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:20,320
and cease using the communications 
department printer,

489
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:21,243
which she required for communications 
coursework by referring to him as petty 

490
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:25,924
and pathetic.
D when Shepard and two others were 

491
00:30:28,721 --> 00:30:32,380
putting up posters for a lorry,
a society for open inquiry meeting.

492
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,393
He claimed that they had followed him 
and his colleague as they were walking 

493
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:36,934
around the halls and that shepherds 
posters had signage which he found 

494
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,504
offensive posters,
which he acknowledges removing from the 

495
00:30:42,911 --> 00:30:43,744
walls without authorization.
The complaint of Jackson was made 

496
00:30:48,071 --> 00:30:48,904
maliciously after classes were over for 
the year at a time when he and shepard 

497
00:30:52,211 --> 00:30:53,044
would not ever be interacting again.
Since shepherd is not enrolled in a 

498
00:30:56,261 --> 00:30:57,094
courses for the following session,
despite Jackson's complaint being 

499
00:31:00,671 --> 00:31:03,010
inherently self contradictory and 
ludicrous,

500
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,030
the university not only proceeded to 
summon Shepard for an investigation,

501
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,043
but threatened her with repercussions if
she disclosed Jackson's complaint to 

502
00:31:11,351 --> 00:31:12,184
anyone.
The attacks on shepherd have rendered 

503
00:31:14,561 --> 00:31:18,340
her unemployable in academia,
resulting in her abandoning her previous

504
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:19,174
ambitions of obtaining her phd or even 
teaching at a university as a masters 

505
00:31:22,811 --> 00:31:26,680
graduate.
Shepherd has suffered nervous shock as a

506
00:31:26,681 --> 00:31:27,514
result of the conduct of the defendants,
which was the foreseeable and intended 

507
00:31:30,701 --> 00:31:31,534
result.

508
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,673
In the alternative,
it was the reasonably foreseeable 

509
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:35,674
outcome of their conduct and the 
defendants were negligent in their 

510
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:39,430
treatment.
Of Her.

511
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,980
So that's shepherds claim.
As I said,

512
00:31:43,981 --> 00:31:47,550
after I reviewed this and talked in 
detail to shepherds lawyer,

513
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:48,563
I concluded that Wilfred Laurier had not
learned what needed to be learned and 

514
00:31:51,571 --> 00:31:55,470
launched a claim of my own this week.
It reads in part

515
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:00,390
the plaintiff that's me,
claims against the defendants,

516
00:32:00,391 --> 00:32:03,060
Nathan Ramboo,
Canna Herbert Pimlott Atria,

517
00:32:03,061 --> 00:32:08,061
Joel and Wilfrid laurier university,
the following 500,000 for defamation,

518
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:13,940
500,000 for injurious false hood,
500,000 in punitive damages,

519
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:18,690
prejudgment and post judgement interest 
in accordance with the courts of Justice

520
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:22,230
Act costs on a substantial indemnity 
basis and such.

521
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:26,490
Further and other relief as counsel may 
advise and this honorable court may deem

522
00:32:26,491 --> 00:32:29,640
just the plaintiff's claim against 
Ramboo,

523
00:32:29,641 --> 00:32:30,474
Canna Pimlott Joel and the university 
defamatory statements on Youtube on or 

524
00:32:35,311 --> 00:32:36,144
about November 2nd,
2017 Rambo Kana his then teaching 

525
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:41,024
assistant Lindsay Shepherd to attend 
what turned out to be a disciplinary 

526
00:32:44,061 --> 00:32:44,894
meeting with himself,
Pimlott and Joel to discuss her having 

527
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:51,110
shown an extract from a TV Ontario 
program to our students.

528
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,063
The TV Ontario program moderated by 
Steve Pagan consisted of a debate 

529
00:32:55,611 --> 00:33:00,611
between Peterson and Nicholas.
Matt at the meeting on or about November

530
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,113
2nd,
2017 Rambo Kana Pim lot and Joel each 

531
00:33:03,141 --> 00:33:05,840
made numerous defamatory statements 
about Peterson,

532
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:09,650
all of which the others endorsed both 
expressedly and implied.

533
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,323
The meetings content has since been 
posted online on a video sharing 

534
00:33:14,391 --> 00:33:17,150
website,
youtube and is available on the Internet

535
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,043
where it is open to the public and 
easily accessible by anyone who wishes 

536
00:33:20,691 --> 00:33:21,524
to view its content.
I'm skipping a bit here at the meeting 

537
00:33:24,411 --> 00:33:25,244
on or about November 2nd,
2017 Rambo cannot Pimlott and Joel 

538
00:33:28,911 --> 00:33:29,744
falsely and maliciously made numerous 
defamatory statements about Peterson 

539
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:33,703
including but not limited to the 
following defamatory statements made by 

540
00:33:38,151 --> 00:33:42,440
Ramboo Canna.
A Peterson identified student protestors

541
00:33:42,441 --> 00:33:46,250
by posting their social media accounts 
for the purpose of other people bullying

542
00:33:46,251 --> 00:33:50,690
and threatening them online.
B Peterson is basically debating whether

543
00:33:50,691 --> 00:33:53,000
or not a trans student should have 
rights.

544
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,133
See,
Peterson's position would be the 

545
00:33:55,731 --> 00:33:56,564
equivalent of debating whether or not a 
student of color should have rights or 

546
00:33:58,851 --> 00:33:59,684
should be allowed to be married.
Contrary to the charter of rights and 

547
00:34:02,121 --> 00:34:02,954
freedoms.
Dee Peterson has engaged in the 

548
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:06,044
targeting of trans students,
giving out their personal information 

549
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,960
for the purpose of having them attack,
harassed so that death threats will find

550
00:34:11,961 --> 00:34:13,880
them.
This is something that Peterson has done

551
00:34:13,881 --> 00:34:16,910
to his own students,
Peterson has done to other students.

552
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:18,283
He playing a speech by Peterson is 
basically like playing a speech by 

553
00:34:21,951 --> 00:34:22,784
Hitler.
F Peterson's opinion is like alt-right 

554
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,790
opinions,
white supremacist opinions,

555
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:31,250
Anti Trans Opinion,
anti gay opinion,

556
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,590
anti woman,
misogynist opinion.

557
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:37,970
G Peterson's view is whether trans 
people are people or not.

558
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,343
Defamatory statements made by Pimlott 
Peterson is academically suspect to say 

559
00:34:43,911 --> 00:34:44,744
the least.
He does not have the substantial 

560
00:34:45,981 --> 00:34:48,410
academic evidence to be a credible 
person.

561
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,650
B,
Peterson's positions don't have credible

562
00:34:51,651 --> 00:34:55,610
evidence just like Charles Murray with 
his race claims of white superiority.

563
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,653
See,
Peterson brings hatred and targets 

564
00:34:58,431 --> 00:34:59,264
groups.
Dee Peterson Exhibits Charlatan Ism II 

565
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:07,250
Peterson has nothing really that is 
credible in terms of research defamatory

566
00:35:07,251 --> 00:35:11,270
statements made by Joel.
A Peterson's position is causing harm to

567
00:35:11,271 --> 00:35:15,350
trans students by framing their identity
as invalid or their pronouns as invalid.

568
00:35:15,351 --> 00:35:17,390
Contrary to the Ontario Human Rights 
Code.

569
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:23,120
B Peterson is spreading transphobia.
Now I'm skipping ahead a bit.

570
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:23,954
Again,
the said words in their natural and 

571
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:27,434
ordinary meaning and the connotation of 
the comments obvious to any reader were 

572
00:35:31,011 --> 00:35:36,011
meant and were understood to mean that 
Peterson is comparable to Adolf Hitler.

573
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,093
The greatest bought in world history 
deliberately spreads hatred both 

574
00:35:40,351 --> 00:35:44,490
generally and in particular to students 
is a member of the alt right,

575
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,653
is unfit to be a professor.
Breaches the code of ethics of his 

576
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:51,690
profession and university is a white 
supremacist,

577
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:56,160
has and expresses opinions,
which are uninformed and uneducated,

578
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,100
is sexist,
is misogynist,

579
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,710
is racist,
is homophobic,

580
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:05,310
is transphobic,
is a deplorable person,

581
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:08,040
is in competent,
is a reprobate,

582
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,083
lacks integrity,
lacks the appropriate ethics to be a 

583
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:12,180
psychologist.

584
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,810
And professor is a bully and abusive 
towards students.

585
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,690
Wants to deprive minorities of any 
rights,

586
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,140
organizes attacks,
even death threats on students,

587
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,123
breaches.
Canadian law dehumanizes certain of his 

588
00:36:25,981 --> 00:36:29,160
students and lacks credibility and 
credentials.

589
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,440
The statements made by Rambo,
Kana,

590
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:34,290
Pimlott,
and Joel in for all of the above,

591
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,540
including,
but not limited to,

592
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,960
that Peterson has unsavory,
sexist,

593
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,400
misogynist,
dangerous,

594
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:43,110
racist,
homophobic,

595
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,243
transphobic,
analogous to Adolf Hitler and 

596
00:36:46,261 --> 00:36:48,660
incompetent in his profession as an 
author,

597
00:36:48,661 --> 00:36:49,890
teacher,
and professor,

598
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,060
and were false and specifically designed
to impugn his reputation.

599
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,343
These defamatory statements were 
malicious and designed specifically to 

600
00:36:58,261 --> 00:37:00,420
damage his personal and professional 
character.

601
00:37:00,421 --> 00:37:02,010
As a professor,
author,

602
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,080
lecturer,
and public intellectual.

603
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,080
Well,
you get the picture.

604
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,593
That's the end of that.
I'm hoping that the combination of the 

605
00:37:13,261 --> 00:37:14,094
two lawsuits will be enough to convince 
careless university professors and 

606
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,234
administrators blinded by their own 
ideology to be much more circumspect in 

607
00:37:22,411 --> 00:37:26,910
their actions and their words.
We'll see how that plays out.
