1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,280
We focus on the idea of happiness too 
much in the.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:03,263
The problem with that is is that it 
takes our focus away from ames that 

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,120
would be more productive.
It's much better to aim for meaning then

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,133
for happiness.

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:20,120
12 rules for life is about how to live 
properly in the face of vulnerability,

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,000
tragedy,
and malevolence.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,553
One of the propositions in 12 rules for 
life is that life existence is usefully 

8
00:00:30,851 --> 00:00:34,990
characterized as an interplay of order 
and chaos or unknown unknown.

9
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,390
You're always striving to balance those 
two.

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:38,953
If if,
if what you're doing is too familiar 

11
00:00:40,931 --> 00:00:43,600
your board and if what you're doing is 
to unfamiliar,

12
00:00:43,601 --> 00:00:47,320
then you're anxious and what you want to
do is find the,

13
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,770
the,
the harmonious line between those two,

14
00:00:50,771 --> 00:00:54,250
but that's signified by leaning.
If you can get those two things right,

15
00:00:54,251 --> 00:00:55,840
then you can have your cake and eat it 
too.

16
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:02,610
I hope people can take away the idea 
that there is a motive being in the face

17
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:04,144
of the vulnerability and tragedy of life
that is noble and powerful and capable 

18
00:01:11,621 --> 00:01:12,454
of sustaining them through the worst 
possible times without becoming corrupt 

19
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:18,004
and bitter.
