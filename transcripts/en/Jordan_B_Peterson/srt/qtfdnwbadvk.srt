1
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,840
There are two ways of meditating on death.
Uh,

2
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:29,300
one is the more bid way, uh, which is uh,

3
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:34,350
a kind of avoidance of life and a sense
that nothing is worthwhile because it's

4
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:35,640
all gonna come to an end.

5
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:41,150
And the other is the creative way of
recognizing that that your mortality is a

6
00:00:43,681 --> 00:00:46,910
fundamental part of all that you hope for.
You know,

7
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,400
when we fall in love with another,

8
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,280
when one falls in love
with another person,

9
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,210
one is consciously taking under ones care,

10
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:02,490
a mortal being and it's the sense
of her fragility in term mortality,

11
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,790
which is fundamental to the so the love
that one feels towards her in my view.

12
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,060
Uh, and uh, if you try and
exclude the thought of death, uh,

13
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,680
then that love is weakened.
The sense that you're,

14
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:21,180
you have that she is absolutely
dependent on that love.

15
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,560
And of course we'll one day
escape from it in through death.

16
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,890
That is absolutely a part of what the
love is and why we find in erotic lover

17
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,990
kind of redemption.
That's asked what I would say 10

18
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,060
I would say as well that it's an,

19
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,640
it's an aid to concentration and focus.

20
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,150
You don't have much time and there's
plenty of problems and so you and,

21
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,250
and it's going to be a
hard road no matter what.

22
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,600
And so get at it. You know, for years,

23
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:59,040
when I was in my twenties
the first thought I had when
I woke up in the morning

24
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:02,430
was life is short.
I really literally,

25
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:07,290
it happened to me for years and I
thought, no, time to waste. Then there's,

26
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,080
there's, there's things to be done,
there's things that need doing,

27
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,570
get the hell up,
make yourself efficient,

28
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,720
aim at something that makes the
transients of life worthwhile because such

29
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,010
things exist.
And then,

30
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,810
and then do everything you can to manifest
everything you can within that mortal

31
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,640
frame. And, and it,

32
00:02:26,641 --> 00:02:30,330
it adds to life of a seriousness
that would otherwise be absent.

33
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,240
Oh,
I'll tell you my plumber story

34
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,370
because that makes it concrete.
I've done a lot of home renovation.

35
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,350
I've worked with lots of workmen and on
very creative projects as a matter of

36
00:03:13,351 --> 00:03:17,100
fact. And so that was very entertaining
because with carpenters for example,

37
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:22,290
we built a quite strange and unique
third floor on my house in Toronto and I

38
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,330
invited the carpenters to contribute.

39
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:27,030
I told them what the overall view was
and what we were trying to produce,

40
00:03:27,031 --> 00:03:28,530
but if they had creative ideas,

41
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,560
then I was welcoming them
because I wanted them to,

42
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,320
I didn't want to tell them what to do.

43
00:03:34,321 --> 00:03:38,220
I wanted to produce something beautiful
with them fully on board so that it was

44
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:41,040
likely to manifest itself
in the best possible manner.

45
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:46,370
And so that competence that
that I described rather
rather utilitarian manner is

46
00:03:47,521 --> 00:03:52,521
almost immediately transcended
by something that's more
potent and more valuable

47
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,810
in the actuality of it.

48
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,800
If you're participating in a project
like that and you invite people into a

49
00:03:58,801 --> 00:04:00,180
reciprocal relationship,

50
00:04:00,181 --> 00:04:04,530
then the relationship begins to
transcend the particularities of, of the,

51
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:08,760
of the project, and then the
project goes wonderfully well. So,

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,490
and that is a reflection of
something that's deeper in it.

53
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,500
It touches on something that Sir
Roger mentioned statement by Christ,

54
00:04:16,501 --> 00:04:19,200
that if two or three people are
gathered together in his name,

55
00:04:19,201 --> 00:04:20,850
that he's there and you can,

56
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,930
you can infuse every relationship you
have with precisely that spirit if you're

57
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,560
cognizant of it and careful,
I mean it's and fortunate and,

58
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,800
and far more than that.

59
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,130
It's a thing to strive for and you
won't manifest itself perfectly,

60
00:04:35,131 --> 00:04:39,210
but that can be there and
all the particularities. And
so that way you have the,

61
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:43,260
the singularity of the project itself,
the practicality of that,

62
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,420
there's a reason that Christ was also a
carpenter, right? That's the particular,

63
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:51,840
cause a house that's not built on
truth does not stand, you know,

64
00:04:51,841 --> 00:04:56,130
and so those particular relationships
should partake of that divine,

65
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,120
the divinity of ultimate reciprocity.
And then both are,

66
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,550
both are elevated and,
and so,

67
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,640
so it that the narrowness of,
of,

68
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,060
of say capitalists trade is insufficient,

69
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:13,690
but it's embedded in something that
when it's not a zero sum game, it's,

70
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,850
it's embedded in something that's far
deeper than that and far more gratifying.

71
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:20,100
And if,
and if you're careful about such things,

72
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,540
then the projects that you
involve yourself with that
or even somewhat mundane

73
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:28,230
can take on a much more,
much,

74
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:33,180
much more beautiful and productive,
uh, nature. And then that's,

75
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:38,040
well, it's not frustrating. It's,
it's, it's compelling and it works. So

76
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,020
yeah, I would just add to that that, um,

77
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:47,240
what Jordan has said really
is that in a job rightly done,

78
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,180
the divine is imminent in some
way and George Herbert said,

79
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:57,050
and who sweeps the rumors for they
laws makes that and the action fine.

80
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,910
Um, okay, we leave out these days
that drug makes drudgery divine bit,

81
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,950
but, um, you know, the habit
was absolutely right about that.

82
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:11,570
That two W if you ask the question,
where does God enter the ordinary life,

83
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,570
it is in that sense of doing something
for its own sake, uh, and uh,

84
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,750
and acquiring the habit of doing so and
not wanting a rewards beyond the thing.

85
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:21,980
Um,

86
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,980
which is co connects with Aristotle's
conception of what a virtue is as well.

87
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,750
So, um, Eh weren't,

88
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:33,740
shouldn't despair that there is a
moral education available to us,

89
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:37,450
even in a world where there
isn't a formalized and,

90
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:42,580
and shared religion that that will bring
that aspect of things to bear on human

91
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:44,894
life.

92
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,083
What I,

93
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:27,190
what I would say is the term happiness
means ultimately the full fee,

94
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,980
your fulfillment as a person, uh, and uh,

95
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:37,370
that that isn't the same as
gratification of your desires. It is,

96
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:41,570
it means the kind of
transformation of your, um,

97
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:46,630
your being such that you can look on
what you are and say for all my faults,

98
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,570
uh, I accept that thing. Uh, and,

99
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,590
and when they're on an
occasion comes to rejoice,

100
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,940
you're accepted and enter it
rather than say, asking yourself,

101
00:07:58,941 --> 00:08:01,880
do I deserve it? You know, those, uh,

102
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,740
that's that avoidance of joy,

103
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,520
which many people have is actually
itself a kind of narcissism.

104
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,830
They're happy person goes
out and embraces the,

105
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,510
the occasion for rejoicing
and he does. So, um,

106
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,210
because uh,

107
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:25,270
his own nature is at ease with itself
and you can incorporate this into it.

108
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,260
Of course, there's a lot more to
it there. That one has to have,

109
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:31,790
as Aristotle says,

110
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,960
happiness is an activity of the
soul in accordance with virtue.

111
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,250
What he meant was that, um, that
if you don't have the virtues,

112
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:45,460
you're trading always on a thin ground
that you all fall through in that

113
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:52,400
wonderful moment when it at last few
years is going to say yes. You know,

114
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:56,310
uh, you, you turn out your,
your nature as a Predator

115
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:00,650
is revealed. Do you use the
Jordan's image? A new full,

116
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,170
uh,
irrecoverably but anyway,

117
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:08,640
that's brief discourse on happiness.
Well,

118
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,970
I mean for me,
like I find a tremendous,

119
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,330
first of all there's an alliance
between happiness and gratitude.

120
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:20,100
And you touched on that. If you're going
to accept the tragic reality of life,

121
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:20,934
let's say,

122
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,740
then it's also reasonable to accept
happiness when it comes your way.

123
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:30,150
And to be grateful for it
and to be grateful for it
is to accept it and to enjoy

124
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:34,350
it. Well, it makes its presence felt
it's something that visits I would say.

125
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,860
And you can invite that
visitation. I would say. Um, um,

126
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,810
I do that primarily by playing.
Um,

127
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:46,110
I was very playful with my
kids and my wife and still am,

128
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:48,540
I mean most of the time with my kids,

129
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,150
it was nonstop jokes
of one form or another.

130
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,070
My daughter can barely say anything that
isn't a joke of some sort, you know?

131
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:59,490
And I hang around with comedians all
the time and I usually have my best

132
00:09:59,491 --> 00:10:03,030
discussions with them and my
best friends when I grew up,

133
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,130
especially when I was young,
young man,

134
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:10,400
where people who were inveterate ironist
and joke tellers and mostly what we did

135
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:11,700
was competitive humor.

136
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,690
The whole goal of it social gathering
was to see who could say the most

137
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:20,220
outrageously funny thing.
And that was unbelievably entertaining.

138
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:25,550
And so if that comes along and you can
participate in it and you can play so

139
00:10:28,351 --> 00:10:29,190
much,
the better.

140
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:34,440
And so it's even useful to touch things
that are difficult with a playful and

141
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:34,921
light hand,

142
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:38,880
which is partly why I traveled with
Dave Ruben in my lecture series because

143
00:10:38,881 --> 00:10:42,780
Dave's a professional stand up comedian
as well as a serious person in his own

144
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:43,081
right.

145
00:10:43,081 --> 00:10:48,081
But all of the very disturbing
lectures that I put forward,

146
00:10:48,421 --> 00:10:52,790
because I think they are disturbing
our Lavand with, with humor and that,

147
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,200
that there's purpose.
That's, that's purposeful.
