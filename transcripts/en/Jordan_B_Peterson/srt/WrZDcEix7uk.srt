Hi everyone.
It's January 15th a few weeks ago in a

2
00:00:07,701 --> 00:00:10,940
discussion with Dave Ruben,
I announced that I would be closing my

3
00:00:10,941 --> 00:00:15,941
patrion account as of today,
so I am doing so as Dave has or will

4
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:21,590
shortly.
I'm not pleased about this in any way

5
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,890
and patrons,
innovative service helped me a lot when

6
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:28,550
I was first in trouble because of the
videos I made criticizing the Canadian

7
00:00:28,551 --> 00:00:32,960
compelled speech bills,
see 16 and the University of Toronto's

8
00:00:32,961 --> 00:00:37,961
forest anti-biased training policy,
but I don't think what patron has

9
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:41,120
decided to do in the case of Sar gone
have a cad.

10
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:46,510
Carl Benjamin was right and I think it
sets a bad precedent so that's that

11
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,020
I'm actively working on an alternative
platform has a competitor to patron.

12
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,130
In the meantime,
I've set up a simple rather featureless

13
00:00:58,131 --> 00:01:00,920
alternative,
which is now where the support bar on

14
00:01:00,921 --> 00:01:03,590
the lower left hand side of my videos
points.

15
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,240
This is for those who would like to
continue their patronage or begin his

16
00:01:08,241 --> 00:01:12,830
new supporters.
My financial situation has stabilized

17
00:01:12,831 --> 00:01:17,600
substantially since I originally set up
a patron account and I did it then in

18
00:01:17,601 --> 00:01:22,190
March of 2016 to see if I could fund
further development of my youtube

19
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:25,130
channel,
which is not and has never been ad

20
00:01:25,131 --> 00:01:27,590
supported.
However,

21
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,970
it seems that a substantial number of
people want to indicate and provide

22
00:01:31,971 --> 00:01:36,971
their support on a continued basis,
feeling inclined by all appearances to

23
00:01:37,521 --> 00:01:41,120
provide something reciprocal in return
for the content they have been provided

24
00:01:41,121 --> 00:01:44,060
with.
Although I would likely continue to

25
00:01:44,061 --> 00:01:49,061
generate video content in any case,
seeing all that support definitely

26
00:01:49,341 --> 00:01:53,750
incentivizes me on an ongoing basis to
make generating youtube content,

27
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,150
uh,
top priority as well as allowing me to

28
00:01:56,151 --> 00:02:01,151
continue to fund the small team I have
working on an online education project.

29
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,670
I've discussed a bit in various
interviews in the past,

30
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:10,930
about 5,000 of my patrons have already
left the platform in protest,

31
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,590
so I'm already down to about half the
number of subscribers I once had.

32
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:20,030
Approximately 2,500 of these have
transferred their support to the

33
00:02:20,031 --> 00:02:24,470
alternative I spoke of earlier.
Although an unknowable proportion of

34
00:02:24,471 --> 00:02:29,471
this 2,500 have new lease signed on.
Thank you very much to all my patrons

35
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:35,000
and all my viewers and listeners and
readers for their past support and to

36
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:38,600
all of those who have transferred their
contributions to the alternative system.

37
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:44,470
So let's see how this goes.
I think I have it set up here to delete.

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,130
We'll see right here.
Disabled my account.

39
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,060
Well,
you're goes,

40
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,440
all right.
12 I have to withdraw $11 and 21 cents

41
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:18,280
it looks like that happened.
So let's see now if I can do this

42
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:29,030
one more step by the looks of things.
That's it,

43
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:48,840
ladies and gentlemen.
All right there.

44
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,490
It's nighttime in Switzerland where I am
now.

45
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,300
Anyway,
so I tried to sign in and it's

46
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:58,570
definitely gone.
So I just thought I'd let you know that.

47
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,660
Thanks again.
We'll talk to you soon.

48
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:05,050
I've got a couple of new youtube videos
that'll be up in the next week

49
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:11,290
and I'll see those of you who are coming
to my shows in California and New

50
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,270
Zealand and Australia over the next
month.

51
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:14,740
Bye Bye.
All.
