1
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,840
As I've mentioned to you before,
each of the three aspects of experience.

2
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:40,404
So the things you know,
the things you don't know and the fact 

3
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:48,630
of yourself have a very ambivalent 
underlying structure,

4
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:49,464
both positive and negative so that the 
things you don't know are interesting 

5
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:55,170
and compelling and the sources of new 
information,

6
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:56,004
but also the source of the things that 
undermine you both physically and 

7
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:01,560
mentally.
And the things that you know,

8
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,394
of course your culture disciplines you 
and shapes you into a full person but 

9
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:11,244
also at exactly the same time molds you 
and crushes you in a particular 

10
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:19,380
direction rather than any of the other 
directions you might have gone in.

11
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,530
And then finally,
with regards to the individual,

12
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:28,260
we spent a substantial amount of time 
discussing the individual's capability,

13
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,710
capacity to make order out of chaos and,
and sometimes to make chaos out of order

14
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,950
in the service of a higher order.
And that's all to the good.

15
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,400
But just like culture and nature have 
there negative aspects.

16
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,263
So did the individual,
and I think personally this is where 

17
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:48,600
Christian mythology in particular comes 
into its own.

18
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,743
I think of all the major religions,
Christianity has the most thoroughly 

19
00:01:56,461 --> 00:02:01,200
developed what you might describe as 
formal model of evil.

20
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,730
And that model isn't part of the 
canonical writings of Christianity,

21
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:10,440
say encapsulated in the Bible,
but part of the cloud of sort of natural

22
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:13,740
mythology and storytelling that 
surrounds the canonical writings.

23
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:14,903
So you could say that although 
Christianity and Buddhism have spent a 

24
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:23,730
substantial amount of time developing up
a representation of the hero,

25
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,913
Christianity in particular has also 
spent a substantial amount of time 

26
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,743
developing a formal portrait of the 
figure that stands in opposition to the 

27
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,154
hero.
And I think the most appropriate term 

28
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:41,490
for that figure who takes multiple forms
in mythology is the adversary.

29
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,353
Because
the adversarial spirit is a spirit that 

30
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,370
stands in opposition to everything 
stands in opposition to nature,

31
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:53,514
stands in opposition to culture,
and most specifically stands in 

32
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:58,980
opposition to that aspect of the human 
being.

33
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,890
That's both exploratory and creative.
Now,

34
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:03,724
the last time we talked,
I had a chance to describe to you how 

35
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:09,394
the figures of the adversarial brothers 
emerge naturally at the end of genesis 

36
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:15,820
as a,
as a Coda to this story.

37
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,683
Right?
Adam and eve developed self 

38
00:03:17,851 --> 00:03:18,684
consciousness.
They develop knowledge of their own 

39
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:20,584
mortality and death.
And as the primordial parents of 

40
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,693
humanity,
their first children take the form of 

41
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:31,060
the hostile brothers,
which is to say that if you're the child

42
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:35,290
of nature and the child of culture,
the sort of ultimate parents,

43
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,890
then as an individual,
you take two forms,

44
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:39,724
a positive form in a negative form,
and the negative form is characterized 

45
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,473
in many ways by a kind of absolute 
hatred of the good hatred of the 

46
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:48,424
positive form.
And I think that you can't understand 

47
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,703
the full human propensity for evil 
without considering more than the 

48
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:02,930
territory allity more than the innate 
territoriality of human being.

49
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:04,150
So if you look at animals,
well,

50
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:07,960
animals are territorial and they fight 
to preserve their territory,

51
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:12,190
and it's a rational struggle.
They're fighting for resources and for a

52
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:15,400
place that they can,
that they can operate in,

53
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:16,234
live in and reproducing inefficiently.
But human beings are substantively 

54
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:23,650
different from that in that they're 
agonistic conflict.

55
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:24,484
Their aggression often seems to be 
motivated by something more akin to the 

56
00:04:28,271 --> 00:04:32,080
pure desire for destruction rather than 
for any rational land whatsoever.

57
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:37,470
And so from that perspective,
I would say as an example,

58
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,383
the fact that Hitler ended up committing
suicide in a bunker beneath Germany's 

59
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:47,110
capital at the end of the Second World 
War when Berlin was in flames,

60
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:50,230
when all of Germany was in flames and 
when his country was completely defeated

61
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:53,020
after tens of millions of people had 
died in the conflict,

62
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,153
including of course the 7 million or so 
people that were killed in the 

63
00:04:56,711 --> 00:04:57,544
Holocaust,
the normal mode of interpretation of 

64
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:03,400
that would be what a terrible defeat for
Hitler,

65
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:08,401
but an equally valid and I think an 
equally valid prime of facie argument.

66
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,663
And one I think that's actually more 
valid is that it wasn't a defeat for 

67
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:12,904
Hitler at all.
It was precisely what he was aiming at 

68
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:20,251
right from the beginning because his 
mode of being was intensely adversarial.

69
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,933
And I would also say that it's certainly
possible that the full nature of his 

70
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:25,714
motivations weren't even necessarily 
clear to him as they unfolded across 

71
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:33,970
time during the Second World War.
No more than the full motivations of any

72
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:37,690
human being are necessarily accessible 
to them as they act out,

73
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:40,090
whatever it is that they act out.
So Carl Young says,

74
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:40,980
for example,
that we,

75
00:05:40,981 --> 00:05:41,814
we act out great mythological stories.
That doesn't necessarily mean you know 

76
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:48,220
the story.
It just means you act it out.

77
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:49,503
So for example,
you see people whose lives are 

78
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:55,870
repetitive bouts of tragedy and what 
they're acting out is a tragic story,

79
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,360
and they know it in so far as they're 
actually acting it out,

80
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:00,194
but they don't necessarily have an 
explicit model of the relationship 

81
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:04,394
between their patterns of behavior in 
the constantly tragic outcomes they 

82
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,970
produce.
Well,

83
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:08,804
that doesn't even necessarily mean that 
what they're doing isn't voluntary 

84
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,480
because things can be voluntary,
even if you don't understand them fully.

85
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,430
There's an aspect to the human psyche 
that's a nest of vipers,

86
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:22,910
so to speak,
because you can't necessarily trust what

87
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:23,744
you see.
And that means not only when you're 

88
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:25,484
looking at someone else say,
but even when you're looking in the 

89
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:27,614
mirror,
you can't be sure that what you say 

90
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:30,920
you're doing is exactly what you're 
doing.

91
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,370
Your motivations aren't transparent and 
they may not even be clear.

92
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,283
So I suppose the idea that lurks behind 
this formalization is that freedom of 

93
00:06:44,641 --> 00:06:49,641
choice is such a good that one of its 
subsidiary necessities,

94
00:06:50,251 --> 00:06:51,084
which is that there has to be a polar 
distinction between good and evil is 

95
00:06:55,021 --> 00:06:55,854
worth having.
Freedom is so important that it 

96
00:06:57,661 --> 00:07:00,150
justifies the distinction between good 
and evil.

97
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,553
And I think that our,
I think that's a reasonable way to 

98
00:07:03,781 --> 00:07:04,614
presume

99
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,813
it's reasonable to presume that that's 
the manner in which experience is 

100
00:07:11,161 --> 00:07:13,950
actually structured.
And there's complex reasons for that.

101
00:07:13,951 --> 00:07:17,700
One would be that under the most optimal
circumstances,

102
00:07:17,701 --> 00:07:21,030
which is something we'll talk about as 
this proceeds to a close,

103
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,820
that means in a sense you can have your 
cake and eat it too,

104
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,043
which means the potential existence of 
good and evil allows for freedom of 

105
00:07:28,591 --> 00:07:31,380
choice.
And then if the choice is always towards

106
00:07:31,381 --> 00:07:34,260
the good,
then you have the benefits of freedom of

107
00:07:34,261 --> 00:07:35,094
choice plus the benefits of the good.
The only price you have to pay is the 

108
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:38,634
constant possibility of evil.
It's very much like the structure of 

109
00:07:41,131 --> 00:07:41,964
Christianity,
so you have the highest God whose whose 

110
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,063
highest son is Christ,
but you have the figure of the Satan 

111
00:07:49,651 --> 00:07:50,484
lurking in the background who's also got
a filial relationship with the highest 

112
00:07:53,161 --> 00:07:53,994
God.
It makes for a confusing kind of 

113
00:07:55,801 --> 00:07:58,410
theology because in many situations,
of course,

114
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:02,340
Christ is identified specifically with 
God the father,

115
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,920
but Satan always lurks in the background
and his,

116
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:09,780
his existential status is indeterminate 
because since God is everything,

117
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:10,614
then it's very difficult to make the 
case that the evil spirit isn't a 

118
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:14,100
derivative of God.

119
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:17,070
It's not easy thing to get straightened 
out rationally.

120
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:20,670
And I think Milton in paradise lost does
a very good attempt,

121
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,080
makes a very good attempt to explain 
exactly what this might mean,

122
00:08:25,081 --> 00:08:27,690
how there could be an overarching 
transcendent power.

123
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,270
And there could be two subordinate 
elements to that.

124
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,283
One evil in one good without destroying 
the idea that God as such as good and 

125
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:40,170
without eradicating the reality of evil,
very,

126
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:45,171
very complex argument to make.
Now the notion of evil is also very,

127
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:48,750
very complex idea.
So if you look at our arguments that,

128
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,550
uh,
support atheism,

129
00:08:50,551 --> 00:08:51,384
and I've mentioned some of these like 
Ivan's argument in the brothers 

130
00:08:53,341 --> 00:08:55,300
Karamazov where Ivan says,
wow,

131
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,134
the world and as such experiences such 
must be evil because it's predicated on 

132
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:02,850
the blood of innocence,
the suffering of children.

133
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:03,684
The fact that there's vast injustices in
the world is indicative that there's no 

134
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:07,584
such thing as a good God or to speak and
less personified terms is evidence that 

135
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:15,630
the structure of experience as such is 
an untenable morally.

136
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,900
It shouldn't be because it's predicated 
on suffering.

137
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,100
Jeffrey Burton Russell,
who's written a whole series of books on

138
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:23,934
the nature of evil.
It makes a very clear distinction 

139
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,370
between different categories of terrible
events that I hit.

140
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,340
I think help bring this into clarity,
so imagine this,

141
00:09:32,341 --> 00:09:36,570
imagine first that it's useful to make a
distinction between tragedy and evil.

142
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,531
Okay?
Now,

143
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:42,450
tragedy is when the bad befalls the good
and earthquake is tragic,

144
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:43,284
so or diseases tragic.
Now it's easy to regard a disease or an 

145
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:47,004
earthquake as evil as well,
but the problem with that is that 

146
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,630
doesn't seem to be any motivation to it,
and so it's more likely,

147
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,430
it's more reasonable to think something 
like,

148
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:55,380
well,
people are vulnerable.

149
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,330
They have to be vulnerable in order to 
give existence a viewpoint.

150
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:01,164
One of the consequences of their 
vulnerability is that they're 

151
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,000
susceptible to tragedy.

152
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,833
Okay?

153
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,590
If their vulnerability is a precondition
for being,

154
00:10:11,591 --> 00:10:14,770
then the fact that they're susceptible 
to tragedy isn't necessarily an evil.

155
00:10:14,771 --> 00:10:17,560
It's just a consequence of their 
limitation.

156
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,421
Then you say,
well,

157
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:21,254
what constitutes evil if you can't put 
earthquakes and diseases and so forth 

158
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,640
into that category?
Well,

159
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:28,910
there didn't seem to be something more 
dependent on choice,

160
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,070
which is the argument that Elliot is 
making.

161
00:10:31,071 --> 00:10:31,904
Say
the rural does all sorts of terrible 

162
00:10:34,521 --> 00:10:36,230
things to people,
but there are frequent,

163
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,823
it's frequently the case that people act
in such a way to make things worse 

164
00:10:41,471 --> 00:10:42,790
rather than better.
Right?

165
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:47,791
So if you look at the consequences of 
the rise to power of the Nazis,

166
00:10:48,311 --> 00:10:49,144
for example,
it doesn't seem reasonable to put the 

167
00:10:50,231 --> 00:10:51,064
Nazi concentration camp in the same 
category from an ethical perspective as 

168
00:10:54,581 --> 00:10:56,680
the earthquake,
right?

169
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,873
Because the earthquake is an emergent 
consequence of the rules that govern 

170
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:06,130
physical existence.
Whereas the Nazi death camp is something

171
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:08,770
that was planned.
It didn't have to be.

172
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,633
It seems to be an aspect of choice.
And this seems to be the idea that's 

173
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:17,290
lurking underneath both this mythology 
and Eliade addys comment on it.

174
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,124
It's

175
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,530
the mere fact that the world is 
terrible,

176
00:11:20,531 --> 00:11:21,364
does not mean that it's evil.
But then when you look at specifically 

177
00:11:23,501 --> 00:11:24,334
human actions,
there's this aspect of twisted choice 

178
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,060
that fry also makes much of it.
He says,

179
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:28,894
if you,
if you look at the structure of human 

180
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:34,801
history and you try to explain why it 
has such a bloody and terrible course,

181
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:36,903
it doesn't seem sufficient just to 
attribute it say to the conditions of 

182
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:43,060
existence or to ignorance.
It seems more like there's,

183
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,670
uh,
a force behind it,

184
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:46,900
so to speak,
manifest,

185
00:11:46,901 --> 00:11:47,734
say,
and every individual that's actually 

186
00:11:48,881 --> 00:11:49,714
aiming at the suffering instead of just 
allowing it to happen or instead of not 

187
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:56,020
stepping in to stop it,
but actually aiming at it.

188
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,563
Okay.

189
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,780
Now,
so let's take a look at the story.

190
00:12:02,781 --> 00:12:03,810
It's,
and,

191
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,810
and let's take a look at the leading 
figures.

192
00:12:05,811 --> 00:12:06,890
So we know,
for example,

193
00:12:06,891 --> 00:12:10,520
that the figure of Satan and 
Christianity is associated with a number

194
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,960
of strange forms,
right?

195
00:12:11,961 --> 00:12:16,280
The first association we know of is that
he's associated with the,

196
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,120
with the dragon and in the garden of 
Eden,

197
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,190
right?
So there's,

198
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,673
and so that there's a profound 
ambivalence and Christianity about the 

199
00:12:24,621 --> 00:12:28,070
meaning of the opening act of genesis.
Because on the one hand you have,

200
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,680
when Adam and eve are still profoundly 
unconscious,

201
00:12:30,681 --> 00:12:34,610
they don't suffer,
but they're profoundly unconscious,

202
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,840
right?
They're not self conscious,

203
00:12:35,841 --> 00:12:38,600
they're not aware of themselves.
So in many ways there's still animals.

204
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,840
So there's a gnostic line of 
speculation.

205
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:42,763
The gnostics were a Christian sect that 
believed that a redemption could at 

206
00:12:46,911 --> 00:12:50,660
least partly be attained by 
understanding rather than just faith.

207
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,673
The gnostics believed that the the 
serpent tempted Adam and eve towards 

208
00:12:55,391 --> 00:12:56,224
self consciousness was a more developed 
aspect of God then the God that had 

209
00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:01,424
created Adam and eve to begin with 
because the unconsciousness that 

210
00:13:03,591 --> 00:13:07,580
characterized Adam and eve was to 
underdeveloped to be perfect.

211
00:13:07,581 --> 00:13:08,414
And so they had to be tempted forward 
into a more fully developed 

212
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:11,954
consciousness.
And so although classical Christianity 

213
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,790
associated the serpent in the tree with 
Lucifer,

214
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,530
who's the bringer of light,
who Satan,

215
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:21,950
the gnostic thread of reasoning said,
well,

216
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:23,930
wait a minute,
it's not that simple because yeah,

217
00:13:23,931 --> 00:13:24,764
self consciousness makes you aware of 
death and vulnerability and and knocks 

218
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:30,800
you out into the profane world.
But there's an aspect of it,

219
00:13:30,801 --> 00:13:31,634
the kind of looks like enlightenment and
you know this already in your own lives 

220
00:13:34,401 --> 00:13:35,234
because often when you believe something
and you're unconsciously convinced of 

221
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:42,680
the adequacy of that model and then you 
find that it's not sufficient,

222
00:13:42,681 --> 00:13:43,190
right?

223
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:44,023
And so you crumble in in disappointment,
you put your trust in someone and you 

224
00:13:46,911 --> 00:13:49,400
find out,
say they're not worthy of that trust.

225
00:13:49,401 --> 00:13:50,234
And that,
that the evidence that enlightens you 

226
00:13:53,271 --> 00:13:56,060
breaks that frame of reference and makes
you collapse.

227
00:13:56,061 --> 00:13:56,894
You think that's a terrible thing.
You can't help but feel that as a real 

228
00:14:00,021 --> 00:14:03,380
betrayal and as an act even of evil.
But then a year later,

229
00:14:03,381 --> 00:14:05,060
two years later,
you might look back and think,

230
00:14:05,061 --> 00:14:05,870
God,
you know,

231
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:09,440
I really needed that.
I really needed that lesson because as a

232
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:10,274
consequence of learning that I'm much 
more mature and much more likely to 

233
00:14:13,281 --> 00:14:14,114
establish stable relationships.
And so it's easy to see that from one 

234
00:14:17,841 --> 00:14:20,800
perspective something can be terrible 
and then from another,

235
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,170
it might not be terrible at all.
And even in classic Christianity,

236
00:14:24,171 --> 00:14:25,004
you get this strange ambivalence about 
the events in genesis that runs 

237
00:14:27,921 --> 00:14:29,030
something like this.

238
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,531
Well,
yes,

239
00:14:30,531 --> 00:14:33,830
it was an act of the,
of the most evil spirit,

240
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:36,470
the spirit of enlightenment,
the spirit of rationality,

241
00:14:36,471 --> 00:14:37,304
or the bringer of light,
Lucifer to knock Adam and eve out of 

242
00:14:39,861 --> 00:14:43,520
their transcendental unconsciousness and
to start history,

243
00:14:43,521 --> 00:14:46,610
it was an evil act,
but on the other hand,

244
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,690
it was also the precondition for the 
later emergence of Christ.

245
00:14:50,691 --> 00:14:52,370
And as,
as the Christians are concerned,

246
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:56,510
that's the greatest event in history.
So without this initial opening act,

247
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,980
right,
this tragic opening act,

248
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,023
there'd be no reason for the whole 
redemptive story and therefore 

249
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:05,270
considered from the perspective of the 
total story.

250
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:09,830
The opening tragedy cannot purely be 
considered evil.

251
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,460
Very,
very complicated line of reasoning.

252
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,193
Now the other thing you see here,
and I think this relates back to our 

253
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,060
initial map,
is,

254
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,970
and this also helps you understand the 
way people think.

255
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:23,804
Now,
I said already that it's real easy to 

256
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,700
confuse tragedy and evil,
right?

257
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,563
Okay.
So what that means is that it's real 

258
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:33,680
easy to confuse the negative aspect of 
the unknown.

259
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:35,150
With evil.
And likewise,

260
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:38,360
it's very easy to confuse the negative 
aspect of culture with evil,

261
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,180
your own culture,
the tear radical aspect of it,

262
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,390
or the culture of other people.
So it's very easy for,

263
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:46,820
for example,
for us to demonize the foreigner.

264
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,833
And that's basically because there's a 
part of our mind that presumes that all 

265
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:55,450
things that strike us negatively,
all things that produce negative emotion

266
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,670
on our part,
like fear are the same thing.

267
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:04,030
So there's a blurry category of evil 
that's all terrible natural things,

268
00:16:04,371 --> 00:16:05,204
all terrible social things.
And then whatever nastiness the 

269
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:10,880
individual can generate among 
themselves,

270
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:12,973
it's much more useful to draw a clear 
distinction between these different 

271
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:21,770
categories because that clarity of 
thought can help you,

272
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,443
can help you focus in most specifically 
on those things that the individual is 

273
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:30,860
responsible for in terms of turning the 
world to waste.

274
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:35,660
So Milton says this figure of Satan,
Lucifer,

275
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,190
the,
the light bringer,

276
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,113
always associated with rationality.
Milton presents him as a remarkable 

277
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:42,051
creature,
right?

278
00:16:42,051 --> 00:16:45,740
He's the head highest angel in God's 
heavenly hierarchy.

279
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,840
He is Christ elder brother in,
uh,

280
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,003
in a similar mythological vein.
He's the most powerful angel that ever 

281
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:53,204
lived.
So at least in the opening stages of 

282
00:16:54,951 --> 00:16:55,784
this act,
Satan is presented as something 

283
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:59,390
absolutely remarkable.
Now,

284
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,283
the problem is here,
his very remarkable Nis starts to work 

285
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:04,154
against him.
And what happens is that as he grows in 

286
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,234
power and strength in this heavenly 
hierarchy starts to become convinced 

287
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:16,601
that the omniscient himself,
whatever that transcendent figure is,

288
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,063
is unnecessary.
So the idea is that whatever Satan 

289
00:17:22,011 --> 00:17:26,630
represents decides because of his own 
pride,

290
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:27,703
his own belief in his own sufficiency,
that the transcendent can be eradicated 

291
00:17:32,841 --> 00:17:35,120
from consideration the way Milton 
presents.

292
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:38,420
That is as a revolution in heaven,
fundamentally.

293
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,620
So imagine that the story is something 
like this.

294
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,350
Well,
George Kelley,

295
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:46,184
way back in like 1955 noted that what 
human beings like more than anything 

296
00:17:50,401 --> 00:17:51,234
else,
really when you get right down to it is 

297
00:17:52,711 --> 00:17:55,020
to be right.
Why?

298
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,390
Well,
it's a pain to be wrong,

299
00:17:57,391 --> 00:17:58,860
right?
Because if you're wrong,

300
00:17:58,861 --> 00:17:59,694
then the little structure that you're 
using to conjure up the world has to 

301
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,493
dissolve.
And then you have to do a lot of really 

302
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:09,210
aggravating work,
exploratory work and creative work.

303
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,150
To put it back together.
And during the time,

304
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,103
before you put it back together,
then you're flooded with negative 

305
00:18:15,631 --> 00:18:16,920
motivational states,
right?

306
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:19,890
You don't know which way is up,
metaphorically speaking.

307
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:23,100
So we don't like to be,
we don't like not to be,

308
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:23,730
right.
And,

309
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,200
and so what does that mean?
Well,

310
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:29,010
psychologists know that people have a 
very strong confirmatory bias,

311
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,993
which basically means that if you bring 
a frame of reference to bear on the 

312
00:18:32,431 --> 00:18:35,010
world,
the probability is very high,

313
00:18:35,011 --> 00:18:35,844
that you will look for confirming 
evidence and you will discount 

314
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:40,973
disconfirming evidence.
Now the other thing that is 

315
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:47,610
characteristic of great figures of evil,
like Satan is their tendency to lie,

316
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,590
right?
So Satan is prince of the lie.

317
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,000
Now what does that mean exactly?

318
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:01,060
So Tsl Eliot wrote this poem called the 
cocktail hour.

319
00:19:01,421 --> 00:19:03,690
He talks about this woman,
he goes in for psychiatric treatment.

320
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:06,130
The woman says to the psychiatrist,
I'm telling Ya,

321
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,590
I really,
really hope there's something wrong with

322
00:19:08,591 --> 00:19:11,050
me because I'm having a miserable time 
of it.

323
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,840
And as far as I can tell,
there's only two options here.

324
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:14,883
Either I'm okay and I'm having a 
miserable time because the world is 

325
00:19:17,381 --> 00:19:18,214
terrible,
in which case there's nothing I can do 

326
00:19:20,501 --> 00:19:21,334
about it.
Or there's something wrong with me at 

327
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:23,973
some level of analysis that I don't 
really comprehend and although that's a 

328
00:19:27,401 --> 00:19:28,234
painful option,
I'm really hoping it's true because if 

329
00:19:30,701 --> 00:19:33,100
there's something wrong with me,
possibly I can fix it.

330
00:19:33,101 --> 00:19:35,350
And if there's something wrong with the 
structure of the world,

331
00:19:35,351 --> 00:19:37,900
well what's there to do about that?

332
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,993
Often what you see in psychotherapy is a
battle between those two perspectives 

333
00:19:44,611 --> 00:19:45,444
going on in the minds of the client that
the client is in a situation where 

334
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,320
they're repetitively facing tragedy,
they have a specific viewpoint about the

335
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:56,190
world,
like their viewpoint might be,

336
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,960
well,
when it comes right down to it,

337
00:19:57,961 --> 00:19:58,794
you really can't trust other people and 
they have all sorts of reasons for 

338
00:20:01,081 --> 00:20:01,914
believing that maybe they were abused as
children or they've had a bad 

339
00:20:03,721 --> 00:20:04,554
developmental history,
a number of relationships that haven't 

340
00:20:06,361 --> 00:20:07,194
gone well.
They have all the facts at their 

341
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,160
disposal to justify that particular 
perspective.

342
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:11,994
But the truth of the matter is,
is that as long as they hold on to that 

343
00:20:14,431 --> 00:20:17,880
belief and won't let it go and no wonder
they won't,

344
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,313
they're going to continue to suffer.
And part of what you're always doing to 

345
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,740
someone in therapy saying,
you know,

346
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:23,783
yeah,
you go to a pretty coherent view of the 

347
00:20:24,871 --> 00:20:25,704
world and all that,
and I can understand why you'd like to 

348
00:20:27,781 --> 00:20:30,720
cram the whole world into that coherent 
perspective.

349
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,733
But the truth of the matter is,
as long as you hold onto that and won't 

350
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:34,770
sacrifice it,
right,

351
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,410
we'll go through this terrible period of
disillusion.

352
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:41,970
It's always going to produce the same 
tragic consequences.

353
00:20:41,971 --> 00:20:44,400
So as long as you hold onto your belief 
rigidly,

354
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,350
everything around you is going to go 
from bad to works.

355
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,550
Fry says with regards to state's,
he says,

356
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:52,384
a demonic fall as Milton presents.
It involves defining southern rivalry 

357
00:20:56,351 --> 00:20:58,930
with god rather than simple 
disobedience.

358
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,973
And hence the demonic society is a 
sustained and systematic parody of the 

359
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:03,694
divine.
One associated with devils are fallen 

360
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:07,510
angels because it seems far beyond 
normal,

361
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,373
normal human capacity in its powers.
We read avast ending and descending 

362
00:21:12,881 --> 00:21:13,714
angels on Jacobs and play those ladders 
and and similar that there seem to be 

363
00:21:16,721 --> 00:21:17,554
demonic reinforcements in heathen life.
That account for the almost superhuman 

364
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:26,130
grandier of heathen empires,
especially just before they fall too.

365
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,153
Particular notable passages in the old 
testament prophets linked to this theme 

366
00:21:29,961 --> 00:21:30,794
are the denunciation of Babylon in 
Isaiah 14 and attire and is equal 28 

367
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:40,300
Babylon is associated with Lucifer.
The morning star who said to himself,

368
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,790
I will be like the most high.
Okay,

369
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:46,300
so let's translate that into modern 
language and forget about Babylon.

370
00:21:46,301 --> 00:21:49,190
Let's take the Soviet Union for example 
instead,

371
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,620
and let's say something like this,
I will be like the most high.

372
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:54,221
Well,
first of all,

373
00:21:54,221 --> 00:21:57,820
it's not difficult to read Stellan into 
that from a personal perspective,

374
00:21:57,821 --> 00:22:01,780
but then it's more complicated than that
because you can't blame the Soviet Union

375
00:22:01,781 --> 00:22:02,614
on Stallon when the wall fell down.
We know that one third of east Germans 

376
00:22:06,221 --> 00:22:09,130
were KGB informers.
You can't blame that on Stellan.

377
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,173
You have to blame that on the one third 
of the East Germans who were KGB 

378
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,430
informers right?
It's this,

379
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,383
this totalitarian presupposition 
presumption is distributed through the 

380
00:22:18,461 --> 00:22:21,340
whole society and there's a leader in a 
hierarchy and all that,

381
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:22,174
but they're not the people to be 
identified with the fact of the 

382
00:22:25,871 --> 00:22:26,704
totalitarian state.
It's distributed through the whole 

383
00:22:28,301 --> 00:22:32,860
society and it's precisely this.
It's what I don't know.

384
00:22:32,861 --> 00:22:34,990
I don't need,
I don't need what?

385
00:22:34,991 --> 00:22:35,824
I don't know.

386
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:44,340
One of the things I really liked about 
this sort of Christian metaphysical take

387
00:22:44,341 --> 00:22:45,174
on the problem of evil is that it,
it adopts strange first principles like 

388
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,620
if you're an a,
if you're an empirical scientist,

389
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,530
it's very difficult to come to terms 
with the notion of free choice,

390
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,693
right?
Because we don't have deterministic 

391
00:22:57,271 --> 00:22:58,380
models of free choice.
We don't,

392
00:22:58,381 --> 00:22:59,214
we don't know how that might occur.
Although it seems to be a reasonable 

393
00:23:02,011 --> 00:23:06,090
phenomenological observation that if 
there's anything true about existence,

394
00:23:06,091 --> 00:23:09,510
about the facts of existence as it's 
subjectively construed,

395
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,553
the fact that you seem to have the 
faculty of choice seems paramount or 

396
00:23:13,441 --> 00:23:15,690
primary.
Now one might say,

397
00:23:15,691 --> 00:23:16,524
well,
that's just a delusion and we know that 

398
00:23:17,611 --> 00:23:21,450
because our deterministic models have 
been so powerful.

399
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,100
Or One might say,
well,

400
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:23,963
alternatively we're going to presume the
subjective experience to be true and 

401
00:23:27,091 --> 00:23:27,481
say,
well,

402
00:23:27,481 --> 00:23:29,860
are deterministic models just aren't 
sophisticated enough?

403
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,693
And there's no real reason to choose 
between either of those on a priori 

404
00:23:33,211 --> 00:23:35,700
basis right there perhaps equally 
plausible.

405
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,240
And we also might note from the 
deterministic perspective of course,

406
00:23:39,241 --> 00:23:40,074
that if you go down far enough in your 
analysis of physical structures down to 

407
00:23:43,981 --> 00:23:46,850
the quantum level,
say then deterministic models don't hold

408
00:23:46,851 --> 00:23:47,684
it all.
So determinism has its limits at the 

409
00:23:49,401 --> 00:23:52,130
lower end or high resolution into 
physical inquiry.

410
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,620
I have no idea what that might mean for 
free choice.

411
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:55,843
It just means that there are levels of 
analysis that deterministic models do 

412
00:23:58,701 --> 00:23:59,534
not describe.
Christianity takes the stance that the 

413
00:24:04,311 --> 00:24:05,144
subjective,
the subjective sense of freedom is 

414
00:24:09,471 --> 00:24:12,950
accurate and then tries to build the 
world from that point.

415
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:14,503
It presumes that see an axiomatic 
principle and so you have God in 

416
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:20,630
Milton's paradise lost saying with 
regards both to Lucifer,

417
00:24:20,631 --> 00:24:23,300
n two human beings who are fallen,
he says,

418
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,430
so will fall.

419
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:29,870
He and his faithless progeny,
speaking of human beings whose fault,

420
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,950
whose but his own engrade he had of me 
all he could have.

421
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,630
I made him justin.
Right,

422
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:39,080
sufficient to have stood though free to 
fall.

423
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,813
And I like that.
I think that makes a fair bit of sense 

424
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:43,124
to me.
I started to understand this most 

425
00:24:45,141 --> 00:24:45,974
particularly as a consequence of reading
Carl Young because you has this really 

426
00:24:48,561 --> 00:24:49,394
interesting notion and I think it's tied
to the idea in genesis that as soon as 

427
00:24:53,331 --> 00:24:55,910
adam become self conscious,
he hides from God.

428
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,103
So what if it was this,
and we can take an evolutionary tack on 

429
00:24:59,301 --> 00:25:01,040
this too.
What if it was this?

430
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,903
What if it was the case that if you 
never turned away from any phenomenal 

431
00:25:06,891 --> 00:25:07,724
logical evidence,
then you build a personality that would 

432
00:25:10,401 --> 00:25:13,490
be strong enough to withstand tragedy?
What if that was the case?

433
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:14,323
So the idea here being,
let's say you are the person who notes 

434
00:25:17,061 --> 00:25:19,970
that his or her friends don't exactly 
trust,

435
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,700
trust him.
What do you do?

436
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,010
Well to hide away?
You just walk away.

437
00:25:25,011 --> 00:25:26,750
And then of course you never learn 
anything.

438
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,610
But let's say by contrast you say,
well,

439
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:29,300
no,
no.

440
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,420
The first time you get any evidence that
you're not 100% trusted,

441
00:25:32,421 --> 00:25:33,110
you say,
look,

442
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:33,943
I got this Pang in my heart saying the 
communication between you and I is not 

443
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:41,600
exactly straight.
Now something's going on here.

444
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:45,140
Either you haven't got your frame of 
reference with regards to me,

445
00:25:45,141 --> 00:25:45,974
right?
Or there's something wrong with the way 

446
00:25:46,971 --> 00:25:49,040
I'm looking at the world.
Those are the options.

447
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,870
So let's have it out.
You've got this attitude and it's doing,

448
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,520
it's hurting me.
Tell me what you have to say.

449
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:57,050
And I'll tell you what I have to say.

450
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,690
And we'll exchange this pattern 
information.

451
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,140
And as a consequence,
we're gold.

452
00:26:01,141 --> 00:26:02,810
Both going to walk away a little bit 
more.

453
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,090
Well put together.
So God says,

454
00:26:05,091 --> 00:26:05,750
yeah,
yeah.

455
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,583
You know,
people get distorted and twisted and 

456
00:26:08,931 --> 00:26:09,764
bent and warped,
but that's their own problem 

457
00:26:11,931 --> 00:26:12,764
fundamentally.
Cause they have this capacity just to 

458
00:26:14,061 --> 00:26:15,680
turn away.
And as they turned away,

459
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:18,650
they get weaker.
And as they get weaker,

460
00:26:18,651 --> 00:26:21,350
the world gets worse around them because
they can't deal with it.

461
00:26:21,351 --> 00:26:23,030
And they keep making mistakes.
And well,

462
00:26:23,031 --> 00:26:24,890
that's a terrible consequence and all 
that.

463
00:26:24,891 --> 00:26:28,010
But if they just wouldn't turn away to 
begin with,

464
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,000
then there'd be no problem.
And there wouldn't be no problem because

465
00:26:32,001 --> 00:26:35,120
the world would stop being tragic 
because the world's tragic,

466
00:26:35,121 --> 00:26:35,840
right?
I mean,

467
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,000
there you are little and vulnerable and 
you know,

468
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:42,290
things can roll right over you.
The world would never lose its tragedy.

469
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:47,100
But the idea be instead that you could 
handle it without becoming corrupted and

470
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:49,980
that would be sufficient.
So the idea would be,

471
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:55,170
it's a tough situation,
all things considered,

472
00:26:55,171 --> 00:26:58,410
but it's also an interesting and 
compelling and beautiful one.

473
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,423
And it may be that if you didn't turn 
away the interesting and beautiful and 

474
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:06,830
compelling aspect would overwhelm the 
tragic aspect and that would be fine.
