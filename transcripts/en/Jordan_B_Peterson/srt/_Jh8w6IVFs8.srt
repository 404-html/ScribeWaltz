1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:06,470
On Tuesday I started to talk to you
about trait theory and now I'm going to

2
00:00:07,411 --> 00:00:11,040
make a jump to biology.
And that that's a strange jump in some

3
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:15,120
sense because the two levels of analysis
are relatively disconnected.

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,610
But what's happening right now at the,
at the sort of outer echelons of

5
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:22,260
personality research is that

6
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:24,853
okay,

7
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:29,890
the workers at the forefront of the
field are trying to integrate what's

8
00:00:29,891 --> 00:00:33,820
been established at the statistical
level of analysis with what's known at

9
00:00:33,821 --> 00:00:38,170
the psychobiological level.
And so this emerging science is known as

10
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:39,610
personality neuroscience.

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,453
MMM.

12
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:45,650
It's developed in a rather strange way
because

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,570
the traits that were identified that I
discussed with you on Tuesday,

14
00:00:50,571 --> 00:00:55,571
the big five traits all emerged as a
consequence of the statistical analysis

15
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:00,260
of,
of descriptors characteristic mostly of

16
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:02,270
the English language,
although it's been duplicated in other

17
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:07,271
languages.
So in some sense it was in a theoretical

18
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:08,510
model,
right?

19
00:01:08,511 --> 00:01:13,511
It just came out of the linguistic data.
So there was no real initial inferences

20
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:18,650
about brain area or neurological
activity or,

21
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,800
or anything like that to drive the
formulation of the big five model.

22
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:26,330
And instead the big five model came
first and then people started thinking,

23
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,960
okay,
can this be put into alignment with what

24
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:36,560
we know about the brain?
And so people have been hitting that

25
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:39,140
pretty hard.
I would say over about the last,

26
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,450
it's probably 30 years,
something like that because Hans Isaac

27
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:46,370
and his student,
Jeffrey Gray,

28
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:52,180
we're pretty far along on this kind of
thinking by say 1982 when gray published

29
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,460
his book,
the neuropsychology of anxiety,

30
00:01:55,461 --> 00:02:00,461
which the paper you're reading now,
a model of the limbic system and Basal

31
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:04,220
Ganglia,
Basal Ganglia application stay anxiety

32
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:05,060
and schizophrenia.

33
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:10,570
That's a very short summary of the book.
That gray published in 1982 which has

34
00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:13,030
been incredibly influential.
Um,

35
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,220
if you're interested in going on in
psychology,

36
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:19,400
especially on the scientific end,
but I would say pretty much regardless

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,010
if you're interested in going on in
psychology,

38
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:24,860
that's a,
that's a very useful book to tackle.

39
00:02:24,861 --> 00:02:28,010
There's a newer version and it was
published by gray and Mcnaughton and I

40
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:31,400
think 2000 something like that.
It's hard going,

41
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,730
like,
and you may have found the paper that we

42
00:02:33,731 --> 00:02:35,330
too gray was a very,
very,

43
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,280
unfortunately,
he died a few years ago.

44
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,440
He was a very,
very smart person.

45
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,980
And he knew the animal literature on
behavior,

46
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:43,790
neuro,
Adam,

47
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,200
neuroanatomy and neuropsychopharmacology
inside out and backwards.

48
00:02:48,201 --> 00:02:52,670
And so whenever he defined a term,
he always made sure that the term was

49
00:02:52,671 --> 00:02:56,390
intelligible at a behavioral level and
at an anatomical level.

50
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,790
And at a pharmacological level,
it had to,

51
00:02:59,170 --> 00:02:59,651
you know,
the,

52
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:00,400
the,
the,

53
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,700
the ideas that he were developing had to
make sense that these multiple levels of

54
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:08,500
analysis before he would accept them as,
as genuine and gray did a remarkable job

55
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:13,501
of extending our knowledge of the
biological and the evolutionary basis of

56
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,080
at least the first two personality
traits,

57
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,500
say extroversion and neuroticism,
roughly corresponding to positive and

58
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:21,334
negative emotion.

59
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,653
So,
um,

60
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,640
so that's partly why you're reading grey
and grey theories.

61
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:31,090
Also cybernetic theory.
Cybernetic theory is a,

62
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:37,140
is a variation of a theory developed by
an mit cognitive scientist named Norbert

63
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,013
Wiener,
who,

64
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:43,180
who was an early ai artificial
intelligence researcher.

65
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,810
And he proposed that,
that,

66
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:50,620
that intelligent entities were goal
directed and that they organize their

67
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:55,270
behavior around reducing deviations from
a goal.

68
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,720
Well they were approaching it once they
had decided what it would be.

69
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:03,220
Now that's also proved to be incredibly
influential.

70
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,590
Um,
we'll talk a fair bit about cybernetic

71
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:07,790
models as we progress.
Um,

72
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,050
so gray is sort of a combination of
artificial intelligence,

73
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,220
cybernetic theorizing and then an
incredible amount of data that's come in

74
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:18,640
from animal behavioral research.
And as far as I'm concerned,

75
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:22,210
most of the things that we know about
the brain have been derived from animal

76
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:23,400
research.
Um,

77
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,100
the animal researchers tended to be
extraordinarily careful scientists.

78
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,850
They were influenced by um,
um,

79
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:33,700
be bf skinner who established the sort
of the initial

80
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,320
theoretical basis for understanding how
animals learn.

81
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:41,140
We'll talk about that a little bit next
class.

82
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,820
So anyways,
that's the,

83
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,060
that's the context within which gray is
working.

84
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:49,630
Luddu these are all papers you're going
to read except the third one,

85
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,260
which is optional.
Luddu is also an emotional,

86
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,400
he's an effect of neuroscientists.
So He's a someone who studies emotions

87
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,451
mostly.
Again,

88
00:04:58,451 --> 00:05:03,451
animals and Luddu has done a lot to sort
of add some of the pieces that were

89
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:07,450
missing in,
in gray gray probably concentrated a

90
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:09,940
little bit too much on a brain area
called the hippocampus,

91
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:15,270
which is the brain area that sort of
lets you know if it's reasonable to be

92
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:21,220
calm where you're currently situated.
And so what the hippocampus does in some

93
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:25,630
sense is compare what it is that you
want to have happen with what is

94
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,170
happening.

95
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:29,320
And if the two things are the same,
then you're comp.

96
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:34,770
So it's a match mismatch detector and it
has access not only to memory but also

97
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:38,230
two formulations of say the desired
future.

98
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,580
Um,
Swanson,

99
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,550
I had people read the Swanson paper last
year,

100
00:05:45,551 --> 00:05:47,650
I put it in your reading list is
optional.

101
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,710
Um,
it's worth hacking through if you can

102
00:05:50,711 --> 00:05:52,660
manage it.
It's very hard paper though,

103
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,480
which is why it took it out of the
required reading list.

104
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:57,800
The reason I like Swanson,
we're going to talk fair bit about him

105
00:05:57,801 --> 00:06:01,610
today is
Swanson's not a psychologist.

106
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:06,611
He's actually a developmental neuro.
I can never say this properly.

107
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:11,540
And
he studies developmental anatomy,

108
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,560
we'll,
we'll do that.

109
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,380
Um,
and so he's very interested in how the

110
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:19,370
brain unfolds across time during
embryonic development and then up into

111
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:22,160
maturity.
And so he understands the brain

112
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,480
differently than a psychologist would
because a psychologist tends to analyze

113
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:27,400
the brain,
you know,

114
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,270
as a sort of mature thing usually in
adulthood but,

115
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,770
but for Swanson it's a much more living
and transforming system and he's trying

116
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:40,931
to set forth a Schema for understanding
brain anatomy and also associating that

117
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:43,670
with function.

118
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,800
You know,
and you might think that that's a well

119
00:06:45,801 --> 00:06:50,801
advanced science already that we know
how to segment up the brain and we know,

120
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:55,280
you know roughly what the piece is due.
But we haven't even really managed to

121
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,800
establish the terminology pro property
yet.

122
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,550
It's very neuro neuroscience is a very
new field and,

123
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:06,530
and there's no limit to the number of
things that we don't know about it,

124
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,200
including even the basic classification
structure.

125
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:13,490
Now Swanson has put forth a very
intelligent basic classification

126
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:15,380
structure.
And part of the reason that I think it's

127
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:20,381
so relevant to a personality class is
because it maps in a beautiful way onto

128
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,080
some of the things that we've already
talked about,

129
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:27,410
especially piaget.
So there's a nice direct mapping of

130
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:32,411
Piaget's developmental theory onto
Swanson's theory of neurodevelopment and

131
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:35,270
then of neural function.
And that's completely accidental because

132
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,940
Swanson never cites piaget,
so they're non overlapping literature.

133
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,270
So I kind of liked that because you
know,

134
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:45,290
if something pops up in one place with
one method and pops up another place

135
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:49,280
with a completely different method,
especially if those two places are

136
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:51,770
distinct in terms of their historical
development,

137
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,320
you might start thinking there's
actually something there.

138
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,240
You know,
it's sort of like seeing something in

139
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:58,370
hearing it.
At the same time you've got two

140
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:02,060
independent sources of data.
It's like triangulation in a sense.

141
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:05,720
And so it was very exciting to me to
come across this paper by Swanson.

142
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,080
Um,
I think he's one of only two scientists

143
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:10,910
I ever wrote a fan letter too.
I mean,

144
00:08:10,911 --> 00:08:13,430
really it's a brilliant paper.
And then,

145
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,450
uh,
there's,

146
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,410
there's other reasons why it maps onto
what we're going to talk about too,

147
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:22,460
because Swanson also points out quite
clearly the function of the,

148
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,360
he's kind of roughly separates the
hypothalamus into two halves.

149
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,523
And,
uh,

150
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,860
he points out that they have quite
distinct functions and the functions

151
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:33,650
also map onto some of the things that
we've been talking about it in a very

152
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:36,560
lovely way.
And so there's a lot of reasons to,

153
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,860
to go through Swanson's paper carefully.
You know,

154
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:43,950
it's like 50 pages long,
but the guy put it in some sense,

155
00:08:43,951 --> 00:08:46,340
his whole life's work is in those 50
pages.

156
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:47,360
So,
you know,

157
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,230
even if it takes you 12 hours or 20
hours to read it,

158
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,460
it's like,
that's not too bad.

159
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:56,340
If you're going to extract out like 30
years solid research.

160
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,900
Gray's book is the same.
Like,

161
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,880
do you read that book you've got,
if you read it and understand it,

162
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:06,450
you've basically got a fair chunk of
neuro anatomy,

163
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,130
a lot of animal behavioral analysis.
So,

164
00:09:11,131 --> 00:09:12,630
um,
behaviorism in general,

165
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,930
a lot of psychopharmacology and a lot of
understanding of the functional

166
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,350
significance of the brain's major.

167
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,720
Neurotransmitter systems.
You can get all of that from gray's

168
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:25,410
book.
That's,

169
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:26,730
that's a killer book.
You know,

170
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:30,390
if you can extract all that out.
So anyways,

171
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,960
carver and Scheier also take a
cybernetic perspective.

172
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,120
Fundamentally,
they're more cognitive scientists.

173
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:39,420
You're going to find their paper a
little bit farther down the road,

174
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:43,920
but they're also very interested in how
creatures,

175
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:48,030
human beings in particular select goals
and then align themselves with those

176
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,770
goals.
And for our purposes,

177
00:09:49,771 --> 00:09:52,110
we're going to talk a fair bit about
motivation today.

178
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:56,190
And the distinction between motivation
and emotion is not clear.

179
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,910
They're both words that sort of function
within an linguistic context.

180
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:03,840
But for the sake of argument,
and of course all the emotions aren't

181
00:10:03,841 --> 00:10:06,060
the same.
It's not like there's one circuit that

182
00:10:06,061 --> 00:10:08,790
subsumes emotion.
There's multiple circuits that subsume

183
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,610
emotion and they're not identical
circuits,

184
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,130
you know?
So it isn't like every emotion is a

185
00:10:14,131 --> 00:10:15,750
variant of the same thing.

186
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,300
It's not.
And it's the same with the motivation.

187
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:21,420
So they're very loose groupings,
motivation and emotion.

188
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:26,700
But for the purposes of our argument,
we're going to make this case roughly

189
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,850
motivations,
set goals and roughly emotions orient

190
00:10:33,151 --> 00:10:35,700
you in relationship to those goals.
Now,

191
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,560
like I said,
those categories overlap.

192
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,950
Anger is usually considered an emotion
and it often has a goal,

193
00:10:40,951 --> 00:10:43,260
right?
The goal is to hit something or hurt

194
00:10:43,261 --> 00:10:45,960
something.
That's one possible goal.

195
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:50,340
So emotions can segway quite easily into
motivational states,

196
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:54,030
but whatever.
You got to use a category system of some

197
00:10:54,031 --> 00:10:56,820
sort to clear clarify things.
And so that's what we're going to,

198
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,370
we're going to,
uh,

199
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,690
pursue motivations,
set goals.

200
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,060
It's actually more complicated than
that.

201
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,460
You know,
I showed you that little oval diagram

202
00:11:05,461 --> 00:11:09,000
with a desired future and unbearable
present,

203
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,390
so to speak.
Motivations actually don't just set

204
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:16,380
goals,
they also prime behavior and they also

205
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:19,650
set up the perceptual frame within which
you interpret the world.

206
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,520
So for example,
if you're hungry and isn't just that

207
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:26,040
you're driven to eat,
first of all,

208
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:29,340
eating is a very complex behavior,
especially if it's associated with food

209
00:11:29,341 --> 00:11:31,650
preparation.
Say you're the,

210
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:36,651
the systems that you've used in the past
to procure food and then to ingest it

211
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,320
are sort of disinhibited by the
motivational state.

212
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:45,180
So they're at the ready and then your
sensory system is tuned so that it's

213
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:48,540
going to focus on those things that are
relevant to eating and tune out

214
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,210
everything else.
So the motivational state also does

215
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:55,690
perceptual tuning and there's a felt
component of it as well.

216
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,540
So it's not,
it's,

217
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:03,370
it's not reasonable to only say that
motivation sets goals or that it drives

218
00:12:03,371 --> 00:12:05,080
behavior.
It does three things,

219
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:06,820
goal setting,
behavioral driving,

220
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,410
plus it provides a perceptual schema
within which those other two things make

221
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:14,680
sense.
And so a motivated state in some sense

222
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:16,510
is like a little micro personality.

223
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,770
It's only got one aim.
It's sort of a one eyed micro

224
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:21,790
personality,
you know,

225
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:25,180
so it's only aiming at one thing,
but it still has all the other aspects

226
00:12:25,181 --> 00:12:26,860
of personality.
So

227
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,130
sort of,
you know,

228
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:33,890
for me that that aligns nicely with the
psychoanalytic idea that you know,

229
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,743
you're,
you're,

230
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,860
you're a,
you're a loose aggregation of multiple

231
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,290
fragmented personalities.
You know,

232
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:44,380
they're sort of coherently tied together
at the highest level of analysis,

233
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:46,120
but they can go off and do their own
thing.

234
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,010
You see that in situations,
for example,

235
00:12:48,011 --> 00:12:52,900
like eating disorders where the hunger
system itself starts to become almost a

236
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:56,020
spun off part of the personality and the
rest of the personality.

237
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:59,140
Then wars with that.
And that's sort of in some sense that's

238
00:12:59,141 --> 00:13:02,530
like cortex versus hypothalamus and you
never win.

239
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,100
CORTEX does not win over hypothalamus.
The hypothalamus is what keeps you

240
00:13:06,101 --> 00:13:06,934
alive.

241
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,670
So that's one of the things that keeps
you alive.

242
00:13:09,671 --> 00:13:12,460
You could do without your cortex,
but you cannot do without your

243
00:13:12,461 --> 00:13:16,000
hypothalamus.
And the connections stretching upwards

244
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:18,520
from the hypothalamus,
which is a very old brain area,

245
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:23,020
are much more powerful than the
connections coming down from the cortex

246
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:26,200
to modulate the hypothalamus.
And that's another indication of just

247
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:28,510
exactly who's in charge when the chips
are down,

248
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,280
you know?
And that's why it's so hard for you to

249
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:33,880
override your basic emotions or
motivational states.

250
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:38,530
It's like the system evolved to keep you
alive and it's not particularly willing

251
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:43,531
to give up control in a sense given that
your survival is staked on its function.

252
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,560
So
it's useful to know that because you

253
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:47,951
know,
if you,

254
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:48,784
if you,
if you,

255
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,900
if you pursue psychology and you stay
within the human side of psychology,

256
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,140
say instead of wandering off into the
animal behavioral research,

257
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,270
you'll see that most human psychologists
and neuropsychologists are very cortical

258
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:01,990
centric.

259
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,320
They really like to think that it's the
newly evolved parts of the brain that

260
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:09,640
are in charge and that's just not right.
The newly evolved parts of the brain are

261
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:13,120
in charge only when nothing is bothering
you.

262
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,640
Like if you're not hungry,
you're not thirsty,

263
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,040
you're not too excited,
you're not too curious.

264
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,960
You're not too terrified.
You know,

265
00:14:19,961 --> 00:14:22,510
you're not too cold,
you're not too warm any of those,

266
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:27,900
then the cortex is in charge.
But if you deviate substantially across

267
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:32,110
any of those dimensions,
the probability that control over your

268
00:14:32,111 --> 00:14:35,740
behavioral output in your perceptions,
it's going to devolve down the

269
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:39,580
evolutionary hierarchy to more
primordial brain areas is extremely

270
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:40,660
likely.
You know,

271
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:42,880
and you see the same thing happens.
You know,

272
00:14:42,881 --> 00:14:44,740
maybe you're having a discussion with
someone,

273
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:48,160
right?
And they exhaust the limits of your

274
00:14:48,161 --> 00:14:51,130
rational knowledge,
which means basically they out argue,

275
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,760
well what happens?

276
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:56,900
Well usually what happens is that people
cry or they get angry and it's like

277
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,380
they're out of cortex.
It's bang right down to the more,

278
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:04,580
the lower and more primary
evolutionarily determined systems.

279
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,280
So okay,
now we're going to,

280
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,130
we're going to take a look at how the
brain functions in general.

281
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,830
And so we're going to start pretty
general and then we're going to go

282
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:16,220
narrow.
And the first thing that you might want

283
00:15:16,221 --> 00:15:19,760
to think about is what problem exactly
is the brain wrestling with.

284
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:24,790
And the major problem is that reality is
so complicated.

285
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,760
It has so many layers and so many
interconnected causal links that it's

286
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,260
complex beyond comprehension.
And that's a big problem.

287
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:38,040
I mean,
you think about all the subatomic

288
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,610
complexity,
that's a horrible thing.

289
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,240
Then there's the complexity at the
atomic level and that's,

290
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:45,320
you know,
pretty overwhelming.

291
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:48,290
And then there's the molecular level,
which makes the atomic level looks

292
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,124
simple.

293
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:54,080
And then there's all the comp
exceedingly complex structures that

294
00:15:54,081 --> 00:15:56,990
emerge out of the molecular level,
especially in living organisms.

295
00:15:56,991 --> 00:15:59,960
So that would be roughly at the organ
level of existence,

296
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:02,570
you know,
and then there's you as a totality with

297
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:04,100
your brain,
which is,

298
00:16:04,101 --> 00:16:08,030
and the brain is so much more complex
than everything else in the universe

299
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:11,450
that it's not even in the same category.
So there are estimates,

300
00:16:11,451 --> 00:16:13,040
for example,
by Gerard Edelman,

301
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:15,050
that there are more connections in your
brain,

302
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:18,890
more patterns of connections in your
brain than there are subatomic particles

303
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:20,300
in the universe.
So,

304
00:16:20,301 --> 00:16:22,700
you know,
that's one major league complex thing

305
00:16:22,701 --> 00:16:24,800
and there's lots of them around and you
know,

306
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:28,460
they're all integrated into families.
And then,

307
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,050
uh,
you know,

308
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,370
roughly tribal grouping,
some of which get large enough to be

309
00:16:34,371 --> 00:16:36,680
nations.
And then that's all embedded inside of

310
00:16:36,681 --> 00:16:40,010
some biological system and so on and so
forth,

311
00:16:40,011 --> 00:16:42,530
all the way out to the limits of the
cosmos.

312
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:46,070
I mean,
this is one complicated place and you

313
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:47,630
know,
your job in,

314
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:52,370
in large part is to understand it,
but also not to become overwhelmed by it

315
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:56,540
because you have to simplify it down to
the point where you can sort of think

316
00:16:56,541 --> 00:17:00,200
about one thing and do one thing.
And so you have to screen all of that

317
00:17:00,201 --> 00:17:05,201
out so that the complexity,
complexity doesn't overwhelm you when

318
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:09,920
you're attempting to do anything,
anything simple even to look at yourself

319
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:12,830
in the mirror,
which is also a very complicated thing

320
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:15,230
to do.
Part of the problem your brain is,

321
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:20,560
is always facing is
what can I ignore?

322
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,550
And the answer to that is,
well,

323
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:25,180
you need to ignore almost everything.
And,

324
00:17:25,181 --> 00:17:27,530
and that's,
that's a problem because of course it's

325
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:31,670
not always obvious what it's okay,
what's okay for you to ignore,

326
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,430
you know?
And that changes on you suddenly too,

327
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,010
because you know,
because you have imperfect knowledge,

328
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:40,250
you may think something's irrelevant and
it turns out to be of critical

329
00:17:40,251 --> 00:17:41,360
importance.
It's deadly.

330
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,780
It's a deadly,
deadly difficult problem.

331
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,200
And so one of the ways that we solve
this is we're actually blind to,

332
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,110
to,
to almost everything.

333
00:17:52,111 --> 00:17:53,610
You know,
our sensory

334
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,040
input is limited by our physiological
limitations,

335
00:17:58,041 --> 00:17:59,210
certainly.
So there's like,

336
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,040
in terms of vision,
we only see a very small,

337
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:05,870
just a little slice of the whole
electromagnetic spectrum.

338
00:18:05,871 --> 00:18:08,290
And it's the same with sounds.
And you know,

339
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,880
we can only touch things that are
basically within our reach.

340
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:14,810
And so that limits things substantially.
And then there are also things we can't

341
00:18:14,811 --> 00:18:16,820
detect.
Like we're not very good at detecting,

342
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,580
um,
like we don't have the same ability that

343
00:18:19,581 --> 00:18:24,581
say it was said platypuses and some fish
can detect electromagnetic disturbances

344
00:18:24,831 --> 00:18:27,530
around them,
on their skin and like their senses that

345
00:18:27,531 --> 00:18:30,080
we don't have.
So we'reZ ,

346
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,410
we're narrowed a fair bit by what it is
that we're able to perceive.

347
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,510
Um,
and we're actually narrowed,

348
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:36,720
okay.

349
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,420
In what we can perceive far more than
anybody ever.

350
00:18:39,421 --> 00:18:40,950
Guests.
So I'm going to show you a little video

351
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:42,320
here and,
uh,

352
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,660
hopefully it will be loud enough so that
you can hear it.

353
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:20,130
Okay.
16 passes.

354
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:37,210
Did you spot the gorilla
for people who hadn't seen or heard

355
00:19:37,641 --> 00:19:39,260
about it?
Did you like this before?

356
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:44,560
About half miss the gorilla.
If you knew about the gorilla,

357
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:48,710
you probably saw it,
but did you notice the curtain changing

358
00:19:48,711 --> 00:19:51,350
color or the player on the black team
leaving the game?

359
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:59,410
[inaudible]

360
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,620
there goes a player is changing from red
to gold.

361
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:19,790
You've offered this other,
the invisible gorilla.com.

362
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,930
So how many of you saw the gorilla?
No,

363
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,611
let's,
let's do it.

364
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:40,070
The,
okay.

365
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:44,100
Yeah.
How many of you had known about this

366
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:45,450
video beforehand?
Yeah,

367
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:46,470
the gorilla part of it.
Yeah.

368
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:48,310
So you guys don't count now.
And then,

369
00:20:48,311 --> 00:20:49,960
you know,
I get someone who's seen it before and

370
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:52,150
they still miss the damn gorilla.
So that's pretty funny.

371
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,470
So,
but,

372
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:57,070
but of course Simon,
Dan Simon set this up because his

373
00:20:57,071 --> 00:20:59,410
original video got so popular,
you know,

374
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,620
virally popular that everybody has seen
the invisible gorilla.

375
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:03,790
And so,
you know,

376
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,310
now he's showing you that while you
think you're smart,

377
00:21:06,311 --> 00:21:09,070
you've been clued in to how blind you
are and it turns out you're not any

378
00:21:09,071 --> 00:21:10,690
smarter than you are to begin with.
Right.

379
00:21:10,691 --> 00:21:13,960
So how many people saw all three things
that changed?

380
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,860
Oh,
you've seen it before.

381
00:21:16,861 --> 00:21:17,281
So,
okay.

382
00:21:17,281 --> 00:21:18,240
And how many didn't?

383
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,440
Okay.

384
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:19,951
Yeah.
Okay.

385
00:21:19,951 --> 00:21:23,630
So the vast majority of you missed one
or more of the things that change?

386
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:23,941
No,
in the,

387
00:21:23,941 --> 00:21:27,960
not really trivial things like the
disappearance of a person from six

388
00:21:27,961 --> 00:21:31,950
people that's fairly major and you know,
the whole background changed color and

389
00:21:31,951 --> 00:21:34,530
you might think you'd clue into that.
And so,

390
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:39,360
so the weird thing is even when you're
primed to notice what you're supposed to

391
00:21:39,361 --> 00:21:42,360
notice,
which is to say count the balls and you

392
00:21:42,361 --> 00:21:44,280
know that something weird is going to
happen,

393
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,010
you're not,
that's still doesn't prime you enough so

394
00:21:47,011 --> 00:21:49,410
that you can keep track of all the weird
things that are happening.

395
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,930
And like this was an absolutely
staggering experiment when,

396
00:21:52,931 --> 00:21:56,820
when it was first shown,
the psychologist were just like knocked

397
00:21:56,821 --> 00:22:01,020
over by it because the hypothesis up to
that point had been always that,

398
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,240
you know,
you could concentrate on what you were

399
00:22:03,241 --> 00:22:06,000
concentrating on,
but if something anomalous or unexpected

400
00:22:06,001 --> 00:22:08,160
happened,
your attention would be automatically

401
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:09,000
devoted towards it.

402
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,530
And of course that's what people would
think,

403
00:22:10,531 --> 00:22:12,150
right?
You'd think that if you're watching

404
00:22:12,151 --> 00:22:17,100
people play basket ball and a gorilla
walks into the you know,

405
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:21,520
area and it's not small that of course
you'd be surprised and you'd see it and

406
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,790
it turns out that that's just wrong.
And you know,

407
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,730
it tells you a lot about how your
nervous system is set up.

408
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,580
So you're focusing on counting the
balls.

409
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:34,230
And so for some reason getting the
correct answer to the question,

410
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,620
how many times are the,
is the ball thrown back and forth turns

411
00:22:37,621 --> 00:22:40,020
out to be motivationally significant?
Why?

412
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:41,620
Yeah.

413
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,540
Like why,
why,

414
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:43,500
why did you,
you know,

415
00:22:43,501 --> 00:22:45,150
you got the instructions.
Fair enough.

416
00:22:45,151 --> 00:22:50,151
But why did you listen to them?
Oh sure it does.

417
00:22:51,231 --> 00:22:54,200
But the question is why did you even
comply with the instructions?

418
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,110
Yeah.
Who said that?

419
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,730
Because you want to get the answer
right.

420
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:04,490
Why did you care if you got the answer
right?

421
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,720
Well think about it for a minute.
Like what yes means yes.

422
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:12,471
Ah,
that's right.

423
00:23:12,471 --> 00:23:14,870
So that's one possibility.
It's like instantly you sort of

424
00:23:14,871 --> 00:23:17,660
interpreted as a little cognitive tasks
maybe,

425
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,550
and then you want to see if you can do
it.

426
00:23:19,551 --> 00:23:22,640
And you know also that taps into your
hierarchy of values.

427
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:26,720
Part of your value is I want to be maybe
a smart and competent person or I want

428
00:23:26,721 --> 00:23:30,350
to be at least as smart and competent as
everyone else is playing this game.

429
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,890
And so you know,
the instruction taps into a preexistent

430
00:23:33,891 --> 00:23:35,690
value structure and then it's
motivating.

431
00:23:35,691 --> 00:23:36,590
Okay.
So Yup.

432
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,930
What compliance as well.
Yes.

433
00:23:38,931 --> 00:23:40,500
That's another thing.
It's like the,

434
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:43,910
you know,
the room in some ways it's set up to

435
00:23:43,911 --> 00:23:45,890
ensure a degree of,
right?

436
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:48,350
Because there's an,
there's an implicit story in the room,

437
00:23:48,351 --> 00:23:52,310
which is if I'm at the front of it.
And so that sort of makes me at the top

438
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:55,550
of the dominance hierarchy and the fact
that you're here means you've already

439
00:23:55,551 --> 00:23:59,570
bought into that presupposition.
And so it's a logical thing to do to

440
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:02,090
play along with the game.
So yes.

441
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,543
Yeah,

442
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,700
true.
That that's more like the playing a game

443
00:24:09,701 --> 00:24:10,301
issue,
right?

444
00:24:10,301 --> 00:24:12,430
Is that while maybe something
interesting will happen.

445
00:24:12,431 --> 00:24:13,510
Okay.
Right,

446
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:14,440
right,
right.

447
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,240
Okay.
So there's a variety of reasons why you

448
00:24:16,241 --> 00:24:19,960
might listen to the instructions,
but the point is the instructions

449
00:24:19,961 --> 00:24:24,910
actually tap into your motivation in
your intrinsic motivation enough so that

450
00:24:24,911 --> 00:24:28,570
you will in fact attempt to play the
game.

451
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:33,400
And then as soon as you play the game,
what happens while you focus your very

452
00:24:33,401 --> 00:24:37,510
limited attentional resources precisely
on what it is that you're supposed to

453
00:24:37,511 --> 00:24:39,460
do.
Now we could talk a little bit about how

454
00:24:39,461 --> 00:24:40,810
the visual field,
it's set up.

455
00:24:40,811 --> 00:24:41,980
So you know,
you,

456
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,920
you notice that like if I'm looking
around the room,

457
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,530
if I want to see you,
all of you,

458
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:51,430
I can't just stand here and look
straight ahead because all you people

459
00:24:51,431 --> 00:24:52,570
over here,
you're like,

460
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,630
I can't see if I'm looking straight
ahead.

461
00:24:55,630 --> 00:25:00,630
I can't see the faces of anyone past
here and I can only see them sort of as

462
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,010
blurs and unless they move and if they
move up something then I can see the

463
00:25:06,011 --> 00:25:07,000
movement.
But I can't,

464
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,420
it's not clear to me what's moving.
And it's the same for the people over

465
00:25:10,421 --> 00:25:12,100
here.
The only person I can really see right

466
00:25:12,101 --> 00:25:14,950
now is the,
is the woman who's sitting there in the

467
00:25:14,951 --> 00:25:16,930
white sweater.
All the rest of you are like,

468
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,410
and the person to the right.
I can more or less,

469
00:25:20,411 --> 00:25:23,350
as long as I look at her,
I could more or less see that he's

470
00:25:23,351 --> 00:25:26,800
dressed in gray,
but I can't see his face at all now as

471
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,390
he nodded his head and I could pick that
up.

472
00:25:28,391 --> 00:25:32,740
So what's very strange about your visual
system and your sensory systems are like

473
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:33,730
this in,
in,

474
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:34,923
in,
uh,

475
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,190
you know all your sensory systems are
like this is that you have a tiny little

476
00:25:39,191 --> 00:25:42,400
point of focus where the information is
rich.

477
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,630
And that's partly because,
so the center of your eye is the full vr

478
00:25:46,631 --> 00:25:48,910
and it's most densely,
ah,

479
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:52,090
it's most densely packed with cells.
But more importantly,

480
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:55,420
each of the cells in your phobia,
which is the very center of your vision,

481
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,650
you can tell when someone's pointing
their full view for via at you because

482
00:25:59,651 --> 00:26:00,431
then you,
you know,

483
00:26:00,431 --> 00:26:03,820
you have the sense that they're looking
at you and human beings are unbelievably

484
00:26:03,821 --> 00:26:08,800
good at figuring out when someone is
pointing their full via at u w we can,

485
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:12,570
we can detect I um,
what would you call it?

486
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:18,040
Deviation from direct gaze with an
accuracy that's absolutely remarkable.

487
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,190
Now each of those little cells in the
phobia is connected.

488
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:26,280
Each of the one sells is connected to
like 20,000 cells at the first level of

489
00:26:26,531 --> 00:26:31,531
the hierarchy of the visual system.
And so the reason that your whole high

490
00:26:31,601 --> 00:26:34,870
isn't full vs cause your head would have
to be this big to manage it.

491
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:39,870
So you know w what's evolved is sort of
a compromise is that in the center of

492
00:26:40,271 --> 00:26:44,160
your vision it's the center of your
vision is very detailed.

493
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,160
And,
and then what you do is you zip that

494
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,470
center around like snap,
snap,

495
00:26:49,471 --> 00:26:50,011
snap,
snap,

496
00:26:50,011 --> 00:26:50,731
snap,
snap.

497
00:26:50,731 --> 00:26:54,870
And your brain sorta makes a amalgamated
picture out of all those little

498
00:26:54,871 --> 00:26:57,720
snapshots and you know,
then it weaves it together.

499
00:26:57,721 --> 00:27:02,721
So it seems to you like it's a
continuous what a continuous movie of

500
00:27:02,731 --> 00:27:04,950
consciousness even though it's really
not.

501
00:27:04,951 --> 00:27:08,790
And then the sides of your eyes,
the periphery of your eyes.

502
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,290
Well they don't have the same potency as
the full via and so they,

503
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:16,230
they kind of play a triage game.
It's like,

504
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,630
okay,
I can't see if I'm looking straight

505
00:27:18,631 --> 00:27:20,010
ahead,
I can't see everything.

506
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:25,320
What might I use as an indication that I
should move my gaze from where I'm

507
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:26,460
looking to somewhere else.

508
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:30,120
And one answer to that is movement.
So the periphery is pretty good at

509
00:27:30,121 --> 00:27:33,270
picking up movement.
And so often if you see movement in the

510
00:27:33,271 --> 00:27:35,730
periphery,
then you'll move your fovial vision to

511
00:27:35,731 --> 00:27:38,400
where the movement was and then you
know,

512
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,280
then you can keep track of what's
changing.

513
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:45,870
So what your brain sort of assumes is
that when you're looking at something,

514
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:51,680
everything else is irrelevant.
And it's also,

515
00:27:51,721 --> 00:27:53,730
it also sort of fades into the
background.

516
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,100
And so that's what's happening with the
gorilla video.

517
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:00,030
And so the part of the reason you can't
see the damn gorillas cause he's dressed

518
00:28:00,031 --> 00:28:03,210
in black like the players.
And so when you're focusing on the

519
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:07,350
basketball,
all the block moving things look the

520
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:09,150
same.
You know,

521
00:28:09,151 --> 00:28:10,980
there's no distinction between them at
all.

522
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,920
And then the background of the curtain,
it's like,

523
00:28:13,921 --> 00:28:18,921
well first of all,
why would you be primed to see the

524
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:19,980
curtain change color?

525
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,950
Like things just don't do that in real
life,

526
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:23,843
right?
I mean,

527
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,730
big objects don't suddenly change color
very,

528
00:28:26,731 --> 00:28:27,840
very seldomly.
So,

529
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:32,700
and Bob and more importantly,
the fact that the gorilla shows up,

530
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:37,980
the fact that one player leaves and the
fact that the curtains change color has

531
00:28:37,981 --> 00:28:40,950
no bearing whatsoever on whether or not
you can complete the task.

532
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:44,370
Right?
So it doesn't matter if you ignore the

533
00:28:44,371 --> 00:28:49,350
information and that's because it's
irrelevant in terms of the interpretive

534
00:28:49,351 --> 00:28:51,330
frame,
the motivated interpretive frame that

535
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:55,710
you're applying to the scene.
And so the rule for perception is don't

536
00:28:55,711 --> 00:28:58,800
pay attention to anything that isn't
directly relevant to the desired

537
00:28:58,801 --> 00:29:02,910
outcome.
Now exactly how you calculate what you

538
00:29:02,911 --> 00:29:06,600
can pay attention to and what you can't.
That's very complicated.

539
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:07,710
It's,
I mean,

540
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,860
you build that knowledge bit by bit over
time and,

541
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,810
and you can be wrong about it too.

542
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,063
But,
um,

543
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,260
so,
so the old idea was,

544
00:29:16,261 --> 00:29:19,410
you know,
well first of all that you were very

545
00:29:19,411 --> 00:29:22,110
much conscious of the environment
period,

546
00:29:22,111 --> 00:29:24,840
which you're not.
And then the second idea was,

547
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,020
well,
while you're being conscious of the

548
00:29:28,021 --> 00:29:30,390
environment,
if anything changes radically,

549
00:29:30,391 --> 00:29:32,790
you will definitely focus your attention
on it.

550
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,380
And then,
and what turned out to be the case is,

551
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,760
well,
you're not very conscious of the

552
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:42,730
environment and radical things can
happen and you won't notice them unless

553
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:46,780
they interfere with what you're doing.
So something that emerges that

554
00:29:46,781 --> 00:29:49,360
interferes with what you're doing that
you don't expect,

555
00:29:49,361 --> 00:29:52,210
you will instantly orient towards and
concentrate on.

556
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,830
So it isn't a normally or novelty that
attracts your attention.

557
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:01,840
It's the unexpected disruption of the
relationship between your behaviors and

558
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:05,740
the desired outcome of those behaviors.
And that's a much narrower claim.

559
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:08,770
Only pay attention to things that make
you fail.

560
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:13,330
It's something like that,
or at least additionally,

561
00:30:13,331 --> 00:30:15,280
pay attention to things that make you
fail.

562
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,140
And you know,
generally speaking,

563
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,410
that's also associated with an emotional
response.

564
00:30:20,411 --> 00:30:22,850
You know?
So if you're doing something and,

565
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,520
and you know,
you think you know how to do it,

566
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:27,160
and so you're doing it and then all of a
sudden something unexpected happens,

567
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:29,170
you're going to have an emotional
reaction.

568
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,890
And we'll talk more about the emotional
reactions in the next class.

569
00:30:32,891 --> 00:30:37,480
But the emotional reaction partly
prepares you for the worst in case this

570
00:30:37,481 --> 00:30:39,520
unexpected thing is bigger than you
think it is.

571
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:42,660
And sort of also primes you to be
curious and to start to explore,

572
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:47,590
to figure out what it is so that you can
reconstruct your expectations and

573
00:30:47,591 --> 00:30:50,200
desires in accordance with the
transforming world.

574
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:55,890
So
this slide is an elaboration in some

575
00:30:57,061 --> 00:31:00,690
sense of what I was telling you a little
bit earlier about the multiple levels of

576
00:31:00,691 --> 00:31:01,461
reality.
You know,

577
00:31:01,461 --> 00:31:04,050
so the idea is that the thing that you
see,

578
00:31:04,051 --> 00:31:06,480
which in this particular schema would be
the computer

579
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:13,460
is nested inside all of these systems or
has other systems nested inside of it.

580
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,320
And that's part of an indication of the
complexity of things.

581
00:31:16,321 --> 00:31:17,340
Now,
you know,

582
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,860
one of the things that you might think
about,

583
00:31:19,861 --> 00:31:21,810
for example,
if you're using your computer,

584
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,060
okay,

585
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,890
one of the things you might ask yourself
is like,

586
00:31:26,891 --> 00:31:30,520
why is your computer a black rectangle?
There are like a silver rectangle.

587
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:32,980
It's all smooth and shiny.
Why is that?

588
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,300
You know,
like it's not clear.

589
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,130
First it's not transparent.
Okay.

590
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:42,080
And,
and then it's got this smooth cover.

591
00:31:42,081 --> 00:31:44,870
And it wouldn't necessarily have to.
Why?

592
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:46,700
Why do you think that's appealing to
you?

593
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,390
Okay,
so it's familiar.

594
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:53,224
Yeah,
that,

595
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,850
that's good.
So it's familiar.

596
00:31:54,851 --> 00:31:56,560
What,
what else is,

597
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,780
it's simple.
Yeah.

598
00:31:58,781 --> 00:32:01,300
You don't want to,
you don't want to interact with the

599
00:32:01,301 --> 00:32:05,110
computer at all.
You want to attract with little pictures

600
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,650
on the screen and then you don't even
really want to interact with those.

601
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,190
You want to interact with some subset of
what that picture is doing on the

602
00:32:12,191 --> 00:32:14,140
screen.
And so you're very,

603
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,360
very rarely using the computer,
right?

604
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:19,930
You're just paying attention to,
well let's say the screen and the

605
00:32:19,931 --> 00:32:23,530
keyboard.
So the computer is whatever's underneath

606
00:32:23,531 --> 00:32:24,191
that.
And then what,

607
00:32:24,191 --> 00:32:27,280
what that is is a collection of parts
that are so bloody complicated that you

608
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:30,670
don't want to have anything to do with
them that are nested inside a whole

609
00:32:30,671 --> 00:32:33,640
network of things that are so complex.
You don't want to have anything to do

610
00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:34,474
with them.
And so,

611
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,990
so you know what happens when you're
using a computer is all of a sudden it

612
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:38,830
stops working.

613
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,470
Well then it's a computer.
As soon as it stops working,

614
00:32:42,471 --> 00:32:45,560
it's a computer.
Before that it was whatever it was you

615
00:32:45,561 --> 00:32:48,290
were doing.
And as soon as it turns into a computer,

616
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,840
what do you do with it?
Well,

617
00:32:51,841 --> 00:32:53,930
you know,
you stupidly hit the on and off button

618
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:57,500
and they'd be a plug it in and and you
know and out or something and maybe you

619
00:32:57,501 --> 00:33:02,501
checked your switches to make sure that
a fuse didn't burn out or a break or go

620
00:33:02,931 --> 00:33:07,190
and that's pretty much the end of you in
terms of your ability to deal with the

621
00:33:07,191 --> 00:33:08,600
actual entity,
you know,

622
00:33:08,601 --> 00:33:13,601
and then you curse with your primate
brain and then you send it out to be

623
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:17,530
fixed.
And so one of the things that's,

624
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:21,950
that's that's worth considering because
this will also help us understand what

625
00:33:21,951 --> 00:33:26,450
happens in terms of brain function as we
go along is that as long as things are

626
00:33:26,451 --> 00:33:29,060
going according to how you want them to
go,

627
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:32,000
you can really pretend that the world is
unbelievably simple.

628
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,110
All the world consists of is those few
things that you're doing in your little

629
00:33:36,111 --> 00:33:40,820
bounded perceptual frame and everything
else is zero.

630
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:46,490
And then unfortunately now and then the
hypothesis that everything else is zero

631
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:50,960
is radically wrong.
Like when your computer crashes and then

632
00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:54,800
you actually actually for awhile have to
deal with at least some of the

633
00:33:54,801 --> 00:33:58,520
complexity that's actually there.
And that's usually extremely anxiety

634
00:33:58,521 --> 00:34:00,200
provoking.
So you know,

635
00:34:00,201 --> 00:34:05,201
you can imagine in the same situation is
while you're in your nice smooth car and

636
00:34:05,331 --> 00:34:06,590
you're on the highway and all of a
sudden,

637
00:34:06,591 --> 00:34:08,540
you know,
you hear a horrible grinding noise and

638
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:12,020
smoke comes out of the back and you're,
you're off pulled over to the side.

639
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:16,550
Well,
what was merely a means of getting from

640
00:34:16,551 --> 00:34:18,980
point a to B and comfort like two
seconds ago,

641
00:34:18,981 --> 00:34:22,310
is now a collection of extremely
troublesome parts,

642
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,390
none of which you know anything about.
Plus it's disrupted your day,

643
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:30,500
plus it's disrupted your pocket book.
Plus you have to now deal with a bunch

644
00:34:30,501 --> 00:34:33,620
of people who are going to tell you
what's wrong with your vehicle and maybe

645
00:34:33,621 --> 00:34:38,621
fix it for some completely unknown
amount of money and with dubious

646
00:34:39,051 --> 00:34:40,730
utility.
And so poof,

647
00:34:40,731 --> 00:34:42,920
the car turns into that.
And so it's,

648
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:49,640
it's almost impossible to overestimate
the degree to which we live within a

649
00:34:49,641 --> 00:34:54,641
world that's bounded by our expectations
and desires and how much time we spend

650
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:02,120
keeping everything that's complex away
from us so that we don't have to deal

651
00:35:02,121 --> 00:35:02,661
with it.
Okay,

652
00:35:02,661 --> 00:35:05,480
so now we might want to think about how
we do that.

653
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:10,310
I'm going to show you,
this is the little Schema that might be

654
00:35:10,311 --> 00:35:12,200
helpful.
So like

655
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:20,730
I made this little diagram of dots
because I wanted to make an ambiguous

656
00:35:20,731 --> 00:35:23,850
figure.
So I'm hoping that when you look at that

657
00:35:23,851 --> 00:35:26,910
figure,
what do you see when you look at it?

658
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,410
The center and what?
What?

659
00:35:34,411 --> 00:35:38,420
What shape is the center
across?

660
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:39,490
Okay,
so you can see across.

661
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,550
What else can you see?
It's a rectangle.

662
00:35:43,551 --> 00:35:44,121
Yeah.
What else?

663
00:35:44,121 --> 00:35:45,300
Can you see?
What square?

664
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,820
It's four squares.
Yeah,

665
00:35:46,821 --> 00:35:48,620
exactly.
So what else can you see?

666
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,950
That's a good one.
I haven't seen that one.

667
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,640
I'll take your word for it though.
What else can you see?

668
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:06,290
I'll show you some of the things you can
see.

669
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,200
Okay.
Yeah.

670
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:08,940
You see that,
right?

671
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,790
You see that?
See that?

672
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:21,870
You could see that.
You could see that.

673
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:26,450
Okay.
So the first thing that you might know

674
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,860
is that
the thing in the beginning,

675
00:36:29,861 --> 00:36:33,820
the thing in itself,
let's say you can see milk multiple

676
00:36:33,821 --> 00:36:35,980
ways.
It's not exactly that.

677
00:36:35,981 --> 00:36:38,890
You have an opinion about what it is,
you know,

678
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,170
it's the,
you can actually see those different

679
00:36:41,171 --> 00:36:44,440
things.
You can see it manifesting those

680
00:36:44,441 --> 00:36:47,170
different perceptual objects.
And that,

681
00:36:47,171 --> 00:36:50,740
that's a strange thing because you know
how people always think that arguments

682
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:54,520
are about opinions.
There's some facts and you have one set

683
00:36:54,521 --> 00:36:56,380
of opinions about them and you have
another,

684
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:59,080
and then you argue about the opinions
till you get to the facts.

685
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,750
Unfortunately,
it's a lot worse than that because the

686
00:37:01,751 --> 00:37:06,751
facts themselves are often reasonably
subject to debate.

687
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,210
So you,
so you might ask for example,

688
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:15,040
which of the five ways that you could
see that initial thing is the right way

689
00:37:15,041 --> 00:37:15,874
to see it.

690
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:20,380
And the answer to that,
and this is a pragmatic answer,

691
00:37:20,381 --> 00:37:22,690
is it depends on what you want to do
with your perception.

692
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:24,910
You know?
So if you want to,

693
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:30,490
if you wanted the highest resolution
that captures as much detail as

694
00:37:30,491 --> 00:37:32,890
possible,
then you want something as close to the

695
00:37:32,891 --> 00:37:35,830
thing in itself as possible.
So that'd probably be object fives

696
00:37:35,831 --> 00:37:37,210
there.
You know,

697
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:40,570
if you want to know the rough area,
let's say that's a map of an orchard,

698
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,440
you might think about object one.
If it's an orchard from the top right

699
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:46,420
and you want it to walk from north to
south,

700
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:50,380
you might want to think about it in
terms of object three you know,

701
00:37:50,381 --> 00:37:53,260
and so those are different ways you can
perceive that object.

702
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,650
And then I would say that what happens
at the next level of abstraction,

703
00:37:56,651 --> 00:37:59,320
and that's where you've got the numbers
and words down here,

704
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:02,980
is that you have the thing in itself
which is complex and can be seen many

705
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:03,670
ways.

706
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:06,670
Then you have the things you see which
are partial,

707
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:10,270
sort of low resolution representations
of the thing itself.

708
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:15,630
And then there are words which are at
least in part references to the image of

709
00:38:15,911 --> 00:38:18,430
the thing.
And so by the time you get to the word,

710
00:38:18,431 --> 00:38:22,270
it's pretty compressed.
And I really liked the metaphor of

711
00:38:22,271 --> 00:38:23,320
compression,
you know,

712
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,400
so cause a lot of the things you see are
sort of like thumbnails and why our

713
00:38:27,401 --> 00:38:29,800
thumbnails useful.
You guys have done some,

714
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,290
you know,
image processing.

715
00:38:32,291 --> 00:38:37,291
Say like obviously a thumbnail lacks
some things that a 16 megabyte is that

716
00:38:39,221 --> 00:38:40,870
about right now?
How big are cameras?

717
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,050
16 megabytes for a single photo.

718
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,163
What's that?

719
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:49,530
Yeah,
well I think the new cameras are up.

720
00:38:49,531 --> 00:38:51,480
I think they're up to 16 the newest
iteration.

721
00:38:51,481 --> 00:38:51,841
So,
okay.

722
00:38:51,841 --> 00:38:55,710
So why have thumbnail if you have a 16
megabyte picture?

723
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:57,823
Okay,

724
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,330
okay.
But why not use the picture,

725
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:04,520
right?
That's exactly it is that there's a

726
00:39:04,521 --> 00:39:09,521
trade off between detailed
representation and time utilization time

727
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:12,540
and resource utilization.
And you know like,

728
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:15,470
like a computer,
you guys have limited time and resources

729
00:39:15,471 --> 00:39:18,680
and so you don't actually want to see
any more than you need to see in order

730
00:39:18,681 --> 00:39:21,410
to get what you're supposed to get done
done.

731
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,480
Because otherwise it's just a waste of
energy.

732
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,960
And so what that means is that your
brain is always trying to figure out in

733
00:39:26,961 --> 00:39:31,961
some sense what's the simplest way I can
represent this so that I can undertake

734
00:39:32,181 --> 00:39:34,190
whatever it is that I'm planning to
undertake next.

735
00:39:34,191 --> 00:39:35,270
And that sort of,
again,

736
00:39:35,271 --> 00:39:38,150
from a philosophical perspective,
that's actually something pragmatic.

737
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,070
Okay.
So then you might ask yourself,

738
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,540
you organize your perceptions in
relationship to your goals,

739
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,800
and then you might ask yourself,
well,

740
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:47,180
where do those goals come from?

741
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:50,390
And when we've,
we've heard from thinkers like say Freud

742
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:55,850
who talked about the ied functions in
the Ed is sort of the seat of primordial

743
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:56,900
impulses,
right?

744
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,810
And so you might,
it might think about the Ed as the

745
00:39:59,811 --> 00:40:03,800
producer of primary goals or drives and
for,

746
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:07,550
I did think about them as drive.
So they were things that led to,

747
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:11,510
you know,
a relatively rigid behavioral algorithm

748
00:40:11,511 --> 00:40:14,570
once the,
the state had arisen.

749
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,730
Now,
as I mentioned before,

750
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:21,440
I think that that's a flawed viewpoint
because the motivational state is more

751
00:40:21,441 --> 00:40:25,810
than merely a drive because the drive is
something that say triggers a

752
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:30,080
preprogrammed sequence of behaviors.
And a lot of the early behaviorists

753
00:40:30,081 --> 00:40:31,900
thought about animal behavior in that
weight,

754
00:40:31,901 --> 00:40:33,320
right?
They'd say the animal encounter a

755
00:40:33,321 --> 00:40:37,730
stimulus and the stimulus would produce
a response and then the responses would

756
00:40:37,731 --> 00:40:40,490
get chained together.
And then when the animal look

757
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:44,510
encountered the stimulus again,
then just those change responses would

758
00:40:44,511 --> 00:40:45,620
automatically run.

759
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,690
And one of the famous experiments that
showed that that was wrong was a rat was

760
00:40:50,691 --> 00:40:53,390
trained to run through a maze.
You could sort of train your out pretty

761
00:40:53,391 --> 00:40:56,510
quickly if you know you,
you put them in the maze and there's

762
00:40:56,511 --> 00:40:59,840
like he can go this way or this way and
you put some cheese over here,

763
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,570
you do that three or four times the rat
learns to turn right.

764
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:05,210
And then you add another piece to the
maze and you know,

765
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:08,180
then the rattlers to turn left.
And so you can get it turning,

766
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:10,640
you know,
extremely in an extremely complicated

767
00:41:10,641 --> 00:41:14,540
way to walk through the maze.
But then what they did was they took a

768
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:17,690
rat and they wrapped up its hind legs,
you know,

769
00:41:17,691 --> 00:41:19,910
like with tape.
So it couldn't use them.

770
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:24,470
And then they put its little rear end on
a cart and then they had the little rat

771
00:41:24,471 --> 00:41:26,630
scoot through the maze on the cart.

772
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:30,140
And it's obvious that a scooting route
and a running route don't use the same

773
00:41:30,141 --> 00:41:31,880
motor output,
not even close.

774
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,720
And the rat could still get the maze.
So the idea that all the route had done

775
00:41:35,721 --> 00:41:39,200
was chained together,
learned automatic responses,

776
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:42,230
turned out to be wrong.
Rats,

777
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:45,890
it's more like rats learn what's going
on and can generalize from it just like

778
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:48,030
you do so.
So anyway,

779
00:41:48,031 --> 00:41:50,750
so,
so the notion that the drive just

780
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:55,190
instantiates a sequence of preprogrammed
behaviors in most cases,

781
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,010
in many cases,
especially with complex behavior,

782
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,100
it turns out to be wrong.
There's some limited circumstances under

783
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,380
which it's right.
Okay.

784
00:42:03,381 --> 00:42:08,381
So the first hypothesis we're going to
entertain is the idea that you have to

785
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:10,400
frame the world in order to interact
with it.

786
00:42:10,401 --> 00:42:13,370
And this is sort of a little
mythological diagram that I whipped up a

787
00:42:13,371 --> 00:42:16,520
long time ago.
And the bottom thing that's a neuro

788
00:42:16,521 --> 00:42:17,331
bruce,
by the way,

789
00:42:17,331 --> 00:42:19,220
which is a dragon that eats its own
tail.

790
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:24,140
It's an ancient symbol of chaos and
chaos is what you see when you don't

791
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:27,890
know what you're looking at.
And so you could say in some sense chaos

792
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:30,740
is all the complexity that surrounds you

793
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,533
that

794
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:36,460
could possibly intrude on your little
safe world.

795
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:37,923
And then

796
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,370
to grasp that k also to operate within
it,

797
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,120
you have to put it within a framework.
And so that's the great father there.

798
00:42:45,121 --> 00:42:49,140
That's actually God you see in God's got
the sun behind him because God is like

799
00:42:49,141 --> 00:42:50,960
the sun,
he's you know,

800
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:54,870
reliable and he's associated with
consciousness and then he sorta ruling

801
00:42:54,871 --> 00:42:57,870
over this city.
And so for me that was a good symbol of

802
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,260
culture and put in part culture is
what's outside of you.

803
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:05,790
But in part culture is also the
frameworks that you've learned to use by

804
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,910
being with other people.
The frameworks that you've learned to

805
00:43:08,911 --> 00:43:13,911
use to narrow and specify the world.
And in my motive thinking that framing

806
00:43:15,811 --> 00:43:19,590
is a associated with security on the one
hand because it tells you what you can

807
00:43:19,591 --> 00:43:21,960
do and you know it makes things safe for
you.

808
00:43:21,961 --> 00:43:24,930
And tyranny on the other hand,
cause it can get out of control and you

809
00:43:24,931 --> 00:43:26,550
know,
you can start to get too rigid,

810
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:30,360
whatever,
regardless of the pros and cons of

811
00:43:30,361 --> 00:43:31,194
framing.

812
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:35,640
If you see something one way,
then you can't see it another,

813
00:43:35,641 --> 00:43:39,000
it's harder to see it another.
So that's the corn side of framing the

814
00:43:39,001 --> 00:43:42,270
pros side of framing is while it then
you get to do something.

815
00:43:42,271 --> 00:43:45,360
If it's unframed you're in chaos,
it's existential anxiety,

816
00:43:45,361 --> 00:43:47,910
you're not going to move ahead at all.
So you have to frame things,

817
00:43:47,911 --> 00:43:51,330
you have to simplify them.
And really in some sense you even have

818
00:43:51,331 --> 00:43:55,140
to oversimplify them.
Depends on what you mean by that.

819
00:43:55,141 --> 00:43:58,710
But what you're really trying to do is
to never make your perceptual task any

820
00:43:58,711 --> 00:44:02,100
more complex than that has to be in
order to get done what you need to get

821
00:44:02,101 --> 00:44:05,010
done.
So how do you frame things?

822
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:08,130
Well,
the first thing we should point out is

823
00:44:08,131 --> 00:44:10,860
that a lot of framing,
it doesn't even happen psychologically,

824
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:13,500
right?
So here you are sitting in this

825
00:44:13,501 --> 00:44:17,580
classroom and you're not overwhelmed by
chaos.

826
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:19,890
Well why?
Well,

827
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:22,530
first of all,
you're in a city that's helpful.

828
00:44:22,650 --> 00:44:25,800
There's electricity here and there's
natural gas and there's people to fix

829
00:44:25,801 --> 00:44:28,620
all the plumbing.
And so the fact that you're in a city

830
00:44:28,621 --> 00:44:30,660
makes life much simpler.
Right off the bat.

831
00:44:30,661 --> 00:44:33,990
There's nothing trying to eat you.
You don't have to contend with the fact

832
00:44:33,991 --> 00:44:35,850
that it's like minus 20 for three
months.

833
00:44:35,851 --> 00:44:38,070
And you know,
so that's a whole bunch of complexity

834
00:44:38,071 --> 00:44:41,550
that the were,
the civilized world is just taken care

835
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:44,160
of for you.
And then,

836
00:44:44,161 --> 00:44:46,170
you know,
now you're in the university in the city

837
00:44:46,171 --> 00:44:48,240
and that eliminates a whole bunch of
other hassles.

838
00:44:48,241 --> 00:44:50,220
You know,
there's some things you have to do,

839
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,190
but there's a bunch of things you don't
have to do and then you're inside this

840
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,170
building and wow,
look at that.

841
00:44:55,171 --> 00:44:56,700
There's electric light here and you
know,

842
00:44:56,701 --> 00:44:59,820
and the chairs work and there's not
going to be an earthquake.

843
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:02,010
And probably the whole building isn't
going to fall down.

844
00:45:02,011 --> 00:45:04,680
So you know,
by the time you sitting in your chair

845
00:45:04,681 --> 00:45:09,120
here also with your clothing on,
you've screened a lot of complexity out

846
00:45:09,121 --> 00:45:11,340
already.
And so you can sit there fairly calmly.

847
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:14,790
And so that's all external.
Now part of the reason,

848
00:45:14,791 --> 00:45:16,230
and this is this is where thinking
about,

849
00:45:16,231 --> 00:45:19,710
because this isn't only psychological,
you guys will hear a fair bit about

850
00:45:19,711 --> 00:45:23,070
terror management theories as you
progress through your education.

851
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:28,071
And so Karen Management theories are
theories that attempt to account for why

852
00:45:28,231 --> 00:45:30,330
people are,
uh,

853
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:33,810
say patriotic in their beliefs,
why they adopt belief systems.

854
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:38,760
And the idea is that a belief system
protects you from death anxiety.

855
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,490
And so Freud's are sorta said that about
religious systems.

856
00:45:41,491 --> 00:45:44,700
That was his critique of religion.
People are afraid of death.

857
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,910
And so they have this infant title
desire to have that fear go away.

858
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:49,770
So they turned to religion and religion
says,

859
00:45:49,771 --> 00:45:50,910
well,
death isn't permanent.

860
00:45:50,911 --> 00:45:54,780
And that's why people are religious.
And the extension of that is,

861
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:56,820
well,
that's also why they have belief systems

862
00:45:56,821 --> 00:45:58,680
in general.
They're trying to protect themselves

863
00:45:58,681 --> 00:46:02,430
against this deep shaking anxiety.
And to some degree,

864
00:46:02,431 --> 00:46:06,300
I suspect that's true.
But you should also remember that when

865
00:46:06,301 --> 00:46:10,020
you're protecting your culture,
say if you identify with it,

866
00:46:10,021 --> 00:46:12,930
you're patriotic or whatever it is,
or you think that your culture is worth

867
00:46:12,931 --> 00:46:15,180
defending.
You're not just defending something

868
00:46:15,181 --> 00:46:18,540
psychological.
It's like the culture,

869
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:21,660
the function,
the key functioning culture keeps the

870
00:46:21,661 --> 00:46:23,400
lights on,
you know,

871
00:46:23,401 --> 00:46:25,740
so it doesn't just protect you from
death anxiety.

872
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,150
It also protects you from death.
And that's even more important most of

873
00:46:30,151 --> 00:46:32,220
the time than being protected from death
anxiety.

874
00:46:32,221 --> 00:46:34,290
Now there's a psychological component to
it too,

875
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:38,880
but you don't ever want to underestimate
just the practical utility of being

876
00:46:38,881 --> 00:46:39,870
nested inside.

877
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:43,290
You know what piaget would consider a
relatively functional game.

878
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:45,840
It's like your words a lot simpler,
you know,

879
00:46:45,841 --> 00:46:47,640
you have to work to maintain it and
everything,

880
00:46:47,641 --> 00:46:50,550
and that's kind of a drag.
Maybe that's the tyrannical element of

881
00:46:50,551 --> 00:46:51,390
it,
but you know,

882
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,250
the payoff's pretty big.
Okay?

883
00:46:53,251 --> 00:46:57,480
So if you look at medieval cities,
this is a well preserved medieval city

884
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,490
in France.
There's a lot of medieval cities that

885
00:46:59,491 --> 00:47:02,460
still exist in Europe.
And you see this is a typical sort of

886
00:47:02,461 --> 00:47:06,420
human habitation.
It's like inside there's order and

887
00:47:06,421 --> 00:47:10,230
outside there's chaos and barbarians and
then there's a couple of walls to keep

888
00:47:10,231 --> 00:47:13,110
the chaos and the barbarians out.
And then inside,

889
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:14,700
you know,
there's a dominance hierarchy and

890
00:47:14,701 --> 00:47:18,960
everybody can live their relatively
productive and relatively peaceful

891
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,460
lives.
Inside of that,

892
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,210
it's all framing,
getting rid of complexity,

893
00:47:24,211 --> 00:47:28,350
unnecessary complexity.
Same thing with houses.

894
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:29,740
They do the same for you.

895
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:33,160
And then social institutions do the same
thing too.

896
00:47:33,161 --> 00:47:33,994
It's like,
okay,

897
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:34,930
this is,
uh,

898
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:38,260
is it Kennedy there and,
and Obama?

899
00:47:38,261 --> 00:47:41,800
I think so this is part of the
transition in power from George Bush to

900
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,330
Obama.
And you know,

901
00:47:43,331 --> 00:47:46,840
that's a pretty scary thing to have.
You're the leader of your dominance

902
00:47:46,841 --> 00:47:49,900
hierarchy replaced by another leader and
you know,

903
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:54,520
among chimpanzees for example,
that's often the occasion for a fair bit

904
00:47:54,521 --> 00:47:58,450
of mayhem.
And it's also the case often for people

905
00:47:58,451 --> 00:47:59,470
that that's,
you know,

906
00:47:59,471 --> 00:48:02,800
that that occurs and you know,
we still have that in the form of

907
00:48:02,801 --> 00:48:05,590
political corruption and so on.
But all things considered,

908
00:48:05,770 --> 00:48:08,380
you know,
the power transition from Obama or from

909
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:12,100
Bush to Obama was far more peaceful than
such.

910
00:48:12,101 --> 00:48:15,970
Power transitions generally are if you
look across the history of mankind.

911
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,320
And so that means you're also protected
by your social institutions.

912
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:23,260
They screen out a lot of potential
complexity as well,

913
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,990
as long as they're functional.
And,

914
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:29,530
and also I think as long as they follow
some of the Piaget and rules.

915
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:33,490
And so one of the PSG in rules for a,
for a playable game is there's some

916
00:48:33,491 --> 00:48:34,960
reciprocity.
You know,

917
00:48:34,961 --> 00:48:39,961
you regard the system roughly speaking
as either fair or fairer than any other

918
00:48:42,371 --> 00:48:44,120
system you can think up.
You know,

919
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,540
it boils down to the same thing because
if it's not fair,

920
00:48:46,541 --> 00:48:48,340
but you can't come up with a better
fantasy,

921
00:48:48,341 --> 00:48:51,790
well it's as good as it can be.
So,

922
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:55,510
so the,
the sociological or sociopolitical

923
00:48:55,511 --> 00:48:59,230
structures that keep complexity away
from us can only operate under a certain

924
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,550
limited number of constraints.
But still they perform their function,

925
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,191
you know,
and,

926
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:05,630
and very admirably.
It's,

927
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:08,980
it's amazing I think,
because I see people in my clinical

928
00:49:08,981 --> 00:49:10,220
practice all the time,
you know,

929
00:49:10,221 --> 00:49:13,990
and most people that I see,
and I think this is true of most people

930
00:49:13,991 --> 00:49:18,190
in the world have at least one serious
problem,

931
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:20,530
you know,
and it might be they have an illness

932
00:49:20,531 --> 00:49:21,850
that's just god awful.

933
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:26,200
Or if or if they don't have an illness,
one of their immediate family has an

934
00:49:26,201 --> 00:49:27,820
illness that's god awful.
Or they're,

935
00:49:27,821 --> 00:49:29,090
you know,
they're really old and they're,

936
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:32,800
and they need to be taken care of or
they're suffering from some insane

937
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:36,220
economic problem or they've just been
unemployed or whatever.

938
00:49:36,221 --> 00:49:36,671
You know,
there's,

939
00:49:36,671 --> 00:49:40,000
there's something in the,
their immediate circle that's really,

940
00:49:40,001 --> 00:49:43,870
really difficult to grapple with.
And yet people still go out and maintain

941
00:49:43,871 --> 00:49:47,320
their place in the world and the whole
thing roughly works.

942
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:51,970
And to me that's just a con continual
source of amazement that people can pull

943
00:49:51,971 --> 00:49:52,870
that off,
you know?

944
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,740
So anyway,
so a lot of the screening that you do to

945
00:49:56,741 --> 00:50:01,420
get rid of that complexity is external
and part of that is a consequence of

946
00:50:01,421 --> 00:50:02,560
good,
well functioning,

947
00:50:02,561 --> 00:50:04,030
sociological,
um,

948
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:08,350
organization.
Then the next thing that sorta screens

949
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,180
things out for you is your body.

950
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:11,800
Right now,
look,

951
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,670
you kind of naturally see things at a
particular level of resolution,

952
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:18,460
right?
There's no obvious reason why that

953
00:50:18,461 --> 00:50:20,680
should be.
So you know,

954
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,620
you see the front of people,
you can't see the back of them.

955
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:27,010
You see their external covering,
their skin in their clothes,

956
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:29,570
can't see inside them.
When you look closely at them,

957
00:50:29,571 --> 00:50:32,450
you can't see their cellular structure
or their molecular structure,

958
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,140
their atomic structure.
You can't really see the social

959
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,740
situations that they're embedded in.
So if I look at you,

960
00:50:39,741 --> 00:50:41,560
I can't see your family,
I,

961
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:42,950
you know,
I presume you have one.

962
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:47,240
I can't really see the political
situation that surrounds you either.

963
00:50:47,241 --> 00:50:50,960
I have to know that abstractly.
And then the ecological level is almost

964
00:50:50,961 --> 00:50:55,961
completely imperceptible to me.
And so part of the way that complexity

965
00:50:56,031 --> 00:50:59,720
is screened out is that your body just
doesn't allow you to pick a lot of it

966
00:50:59,721 --> 00:51:00,530
up.

967
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:05,390
You're just blind to it.
So you see at one level of resolution,

968
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:09,020
and that's the human level.
You see things of approximately our

969
00:51:09,021 --> 00:51:11,300
size.
You see things that are approximately

970
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:14,180
the size that we can grip.
Those are sort of the things that you're

971
00:51:14,181 --> 00:51:18,680
likely to come to think of as objects.
Like clearly a mountain isn't exactly an

972
00:51:18,681 --> 00:51:20,150
object,
you know,

973
00:51:20,151 --> 00:51:25,151
so usability is part of what defines
perceptibility.

974
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:30,310
And so that also screens things out.
And so then you're left with while what

975
00:51:32,781 --> 00:51:36,620
it is that you have to deal with once
everything's been screened out.

976
00:51:36,621 --> 00:51:37,640
And then you might ask,
well,

977
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:40,280
there's still a lot of complexity left
there.

978
00:51:40,281 --> 00:51:42,350
Like they say,
there's plenty of complexity within the

979
00:51:42,351 --> 00:51:46,850
average family and there's plenty of
complexity in the mating domain,

980
00:51:46,851 --> 00:51:49,100
you know,
to find a partner and to establish a

981
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,460
reasonable longterm relationship and to
have children and to raise them.

982
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:57,670
There's plenty of complexity left.
And then the question is how did

983
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,310
biology,
how did biology come to solve those

984
00:52:01,311 --> 00:52:03,810
problems?
Given that there are almost infinite and

985
00:52:03,811 --> 00:52:05,780
complexity,
how can you do it?

986
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,900
And the answer to that is fundamentally
a Darwinian answer.

987
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,470
You start simple.
And so that's back in the days of the

988
00:52:12,471 --> 00:52:15,320
one celled organisms,
we have no idea how those things got

989
00:52:15,321 --> 00:52:16,131
their start.
Right.

990
00:52:16,131 --> 00:52:18,980
I mean,
the actual beginning of life is a

991
00:52:18,981 --> 00:52:21,290
serious mystery.
And I'll tell you,

992
00:52:21,291 --> 00:52:24,230
it's such a serious mystery.
This is completely unbelievable.

993
00:52:24,231 --> 00:52:26,630
But one of the people who discovered
DNA,

994
00:52:26,631 --> 00:52:28,520
I think it was Francis Crick,
in fact,

995
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:32,270
I'm virtually certain it was,
he actually believed that DNA came from

996
00:52:32,271 --> 00:52:35,090
an alien civilization.
He wrote a whole book about that.

997
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,870
It's called Panspermia.
And so he believes that believed

998
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:43,820
posited,
that it's possible for DNA to drift

999
00:52:43,821 --> 00:52:48,821
through space for millions of years and
to land on planets and to start living.

1000
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,930
And that to God only knows how old DNA
is because he just couldn't figure out

1001
00:52:53,931 --> 00:52:55,730
at all how it could have possibly
evolved.

1002
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:59,060
So scientists are a lot weirder than you
think.

1003
00:52:59,061 --> 00:53:02,030
When you start to read,
you know about what the scientists who

1004
00:53:02,031 --> 00:53:04,250
discovered things really thought they're
completely,

1005
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,330
you know,
out of their mind.

1006
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:10,010
But whatever,
we'll assume that DNA got there somehow.

1007
00:53:10,011 --> 00:53:13,400
And then evolution took over after that.
And so what does evolution do?

1008
00:53:13,401 --> 00:53:15,500
It basically says,
well,

1009
00:53:15,501 --> 00:53:20,300
here is a terribly complex problem that
we've sort of partially solved and

1010
00:53:20,301 --> 00:53:23,900
partially solved means we've lived long
enough to produce another copy of

1011
00:53:23,901 --> 00:53:27,000
ourselves that constitutes the solution.
That's it.

1012
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:33,120
So we've lived lived long enough so that
we could conceivably duplicate

1013
00:53:33,121 --> 00:53:34,320
ourselves.
How should we do that?

1014
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:36,180
Well,
a variety of different ways.

1015
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,370
That's the answer.
We should produce variance.

1016
00:53:38,371 --> 00:53:42,270
So that might be multiple offspring or
it might be,

1017
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:47,010
it might also be facilitated by random
mutation.

1018
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,170
Hypothetically,
the mutations are random,

1019
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,350
although there's increasing evidence,
by the way,

1020
00:53:52,351 --> 00:53:57,351
that organisms are much more complex at
the genetic level than anyone ever

1021
00:53:57,781 --> 00:53:59,490
assumed.
And bacteria,

1022
00:53:59,491 --> 00:54:01,860
for example,
swap DNA back and forth with other

1023
00:54:01,861 --> 00:54:05,970
bacteria all the time.
And there are experiences that you can

1024
00:54:05,971 --> 00:54:09,750
have that will change your genetic
structure sufficiently so that you will

1025
00:54:09,751 --> 00:54:13,610
transmit that to your children.
So you know the idea that everything's

1026
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:17,220
purely Darwinian and it's only mutation
that drives randomness,

1027
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:22,490
that's clearly likely,
but not not complete.

1028
00:54:23,010 --> 00:54:25,080
These other mechanisms are clearly
there,

1029
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:25,960
but the,
the,

1030
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,840
the issue is,
is that what you do is you,

1031
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:31,320
you start with something that kind of
works and then you produce micro

1032
00:54:31,321 --> 00:54:36,090
variants of it and then the world around
you changes a little bit and hopefully

1033
00:54:36,091 --> 00:54:40,020
one of those micro variants manages to
do the same thing and then it produces a

1034
00:54:40,021 --> 00:54:43,840
bunch of micro variants and then they
managed to do the same thing.

1035
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:47,640
And so what's happening is there's an
arms race between the environment which

1036
00:54:47,641 --> 00:54:51,420
is always changing and the organisms
that are trying to keep up with it in

1037
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:54,060
that arms race just goes on forever.
And you know,

1038
00:54:54,061 --> 00:54:56,220
different life forms proliferate as
that.

1039
00:54:56,850 --> 00:54:59,700
As that occurs,
it's sort of like life is always playing

1040
00:54:59,701 --> 00:55:03,990
catch up and you never get it right.
You cannot get it right.

1041
00:55:03,991 --> 00:55:08,991
The best you can do is get it right long
enough to live long enough to reproduce.

1042
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:13,080
That constitutes the sum total of your
knowledge.

1043
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:16,170
So,
and so what that means,

1044
00:55:16,171 --> 00:55:18,060
at least in part,
is that you guys are all the

1045
00:55:18,061 --> 00:55:19,500
beneficiary,
let's say,

1046
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:24,180
of a evolutionary process that's
basically been going on since the

1047
00:55:24,181 --> 00:55:27,240
beginning of life.
And that's about 3.5 billion years ago.

1048
00:55:27,241 --> 00:55:31,860
And so your body,
your psychophysiology has been in an

1049
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:35,370
arms race with the transforming
environment for three and a half billion

1050
00:55:35,371 --> 00:55:40,371
years trying to keep up and poof,
you're the stellar consequence of three

1051
00:55:40,471 --> 00:55:44,400
and a half billion years of like effort
and death.

1052
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,200
So,
you know,

1053
00:55:46,201 --> 00:55:49,370
you might thank the cosmos about that.
You think about this,

1054
00:55:49,371 --> 00:55:54,371
say every single one of your female
ancestors successfully reproduced like

1055
00:55:55,411 --> 00:55:57,870
it's mind boggling.
It's mind boggling.

1056
00:55:57,871 --> 00:55:59,850
You're so unlikely that you would be
here,

1057
00:55:59,851 --> 00:56:00,900
that,
that it's,

1058
00:56:00,901 --> 00:56:05,670
that it's almost incalculable.
So good for us.

1059
00:56:05,671 --> 00:56:06,510
Here we are.
You know,

1060
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:09,540
how successful can you get?
So my,

1061
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:12,720
my point is that part of the way that
complexity is dealt with is,

1062
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:16,020
is haphazard.
It isn't ever really dealt with.

1063
00:56:16,021 --> 00:56:21,021
That's why you die.
You can only manage it to a limited

1064
00:56:21,301 --> 00:56:22,260
degree.
And for us,

1065
00:56:22,261 --> 00:56:25,210
that's like three kids in a hundred
years.

1066
00:56:25,211 --> 00:56:26,710
If you're lucky.
And that's,

1067
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:29,830
that's hard knowledge after three and a
half billion years.

1068
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:31,900
So the complexity problem is a rough
one.

1069
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,930
Okay,
so that's your body.

1070
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,610
Now let's look inside your body.
Now you might think that,

1071
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,320
you know,
we have this sort of idea that's kind of

1072
00:56:41,321 --> 00:56:45,520
a leftover car Tz and that there's a you
and there's a your body and the you is

1073
00:56:45,521 --> 00:56:48,670
in your brain.
And so just out of curiosity,

1074
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:53,980
how many of you have the subjective
sense that the EU is in your head?

1075
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:55,630
Okay.

1076
00:56:55,630 --> 00:56:58,090
How many of you would locate you?
Like for me,

1077
00:56:58,091 --> 00:57:00,520
I like,
I can locate me somewhere seems to be

1078
00:57:00,521 --> 00:57:02,920
about there.
I feel like that's where I am.

1079
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:08,260
And so how many of people think have
like the center of their sense of

1080
00:57:08,261 --> 00:57:10,900
subjectivity in their head?
How many people are like that?

1081
00:57:11,710 --> 00:57:14,710
Okay.
How many people are different than that?

1082
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:17,150
Okay,
so all good.

1083
00:57:17,151 --> 00:57:19,250
Okay.
So where like where do you feel the

1084
00:57:19,251 --> 00:57:21,380
center of your subjectivity?
Where would it be?

1085
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:26,083
That's hard.

1086
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:32,920
Oh,
I was thinking more about how?

1087
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:34,780
About how it feels fair.
Fair enough.

1088
00:57:34,781 --> 00:57:36,880
Fair enough.
You know that that's a perfectly

1089
00:57:36,881 --> 00:57:38,560
reasonable,
I'm thinking of it more as a subjective

1090
00:57:38,561 --> 00:57:39,460
experience though.

1091
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,113
Okay.

1092
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:46,200
And so you're kind of located here.
Yeah.

1093
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,510
How many people would,
would agree with that?

1094
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:50,041
Oh yeah.
So quite,

1095
00:57:50,041 --> 00:57:50,970
quite a few of you.
Wait,

1096
00:57:51,090 --> 00:57:52,710
so that's the same.
Same for you.

1097
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,800
More like here?
Yeah.

1098
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:56,150
Oh hmm.
Hmm.

1099
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:58,290
Hmm.
Any other places?

1100
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:03,950
Any other places you can talk about?
Yeah.

1101
00:58:04,201 --> 00:58:05,034
Yeah,
yeah.

1102
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:09,960
Sorry.
Any other places?

1103
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:15,570
Oh,
that's not good.

1104
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,120
That's fine.
No,

1105
00:58:18,121 --> 00:58:19,080
I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

1106
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:20,700
I'm kidding.
Okay.

1107
00:58:20,701 --> 00:58:21,271
Okay.
So,

1108
00:58:21,271 --> 00:58:23,220
okay.
So we kind of gone hand in heart and you

1109
00:58:23,221 --> 00:58:24,900
know,
that's really kind of historically

1110
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:27,240
standard.
The Greeks seem to look have located

1111
00:58:27,241 --> 00:58:29,250
themselves sort of in their heart,
you know,

1112
00:58:29,251 --> 00:58:33,000
and there's some theory that as people
became more intellectualized that that

1113
00:58:33,001 --> 00:58:36,870
feeling sort of went up to their head
and maybe before the heart there was the

1114
00:58:36,871 --> 00:58:37,830
stomach,
you know,

1115
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,840
and you know,
you might think that you're your stomach

1116
00:58:39,841 --> 00:58:41,490
if you are hungry all the time.
Right.

1117
00:58:41,491 --> 00:58:42,870
I mean,
you're just not ever hungry.

1118
00:58:42,871 --> 00:58:44,580
So like,
why the hell would you think you or your

1119
00:58:44,581 --> 00:58:46,050
stomach?
But you know,

1120
00:58:46,051 --> 00:58:49,320
that's another way that culture sort of
keeps complexity at bay.

1121
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:51,010
You don't even,
that's,

1122
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:55,050
that's almost like a motivational state
that modern people don't even have to

1123
00:58:55,051 --> 00:58:57,450
contend with because you're never really
hungry.

1124
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:59,430
I mean,
how many of you have gone without food

1125
00:58:59,431 --> 00:59:02,840
for more than 24 hours?
Oh,

1126
00:59:02,850 --> 00:59:05,330
that's pretty good.
How many of you in voluntarily went

1127
00:59:05,331 --> 00:59:07,970
without food for more than 24 hours?
Oh yeah.

1128
00:59:07,971 --> 00:59:09,200
Well that's,
that's rough.

1129
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:10,700
Okay.
How about a week?

1130
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:12,053
Okay.

1131
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:14,170
Nobody,
how about three days?

1132
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:17,451
Okay.
Well,

1133
00:59:17,451 --> 00:59:19,490
so you know,
there's a couple of people who've gone

1134
00:59:19,491 --> 00:59:23,410
for reasonable periods of time eating,
but fundamentally you can tell we can,

1135
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:26,450
we kind of got that problem under
control so you don't have to worry too

1136
00:59:26,451 --> 00:59:29,120
much about your,
about you being your stomach.

1137
00:59:29,121 --> 00:59:31,340
But I'll tell you if you were starving
at some point,

1138
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:34,550
that's probably where you'd locate
yourself.

1139
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:36,290
Okay.
So now you're inside the body.

1140
00:59:36,291 --> 00:59:38,840
And so let's take a look at how the body
works inside.

1141
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:41,570
So you kind of feel that you're in your
brain,

1142
00:59:41,571 --> 00:59:43,340
most of you anyways,
but,

1143
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:45,380
and you know,
you kind of think your brain is in your

1144
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:47,360
head.
But really that's not right.

1145
00:59:47,361 --> 00:59:52,361
I don't really understand ever why we
kind of decided that our brains were in

1146
00:59:52,431 --> 00:59:53,300
our head because,
well,

1147
00:59:53,301 --> 00:59:54,111
look at it,
there's,

1148
00:59:54,111 --> 00:59:56,990
there's the nervous system.
It's like it's not in your hand.

1149
00:59:56,990 --> 00:59:58,970
It's distributed through your whole
body.

1150
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:02,900
There's a lot of it up in your head.
But there's the whole spinal cord that's

1151
01:00:02,901 --> 01:00:05,450
an important thing.
And then it has all these branching

1152
01:00:05,451 --> 01:00:08,360
nerves that allow you to move your hands
and to feel things.

1153
01:00:08,361 --> 01:00:11,030
And it's like your nervous system is
distributed all the way through your

1154
01:00:11,031 --> 01:00:14,120
body.
So it's not reasonable to think about

1155
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:18,230
the way that you operate as you see
things with your brain.

1156
01:00:18,231 --> 01:00:19,820
And then you do things.
Now,

1157
01:00:19,821 --> 01:00:22,910
if that's sort of true,
but there's important ways that it's not

1158
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:25,610
true at all.
And it's important to know the ways that

1159
01:00:25,611 --> 01:00:28,190
it's not true.
It helps you understand phenomena that

1160
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:30,830
you couldn't otherwise understand.
So I can give you an example.

1161
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:35,300
There are people who experience
blindness.

1162
01:00:35,301 --> 01:00:36,830
So,
but it isn't because their eyes get

1163
01:00:36,831 --> 01:00:38,630
damaged just because they have brain
damage.

1164
01:00:38,631 --> 01:00:40,940
And so it damages the visual cortex.

1165
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:44,000
And so that's the higher order,
higher order part of the brain that's

1166
01:00:44,001 --> 01:00:46,610
responsible for conscious vision.
Okay.

1167
01:00:46,611 --> 01:00:48,070
So maybe they get,
I dunno,

1168
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:50,180
they get a tumor,
they get hit in the head or they get

1169
01:00:50,181 --> 01:00:52,370
shocked or something and then Poof,
they're blind.

1170
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,890
And so then,
um,

1171
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,440
they tell you they can't see anything
and then you say to them,

1172
01:00:57,441 --> 01:00:58,700
okay,
well that's fine.

1173
01:00:58,701 --> 01:01:00,890
You can't see anything but let's play a
game.

1174
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,260
Okay,
I'm going to hold up my left hand or my

1175
01:01:03,261 --> 01:01:07,190
right hand and you're going to guess
about which I'm holding up.

1176
01:01:07,191 --> 01:01:11,000
And so you do this and they go,
right and you do this and they go left,

1177
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:13,250
left,
left,

1178
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,050
right,
right.

1179
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,960
And they're right and you tell them
you're right.

1180
01:01:17,961 --> 01:01:18,531
And they say,
well,

1181
01:01:18,531 --> 01:01:21,620
I can't because I don't see anything.
So that's one,

1182
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:22,970
that's blind sight.
Okay.

1183
01:01:22,971 --> 01:01:24,410
So here's another kind of blind sight.

1184
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:29,150
So you take the same person and you set
them in front of the screen and you say,

1185
01:01:29,151 --> 01:01:30,080
well,
look at the screen.

1186
01:01:30,081 --> 01:01:32,690
And they tell you,
I told you already I can't see anything.

1187
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:35,720
And then you flash faces at them and
you,

1188
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,180
you,
you check for changes in the

1189
01:01:38,181 --> 01:01:41,630
conductivity of their skin.
Because when people react emotionally,

1190
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:44,660
they sweat a little more,
a little less than that changes how

1191
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:48,500
electricity passes through their skin.
So you show them a smiling face and

1192
01:01:48,501 --> 01:01:50,240
there's not much of a change.
And you know,

1193
01:01:50,241 --> 01:01:53,900
you show them a neutral face and there's
not much of a change.

1194
01:01:53,901 --> 01:01:57,650
And then you showed them like a really
aggressive or really afraid face and

1195
01:01:57,651 --> 01:02:00,980
poof spikes.
And you do that at a number of times and

1196
01:02:00,981 --> 01:02:03,170
you show them well.
And as soon as I show you a face of

1197
01:02:03,171 --> 01:02:06,080
someone who's afraid or face of someone
who's angry,

1198
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:07,110
you react to it.

1199
01:02:07,110 --> 01:02:09,140
Psychophysiological you think,
well,

1200
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:14,120
how the hell can that happen if they
can't see an answer that is,

1201
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:18,710
you don't just see with your vision you
see with your body.

1202
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,000
And so one of the things that you'll
find,

1203
01:02:21,001 --> 01:02:24,180
for example if you go through Swanson's
paper,

1204
01:02:24,181 --> 01:02:25,560
I'll read you a little bit about this
later,

1205
01:02:25,561 --> 01:02:30,561
is that most of your senses map onto
multiple levels of your nervous system.

1206
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:33,120
So some of them knocked right onto your
spine.

1207
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,850
And that's good because now and then
your,

1208
01:02:35,851 --> 01:02:40,680
I should tell your spine to do something
before you think cause is too slow.

1209
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:41,911
And so,
you know,

1210
01:02:41,911 --> 01:02:45,000
you've got to understand like way back
when we were frogs,

1211
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:47,340
roughly speaking,
we had eyes,

1212
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:51,120
we didn't have much of a brain.
So like what the hell were the eyes

1213
01:02:51,121 --> 01:02:55,470
doing that it's not like the frog
exactly sees and you might think,

1214
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:59,100
well how could eyes inform you about the
world if you don't?

1215
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:01,700
Exactly see.
And then you got to kind of think of it

1216
01:03:01,701 --> 01:03:03,360
didn't appear as Yeti incense.
It's like

1217
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:06,330
here,
here's an example.

1218
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:11,360
It might take an animal like a sponge,
pretty simple animal and it can open and

1219
01:03:12,361 --> 01:03:17,220
close pours on the outside of its
surface according to different changes

1220
01:03:17,221 --> 01:03:22,221
in the ocean that surrounds it.
And so it's perception is sort of like

1221
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,580
the ocean has three states,
whatever those might be.

1222
01:03:26,581 --> 01:03:29,220
Maybe it has 10 I don't know.
But for the sake of simplicity,

1223
01:03:29,221 --> 01:03:32,430
we'll say three.
The ocean manifest itself in three

1224
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:37,050
pattern states in pattern state one I do
this in pattern state too.

1225
01:03:37,051 --> 01:03:41,550
I do this in pattern state three I do
this and so it's direct pattern onto

1226
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:45,030
action mapping.
And so animals can use their eyes just

1227
01:03:45,031 --> 01:03:48,240
to react with.
You don't have to see the thing,

1228
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:50,310
you know,
cause you think you see and then you

1229
01:03:50,311 --> 01:03:50,670
act.

1230
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:53,520
But why do that?
You can just react and you know this

1231
01:03:53,521 --> 01:03:57,690
already because in a simple way,
if you put your hand on a hot stove,

1232
01:03:57,691 --> 01:04:00,630
you'll go like this and then you'll feel
the pain.

1233
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:05,310
And what that means is that your body
has conserved the relationship between

1234
01:04:05,311 --> 01:04:09,840
your sensory neurons and your motor
neurons out of spinal level so that you

1235
01:04:09,841 --> 01:04:13,560
will,
your perception of the heat is this.

1236
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:19,490
It's not of the heat,
it's just mapping a bodily pattern onto

1237
01:04:19,561 --> 01:04:24,561
a sensory pattern.
And so a lot of really primitive sensory

1238
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:28,530
input is exactly that.
It's just the sense detects a pattern.

1239
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:31,710
And with no intermediary of
interpretation,

1240
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:34,560
that pattern is translated into a
behavioral output.

1241
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:38,670
And so there's actually generally the
first,

1242
01:04:38,671 --> 01:04:40,710
the simplest cells or sensory motor
cells.

1243
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:43,710
So they do both.
They map the pattern and they react and

1244
01:04:43,711 --> 01:04:48,330
then the sensory and the motor cells
differentiate and then neuro tissue

1245
01:04:48,331 --> 01:04:49,290
grows inside them.

1246
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:53,820
And so then what happens is that instead
of an outside pattern being mapped

1247
01:04:53,821 --> 01:04:57,780
immediately onto a behavioral pattern,
the neuro intermediary says,

1248
01:04:58,170 --> 01:05:00,840
okay,
this pattern could mean that any of

1249
01:05:00,841 --> 01:05:05,160
these three things,
and then that neural layer grows and

1250
01:05:05,161 --> 01:05:07,260
grows and grows until being creatures
like us,

1251
01:05:07,261 --> 01:05:10,260
it's like a whopping layer.
And so we see a pattern and we go,

1252
01:05:10,261 --> 01:05:11,190
that could be this,
this,

1253
01:05:11,191 --> 01:05:11,731
this,
this,

1254
01:05:11,731 --> 01:05:12,271
this,
this,

1255
01:05:12,271 --> 01:05:13,104
this,
this.

1256
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:16,320
And then all of those things could be
mapped on to this or this or this or

1257
01:05:16,321 --> 01:05:17,154
this or this.
So,

1258
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:18,970
you know,
it makes us more slower,

1259
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:21,850
but more flexible and slow can be a
problem.

1260
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:24,430
So like when you're walking down a
pathway and a snake appears,

1261
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:27,520
you don't want to be thinking snake,
rubber hose,

1262
01:05:27,521 --> 01:05:29,080
stick,
whatever,

1263
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:30,700
you know,
because then you're dead because the

1264
01:05:30,701 --> 01:05:33,190
snake bites you.
What you want to do is catch the snake

1265
01:05:33,191 --> 01:05:36,640
out of the corner of your eye and jump
up into the air before you even know

1266
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:37,720
that you saw a snake.

1267
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:41,800
And you can do that because your eyes
can map right onto your spine and they

1268
01:05:41,801 --> 01:05:44,950
don't just map right onto your spine.
They map onto your nervous system and

1269
01:05:44,951 --> 01:05:46,690
all sorts of levels.
So for example,

1270
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:51,340
with the blind sight person who's
looking at the face,

1271
01:05:51,490 --> 01:05:54,820
so it's an angry face,
the eyes are still mapping information

1272
01:05:54,821 --> 01:05:57,520
onto the Amygdala.
And so the Amygdala changes the

1273
01:05:57,521 --> 01:05:59,170
psychophysiology,
you know,

1274
01:05:59,171 --> 01:06:03,670
it says prepare for threat.
And so the person might feel uneasy,

1275
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:05,230
but that's a,
it's weird,

1276
01:06:05,231 --> 01:06:09,460
but that's a form of site to feel uneasy
can be a form of site.

1277
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:14,620
So,
and that,

1278
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:17,560
that's to say even more clearly that
your brain just isn't in your head.

1279
01:06:17,561 --> 01:06:20,230
It's like it's all the way up.
It's all the way from,

1280
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:22,750
and this is a nice psg Eddie of
viewpoint because you know,

1281
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:26,230
in some sense what Piaget says about
children is they sort of organize

1282
01:06:26,231 --> 01:06:28,810
themselves from the spinal level
upwards.

1283
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:30,940
You know,
they learn these little sub routines.

1284
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,850
First of all,
they have a few sub routines.

1285
01:06:32,851 --> 01:06:36,670
So is it like built right into the spine
and then they start playing with those

1286
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:39,670
and chaining them together in flexible
ways and they keep doing that,

1287
01:06:40,060 --> 01:06:42,520
you know,
in more and more complex ways until

1288
01:06:42,521 --> 01:06:45,730
they're capable of the abstract
representation of thought.

1289
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:48,820
And you can see how this will work as we
go through the,

1290
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:52,870
the nervous system.
So your brains in your body,

1291
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:56,830
in fact there's some evidence and there
there's more than one kind of nervous

1292
01:06:56,831 --> 01:06:57,521
system too,
right?

1293
01:06:57,521 --> 01:07:01,870
There's the central nervous system that
allows you to move voluntarily and that

1294
01:07:02,110 --> 01:07:04,600
you know,
provides you with sensory feedback,

1295
01:07:04,601 --> 01:07:07,480
some of which you're conscious of it.
There's also the autonomic nervous

1296
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:10,420
system that runs your,
all the complex machinery that you're

1297
01:07:10,421 --> 01:07:12,490
too stupid to attend to,
you know,

1298
01:07:12,491 --> 01:07:15,310
cause your consciousness gets little
jobs.

1299
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:17,800
It doesn't get to run your liver,
for example.

1300
01:07:17,801 --> 01:07:20,620
You imagine what your life would be like
if you were in charge of your liver.

1301
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:24,010
It's like you'd have been dead years ago
cause what do you know about livers?

1302
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:27,550
So you have a whole system like the
autonomic nervous system,

1303
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:31,450
which has more neurons than the central
nervous system that just runs all that

1304
01:07:31,451 --> 01:07:33,130
stuff for you,
which is,

1305
01:07:33,131 --> 01:07:34,690
you know,
a good thing you do and then you don't

1306
01:07:34,691 --> 01:07:36,650
have to pay attention to it.
So,

1307
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:41,470
so anyways,
there's a lot of distribution of neural

1308
01:07:41,471 --> 01:07:44,440
tissue throughout your body.
And there's even some evidence that you

1309
01:07:44,441 --> 01:07:49,441
have a like a second brain of sorts in
your solar plexus where you know,

1310
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:52,540
that's perhaps part of the reason why
you really don't like to get hit there.

1311
01:07:52,541 --> 01:07:55,510
But there's a tremendous number of
serotonergic neurons,

1312
01:07:55,511 --> 01:07:56,470
for example,
in your,

1313
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:59,410
in your midsection.
And there's increasing evidence that

1314
01:07:59,411 --> 01:08:02,140
those are associated with things like
emotion and mood.

1315
01:08:02,141 --> 01:08:06,310
And so the idea that the brain is here,
it's like,

1316
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:08,350
mm,
no,

1317
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:09,880
not,
not really.

1318
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:11,320
It's,
it's a continuum.

1319
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:14,380
You know,
your body is a psychophysiological

1320
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:17,960
entity.
And to separate it into body and mind is

1321
01:08:17,961 --> 01:08:20,030
like,
it's not right.

1322
01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:25,400
The other thing that seems to be
increasingly clear among the say the

1323
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:28,220
robotics guys is you can't even be smart
unless you have a body.

1324
01:08:28,670 --> 01:08:33,670
And so that's why the advanced advanced
intelligence guys are building robots

1325
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:36,980
from the bottom up.
They're doing it just like piaget would

1326
01:08:36,981 --> 01:08:38,060
have suggested.
It's like,

1327
01:08:38,061 --> 01:08:41,570
well build some things that can move and
then chain those things that can move

1328
01:08:41,571 --> 01:08:44,780
together so that they can move in more
complex ways and then chain them

1329
01:08:44,781 --> 01:08:46,850
together so they can work in more
complex ways.

1330
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:49,580
And once you've got this thing that can
do things,

1331
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:53,510
then stick a brain on it and that'll,
then it'll have things that can do with

1332
01:08:53,511 --> 01:08:55,460
its brain.
And if you don't do it that way,

1333
01:08:55,461 --> 01:08:58,580
you get something that can't function
intelligently.

1334
01:08:58,850 --> 01:09:01,170
It's close to that.
So,

1335
01:09:02,530 --> 01:09:07,530
so there is the brain and the major one
way of dividing it into its major

1336
01:09:08,151 --> 01:09:10,010
subcomponents is represented.

1337
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:11,450
There's a variety of ways you can do
this.

1338
01:09:11,451 --> 01:09:13,730
You can divide it into hemispheres
because it's sort of split down the

1339
01:09:13,731 --> 01:09:16,190
middle.
The right hemisphere seems to be kind of

1340
01:09:16,191 --> 01:09:20,120
specialized for the processing of
unknown information.

1341
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:25,040
And the left seems to be more
comfortable working where you know

1342
01:09:25,041 --> 01:09:29,300
what's going to happen and that the left
is most generally the linguistic part of

1343
01:09:29,301 --> 01:09:30,500
the brain,
although not always,

1344
01:09:30,501 --> 01:09:31,580
it's,
it's a rough,

1345
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:33,260
you know,
what would you call it?

1346
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:37,520
It's a rough truth.
There's lots of exceptions.

1347
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:41,870
The linguistic system tends to
specialize in the left and the left

1348
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:44,870
sorta insists that it knows what's going
on.

1349
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:48,590
And the right is always looking out for
things that don't fit and sort of

1350
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:52,910
convincing the left slowly and sort of
under the table to change its

1351
01:09:52,911 --> 01:09:54,080
viewpoints.
And that seemed,

1352
01:09:54,081 --> 01:09:56,360
a lot of that seems to happen when
you're asleep and you're dreaming.

1353
01:09:56,810 --> 01:09:58,940
So the right,
maybe what's happening when you're

1354
01:09:58,941 --> 01:10:02,630
dreaming is that during the day your
cognitive processes are pretty tight and

1355
01:10:02,631 --> 01:10:07,100
defined and they better be right because
you don't want to be dreaming your

1356
01:10:07,101 --> 01:10:09,770
schizophrenia dreams in the daytime.
That's a bad idea.

1357
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:14,690
So you gotta stay kind of focused and
narrow in a way during the day.

1358
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:19,040
But the problem with that narrowed,
narrow focus is that you're not paying

1359
01:10:19,041 --> 01:10:21,980
attention to a lot of things.
And so it kind of looks like your right

1360
01:10:21,981 --> 01:10:25,370
hemisphere keeps track of the
potentially important things that you're

1361
01:10:25,371 --> 01:10:29,540
not keeping track of and sort of,
and then at night you're,

1362
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:32,450
you're category system sort of broadens
and loosens.

1363
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:34,490
You can tell that in dreams because
they're so weird.

1364
01:10:34,491 --> 01:10:38,360
And that's maybe when the right
hemisphere is sort of tapping some new

1365
01:10:38,361 --> 01:10:42,620
information into the left and playing
without how it might be recategorized

1366
01:10:42,621 --> 01:10:45,650
without completely overwhelming the left
because

1367
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:49,820
you don't want to,
just because you learn something new,

1368
01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:51,710
it doesn't mean you want to upset
yourself.

1369
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:52,461
Totally.
Right.

1370
01:10:52,461 --> 01:10:56,450
So it's a real,
it's a real complex dynamic between

1371
01:10:56,451 --> 01:10:58,850
stability and learning.
And it's conceivable.

1372
01:10:58,851 --> 01:11:02,090
That's why you have two hemispheres.
So who knows?

1373
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:05,360
It's good theory though.
[inaudible] the guy who came up with it

1374
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:07,130
fundamentally,
his name is Goldberg,

1375
01:11:07,610 --> 01:11:09,610
um,
Alconan Goldberg,

1376
01:11:09,611 --> 01:11:13,070
and he was a student of Alexander Luria
who was a great neuropsychologist.

1377
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:13,921
So,
you know,

1378
01:11:13,921 --> 01:11:15,300
it's a credible,
it's credible idea.

1379
01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:20,390
So here's some rough divisions.
You've got your cerebellum,

1380
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:24,330
that Cerebellum,
we don't know what the hell that thing

1381
01:11:24,331 --> 01:11:26,010
does.
If you don't have one,

1382
01:11:26,011 --> 01:11:28,770
you get all wobbly,
but there's more neurons in the

1383
01:11:28,771 --> 01:11:31,110
cerebellum and then there are in the
rest of the brain.

1384
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:34,230
So like is it just making you not
wobbly?

1385
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:39,060
It seems like a tremendous
devotion of resources to something

1386
01:11:39,061 --> 01:11:41,370
that's relatively simple.
So,

1387
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:42,811
uh,
alcohol,

1388
01:11:42,811 --> 01:11:45,270
when you're a new drinker,
alcohol's really hard than the

1389
01:11:45,271 --> 01:11:46,590
Cerebellum,
which is why you're,

1390
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,710
you know,
totally useless in a motorway and you

1391
01:11:49,711 --> 01:11:51,240
fall down and all those things happened.

1392
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:55,890
But so that's the cerebellum and we
don't know what it does even though it's

1393
01:11:55,891 --> 01:11:58,350
very complex.
Lee Branch did kind of looks like a

1394
01:11:58,351 --> 01:12:00,510
cauliflower and it's just packed full of
neurons.

1395
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:04,770
And then there's the occipital lobe and
that kind of use that to see with more

1396
01:12:04,771 --> 01:12:07,170
or less.
And then the prior lobe kind of keeps,

1397
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:11,640
helps keep track of who,
who you are from a bodily perspective

1398
01:12:11,641 --> 01:12:15,870
and sort of where your body's located in
space and sort of who you are as an

1399
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:17,490
embodied person.
So,

1400
01:12:17,491 --> 01:12:19,620
for example,
if you lose the right parietal lobe

1401
01:12:19,621 --> 01:12:22,140
because you have a stroke,
then you lose the left side of your

1402
01:12:22,141 --> 01:12:25,650
body.
And even more weirdly you lose the left

1403
01:12:25,651 --> 01:12:28,530
side of everything.
So all of a sudden you can't see the

1404
01:12:28,531 --> 01:12:31,950
left side of it anything and no one can
figure out what that's like.

1405
01:12:31,951 --> 01:12:36,951
Because say I'm looking at this room and
I have this pridal damage.

1406
01:12:37,410 --> 01:12:40,110
If I'm looking at the room,
do I not see the left side of the room?

1407
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:43,110
And then if I look at you,
all of a sudden I don't see your left

1408
01:12:43,111 --> 01:12:44,730
side.
Like we can't figure that out.

1409
01:12:46,010 --> 01:12:49,380
Like the left is gone.
But then the left is relative to where

1410
01:12:49,381 --> 01:12:51,960
you happened to be looking.
And I think one of the ways of

1411
01:12:51,961 --> 01:12:55,410
understanding it is sort of like,
you know how you clearly can't see

1412
01:12:55,411 --> 01:12:59,820
anything behind your head and it's not
black where you can't see,

1413
01:12:59,821 --> 01:13:01,410
right.
It's black if you close your eyes.

1414
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:06,360
But there's a difference between what
you can't see behind your head and the

1415
01:13:06,361 --> 01:13:09,540
black you see when you close your eyes.
Cause the block sort of seems like

1416
01:13:09,541 --> 01:13:12,030
nothing,
but compared to what's behind your head,

1417
01:13:12,031 --> 01:13:13,800
it's,
it's not nothing at all.

1418
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:16,140
So I think what happens with people who
have neglect,

1419
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:20,070
periodontal damages that,
that like back park just goes like this.

1420
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:25,200
And so instead of you seeing this much
of the world and this being just not

1421
01:13:25,201 --> 01:13:27,090
there at all,
as far as vision is concerned,

1422
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:31,020
it goes like this.
And so then you've only got like a

1423
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:33,240
quarter of the world that you're,
and so people like that,

1424
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,520
sometimes they'll throw their own legs
out of bed,

1425
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:37,950
they wake up and they think,
oh my God,

1426
01:13:37,951 --> 01:13:40,320
because they can kind of detect the left
but not very well.

1427
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,330
And they're quite freaked out because
you know,

1428
01:13:42,331 --> 01:13:44,490
like do you really want to wake up with
a laying in bed with,

1429
01:13:44,491 --> 01:13:46,800
you know,
so they grab it and throw it out and

1430
01:13:46,801 --> 01:13:48,720
that's not so good because they're
attached to it.

1431
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:52,800
Or so they'll eat,
they'll eat and they only eat half the

1432
01:13:52,801 --> 01:13:54,800
food on their plate.
But if you turn the plate didn't delete

1433
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:57,360
half of the half that's left.
So anyways,

1434
01:13:57,390 --> 01:14:02,390
that's the prior little temporal lobe
that enables you to here roughly

1435
01:14:03,661 --> 01:14:06,390
speaking,
there's a lot of memory there too.

1436
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:08,250
And the frontal lobe,
well,

1437
01:14:08,251 --> 01:14:10,620
first of all,
the frontal lobe seems to allow you to

1438
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:15,740
make voluntary movements sort of at the,
at the highest level of abstraction.

1439
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:20,110
And then the prefrontal Cortex,
which would be right at the front of the

1440
01:14:20,111 --> 01:14:23,520
yellow there.
It's sort of like the back part of the,

1441
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:26,740
of the frontal lobe enables you to make
voluntary movements,

1442
01:14:26,741 --> 01:14:31,630
but the prefrontal cortex enables you to
represent the potential motor movements

1443
01:14:31,631 --> 01:14:34,000
that you might make before you implement
them.

1444
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:37,750
And so any evolved out of the motor
strip during the course of evolution,

1445
01:14:37,751 --> 01:14:39,460
it's sort of like,
well first you learn how to act

1446
01:14:39,461 --> 01:14:41,590
voluntarily.
And then as that grew,

1447
01:14:41,591 --> 01:14:43,690
and it's particularly big in human
beings,

1448
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:47,890
that part was able to divorce actions
from your body,

1449
01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:53,800
represent them in an abstract space,
run the MS simulations,

1450
01:14:53,801 --> 01:14:56,950
calculate the outcome,
and then implement them or not.

1451
01:14:57,010 --> 01:14:57,611
And you know,
it's a,

1452
01:14:57,611 --> 01:15:00,130
it's a,
it's a hit and miss business because

1453
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:05,460
lots of you people undoubtedly simulate
catastrophic outcomes and then go do

1454
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:07,710
whatever it gives you were going to do
anyways.

1455
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:08,390
Like,
you know,

1456
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:11,560
that happens to people all the time,
say when they're trying to stop drinking

1457
01:15:11,561 --> 01:15:14,350
or to stop using cocaine or not to be in
jeet or,

1458
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:18,860
so you know,
your prefrontal Cortex can whip up these

1459
01:15:18,861 --> 01:15:21,760
simulations,
but other parts of your body can

1460
01:15:21,761 --> 01:15:23,800
override them quite,
quite badly.

1461
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:26,350
So that's sort of roughly the brain at
least from,

1462
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:30,250
you know,
looking at it from the side and then

1463
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:35,730
this is it split down the middle and you
can see that it's not precisely two

1464
01:15:36,791 --> 01:15:41,050
hemispheres all the way down
in the middle.

1465
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:45,790
It's one thing and then it grows.
These two things like little hat and uh,

1466
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:49,900
as far as I'm concerned,
all the important parts of the brain are

1467
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:53,050
low down,
central,

1468
01:15:53,110 --> 01:15:54,610
old,
you know,

1469
01:15:54,611 --> 01:15:56,650
because people like to think that,
well,

1470
01:15:56,651 --> 01:15:58,180
if they're doing evolved a long time
ago,

1471
01:15:58,181 --> 01:15:59,014
it's primitive.

1472
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:00,813
It's like,
no,

1473
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:05,950
if it evolved a long time ago,
it's been around a long time.

1474
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:09,310
It's really smart.
That's why you don't run your liver.

1475
01:16:09,970 --> 01:16:13,150
The autonomic nervous system runs it
because it's been around for an awful

1476
01:16:13,151 --> 01:16:15,250
long time and it knows exactly how to do
it.

1477
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:18,190
And so it's really,
in some sense the new parts of the

1478
01:16:18,191 --> 01:16:21,880
brains are the brain in many ways are
the parts that are primitive.

1479
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:26,290
So in the old parts are extremely
necessary and sophisticated.

1480
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:29,620
And so the areas we're going to
concentrate on most,

1481
01:16:29,621 --> 01:16:32,590
particularly our or the Cortex,
we've already talked about,

1482
01:16:32,950 --> 01:16:35,140
the cortex is probably responsible.

1483
01:16:37,150 --> 01:16:40,030
People like to think of it as
responsible for consciousness and there

1484
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,680
there's something about that that's
right.

1485
01:16:41,710 --> 01:16:46,710
But it's quite clear that human beings
can remain conscious even if they have a

1486
01:16:48,641 --> 01:16:51,250
substantial amount of damage to the
cerebral cortex.

1487
01:16:51,251 --> 01:16:55,720
So consciousness is a really weird thing
where we're not very good at figuring

1488
01:16:55,721 --> 01:16:59,890
out where it's localized at all
cerebral cortex,

1489
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:03,790
Thalamus,
the Thalamus is the place where all your

1490
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:06,490
sensory information comes together.
So you know,

1491
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,980
when you look at the world,
it's kind of like a continuum.

1492
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:12,650
I've experienced despite the fact that
you have these five different sensory

1493
01:17:12,651 --> 01:17:17,651
inputs and the Thalamus seems to sort of
unite all that and then it sends the

1494
01:17:17,931 --> 01:17:22,340
messages that it amalgamates up to the
cortex and the cortex sends to the back

1495
01:17:22,341 --> 01:17:26,330
and the Thalamus sends them back.
And there's like this loop between the

1496
01:17:26,331 --> 01:17:27,830
fellows and the CORTEX.

1497
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:30,680
And maybe that's part of what
consciousness is,

1498
01:17:30,710 --> 01:17:33,020
you know,
rather than being localized in an area,

1499
01:17:33,530 --> 01:17:35,570
it could easily be a process.
And you know,

1500
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:38,690
the fact that consciousness sort of
turns on in the morning,

1501
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:41,990
which is a very weird thing,
seems to indicate to me that it,

1502
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:44,330
it's probably something like that.
It's a loop.

1503
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:47,510
It's the looping interaction between
brain areas and you know,

1504
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:50,960
if something's looping like that,
it gets really weird properties.

1505
01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:54,240
So that's a positive feedback system.
You know,

1506
01:17:54,650 --> 01:17:57,320
I don't know if you've ever turned a
vid,

1507
01:17:57,380 --> 01:18:01,100
hooked a video camera to a TV and then
turn the video camera on the TV.

1508
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:03,590
You know,
it starts doing extremely weird things.

1509
01:18:03,591 --> 01:18:08,510
You can get all sorts of unbelievably
complex designs and weird phenomena

1510
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:11,330
because the TV is recycling its own
signal.

1511
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:13,040
You know?
So there's this circuit in there that's

1512
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:18,041
looping and I suspect consciousness is
something like that of the hippocampus.

1513
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:24,280
The hippocampus is responsible for the
movement of short term information into

1514
01:18:24,411 --> 01:18:26,750
longterm storage.
It's a very important part of the brain.

1515
01:18:26,751 --> 01:18:30,770
We'll talk about that more next time.
The amygdala is responsible for a lot of

1516
01:18:30,771 --> 01:18:35,720
emotional responses,
and the hypothalamus is responsible for

1517
01:18:35,721 --> 01:18:38,360
a lot of primordial motivational states.

1518
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:46,500
And so we'll stop and we'll start with
the hypothalamus on Tuesday.

1519
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:48,730
See you soon.
