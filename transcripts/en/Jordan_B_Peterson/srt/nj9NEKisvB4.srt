00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,580
Hi Everybody,
I'm here today again with Gregg Hurwitz,

2
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,080
an old friend of mine,
a former student from Harvard.

3
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:30,081
Um,
we've talked before and we've got some 

4
00:00:30,081 --> 00:00:30,860
exciting things to talk about today.
I'll give you some background on Greg.

5
00:00:30,861 --> 00:00:35,861
First.
Greg is a New York Times number one 

6
00:00:35,861 --> 00:00:37,440
internationally bestselling author of 20
thrillers,

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,850
including out of the dark,
coming out in 2019 and two award winning

8
00:00:41,851 --> 00:00:46,851
thriller novels for Teens.
His novels have won numerous literary 

9
00:00:46,851 --> 00:00:46,900
words,
grace,

10
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,070
top 10 lists,
and have been published in 30 languages.

11
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,910
He's written screenplays for or sold 
spec scripts to many of the major 

12
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,900
studios,
including the book of Henry and written,

13
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:00,300
developed and produced TV for various 
networks.

14
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,990
He's also a New York Times best selling 
comic book writer,

15
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,880
having pen stories for marvel,
Wolverine and punisher and DC,

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,120
Batman and penguin.
He's published numerous academic 

17
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,121
articles on Shakespeare,
taught fiction writing and use English 

18
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:19,890
department and guest lectured for Ucla 
and for Harvard in the United States and

19
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:24,891
international.
And the course of researching his 

20
00:01:24,891 --> 00:01:28,251
thrillers,
he sneaked onto demolition ranges with 

21
00:01:28,251 --> 00:01:29,040
navy seals,
swam with sharks in the Galapagos,

22
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,700
and gone undercover into mind.
Controlled cults,

23
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:37,570
her which grew up in the bay area while 
completing an Mba from Harvard and a 

24
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,140
masters from Trinity called jocks in 
Shakespearean tragedy.

25
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,340
He wrote his first novel.
He was the undergraduate scholar athlete

26
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:49,341
of the year at Harvard for his pole 
vaulting exploits and played college 

27
00:01:49,341 --> 00:01:53,451
soccer in England where he was a fellow.
So that's greg.

28
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,530
Hello everybody.
It's quite an intro.

29
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:02,550
I think I'm just going to.
You follow me around everywhere that 

30
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,720
before I enter a room.
Dislikes me.

31
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,080
Yeah,
exactly.

32
00:02:05,081 --> 00:02:10,081
That's right.
That's the sort of intro that makes 

33
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:11,980
everyone hopes you're a real son of a 
bitch after reading an intro like that 

34
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,810
so they can make it morally dislike you 
the best thing.

35
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,410
Dislike Jordan,
as you know.

36
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

37
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,180
So we're not gonna talk too much today 
about Greg's previous exploits.

38
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,500
Instead we're going to talk about some 
of the work he's been doing in the 

39
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:27,720
political realm recently and the reasons
for doing that.

40
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:29,490
So Greg,
I'm going to let you take that away.

41
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,980
Well,
so

42
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,450
look,
I write thrillers and I have.

43
00:02:34,451 --> 00:02:39,451
The shorthand that I always give is that
about half of my friends were born 

44
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:39,451
again,
Christian navy seal,

45
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:43,591
snipers and half my friends are gay acw 
and I taught equally in the red and blue

46
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:45,720
states.
My readership is very,

47
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:50,721
very diverse and I think because of that
I have a real ear for the buzz words and

48
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:54,780
phrases and ideological shorthand that 
really shut people up.

49
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,530
Um,
that just make them stop listening.

50
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,120
My politics,
I'm,

51
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:05,130
I'd say I'm a bit more of a classical 
liberal and one of the things that I 

52
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:10,681
talk a lot about is there certain 
phrases that we've run up from both 

53
00:03:10,681 --> 00:03:13,771
sides that just make people completely 
stopped and it's not dissimilar to what 

54
00:03:13,771 --> 00:03:13,900
we're trying to do when we're writing.
Right?

55
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:17,260
If you write and use buzzwords and catch
phrases and cliches,

56
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,530
it's less interesting.
If you already know what you think of 40

57
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:23,920
start writing and there's no room for 
discovery along the way,

58
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:25,360
then you're not.
It's not real writing.

59
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:26,560
It's propaganda,
right?

60
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:31,561
It's an ramped.
You're never going to be surprised by 

61
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:32,500
something in the third act.
And so there's a real overlap for that.

62
00:03:32,501 --> 00:03:37,501
But I found,
and so one of the things that I've been 

63
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:39,601
trying to do a given how polarized I 
have found discourse to be and how I 

64
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:44,041
found myself moving between vastly 
different worlds is to try and commit 

65
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:47,560
myself to ending or contributing to 
ending polarizing discourse.

66
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,590
Uh,
and so part of that is that I've been 

67
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,811
focused on trying to rebrand the,
the Democratic Party of working with a 

68
00:03:54,811 --> 00:03:57,850
lot of different candidates and entities
in an effort to get away from,

69
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,340
from gridlocked and more towards 
solutions.

70
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:05,150
I have a view that's a lot like Jonathan
Heit who you've interviewed it lanes who

71
00:04:05,151 --> 00:04:10,151
I think is a great description of the 
need and necessity for both 

72
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:11,810
conservatives and liberals in that,
you know,

73
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,960
conservatives like walls around things,
right?

74
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:16,840
They're like walls around gender.
They like walls around countries.

75
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,960
Build a wall is sort of a brilliant 
republican slogan.

76
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,870
And the job of,
of liberals is to say,

77
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:25,630
hang on a minute,
if that wall is to impenetrable,

78
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,140
you're not going to have new ideas and 
people and then we'll stop me to die.

79
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,320
And so for me,
and you and I've talked before about how

80
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:37,321
it's also the case for inventors and 
entrepreneurs who kind of create things 

81
00:04:37,321 --> 00:04:38,560
which tends to be more of a liberal 
leaning,

82
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:43,561
but if you want them run effectively,
often you need conservative managers to 

83
00:04:43,561 --> 00:04:43,561
come in.

84
00:04:43,561 --> 00:04:47,350
And so I would want there to be stronger
parties on both sides.

85
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,240
I mean,
I want there to be better discourse.

86
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:51,460
I think if there's a stronger Republican
party,

87
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:56,461
it makes the Democratic Party have to 
raise their game and come up with 

88
00:04:56,461 --> 00:04:57,940
solutions.
And out of the one thing I will say that

89
00:04:57,941 --> 00:05:02,941
has been common and everyone who I 
talked to is nobody's thrilled with the 

90
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:05,290
level of political discourse right now.
So there's a couple of things there that

91
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:10,291
are really interesting.
I mean you talk about the necessity for 

92
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:14,080
a high quality representation on both 
sides of the political,

93
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,250
a political,
what do you call that continuum.

94
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,280
Let's say there are really powerful,
temperamental and philosophical reasons 

95
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:28,741
for that.
So now you mentioned that the liberal 

96
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:31,741
types tend to be entrepreneurs and 
creators and a conservative types tend 

97
00:05:31,741 --> 00:05:33,550
to be managers and administrators.
So that that's pretty well documented in

98
00:05:33,551 --> 00:05:36,630
the psychological literature,
but you see echoes of that and you,

99
00:05:36,631 --> 00:05:41,631
you mentioned the border issue as well 
because of course to categorize things 

100
00:05:41,631 --> 00:05:44,410
we have to put boundaries around them,
but boundaries can artificially separate

101
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,420
and make things stagnant as well.

102
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:51,420
So we have to have a continual 
discussion about exactly where the 

103
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,001
boundaries should be drawn without ever.
Also presuming that we should just do 

104
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:55,930
away with boundaries all together 
because that does away with category.

105
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,460
Then with regards to hierarchies,
well no know it seems to be the job of 

106
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:06,041
the right wing to put forward the 
proposition that hierarchies are 

107
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,060
necessary from an organizational 
perspective.

108
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:11,810
So if a bunch of people decided to go do
something of value,

109
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,230
let's say it's a collective value as 
well as individual value,

110
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:20,650
then inevitably when they operate 
cooperatively and competitively they're 

111
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,371
going to produce a hierarchy.
And the hierarchy is actually a tool to 

112
00:06:24,371 --> 00:06:26,270
accomplish that task in the social 
arena.

113
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:31,650
But the problem with that is that 
hierarchy can become overly rigid and 

114
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,040
corrupt,
and it can dispossessed people,

115
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,500
uh,
without,

116
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,800
without that dispossession being a 
necessary function of the task that the 

117
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,140
hierarchy's attempting to perform.

118
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,580
What's that?
It's always both,

119
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:47,270
right?
I mean,

120
00:06:47,271 --> 00:06:51,080
it's always that we needed to organize 
and there always are in equities.

121
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:54,770
The result of this,
the thing that I have found is that when

122
00:06:54,771 --> 00:06:58,160
people lock into political conversations
from one side or the other,

123
00:06:58,161 --> 00:07:00,230
it becomes all or nothing.
And for me,

124
00:07:00,231 --> 00:07:02,030
nothing gets accomplished in all or 
nothing.

125
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,640
And so a straw man,
you know,

126
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:09,641
Democrats,
that all of them just want to tear down 

127
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:12,101
the whole system and you know,
those are some of the louder voices on 

128
00:07:12,101 --> 00:07:15,581
twitter isn't helpful anymore than a 
claim that Republicans have no interest 

129
00:07:15,581 --> 00:07:16,980
whatsoever in the people who are just 
disaster.

130
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,610
And a lot of what's important is to look
at,

131
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,470
you know,
conservatives who are thoughtful.

132
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:27,110
It's not like they love the fact that 
people are dispossessed.

133
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:32,111
So the question becomes how do we all 
help that and how do we actually have a 

134
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:35,411
discussion and how do we,
how do we get away from the fact that 

135
00:07:35,411 --> 00:07:39,131
compromise toward solutions is somehow a
betrayal that if you compromise anything

136
00:07:40,191 --> 00:07:45,191
from the furthest extreme,
your sort of portraying your own 

137
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:45,191
ideology and your own people?

138
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:49,370
Yeah,
well I think partly you do that by 

139
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:49,680
focusing on specific problems instead of
provider radiological solutions.

140
00:07:49,681 --> 00:07:54,450
And that's so part of what we're trying 
to discuss today and to contribute to is

141
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,230
that they raise centralization,
let's say,

142
00:07:57,231 --> 00:08:02,231
of the political parties and also to 
make a case for the necessity of 

143
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:02,940
intelligent discourse.
Knowing that people on both sides of the

144
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,100
political spectrum have something 
intelligent to say.

145
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:10,670
So the conservatives have every reason 
to put forward the proposition that 

146
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:13,140
hierarchies are both inevitable and 
useful,

147
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,770
but also to keep firmly in mind that 
they can become corrupt and that they do

148
00:08:16,771 --> 00:08:21,771
tend to dispossess and the liberals have
every reason to keep in mind that 

149
00:08:21,771 --> 00:08:23,640
hierarchies are absolutely necessary in 
order to get things done,

150
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
but that the dispossessed need a voice 
so that the system remains both 

151
00:08:29,281 --> 00:08:34,281
permeable and fair and it's very 
necessary for both sides to have some 

152
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:36,210
respect for the position of the 
alternative.

153
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,430
The alternative,
temperamental type,

154
00:08:38,431 --> 00:08:38,970
let's say.

155
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,430
Well,
that's where we have to meet in,

156
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,430
in rational enlightenment discourse or 
else we can't win.

157
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,830
You know,
talked a lot about the big,

158
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,920
the big five personality traits and the 
ways that it orients differently in 

159
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,371
politics.
So it's like Liberals or higher and 

160
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:56,371
empathy,
right?

161
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:59,220
In higher and openness.
That's why a lot of artists do you find 

162
00:08:59,220 --> 00:08:59,220
are,
um,

163
00:08:59,220 --> 00:08:59,270
tend to be liberal,
you know,

164
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,820
at least the good ones.
Like we have bruce springsteen and on 

165
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,090
the other side it's hard for,
for,

166
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,680
for president trump to fill up an arena 
with people who,

167
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:12,860
who are the artists of a certain caliber
and you know,

168
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,960
it doesn't mean that that higher empathy
is better and I think often when 

169
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,201
liberals are talking,
they're trying to push through only 

170
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:24,440
apathy and higher empathy and they're 
trying to educate people in the higher 

171
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:24,440
epa well to fix psychological traits.

172
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,860
And the other thing is,
you know,

173
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:30,861
Republicans or conservatives tend to be 
high on conscientiousness and 

174
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,720
conscientiousness codes for a bunch of 
things that are really useful,

175
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,220
you know,
codes for better health,

176
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,400
better finances,
more stable marriages and longer 

177
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:40,560
lifespan.
So one of the things when I'm advising,

178
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,510
you know,
democrats is like,

179
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:47,511
you can't,
if you have to win an argument on the 

180
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:47,511
merits,
you have to make a better argument.

181
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:52,131
If you're losing people,
you can't just go to them and say be 

182
00:09:52,131 --> 00:09:52,131
more empathetic.
That's not an argument,

183
00:09:52,131 --> 00:09:56,840
right?
It's going to President Clinton and 

184
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:56,840
saying,
can't you just be an introvert?

185
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,820
These are sort of fixed traits.
And the other thing is is a lot of 

186
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,271
conservatives are doing fine over there 
where they're stable marriages and 

187
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:05,271
longer life.

188
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,900
Well in the empathy issue is interesting
as well because it's easy for that to be

189
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:12,280
regarded reflexively as a virtue,
but an excess of pity,

190
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:17,281
let's say can be destructive.
There's a whole psychoanalytic 

191
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:20,131
literature on the negative consequences 
of of fostering overdependence let's 

192
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:25,111
say,
and that's a real problem and there is 

193
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:25,420
our managerial literature too that 
suggests that less agreeable managers do

194
00:10:25,421 --> 00:10:29,290
better as well as less agreeable people 
in general having higher incomes because

195
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,970
they're better at arguing for 
themselves.

196
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:36,330
So it is really necessary to give some 
consideration to the fact that each of 

197
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:40,141
these temperaments has it marked 
advantages and disadvantages and a 

198
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:43,921
proper niche where it can function and 
and other places where it actually 

199
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:43,921
constitutes a problem.

200
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:49,280
Well,
that's where we have to rise above 

201
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:49,280
ourselves in me.
Like where did we meet?

202
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:54,260
We meet in freedom of speech.
There's a reason it's the first 

203
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:54,260
amendment.
You know,

204
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:58,041
if I was dumb enough to be single issue 
voter and that would be my single issue 

205
00:10:58,041 --> 00:11:00,870
because part of it is as,
as as a classical liberal,

206
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:03,990
I tend to approach Steve,
I have a strong amount of empathy,

207
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:09,260
but I also realize that that's not a 
trait that I can map on to everybody 

208
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:09,540
else in.
We're having a discussion that I have to

209
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:13,050
actually meet and make arguments for,
for people who,

210
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:18,080
who,
who approached the world in different 

211
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,731
ways and have different kinds of 
successes to make higher conscientious 

212
00:11:19,731 --> 00:11:20,880
arguments in a way that appeals more 
broadly.

213
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:24,480
And I mean that's free marketplace of 
ideas and we have to meet and figure out

214
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:29,481
and discuss these matters and if we're 
not doing it in words we're doing with 

215
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:29,481
fists tonight.

216
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:31,710
The other problem with agreeableness,
let's say an empathy,

217
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,880
is that the,
the,

218
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:39,070
the empathetic identification tends to 
make the person who's experiencing it 

219
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:43,530
feel immediately virtuous because 
they're on the side of the weaker party,

220
00:11:43,531 --> 00:11:48,531
let's say.
And there's obviously some utility in 

221
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:48,531
that,
but it's not really.

222
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:52,410
It doesn't come with a set of solutions 
to complex problems.

223
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,860
You know,
it seems to me that agreeableness is a 

224
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,020
pretty good virtue for small units like 
the family were egalitarianism.

225
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:04,070
Distribution is of extreme importance,
but it doesn't seem to work very well at

226
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,940
at higher levels of complexity.
So for example,

227
00:12:06,941 --> 00:12:10,150
it's conscientiousness predicts 
workplace proficiency,

228
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,450
you know,
it's the second best predictor predictor

229
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:17,460
after ICU.
Agreeableness is actually somewhat 

230
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,801
negatively correlated and less and less 
the domain has to do with direct 

231
00:12:19,801 --> 00:12:21,910
personal care.
And so I don't think agreeable to scales

232
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:26,911
very well,
which is why conscientiousness has to 

233
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:26,911
enter into the picture

234
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:29,250
and that's very helpful motivator for 
myself.

235
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,280
I look at a problem on my approach tends
to be empathy for people who have been 

236
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,520
left out or have been who don't have the
right end of the dominance hierarchy.

237
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:44,170
And for me it's a motivator to look at 
actual solutions and problems and issues

238
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:47,010
and there's a lot of real concrete 
things that can be attacked,

239
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:52,280
but if you don't attack them from a 
perspective that's morally 

240
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:52,280
condescending,
you can actually get shit done.

241
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:52,970
Well,
it also,

242
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,250
it's also very helpful to increase the 
resolution of the problem.

243
00:12:57,251 --> 00:12:58,230
Right?
And,

244
00:12:58,231 --> 00:13:01,870
and to stop trying to solve every 
problem with one with one brush stroke,

245
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:06,871
most things are really complicated.
So intelligent political discourse 

246
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:09,790
should involve decomposing a problem 
like poverty,

247
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,940
which isn't our problem,
but a set of a thousand problems into 

248
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,170
each of those thousand problems and then
trying to generate creative solutions to

249
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:21,310
each of them and then to test them.
And so the resolution of the,

250
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:26,370
of the discussion has to be increased.
And one of the things that you and I 

251
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,160
have talked about was the possibility 
that these longer form,

252
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,490
the longer form discourse,
um,

253
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,780
avenues that are available on the new 
media,

254
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:36,930
like what we're doing right now might 
enable us to identify and promote 

255
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,800
politicians who are capable of high 
resolution discussion,

256
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:44,130
who had the real solutions to real 
problems instead of having to compress 

257
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:44,230
everything into a six second soundbite.

258
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:49,790
Well,
the other thing that I'm finding really 

259
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,471
heartening is a lot of the candidates 
that I am working with interacting with 

260
00:13:51,471 --> 00:13:55,290
and at this point that's in the hundreds
are very focused on actual solutions.

261
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,750
And I'm trying to get a handle on,
you know,

262
00:13:57,751 --> 00:14:00,390
the cultural conversation,
whatever the hell that is,

263
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:05,810
it benefits by blowing the extremes and 
it feels like that's almost all that 

264
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:09,881
we're hearing about.
And when I'm dealing with actual 

265
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:12,330
candidates,
a lot of them are dealing with the anti 

266
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,590
corruption healthcare jobs and education
like are aware of that.

267
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:16,550
That isn't the plan.
And so there's this amplifying the facts

268
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,980
and then we have a lot of sort of like 
this cultural conversation about the 

269
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,770
cultural conversation that things become
very kind of narrow and the level of the

270
00:14:25,771 --> 00:14:28,680
candidates are operating at the level 
that people are.

271
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:29,180
You know,
I'm,

272
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,710
I'm dealing a lot with candidates in 
different states.

273
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,980
People are having a hard time right now 
and they need hardcore solutions and 

274
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,251
they actually don't give a shit about 
everyone on twitter and facebook who's 

275
00:14:40,251 --> 00:14:41,670
preaching.
Every Mazda already unfriended them.

276
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:46,730
They need solutions.
They need a government that's 

277
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:46,730
functional,
they need,

278
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:47,550
they want more transparency and 
microcorruption.

279
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,850
There's a very common set of things that
govern people,

280
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:56,110
but there's this sort of amplified 
effect from the extremes of the party 

281
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:00,370
that are gathering the the attention and
the biggest tool that we have in a 

282
00:15:00,831 --> 00:15:05,831
democracy in some ways is our attention 
and where we focus it and if that's 

283
00:15:05,831 --> 00:15:09,290
being hijacked by know bullshit 
conversations and Straw men.

284
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:13,490
I mean I would love to engage with,
with reasonable,

285
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,170
you know,
Republicans,

286
00:15:15,171 --> 00:15:18,500
a lot of whom are my friends and all my 
colleagues to say,

287
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:23,501
look,
I know we can go and push everything to 

288
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:23,501
extremes and find in debate and score 
points,

289
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:26,060
but like you don't like some of this 
shit anymore than I do.

290
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,210
Like what's an actual conversation from 
our different perspectives,

291
00:15:29,211 --> 00:15:34,211
assuming I don't have all the answers 
that we can come up with certain 

292
00:15:34,211 --> 00:15:35,630
solutions that's going to take care of 
people who are not doing as well.

293
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,440
You know,
who are not doing as well.

294
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,700
They're not keeping up with the economy 
because that's not good for anybody.

295
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,870
That's not a game that is iterable 
across multiple genes in generations.

296
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,920
If more and more people are starting to 
see more and more not good for anybody,

297
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:54,010
even the people at the top,
so how do we seek to kind of balance 

298
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,080
that out for people who don't have their
fair shot and during

299
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,230
conservative perspective you could say,
well,

300
00:15:58,231 --> 00:16:02,790
how do we stabilize the hierarchy so the
tendency for or the multiple hierarchies

301
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:07,791
for the tendency so that the tendency 
for people to stack up at the bottom 

302
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:11,841
doesn't become so extreme that the 
entire system starts to shake and 

303
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:11,841
tremble,

304
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:13,070
which obviously isn't good for anyone at
all.

305
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,020
We're seeing a lot of shaking and 
trembling.

306
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:20,021
I mean,
I think a lot of people in the last 

307
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,380
election did not feel heard or seen or 
represented in the choices of candidates

308
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,050
and a lot of people were like,
I don't care what it is.

309
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,330
It's not going to be business as usual.
Right?

310
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,880
So the solution isn't,
in my estimation,

311
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:31,880
to denigrate people who chose to vote 
for president trump.

312
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:36,710
I think the solution is to talk about 
the fact that we need to do better.

313
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:42,100
If we want to promote a.
If the Democrats want to promote a 

314
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,341
viable alternative,
we have to do better with what our 

315
00:16:45,341 --> 00:16:47,681
messaging is.
We have to do better on messages that 

316
00:16:47,681 --> 00:16:47,681
are anticorruption and we have to make a
better argument.

317
00:16:47,681 --> 00:16:48,560
Yeah.
Well the thing is,

318
00:16:48,561 --> 00:16:53,561
you know,
I was on Bill Maher show a while back 

319
00:16:53,561 --> 00:16:56,051
and a lot of the panelists on his show 
really taking pot shots at the trump 

320
00:16:56,051 --> 00:16:57,250
supporters and,
and you know,

321
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:01,160
with the typical sort of pejorative 
center label that are leveled at them.

322
00:17:01,161 --> 00:17:06,161
And I thought that was extremely 
dangerous because they're basically 

323
00:17:06,161 --> 00:17:07,670
dissing,
let's say he was a terrible cliche about

324
00:17:07,671 --> 00:17:12,671
50 percent of the American population in
the same percentage that's been voting 

325
00:17:12,671 --> 00:17:15,140
Republican for about 20 years.
And to just out of hand dismiss your,

326
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,220
the people who are voting differently 
than,

327
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,410
than you as somehow primitive or 
primordial or,

328
00:17:20,411 --> 00:17:24,230
or foolish or are ill advised is very,
very dangerous.

329
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:29,231
And also more than that,
it's also an abdication of 

330
00:17:29,231 --> 00:17:32,501
responsibility because the Republicans 
might have won the last election or 

331
00:17:32,501 --> 00:17:37,221
trump might have won the last election,
but certainly the democrats lost the 

332
00:17:37,221 --> 00:17:37,870
last election.
And so I would,

333
00:17:37,871 --> 00:17:42,871
if I thought that their discourse would 
have been a lot more productive if they 

334
00:17:42,871 --> 00:17:43,490
would have focused on the failings of 
the Democratic Party,

335
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:48,730
and that's also a lot more useful 
because if you can figure out why you 

336
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,100
didn't succeed,
even though it very close election,

337
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:51,690
if you can figure out what mistakes you 
made,

338
00:17:51,691 --> 00:17:52,830
then you could rectify it.

339
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:59,150
That's exactly along the lines of the 
things that you and I talked about at 

340
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,290
length,
which is personal accountability.

341
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:05,291
It's like you get in a fight with your 
wife or your husband is the best thing 

342
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,570
to do to point out the 50 percent or 80 
percent or 90 percent where they screwed

343
00:18:08,571 --> 00:18:12,530
up or to actually reflect and think 
about whatever percent it is at whatever

344
00:18:12,531 --> 00:18:15,950
number that you can do something better 
that's actually within your control.

345
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,100
And so for me,
that's a scalable notion.

346
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:24,130
You know,
I have many friends too wide and varied 

347
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:24,470
and smart who voted for trump to dismiss
them all as idiots.

348
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,520
It's,
it's a very,

349
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,130
you can't denigrate it.
And plus we're married to them.

350
00:18:28,131 --> 00:18:33,131
That's $50.
40 nine point nine percent of our 

351
00:18:33,131 --> 00:18:36,131
population,
we are married to them and we have to 

352
00:18:36,131 --> 00:18:39,221
figure out how to talk and to come up 
with solutions that make sense and that 

353
00:18:39,221 --> 00:18:43,451
everybody can and so for me,
a lot of it is to look at what the 

354
00:18:43,451 --> 00:18:46,610
impulse was that was underlying that and
figure out where Democrats can be better

355
00:18:46,611 --> 00:18:51,611
at seeing and hearing people and 
furthering arguments in ways that feel 

356
00:18:51,611 --> 00:18:53,600
with legitimate and connect with people 
and figure out what the messaging is.

357
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,600
So you always clean up your side of the 
house first and it doesn't mean that 

358
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,400
there's.
There's a number of policies that I'm 

359
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,181
highly critical of president trump.
That doesn't mean that identity great 

360
00:19:04,181 --> 00:19:07,840
his followers or the people who voted 
for him or that I will dismiss any 

361
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,280
tendencies that they might've had or 
hesitations that they might've had about

362
00:19:10,281 --> 00:19:11,080
voting or otherwise.

363
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,500
The right message should be something 
like,

364
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,280
I'm not so much white.
Your opponent is worse,

365
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,520
but by why you're better,
why your solutions are better,

366
00:19:20,521 --> 00:19:21,270
why?
Why,

367
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,050
why,
why?

368
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,060
The grass is greener on your side of the
fence.

369
00:19:24,061 --> 00:19:29,061
Why there's less corruption occurring 
under your watch and and also marketing 

370
00:19:29,061 --> 00:19:32,430
the fact that the solutions that you 
have are both reasonable and practical.

371
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:36,510
I mean that does require more elevated 
form of political discourse and it would

372
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:39,060
be really nice if that could be 
facilitated by these,

373
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,710
by these long forms that are available.

374
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,440
Hear the refrain all the time of the 
Democrats don't have a message that 

375
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,600
president trump is awful,
is not a message and I'd been.

376
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,640
I'd been really heartened with the 
conversations that I'm having with 

377
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,300
candidates right now that there's a huge
focus on kitchen table issues.

378
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:00,340
There's a huge focus on trying to tackle
health care and education to jobs in 

379
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,411
ways that are more innovative.
When you talk to the actual candidates 

380
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,620
who I want to start to pull it into more
and more conversations.

381
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:09,460
I have an enormous amount of of optimism
and the other thing is,

382
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:14,900
is your real money where your mouth is 
stance against corruption and there is 

383
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,601
something.
There's something called the disclose 

384
00:20:18,601 --> 00:20:19,150
act that a lot of Democrats are working 
on which is fully disclosing all of your

385
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,350
donors,
you know,

386
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:25,351
releasing taxes.
I'm taking a pledge against no dark 

387
00:20:25,351 --> 00:20:25,351
money.

388
00:20:25,351 --> 00:20:26,440
There's a whole number of different 
resolutions,

389
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:31,441
you know,
I'm fighting voter suppression and that 

390
00:20:31,441 --> 00:20:33,781
means whether we lose or not,
it's not about fighting voter 

391
00:20:33,781 --> 00:20:36,511
suppression to sort of tell the vote.
It's like we need the right to win 

392
00:20:36,511 --> 00:20:41,131
elections or lose elections fairly,
and so there's a lot of positions that 

393
00:20:41,131 --> 00:20:43,440
are being put forth right now that I 
feel are really heartening,

394
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,650
including a very strong anticorruption 
stance because you can't.

395
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:52,710
You have to clean up what your site is 
and in this wave of candidates and I'm 

396
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,401
looking at,
it's been really impressive to me how 

397
00:20:56,401 --> 00:20:58,240
they're starting to further and 
articulate what the,

398
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,720
what the argument can be from that side 
and I think that's what we can also 

399
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,110
start to find common ground to talk 
about the corruption.

400
00:21:05,111 --> 00:21:10,111
I mean there's a lot of republicans who 
are enthralled with the level of 

401
00:21:10,111 --> 00:21:10,111
discourse right now.

402
00:21:10,111 --> 00:21:13,970
Well,
one of the things that struck me when 

403
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,881
I've been talking to you lately is we've
been talking about what happened with 

404
00:21:15,881 --> 00:21:17,840
the Democratic Party is also the idea 
that the radicals,

405
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:22,870
the identity politics types managed to 
take over the narrative to a large 

406
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:26,711
degree,
partly because the extremism is more 

407
00:21:26,711 --> 00:21:28,931
attractive,
let's say among a dying mainstream 

408
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:28,931
media.
It's click,

409
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:32,540
baity and and easy to attract attention 
to and loud and and cinematic and all of

410
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:37,541
those things,
but also that the centrist Democrats 

411
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:40,370
seem to have lost faith in their central
narrative or perhaps have failed to,

412
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:45,460
to produce one over the last 15 years 
and that left a void into which the 

413
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,630
extremist narrative,
the oppressor,

414
00:21:47,631 --> 00:21:49,790
oppressive oppressor,
oppression,

415
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:50,660
narrative,
let's say,

416
00:21:50,661 --> 00:21:55,661
or or pressure victim narrative has been
able to slide in and dominate because of

417
00:21:55,851 --> 00:22:00,851
that void.
And so that's another thing that needs 

418
00:22:00,851 --> 00:22:03,191
to be seriously addressed.
It's like the center has lost its 

419
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:03,191
narrative and,
and,

420
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:04,760
and,
and that's something I'd like to see the

421
00:22:04,761 --> 00:22:07,950
Democrats a deal with now in it,
in,

422
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:10,850
in,
in the first ad that you generate it.

423
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:13,430
You had a farmer talk,
if I remember correctly,

424
00:22:13,431 --> 00:22:18,431
you had a farmer talk about success and 
about what that might mean if you could 

425
00:22:18,431 --> 00:22:18,431
obtain it individually.

426
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:23,850
I think where we have fallen down as 
Democrats and and where we are now 

427
00:22:24,101 --> 00:22:25,520
reorienting is,
is,

428
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,880
is the discussion of aspirational 
values,

429
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:32,881
meaning is it a rigged game?
Like we can absolutely point to things 

430
00:22:32,881 --> 00:22:33,370
that are disadvantages,
you know,

431
00:22:33,371 --> 00:22:35,230
but to say it's a rigged game,
it's a regained.

432
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:39,130
The thing that we have to say is all 
that we're in favor of our fair rules at

433
00:22:39,131 --> 00:22:42,130
the starting gate and if you work 
harder,

434
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,760
if you're an innovator,
if you bust your ass good on you,

435
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:47,950
like go buy a mansion in three cars,
you know,

436
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:52,951
go start a second business.
We have to be rewarding of success and 

437
00:22:52,951 --> 00:22:54,280
speaking to people's aspirations and you
know,

438
00:22:54,281 --> 00:22:59,281
we talk a lot about income inequality 
and the problem with that is what's the 

439
00:22:59,281 --> 00:22:59,530
opposite of that?
Is income equality.

440
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,850
Well,
nobody wants that.

441
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:05,940
If you look at the average salaries and 
incomes of people in the Senate and 

442
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,430
Congress,
they're doing just fine.

443
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,440
They don't want that either.
And so for me,

444
00:23:08,441 --> 00:23:13,441
I think it's much more powerful to talk 
about income injustice because it means 

445
00:23:13,441 --> 00:23:17,341
that people have a fair shot at the 
starting gate and then they can 

446
00:23:17,341 --> 00:23:20,821
differentiate themselves by their own 
abilities and their own willingness to 

447
00:23:20,821 --> 00:23:24,931
work.
And for me it's about the starting gate 

448
00:23:24,931 --> 00:23:24,931
and making sure that we look at things 
that are there.

449
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,790
Yeah,
well and also that the emphasis that you

450
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:32,970
placed on rewarding actual achievement.
We also have to be in a situation where 

451
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:37,021
we can admit that at least one of the 
factors that differentiates people as 

452
00:23:37,021 --> 00:23:40,771
they move up competence hierarchies.
And we have to admit that some of the 

453
00:23:40,771 --> 00:23:44,851
hierarchies that exist are actually 
based on competence and not merely on 

454
00:23:44,851 --> 00:23:45,890
oppression is the amount of effort they 
into things.

455
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,680
And you know,
that's become.

456
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:52,710
That's become an anastomotic,
a proposition on many university 

457
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,380
campuses where you're not allowed,
in fact,

458
00:23:54,381 --> 00:23:58,550
to state that hard work because at some 
of the people who have made it,

459
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:03,850
have done a,
done it as a consequence of working 

460
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:06,041
extra hard.
Because I guess that undermines the 

461
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:08,651
narrative that the whole game is rigged.
And the truth of the matter is the game 

462
00:24:08,651 --> 00:24:10,490
is partly raped,
like all games always are,

463
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:15,491
and that is unfortunate,
but you can't throw the whole damn game 

464
00:24:15,491 --> 00:24:18,771
mode because it's partly rigged just 
unless you think you can put in place a 

465
00:24:18,771 --> 00:24:19,700
game that isn't going to be rigged.
And good luck with that.

466
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,040
It's

467
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:25,750
here's very interesting interview 
between Weinstein and bench purell on 

468
00:24:25,981 --> 00:24:30,981
the podcast.
What's so interesting is there from 

469
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:30,981
completely opposite sides of the 
spectrum.

470
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:32,280
I think it doesn't hurt to find himself 
as a socialist.

471
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,960
Well,
he's certainly on the left.

472
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,310
Yeah,
I mean so,

473
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,500
but you have them discussed and it was 
very,

474
00:24:37,501 --> 00:24:42,501
very civil discourse and I think eric 
can do a much better job than I can of 

475
00:24:42,501 --> 00:24:46,311
discussing the ways in which the issue 
isn't that there is a dominance 

476
00:24:46,311 --> 00:24:48,330
hierarchy and the people differentiate 
themselves based on their hard work.

477
00:24:48,331 --> 00:24:53,331
The issue is sort of what we've seen 
with the separation of the working 

478
00:24:53,331 --> 00:24:53,350
class.
You know,

479
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,360
he,
he points to a lot of trends about 

480
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,100
what's happened with workers' wages.
You're a ceo a few seconds ago,

481
00:24:59,101 --> 00:25:01,710
made three times the average worker.
Now it's a $300.

482
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:07,050
It's not about overall people doing well
if there's an increasing exponential 

483
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:07,620
separation between,
you know,

484
00:25:07,621 --> 00:25:12,621
working people and people who are at the
top and I think that's the skew that's 

485
00:25:12,621 --> 00:25:17,211
problematic and the fact of the matter 
is rather than pushing away and you 

486
00:25:17,401 --> 00:25:19,380
know,
we could talk a little bit also about,

487
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,050
you know,
conservatives like Ben,

488
00:25:22,051 --> 00:25:27,051
but rather than sort of denigrating it,
there's a lot of good brains on both 

489
00:25:27,051 --> 00:25:30,620
sides of the fence and like wouldn't it 
be absolutely lovely if we have 

490
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,951
reasonable conversations about what we 
all want to do about that rather than 

491
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:38,551
the physician having to be income 
equality versus only self reliance and 

492
00:25:38,651 --> 00:25:41,370
play yourself up by your bootstraps 
because there's some people who can't do

493
00:25:41,371 --> 00:25:41,580
that.

494
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:44,970
There are some fundamental problems with
the system,

495
00:25:44,971 --> 00:25:49,971
this leading to people having a lot 
harder time and everyone agrees with 

496
00:25:49,971 --> 00:25:51,060
that.
And if we can talk about the details,

497
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,240
you know,
it's sort of like when we talk about 

498
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:56,240
universal healthcare,
I feel like you come in the door and the

499
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,180
minute you say it,
people are for and against.

500
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:02,630
And for me,
there's a lot of other arguments to 

501
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:02,630
make.
It's like,

502
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,821
look,
we already have universal healthcare in 

503
00:26:04,821 --> 00:26:04,821
this country.
It's called emergency rooms.

504
00:26:04,821 --> 00:26:07,200
It's UNAMERICAN and wrong to let people 
die on the streets.

505
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:10,020
We don't do that.
But if people are uninsured,

506
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:15,200
the hospital passes on the costs of 
insurance companies who raise our 

507
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,960
premiums.
So the average cost of an emergency room

508
00:26:15,961 --> 00:26:19,110
visit in the United States is 1000,
$233.

509
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:21,810
The average cost of a vaccination is 
$19.

510
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:26,900
We're all paying for it anyways.
And there's also a lot less risk of 

511
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,630
public health hazards and other things.

512
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:32,630
If we can figure out a way to come up 
with a medical system that people are 

513
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:36,321
getting the care that they want.
Preventive care is infinitely cheaper 

514
00:26:36,321 --> 00:26:36,810
than trying to play catch up in 
emergency rooms.

515
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,660
And if you don't just walk in the door 
and say,

516
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,720
I'm for universal healthcare,
I'm opposed to universal healthcare 

517
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:44,720
because a lot of say,
look,

518
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,460
I was out of work and having a hard time
and I had to feed.

519
00:26:46,461 --> 00:26:51,461
You are paying my own healthcare.
We have to frame it in a way of saying 

520
00:26:51,461 --> 00:26:54,680
this is good for the robustness of the 
whole community and I think there's a 

521
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,760
lot of arguments and discussions are 
from both sides that we need.

522
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:01,790
We need all those brains pulling 
together and it's one of the things is 

523
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:05,240
I'm watching a lot of new stuff.
I would love to see increasingly 

524
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,530
increasing conversations like the one 
that Eric and Ben had where their stupid

525
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:13,580
from the opposite side who are engaging 
very reasonably and seeing each other's 

526
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,751
points and trying to figure out what 
skills they can bring from the 

527
00:27:17,751 --> 00:27:18,030
respective sides of the proverbial 
aisle.

528
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:23,630
So you see,
you think you see within the Democratic 

529
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:27,140
Party in an attempt at least to increase
the resolution of the discussion and to 

530
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,450
move away from the more polarizing 
discourse you see that

531
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,470
starting to develop.
Absolutely.

532
00:27:30,471 --> 00:27:35,471
So tell,
tell me some of those concrete things 

533
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:35,471
you've seen.
Well,

534
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:35,471
I mean,
you know,

535
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:37,250
I've been meeting with a lot of 
candidates.

536
00:27:37,251 --> 00:27:42,251
I found there there's a candidate who I 
really liked called Joseph Kopser is 

537
00:27:42,251 --> 00:27:44,680
running in tax this who's a 20 year in 
armies ranger,

538
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:48,230
I believe he is a bronze star.
He's a graduate of Harvard.

539
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:53,260
Kennedy school is a professor at West 
Point and what was amazing with him is 

540
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,210
like he was talking about universal 
healthcare.

541
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:59,230
He started his own business,
a private business that led to tons of 

542
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:02,771
jobs and he's just incredible person and
he made an argument in a way I haven't 

543
00:28:02,771 --> 00:28:03,860
ever thought about it.
He's talking about healthcare.

544
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,610
He was like,
look,

545
00:28:04,611 --> 00:28:07,340
I have my healthcare from the army for 
life.

546
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:12,770
That allowed me to take a risk and go 
out entrepreneurially to start a company

547
00:28:12,771 --> 00:28:14,660
that then led to tons and tons of time.

548
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:15,720
Yeah.
You know,

549
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:20,750
there's evidence in Canada.
Our rate of entrepreneurial development 

550
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:21,840
in Canada per capita,
it's actually slightly higher than it is

551
00:28:21,841 --> 00:28:26,841
in the US and analysis has indicated 
that one of the reasons for that is the 

552
00:28:26,841 --> 00:28:30,180
provision of universal health care.
People can take entrepreneurial risks in

553
00:28:30,181 --> 00:28:33,180
Canada without losing their,
their fundamental safety net.

554
00:28:33,181 --> 00:28:37,920
So you can make a conservative argument 
for the provision of a certain level of,

555
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,930
of underlying security,
let's say

556
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,390
it was.
It was a great argument for me.

557
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,600
I mean the other thing is I'm seeing a 
lot of candidates who are Democrats who 

558
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,770
were very upfront with their support for
the second amendment and it's like,

559
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:53,440
look,
the second amendment is an amendment.

560
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,100
You can't just get rid of an amendment.
And I know that as a classical liberal,

561
00:28:57,101 --> 00:28:59,410
when people come after freedom of 
speech,

562
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,430
I get really pissed.
Right?

563
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,370
And people who were,
who were,

564
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:08,380
who were living in different regions in 
different states that have different 

565
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,341
cultures.
When they hear people start to attack 

566
00:29:11,341 --> 00:29:11,341
the second amendment or or when it's 
global,

567
00:29:11,341 --> 00:29:16,111
where it's all or nothing.
If there is an inherent threat that 

568
00:29:16,111 --> 00:29:17,240
comes with.
And a lot of it for me is to look at and

569
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:17,680
go,
look,

570
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,270
every amendment has certain limitations 
on us.

571
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,770
Right?
So you can't stand up on an airplane and

572
00:29:23,771 --> 00:29:24,640
scream that you have a ball.

573
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:29,670
You can't threaten the president.
United States that you're going to kill 

574
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:29,670
him.
The first amendment.

575
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:31,960
We have parameters around it.
We already have them in place around the

576
00:29:31,961 --> 00:29:34,300
second amendment.
Everybody knows you can't own a bazooka.

577
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:36,370
Everyone knows you can't own a dirty 
bomb.

578
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,750
So instead of coming in and sort of 
frightened people in their way of life,

579
00:29:40,751 --> 00:29:42,340
if they handguns,
if they're hunting,

580
00:29:42,341 --> 00:29:47,341
if they are weapons collectors,
if we can boil the resolution down to 

581
00:29:47,341 --> 00:29:51,661
say we're already having every amendment
we have or the first and second 

582
00:29:51,661 --> 00:29:55,261
amendment,
we have certain limitations that we've 

583
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:57,261
placed on it for the community.
So how about if we just talk about 

584
00:29:57,261 --> 00:29:59,770
violent history checks,
let's just talk about that one piece.

585
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,060
So 90 percent of Americans are in favor 
of that in 73 percent of the NRA.

586
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,730
And so to have a candidate stand up and 
say,

587
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:09,010
you know,
I love the First Amendment,

588
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,170
I fully support the second amendment.
Believe me,

589
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,790
I've a lot of friends.
Your Army Rangers,

590
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:17,791
Green Berets and seals.
I know that cultural wealth and rather 

591
00:30:17,791 --> 00:30:19,780
than having some sort of frontal attack 
on it to sort of say,

592
00:30:19,781 --> 00:30:21,940
well,
what's reasonable if you can't yell fire

593
00:30:21,941 --> 00:30:26,941
in a crowded theater?
How about if we only discussed that and 

594
00:30:26,941 --> 00:30:28,450
I'm standing with 90 percent of 
Americans in 73 percent of NRA members?

595
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:33,370
It's a much more respectful conversation
and it's a much more solution based.

596
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,290
Also a humble,
humble or

597
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:40,510
appreciation because it it,
it requires a certain amount of 

598
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,870
appreciation for incremental change,
right?

599
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:47,430
You will very ego inflating to do a 
great thing to make a massive change and

600
00:30:49,221 --> 00:30:51,950
much less so to work in the background 
to make a small change,

601
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:57,280
but small changes are solid and they 
tend not to produce terrible negative 

602
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,661
consequences and to and to work 
incrementally is to work realistically 

603
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:05,280
and properly.
And I would also say meaningfully and,

604
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:10,900
and that that's another,
that's another element that needs to be 

605
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,330
introduced back into the discourse is 
like,

606
00:31:11,331 --> 00:31:13,040
well,
why don't we,

607
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:18,780
you know,
the people who established the American 

608
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,580
American system where incrementalists 
fundamentally and they knew perfectly 

609
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,901
well that we had a flawed system that 
was always going to be flawed in the 

610
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:26,900
best we could do is tinker away out 
incrementally.

611
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:30,200
And that's a really lovely sentiment.
I think it's very,

612
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:34,130
it's very mature and wise to understand 
that what you're working on,

613
00:31:34,131 --> 00:31:34,940
it's like a highway.

614
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:39,940
It always needs repair.
There's always going to be construction 

615
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,451
on it.
There's always going to be blockages on 

616
00:31:42,451 --> 00:31:42,451
it because it needs to be maintained and
updated.

617
00:31:42,451 --> 00:31:42,710
But you don't,
you don't,

618
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,170
you don't scrap the whole thing with 
every move.

619
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:50,560
And part of the problem with the 
discourse now too is that every issue 

620
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,130
becomes code for an ideological 
position.

621
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:54,750
Like I have a real hard time with,
um,

622
00:31:55,190 --> 00:32:00,190
all the environmentalist noise that I 
hear on mainstream media in particular 

623
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:03,470
because I always see it as code for a 
very fundamental anticapitalist ethos.

624
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:08,650
And so I can't separate the wheat from 
the chaff mean I know because I've read 

625
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:12,170
a lot about ecological issues that there
are foolish things that people are doing

626
00:32:12,171 --> 00:32:15,950
in the world for a variety of reasons.
Like overfishing is a real catastrophe.

627
00:32:15,951 --> 00:32:19,400
And it was so as deep ocean trolley as 
far as I'm concerned.

628
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:22,940
But when I read general environmentalist
claims,

629
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:27,941
and these include climate change claims,
I can't separate it from a fundamental 

630
00:32:27,941 --> 00:32:29,660
anticapitalist ethos.
And so I can't decide,

631
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,570
I can never decide whether I can trust 
the

632
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,220
underlined to that man is bad in New 
Jersey,

633
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:40,700
right?
That's not a rallying cry to say,

634
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:45,730
let me pitch original sin to you just to
say what are short term effective gains 

635
00:32:46,041 --> 00:32:51,041
that can be made in additional middle 
and longterm in business for clean 

636
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:52,700
rivers and clean oceans and for fishing 
industries.

637
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:58,030
Um,
and also to talk about the things we've 

638
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:58,030
accomplished.
I mean,

639
00:32:58,030 --> 00:32:59,450
we closed the ozone hole and companies 
did business.

640
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,030
There are actually solutions.
Um,

641
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:02,610
you know,
we've,

642
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:05,870
we've basically eliminated polio from 
the face of the earth.

643
00:33:05,871 --> 00:33:10,871
There's entrepreneurial and innovative 
solutions for things that can also be 

644
00:33:10,871 --> 00:33:13,760
pro business.
We've reforested northern hemisphere,

645
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:18,820
you know,
there's more forest in the northern 

646
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:18,820
hemisphere then there was 100 years ago.
So you said this thing about,

647
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:23,560
about incremental change.
And that's another thing I've been 

648
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,351
thinking about a lot,
which is when we walk in the door and 

649
00:33:26,351 --> 00:33:26,351
say,
I'm for gun control,

650
00:33:26,351 --> 00:33:28,860
or I'm prolife in,
in,

651
00:33:28,861 --> 00:33:30,920
in every circumstance,
or,

652
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:31,970
or,
um,

653
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,870
you know,
to come in with an absolute position.

654
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,240
I'm one of the things that's really 
tricky is if you're not willing to have 

655
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,110
a conversation,
if you're not willing to see grounds,

656
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:46,010
there was no terms under which you feel 
that the,

657
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:51,140
the negotiation or compromise can be 
satisfied and that gets really 

658
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:55,541
dangerous.
And it's funny because it's something 

659
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:57,431
that I always advocate for when people 
talk about sort of a broad sweeping 

660
00:33:57,431 --> 00:34:01,520
systemic problem or justice.
The problem is it doesn't boil it down.

661
00:34:01,521 --> 00:34:06,521
A level of resolution that you can get 
traction from all the people that you 

662
00:34:06,521 --> 00:34:06,521
need because people feel like,
well,

663
00:34:06,521 --> 00:34:08,510
what's the solution?
The solution is to throw everything away

664
00:34:08,511 --> 00:34:10,850
positive and negative and change 
everything.

665
00:34:10,851 --> 00:34:12,740
They're not going to do it.
And it's a problem.

666
00:34:12,741 --> 00:34:15,410
We solve the occupy Wall Street.
Um,

667
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:20,590
and you know,
it sort of spread from generalized 

668
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:23,951
corruption.
And incidentally they were targeting 

669
00:34:23,951 --> 00:34:26,651
sort of the banks and the bigger systems
almost more than they were the 

670
00:34:26,651 --> 00:34:27,230
government who was allowing a lot of it.

671
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,590
But then as it kept rolling in issue 
after issue after issue,

672
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,690
it starts to get very complex.
I'm like,

673
00:34:32,691 --> 00:34:34,640
well,
if we can see it and make changes,

674
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,800
are there any terms under which you will
be satisfied?

675
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,120
And I think that's,
uh,

676
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:43,170
that's one of the aspects of coming in 
on positions of like for Oregon to 

677
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,630
universal health care for or against the
second amendment.

678
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,200
There's no ground to be had there 
because everyone's is digging in their 

679
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:53,261
heels and I feel like it's also a bit of
a product of a social media and the fact

680
00:34:53,571 --> 00:34:55,450
that we've all been sort of infants 
allies,

681
00:34:55,490 --> 00:35:00,490
just sort of these lights and dobutamine
hits that keep driving virtue signaling 

682
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,450
and that goes for both sides.
So it goes for both sides.

683
00:35:02,451 --> 00:35:04,910
If you can get a real slam or digging on
your opponent,

684
00:35:04,911 --> 00:35:06,280
the good for you.
And meanwhile,

685
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:08,660
in the middle there's a ton of 
Americans.

686
00:35:08,661 --> 00:35:10,440
There's a ton of kids,
uh,

687
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,980
in education systems that need real 
solutions.

688
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,040
And it doesn't matter how much we're 
signaling what our beliefs are in our 

689
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,500
respective balls.
It doesn't come down to a real solution.

690
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:22,970
It's also much more difficult to 
generate real solutions because it means

691
00:35:22,971 --> 00:35:24,890
you actually have to have some domain 
knowledge.

692
00:35:24,891 --> 00:35:26,930
And it isn't obvious,
for example,

693
00:35:26,931 --> 00:35:31,931
that the classic forms of media that 
politicians have used to interact with 

694
00:35:33,651 --> 00:35:38,651
the populace have rewarded high 
resolution knowledge know because it 

695
00:35:38,651 --> 00:35:38,651
becomes,

696
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,880
well it's easy for it to get tangled up 
in the details for that kind of 

697
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,100
discussion to get tangled up in the 
details.

698
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:49,101
But these longer form conversations 
might allow people to unpack some of 

699
00:35:49,101 --> 00:35:49,440
that in a more intelligent way.

700
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,800
Well,
there's a great discussion between Dave 

701
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,770
and Ben Shapiro at one point talking 
about abortion and they're on opposite 

702
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:02,821
sides of it.
And what was really interesting was it 

703
00:36:02,821 --> 00:36:03,670
was civil and there was no denigration 
of the opposing side.

704
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,440
Also we're saying,
look,

705
00:36:05,441 --> 00:36:10,270
I don't have an exact answer of when for
me it becomes uncomfortable.

706
00:36:10,271 --> 00:36:15,271
Like there is some point that did.
It moves from something that is into a 

707
00:36:15,971 --> 00:36:17,500
point that he's not comfortable with 
abortion.

708
00:36:17,501 --> 00:36:21,200
There's a certain date that that would 
happen or certain point in trimesters.

709
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,480
And so it's,
it's.

710
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,040
And it's,
it's hard.

711
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:26,410
There aren't super clear and easy 
answers.

712
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,600
And you know,
ben has a different position.

713
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,790
Obviously he's much more conservative on
that front,

714
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:32,680
but that's a position.
It's weird.

715
00:36:32,681 --> 00:36:34,150
I have a lot of friends who were born 
again,

716
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,040
Christians and it's like,
that's a physician.

717
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:40,630
You can't just dismiss,
like you have to talk about it like that

718
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:42,880
to human position for people who have 
not belief.

719
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:43,810
I mean,
so for me,

720
00:36:43,811 --> 00:36:48,811
what it really comes down to when 
there's sort of different positions on 

721
00:36:48,811 --> 00:36:50,320
stuff that's really fundamental for 
people is to say,

722
00:36:50,321 --> 00:36:51,120
look,
I don't,

723
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,210
we,
I feel like Democrats have to talk about

724
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,700
it.
We use it or more humanizing,

725
00:36:54,701 --> 00:36:56,890
which is,
I don't actually know what I would do in

726
00:36:56,891 --> 00:36:59,750
that circumstance if my wife,
um,

727
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:00,880
you know,
was,

728
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:01,550
was,
was,

729
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,480
was pregnant or girlfriend,
uh,

730
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:06,670
like it's a really hard choice.
It's not something that just flippant of

731
00:37:06,671 --> 00:37:07,120
like,
oh,

732
00:37:07,121 --> 00:37:09,370
it's a cluster of cells and it carries 
no emotional waves.

733
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,350
That's,
I just don't find that to be true.

734
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,630
But for me there's a certain point where
it's like,

735
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,810
that's ever true for anyone who has an 
experience like that.

736
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:17,690
Right?
And I,

737
00:37:17,691 --> 00:37:19,990
I feel right way to approach it the.
Well,

738
00:37:19,991 --> 00:37:21,790
I think that the answer is like,
look,

739
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:23,050
I don't know what I would do.

740
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,180
I don't claim to have all the answers 
morally.

741
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:30,510
The one thing that I believe is I don't 
want the government coming into your 

742
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:33,400
house and into your bedroom and telling 
your life or you want to do like.

743
00:37:33,401 --> 00:37:38,401
That's something I feel like it's so 
deeply personal and sometimes all you 

744
00:37:38,401 --> 00:37:39,400
have are shitty choices and choices that
aren't good.

745
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:44,730
And the flip side for me is I don't know
what the alternative is when we're 

746
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:45,220
really talking with specifics.
I don't know,

747
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,150
a government mandated pregnancy looks 
like.

748
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,440
So if a daughter or a niece who's 18 is 
pregnant and doesn't want to have a 

749
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,271
child,
I don't know what the solution is to 

750
00:37:57,271 --> 00:37:59,281
that.
Like how does the government then 

751
00:37:59,281 --> 00:38:00,770
mandate that and oversee that.
And so these are conversations that,

752
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:01,440
that,
you know,

753
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,080
I think are legitimate conversations to 
be had,

754
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:10,350
but,
but from a position of respect rather 

755
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:10,350
than,
you know,

756
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:14,580
sort of slogans or the fact that the 
people who are prolife or anti anti 

757
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:18,820
women,
because there's a lot of women who I 

758
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:18,820
know who,
who have,

759
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:18,820
you know,
deeply held prolife positions,

760
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:21,010
I think it has to be a bit of a 
conversation for me.

761
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,830
I feel like these are really personal 
choices.

762
00:38:23,831 --> 00:38:28,831
I have a strong libertarian reaction to 
it and I also don't understand what the 

763
00:38:28,831 --> 00:38:33,001
solution is going to be.
If that does become something that 

764
00:38:33,001 --> 00:38:36,301
somebody doesn't want to have a child,
I don't understand how the government 

765
00:38:36,301 --> 00:38:36,730
mandates that and what that looks like 
for those nine months.

766
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,320
And so,
you know,

767
00:38:38,321 --> 00:38:41,200
it's not an approach that is dismissive,
that's all or nothing.

768
00:38:41,201 --> 00:38:43,240
It's an approach of having a 
conversation about,

769
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:48,300
you know,
different values and we have different 

770
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,311
values and we have to figure out how to,
how to talk about them in ways that 

771
00:38:50,311 --> 00:38:50,311
aren't dehumanizing.

772
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,000
So what do you think,
what's a good plan for the next few 

773
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,000
months?
What do you,

774
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,000
what are you going to try to do?

775
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,640
Well,
I have a number of plans.

776
00:38:58,641 --> 00:39:03,641
I mean,
one of them is to keep Democrats focus 

777
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,960
on nuts and bolts issues.
I also really,

778
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:11,020
um,
there's a lot of republican voices that 

779
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,590
I think are really important.
I really liked Evan Mcmullin.

780
00:39:12,591 --> 00:39:17,591
I really liked where Wilson,
there's a number of commentators who 

781
00:39:17,591 --> 00:39:18,920
would been been really interesting and 
compelling.

782
00:39:18,921 --> 00:39:21,170
I listened to the broad spectrum of 
everything.

783
00:39:21,171 --> 00:39:26,171
I wake up every morning and also read 
the drudge report and watch Fox News to 

784
00:39:26,171 --> 00:39:30,960
have an understanding of,
of what opposing narratives are so that 

785
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,900
I can understand the full sort of 
spectrum and what's bothering people,

786
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,730
what is it,
and my finger

787
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Shapiro's a really good voice as far as 
I'm concerned because he's as 

788
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,450
intelligent and articulator of the 
social conservative position as you 

789
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:48,381
could hope for.
And so he's a great whetstone against 

790
00:39:48,381 --> 00:39:49,840
which Democrats could sharpen their 
knives were taken.

791
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,220
If they can confront him in a reasonable
argument successfully,

792
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,560
then they've already got the argument 
down.

793
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,320
Because.

794
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,350
And here's the thing with Ben.
He's got a great brain.

795
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:05,380
I actually would like it if he was 
playing less defense and actually we 

796
00:40:05,691 --> 00:40:07,790
could be engaged the way that eric has 
to be like,

797
00:40:07,791 --> 00:40:08,930
look,
what is your,

798
00:40:08,931 --> 00:40:11,000
what are your solutions and thoughts on 
this from.

799
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:13,980
There are some things he said that I 
deeply disagree with.

800
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:17,840
Like I don't believe that all trans 
people are mentally ill.

801
00:40:17,841 --> 00:40:22,841
He has some physicians,
but nothing that I've seen indicates to 

802
00:40:22,841 --> 00:40:24,430
me that he's someone who can conceivably
be reason with.

803
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:27,620
He's also pointed out in places where he
believes he's screwed up.

804
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:32,890
He's written a whole articles about 
reversing his position on things or 

805
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:33,830
stuff.
He said that was dom and well,

806
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,000
that's,
that's his words,

807
00:40:35,001 --> 00:40:36,360
not mine,
but um,

808
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,540
you know,
it's like the Ralph Waldo Emerson,

809
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:43,570
foolish,
foolish consistency is the Hobgoblin of 

810
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:46,601
little minds.
It's like how many of us have a 

811
00:40:46,601 --> 00:40:47,420
completely consistent set of ideas and 
so I feel like with them,

812
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:50,970
and there was that big issue were marked
plus came out and sort of said,

813
00:40:50,971 --> 00:40:55,971
well why don't we listen to him?
And there was a big uproar and then he 

814
00:40:55,971 --> 00:40:59,711
apologized.
And I think that's an interesting thing 

815
00:40:59,711 --> 00:40:59,711
to discuss because from my perspective,
your three views,

816
00:40:59,711 --> 00:41:02,750
if you're liberal adventure,
one is that he's an alt right mouse,

817
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,050
which I don't believe.
I don't believe that he's so far.

818
00:41:06,051 --> 00:41:07,660
All right.
I should say fascists.

819
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,240
Nazis.

820
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,060
Yeah.
And that's.

821
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,680
We need to define what the hell the alt 
right is to,

822
00:41:11,681 --> 00:41:13,750
you know,
the old right is basically a cover story

823
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:18,751
for white supremacy and for an f new 
nationalist state and to target 

824
00:41:18,751 --> 00:41:20,050
everybody who's conservative as an 
outright figure,

825
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,090
which is something that's happened to me
repeatedly,

826
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,650
is absolutely counterproductive because

827
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,620
our lectures on your opposition at all,
right?

828
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:32,510
I mean it's very easily disprovable.
But with Ben,

829
00:41:32,511 --> 00:41:35,060
like let's for the sake of argument that
got to here,

830
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:40,780
which I don't believe,
why would you not want to pay attention 

831
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:40,980
or follow him or keep an eye on him or.
No,

832
00:41:40,981 --> 00:41:43,120
what he's saying,
it's not like he's some crack pot,

833
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:48,190
you know,
he's someone who's very influential and 

834
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:48,190
has a lot of followers.
So even if it's the case,

835
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:52,451
which I believe it is,
I don't understand how not paying any 

836
00:41:52,451 --> 00:41:52,960
attention to what's going on with him.
It's helpful.

837
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,050
Um,
you know,

838
00:41:54,051 --> 00:41:55,580
I,
I gotta say one of the highlights,

839
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,960
I think apple and facebook and spotify 
and so forth just made with Alex Jones,

840
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:06,390
you know,
because they think they banned Alex 

841
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:06,390
Jones.
But that isn't what happened.

842
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,970
What happened was they pushed his 
millions of followers underground.

843
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:09,990
That was a very bad idea

844
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:12,090
and they're making a murder out of him.

845
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:16,310
Justifying know he's a little on the 
paranoid side,

846
00:42:16,311 --> 00:42:18,320
let's say is a real conspiracy 
theorists.

847
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:23,620
And the best,
the worst thing you can possibly do to 

848
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,530
someone who's paranoid is to generate a 
conspiracy to take them out.

849
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:27,800
Well,
it is the best thing you can do.

850
00:42:27,801 --> 00:42:32,801
When Alex Jones has said virtually 
nothing that I agree with on any front 

851
00:42:32,801 --> 00:42:34,830
is to give him as much air time and as 
much rope as possible

852
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:40,170
or at least allowing access to that in 
the same way that everyone else has 

853
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:40,170
access to it.
You know,

854
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:42,580
because a guy,
I don't watch Alex Jones,

855
00:42:42,581 --> 00:42:47,581
but there are a number of people on the 
right that I keep an eye on or the 

856
00:42:47,581 --> 00:42:50,371
farther right because I want to see what
they're up to and as soon as that 

857
00:42:50,371 --> 00:42:54,930
becomes impossible,
then you have no idea what those people 

858
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:57,511
are up to and how the hell are you 
supposed to be able to deal with it if 

859
00:42:57,511 --> 00:42:57,511
you can't figure out what it is.

860
00:42:57,511 --> 00:42:59,890
Well worked for not watching it.
Like I'm a big fan.

861
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:04,910
I like I'm,
I'm a big fan of the aspect of the ECLU 

862
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:08,280
was the Skokie,
which was we show up if Nazis want to 

863
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,881
march right.
And we will protect their right to 

864
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:14,110
peacefully march and it's like I have 
people who I despise.

865
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:19,620
It's like get out there and appoint will
be crushed by the free marketplace of 

866
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:22,870
ideas I have not believed,
but you have to allow for it.

867
00:43:22,871 --> 00:43:24,700
And the more that we murder and shut 
down.

868
00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:25,320
Yeah.

869
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:29,810
You don't know how many people were 
watching Alex Jones to keep an eye on.

870
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:31,510
Right?
You know,

871
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,770
I don't imagine it was a tremendous 
number of people,

872
00:43:33,771 --> 00:43:34,900
but it wasn't none.

873
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:40,710
Bryce,
Bryce will love you and I have talked 

874
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:43,731
about this.
One of the highlights of my 

875
00:43:43,731 --> 00:43:43,731
undergraduate years,
um,

876
00:43:43,731 --> 00:43:47,580
was when the bell curve came out and 
there was a debate at the Kennedy Center

877
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:52,050
and Dick Herrnstein,
who I had as a professor had passed away

878
00:43:52,051 --> 00:43:55,590
and Charles Murray was sort of left to 
defend it against Stephen Jay Gould.

879
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,780
And it was a very high level of 
discourse.

880
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:00,780
And Henry Louis Gates gave the 
introduction.

881
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:05,810
Things were very,
very heated on campus because of their 

882
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:06,810
claims about racial differences in Iq.
It was a very flashpoint issue.

883
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:10,710
And skip gates gave a spectacular 
introduction and he said,

884
00:44:10,711 --> 00:44:15,711
look,
there's a lot of sentiments roiling 

885
00:44:15,711 --> 00:44:18,771
around this issue and the best possible 
thing that we can do is to dispute and 

886
00:44:18,771 --> 00:44:23,421
defend and dismissed the aspects of this
that aren't correct here openly and 

887
00:44:23,551 --> 00:44:25,860
publicly.
And there was a big debate.

888
00:44:25,861 --> 00:44:29,910
A lot of the student groups stood up and
walked out after that,

889
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:34,650
intrigued from,
of the amazing intellectual minds,

890
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:35,790
uh,
of,

891
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,690
of,
you know,

892
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:37,560
in the country.

893
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,800
And so I just went down and sat in the 
front row because people that hit it 

894
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,350
piled out,
it's like I wanted to hear the debate,

895
00:44:43,351 --> 00:44:44,750
I want to hear the size from,
from,

896
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:47,280
from all different arenas.
And it was totally,

897
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:51,720
totally captivating,
but his point was once someone's a crack

898
00:44:51,721 --> 00:44:54,880
pot and they don't have any followers 
and it's stupid,

899
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:56,190
racist,
bellowing things,

900
00:44:56,490 --> 00:45:01,490
it's fine to ignore people.
There's a certain point where when it's 

901
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,581
Dick Herrnstein and Charles Murray,
there's a point where that needs to be 

902
00:45:04,581 --> 00:45:08,301
debated publicly and openly.
And the fact that the chair of the 

903
00:45:08,301 --> 00:45:09,120
African American Studies Department was 
advocating for that to me,

904
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:11,310
I thought was really important and 
should be heated.

905
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:16,550
That we need these things,
these debates to be had and the aspects 

906
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:19,641
that are incorrect me to be for a in 
enlightenment way in a very intense and 

907
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,450
pollock.
And so that's something that I've always

908
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:27,070
sort of held to is I don't,
you know,

909
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:32,450
look,
I mean there's also part of this about 

910
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:32,450
sort of a toughness argument.

911
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:34,440
My grandfather went down during the 
civil rights movement.

912
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:38,400
He was a Jewish lawyer from Manhattan 
and went down to the deep south to stick

913
00:45:38,401 --> 00:45:39,690
up for,
uh,

914
00:45:39,691 --> 00:45:44,691
to represent African Americans who've 
been convicted of crimes against white 

915
00:45:44,691 --> 00:45:49,671
women.
There's one case in particular that was 

916
00:45:49,671 --> 00:45:51,411
totally ridiculous and he went down and 
people tried to run his car off a cliff 

917
00:45:51,411 --> 00:45:54,630
and kill him.
And so part of it for me too is like I'm

918
00:45:54,631 --> 00:45:57,960
from La Mindset of light,
tough liberals who want to,

919
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:00,120
who actually can stand up.
We need,

920
00:46:00,121 --> 00:46:03,300
we need people to be toughened on all 
sides of discourse.

921
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:04,700
And I feel like,
you know,

922
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:07,020
when people were burning copies of 
ulysses,

923
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:12,290
I feel like we're supposed to be the 
ones with the fire hose is putting out 

924
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:15,201
the fires were supposed to be the ones 
who can be really tough and standard 

925
00:46:15,201 --> 00:46:15,201
ground.
And if we can't do that,

926
00:46:15,201 --> 00:46:18,540
if we're gonna duck from those fights 
and that hardening of,

927
00:46:18,541 --> 00:46:18,960
uh,
of,

928
00:46:18,961 --> 00:46:19,680
uh,
of,

929
00:46:19,681 --> 00:46:21,480
uh,
sort of intense positive,

930
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,760
I'm really tough version of,
of what the points are that we're 

931
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:26,760
arguing,
then it's not,

932
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,620
it's not a legitimate case.
We need to be.

933
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:33,650
That's what we need.
It's a tough time and we need tough 

934
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:33,650
discourse.

935
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:37,290
Yeah,
well that and that is exactly why you 

936
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:39,091
should seek out the most articulate 
exponents of your have your opponent's 

937
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:39,430
position.
You know,

938
00:46:39,431 --> 00:46:44,431
I just had that experience talking with 
Sam Harris and we talked for 10 hours 

939
00:46:44,431 --> 00:46:45,400
and you know there are things we agree 
about.

940
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:50,550
One of the most fundamental things is 
that both Sam and I are concerned that 

941
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:54,990
our ethical structures,
it would be better if our ethical 

942
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:58,261
structures were grounded in something 
that was self evidently solid and so he 

943
00:46:58,261 --> 00:47:02,071
wants to do that.
He wants to ground ethics in the realm 

944
00:47:02,071 --> 00:47:02,410
of fact and I can.
I can understand that it's.

945
00:47:02,411 --> 00:47:05,890
It's a perfectly valid desire.
I don't believe it's possible in the way

946
00:47:05,891 --> 00:47:08,650
that he sees it as possible and we 
talked about that a lot,

947
00:47:08,651 --> 00:47:13,651
but I learned a tremendous amount as a 
consequence of discussing things with 

948
00:47:13,651 --> 00:47:16,420
him over a 10 hour period because he 
pushed me.

949
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,270
You need to be pushed,
man,

950
00:47:19,271 --> 00:47:24,271
because all the kinds of holes and you 
need to go in understanding that you 

951
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:25,700
might not have all the answers

952
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,420
well,
but you don't have all the answers.

953
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:34,050
What I think is interesting is your 
approach to that is to ground things in 

954
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:35,470
an evolutionary model,
which I think is a pretty good bedrock,

955
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:38,200
right?
I mean that's been your sort of approach

956
00:47:38,201 --> 00:47:43,000
to this is to talk about like a sort of 
archetypal and evolutionary underlay,

957
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,240
but Sam's unbelievably articulate and 
sharp.

958
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,370
I mean,
I had the pleasure of having dinner with

959
00:47:48,371 --> 00:47:52,240
you and him and Douglas Murray in London
and it's a vibrant,

960
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:57,390
respectful,
sometimes disagreeable mode of 

961
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:58,060
conversation that's incredibly fruitful.

962
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:01,550
It's also stressful as hell,
you know,

963
00:48:01,551 --> 00:48:06,551
because you can definitely get put on 
the spot and have your cherished 

964
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:09,510
assumptions undermined as well as look 
like a fool because you know,

965
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:12,650
some of the time,
even if you have an argument,

966
00:48:12,651 --> 00:48:15,020
well thought through in that kind of 
discourse,

967
00:48:15,021 --> 00:48:17,690
you don't have it immediately at hand.
You forget about it.

968
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:22,580
And then it appear as if you're a fool.
And so you put a lot on the line and the

969
00:48:22,581 --> 00:48:23,600
discussion like that,
but

970
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,690
no one's paying attention to any of this
for you to.

971
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:31,960
Right.
So,

972
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:33,580
so.
Well.

973
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:36,310
So one quick thing before we move on 
with this.

974
00:48:36,311 --> 00:48:40,270
So there's a lot of proposals that are 
there that are floated.

975
00:48:40,271 --> 00:48:45,271
Let's say there's an economic idea that 
somebody has in that wants to be passed 

976
00:48:45,281 --> 00:48:50,281
on.
The first thing that I do with it is I 

977
00:48:50,281 --> 00:48:52,711
send it to.
I have a friend who's a really sharp 

978
00:48:52,711 --> 00:48:52,840
libertarian.
I have a friend who's a hardcore kind of

979
00:48:52,841 --> 00:48:57,670
Wall Street Republican and I have 
another friend who's kind of a big money

980
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:02,730
person.
So they represent sort of the different 

981
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:04,831
poles of economic policy from the things
that some of the policies that might be 

982
00:49:04,831 --> 00:49:09,750
interesting to me.
The first thing they do is send it to 

983
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,821
all of them and go poke as many holes in
this as you possibly can and tell me 

984
00:49:11,821 --> 00:49:11,821
what all blind spots.

985
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:15,220
And that's not only for me to cover all 
those arguments.

986
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:18,520
It's also for me to be able to learn and
see if there's a better approach to it.

987
00:49:18,521 --> 00:49:23,521
If it's fundamentally flawed,
and then certainly if I'm going to 

988
00:49:23,521 --> 00:49:24,970
advocate something that's a new policy,
I'm not strong on economics.

989
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:28,740
I mean it's probably my weakest spot,
but it's the sort of know if we're going

990
00:49:28,741 --> 00:49:33,741
to advocate it,
what are all the pitfalls were falling 

991
00:49:33,741 --> 00:49:33,741
into and what are we potentially 
missing?

992
00:49:33,741 --> 00:49:38,370
And I find very few people are taking an
approach like this and there's one of 

993
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:41,761
the things that I think is exciting.
It's funny with the idw has this sort 

994
00:49:41,761 --> 00:49:41,761
of,
um,

995
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:47,250
fear of an alt right overlay,
but the majority of guys skew pretty 

996
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:47,250
liberal.
I mean,

997
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:49,060
if you look at Joe,
if you look at Dave's certainly,

998
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:51,160
um,
if you look at Eric and Brad,

999
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:56,220
I mean it's got more of a skew,
but what's nice is ideas can be parsed 

1000
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:58,570
in a way where as much as it is 
embarrassing when you're put on the spot

1001
00:49:58,571 --> 00:50:01,390
and you're wrong,
no one's looking at twists the knife.

1002
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:03,610
You know what I mean?
Everyone's kind of saying,

1003
00:50:03,611 --> 00:50:04,900
yeah,
I disagree with this.

1004
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:07,420
[inaudible] disagree.
Have a tie disagreeableness,

1005
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,830
but it's recycled.
Well,

1006
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:08,990
it's

1007
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:11,910
also based,
at least to some degree on trust.

1008
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:17,360
You know,
if I can assume that you're different 

1009
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:17,360
than me,
temperamentally,

1010
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:21,080
but that you're actually striving 
towards the truth and we can have a 

1011
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:21,300
discussion and I certainly feel that 
with Sam.

1012
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:23,580
Yes.
I believe that.

1013
00:50:23,581 --> 00:50:27,710
I believe.
I believe that he's an honest person and

1014
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:30,560
you know,
or I believe that he's dishonest as me,

1015
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:35,800
let's say,
which is more to the point because well 

1016
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,611
maybe an honest person is too high a 
barrier for anyone to actually achieve 

1017
00:50:39,611 --> 00:50:41,540
given all of our faults,
but I don't believe there's any evidence

1018
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:45,380
that he's striving with less intensity 
towards the truth than I am.

1019
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:51,080
The furthest right in the group is 
clearly bad.

1020
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:52,790
You know,
when to get back to that point.

1021
00:50:52,791 --> 00:50:57,791
It's like there's sort of three 
approaches is a horrible human and he's 

1022
00:50:57,791 --> 00:51:01,780
a hardcore old writer,
in which case if you believe that why 

1023
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:02,480
from a Sun Tzu perspective,
art of war,

1024
00:51:02,481 --> 00:51:04,370
would you not want to know your enemy 
and figure it out?

1025
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,850
Or He's somebody who has views and 
ideologies.

1026
00:51:07,851 --> 00:51:09,100
I disagreed with him on a,
on a,

1027
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:14,130
on a number of fronts,
but he's somebody who is it who is 

1028
00:51:14,130 --> 00:51:18,320
interested in the truth and is willing 
to admit when he has gone too far or not

1029
00:51:18,321 --> 00:51:19,640
gone too far.
That's the wrong phrase.

1030
00:51:19,641 --> 00:51:24,641
He's willing to admit mistakes that he 
perceives that he's nate and is also 

1031
00:51:24,641 --> 00:51:28,930
taking new information and it's like I'd
love to actually have a discussion with 

1032
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:29,480
him about something,
a discussion,

1033
00:51:29,481 --> 00:51:31,440
not a debate because he's a world class 
innovator.

1034
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:36,470
He would probably biliterate me but,
but an actual meaningful discussion 

1035
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:37,460
about some of the stuff where I see 
there to be differences.

1036
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:40,540
He's,
I think he might be in for that.

1037
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:45,570
Like you and I have discussed the 
possibility of finding high resolution 

1038
00:51:46,211 --> 00:51:51,211
intelligent centrist Democrats and 
getting some of these idw people to 

1039
00:51:51,211 --> 00:51:51,790
interact with them.
So,

1040
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:57,080
you know,
that looks like it's a real possibility 

1041
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:57,080
and be interesting to see what that 
would do to the political discourse.

1042
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,710
And I guess this is a step on that step 
in that direction.

1043
00:51:59,711 --> 00:52:04,711
I talked to Bandon,
to Dave Rubin and to show our,

1044
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:08,440
or to um,
to Sam and uh,

1045
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:11,030
you know,
hypothetically there,

1046
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:16,060
there are at least willing to look into 
this as a possibility and it would be 

1047
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:16,060
very interesting as well.

1048
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:18,740
Oh,
well,

1049
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:23,820
it would also be very interesting to see
how this would play out with regards to 

1050
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,150
log form discourse because we need to 
find politicians.

1051
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,640
You know,
one of the things Joe told me when I was

1052
00:52:27,641 --> 00:52:28,570
talking to him,
Joe,

1053
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:33,600
Joe Rogan,
when I was talking to him about his 

1054
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:33,600
three hour interviews,
I said,

1055
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:33,940
well,
does that ever not work out for people?

1056
00:52:33,941 --> 00:52:34,750
And he says,
well yeah,

1057
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:37,900
I've had guests on who just run out of 
steam in about 45 minutes.

1058
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:43,870
They don't have anything else to say.
And we don't need politicians who run 

1059
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:45,820
out of steam at 45 minutes.
We need people who can engage in intense

1060
00:52:45,821 --> 00:52:48,340
discussion for three hours without 
running out of detail,

1061
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,540
without running out of ideas,
a detailed grasp of the political realm.

1062
00:52:52,541 --> 00:52:57,541
And we need to be able to see that.
So we could move away from these six 

1063
00:52:57,541 --> 00:52:57,940
minute CNN interviews and

1064
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:00,770
yeah,
it's moving away from the tweets and the

1065
00:53:00,771 --> 00:53:05,771
nonsense,
which to my mind is inherently 

1066
00:53:05,771 --> 00:53:05,771
polarizing.
It's like,

1067
00:53:05,771 --> 00:53:09,671
look at what this asshole hardcore lefty
get on a college campus or look at this 

1068
00:53:10,671 --> 00:53:15,671
most egregious example of something over
here and I'm not saying those things 

1069
00:53:15,671 --> 00:53:16,430
aren't important or that we don't have 
to pay attention to them,

1070
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:21,940
but the vast majority of people in 
America right now me real nuts and bolts

1071
00:53:22,131 --> 00:53:25,840
solutions and corruption.
Maybe

1072
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:30,980
there's a technological rule here,
so imagine that this is like we could 

1073
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:34,380
call this the Peterson principle.
Let's say the narrower the bandwidth,

1074
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:37,290
the more likely polarized information 
will be delivered over it.

1075
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:42,960
I think it's great,
but I think we should call it the 

1076
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:42,960
principal.

1077
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:45,260
You'll have to come up with a more 
elegant formulation,

1078
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:49,310
but it seems to me that that's highly 
probable because if you have to compress

1079
00:53:49,311 --> 00:53:54,100
complex information into a very narrow 
channel and and broadcast tv would would

1080
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:57,380
certainly qualify.
And twitter of course even worse is that

1081
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,560
you have to.
You have to radically oversimplify it,

1082
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:05,500
right?
Because like I said,

1083
00:54:05,501 --> 00:54:10,501
I a lot of friends,
I mean across the gamut of political 

1084
00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:11,700
orientations,
I read a lot of news and follow a lot of

1085
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:16,710
people across the political orientation 
all the way left to right or right or 

1086
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:22,171
very far left,
but I'm talking about within a 

1087
00:54:22,171 --> 00:54:23,770
reasonable poles and it's,
it's just,

1088
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:28,830
it's amazing to me how skewed it is.
If you turn on MSNBC and Fox News,

1089
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:34,460
we're in two different worlds.
If you read the Huffington post and 

1090
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:34,460
drudge report and so it's very easy to 
get.

1091
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:39,540
Like I think I have more of awareness of
what the triggers are for conservatives 

1092
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:44,820
and what the triggers are for liberals,
but also the fact that these triggers 

1093
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,530
are getting this outsize era time 
constantly.

1094
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:52,640
Bio is condensed means of information 
and I think that's where like the IB 

1095
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,140
dealt with you like there.
There's way more listeners to.

1096
00:54:56,141 --> 00:55:00,240
You guys didn't make any fucking sense 
like the fact that you had 10,

1097
00:55:00,250 --> 00:55:03,400
two and a half hour lectures from the 
psychological underpinnings of the Bible

1098
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:06,670
and that more than two people watch.
That makes no sense.

1099
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:12,060
And so there's a ton of people who are 
really curious for more in depth 

1100
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:15,391
analysis is being met elsewhere and I 
think that's where the polls have been 

1101
00:55:15,391 --> 00:55:18,991
missing.
I think that that proverbial proverbial 

1102
00:55:18,991 --> 00:55:22,081
lead a group of people who are,
who are being missed and you aren't 

1103
00:55:22,081 --> 00:55:22,081
being discounted.

1104
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:22,790
Yeah.
And

1105
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:28,820
you know it's,
it's really important that we have the 

1106
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:28,820
more in depth conversations about it.

1107
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:34,220
So that's our little conspiracy plant,
so to speak then is to take this to,

1108
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:41,820
to,
to inquire if the people who've been 

1109
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:44,481
loosely grouped together as the idw are 
willing to engage in serious discourse 

1110
00:55:44,821 --> 00:55:47,370
with to begin with,
with centrist Democrats.

1111
00:55:47,371 --> 00:55:52,371
Doesn't have to be limited to that,
but I think that's a nice counter play 

1112
00:55:52,371 --> 00:55:52,371
to.

1113
00:55:52,371 --> 00:55:56,160
For me,
it can even be Democrats who aren't 

1114
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,651
centrist or tilting even left of that,
who are willing to engage in civil 

1115
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:04,650
discourse and might even have like 
different districts and states have 

1116
00:56:04,650 --> 00:56:07,360
different notions and it might really 
make sense for an aspect of the party of

1117
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:12,450
further lab to test something in San 
Francisco or New York and see what new 

1118
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:12,670
ideas come out of this.
Right?

1119
00:56:12,671 --> 00:56:16,030
It's just for me,
it can't be with moral condescension and

1120
00:56:16,031 --> 00:56:17,680
it can't be a purity tests,
you know,

1121
00:56:17,681 --> 00:56:22,681
you and I've talked so much about how 
the left and the right get off track in 

1122
00:56:22,681 --> 00:56:23,260
different ways.
The right gets very fascist.

1123
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:26,140
You see them coming and it's,
it's,

1124
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:27,820
you know,
fascistic overlay.

1125
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:29,500
We know what that is.
Historically,

1126
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:34,770
it's,
we'll go heavily towards voter 

1127
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:36,571
suppression.
There's a lot of issues that are very 

1128
00:56:36,571 --> 00:56:38,521
highly problematic on that side of the 
fence and when it gets so ethnocentric.

1129
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,020
Exactly.
Or your sense,

1130
00:56:41,021 --> 00:56:41,700
right?
Yep.

1131
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:43,090
Yeah.
And you know,

1132
00:56:43,091 --> 00:56:44,290
or,
or you know,

1133
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:48,490
illegal or hardcore power grounding in a
way that's effective,

1134
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:50,440
let's say.
And with the left,

1135
00:56:50,441 --> 00:56:51,290
the left,
you know,

1136
00:56:51,291 --> 00:56:55,150
cannibalizes and its purity tests and it
goes kind of crazy that way.

1137
00:56:55,480 --> 00:57:00,480
I think that we are seeing from the 
Democrats now and awareness that the 

1138
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,320
real solutions need to be offered again.
Anticorruption is a huge thing that I'm 

1139
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,860
seeing Democrats start to tackle in a 
very serious way.

1140
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:07,450
Healthcare jobs,
education.

1141
00:57:08,110 --> 00:57:10,600
And it's really important that these 
things get brought out.

1142
00:57:10,601 --> 00:57:15,601
And so for me,
it's like we can test things that are 

1143
00:57:15,601 --> 00:57:16,510
further or further left and see it work 
or don't work,

1144
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:22,370
but we also need to do that from a 
position that isn't morally 

1145
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:25,111
condescending and a position that's also
appreciative of different cultures and 

1146
00:57:25,111 --> 00:57:25,111
different places around the country.

1147
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:30,420
What's going to work in up in New York 
isn't going to work in Alabama and 

1148
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:34,411
liberals are so good at.
I think it understanding and 

1149
00:57:34,411 --> 00:57:35,290
appreciating other cultures,
you know,

1150
00:57:35,291 --> 00:57:38,470
like it's one of the things that is sort
of a trademark.

1151
00:57:38,471 --> 00:57:43,471
But it's interesting to me that,
that I think we have fallen down on our 

1152
00:57:43,471 --> 00:57:44,020
understanding of different cultures 
within the United States.

1153
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:46,450
And so it's this very interesting 
divide.

1154
00:57:46,451 --> 00:57:48,790
But like if it's foreign or perceived as
exotic,

1155
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:53,850
it's all good.
But like we need a better understanding 

1156
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:53,850
of certain cultures.
Also.

1157
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:54,820
Um,
you know,

1158
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:56,290
Alabama,
Texas,

1159
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:59,680
certainly as guilty of this too.
I mean the right treats.

1160
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:03,440
Chicago is if it's some like horrible,
you know,

1161
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,530
no man's land.
I'm not saying this is a problem,

1162
00:58:05,531 --> 00:58:10,531
only your belief.
But I'm saying we could really benefit 

1163
00:58:10,531 --> 00:58:10,840
with conversations and talking to a lot 
of candidates in Oklahoma,

1164
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:16,260
in Orange County,
in Texas who have an understanding of 

1165
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:20,161
their constituents and what they want to
do is help them and to present a 

1166
00:58:20,161 --> 00:58:23,641
reasonable alternative solutions to them
about real issues and not the bullshit 

1167
00:58:23,641 --> 00:58:24,130
that everybody is engaging.

1168
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:26,980
It's absolutely essential.
And if we,

1169
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:29,500
if we offer all that and lose,
then tough luck.

1170
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:31,800
We've got to make a better case.
We've got to make a better argument.

1171
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:36,800
Like we screwed up.
We got to try harder and that way.

1172
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:37,720
The other thing,
Jordan,

1173
00:58:37,721 --> 00:58:42,721
that's really heartening.
I'm seeing a lot of the actual 

1174
00:58:42,721 --> 00:58:45,541
candidates as opposed to the noise,
is more and more of an emphasis on 

1175
00:58:45,541 --> 00:58:46,150
personal accountability.
You know,

1176
00:58:46,151 --> 00:58:51,151
it's,
it's about helping people and creating 

1177
00:58:51,151 --> 00:58:52,660
new opportunities for them economically,
but in a way that empowers them with the

1178
00:58:52,661 --> 00:58:57,340
freedom to sort of make their life or 
make their mark if that's a freedom that

1179
00:58:57,341 --> 00:59:02,341
they can see.
It's about sort of trying to level a 

1180
00:59:02,341 --> 00:59:04,901
baseline.
Like we talked about how healthcare can 

1181
00:59:04,901 --> 00:59:04,901
be super helpful for business and for 
entrepreneurial ventures.

1182
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:08,680
We talked about why it's essential for 
the robustness of communities,

1183
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:13,240
but it's about setting the terms under 
which people can be free to make choices

1184
00:59:13,241 --> 00:59:17,290
and to perform at a level that they want
to to build their whole future.

1185
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:22,320
So it's not that it's a shift from sort 
of us running ahead and and blocks for 

1186
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:26,681
people to us trying to lift the 
constraint so that people can have 

1187
00:59:26,681 --> 00:59:28,280
better choices for their,
for their families,

1188
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:33,310
for their kids and their education 
system for their own work so that they 

1189
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:35,270
can do better and make their own mark 
and because a lot of what we're standing

1190
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:40,271
on,
a lot of the successes that we're 

1191
00:59:40,271 --> 00:59:40,271
standing on as a country are on the 
shoulders of working men and women.

1192
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:45,850
That's a lot of what's accounted for.
The things that we've done well and in 

1193
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:45,850
fact a lot of the world,
frankly.

1194
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:50,740
A lot of the world is benefited 
enormously from the working people in 

1195
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:51,810
United States.
You know,

1196
00:59:51,811 --> 00:59:54,230
in a way that I don't think gets nearly 
enough recognition.

1197
00:59:54,231 --> 00:59:54,690
And so we

1198
00:59:55,600 --> 01:00:00,600
see the,
the accruing financial success of the 

1199
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:04,811
poor around the world.
Which is happening at a very rapid rate 

1200
01:00:04,811 --> 01:00:08,110
is in part a consequence of the 
sacrifice is made either willingly or 

1201
01:00:09,381 --> 01:00:12,500
unwillingly by the American working 
class over the last 30 years.

1202
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:14,180
Absolutely.
Working class,

1203
01:00:14,181 --> 01:00:18,410
that's it.
It's competition with the world has been

1204
01:00:18,411 --> 01:00:22,790
opened up at the level of the working 
class first and that's been unbelievably

1205
01:00:22,791 --> 01:00:27,791
beneficial to the rest of the world and 
probably a pretty good medium to 

1206
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:27,791
longterm strategy because

1207
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:32,860
the American working class,
it's like they have been built after the

1208
01:00:33,441 --> 01:00:36,500
winds for people around the globe,
like their heroes.

1209
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:41,540
There's no,
there's no infantilizing of them in a 

1210
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:44,951
way that's derogatory and it's like it's
our job to make sure that they can have 

1211
01:00:44,951 --> 01:00:45,570
choices for their future,
that they.

1212
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:50,590
That they are free to compete,
at least with the same rules that 

1213
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:52,460
everybody else competes to differentiate
themselves because they've always kicked

1214
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:54,710
mentioned.
It's an amazing,

1215
01:00:54,711 --> 01:00:59,711
amazing workforce and they've always 
done well and it's like if people are 

1216
01:00:59,711 --> 01:00:59,930
complaining about,
you know,

1217
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:04,990
entitlements,
it's like we can also what your 

1218
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:07,331
corporate subsidies.
It's like it's not about one or the 

1219
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:11,111
other.
It's about the same rules that people 

1220
01:01:11,111 --> 01:01:13,031
need to differentiate themselves and 
it's about creating more freedom for 

1221
01:01:13,031 --> 01:01:13,031
them to reach their accomplishments.

1222
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:18,200
It seems to me that the Democrats would 
have a lot more success and and and also

1223
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:23,640
be able to generate a counter narrative 
to the radicals on the left if they made

1224
01:01:23,641 --> 01:01:28,641
the assumption that there's all sorts of
good things about free market 

1225
01:01:28,641 --> 01:01:32,391
capitalism,
but crony capitalism is not one of them 

1226
01:01:32,391 --> 01:01:36,160
now and that's part of your emphasis on,
let's call it a regulation of 

1227
01:01:38,041 --> 01:01:40,890
corruption,
so the free enterprise system works real

1228
01:01:40,891 --> 01:01:45,891
well except when it gets warped and 
twisted and so we have to remove the 

1229
01:01:45,891 --> 01:01:49,311
warping and twisting so that people do 
have the opportunity to compete and to 

1230
01:01:49,311 --> 01:01:50,850
cooperate as freely as possible and 
that's in everyone's interests,

1231
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:56,150
including radical capitalists because to
the degree that the system is corrupt 

1232
01:01:56,150 --> 01:02:00,921
and that reflects badly on the system 
and produces a tremendous amount of 

1233
01:02:00,921 --> 01:02:00,921
opposition towards it.

1234
01:02:03,870 --> 01:02:07,030
If you can't win fairly,
what are you doing in the game?

1235
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:10,390
Like it's to me,
it's a very tough argument.

1236
01:02:10,391 --> 01:02:13,440
That's like if you can't sign a pledge,
which,

1237
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:16,210
which has been put forth,
it's called the disclose act.

1238
01:02:16,211 --> 01:02:18,790
There's a number of variations of it.
It's no dark money,

1239
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:23,990
you know,
it's a strong stance against 

1240
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:25,800
interference by hostile actors.
It's no voter suppression.

1241
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:30,060
It's getting universal healthcare,
universal voter registration.

1242
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:32,940
There's a lot of stuff of like,
let's get everybody out voting,

1243
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:35,550
let's lift the suppression and voter 
intimidation,

1244
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:40,880
and then when fair square and it's like,
for me it's like I want the right to 

1245
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,800
Wayne fairly and I want the right to 
lose fairly if we make a better argument

1246
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:45,250
than let's do it,
but you know,

1247
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:50,270
it's also anti gerrymandering which is 
really good and there's a lot of people 

1248
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:53,991
who vow to not participate in 
gerrymandering and to also have it be 

1249
01:02:53,991 --> 01:02:56,470
eager bipartisan committees or judges 
who determine the boundaries.

1250
01:02:56,910 --> 01:03:01,910
It's really,
it's really quite an outrage that it's 

1251
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:01,910
not bipartisan committees.

1252
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:03,380
It's ridiculous onto,
you know,

1253
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:08,410
into a boxing ring and tell,
telling someone that we're going to 

1254
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:10,601
fight them,
but they can only step in certain areas 

1255
01:03:10,601 --> 01:03:10,601
that you can go anywhere and they can 
only hit you with the jab,

1256
01:03:10,601 --> 01:03:11,960
but you get to use your full battery 
shots.

1257
01:03:11,961 --> 01:03:16,961
It's like man up,
right step into the arena if you think 

1258
01:03:16,961 --> 01:03:17,890
you can wane and wind fair and square 
and there's a.

1259
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:23,070
there's a big emphasis,
I think it's not getting enough press 

1260
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:26,171
and Democrats cleaning up our side of 
the aisle in a way that is accountable 

1261
01:03:26,571 --> 01:03:31,571
and that is going to be clear and if 
there's nobody who disagree with that,

1262
01:03:32,481 --> 01:03:35,540
I believe if you're a heart,
you're a republican and you want to,

1263
01:03:35,541 --> 01:03:40,541
when you should be aware that you can 
win fairly and under the same rules and 

1264
01:03:40,541 --> 01:03:40,970
that we can all agree on that.

1265
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:46,660
Yup.
Well it would be nice if the Democrats 

1266
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:49,410
too could help everyone figuring out 
figuring out what the problems actually 

1267
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:53,821
are.
Because right now mostly what we see in 

1268
01:03:53,821 --> 01:03:54,640
the media is a discussion of pseudo 
problems.

1269
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,650
Exactly.
And so I'd like to see what,

1270
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:02,720
what are the,
what are the real challenges that 

1271
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:06,271
confront us at the moment and what are 
the proper solutions to those 

1272
01:04:06,271 --> 01:04:06,271
challenges?

1273
01:04:06,271 --> 01:04:06,930
Yeah.
It's so funny because I feel like the,

1274
01:04:06,931 --> 01:04:11,931
the racial discourse,
a discourse around racism has gotten so 

1275
01:04:12,051 --> 01:04:15,300
loaded and so complicated,
um,

1276
01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:19,400
since president trump has is run or has 
taken office and it's,

1277
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:24,590
I feel like all sides of the issue are,
there is nowhere you can stop without 

1278
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:27,110
being a landline.
And for me it's really important to boil

1279
01:04:27,111 --> 01:04:32,111
down to.
I went with a program called the five 

1280
01:04:32,111 --> 01:04:34,910
that goes and runs an entrepreneurial 
program in the prison system and it's 

1281
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:41,860
absolutely unbelievable how,
you know what I call the prison 

1282
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:44,210
industrial complex works,
the privatization of prisons.

1283
01:04:44,211 --> 01:04:49,211
And you can sidestep all the arguments 
about who's doing what and who's 

1284
01:04:49,211 --> 01:04:50,100
responsible.
African-Americans,

1285
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:55,360
if you know who are up for drug charges,
the exact same drug charges as whites or

1286
01:04:56,091 --> 01:04:59,280
600 percent more likely to get like 
that.

1287
01:04:59,281 --> 01:05:01,130
Just straight Scott.
That's not well,

1288
01:05:01,131 --> 01:05:03,350
they're doing more crime.
There's no argument to be had about that

1289
01:05:03,690 --> 01:05:07,190
there.
There are certain unbelievable biases of

1290
01:05:07,191 --> 01:05:08,150
how,
you know,

1291
01:05:08,151 --> 01:05:11,480
African Americans and people of color 
are put into prison system,

1292
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:16,510
which profits from them and which 
they're doing a lot of work and 

1293
01:05:16,510 --> 01:05:17,150
basically you know,
no wages.

1294
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:18,120
It's very

1295
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:21,030
problematic.
Anybody would agree with that across the

1296
01:05:21,031 --> 01:05:23,520
spectrum.
I think if you look at those numbers and

1297
01:05:23,521 --> 01:05:25,310
it's patently unfair if there's one 
thing

1298
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:30,570
we need to have an intelligent 
discussion about drug policy that would 

1299
01:05:30,570 --> 01:05:30,570
be a real scary,

1300
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:35,850
the prison system and who exude towards 
and the ways in which it is unfairly 

1301
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:38,830
implemented and that's a no shit major 
crawl.

1302
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:43,920
And if you,
if you discussed the actual hardcore 

1303
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,070
facts and if you could boil it down to 
those things,

1304
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:46,660
no one's going to disagree with that.

1305
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:50,110
You know what Bjorn Lomborg did.
This is really interesting.

1306
01:05:50,111 --> 01:05:51,880
He's a,
he's a scandinavian.

1307
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,270
You used to be an environmentalist.
He still is,

1308
01:05:55,271 --> 01:06:00,271
but he calls himself the skeptical 
environmentalist now and I really liked 

1309
01:06:00,271 --> 01:06:03,121
your Lumberg.
He wrote a great book called how to 

1310
01:06:03,121 --> 01:06:05,761
spend $50,
million and then a few laters years 

1311
01:06:05,761 --> 01:06:08,790
later,
75 billion to make the world a better 

1312
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:08,790
place.
A book,

1313
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:11,851
I would highly recommend it.
This is what he did and this is really 

1314
01:06:11,851 --> 01:06:11,851
nice procedural,
um,

1315
01:06:11,851 --> 01:06:14,680
achievement.
He looked at the UN.

1316
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:17,140
I hope I got the story right.
It's a while since I,

1317
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:22,350
since I read it over,
the UN puts out a lot of development 

1318
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:22,350
goals.
Say like,

1319
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:24,340
I think they have 150 development goals,
something like that.

1320
01:06:24,341 --> 01:06:27,520
And that's too many goals.
You can't do 150 things.

1321
01:06:27,770 --> 01:06:32,770
And I worked on a UN committee for 
awhile and we were trying to prioritize 

1322
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:34,450
the goals because you'd have to 
prioritize things in order to accomplish

1323
01:06:34,451 --> 01:06:34,600
them.

1324
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:39,600
And one of the things we discovered was 
that you couldn't prioritize the goals 

1325
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,760
because every goal had its constituents 
and they were outraged if any other goal

1326
01:06:42,761 --> 01:06:46,840
was prioritized over there.
And that was a terrible thing because,

1327
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:51,890
well that's the tragedy of the Commons 
because the goal is couldn't be 

1328
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:54,571
prioritized and they couldn't be.
They couldn't be accomplished 

1329
01:06:54,571 --> 01:06:58,260
essentially.
So lumberg figured out a way around 

1330
01:06:58,260 --> 01:06:58,260
this.
So his idea was this,

1331
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:03,630
okay.
So there's a bunch of things that need 

1332
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:06,151
to be done because there's a bunch of 
problems out there in the world and but 

1333
01:07:06,151 --> 01:07:06,760
there's too many to simultaneously 
address.

1334
01:07:06,761 --> 01:07:08,470
So we have to figure out where we're 
going to start.

1335
01:07:08,471 --> 01:07:10,780
So what we're going to do is a cost 
benefit analysis.

1336
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:16,140
So we're going to concentrate on doing 
as much good for the least amount of 

1337
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:20,161
money as we can.
Now it's going to be our initial 

1338
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:20,170
strategy because why not right?

1339
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:26,040
Because money is a scarce resource and 
it involves human labor and human 

1340
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,010
intelligence and all of that and so you 
don't want to waste it.

1341
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:31,210
But he didn't believe that he would be 
capable of doing the prioritization.

1342
01:07:31,211 --> 01:07:34,300
So what he did was get 10 teams of 
economists together,

1343
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:36,970
some of which were headed by world class
economist.

1344
01:07:36,971 --> 01:07:41,971
People have won Nobel Prize and he had 
them organized teams and then he had 

1345
01:07:41,971 --> 01:07:44,710
them go through the development goals 
and prioritize them and make an economic

1346
01:07:44,711 --> 01:07:49,711
case.
And so then you had 10 separate cases 

1347
01:07:49,711 --> 01:07:49,711
and heres the rule.
You've got $50,

1348
01:07:49,711 --> 01:07:52,090
million dollars.
You can spend it on whatever you want,

1349
01:07:52,091 --> 01:07:54,850
but you have to justify it in terms of 
cost benefit analysis,

1350
01:07:54,851 --> 01:07:59,851
Naf to choose from this list,
and so then he got each economist to 

1351
01:07:59,851 --> 01:08:03,211
generate a list of their priorities.
Then he averaged across the lists and 

1352
01:08:03,211 --> 01:08:05,470
came up with a final list of have both 
problems,

1353
01:08:05,471 --> 01:08:06,550
which is a big deal,
right?

1354
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:10,330
Because the first issue is what are the 
problems that we need to solve?

1355
01:08:11,350 --> 01:08:12,430
Like you know,
you might think,

1356
01:08:12,431 --> 01:08:17,431
well,
what politicians should be generating 

1357
01:08:17,431 --> 01:08:17,431
his answers.
It's like,

1358
01:08:17,431 --> 01:08:17,431
no,
no,

1359
01:08:17,431 --> 01:08:17,431
no,
that's not right.

1360
01:08:17,431 --> 01:08:19,010
If you're trying to solve a complex 
problem,

1361
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:24,130
instead of the complex problems,
the first thing you want to do is 

1362
01:08:24,130 --> 01:08:26,471
formulate the problems property and then
you work towards towards defining what 

1363
01:08:26,471 --> 01:08:31,181
the solutions might be.
So be really interesting to see if we 

1364
01:08:31,181 --> 01:08:32,330
could have an intelligent political 
conversation that would concentrate on,

1365
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:37,570
on defining what the actual problems are
and it's not capitalism versus 

1366
01:08:37,570 --> 01:08:39,800
socialism.
That's not a problem.

1367
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:45,070
That's awesome.
Everyone gets to scream at each other 

1368
01:08:45,070 --> 01:08:47,000
and then the superior and get it 
immersed and getting retweets

1369
01:08:47,710 --> 01:08:49,720
without having to know anything about 
anything.

1370
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:52,440
Right,
and there's no actual motivation towards

1371
01:08:52,441 --> 01:08:56,190
trying to come up with solutions to the 
vast majority of people who have,

1372
01:08:56,220 --> 01:09:01,220
who are dealing with real problems and 
that's the part that pisses me off is 

1373
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:04,770
it's like it's this masturbatory venture
of discussing the overall culture and 

1374
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:05,550
you know,
if you turn on the news,

1375
01:09:05,610 --> 01:09:08,370
it's these little sound bites of the 
most,

1376
01:09:08,390 --> 01:09:13,390
you know,
sort of tabloid nature of the furthest 

1377
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:16,431
extreme sense versus nuts and bolts 
discussions of what actually makes 

1378
01:09:16,431 --> 01:09:16,431
sense.

1379
01:09:16,431 --> 01:09:16,500
Okay.
So what we need to do,

1380
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:21,980
let's say generally speaking,
is we've got to figure out what the 

1381
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:21,980
problem started.
Like what,

1382
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:25,401
what are the,
what are the most serious problems that 

1383
01:09:25,401 --> 01:09:25,590
currently confront us as a society.
That would be a nice start.

1384
01:09:25,591 --> 01:09:30,591
Like what are the 15 most most crucial 
problems that confront us as we move 

1385
01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:33,810
farther into the 21st century?
That's a hard.

1386
01:09:33,870 --> 01:09:38,870
That's a hard question and then I'm a 
go.

1387
01:09:39,181 --> 01:09:39,750
No,
go ahead.

1388
01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:41,530
Well,
I mean the first thing for me,

1389
01:09:41,531 --> 01:09:45,160
looking at the system as political 
corruption and I'm not eating that,

1390
01:09:45,161 --> 01:09:45,710
it,
it,

1391
01:09:45,711 --> 01:09:47,440
it either party.
I mean,

1392
01:09:47,441 --> 01:09:52,441
I have my opinions about which party 
does that more but neither one is 

1393
01:09:52,441 --> 01:09:54,880
perfect and the average rating of 
Congress right now is 15 percent.

1394
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:58,330
I'm sorry,
18 percent is the providing of Congress,

1395
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,940
which is better or works as a slightly 
about syphilis.

1396
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:06,600
It Ain't good and if you don't believe 
that the people in government are 

1397
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:10,261
serving your needs and are are instead,
you know more interested in furthering 

1398
01:10:10,261 --> 01:10:13,780
the big money donors over the interests 
of people which has proven time and time

1399
01:10:13,781 --> 01:10:18,781
again.
That's a huge problem with trust is 

1400
01:10:18,781 --> 01:10:20,380
eroded that the people representing you 
are representing rich donors rather than

1401
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:22,900
average Americans didn't seem to your 
needs.

1402
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:28,080
You can't get anywhere.
And I think that's part of what's 

1403
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:28,900
important and all those flags that 
allowed Democrats are working on.

1404
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:31,450
It's not.
It's a pledge to say here's what we,

1405
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:36,600
here's what we will disclose and here's 
ways that we will clean up our side of 

1406
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,750
the island.
And I think if it's essential,

1407
01:10:37,751 --> 01:10:41,980
it's essential that you start with your 
own reflection of fixing the things that

1408
01:10:41,981 --> 01:10:43,810
you need to fix in order to make a 
better argument.

1409
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:49,170
For me,
corruption and governments and top of 

1410
01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:49,170
this year.

1411
01:10:49,170 --> 01:10:53,330
But go ahead.
I was thinking more of a procedurally 

1412
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:58,380
no,
not so much in terms of what the 

1413
01:10:58,380 --> 01:10:58,380
problems might be.
I mean,

1414
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:01,700
one of the problems I see emerging,
well one of them would be this increase 

1415
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:02,940
in political polarization,
which I think is very,

1416
01:11:02,941 --> 01:11:06,000
very dangerous.
I think another potential problem on the

1417
01:11:06,001 --> 01:11:10,710
horizon is something like as our society
becomes more cognitively complex,

1418
01:11:10,711 --> 01:11:12,420
which is happening very,
very rapidly,

1419
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:17,720
the of people,
the proportion of people who are likely 

1420
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:17,820
to be dispossessed as a consequence of,
um,

1421
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:19,170
of,
of,

1422
01:11:19,590 --> 01:11:24,590
of,
of lesser ability to deal with that kind

1423
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:27,550
of complexity,
that problem is going to increase.

1424
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:31,210
And that's across the board and it isn't
obvious what to do about that.

1425
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:36,070
I don't really buy guaranteed basic 
income solutions in part because I don't

1426
01:11:36,071 --> 01:11:39,160
think that money is actually the 
solution to the problem of what to do in

1427
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:41,380
life.
Like money can stave off,

1428
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:43,680
right?
In some ways it's the opposite.

1429
01:11:43,681 --> 01:11:46,700
If you lose a goal that you're striving 
for,

1430
01:11:46,850 --> 01:11:50,870
that makes life tough.
Over conversation that I think should be

1431
01:11:50,871 --> 01:11:55,871
around table with Democrats and 
Conservatives and Republicans to say 

1432
01:11:55,871 --> 01:12:00,610
what's a furrow capitalist argument for 
how we're going to train people and 

1433
01:12:00,610 --> 01:12:00,610
bring them along.
Right?

1434
01:12:00,710 --> 01:12:01,340
What's,
what's uh,

1435
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:01,790
what's,
uh,

1436
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:07,060
you know,
a liberal argument for having concern 

1437
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:07,060
for people who don't have the same 
advantages from the same background.

1438
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:07,060
Yeah.

1439
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:07,560
Well,
you know,

1440
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:10,770
the silicon valley types,
they tend to skew pretty heavily liberal

1441
01:12:11,070 --> 01:12:13,470
and that's because they're generally 
creative and entrepreneurial,

1442
01:12:13,710 --> 01:12:18,710
but they're very rapidly building a 
world in which people who are at the 

1443
01:12:18,710 --> 01:12:20,280
lower end of the cognitive distribution 
are going to be adrift.

1444
01:12:21,260 --> 01:12:23,600
Right.
And we need to fix that from both sides.

1445
01:12:23,601 --> 01:12:26,590
So rather than saying all or nothing,
right,

1446
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,970
like tough lot capitalism,
free market,

1447
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:34,000
forget it or you know,
we need to support every single person 

1448
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,691
in every single way.
That has to be the subject of 

1449
01:12:37,691 --> 01:12:40,361
complicated in depth conversations with 
people weighing in from a variety of 

1450
01:12:40,361 --> 01:12:41,540
different political views.
It just has to be in order.

1451
01:12:41,541 --> 01:12:45,740
It's so complicated.
It's so complicated that we need,

1452
01:12:45,741 --> 01:12:48,420
we need opinions and brains from all 
sides of the issue.

1453
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:53,560
That's for sure.
We definitely might also need different 

1454
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:53,560
test cases,

1455
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:56,570
those tough conversations,
you know,

1456
01:12:56,571 --> 01:12:59,960
like between someone who leans very 
liberal and someone like Ben Shapiro,

1457
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:02,150
you can think about those as stress 
tests,

1458
01:13:03,010 --> 01:13:08,010
your damn stupid solution,
which you've put a lot of effort into 

1459
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:08,010
elaborating,
let's say,

1460
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:11,600
can't withstand the stress of a single 
argument with someone who disagrees with

1461
01:13:11,601 --> 01:13:12,500
you.
What the hell do you.

1462
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:15,140
What makes you think that's going to 
work when you implemented it in the real

1463
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:20,141
world?
Obviously it's going to fail merely 

1464
01:13:20,141 --> 01:13:23,021
because those people are going to object
to it independent of its objective 

1465
01:13:23,021 --> 01:13:26,720
merits and so if it can't fly with your 
opponents.

1466
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:31,070
I mean I'm not talking about the fringe 
opponents because nothing flies with the

1467
01:13:31,071 --> 01:13:33,560
fringe except what the fringe beliefs,
but

1468
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:38,350
also think that the French is overly 
represented and that's what's so hard.

1469
01:13:39,430 --> 01:13:43,040
Like when mark duplass apologize for 
saying people should follow Ben Shapiro,

1470
01:13:43,430 --> 01:13:45,920
right?
There was an apology he put forth.

1471
01:13:46,220 --> 01:13:48,520
I haven't worked with with with deep 
loss.

1472
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:53,790
I've heard he's a terrific guy and I 
think that is seen with sort of a 

1473
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:53,790
furtherance of,
of,

1474
01:13:53,790 --> 01:13:56,570
of an ending of polarization and 
discourse.

1475
01:13:57,590 --> 01:14:02,590
I don't know who,
who are all those people who were 

1476
01:14:02,590 --> 01:14:05,801
personally deeply wounded by him saying 
that you should just follow somebody 

1477
01:14:05,801 --> 01:14:08,330
whether you agree with him or not,
and I also don't know who the apology is

1478
01:14:08,331 --> 01:14:13,331
geared towards like who is he 
apologizing to and if we have sort of a 

1479
01:14:13,331 --> 01:14:17,701
mob ditties I mean the one thing I say a
lot and this is a specialist from 

1480
01:14:17,701 --> 01:14:21,631
Hollywood,
is there's a huge and widening gap 

1481
01:14:21,631 --> 01:14:24,511
between conversations that people are 
having in public and what they really 

1482
01:14:24,511 --> 01:14:26,710
believe in the sign of a creeping 
totalitarianism that's really,

1483
01:14:26,711 --> 01:14:29,770
really dangerous and it's also from both
sides.

1484
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:32,230
I'm not just saying that this is a 
liberal value.

1485
01:14:32,231 --> 01:14:37,231
I think there's a lot more people who 
have more complicated views that they 

1486
01:14:37,231 --> 01:14:41,011
don't feel safe to articulate it because
fear of complete reputation slammer 

1487
01:14:42,090 --> 01:14:43,050
room,
right?

1488
01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:48,090
Don't we'll be out of work.
It will be everything else and so I 

1489
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:48,090
don't.
It's very interesting thing,

1490
01:14:48,470 --> 01:14:53,470
may have a lot of sympathy for people 
who set out and say something and then 

1491
01:14:53,470 --> 01:14:58,141
sort of retreat and apologize because I 
feel like the force of a mod response 

1492
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:03,750
from the French,
even if it's sort of pluralistic 

1493
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:03,750
ignorance,
right?

1494
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:04,090
I mean 90 percent of people might agree 
with you,

1495
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:07,120
but if the tanner allowed and it's all 
that you're seeing everywhere,

1496
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:09,370
it has the power to reality.
Yep.

1497
01:15:09,570 --> 01:15:11,440
That's on mind control.
Colts function.

1498
01:15:11,670 --> 01:15:16,670
You know,
mind control is one of the first things 

1499
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:16,670
they do.
If they can get you off through complex,

1500
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:18,610
there's privacy and everywhere that you 
look,

1501
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:21,100
if there's two versions,
they try and split me.

1502
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:26,100
I went undercover in a mind control 
calls to research one of my calls and 

1503
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:28,840
when you're there,
everything that I say that is cult Greg,

1504
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:32,680
they're splitting Colt Greg from Greg,
Greg and everything that I saved,

1505
01:15:32,681 --> 01:15:33,940
like wow,
this is fun.

1506
01:15:33,970 --> 01:15:38,970
It's Sorta love bombing.
Everyone leans in its direct eye 

1507
01:15:38,970 --> 01:15:39,220
contact,
sort of nonsexual touching.

1508
01:15:39,221 --> 01:15:40,660
Everyone's engaged.
But if I say,

1509
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:41,500
you know,
this is weird,

1510
01:15:41,501 --> 01:15:44,680
I kind of miss being in contact with 
someone of their friends.

1511
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:46,570
It's the sort of windshield that 
everyone's,

1512
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:52,860
and it's what I think is happening,
but from a smaller percentage of people 

1513
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:58,830
that are really,
really loud and if you see it all of a 

1514
01:15:58,830 --> 01:16:02,491
sudden it seems to be the reality would 
be our sort of apologies that I believe 

1515
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:06,370
when a lot of people make the apologies,
they read flat.

1516
01:16:06,371 --> 01:16:11,320
To me it doesn't feel heartfelt and also
like let's say you really did screw up,

1517
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:14,350
like part of what we need to do is screw
up.

1518
01:16:14,380 --> 01:16:19,380
Pardon me?
Think about things and say things and 

1519
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:19,380
overstaffed and go,
wow,

1520
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:20,040
that was kind of his girl.
You know?

1521
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:25,380
Oh,
what's a blanket apology to society 

1522
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:25,380
versus the individual stuff to say,
hey,

1523
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:28,990
I forwarded this position.
I wish I had articulated it better.

1524
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:34,050
I don't always relate myself perfectly.
Probably what I should've said rather 

1525
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:38,431
than,
and so sorry to have had a thought that 

1526
01:16:38,431 --> 01:16:39,010
is isn't appropriate and we're seeing 
this across the board.

1527
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:44,060
I think it's really being part of what 
needs to be done and this is something 

1528
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:44,060
we already talked about,
is to,

1529
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:46,840
is to generate better dialogue.
Yeah.

1530
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:51,930
It isn't like that and hope that the 
mere fact that it's a much higher 

1531
01:16:51,930 --> 01:16:54,370
quality is sufficient to attract people 
to it in a way from this other nonsense.

1532
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,010
Yes.
It's hard because as you said,

1533
01:16:57,011 --> 01:17:00,180
the shorter the span.
Like I have people who that,

1534
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:03,550
who knows that we're good friends,
you know our work is time to tangle up.

1535
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:08,550
We mentioned each other and our books.
We've known each other shit since I was 

1536
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:12,240
20 years old and people will say,
well he believes in course minority like

1537
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:15,500
dismissed it.
It'll be one thing and it's like it's an

1538
01:17:15,501 --> 01:17:20,501
anthropological term or sociological 
term with specific meeting takes one 

1539
01:17:21,051 --> 01:17:26,051
google search to sort of prove that it's
not that Jordan Peterson is running 

1540
01:17:26,051 --> 01:17:28,060
around like a world war two propaganda 
poster,

1541
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:31,670
like dragging ribbon off into the caves 
of giving them,

1542
01:17:31,671 --> 01:17:33,560
giving them to useless men.
Right.

1543
01:17:33,561 --> 01:17:35,240
I mean,
but it's so disprovable,

1544
01:17:35,241 --> 01:17:40,241
but it's also so damning on a format 
like twitter where you have 280 

1545
01:17:40,241 --> 01:17:44,921
characters and so it's that.
It's that reputation thing where like if

1546
01:17:45,171 --> 01:17:48,230
you associate with you,
you should never be discussed again.

1547
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:51,980
If you should follow a bunch of pure,
whether you agree with him or not,

1548
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:56,210
you'll be bombarded in shamed until you 
apologize for even saying that.

1549
01:17:56,240 --> 01:17:57,350
You'll do that and it's like,
look,

1550
01:17:57,380 --> 01:18:01,910
I've learned the most from my friends 
who disagree with me the most.

1551
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:04,490
I have a wide range of friends.
It's so funny,

1552
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:07,970
but one of the stories that I tell after
president trump was elected.

1553
01:18:07,971 --> 01:18:12,971
I was in Vegas on a book tour and one of
my friends was a crusty old farmer and 

1554
01:18:12,971 --> 01:18:16,340
sniper from the SPEC ops community.
He passed away recently,

1555
01:18:16,341 --> 01:18:21,341
but he was just a great friend and a 
great guy and I did a lot of shooting 

1556
01:18:21,601 --> 01:18:26,601
with him for the books and then a lot of
research and he wanted me to see his 

1557
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:29,201
ranch and we pull up to his ranch and he
has a tank parked in his front yard and 

1558
01:18:29,201 --> 01:18:30,800
sticking out of the.
Out of the end of it.

1559
01:18:30,890 --> 01:18:34,490
He's a trump pence sign.
So at that exact moment,

1560
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:40,090
my wife sends me a text and it's her and
my daughter at like one of the thousand 

1561
01:18:41,121 --> 01:18:43,760
women marches and they just come up on 
Miley Cyrus,

1562
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:45,270
so they're like my daughter's pose.

1563
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:48,560
Even miley Cyrus and the tech sort of 
comes in and my buddy looks at me.

1564
01:18:48,561 --> 01:18:49,580
He goes,
what's that?

1565
01:18:49,650 --> 01:18:51,590
And I looked up at him,
I said nothing.

1566
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:57,940
But then I showed him and we had a good 
laugh about it in sort of this way that 

1567
01:18:58,180 --> 01:19:01,760
it's like you need people around to have
a whole variety of things.

1568
01:19:01,761 --> 01:19:06,761
And one thing that's interesting with 
him was around the time of the Muslim 

1569
01:19:06,761 --> 01:19:09,161
ban.
And I was talking to him a lot about 

1570
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:09,161
that.
And I,

1571
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:09,380
I'm,
I'm personally very posts the Muslim ban

1572
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:10,580
for instance.
But there's,

1573
01:19:10,910 --> 01:19:14,390
there's a lot of reasons if you talk to 
people in the military,

1574
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:17,450
there's a lot of problems recruiting 
translators now.

1575
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:22,510
Like that has a negative effect that 
ripple through the intelligence 

1576
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:22,510
community.
It's not good.

1577
01:19:22,510 --> 01:19:27,340
And you know,
and whether I've friends who were 

1578
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:28,640
vehement advocates of this,
but I'm arguing with them saying what is

1579
01:19:28,641 --> 01:19:31,730
the actual ground truth of how that is 
affecting things.

1580
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:33,500
And then there's all the people in the 
military who were like,

1581
01:19:33,530 --> 01:19:38,530
this has been a total shit show.
It's really hurting our intelligence 

1582
01:19:38,530 --> 01:19:41,771
efforts and our allies.
I feel like that's the level of the 

1583
01:19:41,771 --> 01:19:42,440
discussion.
Or one of the other things for me that's

1584
01:19:42,441 --> 01:19:44,030
very relevant is,
you know,

1585
01:19:44,031 --> 01:19:47,010
I don't know if you know this,
but there's 15,000

1586
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:52,040
Muslim physicians from the seven banned 
Muslim countries in America and they 

1587
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:55,310
predominantly work in,
in rural red state districts.

1588
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:58,190
They're providing the majority of,
not the majority of the.

1589
01:19:58,191 --> 01:20:01,850
Providing a ton of medical care to a lot
of people in red states.

1590
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:03,830
And by the way,
those are the people.

1591
01:20:03,831 --> 01:20:08,831
If they fled Aleppo,
they hate Bishar Hassan and extremism 

1592
01:20:08,831 --> 01:20:09,150
like this is,
this is,

1593
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:13,140
this is exactly the sorts of people who 
you want to have in these areas.

1594
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:16,080
And if they're pulled out,
we're going to have a lot of rural areas

1595
01:20:16,081 --> 01:20:21,081
that more affluent physicians are not 
going to have access to medical care 

1596
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:25,500
because more affluent positions or 
people from America don't always want to

1597
01:20:25,501 --> 01:20:27,270
go to these regions.

1598
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:29,520
There's a lot of like bigger recruiting 
a physician,

1599
01:20:29,521 --> 01:20:34,521
so you have with people who are,
who are great sort of citizens and 

1600
01:20:34,521 --> 01:20:38,271
representatives who hate extremism,
who are treating people in different 

1601
01:20:38,271 --> 01:20:38,271
states.
And it's like,

1602
01:20:38,271 --> 01:20:40,830
that's really important.
And you pair that with the Intel picture

1603
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:46,070
that I think is deeply problematic and 
you have a sort of argument that isn't 

1604
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:48,600
just,
you should have more empathy for Muslims

1605
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:52,410
and which then just deteriorates into,
well they're terrorists and like it just

1606
01:20:52,411 --> 01:20:57,411
devolves rather looking at sort of the 
temperament of the people who were here 

1607
01:20:57,411 --> 01:20:59,340
and you have to have conversations with 
people from all sides of the,

1608
01:20:59,390 --> 01:21:04,390
uh,
like I had a lot of conversations with 

1609
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:05,841
people in the military who support it or
against it to kind of start to zero in 

1610
01:21:05,841 --> 01:21:07,170
on what my position is.

1611
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,830
Okay.
So the plan is something like this.

1612
01:21:10,831 --> 01:21:13,560
So we'll,
we've recorded this video.

1613
01:21:13,830 --> 01:21:17,670
I'm going to post it as a public 
invitation to the intellectual dark web.

1614
01:21:17,671 --> 01:21:22,671
I think that's what I'll title it or 
subtitling idea would be to bring on 

1615
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:27,950
people democrats at least to begin with 
because that would sort of run counter 

1616
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:32,481
to the idw reputation,
let's say Democrats who are capable and 

1617
01:21:32,911 --> 01:21:37,911
we're capable of and willing to engage 
in long form discussions about co 

1618
01:21:37,911 --> 01:21:40,500
complex high resolution issues and to 
provide a more,

1619
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:44,350
at least in part a more centrist 
alternative to the radical leftists,

1620
01:21:44,351 --> 01:21:49,351
but also to bring on people with more 
left leaning views to have them a try 

1621
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:55,250
their arguments out in a more,
in a more fully fledged manner.

1622
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:56,760
Something like that.

1623
01:21:57,130 --> 01:21:59,620
Yeah,
I mean how does anyone lives,

1624
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:01,720
like if someone's conservative not 
moving,

1625
01:22:01,990 --> 01:22:04,180
they should know what the reasonable 
virgin isn't.

1626
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:06,430
The argument they're rejecting like good
for you.

1627
01:22:06,431 --> 01:22:11,431
Then you know all that.
They're seeing his reports of like 

1628
01:22:11,431 --> 01:22:15,031
students gone wild on college campuses 
and the craziness that I believe I 

1629
01:22:15,031 --> 01:22:17,680
believe is a problem.
I mean you've certainly,

1630
01:22:17,681 --> 01:22:22,681
you've dealt with protests and you've 
dealt with that sort of like brutal 

1631
01:22:23,030 --> 01:22:26,080
groupthink and anti first amendment.
You know,

1632
01:22:26,170 --> 01:22:29,760
like sort of shutting down speech,
it's always tricky to talk about freedom

1633
01:22:29,761 --> 01:22:32,590
of speech and first amendment because 
it's unclear,

1634
01:22:32,591 --> 01:22:37,591
always wear that lapses in being legal 
or constitutional versus just people 

1635
01:22:37,591 --> 01:22:41,610
articulating things loudly,
but I have no question that that's a 

1636
01:22:41,610 --> 01:22:41,610
problem,
but I think that there's.

1637
01:22:41,610 --> 01:22:46,150
I think that it is over represented an 
amplified by the media and by both sides

1638
01:22:46,151 --> 01:22:47,010
of the media.
Yeah.

1639
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:52,280
So to see her topic and I think we 
should get people in who are willing to 

1640
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:56,110
have conversations that are solutioning 
here so that if people realize that,

1641
01:22:56,590 --> 01:22:57,400
see,
for me,

1642
01:22:57,460 --> 01:23:01,470
part of what my interest is in sort of 
trying to transcend politics and getting

1643
01:23:01,471 --> 01:23:04,960
to a place where like I don't care if 
you're republican or Democrat as much.

1644
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,820
I care if you're offering real 
solutions.

1645
01:23:06,821 --> 01:23:07,250
Yes.
Right.

1646
01:23:07,251 --> 01:23:07,730
Exactly.

1647
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:11,190
This would be to figure out what the 
problems are,

1648
01:23:11,191 --> 01:23:15,270
to see if we can come to some sort of 
consensus about where are the challenges

1649
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:17,040
that confront us really lie.

1650
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:22,590
Right.
And if there's a Democrat running for 

1651
01:23:22,590 --> 01:23:23,980
office who is very dark money embedded 
in bold the donors,

1652
01:23:23,981 --> 01:23:26,410
and there's somebody who's a,
a cleaner,

1653
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:28,600
a choice,
who's running,

1654
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:29,980
who's a Republican,
it's like,

1655
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:31,490
let's have that house,
you know,

1656
01:23:31,510 --> 01:23:32,150
it's,
this is,

1657
01:23:32,151 --> 01:23:36,580
this is about actually spring to figure 
out solutions for,

1658
01:23:36,590 --> 01:23:41,590
for,
for people in terms of the level of 

1659
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:41,590
discourse that we can happen to 
solutions that need to be offered.

1660
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:44,050
Because while we're here talking about 
all this stuff,

1661
01:23:44,051 --> 01:23:46,450
there's a lot of people's dealing with a
lot of real life problems.

1662
01:23:48,950 --> 01:23:52,190
I've started to introduce you to a 
number of people.

1663
01:23:52,550 --> 01:23:55,540
You've met Sam and you met Dave Rubin.
Um,

1664
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:57,560
you met Douglas Murray.
Briefly.

1665
01:23:57,770 --> 01:24:00,020
Who else?
Who else have I introduced you to?

1666
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:05,860
Um,
a number of other peripheral people or 

1667
01:24:05,860 --> 01:24:06,900
other crews.
But I think,

1668
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:07,590
you know,
I,

1669
01:24:07,591 --> 01:24:12,591
I,
there's a number of people I'd like to 

1670
01:24:12,591 --> 01:24:14,361
talk to the viewpoint and the viewpoint 
that is more aligned with my politics 

1671
01:24:15,740 --> 01:24:19,560
represented.
So we should,

1672
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:22,260
we should keep at it.
And I think that the aim for me,

1673
01:24:22,261 --> 01:24:23,310
there's a couple of aims.
I mean,

1674
01:24:23,311 --> 01:24:25,740
the aim is to sort of end polarizing 
discourse,

1675
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:30,570
raise the level of conversation that can
be had for actual solutions that we need

1676
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:35,600
for actual people and sort of longterm 
aim for me is just to,

1677
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:39,270
to,
to eliminate the levels of corruption in

1678
01:24:39,271 --> 01:24:41,940
the government and that's crossed the 
boards either side.

1679
01:24:41,941 --> 01:24:46,941
That's a longterm aim for me is like 
who's willing to sign onto the disclose 

1680
01:24:46,941 --> 01:24:50,721
act,
who's willing to say that they're going 

1681
01:24:50,721 --> 01:24:52,070
to disclose all their donors?
Everyone we paid for an APP who's 

1682
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:53,490
willing to not take pac money is 
individual candidates.

1683
01:24:53,550 --> 01:24:54,510
Um,
you know,

1684
01:24:54,511 --> 01:24:56,490
who's willing to stand up against 
gerrymandering.

1685
01:24:56,850 --> 01:25:00,910
And that to me is party agnostic.
Whose on that?

1686
01:25:02,570 --> 01:25:03,600
Yup.
Okay.

1687
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:08,410
Well sounds like a plan.
Alright.

1688
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:10,900
Alright,
I'll start.

1689
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:16,380
I'll start the ball rolling on my end.
I've got some people that I want you to 

1690
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:16,690
meet on the Republican end of the 
distribution as well.

1691
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,180
Great.
I'm happy

1692
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:23,640
to meet with anyone who is reasonable 
and willing to have discourse instead 

1693
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:24,280
the chest these?
Yup.

1694
01:25:24,590 --> 01:25:25,550
Okay,
good.

1695
01:25:25,950 --> 01:25:26,960
Good talking to you greg.
