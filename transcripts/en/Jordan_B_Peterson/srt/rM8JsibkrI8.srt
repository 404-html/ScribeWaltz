1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:06,240
Undoubtedly you've noticed that this is 
being taped so the tapes will show up on

2
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:08,490
some relatively regular schedule.
Um,

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:13,890
I wouldn't expect that precisely because
I don't want to make any promises about,

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,440
you know exactly how quickly that'll be 
done.

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,430
Martin Jang here is doing it on his own 
accord so it's like,

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,403
you know,
two thumbs up for Martin as far as I'm 

7
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:23,274
concerned.
So because he's done this for a number 

8
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:28,140
of my courses and it's a lot of work and
it's much appreciated.

9
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:31,110
So anyways,
that's why all of this stuff is set up.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,333
So,
um,

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,240
I think I told you pretty much about 
what the class entails on your part,

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,913
you know,
um,

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,583
and if you,
you've heard this lecture and I'm sure 

14
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:48,600
at least a reasonable number of you have
heard me lecture before,

15
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:49,434
so you sort of know how I'm going to 
lecture and that was more or less how 

16
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:53,064
I'm going to do it.

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,830
Um,
I'm,

18
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,350
I'm hoping that,
you know,

19
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,540
we can make this class like deadly 
successful.

20
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:01,374
That's the idea.
And that you'll regard it as something 

21
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:03,961
that,
you know,

22
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:04,794
depending on your participation,
obviously you'll regard it as something 

23
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:09,360
that's really valuable.
I can tell any of the stuff I've learned

24
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,194
that I'm telling you about,
it has been so useful to me that I 

25
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:14,490
can't,
uh,

26
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,823
I can't.
I can't really even communicate how 

27
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:20,910
useful it's been.
It's been unbelievably useful.

28
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,223
And you know,
partly what I'm going to explain to you 

29
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:25,320
if I can,
is why,

30
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,333
you know,
there are tenants of classical morality 

31
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,320
and there's a variety of them and one of
them is,

32
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:32,760
for example,
don't lie.

33
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,953
And you know,
that's a tough one because you might 

34
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:35,681
think,
well,

35
00:01:35,681 --> 00:01:37,440
you know,
why not really?

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,490
Why not?
I mean,

37
00:01:38,491 --> 00:01:39,320
if you can,
if,

38
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,560
if you can set up a situation so that 
you benefit from a,

39
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,070
from an untruth,
what stops you from doing it,

40
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,083
you know,
and Dostoevsky and one of his most 

41
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:52,080
famous statements,
he said,

42
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,840
if there's no god,
everything is permitted.

43
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,660
And it's a takeoff on Nietzsche and 
thinking too,

44
00:01:57,661 --> 00:01:58,494
and it's a problem that he thought would
be the fundamental problem of the 20th 

45
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:01,704
century.
And I think he was absolutely right and 

46
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,010
it's a question very much we're thinking
about.

47
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:07,860
It's like,
why bother with things that are moral?

48
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:08,694
Why do things right?
Is there even such a thing as doing 

49
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:13,080
things right?
These are great questions.

50
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,333
You know,
and hopefully I'm going to try to do 

51
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:20,420
with you guys is to show you what the 
consequences.

52
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:21,870
I've been thinking about those things 
for,

53
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,390
you know,
it's almost 30 years I guess now.

54
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:26,160
And I've,
you know,

55
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,053
I've got a ways,
certainly a ways that has been 

56
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,533
satisfying to me and I want to tell you 
what I've concluded and then you can 

57
00:02:33,901 --> 00:02:35,790
decide for yourself if you think it's 
useful.

58
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:40,791
And one thing I would really encourage 
you to do is like,

59
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,043
you should be skeptical about what I'm 
telling you really like you should 

60
00:02:46,741 --> 00:02:47,510
question it.

61
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,343
Like,
I don't mean the kind of skepticism 

62
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:51,630
that's like this because like,
you know,

63
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:52,464
I'm not here to prove myself to you at 
all and you're not here to prove 

64
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:57,590
yourself to me either.
So you have to listen,

65
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,800
you have to attend.
But by same token,

66
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:04,060
I would say like I'm telling you things 
that I have tried to hammer to death,

67
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,030
I've tried to see if they were wrong,
you know,

68
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:08,680
because that's how you're supposed to 
test ideas.

69
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:10,030
You throw out an idea and you have the 
hammer,

70
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:12,700
the hell out of it,
see if you can see if it's wrong,

71
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:13,973
not whether it's right,
because that's an ideological thinking 

72
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:19,090
and the things I'm telling you are 
things I could not disprove.

73
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,750
They seem to stand up.
And I've tried multiple tests,

74
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:23,584
you know,
so one of them is sort of a consilience 

75
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:26,224
test and the consumer says a word that 
was defined by Edward or Wilson and 

76
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,700
what,
when an,

77
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,533
when an explanation is consilience,
what that means is that it's coherent 

78
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,290
across multiple levels of analysis,
you know.

79
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:40,930
And so I've tried to test the ideas that
I'm describing to you.

80
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,693
I've tried to determine whether they're 
logically coherent and appropriate at 

81
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:53,701
the level of general psychology and 
clinical psychology and neuroscience and

82
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,840
narrative theory and religious thinking.
And then also to see if they're actually

83
00:03:58,841 --> 00:04:03,841
applicable as practical as practical 
realities in day to day life.

84
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:07,420
And an end in social life and the,
as far as I'm concerned,

85
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:08,254
they stand up.
That's been my experience and I've also 

86
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:14,920
watched people over many years now try 
to apply them in their own lives and all

87
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,670
I've been able to see so far with my 
graduate students and so on is that they

88
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,710
works.
So you know,

89
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,753
ray for that.
And so we're going to try to understand 

90
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,850
some basic issues like what the utility 
of truth is.

91
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,403
And that's a really important question.
It's maybe the fundamental question is 

92
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:33,970
truth useful?

93
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,100
And if so,
how and why?

94
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:38,050
And like man,
we're going to go after that.

95
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:38,884
Especially with regards to verbal truth 
because there's something magical about 

96
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:42,994
words.
There really is something magical about 

97
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:47,140
them.
And the way you use words determines the

98
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:47,974
course of your life.
And maybe more than that maybe the 

99
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:50,284
course of everyone's life.
So I wanted to explain to you how that 

100
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:55,240
can be true and what it means.
So you know,

101
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,900
that should be relatively entertaining.
And hopefully,

102
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,110
what else I can tell you is I'm going to
throw out some key propositions.

103
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:05,074
There's probably about seven or eight of
them and what I'm hoping is that you'll 

104
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:08,314
be able to use those propositions as 
keys that will help you unlock things 

105
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:13,960
that you wouldn't otherwise be able to 
consciously understand.

106
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,320
And I gave you some example of that with
this little story,

107
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,183
you know,
because that little story happens to be 

108
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:22,060
an extraordinarily deep little story and
it's,

109
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:22,501
you know,
it's,

110
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:25,570
it's,
it's so old that story like I think that

111
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:28,630
story stems from when we were still in 
trees really.

112
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,240
And that our,
when our prime enemies were snakes,

113
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:33,730
because it does appear according to 
Lynne Isbell anyways,

114
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:37,600
who's an anthropologist and in 
California and that,

115
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,850
um,
our primary predators,

116
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:42,610
60 million years ago when we were 
basically inhabiting trees,

117
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:44,950
were predatory snakes and that we 
evolved with.

118
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,873
And so they're like,
human being versus snake Motif is not 

119
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:53,950
only the oldest story we know from a 
consciously articulated perspective,

120
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:58,951
but it might be the literal story of our
species as a biological entity.

121
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:04,190
So know that I'm telling you that 
because it gives you some idea about how

122
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:05,024
deep these stories can go.
They can go to the really to the bottom 

123
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:12,530
of things and if you know some of these 
key propositions,

124
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:17,060
when you see archetipal stories 
portrayed in front of you with,

125
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,953
and that happens all the time.
I been all the superhero movies that 

126
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:23,030
have come out later,
later lately.

127
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,043
Nursing Home hoards of them,
they are tremendously expensive to make 

128
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:28,370
a hundreds of millions of dollars.
Those things.

129
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,340
It's like they're all predicated and 
archetipal themes,

130
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,773
you know,
and I think it's of great interest to 

131
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:34,514
know the most expensive artifacts that 
human beings produced or at least among 

132
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:38,264
the most expensive artifacts that we 
produce are precisely movies that are 

133
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:44,510
computer generated to tell archetipal 
stories,

134
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,310
you know?
And that's also the,

135
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,473
the technological process that in large 
part is driving computer innovation 

136
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:52,694
because the most demand that's being 
placed on things like computer chips is 

137
00:06:55,671 --> 00:06:56,504
actually,
you know,

138
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,533
recreating reality,
CGI reality because it's the most 

139
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:02,060
complicated thing to do.
So it's like,

140
00:07:02,061 --> 00:07:03,440
what the hell?
Why are we doing that?

141
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,260
What's up with that?
Why would you spend $300,

142
00:07:06,261 --> 00:07:08,540
million dollars making iron man,
you know,

143
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,540
there's a profit motive there obviously,
but everybody will go see it.

144
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,800
It's like,
what's up with you people?

145
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:13,634
You know,
you're going to see some Dingbat and a 

146
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,090
metal suit fly around in the air.
You know,

147
00:07:17,091 --> 00:07:18,430
that's not true.
It's like,

148
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,950
what are you doing at those movies?
You think while I'm entertaining myself.

149
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:22,820
It's like,
yeah,

150
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,720
yeah,
right.

151
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:25,160
Except why is it entertaining

152
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,340
and why is it entertaining to all of 
you?

153
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,340
Why is it entertaining to everyone?
You know?

154
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:32,174
There's a reason for that.
So partly what we're going to find out 

155
00:07:34,101 --> 00:07:34,934
too is what it is about stories that 
attract our interest in why it is why 

156
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:39,284
that is and it's not,
it's not merely entertainment and it's 

157
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:44,690
like the most potent form of learning 
that we have.

158
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,800
So well anyways,
so that's the goal.

159
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,180
And during this as well,
you know,

160
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:54,650
I hope that you can articulate 
yourselves further and also come to some

161
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:55,484
deeper understanding about the absolute 
essential nature of proper language use 

162
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:03,500
in spoken language and in written 
language because you bake,

163
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:07,910
you basically think and speak and write 
yourself into existence.

164
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:10,550
And one of the things that means is you 
should be very,

165
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:11,384
very careful with what you say because 
you are literally bringing realms of 

166
00:08:15,891 --> 00:08:16,724
reality into being through speaking and 
you want to make bloody sure that the 

167
00:08:19,191 --> 00:08:22,700
realms of reality that you're 
participating in bringing into being are

168
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:26,600
the ones that you would actually like 
yourself and those you love to inhabit.

169
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,480
So,
you know,

170
00:08:29,481 --> 00:08:34,481
it's a,
well I don't have much more to say about

171
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,133
the course than that.
So what I'll do now is see if you have 

172
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:40,610
any questions.
So yes,

173
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,613
I felt like I liked them all along.
I felt like he was getting out of 

174
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:53,720
control but that he just wanted some 
attention,

175
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:54,554
but I don't know why from the beginning 
of the building and was dragging that 

176
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,220
he's bad.

177
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,053
Right.
Well,

178
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,303
okay,
so the question is why is the dragon 

179
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:04,890
portrayed as bad?
It's like,

180
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,090
well,
first of all,

181
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,390
we might notice that culture cross 
culturally.

182
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:11,160
That's not necessarily the case,
right,

183
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:11,994
so the dragon in the West tends to be 
something to conquer and something that 

184
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:17,274
hoards

185
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,190
emergence strangely enough and it's 
something to be conquered and the church

186
00:09:22,191 --> 00:09:24,350
are to be taken,
but in east,

187
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,243
particularly among the Chinese,
the dragon is something that's positive 

188
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,720
and what I would say is when we'll study
this,

189
00:09:29,721 --> 00:09:33,110
when we get into the symbolism that's 
associated with with reptiles,

190
00:09:33,111 --> 00:09:36,500
fundamentally with predatory reptiles,
you'll see that the dragon is actually a

191
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:40,400
tremendously ambivalent representation 
because it represents.

192
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,870
It really represents the unknown or even
more precisely,

193
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:49,610
it represents the element of the unknown
that you don't even know exists.

194
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,180
You don't because sometimes something 
unexpected could happen to you,

195
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,550
but you can understand it when it 
happens,

196
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,583
but sometimes something unexpected 
happens to you when it's so unexpected 

197
00:09:59,781 --> 00:10:02,600
that you can't even conceptualize it.
I would say when the.

198
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,510
When the twin towers fell in New York,
that was an event like that,

199
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:09,680
it's really outside the domain of your 
understanding and then there's a.

200
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,910
there's an ambivalence about that 
because you don't know the nature of the

201
00:10:13,911 --> 00:10:17,610
event precisely so the the,
the,

202
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,780
the predatory reptiles,
especially the treasure garden,

203
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:24,830
predatory reptiles stands for the 
potential that exists in the unknown,

204
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,860
and that potential can be positive and 
negative,

205
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:28,963
right?
Because it's the source of all new 

206
00:10:30,231 --> 00:10:31,064
things.
It's also the source of that which will 

207
00:10:32,871 --> 00:10:36,050
destroy them,
and so it's a very paradoxical entity.

208
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,520
Now,
one more thing,

209
00:10:37,521 --> 00:10:38,354
so,
so the story implies that there's an 

210
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,870
optimal size of dragon and I would say 
while you're nervous,

211
00:10:44,871 --> 00:10:48,440
systems are actually tuned to detect the
optimal size of dragons.

212
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,453
What we'll talk about this in great 
detail as we go through the biology of 

213
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,743
anxiety and discussed as it turns out,
which is something I've learned more 

214
00:10:56,331 --> 00:11:01,331
about recently.
You know how you can sometimes if you're

215
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:05,000
engaged in a task,
let's say a cognitive task,

216
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,290
you can find it overwhelming.

217
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:07,663
It's right something.
You're having a very difficult time 

218
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:11,060
understanding and maybe you even wonder 
if you're up to it.

219
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,500
Okay,
so you might say,

220
00:11:12,501 --> 00:11:14,540
well,
your nervous system is indicating to you

221
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,510
that that's a threat,
and then other times you'll be dealing,

222
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:18,344
say with the cognitive task,
it's beneath your abilities and so it's 

223
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:21,914
easy and you get bored,
so then you'll be dealing with a 

224
00:11:25,611 --> 00:11:28,970
cognitive task that it's like goldilocks
and the three bears,

225
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:29,804
right?
The temperature is just right and what 

226
00:11:31,311 --> 00:11:32,144
happens is that you have to grapple with
the task and it pushes you forward into 

227
00:11:35,741 --> 00:11:39,500
your development,
but it also really engages you so you're

228
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,423
tied right into it.
It's really easy to remember and 

229
00:11:42,531 --> 00:11:46,670
understand it and you make progress and 
it's difficult in energy demanding,

230
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:50,390
but you're completely captivated by that
process.

231
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,380
That's the right size dragon and that's 
what your nervous system is telling you.

232
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,120
It's say,
look,

233
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,680
this,
this amount of novel information in this

234
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:03,730
domain is precisely the amount that you 
can incorporate,

235
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,013
well optimally transforming the 
knowledge structures that you already 

236
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:12,370
have without exceeding your capacity and
what that does.

237
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:15,010
The way your nervous system signals that
to you as you get interested in it,

238
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,950
you know,
because you white ask yourself like,

239
00:12:17,951 --> 00:12:18,784
why do you get interested in things and 
you bordered by some things and some 

240
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:21,934
things are overwhelming.
It's like you don't have any choice 

241
00:12:23,141 --> 00:12:25,240
about that.
It's not a decision you make,

242
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,613
right?
It's something you discover as you act 

243
00:12:27,821 --> 00:12:28,654
in the world and so dragons of optimal 
size are engaging and they push your 

244
00:12:34,391 --> 00:12:36,640
development,
but if they get too big then they're too

245
00:12:36,641 --> 00:12:37,474
much potential.
I see an analogy between us and the 

246
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:46,900
story of the baby in the crib ended up 
heading everywhere.

247
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,313
It could be that like the thing about 
the thing about that particular symbol 

248
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:56,770
is that it describes the unknown outside
of conceptualization.

249
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,040
It's pure potential.
Now you know,

250
00:13:00,041 --> 00:13:02,140
here's something to think about in 
relationship to that.

251
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:02,974
I did a little Ted talk on potential,
which if you're interested in this sort 

252
00:13:05,621 --> 00:13:06,610
of thing,
you might want to look.

253
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,610
Look at it.
Because I,

254
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,370
I,
I got it right in that talk.

255
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:10,810
I thought,
you know,

256
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,443
there are different ways of thinking 
about what the world's made out of and 

257
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:18,520
you know,
we think that it's made of matter.

258
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,383
That's the basic dogmas of the,
of the materialist ground and I would 

259
00:13:23,231 --> 00:13:23,771
say,
look,

260
00:13:23,771 --> 00:13:24,604
it's really useful to treat the world as
if it's made out of matter and look at 

261
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:29,800
all the things that treating it that way
has allowed us to do.

262
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,083
But that doesn't mean it's the final 
statement about the nature of reality 

263
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:34,564
and whatever matter is,
is pretty damn strange when you get to 

264
00:13:36,971 --> 00:13:37,690
the bottom of it.

265
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,523
We don't understand it at all and we 
don't understand its relationship to 

266
00:13:40,751 --> 00:13:43,000
consciousness.
But putting that aside,

267
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,050
we also act as if things other than 
matter are real.

268
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,303
So for example,
we act as if potential is real and 

269
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:51,394
that's a very strange thing because 
potential by its very nature is not 

270
00:13:54,731 --> 00:13:57,190
really defined because otherwise it 
would be potential,

271
00:13:57,191 --> 00:13:58,390
right?
It would be actuality.

272
00:13:58,750 --> 00:13:59,583
But you know,
all of you understand your parents when 

273
00:14:01,301 --> 00:14:01,811
they say,
well,

274
00:14:01,811 --> 00:14:02,644
you know,
you should live up to your potential or 

275
00:14:04,271 --> 00:14:05,104
there's potential there.
And I would say actually most of the 

276
00:14:07,511 --> 00:14:08,344
time when we're dealing with the world,
what we're dealing with is not the 

277
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:15,040
material world per se.
What we're dealing with is potential.

278
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:18,250
It's like what we're dealing with,
what this could be,

279
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,370
and we're trying to realize the 
potential.

280
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,563
And so another thing that you could 
think about it think about with regards 

281
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,280
to the symbol of the dragon in 
particular,

282
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,533
it's the Predator,
the predatory rep pile more and more 

283
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,120
basically is that it's a,
it's a representation of potential.

284
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,851
And so,
and I,

285
00:14:35,851 --> 00:14:38,440
I think the reason that it takes 
reptilian forum,

286
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,780
and we're going to talk about this in 
great detail,

287
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:42,610
is I think that what happened is we 
evolved,

288
00:14:42,611 --> 00:14:43,444
is that the systems that we originally 
evolved to detect predators constituted 

289
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:50,520
when,
when,

290
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,353
when we underwent the cognitive 
revolution that transformed the world 

291
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:57,410
into abstract representations around us.
That initial print,

292
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,333
predatory detection system was 
elaborated opt into the system that we 

293
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:05,510
use to detect the unknown as such.
But you know,

294
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:06,344
because it's evolution,
the fundamental elements that evolved 

295
00:15:09,861 --> 00:15:11,660
over the course of evolution remained in
tact.

296
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:12,523
We're using the same systems and that 
system has a language and so the 

297
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:17,510
language is something like,
well,

298
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,130
the unexpected event is sort of like the
snake in the grass,

299
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,850
which is perfectly reasonable.
You can think about it as a metaphor.

300
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,920
It's.
I think it's deeper than a metaphor,

301
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,250
but you can think about it as a metaphor
and I would say,

302
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:32,870
well,
there are optimal size.

303
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,213
We have optimal sized adversaries and I 
don't think you could live without an 

304
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,920
optimal sized adversary.
Which is also an interesting.

305
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,140
It's a very interesting idea because you
know,

306
00:15:45,141 --> 00:15:46,850
one of the things that people always 
ask,

307
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:51,080
this is a very metaphysical discussion 
is you know why there has to be evil and

308
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:53,090
horror in the world.
It's like,

309
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:53,924
well,
it's not clear to me that the world 

310
00:15:56,211 --> 00:15:57,044
could be constituted in the manner that 
it's constituted in any acceptable way 

311
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,060
if there were no adversaries.
It's like,

312
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,933
well,
maybe the snake in the garden is 

313
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,400
necessarily,
you know,

314
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:11,510
maybe that imperfection and also that 
that adversary is necessary.

315
00:16:11,511 --> 00:16:14,390
It's the thing that spurs on development
at it.

316
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,300
What would there be without an 
adversary?

317
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,910
Maybe nothing,
you know,

318
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,160
because you like,
I can give you an example.

319
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:22,994
It's a funny example.
There's this little animal whose name I 

320
00:16:25,341 --> 00:16:26,174
cannot remember unfortunately,
but it lives in the ocean and in its 

321
00:16:30,351 --> 00:16:32,780
larval stage it has a brain and swims 
around.

322
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,400
It's a little tiny thing.
It swims around,

323
00:16:34,401 --> 00:16:35,990
you know,
like little plank and then so on.

324
00:16:35,991 --> 00:16:37,580
And then at some point during it's 
development,

325
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:38,414
it's fastens itself onto a rock and it 
grows into something that sort of looks 

326
00:16:41,661 --> 00:16:43,220
like a plant,
you know,

327
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,350
but it's stable.
It never moves again.

328
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:49,670
So as it develops into this stable rock 
cleaning entity,

329
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:54,500
it basically digests its own brain and 
then it doesn't need one after that.

330
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,930
And the reason it doesn't need one as 
well,

331
00:16:56,931 --> 00:16:58,520
there isn't really anything for it to 
do.

332
00:16:58,521 --> 00:17:01,170
It just sits there and filters water.
It takes like a sponge,

333
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,023
sort of.
It takes the nutrients out of the water 

334
00:17:04,851 --> 00:17:09,410
and the brain is just like,
it's extra energy using tissue.

335
00:17:09,411 --> 00:17:12,110
And so it does need the brain anymore.
So you know,

336
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,950
so like you don't need to think if you 
haven't got an adversary.

337
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,130
So.
So then you think,

338
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:21,650
well,
are there optimal sized adversaries?

339
00:17:21,651 --> 00:17:26,651
And part of the Little Motif of that 
story is if you pay careful attention to

340
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:28,274
things as they change,
maybe you can keep the damn adversaries 

341
00:17:30,531 --> 00:17:31,364
optimize.
And I think that actually it may not be 

342
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:36,494
true,
but it's possible that it's true and 

343
00:17:39,711 --> 00:17:40,740
that's something,
you know,

344
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,510
that's something if you really pay.
Because the question might be,

345
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:47,660
and this is something that I thought 
about when I was developing all of these

346
00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:49,010
ideas a long time ago,
it was like,

347
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,270
okay,
well there's obviously some things about

348
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:52,104
existence that aren't exactly the way 
you might lay them out if you had the 

349
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:55,680
choice,
you know,

350
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:58,710
like the fact that people are 
fundamentally vulnerable and that you're

351
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,670
imperfect in 50 different ways and that 
life is full of suffering.

352
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,533
Then everybody dies and you know,
all these things that are existential 

353
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:05,430
nightmares.

354
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,120
It's like,
okay,

355
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,953
fine.
It's easy to judge that is unacceptable 

356
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,750
and maybe even worse than unacceptable 
and intolerable and you know,

357
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,900
I'm deserving of obliteration.
You could even go that far and people do

358
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:19,734
go that far.
But there's another question that 

359
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,240
question begs,
which is,

360
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,313
yeah,
maybe,

361
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,920
but maybe if you brought all of your 
resources to bear on the problem without

362
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:33,054
holding back all of them,
then that would be okay that you could 

363
00:18:35,971 --> 00:18:39,450
master it and that's possible.
You know,

364
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,583
so you won't.
The thing is you'll never know unless 

365
00:18:42,091 --> 00:18:44,850
you try it.
That's the thing because it's actually a

366
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,520
claim that requires an existential 
proof.

367
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:51,360
You can't listen to someone tell you 
that and even if it's true for them,

368
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,460
that doesn't necessarily mean it would 
be true for you.

369
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,680
The only way you can test a proposition 
like that is existentially.

370
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:57,660
You have to act it out.

371
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,720
But as I mentioned earlier,
I see very,

372
00:19:00,721 --> 00:19:04,020
very few truly optimistic ideas in 
profound thought.

373
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:07,170
Most profound ideas are pretty damn 
pessimistic,

374
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,510
but this is one I think that's an 
exception to that,

375
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,373
which is it is possible that your 
constituted so that you have enough 

376
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:16,170
resources to deal with reality as it's 
actually has.

377
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:19,290
It actually lays itself out.
And one of the ways,

378
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,260
and people have been thinking about this
for a very long time too,

379
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,393
is that the most effective one of the 
most effective weapons you have in that 

380
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:32,820
engagement is the capacity to pay 
attention and paying attention.

381
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,953
And it's another thing I've learned over
the years and that's been 

382
00:19:35,821 --> 00:19:37,140
extraordinarily useful to me.

383
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,493
We kind of conflate rational thinking 
with attention and sort of make 

384
00:19:44,461 --> 00:19:45,294
attention like the ugly step sister of 
rationality in some sense because we 

385
00:19:49,051 --> 00:19:49,884
never really considered it as a separate
entity because we are basically 

386
00:19:52,141 --> 00:19:52,974
rationalist suddenly believed that we 
can deal with the world and irrational 

387
00:19:55,401 --> 00:19:56,234
weights.
And I don't think that's really true 

388
00:19:57,481 --> 00:20:00,060
because I think the world has at its 
core,

389
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:05,050
it's existentially irrational.
There's too much of that's observed,

390
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:09,600
observed and arbitrary,
but it is perfectly reasonable to draw a

391
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,140
clear distinction between paying 
attention and thinking.

392
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,693
And you know,
western culture is elevated thinking in 

393
00:20:16,231 --> 00:20:19,110
some sense to the,
to the position of the highest dandy.

394
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,033
But I think we've got that wrong.
I think attention is much more powerful 

395
00:20:23,131 --> 00:20:23,964
than thinking and that attention that 
thinking should be the handmaid of 

396
00:20:26,971 --> 00:20:29,280
attention.
Because if you pay attention,

397
00:20:29,281 --> 00:20:33,930
you can pay attention to the things you 
don't know and you can become incredibly

398
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:34,764
powerful if you pay attention to the 
things you don't know because you keep 

399
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:39,120
learning and learning and learning and 
learning.

400
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:39,953
And you know,
there was a new testament injunction 

401
00:20:41,111 --> 00:20:43,080
junction that goes along the lines of,
you know,

402
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,943
it's necessary to love your enemy.
And I actually think that that's an 

403
00:20:47,531 --> 00:20:49,260
existential hint.
You know,

404
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,523
if you listen to people converse,
especially if they're ideologically 

405
00:20:52,811 --> 00:20:55,390
minded,
you have a socialist on one side and the

406
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:59,410
conservative on the other.
All they do is trade platitudes.

407
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,633
There's no discussion.
And the goal of the discussion is to 

408
00:21:04,091 --> 00:21:08,680
humiliate the other person and to prove 
that you're a priority stance is correct

409
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:13,210
and that that person is incapable of 
conceptualizing the world property.

410
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:14,463
It's like

411
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,333
one of the most interesting things about
running into people who think 

412
00:21:19,441 --> 00:21:20,274
differently than you if you pay 
attention instead of thinking is they 

413
00:21:22,471 --> 00:21:24,390
will tell you the weirdest bloody 
things.

414
00:21:24,391 --> 00:21:25,224
You know,
the things you never possibly have 

415
00:21:26,401 --> 00:21:27,600
thought of.
And you know,

416
00:21:27,601 --> 00:21:30,330
it doesn't mean that you have to fall 
over and agree with them immediately,

417
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:33,420
but what the hell difference does it 
make if they don't say what you,

418
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:36,240
you do,
maybe they'll maybe out of 10 statements

419
00:21:36,241 --> 00:21:37,074
the law for you,
one that you wouldn't have 

420
00:21:37,771 --> 00:21:40,620
conceptualized.
And that's the difference between paying

421
00:21:40,621 --> 00:21:45,360
attention and thinking and like people 
love to be paid attention to.

422
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,490
You know,
it's the current currency.

423
00:21:47,491 --> 00:21:52,491
It's human currency is attention and 
attention is unbelievably powerful tool.

424
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,340
You know,
one of the things we'll find out is that

425
00:21:56,341 --> 00:21:57,174
the ancient Egyptians actually 
conceptualized attention as a guard and 

426
00:22:02,251 --> 00:22:03,084
the guard,
they conceptualized attention as was 

427
00:22:04,171 --> 00:22:05,004
horace.

428
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:08,100
And you all know of horse because you've
all seen representations.

429
00:22:08,101 --> 00:22:11,580
Of course the famous Egyptian I the 
single lie,

430
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,423
that's a representation of Horus.
And the Egyptians figured out like for 

431
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,980
Mr Damien's avenue for them,
that the highest human dating,

432
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,003
which is like the most powerful set of 
human attributes is to be associated 

433
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:25,170
with one,
with language use.

434
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,840
The mesopotamians really nailed that.
But,

435
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,833
but even more importantly with the 
capacity to pay attention and watch and 

436
00:22:31,201 --> 00:22:32,034
it's sort of suspension of judgment so 
you don't have to be right or wrong in 

437
00:22:35,311 --> 00:22:36,144
the situation.
All you have to do is pay attention and 

438
00:22:38,611 --> 00:22:39,444
listen and watch,
and then potentially a solution will 

439
00:22:42,511 --> 00:22:43,380
emerge out of that

440
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:44,723
and

441
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:47,803
look,
half our brain is visual cortex 

442
00:22:48,921 --> 00:22:49,940
approximately.
You know,

443
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:53,090
so paying attention were incredible.
Visual animals,

444
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,460
paying attention really matters.
It's harnessing.

445
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,473
That's visual attention in particular,
but that's the harnessing of our most 

446
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,550
fundamental cognitive capacities.
So

447
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:04,901
anyways,
you know,

448
00:23:04,901 --> 00:23:07,480
if you pay attention to things,
you can see what interests you.

449
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,540
And that's also an empirical search in 
some sense,

450
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:11,374
which is quite interesting.
This is part of why I got interested in 

451
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,530
psychodynamic ideas.
It's like there are things that rule the

452
00:23:17,531 --> 00:23:20,470
way that you govern yourself that you 
have no control over.

453
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,630
You can only discover them and one of 
them is what interests you sleep.

454
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,590
So you can't really force it if you're 
not interested in something.

455
00:23:27,591 --> 00:23:28,121
It's like,
well,

456
00:23:28,121 --> 00:23:29,920
good luck trying to make yourself 
interested.

457
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,173
Sometimes you can do it to some degree,
but more particularly what seems to 

458
00:23:34,091 --> 00:23:34,924
happen is that your interest highlights 
things for you and then you follow that 

459
00:23:37,991 --> 00:23:39,790
around like you're following up,
you know,

460
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:40,703
a search beam or something like that.
And to me that indicates the action of 

461
00:23:44,651 --> 00:23:45,484
very,
very deep underlying psychobiological 

462
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,390
systems that in some sense or directing 
your consciousness,

463
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,900
you know,
if you pay attention to that process,

464
00:23:53,901 --> 00:23:55,760
you can also learn a tremendous amount 
from that.

465
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:58,420
Like what you're actually like,
you know,

466
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,260
what are you interested in,
where,

467
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,960
where is your being trying to manifest 
itself.

468
00:24:02,961 --> 00:24:06,380
That's another way of thinking about it.
So those are all things that we're going

469
00:24:06,381 --> 00:24:07,214
to try to figure out because I would 
also say that if you're capable of 

470
00:24:09,441 --> 00:24:12,620
allowing your true being to manifest 
itself,

471
00:24:12,621 --> 00:24:13,454
so that would be your potential.
That's also the best source you have of 

472
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:21,620
the kind of weaponry that you need to 
defend yourself against the inequalities

473
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:24,230
and tragedies and horrors of life.
Because you can,

474
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:29,330
you can reveal yourself in a sense by 
pursuing what's illuminated for you.

475
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,270
And I can't tell you whether or not 
that's true,

476
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:33,104
but it's a powerful idea and it's a very
old idea and I think there's plenty of 

477
00:24:38,031 --> 00:24:43,031
evidence that at least it is a.
You say it's plausible.

478
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:45,690
Yes,
it's,

479
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:46,820
it's,
it's more than that.

480
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,460
It's but plausible will do because I 
can't think of a better word,

481
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,313
intimate,
but it's,

482
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:51,620
it's,
it's,

483
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:55,520
it's a hypothesis that has enough 
potential that it might be worth testing

484
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,410
and I would like you to test that sort 
of thing.

485
00:24:57,411 --> 00:25:00,710
Like one of the things that I really 
encourage students in this class to do,

486
00:25:00,711 --> 00:25:01,544
and you can start doing this right away,
is pay attention to what you hear 

487
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:07,100
yourself saying.
I just watch.

488
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,233
Pull yourself into to detach yourself 
from your ideas and thoughts and watch 

489
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:17,180
what you say and at the same time that 
you watch what you say,

490
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,433
watch how you feel when you say what you
say and what I'd like you to try to 

491
00:25:22,161 --> 00:25:22,994
detect is you'll notice if you start 
noticing that some of the things that 

492
00:25:26,301 --> 00:25:27,134
you say make you feel strong and 
together and united and other things 

493
00:25:30,201 --> 00:25:31,034
that you say make you feel disunited and
week and then I would say quit saying 

494
00:25:35,061 --> 00:25:35,894
the ones that make you feel disunited 
and weak because they're false and what 

495
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,520
and what you're picking up by the loss 
of strength associated with that address

496
00:25:43,521 --> 00:25:44,930
is the fact that you're.

497
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:45,740
You're,
you're.

498
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,573
There's something rotten in the state of
Denmark with regards to that use of 

499
00:25:50,601 --> 00:25:52,250
language.
It's manipulative.

500
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,320
You're,
you're trying to appear smarter than you

501
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:55,820
are.
You're trying to prove a point.

502
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:56,654
You're trying to avoid something like 
there's some game you're playing that's 

503
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,193
other than merely stating what you see 
to be true at that moment and like 

504
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,230
that's a different way to live.
You know,

505
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,064
because you can,
you can calculate and you can plan and 

506
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:12,560
planning is useful.
I have nothing against that,

507
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:13,394
but you can manipulate reality so that 
it manifest what you want or you can 

508
00:26:18,531 --> 00:26:19,364
decide that what you're going to do is 
pay attention and to call things as you 

509
00:26:22,971 --> 00:26:26,240
see them and to see what happens if you 
do that.

510
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,340
And they're like,
that's a real risk,

511
00:26:28,341 --> 00:26:29,174
right?
Because you don't know where that's 

512
00:26:30,141 --> 00:26:30,974
going to take you.
So that's an act of faith in the 

513
00:26:32,481 --> 00:26:36,200
character guardian sense.
So like if you have faith in the truth,

514
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:38,510
what that means is that you will say the
truth,

515
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,660
and that's a hard thing to do.
Know.

516
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,310
It doesn't mean that you can say 
whatever you want you want regardless of

517
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:48,630
the effect on other people or that you 
can use the truth as a baseball bat,

518
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:52,050
which you can certainly do.
It's sophisticated.

519
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,453
It's,
it requires a tremendous amount of 

520
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:55,650
sophisticated,

521
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,013
um,

522
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:01,870
it requires a tremendous amount of 
sophistication.

523
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:05,440
But you know,
one thing you might think about is,

524
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,760
well,
if you're,

525
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:11,980
if you are attempting to make yourself a
mouthpiece of the truth,

526
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,840
you have reality on your side

527
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:17,060
and then you might say,
well,

528
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:18,763
could you possibly have anything more 
powerful on your side in reality and so 

529
00:27:23,361 --> 00:27:24,194
it might not be a reality you want,
or the thing that you would wish for 

530
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,700
what you might think,
well you know,

531
00:27:28,701 --> 00:27:32,150
if you,
if you called things as you saw them and

532
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:32,984
you were very careful about that,
maybe that would lead you through life 

533
00:27:35,991 --> 00:27:36,824
properly.
It's a very different way of thinking 

534
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,633
and it is tied with this idea that 
there's something fundamental about the 

535
00:27:43,491 --> 00:27:45,140
truth.
So I would say to start this,

536
00:27:45,141 --> 00:27:48,230
if you want,
just pay attention to what you say.

537
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:51,110
You know when,
when like you're detached from it.

538
00:27:51,111 --> 00:27:51,944
So don't identify too much with what 
you're saying because that's another 

539
00:27:54,291 --> 00:27:56,870
thing that people do.
They identify with what they think.

540
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,263
It's like,
what makes you think that you're 

541
00:27:59,001 --> 00:28:02,120
thinking?
It's like one of the things you said,

542
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,700
which I really love that he blew me.

543
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:06,320
It just,
it just slapped me when I first read it.

544
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,440
He said,
people do not have ideas,

545
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,100
ideas have people,
and so,

546
00:28:13,101 --> 00:28:13,934
you know,
I listened to ideologues talk all the 

547
00:28:15,321 --> 00:28:18,080
time.
It's like damn talking in some dead,

548
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,780
dead spirit of the past,
you know,

549
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:21,823
voicing an opinion through them and you 
can tell when you're talking to someone 

550
00:28:24,471 --> 00:28:26,780
like that because you can predict 
everything you're going to say.

551
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:31,520
So in what sense is that them talking?
It isn't them talking at all,

552
00:28:31,521 --> 00:28:34,570
at some collective.
It's a collective voice that,

553
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,270
that,
that has appropriated them and convinced

554
00:28:38,271 --> 00:28:41,610
them that it's actually part of them.
It's like,

555
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,640
no,
that's the devil.

556
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,340
That's what that is.
So,

557
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:47,563
so we'll just watch it.
You can try this experimental on your 

558
00:28:49,581 --> 00:28:51,260
own,
tried for a month,

559
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:56,150
detach yourself from what you say and 
think and notice when you say something,

560
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:56,984
if it makes you feel more grounded and 
powerful or weaker and stop saying 

561
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:03,140
things that make you weak.
So you know,

562
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,103
that's,
that's sort of like Ed's essential test 

563
00:29:05,571 --> 00:29:07,540
number one.
So.

564
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:11,240
Well it must be just about four x four 
or three.

565
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,343
So then I'll see you all next Wednesday,
take a look at the website and I would 

566
00:29:16,311 --> 00:29:18,830
say start those exercises or at least 
check them out.

567
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:19,723
Okay.
