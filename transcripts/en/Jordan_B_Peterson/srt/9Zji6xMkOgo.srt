1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,390
So today we're going to talk about
Freud.

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,470
Freud is probably perhaps the most
controversial of the psychological

3
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:17,090
theory risers that we're,
that we've been discussing in the,

4
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:21,040
in the first part of this course.
Um,

5
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,450
I don't know what it is about Freud
exactly.

6
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:26,910
People really like to give him a rough
time,

7
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:30,870
even though it's quite clear that many
of the things we take for granted as

8
00:00:30,871 --> 00:00:34,380
psychologist today,
we're first introduced into the public

9
00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:38,400
realm of knowledge by Freud.
Now Freud would say that the reason that

10
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:43,401
people are so upset with his theorizing
is that they don't like the implications

11
00:00:44,341 --> 00:00:49,320
of what he says and that he could have
predicted that as a consequence of his

12
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:52,440
theory because Freud talks about things
that people don't really like to talk

13
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:53,700
about.
And,

14
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:56,970
uh,
I think there's a lot of truth to that.

15
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,640
I also think that Ford was one of those
people who was

16
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,660
right at some levels of analysis and not
so right.

17
00:01:06,661 --> 00:01:08,030
It others.
But,

18
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,350
but I would say that even where he
wasn't right,

19
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:11,790
he was helpful,
he wrong.

20
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,350
And a theory can be helpfully wrong if
it's better than the theory that it

21
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:18,270
replaced.
Just like a

22
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,160
hammer is a better tool for chopping
down a tree than a ranch.

23
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,590
It's not as good as an ax.
But,

24
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,310
but if you conceptualize conceptual
schemes as tools,

25
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,340
then you can also understand how a
better tool is an improvement even

26
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:38,730
though it's not necessarily right.
And a lot of the clinical theories are

27
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,510
quite tool like given that they're
applied to the problems of,

28
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,710
of poor mental health.
So,

29
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,180
and I don't really think of clinical
psychology precisely as a science

30
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:54,420
because it's an applied science and that
makes it more like a form of

31
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:57,810
engineering.
I mean it can be based on scientific

32
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,060
insight,
which,

33
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,350
and it appropriately is,
but it straddles,

34
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:08,040
as we've discussed,
the space between value in science.

35
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:11,010
And so the theories have to be

36
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,840
hybrid.
A strange hybrid.

37
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,840
I'm gonna play you a little recording
and this is the only recording that was

38
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:19,730
ever made of Freud.
Strangely enough.

39
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,620
I mean the recording technology was
there,

40
00:02:21,621 --> 00:02:23,750
but it's only a minute and 23 seconds
long.

41
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,200
So I'll play that and then we'll do a
fairly comprehensive job of walking

42
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:33,470
through Freud's theory.
And then on Tuesday I'm going to show

43
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:38,471
you some movie clips because it like as
with young,

44
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,480
one of the best ways to understand Freud
is to actually see some examples of what

45
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:47,220
he was talking about.
Now those examples are hard to come by.

46
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:48,021
It has,
it turns out,

47
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:52,190
but I have a movie that there is a
movie.

48
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,550
I should rephrase that.
That does a great job of it.

49
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:56,840
Really a great job.
So,

50
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,670
okay,
so here's the recording.

51
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,770
Whew.
Whew.

52
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,660
Whew,
whew,

53
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:49,740
whew,
whew,

54
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,440
whew,
whew.

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Mine.
Why?

56
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,530
Okay.
So I'm going to give you some historical

57
00:05:00,531 --> 00:05:03,680
background so that you can understand
the context within which Freud was

58
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:05,780
operating.
Now the reason I'm going to do this

59
00:05:05,781 --> 00:05:06,800
because you might think,
well,

60
00:05:06,801 --> 00:05:10,310
why is the history necessary?
And part of the reason it's necessary is

61
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:15,311
because
mental disorders such as they are,

62
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:22,810
have a sociological element.
And so you might,

63
00:05:23,211 --> 00:05:28,211
you might think about it this way,
the human brain is obviously predisposed

64
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:33,620
to learn languages.
So there's a biological substrate for

65
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:35,840
language learning.
We don't really understand it.

66
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,990
You can think of it as a capacity,
although that doesn't help.

67
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,660
But when you launch a baby into the
world and the baby encounters a

68
00:05:44,661 --> 00:05:47,840
linguistic community,
he or she learns to speak very,

69
00:05:47,841 --> 00:05:50,360
very rapidly,
but the languages are different

70
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,810
depending on the culture and mental
illnesses are like that.

71
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,640
So you can think,
well

72
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:02,270
there can be biological disruption at
one level of analysis.

73
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,090
Sorry about that guys.

74
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,390
There can be biological disruption at
one level of analysis and maybe that

75
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:19,220
biological disruption in some sense is
somewhat constant across cultures,

76
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,460
but then the manner in which the
disturbance manifests itself,

77
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,370
the specific manner is going to be
shaped by the culture.

78
00:06:25,371 --> 00:06:28,760
And then of course,
and this is a Friday and idea because

79
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:32,450
culture battles against the individual
to some degree and so that's sort of the

80
00:06:32,451 --> 00:06:37,451
idea of the Super Ego against the ID.
Then the battle between the individual

81
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:42,800
and culture is going to take forms that
differ with the culture because

82
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:47,801
sometimes in some parks there's going to
be trouble in this society with regards

83
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:53,390
to incorporating one set of drives and
other times there's going to be trouble

84
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:57,170
incorporating another set of drives.
And so for Freud

85
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:04,060
in Freud's time,
sexuality was very heavily,

86
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,070
it was very problematic.
I don't think it's exactly appropriate

87
00:07:09,071 --> 00:07:11,700
to say that it was repressed.
I would say that more,

88
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,320
more that it was extraordinarily
problematic.

89
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:18,370
And the reason for that is that sex is
extraordinarily problematic for all

90
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,220
sorts of reasons.
One of the main reasons is part from

91
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:24,500
pregnancy apart from unwanted pregnancy.
Um,

92
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,850
apart from the passions that sexual
attraction in flames,

93
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:31,720
it's also an incredibly effective vector
for the transmission of disease.

94
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:37,150
And so part of the reason that people
have mixed motives and with regards to

95
00:07:37,151 --> 00:07:39,160
their sexual behavior is because

96
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:46,600
like eating sex is one of those
activities that can also potentially be

97
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:49,660
contaminating.
And one of the things that happened in

98
00:07:49,661 --> 00:07:54,100
the Victorian era was that
when the,

99
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,080
when the Europeans came to North
America,

100
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,980
they carried a variety of different
illnesses,

101
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,240
measles,
mumps,

102
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,130
small smallpox.
Those were very,

103
00:08:03,131 --> 00:08:07,000
very hard on the native American
population and wipe about 95% of it out

104
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:13,770
there is a theory that syphilis was the
reverse gift and then it was brought to

105
00:08:14,021 --> 00:08:18,850
the old world by the new world.
It was the only illness as far as anyone

106
00:08:18,851 --> 00:08:21,130
knows,
that had that particular characteristic.

107
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,230
Anyways,
it was a devastating illness.

108
00:08:23,231 --> 00:08:25,150
Syphilis mean,
um,

109
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:30,160
it was certainly the syphilis problem in
Europe in the late 19 hundreds with

110
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:34,240
certainly as serious as they age crisis
in the 20th century,

111
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,240
which is still to some degree running
out,

112
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:40,390
especially in developing countries,
but is,

113
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,930
has been somewhat controlled.
And so

114
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,130
we're also very,
very rigid gender roles.

115
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,840
And that was pretty true,
I would say around the world until

116
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,230
the 20th century and probably really
until the 1950s or thereabouts when,

117
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:06,270
because it was at the end of the fifties
that the birth control pill was invented

118
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:12,080
and the birth control pill was what
propelled the political movements that

119
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,410
facilitated the movement of women into
the workplace and on mass by the 1970s.

120
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:21,870
I mean people like to attribute that to
political,

121
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:25,560
to political pressure,
but without the biological

122
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:27,480
transformation,
that political pressure would have been

123
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:29,070
pointless.
So,

124
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,350
so I think it's hard for modern people
to understand how problematic sex was

125
00:09:34,351 --> 00:09:36,400
for the victorians.
Um,

126
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:42,590
there's a conflict between propagation
of the species and the happiness and

127
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:45,990
health of the,
of a particular individual.

128
00:09:45,991 --> 00:09:49,680
And it's a difficult
problem to solve,

129
00:09:49,681 --> 00:09:52,080
especially because children are
dependent for so long.

130
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:58,140
So
this is from on [inaudible] who wrote a

131
00:09:58,141 --> 00:09:59,610
great book.
If you're really interested in

132
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:02,310
psychoanalytic thought,
this is the best book you can read as an

133
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:02,820
introduction.

134
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,920
That's called the discovery of the
unconscious.

135
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,760
Um,
and a lot of what I'm going to tell you

136
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:11,700
about Freud,
although I've read a fair bit of Freud,

137
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,690
I took from the discovery of the
unconscious because it's re it's

138
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:19,650
regarded as the best scholarly work that
was ever done on the history of the

139
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:23,940
psychoanalytic movement and also on
Freud and young and Adler.

140
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:26,760
And so Alan Jay,
who is an existential psychotherapist

141
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,390
who lived in Montreal at least when he
was older

142
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:37,040
at produced a very even handed
historical representation of the

143
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:42,150
precursors to the idea of the
unconscious and then a Freud's theories

144
00:10:42,151 --> 00:10:43,800
and young's theories and Adler's
theories.

145
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,950
So,
so here's what the world was like.

146
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:52,200
It was a world shaped by man for man in
which women occupied the second place.

147
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:54,210
Political Rights for women did not
exist.

148
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,410
The separation and dissimilarity of the
sexist was sharper than today.

149
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,580
Women who wore slacks or wore their hair
shorter smoked were hardly to be found.

150
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:08,060
The university's admitted no female
students until the early 1890s man's

151
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:11,850
authority over his children and also
over his wife was unquestioned.

152
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:16,530
Education was authoritarian.
The despotic father was a common figure

153
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,790
and was particularly conspicuous only
when he became extremely cruel.

154
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,730
Laws were more repressive,
delinquent youth,

155
00:11:23,731 --> 00:11:27,660
sternly punished and corporal punishment
was considered indispensable.

156
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,680
Sexual repression,
supposedly characteristic of the

157
00:11:31,681 --> 00:11:35,370
Victorian psyche was often merely the
expression of two facts,

158
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:39,090
the lack of diffusion of contraceptives
in the fear of venereal disease.

159
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,110
Now there's another issue as well
because because employment

160
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,420
opportunities,
we are extraordinarily limited for women

161
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:48,150
for a variety of reasons.
It was also very,

162
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:52,350
very problematic if a woman became
pregnant outside of wedlock.

163
00:11:52,351 --> 00:11:57,351
And the other thing really necessary to
understand is that people in the late 18

164
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,800
hundreds didn't have very much money.

165
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,950
You know,
even in the civilized world,

166
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:05,920
so to speak,
in the late 18 hundreds,

167
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,160
the average amount of money in today's
terms that people lived on was about a

168
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,980
dollar a day.
So it's almost impossible for us to

169
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:18,130
imagine how much wealthier we are now
than then.

170
00:12:18,131 --> 00:12:22,060
People were only 120 years ago.
So,

171
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,750
so there were three factors that made
sexuality difficult to integrate.

172
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:28,570
One was the,
the sheer danger of pregnancy for women.

173
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,790
Um,
and then disease.

174
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,250
And then the fact,
well,

175
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,250
the fact associated with that,
that we're no contraceptives,

176
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,460
venereal disease was all the more
dangerous because of the great spread of

177
00:12:39,461 --> 00:12:43,510
prostitution and because prostitutes
were almost invariably contaminated and

178
00:12:43,511 --> 00:12:45,550
therefore potential sources of
infection.

179
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,000
We can hardly imagine today how
monstrous syphilis appeared to people of

180
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:53,110
that time made worse by the fact that it
was likely to be transmitted to the next

181
00:12:53,111 --> 00:12:56,470
generation in the form of hereditary
syphilis,

182
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:58,480
which in turn had become a nightmarish
myth.

183
00:12:58,481 --> 00:13:02,470
And to which many physicians attributed
all diseases of unknown origin while in

184
00:13:02,471 --> 00:13:07,471
syphilis was was andy is a particularly
problematic pathogen because it produces

185
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:13,051
a massive range of symptoms.
And so there's no telling what form it

186
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:15,940
will necessarily take in one victim
compared to another.

187
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:21,390
So
the victorians had no shortage of

188
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:25,150
reasons to be in serious conflict about
sexuality.

189
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,420
Now,
Freud was also very much influenced by

190
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:35,000
niches.
Ellenberger g says that psychoanalysis

191
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,680
belongs to that unmasking trend.
The search for hidden unconscious

192
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:42,670
motivations characteristic of the 1880
[inaudible] 1890s in freud as a

193
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,510
Nietzsche words and deeds are viewed as
manifestations of unconscious

194
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:49,300
motivations,
mainly of instincts and conflicts have

195
00:13:49,301 --> 00:13:52,840
instincts for both men.
The unconscious is the realm of the

196
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:55,000
wild,
brutish instincts that cannot find

197
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,700
permissible.
Outlets derive from earlier stages of

198
00:13:57,701 --> 00:14:01,120
the individual and of mankind and find
expression in passion,

199
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,010
dreams,
and mental illness.

200
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:03,911
Now,
you know,

201
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:05,250
it seems to me,
and I,

202
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:09,220
I don't know if it's,
if it also seems to you that these are

203
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:14,221
sorts of things that we take for granted
now that people don't always say what

204
00:14:14,861 --> 00:14:18,550
they mean,
that their speech and their actions are

205
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:21,640
unfleet influenced by factors,
that they're not necessarily conscious

206
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:25,360
of.
That some of the drives or the

207
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:30,361
motivational states that people that are
characteristic of people influenced the

208
00:14:31,091 --> 00:14:34,480
manner in which they speak influenced
their dreams and influence their actions

209
00:14:34,481 --> 00:14:36,250
in ways that are difficult to discover.

210
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:42,070
And that passions and dreams and mental
illnesses are manifestations of the

211
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:45,550
unconscious.
And so you see what happens to a thinker

212
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,210
whose ideas are rapidly integrated into
the culture.

213
00:14:49,211 --> 00:14:52,490
And that was the case with Freud despite
the fact that he said there was great

214
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,910
resistance and there was,
but I mean the idea is that he put

215
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:58,220
forth,
we're integrated into into Western

216
00:14:58,221 --> 00:15:01,980
culture during his lifetime,
which is a staggeringly fast from

217
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,510
historical perspective.
When you absorb a great thinkers,

218
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:09,060
ideas and those become axioms.
Now they're,

219
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,720
they're,
they're what people assume then all

220
00:15:11,721 --> 00:15:14,900
that's really left of what their thing
they think is what's the error,

221
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,060
right?
Cause the errors of course don't become

222
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:19,790
incorporated and then the thinker just
gets blamed for his errors.

223
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,370
So and that's certainly something that
happened to Freud.

224
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:28,010
Even the term id which actually means it
originates from niches,

225
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,700
the dynamic concept of mind with the
notions of mental energy,

226
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,440
Quanta of latent or inhibited energy or
release of energy or transfer from one

227
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:40,750
drive to another is also to be founded
in each year before Freud nature

228
00:15:40,751 --> 00:15:44,810
conceived the mind as a system of drives
that can collide or be fused into one

229
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:45,644
another.

230
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,160
Okay.

231
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,920
In contrast to Freud,
however neat,

232
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,500
did not give prevalence to the sexual
drive whose importance he duly

233
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:54,990
acknowledged,
but too aggressive and self destructive

234
00:15:54,991 --> 00:15:58,470
drives need.
She also understood those processes that

235
00:15:58,471 --> 00:16:00,360
the Freud Ian's called defense
mechanisms,

236
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:05,570
particularly sublimation to sublimate.
Something is to take a form of energy

237
00:16:05,971 --> 00:16:07,650
like sexual energy,
let's say,

238
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:08,850
and,
and,

239
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:13,610
and pour it into something else.
Now the sublimation ideas,

240
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,590
very interesting.
One because for Freud it was more of an

241
00:16:16,591 --> 00:16:19,150
individual issue.
So if,

242
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,010
if,
uh,

243
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:23,370
one,
once he thought of Sexual Energy Libido

244
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,920
as,
as a kind of in some sense of free

245
00:16:25,921 --> 00:16:28,860
energy was a source of energy that the
psyche could use.

246
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,830
And because it was in some sense of free
source of energy,

247
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,890
it could be channeled into other
activities.

248
00:16:34,891 --> 00:16:36,150
And so,
you know,

249
00:16:36,151 --> 00:16:40,620
one of the obvious examples of that
would be paintings of nudes for example,

250
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,490
um,
or into creativity in general.

251
00:16:44,491 --> 00:16:46,740
And,
and Freud actually believed that the

252
00:16:46,741 --> 00:16:50,580
reason that people became civilized was
because we learned how to sublimate our

253
00:16:50,581 --> 00:16:53,160
instinctual energies into,
um,

254
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:58,020
forms of activity and thought that were,
that were acceptable in the social

255
00:16:58,021 --> 00:16:59,370
community.
Now,

256
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,700
the funny thing about the idea of
sublimation is that I think it actually

257
00:17:02,701 --> 00:17:05,170
works better as a phylogenetic,
um,

258
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,430
hypothesis then as an entouch genetic
hypothesis.

259
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,270
So,
and here,

260
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,110
here's why.

261
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,943
MMM.

262
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,200
It is certainly the case that one of the
reasons that people are creative,

263
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:22,440
especially one of the reasons that men
are creative is because if a man is

264
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:26,170
successfully creative and that makes him
successful,

265
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,950
the probability that he's going to have
a wider choice of mates,

266
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:34,900
or at least the possibility of what he
might consider a higher quality mate

267
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,980
goes up immensely.
And that's partly because women,

268
00:17:38,981 --> 00:17:41,830
unlike their closest biological
relatives,

269
00:17:41,831 --> 00:17:46,780
which are the chimpanzees are extremely
selective maters and women tend to mate

270
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:50,110
across and up dominance hierarchies.
And,

271
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,680
and this looks like a biological
propensity.

272
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,870
It's the case for women all around the
world.

273
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,860
It's also as far as we can tell,
the source of the rapid expansion of

274
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:01,920
human creative ability and intelligence.
It's,

275
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,120
it's true just as much in egalitarian
societies as it is in societies that are

276
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:08,280
extremely unequal.
Um,

277
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,620
and it's also one of the major causes
now of income inequality.

278
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,980
Because one of the things that's
happened is that as women have become

279
00:18:18,981 --> 00:18:22,040
educated,
like educated men will marry on educated

280
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:25,490
women,
but educated women will not marry on

281
00:18:25,491 --> 00:18:27,680
educated man.
And so one of the,

282
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,900
one of the,
one of what's what's happened as we've

283
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:34,901
transformed our society increasingly
into an intellectual meritocracy that

284
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:38,330
also allows the contribution of
conscientiousness,

285
00:18:38,331 --> 00:18:42,200
is that we've getting assorted of mating
between smart and conscientious people

286
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,410
at the upper strata of the socioeconomic
distribution.

287
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:49,940
And the estimates now are that about 25%
of its income inequality in North

288
00:18:49,941 --> 00:18:52,020
America as a consequence of,
of,

289
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:56,000
of the fact that women will only meet
across or up dominance hierarchies.

290
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:59,060
So they won't,
they're looking for someone who is at

291
00:18:59,061 --> 00:19:01,700
least as competent as they are or more
competent.

292
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,090
So depending of course on what you mean
by competent,

293
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,220
whereas men are not the correlation
between women socioeconomic status and

294
00:19:10,221 --> 00:19:12,440
their mating opportunity.
Is it slightly negative?

295
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:16,220
The correlation between men
socioeconomic status and their mating,

296
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:20,360
uh,
potential so to speak is about 0.5 0.6

297
00:19:20,361 --> 00:19:23,690
like that's a massive difference.
It's an unbelievably massive difference

298
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:27,320
and has very powerful sociological
consequences.

299
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,450
Nature well understood.
Those processes that have been called

300
00:19:31,451 --> 00:19:35,980
defense mechanisms by Freud,
particularly sublimation repression and

301
00:19:35,981 --> 00:19:40,120
the turning of instincts towards oneself
both give a new expression to did arose

302
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:43,900
old assumption that modern man is
afflicted with a peculiar in illness

303
00:19:43,901 --> 00:19:47,530
bound up with civilization because of
civilization demands of man,

304
00:19:47,531 --> 00:19:50,410
that he renounced the gratification of
his instincts.

305
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:54,020
Now.
So for Freud and and for neat shed,

306
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,750
they,
they both,

307
00:19:55,751 --> 00:19:58,990
they both adopted a perspective that was
different from that of piaget.

308
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:03,520
And I think piaget was actually correct
for Freud,

309
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:09,010
the individuals striving upwards to
manifest their true nature,

310
00:20:09,011 --> 00:20:11,530
which is in some ways can be quite
brutish.

311
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,280
And what the Superego is doing,
what society is doing is actually

312
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,860
inhibiting.
It's stopping it from happening.

313
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,240
So it's basically,
it's,

314
00:20:19,241 --> 00:20:24,010
it's as if society puts each individual
into a jail cell of sorts and only

315
00:20:24,011 --> 00:20:26,770
allows them to do certain things within
that cell.

316
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,900
Now you can certainly understand that.
And I,

317
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:33,370
I think that is true.
The more tyrannical as society becomes.

318
00:20:33,371 --> 00:20:37,210
And as Ellen Borchez pointed out,
Victorian society was quite

319
00:20:37,211 --> 00:20:41,140
authoritarian.
And the more authoritarian a society,

320
00:20:41,141 --> 00:20:44,620
the more there is a struggle between the
individual attempting to be an

321
00:20:44,621 --> 00:20:48,940
individual and the culture attempting to
turn into an absolutely predictable cog

322
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:50,830
in a machine.
But you know,

323
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:55,270
pier,
so Freud of course viewed the primary

324
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:59,650
conflicts and mental life as the ego
tortured by the end in some sense,

325
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,720
right?
Being driven by underlying biological

326
00:21:01,721 --> 00:21:05,820
forces but also severely inhibited and
repressed by the Super Ego.

327
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,510
Um,
you know,

328
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,170
it's a,
it's,

329
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:11,770
it's a,
it's a,

330
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:16,771
if it's a perfectly persuasive model and
there are situations under which it's

331
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,530
more applicable,
but piaget's idea that

332
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:29,290
the fundamental conflict within people
isn't necessarily social versus the

333
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:30,800
individual.
For Piaget,

334
00:21:30,801 --> 00:21:35,480
the fundamental conflict was between
motivational systems and then between

335
00:21:35,481 --> 00:21:38,420
their expression across time,
within the individual,

336
00:21:38,421 --> 00:21:41,420
and then between their expression across
time,

337
00:21:41,421 --> 00:21:45,710
within the individual in relationship to
all other individuals and to society.

338
00:21:45,711 --> 00:21:50,711
So it was more like a complex problem
that could be solved by a civilized game

339
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:55,850
than it was a massive force.
That being the Super Ego crushing the

340
00:21:55,851 --> 00:22:00,620
individual into submission.
Now you might say that for neurotic

341
00:22:00,621 --> 00:22:02,900
people,
and neurotic is a strange word,

342
00:22:02,901 --> 00:22:05,060
but we'll say for the sake of,
of,

343
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:08,120
of argument right now that a neurotic
person who is,

344
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:12,290
it's suffering sufficiently from the
conditions of their life for

345
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:16,700
psychological reasons,
that their life is not bearable in its

346
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:19,550
current form.
They're suffering enough to interfere

347
00:22:19,551 --> 00:22:22,170
with their own movement forward.
Um,

348
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,020
what Freud says about the ego versus the
superego might well be true in the case

349
00:22:28,021 --> 00:22:31,650
of people who aren't well adapted
because they haven't been able to

350
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,680
organize their own motivational drives
in a stable manner within themselves and

351
00:22:37,021 --> 00:22:40,980
then they haven't been socialized
effectively so that they can fit into

352
00:22:40,981 --> 00:22:45,870
the broader community like,
like a dancer might in a complex dance,

353
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:51,000
then they're much more likely to
experience the social world versus them,

354
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,100
especially if they're rejected.
And,

355
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:56,490
and,
and they can't gratify any of their

356
00:22:56,491 --> 00:23:00,900
fundamental needs because they're,
because of their inability or their

357
00:23:00,901 --> 00:23:03,780
awkwardness.
So I would say to the degree that you're

358
00:23:03,781 --> 00:23:06,540
suffering from,
from failure,

359
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,520
so to speak,
for one reason or another,

360
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:13,521
you're much more likely to see s the
social rules as a harsh and repressive

361
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:15,990
superego.
Obviously they're not doing you any

362
00:23:15,991 --> 00:23:18,000
good.
I would say that's probably more likely

363
00:23:18,001 --> 00:23:21,510
to happen if you're somewhat near the
bottom of a given dominance hierarchy.

364
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:24,930
And that also means if you're at the
bottom of a given dominance hierarchy,

365
00:23:24,931 --> 00:23:29,931
that you're more much more likely to
consider the spirit of the structure as

366
00:23:30,091 --> 00:23:33,840
an authoritarian spirit and a repressive
spirit because obviously it isn't making

367
00:23:33,841 --> 00:23:37,020
room for you.
And sometimes of course that's the case.

368
00:23:37,021 --> 00:23:40,170
You know what I mean?
There's lots of societies where everyone

369
00:23:40,171 --> 00:23:45,171
at the bottom has nothing and only the
people at the top have something you and

370
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,810
it's,
it's hard to see how you could not view

371
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:53,240
the culture slash superego as something
that was harsh and repressive and an

372
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:55,970
authoritarian and crushing under those
circumstances.

373
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,583
So

374
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,900
I also think that it was probably an
idea that was more relevant during the

375
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,910
initial,
during the,

376
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,120
the mid to late stage,
just say of the development of the

377
00:24:12,121 --> 00:24:13,740
industrial revolution.
Because

378
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:20,690
to work in a factory meant something
very different than to work as a

379
00:24:21,031 --> 00:24:22,740
peasant.
First of all,

380
00:24:22,741 --> 00:24:24,270
if you were working in a factory where
you,

381
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:28,440
you became bound by time in a way that
human beings had never been bound by

382
00:24:28,441 --> 00:24:29,430
time.
You know,

383
00:24:29,431 --> 00:24:31,880
we,
we time everything seconds means

384
00:24:31,881 --> 00:24:33,750
something to modern people,
you know.

385
00:24:33,751 --> 00:24:37,890
But it took her a long time for the idea
that,

386
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,330
that the time was of the essence for the
organizing,

387
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,940
organizing of human life.
And a lot of that occurred as people

388
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:49,410
moved into the factories.
And so you can see for example,

389
00:24:49,411 --> 00:24:52,980
the the legacy of that in,
in the modern elementary,

390
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:58,380
in the modern pre university school
systems because that school systems that

391
00:24:58,381 --> 00:25:02,400
most of you attended with their rows of
desks and their buzzers and their bells

392
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:07,401
and their recesses are basically factory
structures that emerged from the

393
00:25:09,181 --> 00:25:12,750
industrial revolution that were
characteristic of the way that working

394
00:25:12,751 --> 00:25:15,200
people who worked in factories organize
their lives.

395
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,410
So the bells that go off between periods
and to announce that it's noon and to

396
00:25:19,411 --> 00:25:22,200
tell you that school's out,
those are factory bells.

397
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:27,120
And so you can see,
you can see echoes of Freud's idea that

398
00:25:27,121 --> 00:25:31,470
the super ego and the ego and the ID or
in conflict by imagining,

399
00:25:31,471 --> 00:25:34,770
for example,
how difficult it is for a very active

400
00:25:34,771 --> 00:25:37,320
six year old,
especially if they're male,

401
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:42,530
to sit quietly and regulate themselves
by the bell for six or seven hours.

402
00:25:43,591 --> 00:25:45,420
You know,
when they first go to grade one.

403
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,460
And the fact that,
you know,

404
00:25:47,461 --> 00:25:51,660
Freud would say if he was alive,
that the reason that so many people have

405
00:25:51,661 --> 00:25:55,680
attention deficit disorder is because
the demands of the Superego,

406
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:58,260
so to speak,
in the school system are so excessive

407
00:25:58,261 --> 00:26:01,680
that there's the clash produces
pathology.

408
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,590
Now the pathology is obviously defined
by the situation.

409
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:09,630
If you define pathology as being unable
to sit down and pay attention to things

410
00:26:09,631 --> 00:26:12,710
that are deadly boring,
well you should be running around

411
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,540
playing and having fun and wearing
yourself to a frazzle,

412
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,070
then that's pathology.

413
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:20,910
That's attention deficit disorder and
you can treat it with Ritalin.

414
00:26:20,911 --> 00:26:23,610
But that's only because you can treat
anybody with Ritalin.

415
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,400
You know,
as I'm sure many of you know,

416
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,330
so you know,
red is an amphetamine and it makes you

417
00:26:30,331 --> 00:26:33,240
focus more on whatever you happen to be
focused on.

418
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:36,960
Though there's no real evidence that it
provides any boost in academic

419
00:26:36,961 --> 00:26:38,760
achievement over any reasonable amount
of time.

420
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,440
But if you think about it that way,
you see,

421
00:26:40,441 --> 00:26:45,441
you can understand what Freud meant by
this super ego versus ego conflict or

422
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:50,430
the Super Ego ego in conflict.
Attention deficit disorder is a perfect

423
00:26:50,431 --> 00:26:54,150
example of that.
And then the pathology is defined by the

424
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:56,790
circumstance.
If we didn't have schools that are like

425
00:26:56,791 --> 00:26:59,670
the schools we have,
we wouldn't have attention deficit

426
00:26:59,671 --> 00:27:01,500
disorder as a,
as a,

427
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:04,020
as a pathology now.
And people like to think about it as a

428
00:27:04,021 --> 00:27:05,640
scientific category,
you know,

429
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:09,210
it's a disease and it's,
it's uh,

430
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,130
diseases like an objective entity.

431
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:11,701
It's like,
well,

432
00:27:11,701 --> 00:27:13,740
no,
it's not a disease and it's not an

433
00:27:13,741 --> 00:27:17,610
objective entity.
It's a socio cultural construction.

434
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,700
However,
there are certain people who are going

435
00:27:20,701 --> 00:27:23,730
to be more prone to be diagnosed with it
than others.

436
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,990
And that would mostly be,
um,

437
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:31,970
extroverted,
open extroverted kids because they're

438
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:34,140
not going to sit down and shut up
because they can't.

439
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:38,370
They're extremely curious.
And mostly what they want to do is talk

440
00:27:38,371 --> 00:27:40,020
to everyone in play.
Now.

441
00:27:40,021 --> 00:27:44,310
Panksepp Jaak Panksepp Jaak Panksepp
actually has done really interesting

442
00:27:44,311 --> 00:27:48,300
experiments with male rats and he showed
that if you deprive male juvenile rats

443
00:27:48,301 --> 00:27:51,110
of rough and tumble play there,
um,

444
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:58,170
their prefrontal cortex doesn't mature,
which is also a real hats off to

445
00:27:58,651 --> 00:28:03,651
piaget's theory of play as critical for
higher levels of development and that

446
00:28:03,931 --> 00:28:07,560
you can,
you can also inhibit their tendency to

447
00:28:07,561 --> 00:28:10,200
play using Ritalin.

448
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,523
So

449
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,430
it's pretty sad.
It's in fact it's appalling really.

450
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,160
So,
and I see people in my clinical practice

451
00:28:19,161 --> 00:28:22,610
fairly frequently who come in and said,
well they were diagnosed with adhd when

452
00:28:22,611 --> 00:28:24,500
they were like four or whatever.
It's like,

453
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:25,850
great.
You know,

454
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,000
pathetic.
It's pathetic that that happens.

455
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:34,100
Okay.
So a lot of what Freud did was an

456
00:28:34,101 --> 00:28:37,550
analysis of his own fantasies.
And of course we wouldn't consider that

457
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:40,970
necessarily inappropriate methodology
from the scientific perspective.

458
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:43,880
But there's something that you need to
know about the scientific perspective

459
00:28:43,881 --> 00:28:47,990
that people never talk about.
Mostly what you learned about in

460
00:28:47,991 --> 00:28:52,991
psychology when you're being taught
experimental techniques in psychology is

461
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,980
hypothesis testing.
Right?

462
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,400
But no one ever talks to you about
hypothesis generation.

463
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,130
The,
the idea there is that while you have a

464
00:29:01,131 --> 00:29:04,490
hypothesis and then you lay out an
experiment and test it,

465
00:29:04,491 --> 00:29:05,900
it's like,
well yeah,

466
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:11,230
but coming up with a hypothesis to begin
with is like you just don't find them

467
00:29:11,571 --> 00:29:14,000
lying around on the street.
You know,

468
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,760
you have to think the mop.
And so

469
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:21,280
the scientific process is hypothesis
generation.

470
00:29:21,281 --> 00:29:23,590
That's the first part.
And then hypothesis testing.

471
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,790
And then the third part of it is,
um,

472
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:31,270
generalization from the test to the real
world in psychologists never talk about

473
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:34,240
the first step.
They concentrate obsessively on the

474
00:29:34,241 --> 00:29:36,970
second and they ignore the third almost
completely.

475
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,740
So because we just assumed
generalization from lab to the real

476
00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:43,570
world,
we never actually checked to see if

477
00:29:43,571 --> 00:29:46,240
that's true.
And it's very seldom true because the

478
00:29:46,241 --> 00:29:50,390
real world tends to be a lot more
complex and difficult and ornery and,

479
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:55,510
and uncooperative than the lab does.
But you don't have to discuss your

480
00:29:55,871 --> 00:29:57,730
hypothesis.
So funny because if you're writing a

481
00:29:57,731 --> 00:30:00,640
scientific paper,
you actually generally falsify your,

482
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,610
you,
you lie about how you came up with your

483
00:30:03,611 --> 00:30:06,020
hypothesis basically because you know
you,

484
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,790
you do a literature review and you show
how your hypothesis is extracted as a

485
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:13,330
logical conclusion from all of this
reading that you've done in the truth of

486
00:30:13,331 --> 00:30:15,250
the matter is,
is you were sitting with your graduate

487
00:30:15,251 --> 00:30:19,390
students in the bar drinking beer and
someone said something funny and then

488
00:30:19,391 --> 00:30:21,220
maybe you thought of something you could
test.

489
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,810
It's like,
you're not going to write that down in

490
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:26,670
your intro,
but nobody's quite funny because you see

491
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,560
it's,
it's quite amusing because we really

492
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:32,980
don't talk about how we generate
hypotheses in our paper.

493
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:36,550
We act as if it's a consequence of
logical,

494
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:39,520
of induction or logical deduction.
And it's not,

495
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,200
it's,
it's very seldom that,

496
00:30:41,201 --> 00:30:43,060
I mean,
sometimes you're reading along and you

497
00:30:43,061 --> 00:30:43,894
think,
oh yeah,

498
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:47,890
that idea and this idea of fit together.
But even then you rarely,

499
00:30:47,891 --> 00:30:50,410
like I've found that often when I have
an idea,

500
00:30:50,411 --> 00:30:52,750
it's what comes from this literature
here.

501
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:57,040
And then from this literature over here
and trying to actually explain how I got

502
00:30:57,041 --> 00:31:00,670
that idea in an introduction.
It's like you can't,

503
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,650
it's just,
you don't have the space.

504
00:31:02,651 --> 00:31:04,550
And so it's quite funny.
I,

505
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,370
I,
I mean,

506
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:10,270
I don't think that it's,
I don't really think that it's a lie.

507
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,430
It's a format,
you know what I mean?

508
00:31:12,431 --> 00:31:13,031
It's a,
it's a,

509
00:31:13,031 --> 00:31:15,220
it's a mode of doing things,
but,

510
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,190
but it has nothing to do with hypothesis
generation and Freud,

511
00:31:21,191 --> 00:31:23,380
you know,
Freud used his imagination and he,

512
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,170
and he,
and he used his ability to think.

513
00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:28,360
And so that's both imagined that if
production,

514
00:31:28,361 --> 00:31:31,540
which is basically creativity and then
rationality,

515
00:31:31,541 --> 00:31:34,600
which is logical thinking,
and he generated all sorts of hypotheses

516
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:38,980
and his task wasn't a lab test.
It was a test in practice.

517
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:40,480
So his idea was,
well,

518
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:43,150
I've got this notion,
I'll try laying it out in,

519
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,010
in,
in the therapeutic process.

520
00:31:45,011 --> 00:31:49,210
It'll make observations about how that
plays itself out.

521
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:49,810
Now,
you know,

522
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:53,410
you could consider that relatively weak
methodology from a scientific

523
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,120
perspective.
But I got to tell you something about

524
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:55,990
that too.
So,

525
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,123
you know,

526
00:31:58,810 --> 00:31:59,630
okay,

527
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,610
you may know,
you may not know that there were two

528
00:32:01,611 --> 00:32:06,320
streams of animal experiments,
animal behavioral science in the 20th

529
00:32:06,321 --> 00:32:07,970
century,
then they still exist.

530
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,170
One was behaviorism and other was he
thought energy.

531
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:15,230
Now there's some pretty famous,
he thought logist um,

532
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:20,330
Conrad Laurens was neatologist.
Dickless Tinbergen was an anthologist.

533
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:25,630
Frans de Waal now who studied primates
and mostly primates in the zoo,

534
00:32:25,641 --> 00:32:28,250
mostly chimpanzees,
Jane Goodall.

535
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:32,300
Those people are only theologists.
And what they do is they go out into the

536
00:32:32,301 --> 00:32:35,840
natural habitat of animals,
the blanchards who study rats and their

537
00:32:35,841 --> 00:32:37,880
natural habitat,
or another example.

538
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,830
Um,
it's philosophy,

539
00:32:39,831 --> 00:32:40,664
I think,
who,

540
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,750
who studied gorillas there,
it seemed to be women all the time who

541
00:32:44,751 --> 00:32:47,660
go out into the wilderness and observed
primates.

542
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:48,800
You know,
it's quite interesting.

543
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:50,930
Um,
maybe they're more interested in the

544
00:32:50,931 --> 00:32:53,540
social behavior or something like that,
but it is quite striking.

545
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,390
Anyways,
the thought logist what they do is they

546
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,880
go look at animals behaved in their
natural environment.

547
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,490
And the thing is,
is that you kind of end up with a

548
00:33:01,491 --> 00:33:06,491
narrative description of their behavior.
So it's not as technical as the

549
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:10,670
observations that you produce if you're
working on lab animals.

550
00:33:10,671 --> 00:33:14,030
Right?
But a lab animal and a normal animal are

551
00:33:14,031 --> 00:33:16,120
not really very similar at all.
So,

552
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:19,650
so one of the things you probably don't
know is that win,

553
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,750
win,
win.

554
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:26,000
Skinner was experimenting on rats and
skinner.

555
00:33:26,001 --> 00:33:27,290
He was a smart guy,
man.

556
00:33:27,291 --> 00:33:30,650
We learned a lot from skinner.
He kind of laid the groundwork for the

557
00:33:30,651 --> 00:33:34,490
methods that are used by sophisticated
neuroscientists,

558
00:33:34,491 --> 00:33:37,850
especially those who work with animals.
And they're really the ones who do the

559
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:39,980
work.
He laid down the groundwork for that

560
00:33:39,981 --> 00:33:42,500
sort of investigation.
So it's not like I don't have any

561
00:33:42,501 --> 00:33:44,120
respect for skinner.
It's like he,

562
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:48,170
he knew exactly what he was doing.
He started his damn rats down to three

563
00:33:48,171 --> 00:33:49,790
quarters of their normal body weight.

564
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:55,490
So the Skinnerian rat was first of all,
bitterly lonesome because he lived in a

565
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,980
cage all by himself and that isn't how
rats live.

566
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:03,340
And then he was like starving to death.
So he would work like mad for food.

567
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:06,410
And so what,
what skinner did in some sense was take

568
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:10,550
a complex animal and simplify it,
simplify the hell out of it by making it

569
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:14,660
isolated and starving.
And then he could observe its behavior

570
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,540
under those conditions.
And you could extract a tremendous

571
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,920
amount of information out about how
animals behave by us by using a

572
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:25,130
simplified animal.
But you lose a lot too.

573
00:34:25,131 --> 00:34:29,510
So for example,
it's pretty easy to get starved board

574
00:34:29,511 --> 00:34:34,310
lab rats to take cocaine.
They'll do it or so if you give them

575
00:34:34,311 --> 00:34:35,900
free access to cocaine,
man,

576
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,670
they'll just take it all the time.
They,

577
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:41,180
they won't even eat.
But if you have a raft out there in rat

578
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:41,901
land,
you know,

579
00:34:41,901 --> 00:34:44,120
so that you give them a social
environment and it's,

580
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,020
it's a setup so that it's like a normal
rat would have the rights aren't that

581
00:34:48,021 --> 00:34:49,190
interested in cocaine.

582
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:54,410
So you know,
you can see how the context there is a

583
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,200
major determinant of the outcome.
So Freud,

584
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:00,500
I would think of Freud and all the other
clinicians more as ethan logistics.

585
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:03,050
Then as behavioral scientists,
you know,

586
00:35:03,051 --> 00:35:06,680
and Frans de Waal for example,
he's a great person to read if you

587
00:35:06,681 --> 00:35:08,380
haven't read anything by friends to
wallets,

588
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:08,991
F,
R,

589
00:35:08,991 --> 00:35:09,501
a,
n,

590
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:11,060
s,
d,

591
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,350
w,
a,

592
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:13,640
l,
and he's,

593
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:18,730
he's like a piaget Gideon for chimps and
what he's observed over a series of

594
00:35:19,641 --> 00:35:22,550
books,
mostly making observations at the rnm

595
00:35:22,551 --> 00:35:26,630
zoo in the Netherlands,
is the emergence of morality among

596
00:35:26,631 --> 00:35:29,570
chimpanzees as a consequence of their
social interactions.

597
00:35:29,571 --> 00:35:32,200
Now,
it's not that simple because the morale,

598
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:36,110
the ground for morality emerges as a
consequence of the way the chimps

599
00:35:36,111 --> 00:35:38,610
organize themselves into dominant
structures.

600
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:41,580
So there's a sociological element,
but,

601
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:45,390
but by the same token,
the chimps are biologically prepared to

602
00:35:45,391 --> 00:35:48,960
inhabit dominance hierarchies.
So there's a continual interaction

603
00:35:48,961 --> 00:35:52,530
between the social,
the social structuring of the behavioral

604
00:35:52,531 --> 00:35:57,240
patterns in the dominance hierarchy and
the evolutionary success of the chimp.

605
00:35:57,241 --> 00:35:58,500
Because think about it this way,

606
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:02,170
the higher you are in a dominance
hierarchy,

607
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,630
the more likely it is that you're going
to leave offspring.

608
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,190
Well,
so obviously,

609
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:11,310
obviously what that means is that the
more prepared you are biologically to

610
00:36:12,161 --> 00:36:14,680
succeed at a dominance hierarchy,
the more likely you are to be

611
00:36:14,681 --> 00:36:16,810
successful.
And in human beings,

612
00:36:16,811 --> 00:36:18,820
it's a major issue,
especially for men,

613
00:36:18,821 --> 00:36:21,910
because if they're not successful in the
male dominance hierarchy,

614
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:26,050
they do not leave any offspring.
So for example,

615
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,780
that a lot of you won't be able to
believe this,

616
00:36:28,781 --> 00:36:30,910
but if you sit and think about it for a
week,

617
00:36:30,911 --> 00:36:32,740
you'll figure it out.
Because it's true.

618
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:38,220
You have twice as many female ancestors
as you do mail ancestors.

619
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,930
Now you think,
how can that be possible?

620
00:36:40,931 --> 00:36:43,840
And the answer is the APP,
your average forefather.

621
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:53,250
If every woman has a child,
but only every second man has a child,

622
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,620
then that's exactly what you end up
with.

623
00:36:55,621 --> 00:36:56,880
Every second man,
man,

624
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,430
in that case would have two children.
Right?

625
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,410
But that could easily happen.
So,

626
00:37:01,411 --> 00:37:02,280
for example,
if,

627
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:07,550
if you could imagine a situation where
one man made 10,000 women pregnant.

628
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:09,400
Okay.

629
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,910
And you know,
that's not as much of an impossibility

630
00:37:11,911 --> 00:37:15,130
as he might think.
Then you obviously under conditions like

631
00:37:15,131 --> 00:37:17,020
that you'd have far more female
ancestors,

632
00:37:17,021 --> 00:37:19,240
then you would have male ancestor.
So anyways,

633
00:37:19,241 --> 00:37:20,074
so,

634
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,500
okay,

635
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:27,500
Freud and young and the other clinicians
are basically ethos adjusts and what

636
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:29,910
they're doing is studying human beings
in their route,

637
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,900
relatively natural environment and
trying to figure out how they work.

638
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:39,530
And it isn't obvious to me that
prolonged observation over multiple

639
00:37:41,581 --> 00:37:46,581
years of many people in a clinical
setting where you talk about everything

640
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:50,790
is a less realistic way of gathering
information,

641
00:37:50,791 --> 00:37:55,791
especially for generating hypotheses.
Then assessing 40 undergraduates for 20

642
00:37:57,331 --> 00:37:59,430
minutes in the lab.
You know,

643
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,730
now I think what you get,
what happens is that you can be more

644
00:38:02,731 --> 00:38:06,450
specific in the lab.
So you can do high resolution work in a

645
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:10,560
lab,
but you can do low resolution work as a

646
00:38:10,561 --> 00:38:13,290
clinician.
And I do think that it's at the low

647
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:17,220
resolution levels of theorizing that
most of the hypotheses are generated.

648
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,700
Right?
So these things have to play against one

649
00:38:20,701 --> 00:38:24,510
another and it's,
it's not reasonable to presume that one

650
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:29,511
mode of evidence gathering is superior
to the other in all situations.

651
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,473
So

652
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,490
this is by Freud's Ernest Jones

653
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:41,490
who was a great admirer of Freud and who
really established the ground on which

654
00:38:42,671 --> 00:38:44,890
the history of psychoanalysis was going
to be written.

655
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,113
Um,

656
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:50,400
he's been accused of being too much of
an acolyte and I think there's some

657
00:38:50,401 --> 00:38:53,280
truth in that,
but I guess you pretty behalf to be

658
00:38:53,281 --> 00:38:55,980
pretty interested in someone before
you're going to write their biography so

659
00:38:55,981 --> 00:38:58,980
we shouldn't be too hard on them.
In the summer of 1897,

660
00:38:58,981 --> 00:39:03,270
Freud undertook is most heroic seat a
psychoanalysis of his own unconscious.

661
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,140
It's hard for us nowadays to imagine how
momentous this achievement was.

662
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:10,650
That difficulty being the fate of most
pioneering exploits you up.

663
00:39:10,651 --> 00:39:13,230
The uniqueness of the feet remains once
done.

664
00:39:13,231 --> 00:39:15,690
It has done forever for no one.
Again,

665
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:20,220
it can be the first to explore those
steps and the long history of humanity.

666
00:39:20,221 --> 00:39:24,170
The task had often been attempted.
Philosophers and writers from Salon to

667
00:39:24,171 --> 00:39:28,340
Monteen,
from juvenile to Schopenhauer had essay

668
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:31,730
to follow the advice of the delphic
oracle know thyself,

669
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,570
but it also come to the effort.

670
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:37,290
Inner resistances had borrowed advance
there had from time to time being

671
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:42,030
flashes of intuition to point the way,
but they had always flickered out the

672
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:45,990
realm of the unconscious whose existence
was so often postulated,

673
00:39:45,991 --> 00:39:48,600
remained dark,
and the words of hereclitis still stood.

674
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:52,170
The soul of man is a far country which
cannot be approached or explored.

675
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:56,100
Freud had no help,
no one to assist the undertaking in the

676
00:39:56,101 --> 00:39:58,860
slightest degree,
worse than this.

677
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,490
The very thing that drove him onward,
he must've dimly divined could only

678
00:40:02,491 --> 00:40:06,210
result in profoundly affecting his
relations or perhaps even severing them

679
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:09,370
with the one being to whom he was so
closely bounded who had studied this

680
00:40:09,371 --> 00:40:12,360
mental equilibrium.
It was daring much in risking bunch.

681
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,130
What?
Indomitable courage.

682
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,290
Both intellectual and moral must've been
needed,

683
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,930
but it was forthcoming.
Well,

684
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,213
you know,

685
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,890
yeah.
Really,

686
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:29,850
I mean,
I wouldn't say that prior to Freud and

687
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:34,150
chip
Western civilization in particular,

688
00:40:34,151 --> 00:40:37,600
Western philosophical,
the western philosophical tradition,

689
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:43,350
absolutely overvalued the role that
rationality played in the realm of human

690
00:40:45,071 --> 00:40:46,740
behavior.
You know,

691
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,090
emotions and people still think this
way.

692
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:54,330
Emotions were often considered the enemy
of reason and motivations.

693
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:57,040
Also the enemy of reason.
And you can understand that,

694
00:40:57,041 --> 00:40:59,380
right?
Because your,

695
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:04,470
your observations of a given phenomenon
are going to be biased by the emotions

696
00:41:05,801 --> 00:41:08,170
and the motivations that you bring to
the forefront.

697
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:12,040
And a lot of what scientists we're
trying to do as they learned how to be

698
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:14,260
scientists,
where to get the damn emotions and the

699
00:41:14,261 --> 00:41:18,850
motivations out of the way and the
personal biases system by esis and the

700
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:22,090
demand to,
to elevate your career and to be right

701
00:41:22,091 --> 00:41:24,610
and to beat the other primates and so
forth and so on.

702
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,590
They're trying to clear that out so that
you could,

703
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:29,500
you could attend clearly to certain
classes of phenomena.

704
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:34,501
And then of course
it was a post renaissance phenomena to

705
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:42,580
identify the central being of human
beings with rationality.

706
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,020
And furthermore,
there is also a deeper idea than that,

707
00:41:48,021 --> 00:41:50,210
which,
which we all still fall prey to in many

708
00:41:50,211 --> 00:41:52,640
ways.
And that idea was essentially that human

709
00:41:52,641 --> 00:41:55,880
beings had a soul that was separate from
the body.

710
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:00,740
And so the central nature of the soul
when it was operating properly was

711
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,800
rational.
Now I can understand why humanities

712
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:09,050
always had the idea that people have a
soul and that there's a body,

713
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,590
you know,
I mean I think it's an obvious

714
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:17,030
reflection of the fact that we have an
identifiable consciousness that seems

715
00:42:17,031 --> 00:42:20,030
unique and individual and it's wandering
around in a body,

716
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,580
you know,
and they seem separable in some way.

717
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:27,320
But it wasn't until Freud that people,
I think,

718
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,500
intellectuals,
people who are serious about

719
00:42:30,501 --> 00:42:33,950
understanding the human psyche had to
really grapple with the fact that we

720
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:36,050
were embodied.
And that our,

721
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:38,990
our rationality,
because of the way our rationality

722
00:42:38,991 --> 00:42:43,220
really works is that it doesn't even get
to work until it's pre filtered by

723
00:42:43,221 --> 00:42:46,100
emotions and motivations and the body,
you know.

724
00:42:46,101 --> 00:42:49,760
So you could think about rationality as
the master of the ship,

725
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:50,580
but,
and,

726
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,090
and perhaps that was the way to think
about it before Freud,

727
00:42:53,091 --> 00:42:55,520
but after Freud,
and this is how we think now,

728
00:42:55,521 --> 00:42:56,031
it's like,
no,

729
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:56,330
no,
no.

730
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:59,470
First year a body.
And that screens out most everything

731
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,770
instructors,
what you see.

732
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,200
And then inside that you're a set of
motivations.

733
00:43:03,201 --> 00:43:04,850
You're always motivated one way or
another.

734
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:09,890
And then inside that you're emotionally
evaluating things before they even reach

735
00:43:09,891 --> 00:43:11,390
your rational consciousness.

736
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,270
And then inside that there's a little
rational guy who's,

737
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,250
you know,
trying to zip around and make

738
00:43:16,251 --> 00:43:20,030
intelligent decisions.
But without all that underpinning,

739
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,730
he wouldn't even be able to operate.
And this is,

740
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:26,450
this is right.
This is why the farthest that people

741
00:43:26,451 --> 00:43:30,740
have gone in the pursuit of our
artificial intelligence is with embodied

742
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:33,020
robots,
embodied cognitive agents.

743
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,560
It turns out that you can't have pure
rationality without the body.

744
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:41,590
And so in Freud is you just can't escape
the fact that Freud was the person who

745
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:44,870
was beating the drum for that
perspective for,

746
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:48,140
for 50 years.
And he did it extraordinarily

747
00:43:48,141 --> 00:43:53,090
successfully after Friday.
You could never pretend that you weren't

748
00:43:53,091 --> 00:43:58,000
a sexual being or an aggressive being or
a bias being or an unconscious being or

749
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:00,890
defended being or repressing being are
allying,

750
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:04,820
being while you were doing whatever it
was that you were doing.

751
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,890
And those things had to be taken into
account.

752
00:44:06,891 --> 00:44:08,480
And you know,
it,

753
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:13,590
it wasn't much before Freud that Darwin
came up with his Darwinian hypothesis.

754
00:44:14,211 --> 00:44:15,380
And so,
you know,

755
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,840
it was,
it was exactly at that time that it was

756
00:44:17,841 --> 00:44:22,841
necessary for us to understand our
evolutionary kinship or in some sense

757
00:44:23,931 --> 00:44:28,880
even identity with,
with other creatures ranging from those

758
00:44:28,881 --> 00:44:30,800
that were quite like us to those that
were,

759
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:34,440
are very much unlike us all the way down
the a genetic chain.

760
00:44:34,441 --> 00:44:37,740
There's tremendously important
interrelationships.

761
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:41,430
And so Freud's idea fit into Darwin's
idea like mad,

762
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,170
you know,
all of a sudden human beings,

763
00:44:43,171 --> 00:44:47,220
we're animals.
They weren't a divine soul in a body.

764
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,480
Now the divine soul idea,
it has its merits,

765
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:56,510
but the animal idea has its merits to,
and it was Freud who sort of rub

766
00:44:56,881 --> 00:45:00,810
people's noses in the fact that they
were animals along with Darwin.

767
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:03,750
And that was part of the reason why he
faced such resistance.

768
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:09,140
So
Freud was definitely an ally of the

769
00:45:09,421 --> 00:45:12,780
evolution of the,
of the idea of evolutionary biology.

770
00:45:12,781 --> 00:45:16,950
And I also think he was a real precursor
in many ways or perhaps the

771
00:45:16,951 --> 00:45:19,800
groundbreaker for,
for the development of fields like

772
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:22,170
affect of neuroscience,
which,

773
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:27,320
which you know,
is a relatively new field until well

774
00:45:27,361 --> 00:45:30,480
until the 1960s in psychology,
you weren't even allowed to think that

775
00:45:30,481 --> 00:45:35,481
people thought wasn't until the
cognitive revolution that psychologists

776
00:45:35,831 --> 00:45:38,670
were willing to think that people
thought and that may be animals dead.

777
00:45:38,671 --> 00:45:41,660
I mean everyone else on the bloody
planet knew that people thought,

778
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,980
but the psychologist were refusing to
admit it.

779
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:48,810
And that was because they were using
strictly behavioral propositions in

780
00:45:48,811 --> 00:45:50,730
their lab work.
And there were some real utility in

781
00:45:50,731 --> 00:45:52,920
that.
And the cognitive scientists came along

782
00:45:52,921 --> 00:45:54,700
in the early 1960s and said,
well,

783
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:55,710
hold on a minute.

784
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:58,050
We're not just stimulus response
machines,

785
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:01,050
even though there are levels of analysis
at which we are.

786
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,110
And then it wasn't until much later,
40 years later,

787
00:46:04,111 --> 00:46:07,050
really 30 years later,
more a lot.

788
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,770
As a consequence of the influence of
Russian neuropsychologist as it turns

789
00:46:10,771 --> 00:46:14,400
out that it became self evident that,
well,

790
00:46:14,401 --> 00:46:15,231
yeah,
yeah,

791
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:17,040
I cock cognition,
but you know,

792
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:22,041
what about emotion and what about
motivation and you know,

793
00:46:22,231 --> 00:46:24,750
can we actually study those as
biological properties?

794
00:46:24,751 --> 00:46:27,210
And the answer to that turned out to be,
yeah,

795
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:29,940
we certainly could.
And not only that,

796
00:46:29,941 --> 00:46:34,941
that it's obviously it's obvious that
our higher order cognitive functions are

797
00:46:35,671 --> 00:46:39,480
nested within fundamentally emotional
and motivational systems.

798
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:44,660
And it's also obvious who's in charge.
And it's not the higher order cognitive

799
00:46:45,211 --> 00:46:48,900
functions unless you're blindly naive.
You know,

800
00:46:48,901 --> 00:46:53,040
if even if you look at the brain from a
neuroanatomical perspective,

801
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:58,080
the strength of the projections reaching
up from the base of your brain,

802
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:02,040
from places like the Hypothalamus,
which is the ground of fundamental

803
00:47:02,041 --> 00:47:04,680
motivational systems like aggression and
sexuality,

804
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:09,450
those are like tree trunks,
the little tendrils coming down from the

805
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:12,090
top of your brain that the do the
regulation,

806
00:47:12,091 --> 00:47:13,410
you know,
the conscious regulation,

807
00:47:13,411 --> 00:47:15,000
those are like little vines,
you know.

808
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,290
So as long as you're reasonably satiated
and everything's under control,

809
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,350
you can pretend that your rational mind
is running the show.

810
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,660
But when push comes to shove,
it's like,

811
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:26,250
well,
no,

812
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,230
you know,
and it's also pretty obvious that don't

813
00:47:29,231 --> 00:47:32,860
even really like it when your rational
mind is under control too much because,

814
00:47:32,861 --> 00:47:37,120
and this is again a reflection of the
super ego versus Eagle dichotomies.

815
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,920
You're always running around,
you know,

816
00:47:38,921 --> 00:47:41,950
consuming great amounts of alcohol and
other sorts of,

817
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,420
um,
you know,

818
00:47:43,421 --> 00:47:47,950
consciousness altering substances,
which usually alternate for the worst so

819
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:50,180
to speak,
so that you can do impulsive and crazy

820
00:47:50,181 --> 00:47:53,650
and idiotic things that are really,
really entertaining and fun.

821
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:57,400
So we don't want to forget about who's
in charge.

822
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:03,420
And Freud was and still is a very good
corrective for people who are convinced

823
00:48:05,381 --> 00:48:10,381
that they're rational intellect is the
fundamental element of there being.

824
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,510
Now the,
the,

825
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:17,230
the creation of illness that,
that Jones talked about and it unreal

826
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:22,231
version I talked about is a variant of
the initiation process that we've been

827
00:48:22,421 --> 00:48:24,490
describing.
And one of the things that,

828
00:48:24,930 --> 00:48:29,930
um,
people like Annenberg Jay pointed out is

829
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:34,120
that it's often the case that people who
make great discoveries go through a

830
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:37,240
protracted period of chaos.
Well,

831
00:48:37,241 --> 00:48:40,390
they're making their discoveries before
they put the discoveries together.

832
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,140
And that happened to Darwin for example.
You know,

833
00:48:44,141 --> 00:48:47,050
because Darwin knew perfectly well,
you know,

834
00:48:47,051 --> 00:48:49,270
he's a pretty straight laced Englishman,
whole Darwin.

835
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:51,540
He knew perfectly well that he was
lighting a bomb.

836
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:52,810
It was a big bomb.
I mean,

837
00:48:52,811 --> 00:48:57,760
I think you could safely say that Darwin
was the most revolutionary scientist who

838
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,560
ever lived.
You know,

839
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,540
when I was growing up,
it seemed to be Einstein,

840
00:49:01,541 --> 00:49:03,880
but the old Darwin man,
he's,

841
00:49:03,881 --> 00:49:06,220
he's making a,
he's making his move.

842
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:10,030
And it's especially the case because
Darwin not only outlined natural

843
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:11,080
selection,
which,

844
00:49:11,081 --> 00:49:13,510
you know,
kept biologists busy for a whole hundred

845
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:15,640
years,
but he also outlined sexual selection

846
00:49:15,641 --> 00:49:18,100
and all that.
Biologists ignore that for a hundred

847
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:23,020
years and they're coming back to it now.
So I was hard on old Darwin because he

848
00:49:23,021 --> 00:49:26,950
knew that
the world was going to go from 8,000

849
00:49:26,951 --> 00:49:31,951
years old and created by God to God only
knows how long and the consequence of

850
00:49:32,471 --> 00:49:36,610
somewhat random biological processes,
I mean that's a major league shift in

851
00:49:36,611 --> 00:49:38,080
the old world view.
And you know,

852
00:49:38,081 --> 00:49:41,080
so to the degree that Darwin,
Darwin,

853
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:44,950
his personality was structured both
explicitly and implicitly by,

854
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:48,310
um,
Protestant religious presuppositions,

855
00:49:48,311 --> 00:49:51,280
which it was because in many ways he was
a conventional person.

856
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,800
You know,
he was taking a mighty axe to the basic

857
00:49:53,801 --> 00:49:56,770
trunk of is the,
to the thick trunk of his being.

858
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:58,540
You know,
when he suffered for that,

859
00:49:58,541 --> 00:50:01,000
he had anxiety disorders and it's no
bloody wonder,

860
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:01,834
you know,
I mean,

861
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,730
if you were Darwin and you weren't
nervous,

862
00:50:03,731 --> 00:50:06,850
you wouldn't have had any idea what you
were launching on the world.

863
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,160
It was a massive revolution,
you know,

864
00:50:09,161 --> 00:50:14,110
in Freud's notion that we were deeply
embedded in our animal selves.

865
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:18,940
Also was was the precursor to having
people start to comprehend themselves,

866
00:50:18,941 --> 00:50:20,680
not in terms of,
you know,

867
00:50:20,681 --> 00:50:25,681
the last hundred years of history or the
last 500 years of history or maybe even

868
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:28,670
the entire five years of recorded
history.

869
00:50:28,671 --> 00:50:33,671
But the 7 million years since we've been
separated from our common ancestor with

870
00:50:34,341 --> 00:50:39,341
chimps and the 60 million years since we
were living in trees and the 220 million

871
00:50:39,801 --> 00:50:44,801
years since there were mammals and the
400 million years when our ancestors

872
00:50:45,021 --> 00:50:49,040
were basically lobsters.
And that's a completely different way of

873
00:50:49,041 --> 00:50:51,380
thinking about the world.
And like it's something that we haven't

874
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:54,530
digested yet.
And I would say for Freud was in the

875
00:50:54,531 --> 00:50:57,680
forefront of the,
of the revolution that produced that

876
00:50:57,681 --> 00:51:01,880
transformation and thinking it was also
hard on Freud and that's what Jones is

877
00:51:01,881 --> 00:51:02,510
pointing out.

878
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:06,020
You know,
I mean Freud was definitely an anti

879
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:09,170
religious destroyer like nature,
you know,

880
00:51:09,171 --> 00:51:11,780
he was another announcer of the death of
God.

881
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:14,750
Freud's idea about religion was that it
was a defense.

882
00:51:14,751 --> 00:51:17,230
Anxiety against death,
sorry,

883
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,700
a defense mechanism against death,
anxiety.

884
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,860
You know,
and to the degree that you guys are

885
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,320
being taught terror management theory,
for example,

886
00:51:24,321 --> 00:51:27,740
it's like that's Freud,
straight and simple.

887
00:51:27,741 --> 00:51:30,080
I mean,
terror management theory was developed

888
00:51:30,081 --> 00:51:33,830
by Ernest Becker and Ernest Becker was a
psychoanalyst even though he was

889
00:51:33,831 --> 00:51:38,750
associate sociologist and he wrote the
denial of death in an attempt to update

890
00:51:38,751 --> 00:51:43,340
Friday and presuppositions.
So Freud is by no means dead.

891
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:46,490
And the idea of the associations,
you know,

892
00:51:46,491 --> 00:51:49,670
that people,
people's thinking is associational and

893
00:51:49,671 --> 00:51:53,510
that the associations are actually
linked together by emotional similarity.

894
00:51:53,511 --> 00:51:54,291
It's like,
well,

895
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:58,430
the implicit attitudes,
all of the implicit attitudes,

896
00:51:58,431 --> 00:52:00,500
research is predicated on that idea.

897
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:04,170
They don't ever credit freud with it,
but it was Freud's initial discovery,

898
00:52:04,171 --> 00:52:05,360
you know,
he discovered that,

899
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:08,330
that people's thoughts wondered in a
sense,

900
00:52:08,331 --> 00:52:09,800
you know,
and that you could,

901
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:12,410
you could see why they wondered if you
paid attention.

902
00:52:12,411 --> 00:52:17,411
You could track the underlying rationale
for the connection between sets of

903
00:52:18,111 --> 00:52:21,920
disparate ideas by paying close
attention and you could interpret them.

904
00:52:21,921 --> 00:52:23,930
And that's really what he did with Free
Association.

905
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,960
And I know I would say that I don't
really think for,

906
00:52:26,961 --> 00:52:30,890
I discovered free association.
I think what he did is observed that

907
00:52:30,891 --> 00:52:35,840
many of his severely damaged clients who
I think would have had some variant of

908
00:52:35,841 --> 00:52:38,630
borderline personality disorder if we
would have seen them today.

909
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:42,440
If you just let them talk,
they would free associate.

910
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:45,590
And what that was in some sense it was
the,

911
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:49,190
it was the consequence of the fact that
their personalities had never really

912
00:52:49,191 --> 00:52:50,060
been organized.

913
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,160
And maybe that's because no one had ever
listened to them,

914
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:55,340
you know?
So I can tell you as far as I can see

915
00:52:55,341 --> 00:52:59,990
that people organize their personalities
by talking and if you don't have someone

916
00:52:59,991 --> 00:53:01,040
to listen,
it's like,

917
00:53:01,041 --> 00:53:02,630
well,
you've got all these ideas rattling

918
00:53:02,631 --> 00:53:07,070
around in your head that are basically
rooted in emotion and they're not linked

919
00:53:07,071 --> 00:53:09,980
together by any coherent narrative and
they're not pruned.

920
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:12,170
That's another thing.
You need other people to say,

921
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:15,020
you know,
that's a really stupid way of looking at

922
00:53:15,021 --> 00:53:16,040
things,
you know,

923
00:53:16,041 --> 00:53:17,360
big.
And if you don't have that,

924
00:53:17,361 --> 00:53:19,820
well then,
especially if you've got a reasonably

925
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:22,070
creative mind,
you're going to generate a whole massive

926
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:24,380
counter productive,
you know,

927
00:53:24,381 --> 00:53:28,380
but,
but re but potentially founded ideas

928
00:53:28,381 --> 00:53:30,870
that you just can't call.
So,

929
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:33,930
and Freud figured that out with this
idea of free association.

930
00:53:33,931 --> 00:53:37,260
So we've let people come into his office
and he wouldn't really look at them.

931
00:53:37,261 --> 00:53:38,910
You just let them lie on the couch and
he'd say,

932
00:53:38,911 --> 00:53:40,470
well,
just say whatever comes to mind.

933
00:53:40,471 --> 00:53:45,150
And they'd go wandering around on some
quasi random path.

934
00:53:45,151 --> 00:53:49,950
And Freud would note the connections
between the things they said and infer

935
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:54,180
what the underlying structure was.
And what he was doing was this

936
00:53:54,181 --> 00:53:55,590
essentially.
So look,

937
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:02,860
if let's say you go see a movie and then
your friend says,

938
00:54:02,861 --> 00:54:04,240
well,
what was the movie about?

939
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,870
You don't say,
well the first thing we saw where the

940
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:12,790
credits and then no,
and then you say to your friend all the

941
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:16,090
credits and then you described every
single movement that all the characters

942
00:54:16,091 --> 00:54:17,890
make,
including when they blink their eyes and

943
00:54:17,891 --> 00:54:19,570
how they move their arms.
And it's like,

944
00:54:19,571 --> 00:54:22,630
you don't do that.
You do something really weird and

945
00:54:22,631 --> 00:54:25,570
mysterious,
which is you take the movie and you

946
00:54:25,571 --> 00:54:28,270
break it down,
you boil it down to,

947
00:54:28,271 --> 00:54:30,940
it's just whatever that is.
It's like,

948
00:54:30,941 --> 00:54:32,140
well,
here's the important features of the

949
00:54:32,141 --> 00:54:33,460
movie.
And you say that,

950
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:34,810
say,
here's five minutes summary.

951
00:54:34,811 --> 00:54:35,650
It's like you might ask,
well,

952
00:54:35,651 --> 00:54:38,080
why don't you just listen to the five
minute summary instead of going into the

953
00:54:38,081 --> 00:54:40,630
damn movie.
But the weird thing is is you can do

954
00:54:40,631 --> 00:54:40,960
that.

955
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:41,920
You know,
and you,

956
00:54:41,921 --> 00:54:45,130
you do it without even thinking about
how insanely complex it is.

957
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:47,380
Well,
Freud was doing that with his clients.

958
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:52,480
They'd come in there and like lay out
this massive kind of incoherent verbal

959
00:54:52,481 --> 00:54:57,010
chain and he listened and,
and he'd hint at them perhaps what it

960
00:54:57,011 --> 00:55:00,790
meant and he extract out the gist of the
story.

961
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:06,040
And then if the,
if the advantage to having your memory

962
00:55:06,041 --> 00:55:09,790
reduced to just is that you can only
only have to remember the important

963
00:55:09,791 --> 00:55:11,800
things,
then all of the things that aren't

964
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:14,860
important,
you can let go of,

965
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:17,560
you know,
and you see this happening.

966
00:55:17,561 --> 00:55:19,450
If you,
if you ever have a fight with someone,

967
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:22,690
especially someone that you love,
you know how it happens all the time is

968
00:55:22,691 --> 00:55:26,080
you'll start fighting about something
that's trivial and then both of you,

969
00:55:26,081 --> 00:55:28,900
we'll figure out what we're really not
fighting about that at all.

970
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,490
And then the question is,
well,

971
00:55:30,491 --> 00:55:34,960
what are you fighting about?
And one answer to that is the person who

972
00:55:34,961 --> 00:55:38,410
was the irritating person who started
the argument provoked it say,

973
00:55:38,411 --> 00:55:42,430
because that happens might not even know
what in the world it is that they're

974
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:45,160
irritated about.
You have to kind of torture them to

975
00:55:45,161 --> 00:55:50,161
death for an hour before they can figure
out what it was that drove the

976
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,540
irritation and manifest it in some
articulated form.

977
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:57,393
So

978
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,270
in a sense that's bringing things up
from the depths of the unconscious,

979
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:04,860
you know,
now Freud would have thought of those

980
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,300
things as repressed.
You know,

981
00:56:06,301 --> 00:56:08,790
I don't want to talk about that with you
because I repressed it.

982
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:10,710
I don't really think that's right.
Often.

983
00:56:10,711 --> 00:56:15,711
I think what happens is that irritation
manifests itself in vague moods and you

984
00:56:17,101 --> 00:56:21,390
have to investigate the mood and the
emotion using different articulated

985
00:56:21,391 --> 00:56:23,350
frameworks,
which is kind of what an argument is

986
00:56:23,351 --> 00:56:27,310
about until you stumble across the
actual articulation,

987
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,710
you know,
and so you're being tortured by your

988
00:56:29,711 --> 00:56:33,370
partner for one reason or another.
Maybe it's because for the 50th time you

989
00:56:33,371 --> 00:56:36,820
left the dish rag on the counter or
something and after fighting with them

990
00:56:36,821 --> 00:56:38,410
for an hour,
you figure out that they had a really

991
00:56:38,411 --> 00:56:42,100
bad day at work for reasons that they
didn't really notice and don't want to

992
00:56:42,101 --> 00:56:42,934
talk about.

993
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:46,750
So that's Friday and psychoanalysis.
I mean you guys are,

994
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:49,510
to the degree that you're sophisticated
communicators,

995
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:51,850
you're going to be doing that all the
time.

996
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:53,800
I mean,
how many of you actually believe that

997
00:56:53,801 --> 00:56:57,640
everything a person says is what they
mean or that they have perfectly

998
00:56:57,641 --> 00:57:01,570
transparent self knowledge?
I think no one believes that anymore.

999
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:05,770
Or you know,
if you do believe that well yet hadn't

1000
00:57:05,771 --> 00:57:08,280
been paying attention.
I would say that's really the,

1001
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:12,880
the bottom line.
So these creative illnesses are a

1002
00:57:12,881 --> 00:57:16,930
consequence of this descent.
And rebirth process that we talked about

1003
00:57:16,931 --> 00:57:19,210
before,
and that's much more likely to happen.

1004
00:57:19,211 --> 00:57:21,970
You see,
I marked revolutionary at the top.

1005
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,020
You know,
when you,

1006
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:26,230
when you're a genius,
you blow apart the basic presuppositions

1007
00:57:26,231 --> 00:57:29,440
of an entire culture.
And to the degree that your personality

1008
00:57:29,441 --> 00:57:33,940
is predicated on those assumptions and
maybe even your place in the world,

1009
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:36,760
when you chop that over,
it's like you fall too.

1010
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:40,570
You know,
and the whole idea that Darwin had that,

1011
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:46,030
that the environment itself could modify
biological forms through selection.

1012
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,860
God,
it's such a brilliant idea because,

1013
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,380
well,
because it precisely because it accounts

1014
00:57:50,381 --> 00:57:55,381
for why complex forms can emerge in the
absence of an intelligent designer.

1015
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,093
Now,
you know,

1016
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:00,940
no doubt there are holes in Darwinian
theory.

1017
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,160
You know,
I don't know how many of you know this,

1018
00:58:03,161 --> 00:58:06,700
but there's a whole new field of science
that's popped up really in the 21st

1019
00:58:06,701 --> 00:58:11,701
century called epogen epigenetics.
It turns out that you can lamarck who

1020
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:14,820
was really the prime,
um,

1021
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:18,550
uh,
what adversary in some sense of Darwin,

1022
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:22,930
dark lamarck believed you could inherit
an acquired characteristics,

1023
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:24,940
right?
For a straight Darwinians like no,

1024
00:58:24,941 --> 00:58:28,060
that doesn't happen.
There's lots of evidence now that you

1025
00:58:28,061 --> 00:58:32,650
can acquire in here that you can inherit
an acquired characteristic.

1026
00:58:32,651 --> 00:58:35,440
So they've showed,
for example with rats that if you

1027
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:40,680
produce a certain amount of terror laden
phobia in a rat,

1028
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:45,700
the rat pups three generations down are
still predisposed in that manner.

1029
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,760
And you know,
we just scratched the surface of Epi

1030
00:58:47,761 --> 00:58:50,560
genetics.
It turns out that your experience can

1031
00:58:50,561 --> 00:58:53,680
alter the structure of your DNA.
It does that by a process,

1032
00:58:53,681 --> 00:58:56,150
which I don't understand called
methylation.

1033
00:58:56,151 --> 00:59:00,670
And methylation apparently is the
modification of the DNA structure by

1034
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:03,330
additions of little clumps of,
you know,

1035
00:59:03,350 --> 00:59:07,180
little chemical units,
little molecules to some in some way we

1036
00:59:07,181 --> 00:59:11,080
don't get that encodes actual
environmentally relevant information.

1037
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:14,440
So you know,
that's pretty mind boggling.

1038
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:19,620
So the,
my point is the final word on how we

1039
00:59:19,781 --> 00:59:20,920
evolve.
There's not yet,

1040
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:25,640
but Darwin popped up this idea that
while you didn't need an intelligent

1041
00:59:25,641 --> 00:59:26,870
designer,
it's like,

1042
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,170
oh,
ah,

1043
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:32,960
it's a big problem for,
for a world whose primary notion before

1044
00:59:32,961 --> 00:59:36,380
then was that everything was the
creation of something that was not only

1045
00:59:36,381 --> 00:59:39,830
intelligent but benevolent.
So I was a little hard on people to come

1046
00:59:39,831 --> 00:59:43,070
up with those ideas.
And there's no reason at all for them

1047
00:59:43,071 --> 00:59:46,130
not to think that they're completely
insane when it first happens because

1048
00:59:46,131 --> 00:59:50,480
they think something that's really deep
and revolutionary that no one else

1049
00:59:50,481 --> 00:59:54,860
thinks or has thought up.
And so the probability that you've done

1050
00:59:54,861 --> 00:59:57,230
that instead of just going stark raving
mad,

1051
00:59:57,231 --> 00:59:58,520
it's like zero.
Right?

1052
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:03,200
So for every actual genius,
there must be 10,000 people who are

1053
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:05,900
convinced in some bizarre,
manic,

1054
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:08,690
paranoid manner that they are genius and
they're not.

1055
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:12,470
So it's rough.
Freud was also

1056
01:00:15,590 --> 01:00:20,450
one of the first people to really go
after the idea that we could represent

1057
01:00:20,451 --> 01:00:25,451
ideas in symbolic form,
in a manner that was in fact

1058
01:00:25,701 --> 01:00:29,720
representational,
but that we ourselves didn't understand.

1059
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:30,981
And I mean,
that's,

1060
01:00:30,981 --> 01:00:33,890
um,
that's another revolutionary idea,

1061
01:00:33,891 --> 01:00:35,900
right?
Is that we could express that it was

1062
01:00:35,901 --> 01:00:39,230
possible to express concepts,
especially those that were associated

1063
01:00:39,231 --> 01:00:44,231
with emotion and motivation using non
linguistic representations that needed

1064
01:00:45,711 --> 01:00:47,570
to be deciphered.
Now,

1065
01:00:47,571 --> 01:00:51,470
Freud's initial theory about that was
that the reason that happened was

1066
01:00:51,471 --> 01:00:53,300
because,
and this is where I think he got

1067
01:00:53,301 --> 01:00:55,130
something seriously wrong,
but whatever,

1068
01:00:55,131 --> 01:00:55,964
like you know,

1069
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:57,023
yeah,

1070
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:03,100
you have to say that with respect.
Freud appeared to think of memory in a

1071
01:01:03,231 --> 01:01:05,090
way that we wouldn't think of memory
anymore.

1072
01:01:05,091 --> 01:01:07,700
Like he,
he seemed to think something like

1073
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:12,290
when you made,
when you experienced an event,

1074
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:16,740
the event was as the,
a few experienced it,

1075
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:20,430
that that was the event.
So what you experienced was the reality

1076
01:01:20,431 --> 01:01:23,520
of the event.
And then sometimes you didn't like the

1077
01:01:23,521 --> 01:01:27,270
implication of that event or perhaps you
couldn't understand it,

1078
01:01:27,271 --> 01:01:29,550
but you could understand it enough to
know that it was horrible.

1079
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:30,930
It's,
that'd be a traumatic event.

1080
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:34,920
And then just shove that sucker down
into the depths of your being where,

1081
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:37,500
where,
where he didn't have to think about it

1082
01:01:37,501 --> 01:01:42,501
anymore and then it would poke itself up
into the nether regions of your

1083
01:01:43,111 --> 01:01:45,390
consciousness.
Partly in dreams,

1084
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:48,930
partly and interestingly enough in slips
of the tongue,

1085
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:51,150
you know,
we still call those Friday and slips and

1086
01:01:51,151 --> 01:01:54,540
I'll tell you one of the things that's
really cool about doing dream analysis

1087
01:01:54,541 --> 01:01:58,650
and psychotherapy is that people make
slips of the tongue tongue all the time.

1088
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:01,410
Tom May slips of the tongue.

1089
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:03,840
Yeah,
well I won't interpret that for now.

1090
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:07,710
But if you listen to people make Friday
and slips while they're talking to you

1091
01:02:07,711 --> 01:02:10,620
about their dreams,
they're often telling you exactly what

1092
01:02:10,621 --> 01:02:12,420
the dream means.
And it's so cool.

1093
01:02:12,421 --> 01:02:15,030
I've seen people,
you know how words can have two

1094
01:02:15,031 --> 01:02:15,864
meanings,
right?

1095
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:20,460
Or sometimes three meetings.
Sometimes someone is telling you about

1096
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:24,000
their dream,
they'll use a sentence to describe part

1097
01:02:24,001 --> 01:02:27,900
of the dream that similar caneously
accounts for the other part of the dream

1098
01:02:27,901 --> 01:02:29,490
without them even know.
Notice it.

1099
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:32,430
And then all I'll do,
cause we're trying to puzzle out the

1100
01:02:32,431 --> 01:02:35,280
dream is all tell them back what they
just said.

1101
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:36,860
And they'll go,
you know,

1102
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:38,370
they'll have a little startle.
It's like,

1103
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,530
Oh yeah,
that's obviously what that means.

1104
01:02:40,531 --> 01:02:43,410
And how in the world people are smart
enough to do that.

1105
01:02:43,411 --> 01:02:45,120
On the fly is beyond me.
You know,

1106
01:02:45,121 --> 01:02:47,040
it's like,
it's hard enough to talk about one thing

1107
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:48,143
at a time.

1108
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:51,780
But to manage to talk about two things
with the same sentence in a coherent

1109
01:02:51,781 --> 01:02:54,360
way.
It's like wait to go brain.

1110
01:02:54,690 --> 01:02:57,180
And I think what's happening is we kind
of know that,

1111
01:02:57,950 --> 01:02:59,190
you know,
the left hemisphere,

1112
01:02:59,191 --> 01:03:01,830
roughly speaking is a linguistic
hemisphere,

1113
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:05,820
right?
But there's a corresponding area in the

1114
01:03:05,821 --> 01:03:10,590
right hemisphere that's more or less in
the same physiological location that

1115
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:14,750
this part inhibits tonically.
It's,

1116
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:17,730
it inhibits it all the time.
And it kind of seems that what happens

1117
01:03:17,731 --> 01:03:21,480
is now and then that other part of the
brain can get access to speech.

1118
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:24,510
Now it's not very linguistic.
So it sort of stumbles around and maybe

1119
01:03:24,511 --> 01:03:28,800
it does it in more symbolic terms cause
it thinks it logistically but now and

1120
01:03:28,801 --> 01:03:31,260
then it's got something to say and then
Poof,

1121
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:33,450
both of them are talking at the same
time.

1122
01:03:33,451 --> 01:03:34,710
And that is the coolest thing.

1123
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:36,270
Like the problem is,
it's very,

1124
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:37,680
I can't tell you about it,
you know,

1125
01:03:37,681 --> 01:03:39,330
because,
and this is one of the problems with

1126
01:03:39,331 --> 01:03:44,130
psychoanalytic phenomena is that you
can't really understand them in the

1127
01:03:44,131 --> 01:03:48,960
absence of the context that a lengthy
therapeutic interaction provides.

1128
01:03:48,961 --> 01:03:49,770
You know,
it's like,

1129
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:51,840
you know how if it is,
if you have an old friend,

1130
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:54,690
he's like you,
you can just say the number of a joke.

1131
01:03:54,691 --> 01:03:56,570
You know,
it's like that's joke 42 and they'll

1132
01:03:56,590 --> 01:03:58,530
laugh because they know the joke.
You know,

1133
01:03:58,531 --> 01:04:03,531
you have this shared history that
enables you to make reference to things

1134
01:04:03,661 --> 01:04:08,340
just using fragments and you can't
explain how you do that to someone else

1135
01:04:08,341 --> 01:04:09,960
while at the same thing happens in
therapy.

1136
01:04:09,961 --> 01:04:13,380
It's like you've talked to this person
for endless hours about the most

1137
01:04:13,381 --> 01:04:15,180
important things that are going on in
their life.

1138
01:04:15,181 --> 01:04:19,290
And then there'll be communication,
communicated phenomena that emerge

1139
01:04:19,291 --> 01:04:20,910
within that context.

1140
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:22,440
And they're,
you know,

1141
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:24,540
they strike you with the force of
revelation,

1142
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:28,530
but you can't communicate them to anyone
else cause you can't conjure up the

1143
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:31,020
entire context,
which is partly why I want to show you

1144
01:04:31,021 --> 01:04:35,550
this movie on Tuesday because it's the
only thing I've ever seen that actually

1145
01:04:35,551 --> 01:04:37,050
manages to do this.
It's,

1146
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:41,250
it shows Freudian psychopathology
because it gives you enough contextual

1147
01:04:41,251 --> 01:04:43,860
information to actually infer it.
So,

1148
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:47,670
so that's really smart.
All that whole free association thing,

1149
01:04:47,671 --> 01:04:51,570
man,
that's his idea that it was emotional

1150
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:55,020
systems repressed or not part of the Ed.
You're not.

1151
01:04:55,021 --> 01:04:57,360
Because his idea of the unconscious was
somewhat,

1152
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:01,920
it was somewhat confused in a sense.
It depended on when he was thinking

1153
01:05:01,921 --> 01:05:02,461
about it.
I mean,

1154
01:05:02,461 --> 01:05:04,500
first of all,
the unconscious was a place to put

1155
01:05:04,501 --> 01:05:06,150
things you didn't want to pay any
attention to.

1156
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,620
But then later it sort of became the Ed
and the Ed was the place of these

1157
01:05:10,621 --> 01:05:12,990
primordial drives and emotions.

1158
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:15,720
And so it's not a bad model of the
unconscious,

1159
01:05:15,721 --> 01:05:17,500
you know,
especially if you think about it as

1160
01:05:17,501 --> 01:05:20,170
something alive and the unconscious is
alive.

1161
01:05:20,171 --> 01:05:22,210
It is not a cognitive machine.
And you know,

1162
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:25,000
modern psychologists talk about the
cognitive unconscious.

1163
01:05:25,001 --> 01:05:25,571
It's like,
yeah,

1164
01:05:25,571 --> 01:05:26,890
yeah,
yeah,

1165
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:28,810
right.
There's a cognitive unconscious.

1166
01:05:28,811 --> 01:05:29,261
It's like,
well,

1167
01:05:29,261 --> 01:05:31,330
what about the rest of them?
You know,

1168
01:05:31,331 --> 01:05:35,500
the motivational unconscious and the
emotional unconscious and those things

1169
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:38,950
to the effect of neuroscientists are
onto that anyway.

1170
01:05:38,951 --> 01:05:40,810
So it doesn't really matter.
But you know,

1171
01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:43,360
Freud got there way early and you know,
he would,

1172
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:46,540
he would note that you see this all the
time,

1173
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:48,430
you're talking to someone,
they're mad at you,

1174
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,380
you know,
and you say,

1175
01:05:50,381 --> 01:05:51,310
well,
you're mad at me.

1176
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:51,881
And they go,
well,

1177
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:52,714
no,
I'm not.

1178
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:55,900
And you know,
and they face makes it perfectly evident

1179
01:05:55,901 --> 01:05:56,734
that they're mad at you.

1180
01:05:56,830 --> 01:05:59,260
And so does their tone of voice.
It's like,

1181
01:05:59,261 --> 01:06:01,840
okay,
are they lying?

1182
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:06,970
Are they repressing or are they just
more than one thing at the same time?

1183
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:08,650
Well,
you know,

1184
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:11,080
each of those ideas is a perfectly good
idea,

1185
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:16,110
but it's certainly clear that the thing
you're facing is by no means a unified

1186
01:06:16,331 --> 01:06:17,470
phenomena.
You say,

1187
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:18,221
well,
you're mad at me.

1188
01:06:18,221 --> 01:06:18,671
And they go,
no,

1189
01:06:18,671 --> 01:06:19,690
I'm not.
It's like,

1190
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:21,730
sure you're not,
you know,

1191
01:06:21,731 --> 01:06:24,790
and if you poke and prod them in,
irritate them and get them to talk

1192
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:29,290
eventually they'll probably figure out
why they're mad because maybe they don't

1193
01:06:29,291 --> 01:06:32,230
know or they weren't willing to admit it
to themselves or they hadn't fully

1194
01:06:32,231 --> 01:06:35,650
articulated.
And then maybe they'll tell you.

1195
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:38,500
Usually they'll cry first and then
they'll tell you,

1196
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:39,490
well,
that's how it is,

1197
01:06:39,491 --> 01:06:41,950
right?
If you watch how these things progress,

1198
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:46,120
it's like it isn't until something
collapses in some sense in the person

1199
01:06:46,121 --> 01:06:48,280
that,
and they sort of soften,

1200
01:06:48,430 --> 01:06:52,570
I guess they let their persona drop or
something like that until they soften,

1201
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,580
they're not going to tell you what's
going on.

1202
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:56,830
So there defendant,
you know,

1203
01:06:56,831 --> 01:07:00,820
and that's another freud in idea.
You defend yourself against certain

1204
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,980
Sinamatella and certain truths.
It's like,

1205
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:05,710
yeah,
you certainly do that.

1206
01:07:05,711 --> 01:07:06,910
And you know,
you do it about,

1207
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:12,100
you pretend that other people are other
than you know them to be.

1208
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,250
People do that all the time when they
were in a relationship that they should

1209
01:07:15,251 --> 01:07:18,100
have ended like a year ago,
if they had any sense at all.

1210
01:07:18,101 --> 01:07:19,390
And they know it.
And it's like,

1211
01:07:19,420 --> 01:07:21,940
oh no,
you know this is going to work out.

1212
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:25,510
And they use that stupid voice,
which means that you're only talking

1213
01:07:25,511 --> 01:07:26,261
from here.
Right?

1214
01:07:26,261 --> 01:07:29,350
Cause they're ignoring the entire rest
of their body and what it's saying,

1215
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,600
they know perfectly well.
That's absolute rubbish.

1216
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:34,390
They have no way of explaining to you
why they're doing it.

1217
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,550
They don't know themselves.
It's like

1218
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:41,650
Freud,
he knew what he was talking about.

1219
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:44,710
You know?
And if you observe in your own behavior,

1220
01:07:44,711 --> 01:07:48,550
your proclivity to do absolutely absurd
and self destructive things at the drop

1221
01:07:48,551 --> 01:07:51,610
of a hat and be entirely unable to
control it.

1222
01:07:52,060 --> 01:07:53,800
You know,
I mean we talked a little bit about

1223
01:07:53,801 --> 01:07:57,280
eating disorders.
It's like there's like 80 or 90 of you

1224
01:07:57,281 --> 01:08:00,580
in this room that means at least 30 of
you have an eating disorder.

1225
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:04,060
So you're like having this horrible
battle with your hypothalamus for all

1226
01:08:04,061 --> 01:08:06,040
sorts of weird reasons.
And you know,

1227
01:08:06,041 --> 01:08:10,540
that's sort of the modern equivalent of
Freud and sexual psychopathology because

1228
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:12,730
you know,
we can sleep around but we don't know

1229
01:08:12,731 --> 01:08:15,260
how to eat anymore.
So I don't know if that's much of an

1230
01:08:15,261 --> 01:08:17,660
improvement.
So this is Freud.

1231
01:08:17,661 --> 01:08:20,180
The mind is a composite of contradictory
drives.

1232
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,850
Um,
and Freud actually wasn't,

1233
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:26,660
he wasn't really a drive theorist cause
he was more sophisticated than that,

1234
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:29,120
you know,
because really when he talks about

1235
01:08:29,121 --> 01:08:32,270
drives in the broader context of his
writing,

1236
01:08:32,271 --> 01:08:36,590
it's clear that he's talking more about
subpersonalities because these drives

1237
01:08:36,591 --> 01:08:40,610
manifest themselves as living entities
with their own emotional systems,

1238
01:08:40,611 --> 01:08:42,380
their own thoughts,
their own impulses,

1239
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,300
even their own ability to speak.

1240
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:47,120
And you know that's true because now and
then you say something when you're

1241
01:08:47,121 --> 01:08:48,350
angry,
you think,

1242
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:51,500
well I wish I wouldn't have said that.
It's like who's doing the wishing there?

1243
01:08:51,501 --> 01:08:53,270
Exactly.
You know,

1244
01:08:53,271 --> 01:08:56,960
it's like it wasn't you that said it
while he said it was because I was

1245
01:08:56,961 --> 01:09:00,770
angry.
Well that means you're not your anger.

1246
01:09:00,771 --> 01:09:04,670
Well that's Freud's point.
Ego Id ID is anger.

1247
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:09,200
It is the thing that bubbles up all
these impulsive actions and statements

1248
01:09:09,201 --> 01:09:12,530
and you're going to detach yourself from
that sucker as soon as you can and

1249
01:09:12,531 --> 01:09:14,300
you're going to expect people to forgive
you for it.

1250
01:09:14,301 --> 01:09:16,910
Like I wouldn't have said that if he
wouldn't have made me so angry.

1251
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:19,700
It's like,
which is like the worst kind of apology,

1252
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:21,530
right?
It's like,

1253
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:25,040
ah,
I did something rude to you because

1254
01:09:25,041 --> 01:09:28,220
you're a horrible and I'm your victim.
It's like that's a great apology.

1255
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:33,750
So
frightened was also pretty damn

1256
01:09:33,751 --> 01:09:36,620
sophisticated in his approach to the
unconscious.

1257
01:09:36,621 --> 01:09:39,290
So here's some,
here's some functions that he had

1258
01:09:39,291 --> 01:09:43,850
identified as early as the 19 hundreds
so he said the unconscious has a

1259
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:48,080
conservative faculty.
It stores memories often unaccessible to

1260
01:09:48,081 --> 01:09:49,790
voluntary recall.
It's like,

1261
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:51,380
it's an interesting idea,
right?

1262
01:09:51,381 --> 01:09:54,890
So where are those things that you
remember that you could remember but

1263
01:09:54,891 --> 01:09:56,930
that you aren't?
Well,

1264
01:09:56,931 --> 01:09:57,920
that's a hard one,
right?

1265
01:09:57,921 --> 01:09:58,754
It's like,
well,

1266
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,670
I don't know where they are,
but they seem to be somewhere when I

1267
01:10:01,671 --> 01:10:03,200
want to recall them.
And Freud would say,

1268
01:10:03,201 --> 01:10:05,300
well,
they're in the unconscious now.

1269
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:09,440
It's obviously a black box hypothesis,
right?

1270
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,750
You know,
because it's not very explanatory.

1271
01:10:11,751 --> 01:10:15,050
But at least he had the sense that it
was reasonable to think of them as

1272
01:10:15,051 --> 01:10:19,610
somewhere dissolute IV.
The unconscious contains habits once

1273
01:10:19,611 --> 01:10:23,720
voluntary,
now automatized and dissociated elements

1274
01:10:23,721 --> 01:10:26,240
of the personality,
which may lead a parasitic existence.

1275
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,040
Man,
that's smart.

1276
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:31,880
You know,
the idea that that if you did something

1277
01:10:31,881 --> 01:10:36,740
habitually that that would produce an,
an automatized system.

1278
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:38,780
You know,
we didn't get there with,

1279
01:10:38,781 --> 01:10:41,480
with uh,
with neuroscience until maybe the last

1280
01:10:41,481 --> 01:10:43,940
20 years when we actually figured out
that is what happens.

1281
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:45,920
You know,
when you first start doing something,

1282
01:10:46,030 --> 01:10:48,980
if it's complicated,
your whole brain is involved in that.

1283
01:10:48,981 --> 01:10:51,770
That's why it's so exhausting because
you're really not good at it,

1284
01:10:51,771 --> 01:10:53,180
right?
So you're stumbling around like you're

1285
01:10:53,181 --> 01:10:55,340
trying to learn a piano piece for
example,

1286
01:10:55,341 --> 01:10:57,260
you know,
you make mistakes and you're just a

1287
01:10:57,261 --> 01:11:00,260
Klutz at it and then you practice and
practice and practice.

1288
01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:03,830
And as you're doing that,
less and less of your brain is involved,

1289
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:08,600
interestingly enough.
And the parts that are active move from

1290
01:11:08,601 --> 01:11:12,740
the right to the left and then they move
back and as they move back,

1291
01:11:12,741 --> 01:11:16,560
they get smaller and smaller and smaller
until you have a little habit machine

1292
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,870
that enables,
you say to play that piece of piano

1293
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:22,530
music or that is really good at biking
cocaine,

1294
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:24,600
depending on what you've been
practicing,

1295
01:11:24,601 --> 01:11:26,550
you know,
and then that's a little monster in your

1296
01:11:26,551 --> 01:11:26,850
head.

1297
01:11:26,850 --> 01:11:30,540
Especially if it's associated with
something like cocaine and good luck

1298
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:33,250
getting rid of that because if you've
taught,

1299
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:36,960
you've automated it and built it into
your biology and Freud would say,

1300
01:11:36,961 --> 01:11:39,150
well then the thing just runs as an
autonomous unit.

1301
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:39,751
It's like,
yeah,

1302
01:11:39,751 --> 01:11:40,860
that's right.
The nailed.

1303
01:11:40,861 --> 01:11:43,200
That's exactly right.
Creative.

1304
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,860
The unconscious serves as the Matrix of
new ideas.

1305
01:11:47,490 --> 01:11:49,260
That's smart.
That's smart.

1306
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:51,330
Often when you're coming up with new
ideas,

1307
01:11:51,331 --> 01:11:54,450
you actually free associate as well.
People call that brainstorming.

1308
01:11:54,451 --> 01:11:55,680
So good work.
Freud,

1309
01:11:55,681 --> 01:11:57,990
that was real smart.
Mytho poetic.

1310
01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:01,830
The unconscious constructs,
narratives and fantasies that appeared

1311
01:12:01,831 --> 01:12:03,810
mythic are religious in nature.
It's like,

1312
01:12:03,811 --> 01:12:05,760
well,
young took that and just ran with it.

1313
01:12:05,761 --> 01:12:08,100
Right,
but Freud never quite made the

1314
01:12:08,101 --> 01:12:09,540
connection there,
unfortunately,

1315
01:12:09,541 --> 01:12:12,900
because he was so interested in
hammering home the point that human

1316
01:12:12,901 --> 01:12:17,901
beings were biological creatures.
He never really was able to grapple with

1317
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:19,170
the idea that,
well,

1318
01:12:19,171 --> 01:12:20,670
yeah,
we're biological creatures,

1319
01:12:20,671 --> 01:12:24,150
but the mythic poetic function is a
biological function,

1320
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,910
and so to say that religion is only a
death,

1321
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:30,000
a defense against death,
anxiety is actually,

1322
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,520
it actually contradicts his own theory.

1323
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:34,320
Now,
young pointed that out to Freud.

1324
01:12:34,321 --> 01:12:34,831
He said,
well,

1325
01:12:34,831 --> 01:12:36,750
you know,
there's a bit of a logical problem here.

1326
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:39,900
And Freud said to him,
and this is what caused their break.

1327
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:45,180
It doesn't matter if we don't go down
the biological determinist route,

1328
01:12:45,690 --> 01:12:49,290
so to speak,
then we'll be overwhelmed by a tide of

1329
01:12:49,291 --> 01:12:51,720
oak nonsense.
And of course,

1330
01:12:51,721 --> 01:12:54,180
well,
the act happened there was the Nazis

1331
01:12:54,181 --> 01:12:55,980
first.
They are pretty good at a colt nonsense.

1332
01:12:55,981 --> 01:12:58,140
And then there's the whole new age
movement.

1333
01:12:58,520 --> 01:12:59,353
So,
and you know,

1334
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:02,250
youngest young is tangled up in that,
even though I don't think he's

1335
01:13:02,251 --> 01:13:05,910
responsible for it.
So Freud wasn't going to go there and he

1336
01:13:05,911 --> 01:13:07,050
had his reasons,
you know,

1337
01:13:07,051 --> 01:13:08,880
but young thought,
well that's just not,

1338
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:13,710
I'm going there.
And that's because young had a mythical

1339
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:17,310
poetic imagination of incalculable
complexity.

1340
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:20,040
And that was just where he was headed.
But,

1341
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:22,290
but Freud figured that out.

1342
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,580
It's very,
very smart.

1343
01:13:23,581 --> 01:13:26,110
And you know,
a lot of modern neuroscientists and,

1344
01:13:26,111 --> 01:13:29,580
and modern psychologists haven't even,
haven't got anywhere near this yet.

1345
01:13:29,850 --> 01:13:31,220
You know,
the idea that the unconscious

1346
01:13:31,290 --> 01:13:34,530
unconscious has a Mytho poetic function.
It's like,

1347
01:13:34,531 --> 01:13:37,140
I don't think you've learned that in any
of your neuroscience courses yet,

1348
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:38,700
but it's coming,
you know,

1349
01:13:38,701 --> 01:13:41,970
I mean it's,
it's the case obviously,

1350
01:13:42,270 --> 01:13:46,740
since we have mytho poetic structures
that came from somewhere and they're not

1351
01:13:46,741 --> 01:13:48,330
just stories,
you know,

1352
01:13:48,331 --> 01:13:49,500
that's,
that's a,

1353
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:54,330
that's car.
That's just not a sophisticated way to

1354
01:13:54,331 --> 01:13:55,680
think.
So,

1355
01:13:57,810 --> 01:13:58,810
okay.
What time is it?

1356
01:13:58,870 --> 01:14:00,780
It must be getting close cause you're
all getting rustling.

1357
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:04,170
Two minutes.
Okay.

1358
01:14:04,171 --> 01:14:06,930
Well that's good then.
So what we'll do with the next class is

1359
01:14:06,931 --> 01:14:09,240
we'll go a little farther with Freud and
then I'm going to show you some,

1360
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:12,730
I think they're shocking.
Be prepared that when I'm going to show

1361
01:14:12,731 --> 01:14:16,750
you is a shocking movie and it,
and if it doesn't make you uncomfortable

1362
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:21,490
in many ways and squirm around,
then you're just not paying attention.

1363
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:24,000
So be,
be warned.

1364
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:27,550
Okay.
Friday and psychopathology is not

1365
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,140
pretty.
So,

1366
01:14:29,141 --> 01:14:32,260
and it's another reason why people don't
like to admit that it exists.

1367
01:14:33,020 --> 01:14:34,140
See a suit.

1368
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:37,830
Okay.
