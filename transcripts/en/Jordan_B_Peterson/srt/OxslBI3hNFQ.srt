1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,153
Uh,
before the beginning of my introduction 

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:03,263
of our first speaker,
I think I'd be remiss not to mention my 

3
00:00:06,121 --> 00:00:09,930
observation from the floor and that is 
there is an overwhelming number of young

4
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:12,870
faces in the crowd.
And considering that this is a Sunday,

5
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:16,980
this is your time off from studies or 
work for you to come out here to hear us

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,340
talk about freedom of speech and 
political correctness.

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,350
Uh,
to me is an indication that there is a,

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,850
a zeitgeisty among millennials among 
young people right now.

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,640
And I know we've got disciples of Pha 
and,

10
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,100
and orwell and Huxley,
a Bronc crowder,

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,490
myself as a somewhat young Haig Alien,
I can't help but think that,

12
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:37,110
um,
dialectics is real.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,771
Uh,
the,

14
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,090
the,
the main stream media,

15
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,380
the,
the academic pulpit.

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,030
Um,
what we've been fed,

17
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,680
um,
as the thesis,

18
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,723
we're now pushing back and there was a 
new anti thesis that is forming and God 

19
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:49,440
willing,
I'm the synthesis that comes out of it,

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,620
errs on the side of freedom,
not social justice,

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,290
truth and not political correctness.

22
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,203
Our next,
our first distinguished guests is a man 

23
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:02,160
who introduced neuroplasticity to the 
world.

24
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,410
The idea that our brains are not rigidly
hardwired as was once believed,

25
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,620
but that they can change and indeed be 
rewired.

26
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:11,963
Dr. Norman Doidge is a Canadian born 
psychiatrist psychoanalyst and a world 

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,320
famous professor on the faculties of 
both the University of Toronto,

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,560
Toronto and Columbia University in New

He obtained his medical degree at the 
University of Toronto,

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,033
then moved to New York where he's had a 
residency in psychiatry and obtained a 

33
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:42,150

training and research.
This was followed by a two year Columbia

36
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,913
University Slash National Institute,
Pardon me,

37
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:52,943
Institute of Mental Health Research 
Fellowship where he was trained in 

38
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:56,304
empirical science techniques.
Dr Deutsch has written over 170 

39
00:02:00,811 --> 00:02:01,644
scientific and popular articles as well 
as he appearing on several television 

40
00:02:05,341 --> 00:02:07,500
programs and various documentaries.

41

His New York Times internationally 
bestselling mind bending book.

42

The brain that changes itself with over 
1 million copies sold,

43
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,153
describes how the principle of healing 
the plastic brain is becoming 

44
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,753
established in fact in laboratories 
through a greater understanding of the 

45
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:29,220
ways in which circuits of neurons 
function and are created by thought aunt

46

the brain's way of healing presents 
astounding discoveries in the brain's 

48
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:36,324
healing power.
He is persuasive and curious as a 

49
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:41,640
writer,
a rigorous thinker while the subjects on

50
00:02:41,641 --> 00:02:42,474
which he writes or at the very edge of 
our current understanding of the mind 

51
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,583
and body.
Please join me in welcoming Dr. Norman 

52
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:49,704
Doidge.

53
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,410
Thank you very much.
Can you all hear me?

54
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,980
Thank you faith

55
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,510
and thank you joffrey and thank all of 
you for coming to this talk,

56
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:05,344
which is a shows,
a kind of civic mindedness and reaching 

57
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:09,430
beyond oneself.

58
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,113
Okay.

59
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,143
I'm going to approach this subject from 
a particular vantage point which links 

60
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:19,624
up some things that are I think are very
important in classic political 

61
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:25,870
philosophy and but we know about 
psychology and the brain,

62
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:28,930
so I'm going to call it the infallible 
state of mind.

63
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,660
And this is George Eliot,
perhaps the most philosophical of,

64
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,150
of novelis in way.
Um,

65
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,043
and in middle march,
her masterpiece or one of her 

66
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,970
masterpieces,
there's this,

67
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,720
and this is the epigraph in a way for my
talk,

68
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,200
her anger said as anger is apt to say 
that God was with her,

69
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,573
that all heaven must be on her side.
So you can think about that as the talk 

70
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:00,244
goes on.
The problem we face today is really a 

71
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:05,620
very simple one.
In an open society,

72
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,610
people are different and so we have 
disagreements about important matters.

73
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,193
How do we sort through these 
disagreements and even perhaps benefit 

74
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:15,244
from the different points of view,
but also avoid splitting apart into 

75
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:22,600
warring factions or violence in the 
process.

76
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,620
These are the topics today that I'm 
going to discuss.

77
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:27,963
First our freedom of speech and 
political correctness mutually 

78
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,354
exclusive.
Then I'm going to present the classical 

79
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:39,391
liberal argument for freedom of speech.
It's not just because I want to speak,

80
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,320
that I ought to be allowed to speak,
and why free speech,

81
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:48,340
liberal democracy and individual liberty
are inseparable.

82
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,030
Why you can't really have one without 
the other.

83
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,783
I'm going to discuss why robust freedom 
of speech is the best protection that 

84
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:01,900
exists for minorities and for marginal 
groups,

85
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,173
and how the practice of political 
correctness intentionally undermines 

86
00:05:06,421 --> 00:05:11,421
freedom of speech and unintentionally 
undermines many of its own stated goals.

87
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,233
And then finally,
I'm going to weave into this my 

88
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:20,500
understanding of the infallible frame of
mind that feels so confident in shutting

89
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:21,334
down others.

90
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,700
So our freedom of speech and political 
correctness mutually exclusive,

91
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,793
this is our world.
And then you'll notice that the free 

92
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:36,111
countries are in green and the purple 
ones are authoritarian or a towel.

93
00:05:36,121 --> 00:05:40,230
Terrian regimes and the yellow ones are 
somewhat in the middle,

94
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,123
partly free.
And the first thing that strikes one is 

95
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:48,990
that most of the green is kind of to the
west.

96
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,450
And the exceptions to that,
countries like Israel,

97
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,490
India,
Australia,

98
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,740
even South Africa have had some impact.
Um,

99
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,920
from have been influenced to some 
extent,

100
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,580
often in a major way,
often as a colony,

101
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,810
um,
are dominated by the British.

102
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,060
And many of these ideas about freedom of
speech come from the British tradition.

103
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:24,020
You'll also notice that there these are 
huge landmass is,

104
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:24,854
and they,
they seem almost equal in the countries 

105
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,913
that are are purple.
There's very limited equality of rights 

106
00:06:34,141 --> 00:06:36,060
for women,
for gays,

107
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,030
um,
for various religious minorities.

108
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,960
Those rights exist in the countries that
agree.

109
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,880
So it looks like it's kind of 50,
50 freedom versus authoritarianism.

110
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,630
But actually if you look at this by 
population,

111
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:57,020
only 9.9% of us live in democracies.
That's kind of shocking.

112
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,253
The rest of us live in highly flawed 
democracies with limited rights or 

113
00:07:01,231 --> 00:07:02,064
hybrid regimes and 34%,
so three and a half times live in 

114
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:12,501
authoritarian regimes.
So democracy is not in fantastic shape.

115
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:16,703
If you look at things in terms of 
population and ideas like freedom of 

116
00:07:19,921 --> 00:07:21,570
speech,
um,

117
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,613
if they're only really substantiated,
9.9% of people on the planet arguably 

118
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:32,640
are an endangered species or the at 
least can't be taken for granted.

119
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,100
And that's one of the reasons I'm here 
today.

120
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,753
But why discuss this in the West?
In a way we have more freedom of speech 

121
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:44,570
than ever before with the Internet.
Anyone can publish a blog,

122
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:49,370
can set up their own media company,
develop social media websites,

123
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,750
and in some respects the taste for 
freedom of expression is rising.

124
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,760
And yet that same electronic media has 
made it possible for everyone to monitor

125
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:05,840
everyone,
for your boss,

126
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:07,970
to monitor you,
for your government monitor to you.

127
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,720
And so suddenly the temptation of 
blocking expression is also,

128
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,160
um,
something to be taken very seriously.

129
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,140
Some recent examples of political 
correctness.

130
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:26,983
So President Obama responding to the 
rise of political correctness on campus 

131
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:36,310
gave a speech in Iowa in September,
2015 in a way,

132
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:37,244
you might argue that he articulated in a
colloquial way the basic liberal 

133
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:43,340
argument,
a liberal,

134
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:47,510
I mean the classical liberal argument 
for liberty and freedom of speech.

135
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,030
The purpose of college is to create a 
space where a lot of ideas are present.

136
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,530
He said and collide.
When I went to college,

137
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:59,340
suddenly there were some folks who 
didn't think at all like me and if I had

138
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:02,850
an opinion about something,
they'd look at me and they'd say,

139
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:03,684
well that's stupid.
And then they describe how they saw the 

140
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:06,594
world and they might have had a 
different sense of politics or they 

141
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,043
might have a different view about 
poverty or they might have a different 

142
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:13,254
perspective on race.
And sometimes their views would be 

143
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,554
infuriating to me.
But it was because there was this space 

144
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,073
where you could interact with people who
didn't agree with you that I then 

145
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:28,470
started testing my own assumptions and 
sometimes I realized,

146
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,440
you know what?
Maybe I've been too narrow minded.

147
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,483
Maybe I didn't take this into account.
Maybe I should see this person's 

148
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:36,354
perspective.
So that's what college in part is all 

149
00:09:38,671 --> 00:09:42,120
about.
And here's him going on.

150
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,110
Just after that,

151
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,970
I was just talking to a friend of mine 
about this.

152
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,950
You know,
I,

153
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,793
I've,
I've heard some college campuses where 

154
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:54,160
they don't want to have a guest speaker 
who,

155
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,473
you know,
is too conservative or they don't want 

156
00:09:58,601 --> 00:09:59,434
to read a book if it has language that 
is offensive to African Americans or 

157
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,720
somehow sends a demeaning signal towards
women.

158
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,460
And you know,
I,

159
00:10:13,461 --> 00:10:15,790
I gotta tell you I don't agree with that
either.

160
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,033
I don't agree that you,
when you become students at colleges 

161
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,260
have to be coddled and protected from 
different points of view.

162
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:31,490
It all,
I think that you should be able to

163
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,160
get off

164
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,090
use.
You should invite anybody,

165
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:44,310
anybody who comes to speak to you and 
you disagree with,

166
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:49,340
you should have an argument with them,
but you shouldn't silence them by saying

167
00:10:49,741 --> 00:10:53,230
you can't come because you know my 
senses.

168
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:56,370
I'm too sensitive to hear what you have 
to say.

169
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,560
Um,
that's not,

170
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:02,340
that's not the way we learn either.
So what do you think?

171
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,660
All right.
Amen.

172
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,970
He said Amen.
All right.

173
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,133
Okay.

174
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,313
Now the president used the words coddled
and protected and not listening to 

175
00:11:18,661 --> 00:11:21,720
people because we are too sensitive to 
hear what you have to say.

176
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,840
And coddling and overprotecting it might
seem,

177
00:11:24,841 --> 00:11:27,870
would produce non resilient passive 
people,

178
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,483
but coddling can also cause people to 
become self focused in title and 

179
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:36,450
disrespectful of others.
In other words,

180
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,650
silencing gathers is not always a very 
pretty thing.

181
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,380
So there was the Yale Halloween crisis,
um,

182
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,120
and some Yale students complained to the
administration that it was offering very

183
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:54,544
heavy handed advice,
telling them that they would be 

184
00:11:56,501 --> 00:12:00,430
insensitive to wear costumes that 
symbolize cultural appropriation.

185
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,490
At that point,
Erika Christakis,

186
00:12:03,491 --> 00:12:04,324
who was a Yale lecturer and a specialist
in childhood education and who had with 

187
00:12:09,491 --> 00:12:14,491
her husband been involved in supervising
one of the residences at Yale.

188
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,353
She wrote an email encouraging students 
to stand up for their own right to 

189
00:12:19,091 --> 00:12:19,924
decide what to wear and not cede control
to others to make moral decisions for 

190
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:25,660
them.
And she said,

191
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,330
if you object to others,
costumes speak up.

192
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,164
By all means.
Now a faction of students then demanded 

193
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:35,050
that the Christakis is be fired.

194
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,993
Nope.

195
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,333
One of the things that was happening is 
there were groups at Yale saying that 

196
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,480
they felt there was not enough respect 
for,

197
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,000
um,
cultural diversity,

198
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,950
uh,
along lines of race and so on.

199
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,950
But this was the event,
the,

200
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:53,843
uh,
Erika Christakis email that triggered 

201
00:12:56,721 --> 00:13:01,710
things after she wrote that email,
her husband,

202
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,700
Nicholas

203
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,103
tweeted,

204
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,520
President Obama saying the things I just
showed you saying,

205
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,773
you know,
we shouldn't try to overprotect 

206
00:13:13,221 --> 00:13:14,054
students.
And then in this very widely viewed 

207
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,110
video,
one young woman,

208
00:13:21,111 --> 00:13:24,170
and then I'm going to show you more,
came up to,

209
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,610
um,
Nicholas Christakis with about a hundred

210
00:13:28,611 --> 00:13:31,310
other students at a protest,
um,

211
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,203
to speak to him.
And I used the word speak in quotation 

212
00:13:34,821 --> 00:13:39,821
marks while you watched this,
try to analyze what's happening here.

213
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:48,130
The exception is because other people 
have rights to not just what

214
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,030
you understand
that

215
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,210
your job please comfort and home for the
students.

216
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,193
So I have not done that by sending out 
that email that goes against your 

217
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:12,590
position.
Do you understand that

218
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:22,370
I have a different vision if that is 
what you think about being

219
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:33,200
here,
you are doing that.

220
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,813
They're going to leave.
They're going to transfer because you 

221
00:14:52,301 --> 00:14:57,301
are up ports,
not sleep at night.

222
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,910
We're out.
We out are just stop thing.

223
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,770
Okay.
Um,

224
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,613
so amongst the thing she said is you are
not to create an intellectual space 

225
00:15:10,581 --> 00:15:12,670
here.
Um,

226
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:16,180
this should be a safe haven.
It should be a home.

227
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:21,720
Um,
and where the function of college goats,

228
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:22,554
it's hard to say,
but one might argue this is just one 

229
00:15:25,481 --> 00:15:28,270
person who had a bad day and was,
was,

230
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,750
was very upset,
but it wasn't just one person.

231
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,310
Oops,
sorry.

232
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,060
It went on and for quite a while

233
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,900
do even for causing pain.
I was looking for the right word.

234
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:49,470
Hello.
[inaudible] violence.

235
00:15:53,811 --> 00:15:57,680
I can disagree with that statement.
What is your name?

236
00:15:57,681 --> 00:15:59,360
You need to bend down.
I'm not bending.

237
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,550
What's her name?
I do not want you to take your,

238
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,040
okay.
I do not want,

239
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,450
I do not respect you.
I'm going to hear that.

240
00:16:05,451 --> 00:16:07,630
I'm looking at this smirk in your face 
like I'm disgusting

241
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,810
and I'm sick watching them argue with 
you.

242
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,253
We've been standing on stage literally 
for at least five to six hours between 

243
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:19,460
you and Halloween,
which wean last night.

244
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,473
To now.
We've been arguing with people who are 

245
00:16:21,891 --> 00:16:26,360
not willing to be listened to for a long
time and all I see from you is arrogance

246
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:31,040
and ego.
I am thick looking at you.

247
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,740
I am disgusted watching,
argue with you.

248
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,110
You are not listening.
You are disgusting.

249
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,170
I don't think you understand that.
And I,

250
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,370
before I wasn't I before,
I was not angry per say.

251
00:16:46,371 --> 00:16:47,204
I was disappointed.
Maybe I thought maybe there was real 

252
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:49,964
important before apology.
You've clearly told us that you did not 

253
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:54,560
plant.
Offer an apology for your words.

254
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:58,290
You left the meeting last night to go 
home and vent.

255
00:16:58,291 --> 00:16:59,124
Tweak.
Do not interrupt me to tweet from your 

256
00:17:01,581 --> 00:17:04,010
twitter and then the filaments.
Twitter,

257
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,873
you showed no remorse.
You tried to let your wife leave that 

258
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:09,200
conversation without having answered for
herself.

259
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,450
That is disgusting.
That is sick.

260
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:15,110
And now I wasn't angry before.
I was not angry before,

261
00:17:15,111 --> 00:17:18,320
but now I am actually angry sir.
I really do not interrupt me.

262
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,400
I was not angry and now I want your job 
to be taken from you.

263
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:23,893
I don't want them to have this job.
I am discussing knowing that she worked 

264
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,940
at Yale University where I will get my 
degree.

265
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,670
I will look back and think,
I have to argue with you.

266
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,533
Yeah.
Halloween problem had to do with 

267
00:17:34,571 --> 00:17:35,404
cultural appropriation.
Some people would be dressing up as 

268
00:17:38,561 --> 00:17:39,394
different different groups,
cultural appropriations about who can 

269
00:17:43,931 --> 00:17:48,931
say what.
In 2015 the University of Ottawa Student

270
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,120
Federation canceled a Free Yoga Class,
had been going on for about eight years.

271
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,210
It was taught at the center for students
with disabilities.

272
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,123
It was free again,
I say that and it was closed down 

273
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:02,904
because some students were uncomfortable
with the cultural issues involved and 

274
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:06,984
when asked for explanations that had to 
do with the fact that yoga was from 

275
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,523
India and the instructor was not from 
India and so she had no right to teach 

276
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:16,704
it and it wasn't even clear that people 
in the West had the right to teach yoga 

277
00:18:20,881 --> 00:18:21,730
to others.
So there were,

278
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:24,810
there was no right to offer.
Offer that.

279
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,143
Let's talk about fiction.
The PC issue about fiction is who can 

280
00:18:33,331 --> 00:18:34,164
write what.
It's argued that a person of one 

281
00:18:36,571 --> 00:18:37,404
religion,
race or gender cannot create a fiction 

282
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:40,584
character of uh,
who is another religion or race or 

283
00:18:45,421 --> 00:18:47,640
gender.
It's cultural appropriation,

284
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:50,190
it's identity theft.
But why?

285
00:18:50,191 --> 00:18:51,024
I would say stop it writing.
Why following that reasoning should 

286
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:59,640
anyone be permitted to read fiction,
which involves recreating characters who

287
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:01,950
are different from ourselves in our 
heads.

288
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:09,690
This problem is important because 
reading fiction as doctors Raymond Mark,

289
00:19:11,021 --> 00:19:11,854
he felt Lee and Professor Peterson here 
today have shown actually increases 

290
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:20,791
empathy for readers.
If we wrote the kind of fiction demanded

291
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:25,780
the art form would disappear and be 
replaced by add nine memoir.

292
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,033
Me Talking about myself and I would add 
to myself probably wouldn't be very 

293
00:19:31,481 --> 00:19:32,314
interesting.
So political correctness is not just 

294
00:19:35,201 --> 00:19:36,034
about correct action,
but correct thought and seeks to limit 

295
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,450
the imagination.

296
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,323
Okay,

297
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,170
so forgive me for quoting a novelist.
Um,

298
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,110
therefore,
but censorship is rarely self limiting.

299
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,610
This is from Saul bellow's,
Augie March 1st page.

300
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,270
Everyone knows there is no firmness or 
accuracy of suppression.

301
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:02,140
If you hold down one thing,
you hold down the adjoining.

302
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:06,220
If there's an idea that's forbidden,
there's something similar to it.

303
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:08,650
Or connected to it.
That's arguably forbidden.

304
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:09,663
And so it's a kind of a hunt of,
it's a kind of exercise of scrupulosity 

305
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,520
that is not self limiting.

306
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,420
Okay.

307
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,600
People have tried to understand what's 
going on here.

308
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,420
I mean,
President Obama picked it up.

309
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,283
There's a kind of hypersensitive 
sensitivity afoot and this first showed 

310
00:20:27,681 --> 00:20:32,330
itself in the 1990s and late 1980s and 
Camille Paglia,

311
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:37,310
the independently minded feminist 
thinker art historian,

312
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:42,710
a student of literature,
wrote an article called the Nerc nursery

313
00:20:42,711 --> 00:20:46,520
school campus.
She wondered what's new here.

314
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,500
She noted and has noted since the hyper 
protective helicopter parenting,

315
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,280
it seems to undermine resilience and 
independence over protected.

316
00:20:57,281 --> 00:21:00,910
People will turn to adults or the legal 
system to protect them,

317
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,460
encouraging authorities to regulate the 
sensor,

318
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,840
others around them and perhaps 
encouraging them to,

319
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,820
as we saw with the Halloween costumes 
censor themselves.

320
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,830
This is so different from the 60s where 
students were seeking freedom.

321
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,430
There are new,
smaller one to two children families,

322
00:21:18,431 --> 00:21:23,020
which encourage a feeling in the child 
that the world of adults revolves around

323
00:21:23,021 --> 00:21:23,854
the child.
Compare that to families 150 years ago 

324
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:27,843
or families in Quebec.
You know 70 years ago where you have 

325
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:34,210
five to 10 children and you're raised by
your siblings.

326
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:38,230
They don't buy that bullshit.
They don't think you're so special.

327
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,083
Okay.
Then there are the dean natured urban 

328
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:43,973
upbringings,
people with limited experience in 

329
00:21:45,981 --> 00:21:46,814
nature,
farming rural life where self reliance 

330
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:52,710
as a key virtue think that most of 
life's upbringing,

331
00:21:52,711 --> 00:21:55,430
stem,
not from nature but societal ills,

332
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:58,310
human decisions about how to distribute 
goods,

333
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:03,700
awards and status and how about the zero
tolerance policies in schools incur,

334
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
they encourage and moderation and they 
encourage ignoring context of,

335
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,760
of difficulties that they're assessing.

336
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,463
Political correctness as a term of 
evolved out of the Russian revolution 

337
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:23,883
comes from Russian.
It was used by the land in this left to 

338
00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:27,544
describe keeping to the party line or 
the spirit of the party party most and 

339
00:22:32,141 --> 00:22:36,130
lending himself wrote a number of 
articles about the importance of holding

340
00:22:36,131 --> 00:22:36,964
collect correct political views.
So there would be the baits and some 

341
00:22:40,001 --> 00:22:41,710
people would differ about certain 
things,

342
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,830
but certain views were not politically 
correct.

343
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:50,460
They didn't go with doctor.
Now pc was then used by the left.

344
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:54,603
Later on with conscious irony is like as
a kind of installed to describe someone 

345
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:02,770
on the left who had too much fervor 
toeing the party line.

346
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:07,830
So there there are tendency to Dogma and
doctrine was so intense that it ups it,

347
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,733
it obscured their own humanity.
So that ironic use of pc and not as a 

348
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:16,354
compliment was became mainstream in the 
1990s to more or less described the 

349
00:23:21,131 --> 00:23:25,210
techniques and attitudes designed to 
influence um,

350
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:30,160
society to tow the party line of the 
liberal portion of the left.

351
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,233
Not all of the left is a liberal.
So these are the techniques that are 

352
00:23:36,001 --> 00:23:36,834
familiar to all of us to attack freedom 
of speech or expression or invalidate 

353
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:44,190
speakers and shut them down.
We have speech codes that determine what

354
00:23:44,191 --> 00:23:45,024
people can't,
they prescribe or forbid we have forced 

355
00:23:48,891 --> 00:23:49,724
speech which mandates what people must 
say it prescribes and puts words in 

356
00:23:53,961 --> 00:23:54,794
people's mouth.

357
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:59,490
We have dress codes isn't the Halloween 
situation or other,

358
00:23:59,491 --> 00:24:00,130
other,
other,

359
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:00,963
other examples.
Non platforming the term not giving a 

360
00:24:04,121 --> 00:24:04,954
person a platform which was I understand
originally used in Britain to describe 

361
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,593
not giving violent fascists a platform.
And then it was very quickly applied to 

362
00:24:15,011 --> 00:24:17,620
not giving anyone from Israel a 
platform.

363
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:22,900
And then it generalized to not giving a 
platform to people we disagree with.

364
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:26,500
You can boycott lectures,
you can block entrances to lectures,

365
00:24:26,501 --> 00:24:28,960
you can drown out lecturers with noise 
machines,

366
00:24:28,961 --> 00:24:32,590
shouting fire alarms,
Professor Peterson's experienced much of

367
00:24:32,591 --> 00:24:35,140
this.
And you can pour fallow human substances

368
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:40,141
on people if that's your thing.
And then you can get a huge,

369
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,350
oh,
you can organize to forbid institutional

370
00:24:44,351 --> 00:24:45,184
invitations.
So the bds movement to shut out all the 

371
00:24:48,431 --> 00:24:51,670
attempt to shut out all was rarely 
academics from having a right to speak,

372
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,450
mostly in Europe and North America would
be an example of that.

373
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,200
And then Internet flash mobs,
petitions,

374
00:24:59,201 --> 00:25:00,034
I mean,
it's pretty hard not to get a petition 

375
00:25:01,721 --> 00:25:04,750
of 20,000 people objecting to something 
or someone,

376
00:25:04,751 --> 00:25:08,170
it's so easy.
Anonymous character assassination,

377
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,573
Internet misinformation.
So at to the pro free speech rally at 

378
00:25:15,491 --> 00:25:16,324
the University of Toronto,
someone costed Professor Peterson and 

379
00:25:19,781 --> 00:25:21,700
said,
why are they're Nazis at this?

380
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:22,811
Your,
your,

381
00:25:22,811 --> 00:25:27,010
your rally peterson.
But there were no Nazis at the Raleigh.

382
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:28,803
Um,
but that kind of thing just get getting 

383
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:31,864
repeated over and over.
And that's a kind of character 

384
00:25:33,911 --> 00:25:34,744
assassination attempts.
So we're here with the man who've 

385
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,040
survived one character assassination 
attempt.

386
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:40,503
Um,
then there are threats of shaming to 

387
00:25:42,221 --> 00:25:45,130
create a chill in classrooms campus in 
society at large.

388
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,790
And you know,
that's part of the reason I'm here today

389
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:54,420
because I have seen things written by 
students that they feel they cannot even

390
00:25:55,601 --> 00:25:59,750
at my blessings university discuss many 
diff,

391
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:00,623
many important subjects.
One of those letters was actually 

392
00:26:02,331 --> 00:26:03,164
published in the varsity about a student
who was in a bioethics class and they 

393
00:26:06,681 --> 00:26:11,681
were discussing sexuality and they even 
discussed aspects of Chen transgendered.

394
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:17,380
And he wanted us to do a paper on it and
is very thoughtful.

395
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:21,740
A decent professor basically just 
dissuaded him.

396
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:25,610
So there are things that we're not 
allowed to,

397
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,620
to talk about or think about.

398
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:31,783
Now privilege,
privilege is used to say the people who 

399
00:26:33,711 --> 00:26:34,544
are not from a protected group,
which is often put into legislation or 

400
00:26:38,841 --> 00:26:39,674
in the popular mind,
are not entitled to speak on certain 

401
00:26:42,441 --> 00:26:43,770
issues,
certain key issues.

402
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,510
So privilege limits who can speak and 
it's based on the assumption that people

403
00:26:48,511 --> 00:26:51,600
from what is designated as a non,
sorry,

404
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,623
as a,
as a non vulnerable group carry a kind 

405
00:26:55,141 --> 00:26:58,440
of original sin based on the group that 
they come from.

406
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,083
It's usually buttressed by a narrative 
stating that the person's ancestors did 

407
00:27:03,241 --> 00:27:06,360
terrible things and had life easy.
Hence the privilege.

408
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:11,840
By the way,
the word privilege also was used by my,

409
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:15,030
by the early communists to describe the 
bourgeois.

410
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:20,400
And in the early parts of the revolution
it was sufficient to be bourgeois,

411
00:27:20,401 --> 00:27:23,730
to be rounded up and shot because you 
had privilege.

412
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,463
And of course many people,
many thoughtful people are scratching 

413
00:27:29,131 --> 00:27:29,964
their heads because they find it hard to
distinguish this kind of categorization 

414
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:37,680
from bigotry since it bree prejudges 
people by the group they come from,

415
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:39,720
okay.

416
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,553
One of the politically correct methods 
that's evolving is what I call 

417
00:27:44,821 --> 00:27:45,654
asymmetrical lawfare.
So asymmetrical lawfare is writing law 

418
00:27:49,681 --> 00:27:50,514
or legal code or institutional code to 
give an advantage to an accuser who 

419
00:27:55,411 --> 00:27:57,390
would shut down the free expression of 
others.

420
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,960
And how do we do this?
Well,

421
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,573
we reexamined evidentiary criteria and 
you know what counts for some kind of 

422
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:12,920
elicit act or problematic activity.
So if you can't prove aggression alleged

423
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,470
new category,
micro aggression,

424
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,780
this involves defining hate,
speech,

425
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:21,300
discrimination and harassment down.
In other words,

426
00:28:21,301 --> 00:28:24,990
lowering the threshold of each of these.
These things are important things.

427
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,730
Okay,

428
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:29,730
the definitions are,
or sliding and changing.

429
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:33,720
If you can't improve mal intention or 
any intention,

430
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:34,973
say the harm is done unintentionally and
that can be every bit as much a human 

431
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:41,940
rights violation.
And then you define words up.

432
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,750
So words become action and a critical 
word

433
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,383
becomes violence.
Now his speech violence is speech 

434
00:28:52,591 --> 00:28:54,210
action.
Well,

435
00:28:54,211 --> 00:28:57,750
you know at times speech is action.
The philosopher Jl Austin,

436
00:28:57,751 --> 00:28:58,584
and how to do things with words pointed 
out that language can have what he 

437
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:04,980
called the performative aspect.
So when a bride or groom says,

438
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,230
I do,
or a general says attack,

439
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:11,610
the speaker is doing something with 
words that has a legal consequence.

440
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:13,403
But does the fact that some words can be
given a legal context sometimes mean 

441
00:29:16,201 --> 00:29:19,680
that all words we disagree with it 
should be seen as violent actions.

442
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:23,670
That is the question.
Now these are pc values,

443
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,370
inclusiveness,
tolerance,

444
00:29:26,371 --> 00:29:28,080
anti prejudice,
diversity,

445
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:32,040
openness to difference,
kindness and compassion,

446
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,890
living together,
nonjudgmental ism,

447
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,410
transparent transparency.

448
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:38,243
And increasingly one hears people 
talking the language of seeking a 

449
00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:42,574
therapeutic culture where we create a 
world where everyone feels good and 

450
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:46,624
their feelings are valued and respected.
That is the PC understanding of a 

451
00:29:50,111 --> 00:29:52,840
therapeutic culture.
Um,

452
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,190
you know,
if you look at these,

453
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:59,340
I think it's pretty clear that many 
Canadians support these values.

454
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:01,323
I think it's also clear that these are 
placeholders that many people defined 

455
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:05,374
somewhat differently.
And when it gets down to the nitty 

456
00:30:07,571 --> 00:30:10,400
gritty,
and you said something like diversity,

457
00:30:10,401 --> 00:30:11,234
but what exactly do you mean by that?
But these words have a great plastic 

458
00:30:14,891 --> 00:30:16,240
power,
not neuroplastic,

459
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:18,070
but just plastic.
You know,

460
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:23,100
in the sense that they're very evocative
and there's a little lot of quote,

461
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:24,760
forgive the,
the dirty word,

462
00:30:24,761 --> 00:30:26,530
buy in,
um,

463
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,030
to these words if you just use these 
words and don't think through how to use

464
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:31,864
them.
And the other thing about them is 

465
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,840
they're all about justice and equality.

466
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:42,190
They're all about good things.
So why the utterly intolerant behavior?

467
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:45,463
If these are your goals,
is it simply a case of weakness of will 

468
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:53,630
people who are pc care for these values?
But like many of the rest of us,

469
00:30:53,631 --> 00:30:58,460
they fail to live up to their values.
Why intolerant?

470
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,870
Is that a case of projection?
Unable to be tolerant,

471
00:31:02,871 --> 00:31:05,420
kind,
and open as much as they would sincerely

472
00:31:05,421 --> 00:31:06,254
wish to be?
Do they have a guilty conscience and to 

473
00:31:09,111 --> 00:31:11,810
deal with that,
that the then project their faults on to

474
00:31:11,811 --> 00:31:16,010
others righteously condemn them feeling 
themselves pure of heart.

475
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,110
There was a lot of projection,
by the way,

476
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,123
in the little video I showed you,
remember when wipe that smirk off your 

477
00:31:21,861 --> 00:31:23,570
face?
Did you see that smirk?

478
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,790
I could.
Could not see that smirk.

479
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:27,163
Um,
but it must have been fun to give him 

480
00:31:29,331 --> 00:31:30,970
the gears.
Um,

481
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,630
now remember when you project one of 
your faults onto another person,

482
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,380
you become blind to it and yourself.
That's the purpose of projection.

483
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:42,803
Yeah.

484
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,273
Again,
why the non-compassionate noninclusive 

485
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,040
intolerant behavior or social justice 
warriors?

486
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,023
Simply opportunists using these commonly
shared values that I showed you as the 

487
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,114
ideal tools,
the ideal hammers to attack those 

488
00:31:59,941 --> 00:32:01,830
they're competing with for political 
power.

489
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:03,953
Remember,
these values of inclusion are shared by 

490
00:32:05,671 --> 00:32:09,960
many of us.
That's why being accused of being racist

491
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:15,500
or sexist or something very much stings 
and anyone with a good conscience,

492
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,913
anyone with a conscience is very,
it's a quickly frozen by such an 

493
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:22,110
accusation.
Interestingly,

494
00:32:22,111 --> 00:32:22,944
those who don't have much of a 
conscience or not frozen by such an 

495
00:32:25,381 --> 00:32:29,010
accusation,
but as the accusations are repeated over

496
00:32:29,011 --> 00:32:32,880
and over and over,
they begin to lose their potency,

497
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,970
which is a problem because there is such
a thing as racism.

498
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,850
It's sort of like a government that just
printing more and more money.

499
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,183
Soon your dollar doesn't do anything.
And then there's this question 

500
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:48,730
considering how inclusive and Koombaya 
these values are.

501
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,920
Why does social justice warriors call 
themselves warriors?

502
00:32:51,921 --> 00:32:53,510
They're not peacemakers,
for instance.

503
00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:01,290
So let's turn now to the classic 
articulation of freedom of speech.

504
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,440
Um,
this is not the only stream.

505
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,060
There are judicial streams,
et Cetera,

506
00:33:07,061 --> 00:33:11,320
but I actually prefer the philosophical 
stream to the judicial stream.

507
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:17,250
So this is John Stuart mill who wrote on
liberty in 1859 and he prefaced the book

508
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:22,660
with a quote of a sentence from another 
book,

509
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:28,260
but this sentence very much sums up much
of it on liberty is about,

510
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:31,660
so it's from the Greatville home,
a von Humbolt,

511
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,513
the grand leading principal towards 
which every argument unfolded in these 

512
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:38,224
pages directly converges is the absolute
and essential importance of human 

513
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:48,271
development in its richest diversity.
It's almost as though it might have been

514
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,380
written by a certain kind of 
psychologist,

515
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:56,340
but it's about human flourishing and 
thriving and somehow or other liberty is

516
00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:01,090
about that in a very big way.
Now,

517
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:02,673
he makes clear in the book that there's 
a fundamental opposition between 

518
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:10,110
individual liberty and tyranny.
They're fundamentally opposed as liberty

519
00:34:10,151 --> 00:34:12,700
increases,
authoritarianism decreases,

520
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:13,690
and vice versa.

521
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:21,170
Your meal did get involved in political,
the politics of his day.

522
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:27,190
He wrote the subject of women,
one of the first,

523
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:31,050
uh,
feminist books he wrote on Uti,

524
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,850
uh,
uti on utilitarianism.

525
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,030
He wrote on liberty with his wife 
Harriet Taylor,

526
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:41,920
who very much influenced the book and 
who passed away before it was published.

527
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:45,310
I mean,
most of the book was obviously his,

528
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,160
but um,
he learned a lot from her.

529
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:49,623
He worked to extend the vote and he was 
one of the best educated people in the 

530
00:34:52,871 --> 00:34:53,704
19th century.
He learned ancient Greek at the age of 

531
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:59,080
three and his autobiography is famous 
for these kinds of things.

532
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:06,390
So whenever somebody wants to limit free
speech,

533
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,393
the first thing out of their mouth is I 
love free speech Bot or we believe in 

534
00:35:12,271 --> 00:35:13,104
free speech bought free speech,
always has limits and mel would agree 

535
00:35:18,661 --> 00:35:19,494
with that.
The difference is the railroad has 

536
00:35:23,341 --> 00:35:26,940
booked to create a space for free speech
that would be reasonable.

537
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,223
And often when people are limiting it,
they're trying to move in the other 

538
00:35:30,961 --> 00:35:35,010
direction.
So let's look at one of the many ways he

539
00:35:35,011 --> 00:35:35,844
articulated this.
No one it actions should be as free as 

540
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:41,670
opinions.
On the contrary,

541
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,533
even opinions lose their immunity when 
the circumstances in which they're 

542
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,740
expressed are such as to constitute 
their expression,

543
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,250
a positive instigation to some ms gvs 
act.

544
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,013
And then he gives examples like a 
positive instigation of a ms gvs act 

545
00:35:58,441 --> 00:35:59,274
would be the following.
There are a lot of poor people and the 

546
00:36:01,651 --> 00:36:05,490
corn growers have stopped growing corn 
to protect prices.

547
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:07,613
They assemble around the home of the 
corn grower and then you speak to them 

548
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:15,390
and yell and talk about how the corn 
growers are starving to death.

549
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,793
That would be seen as incitement to an 
angry group of people that's becoming a 

550
00:36:21,391 --> 00:36:24,630
mob and could immediately lead to 
violence.

551
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:26,363
So the threshold is fairly high there.
But also notice he says no one pretends 

552
00:36:30,361 --> 00:36:32,040
that action should be as free as 
opinions.

553
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,023
It's very clear in his mind that actions
are not opinions and opinions are not 

554
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:38,640
actions.
Words are not actions.

555
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:39,863
They have to be distinguished.
If we are to get this space that 

556
00:36:42,061 --> 00:36:44,520
President Obama says we need.

557
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:46,130
Okay.

558
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:48,620
Freedom of speech for mill is not just a
right.

559
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:49,950
Okay?

560
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:54,950
It is a necessity.
It is a necessity for the functioning of

561
00:36:55,051 --> 00:36:55,884
a democracy.
It is the oil that makes or the fuel 

562
00:36:58,501 --> 00:37:02,790
that makes the engine grow and for the 
healthy functioning of the individual.

563
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,193
Why?
Because human history is filled with 

564
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:08,220
error,
error,

565
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,210
error,
error,

566
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,620
error.
Coming from authority,

567
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,000
from faith,
from religion,

568
00:37:12,001 --> 00:37:13,710
from political claims,
from science,

569
00:37:13,711 --> 00:37:17,820
from ideologues,
augury prophecy and from common sense.

570
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:19,390
Okay,

571
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:20,223
so this error must be examined and I 
don't have to list all the scientific 

572
00:37:23,981 --> 00:37:28,030
areas we've made over the years and I 
can list a few we're making right now,

573
00:37:28,031 --> 00:37:28,864
but this is not the time for it.
Free speech and inquiry are our best 

574
00:37:32,531 --> 00:37:36,460
chance to overcome our extraordinary all
human,

575
00:37:36,461 --> 00:37:37,294
all too human proclivity for error.
Now it's important to understand how 

576
00:37:43,301 --> 00:37:46,180
freedom and then how freedom of speech 
emerges.

577
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:50,080
And in a few elegant paragraphs,
mills just lays this out.

578
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:51,723
For most of human history,
humanity has lived under tyranny or 

579
00:37:55,211 --> 00:37:56,044
authoritarian rule,
and if you think of the map I just 

580
00:37:58,511 --> 00:37:59,344
showed you,
we're pretty close to that today as 

581
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:06,130
well.
Authoritarian regimes are run by the few

582
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,280
whose who see their subjects as their 
belongings,

583
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,383
their chattel,
and they use violence against them when 

584
00:38:12,371 --> 00:38:13,204
they please take their property as they 
wish and prosecute and punish them at 

585
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:20,920
will.
The law in this situation is as it has,

586
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:21,963
as Sadam Hussein said,
the law is the two lines above my 

587
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:30,670
signature.
Now,

588
00:38:30,671 --> 00:38:32,820
why is free speech so frightening to the
tire?

589
00:38:32,821 --> 00:38:36,760
And he has a lot of power.
It he rules through fear.

590
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:39,310
And so he never really knows who he can 
trust.

591
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:41,410
And that can include some of his 
generals.

592
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:46,750
The tyrant and his crew are ultimately a
minority and the people are many.

593
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,333
And so it's important for the tyrant,
but the people are not allowed to 

594
00:38:51,791 --> 00:38:52,624
publicly share the extent to which they 
suffer under his rule because then they 

595
00:38:57,761 --> 00:39:01,360
might organize against him.
The tyrant,

596
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,640
the emperor,
the dictator,

597
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,500
and the odds are in their favor.

598
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:10,510
So if you think about the story of the 
emperor's new clothes,

599
00:39:10,511 --> 00:39:11,344
it's even pinker has argued when that 
child speaks out and tells the truth in 

600
00:39:14,921 --> 00:39:17,230
that story and says the emperor is 
naked.

601
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:22,720
It's not that the adults have not seen 
that he is naked as individuals,

602
00:39:22,721 --> 00:39:23,554
they have seen it.
But when the little boy ix speaks up in 

603
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:30,100
the crowd,
now everyone knows that everyone knows.

604
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:35,980
So emperors and tyrants create an 
atmosphere of fear to silence people and

605
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:39,790
stop them from talking about things that
really everybody knows.

606
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:41,870
Okay.

607
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:43,880
Now when the first democracy developed,

608
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,170
something happened to the relationship 
between the people and their rulers.

609
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,033
It was reversed.
The people no longer worked for or were 

610
00:39:53,531 --> 00:39:56,560
owned by the government,
but the government worked for B,

611
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:59,080
the people.
These are John Locke's ideas,

612
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:02,260
very liberating ideas.
Power is now with the people,

613
00:40:02,261 --> 00:40:07,261
a large group and they only lend it via 
elections to some few of their number to

614
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:08,614
rule them temporarily.
And because of the people choose their 

615
00:40:11,801 --> 00:40:15,370
rulers in elections,
they came to see themselves as both free

616
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,233
and self governing and self governing.
People being a large group require free 

617
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:22,750
speech to deliberate about their 
options,

618
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,240
the laws,
the war,

619
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:27,430
peace who will represent them and so on.

620
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:29,280
Yeah,

621
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,113
and free speech therefore involves 
challenging ideas about what we should 

622
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:34,914
do as a community and it's essential 
that they're challenged over and over 

623
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:44,820
again to learn the strengths and 
weaknesses of these monumental decisions

624
00:40:44,821 --> 00:40:45,654
that we make.
This can only be done in dialogue where 

625
00:40:49,051 --> 00:40:49,560
credit,
uh,

626
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:54,560
no criticisms are off limits,
but elective officials with authority or

627
00:40:54,811 --> 00:40:57,690
other vested interests are always 
tempted to limit the discussion.

628
00:40:57,691 --> 00:41:01,080
Of course.
The other thing I should say is that the

629
00:41:01,081 --> 00:41:04,080
liberal education,
which is what universities are,

630
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,033
are supposed to be offering,
was originally thought to be an 

631
00:41:07,981 --> 00:41:11,040
education in liberty.
Self governing.

632
00:41:11,041 --> 00:41:15,270
People need to be educated in some way 
in the craft of leadership.

633
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,493
And the liberal education meant 
familiarizing yourself with some of the 

634
00:41:19,591 --> 00:41:24,591
core texts that helped people to become 
free so that they can understand that.

635
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,390
Yeah,

636
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:31,170
there's not a lot of that going on.
Even at great universities.

637
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:35,180
It's kind of like a boutique niche study
at this point,

638
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:39,620
but that's why they were called the 
liberal arts and education to liberty.

639
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:43,130
Now,
this is very important for us today.

640
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,420
Democracies aren't perfect.
Um,

641
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,313
we can be a great friend of democracy,
but the greatest of friends does not 

642
00:41:52,401 --> 00:41:57,401
flatter his friend.
Nil observed that in democracies,

643
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:58,643
even though the people rule,
there can still be threats to free 

644
00:42:01,681 --> 00:42:02,514
speech and liberty.
This is because strictly speaking in 

645
00:42:05,101 --> 00:42:08,220
democracy,
not all people rule at any one time.

646
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:09,443
Rather the majority rules and the 
majority holds sway not just over 

647
00:42:13,021 --> 00:42:13,854
government,
but over large sectors of public 

648
00:42:15,841 --> 00:42:17,280
opinion.
As Tocqueville,

649
00:42:17,281 --> 00:42:20,220
Alexis de Tocqueville observed in 
democracy,

650
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:25,670
a tyranny of the majority can always 
arise in which the many can suppress the

651
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,264
few,

652
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:34,140
the majority inflated by their power,
their sense of self certainty,

653
00:42:34,141 --> 00:42:34,974
their sense of legitimacy brought about 
by their greater number of their bulk 

654
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:41,520
can begin to act with a reckless 
confidence and indifference to others,

655
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:42,683
perhaps not unlike an absolute prince.
So following Tocqueville mill paid much 

656
00:42:48,151 --> 00:42:48,984
attention to the fact that custom and 
public opinion in common ideas can also 

657
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:56,280
tyrannized over people.
And that in fact,

658
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,413
often in our everyday life,
these customs and these opinions can be 

659
00:43:02,461 --> 00:43:03,294
actually more problematic than even 
government and laws because it can put 

660
00:43:07,951 --> 00:43:11,340
limits on liberty of those who think and
act differently from the rest.

661
00:43:11,341 --> 00:43:13,450
And it can do,
do it by all measure.

662
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:18,570
All I'll all different means shaming 
ostracism and sober so that you can ruin

663
00:43:19,891 --> 00:43:21,660
a life with these things.

664
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,350
Okay,

665
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:29,060
so why do I say that?
Freedom of speech,

666
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:33,290
especially in it's,
it's essential for all of us.

667
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:36,140
We can't function without it in a 
democracy.

668
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,363
But why is it especially important for,
for people who were from minorities and 

669
00:43:41,241 --> 00:43:43,850
marginalized groups,
people who carry minority opinions?

670
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,163
I'm sure many of you carry minority 
opinions in some areas it's this one 

671
00:43:50,601 --> 00:43:55,601
person can't out vote 100 and minority 
can never vote a majority,

672
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:02,380
but one person or a minority with a 
superior argument can publish,

673
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,790
write and speak to a hundred or a 
thousand or 10,000 or a million people.

674
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:08,983
And that gives them a chance.
That's why it's falling for members of 

675
00:44:13,341 --> 00:44:15,470
smaller groups to undermine freedom of 
speech.

676
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,580
Absolute folly.

677
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,013
Yeah.

678
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:24,190
Now what about the psychology of the 
person who's doing the undermining here?

679
00:44:24,681 --> 00:44:25,514
Mill says,
introduces a theme to deny others for 

680
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:33,700
speech is to presume oneself fallible.
A person,

681
00:44:36,831 --> 00:44:37,664
they say,
I'm denying you speech because you make 

682
00:44:38,961 --> 00:44:39,794
me feel,
because what you do will lead to 

683
00:44:41,691 --> 00:44:42,524
violence,
but they're presuming it will lead to 

684
00:44:45,261 --> 00:44:48,900
violence.
They have to show it or prove it.

685
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:50,183
So here's what mel says,
the opinion which is attempted to 

686
00:44:52,591 --> 00:44:55,920
suppress by authority,
they possibly be true.

687
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,030
Those who desire to suppress it,
of course deny its truth,

688
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:01,463
but they are not infallible.
They have no authority to decide the 

689
00:45:04,171 --> 00:45:05,004
question for all mankind and exclude 
every other person from the means of 

690
00:45:09,211 --> 00:45:10,044
judging.
Now I submit to you that is a very 

691
00:45:11,821 --> 00:45:15,810
democratic sentiment.
It's respectful of other people.

692
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:18,220
Yeah.

693
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:22,660
He goes on about those who silence 
others to refuse a hearing to an opinion

694
00:45:22,661 --> 00:45:25,150
because they are sure that is,
it is false,

695
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:30,360
is to assume that their certainty is 
absolutely is the same thing as absolute

696
00:45:31,001 --> 00:45:31,834
certainty.
All silencing of discussion is an 

697
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:35,710
assumption of infallibility.

698
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:38,500
Okay.

699
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,333
You know,
I find it so interesting that as the 

700
00:45:42,821 --> 00:45:47,821
forced speech debate has developed that 
in the public domain,

701
00:45:48,311 --> 00:45:52,420
there have been so few lawyers speaking 
up for free speech.

702
00:45:52,421 --> 00:45:56,230
I can tell you that 25 years ago it 
would not have been the case.

703
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:01,000
Um,
it's also interesting that you know,

704
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:01,863
our finest text,
our most comprehensive text I would say 

705
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:06,813
on liberty is written not by a lawyer,
someone who loves order and seeks rules 

706
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:14,890
for ordering things,
but by a philosopher,

707
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:16,623
a man who knows that it's,
it is often hard to know things for 

708
00:46:18,971 --> 00:46:21,130
certain.
And who likes socrates,

709
00:46:21,131 --> 00:46:21,964
who influenced this book sometimes sees 
that his greatest asset is knowing that 

710
00:46:26,111 --> 00:46:26,944
he doesn't know.
This is the wisdom of acknowledging our 

711
00:46:30,251 --> 00:46:31,084
ignorance when we have it.
In such wisdom has the effect of 

712
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:34,624
moderating us by creating intellectual 
humility which can actually help people 

713
00:46:39,581 --> 00:46:40,414
get along

714
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:42,890
okay.

715
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:44,420
Again,
and this is really,

716
00:46:44,421 --> 00:46:45,254
really important.
You don't know your side if you don't 

717
00:46:48,651 --> 00:46:51,590
know their side.
Quote mill,

718
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:55,910
he who knows only his own side of the 
case knows little of that.

719
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:00,230
His reasons may be good and no one may 
have been able to refute them,

720
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:04,160
but if he has equally unable to refute 
the reasons on the opposite side,

721
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:07,340
if he does not so much as know what they
are,

722
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:10,250
he has no grounds for preferring either 
opinion.

723
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,360
Tell that to your favorite.
No at all.

724
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:19,410
Okay.

725
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:20,243
This may be one of the two or three most
important points I'm going to make 

726
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,393
today.
If government wants to take away the 

727
00:47:28,201 --> 00:47:29,034
speech of someone you dislike or force 
people to say things and you agree with 

728
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:33,724
it,
it's worse to go along when you agree 

729
00:47:37,391 --> 00:47:38,224
with it.

730
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:39,390
Okay.

731
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:40,800
Mill,
let us suppose.

732
00:47:40,801 --> 00:47:41,634
Therefore that the government is 
entirely at one with the people and 

733
00:47:44,731 --> 00:47:45,564
never thinks of exerting any power of 
coercion unless in agreement with what 

734
00:47:49,621 --> 00:47:50,454
it conceives to be their voice.
But I deny the right of the people to 

735
00:47:54,781 --> 00:47:59,220
exercise such coersion either by 
themselves or by their government.

736
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:02,190
The power itself,
is it legitimate?

737
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:06,810
The best government has no more title to
it than the worst.

738
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:08,503
It is as noxious or more noxious when 
exerted in accordance with public 

739
00:48:12,541 --> 00:48:15,630
opinion.
Then when in opposition to it,

740
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:21,390
and I think it's more noxious.
So this is why you shouldn't agree to be

741
00:48:21,391 --> 00:48:22,224
forced to do what you believe in.
It's even more noxious to give 

742
00:48:25,561 --> 00:48:26,394
government power when it's doing so as 
an accord with public opinion or yours 

743
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:30,893
because the coercion is sweetened.
And that way can develop without 

744
00:48:35,551 --> 00:48:36,384
opposition in this short sided way,
we and feeble our chief protection 

745
00:48:40,531 --> 00:48:41,760
against tyranny,
he liberty.

746
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:48,470
Now I want to switch to a different 
ground and I'm going to talk about um,

747
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,200
three different approaches to the 
infallible mind,

748
00:48:52,201 --> 00:48:55,950
the divided brain.
So it's a bit of a neuroscientific,

749
00:48:55,951 --> 00:48:56,784
take some things on psychological 
development and then something called 

750
00:49:00,331 --> 00:49:01,164
the inability to mentalize,
which is a series of clinical 

751
00:49:03,121 --> 00:49:03,954
observations.
So this is our brain and it's divided 

752
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:11,490
and it's divided for a reason.
A lot of people know it's divided,

753
00:49:11,491 --> 00:49:14,970
but don't think about the reason our 
spleen doesn't seem to be divided,

754
00:49:14,971 --> 00:49:17,760
not every organ.
Our stomach is not divided in this way.

755
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:22,290
Not Every Oregon appears to be 
symmetrical and divided

756
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:25,413
and the divided brain isn't about 
language being on one side and 

757
00:49:28,211 --> 00:49:29,044
creativity on the other.
That was a simplification that came out 

758
00:49:31,511 --> 00:49:36,511
of the 60s there's little bits of truth 
to it,

759
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,570
but it's far too simplified.
But there are actually some very,

760
00:49:40,571 --> 00:49:43,180
very significant differences between the
two sides of the brain.

761
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:48,310
And the person who put this together is 
doctor Ian mcgilchrist.

762
00:49:48,311 --> 00:49:51,910
He's a psychiatrist and he's an 
outstanding intellect.

763
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:54,760
If he was a great student of literature 
as well,

764
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:58,780
and this is his book,
the master and his emissary.

765
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:01,643
Okay.

766
00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:06,140
Now if you look at the,
this is looking at the brain from below,

767
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:09,320
so you don't usually do that.
I understand.

768
00:50:09,321 --> 00:50:14,321
But if you were underneath the brain and
you looked at it very carefully,

769
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,633
in fact,
you would find that it's broader at the 

770
00:50:18,201 --> 00:50:21,590
right on the front and brought her on 
the back of the left.

771
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:22,753
So you know it's only very grossly that 
it looks like the two hemispheres are 

772
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:31,220
and inside the connections are also 
quite different.

773
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:32,083
So for instance,
the length of the connections between 

774
00:50:34,311 --> 00:50:35,144
cells in the right hemisphere is much 
longer and it goes deep into the 

775
00:50:38,481 --> 00:50:42,320
emotional parts of the brain and reads a
lot of what's going on in the body.

776
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:44,180
And the left brain connections are 
short.

777
00:50:44,181 --> 00:50:45,770
It's like they're all talking to each 
other.

778
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:49,670
Now,
one of the ways to get at

779
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,113
the very broad difference between the 
left hemisphere and the right sometimes 

780
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:57,094
called the left brain and the right,
imagine a bird pecking for seeds among 

781
00:51:00,221 --> 00:51:04,600
these stones and grit.
So to eat,

782
00:51:04,601 --> 00:51:05,434
it's got to focus very narrowly on the 
little seed and pick it out against the 

783
00:51:09,131 --> 00:51:14,131
background grid narrow focus.
But it also has to keep a wide focus and

784
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,154
keep on the lookout for new dangerous or
opportunities that might come on the 

785
00:51:17,831 --> 00:51:20,410
scene like predators,
potential mates,

786
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:23,860
or other food sources.
So this is more like reality.

787
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:28,630
One of those birds is pecking,
but it's also aware that there's another

788
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,230
comrade bird nearby.

789
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:34,850
How does it do that?

790
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:39,383
The narrow focus and the wide focus are 
actually handled by different 

791
00:51:42,211 --> 00:51:43,044
hemispheres of the brain.
Now this is something very neat about a 

792
00:51:45,691 --> 00:51:46,524
bird's brain.
It's wired so that let's say the right 

793
00:51:48,181 --> 00:51:52,290
eye is completely processed by the left 
hemisphere.

794
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:53,453
So human beings aren't quite like that.
So everything that comes in the window 

795
00:51:56,101 --> 00:51:58,530
or the right eye is processed in the 
left hemisphere.

796
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:03,900
So the left hemisphere does all of that 
narrow focus work to identify the little

797
00:52:03,901 --> 00:52:05,520
bits of seed.
You're going to have to trust me,

798
00:52:05,521 --> 00:52:07,500
this is going to be relevant to 
political correctness.

799
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:13,650
It focuses on something.
It already knows this I've important.

800
00:52:13,651 --> 00:52:15,540
So this is a big thing about the left 
hemisphere.

801
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,630
It focuses on what it already knows is 
important.

802
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:22,080
Seeds
and the right hemisphere.

803
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:27,920
It takes the world in as a whole.
So it's window to the world is the birds

804
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:29,244
left eye.

805
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:34,620
So it's vigilantly,
vigilantly searching for novelty,

806
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:38,760
what's not already know a Predator her 
perhaps a new me.

807
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:41,940
It's looking for something new that 
might be of importance,

808
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:45,600
but who knows what that would be.
So the right hemispheres,

809
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:46,733
attention is open minded and broadminded
because it doesn't quite know what it's 

810
00:52:51,271 --> 00:52:52,104
looking for and these things are going 
on at the same time through different 

811
00:52:55,981 --> 00:53:00,660
eyes and different hemispheres.
It's not just switching back and forth.

812
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:02,490
Okay,
that's a bird.

813
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:07,140
What about humans?
Our eyes are wired slightly differently,

814
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:11,430
but the right hemisphere in humans is 
astoundingly similar.

815
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:12,323
It sees holistically.
So before things are digested into 

816
00:53:14,821 --> 00:53:16,440
parts,
it takes in the whole,

817
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,620
it seeks novelty.
It seeks out the unknown,

818
00:53:19,621 --> 00:53:22,560
a new information.
And because it's holistic,

819
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:27,570
it sees everything in context.
It has a sustained broad,

820
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:30,690
open alertness.
It sees relationships.

821
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,560
That's about context and very important 
for our discussion today.

822
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:38,340
It sees individuals.
It sees if you,

823
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:42,870
if you discover a human being and you 
see them as a unique individual in their

824
00:53:42,871 --> 00:53:44,730
wholeness,
not in their parts,

825
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:48,330
but how they all come together.
That is a right brain function.

826
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:50,123
It is not abstract at all.
When you meet someone else who have you 

827
00:53:53,101 --> 00:53:56,250
never met for the first time,
it's a unique experience.

828
00:53:57,390 --> 00:54:02,070
You're not generalizing from it yet.
It is the seat of empathy.

829
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:02,933
It's where we learn to read facial 
expressions and the emotions of others 

830
00:54:06,181 --> 00:54:09,060
and our own emotions and because it sees
context,

831
00:54:09,210 --> 00:54:13,770
it sees humor lighten up.
It understands metaphor.

832
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,490
It perceives emotional subtlety and 
nuance

833
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:22,060
and the left hemisphere in humans 
narrow,

834
00:54:22,061 --> 00:54:22,894
sharply focused attention to detail.
It is actually tasked by the right 

835
00:54:27,041 --> 00:54:27,874
hemisphere when something new and 
important is perceived to begin to map 

836
00:54:32,111 --> 00:54:32,944
it in fine detail and then it's maps 
produced isolated parts more than 

837
00:54:39,221 --> 00:54:40,054
relationships or context.
Think of that book drawing on the right 

838
00:54:42,731 --> 00:54:43,564
side of the brain.
If you've ever taken that course and 

839
00:54:44,891 --> 00:54:46,270
you'll understand what I'm talking 
about.

840
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:50,800
It identifies things by abstract labels,
not context,

841
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:54,620
and it works with categories of people,
categories,

842
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,810
not individuals.
So whenever people are over generalizing

843
00:54:58,811 --> 00:54:59,710
about people,

844
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:02,123
it has a left hemisphere flavor.
Language is interpreted differently on 

845
00:55:05,911 --> 00:55:06,744
the left and the right.
It's interpreted literally it's 

846
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:11,100
humorless because there's no sense of 
context.

847
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:14,490
It's abstract.
It rest things from their context.

848
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:18,870
Context.
Abstract is from the Latin draw away,

849
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:20,160
so what do I need?

850
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,533
Okay,

851
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:23,583
how did the things that the left 
hemisphere does when it makes this map 

852
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:31,200
of the world is it confuses the map with
the world.

853
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:32,363
We've all heard this,
don't confuse the map with the 

854
00:55:33,451 --> 00:55:34,284
territory.
That's a really good left hemisphere 

855
00:55:36,871 --> 00:55:38,700
thing to do.
Now,

856
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:41,063
where is all of this data coming from?
It's coming from hundreds and hundreds 

857
00:55:44,171 --> 00:55:47,140
of studies of patients with strokes who 
lose Maine,

858
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,870
right hemisphere function or left 
hemisphere is function.

859
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,013
Or we can use certain kinds of magnetic 
devices and apply it to the brain and 

860
00:55:54,521 --> 00:55:55,354
shut down parts of the brain and see 
what the remaining hemisphere is like 

861
00:55:58,301 --> 00:55:59,134
and then give them all sorts of 
cognitive tests and we can actually 

862
00:56:01,571 --> 00:56:02,404
inject anesthetic into certain arteries 
and shut down a whole hemisphere of the 

863
00:56:05,471 --> 00:56:06,760
brain.
So there's many,

864
00:56:06,761 --> 00:56:11,140
many ways that really thousands and 
thousands of scientists have have gotten

865
00:56:11,141 --> 00:56:14,650
at this.
So the map is felt,

866
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:17,320
so when people have certain kinds of 
left hemispheric strokes,

867
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:18,543
sorry,
when they have certain kinds of right 

868
00:56:19,601 --> 00:56:22,420
hemispheric strokes and they're left 
just with the left hemisphere,

869
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:25,210
we can see how concrete people are about
maps.

870
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:26,793
No,
the problem is with good map is as good 

871
00:56:29,351 --> 00:56:32,320
as it is,
is the world is always changing and maps

872
00:56:32,321 --> 00:56:36,010
become quickly out of date.
There's a few that may not come out of,

873
00:56:36,011 --> 00:56:37,270
you know,
go out of date quickly.

874
00:56:37,271 --> 00:56:39,820
Like gravity seems to be what it's 
always been.

875
00:56:40,450 --> 00:56:45,450
But the left hemisphere is kind of like 
that person who when lost in,

876
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:47,963
you know,
on a,

877
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:52,810
on a car ride says to his spouse,
we can't be lost.

878
00:56:52,811 --> 00:56:53,644
It's right here on the map.
We're in the right place and he says it 

879
00:56:56,711 --> 00:56:58,930
over and over again even though they're 
not.

880
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,090
So it's got to kind of know it all.
Listen,

881
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:03,670
a flavor of infallibility,
if you will.

882
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:06,953
Let me give you an example of
a literal versus non literal 

883
00:57:10,891 --> 00:57:11,724
interpretation.
Imagine I was visiting your home and I 

884
00:57:14,371 --> 00:57:16,380
started to breakout in a sweat and I 
said,

885
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:18,240
you know,
it must be 90 degrees in here.

886
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:22,350
Now a literal interpretation would be 
norman has made a statement,

887
00:57:22,370 --> 00:57:23,203
a meteor,
a logical statement about the 

888
00:57:24,001 --> 00:57:24,834
temperature.
A non literal interpretation would be 

889
00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:29,310
normally,
would you like me to open the window?

890
00:57:29,311 --> 00:57:30,144
Now
that statement takes into account the 

891
00:57:33,431 --> 00:57:38,431
context of my statement.
It's relationship to me,

892
00:57:38,811 --> 00:57:41,840
the speaker,
and to the overall environment.

893
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:46,550
It requires indirect interpretation and 
empathy.

894
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:50,630
And these are right hemispheric 
attributes.

895
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:53,480
So here they are,
the difference on the left,

896
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:54,950
isolated,
no contacts,

897
00:57:54,951 --> 00:57:56,750
no relationships,
sees categories,

898
00:57:56,751 --> 00:57:59,960
abstraction generalization tends to 
infallibility.

899
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:01,003
Rigid maps are the reality.
And I would suggest to you when there's 

900
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:06,013
bigotry,
it's coming out of this kind of move 

901
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:11,650
plus many other things,
it theology,

902
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:12,620
emotion,
et Cetera.

903
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:15,770
But from a cognitive point,
this is

904
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:21,280
part of it and the right is holistic.
It's sees individuals at once.

905
00:58:21,281 --> 00:58:22,270
New Information.

906
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:25,413
Okay,
I'm going to link some of that up 

907
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:28,563
loosely with some things about 
developmental psychology that are 

908
00:58:31,391 --> 00:58:33,820
relevant for political correctness.
I'll tie it together.

909
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:38,270
This is John Paij.
Um,

910
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:39,273
probably the greatest developmental 
psychologist who ever lived and one of 

911
00:58:43,451 --> 00:58:45,300
the things he tried to do is describe 
norm,

912
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:48,880
normal cognitive development.
And he got a lot of it right.

913
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:52,330
A lot of it holds up very well.
Even cross culturally,

914
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:53,703
there are some things,
and I'm into the plastic brain as you 

915
00:58:56,351 --> 00:58:57,184
know,
that can happen slightly differently in 

916
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:01,630
other places,
but he made very,

917
00:59:01,631 --> 00:59:06,631
very broad observations after years and 
years of very fine detailed work.

918
00:59:07,390 --> 00:59:08,223
So here's some things he found out.
There's an early cognitive stage from 

919
00:59:11,411 --> 00:59:15,160
two to seven where children don't 
understand the logic and they have a lot

920
00:59:15,161 --> 00:59:18,370
of magical thinking.
They have a limited sense that they have

921
00:59:18,371 --> 00:59:20,770
a mind that is perceiving the world from
their tick,

922
00:59:20,771 --> 00:59:23,120
from particular point of view.
In fact,

923
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:25,490
some of them probably don't have any 
sense of that.

924
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:27,673
And I'll go into that.
And then there's this thing called 

925
00:59:29,961 --> 00:59:30,794
centrism.
They can only focus on one aspect of a 

926
00:59:32,301 --> 00:59:33,350
situation at a time.

927
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:35,220
Okay.

928
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:39,360
And this is related to egocentrism,
which is a kind of,

929
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:43,200
where do I fit in the world?
Um,

930
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:45,203
sort of concept.
It's not just about selfishness during 

931
00:59:48,991 --> 00:59:49,824
this stage.
Their communication and thoughts are 

932
00:59:51,121 --> 00:59:51,954
generally about themselves,
somewhat limited ability to see 

933
00:59:55,741 --> 00:59:56,574
situations from another's point of view.
They tend to assume that others see the 

934
01:00:00,121 --> 01:00:00,954
world is they do.
And some people can remain egocentric 

935
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:06,570
all their lives.
Um,

936
01:00:06,750 --> 01:00:07,583
and many,
if not all of us can under great 

937
01:00:09,421 --> 01:00:10,254
emotional pressure or physical illness,
regress and show signs of egocentrism 

938
01:00:14,341 --> 01:00:17,130
that we normally don't.
Now,

939
01:00:17,131 --> 01:00:19,320
why are children egocentric?
Well,

940
01:00:19,321 --> 01:00:20,154
there's a number of reasons for this,
but one very simple reason that's hard 

941
01:00:23,461 --> 01:00:26,160
to get out of your head once you get it 
in your head is this,

942
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:27,593
children at this age are quite 
cognitively focused on the external 

943
01:00:30,991 --> 01:00:31,824
physical world,
which can be observed and what they can 

944
01:00:35,281 --> 01:00:36,114
observe of the social world.
But our internal mental states are not 

945
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:41,094
directly observable period.
So the young child really has a concept 

946
01:00:45,181 --> 01:00:46,014
of mental states or the mind.
This means there's a kind of mind 

947
01:00:50,071 --> 01:00:52,860
blindness,
limited awareness that other people have

948
01:00:52,861 --> 01:00:53,694
minds and more importantly there is a 
limited awareness that they themselves 

949
01:00:56,911 --> 01:01:01,500
have an invisible mine that is 
interpreting reality and each of you try

950
01:01:01,501 --> 01:01:03,900
to remember that moment in your life

951
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:07,810
if you can.
When you realized,

952
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:13,310
actually this is me processing all of 
this.

953
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:19,570
I remember I was in nursery school and I
was looking at what if no,

954
01:01:19,911 --> 01:01:22,880
no divinity spoke to me at the time that
I'm aware of.

955
01:01:22,881 --> 01:01:27,881
I was looking at some sticks and I was 
just right and I realized I'm looking at

956
01:01:30,081 --> 01:01:34,250
those sticks and other people aren't 
seeing those sticks and some or other.

957
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:35,203
It's self consciousness,
self awareness and the awareness that I 

958
01:01:41,181 --> 01:01:42,014
had in mind and that therefore other 
people had mines crystallized at that 

959
01:01:45,441 --> 01:01:48,680
moment for me and each of you probably 
had that experience.

960
01:01:48,681 --> 01:01:50,030
Did they?
Do any of you remember that?

961
01:01:58,620 --> 01:01:59,453
Now what happens if you're not aware 
that you have a mind that's processing 

962
01:02:01,921 --> 01:02:02,754
everything?
Your subjective experience of events 

963
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:05,873
seems like the only reality.
You are not aware that your experience 

964
01:02:08,721 --> 01:02:12,780
is just your take on events,
that it might be a misinterpretation,

965
01:02:12,781 --> 01:02:15,180
a false belief,
or a product of your experience.

966
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:18,300
Interpretations are often centered on 
the self.

967
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,940
Think the child whose parents are 
getting divorced,

968
01:02:20,941 --> 01:02:23,610
who thinks it's my fault,
it must be my fault.

969
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,200
That's egocentrism.
Now we gradually grow out of it.

970
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:33,230
The next stage from seven to 11 shows 
the beginning of new brain maturation.

971
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,420
The child begins to use inductive logic 
becomes,

972
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:40,770
becomes aware of the existence of other 
minds.

973
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:45,780
And this can often happen when they 
realize that you can fool people,

974
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:50,310
that people can have false beliefs.
And so piaget did experiments on this,

975
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:54,510
but for there to be a false belief means
that there's gotta be an internal mental

976
01:02:54,511 --> 01:02:59,511
process in the person who has the false 
belief that can be misled or mistaken is

977
01:03:00,181 --> 01:03:02,370
somehow different,
is processing events.

978
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:07,950
And then development proceeds and 
abstract reasoning kicks in.

979
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:10,950
Children can think logically and 
language.

980
01:03:10,951 --> 01:03:15,240
They don't take everything literally,
and children always love stories,

981
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,790
but at this,
at this point in time,

982
01:03:17,791 --> 01:03:18,624
they can begin to analyze the literature
and get much more deeply into the minds 

983
01:03:22,591 --> 01:03:23,610
of the characters

984
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:28,183
so they're mentally rising.
The ability to appreciate the one has a 

985
01:03:30,531 --> 01:03:34,010
mind that interprets reality and that 
other people have such a mind

986
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:39,760
when you mentally as well,
you don't even know you're doing it.

987
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:41,980
It's automatic.
It's unconscious.

988
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:47,800
We realize too that we make inferences 
about reality all the time and are prone

989
01:03:47,801 --> 01:03:48,634
to error.
We realize that the mental states of 

990
01:03:51,131 --> 01:03:51,964
other people change rapidly and the only
sensible way to know what their feeling 

991
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:59,350
is to inquire or to take a curious 
stance.

992
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:02,680
If Socrates was the smartest man in 
ancient Greece,

993
01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:03,723
why did he spend all of his time talking
to other people were who were his 

994
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:12,480
arguably has inferiors much of the time 
it's because there's something moe toric

995
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:17,890
about thinking and learning and that's 
why dialogue is a very important thing.

996
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,230
So you can say,
you know,

997
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,780
I'd be pretty good in a totalitarian 
regime.

998
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:27,100
I'm very independently minded.
I would just keep my mouth shut.

999
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:29,980
And if there was no freedom of speech,
I'd never expressed myself.

1000
01:04:30,730 --> 01:04:34,270
And that might work.
And also you might get very,

1001
01:04:34,271 --> 01:04:35,104
very sick.
You might get sick because it might be 

1002
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:40,413
that if thinking is so important to you 
than expressing it and interacting with 

1003
01:04:44,861 --> 01:04:48,040
people about it might just be the thing 
you need.

1004
01:04:48,041 --> 01:04:49,180
The way,
you know,

1005
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:52,900
some of us need to breathe air.
So

1006
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:57,780
when we mentally as well,
we can focus on others.

1007
01:04:59,100 --> 01:04:59,933
We can form stable relationships.
This is all the opposite of the 

1008
01:05:04,351 --> 01:05:07,710
infallible frame of mind.
Now,

1009
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:11,790
I want to talk about the absence of 
mentalization in adults,

1010
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:13,103
not in kids.
There are many situations where we lose 

1011
01:05:16,591 --> 01:05:18,760
awareness that we have a mind 
interpreting reality.

1012
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,310
As I said,
high states of stress and emotion.

1013
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:26,440
And some people never develop the 
ability to mentalize in the first place.

1014
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:31,900
And some have mental illnesses that make
it hard to mentalize,

1015
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:35,350
um,
or to think or imagine if you're trapped

1016
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:38,580
in a very intense delusion,
um,

1017
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:42,610
you are probably not mental ising.
Um,

1018
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:46,270
one of the things we've learned about 
men,

1019
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:47,133
we've learned a lot about mentalizing 
it's absence by studying the autistic 

1020
01:05:50,411 --> 01:05:55,090
spectrum.
And for a number of autistic children,

1021
01:05:55,091 --> 01:05:56,620
it's very,
very difficult.

1022
01:05:56,621 --> 01:06:00,970
It could be very high on the spectrum 
and have difficulty reading,

1023
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:04,170
um,
emotions and mentalizing other minds.

1024
01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:05,283
In fact,
the term mind blindness came out of the 

1025
01:06:07,511 --> 01:06:08,344
literature on autism.
And children with autism are teased 

1026
01:06:11,951 --> 01:06:13,570
mercilessly as,
as you know,

1027
01:06:13,571 --> 01:06:14,404
it's awful.
And imagine what it's like for them not 

1028
01:06:17,711 --> 01:06:20,800
being able to understand other minds 
when kids are teasing them,

1029
01:06:20,801 --> 01:06:21,634
when they miss things.
And then they will also misinterpret 

1030
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:26,950
teasing or things that were,
were very gentle remarks.

1031
01:06:26,951 --> 01:06:28,580
Not to meant to,
um,

1032
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:31,180
to tease the child if you can't mentally
wise.

1033
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:32,460
So it,
it's,

1034
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:35,770
it's a terrible trap.
There's another thing that happens,

1035
01:06:35,771 --> 01:06:40,210
which where people arguably can 
mentalize but they don't.

1036
01:06:40,211 --> 01:06:43,120
And that's in extreme forms of 
narcissism.

1037
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:46,890
So what the narcissist pers does,
and it's just imagine,

1038
01:06:46,891 --> 01:06:49,240
uh,
imagine I'm a big narcissist.

1039
01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:52,150
Um,
what I do is,

1040
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:54,790
and I'm dealing with,
with you,

1041
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:56,393
uh,
I take all of my negative qualities and 

1042
01:06:58,220 --> 01:06:59,860
I attribute to,
to them,

1043
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:02,800
to you rather,
I keep all my,

1044
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:04,750
my good qualities.

1045
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:08,800
So now I'm very pure,
but I don't stop there.

1046
01:07:08,801 --> 01:07:13,801
Then I plagiarize all your special 
qualities and ti think their mine.

1047
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:17,470
So if you're in a meeting with a 
narcissist,

1048
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:20,080
you come up with a great idea.
He says,

1049
01:07:20,081 --> 01:07:20,914
what a great meeting.
I can't believe I came up with that 

1050
01:07:22,721 --> 01:07:23,630
idea.
You know?

1051
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:24,963
So imagine you're in a knowledge culture
or in a situation where knowledge is 

1052
01:07:29,471 --> 01:07:34,471
important or an ethnic group or 
knowledge is important and you can get a

1053
01:07:34,961 --> 01:07:37,030
lot of narcissistic,
know what all of them going on,

1054
01:07:37,031 --> 01:07:38,560
right?
Um,

1055
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,313
people who never formed close,
secure attachments with others to help 

1056
01:07:44,681 --> 01:07:49,030
them read their feelings
will have difficulty.

1057
01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:54,031
Mentalizing and there's a lot of 
psychiatric conditions where people have

1058
01:07:55,811 --> 01:07:57,700
grown up.
Without that input,

1059
01:07:58,300 --> 01:07:59,133
there was nothing malign.
The parents may have had difficulty 

1060
01:08:01,631 --> 01:08:02,464
reading emotions,
but then the child has difficulty 

1061
01:08:04,481 --> 01:08:06,580
reading emotions and difficulty 
mentalizing.

1062
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:12,760
But you can see there's just many 
different causes of metalizing and

1063
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:16,270
about,

1064
01:08:16,270 --> 01:08:17,103
so I've said that in autism there's 
often a lot of right hemisphere damage 

1065
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,780
that helps to explain some of the mental
ising problems.

1066
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:25,183
But you know,
in very high trauma in Ptsd for 

1067
01:08:27,621 --> 01:08:28,454
instance,
we now know that the right hemisphere 

1068
01:08:30,201 --> 01:08:34,280
parts of it actually go offline.
They stopped processing.

1069
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:37,880
And remember,
that's the hemisphere that helps you pay

1070
01:08:37,881 --> 01:08:40,490
attention to novelty.
So you're stuck in a trauma,

1071
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:43,070
you're reliving it over and over again.
You're in a new situation,

1072
01:08:43,190 --> 01:08:47,900
but you can't even notice the new 
situation and a lot of your feelings and

1073
01:08:47,901 --> 01:08:51,980
your cognition is cut down and you can't
even read emotion properly.

1074
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:55,730
We need to be able to read emotion to 
read minds.

1075
01:08:57,650 --> 01:08:58,970
When we can't,
mental wise,

1076
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:03,500
our mental reality becomes the outer 
reality.

1077
01:09:03,501 --> 01:09:05,390
They're equivalent,
they're isomorphic.

1078
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:06,793
Our internal world has all the power of 
the external world and all our thoughts 

1079
01:09:10,191 --> 01:09:13,370
feel real and as vivid as intense 
sensory experience.

1080
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:16,310
We can be terrified by our own mental 
experience.

1081
01:09:16,311 --> 01:09:20,700
Therefore it's so vivid and we lack the 
normal ways of reassuring ourselves such

1082
01:09:20,710 --> 01:09:21,543
as saying,
I'm just imagining this or it might not 

1083
01:09:23,691 --> 01:09:25,370
happen.
That doesn't happen.

1084
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:28,940
It's all real.
So our negative thoughts about ourselves

1085
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,680
and others feel totally unalterable.
They're set in concrete and remember,

1086
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:37,700
you don't have to be mentally ill to 
experience this kind of thing.

1087
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:43,060
Any of us can slip into my mentalizing 
in extreme situations and we become mind

1088
01:09:43,901 --> 01:09:44,734
blind.

1089
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:47,863
How does that play out though?
We become intolerant of alternative 

1090
01:09:51,261 --> 01:09:53,780
perspectives.
We are humorless.

1091
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:55,623
We are predisposed to massive 
generalizations and speak in absolute 

1092
01:09:58,311 --> 01:10:00,080
terms.
Men are always,

1093
01:10:00,081 --> 01:10:00,914
women are always,
we understand language literally and 

1094
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:08,810
often misunderstand nuance and so we 
tend to misinterpret others.

1095
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:12,230
This is important because we can't read 
them.

1096
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:13,273
We see them as malevolent and we start 
blaming and fault finding and we get 

1097
01:10:18,171 --> 01:10:19,004
angry.

1098
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:25,830
There's rigidity and external focus.
When you don't have an internal life,

1099
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:27,293
we're prone to all or nothing thinking 
our thought processes rigidified we 

1100
01:10:30,841 --> 01:10:33,570
stick to the first explanation that 
occurs to us.

1101
01:10:33,571 --> 01:10:35,190
Thinking about all the arguments,
you know,

1102
01:10:35,550 --> 01:10:38,610
where someone makes it silly first 
explanation and then they dig into it.

1103
01:10:39,420 --> 01:10:40,253
So there's a tendency to rigid quasi and
fallibility and little awareness of how 

1104
01:10:43,801 --> 01:10:47,100
our behavior is impacting others.
We're not mentalizing.

1105
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:49,093
This is really important now,
unable to perceive our internal states 

1106
01:10:52,710 --> 01:10:57,540
as internal.
We focused on externals for just school,

1107
01:10:57,570 --> 01:10:58,560
government,
the job,

1108
01:10:58,561 --> 01:11:03,561
the neighbor and what others say.
And this causes a great problem for us.

1109
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:07,363
We become thin skin because when we're 
over focused on externals and what 

1110
01:11:10,371 --> 01:11:11,204
others say,
and we're unable to step back and 

1111
01:11:13,321 --> 01:11:14,154
reflect our self esteem regulation,
it comes a prisoner of what others 

1112
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:19,074
think.

1113
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:25,420
When we don't mentalize,
we become hyper responsive to the,

1114
01:11:25,421 --> 01:11:26,254
even the most benign criticism.
We are trapped in what we perceive as 

1115
01:11:30,011 --> 01:11:30,844
their point of view about us.
And critical words or disagreement can 

1116
01:11:34,031 --> 01:11:36,820
feel like violence because we're so 
sensitive.

1117
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:40,180
And that's why people say you're 
validating my existence.

1118
01:11:41,650 --> 01:11:46,650
So to summarize this psychological brain
material for things contribute to moving

1119
01:11:47,021 --> 01:11:47,854
towards a state where we don't learn or 
recognize our points of other points of 

1120
01:11:51,191 --> 01:11:52,024
view and tend to wear the infallible 
frame of mind regression to earlier 

1121
01:11:54,851 --> 01:11:59,110
states of functioning under pressure or 
reliance on left brain categorization,

1122
01:11:59,111 --> 01:12:01,600
generalization,
taking things out of context,

1123
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:05,740
and I can tell you I could teach a 
person to become left brained.

1124
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:08,193
I can take any number of ideologies and 
train them to become left brained and 

1125
01:12:13,691 --> 01:12:14,524
turn off their right brain functioning.
Then we can have mind blindness for a 

1126
01:12:17,711 --> 01:12:20,230
variety of causes.
And as a reminder,

1127
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:25,260
George Elliot showed anger makes us feel
divine justice is on our side,

1128
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:29,410
so all the wisdom of the gods is with us
when we are angry.

1129
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:31,053
Now this is the final section of my talk
and these are ancient insights into 

1130
01:12:35,711 --> 01:12:36,910
justice and anger.

1131
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:40,133
Okay?

1132
01:12:40,450 --> 01:12:41,283
As we've said,
political correctness is focused on 

1133
01:12:42,461 --> 01:12:45,580
justice and compassion.
The ancient philosophers,

1134
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:46,990
Plato,
aristotle,

1135
01:12:46,991 --> 01:12:47,950
Socrates,
Xena,

1136
01:12:47,951 --> 01:12:49,900
Fon,
Seneca,

1137
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:52,450
and so on.
Thought a lot about justice,

1138
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:56,620
but they didn't often speak about 
justice in an of itself.

1139
01:12:56,650 --> 01:12:59,140
They saw it as one of four cardinal 
virtues.

1140
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:03,250
And the word for virtue in Greek is 
Eritay and that means excellence.

1141
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:06,910
So it's something you cultivate.
It's an excellent you cultivate.

1142
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:08,373
So the and the four cardinal virtues,
when you look at how they talked about 

1143
01:13:11,351 --> 01:13:12,550
them,
we're often described,

1144
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:15,310
um,
are seen as interdependent.

1145
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:16,623
Cardinal comes from the Latin carto and 
it means that on which something turns 

1146
01:13:20,351 --> 01:13:24,850
or depends like a hinge.
And the idea is that a good life for the

1147
01:13:24,851 --> 01:13:25,684
individual and the community depends on 
cultivating these virtues and you have 

1148
01:13:30,371 --> 01:13:33,280
to do all of them.
What are they?

1149
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:34,840
Justice,
wisdom,

1150
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:38,020
moderation and courage and virtue.

1151
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:40,353
Definition of a virtue.
It's a way of behaving that's conducive 

1152
01:13:42,910 --> 01:13:47,140
to happiness over time,
they have to be cultivated and they have

1153
01:13:47,141 --> 01:13:47,974
to be practiced.
Virtues or way of vices are ways of 

1154
01:13:50,651 --> 01:13:54,520
behaving that are conducive to 
unhappiness and they're also practiced.

1155
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:56,103
Now know this is an important point.
Compassion was not thought to be a 

1156
01:14:00,401 --> 01:14:01,234
virtue.
It's only fairly recently in some 

1157
01:14:04,211 --> 01:14:09,211
respects that compassion was thought,
has become a virtue for the ancients.

1158
01:14:09,930 --> 01:14:13,570
Compassion was a feeling,
something available immediately.

1159
01:14:13,630 --> 01:14:16,210
Almost anyone.
To a child that's,

1160
01:14:16,211 --> 01:14:21,100
it wasn't something that was cultivated.
It was part of the raw material of being

1161
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:22,773
a human being.
I'm aware that there are eastern 

1162
01:14:24,761 --> 01:14:28,240
practices or compassion meditations 
they're in the east.

1163
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:31,390
Compassion was something that was 
treated like a virtue,

1164
01:14:33,490 --> 01:14:38,490
so here's justice.
Justice is a good thing,

1165
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:41,133
so it's understood.
It's a virtue till would seem the more 

1166
01:14:44,321 --> 01:14:45,700
justice we have,
the better,

1167
01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:46,563
the more the merrier.
And this indeed is the assumption of 

1168
01:14:49,121 --> 01:14:49,954
most social justice activism.
How can you have too much of a good 

1169
01:14:52,691 --> 01:14:53,524
thing?
The ancients were interested in balance 

1170
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:00,043
and they saw that the virtues do not 
stand each alone and in fact by 

1171
01:15:05,061 --> 01:15:08,570
themselves they can actually in 
sometimes even be problematic.

1172
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:13,070
They observed that the practice of 
justice for instance,

1173
01:15:13,071 --> 01:15:17,390
without wisdom or moderation often led 
to terrible consequences.

1174
01:15:17,391 --> 01:15:20,840
Even in there in the democracies.
It's a painful truth.

1175
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:26,510
History's greatest crimes have been con 
emitted in the name of justice

1176
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:29,563
in the name of justice,
the Spanish inquisition and name of 

1177
01:15:32,541 --> 01:15:33,374
justice taking this man and anabaptists 
and burning him alive for Harrison in 

1178
01:15:38,841 --> 01:15:42,080
the name of rights are treasured human 
rights.

1179
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,840
The name of the rights of man,
the French revolutions,

1180
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:48,110
Raine of terror,
and this isis,

1181
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:51,290
it's all about justice according to 
them.

1182
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:54,693
So for the Greeks,
justice by itself could spin out of 

1183
01:15:58,721 --> 01:16:03,721
control and moderation was needed.
This is a picture of Delphi where

1184
01:16:06,370 --> 01:16:10,030
our ancient writings tell us nothing in 
excess was inscribed.

1185
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:16,530
So moderation is needed for justice 
because justice is so closely related in

1186
01:16:16,811 --> 01:16:21,010
practice to the wish to punish.
It can be harsh,

1187
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:21,933
it can be vengeful.
Even those of Us Nice people who 

1188
01:16:25,001 --> 01:16:25,834
restrain ourselves from unjust acts 
often feel a strong resentment towards 

1189
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:35,230
lawbreakers and wished to get even we 
say he got away with it kind of implying

1190
01:16:35,231 --> 01:16:36,064
we would've liked to have done it,
but we held back the wish to punish is 

1191
01:16:40,391 --> 01:16:41,224
the wish to hurt.
And Socrates points this out in several 

1192
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:48,391
dialogues very effectively.
So justice must be tempered

1193
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:51,910
and it's tempered by moderation and 
wisdom.

1194
01:16:51,911 --> 01:16:53,410
And the Bible would argue by mercy

1195
01:16:59,220 --> 01:17:04,220
[inaudible].

1196
01:17:09,010 --> 01:17:10,930
Okay,
this is a side of it.

1197
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:16,000
Justice can become suddenly harsh in 
groups.

1198
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:17,013
And Freud pointed out that people in 
groups can readily regress and express 

1199
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:23,080
terrible hostility.

1200
01:17:24,670 --> 01:17:25,503
One of the things he said in group 
psychology and the analysis of the ego 

1201
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:29,193
was in groups.
People delegate their conscience to 

1202
01:17:31,991 --> 01:17:35,710
their chosen leader of the time.
And if the leader sanctions,

1203
01:17:35,711 --> 01:17:36,544
aggression,
suddenly civilized people can rapidly 

1204
01:17:39,671 --> 01:17:40,504
become unbounded by conscience.
And you can see the extraordinary 

1205
01:17:43,421 --> 01:17:44,254
aggression that can be lurking.
I think of antisemitism in the Middle 

1206
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:50,250
Ages.
It wasn't just the sinners who sanctions

1207
01:17:50,251 --> 01:17:53,500
setting Jewish homes,
synagogues and people on fire,

1208
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:57,040
but the saints.
And once a sate says kill,

1209
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:58,593
there's little stopping the crowd from 
becoming cruel because in a way their 

1210
01:18:01,931 --> 01:18:03,550
conscience is permitting it.

1211
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:07,213
Yeah,
you just saw private junk Justice 

1212
01:18:11,450 --> 01:18:16,010
Simpson style.
Private justice is relevant today.

1213
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:17,833
Um,
because of changes I think in the 

1214
01:18:19,701 --> 01:18:22,560
various tribunals and legal codes,
um,

1215
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:25,130
that we're seeing.
Um,

1216
01:18:25,730 --> 01:18:29,150
what's you're privileging subjectivity?
Um,

1217
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:32,870
private justice can escalate false 
claims.

1218
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:36,110
One key reason historically for having 
public justice,

1219
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:36,973
uh,
public justice system was to put an end 

1220
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:39,373
to private feuds and revenge bloodbaths 
when people took justice in their own 

1221
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:43,484
hands.
Of course the original justice was 

1222
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:46,903
people doing justice in their own hands.
So private fuse of course are driven by 

1223
01:18:50,871 --> 01:18:52,400
each party.
Subjective sense.

1224
01:18:52,401 --> 01:18:53,234
They're offended and they're non 
systematic interpretation of events and 

1225
01:18:56,331 --> 01:18:57,164
public justice at its best.
Attempts to use more objective 

1226
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:02,810
evidentiary criteria then private 
justice.

1227
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:04,393
But the PC justice tribunals by 
reintroducing the subjective sense of 

1228
01:19:07,581 --> 01:19:08,414
grievance,
the Professor Peterson is spoken about 

1229
01:19:10,610 --> 01:19:12,770
as a criterion for human rights 
violations.

1230
01:19:13,190 --> 01:19:17,000
Actually I would argue returns us to the
perils of private justice.

1231
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:20,510
But now with public approval and public 
and procure,

1232
01:19:23,260 --> 01:19:25,360
nope.
Why is wisdom necessary?

1233
01:19:25,780 --> 01:19:30,580
Wouldn't it be nice if those kids who 
are shutting everyone down actually went

1234
01:19:30,581 --> 01:19:32,680
to university and said,
I'd like to be wise,

1235
01:19:33,730 --> 01:19:37,380
it would actually help their cause.
Because if you are not wise,

1236
01:19:37,390 --> 01:19:39,670
you really cannot know what is right and
wrong.

1237
01:19:39,910 --> 01:19:43,060
And you may think you'd,
it's an easy thing to tell all the time.

1238
01:19:43,330 --> 01:19:45,980
But there's so many disputes about 
justice through the world.

1239
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:48,940
They clearly people are having trouble 
sorting that out.

1240
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:52,630
And in Plato's Republic,
which is also called on the just,

1241
01:19:53,050 --> 01:19:54,480
he begins it,
um,

1242
01:19:54,490 --> 01:19:57,040
with socrates asking people to define 
justice.

1243
01:19:57,070 --> 01:19:58,240
People are demanding it.
Say,

1244
01:19:58,241 --> 01:19:59,470
okay,
tell me what you want.

1245
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:03,160
And none of them can define it.
They all fall apart.

1246
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:04,053
I can't talk about it here today,
but that's the brilliant beginning of 

1247
01:20:06,491 --> 01:20:07,324
Plato's.
And ultimately he shows us the justice 

1248
01:20:10,021 --> 01:20:13,980
requires balance,
the entire personality and in the city.

1249
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:15,543
Uh,
and it relates to moderation and wisdom 

1250
01:20:16,861 --> 01:20:18,150
and courage.
Now,

1251
01:20:18,210 --> 01:20:19,170
why courage?

1252
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:21,380
Yeah.

1253
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:24,410
Without courage,
you can't stand up for what is just,

1254
01:20:24,411 --> 01:20:26,690
and not everyone agrees on what outcome 
is.

1255
01:20:26,691 --> 01:20:28,010
Just still,
there is a fight.

1256
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:31,610
And entering that fight requires grit 
and it entails risk.

1257
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:33,333
You know,
I asked you to think of all the 

1258
01:20:34,161 --> 01:20:34,994
university administrators of our day who
have caved in across North America and 

1259
01:20:39,351 --> 01:20:40,184
let one lecture after another.
These shut down without a fight 

1260
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:44,693
betraying their mission,
their university mission and their 

1261
01:20:47,331 --> 01:20:51,440
mission to their students.
Sometimes they agree with shutting these

1262
01:20:51,441 --> 01:20:54,530
things down,
but I think more often it's,

1263
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:55,683
um,
a lack of courage a and careerism mixed 

1264
01:20:59,061 --> 01:20:59,894
together.
But physical courage is not enough to 

1265
01:21:02,181 --> 01:21:07,181
guarantee justice because you need 
intellectual courage to have wisdom.

1266
01:21:11,350 --> 01:21:12,183
Wisdom requires the willingness to 
undertake free inquiry and take apart 

1267
01:21:14,801 --> 01:21:17,320
and examine your own soothing fictions 
and beliefs.

1268
01:21:17,710 --> 01:21:18,970
Face,
human morality,

1269
01:21:19,210 --> 01:21:22,060
Morat mortality,
and your limits mill.

1270
01:21:22,061 --> 01:21:22,894
Who drew very much from socrates,
argued the free inquiry was the major 

1271
01:21:26,170 --> 01:21:27,003
basis,
one of the major bases for freedom of 

1272
01:21:28,421 --> 01:21:29,254
speech.
So ultimately the virtues are 

1273
01:21:30,581 --> 01:21:32,680
independent.
Justice depends on courage,

1274
01:21:32,681 --> 01:21:36,580
moderation and wisdom and wisdom depends
on intellectual courage.

1275
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:42,280
For the ancients,
politics is not the only way,

1276
01:21:42,310 --> 01:21:45,520
and at times not even the best way to 
improve the world.

1277
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:50,410
Their cultivation of your own virtue can
have a great impact on others.

1278
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:53,410
What community would not be better off 
with people who cultivate,

1279
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:54,640
cultivate,
wisdom,

1280
01:21:54,641 --> 01:21:56,590
moderation,
courage and justice.

1281
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:04,780
So I'm moving to a summation now.
These are our pc paradoxes.

1282
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:08,680
These are our goals on the left.
And these are methods on the right.

1283
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:12,070
Inclusiveness,
a goal method,

1284
01:22:12,071 --> 01:22:13,690
ostracism,
firing opponents,

1285
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:14,533
Reza demanding resignations,
a goal we'll tolerance and diversity 

1286
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:19,413
method,
intolerance of diversity of opinion as 

1287
01:22:21,581 --> 01:22:22,414
Obama noted,
openness method close to aspects of 

1288
01:22:27,641 --> 01:22:30,280
traditional society and religion and 
many other things,

1289
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:36,310
kindness and compassion.
Yet they demand punishment of opponents,

1290
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:39,790
even for unintentional discrimination,
firing people,

1291
01:22:39,791 --> 01:22:42,370
Internet shaming,
slander and character assassination,

1292
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:43,833
living together.
Unfortunately now on us college 

1293
01:22:46,631 --> 01:22:49,030
campuses,
there are a number of student groups who

1294
01:22:49,031 --> 01:22:51,490
want to segregate themselves by ethnic 
group

1295
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:54,033
being nonjudgmental and non prejudiced.
Yet using the idea of privilege to 

1296
01:22:58,631 --> 01:22:59,464
condemn whole groups as guilty of an 
original sin by their birth whole 

1297
01:23:02,681 --> 01:23:04,300
group's called bigoted,
sexist,

1298
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:07,480
violent and judgmental of themselves by 
the way,

1299
01:23:07,481 --> 01:23:09,670
very judgmental of themselves,
not just others.

1300
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:11,073
Finally,
transparency and yet the endorsement of 

1301
01:23:13,571 --> 01:23:14,800
anonymous complaints.

1302
01:23:16,870 --> 01:23:17,620
Yeah,

1303
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:20,650
history shows the higher,
the more Utopian the goal,

1304
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:24,430
the easier it becomes to justify 
Barbara's ends to get there.

1305
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:28,570
The more unrealistic the goal,
the more likely the failure,

1306
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:32,620
the greater the inpatients and the 
greater the need for scapegoats.

1307
01:23:33,190 --> 01:23:36,220
The greatest evils in human history in 
terms of innocence,

1308
01:23:36,221 --> 01:23:39,640
murdered Mao's cultural revolution,
the Soviet murder of its citizens,

1309
01:23:39,641 --> 01:23:42,820
the Holocaust were all done in the name 
of justice.

1310
01:23:45,740 --> 01:23:46,573
You'll notice I haven't discussed it 
theology because Professor Peterson's 

1311
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:51,800
going to talk about that.
And there are many,

1312
01:23:51,801 --> 01:23:52,634
many deep strands to enrich this 
discussion when looking at the 

1313
01:23:55,461 --> 01:23:57,710
narratives and what people are trying to
do.

1314
01:23:58,070 --> 01:24:00,170
But just in terms of the infallibility 
question,

1315
01:24:00,500 --> 01:24:01,333
etiologies or belief systems based on 
myth disguised as science or philosophy 

1316
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:11,840
that overly simplify our complex world 
around one or two or several ideas.

1317
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,810
And because they fail to account for its
complexity,

1318
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:20,140
they tend to become doctrinaire and um,
posed as infallible and challenged.

1319
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:26,570
There is even an idiot logic in etiology
seeking temperament.

1320
01:24:28,370 --> 01:24:32,570
Eric Hoffer who wrote the true believer 
described a very interesting phenomenon,

1321
01:24:32,571 --> 01:24:33,404
which is during Hitler's rise to power,
when there were Nazis and communists on 

1322
01:24:37,131 --> 01:24:37,964
the street and after the end of the 
Second World War where there were still 

1323
01:24:41,811 --> 01:24:45,920
Nazis about and communists in eastern 
Europe,

1324
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:47,353
people would often switch from being a 
communist to a Nazi or a Nazi to a 

1325
01:24:50,781 --> 01:24:51,614
communist,
even though super officially these were 

1326
01:24:54,171 --> 01:24:55,910
very,
very different ideologies that

1327
01:24:57,470 --> 01:24:58,303
hated each other.
And one of the things that hoffer was 

1328
01:25:00,531 --> 01:25:01,364
able to point out when he analyze these 
people as they were fanatics and 

1329
01:25:05,271 --> 01:25:08,240
fanatics were people who had a sense of 
self,

1330
01:25:08,510 --> 01:25:10,250
which they completely detest it.

1331
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:11,940
Yeah.

1332
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:12,773
So to say they had low self esteem 
doesn't quite capture how hostile and 

1333
01:25:18,121 --> 01:25:18,954
angry they were to themselves.
And what the etiology did to them is it 

1334
01:25:23,011 --> 01:25:27,030
didn't grow theirself.
They didn't want to grow that six self.

1335
01:25:27,090 --> 01:25:30,720
It obliterated theirself.
They wanted obliteration.

1336
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:36,500
And there are other people that I've 
seen over the years who show signs,

1337
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:37,464
not have it a terrible negative self.
So much as not having a strong sense of 

1338
01:25:41,311 --> 01:25:45,540
self at all.
And they can turn to ideology,

1339
01:25:45,780 --> 01:25:49,500
which gives them the structure they feel
they don't have internally.

1340
01:25:49,710 --> 01:25:51,900
And if they're not mentalizing it's a 
very appealing.

1341
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:54,250
Okay.

1342
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:55,083
So some final words on fourth speech 
that triggered us getting together and 

1343
01:26:02,021 --> 01:26:04,520
talking to you today.
Um,

1344
01:26:06,050 --> 01:26:11,050
Professor Peterson pointed out that 
there's a tangle of laws in Canada which

1345
01:26:11,811 --> 01:26:14,180
if taken together can be red

1346
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:17,473
as allowing the government to an if in 
effect forced people to say things they 

1347
01:26:22,221 --> 01:26:25,400
don't believe.
And some people like to say,

1348
01:26:25,401 --> 01:26:26,234
oh,
that couldn't be possible or it didn't 

1349
01:26:27,021 --> 01:26:27,854
happen.
And Professor Peterson got two letters 

1350
01:26:30,381 --> 01:26:31,400
from uft.
Well,

1351
01:26:31,401 --> 01:26:32,234
lawyers letters basically saying,
you've got to change your position on 

1352
01:26:35,361 --> 01:26:37,460
for speech.
In other words,

1353
01:26:37,461 --> 01:26:41,540
they read it the way he did and he 
debated a professor of law who basically

1354
01:26:41,541 --> 01:26:42,051
said,
yes,

1355
01:26:42,051 --> 01:26:42,884
I,
it's possible that you could be called 

1356
01:26:45,351 --> 01:26:50,000
before the tribunal if you don't go 
along with saying words,

1357
01:26:50,510 --> 01:26:52,850
um,
that we think are now mandated.

1358
01:26:53,390 --> 01:26:56,630
And they headed the Ontario Human Rights
Commission when asked,

1359
01:26:56,810 --> 01:26:58,580
well,
is he in violation?

1360
01:26:58,581 --> 01:27:00,140
She repeated the law.
She didn't say,

1361
01:27:00,230 --> 01:27:02,570
oh no,
that couldn't happen here in Ontario.

1362
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:06,170
And then the lawyers he consulted in 
other sense.

1363
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:10,340
So there's free speech and there is 
forced speech.

1364
01:27:12,870 --> 01:27:17,870
This is our charter section to be grants
everyone freedom of thought,

1365
01:27:19,050 --> 01:27:20,790
belief,
opinion and expression.

1366
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:25,920
Notice expression comes last.
The first part is false belief.

1367
01:27:25,921 --> 01:27:26,754
Opinion,
expression including freedom of the 

1368
01:27:29,431 --> 01:27:30,264
press and other media of communication.
The rights are together because they're 

1369
01:27:36,791 --> 01:27:37,624
connected.
Free expression is a necessity and 

1370
01:27:39,401 --> 01:27:40,234
necessary condition for the free 
formation of thought and belief in 

1371
01:27:43,631 --> 01:27:44,464
anyone who wants to argue that 
compelling a person to say things they 

1372
01:27:49,421 --> 01:27:54,421
don't believe in is not a violation of
their freedom of thought.

1373
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:57,933
Belief and opinion
seems to me very much stretching the 

1374
01:28:01,721 --> 01:28:02,554
charter.

1375
01:28:06,370 --> 01:28:07,203
Okay.

1376
01:28:07,430 --> 01:28:11,570
It's a case of government and the 
proponents of forced speech,

1377
01:28:11,571 --> 01:28:12,404
not trusting sufficiently in the 
goodness of most Canadians and the fact 

1378
01:28:15,411 --> 01:28:19,100
that they have diverse opinions and that
we can benefit as per president.

1379
01:28:19,101 --> 01:28:20,990
Obama said,
when opinions collide,

1380
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:23,570
it is a lapse into the infallible state 
of mind.

1381
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:30,550
But isn't it just a matter of etiquette,
isn't it good manners?

1382
01:28:31,460 --> 01:28:32,293
Well,
it might be if government didn't bring 

1383
01:28:35,331 --> 01:28:36,164
force into it,
when's the last time you were forced to 

1384
01:28:40,191 --> 01:28:41,024
have good manners?
Government could command many things by 

1385
01:28:44,391 --> 01:28:47,990
force,
but they cannot command respect even for

1386
01:28:47,991 --> 01:28:51,500
others with force and respect is,
I suggest,

1387
01:28:51,950 --> 01:28:52,783
and I suspect precisely what the people 
involved in this controversy really 

1388
01:28:56,751 --> 01:28:57,584
yearn for.
So I think it's actually quite amazing 

1389
01:29:00,411 --> 01:29:05,411
that those who drafted this legislation 
have not summoned the creativity to find

1390
01:29:06,481 --> 01:29:10,590
a solution to this problem that does not
travel on other rights.

1391
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:16,820
But if you don't believe or don't agree 
with anything I've said so far,

1392
01:29:16,821 --> 01:29:17,654
then I would say this.
Always think of the next government 

1393
01:29:21,590 --> 01:29:24,860
breaking the taboo in forcing,
endorsing for speech,

1394
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:29,540
creating a taste or tolerance for it.
Habituating people to it as a legitimate

1395
01:29:29,541 --> 01:29:33,710
tool of power is handing your opponents 
a new tool,

1396
01:29:34,190 --> 01:29:35,023
a shiny new tool and governments change 
and you will have taught your opponents 

1397
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:42,740
that one can use force and get away with
it.

1398
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:46,490
And especially if you're represented 
minority or marginal group,

1399
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:48,583
and I bet you that many of us,
depending on how you dissect things out 

1400
01:29:51,591 --> 01:29:54,290
can be seen as part of a minority or 
marginal group.

1401
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:58,790
It is far better to persuade people than
force them.

1402
01:29:58,820 --> 01:29:59,653
If you force the changes,
they'll only stay in place as long as 

1403
01:30:02,901 --> 01:30:04,610
you are.
Your side holds government.

1404
01:30:04,730 --> 01:30:07,340
But if you persuade people,
they will be on your side.

1405
01:30:07,370 --> 01:30:12,370
Even when government changes,
forced speech is a robotic solution to a

1406
01:30:13,761 --> 01:30:17,900
problem that is best solved with two way
empathy and understanding.

1407
01:30:20,830 --> 01:30:23,530
And in the historical,
clinical and scientific literature,

1408
01:30:23,531 --> 01:30:28,531
I've read that studies people being 
forced to say things in families,

1409
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:29,913
in concentration camps,
in unusual political situations in that 

1410
01:30:34,451 --> 01:30:36,670
literature,
which studies people who are not trusted

1411
01:30:36,671 --> 01:30:39,730
to be good enough to find their own way 
and say what they think.

1412
01:30:40,210 --> 01:30:44,560
We see these people led into a kind of 
hopeless apathy and despair.

1413
01:30:45,220 --> 01:30:46,053
It leads to a kind of abdication of 
authenticity and even their moral 

1414
01:30:49,751 --> 01:30:50,584
development.
So I said the political correctness 

1415
01:30:55,151 --> 01:30:55,984
today
is indeed mutually exclusive with 

1416
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:00,873
freedom of speech.
There's a tragic irony that the PC 

1417
01:31:03,131 --> 01:31:06,370
attack on free speech is that,
um,

1418
01:31:06,550 --> 01:31:11,170
the tragic irony of the attack on free 
speech is that free speech is one of the

1419
01:31:11,171 --> 01:31:15,070
most durable protections minorities and 
marginalized groups have ever had.

1420
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:16,953
And the shutdown and invalidation 
techniques undermine the very ideals 

1421
01:31:20,531 --> 01:31:21,364
they purport to defend and are based on 
the proponents claiming and infallible 

1422
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:26,830
state of mind about what is 
compassionate,

1423
01:31:27,130 --> 01:31:27,911
good,
safe,

1424
01:31:27,911 --> 01:31:28,744
and effective

1425
01:31:31,540 --> 01:31:33,640
in this kind of solution.
Nobody wins.

1426
01:31:35,110 --> 01:31:37,240
Political,
moral and scientific progress,

1427
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:38,493
as well as our individual health require
a community that has a place for verbal 

1428
01:31:41,981 --> 01:31:42,814
argument that's not violence.
It's the sublimation of our differences 

1429
01:31:46,210 --> 01:31:49,060
into a verbal form,
far less vicious than true violence.

1430
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:50,553
So the very individuality that pc 
proponents treasure derives from 

1431
01:31:53,741 --> 01:31:54,574
liberty,
which itself must be protected from two 

1432
01:31:57,170 --> 01:32:01,420
equally powerful human tendencies that 
of authoritarianism and human,

1433
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:02,633
no,
it all of Islam.

1434
01:32:02,980 --> 01:32:03,813
And I conclude my last slide with mills 
wisdom and his principles that mankind 

1435
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:12,370
are not infallible.
That their truth,

1436
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:15,040
for the most part,
are only half truths.

1437
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:16,593
That unity of opinion,
unless resulting from the fullest and 

1438
01:32:19,721 --> 01:32:23,860
freest comparison of opposite opinions 
is not desirable.

1439
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:24,873
And diversity is not an evil,
but a good until mankind are much more 

1440
01:32:29,501 --> 01:32:33,490
capable than at present of recognizing 
all sides of the truth,

1441
01:32:33,910 --> 01:32:36,730
our principals applicable to men's modes
of action,

1442
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:39,100
not less than their opinions.

1443
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:46,100
[inaudible].
