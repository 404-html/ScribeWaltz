1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:03,010
On Tuesday,
obviously I wasn't here.

2
00:00:03,011 --> 00:00:06,660
And so I prepared that combination
slideshow,

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,060
powerpoint thing that took me like 12
hours to make it.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,810
But I'm wondering something,
I mean I have quite a bit of tape

5
00:00:13,811 --> 00:00:17,820
material and I'm going to,
obviously I'd be taking this courses and

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,760
I was wondering,
one of the advantages of doing it that

7
00:00:21,761 --> 00:00:26,761
way was that I could sink the material,
like the slide material with the lecture

8
00:00:26,981 --> 00:00:28,350
much more precisely.
You know,

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,120
when you can imagine that if I,
once I got good at that,

10
00:00:31,121 --> 00:00:34,180
I could put a lot more material into the
lectures and I could edit them very

11
00:00:34,181 --> 00:00:37,030
carefully.
So then I'm wondering like what did you

12
00:00:37,031 --> 00:00:42,031
think of that use of technology compared
to a spontaneous lecture?

13
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,900
What was your attitude towards that?

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,530
I think that,
well we could present more,

15
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:57,900
less responsive and so I prefer the 11
pictures watching the tapes.

16
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,143
Yeah,

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,560
yeah,
yeah.

18
00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:02,921
No,
no,

19
00:01:02,921 --> 00:01:04,840
I understand.
I mean there is some mute.

20
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,970
The thing about lecture is that it's a
conversation.

21
00:01:06,971 --> 00:01:10,690
If it's a good lecture right there
because the lecturers hypothetically

22
00:01:10,691 --> 00:01:13,620
paying attention to the audience.
And so then it's,

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,220
it's,
it's more dynamic.

24
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,920
But you know what if suffers a bit cause
it's not as structured.

25
00:01:17,921 --> 00:01:19,630
That's the thing.
Anybody else?

26
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:20,980
Just we did it.
Yup.

27
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,290
Pretty good substitute.
Like I'll be a say prefer an in person

28
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:26,240
lecture.
But given the circumstance I thought it

29
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:29,050
was definitely a good substitute,
the information.

30
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,060
So I was wondering like what would
happen,

31
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:37,061
do you think if I prepared like a really
tightly edited half hour presentation

32
00:01:37,701 --> 00:01:40,120
like that and then followed it up with a
looser lecture,

33
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,500
do you think that,
would that be a reasonable combination

34
00:01:42,501 --> 00:01:44,990
of the two things?
Because that way I could more,

35
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,810
you know,
I can be much more certain that I

36
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:50,650
covered a wide range of material,
you know,

37
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:55,640
in depth and then hopefully the lecture
could be maybe a little looser and a bit

38
00:01:55,641 --> 00:01:56,790
more fun.
So what do you,

39
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,810
do you think that would be a reasonable
thing to try?

40
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,680
So any,
anybody up?

41
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,380
Yup.

42
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,061
Um,
yeah,

43
00:02:02,061 --> 00:02:05,390
you've got to be a really good idea,
especially because during the lecture

44
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,780
section,
the chance to sort of ask some more

45
00:02:08,781 --> 00:02:10,730
questions,
whereas,

46
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,840
uh,
you know correctly,

47
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:13,910
there's a lot of time.

48
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,051
Yeah.
Yeah.

49
00:02:18,051 --> 00:02:19,010
Well,
yeah,

50
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,310
I was thinking that maybe that would
allow me to increase the degree to which

51
00:02:22,311 --> 00:02:24,260
it was interactive,
so.

52
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,530
Okay.
Did anybody particularly object to that

53
00:02:27,531 --> 00:02:28,790
mode of presentation?
I mean,

54
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,800
I know you wouldn't have to be in the
lecture hall for it,

55
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:31,940
obviously.
That's one thing,

56
00:02:31,941 --> 00:02:32,630
right?
You could look,

57
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,900
you could watch it at home.
I think there's some danger in just

58
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:38,840
having the lecture material online.
So you're at home because,

59
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,110
well,
the Internet is full of things you can

60
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:42,950
watch,
you know,

61
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,980
so there's gotta be some utility
bringing people together by anybody else

62
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:49,130
have any other comments?

63
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,083
Okay.
Okay.

64
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,480
All right.
So today we're going to talk about

65
00:02:58,481 --> 00:03:02,320
conscientiousness and I'm going to stick
closer to my notes in some parts because

66
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:06,490
a lot of this stuff I'm going to tell
you about is really only stuff that I've

67
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:09,240
learned in the last year or so.
And so I've known,

68
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,070
I've known,
absolutely familiar with it yet.

69
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,780
Uh,
there's actually been a fair bit of

70
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:16,210
progress,
made an understanding conscientiousness

71
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,270
and in very surprising ways.
Some of the stuff that I'm going to talk

72
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:21,790
to you about today really shocked me
when I learned it.

73
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,470
Um,
you'll see,

74
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:25,330
I mean,
I've been in interested in belief

75
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:29,110
systems and new technology for a long
time and um,

76
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,650
the role that I'd never really
understood the role that

77
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:35,740
conscientiousness plays in that.
So,

78
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,650
so particularly,
but it's really starting to come

79
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:41,530
together.
So not only we're going to talk about

80
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:44,080
conscientiousness today,
we're going to talk about,

81
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:48,430
I think some of the pathologies that are
associated with conscientiousness,

82
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,340
both at the individual level and at the
social level.

83
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,990
Now it's a,
it's a tricky topic because act what

84
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,700
we've discussed this before to some
degree,

85
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:59,710
you know,
that intelligence and conscientiousness

86
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:01,660
are the best predictors of life success,
right?

87
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:04,490
At least in managerial administrative,
um,

88
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,500
professions and in academia and also in
professions like the law,

89
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,770
you know.
Um,

90
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,180
so conscientiousness in many ways seems
to be a very good trait.

91
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:16,750
I don't think that you can have a
civilized society without

92
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,510
Wifi,
without it,

93
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,500
without conscientiousness being at the
base of it in some sense because

94
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:25,810
conscientious people do what they say
they're going to do.

95
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,990
They're industrious,
they keep things in order.

96
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,160
Um,
a lot of that's the basis for the kind

97
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:37,270
of interpersonal trust that's necessary
to set up complex trading systems.

98
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:40,270
And so,
and as an individual trait,

99
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:41,680
as I said,
if you're conscientious,

100
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,770
not only do you do better in life,
but by the time you're middle aged or

101
00:04:44,771 --> 00:04:46,110
so,
um,

102
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,980
your life quality seems to be much
higher.

103
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,620
So you know,
we'll be in conscientious seems to be a

104
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:53,080
good longterm,
medium to long term strategy.

105
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,740
So that all sounds pretty positive.
But then one of the things that multiple

106
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,910
multitude of labs have been looking at
over the last few years,

107
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:07,600
including mine,
is what happens if conscientiousness is

108
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:12,601
taken too far and it kind of looks,
this is work that hasn't been published

109
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:17,260
yet,
but it's based on some of the new

110
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:19,990
personality models that I'd been looking
at that are,

111
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,870
that have been derived using a different
technique,

112
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:25,630
a semantic analysis technique instead of
factor analysis.

113
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:30,610
And what appears to be the case is that
any of the traits become pathological if

114
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:33,340
you push them too far.
So,

115
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,120
so whatever virtue is,
it can't be identified with a particular

116
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:38,380
trait.
I mean,

117
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,130
I don't know what virtue would be from a
big five perspective,

118
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:44,500
but it doesn't look like you could
localize it specifically.

119
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,490
Maybe it's something like the
appropriate situational balance of the

120
00:05:48,491 --> 00:05:51,700
temperaments or one of the things I've
been thinking is that maybe as you

121
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:53,650
mature,
your,

122
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,410
your,
your width of temperament increases,

123
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,000
you know,
that maybe your,

124
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:02,720
your baseline for a conscientiousness is
sort of average.

125
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:06,830
But as you mature,
your ability to be very conscientious

126
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:10,640
when it's necessary and your ability to
not be conscientious when it's necessary

127
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,060
are more thoroughly developed,
a differentiated so that you can match

128
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:17,990
your behavior more particular to the
demands of given situations.

129
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,390
Maybe that's something like the
development of wisdom.

130
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,850
But anyways,
it turns out,

131
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,360
it turns out that it appears that
conscientiousness can take a very

132
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:29,180
vicious turn if it's pushed beyond a
certain point.

133
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,400
And it also appears that perhaps the
point at which conscientiousness is

134
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:39,290
really positively associated with the
success of individuals and maybe the

135
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:43,400
success of nations is also relatively
close to the point where if you push it

136
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:45,650
any farther,
it starts to kick back very badly and

137
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,000
things go downhill.

138
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,090
And so that's the sort of thing that
we're going to discuss today.

139
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,880
So,
um,

140
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,730
well put it in its context first.
You remember the highest order

141
00:06:55,731 --> 00:06:59,390
personality traits or plasticity and
stability in plasticity is made up of

142
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:02,280
extraversion and openness.
Those are good predictors of longterm

143
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,050
creative achievement.
And then there's stability and stability

144
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:09,390
is associated with conscientiousness,
emotional stability and agreeableness.

145
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,720
And we're going to concentrate on
conscientiousness today,

146
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,450
which is obviously that's industrious in
orderliness at the big five aspects

147
00:07:16,451 --> 00:07:17,480
scale level.
Now,

148
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:21,750
um,
when we derived the big five aspect

149
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:24,170
scale sold,
broke the big five down to 10,

150
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,800
it wasn't clear to begin with what the
aspects we're going to be useful for.

151
00:07:27,801 --> 00:07:30,350
Because when you do statistical analysis
like that,

152
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,620
you're just pulling out a semantic
structure and there isn't really any

153
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:37,820
necessity that those additional
differentiation so that you make are

154
00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:39,290
going to have practical utility.

155
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,560
But it's turned out that the distinction
between Oh,

156
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:45,440
orderliness and industriousness is
extremely useful.

157
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,600
So one of the things we know for
example,

158
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:50,120
is that orderly people tend to be more
conservative.

159
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:53,030
So we know that conservative people tend
to be more conscientious,

160
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,740
but it seems to load specifically an
orderliness.

161
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,870
Now you might say,
well,

162
00:07:56,871 --> 00:08:00,380
that's not so surprising to associate
the right wing with orderliness.

163
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,040
But it is surprising because we didn't
know that orderliness was a subset of

164
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:06,920
conscientiousness.
And so people have been trying since the

165
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:11,600
end of World War II to slop the idea of
the authoritarian personality into

166
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,810
standard personality models.
And that's been extremely difficult to

167
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:15,710
do.
You know?

168
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:17,990
And so,
so one hypothesis is being that

169
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:21,330
conservative people because they're more
zen,

170
00:08:21,331 --> 00:08:22,700
a phobic,
and they're more,

171
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,610
you know,
they're more anti-immigration and there

172
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,470
and they're more anti gay rights and
that sort of thing.

173
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,600
And one,
one primary theories being that that's

174
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:31,510
because they're more afraid,
you know,

175
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,080
there.
But the problem is,

176
00:08:33,081 --> 00:08:37,130
is that conservatism isn't associated
with neuroticism to any degree at all.

177
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:39,050
And when it is,
it seems to be reverse.

178
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:43,580
It seems that the conservatives are less
plagued by neuroticism than liberals are

179
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:46,100
say so.
You mean you could make the hypothesis

180
00:08:46,101 --> 00:08:49,670
that the conservatives are so
conservative that they're covering up

181
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:52,430
their fear to such a degree that it
actually reverse it.

182
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:56,040
But you know,
really you gotta you gotta be Pretty

183
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,300
Damn convinced of your theory to hold on
to it when the data seemed to indicate

184
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:02,670
that the opposite,
the actual opposite is true.

185
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,760
And so,
oh well here,

186
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,920
here's some items you guys can take a
look at this.

187
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:11,280
So this is how you would distinguish
orderliness from industriousness.

188
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,520
Um,
I wouldn't worry about the slides.

189
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:14,880
Okay.

190
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,800
Because I'm going to,
I'm going to cut them in.

191
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,960
Okay.
So anyways,

192
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:23,100
so if you're ordering,
you don't leave your belongings around.

193
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,100
Obviously you like order.
While there's a surprise,

194
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,230
you keep things tidy,
you follow a schedule,

195
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:30,370
so you order your time.
Um,

196
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,820
that's definitely a good predictor of
productivity.

197
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,840
You're bothered by this and people and
bothered is an interesting word,

198
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:38,460
right?
Cause if you're orderly and you're

199
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:41,670
somewhere messy and it bothers you,
you might think,

200
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,690
well exactly what it is that you're
experiencing when you're bothered.

201
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:48,930
You know,
I know if I go to a place that's in real

202
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:51,750
disarray,
it looks like people have been failing

203
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:53,880
to live up to their responsibility.
Say it,

204
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,160
it's a visceral sensation.
I really don't like it.

205
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:58,380
I'm very strongly compelled to put
things in order,

206
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,191
you know,
and it,

207
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:00,300
it,
but,

208
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,510
but it's obviously a negative emotion,
but it's not the kind of negative

209
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:05,400
emotion that seems to load on
neuroticism.

210
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,270
So it doesn't seem to be fear or anxiety
or emotional pain or frustration or

211
00:10:09,271 --> 00:10:11,970
disappointment or any of those things.
So then you might ask,

212
00:10:11,971 --> 00:10:12,630
well,
you know,

213
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:17,100
what's left bothered,
wants everything to be just right.

214
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,650
Um,
dislikes,

215
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:20,760
routine,
opposite,

216
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,500
obviously orderly.
People like routine.

217
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,770
They see that rules are observed and
they want every detail taken care of.

218
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:28,020
While you can see that,
in some ways,

219
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,470
orderliness is the soul of bureaucracy,
right?

220
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,070
Because everything in its place and a
place for everything is basically the

221
00:10:35,071 --> 00:10:39,570
sort of hallmark of an orderly person.
Well in my clinical practice,

222
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:43,740
I've certainly observed that people who
are really disorderly and really high in

223
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:44,820
neuroticism,
they just,

224
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,130
they're just never improve.
You know,

225
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,640
they're because they're their fear and
their anxiety sort of paralyze them into

226
00:10:53,591 --> 00:10:55,320
an immobility.
And the fact that they're low in

227
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,830
conscientiousness are low in orderliness
means they will never do anything and

228
00:10:58,831 --> 00:11:02,250
then disorder grows round and then that
exacerbates their anxiety and their

229
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,710
theorists like it's a real catastrophe.

230
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,170
So,
and then on theirs,

231
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,300
so that's where the conservatives are
different.

232
00:11:09,301 --> 00:11:12,120
They're more orderly that liberals are
industriousness.

233
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:14,370
Liberals and conservatives seem to be
about the same.

234
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,770
So industrious person carries out their
plans.

235
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:19,260
They don't waste time,
they don't find it difficult to get down

236
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,240
to work.
They don't miss things up.

237
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:25,200
They finish what they start,
they put their mind on the task at hand

238
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:28,080
to get things done quickly.
So this is an efficiency element to it.

239
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,480
Uh,
they don't postpone decisions and they

240
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:34,320
aren't easily distracted.
And so industrious people tend not to

241
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:36,930
procrastinate.
And procrastination actually seems to be

242
00:11:36,931 --> 00:11:39,600
something like low industriousness and
high neuroticism.

243
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,380
So I know it's a very pernicious
phenomenon.

244
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,210
And procrastination can really drive
people.

245
00:11:45,211 --> 00:11:50,211
Start branding now
it's reversed.

246
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:53,140
Yeah.
Yeah.

247
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,140
So the ones that don't make sense or
every post,

248
00:11:55,141 --> 00:11:58,690
so,
so now it isn't exactly obvious why

249
00:11:58,691 --> 00:12:02,520
orderliness and industriousness are
related so tightly or why there's

250
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:05,710
somewhat differentiable,
but it turns out that that is the case

251
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:06,843
statistically.

252
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:12,930
Now I thought a lot about why
orderliness and industriousness really

253
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:17,680
is a mystery.
We started to associate ordering with

254
00:12:17,681 --> 00:12:20,680
sensitivity to discussed,
and I'm going to elaborate on that quite

255
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:22,330
a bit.
Industriousness,

256
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,220
we haven't been able to get a handle on
at all.

257
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,050
And I,
I,

258
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:29,950
and so conscientiousness is somewhat of
a mystery because up until maybe a year

259
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:32,620
ago or two years ago,
even though it was a really good

260
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:35,440
predictor of longterm life success and
happiness,

261
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,290
um,
we didn't have any models for it because

262
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,450
it just came out of this statistical
analysis of,

263
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:42,700
of the semantic structure language.
Right?

264
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:45,430
So it was atheoretical.
So there's no theoretical model.

265
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,950
What,
why are people conscientious?

266
00:12:47,951 --> 00:12:49,690
Well,
we have no idea.

267
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,110
There's no neuropsychological model.
We have no idea what part of the brain

268
00:12:53,111 --> 00:12:55,930
is,
is associated with conscientiousness.

269
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,290
And weirdly enough,
the sorts of things that are associated

270
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:04,030
with conscientiousness are very close to
what theorists have identified as the

271
00:13:04,031 --> 00:13:06,640
function of the dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex say,

272
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:10,360
which is the part of the brain that's
the deals with the highest order of

273
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:13,180
abstractions and the whole prefrontal
cortex.

274
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,960
People have associated with the ability
to plan and the ability to inhibit

275
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:19,630
impulses and the ability to think in the
longterm.

276
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,880
And that all sounds like
conscientiousness,

277
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,120
but if you assess people's dorsal
lateral prefrontal function with tests,

278
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,280
cognitive tests that she,
that are characterized by activation,

279
00:13:33,281 --> 00:13:36,520
when when people are doing those tests,
their prefrontal Cortex is activated in

280
00:13:36,521 --> 00:13:40,000
say functional Mri.
The correlation between the prefrontal

281
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:44,260
ability assessed cognitively and
conscientiousness itself is zero.

282
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:48,070
So it's really weird because this also
means to me that most theories of

283
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:52,180
prefrontal function or wrong,
so you can think about it this way,

284
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:55,540
is that in order to,
the prefrontal cortex does seem to be

285
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:59,800
good at manipulating abstractions.
But by definition an abstraction is

286
00:13:59,801 --> 00:14:01,870
something that's obstructed from the
real world,

287
00:14:01,871 --> 00:14:03,580
right?
It's no longer connected to the real

288
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:05,770
world.
And so when you're thinking about your

289
00:14:05,771 --> 00:14:09,250
future,
say you've pulled abstract

290
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:12,280
representations of the world up into
this space where you're,

291
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,520
where you're doing your thinking and
it's a disembodied space,

292
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,560
obviously you're not acting it out.

293
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:22,210
And so you have to be able to dissociate
the abstractions from the real world in

294
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:25,780
order to manipulate the abstractions,
which is thinking without acting them

295
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,420
out.
But the thing about conscientious people

296
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,320
isn't that they make plants so much,
it's that if they make a plan,

297
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,680
then they do it.
And so that means that there's this

298
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,750
ability to take the abstraction,
you know,

299
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:40,150
while I promise to do x,
okay,

300
00:14:40,151 --> 00:14:42,400
well that means you've been able to
think up acts.

301
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,340
But the next question is,
if you promise to do it,

302
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,160
will you do it?
And the answer to that could easily be

303
00:14:48,161 --> 00:14:51,070
no and that it is the answer generally
if you're not conscientious.

304
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,710
But that doesn't seem to be associated
with prefrontal function at all.

305
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,010
And you see these weird dissociations in
a lot of clinical cases.

306
00:14:58,011 --> 00:15:00,940
So borderline people with borderline
personality disorder,

307
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,400
a good example because they're very
unconscientious and very high in

308
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:05,234
neuroticism.

309
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,170
And they're often very smart.
And so there are these people,

310
00:15:09,171 --> 00:15:10,340
you talk to them,
you know,

311
00:15:10,341 --> 00:15:12,410
and,
and they're perfectly capable of

312
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,800
identifying what their problems are and
even telling you what the causal

313
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:18,920
pathways and even telling you about what
they should do in the future.

314
00:15:18,921 --> 00:15:23,330
But they absolutely will not do it.
So the ability to think and the,

315
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,540
and the willingness to put those
thoughts into operations seem to be set

316
00:15:26,541 --> 00:15:29,020
completely separable phenomenon.
And,

317
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,020
and we don't know much about the system
that motivates people to put their plans

318
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:36,320
into action or to keep a promise or to
not procrastinate.

319
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,210
We don't know what that's associated
with.

320
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,420
So there's no psychological model.
There's no pharmacological model.

321
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,630
We don't know how to increase
conscientiousness.

322
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,680
You know,
you might think that when you give kids

323
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,350
with attention deficit disorder,
um,

324
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,700
Ritalin,
for example,

325
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,260
that that might make them more
conscientious,

326
00:15:54,261 --> 00:15:54,831
but,
well,

327
00:15:54,831 --> 00:15:57,860
first there's no evidence for that
because Ritalin is an amphetamine and

328
00:15:57,861 --> 00:16:00,290
that would make them more extroverted,
generally speaking,

329
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,970
because it's a dopaminergic agent.

330
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:06,950
And plus there's no evidence whatsoever
that if you follow up people who have

331
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:09,350
adhd who were on Ritalin in the long
run,

332
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:11,210
that the Ritalin does them any good
whatsoever.

333
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,460
In fact,
there's the evidence is actually the

334
00:16:13,461 --> 00:16:17,690
reverse is that the longterm
consequences of Ritalin user negative

335
00:16:17,691 --> 00:16:21,710
rather than positive.
So now it's worse in our lab,

336
00:16:21,711 --> 00:16:24,320
like we've done all sorts of things to
try to measure conscientiousness.

337
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:27,410
So one of the things we did for example,
because we thought of it as kind of

338
00:16:27,411 --> 00:16:28,430
persistence,
you know,

339
00:16:28,431 --> 00:16:33,410
maybe like conscientious people will
persist at boring tasks longer than non

340
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:35,360
conscientious people.
Sounds reasonable.

341
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,660
Right?
Because you know it,

342
00:16:36,661 --> 00:16:40,850
it sounds like you're kind of grabbing
yourself at saying focus on this and

343
00:16:40,851 --> 00:16:43,100
don't be distracted.
It has nothing to do with whether you're

344
00:16:43,101 --> 00:16:45,980
interested in it.
So we had people do things like we made

345
00:16:45,981 --> 00:16:50,981
lines and lines of ends and amps and use
and we had people count the use,

346
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,610
which is pretty boring,
you know.

347
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:56,090
And it's also difficult because ends and
ams and use look a lot the same.

348
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:00,020
And all that we found was that
intelligence predicted it smarter people

349
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:02,000
could do it more accurately and faster,
right?

350
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:04,610
No correlation whatsoever with
conscientiousness.

351
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:07,640
We couldn't get a correlation with any
prefrontal tests,

352
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,910
no Iq tests.
And then we test use tests that were

353
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,610
associated with the orbital frontal
Cortex,

354
00:17:13,611 --> 00:17:16,400
which is sort of lower and a little bit
more hooked into the limbic system.

355
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,360
And we couldn't find any correlation
between conscientiousness and

356
00:17:20,361 --> 00:17:23,240
performance on those tests either.
We looked at like 200 different

357
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:28,460
performance measures and conscientious
did conscientiousness didn't predict any

358
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:30,560
of them.
We can't get people who are

359
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:34,220
conscientious to do something better in
the lab and people who aren't

360
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:35,300
conscientious.
And it's,

361
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,550
it's a real puzzle because,
you know,

362
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:41,000
because it's such an important predictor
of things like longterm life success and

363
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:44,060
performance and political,
the political affiliation,

364
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,240
you'd think that you'd be able to
discriminate between people who are

365
00:17:47,241 --> 00:17:49,920
conscientious and people who aren't
conscientious the lab.

366
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,330
Um,
but I know that,

367
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:58,430
that the chair of our department has
recently used some attentional tasks to

368
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:02,470
and showed a differentiation between
conscientious people and hit

369
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,280
unconscientious people.
And so I'm hoping that I'm going to

370
00:18:05,281 --> 00:18:08,370
follow up with her to find out exactly
what that is.

371
00:18:08,371 --> 00:18:09,780
But I mean it's been deadly different.

372
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:10,940
Cool.
So,

373
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:18,740
so you know,
Robert's the references for all this or

374
00:18:18,741 --> 00:18:20,490
at the end of the slides by the way,
so I'm,

375
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,970
I'm not going to go through the complete
references,

376
00:18:22,971 --> 00:18:27,590
but research a researcher named Roberts
has defined conscientiousness is the

377
00:18:27,591 --> 00:18:30,830
tendency to be planful organized task
and goal oriented,

378
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:34,790
self control and to delay gratification
and to follow the norms and rules.

379
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,180
So we looked at things too,
like future discounting,

380
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,940
you know,
so future discounting would be,

381
00:18:40,941 --> 00:18:44,270
can play a future discounting game.
So I'll do that with you very quickly.

382
00:18:44,271 --> 00:18:46,730
So I'm going to point at you and ask you
a question so you can,

383
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,970
it's not a trick by the way,
so you don't have to worry about your

384
00:18:49,971 --> 00:18:51,140
answers.
So I might say,

385
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,340
okay,
here's the deal.

386
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:56,540
I can give you $10 today or I can give
you $15 in a month.

387
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,750
What would you take?
Okay,

388
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,261
good.
Okay,

389
00:19:00,261 --> 00:19:04,640
so fine.
I give you $50 today or $50 in a year.

390
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,830
15 today,
15 today.

391
00:19:06,831 --> 00:19:10,520
Okay,
I'll give you $5 today or $50 a year.

392
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:14,810
Okay,
so now imagine that I played that game

393
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,890
with one of you a hundred times,
say or 200 times using different

394
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:21,200
amounts,
small and big over different timeframes.

395
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:26,120
And what you can calculate is how much
people value the present compared to the

396
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:29,000
future.
Now you should value the present a bit

397
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,470
more than the future,
right?

398
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,633
Why?

399
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,370
That's right.
The future is uncertain,

400
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,140
so,
so you have to discount it.

401
00:19:37,141 --> 00:19:40,320
So because you know,
there's some probability that it isn't

402
00:19:40,321 --> 00:19:42,960
just going to occur,
like maybe something will happen or

403
00:19:42,961 --> 00:19:44,640
maybe I'll,
I won't be here.

404
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,250
And then the farther out you go into the
future,

405
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:50,790
the more you have to discount it because
it becomes really unpredictable.

406
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,800
And you know,
my experience,

407
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,530
and I don't really know of any data to
support this,

408
00:19:55,531 --> 00:19:59,370
but my experience has been that it's,
it's pretty hard to plan in your life.

409
00:19:59,371 --> 00:20:03,150
It's pretty hard to plan more than three
to five years into the future because,

410
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:08,040
because there's so many variables that
start to the effect of the variables

411
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,530
that you're not accounting for.
Start to,

412
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,770
it starts to become exponential as you
move out into the future.

413
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:19,310
So you should discount the future
because the present is more certain.

414
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,890
Plus if you have $5 now,
you can do something with it right now

415
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,970
instead of waiting for two years to get
your 50 and so that might be useful.

416
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,470
But we thought that maybe conscientious
people would discount the future less

417
00:20:31,471 --> 00:20:33,120
than unconscientious people.
Right.

418
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,300
It sounds like they would because it's
sort of like delay of gratification.

419
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:40,530
Can you wait for your $50 and we found
that there was no correlation whatsoever

420
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:44,490
with conscientiousness.
If people were extroverted or if you

421
00:20:44,491 --> 00:20:47,100
made them happy,
then they just counted the future.

422
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:50,290
And w w the way we interpreted that was
that,

423
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,340
well if things are going well now you
might as well capitalize on,

424
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,181
you know,
if,

425
00:20:55,181 --> 00:20:57,280
if,
because if all the signals that are

426
00:20:57,281 --> 00:21:00,130
coming towards you say,
well this is a good time,

427
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,350
why not take the resources now and use
them?

428
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,710
So anyways,
that's,

429
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,790
that's just an example of how tricky
this is.

430
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,950
You,
you will notice if you know anything

431
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:12,970
about prefrontal cortical function
theories that all of these descriptions,

432
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:13,960
planful,
organized,

433
00:21:13,961 --> 00:21:17,800
task oriented and so on,
have been attributed to the prefrontal

434
00:21:17,801 --> 00:21:20,410
cortex butter that,
that uh,

435
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,710
that research haven't found any evidence
for that even though it's the prime

436
00:21:23,711 --> 00:21:26,650
theory of prefrontal function.
Okay.

437
00:21:26,651 --> 00:21:28,960
So what,
what is conscientiousness associated

438
00:21:28,961 --> 00:21:29,830
with?
Well,

439
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:34,480
denise and Heller have showed that if
you measure it over any reasonable

440
00:21:34,481 --> 00:21:37,060
amount of time,
it's associated with life satisfaction

441
00:21:37,061 --> 00:21:39,550
and happiness.
Now you might want to ask yourself,

442
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:41,980
well,
what is life satisfaction or happiness?

443
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,650
Which is a really good question,
especially if you measured with the

444
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:49,120
questionnaire because we've already
established that if you measure with a

445
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:51,430
questionnaire or something like emotion
or personality,

446
00:21:51,431 --> 00:21:54,550
you get the Big Five.
So it's not obvious that you can derive

447
00:21:54,551 --> 00:21:57,520
something like a life satisfaction or
happiness questionnaire and have it

448
00:21:57,521 --> 00:21:59,710
measured something separate from the big
five.

449
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,460
And so what happens is that most people
who report that they're satisfied with

450
00:22:03,461 --> 00:22:08,290
life or happy are high in extroversion.
They're happy and low in neuroticism.

451
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,860
They're not unhappy.
So that eats up a big chunk of the

452
00:22:11,861 --> 00:22:14,110
various and unsurprisingly,
right?

453
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:17,560
And so that sort of puts whether you're
happy or satisfied with your life firmly

454
00:22:17,561 --> 00:22:19,900
in the domain of temperament,
but it does turn out the

455
00:22:19,901 --> 00:22:24,160
conscientiousness also influences that,
especially over longer spans of time.

456
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:29,670
So hard work pays off.
But it's tricky too because you also

457
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,980
have to understand that hard work only
pays off in a society that's very

458
00:22:32,981 --> 00:22:34,940
stable.
And so maybe that's part of their,

459
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:38,590
the reason for the association between
industriousness and orderliness,

460
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:40,570
right?
Because maybe you work really hard to

461
00:22:40,571 --> 00:22:42,680
gather up your little pile of,
of,

462
00:22:42,681 --> 00:22:44,950
uh,
what would you call acquisitions and

463
00:22:44,951 --> 00:22:46,840
assets,
which you need obviously.

464
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,070
And then the whole society collapses and
you know,

465
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,680
the thugs come in and steal it all.

466
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,060
It's like,
are you stupid?

467
00:22:52,061 --> 00:22:55,450
Because you should have just spent all
that money before the thugs could steal

468
00:22:55,451 --> 00:22:57,580
it.
And that's obviously the case in very

469
00:22:57,581 --> 00:23:01,270
many human societies.
It's dangerous to be industrious because

470
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,420
you'll gather up property that's
valuable and then that just makes you a

471
00:23:04,421 --> 00:23:07,030
target.
So it might be that industriousness

472
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:09,790
doesn't pay off without order.
Something like that.

473
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,430
So,
and I've also wondered too,

474
00:23:12,431 --> 00:23:13,510
it's like,
well,

475
00:23:13,511 --> 00:23:15,550
I'll talk to you about that a little bit
later.

476
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:19,000
Okay.
Now recently a researcher face guard,

477
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,960
also working with Roberts,
was looking at the emotions that might

478
00:23:22,961 --> 00:23:27,340
be associated with conscientiousness.
And this is rather a new approach

479
00:23:27,341 --> 00:23:31,060
because we kind of thought that we had
the emotions tied up already in the big

480
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:31,571
five,
right?

481
00:23:31,571 --> 00:23:34,450
There were the positive emotions and
they loaded on extroversion.

482
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,940
That's nice and simple.
And there were the negative emotions and

483
00:23:36,941 --> 00:23:39,130
they loaded gun neuroticism and that's
that.

484
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,030
But it turns out that that's not that,
that there are emotions that fall

485
00:23:43,031 --> 00:23:48,031
outside of the rubric,
simply negative neuroticism and simply

486
00:23:48,741 --> 00:23:51,680
positive extroversion.
And they seem to be what people have

487
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:53,840
often called,
like social emotions.

488
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:59,140
And so those would be guilt and shame.
Those are two of them because like you

489
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:02,960
feel guilty maybe when you haven't lived
up to an obligation.

490
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:06,320
And so an obligation is usually
something that occurs because it's,

491
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:10,940
you're embedded in the social context
and you feel ashamed.

492
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,620
That distinction between guilt and shame
is a tricky one.

493
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:20,230
You feel guilt for yourself and shame in
front of other people.

494
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,520
Something like that.
You know,

495
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,960
guilt won't necessarily make you turn
red,

496
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:25,760
but shame will.
And so there's,

497
00:24:25,761 --> 00:24:28,160
you know,
there's actual behavioral displays that

498
00:24:28,161 --> 00:24:32,180
are associated with these emotions.
It turns out that conscientiousness is

499
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:37,181
associated with guilt.
Proneness but not the experience of

500
00:24:37,821 --> 00:24:39,260
guilt.
That's a tricky thing.

501
00:24:39,261 --> 00:24:42,860
So let's say you're prone to guilt.
Well that'll make you conscientious and

502
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:45,380
if you're conscientious and now if you
do the things you're supposed to do,

503
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,620
then you don't have to feel guilt.
So you can see why that would be rather

504
00:24:48,621 --> 00:24:51,710
tricky to discover.
So guilt seems to be associated with

505
00:24:51,711 --> 00:24:55,520
conscientiousness and although this
hasn't been assessed yet,

506
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,000
we think that it's,
it may be particularly associated with

507
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,580
industriousness rather than ordering
this.

508
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:05,120
And the reason I'm pausing that,
and it's not demonstrated yet.

509
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,140
The reason I'm positing that is because
we know that orderliness is associated

510
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:11,600
with something else.
It's associated with sensitivity to

511
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:16,601
discussed and discussed as a whole
different emotion than fear or,

512
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,920
or pain,
let's say.

513
00:25:18,921 --> 00:25:21,200
And it's tricky because,
you know,

514
00:25:21,201 --> 00:25:23,390
think of a horror movie.
Okay,

515
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:26,330
so what exactly constitutes horror?
Well,

516
00:25:26,331 --> 00:25:27,830
there's the,
um,

517
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:32,340
what's that movie called?
The witches of Blair witch project.

518
00:25:32,341 --> 00:25:34,280
Have you seen the Blair witch project?
Okay.

519
00:25:34,281 --> 00:25:38,060
The Blair witch project is all fear.
Nothing ever happens in the movie.

520
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,000
It's just this horrible sense that
something awful is going to happen at

521
00:25:41,001 --> 00:25:42,470
any moment.
Pure fear.

522
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,020
And so that's a horror movie.
But then there's the other kind of

523
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:47,660
horror movies where people get like
sought up with chainsaws.

524
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,490
And so then you think,
well those,

525
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:53,840
those both come under the horror rubric.
But the one is almost pure fear.

526
00:25:53,841 --> 00:25:56,090
And then the other is what is it
exactly?

527
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:00,480
Is it fear and disgust?
So it looks like the splatter film,

528
00:26:00,481 --> 00:26:03,290
so to speak,
capitalize on disgust and horror.

529
00:26:03,291 --> 00:26:04,160
And the,
the,

530
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:08,030
the sense of horror is partly fear.
But also partly discussed.

531
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:13,190
And so does disgust.
Sensitivity system looks very old,

532
00:26:13,191 --> 00:26:16,100
evolutionarily,
although it looks particularly well

533
00:26:16,101 --> 00:26:18,320
developed in human beings because it's
not that obvious.

534
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:23,960
It's not that obvious that animals show
discuss the same way human beings do.

535
00:26:23,961 --> 00:26:25,160
I mean,
think about dogs,

536
00:26:25,161 --> 00:26:25,821
right?
Jesus,

537
00:26:25,821 --> 00:26:26,500
those things,
they're,

538
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,700
they're like,
everything smells good to a dog,

539
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,110
you know,
and they'll eat virtually anything too.

540
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,620
But humans aren't like that at all.
We're very picky.

541
00:26:33,621 --> 00:26:36,320
Maybe because we're on numerous,
I don't exactly know.

542
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:40,460
We're very picky and you know,
there's also specific facial expressions

543
00:26:40,461 --> 00:26:42,140
that are associated with disgust.
You know,

544
00:26:42,141 --> 00:26:45,690
they're like that me,
it's partly an expulsion facial

545
00:26:45,691 --> 00:26:47,440
expression.
You're closing your eyes so you don't

546
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,140
have to see it.
You're closing your nose so you don't

547
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:52,370
have to smell it.
It's like repulsion and re repugnant or

548
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,440
associated with disgust sensitivity.
So,

549
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,510
so here's the things that,
yes.

550
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,373
Do you have any questions?
Yeah.

551
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,200
Um,
so people that have eating disorders,

552
00:27:01,201 --> 00:27:03,090
do you think that are,
because you said orderliness,

553
00:27:03,091 --> 00:27:05,480
you don't think that's related to deal
with as much as the

554
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:11,550
are high guys.
Do you think that they have any sort of,

555
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:14,130
because of sensitivity to discuss where,
because of the video where I feel

556
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,013
fields?

557
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:15,831
No,
I think it's,

558
00:27:15,831 --> 00:27:18,530
my experience has been,
they're pretty sensitive to discuss.

559
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:22,000
And part of that seems to be,
this is this constellation that I want

560
00:27:22,001 --> 00:27:24,740
to talk about.
So being sensitive to discuss it seems

561
00:27:24,741 --> 00:27:28,340
to go along with a lot of other things
like black and white moral thinking.

562
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:31,670
It's like things are either good or
they're not.

563
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:36,010
And there's no gray area in between him.
And I like anorexics are like that too

564
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:38,600
to a great degree.
Like it's black or white,

565
00:27:38,601 --> 00:27:41,140
there's no gray at all.
And um,

566
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,790
they're also very judgmental people who
are orderly.

567
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:46,610
And I think the black and white thinking
goes along with the,

568
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,350
with the,
with the judgment.

569
00:27:48,351 --> 00:27:50,480
It's like while you read they're doing
well or you're not,

570
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,640
there isn't,
there's no mucking about in the middle.

571
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,370
And so they're hard on themselves,
orderly people,

572
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,110
but they're also hard on other people.

573
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,970
And one of the things we know for
example,

574
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:01,940
is that if you're conscientious,
although it predicts workplace success

575
00:28:01,941 --> 00:28:04,100
and that sort of thing and general
wellbeing,

576
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,250
if you're conscientious and you become
unemployed,

577
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,440
you're in real trouble.
Because you know,

578
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,330
maybe because you're conservative in
your fundamental orientation,

579
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,330
you think all those people without jobs,
they're just fundamentally useless.

580
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,290
You know,
if they just tried harder,

581
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,740
they would get to where they're going,
which of course has some truth to it,

582
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:25,940
but not completely.
So then you fall into that category and

583
00:28:25,941 --> 00:28:28,910
well then you're kind of,
they say hoist with your own Fitara,

584
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,560
right?
Because now you're among the,

585
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:33,710
the great unwashed and because your
disgust sensitive,

586
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:37,880
that's not going to make you very happy.
So conscientious people suffer a lot

587
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,830
when things happened to them that are
bad because they also assume because

588
00:28:42,831 --> 00:28:46,460
they seem to be very fond of willpower,
they also assume that well,

589
00:28:46,461 --> 00:28:49,190
with just enough effort and with just
enough willpower,

590
00:28:49,191 --> 00:28:51,680
you can get yourself out of out of
anything.

591
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,200
And you know,
that's sort of true.

592
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,600
If you put a lot of effort into
something,

593
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:58,870
the probability that you'll do well
increases.

594
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,060
But that isn't the same as if you try
hard enough,

595
00:29:02,061 --> 00:29:03,470
you can get out of anything.
Right?

596
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:05,150
You don't,
you know what I need and the is they're

597
00:29:05,151 --> 00:29:06,200
really matters.
So,

598
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,330
um,
cause there's lots of things that hard

599
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:12,830
work isn't going to get you up and
sometimes persisting and per separating

600
00:29:12,831 --> 00:29:16,340
if something is actually the wrong thing
to do rather than the right thing to do.

601
00:29:16,341 --> 00:29:20,450
So it's very tricky.
So the orderly types are conservative.

602
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:23,210
To make you conservative,
you have to be high in order to be this

603
00:29:23,211 --> 00:29:26,750
and low in openness,
especially the more creative element of

604
00:29:26,751 --> 00:29:29,000
openness say rather than the intellect
element.

605
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:33,110
So that's interesting too because of
course people tend to think that their

606
00:29:33,111 --> 00:29:35,690
political preferences established by the
rationality,

607
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,620
you know,
I'm a liberal because being a liberal is

608
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,530
the right way to be.

609
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,740
And here's a bunch of reasons why that's
the way to be.

610
00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:43,930
And you know,
I've thought that through and that's why

611
00:29:43,931 --> 00:29:45,850
I'm a liberal.
It's like turns out that's probably

612
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:48,490
completely wrong or at least mostly
wrong.

613
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,660
You have your temperament and your
temperament makes you intrinsically

614
00:29:52,661 --> 00:29:55,840
value certain things.
And then because you intrinsically

615
00:29:55,841 --> 00:29:58,600
valued them,
the arguments about why those things are

616
00:29:58,601 --> 00:30:01,690
good or attractive to you.
And then you remember those arguments.

617
00:30:01,691 --> 00:30:05,710
And so liberals for example,
are much more concerned with harm and

618
00:30:05,711 --> 00:30:09,610
care than conservatives are.
And conservatives are more concerned

619
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:12,160
about things like purity.
And so,

620
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,360
and those are basic,
you know,

621
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:16,300
those are basic,
you should be concerned about both of

622
00:30:16,301 --> 00:30:18,670
those things.
So the purity issue,

623
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:22,210
it's like,
well what happens if your living

624
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,270
quarters are filthy and,
and your hygiene habits are terrible.

625
00:30:25,271 --> 00:30:28,030
The answer to that is your house gets
full of parasites,

626
00:30:28,031 --> 00:30:31,570
rats and mice and bugs and you get sick
and then you die.

627
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,150
And so,
and maybe people around you do too.

628
00:30:34,151 --> 00:30:37,090
So you know,
the purity issue really matters.

629
00:30:37,091 --> 00:30:39,520
You don't want to eat rotten meat.
Do you want to make sure it's stored

630
00:30:39,521 --> 00:30:41,200
property?
You don't want to have the rats eat all

631
00:30:41,201 --> 00:30:42,710
your grain,
so you're grading.

632
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,230
These have to be in really good order
in,

633
00:30:44,231 --> 00:30:45,820
there can't be any holes in them.
And so on.

634
00:30:45,821 --> 00:30:49,730
And so like orderliness and food
preservation and,

635
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:53,530
and preservation from illnesses and
contamination and all those sorts of

636
00:30:53,531 --> 00:30:54,364
things.
It's like,

637
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:55,001
yeah,
yeah,

638
00:30:55,001 --> 00:30:57,040
that's really important.
You can't,

639
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,520
you can't just push that away and say
it's irrelevant.

640
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:03,010
It's not irrelevant at all.
So,

641
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:04,900
but then again,
you can make it to relevant,

642
00:31:04,901 --> 00:31:06,790
you know.
So one of the things you see with the

643
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:09,070
anorexics is that,
you know,

644
00:31:09,071 --> 00:31:12,220
they're so sensitive to discuss that
they can't stand their own bodies.

645
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,110
And that's a weird thing,
right?

646
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:16,780
Because like as a body,
a good thing or a bad thing.

647
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:18,310
Well here,
here's an example.

648
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,750
So here's an experiment.
So you have,

649
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:23,680
you give someone a sterilized cup and
you say,

650
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,210
well,
you know,

651
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:28,870
put some saliva in the cop and then you
let it sit for 10 seconds and then you

652
00:31:28,871 --> 00:31:29,531
say,
well drake,

653
00:31:29,531 --> 00:31:32,740
that right now in La,
do you record like this?

654
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,130
Right.
And that's discussed,

655
00:31:34,131 --> 00:31:35,350
said,
now you won't do that.

656
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,190
But then you might ask,
well,

657
00:31:36,191 --> 00:31:38,800
why,
why wouldn't you do that?

658
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,600
I mean,
it was in your mouth like 10 seconds

659
00:31:40,601 --> 00:31:43,120
ago.
So like what's the big problem while

660
00:31:43,121 --> 00:31:44,410
people,
people won't do it.

661
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,960
And you can see a heuristic at work
there,

662
00:31:46,961 --> 00:31:49,870
right?
The heuristic is don't drink saliva.

663
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:55,070
And it's not like moderated by any sort
of trivial situational determinants.

664
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:58,240
You're just not going to do it.
But I suspect that you do kiss your

665
00:31:58,241 --> 00:32:00,940
partner for example,
right?

666
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,721
And then you think,
oh,

667
00:32:01,721 --> 00:32:03,490
well that's kind of a weird exception.
It's like,

668
00:32:03,491 --> 00:32:05,800
oh well my partner turns out not to be
disgusting.

669
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:07,090
At least that's what you hope.
And then,

670
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:08,741
and so,
you know,

671
00:32:08,741 --> 00:32:10,120
there's this and that,
you know,

672
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:14,110
and,
and there's also this weird inhibitory

673
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,980
process that goes on between sexual
attraction and discuss to,

674
00:32:17,981 --> 00:32:18,431
you know,
and,

675
00:32:18,431 --> 00:32:20,880
and the psychoanalysts,
you know,

676
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:22,630
they were,
they thought of that as something that

677
00:32:22,631 --> 00:32:25,330
was perhaps somewhat pathological,
sexual guilt,

678
00:32:25,331 --> 00:32:27,190
sexual shame,
disgust and all that.

679
00:32:27,191 --> 00:32:29,080
But far as I can tell,
it's a,

680
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,320
it's a,
it's a biological moderating factor in

681
00:32:32,321 --> 00:32:34,210
part of the reason for that as well.
You know,

682
00:32:34,211 --> 00:32:38,320
just how many sexually transmitted
diseases do you actually want to have,

683
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,760
especially that many of them are,
you know,

684
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:42,920
syphilis in the 19th century.
Man That was,

685
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:46,190
that was deadly.
It was transmissible from generation to

686
00:32:46,191 --> 00:32:47,024
generation.

687
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,600
It acted like every other kind of
disease and there wasn't any cure for

688
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:52,400
it.
And then of course we had aids in the

689
00:32:52,401 --> 00:32:55,740
1980s we kind of got a handle on that,
but it was just bloody lock,

690
00:32:55,741 --> 00:32:59,000
you know?
And it was a very transmissible and so

691
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:03,530
sexual contamination is a big issue and
it always has been for the human race

692
00:33:03,531 --> 00:33:06,200
because it turns out that sexual
activities really good way of

693
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:08,900
transmitting disease.
So you know,

694
00:33:08,901 --> 00:33:11,390
the,
the borderline between discussed as

695
00:33:11,391 --> 00:33:15,950
something that protects you in your life
and discussed as something that turns

696
00:33:15,951 --> 00:33:17,600
you off of life completely.
It's,

697
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:22,780
it's a really tight and,
and contradictory set of like mutual

698
00:33:23,571 --> 00:33:25,970
inhibiting forces.
It's a real problem for people.

699
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:29,570
So,
okay,

700
00:33:29,571 --> 00:33:30,141
so,
so,

701
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:32,030
so what do you,
what do you have orderliness?

702
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:33,650
Okay.
Orderly people are black and white

703
00:33:33,651 --> 00:33:35,210
thinkers.
They're judgmental.

704
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,910
If you talk,
if you show orderly,

705
00:33:37,911 --> 00:33:41,900
people imagine that you have them dis,
you described to them some kind of

706
00:33:41,901 --> 00:33:45,860
crime,
like maybe it's living off the fruits of

707
00:33:45,861 --> 00:33:46,670
prostitution.

708
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:48,860
So maybe you talk to them about a pimp
and you know,

709
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:50,840
you give them a little story about the
pimp and then you say,

710
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:53,330
how long should this pimp you thrown in
jail?

711
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,970
It's like the orderly people think you
just lock them up,

712
00:33:55,971 --> 00:33:57,110
throw away the key.
You know,

713
00:33:57,111 --> 00:33:57,820
they're,
they're,

714
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,110
they judged moral transgressions very
harshly.

715
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,810
And so that's part of the,
that's part of the aspect that's

716
00:34:02,811 --> 00:34:05,210
judgmental.
They're nodding Galitary and either they

717
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:07,940
don't think that everybody should have
the same amount all the time.

718
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,520
They're pretty,
they're pretty interested in hierarchy

719
00:34:10,521 --> 00:34:12,230
and structure.
And you know,

720
00:34:12,231 --> 00:34:14,150
there's some real advantages to
hierarchy.

721
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,520
Um,
people think that they'd be happier in

722
00:34:17,521 --> 00:34:21,200
an egalitarian situation.
But the problem with the egalitarian

723
00:34:21,201 --> 00:34:23,840
situations is people are always arguing,
right?

724
00:34:23,841 --> 00:34:26,480
Because no one's right in an egalitarian
situation.

725
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,370
There just,
everybody gets to have their opinion and

726
00:34:28,371 --> 00:34:29,690
it's like,
you know,

727
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,810
when are we going to stop with all the
opinions and do something.

728
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:37,070
And the thing about a hierarchy is the
advantage to a hierarchy is there are

729
00:34:37,071 --> 00:34:40,250
things you are responsible for,
but there's also things you're not

730
00:34:40,251 --> 00:34:42,650
responsible for.
And that's a big advantage.

731
00:34:42,651 --> 00:34:45,740
And then you also know who is
responsible for those things.

732
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:49,910
So it looks like people are more
comfortable in hierarchies then they

733
00:34:49,911 --> 00:34:53,000
think even if they're liberals.
So that's kind of interesting to be.

734
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:56,510
So anyways,
all those things seem to chunk together.

735
00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:00,080
Now the industrious people also seem to
want to climb up the hierarchy,

736
00:35:00,081 --> 00:35:02,300
right?
Cause you know that industrious people

737
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,790
become more successful as they move
through life.

738
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,740
And so you think,
well that's sort of a motivation.

739
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:10,280
But then you might ask,
is the investment is person trying to

740
00:35:10,281 --> 00:35:14,570
get to the top or is the industrious
person trying to get the hell away from

741
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:17,390
the bottom?
And my suspicions are that the

742
00:35:17,391 --> 00:35:20,060
industrious person is trying like hell
to get away from the bottom.

743
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,910
They don't want to be down there with
the,

744
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,940
you know,
like I said,

745
00:35:22,941 --> 00:35:25,940
the unemployed and the great unwashed
and now why?

746
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:28,130
Well,
here's a bunch of reasons.

747
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,520
First of all,
we know pretty clearly that if you're in

748
00:35:31,521 --> 00:35:35,330
a dominance hierarchy,
the closer you are to the bottom of the

749
00:35:35,331 --> 00:35:37,650
hierarchy,
the more likely you to die.

750
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:41,070
So when that's independent of absolute
income,

751
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,950
like obviously if you're poor enough
that's going to make a difference cause

752
00:35:43,951 --> 00:35:45,210
you're just,
you're going to starve to death.

753
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:48,660
But assuming you have enough money to
take care of your basic needs,

754
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,450
then dominance,
hierarchy position is a big determinant

755
00:35:51,451 --> 00:35:54,030
of mortality even in heart disease and,
and,

756
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:59,120
and more if you look at songbirds or any
other kind of animal that lives in the

757
00:35:59,221 --> 00:36:01,350
dominance hierarchy.
And that's pretty much the case for all

758
00:36:01,351 --> 00:36:03,510
animals.
So imagine you have a garment in Turkey

759
00:36:03,511 --> 00:36:07,560
of songbirds in your neighborhood and
the high dominant songbirds.

760
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,120
So there may be industrious songbirds.
They get the best nest and then you

761
00:36:12,121 --> 00:36:13,710
think,
well what is the best nest mean?

762
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,320
Well,
it's close to nesting material so they

763
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:19,160
don't have to like exert a lot of energy
building the nest and it,

764
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,880
it's,
it's dry when it rains,

765
00:36:20,881 --> 00:36:23,670
so that's a good thing because then
their eggs don't get wet and get cold

766
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,340
and there aren't a lot of predators look
lurking around and it's well hidden and,

767
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:30,000
and it's well ventilated.
Like there's a bunch of things that make

768
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,380
an optimal nesting site really useful.
So there's a bunch of birds and some of

769
00:36:34,381 --> 00:36:36,450
them have great nesting sites and some
of them have like,

770
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,820
you know,
slum nesting sites.

771
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:41,640
And then some kind of epidemic comes
through.

772
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,300
Guess what happens?
The birds die from the bottom of the

773
00:36:45,301 --> 00:36:46,860
hierarchy upwards.
Well,

774
00:36:46,861 --> 00:36:48,690
why?
Because the ones at the bottom are

775
00:36:48,691 --> 00:36:52,050
chronically stressed and stress shuts
off your immune system.

776
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:55,590
And so it's like poof.
Epidemic comes through dead.

777
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:00,740
And so one of the things that may well
have been built into human beings as the

778
00:37:00,781 --> 00:37:04,770
biological basis of industriousness is
the desire to get the hell away from the

779
00:37:04,771 --> 00:37:07,950
bottom of a dormant.
It's Harkey as fast as possible because

780
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:10,450
you're much more likely to die if you're
down there.

781
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,620
And you know,
we know that your trait preferences have

782
00:37:13,621 --> 00:37:16,110
emerged as a consequence of evolutionary
pressure.

783
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,410
And if the bottom of the dominance
hierarchy happens to be the place where

784
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:20,470
diseases,
right,

785
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:24,660
which is exactly how it is,
then of course you should be motivated

786
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:28,650
to get the hell out of there.
And so I think a lot of the class

787
00:37:28,651 --> 00:37:33,570
distinctions that people draw and their
desire to have markers of status and so

788
00:37:33,571 --> 00:37:38,571
on are are a reflection of their high
motivation to be associated with the

789
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:43,500
high levels of the,
of the economic classes.

790
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,300
Here's something interesting.
For example,

791
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:48,840
you know that names go down the
dominance hierarchy,

792
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,670
you know,
so what are you gonna name your

793
00:37:50,671 --> 00:37:54,570
children?
Well the origin nater of names are the

794
00:37:54,571 --> 00:37:57,180
people at the top of the dog.
It's hard and you know,

795
00:37:57,181 --> 00:38:01,890
and then once they established the names
then the next group starts to copy them

796
00:38:01,891 --> 00:38:04,890
and then the next group copies them.
And then by the time the name gets

797
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:07,350
common at the bottom of the dominance
hierarchy,

798
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:09,180
the people at the top are no longer
using it.

799
00:38:09,181 --> 00:38:10,620
They've got some other,
Dave's figured out.

800
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:15,000
And so names get not only generated that
way but also recycled that way.

801
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,700
So,
and you never want to underestimate the

802
00:38:17,701 --> 00:38:21,420
motivation of people to not be at the
bottom of the dominance hierarchy.

803
00:38:21,421 --> 00:38:24,030
And so it's kind of the reverse of
achievement motivation,

804
00:38:24,031 --> 00:38:25,950
right?
It's sort of like getting away.

805
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:30,300
But if conscientiousness is mostly
associated with these kind of negative

806
00:38:30,301 --> 00:38:31,290
emotions,
guilt,

807
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:32,970
shame,
and disgust,

808
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,370
then those are all getting away from
emotions.

809
00:38:36,371 --> 00:38:37,270
Those are,
oh,

810
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:38,890
it's good to go that way.
Emotions.

811
00:38:38,891 --> 00:38:41,740
But those would be more associated with
extroversion and openness.

812
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,190
So when conscientious people seem to be
dutiful,

813
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,280
so they're not doing things because
they're interested in them.

814
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,290
In fact,
they would say,

815
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,270
who the hell cares?
If you're interested in it,

816
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:55,180
do it anyways.
That's what a good citizen does.

817
00:38:55,181 --> 00:38:56,500
And of course there's some truth in
that,

818
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,970
right?
You do your damn duty.

819
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,230
So,
okay,

820
00:38:59,231 --> 00:39:02,530
so you kind of get the sense of how
conscientiousness is,

821
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,400
is structured now that's often be called
a behavioral immune system.

822
00:39:06,401 --> 00:39:10,150
So the other thing we know about orderly
people and conservatives is there,

823
00:39:10,151 --> 00:39:11,950
anti-immigration,
as I said,

824
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:15,580
and their aunt and their xenophobics or
they're much more pro in group and

825
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,550
they're quite harshly judgmental in
their attitudes towards nonstandard

826
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,590
sexual behavior.

827
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,100
And you can explain that all in terms of
contamination fear.

828
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,410
And so,
and you might think to,

829
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,273
you know,
like,

830
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,430
hey,
you know what happened to the native

831
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:32,710
Americans when the European showed out
pay because the Europeans,

832
00:39:32,711 --> 00:39:34,780
they lived in these like filthy,
filthy cities.

833
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:37,810
They're just crammed together and they
lived with their animals too.

834
00:39:37,811 --> 00:39:40,390
So like they,
they were parasite written and they had

835
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:43,270
all sorts of diseases but they got it
good,

836
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:45,790
good immune systems functioning as a
consequence of that.

837
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,780
And over,
you know,

838
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:50,620
a period of a long period of time they
developed immunity to things that would

839
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:51,730
have otherwise killed them.
Like,

840
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,310
well chicken pox and measles and that
sort of thing.

841
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:57,460
So the Europeans came over to North
America and they shook hands with the

842
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:58,600
natives.
It was like Poof,

843
00:39:58,601 --> 00:40:02,500
95% of them died in the next 50 years.
So it was like,

844
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:05,410
by the time the settlers came to
Plymouth Rock,

845
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,240
you know,
the pilgrims,

846
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,570
there are so few native Americans
laughed that they were happy to see them

847
00:40:10,571 --> 00:40:12,370
cause they couldn't get the damn crops
off.

848
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:15,940
There were enough people left.
So part of the reason that North America

849
00:40:15,941 --> 00:40:19,930
looked empty when the European showed up
is because three successive waves of

850
00:40:19,931 --> 00:40:24,840
absolutely catastrophic plagues had
decimated the entire population of the,

851
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,590
of the continent.
You know,

852
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,480
in the same thing still happens when,
when,

853
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,570
when the,
you know,

854
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:34,990
when in places like Brazil and Peru when
they find isolated native groups in the

855
00:40:34,991 --> 00:40:37,720
jungle because you know,
that still happens now and then it's

856
00:40:37,721 --> 00:40:38,351
like,
oh look,

857
00:40:38,351 --> 00:40:40,030
some natives shake your hand,
poof,

858
00:40:40,031 --> 00:40:43,120
they're all dead in like a year.
So the,

859
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:48,320
the idea that the,
the foreign person is a danger has,

860
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:54,900
has been like critically,
critically correct for much of human

861
00:40:55,391 --> 00:40:57,340
developmental history.
And that's a real problem,

862
00:40:57,341 --> 00:40:59,500
right?
Because obviously in the modern world we

863
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:02,830
better get along with everybody because
of course we're all powerful enough to

864
00:41:02,831 --> 00:41:04,290
wipe each other out.
But you know,

865
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:07,900
the problem is is you might think about
things like xenophobia,

866
00:41:07,901 --> 00:41:10,160
you know,
preference for your own group and out

867
00:41:10,161 --> 00:41:11,170
group,
uh,

868
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,230
prejudice and that kind of thing as like
a cognitive issue.

869
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:16,570
While you could just sort it out if you
thought it properly,

870
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,840
but this is all this research indicates
it's a lot worse than that.

871
00:41:19,841 --> 00:41:23,950
It's some sense because it's grounded in
something much deeper and nor reason

872
00:41:23,951 --> 00:41:26,500
grounded in something much deeper.
It seems to be grounded in something

873
00:41:26,501 --> 00:41:28,330
that's necessary,
right?

874
00:41:28,331 --> 00:41:31,300
If you're not disgust sensitive,
well then your hygiene habits aren't

875
00:41:31,301 --> 00:41:32,980
very good.
Well then you get sick more.

876
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,150
Plus you don't work as hard,
then your life isn't as good,

877
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,820
you know?
So it's,

878
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:41,430
it's another one of those examples where
where the virtue is and where the vices

879
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,310
is very,
very difficult thing to tell.

880
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:46,370
So,
so I'm going to read this.

881
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:50,090
This is from a paper that I wrote with,
with one of my students named Jacob

882
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,770
Hersch.
We haven't published this paper yet.

883
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,480
I want to read it to you because like I
said,

884
00:41:53,481 --> 00:41:57,290
I don't have this information at hand
point as well as I would like to.

885
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,900
So this way I can get the information to
better.

886
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,980
Disgust is considered to be one of the
basic human emotions defined by a strong

887
00:42:03,981 --> 00:42:07,290
revulsion and desire to withdraw from
enlisting stimulus or event.

888
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:11,270
Darwin noted this fact that 1872 so he
was the first person to note that

889
00:42:11,271 --> 00:42:14,120
discussed was a basic emotion,
physically disgust.

890
00:42:14,121 --> 00:42:17,900
It's accompanied by a distinct facial
expression involving constriction of the

891
00:42:17,901 --> 00:42:19,850
oral and nasal cavities.
You know,

892
00:42:19,851 --> 00:42:21,680
and that's a really good way to insult
someone.

893
00:42:21,681 --> 00:42:24,020
You know,
all you have to do to really insult

894
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:25,750
someone's making discussed face at the
Mar.

895
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:28,370
It's something they said.
They really do not like that because

896
00:42:28,371 --> 00:42:32,090
basically what you're saying is you're
kind of like a parasite or an infectious

897
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:36,150
disease.
Evolutionary models of discuss propose

898
00:42:36,151 --> 00:42:40,100
that this emotion involved to help us
avoid contaminated or harmful foods or

899
00:42:40,101 --> 00:42:44,540
other potential sources of diseases such
as sexual content in addition to its

900
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:48,710
role in directly helping to expel
harmful foods from the body discussed

901
00:42:48,711 --> 00:42:51,950
also forms an important component of the
behavioral immune system.

902
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:56,510
The suite of psychological mechanisms
that aid in the detection and avoidance

903
00:42:56,511 --> 00:43:00,650
of potential contaminants before they
can make contact with the body means

904
00:43:00,651 --> 00:43:02,570
obsessive compulsive disorder.
You know,

905
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,090
people will touch something that they
regard as contaminated,

906
00:43:05,091 --> 00:43:08,450
then rush off to wash their hands and
wash and wash and wash.

907
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,610
If some of them are washed,
delete the soaps,

908
00:43:10,611 --> 00:43:12,470
gone.
They'll have showers until they run out

909
00:43:12,471 --> 00:43:14,990
of hot water.
Like they just can't stop.

910
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,850
That's part of obsessive compulsive
disorder.

911
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:19,190
It looks like it's a disorder of
disgust,

912
00:43:19,191 --> 00:43:21,620
even though it's classified with the
anxiety disorders,

913
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,810
harsh inducing disgust responses,
whether via a foul order,

914
00:43:26,811 --> 00:43:30,350
a disgusting work environment,
or we calling it disgusting experience

915
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:34,100
leads individuals to assign harsher
punishments to others who had committed

916
00:43:34,101 --> 00:43:35,730
moral transgressions.
Ha.

917
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,840
Here's something else.
So if your judges,

918
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:41,960
if your judge is easily disgusted,
then you've done something relatively

919
00:43:41,961 --> 00:43:42,530
disgusting.

920
00:43:42,530 --> 00:43:44,960
Or maybe if the court room doesn't smell
so good that day,

921
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,850
well then you're going to end up in jail
longer.

922
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,980
It also,
here's the worst situation.

923
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,860
You go into cart and you're applying for
parole.

924
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:55,900
Okay?
And it's just before lunch and the court

925
00:43:55,901 --> 00:43:58,280
room doesn't smell good.
It's like you're not gonna get parole

926
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:02,060
because Hungary judges are much more
likely to deny you parole.

927
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:06,740
And then of course judges who are
sensitive to discuss are going to regard

928
00:44:06,741 --> 00:44:09,410
your moral transgression as harsher and
you can prime that.

929
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,460
And so you,
I think the data showed that judges

930
00:44:13,461 --> 00:44:17,210
after lunch or like 70% more likely to
grant parole.

931
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:20,720
It's like it's whether or not the judge
is hungry is more,

932
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:23,750
it's a bigger determinant of whether or
not you get parole than what you've

933
00:44:23,751 --> 00:44:25,280
done.
It's really quite,

934
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,620
it's really quite funny.
You know,

935
00:44:27,621 --> 00:44:32,130
unless you're up for parole,
harsher moral judgments can even be

936
00:44:32,131 --> 00:44:35,610
induced following the consumption of a
bitter drink because people are often

937
00:44:35,611 --> 00:44:40,260
disgusted by bitterness and addition the
same disgust related facial expressions

938
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,480
or observed in response to unpleasant
tastes,

939
00:44:42,481 --> 00:44:46,920
disgusting photographs and receiving
unfair treatment in an economic game.

940
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:50,580
So our sense of justice,
that's a weird thing.

941
00:44:50,581 --> 00:44:54,180
Our sense of justice seems to be,
who would guess that day that it's,

942
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:56,670
that it's,
that it's centered in our,

943
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,040
you know,
from a biological perspective in the

944
00:44:59,041 --> 00:45:03,300
systems that mediate discussed.
So I've seen this,

945
00:45:03,301 --> 00:45:04,590
you know,
among people who've,

946
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,930
who've received an injustice,
you know,

947
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:08,910
so,
so some things being done to them that's

948
00:45:08,911 --> 00:45:11,970
not good and they're often unable to let
it go,

949
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,420
partly because they're disgusted with
themselves for not responding to it

950
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,770
properly.
It's like,

951
00:45:16,771 --> 00:45:19,290
you know,
if someone throws a dark at you and then

952
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,020
it's like you have a moral obligation to
respond to that,

953
00:45:22,021 --> 00:45:24,630
right?
And you can think about it as anger or

954
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,720
something like that.
But part of it also seems to be that

955
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:31,350
you're ashamed if you don't respond.
And you can see that sort of thing

956
00:45:31,351 --> 00:45:33,450
happening in cultures of honor,
you know,

957
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:36,030
where if,
if purity is violated,

958
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:38,130
you see these in these situations where,
you know,

959
00:45:38,131 --> 00:45:41,430
a father maybe kills his daughter,
which happens reasonably often because

960
00:45:41,431 --> 00:45:43,260
she's violating some sort of social
norm.

961
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:45,360
Part of the idea is that,
well,

962
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:50,100
you know,
if you don't respond harshly to

963
00:45:50,101 --> 00:45:52,110
something that's associated with
disgust,

964
00:45:52,111 --> 00:45:54,600
then you bring dishonor on your entire
family and maybe your own,

965
00:45:54,601 --> 00:45:56,700
your entire community.
And you know,

966
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,710
we don't like that sort of thinking in
the west,

967
00:45:58,711 --> 00:46:00,270
but,
well,

968
00:46:00,271 --> 00:46:04,200
but the reasons that we don't approve of
that sort of thinking,

969
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,040
we think it's because we're liberal.
But I think the evidence suggests that

970
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:11,280
the reason that we don't approve of
those sorts of behaviors is because we

971
00:46:11,281 --> 00:46:13,950
live in a very clean environment and we
have plumbing.

972
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:18,090
And so there's all sorts of things that
we do that reduced the probability that

973
00:46:18,091 --> 00:46:22,140
we're going to be contaminated by
parasites or infectious diseases.

974
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:25,560
And so that means that we don't feel
that it's necessary to respond as

975
00:46:25,561 --> 00:46:27,960
harshly to moral transgressions.
And you know,

976
00:46:27,961 --> 00:46:29,310
you might think,
well I doubt it,

977
00:46:29,311 --> 00:46:31,650
but let me show you the evidence because
it's,

978
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,180
it's unbelievable.

979
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:37,260
Concerns about cleanliness and feelings
of disgust have likewise been related to

980
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:40,710
political attitudes,
situational reminders of the importance

981
00:46:40,711 --> 00:46:44,160
of physical cleanliness,
such as asking participants to wipe

982
00:46:44,161 --> 00:46:47,910
their hands with antiseptic wipes tends
to increase self reported political

983
00:46:47,911 --> 00:46:51,390
conservatism.
Such a finding is consistent with the

984
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:54,870
notion that purity tends to be valued
more by conservatives than by liberals.

985
00:46:55,710 --> 00:46:59,250
Individuals who report being disgusted
more easily also tend to hold more

986
00:46:59,251 --> 00:47:02,010
conservative political views on topics
including abortion,

987
00:47:02,011 --> 00:47:03,210
gay marriage,
tax cuts,

988
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:06,570
and affirmative action.
In addition to the effects that have

989
00:47:06,571 --> 00:47:09,420
emerged when using self report disgust,
sensitivity,

990
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:13,050
more conservative political views have
also been associated with stronger

991
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:15,630
physiological reactivity to disgusting
images.

992
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:20,900
We've found that conservatives are not
only more aroused by disgusting

993
00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:24,330
stimulant,
they're more aroused by any stimuli.

994
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,250
Happiness,
hunger,

995
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,840
fear,
you name it,

996
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:30,130
it affects the conservative than the
liberal.

997
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:32,140
And then we've also found that if you
put,

998
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,770
you take undergraduates and you expose
them to videos,

999
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:39,160
but induced various physiological
states,

1000
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,600
happiness,
sadness,

1001
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,040
fear,
disgust.

1002
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:45,220
And then we also asked people how long
it was since the last eight.

1003
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,460
Well,
if you put people in one of those

1004
00:47:48,461 --> 00:47:51,820
emotional or motivational states and
then you show them political speeches,

1005
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,570
the more emotional they are or the
hungrier,

1006
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:57,340
the more they like conservative
speeches.

1007
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:00,880
So that was actually very interesting.
So

1008
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,200
a large literature is converged on the
notion that there are two core

1009
00:48:05,201 --> 00:48:07,330
dimensions of conservative political
ideology,

1010
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:10,750
resistance to change and tolerance of
inequality.

1011
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:14,350
Okay.
Resistance to change reflects the extent

1012
00:48:14,351 --> 00:48:16,600
to which people wish to maintain the
status quo.

1013
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:19,870
While tolerance of inequality reflects
the acceptance of an unequal

1014
00:48:19,871 --> 00:48:23,500
distribution of resources and
opportunities within society.

1015
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:26,320
You don't want to,
so there's the sort of the idea that the

1016
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:31,321
bash rise to the top and the best is
moral judgment and the top is the right

1017
00:48:31,721 --> 00:48:33,310
place for the best people to be.

1018
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:34,570
And then you might ask,
well,

1019
00:48:34,571 --> 00:48:37,300
why is the top the best?
I mean,

1020
00:48:37,301 --> 00:48:38,740
why did we assume that the,
the,

1021
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:40,630
the,
the top of a dominance hierarchy is the

1022
00:48:40,631 --> 00:48:41,670
right place to be?
Well,

1023
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:45,220
part of it is of course,
that the closer you are to the top of

1024
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:46,930
the dominance hierarchy,
especially if you're a male,

1025
00:48:46,931 --> 00:48:48,760
the more likely it is that you're going
to,

1026
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:49,893
you know,
um,

1027
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,870
be attractive to people of the opposite
sex.

1028
00:48:52,871 --> 00:48:54,100
So there's,
that's partly it,

1029
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:56,770
but then this other thing seems to be,
well,

1030
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,650
it's actually a bit,
it is a better place to be at the top

1031
00:48:59,651 --> 00:49:02,650
because it's,
it's cleaner and safer and there are

1032
00:49:02,651 --> 00:49:06,250
more resources there.
And so that accounts,

1033
00:49:06,251 --> 00:49:09,130
at least in part for the judgment of the
people who were at the bottom of the

1034
00:49:09,131 --> 00:49:12,790
hierarchy.
So these two dimensions of you're

1035
00:49:12,791 --> 00:49:16,330
roughly aligned with social and economic
conservatism as expressed in the

1036
00:49:16,331 --> 00:49:19,360
constructs of right wing
authoritarianism and social dominance

1037
00:49:19,361 --> 00:49:20,820
orientation respectable,
which you,

1038
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:23,260
which you could measure hypothetically
with questionnaires.

1039
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:28,620
So
these core facets of conservatism are

1040
00:49:28,881 --> 00:49:32,510
also closely related to to higher order
value dimensions described in moral

1041
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:35,450
foundations theory,
which reflect preferences for order and

1042
00:49:35,451 --> 00:49:39,080
tradition on the one hand and
preferences for egalitarianism on the

1043
00:49:39,081 --> 00:49:39,914
other.

1044
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:43,931
Okay,
so we'll,

1045
00:49:43,931 --> 00:49:47,090
we'll leave that part.
Political conservatives conservatism

1046
00:49:47,091 --> 00:49:51,500
confess be thought of as a social immune
system reflecting the extension of

1047
00:49:51,501 --> 00:49:55,550
pathogen avoidance mechanisms to the
integrity of the social system.

1048
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:59,330
Just as the behavioral immune system has
been conceptualized as helping to

1049
00:49:59,331 --> 00:50:02,330
maintain the purity and integrity of an
individual body.

1050
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:06,350
So to May the same pathogen avoidance
system help to maintain the abstract

1051
00:50:06,351 --> 00:50:10,040
integrity of the social order.
In particular,

1052
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:13,490
the social immune system would help to
maintain order by suppressing any

1053
00:50:13,491 --> 00:50:18,170
actions or individuals to deviate from a
group's accepted social traditions.

1054
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:22,190
So it has been reported,
for instance,

1055
00:50:22,191 --> 00:50:26,420
that regions with higher levels of
disease preference prevalence tend to be

1056
00:50:26,421 --> 00:50:29,810
associated higher levels of social
conformity and autocratic rule.

1057
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:34,280
Individuals who feel more vulnerable to
disease likewise report higher levels of

1058
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:36,470
ethnocentrism,
xenophobia.

1059
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,610
Such basic concerns about pathogen
avoidance be does contribute to the

1060
00:50:40,611 --> 00:50:44,540
desire for order and tradition among
conservatives along with the harsh moral

1061
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:47,270
judgements associated with violations of
the social order.

1062
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:50,510
In particular,
severe moral judgements may be a key

1063
00:50:50,511 --> 00:50:54,320
mechanism by which the social immune
system instantiated in conservative

1064
00:50:54,321 --> 00:50:58,820
practices and policies aims to eliminate
exposure to deviate social elements that

1065
00:50:58,821 --> 00:51:02,810
may increase the risk pathogen exposure.
Okay,

1066
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,510
now we wrote that about two years ago
now.

1067
00:51:05,511 --> 00:51:08,420
There was a paper published about three
months ago in plause one which you can

1068
00:51:08,421 --> 00:51:10,250
look up online.
I've got the reference for it here.

1069
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,740
Now.
This paper is absolutely mind boggling,

1070
00:51:12,741 --> 00:51:15,830
so I told you guys what effect sizes are
big,

1071
00:51:15,831 --> 00:51:19,070
right?
Like 0.2 that's pretty good 0.3 that's

1072
00:51:19,071 --> 00:51:23,420
larger than about two thirds of social
science studies published 0.5 it's like,

1073
00:51:23,421 --> 00:51:25,490
well,
you're dancing on moon because you just

1074
00:51:25,491 --> 00:51:28,430
don't get a correlation.
To a 0.5 between two things.

1075
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:32,150
Unless you're extraordinarily lucky.
It's like 95th percentile effect size.

1076
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:34,880
Okay,
so this paper was published about three

1077
00:51:34,881 --> 00:51:37,370
months ago.
Now I'm going to read you the abstract.

1078
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:38,780
Okay,
and then I'm going to show you briefly

1079
00:51:38,781 --> 00:51:42,380
show you the data.
According to the parasite stress

1080
00:51:42,381 --> 00:51:44,840
hypothesis,
authoritarian governments are more

1081
00:51:44,841 --> 00:51:48,800
likely to emerge in regions
characterized by high prevalence of

1082
00:51:48,801 --> 00:51:52,460
disease causing pathogens.
Recent cross national evidence is

1083
00:51:52,461 --> 00:51:56,150
consistent with this hypothesis,
but there are inferential limitations

1084
00:51:56,151 --> 00:51:58,490
associated with the evidence because
salad,

1085
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:01,100
you don't know what direction that
direction relationship is.

1086
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:04,920
We report to studies that address some
of those limitations and provide further

1087
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:09,970
tests of the hypothesis.
Study one revealed that parasite

1088
00:52:10,641 --> 00:52:12,770
prevalence,
and so that's parasites or infectious

1089
00:52:12,771 --> 00:52:17,771
diseases predicted strongly predicted
cross national differences on measures

1090
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:21,960
assessing individual's authoritarian
personalities and this effect

1091
00:52:21,961 --> 00:52:25,460
statistically mediated the relationship
between parasite prevalence and

1092
00:52:25,461 --> 00:52:28,010
authoritarian governance.
So what does that mean?

1093
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:33,560
More infectious diseases in the area.
The more likely the individuals in that

1094
00:52:33,561 --> 00:52:38,270
area are to have authoritarian political
beliefs and it's the authoritarian,

1095
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:40,940
authoritarian political beliefs of the
people,

1096
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:44,600
the individuals in the area that
produces the authoritarian government.

1097
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:47,960
So it isn't pathogen prevalence,
authoritarian government,

1098
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,810
authoritarianism.
It's not a top down thing.

1099
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:55,370
It's a bottom up thing and it's driven
by individuals and that seems to be

1100
00:52:55,371 --> 00:52:58,550
driven by just how likely they are to
catch something that's nasty and

1101
00:52:58,551 --> 00:53:00,530
infectious.
So then you think,

1102
00:53:00,531 --> 00:53:02,890
well in the west,
well what's the probability you're going

1103
00:53:02,891 --> 00:53:05,330
to catch something nasty and infectious?
It's like,

1104
00:53:05,331 --> 00:53:06,590
well,
very low.

1105
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,180
So you're liberal.
Now.

1106
00:53:08,181 --> 00:53:10,580
Wouldn't that be something if that was
actually the case,

1107
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:13,130
you know,
is that the west is liberal because it

1108
00:53:13,131 --> 00:53:17,270
has plumbing or could easily be,
I mean plumbing is no trivial thing,

1109
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,010
right?
That mean you think of all the things

1110
00:53:19,011 --> 00:53:21,620
you don't want to do without.
It's like in Canada,

1111
00:53:21,621 --> 00:53:24,820
plumbing would be number one and then
maybe he would be number two more.

1112
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:27,330
Maybe you would reverse those,
but it's way the hell up their

1113
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:32,940
study to have tested the parasite stress
hypothesis on a sample of traditional

1114
00:53:32,941 --> 00:53:36,510
small scale studies,
results revealed that parasite

1115
00:53:36,511 --> 00:53:40,110
prevalence predicted measures of
authoritarian governance and did so even

1116
00:53:40,111 --> 00:53:43,500
when statistically controlling for other
threats to human welfare.

1117
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:45,750
So it was,
it was pathogen prevalence,

1118
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:50,910
particularly one additional threat
famine also uniquely predicted

1119
00:53:50,911 --> 00:53:51,930
authoritarianism.
Okay,

1120
00:53:51,931 --> 00:53:55,800
so it's famine and disease.
Together these results further

1121
00:53:55,801 --> 00:53:59,580
substantiate the parasite stress
hypothesis of authoritarianism and

1122
00:53:59,581 --> 00:54:03,090
suggested societal differences in the
authoritarian governance result in part

1123
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:06,240
from cultural differences in
individual's authoritarian

1124
00:54:06,241 --> 00:54:08,520
personalities.
There's the data.

1125
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,260
Now you look,
this is just,

1126
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:12,300
it's just unbelievable.
So look at this.

1127
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:15,270
So one is authoritarian governance,
right?

1128
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,400
There's the correlation with pathogen
prevalence 0.42.

1129
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:23,570
So there's another,
um,

1130
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:28,890
failure that I didn't show here that
chosen either,

1131
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:32,790
this is from study to study one.
The correlation was 0.65.

1132
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:34,590
It's like,
Huh,

1133
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:38,520
isn't that interesting?
Maybe the reason that there are

1134
00:54:38,521 --> 00:54:42,090
authoritarian countries in the world is
because there's too many infectious

1135
00:54:42,091 --> 00:54:44,190
diseases.
And so the waiting to get rid of

1136
00:54:44,191 --> 00:54:47,610
authoritarianism is to get rid of
infectious diseases.

1137
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:50,760
So God,
who would have ever guessed that,

1138
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,600
you know,
and look at the it warfare was negative

1139
00:54:54,601 --> 00:54:55,740
0.11,
right?

1140
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,840
Do you think that might be associated
with authoritarian?

1141
00:54:57,870 --> 00:54:59,880
Melik?
Malnutrition wasn't even very big

1142
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:00,960
predictor.
You know,

1143
00:55:00,961 --> 00:55:04,200
famine,
actually men hit the hit the hit the

1144
00:55:04,201 --> 00:55:05,730
equation.
So Feminine,

1145
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:10,560
the probability of disease.
So now let's look at this from a

1146
00:55:10,561 --> 00:55:15,090
sociocultural perspective.
So I spend a lot of time studying Hitler

1147
00:55:15,091 --> 00:55:17,220
because I'm interested in the
ideological possession.

1148
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:19,620
You know,
tinder is a great example of that

1149
00:55:19,621 --> 00:55:20,850
because,
well,

1150
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,300
because his ideology was so harsh,
but it was also so attractive to people,

1151
00:55:24,301 --> 00:55:26,830
it was so unbelievably attractive.
You know,

1152
00:55:26,831 --> 00:55:29,520
when you're going to ask how the hell
you account for something like that.

1153
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:30,780
So,
um,

1154
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:33,720
I'm going to dim the lights a little bit
here because you guys have to be able to

1155
00:55:33,721 --> 00:55:35,160
see this.
So,

1156
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:39,180
all right,
so you look on the right theory.

1157
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:43,290
That's the Nuremberg parade ground.
So I hope you can see this a little bit,

1158
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:45,270
that the left,
and that's all people,

1159
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:46,350
right?

1160
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:49,650
So the Nazis built this parade ground
and Nuremberg that was like the biggest

1161
00:55:49,651 --> 00:55:53,700
parade ground ever built on the planet.
And they'd have hundreds of thousands of

1162
00:55:53,701 --> 00:55:55,440
people at these rallies,
right?

1163
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:58,290
And so you look at the order,
if there's a line down the middle there

1164
00:55:58,291 --> 00:56:00,870
where the leaders walk,
and that's at Nuremberg,

1165
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:04,440
and then it's just surrounded by these
masses and masses and masses of people

1166
00:56:04,441 --> 00:56:07,650
in lines and all these orderly displays
of power.

1167
00:56:07,651 --> 00:56:11,040
And then there's Hitler there like this.
And one of the things Hitler was really

1168
00:56:11,041 --> 00:56:13,950
proud of was the fact that he could
stand like that for like eight hours.

1169
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,710
And that was willpower as far as he was
concerned.

1170
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:20,640
And he was a worshiper of willpower and
he bathed four times a day.

1171
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:24,130
So he's also somebody who was very much
obsessed with cleanliness,

1172
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:26,680
cleanliness,
and willpower and order.

1173
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:27,790
So that's Hitler.

1174
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:32,980
So now we'll look at that.
That's something that's Nurburg again,

1175
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:34,840
so this is called the cathedral of
lights.

1176
00:56:34,841 --> 00:56:37,240
And so that,
that's the parade ground Darragh at the

1177
00:56:37,241 --> 00:56:39,610
bottom that I just showed you,
that was full of people.

1178
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:43,960
So you get some idea of how big that is.
Now all those lights around that which

1179
00:56:43,961 --> 00:56:46,780
they called the cathedral of likes was
the Luftwaffe,

1180
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:51,640
gave the Nazis all their antiaircraft
lights and then they arranged them

1181
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:54,460
around the parade grounds.
So the whole thing was enclosed by this

1182
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:59,170
perfectly orderly cathedral of lights.
And that was part of the spectacle that

1183
00:56:59,171 --> 00:57:03,010
went along with the Nazi with the Nazi
[inaudible] Nazi party rallies at

1184
00:57:03,011 --> 00:57:03,844
Nuremberg.

1185
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,770
And then so you know,
you look at the top left when they are,

1186
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:10,720
those are,
those are soldiers,

1187
00:57:10,721 --> 00:57:13,120
those are,
I can't remember at the Nuremberg

1188
00:57:13,121 --> 00:57:14,950
rallies,
they had all sorts of people there.

1189
00:57:14,951 --> 00:57:17,770
They had like the shovel brigade and
they were all standing there with their

1190
00:57:17,771 --> 00:57:21,700
shovels ready to go.
Shovel for Germany and and athletes and

1191
00:57:21,701 --> 00:57:24,660
all sorts of people arrayed.
So that you know,

1192
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:26,900
there,
there's this massive display of order in

1193
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:29,170
power.
So you look at the top left hand corner,

1194
00:57:29,171 --> 00:57:33,070
you see all those people are lined up,
it's absolutely perfect.

1195
00:57:33,071 --> 00:57:34,810
And then you see the same thing when the
right here.

1196
00:57:34,811 --> 00:57:37,570
And Look,
you look at the organization of that,

1197
00:57:37,571 --> 00:57:40,960
everything's square and perfect and
everybody's in line and you know,

1198
00:57:40,961 --> 00:57:43,750
they're all in uniforms and they're all
going like this the same way.

1199
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:46,540
And then when they,
when they marched the soldiers,

1200
00:57:46,541 --> 00:57:48,430
they were in perfect lines,
perfect squares,

1201
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:49,510
and they're all going like this.

1202
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:50,200
You know,
it's,

1203
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,830
it's absolutely rigid,
orderly perfection.

1204
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,950
And so the Germans,
what Germans tend to be conscientious,

1205
00:57:56,951 --> 00:57:58,630
you know,
which is part of the reason why they

1206
00:57:58,631 --> 00:58:01,630
have excellent engineers and part of the
reason why their economies so damn

1207
00:58:01,631 --> 00:58:03,760
powerful.
But one of the downsides of

1208
00:58:03,761 --> 00:58:06,340
conscientiousness is orderliness,
right?

1209
00:58:06,341 --> 00:58:07,510
And so well,
you know,

1210
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:11,710
people think the Nazis were uncivilized,
but the new evidence seems to suggest

1211
00:58:11,711 --> 00:58:14,320
that they weren't down civilized at all.
They were really,

1212
00:58:14,321 --> 00:58:16,120
really,
really civilized.

1213
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:19,120
And that if you get too civilized to
orderly,

1214
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:22,540
to conscientious,
then things go to hell in a handbasket

1215
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,590
very,
very rapidly.

1216
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:27,010
So
now this,

1217
00:58:27,011 --> 00:58:29,680
some of this stuff is awful,
but I'm going to read it to you anyways

1218
00:58:29,681 --> 00:58:32,980
because you need to know how this sort
of things work now.

1219
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,550
No Hitler emerged into power in the
1930s when,

1220
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:38,920
when Germany was in a real state of
chaos,

1221
00:58:38,921 --> 00:58:39,130
right?

1222
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:41,800
Cause it was after the second world war
or the first world war.

1223
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:45,100
You have to remember what happened at
the end of the first world war,

1224
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:49,570
the Spanish flu,
the Spanish flu epidemic,

1225
00:58:49,571 --> 00:58:53,980
which was generated in the trenches
because you can generate really intense,

1226
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:56,540
intentionally deadly,
um,

1227
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:00,370
illnesses if the owners can be
transmitted from one person to another

1228
00:59:00,371 --> 00:59:01,930
very quickly,
right?

1229
00:59:01,931 --> 00:59:04,720
Because the,
it's okay for the organism to kill you

1230
00:59:04,721 --> 00:59:07,660
as long as you last long enough to get
the eldest to the next person.

1231
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:10,300
And so if you're all crammed together,
it filthy conditions.

1232
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:12,490
The illness can just hop from person to
person.

1233
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:15,160
And so it can breed particularly deadly
forms.

1234
00:59:15,161 --> 00:59:18,370
That's what happened with Spanish flu.
And then the Spanish flu went all around

1235
00:59:18,371 --> 00:59:20,800
the world and it killed more people than
World War One did.

1236
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:22,630
Okay.
So that was world war one.

1237
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:26,480
Then there was the Spanish flu,
then the Germany economy fell completely

1238
00:59:26,481 --> 00:59:28,610
apart and there was hyper inflation.

1239
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:31,370
And so there was complete chaos.
And then the Germans were worried that

1240
00:59:31,371 --> 00:59:33,230
the communists were going to take over
and it was like,

1241
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:36,980
it was like a little bit of hell on
earth and so long came Hitler.

1242
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:39,350
Now Hector was one of these orderly
types.

1243
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:41,810
And so here's the kind of language he
used.

1244
00:59:42,530 --> 00:59:47,530
This is from a pamphlet from 1936 the
Jew as world parasite,

1245
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:52,040
the people in the world will recognize
the Jew as world parasite and there will

1246
00:59:52,041 --> 00:59:55,580
be a time when there will be one united
front of all people against the Jewish

1247
00:59:55,581 --> 00:59:58,340
world parasite.
And it depends with vans and humanity

1248
00:59:58,341 --> 01:00:01,560
will be freed from the most severe
illness for much it's suffered through

1249
01:00:01,561 --> 01:00:04,700
thousands of years.
Now you can think about this as metaphor

1250
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:08,870
and of course it is metaphor,
but it's a weird because it's not

1251
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:12,950
precisely conscious metaphor.
What seems to be happening is because

1252
01:00:12,951 --> 01:00:16,490
Hitler's one of these people who's
hypersensitive to discussed an extremely

1253
01:00:16,491 --> 01:00:17,710
orderly,
it's,

1254
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:21,580
it's natural for his mind to conceive of
categories in this way.

1255
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:25,610
Hidden there was always talking about
the area and people as like pure and

1256
01:00:25,611 --> 01:00:27,170
perfect,
but also as a body.

1257
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:32,590
So the area in race was a body.
And the problem that the area in Ray's

1258
01:00:32,691 --> 01:00:36,200
faced was that there was all these
parasites that were attacking it and it

1259
01:00:36,201 --> 01:00:40,580
was the moral obligation of the Germans
to push back against those parasitical

1260
01:00:40,581 --> 01:00:41,930
forces.
So,

1261
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:45,560
so here's what happened in Germany.
So Hitler,

1262
01:00:45,561 --> 01:00:47,510
when he came to power,
some of the things that happened to

1263
01:00:47,511 --> 01:00:49,880
Germany,
he's first started a public health

1264
01:00:49,881 --> 01:00:52,970
campaign.
And so he had these vans that had

1265
01:00:52,971 --> 01:00:54,680
doctors in the Max ray machines and so
on.

1266
01:00:54,681 --> 01:00:57,560
And they went all over Germany screening
people for tuberculosis,

1267
01:00:57,561 --> 01:00:59,990
which you know,
was infectious disease and also a

1268
01:00:59,991 --> 01:01:02,750
particularly terrible one.
They actually knocked down the rates of

1269
01:01:02,751 --> 01:01:05,360
tuberculosis in Germany quite a lot.
So it was like,

1270
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:06,313
well,
let's,

1271
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:09,710
let's embark on a public health and
cleanliness campaigns.

1272
01:01:09,710 --> 01:01:10,281
Like,
well,

1273
01:01:10,281 --> 01:01:12,170
okay,
you can get rid of tuberculosis that

1274
01:01:12,171 --> 01:01:13,220
way.
So then,

1275
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:15,740
then the next thing that he did,
or one of the next things that he did

1276
01:01:15,741 --> 01:01:19,520
was he was kind of irritated about how
messy and ugly the German factories

1277
01:01:19,521 --> 01:01:20,420
were.
So,

1278
01:01:20,421 --> 01:01:21,800
you know,
cause they're kind of dirty and they've

1279
01:01:21,801 --> 01:01:23,870
got rats in them and mice and bugs and
so on.

1280
01:01:23,871 --> 01:01:27,170
And so the next thing that they decided
to do was to clean up the factory.

1281
01:01:27,171 --> 01:01:28,330
So they had people,
you know,

1282
01:01:28,331 --> 01:01:32,060
a sweeping them all up and fixing the
grounds in front and planting flowers

1283
01:01:32,061 --> 01:01:35,150
and that kind of thing.
And they were fumigating them to get rid

1284
01:01:35,151 --> 01:01:37,760
of the parasites.
And the fumigation agent they used,

1285
01:01:37,761 --> 01:01:42,500
was it insecticide called Zyklon B and
[inaudible] was the gas that was

1286
01:01:42,501 --> 01:01:44,870
eventually used in the concentration
camps.

1287
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:47,690
And so,
so you can see the connection there,

1288
01:01:47,691 --> 01:01:47,990
right?

1289
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:50,260
It's like a logical progression of
ideas.

1290
01:01:50,261 --> 01:01:52,640
So the next thing that happened was
that,

1291
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:54,890
uh,
they decided their clean up the mental

1292
01:01:54,891 --> 01:01:56,360
asylums,
right?

1293
01:01:56,361 --> 01:01:57,600
Because well,
you know,

1294
01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:01,070
do you really want those sorted
defective people being parasites on

1295
01:02:01,071 --> 01:02:04,130
everyone else and should they really be
allowed to reproduce?

1296
01:02:04,131 --> 01:02:05,410
If Navy,
it'd be just better to,

1297
01:02:05,411 --> 01:02:07,550
you know,
euthanize them because they are useless

1298
01:02:07,551 --> 01:02:10,400
and they're suffering anyways.
And so that seemed to go pretty well.

1299
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:12,800
And then,
well then you know,

1300
01:02:12,801 --> 01:02:13,910
what happened next,
you know,

1301
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:15,680
then the,
the extension,

1302
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:19,500
the next extension was well to anything
that was foreign,

1303
01:02:19,501 --> 01:02:22,650
like a foreign body.
And then this showed up in all sorts of

1304
01:02:22,651 --> 01:02:23,610
weird ways.
So,

1305
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:27,030
um,
not see as the most who grew to some

1306
01:02:27,031 --> 01:02:31,800
degree out of like nature worship.
I don't know how else to describe it.

1307
01:02:31,801 --> 01:02:35,520
There were kind of nature cults in
Germany in the 1930s and they went way

1308
01:02:35,521 --> 01:02:39,420
back and one of the things the nature
coats were concerned about in Germany

1309
01:02:39,421 --> 01:02:42,990
with the presence of invasive species in
the German,

1310
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:44,340
uh,
you know,

1311
01:02:44,341 --> 01:02:46,650
in,
in the German ecological system.

1312
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:48,660
You know,
when we complained about that now too,

1313
01:02:48,661 --> 01:02:49,171
because,
you know,

1314
01:02:49,171 --> 01:02:52,350
you get plants coming over from China
and places like that,

1315
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:54,060
that,
you know,

1316
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:56,670
spread through ecosystems and
hypothetically disrupt them.

1317
01:02:56,671 --> 01:02:58,680
But you know,
and that seems like a reasonable thing

1318
01:02:58,681 --> 01:02:59,910
to be concerned about.
But,

1319
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:03,810
but the reason I'm pointing out the
connection is because you never know

1320
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,850
where these systems of ideas are going
to lead.

1321
01:03:05,851 --> 01:03:06,451
Right?
It's like,

1322
01:03:06,451 --> 01:03:07,680
oh,
contamination.

1323
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:08,970
Okay,
fair enough.

1324
01:03:08,971 --> 01:03:12,990
You know what contaminations real well,
who's responsible for the contamination?

1325
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:16,200
Hot.
That's where things start to get tricky.

1326
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:18,480
You know,
when the Nazis just kept pushing them,

1327
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:22,590
pushing the limit.
And so I'll show you some of the things

1328
01:03:22,591 --> 01:03:25,080
that come from Hitler speeches or right,
it's,

1329
01:03:25,081 --> 01:03:29,160
this is from my end comp.
So since the state did not possess the

1330
01:03:29,161 --> 01:03:32,980
power to master the disease,
the menacing decay of the right was

1331
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:33,570
manifest.

1332
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:34,470
It's,
that's all disgust,

1333
01:03:34,471 --> 01:03:35,850
sensitivity,
contamination.

1334
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:39,450
The masses feel that the mere fact of
the Jews existence is as bad as the

1335
01:03:39,451 --> 01:03:42,450
plague.
Politicians tinkering around on the

1336
01:03:42,451 --> 01:03:45,900
German national body saw it.
Most of the forms of our general

1337
01:03:45,901 --> 01:03:49,620
disease,
but blindly ignored the virus at the

1338
01:03:49,621 --> 01:03:53,490
time of the unification.
The inner decay was already in full

1339
01:03:53,491 --> 01:03:57,010
swing and the general situation was
deteriorating from year to year.

1340
01:03:57,011 --> 01:03:57,844
So it's all,
you know,

1341
01:03:57,870 --> 01:04:00,930
decay and disgust and contamination
metaphor.

1342
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:05,790
The symptoms of decay of the prewar
period can be reduced to racial causes.

1343
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:08,250
The Nation did not grow inwardly
healthier,

1344
01:04:08,251 --> 01:04:12,900
but obviously language more and more.
Anyone who wants to cure this era,

1345
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:17,550
which is inwardly sick and rotten,
must first of all summon up the courage

1346
01:04:17,551 --> 01:04:20,790
to make clear the causes of the disease.
Um,

1347
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:24,660
they think that they must demonstrate
that they are ready for appeasement so

1348
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:29,460
as to stay the deadly cancerous ulcer
through a policy of moderation.

1349
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:32,730
The Jew must take care that the plague
does not die.

1350
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:36,420
If this battle should not come,
Germany would decay and at best would

1351
01:04:36,421 --> 01:04:40,410
sync to ruin like a rotting corpse.
You can see in the right today an

1352
01:04:40,411 --> 01:04:45,270
example of mortal decay.
The 1st of May can only be the

1353
01:04:45,271 --> 01:04:49,080
liberation of the nation spirit from the
infection of internationalism,

1354
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:53,370
the restoration to health of peoples
against the infection of materialism

1355
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:56,070
against the Jewish pestilence,
we must hold a loft,

1356
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:59,000
a flaming ideal.
Now that's interesting because hidden,

1357
01:04:59,001 --> 01:05:01,110
they're reading light.
The use of fire.

1358
01:05:01,111 --> 01:05:04,470
Fire was a really primary element.
Fire and light.

1359
01:05:04,490 --> 01:05:07,530
We're real primary elements in the
Nuremberg rallies and you know,

1360
01:05:07,531 --> 01:05:09,960
fire has this purification element,
right?

1361
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:12,450
That's partly why they used to burn
heretics at the state.

1362
01:05:12,451 --> 01:05:14,910
It was like that's how you,
you purify things with fire.

1363
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:17,040
And of course you do purify things with
fire.

1364
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:20,200
Part of the reason that we cook things
is because if you cook them,

1365
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:23,110
then the pathogens die and then that's
purification.

1366
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:28,410
So it's not illogical.
I gave orders to burn out,

1367
01:05:28,541 --> 01:05:30,370
burn out,
down to the raw flesh,

1368
01:05:30,371 --> 01:05:32,860
the ulcers of this poisoning of the
wealth.

1369
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:35,860
Really unbelievably harsh,
harsh language.

1370
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:41,350
The only permanent way to cure disease
conditions is to disclose their causes.

1371
01:05:42,190 --> 01:05:43,180
Uh,
let's see.

1372
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:47,650
This is the battle against a veritable
world sickness which threatens to infect

1373
01:05:47,651 --> 01:05:50,770
the peoples of plague,
which devastates whole peoples and

1374
01:05:50,771 --> 01:05:54,370
international pestilence.
The international carrier of the

1375
01:05:54,371 --> 01:05:57,580
bacillus must be fought if within this
community,

1376
01:05:57,581 --> 01:06:01,090
one state is infected,
that infection is decisive for all

1377
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:03,610
alike.
And then so,

1378
01:06:03,611 --> 01:06:06,460
and he doesn't know,
he also doesn't just address this sort

1379
01:06:06,461 --> 01:06:11,410
of language towards the sorts of people
that he ended up eradicating or trying

1380
01:06:11,411 --> 01:06:14,680
to eradicate in the camps.
He also used that with regards to

1381
01:06:14,681 --> 01:06:15,190
communists.

1382
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:20,190
So we have very real interest in seeing
to it that this bullshit is plague shall

1383
01:06:20,531 --> 01:06:24,430
not spread over Europe.
National Socialism has made our people

1384
01:06:24,431 --> 01:06:27,530
and therefore the right immune from a
Bolshevik infection.

1385
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:30,440
Um,
it's Saturday.

1386
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:34,990
You get the point
and here's some more language from this

1387
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:37,510
metaphor from a book.
And I'll tell you the book in a minute.

1388
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:41,620
This is the man who wrote this book,
analyzed Hitler's writings and his

1389
01:06:41,621 --> 01:06:44,350
speeches looking for metaphorical
foundations.

1390
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,800
Um,
the spider was slowly beginning to suck

1391
01:06:47,801 --> 01:06:50,460
the blood out of the people's pores.
Um,

1392
01:06:50,770 --> 01:06:52,960
here are we face,
we'll have the list eating like

1393
01:06:52,961 --> 01:06:57,070
poisonous abscesses into the nation.
It's all this like you can hardly read

1394
01:06:57,071 --> 01:06:59,020
these things without being disgusted by
them.

1395
01:06:59,021 --> 01:07:01,420
You know,
it's all language that's associated with

1396
01:07:01,421 --> 01:07:04,570
disgust at not with fear.
And so that seemed to be very,

1397
01:07:04,571 --> 01:07:08,020
very appealing to the Germans have the
time.

1398
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:11,260
Horrible language.
I'm going to show you a bit of a film

1399
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:12,560
now.
Um,

1400
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,200
no,
we don't have a lot of time for it

1401
01:07:15,201 --> 01:07:16,100
unfortunately,
but I'll,

1402
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:17,750
I'll show you a little bit of it
anyways.

1403
01:07:18,310 --> 01:07:21,760
Um,
don't we use this?

1404
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,440
It kind kinda shows you how this,
how this,

1405
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:30,010
how these ideas were portrayed in,
in like

1406
01:07:31,550 --> 01:07:35,680
call
propaganda and effective propaganda

1407
01:07:35,681 --> 01:07:37,220
means might affect the prompt.
Again,

1408
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:23,990
[inaudible]
the political route

1409
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:21,873
shovel.

1410
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:48,030
So you get the picture.
I mean,

1411
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:53,270
you could hardly get a more compelling
representation of perfect orders and

1412
01:11:54,061 --> 01:11:55,110
that,
you know,

1413
01:11:55,111 --> 01:11:57,240
how many thousands of people do you
think there are?

1414
01:11:57,470 --> 01:12:02,460
They're all nicely arranged into perfect
squares,

1415
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:07,760
all moving at exactly the same way.
It's like war against pestilence.

1416
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:11,520
It's a very strange way of looking at
the Second World War,

1417
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:16,380
but the evidence is increasingly strong
that that's the right way to look at.

1418
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:19,440
All right,
so we'll see you guys on Tuesday.
