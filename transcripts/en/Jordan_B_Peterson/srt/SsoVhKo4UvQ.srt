1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:02,553
This lecture and the next are probably 
the most explicitly philosophical 

2
00:00:05,441 --> 00:00:06,274
lectures of the course.
Then we moved into psychometrics and 

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:10,863
biological psychology really,
and those are going to be the most 

4
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:19,231
scientific lectures of the course.
I was thinking this morning about when I

5
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:24,441
was preparing this lecture about
why I approach these topics this way.

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,320
I guess part of the answer is probably 
that it isn't.

7
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,080
It isn't clear that the study of 
personality,

8
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,083
at least in so far it has.
The concern is to further the 

9
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:45,024
development of personality,
which is a concern that's associated 

10
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,670
with the desire for mental health or 
subjective wellbeing,

11
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:54,300
which is a term I really don't like.
'Em or meaning.

12
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,750
It's not clear that those can be 
strictly scientific pursuits.

13
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:03,310
So then if they're not strictly 
scientific pursuits,

14
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:06,430
what what should you do about 
understanding them?

15
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:11,883
If you look at studies after studies,
the problem with that is you get a very 

16
00:01:15,971 --> 00:01:20,971
narrow slice of the domain and it's 
often not very comprehensible because in

17
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:23,170
order to understand the results of a 
study,

18
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,093
you have to have the knowledge,
the underlying knowledge that's 

19
00:01:25,871 --> 00:01:28,690
necessary to put the study in some sort 
of framework.

20
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,483
No,
that framework is going to be developed 

21
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:37,550
by studying the relevance scientific 
literature in psychological literature,

22
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:38,384
but behind that the framework has to be 
expanded to include the relevant 

23
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:42,674
philosophical assumptions
and I don't really think that you can 

24
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:49,750
understand the details without 
understanding the assumptions.

25
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,263
I,
I also think you're relegated to 

26
00:01:53,261 --> 00:01:54,094
memorization if you don't understand the
fundamentals and memorization has very 

27
00:01:58,601 --> 00:01:59,434
little to do with knowledge.
I mean you might be able to memorize 

28
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:03,174
procedures that would enable you to act 
on something like perhaps to fix an 

29
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:07,314
automobile here or to repair or to play 
a piece on the piano and it's not like 

30
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:12,460
those things are not worth doing,
but

31
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,180
for these ideas to take root and have 
effected meaning,

32
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,430
you have to understand them at the right
level of analysis.

33
00:02:22,431 --> 00:02:24,860
And one of the things I really like 
about personality theory,

34
00:02:24,861 --> 00:02:25,694
especially the clinical end of it,
although not exclusively the clinical 

35
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:28,844
end of it,
is that the people who were conducting 

36
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,533
clinical practice and writing clinical 
theory during the 20th century were in 

37
00:02:36,351 --> 00:02:41,330
fact dealing with the most profound 
problems that affect people.

38
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,193
I mean,
I started my academic career as a 

39
00:02:43,161 --> 00:02:45,860
political scientist.
Well in so far as your,

40
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:48,170
any sort of political scientist when 
you're an undergraduate.

41
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,930
I was not interested in it at all by my 
third year because what I found was that

42
00:02:53,931 --> 00:02:56,150
at least at this time,
and I don't know how much it's changed,

43
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,980
the political science,
scientists had already

44
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,250
decided that people were basically 
motivated by economic concerns.

45
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,193
And to me that just was no use at all 
because I wanted to know why they were 

46
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:12,160
motivated by economic concerns.
So

47
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,663
it's easy to understand people in some 
sense if you already decide what they 

48
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:17,904
value,
but if you can't figure out what they 

49
00:03:19,651 --> 00:03:22,350
value or what they should value,
that's a whole different issue.

50
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,540
And that psychology,
it's an.

51
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,374
And it's a deep question because it 
isn't even obvious whether the question 

52
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,503
are there things you should value is a 
reasonable question or that it can be 

53
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:38,630
reasonably answered thing.
I can tell you about that.

54
00:03:38,631 --> 00:03:41,090
That's most closely allied with my own 
experience.

55
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,223
I don't mean personal experience,
but say experience as a clinician is 

56
00:03:45,621 --> 00:03:49,340
that aimless people are in real trouble

57
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,490
now.
I don't necessarily know why that is and

58
00:03:53,491 --> 00:03:58,260
I don't necessarily know what that means
for what your aim should be,

59
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:02,070
but I've certainly seen for example,
like if you had to make a choice,

60
00:04:02,071 --> 00:04:02,904
which all of you will in the next five 
years or so between pursuing something 

61
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,793
like diligently and establishing a fixed
identity because of that or remaining 

62
00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:17,290
bereft of choice and drifting.
I,

63
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,680
I can tell you that if you drift by the 
time you're 30,

64
00:04:19,681 --> 00:04:22,530
you're going to be one miserable person.
Now,

65
00:04:22,531 --> 00:04:23,364
I'm not sure why that is exactly and I'm
not exactly sure that that necessarily 

66
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:29,640
means that picking something and 
sticking to it,

67
00:04:29,641 --> 00:04:32,190
which is a form of apprenticeship is 
better than drifting.

68
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,013
It depends on what you mean by better,
but I can tell you that not catalyzing 

69
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,433
an identity seems to be a mistake and 
it's a fatal mistake by the time you're 

70
00:04:42,691 --> 00:04:44,400
40.
It's very,

71
00:04:44,401 --> 00:04:45,234
very difficult to recover from it at 
that point because you're not young 

72
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:52,170
anymore at that point and if you try to 
catalyze an identity at that time,

73
00:04:52,171 --> 00:04:53,004
which sometimes can happen,
you're competing with all these like 

74
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:55,674
young,
shiny people and it's not who are much 

75
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:01,650
more full of potential from the 
perspective of an employer for example,

76
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,660
than you are.
It gets pretty dismal.

77
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,313
Anyways,
today we're going to go deeper into 

78
00:05:11,341 --> 00:05:14,100
philosophical presuppositions that we 
have in the past and

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,833
I want to familiarize you with what I 
think are the great philosophical and 

80
00:05:20,811 --> 00:05:23,480
psychological movements of the 20th 
century because they.

81
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,920
They shape you and they shaped the world
you live in in,

82
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:28,010
in ways that are.

83
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,530
They're incalculable and if you don't 
understand them,

84
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,663
you don't really know where you are.
You don't know where you are in history 

85
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:39,040
and you don't know what ideas you're 
possessed by.

86
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,680
No,
I think I told you when we were studying

87
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:42,843
that young said that people don't have 
ideas that ideas have people which I 

88
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:48,394
believe to be true.
One of young's lasting contributions in 

89
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:53,614
some sense was that you should know what
ideas possess you because otherwise you 

90
00:05:57,411 --> 00:05:58,244
won't know what the hell they're doing 
with you and when you think about all 

91
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:03,644
the irrational and apparently 
counterproductive things that people do 

92
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:09,080
as individuals and also in a mass.

93
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,380
You have to ask yourself if you want to 
be caught up in that sort of thing.

94
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,273
If you could be free from it.
If you are caught up in it just exactly 

95
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,433
where is it that you're headed,
which was also something that you 

96
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:23,794
thought you should figure out in case 
where you were headed was not 

97
00:06:26,651 --> 00:06:27,484
necessarily where you would go if you 
were making a fully informed conscious 

98
00:06:30,221 --> 00:06:31,054
where you would like to go.
If you're making a fully informed 

99
00:06:32,381 --> 00:06:33,214
conscious choice,
and I think the material that we're 

100
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:35,644
dealing with in the next two lectures is
is the most relevant of all of the 

101
00:06:39,161 --> 00:06:39,994
material we're going to cover with 
regards to the possession of people by 

102
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:48,670
ideas.
The existentialists

103
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,743
who are tightly aligned philosophically 
with the phenomenologists basically 

104
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:55,494
emerged as a psychological movement 
after World War II and there were 

105
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,004
reasons for this.
I mean one of the reasons was that it 

106
00:07:04,111 --> 00:07:04,944
was quite obvious not only that World 
War Two was an ideological battle 

107
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,750
fundamentally between fascism and 
western democracy,

108
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,333
roughly speaking,
and it was immediately supplanted by 

109
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:21,510
another ideological battle which was the
one between communism and liberalism,

110
00:07:21,511 --> 00:07:22,344
roughly speaking,
and so the issue of ideological 

111
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:29,340
possession
and the and the relationship between the

112
00:07:29,341 --> 00:07:34,341
individual whose ideologically possessed
and their responsibility and the actions

113
00:07:34,471 --> 00:07:39,000
of the state became paramount concerns 
in the 19 fifties as they should have.

114
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,263
You know,
because one of the last questions that 

115
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:42,923
that remained after World War Two that 
still has been insufficiently answered 

116
00:07:46,561 --> 00:07:49,770
is when the mask goes insane.

117
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,090
What is the culpability of the 
individuals who compose the mass?

118
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,493
Now you can circumvent that question,
say with regards to what happened in 

119
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,124
Nazi Germany by assuming that it was top
down coercion that turned the massive 

120
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:10,790
ordinary German citizens into majority 
Nazis,

121
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,313
but I don't think that there's any 
evidence that those sorts of ideas are 

122
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,494
true.
There is research bearing on people's 

123
00:08:17,691 --> 00:08:22,691
willingness to conform to authority 
figures and that is somewhat wral.

124
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:27,470
You know the famous experiments,
the prison experiment,

125
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,450
for example,
at Stanford,

126
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,313
where undergraduates were divided 
arbitrarily and two guards and 

127
00:08:32,781 --> 00:08:33,614
prisoners,
and then they ran a simulation of a 

128
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:36,194
prison.
Then of course the guards turned into 

129
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:41,610
sadistic psychopaths and the some of 
them did anyways,

130
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,590
and the prisoners turned into like 
cringing victims in no time flat.

131
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,230
You know,
there.

132
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,063
There's obviously an element there that 
that demonstrates that people are very 

133
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:55,040
responsive to situational cues and that 
that can go out of hand very rapidly,

134
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,040
but that doesn't necessarily mean that 
you can use

135
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,850
your tendency to be

136
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,753
accommodating to authority or the human 
tendency to be accommodating to 

137
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:09,384
authority as an explanation for the rise
of mass movements say like Nazi as Imr 

138
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,600
or communism because it doesn't really 
help.

139
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,400
The explanation doesn't really help.
It's like,

140
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:18,210
okay,
well,

141
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,043
fair enough.
Some people in the mass were mere 

142
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:23,040
followers.
What about the leaders?

143
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,503
Well,
maybe they're all followers right up to 

144
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:28,320
say Hitler,
so it's Hitler's fault.

145
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:29,790
It's all Hitler's fault.
It's like,

146
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,653
well,
you're elevating the guy to the status 

147
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:34,530
of a god at that point,
you know now and evil,

148
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:35,940
God,
but still,

149
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:38,460
if he's got all the motive power,
he's basically,

150
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,473
you can't.
You can't separate him from the idea of 

151
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:42,440
Lucifer,
you know,

152
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:45,270
he's become an archetypal figure of evil
at that point,

153
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,620
and it's the same with Stalin and Mao.
I mean,

154
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,473
no though,
those,

155
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,310
they were very,
very bad men.

156
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,290
There's no doubt about it.
But to localize all the evil in them and

157
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:58,520
to consider everyone else victimized 
followers is,

158
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,240
it's a convenient idea,
but it's not helpful.

159
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,453
Now that makes all the fault.
That just makes the followers pathetic 

160
00:10:09,011 --> 00:10:10,450
for a different reason.
You know,

161
00:10:10,451 --> 00:10:11,284
they're not actively self engaged in 
cruelty for their own purposes apart 

162
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,130
from conformity,
but they're just as pathetic and evil as

163
00:10:18,131 --> 00:10:21,610
they would be if they were doing it on 
their own volition.

164
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,140
I don't see the difference between a 
bully and bullies,

165
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,810
henchmen.
In fact,

166
00:10:25,811 --> 00:10:28,230
I think the bully probably has more 
encouraged than the henchman,

167
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,150
you know,
it's courage of a fairly peculiar sort.

168
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,013
But

169
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,980
so the existentialists,
this is what they were concerned about,

170
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,480
you know,
and the,

171
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,480
the locus of their concern was basically
it was basically Nicha

172
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,113
and you all know that
the reason I concentrate on nature and 

173
00:10:56,001 --> 00:10:56,834
also on Dostoevsky is because I think 
those two people summed up the 19th 

174
00:10:59,721 --> 00:11:00,554
century.
I really think that and that the 

175
00:11:03,591 --> 00:11:05,180
problems that they laid out

176
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,513
and predicted would unfold in the 20th 
century were the problems that unfolded 

177
00:11:13,601 --> 00:11:14,434
in the 20th century.
So they got their predictions right and 

178
00:11:16,991 --> 00:11:17,824
I think they got their causality right 
to and given the inability of social 

179
00:11:22,661 --> 00:11:25,600
scientists,
including psychologists to predict large

180
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:26,434
term mass events.
The fact that these two people managed 

181
00:11:29,111 --> 00:11:32,570
at 30 to 40 years before the events 
unfolded,

182
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,423
didn't even longer than that.
Seems to me that it's pretty much 

183
00:11:35,681 --> 00:11:37,960
worthwhile to consider them 
psychologists.

184
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,453
And uh,
certainly Nisha thought that of himself 

185
00:11:40,661 --> 00:11:44,020
and so to Dostoevsky for that matter.
And they had immense influence on people

186
00:11:44,021 --> 00:11:47,950
like Freud and jung and Rogers.
All the people that we'd been studying.

187
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:49,893
Their thinking is,
is lying underneath every issue we've 

188
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:55,010
discussed.
This is,

189
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:59,680
this is niches.
One of nature's great statements.

190
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,460
Okay,

191
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,293
what is great?
One must either be silent or speak with 

192
00:12:04,351 --> 00:12:06,090
greatness,
with greatness.

193
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,650
That means cynically in with innocence.
What I relate is the history of the next

194
00:12:10,651 --> 00:12:14,890
two centuries.
I described what is coming,

195
00:12:14,891 --> 00:12:17,800
what can no longer come differently?
The advent of nihilism,

196
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,273
our whole European culture is moving 
from some time now with a tortured 

197
00:12:22,651 --> 00:12:23,484
tension that is growing from decade to 
decade as towards the catastrophe 

198
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,293
restlessly violently headlong like a 
river that wants to reach the end that 

199
00:12:32,161 --> 00:12:35,220
no longer reflects,
that's afraid to reflect.

200
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,880
He that speaks here has conversely done 
nothing so far,

201
00:12:38,881 --> 00:12:39,714
but to reflect as a philosopher and 
solitary by instinct who has found his 

202
00:12:43,771 --> 00:12:47,250
advantage in standing,
aside outside,

203
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,090
why has the advent of nihilism become 
necessary?

204
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:58,110
Because the values we have had hitherto 
thus draw their final consequence.

205
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,183
Because Nihilism represents the ultimate
logical extension of our great values 

206
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,433
and ideals.
Because we must experience nihilism 

207
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,090
because before we can find out what 
value these values really had.

208
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,510
So one of nature's claims,
for example,

209
00:13:12,511 --> 00:13:13,344
was that
as Christianity in Europe transformed 

210
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:18,804
itself into science,
he felt that that one of the advantage 

211
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:28,840
to the Catholic domination of Europe for
so many centuries was that

212
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,693
the mind of the Catholic adherence who 
took the discipline seriously or the 

213
00:13:34,941 --> 00:13:35,774
dogmas seriously learn to interpret all 
events under the under the Schema of a 

214
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:42,854
single theory,
and he thought about that as a form of 

215
00:13:44,931 --> 00:13:46,250
discipline.
So you could imagine.

216
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:49,910
Imagine that if I,
if I want to teach you how to theorize,

217
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:53,810
I might teach you a theory and have you 
adopted

218
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,530
and niches point would mean be that 
well,

219
00:13:57,531 --> 00:14:00,170
that means you know a theory,
but it also means something else.

220
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,143
It also means that now you know how to 
theorize and the important consequence 

221
00:14:06,231 --> 00:14:08,300
of learning a theory may not be the 
theory.

222
00:14:08,301 --> 00:14:10,100
It may be that you've learned to fear 
rocks.

223
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,043
Now,
nature also pointed out that once you 

224
00:14:13,011 --> 00:14:15,530
learn to theorize,
you can separate yourself from the.

225
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,990
From the theory that gave rise to that 
knowledge.

226
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,350
And so you can start to theorize even 
about the theory that you mastered,

227
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,813
and he thought that's what happened to 
Europe as a consequence of its 

228
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,264
domination by Christianity,
especially because of Christianity is 

229
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:32,030
essential insistence on the utility of 
the truth.

230
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:32,923
Now he thought that was transformed 
after Catholicism into scientific 

231
00:14:37,071 --> 00:14:37,904
investigation,
but that the spirit of theorizing and 

232
00:14:39,981 --> 00:14:40,814
truth remained intact,
and then that the consequence of that 

233
00:14:43,101 --> 00:14:46,820
was that the European mind was 
disciplined by a dogma.

234
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,773
Then it freed itself from the dogma.
Then it turned its power on the Dogma 

235
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,550
and noted that the dogmas itself seemed 
to be grounded in nothing.

236
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,443
That you could get a grip on,
the way you grip things with an 

237
00:14:59,181 --> 00:15:01,490
empirical mind,
and so it fell apart.

238
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,673
You know,
and that's not saying much more than 

239
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:07,280
science posed a fatal challenge to 
religion,

240
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,050
but it's saying it in a much more 
profound and interesting way.

241
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,690
And it also explains why he makes this 
claim,

242
00:15:14,691 --> 00:15:18,830
that nihilism is the logical conclusion 
of the great values and ideals.

243
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:22,310
So he didn't think about nihilism as a 
counter proposition.

244
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:23,144
Say too dogmatic Christianity.
He thought about it as the logical 

245
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:30,440
outcome of that,
so now you think,

246
00:15:30,441 --> 00:15:31,550
well,
is that relevant?

247
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,590
Why is that relevant?
Well,

248
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,230
I think it's relevant for a lot of ideas
are for a lot of reasons.

249
00:15:36,231 --> 00:15:37,064
The first question is are the first 
observation might be that a tremendous 

250
00:15:41,781 --> 00:15:44,450
amount of mental illness,
and this is an existential claim,

251
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,040
is grounded in nihilism.

252
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,370
When someone who's depressed comes to 
see you,

253
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,533
what they often say is,
I can't see any point in life and that 

254
00:15:54,651 --> 00:15:55,484
isn't what they mean.
What they mean is they see the meaning 

255
00:15:59,031 --> 00:16:01,580
of life as suffering,
which is a meaning,

256
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:04,430
right?
It's and that that's not bearable,

257
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,490
and then the question is,
given that,

258
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,413
why bother with it?
And that's the fundamental question of 

259
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:13,640
suicide,
and it's a philosophical question.

260
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:17,600
I think it was [inaudible] who said that
the only real philosophical question was

261
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,050
whether or not to commit suicide.
Now you know,

262
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,170
that's a little dark.
I mean,

263
00:16:21,171 --> 00:16:22,740
he might get,
maybe it will come in,

264
00:16:22,741 --> 00:16:27,320
we could have used some Ssri,
but you get the point and it's,

265
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:28,010
it's,
it's,

266
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,620
it's,
it's inappropriate in my estimation,

267
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,993
to even discuss something,
even to discuss depression with someone 

268
00:16:36,441 --> 00:16:37,274
who's depressed,
especially if they're intelligent and 

269
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,183
open and therefore more tilted towards 
philosophical wonderings without 

270
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:46,460
actually addressing the issue.

271
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,850
Why live in the face of suffering?
Okay,

272
00:16:49,851 --> 00:16:53,390
so that's one problem.
It's to the degree that you will find it

273
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,980
difficult in your life to build anything
solid under your feet that you can stand

274
00:16:57,981 --> 00:17:01,310
on and and believe,
have faith in.

275
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,144
Let's say you're going to be adrift and 
the reason for that is a lot of the 

276
00:17:05,961 --> 00:17:06,794
things you're going to have to do will 
be difficult and they'll involve 

277
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,960
suffering,
which is also an existential claim.

278
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:12,794
So the existentialists for example,
they don't make the same claim Freud 

279
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:16,670
does.
Freud claims that

280
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,603
in some sense that the normal person is 
mentally healthy apart from the mild 

281
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,583
distress of normal life,
and then in order to be 

282
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:29,450
psychopathological you have to have been
hurt

283
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,813
and maybe multiple times or there's 
other things that could contribute to 

284
00:17:34,491 --> 00:17:36,080
that,
but the existentialists would say,

285
00:17:36,081 --> 00:17:36,351
no,
no,

286
00:17:36,351 --> 00:17:36,841
no,
let's.

287
00:17:36,841 --> 00:17:41,390
Let's just wait a minute here.
Maybe the fundamental condition of human

288
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:42,224
beings is nihilism and suffering and 
that something has to be produced to 

289
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,880
counter that in order for life to be 
tolerable.

290
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,053
Well,
that I think that's a perfectly 

291
00:17:55,021 --> 00:17:55,854
reasonable proposition.
Now it's a strange proposition because 

292
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:58,973
I've seen in my lifetime I've seen 
people who are tormented by existential 

293
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:04,740
ideas who can't get them out of their 
mind.

294
00:18:04,741 --> 00:18:07,260
You know,
ideas that relate to the meaning of life

295
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,840
and then other people and and concerned 
about death,

296
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:10,674
for example,
in the extinguishing of everything that 

297
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:12,804
seems to have any value.
It's our primary concern with them and 

298
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:19,020
then I've seen other people for whom 
those questions never seem to arise.

299
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,690
Now I think those people are,
first of all,

300
00:18:21,691 --> 00:18:22,524
I think they're conservative people.
I don't think they're very open and I 

301
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:27,180
think they're probably rather low in 
neuroticism,

302
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,463
so they're not philosophically curious.
They don't go up chains of abstractions 

303
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:32,933
and even if they do,
they don't necessarily get disturbed in 

304
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:38,730
the most profound areas of there being 
by the questioning,

305
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,970
but that still leaves plenty of people 
in the other category.

306
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,190
Now,
the nihilism.

307
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,024
Well,
you know there's naturalism and atheism 

308
00:18:51,761 --> 00:18:52,594
or closely related.
I don't think they're identical by any 

309
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:55,084
stretch of the imagination,
although I think it's difficult for 

310
00:18:57,401 --> 00:18:58,234
atheism to describe why it's not 
essentially nihilistic and that's 

311
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:06,880
Dostoevsky's big criticism because 
Dostoyevsky's claim was that without any

312
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:07,953
fundamental value assumed,
then there's no reason why you can't do 

313
00:19:13,031 --> 00:19:16,450
anything you want and that's his famous 
line.

314
00:19:16,451 --> 00:19:17,284
If there is no god,
then everything is permitted and all of 

315
00:19:18,971 --> 00:19:19,804
Dostoyevsky's novel writing is an 
exploration of that idea and sometimes 

316
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:26,764
it's an exploration of what that idea 
might mean if it was acted out in the 

317
00:19:29,261 --> 00:19:30,094
life of a given individual.
And so that would be say crime and 

318
00:19:31,811 --> 00:19:35,020
punishment and another would be say in 
his book,

319
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,810
the devil's are the possessed.
It's unreal.

320
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:37,840
It's a.
it's a,

321
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,733
it's an examination of what that idea 
means if it's gripped by an individual 

322
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,623
who has social and political ambitions,
and that's when Dostoevsky basically 

323
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,390
prophesied,
so to speak,

324
00:19:49,391 --> 00:19:53,650
that one of the consequences of the 
death of God would be the rise basically

325
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:54,484
of communist totalitarianism because 
essentially that's what he predicted in 

326
00:19:57,221 --> 00:19:58,054
the devils,
so that's pretty dead on accurate 

327
00:20:01,181 --> 00:20:01,630
prediction.

328
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,920
It was really quite stunning to me when 
I came across it.

329
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,850
Injury made exactly the same prediction 
by the way,

330
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,373
and so for those two men,
the the death of an ultimate meaning 

331
00:20:11,231 --> 00:20:13,780
system,
especially one that you can see when you

332
00:20:13,781 --> 00:20:15,790
think about something like European 
Christianity.

333
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,673
It's misleading in some sense because 
the system of beliefs that that 

334
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,793
constituted European Christianity and 
other great belief systems wasn't 2000 

335
00:20:26,051 --> 00:20:30,310
years old was like 25,000 years old.
You know,

336
00:20:30,311 --> 00:20:31,144
you.
You can think about a desk beginning at 

337
00:20:33,251 --> 00:20:34,780
year zero,
but it's a mistake.

338
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:37,180
It's a mistake from a historical 
perspective.

339
00:20:37,181 --> 00:20:38,014
The idea is that that,
that profound religious traditions are 

340
00:20:42,251 --> 00:20:45,580
predicated on are generally grounded in 
ideas that are much,

341
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,860
much older than the traditions 
themselves.

342
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,450
And so in some sense,
when at the end of the 19th century when

343
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:55,960
things fell apart for us and we can no 
longer rely on our,

344
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:59,440
our history,
predicated morality to guide us,

345
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,830
it wasn't merely that we lost an 
overlay,

346
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,760
a psychological overlay that had been 
laid on humanity for 2000 years.

347
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,480
It was way deeper than that.
We don't even know how long those,

348
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,583
how old those ideas are.
We knew we have some idea about how old 

349
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,064
they are.
They're at least as old as written 

350
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:17,044
culture.
But we also know that the people that 

351
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,910
who have been brought into the 
mainstreams of history,

352
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,100
you know,
as the world has united,

353
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,233
the people who are not literate had 
mythologies that drew from the same 

354
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:31,870
themes in some of those people as far as
we can tell,

355
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:37,000
had lived a lifestyle that was 
essentially unchanged for 25,000 years.

356
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:39,340
And so the Australian aborigines are 
like that.

357
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,773
So there's plenty of evidence that the 
idea is these ideas are extraordinarily 

358
00:21:44,591 --> 00:21:45,424
old.
And what that means is that when we 

359
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:47,710
separate from them,
in some sense,

360
00:21:47,711 --> 00:21:50,770
not only do we separate from our 
philosophical presuppositions,

361
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:56,220
but we separate from the historical 
consequences of our biology.

362
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:57,903
It's a serious problem.
And I think that's partly why it's very 

363
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,403
difficult to distinguish between someone
who's nihilistic and someone who's 

364
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:10,060
mentally ill.
That's not a radical claim.

365
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:10,894
I mean people especially who are on the 
depressed side of the distribution will 

366
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,060
will tell you that they're nihilistic.
You know,

367
00:22:16,061 --> 00:22:18,820
they may not use that terminology,
although they often do.

368
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,980
I just can't see any point.

369
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,740
So like,
well why does that matter?

370
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,210
Why?
Why does it matter?

371
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:29,110
It seems to be a fact that it matters.
So it's an interesting fact.

372
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,630
That's a phenomenal logical fact in some
sense,

373
00:22:31,631 --> 00:22:32,464
because one of the things that heidegger
pointed out and he was a founder of the 

374
00:22:35,231 --> 00:22:38,420
phenomenological school,
was that the,

375
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,700
the,
the,

376
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,533
your primary orientation to the world.
He thinks in a strange way that your 

377
00:22:43,481 --> 00:22:46,660
primary orientation to the world was one
of care.

378
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,490
So you could say,
well,

379
00:22:48,491 --> 00:22:53,491
what characterizes your experience?
What sort of creature ru and heidegger's

380
00:22:53,711 --> 00:22:54,730
answer would be?
Well,

381
00:22:54,731 --> 00:22:55,564
you're a creature who cares about things
in so far as you're engaged in the 

382
00:22:58,511 --> 00:22:59,344
world,
your primary orientation is one of care 

383
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,790
and you can think about that as a value,
right?

384
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:04,271
It's,
it's,

385
00:23:04,271 --> 00:23:05,104
it's,
it's a consequence of your value 

386
00:23:06,221 --> 00:23:08,860
orientation and God only knows where 
that comes from.

387
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,770
Part of its biological part of is 
developmental,

388
00:23:11,771 --> 00:23:13,690
part of it's historical.
It's very,

389
00:23:13,691 --> 00:23:14,524
very complex,
but if you stopped caring about 

390
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:20,100
everything,
you're in trouble and that that's one of

391
00:23:20,101 --> 00:23:20,934
the things that seems to indicate that 
caring is actually a fundamental 

392
00:23:23,731 --> 00:23:25,890
reality.
You start caring about things.

393
00:23:25,891 --> 00:23:26,724
You don't stop suffering and it seems 
that unless the caring counterbalances 

394
00:23:30,511 --> 00:23:31,344
the suffering,
you can't maintain an even keel and 

395
00:23:33,091 --> 00:23:35,270
that's partly because it doesn't seem 
just right.

396
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,080
I mean when terrible things happen to 
people,

397
00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:37,914
they always say,

398
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,103
well,
two things.

399
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:43,680
How is it that being could be 
constituted in this manner?

400
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:44,543
Like what the Hell's going at?
The fundamental levels of reality that 

401
00:23:47,191 --> 00:23:48,024
such suffering has to be the case.
You'll certainly ask that if you have a 

402
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:53,360
child who's diagnosed with cancer for 
example,

403
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,940
or you might think,
well,

404
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:56,863
why is this cruelty?
As it appears necessarily aimed at me 

405
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:01,064
right now in this place,
when hypothetically it could have not 

406
00:24:03,381 --> 00:24:07,160
happened at all or perhaps being visited
on someone more deserving,

407
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,620
you know,
which is the good remain,

408
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,290
the gooder punished to the evil remain 
unpunished,

409
00:24:12,291 --> 00:24:13,124
something like that,
so that that produces for human beings 

410
00:24:15,231 --> 00:24:20,231
that produces a cry of
of of a cry for justice.

411
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:23,234
How?
How can the world be constituted that 

412
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:25,244
way and that seems to be built into us.
Those aren't questions we can just 

413
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:28,364
avoid.
There are questions that will arise in 

414
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:33,080
your psyche.
They'll arise this fundamental questions

415
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:36,290
when when sufficiently terrible things 
happened to you,

416
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,900
so the existentialists would say,
well,

417
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:41,390
those are conditions of existence.
You're just stuck with that.

418
00:24:41,391 --> 00:24:42,224
It's part of it's part of human nature.
It's part of human being to to be 

419
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:49,700
perplexed by those questions.
Then the question is,

420
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:52,130
at least in part,
is there any way of answering them?

421
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,900
You said,
we require it some time.

422
00:24:57,901 --> 00:25:01,710
New Values.
Nihilism stands at the door.

423
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,920
Whence comes this uncanny as to all 
guests

424
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,343
point of departure.
It is an error to consider social 

425
00:25:10,831 --> 00:25:14,670
distress or physiological degeneration 
or corruption of all things as the cause

426
00:25:14,671 --> 00:25:16,560
of nihilism.
Now,

427
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,483
that's a typical night Nietzschean 
phrase because there are three profound 

428
00:25:21,121 --> 00:25:25,050
ideas in that sentence and each one is 
in a different phrase.

429
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,913
So neat.
You said at one point I can write in a 

430
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:29,820
sentence what other people write in a 
book,

431
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,890
and then he said,
well,

432
00:25:31,891 --> 00:25:33,870
what other people can't even write in a 
book,

433
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,240
and this sentence is a good example of 
that.

434
00:25:36,241 --> 00:25:37,290
So what does he say?
Well,

435
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,800
you know,
if you see that people are suffering and

436
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,753
in trouble,
one thing you can say that is that the 

437
00:25:43,861 --> 00:25:44,694
reason for that is that the economic 
system is unjust and they're layered 

438
00:25:47,191 --> 00:25:50,370
along the bottom and that's the 
fundamental cause of their suffering,

439
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,730
but nature doesn't allow that to be an 
interpretation,

440
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,713
a causal interpretation,
because he says there are multiple ways 

441
00:25:57,871 --> 00:26:01,830
of interpreting your position and mere 
absence of material.

442
00:26:01,831 --> 00:26:05,520
Luxury does not necessarily destined you
to one perspective or another

443
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:08,883
physiological degeneration.
While people are unhappy or suffering 

444
00:26:11,471 --> 00:26:12,304
because they're ill in some manner where
how you could make that a matter of 

445
00:26:15,971 --> 00:26:20,380
definition by saying that if you're 
suffering or unhappy you are ill,

446
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,333
but that's not a causal argument.
It's just a different way of 

447
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:24,214
categorizing the data and neat you would
reject that because he would also note 

448
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,463
that there's some correlation between 
physiological health and meaning in 

449
00:26:34,541 --> 00:26:35,374
life,
but the correlation is the correlation 

450
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:39,490
doesn't imply causality and and even if 
it did,

451
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,413
the relationship is by no means perfect 
to the that you would want a 

452
00:26:43,831 --> 00:26:44,664
relationship to be before you accepted 
it as relevant or corruption of all 

453
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:50,154
things.
While that would be the idea that being 

454
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:53,610
itself is evil,
like an evil trick,

455
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:55,320
which is what tolstoy said.
By the way,

456
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,363
when he wrote his confessions,
because tall story at the height of his 

457
00:26:58,891 --> 00:26:59,724
intellectual power,
he was the most famous novelist in the 

458
00:27:01,861 --> 00:27:04,740
world and unbelievably well regarded 
while throughout the world,

459
00:27:04,741 --> 00:27:05,574
but particularly in Russia and he was a 
very like socially benevolent man and 

460
00:27:09,691 --> 00:27:10,980
well regarded for his wisdom.

461
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,813
For years.
He was afraid to go outside with a rope 

462
00:27:14,011 --> 00:27:16,530
or a gun because he thought he would 
either hang or shoot himself.

463
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,753
And the reason for that was that he had 
been struck by the idea that life is so 

464
00:27:24,421 --> 00:27:25,254
unbearable that it should be eradicated.
And he couldn't think his way out of 

465
00:27:28,531 --> 00:27:30,150
that.
And it was,

466
00:27:30,151 --> 00:27:31,050
uh,
it was,

467
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:31,730
uh,
uh,

468
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:32,563
uh,
uh,

469
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,720
it was a,
a form of thought that was actually very

470
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,710
characteristic of intellectuals in 
Russia during his time,

471
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,360
in,
during his time,

472
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:43,410
in,
in his place.

473
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,693
I mean,
Dostoevsky wrote about exactly the same 

474
00:27:46,171 --> 00:27:47,070
sorts of things,

475
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:54,060
but it,
even tolstoy noted that merely observing

476
00:27:54,061 --> 00:27:57,660
that the world was a corrupt and evil 
place was not necessarily enough to tell

477
00:27:57,661 --> 00:27:58,494
people towards nihilism because there 
seemed to be people who weren't 

478
00:28:01,171 --> 00:28:04,020
nihilistic despite the fact that that 
seems self evident to him.

479
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:08,640
And he thought tolstoy actually turned 
to the Russian people.

480
00:28:08,641 --> 00:28:09,120
You know,
he,

481
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,580
he,
he was very entranced by the idea of the

482
00:28:11,581 --> 00:28:16,080
folk and folk wisdom.
And he turned to the Russian people as a

483
00:28:16,081 --> 00:28:16,914
source of new inspiration.
Like the peasantry and tolstoy actually 

484
00:28:19,951 --> 00:28:23,640
fought for the freedom of the peasantry 
and he felt that there are simple faith,

485
00:28:23,641 --> 00:28:24,474
so to speak,
was something truly admirable rather 

486
00:28:27,001 --> 00:28:31,380
than something pathetically pathetic and
weak from an intellectual perspective.

487
00:28:31,381 --> 00:28:36,300
He strove to emulate that.
That criticism lists faith,

488
00:28:36,301 --> 00:28:37,134
but of course he couldn't do it because 
once you've taken a bite out of the 

489
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:41,250
apple,
there's no going back,

490
00:28:41,251 --> 00:28:44,850
so to speak.
Need just says distress,

491
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:47,490
whether psychic,
physical or intellectual need not at all

492
00:28:47,491 --> 00:28:50,610
produced nihilism.
That is the radical rejection of value,

493
00:28:50,611 --> 00:28:51,444
meaning and desirability.
Such distress always permits a variety 

494
00:28:54,121 --> 00:28:54,954
of interpretations.
Rather it is one particular 

495
00:28:57,511 --> 00:28:59,160
interpretation.
The Christian world,

496
00:28:59,161 --> 00:28:59,994
one,
that nihilism is rooted the end of 

497
00:29:01,261 --> 00:29:05,280
Christianity at the hands of its own 
morality which cannot be replaced,

498
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,090
which turns against the Christian God.
The sense of truthfulness,

499
00:29:09,091 --> 00:29:09,924
highly developed by Christianity is 
nauseated by the falseness and 

500
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:13,674
mendacious snus of all Christian 
interpretations of the world and of 

501
00:29:16,711 --> 00:29:17,544
history.

502
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:22,680
It's a rebound from God is the truth to 
the equally fanatical faith.

503
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,800
All his false and active Buddhism 
skepticism regarding morality is what is

504
00:29:28,741 --> 00:29:29,574
decisive.
The end of the moral interpretation of 

505
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:32,994
the world,
which no longer has any sanction after 

506
00:29:34,771 --> 00:29:38,100
just tried to escape into some beyond 
leads to nihilism,

507
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,500
all lacks meaning well,
that's rooted niches,

508
00:29:41,501 --> 00:29:42,334
criticism of Christianity,
because he believed that Christianity 

509
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:45,244
was exceptionally morally flawed because
all it offered its followers was the 

510
00:29:48,581 --> 00:29:49,414
possibility of salvation and redemption 
from their suffering after they were 

511
00:29:54,221 --> 00:29:55,054
dead,
so it was projected into some other 

512
00:29:56,531 --> 00:29:59,170
world which as far as nature is 
concerned,

513
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,213
alleviated people have their local 
responsibility to try to improve things 

514
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:03,844
here and now and use comments about that
were essentially that it was the pro 

515
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,553
scientists recognition of the fact that 
the spiritual salvation that 

516
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,820
Christianity promised was no longer 
sufficient.

517
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,370
That motivated the development of 
science.

518
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:19,960
So for the,
for the,

519
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,823
for the early Christians,
this is part of the tension between 

520
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:26,020
Christianity and science.
For the early Christians,

521
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:29,980
the idea was that the earth in some 
sense was inner radical bleak,

522
00:30:29,981 --> 00:30:30,814
corrupt,
and that all you could hope for in your 

523
00:30:32,591 --> 00:30:35,170
earthly life was suffering and that you 
should.

524
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,273
You should accept your suffering and 
hope for salvation in the future after 

525
00:30:39,761 --> 00:30:41,380
you're dead.
Well,

526
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:42,963
obviously that philosophy seat appeared 
insufficient for people and Young's 

527
00:30:48,161 --> 00:30:48,994
hypothesis about the development of 
science was that a counter fantasy 

528
00:30:52,211 --> 00:30:54,520
developed in the unconscious of the 
Europeans,

529
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:55,354
which was that the material realm which 
had been defined as evil and therefor 

530
00:31:00,911 --> 00:31:01,744
not worthy of any study or any pursuit 
whatsoever actually held the seeds of 

531
00:31:05,351 --> 00:31:06,184
the redemption that was lacking,
and so that was young's commentary on 

532
00:31:09,731 --> 00:31:10,564
the idea of the philosopher stone 
because the alchemist who are who were 

533
00:31:13,161 --> 00:31:13,994
pro scientists were trying to trying to 
find a material substance that would be 

534
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:23,311
the philosopher's stone that would offer
it's holders wealth,

535
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,400
health and eternal life,
and so you think,

536
00:31:27,401 --> 00:31:29,380
well,
why are we pursuing science?

537
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,391
Well,
hopefully,

538
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:35,530
because we think it'll do some good here
and now right in our bodies,

539
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:40,830
and so you regarded science itself as 
stemming from that compensate story,

540
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,630
dream.
Brilliant idea.

541
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,183
It's actually the only idea I've ever 
read that that seems to do a reasonable 

542
00:31:48,761 --> 00:31:49,594
psychological account for the emergence 
of science as a discipline is a very 

543
00:31:53,651 --> 00:31:55,200
strange practice.
You know,

544
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,043
you have to.
You have to narrow your interests 

545
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,120
tremendously.
To be a scientist,

546
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:01,954
you have to focus on one set of 
phenomena you know that might appear as 

547
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:08,830
useless to contemplate is how many 
angels can dance on the head of a pin.

548
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:09,843
You have to devote decades to the study 
of that thing to make incremental 

549
00:32:12,701 --> 00:32:13,534
process or progress.
Why in the world would people ever be 

550
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:18,490
motivated to do that?
Well,

551
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,333
young interpretation was well.
There was a deep counter movement 

552
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,013
towards the over spiritualization of the
psyche and that was the revaluation of 

553
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:32,311
matter and its possibilities.
While Nisha believe that Christianity as

554
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:33,694
it,
as it stood at the end of the 18 

555
00:32:34,811 --> 00:32:35,644
hundreds,
was an untenable philosophy because he 

556
00:32:37,511 --> 00:32:42,511
thought it had abandoned moral 
obligations by escaping into some beyond

557
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:46,160
and therefore damned life as it was 
actually lived by human big.

558
00:32:46,161 --> 00:32:48,110
So he felt that the device was a good 
thing.

559
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,063
He he points out one other thing,
and this is the difference between 

560
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:58,130
having a theory and then learning to 
theorize.

561
00:32:58,131 --> 00:32:58,850
It says,
look,

562
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:02,270
if you've been raised in a tradition,
whatever that tradition happens to be,

563
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,373
you have a belief system.
Whatever that belief system happens to 

564
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:08,360
be and it falls apart on you at any one 
point,

565
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,673
you suffer for two reasons.
The first is your belief system fell 

566
00:33:13,011 --> 00:33:13,844
apart and that's not a good thing.
It leaves everything unfixed and open 

567
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:18,914
and you drown in possibility.
In a sense that's a character guardian 

568
00:33:21,171 --> 00:33:23,720
phrase,
but the second consequences,

569
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:24,554
even worse,
once you've learned that one belief 

570
00:33:26,211 --> 00:33:28,880
system that's solid could be demolished 
and fall apart,

571
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:29,923
then it's very difficult ever again,
to have any faith in any belief systems 

572
00:33:32,481 --> 00:33:33,314
whatsoever.
So not only do you become a doubter of 

573
00:33:35,901 --> 00:33:39,320
your own creed,
let's say you become a metadata which is

574
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:40,970
the doubter of all belief systems.

575
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:44,180
While in the step from that to nihilism,
maybe those are exactly the same thing.

576
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,320
You know,
and that's really,

577
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:46,483
you could think about that in some sense
as the disease of the critical rational 

578
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:50,444
mind.
It can saw off any branch that it's 

579
00:33:52,581 --> 00:33:53,414
sitting on and you know,
the utility of that is leave no stone 

580
00:33:57,011 --> 00:33:57,831
unturned,
right?

581
00:33:57,831 --> 00:33:58,664
You're supposed to question things and 
the utility of that is you learn new 

582
00:34:01,161 --> 00:34:01,994
things,
but the price you paid for it is that 

583
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,320
you're not necessarily ever certain 
about anything and you know,

584
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,051
you could say,
well,

585
00:34:09,051 --> 00:34:11,330
maybe you shouldn't be certain about 
anything,

586
00:34:11,331 --> 00:34:13,640
but you know you can forget that you 
know you're.

587
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:17,930
You're going to have to act as if you're
certain many times in your life for when

588
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:20,270
you choose a permanent mate for,
for example,

589
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:21,104
if you do that,
which you probably will because your 

590
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:26,030
university educated and university 
educated people still do that,

591
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,133
although no one else does so,
and you're going to pick a career and 

592
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,170
you're going to.
You're going to make decisions one after

593
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:36,530
the other about which if you're not 
certain you can't make,

594
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:40,790
in which case you have no life.
You're just a whirlwind of chaos.

595
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,133
So you're stuck with the necessity of 
following a course of action which is 

596
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:51,160
acted out certainty that your intellect 
can not regard as appropriate and that's

597
00:34:51,411 --> 00:34:52,244
hard on people.
Why should I choose this instead of 

598
00:34:54,741 --> 00:34:55,574
this?
Why should I act this way instead of 

599
00:34:57,861 --> 00:34:59,620
that way?
You know?

600
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,693
I don't know is not a very useful answer
when you're a creature that's is 

601
00:35:04,581 --> 00:35:09,581
cognitively able as we are.
This is a brilliant.

602
00:35:13,341 --> 00:35:15,770
This is an absolute.
This is something absolutely brilliant.

603
00:35:15,771 --> 00:35:18,230
It's very difficult for me to believe 
that it was written

604
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,143
so long ago.
So this is Dostoyevsky's criticism of 

605
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:26,334
communism.
Forty years before communism was a 

606
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,833
political force,
so Dostoevsky's thinking really hard 

607
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,850
about this nihilism problem.
By the way,

608
00:35:35,851 --> 00:35:39,060
nature read Dostoevsky extensively.
He's thinking about,

609
00:35:39,061 --> 00:35:39,894
he thinks,
well,

610
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,400
there seems to be two alternatives.
One is this superhuman nihilism,

611
00:35:44,401 --> 00:35:48,300
which is sort of a variant of what needs
you propose because nature proposed that

612
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,313
it would become the responsibility of 
every human being after the death of 

613
00:35:54,351 --> 00:35:57,470
their religious tradition to establish 
their own values.

614
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:02,360
Now you think that's it?
He didn't think people could do it.

615
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:03,194
He thought there'd have to be a new kind
of person who could manage it because 

616
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:06,913
you know he's basically asking you to 
generate a coherent and pragmatically 

617
00:36:11,781 --> 00:36:16,530
applicable philosophical structure out 
of nothing during your lifetime.

618
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,331
It's like,
well,

619
00:36:17,331 --> 00:36:18,880
good luck with that.
You know?

620
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:19,963
Plus,
he also assumed that people create 

621
00:36:21,351 --> 00:36:25,460
values or that they could create values 
and you know that's true to some degree,

622
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,533
and we'll talk about this more when we 
get into the phenomenal logical end of 

623
00:36:28,851 --> 00:36:30,710
things,
but it's not self evident,

624
00:36:30,711 --> 00:36:33,440
right?
Because one of the things you may notice

625
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,840
is that you can't force yourself to love
someone,

626
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,573
right?
You can't just decide that you're going 

627
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:39,560
to value someone.
Then poof,

628
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,240
that happens.
In fact,

629
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:42,523
you may want with all your heart as far 
or at least with all your mind to value 

630
00:36:45,561 --> 00:36:48,440
someone because they deserve it.
They've never mistreated you.

631
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:51,230
Maybe you've said you'd be loyal to them
and poof,

632
00:36:51,231 --> 00:36:52,064
someone comes along.
You're tremendously attracted to them 

633
00:36:53,541 --> 00:36:54,950
and off you go.
Like,

634
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,130
like someone who's possessed.
Well,

635
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,310
did you create that value?
It's like,

636
00:37:03,311 --> 00:37:05,320
well it didn't closer to your own 
experience.

637
00:37:05,321 --> 00:37:06,154
Like can you actually make yourself 
interested in something your board 

638
00:37:08,831 --> 00:37:11,710
about?
It's like good luck trying that,

639
00:37:11,711 --> 00:37:12,544
you know,
you'd rather clean up underneath your 

640
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:15,340
bed than read a paper you don't want to 
read.

641
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,410
You know,
when you can't just tell yourself,

642
00:37:17,411 --> 00:37:18,244
well,
I need to read this paper for the 

643
00:37:18,911 --> 00:37:20,590
following reasons,
and Poof,

644
00:37:20,591 --> 00:37:22,510
it becomes interesting.
It's like,

645
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:22,931
no,
no,

646
00:37:22,931 --> 00:37:24,820
no.
Your value systems,

647
00:37:24,821 --> 00:37:27,790
whatever they happen to be,
you're off doing their own thing and the

648
00:37:27,791 --> 00:37:28,624
reason for that in large part is because
they're possessed by ideas that you 

649
00:37:31,241 --> 00:37:32,074
don't know about that have these 
historical roots and that play you in 

650
00:37:35,561 --> 00:37:39,250
some sense like they play puppets and 
this stuff is no joke.

651
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,890
Okay,
so this is what Dostoevsky said way back

652
00:37:41,891 --> 00:37:44,430
in the late 18 hundreds.
This was in a book called a

653
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:50,610
notes from underground and it's about a 
man who's like hamlet in some sense.

654
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,490
He's a modern man.
He's,

655
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,343
he's a 20th century man really.
And his problem is he's hyper 

656
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,580
intelligent and he can't figure out what
the hell he should do with his life.

657
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:00,623
And it's really bothering him and it's 
worse than that because not only is it 

658
00:38:03,631 --> 00:38:06,930
really bothering him that he can't get 
his act together and act with any degree

659
00:38:06,931 --> 00:38:09,090
of,
of consistency and character,

660
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:10,943
but he knows that he can't do that.
And he tortures himself about his 

661
00:38:12,961 --> 00:38:15,930
weakness at the same time,
so he's a very neurotic character,

662
00:38:15,931 --> 00:38:18,630
but he's a sophisticated and intelligent
neurotic.

663
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,793
And so he's run through all the 
arguments that you might conjure up to 

664
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,830
sort of talk yourself out of being 
neurotic and suffering.

665
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,050
He has nothing but contempt for his own 
character.

666
00:38:28,051 --> 00:38:32,130
He thinks he's much weaker than people 
who can just act without thinking.

667
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,620
And he's,
he's in this pip,

668
00:38:34,621 --> 00:38:36,040
this horrible pit,
and it's a lot.

669
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:39,580
It's a wonderful thing to read.
It's quite blockly comical.

670
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:42,850
And it's a great philosophical and 
psychological study.

671
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,690
Anyways,
and one of the sections of this book,

672
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:51,691
niches or Dostoevsky's protagonist 
starts to talk about alternatives to his

673
00:38:52,571 --> 00:38:53,890
nihilistic,
hopelessness.

674
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,760
And he thinks about utopianism as a 
potential alternative.

675
00:38:57,761 --> 00:39:00,190
So what's the utopianism?
Well,

676
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,533
in some sense,
medieval Christianity promised people 

677
00:39:08,741 --> 00:39:09,574
redemption after they died,
while the Utopian creed does the same 

678
00:39:13,061 --> 00:39:15,940
thing,
except it promises it here and now.

679
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,540
So that's communism was a particular 
utopian.

680
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:22,660
Crete and fascism had the same element.
Although it was,

681
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:29,140
it was,
it was.

682
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:32,320
I don't know how to describe it.
It was less intellectually sophisticated

683
00:39:32,321 --> 00:39:34,900
than communism.
Communism is basically said,

684
00:39:34,901 --> 00:39:35,734
look,
if you guys just stop being selfish and 

685
00:39:37,691 --> 00:39:38,524
share,
we can transform the world into a place 

686
00:39:41,531 --> 00:39:42,364
where everyone will have enough of 
everything and everyone will be able to 

687
00:39:45,581 --> 00:39:49,810
do what they want to do and because of 
the natural goodness of people,

688
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,390
if,
if selfishness can be overcome,

689
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,970
that'll be the next best thing to a 
paradise.

690
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:58,660
It's like it was powerful.
It was a powerful idea for people.

691
00:39:58,661 --> 00:39:59,494
You know,
80 years of our history was spent 

692
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,680
assessing and battling out the validity 
of that idea and hundreds of millions of

693
00:40:08,681 --> 00:40:10,420
people died as a consequence of it.

694
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,350
And you can understand why it was so 
attractive.

695
00:40:14,351 --> 00:40:15,184
I mean,
still utopian ideologies are attractive 

696
00:40:17,491 --> 00:40:18,324
to people.
I mean,

697
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,313
it's,
it's hard to read radical Islam is 

698
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:23,370
anything other than a Utopian ideology.
You know,

699
00:40:23,371 --> 00:40:26,490
the idea is once you establish rigid 
sharia,

700
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,740
then poof,
you know,

701
00:40:28,741 --> 00:40:31,860
you've got the Kingdom of God on earth.
Well,

702
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,960
and part of the reason that the radical 
Muslims are fighting against the West is

703
00:40:36,961 --> 00:40:41,961
because they see what they're doing as a
counter position to western nihilism.

704
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:45,510
And it's partly because they don't want 
to fall into that,

705
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,131
you know,
we would say,

706
00:40:47,131 --> 00:40:48,720
well that's progress.
It's like,

707
00:40:48,721 --> 00:40:49,554
yeah,
it's progress by our standards and it 

708
00:40:53,311 --> 00:40:56,070
comes at a price.
And also we don't even understand how it

709
00:40:56,071 --> 00:40:56,904
was that we paid the price.
So the reason I'm telling you this is 

710
00:41:01,651 --> 00:41:02,484
because you don't want to be thinking 
for any time at all that these sorts of 

711
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:07,530
issues have disappeared or that they're 
not relevant.

712
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:11,610
They're relevant now.
The guy who's advising potent,

713
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:16,860
his name is Alexander do and he's no 
admirer of Western liberalism,

714
00:41:16,861 --> 00:41:19,110
he thinks about it as fundamentally 
nihilistic.

715
00:41:19,111 --> 00:41:19,944
He thinks that it's universal 
application would result in the 

716
00:41:22,951 --> 00:41:23,784
disillusion of all local culture and the
production of this sort of 

717
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,690
materialistic,
hyper individuality.

718
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,670
And he's an admirer of tradition,
you know,

719
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:37,610
and specifically Russian Orthodox 
tradition.

720
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,310
And he believes that the cult cultures,
India,

721
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,230
Russia,
and China in particular,

722
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,243
should develop their own local cultures.
Keep the West the hell out and act as a 

723
00:41:47,181 --> 00:41:49,370
counter position to nihilistic 
liberalism.

724
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,220
Now you know,
you can say what you want about that.

725
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:56,540
I think [inaudible] biggest problem is 
that,

726
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,143
you know,
he doesn't want that diverse ideas that 

727
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:04,760
characterize the west to bump up against
Russia and dissolve it,

728
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:05,983
but what he fails to understand is those
same ideas are going to emerge within 

729
00:42:08,871 --> 00:42:13,520
Russia anyways and if you know,
if you want to keep them away outside,

730
00:42:13,521 --> 00:42:14,354
you have to keep them away inside.
And the Soviets already tried that for 

731
00:42:17,331 --> 00:42:18,164
70 years with pretty dire results.
So I don't think he can get around the 

732
00:42:21,591 --> 00:42:23,420
problem merely by,
you know,

733
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,700
putting up walls,
but,

734
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,600
but he's going to try and that's what 
Putin is doing.

735
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,730
So these ideas haven't disappeared at 
all.

736
00:42:32,731 --> 00:42:35,610
Like they're there.
They underlie all of the great conflicts

737
00:42:35,611 --> 00:42:38,700
that characterize the modern age.
Now,

738
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:42,990
Dostoevsky criticized utopianism and 
it's brilliant his,

739
00:42:42,991 --> 00:42:46,920
his formulation.
So I'm going to read it to you in short.

740
00:42:46,921 --> 00:42:49,260
One may say anything about the history 
of the world,

741
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:53,640
anything that might enter the most 
disordered imagination.

742
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:57,210
The only thing one can't say is that 
it's rational.

743
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:02,630
The very word sticks in one's throat.
And indeed this is the odd thing that is

744
00:43:02,641 --> 00:43:03,474
continually happening.
There are continually turning up in 

745
00:43:05,461 --> 00:43:07,560
life,
moral and rational persons,

746
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:08,483
sages and lovers of humanity who may get
their object to live all their lives as 

747
00:43:12,781 --> 00:43:15,600
morally and rationally as possible,
to be so,

748
00:43:15,601 --> 00:43:16,434
to speak,
a light to their neighbors simply in 

749
00:43:18,391 --> 00:43:19,224
order to show them that it is possible 
to live morally and rationally in this 

750
00:43:21,871 --> 00:43:22,704
world,
and yet we all know that these very 

751
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:27,750
people sooner or later have been false 
to themselves playing some queer trick,

752
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:29,850
often most unseemly one.

753
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:35,660
Now I asked you what can be expected of 
man,

754
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:38,960
since he is a being endowed with such 
strange qualities,

755
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,140
shower upon him,
every earthly blessing,

756
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:47,240
drowning in a sea of happiness so that 
nothing but bubbles of bliss can be seen

757
00:43:47,241 --> 00:43:49,520
on the surface.
Give them economic prosperity,

758
00:43:49,521 --> 00:43:51,770
such that he should have nothing else to
do,

759
00:43:51,771 --> 00:43:52,604
but sleep,
eat cakes and busy himself with the 

760
00:43:55,551 --> 00:43:59,720
continuation of his species and even 
then out of sheer and gratitude,

761
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,740
sheer spite,
man would play you some nasty trick.

762
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,753
He would even.
Risk is cakes and with deliberately 

763
00:44:06,891 --> 00:44:10,970
desire the most fatal rubbish,
the most uneconomical absurdity,

764
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,970
simply to introduce into all this 
positive,

765
00:44:13,971 --> 00:44:15,740
good sense,
his fatal,

766
00:44:15,741 --> 00:44:20,150
fantastic element.
It's just as fantastic dreams is vulgar,

767
00:44:20,151 --> 00:44:20,984
folly that he will desire to retain 
simply in order to prove to himself as 

768
00:44:24,951 --> 00:44:25,784
though that were so necessary that men 
still are men and not the keys of a 

769
00:44:29,811 --> 00:44:30,644
piano,
which the laws of nature threatened to 

770
00:44:32,401 --> 00:44:33,234
control completely so completely that 
one will be able to desire nothing but 

771
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:37,524
by the calendar,
so clearly that's Dostoyevsky's 

772
00:44:40,951 --> 00:44:44,220
criticism of materialistic determinism,
right,

773
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,640
which he felt as a spiritual threat.
Fundamentally,

774
00:44:47,641 --> 00:44:51,180
it's proposition being that animals and 
human beings,

775
00:44:51,181 --> 00:44:52,014
we're deterministic machines.
It's a Newtonian worldview and that 

776
00:44:54,931 --> 00:44:55,764
because of that,
everything could be calculated and 

777
00:44:56,941 --> 00:45:00,720
planned ahead of time because it could 
be predicted and measured,

778
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:04,313
and that is not all.
Even if men really were nothing but a 

779
00:45:06,421 --> 00:45:07,254
piano key.
Even if this were proved to him by 

780
00:45:09,361 --> 00:45:12,780
natural science and mathematics,
even then he would not become reasonable

781
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:14,093
but would purposely do something 
perverse out of simple in gratitude 

782
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:18,203
simply to gain his point.
And if he does not find means he will 

783
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:24,810
contrive destruction and chaos,
sufferings of all sorts,

784
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,673
only to gain his point.
He'll launch a curse upon the world and 

785
00:45:29,581 --> 00:45:30,414
as the only man can curse.
It's this privilege and the primary 

786
00:45:33,661 --> 00:45:35,490
distinction between him and other 
animals,

787
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:36,713
maybe by his curse alone he will attain 
is object and convinced himself that 

788
00:45:39,631 --> 00:45:40,464
he's a man and not a piano key.
If you say that all this too can be 

789
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:45,293
calculated and tabulated chaos and 
darkness and curses so that the mere 

790
00:45:48,721 --> 00:45:51,990
possibility of calculating it all 
beforehand would stop.

791
00:45:51,991 --> 00:45:56,820
It all and reason would reassert itself.
That man would purposely go mad in order

792
00:45:56,821 --> 00:45:59,850
to be rid of reason and gain his point.
I believe in it.

793
00:45:59,851 --> 00:46:00,684
I answer for it.
For the whole work of man really seems 

794
00:46:02,281 --> 00:46:06,840
to consist of nothing but proving to 
himself every minute that he's a man and

795
00:46:06,841 --> 00:46:10,230
not a piano key.
It may be at the cost of his skin,

796
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:12,660
it might be by cannibalism

797
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:15,343
and this being sold.
Can one help being tempted to rejoice 

798
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:18,944
that it has not yet come off and the 
desire still depends on something we 

799
00:46:21,681 --> 00:46:26,681
don't know you will scream at me.
That is if you condescend to do so,

800
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,273
that no one's touching my freewill,
that all they're concerned with is that 

801
00:46:30,981 --> 00:46:35,600
my will should have,
should have itself of its own freewill,

802
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:40,040
coincide with my own normal interests,
with the laws of nature and arithmetic.

803
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:42,200
Good Evans.
Gentlemen,

804
00:46:42,201 --> 00:46:43,034
what sort of free will is left when we 
come to tabulation and arithmetic when 

805
00:46:46,101 --> 00:46:48,920
it will all be a case of twice two,
makes four,

806
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,233
twice.
Two makes four without my will as a 

807
00:46:53,181 --> 00:46:58,181
freewill meant that.
So what's his point?

808
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:02,660
Well,
it's sort of a garden of eden point.

809
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:06,930
You know,
what are people like magine?

810
00:47:06,931 --> 00:47:09,150
You could reconstruct a paradise on 
earth.

811
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,010
You know,
hypothetically,

812
00:47:11,011 --> 00:47:11,844
that's what everyone wants.
We could go live in the paradise and 

813
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,290
that would be the end of the problem 
we'd all live happily ever after.

814
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:21,291
But in the original paradise story,
that's what people were provided with.

815
00:47:21,541 --> 00:47:22,374
And the first thing they did when they 
were put there was to do the one thing 

816
00:47:24,901 --> 00:47:25,734
that they were told not to do that would
bring it all crashing down and that was 

817
00:47:28,291 --> 00:47:29,124
immediately what they did.
And so Dostoevsky story's actually a 

818
00:47:32,171 --> 00:47:33,004
retelling of that idea.
The idea was that that people aren't 

819
00:47:35,771 --> 00:47:39,760
like the utopians think,
we don't want it easy,

820
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,970
we don't want it comfortable,
we don't want to good.

821
00:47:42,971 --> 00:47:46,260
And the reason for that is we'd be bored
stiff and so the defendant,

822
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:47,103
nobody ever did put us in the kind of 
nursery that would require us never to 

823
00:47:50,771 --> 00:47:54,160
exert any effort to do anything at all 
whatsoever ever again.

824
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:57,430
Even if it meant going insane,
we destroy it.

825
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:00,070
And then he takes that further.
He says.

826
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:01,960
And that's a good thing.

827
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:04,943
Kierkegaard writing earlier about 40 
years earlier said something quite 

828
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:09,024
similar.

829
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,730
It is now about four years ago that I 
got the notion of wanting to try my luck

830
00:48:13,731 --> 00:48:16,070
as an author.
I remember it quite clearly.

831
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,960
It was on a Sunday.
Yes,

832
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:19,790
that's it.
A Sunday afternoon.

833
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:23,990
I was seated as usual out of doors at 
the cafe in the Fredericksburg Garden.

834
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,890
I had been a student for half a score of
years,

835
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:29,923
although never lazy.
All my activity nevertheless was like a 

836
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,344
glittering inactivity,
a kind of occupation for which I still 

837
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:39,980
have a great partiality and for which 
perhaps are even have a little genius.

838
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:41,443
I read much spent the remainder of the 
day idling and thinking or thinking an 

839
00:48:45,411 --> 00:48:47,210
idling,
but that was all it came to.

840
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:48,513
So there I sat and smoke my cigar until 
I lapsed into thought among other 

841
00:48:52,491 --> 00:48:55,550
thoughts.
I remember these you are going on.

842
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:56,773
I said to myself to become an old man 
without being anything and really 

843
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:03,200
without undertaking to do anything.

844
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:04,843
On the other hand,
wherever you look about you and 

845
00:49:06,021 --> 00:49:06,854
literature and in life,
you see the celebrated names and 

846
00:49:08,421 --> 00:49:09,254
figures,
the precious and much heralded men who 

847
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:14,210
were coming into prominence and are much
talked about,

848
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:15,523
the many benefactors of the age who knew
how to benefit mankind by making life 

849
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:20,530
easier and easier.
Some by railways,

850
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:24,200
others by omnibuses and steamboats,
others by the telegraph,

851
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:25,573
others by easily apprehended compendiums
and short recitals of everything worth 

852
00:49:28,641 --> 00:49:29,474
knowing
and finding the true benefactors of the 

853
00:49:32,151 --> 00:49:36,170
age who makes spiritual existence in 
virtue of thought easier and easier,

854
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:40,910
yet more and more significant,
and what are you doing here?

855
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:42,470
My soliloquy was interrupted

856
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:49,130
for a cigar with smoked out and a new 
one had to be lit so I smoked again,

857
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:52,100
and then suddenly this thought flashed 
through my mind,

858
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:54,283
you must do something,
but in as much as with your limited 

859
00:49:56,961 --> 00:49:57,794
capacities,
it will be impossible to make anything 

860
00:49:59,151 --> 00:49:59,984
easier than it has become.
You must with the same humanitarian 

861
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:07,520
enthusiasm as the others undertake to 
make something harder.

862
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:11,000
This notion pleased me immensely and at 
the same time,

863
00:50:11,001 --> 00:50:11,834
it flattered me to think that I liked 
the rest of them would be loved in the 

864
00:50:14,551 --> 00:50:15,384
steam by the whole community,
for when all combined in every way to 

865
00:50:18,471 --> 00:50:22,580
make everything easier,
there remains only one possible danger,

866
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:27,680
namely that the eas becomes so great 
that it becomes all together.

867
00:50:27,681 --> 00:50:28,514
Two,
great.

868
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:31,790
Then there's only one want left though 
it is not yet felt want,

869
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:32,953
when people will want difficulty out of 
love for mankind and out of despair at 

870
00:50:37,551 --> 00:50:38,384
my embarrassing situation,
seeing that I had accomplished nothing 

871
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:41,863
and was unable to make anything easier 
than it has already been made and moved 

872
00:50:44,991 --> 00:50:47,390
by a genuine interest in those who make 
everything easy.

873
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:52,400
I can save it as my task to create 
difficulties everywhere.

874
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,740
Now,
one of the things you might ask yourself

875
00:50:56,741 --> 00:50:57,574
is

876
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,870
sometimes you come to university and 
people talk about happiness.

877
00:51:03,871 --> 00:51:05,940
For example,
you talk about positive psychology.

878
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:08,303
I'm not a fan of positive psychology by 
the way because happiness is basically 

879
00:51:11,641 --> 00:51:15,540
extroversion minus neuroticism,
and we knew that 15 years ago,

880
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:18,090
so we didn't need to make a lot of noise
about it.

881
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:23,700
So anyways,
one of the things you might ask yourself

882
00:51:23,701 --> 00:51:24,240
is,
well,

883
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,073
why did you come to university?
Did you actually come to university to 

884
00:51:27,091 --> 00:51:30,370
make yourself happier?
Well,

885
00:51:30,371 --> 00:51:35,371
let's think about that for a minute.
Here's one thing to think about.

886
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:41,680
We know if that if you put animals in a 
relatively boring situation like rats in

887
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:44,620
a boarding situation and you give them 
free access to cocaine,

888
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:48,460
they'll just take cocaine until they're 
dead basically.

889
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,980
Now it wraps in the normal environment.
Won't do that,

890
00:51:50,981 --> 00:51:51,814
but board rats that are sort of isolated
cocaine's really an excellent thing as 

891
00:51:54,971 --> 00:51:56,500
far as they're concerned.
They'll ignore sex.

892
00:51:56,501 --> 00:51:57,334
They'll ignore food.
I think they'll still drink water if I 

893
00:51:59,681 --> 00:52:00,514
remember correctly,
but it's cocaine all the way and if you 

894
00:52:03,191 --> 00:52:05,800
could inject an electrode into their 
minds,

895
00:52:05,801 --> 00:52:07,600
their brains,
which people have done,

896
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:11,590
you can inject the electrode down into 
the hypothalamus,

897
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,920
into the part that's associated with the
reward centers.

898
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:16,593
It's the source of the dopaminergic 
tracts and you can set them up so that 

899
00:52:19,841 --> 00:52:20,674
if the rat pushes a button,
they get a little jolt of of happiness 

900
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:27,310
basically in the rattle.
Sit there and push that happiness button

901
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:29,553
in a rather frantic way as if it's 
looking for something else in some 

902
00:52:32,531 --> 00:52:34,750
sense,
but it will certainly do it just because

903
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:37,390
it's a peculiar kind of reward.
Now the question might be,

904
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:40,150
would you allow yourself to be wired up 
like that?

905
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:43,773
Now you might think there might be some 
times in your life where you think that 

906
00:52:45,641 --> 00:52:47,920
might just be a perfectly fine idea,
but most of you,

907
00:52:47,921 --> 00:52:51,550
I suppose I pursue,
wouldn't do that for a second,

908
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:55,840
for the same reasons perhaps that you 
don't avail yourself of unlimited access

909
00:52:55,841 --> 00:52:56,674
to cocaine,
which is a very a stimulant that's very 

910
00:52:58,811 --> 00:52:59,644
good at producing positive emotion.
It's a powerful psychomotor stimulants 

911
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:03,933
and so it affects the parts of your 
brain that are active when you're doing 

912
00:53:06,881 --> 00:53:09,190
something that you think is worthwhile 
and productive,

913
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:10,413
so why not just do that all the time?
That's the question that Elvis Huxley's 

914
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:16,270
brave new world.
Got Everything you want.

915
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:19,690
Take a drug to keep you calm and happy,
poof.

916
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:20,583
Perfect.

917
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:22,830
Well,
is that what you want?

918
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:26,250
And if the answer is no,
then you might ask yourself,

919
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:29,670
what the hell do you want?
Now,

920
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:34,880
one of the things I've thought a lot 
about lately is lately being 10 years,

921
00:53:35,221 --> 00:53:38,430
I suppose is there are these statutes 
that I've seen,

922
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,990
I've looked at pictures of them online,
there,

923
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,690
statues of Atlas,
you know,

924
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,533
an atlas is this God who has the world 
on his shoulders and that's his destiny 

925
00:53:46,471 --> 00:53:49,260
or is cursed,
is to have the world on his shoulders.

926
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,580
And he might say,
well,

927
00:53:50,581 --> 00:53:51,450
you know,
poor atlas,

928
00:53:51,451 --> 00:53:54,000
maybe just put the damn world down and 
you know,

929
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:56,400
go out for a beer or something,
but,

930
00:53:57,510 --> 00:54:00,330
but then you might also think,
well,

931
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,180
what is that figure trying to.
What is that?

932
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:06,330
That idea of trying to indicate because 
it's an old idea.

933
00:54:06,331 --> 00:54:07,164
It's a profound idea.
There's something divine about a figure 

934
00:54:10,111 --> 00:54:11,580
with the world on his shoulders.

935
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,630
Well,
I might say the real.

936
00:54:13,631 --> 00:54:15,810
That's the reason you're in university.
Whether you know it or not.

937
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:17,843
You're here to take the world on your 
shoulders because that's a sufficiently 

938
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:22,493
profound and worthwhile exercise so that
all the suffering that you're going to 

939
00:54:26,671 --> 00:54:27,504
have might be regarded as worthwhile 
because the value of what you're doing 

940
00:54:32,251 --> 00:54:34,350
is so high.
Because that's what you might ask,

941
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:39,380
is there something that you could do 
whose value is so high that the fact for

942
00:54:40,291 --> 00:54:41,124
the existentialists existentialists,
it's a fact that you're mortal and 

943
00:54:45,301 --> 00:54:50,301
vulnerable and prone to suffering 
inescapably that you would find that not

944
00:54:50,911 --> 00:54:53,280
only acceptable but desirable.
You'd say,

945
00:54:53,281 --> 00:54:55,170
I'll pay that.
I paid that price.

946
00:54:56,250 --> 00:54:57,780
Well,
that's an existential question.

947
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,153
You might say.
That's the existential question and one 

948
00:55:01,891 --> 00:55:04,200
of the things that's very interesting 
about that question is,

949
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:07,513
I'm going to talk about this a lot.
Next class is what happens if you make 

950
00:55:09,841 --> 00:55:14,150
the opposite choice?
Well,

951
00:55:14,151 --> 00:55:14,984
I think the 20th century actually showed
us what happened when people made the 

952
00:55:17,301 --> 00:55:20,900
opposite choice because as far as I can 
tell,

953
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:26,230
when people abandoned their
divine responsibility,

954
00:55:26,751 --> 00:55:27,584
let's say
to the Utopian claims of a totalitarian 

955
00:55:31,881 --> 00:55:32,714
state or too hopeless nihilism,
the consequences on the one hand with 

956
00:55:37,311 --> 00:55:38,144
nihilism was despair and illness and the
consequence on the totalitarian end of 

957
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:46,940
things.
The Utopian end was that while you might

958
00:55:46,941 --> 00:55:47,774
not die,
but you're certainly going to have a 

959
00:55:48,621 --> 00:55:51,080
hand in making sure that a lot of other 
people do,

960
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:57,820
and so
I suppose it to some degree,

961
00:55:59,341 --> 00:56:04,341
it depends on what you want for proof,
no proof with regards to what you should

962
00:56:04,381 --> 00:56:05,214
do.
Now the conclusion I've drawn from all 

963
00:56:07,771 --> 00:56:10,320
this from reading the existentialist is 
that

964
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,033
if it's the pointless suffering of 
humanity and the inability to extract 

965
00:56:18,481 --> 00:56:19,314
meaning from that,
that makes you a nihilist and that 

966
00:56:20,971 --> 00:56:24,190
justifies it.
Let's say you're making a claim,

967
00:56:24,191 --> 00:56:25,240
right?
The claim is

968
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:31,020
the implicit claim is that suffering is 
bad and should be halted.

969
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:31,973
It's something like that and so maybe 
you'll do that by becoming suicidal or 

970
00:56:34,861 --> 00:56:38,310
maybe you do that by becoming ultimately
genocidal,

971
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:42,000
which is also an option that's open to 
more than a few people,

972
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:45,840
but there's a logical inconsistency in 
that as far as I can tell,

973
00:56:45,841 --> 00:56:46,674
which is that
your initial presupposition is that 

974
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,930
suffering is actually bad.
It should be mitigated.

975
00:56:52,931 --> 00:56:55,120
It should be.
It should be reduced.

976
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:57,390
It should perhaps even be eliminated.
Well,

977
00:56:57,550 --> 00:56:58,383
if you pick up the cloak of nihilism or 
maybe you pick up the cloak of 

978
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:01,873
ideological totalitarianism,
then we know what the consequence of 

979
00:57:05,351 --> 00:57:06,184
that is,
the consequences that everything that's 

980
00:57:08,321 --> 00:57:12,760
already really bad becomes so much more 
worse that it's almost unimaginable

981
00:57:14,610 --> 00:57:19,350
and so even by the standards of the 
gnarliest who says that the suffering of

982
00:57:19,351 --> 00:57:24,351
being should result in its elimination,
the consequences of thinking that way or

983
00:57:26,971 --> 00:57:27,804
a flipping to the other side and 
adopting some sort of defensive 

984
00:57:29,881 --> 00:57:30,714
videology is that things go from being 
merely the sort of bad state of the 

985
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:36,503
earth as it is now to something as 
hellish as the Soviet gulags are the 

986
00:57:39,961 --> 00:57:40,794
Russian concentration camps or miles.
Great experiment in the Cultural 

987
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:48,210
Revolution which probably killed 100 
million people know about,

988
00:57:48,211 --> 00:57:52,640
which we generally hear nothing.
No.

989
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:53,483
You know,
one of the things the existentialists 

990
00:57:54,411 --> 00:57:55,244
would say is
what's the relationship between mental 

991
00:57:59,541 --> 00:58:03,350
health and responsibility?
And that.

992
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:04,203
That's a good question because it also 
has to do something with something like 

993
00:58:07,101 --> 00:58:09,710
the definition of mental health and 
responsibility.

994
00:58:09,711 --> 00:58:10,544
It's like

995
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:17,530
if you want your life to be well 
constituted,

996
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:20,440
let's say whatever that means,
and it doesn't mean being happy,

997
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:24,180
they see the reason it can mean being 
happiest.

998
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:25,023
There's gonna be times in your life 
where you're going to be called on to 

999
00:58:26,621 --> 00:58:30,580
act when you're not happy.
So for example,

1000
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:34,330
when one of your parents dies,
you're going to make a choice.

1001
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,790
You're not going to be happy.
That will not be,

1002
00:58:36,791 --> 00:58:38,770
oh well,
hopefully you won't be otherwise.

1003
00:58:38,771 --> 00:58:40,840
You're tangled in some sort of Freud a 
nightmare,

1004
00:58:40,841 --> 00:58:42,550
but let's assume that that's not the 
case.

1005
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:43,563
You're not going to be happy about it.
You're going to be hurt and maybe even 

1006
00:58:46,451 --> 00:58:47,284
partly broken.
So what the hell are you supposed to do 

1007
00:58:49,031 --> 00:58:49,864
then?

1008
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:51,703
Well,
the answer is you should be more use 

1009
00:58:52,791 --> 00:58:55,790
than trouble under some certain under 
such circumstances,

1010
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:57,740
and that's a good thing to strive for.
You know,

1011
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,870
because your mother is going to be.
If it's your father,

1012
00:58:59,871 --> 00:59:01,740
your mother is going to be equally 
distraught and sore,

1013
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:04,190
your siblings and everyone else you care
for.

1014
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,233
Maybe by that time you should be tough 
enough so that in that situation you're 

1015
00:59:08,031 --> 00:59:08,864
good for something.
Someone has to make the damn funeral 

1016
00:59:10,941 --> 00:59:13,880
arrangements.
Someone has to settle out the will.

1017
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:14,923
Someone has to make sure the family 
doesn't degenerate into horrific 

1018
00:59:18,081 --> 00:59:18,914
squabbling,
which is something that often happens 

1019
00:59:20,211 --> 00:59:21,044
after the death of a
and you're not going to be motivated to 

1020
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:27,530
do that by happiness and what if you 
have a sick child when you're.

1021
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:31,040
When you're a parent,
maybe it's a chronic illness.

1022
00:59:31,041 --> 00:59:32,780
You are not going to be happy about 
that.

1023
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:34,003
You know,
it'll be a weight that you carry with 

1024
00:59:35,241 --> 00:59:37,660
you all the time and it's.
It's,

1025
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:40,520
it's one of those things that seems 
particularly unjust.

1026
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:41,601
It's like,
okay,

1027
00:59:41,601 --> 00:59:45,860
well you're no longer happy with being 
happy is the purpose of life.

1028
00:59:45,861 --> 00:59:48,230
Well then you're basically.
That's pretty much it for you,

1029
00:59:48,231 --> 00:59:52,670
isn't it?
And you know these catastrophes that I'm

1030
00:59:52,671 --> 00:59:54,290
speaking of,
you can.

1031
00:59:54,610 --> 00:59:55,443
You can be certain that you're going to 
be exposed to many of those during your 

1032
00:59:59,031 --> 01:00:00,620
life.
You know,

1033
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:01,573
it'll be a rare period.
I think it's a rare period in anyone's 

1034
01:00:03,861 --> 01:00:08,630
life where one or more of such things 
isn't going on chronically.

1035
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:09,573
If it's not you with some terrible 
health problem or some other terrible 

1036
01:00:12,561 --> 01:00:13,394
problem,
then it's a parent or a sibling or a 

1037
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:16,064
child or because you know you're 
connected to other people and they're 

1038
01:00:18,291 --> 01:00:21,980
vulnerable to.
So that's the law of human beings and so

1039
01:00:21,981 --> 01:00:24,770
if it's happiness,
and this is what Solzhenitsyn said about

1040
01:00:24,771 --> 01:00:25,604
happiness to it's said happiness is a 
philosophy who's brought to ruin by the 

1041
01:00:30,771 --> 01:00:33,770
first blow of a guard's truncheon.
It's like,

1042
01:00:33,771 --> 01:00:34,730
yeah,
that's.

1043
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:37,520
That's about as bluntly as you can put 
it.

1044
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:47,923
Here's another.

1045
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:53,193
I have time to read both of these.
I think this is from character guard as 

1046
01:00:55,211 --> 01:00:59,990
well.
Kierkegaard,

1047
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:00,863
by the way,
was really the first thinker who 

1048
01:01:01,711 --> 01:01:05,430
identified what we would describe in 
modern terms as anxiety,

1049
01:01:05,431 --> 01:01:09,120
especially as existential existential 
anxiety or anxious,

1050
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:10,583
you know,
when it would be associated with the 

1051
01:01:11,851 --> 01:01:14,520
condition of questioning the nature of 
existence,

1052
01:01:14,521 --> 01:01:15,354
the utility of existence,
and so kierkegaard was really the first 

1053
01:01:17,611 --> 01:01:19,550
person who formalized that into 
something

1054
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:25,660
resembling a philosophy or a psychology,
and then he was trying to think of how,

1055
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:28,650
how that might be overcome given that it
seemed to be rooted,

1056
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:29,484
in fact,
in factual observation that that's the 

1057
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:36,321
observation of suffering
and this is a corollary to Dostoyevsky's

1058
01:01:36,591 --> 01:01:39,670
comments.
Even though character guards,

1059
01:01:39,671 --> 01:01:41,320
comments were written decades earlier.

1060
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:47,900
Dostoyevsky's critique basically said 
you can't solve the problem of suffering

1061
01:01:49,321 --> 01:01:54,321
by formalizing a utopia and then joining
it like a mass animal.

1062
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:56,700
You can't do that because you're not 
that kind of creature.

1063
01:01:56,940 --> 01:01:59,400
Even if it was possible,
you wouldn't accept it.

1064
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:02,010
You'd cause trouble because you're 
interested in trouble.

1065
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:05,760
You're probably more interested in,
in trouble than you are and being happy.

1066
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:08,280
So I mean,
you know,

1067
01:02:08,281 --> 01:02:11,760
people like that,
that's another marker often have serious

1068
01:02:11,761 --> 01:02:13,060
personality disorder,
right?

1069
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:13,933
I have clients have many of them who are
way more interested in causing trouble 

1070
01:02:18,541 --> 01:02:22,590
in some way than they are and being 
boring and stable.

1071
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:24,143
They'll take any form of suffering and 
inflict any form of suffering on any 

1072
01:02:26,881 --> 01:02:27,714
number of people they can possibly get 
their hooks into in order to merely to 

1073
01:02:30,451 --> 01:02:31,850
escape,
you know,

1074
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:34,580
drab and secure normality.
You know,

1075
01:02:34,581 --> 01:02:39,060
you call those people dramatic,
overly dramatic.

1076
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:43,830
That's one way of looking at it and they
make as far as I can tell,

1077
01:02:43,831 --> 01:02:48,831
a relatively conscious choice.
Trouble is more interesting than safety.

1078
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:56,400
Character Guard says something similar,
but in a,

1079
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:59,590
in a more,
in a more pop,

1080
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:00,563
in a morph,
what would you say in a manner that's 

1081
01:03:02,971 --> 01:03:03,804
more constructive in some sense with 
regards to what you should do with all 

1082
01:03:06,871 --> 01:03:07,704
that in St Energy,
that you're not going to be able to 

1083
01:03:08,971 --> 01:03:13,971
encapsulate inside a utopia and it has 
to do with individual responsibility.

1084
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:19,410
There is a view of life which conceives 
that where the crowd is,

1085
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,040
there is also the truth and that in 
truth itself,

1086
01:03:23,041 --> 01:03:25,050
there is need of having the crowd on its
side.

1087
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:26,213
I was on a panel at one point about,
I think we were discussing gender 

1088
01:03:30,241 --> 01:03:31,074
differences between obviously between 
men and women and there are lots of 

1089
01:03:35,461 --> 01:03:37,740
people,
the social constructionist in particular

1090
01:03:37,741 --> 01:03:38,574
who think that all of the differences,
there's biological sex and then there's 

1091
01:03:41,041 --> 01:03:41,874
gender and gender is socially 
constructed and that all gender 

1092
01:03:45,211 --> 01:03:46,044
differences are socially constructed and
there's no biological differences in 

1093
01:03:48,901 --> 01:03:50,670
gender between the two sexes.

1094
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:54,180
Now virtually no evidence supports that 
proposition.

1095
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:57,240
If you look at the hardcore 
psychological evidence,

1096
01:03:57,241 --> 01:03:58,074
in fact,
it's completely the opposite and not 

1097
01:03:59,071 --> 01:04:02,490
only that,
as you make societies more egalitarian,

1098
01:04:02,850 --> 01:04:05,850
men and women get more different instead
of more of the same.

1099
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:07,343
Now the reason that happens is because 
once the iron out the environmental 

1100
01:04:10,531 --> 01:04:12,990
variability,
by equalizing everything,

1101
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:14,033
all that's left is genetic vulnerable 
variability and so it springs to the 

1102
01:04:17,191 --> 01:04:21,300
forefront and so the biggest gender 
differences in the world are between men

1103
01:04:21,301 --> 01:04:25,350
and women in Scandinavia and those are 
partly personality differences.

1104
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,950
Women are higher in negative emotion and
more agreeable among other things,

1105
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:30,053
but more particularly,
the differences seem to be a those of 

1106
01:04:33,121 --> 01:04:33,954
interest.
So the biggest differences between men 

1107
01:04:36,691 --> 01:04:39,780
and women seem to be in what they're 
interested in and roughly speaking,

1108
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,390
women are more interested in people and 
roughly speaking,

1109
01:04:42,391 --> 01:04:43,800
men are more interested in things.

1110
01:04:43,950 --> 01:04:48,180
And so in Scandinavia for example,
you have a 20 to one proportion of women

1111
01:04:48,181 --> 01:04:49,014
to men in nursing and at 21 to one 
proportion of men to women in 

1112
01:04:52,561 --> 01:04:53,394
engineering and so and you know the 
Scandinavian governments now and then 

1113
01:04:56,971 --> 01:04:57,804
try to move that.
So there's more male nurses and more 

1114
01:04:59,581 --> 01:05:02,760
female engineers and if they really push
they can move.

1115
01:05:02,761 --> 01:05:03,594
The ratio is somewhat for a few years.
But as soon as they relax they snap 

1116
01:05:06,541 --> 01:05:09,930
right back to 20 to one.
So anyways,

1117
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:11,783
I was saving some of these studies and 
one of the people that I was discussing 

1118
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:15,623
said,
well what are we supposed to do with 

1119
01:05:18,701 --> 01:05:20,110
that?
And I said,

1120
01:05:20,111 --> 01:05:21,040
well,
I don't know what you mean.

1121
01:05:21,041 --> 01:05:23,830
Those are,
those are scientific findings said,

1122
01:05:23,831 --> 01:05:24,664
yeah,
but truth has to be established by 

1123
01:05:25,841 --> 01:05:28,540
consensus.
And I thought,

1124
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:29,553
I don't want to live in whatever world 
you're going to end up ruling because 

1125
01:05:32,591 --> 01:05:33,424
truth is not merely established by 
consensus or if you think it does and 

1126
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:37,333
you think it is,
then while you're in the position that 

1127
01:05:38,861 --> 01:05:39,694
character guard describes,
which is that as long as everyone else 

1128
01:05:42,551 --> 01:05:44,740
believes that the appropriate thing is 
for you to believe it.

1129
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:45,573
And also that's the truth.
It's like it's a pretty damn dismal 

1130
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:52,570
philosophy and it gets people into 
tremendous trouble because no matter how

1131
01:05:52,571 --> 01:05:54,670
many people think there isn't a wall 
there,

1132
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:58,240
anyone who runs out it had first is in 
for a vicious surprise.

1133
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:00,333
There's a view of life which conceives 
that where the crowd is there is also 

1134
01:06:02,321 --> 01:06:05,590
the truth and in that truth,
it's an in truth itself.

1135
01:06:05,591 --> 01:06:07,480
There is need of having the crowd on its
side.

1136
01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:09,670
There's another view of life which 
conceives that.

1137
01:06:09,671 --> 01:06:12,250
Wherever there is a crowd,
there is untruth

1138
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:18,310
so that to consider for a moment the 
extreme case,

1139
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:23,020
even if every individual each for 
himself in private,

1140
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:24,363
we're to be in possession of the truth.
Yet in case they're all to get together 

1141
01:06:28,271 --> 01:06:29,104
in a crowd,
a crowd to which any sort of decisive 

1142
01:06:30,941 --> 01:06:33,580
significance as attributed,
avoiding voting,

1143
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:34,563
noisy,
audible crowd untruth would immediately 

1144
01:06:36,641 --> 01:06:37,540
be in evidence

1145
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:41,093
for crowd is untruth in a godly sense.
It is true eternally Christianly as St 

1146
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:47,753
Paul says,
that only one attains the goal which is 

1147
01:06:49,381 --> 01:06:53,370
not meant in a comparative sense for 
comparison takes others into account.

1148
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:57,810
It means that every individual can be 
that one God helping him there in,

1149
01:06:57,811 --> 01:06:58,644
but only one attains the goal and again,
this means that every man should be 

1150
01:07:01,831 --> 01:07:02,664
careful about having to do with the 
others and essentially should only talk 

1151
01:07:06,271 --> 01:07:09,330
with God in himself,
for only one attains the goal,

1152
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:10,313
and again this means that man or to be a
man is akin to daddy in a worldly and 

1153
01:07:15,301 --> 01:07:17,790
temporal sense.
It will be said by the man of bustle,

1154
01:07:17,791 --> 01:07:18,624
sociability and amicable illness.
How unreasonable that only one attains 

1155
01:07:22,891 --> 01:07:23,724
the goal for it is far more likely that 
many by the strength of united effort 

1156
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:28,283
should attain the goal and when we are 
many successes more certain and it is 

1157
01:07:31,501 --> 01:07:33,750
easier for each man severally.

1158
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:35,063
True enough,
it is far more likely and it is also 

1159
01:07:36,721 --> 01:07:39,510
true with respect to all earthly and 
material goods,

1160
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:42,990
if it is allowed to have its way.
However,

1161
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:44,303
this becomes the only true point of view
for desert way with God in eternity in 

1162
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:48,073
man's kinship with Daddy.
It does away with it or transforms it 

1163
01:07:51,751 --> 01:07:54,690
into a fable and puts in its place the 
modern,

1164
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:58,980
or we might say the old pagan notion 
that to be a man is to belong to a race,

1165
01:07:59,790 --> 01:08:00,623
endowed with reason to belong to it as a
specimen so that the race or species is 

1166
01:08:04,321 --> 01:08:07,650
higher than the individual.
This is a hundred years before nazi-ism,

1167
01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:11,160
which is to say that there are more no 
more individuals,

1168
01:08:11,161 --> 01:08:11,994
but only specimens,
but eternity which arches over at high 

1169
01:08:16,131 --> 01:08:21,131
above the temporal tranquil as the story
vault at night and God in heaven.

1170
01:08:21,171 --> 01:08:22,004
Who in the bliss of that sublime 
tranquility holds in survey without the 

1171
01:08:25,491 --> 01:08:27,440
least sense of dizziness at such a 
height.

1172
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:32,000
Those countless multitudes of men and 
knows each single individual by name.

1173
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:36,650
He the great examiner says that only one
attains the goal.

1174
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:42,710
Kierkegaard was a Christian 
existentialist Protestant.

1175
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:45,350
Dusty [inaudible] was an Orthodox 
Christian,

1176
01:08:45,351 --> 01:08:48,620
existentialist and Nicha who was also an
existentialist,

1177
01:08:48,740 --> 01:08:49,573
was a perhaps the most effective anti 
Christian philosopher who's ever 

1178
01:08:53,031 --> 01:08:55,280
existed,
and he made it one of his

1179
01:08:56,520 --> 01:09:01,320
conscious aims to take a hammer to 
everything that was foundational against

1180
01:09:01,321 --> 01:09:02,154
what was left of what was left at 
Christianity at the time that he 

1181
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:05,633
existed.
And the reason I'm telling you this is 

1182
01:09:06,781 --> 01:09:11,040
because existentialism is a strange 
philosophical.

1183
01:09:14,790 --> 01:09:15,623
It's a strange philosophy.
It brings people with very divergent 

1184
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:22,230
fundamental assumptions.
Together they share certain assumptions,

1185
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:27,180
and one assumption is that life in its 
essence is suffering,

1186
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:28,823
and the second is that the individual 
has a responsibility to adopt 

1187
01:09:32,491 --> 01:09:33,324
responsibility in faith in the face of 
that suffering and that that's the 

1188
01:09:36,271 --> 01:09:37,104
proper response.
The proper response isn't nihilism or 

1189
01:09:39,931 --> 01:09:42,480
ideological possession.
It's something else.

1190
01:09:42,481 --> 01:09:44,910
It's something that depends on the 
person themselves.

1191
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:49,110
Nature draws the same conclusions as 
Kierkegaard.

1192
01:09:49,170 --> 01:09:51,840
A traveler who had seen many countries 
in people's

1193
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:57,400
and several continents was asked what 
human traits he had found everywhere,

1194
01:09:58,210 --> 01:10:01,090
and he answered.
Men Are inclined to laziness.

1195
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:05,090
Some will feel that he might've said 
with greater justice,

1196
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:10,690
they're all timid.
They hide behind customs and opinions

1197
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:13,433
at bottom.
Every human being knows very well that 

1198
01:10:14,551 --> 01:10:18,870
he is in this world just once as 
something unique and then no accident,

1199
01:10:18,871 --> 01:10:19,704
however strange we'll throw together a 
second time into a unity such a curious 

1200
01:10:23,791 --> 01:10:26,010
and diffuse perilla,
plurality.

1201
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:30,280
He knows it,
but hides it like a bad conscience.

1202
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:32,253
Why?

1203
01:10:36,270 --> 01:10:40,380
The last lecture when we're talking 
about Roger's not the video lecture,

1204
01:10:40,381 --> 01:10:42,570
but the last time I was talking to you 
about Rogers,

1205
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:43,404
I was talking about instrumental speech 
and that's the speech that you engage 

1206
01:10:46,561 --> 01:10:47,394
in.
It's inauthentic from a Rogerian 

1207
01:10:48,991 --> 01:10:49,824
existentialist perspective when the goal
of this speech is to extract something 

1208
01:10:53,551 --> 01:10:54,384
from someone or something.
The goal is not mere clarity of 

1209
01:10:57,331 --> 01:10:58,164
communication and so what that means is 
that the speech becomes separate from 

1210
01:11:02,971 --> 01:11:03,804
the person and the speech is being used 
as a tool for what some element of the 

1211
01:11:07,861 --> 01:11:08,694
person requires and that's the hiding 
behind convention that niche is talking 

1212
01:11:14,011 --> 01:11:18,640
about because
when people use instrumental speech,

1213
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:19,474
they're almost always pursuing something
that other people have told them that 

1214
01:11:22,741 --> 01:11:24,960
they should want.
It might be status,

1215
01:11:24,961 --> 01:11:27,060
it might be career promotion.
It might be,

1216
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:29,790
well those are,
those are two of the two of the major.

1217
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:35,150
It might be material progress of other 
sorts,

1218
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:42,093
but it's only.
It's only the problem is is that it's 

1219
01:11:43,901 --> 01:11:44,734
only part of the person talking
and that part is the part gets fixated 

1220
01:11:49,481 --> 01:11:50,314
on that local achievement.
It's not the part that is attempting to 

1221
01:11:53,981 --> 01:11:54,814
inquire about what the truth might be in
this particular situation and to 

1222
01:11:58,241 --> 01:11:59,074
describe it as carefully as possible and
that's the clearest speech of the 

1223
01:12:02,621 --> 01:12:04,180
individual.
Now,

1224
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:05,253
one of the premises of existential 
psychotherapy is that that's the only 

1225
01:12:08,921 --> 01:12:10,240
way you can be healthy.

1226
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:16,250
You have to learn to speak and act as a 
whole and your.

1227
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:17,223
You have to be directed towards 
responsibility and truth and the 

1228
01:12:20,411 --> 01:12:25,411
consequences of not doing that will be a
that you will suffer pointlessly,

1229
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:30,850
which is the worst kind of suffering and
b,

1230
01:12:30,910 --> 01:12:34,390
which is worse.
You'll bring rack and ruin onto everyone

1231
01:12:34,391 --> 01:12:36,580
around you and it gets worse than that 
actually,

1232
01:12:36,581 --> 01:12:40,540
because if you do that long enough,
not only will you bring rock and ruin on

1233
01:12:40,541 --> 01:12:42,550
everyone around you,
you'll want to,

1234
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:49,470
and that seems at least potentially like
a bad outcome.

1235
01:12:51,650 --> 01:12:52,970
Well,
you can say,

1236
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:56,720
if you adopt a firm belief system that 
will protect you from that,

1237
01:12:56,721 --> 01:13:00,950
it's like the terror management idea of 
ideology protecting you from,

1238
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:03,890
from death anxiety,
which is a,

1239
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,233
it's a very hopeless philosophy that 
because it basically suggests that the 

1240
01:13:10,101 --> 01:13:10,934
only people reason people have beliefs 
is because they're terrified without 

1241
01:13:13,551 --> 01:13:17,480
them and that if they engage in any sort
of heroic behavior,

1242
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:18,553
it's merely a
facade that in the final analysis is 

1243
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:25,190
empty.
Although necessary.

1244
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:27,860
That's where the idea of positive 
illusion came from.

1245
01:13:28,130 --> 01:13:28,963
Essentially,
you know that life is so terrible that 

1246
01:13:30,741 --> 01:13:33,020
enlist you lie yourself into 
tranquility.

1247
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:36,770
You'll be mentally unstable and 
unhealthy.

1248
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:39,080
Uh,
a doctrine for which,

1249
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:41,060
by the way,
there is no real evidence,

1250
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:42,410
in fact,
the what

1251
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:48,380
anyways,
from fear of his neighbor who insists on

1252
01:13:48,381 --> 01:13:49,214
convention and veils himself with it.
But what is it that compels the 

1253
01:13:51,771 --> 01:13:53,690
individual human being to fear his 
neighbor,

1254
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:58,790
to think and act heard fashion and not 
to be glad of himself as sense of shame,

1255
01:13:58,791 --> 01:14:02,810
perhaps in a few rare cases in the vast 
majority,

1256
01:14:02,811 --> 01:14:06,590
it is the desire for comfort,
inertia in short,

1257
01:14:06,770 --> 01:14:09,500
that inclination to laziness of which 
the traveler spoke.

1258
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:12,400
He's right.
Men are even than they are timid,

1259
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:17,350
and what they fear most is the troubles 
with which any unconditional honesty and

1260
01:14:17,351 --> 01:14:22,351
nudity would burden them.
Only artists hate this slovenly life and

1261
01:14:23,631 --> 01:14:27,050
borrowed manners and loosely fitting 
opinions and unveiled the secret.

1262
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:27,973
Everyone's bad conscience.
The principle that every human being is 

1263
01:14:30,471 --> 01:14:31,820
a unique wonder.

1264
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:34,563
They dare to show us the human being as 
he is down to the last muscle himself 

1265
01:14:37,721 --> 01:14:39,490
and himself alone.
Even more.

1266
01:14:39,491 --> 01:14:42,310
That in this rigorous consistency of his
uniqueness,

1267
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:46,870
he is beautiful and worth contemplating 
as novel and incredible as every work of

1268
01:14:46,871 --> 01:14:51,040
nature and by no means dull.
When a great thinker despises man,

1269
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:53,570
it's their laziness that he despises 
for.

1270
01:14:53,571 --> 01:14:54,404
It is an account on.
It is on account of this that they have 

1271
01:14:57,161 --> 01:14:57,994
the appearance of factory products and 
appear indifferent and not worthy of 

1272
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:02,553
companionship or instruction.
The human being who does not wish to 

1273
01:15:05,621 --> 01:15:09,400
belong to the mass must merely cease 
being comfortable with himself.

1274
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,640
Let him follow his conscience,
which shouts at him.

1275
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:18,870
Be Yourself.
What you're presently doing,

1276
01:15:19,810 --> 01:15:22,090
opining,
and desiring

1277
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:25,720
that is not really you.

1278
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:31,633
Okay.

1279
01:15:32,890 --> 01:15:33,920
That's good place to start.

1280
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:39,353
See you Thursday.
