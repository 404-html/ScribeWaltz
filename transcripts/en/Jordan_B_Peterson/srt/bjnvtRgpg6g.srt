1
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,303
Welcome to maps of meaning.
So the first question I guess I might 

2
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:10,590
have is,
what,

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,300
why are you here?
Anybody got an interesting reason?

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,700
Uh,
order to be able to manipulate,

5
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:20,783
manipulate reality to my best interests.
A good plan except for the manipulate 

6
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:26,784
part
is often it's better to work with 

7
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:35,040
reality generally then manipulate it 
because it tends to,

8
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,450
you know,
kick back.

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,680
Anybody else?
Yeah.

10
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,760
Oh yeah,
of course.

11
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:47,220
Actually changes for the,
for the better

12
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,260
author
really.

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,913
Is he any good
friend and you are no wonder he 

14
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:04,790
threatens
to this course.

15
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,310
Six years ago in this course,
changed the way I see the world.

16
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:10,830
So I want to say after six years what 
happens now?

17
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,480
You want to see if it'll change back.

18
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,460
Well,
that's good.

19
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,343
So why did you decide why?
Why after all this time did you decide 

20
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:19,500
to come back?
Well,

21
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:20,334
I thought about the things you discussed
in the class over you over those six 

22
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:25,560
years,
but now it's been a while.

23
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:29,600
And I want to refresh myself and see the
new experiences I have in your things.

24
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,410
I've learned how and what I can take 
from it.

25
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:33,720
Now.
That's very,

26
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:34,554
um,
dedicated and hopefully useful to get a 

27
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,830
spiritual awakening.
God,

28
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:45,430
I hope I didn't see that he did he.
Did he did any,

29
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,090
any,
like any description or

30
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:54,620
was it associated with an epileptic 
seizure associated with vision?

31
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,570
Oh really?
Oh,

32
00:01:57,571 --> 00:01:59,280
that's interesting.
Yeah,

33
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:01,020
that can get out of hand,
that sort of thing.

34
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:02,610
You know,
it's interesting.

35
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:06,120
I mean one of the things that I 
experienced when I started to learn some

36
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:06,954
of the things that aren't going to talk 
to you guys about is a very radical 

37
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:12,570
increase in the intensity and clarity of
my dreams.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,300
It wasn't pleasant by the way.
I

39
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,580
thought it was useful or most useful 
things aren't that pleasant.

40
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,010
So you're in for some of the same 
punishment.

41
00:02:23,011 --> 00:02:26,120
I guess that's the plan.
Is that all right?

42
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,203
Anybody else
sort of have a independent interest and 

43
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,420
existential psychology,
etc. So this seemed like a good place to

44
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,373
discuss it.
And I took care of all your previouS 

45
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:45,900
class personnel personality.
When did you take that?

46
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,000
Couple of years ago.
Yeah.

47
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,183
Yeah.
Well it's a good preparation for this 

48
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:50,664
class.
Like is there anybody here who doesn't 

49
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:54,114
have any idea what this class is about 
and just more or less showed up because 

50
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,680
the time was right to or anything like 
that.

51
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,930
So you don't really have any idea what 
you're in for.

52
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,350
It looked cool and it's not also that 
utfc

53
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,583
right.
Well I'm going to jump right into it 

54
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:14,770
because why not and all spend.

55
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,753
So I'm going to talk to you for about 
two hours and then you can have a break 

56
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,290
and then I'm going to tell you what you 
have to do in the class.

57
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,124
Okay.
So,

58
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,563
but by that time you'll know if you want
to take the class because you'll know 

59
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:26,830
whether or not you were interested in 
what I told you about.

60
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:30,220
So I'm going to video the clAss.
I always do that.

61
00:03:30,221 --> 00:03:31,054
And so the vIdeos will be online.
the ones from previous years are online 

62
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:35,020
as well.
So,

63
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:35,870
uh,
you know,

64
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,090
hopefully that'll be a useful resource.
Uh,

65
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,130
it shouldn't take me as much setup time 
the next time is it did today,

66
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:42,964
you know,
I'm still getting used to this 

67
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,793
equipment,
so.

68
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,600
All right,
so

69
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,850
I want to tell you why I'm telling you 
the things that I'm going to tell you

70
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,853
mean

71
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,693
when I was approximately the same age 
that you people are probably a little 

72
00:03:59,911 --> 00:04:03,840
bit older because I imagine your guys 
around 21 or something like that.

73
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,260
I was probably about your age and then 
maybe a couple of years older.

74
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,510
First year I was in graduate school in 
particular,

75
00:04:09,511 --> 00:04:12,780
which I guess was the 1985.
So I was 23 then,

76
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,570
um,
that was in,

77
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:18,360
like I said,
that was in 1985 and there were a couple

78
00:04:18,361 --> 00:04:22,290
of times in the late 20th century where 
the cold war,

79
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,223
it came to a peak and one time I guess 
was probably in about 1957 when I think 

80
00:04:29,581 --> 00:04:32,040
it was 57.
I hope I have my dates right.

81
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,190
Was whenever stalad and announced that 
he had developed a hydrogen bomb.

82
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,060
Now I don't know how much you guys know 
about hydrogen bombs,

83
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:39,923
but all you really need to know about a 
hydrogen bomb is that they use atom 

84
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:44,370
bombs as a trigger.

85
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,550
So they're,
um,

86
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,980
they're quite the weapon.
And the ussr and the us made some very,

87
00:04:54,981 --> 00:04:55,814
very big ones.
They're big enough to make the thing 

88
00:04:56,961 --> 00:05:00,260
that was dropped on hiroshima look like 
dynamite,

89
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,473
you know,
so hundreds and hundreds of times 

90
00:05:03,141 --> 00:05:05,630
bigger,
maybe thousands of times.

91
00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:07,100
It's been a while since I looked into 
it.

92
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,930
and then in 1962 there was a cuban 
missile crisis.

93
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,183
Not a good story about that.
So about 10 years ago I went down to 

94
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,520
tucson,
Arizona to a conference on consciousness

95
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:23,354
there.
And they have that conference fairly 

96
00:05:25,821 --> 00:05:27,100
frequently in tucson.
It's,

97
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,140
it's become quite a popular conference 
even though it isn't clear to me that we

98
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:30,974
know anything more about consciousness 
than we did before the conference 

99
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:36,110
started.
And two songs,

100
00:05:36,111 --> 00:05:38,660
kind of an interesting town.
It's in the middle of the desert,

101
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,790
the desert,
you know,

102
00:05:39,791 --> 00:05:43,040
it's a big sort of sorrow,
a road runner,

103
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,570
cactuses and um,
but it's also extremely dry there,

104
00:05:47,571 --> 00:05:49,820
which is of course what you'd expect 
given that it's a desert.

105
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,683
so one of the things the american do 
with tucson is store old fighter planes 

106
00:05:54,231 --> 00:05:56,990
there.
And so there's a airplane museum,

107
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,290
which is an amazing place that has maybe
500 planes,

108
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,240
including john f kennedy's airforce one.
Right.

109
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,390
Which is the jet that he used to zoom 
around the world.

110
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,250
it didn't even have a shower in it.
By the way.

111
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,030
It's funny because on the outside it 
looks like a modern jet,

112
00:06:10,031 --> 00:06:12,690
but to me inside it looks pretty much 
like it was from world war two,

113
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,001
you know,
because 19,

114
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:19,001
62 is a lot closer to world war ii than 
it is to now and all sorts of ways.

115
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:20,534
Even the.
The rockets that went to the moon look 

116
00:06:22,171 --> 00:06:25,490
like they were built by people who were 
using world war ii technology,

117
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:26,540
right.
They're full of switches,

118
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:31,541
mechanical switches and there
it's pretty basic anyways,

119
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,740
as well as the airport museum,
which is a very interesting place.

120
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,960
There's be 52 bombers there and all 
sorts of things.

121
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:39,794
Those things are huge.
There's also an airport graveyard where 

122
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:44,860
they store old fighter jets and there's 
a lot of old fighter jets,

123
00:06:44,861 --> 00:06:49,861
so there's acres and acres and acres and
acres and thousands and thousands of old

124
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,340
mothballed fighter jets lined up in the 
desert.

125
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:57,910
So that's kind of cool in a strange way.
But there was one other thing down there

126
00:06:58,221 --> 00:06:59,054
that I went and saw,
which was a decommissioned nuclear 

127
00:07:01,341 --> 00:07:02,174
missile site and it was a,
a intercontinental ballistic missile 

128
00:07:05,601 --> 00:07:06,350
site.
10.

129
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,080
Those were built in the fifties and 
early sixties.

130
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:12,020
And uh,
they were major league rockets.

131
00:07:12,021 --> 00:07:12,920
Those things,
you know,

132
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:13,754
I think the silo,
because we could go into the cycle of 

133
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,423
missiles weren't there anymore.
We can go into the silo and it was 

134
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,580
certainly farther across in diameter 
than this room,

135
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:26,090
I would think probably twice as twice as
large as this room.

136
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,310
So you can imagine how big a missile 
that would be it.

137
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,593
It's not your grandmother's missile,
it's a major league piece of armament 

138
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:33,254
and out on the grounds that these things
were underground deep underground 

139
00:07:36,231 --> 00:07:38,530
because they didn't want them to get 
blown up if,

140
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,920
if,
if they were bombed.

141
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,143
So they buried them quite a long ways 
down and to get into it you had to go 

142
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:48,731
through this massive steel door that was
like a huge safe door except you know,

143
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,953
10 times as big and 10 times as thick 
and out in the yard of the nuclear 

144
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:55,634
missile site.
There were fences with barbed wire on 

145
00:07:58,221 --> 00:08:00,770
them of course.
And there was a missile cap,

146
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:01,604
you know,
so it'd be the nose cone of the missile 

147
00:08:02,721 --> 00:08:03,554
down.
Some of these missiles had single 

148
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:05,864
warheads and which were more than 
sufficient to demolish a city and some 

149
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:12,650
of them had multiple warheads so they 
would shoot out into space and then come

150
00:08:12,651 --> 00:08:16,160
back into earth and then they 
essentially break apart or,

151
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,053
or disperse into multiple missiles and 
then you could really bomb the hell out 

152
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,090
of whatever you were going to bomb 
instead of just destroying one city.

153
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,433
And so the nose cone was sitting out 
there and that was a pretty freaky 

154
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:27,830
looking thing.
I'll tell you,

155
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,713
like it was big.
It was about seven feet high I would 

156
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:31,724
think.
And maybe about the same amount of 

157
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:35,750
cross.
And it was made out of this plastic,

158
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:40,100
kind of a variegated plastic material 
that was about three quarters of an inch

159
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:44,150
thick and then it would melt off of 
course on re-entry because as I said,

160
00:08:44,151 --> 00:08:44,984
these things shot out into space and so 
I was kind of unnerving really in a 

161
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,540
serious way.
And then,

162
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:54,200
so we're at the missile site and you 
know,

163
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:57,390
I mentioned your grandmother's missile 
and that there was actually a reason for

164
00:08:57,391 --> 00:09:00,120
that.
It was a bit of foreshadowing because it

165
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:03,570
was a very funny place because at the 
front of the missile site there was sort

166
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:05,400
of this museum set up,
you know,

167
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:06,234
and it had pictures of reagan and 
gorbachev on it because they 

168
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,430
decommissioned the missile sites.

169
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,150
You know what,
when,

170
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,983
when detente occurred and then when,
when perestroika hit and the soviet 

171
00:09:15,691 --> 00:09:16,524
union started to collapse and so there 
was all these pictures of reagan and 

172
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:19,704
gorbachev from 1984.
And so the museum was kind of like a 

173
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,973
time capsule of 1984.
And the people who were running it were 

174
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:30,951
like retired arizona's.
And they were like your grandparents,

175
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:34,080
assuming you have retired.
Arizona's for your grandparents,

176
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:36,810
but they're real friendly and you know,
they were pretty happy to show you their

177
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,153
nuclear missile museum and it was sort 
of like being in their rec room except 

178
00:09:41,431 --> 00:09:43,110
that it was a nuclear missile site,
you know,

179
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,990
and they were hospitable and it was 
weird,

180
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,030
you know,
it's like welcome to,

181
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:51,340
you don't welcome people to a nuclear 
missile sites,

182
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,290
you know,
it's just not,

183
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,153
it's just not reasonable.
So it was very disconcerting and it was 

184
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,054
disconcerting that it was locked in the 
19 eighties and then it was 

185
00:09:59,101 --> 00:10:02,090
disconcerting that it was friendly and 
hospitable and you know,

186
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,890
they were kind of proud to show it off 
and happy to be there.

187
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,420
And then when you went down into the 
nuclear missile silo,

188
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,010
proper,
the control center,

189
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:12,630
it's sort of like,
like star trek,

190
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:13,500
you know,
from 19,

191
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:16,890
66 or 1967,
except more primitive.

192
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,253
I don't remember if the star trek 
control command area was modeled after 

193
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:28,680
the nuclear missile site control systems
or if it was the other way around,

194
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:29,514
but I suspect it was.
They were modeled after the nuclear 

195
00:10:32,101 --> 00:10:35,480
controls,
but that was really 1950.

196
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:38,130
It's like the whole place was painted in
that pastel green,

197
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,560
you know,
late fifties and early sixties.

198
00:10:40,561 --> 00:10:42,380
People really liked,
and it was,

199
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,550
it had this 19 fifties,
um,

200
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:45,983
what would you call it,
an aesthetic and you wouldn't 

201
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:50,220
necessarily think that a nuclear missile
site would have an aesthetic,

202
00:10:50,221 --> 00:10:52,110
but it does.
And it looked like high tech,

203
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:57,111
1957 in 1957 technology.
And so they brought you into the control

204
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,574
room and the control desk was probably,
or the molecule or whatever you might 

205
00:11:01,951 --> 00:11:02,784
call it,
was about three times as long as this 

206
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:05,070
maybe four times.

207
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:05,963
Well,
not pretty impressive piece of 

208
00:11:06,571 --> 00:11:07,404
machinery.
And the way you launch the missiles was 

209
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,953
not too secure in my humble opinion.
What happened was one guy wore the key 

210
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:18,150
around his neck and another guy who wore
the key around his neck.

211
00:11:18,151 --> 00:11:18,984
And then in order to launch the sites,
you had to put the keys in the same 

212
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:24,030
time.
And they were far enough apart so nobody

213
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,310
could stretch their arms,
you know,

214
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:28,140
which was the kind of the high tech part
of it.

215
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,303
So.
And you had to put the key in and then 

216
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:33,240
you both had to turn the key for 10 
seconds.

217
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,613
Okay.
So now one of the things that you may 

218
00:11:36,151 --> 00:11:38,430
know about ballistic missiles or you may
not,

219
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:40,050
is there not cruise missiles?
Man,

220
00:11:40,051 --> 00:11:42,360
onCe you set those things off,
they're not coming back.

221
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,430
There are bullets.
That's what makes them ballistic.

222
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:45,264
So you know,
if you aim a gun at someone and you 

223
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:47,334
shoot and you decide halfway when the 
bullets halfway there that maybe that 

224
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:52,374
wasn't the good thing to do,
it's a little late because you're not 

225
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:55,750
telling that bullet to come back.

226
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,483
And it's the same with ballistic 
missiles and those things are going a 

227
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:02,170
lot faster than the bullets.
You know,

228
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:04,780
like at 22 bullet goes about the speed 
of sound,

229
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:07,780
600 miles an hour or so.
But a ballistic missile,

230
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,830
nothing has to go seven miles a second 
to get out of the gravity of theory.

231
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,130
Now I'm not sure they go quite that fast
because that's escape velocity,

232
00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:15,964
right?
You need to do that to get out of the 

233
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:19,690
gravitational wealth.
But to get out there into space,

234
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:22,060
you have to be damn close to seven miles
a second.

235
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:22,894
And so it's a bullet,
very large bullet with a very explosive 

236
00:12:26,141 --> 00:12:30,010
hand on it going seven miles at second.
And once You turn those two keys,

237
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:31,000
man,
it's good.

238
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,020
That's it.
There's no,

239
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:33,790
there's no turning back.
That's that.

240
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,940
And so theY took us through a simulated 
launch,

241
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:40,270
which still kind of,
it's still an uncanny feeling,

242
00:12:40,271 --> 00:12:41,440
remembering that,
you know,

243
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,950
because it was,
it's a hell of a thing to apprehend.

244
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,040
And then they told us that the keys Were
in once,

245
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,720
right?
So we were 10 seconds away.

246
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,033
Now they wouldn't tell us when,
but we know it was during the cuban 

247
00:12:55,901 --> 00:12:56,734
missile crisis.

248
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,120
So,
you know,

249
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:03,360
there are a couple of times in the 
latter part of the 20th century where we

250
00:13:03,361 --> 00:13:04,690
made it through,
uh,

251
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,240
like the eye of a needle.
We barely bloody well made it.

252
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:12,270
And the cuban missile crisis was one of 
those points.

253
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,133
But the,
the early eighties things were heating 

254
00:13:14,431 --> 00:13:16,740
up pretty badly to,
you know,

255
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:17,663
in about 1984,
there was a movie that came out called 

256
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:22,890
the day after you guys probably don't 
know about the day after,

257
00:13:22,891 --> 00:13:23,724
but it was the most watched movie that 
had ever been broadcast on tv at that 

258
00:13:26,311 --> 00:13:27,930
point.
And basically what it showed us,

259
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:29,663
what a city would be like the day after 
the United States had been bombed into 

260
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,220
total desolation by a soviet missile 
attack.

261
00:13:38,221 --> 00:13:41,310
And you know,
it was a pretty hair raising movie.

262
00:13:41,311 --> 00:13:42,144
And one of the things that was quite 
interesting about it was the ronald 

263
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:45,024
reagan later said that he watched that 
movie and that was actually part of the 

264
00:13:47,251 --> 00:13:50,110
reason that he entered into detente 
talks with,

265
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,750
with the soviets.

266
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,793
Now you know,
reagan and being basically scaring the 

267
00:13:54,871 --> 00:13:58,410
hell out of the soviets.
He called him an evil empire,

268
00:13:58,411 --> 00:14:01,140
which liberals weren't very happy about.
But the soviets man,

269
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,290
they were an evil empire.
There's absolutely no doubt about it.

270
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,483
You know,
it's not obvious how many people the 

271
00:14:06,811 --> 00:14:10,110
soviets killed during their,
their communist revolution.

272
00:14:10,111 --> 00:14:10,944
And in the years following that.
But the estimates range from 20 to $60 

273
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:17,490
million now,
that's a lot of people like even if it's

274
00:14:17,491 --> 00:14:18,324
$20 million,
that's three times as many people were 

275
00:14:20,131 --> 00:14:22,060
killed in the holocaust,
you know the song,

276
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,053
the soviet starved 6 million ukrainians 
in the 19 thirties and that was just to 

277
00:14:26,641 --> 00:14:27,474
get warmed up.
So the idea that the soviets were an 

278
00:14:29,581 --> 00:14:33,030
eviL empire,
it's like it's a strong word,

279
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,850
but there's absolutely no doubt that it 
was true.

280
00:14:35,851 --> 00:14:37,530
And the more we learn about what 
happened,

281
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,100
especially during the this period,
although lennon was no picnic,

282
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,180
you know,
he,

283
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,880
he pretty much created the stalinists 
monster that followed him.

284
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,380
The more we learned about it,
the more horrible if it comes,

285
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:52,340
you know,
and the soviet system was operated,

286
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,400
the economy fundamentally ran on slave 
labor,

287
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,770
you know,
for what economy there was.

288
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,990
And you know,
what happened with reagan and park was,

289
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,123
well first of all,
the soviet union was falling apart 

290
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:05,420
because there's just so long you can 
keep a sinking ship afloat,

291
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,283
you know,
and something that big can die 20 years 

292
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,680
before it falls over.
You know,

293
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:14,890
a system like that can stumble along 
half got it and,

294
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,200
and still manage and so by the time 
reagan come along,

295
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:19,034
the thing,
it probably pretty much burned itself 

296
00:15:20,031 --> 00:15:22,100
out as a consequence of internal 
contradictions,

297
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:26,600
but he ramped up the american military 
spending to a staggering degree and part

298
00:15:26,601 --> 00:15:27,434
of the idea behind that,
at least that's what republicans would 

299
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:31,040
have everyone believe in,
it might be true,

300
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:31,903
was that they're just going to spend the
russians right into bankruptcy and they 

301
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:35,924
basically did.

302
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:39,950
and so that was that for the soviet 
union and it fell over 1989,

303
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,690
which was like,
that was a good day.

304
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,823
That was a really good day.
And the weird thing is no one saw it 

305
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,370
coming,
you know,

306
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:47,450
and that was,
that was,

307
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,950
that was shocking.
It was like one day the soviet union was

308
00:15:49,951 --> 00:15:50,784
there and the next day the soviet union 
was gone and there were no cia analysts 

309
00:15:54,591 --> 00:15:55,161
that said,
hey,

310
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:56,600
yeah,
there were about ready to crumble.

311
00:15:56,601 --> 00:15:57,434
You know,
you just have to blow on them and 

312
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,170
they'll fall over.
It was a shock to everyone,

313
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,213
you know?
And then it was very iffy in the 

314
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:06,680
aftermath whether or not it would hold 
'em yeltsin who was a terrible drunkard,

315
00:16:06,681 --> 00:16:08,840
but actually a pretty courageous while 
he was a russian,

316
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,003
you know,
he was a pretty courageous guy and he 

317
00:16:11,901 --> 00:16:16,901
faced down a reestablishment by the 
totalitarians on a tank,

318
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,013
you know,
so that was good for him because that 

319
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:21,350
was pretty frightening to.
Anyway.

320
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:25,190
So I'm telling you all this because when
I grew up,

321
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,490
most of the people I knew were convinced
that there was no bloody way we're gonna

322
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:31,720
make it to the 20th century,

323
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,793
you know,
when I think I can remember discussing 

324
00:16:36,511 --> 00:16:38,700
this with all of my friends frequently,
you know,

325
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:40,470
and um,
you know,

326
00:16:40,471 --> 00:16:43,470
some people kind of used that as an 
excuse not to get their life together.

327
00:16:43,471 --> 00:16:43,910
Like,
you know,

328
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,120
what the hell's the point,
you know,

329
00:16:45,121 --> 00:16:46,490
we're going to blow ourselves up 
anyways.

330
00:16:46,491 --> 00:16:46,851
So,
you know,

331
00:16:46,851 --> 00:16:49,410
I might as well drink until I fall over.
And you know,

332
00:16:49,411 --> 00:16:52,020
that's not particularly a moral way of 
looking at it.

333
00:16:52,021 --> 00:16:53,180
But I'll tell you,
like,

334
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,163
there,
there was no shortage of thinking that 

335
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:57,993
this was so insane that it was going to.
Siri certainly am an absolute 

336
00:17:00,931 --> 00:17:04,080
catastrophe.
And it damn near did like it wasn't some

337
00:17:04,081 --> 00:17:06,480
kind of collective delusion,
you know,

338
00:17:06,481 --> 00:17:08,010
there,
there were times,

339
00:17:08,011 --> 00:17:08,844
in fact,
there was a story recently published 

340
00:17:09,931 --> 00:17:11,030
about it,
uh,

341
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:15,210
a russian general who was given the 
order to launch the missiles.

342
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,420
Uh,
there was a mistake and reading on their

343
00:17:18,421 --> 00:17:19,254
display,
showing the missiles were coming from 

344
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,370
north America across the pools into 
Russia.

345
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:26,110
And he was told to launch and he didn't 
like,

346
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,210
well,
good for him,

347
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,380
you know,
but that's a little too close really.

348
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,223
You know,
and there's all sorts of other crazy 

349
00:17:34,021 --> 00:17:35,820
things that happened during that period 
of time.

350
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:36,654
So for example,
I read this book by an ex kgb guy who 

351
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:44,160
said he worked in a biological warfare,
a lab in the soviet union,

352
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,453
'em.
They'd killed a number of people by 

353
00:17:46,711 --> 00:17:48,540
accident when some of their bugs got 
out,

354
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,670
you know,
on the new order of 500 people,

355
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:52,140
which is a lot of people,
but it's not,

356
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:54,030
you know,
like 250,000 people,

357
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:54,864
but it's a lot of people.
But what those geniuses we're trying to 

358
00:17:57,181 --> 00:17:58,380
do mr krause,
ebola,

359
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,970
smallpox,
smallpox,

360
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,970
smallpox is unbelievably.

361
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,173
The combination of smallpox in ebola is 
extraordinarily easy to transmit and 

362
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,520
very,
very,

363
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:12,354
very fatal.
And so they were trying to cross it and 

364
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:16,704
then aerosolized it so that you could 
distribute it in canisters and blow it 

365
00:18:19,591 --> 00:18:20,830
over cities,
you know,

366
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,373
nice bit of scientific investigation.
Perfectly reasonable scientific 

367
00:18:25,231 --> 00:18:26,064
question.
Can it be done a little sketchy on the 

368
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:30,270
moral side you might say.
So,

369
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,400
you know,
it was a pretty crazy period of time and

370
00:18:33,401 --> 00:18:34,680
I mean,
all human history.

371
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,930
What does the esky say about human 
history?

372
00:18:36,931 --> 00:18:40,170
The one thing you can say about that,
it's not rational,

373
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,033
right?
He said the very word sticks in your 

374
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:42,721
throat.
So,

375
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:43,554
you know,
it's always been crazy and it's crazy 

376
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:46,950
now,
but it was really crazy then.

377
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,770
And so we got through that and thank 
god,

378
00:18:49,771 --> 00:18:50,940
you know,
as far as I'm concerned,

379
00:18:50,941 --> 00:18:53,040
the world is a lot better place now than
it was.

380
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,800
Well it is 30 years ago,
40 years ago,

381
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,050
50 years ago,
things are way better now.

382
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,243
You know,
you hear a lot of doom and gloom about 

383
00:19:00,301 --> 00:19:01,680
how we're going to destroy the planet,

384
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:02,603
but,

385
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,080
but we probably aren't,
you know,

386
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:09,070
the population is going to stabilize out
at about 9 billion.

387
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,850
That's what the projections look like.
We already have about seven.

388
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,420
We can handle another two.
There's kind of,

389
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:19,840
there's gonna be some extinctions were 
eating up the ocean like insane.

390
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,020
You know,
purina,

391
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,143
that's mostly a fault of public policy.
But it looks like we're probably going 

392
00:19:25,421 --> 00:19:26,254
to squeak through the century with a bit
of damage and then things will settle 

393
00:19:28,451 --> 00:19:29,130
down.
You know,

394
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,120
it's,
it's highly probable if there's anything

395
00:19:31,121 --> 00:19:33,910
vaguely human left in 100 years that the
big problem will be.

396
00:19:33,911 --> 00:19:34,744
That population is rapidly decreasing.
That's already happening in european 

397
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:41,680
countries is happening in Japan.
It's going to happen in China.

398
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,693
So by the year 2100,
the most populous country in the world 

399
00:19:45,341 --> 00:19:48,040
is going to be Nigeria,
not China.

400
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,610
China's gonna lose people like mad 
because they had one child policy,

401
00:19:51,611 --> 00:19:53,560
right?
And everybody in China is getting old so

402
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,080
you know that it's not going to be hiker
populated.

403
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:56,943
So anyways,
so I was interested in all of this 

404
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:00,341
because,
you know,

405
00:20:00,341 --> 00:20:01,174
I kind of felt that I'd grown up,
I didn't feel like I'd grown up under a 

406
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,010
shadow.
I grown up under it's shadow,

407
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,873
you know,
and it was something in the back of our 

408
00:20:07,601 --> 00:20:10,240
minds all the time.
And then there was a question underneath

409
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:12,160
that,
a couple of them and one was

410
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,990
how,
why is this possible?

411
00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:16,824
How is this possible?
How could it be that the world could 

412
00:20:19,231 --> 00:20:22,920
divide itself up into two armed camps 
like hyper armed camps,

413
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:23,754
right?
tens of thousands of nuclear missiles 

414
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,560
more than enough to wipe out the enemy 
many times over.

415
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,290
I don't remember what the american 
arsenal peak debt,

416
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:33,720
but I think it was more than 50,000 
nuclear weapons.

417
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,290
I don't know if there are 50,000 towns 
in the soviet union,

418
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,393
you know,
maybe they were going to bomb bomb 

419
00:20:39,061 --> 00:20:42,330
moscow 50 times or something,
but after the first two or three years,

420
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:45,390
probably more or less irrelevant.
So it was really,

421
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,140
it was really crazy.
You know,

422
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,073
I don't know if you know this,
but I believe this was during the 

423
00:20:52,331 --> 00:20:54,160
kennedy era.
I hope I've got thiS right.

424
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,013
one of kennedy's genius boys came up 
with the [inaudible] kennedy's 

425
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,123
administration was run by a lot of 
harvard graduates and ivy league 

426
00:21:02,651 --> 00:21:03,730
graduates and so,
you know,

427
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:05,320
they were supposed to be pretty 
intelligent,

428
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:07,630
but intelligence and wisdom are not the 
same thing.

429
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,070
But anyways,
um,

430
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,570
they established a policy which was 
called mutual assured destruction,

431
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:17,110
which means if you hit me,
I kill you and then you kill me.

432
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:19,390
And so it'd be better if we just didn't 
bother.

433
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,720
and the acronym was mad,
right?

434
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,610
Mutual assured destruction.
It's like,

435
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,340
you know,
just thinking about that it,

436
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,413
it's a chilling thought.
It's like what horrible entity thought 

437
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:34,660
that up as a joke.
You know,

438
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:35,440
when you think,
well,

439
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,273
does that sum.
It says that some politician's idea of 

440
00:21:38,141 --> 00:21:40,150
width,
like where'd that come from?

441
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,940
So that's a hell of a thing to make a 
joke about,

442
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,200
you know,
mad.

443
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:44,951
Well,
that was right.

444
00:21:44,951 --> 00:21:46,840
It was definitely mad,
you know,

445
00:21:46,841 --> 00:21:47,674
and the odd thing is,
is that we didn't blow ourselves up and 

446
00:21:50,171 --> 00:21:52,210
we didn't have a third world war and you
know,

447
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,203
you,
you can't make a solid claim that the 

448
00:21:55,721 --> 00:21:56,554
invention of nuclear weapons was 
necessarily the worst thing that could 

449
00:21:59,221 --> 00:22:00,340
have happened,
you know,

450
00:22:00,341 --> 00:22:03,100
because even the soviets who were 
completely insane,

451
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,830
and of course the model was to probably 
even worse.

452
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,980
They weren't insane enough to start a 
nuclear war.

453
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:12,490
Now stalin,
there's evidence,

454
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,560
there's debate about it,
but there was,

455
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,710
and there's evidence that stalin was 
basically murdered partly by khrushchev,

456
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,980
was who was his,
who was his successor,

457
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,230
um,
when stalin died,

458
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,243
khrushchev and three other people were 
in his house and what happened in 

459
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,450
stalin's house the night he died is not 
clear.

460
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:31,720
But I read a book recently called 
stolen.

461
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:34,750
Interestingly enough,
that was written by a guy who had access

462
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:36,850
to the full communist party archives,
you know,

463
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:37,763
which was relatively new thing and that 
was his conclusion and he also believed 

464
00:22:41,891 --> 00:22:45,970
that stalin was gearing up to do it,
an invasion of europe and that he didn't

465
00:22:45,971 --> 00:22:50,020
give a damn how many cities would have 
to be bombed in order for the soviets to

466
00:22:50,021 --> 00:22:51,450
roll through.
And stalIn.

467
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,670
He was like that,
you know,

468
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:53,643
stalin was perfectly capable of taking 
entire nations of people out in eastern 

469
00:22:57,371 --> 00:23:01,330
europe by train and shipping them out to
siberia in the middle of the winter with

470
00:23:01,331 --> 00:23:04,570
nothing to eat and no tools and letting 
them live,

471
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:05,830
which of course they didn't.

472
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,390
And that meant women,
children,

473
00:23:07,391 --> 00:23:08,590
men,
you know,

474
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:13,240
shorn of all their belongings and thrust
out into the middle of nowhere to perish

475
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:13,961
or,
or,

476
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:17,290
or live as they saw fit.
And if they perished so much,

477
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:19,120
the better as far as stalin was 
concerned.

478
00:23:19,121 --> 00:23:21,490
And so he wasn't exactly the sort of 
person.

479
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:25,270
The idea of a nuclear war would 
necessarily stop.

480
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:28,120
And it's certainly possible that that's 
what he was hoping for.

481
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:30,123
You know,
because when we look at people like 

482
00:23:30,881 --> 00:23:32,230
stalin and hitler,
we think,

483
00:23:32,231 --> 00:23:32,980
well,
you know,

484
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,960
thereafter world domination,
you know,

485
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:35,823
and you think,
well in some sense that's kind of a 

486
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:38,950
positive motivation,
right?

487
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:43,060
I mean not really,
but it's like if you have a core vat say

488
00:23:43,061 --> 00:23:44,470
and someone steals it,
you can think,

489
00:23:44,471 --> 00:23:45,770
well,
I know why they stole it.

490
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,570
They want to have the corvette,
you know,

491
00:23:47,571 --> 00:23:48,404
it's,
it's an understandable motivation to 

492
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:51,674
want power.

493
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:52,783
It's not necessarily an admirable one,
although sometimes power is a perfectly 

494
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,353
reasonable thing to pursue,
but I don't have any idea why we ever 

495
00:23:59,931 --> 00:24:01,790
assumed that those guys were after 
victory.

496
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:03,763
Like you should never make the 
presupposition that everyone is out to 

497
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:10,490
When some people are out to lose and the
more people they can take wIth them,

498
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,860
the better.
You know.

499
00:24:11,861 --> 00:24:12,694
And when hitler died,
he committed suicide in a bunker way 

500
00:24:14,931 --> 00:24:15,764
down below berlin.
West berlin was on fire and europe was 

501
00:24:17,571 --> 00:24:18,351
burning.
It's like,

502
00:24:18,351 --> 00:24:19,184
as far as I can tell,
that was exactly what hitler was after 

503
00:24:21,411 --> 00:24:22,800
right from the beginning.
You know,

504
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,940
he was interested in fire as a purifying
agent.

505
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:28,280
You know,
he's a fire worship or in some sense,

506
00:24:28,281 --> 00:24:31,860
because if you look at the nuremberg 
gatherings of the nazis,

507
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:33,350
you know,
they're spectacular,

508
00:24:33,351 --> 00:24:37,250
spectacular celebrations,
unbelievably dramatic and impressive,

509
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,080
and they frequently featured fire and 
fire's up purifying agent,

510
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:42,951
you know,
and hitler,

511
00:24:42,951 --> 00:24:43,784
by the end of world war ii was,
he was pretty contemptuous of the 

512
00:24:46,521 --> 00:24:50,000
germans because they really hadn't 
served him well.

513
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,480
It wasn't like he thought,
well maybe it wasn't such a good idea to

514
00:24:53,481 --> 00:24:55,190
start a whole second world war,
you know,

515
00:24:55,191 --> 00:24:57,560
because he was a little on the 
narcissistic side we might say.

516
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,620
But by the time the russians came 
marching in,

517
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,463
in Germany was in ruins.
Hitler was perfectly happy to have the 

518
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,623
allies tromp all over the citizens 
because that's what they deserved 

519
00:25:07,581 --> 00:25:09,920
anyways.
And so that's the sort of guy he was.

520
00:25:09,921 --> 00:25:10,754
And so why we would assume that he 
wanted to win just because that's what 

521
00:25:13,641 --> 00:25:16,160
he said is something I've never been 
able to understand.

522
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,533
You know,
the kids who shot up columbine didn't 

523
00:25:18,921 --> 00:25:19,754
want to,
when they wanted to kill as many people 

524
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,394
as possible to make a point and then 
they wanted to kill themselves just in 

525
00:25:24,831 --> 00:25:25,664
case you didn't exactly get the point 
and the point was the more destruction 

526
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,580
the vendor and if I asked to go along 
with it,

527
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:32,690
hey,
no problem.

528
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,900
That just makes me a little bit more 
serious than I might've otherwise be.

529
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:40,820
And so those sorts of motivations are 
not pleasant to understand,

530
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,300
but we have enough documentation about 
events like that,

531
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:46,040
you know,
especially the mass killings.

532
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,350
Those guys have written down exactly why
they do it.

533
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:49,483
Now.
I have some excellent books on 

534
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:55,520
extraordinary vengeful,
a map serial killers at mass murderers.

535
00:25:55,521 --> 00:25:56,354
I know exactly how they think.
There's a great book if you're 

536
00:25:58,251 --> 00:26:00,140
interested in this sort of thing called 
pans,

537
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:04,700
ram p a n zed r a,
m and carl pants.

538
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:05,534
Ram waS a serial killer and rapist who 
lIve pretty much early in the 20th 

539
00:26:09,411 --> 00:26:10,244
century and he was a tough delinquency 
sorta kid from a large family and when 

540
00:26:13,611 --> 00:26:14,480
he was,
you know,

541
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,680
13,
14,

542
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:16,514
they sent them off to some reform school
and it was run by the same sort of 

543
00:26:19,701 --> 00:26:22,880
people that run canada's residential 
schools and you know,

544
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:27,500
so those were basically predators on 
children and of course he was raped and,

545
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,640
and,
and,

546
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:32,750
and brutalized and tormented and in all 
sorts of horrible ways and,

547
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,320
but he was a tough guy and when he came 
out he decided that,

548
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,283
you know,
the human race really wasn't worth that 

549
00:26:38,421 --> 00:26:42,170
much and that he was going to reek as 
much mayhem as he possibly could for the

550
00:26:42,171 --> 00:26:43,004
rest of his life.

551
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,220
He raped a thousand men,
killed dozens of people.

552
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:50,220
He kept track of the dollar value of the
buildings.

553
00:26:50,221 --> 00:26:54,630
He burned down like this was a serious 
scott and he wasn't.

554
00:26:54,631 --> 00:26:58,970
He was bent on destruction and that's 
that what his.

555
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,920
What were his dying words?
First of all,

556
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:03,540
there was a committee,
I believe,

557
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:04,374
of women who intervened on behalf of him
because they were anti a capital 

558
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:09,294
punishment and he said to them,
if I remember correctly that he wished 

559
00:27:12,901 --> 00:27:13,734
the human race had one neck so that he 
could put his hands around it and 

560
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:17,580
squeeze.
So you know,

561
00:27:17,581 --> 00:27:18,414
that was his way of pointing out to the 
people who didn't think that maybe 

562
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,493
capital punishment was justified in his 
case that maybe they weren't thinking 

563
00:27:25,381 --> 00:27:27,360
clearly.
And then to the hang man,

564
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:29,340
he said,
hurry up you who's your bastard?

565
00:27:29,341 --> 00:27:31,980
I could kill 10 men in the time it takes
you to hang me.

566
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:35,190
So you know,
you don't get a statement like that from

567
00:27:35,191 --> 00:27:37,620
someone who isn't thoroughly committed 
to what he's doing.

568
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,443
So the situation in the world found 
itself involved in really had me 

569
00:27:45,301 --> 00:27:46,081
thinking,
you know,

570
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,010
part of it was,
well,

571
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:47,844
what the hell is going on with all these
weapons and how can it possibly be that 

572
00:27:50,401 --> 00:27:52,810
anyone thinks that that's a reasonable 
solution?

573
00:27:52,811 --> 00:27:55,980
And how did it come about that this 
could even occur?

574
00:27:55,981 --> 00:27:56,814
And what are we thinking?
And then so there was that and then 

575
00:27:58,951 --> 00:27:59,784
there was also the why are people so 
damn convinced on each side of this 

576
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:06,060
argument that they are right enough to 
risk everything for,

577
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,640
you know,
which is a perfectly good question.

578
00:28:08,641 --> 00:28:10,650
And then there was the malevolence 
issue,

579
00:28:10,651 --> 00:28:11,484
like how much of this has nothing to do 
with wanting to see your side when and 

580
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:17,520
everything to do with wanting to see 
everything lose,

581
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,260
you know.
And then,

582
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,320
oh,
then there was another issue which was,

583
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,830
well our are both sides wrong

584
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:33,600
are both sides,
right?

585
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,090
Because that's more of a cultural 
relativist approach,

586
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:36,631
right?
It's like,

587
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:36,991
yeah,
yeah.

588
00:28:36,991 --> 00:28:37,824
The communists believed one thing and 
the bloody capitalist believe another 

589
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,770
and they're just as bad.
And who were you lIke,

590
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,653
who believes what is completely 
arbitrary because belief systems are 

591
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:47,270
arbitrary and so maybe they're both 
writer,

592
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,780
they're both wrong.
And I thought,

593
00:28:48,781 --> 00:28:49,614
well,
either of those conclusions was pretty 

594
00:28:50,701 --> 00:28:53,010
damn dismal because if they're both 
right,

595
00:28:53,011 --> 00:28:54,720
then well,
what are you going to do?

596
00:28:54,721 --> 00:28:56,640
Have them talk it out.
I don't think so.

597
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,520
And if they're both wrong,
well that's not much better.

598
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,710
And then if one's right in the other's 
wrong,

599
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,203
well,
does that mean anything like is it 

600
00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:08,550
possible for one belief system to be 
more right than another belief system?

601
00:29:08,551 --> 00:29:09,384
Because of course that's certainly not 
attendant of moral relativism and you 

602
00:29:12,091 --> 00:29:12,924
might think about that as the standard.
Certainly the standard intellectual 

603
00:29:15,691 --> 00:29:18,690
approach to morality and probably has 
been for the last hundred years,

604
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,710
I think by the way that that's a 
reprehensible morality

605
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:24,923
w

606
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,933
and what I'll tell you as the course,
whereas we move through the course 

607
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:29,774
because one of the things are trying to 
find out was why is what we were 

608
00:29:32,841 --> 00:29:33,950
fighting for,
you know,

609
00:29:33,951 --> 00:29:37,400
assuming that you give the west a bit of
the benefit of the doubt and assume that

610
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:38,234
some of the things that we stand for,
we actually stand for and aren't just 

611
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,153
posturing and parading.
Was that grOunded in anything or was it 

612
00:29:46,931 --> 00:29:48,190
just arbitrary opinion?

613
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,420
So that's what we're going to talk 
about.

614
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,670
We're going to talk about that,

615
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:55,620
why people believe the things they 
believe,

616
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:58,800
what psychological function at the 
beliefs,

617
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:00,530
uh,
uh,

618
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,353
perform.

619
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,223
We're going to talk about malevolence 
and aS far as I can tell like 

620
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:07,973
malevolence is the willingness to do 
evil and I think the best is the best 

621
00:30:11,071 --> 00:30:12,330
definition of evil.
That,

622
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,160
and I thought about this for a long 
time,

623
00:30:14,161 --> 00:30:15,780
it's like actually what constitutes 
evil.

624
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:17,460
It's complicated and we'll talk about a 
lot,

625
00:30:17,461 --> 00:30:20,670
but I think if you want a one line 
summary,

626
00:30:20,671 --> 00:30:23,820
it's the desire to do harm for the sake 
of the harm.

627
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,010
So you have to think about it as a kind 
of art form.

628
00:30:27,011 --> 00:30:28,390
So like if you're.
look,

629
00:30:28,391 --> 00:30:28,710
if,
if,

630
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:29,543
if you have a terrorist and you think 
he's hitting an atom bomb in a stadium 

631
00:30:31,841 --> 00:30:32,830
and you think,
well,

632
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,720
he's not going to tell me you have good 
evidence,

633
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:36,550
he's not going to tell me unless I 
torture them.

634
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:39,280
I don't think you should torture because
tortures wrong.

635
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,143
But you know,
if you're doing that and you really 

636
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:44,080
believe these hidden atom bomb in a 
stadium,

637
00:30:44,081 --> 00:30:44,914
well at least you have some 
justification for what you're doing and 

638
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:49,030
it's not necessarily that what you're 
doing is evil.

639
00:30:49,031 --> 00:30:51,520
It might be wrong,
it might be misguided.

640
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,950
I mean,
who's to say in a situation like that,

641
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,570
it should certainly be illegal,
but at least you can say,

642
00:30:58,571 --> 00:31:01,420
well,
there is a plausible explanation for it,

643
00:31:01,421 --> 00:31:04,000
but lots of situations where there is 
absolute horror,

644
00:31:04,001 --> 00:31:06,580
there's no plausible explanation for it 
whatsoever.

645
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,040
So I can give you an example.
so for example,

646
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:12,100
one of the things that used to happen in
auschwitz,

647
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,970
if I remember correctly,
auschwitz,

648
00:31:14,971 --> 00:31:18,240
I don't know what you guys envisioned 
when you envisioned concentration camps,

649
00:31:18,241 --> 00:31:20,100
you know,
like concentration camp.

650
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,670
It's a funny name first of all because 
it's not really at camp.

651
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,593
You know what I mean?
But a concentration camp is like a 

652
00:31:27,391 --> 00:31:29,010
prison,
you know,

653
00:31:29,011 --> 00:31:31,230
and that's easy to scan,
easy to envision them,

654
00:31:31,231 --> 00:31:33,780
like a prison,
those bloody things where cities,

655
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,470
right?
They have tens of thousands of people in

656
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,390
sort of their massive.
At least they were large towns.

657
00:31:39,391 --> 00:31:41,940
So these are very big places anyways.
You know,

658
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,293
at the typical concentration camp,
the trains would come rolling in and of 

659
00:31:46,381 --> 00:31:48,740
course people have been packed into the 
damn trains,

660
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:50,190
like,
well worse than animals.

661
00:31:50,191 --> 00:31:51,024
They'd be packed standing and lots of 
people just died in the cars because 

662
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:54,323
especially if they are old or little in 
or had some respiratory problem or 

663
00:31:57,691 --> 00:31:58,524
something like that because they'd 
overheat if they were cramped right in 

664
00:32:00,421 --> 00:32:01,254
the middle of people or they'd freeze to
death on the outsIde because they're 

665
00:32:03,181 --> 00:32:05,100
pushed right against the wood or you 
know.

666
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,113
But that was okay.
It just made the job easier when they 

667
00:32:07,351 --> 00:32:08,970
finally landed at auschwitz,
you know,

668
00:32:08,971 --> 00:32:09,804
and then once they were in auschwitz,
well then the guards used to like to 

669
00:32:13,351 --> 00:32:14,184
play tricks on them.
And so one trick would be to get some 

670
00:32:15,841 --> 00:32:17,340
poor son of a bitch who,
you know,

671
00:32:17,341 --> 00:32:20,490
being torn away from his country,
who'd had his family destroyed,

672
00:32:20,491 --> 00:32:21,324
who knew where he was going,
who was half dead for six different 

673
00:32:23,701 --> 00:32:25,290
reasons.
Who iS among strangers.

674
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:26,243
Maybe he dIdn't even speak or she didn't
even speak the language that was most 

675
00:32:29,311 --> 00:32:30,700
common there,
you know,

676
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:35,900
guarded by absolutely ruthless 
barbarians who wanted to do nothing else

677
00:32:35,971 --> 00:32:40,040
but make people as miserable as possible
in is in the most creative

678
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,873
possible ways.
And so what they would do with some of 

679
00:32:42,981 --> 00:32:45,770
the prisoners would say give them wet 
sacks of salt.

680
00:32:45,771 --> 00:32:46,604
and so those weigh about 100 pounds and 
they'd have them carry them from one 

681
00:32:49,821 --> 00:32:52,400
side of the compound to the other.
Well,

682
00:32:52,401 --> 00:32:55,100
you know,
that's not so bad when you're really,

683
00:32:55,101 --> 00:32:59,150
really Innovative in your capacity to 
perpetrate evil.

684
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:01,250
But the next thing they did was carried 
them back.

685
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,500
And so you think about that,
you know,

686
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,860
and this is something half to understand
if you really want to understand evil,

687
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:09,950
is that it's an aesthetic.
It's An art form.

688
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,953
You know.
And the reason that that was such a 

689
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:13,970
terrible torture was,
well,

690
00:33:13,971 --> 00:33:14,804
partly because these people were already
ruined and 100 pounds is a lot of salt 

691
00:33:18,051 --> 00:33:20,090
and maybe it was winter and they didn't 
have any shoes.

692
00:33:20,091 --> 00:33:22,130
And you know,
like it's just brutal labor.

693
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,653
But solzhenitsyn,
when he wrote about the gulag 

694
00:33:25,011 --> 00:33:26,090
archipelago,
he said,

695
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:27,520
you know,
even if you were a prisoner,

696
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,580
they were having you build a wall.
You can at least take some damn pride in

697
00:33:31,581 --> 00:33:32,690
building the wall.
You know,

698
00:33:32,691 --> 00:33:34,430
you could lay some bricks out and you 
can think,

699
00:33:34,431 --> 00:33:36,710
well this sucks and it's really horrible
and everything,

700
00:33:36,711 --> 00:33:39,770
but you know,
I built a straight wall that something.

701
00:33:39,771 --> 00:33:42,470
BuT if you have to take a sack of wet 
salt,

702
00:33:42,471 --> 00:33:45,020
the one side of the compound and then 
carry it back,

703
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:47,870
like the net consequence of that is 
zero,

704
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,980
right?
It's zero.

705
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:50,223
Then of course the famous signs on the 
outside of the concentration camps were 

706
00:33:55,430 --> 00:34:00,380
work will set you free right now.
That's another joke.

707
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:04,360
It's like mutual assured destruction,
you know,

708
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,500
and the only way you can,
you know,

709
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,960
a job like that is st stanek,
there's no other way to think about it.

710
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,003
The a job like that comes out of the 
deepest depths of human malevolence and 

711
00:34:17,991 --> 00:34:20,390
then the work that sets you free when it
wasn't even work,

712
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:21,140
right?
It was,

713
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:25,850
it was at parody of work and the purpose
of the work was to destroy you,

714
00:34:25,851 --> 00:34:30,851
but not quickly because that's not as 
terrible as destroying you slowly,

715
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,530
you know.
So these are very,

716
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:34,364
very terrible things.
And so part of what I thought about in 

717
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:39,650
relationship to people's belief systems 
was,

718
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:42,920
you know,
people are territorial chimps,

719
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:46,250
I don't know if you know this or not,
but chimps basically go to war.

720
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:50,630
Jane goodall diScovered that a couple of
decades ago and it really,

721
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:53,580
really was hard on her because she was 
kind of a ruse soviet.

722
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:54,883
So for those of you don't know joe,
john jacques rousseau is a french 

723
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:59,090
philosopher and,
you know,

724
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,720
french philosophers have a lawful lot of
sins on their conscience.

725
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,590
And then of course it was.
So,

726
00:35:03,591 --> 00:35:07,190
it was certainly one of them because 
russell was the first,

727
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,443
like what fully articulate promoter of 
the idea that human beings were 

728
00:35:11,451 --> 00:35:14,900
basically good.
So we know we had a good soul in a moral

729
00:35:14,901 --> 00:35:15,734
sense,
but we were corrupted by our social 

730
00:35:17,211 --> 00:35:19,400
institutions,
you know.

731
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:20,743
So,
uh,

732
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:23,571
so,
you know,

733
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:26,870
as far as russo was concerned,
it was kind of a noble savage idea.

734
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:27,704
You know,
like the human being in their raw form 

735
00:35:29,061 --> 00:35:30,540
has a pure soul.
And then you know,

736
00:35:30,541 --> 00:35:31,374
you,
you give them to parents and you've 

737
00:35:32,121 --> 00:35:32,954
given them to teachers and you know,
they'd get into politics and there's 

738
00:35:35,331 --> 00:35:37,560
group disputes and then they get all 
corrupted,

739
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,140
you know,
and well,

740
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:40,840
you know,
that's,

741
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,673
I don't even know what to say about that
except that it's absolutely moronic 

742
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,653
keynote.
But it's an appealing proposition if 

743
00:35:46,351 --> 00:35:47,490
you're naive optimist.

744
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:48,241
I mean,
first of all,

745
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:49,074
it doesn't explain where malevolence 
comes from because the people created 

746
00:35:52,291 --> 00:35:53,820
the institution.
So you know,

747
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:54,654
it just puts you into an infinite 
regress chicken and egg if the 

748
00:35:57,571 --> 00:36:00,900
institutions are reprehensible.
BUt the people who built them aren't.

749
00:36:00,901 --> 00:36:04,050
Then where did the reprehensible element
that the institutions come from,

750
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,093
you know,
he might think it's an autogenerated 

751
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,630
consequences of organizing people.
But you know,

752
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,770
it's a pretty specious theory.
So I'm of course hit.

753
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,060
He had a counterpart of philosophical 
counterpart,

754
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:18,060
Thomas Hobbs and hobbs said basically 
exactly the opposite,

755
00:36:18,061 --> 00:36:18,840
that,
you know,

756
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,673
people were vicious and cruel unless you
put them in straight jackets 

757
00:36:23,371 --> 00:36:24,204
fundamentally and made them obey.
Then everything was going to go 

758
00:36:26,761 --> 00:36:29,960
immediately to help you know.
And when,

759
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,350
when you saw what happened in Iran after
the americans won't stand in,

760
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,060
the power structure disintegrated,
you know,

761
00:36:35,061 --> 00:36:36,510
it was a hell of a lot more like hobbs.

762
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,880
Then it was like rousseau,
right?

763
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,380
You took out the,
the,

764
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,460
the,
the tyrant at the top.

765
00:36:41,461 --> 00:36:43,650
And it wasn't like everybody got all 
peaceful and loving.

766
00:36:43,651 --> 00:36:46,070
All of a sudden it was like absolute 
chaos reign.

767
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,160
So,
you know,

768
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,130
of course you can rationalize that.
But anyways,

769
00:36:50,131 --> 00:36:51,450
roost.
So by the way,

770
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:54,900
had five children by a made a 
illiterate,

771
00:36:54,901 --> 00:36:56,210
made that,
that it was as mr.

772
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:58,560
And he put every single one of them in 
orphanages where,

773
00:36:58,561 --> 00:36:59,394
of course they perished because 
orphanages at russo's times were not 

774
00:37:02,641 --> 00:37:03,960
exactly,
you know,

775
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:04,973
a luxury resort.
And even up until the beginning of the 

776
00:37:06,871 --> 00:37:09,780
20th century,
most children who are under one years of

777
00:37:09,781 --> 00:37:14,781
age who were in care institutions died 
partly disease and that sort of thing.

778
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:16,940
But often because they just weren't 
touched,

779
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:20,250
they weren't cared for physically.
Even if they were fed and you know,

780
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:22,320
200 years ago they weren't even fed.

781
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,570
So
anyway,

782
00:37:25,571 --> 00:37:26,940
so you know,
but nonetheless,

783
00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:28,080
you know,
people have people

784
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:34,440
maintain the optimistic idea that human 
beings were basically good and that they

785
00:37:34,441 --> 00:37:37,350
were corrupted by institutions.
It's a common idea among,

786
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,630
I think it's a very common idea in 
universities,

787
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:40,543
you know,
because university people are always 

788
00:37:41,701 --> 00:37:45,420
complaining about the corrupt nature of 
this institution and that institution,

789
00:37:45,421 --> 00:37:46,254
you know,
well they sit here in the warm with the 

790
00:37:48,961 --> 00:37:51,190
electricity on,
you know,

791
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,453
surrounded by wealth that characterizes 
maybe one 10th of one percent of the 

792
00:37:55,411 --> 00:37:56,244
entire world's population and you know,
they complained about how we'll press 

793
00:37:58,771 --> 00:38:01,130
they are and how will we get no nasty?
The institutions are,

794
00:38:01,131 --> 00:38:02,070
it's like,
yeah,

795
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,710
well you actually have been to a nasty 
institution,

796
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:08,940
cause nasty institutions.
They get pretty damn bad and most of the

797
00:38:08,941 --> 00:38:09,774
institutions in the world are like that.
So it isn't exactly clear that people 

798
00:38:13,801 --> 00:38:16,820
are pristine in their heart and then 
corrupted by institutions.

799
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,470
Although I'm sure that happens patent 
depends around,

800
00:38:19,471 --> 00:38:21,630
for example.
So anyways,

801
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:25,560
this has been a line of philosophical 
speculation.

802
00:38:25,561 --> 00:38:26,470
That's,
that's,

803
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:27,383
that's,
I would say constituted one of the 

804
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:34,360
unspoken fundamental assumptions of,
of western intellectuals in particular,

805
00:38:34,361 --> 00:38:36,230
and jane thought,
you know,

806
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,310
it'd be in many ways the same way she 
thought chimps were basically at all.

807
00:38:39,311 --> 00:38:41,350
They're just animals.
They are okay.

808
00:38:41,351 --> 00:38:45,490
They coexist relatively peacefully with 
one another,

809
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:46,660
you know,
even,

810
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,493
um,

811
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:54,180
Carl Rogers,
who I talk about a bit in my personality

812
00:38:54,181 --> 00:38:54,631
class,
you know,

813
00:38:54,631 --> 00:38:57,780
he basically thought that people were 
fundamentally good and that institutions

814
00:38:57,781 --> 00:38:59,620
make the badge.
But uh,

815
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:02,910
the problem is you look at chimps and a 
fair bit like us,

816
00:39:02,911 --> 00:39:04,300
you know,
bonobos,

817
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,510
you can look at them too,
and they're,

818
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:06,363
they're genetically quite related to us 
and they're quite a bit different than 

819
00:39:08,731 --> 00:39:09,301
chimps,
but.

820
00:39:09,301 --> 00:39:11,910
So we're sort of a weird mixture of the 
two in some sense.

821
00:39:11,911 --> 00:39:13,710
But champs,
like those things,

822
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,353
there is no evidence that they really 
have any internal control over the 

823
00:39:18,401 --> 00:39:20,220
regression at all.
You know,

824
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,083
there was a horrible case about two 
years ago where a woman was interacting 

825
00:39:24,601 --> 00:39:27,320
with the chimp and it tore her to pieces
and they can do that man.

826
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:32,040
Like it took her face right off and they
have the strength of about six men,

827
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:32,891
like an,
an,

828
00:39:32,891 --> 00:39:33,724
uh,
an adult male chimp can break a 300 

829
00:39:35,311 --> 00:39:37,210
pound test cable,
you know,

830
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:41,280
those things are really,
really strong and they are not friendly,

831
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,653
you know,
like.

832
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:43,703
So in arnhem zoo for example,
there's been a troop of chimps there 

833
00:39:49,051 --> 00:39:53,580
that have been followed by it,
extremely brilliant primatologists named

834
00:39:53,581 --> 00:39:56,190
frans de waal who's work I would very 
highly recommend.

835
00:39:56,191 --> 00:39:57,024
The wall is a very smart guy and he's 
looked at the origins of morality and 

836
00:39:59,551 --> 00:40:00,900
chimpanzees,
you know,

837
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,880
from a biological perspective,
it's very,

838
00:40:02,881 --> 00:40:03,930
very nice work,
very,

839
00:40:03,931 --> 00:40:05,520
very clearheaded.
But you know,

840
00:40:05,521 --> 00:40:09,870
he's recounted absolutely horrific 
stories of chimpanzee behavior.

841
00:40:09,871 --> 00:40:12,660
So one of the stories he talked about,
for example,

842
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:13,710
was,
you know,

843
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:16,740
when you kind of have this idea that 
there's a mail chimp hierarchy,

844
00:40:16,741 --> 00:40:18,870
it's roughly true.
There's a female hierarchy too,

845
00:40:18,871 --> 00:40:21,900
but the males and the chimp world 
anyways tend to be the dominant ones.

846
00:40:21,901 --> 00:40:22,734
And you know,
you kind of think of a dominant primate 

847
00:40:24,421 --> 00:40:25,890
like a prize fighter,
you know,

848
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,580
pretty much he's ruling because of his 
physical prowess.

849
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:32,010
Now that turns out not to exactly be 
true,

850
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,173
but in this particular case,
the guy who was running the chimp troop 

851
00:40:35,911 --> 00:40:38,670
was a bit of a bully and he wasn't very 
good at making friends,

852
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:39,803
you know,
and that's not such a good idea because 

853
00:40:41,011 --> 00:40:41,844
no matter how tough you are by yourself 
to weaker guys can probably take you 

854
00:40:44,431 --> 00:40:44,640
out.

855
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,473
And that's what happened during friends 
to wall observations and two chimps 

856
00:40:48,751 --> 00:40:51,210
attack the leader and they had a 
coalition.

857
00:40:51,211 --> 00:40:52,850
They were grooming each other.
They repels,

858
00:40:52,851 --> 00:40:54,840
you know,
in chimps are pretty good at remembering

859
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:59,160
like risk reciprocal relationships and 
having friendships really like they have

860
00:40:59,161 --> 00:41:00,840
a very highly social structure.
Hey,

861
00:41:00,841 --> 00:41:01,674
just tore him apart like the things they
did to him like you don't even want to 

862
00:41:03,991 --> 00:41:07,110
talk about.
And so chimps have really no upper limit

863
00:41:07,111 --> 00:41:09,930
on their capacity for aggression and 
when they hunt,

864
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,490
because chimps,
honda and they liked me,

865
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,300
they often call us monkeys and they 
weigh about 35 pounds,

866
00:41:15,301 --> 00:41:16,134
like a cola.
This monkeys a major league animal and 

867
00:41:17,311 --> 00:41:20,280
they eat those things alive and they 
scream while they're being killed.

868
00:41:20,281 --> 00:41:22,410
And that does not slow the chimps down 
one bit.

869
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,550
So it's not obvious that the chimp is 
really a creature of a lot of empathy,

870
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,900
especially the males.

871
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:28,943
The females are likely more empathic 
because they have to deal with infants 

872
00:41:31,231 --> 00:41:32,064
for longer periods of time.
What seems to inhibit the aggression of 

873
00:41:35,781 --> 00:41:38,540
mail chimp's isn't anything they hold 
internally.

874
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:41,270
It seems that when they get hyper 
aggressive in the truth,

875
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:44,210
the truth gets more and more agitated,
basically shuts them down.

876
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,780
So you can imagine maybe you're in a 
rough bar and some dingbat who is,

877
00:41:47,781 --> 00:41:48,614
you know,
half psychopathic and has had two pints 

878
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:51,374
of alcohol is starting to cause a 
tremendous amount of trouble and he's 

879
00:41:53,991 --> 00:41:56,960
not going to shut himself down,
but the rest of the troop might.

880
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:01,130
And that kind of means that the control 
over the aggression is externalized.

881
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,650
It's not a consequence of super ego 
control.

882
00:42:03,651 --> 00:42:07,070
And we like to think that we actually 
control our own aggression,

883
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:09,730
but I'm not so sure about that.
You know,

884
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:12,410
if you read things like there's a great 
book,

885
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:16,490
horrifying book published about 20 years
ago called the rape of nanking,

886
00:42:16,491 --> 00:42:19,310
which is while the woman who wrote it 
committed suicide.

887
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,143
So that sort of suffices to tell you 
what the rape of nan king is about and 

888
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:27,500
it's a story about the japanese in world
war ii going into a chinese kitty's city

889
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:31,370
called nan king where I believe about 
350,000 people were killed.

890
00:42:31,371 --> 00:42:34,080
And the nazis in that story where the 
good guys.

891
00:42:34,081 --> 00:42:37,520
So you can imagine the kind of brutality
that might be an been occurring there.

892
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:38,593
But there's absolutely perfectly well 
documented evidence suggesting that the 

893
00:42:42,471 --> 00:42:45,920
japanese soldiers engaged in competitive
brutality.

894
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,313
You know.
And so really what happened was the 

895
00:42:48,531 --> 00:42:49,364
japanese had been pretty militarized by 
world war two and nate adopted a 

896
00:42:52,251 --> 00:42:55,790
prussian education system and the 
prussians and the germans,

897
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:56,781
you know,
pre,

898
00:42:56,781 --> 00:42:57,614
pre 20th century germans,
they were basically interested in 

899
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:04,130
educating obedient soldiers,
you know,

900
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:04,993
because it was a militaristic culture 
and the japanese kind of adopted that 

901
00:43:07,131 --> 00:43:07,964
because they were sick of being kicked 
around by the europeans and pretty 

902
00:43:10,011 --> 00:43:12,170
successfully because they defeated the 
russians,

903
00:43:12,171 --> 00:43:13,004
you know,
in the early stages of rural or of the 

904
00:43:14,601 --> 00:43:15,290
20th century.

905
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:17,120
It wAs quite a shock to everyone in 
europe and,

906
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,790
you know,
cause for great celebration in Japan and

907
00:43:19,791 --> 00:43:20,870
no wonder.
But anyways,

908
00:43:20,871 --> 00:43:24,290
they militarize the hell out of their 
young men and taught them basically that

909
00:43:24,291 --> 00:43:26,420
the japanese were a master race,
you know,

910
00:43:26,421 --> 00:43:28,190
and that other people were subhuman.
It's,

911
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,470
it's a very common human way of 
thInking.

912
00:43:30,471 --> 00:43:31,304
By the way.
I would say it's really the default way 

913
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:36,650
that human tribes think about other 
tribes.

914
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:37,581
You know,
I mean,

915
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:38,414
it's a little more complicated than that
because human tribes tend to trade with 

916
00:43:41,871 --> 00:43:44,870
other tribes.
So it's not all demonization,

917
00:43:44,871 --> 00:43:46,100
but a lot of it is,
you know,

918
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:48,950
and if you look around the world in the 
anthropological literature,

919
00:43:48,951 --> 00:43:49,784
what you see Is that the names that most
tribes have for themselves is something 

920
00:43:53,811 --> 00:43:56,960
like that human beings or the people you
know,

921
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,600
indicating that the rest of the people 
are reading people,

922
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:00,463
god only they're barbarians or you know,
they live out where the sun is being 

923
00:44:03,351 --> 00:44:05,690
eaten by the dragon of the night or 
something like that.

924
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:07,970
And you know,
the word barbarian is a,

925
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:12,030
is a word that comes from the greeks 
making fun of how non-greek spoke,

926
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,820
you know,
they thought they went bar bar,

927
00:44:13,821 --> 00:44:14,331
bar,
bar,

928
00:44:14,331 --> 00:44:15,650
bar,
something like that.

929
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,320
So anyways,
what good.

930
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:19,880
All phone was that?
The chimps,

931
00:44:19,881 --> 00:44:22,380
like the chimp adolescents in particular
in particular,

932
00:44:22,381 --> 00:44:23,214
the males would patrol the borders of 
their territory in groups of three or 

933
00:44:28,581 --> 00:44:30,920
four and with often with a female or 
two,

934
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:32,970
but the females didn't seem to be really
the,

935
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,313
the,
the,

936
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,633
they weren't,
they were more part of the group rather 

937
00:44:37,411 --> 00:44:38,244
than the initiators.
But what the chimps would do is if they 

938
00:44:40,171 --> 00:44:41,004
found a chip from another troop,
even if that was a chimp that had moved 

939
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:47,670
from their troop in the not too distant 
past and joined another,

940
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,340
because sometimes the males leave and 
sometimes they go to other troops.

941
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,413
If they are numbered them,
they would tear them to pIeces and it 

942
00:44:53,971 --> 00:44:57,360
looked like that's why they were doing 
the border patrol.

943
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:00,690
They're looking for trouble there.
Gangs roughly speaking,

944
00:45:00,691 --> 00:45:02,650
they're looking for trouble.
But the point of it is,

945
00:45:02,651 --> 00:45:03,484
is that,
and they would only attack if they 

946
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:08,370
outnumbered because chimps can,
I wouldn't say they count,

947
00:45:08,371 --> 00:45:12,810
but they have a rudimentary notion of 
group size.

948
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:13,644
You know,
I don't think you can count without 

949
00:45:14,941 --> 00:45:17,760
being able to verbalize,
but you can estimate at a glance.

950
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,140
And so,
you know,

951
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:21,180
when I mean,
when I say tear apart,

952
00:45:21,181 --> 00:45:24,630
that's exactly what I mean.
There's no upper limit on the brutality.

953
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:29,370
And so good all discovered that first.
And she didn't tell anybody about it.

954
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:30,623
Now she had her reasons.
I mean some of them I think 

955
00:45:31,891 --> 00:45:33,870
radiological,
oh the lovely chimps,

956
00:45:33,871 --> 00:45:35,370
you know,
and fair enough.

957
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:40,320
But some of it was also she thought that
maybe the chimps had been corrupted as a

958
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:41,154
consequence of their contact with human 
beings and that their natural behavior 

959
00:45:43,681 --> 00:45:45,810
had been somehow transform,
you know,

960
00:45:45,811 --> 00:45:48,710
and that's not,
it's reasonable to be cautious if you're

961
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,400
a scientist before you go out and say,
hey,

962
00:45:50,401 --> 00:45:51,420
chimps go to war.

963
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,640
Isn't that revolutionary?
Because it is,

964
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:55,470
right?
Because it just,

965
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:59,370
it just ends.
The idea that our warlike and malevolent

966
00:45:59,371 --> 00:46:02,340
nature is a function of culture.
Like if chimps do it well,

967
00:46:02,341 --> 00:46:04,050
what did they perverted by their own 
culture?

968
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,700
I don't think so.
You know,

969
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,833
I mean there are more and less violent 
chimp cultures and there are more and 

970
00:46:10,411 --> 00:46:13,890
less violent baboons culture.
So there is some cultural variation.

971
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:14,753
But since goodall's time,
this sort of behavior is being 

972
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:19,470
documented on many,
many chimp troops.

973
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:25,160
So that's us in a nutshell and it's not 
self evident that if you put the typical

974
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,273
adolescent male say who's not a very 
well formulated personality and you 

975
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:32,890
know,
because he's not that individual and you

976
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,740
know,
he hasn't seen much of the world and the

977
00:46:34,741 --> 00:46:36,890
typical guy that goes into the army is,
you know,

978
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,300
he's kind of on the margins of society.

979
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:43,350
Maybe he's not particularly bright and 
I'm not trying to be insulting by that,

980
00:46:43,351 --> 00:46:45,960
but you know,
it's not exactly a high end job.

981
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,400
You put someone that like that either 
place where there's no rules.

982
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:55,590
It's like who leads where.
There are no rules while the probability

983
00:46:55,591 --> 00:46:57,840
that it's the friendliest,
nicest people is very,

984
00:46:57,841 --> 00:47:00,810
very low.
and so what seemed to happen in nan king

985
00:47:00,811 --> 00:47:01,644
was the japanese soldiers took their 
cues from the people with the most 

986
00:47:03,751 --> 00:47:06,960
brutal imaginations.
So you know,

987
00:47:06,961 --> 00:47:09,330
when people can have pretty brutal 
imaginations,

988
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:12,150
especially when they start to compete.
So,

989
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,640
so I was interested in that.
You know,

990
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:18,570
what exactly was at the core of that 
malevolence mean,

991
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:21,090
and I think it is uniquely human.
The chimps.

992
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:23,400
So go tear another chimp apart,
but basically they just,

993
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:24,630
they're just,
they're going to kill him,

994
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:25,523
you know,
that's their goal and maybe it takes a 

995
00:47:26,521 --> 00:47:28,830
while,
but it's not going to take four weeks.

996
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:30,453
Whereas if you're a human being,
you know you can draw out your enemies 

997
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,333
death for a very,
very long period of time and part of 

998
00:47:35,381 --> 00:47:36,214
that is the desire to produce the misery
and suffering that's attended on the 

999
00:47:38,861 --> 00:47:41,980
death and only human beings have the 
imagination to do that.

1000
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,470
That's why I think,
and we'll return to this.

1001
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,480
That's why I think that in the book of 
genesis,

1002
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:49,120
when people's eyes are open and they 
become self conscious,

1003
00:47:49,121 --> 00:47:49,954
they always are all always all solar.
Learn the difference between good and 

1004
00:47:52,991 --> 00:47:53,824
evil.
Once your eyes are open and you know 

1005
00:47:55,571 --> 00:47:56,404
what you're like,
once you know you're naked and 

1006
00:47:57,521 --> 00:47:58,354
vulnerable,
then you can exploit that in other 

1007
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:00,334
people.
And only human beings have that kInd of 

1008
00:48:02,111 --> 00:48:02,944
knowledge.
So the fact that we know that we can be 

1009
00:48:04,841 --> 00:48:08,960
hurt makes us particularly dangerous.
Because if I know how I can be heard,

1010
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:10,870
I sure know how you can be heard.

1011
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:12,363
So you know,
it's a nasty situation and then of 

1012
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:16,960
course I'm kind of interested in the 
motivation for that.

1013
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,033
So you know,
you look at the columbine kids for 

1014
00:48:19,061 --> 00:48:20,410
example,
and you know,

1015
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:21,363
the mayhem and they produced was trivial
compared to the mayhem they were 

1016
00:48:23,861 --> 00:48:25,090
planning.
You know,

1017
00:48:25,091 --> 00:48:25,924
if it was up to those two guys,
they would have bombed detroit flat 

1018
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:28,611
that,
you know,

1019
00:48:28,611 --> 00:48:29,444
they,
they had visions of doing exactly that 

1020
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,660
and it was immediate spectacular.
And they didn't do it because they were,

1021
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:35,733
you know,
poor kids in some sense who were 

1022
00:48:37,511 --> 00:48:39,700
bullied.
That is an idiotic explanation.

1023
00:48:39,701 --> 00:48:41,520
It's not true.
You know,

1024
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:43,810
everybody's at bloody outsider.
You know what I mean?

1025
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:44,763
I'm sure there isn't a single one of you
that don't have a memory from junior 

1026
00:48:47,711 --> 00:48:50,050
high where you were an outcast in one 
way or another,

1027
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:51,880
maybe some of the word,
but it's very,

1028
00:48:51,881 --> 00:48:52,714
very common.

1029
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:55,060
And to think of that as sufficient 
motivation to,

1030
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,073
you know,
shoot people cold bloodedly in high 

1031
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,840
highschool.
Sorry,

1032
00:48:58,841 --> 00:49:01,750
that's a little on the naive side.
So I'm very,

1033
00:49:01,751 --> 00:49:04,390
very interested in what makes up that 
motivation.

1034
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:07,930
You know,
because malevolence plus nuclear weapons

1035
00:49:07,931 --> 00:49:08,764
is not a good combination and so it 
doesn't really look to me like we can 

1036
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:12,574
afford that kind of unconscious 
malevolence anymore because we're just 

1037
00:49:15,551 --> 00:49:16,384
too damn powerful and if the wrong 
person ends up being like that with the 

1038
00:49:18,941 --> 00:49:21,040
wrong weapons,
it's like game's over.

1039
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:22,323
So
I've also become convinced while I'd 

1040
00:49:25,331 --> 00:49:26,164
been looking through this,
that the problem that we're discussing 

1041
00:49:28,481 --> 00:49:32,440
is not associate logical problem or a 
political problem or an economic problem

1042
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:33,363
because you know a lot of what you read 
and a lot of political scientists who 

1043
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:36,573
tell you this sort of thing because 
they're basically almost always closet 

1044
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:38,920
marxists.

1045
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,680
They'll tell you that the reason for for
struggle for competition between nations

1046
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:47,950
economic and I think that's observed not
because it isn't true,

1047
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:51,580
but because it doesn't actually address 
a more fundamental issue,

1048
00:49:51,581 --> 00:49:52,414
which is okay,
well economic struggle is a struggle 

1049
00:49:54,581 --> 00:49:55,414
about who has access to what's valued,
but there's nothing self evident about 

1050
00:50:00,551 --> 00:50:02,950
what's valued.
That's the problem.

1051
00:50:02,951 --> 00:50:05,320
It's like you know,
you have the idea of natural resource.

1052
00:50:05,321 --> 00:50:10,321
It's like oil is not a natural resource 
till you have an automobile.

1053
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,213
You know,
I mean the interplay between cultural 

1054
00:50:14,531 --> 00:50:15,760
values,
structures,

1055
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:20,490
and what constitutes a natural resources
so tightly put together except for maybe

1056
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:23,380
air and water that saying,
well,

1057
00:50:23,381 --> 00:50:24,214
there are natural resources which means 
things of intrinsic value and that's 

1058
00:50:27,231 --> 00:50:29,030
what people fight over.
Well,

1059
00:50:29,031 --> 00:50:29,830
you,
you,

1060
00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:30,663
you did,
you made the mystery mystery disappear 

1061
00:50:32,301 --> 00:50:35,570
inside the word natural resource,
but you haven't solved anything.

1062
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:37,400
So the question is,
well,

1063
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:39,860
why would people fight over things that 
they value?

1064
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:41,383
Well,
because there's all sorts of things you 

1065
00:50:42,291 --> 00:50:44,870
could value,
like peace for example.

1066
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:49,060
So it's not a suFficient explanation and
uh,

1067
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:50,923
and it's also not clear to me that 
people's primary motivations are 

1068
00:50:52,881 --> 00:50:54,170
economic.
you know,

1069
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:56,630
it's one element of motivation.
It's not trIvial,

1070
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:59,090
but I would say the motivation isn't 
even really economic.

1071
00:50:59,091 --> 00:51:01,820
It's more related to dominance,
hierarchy position.

1072
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:04,010
And that's fundamentally a sexual 
motivation,

1073
00:51:04,011 --> 00:51:06,830
especially for men because men are 
higher up in the dorm,

1074
00:51:06,831 --> 00:51:07,664
male dominance hierarchy,
then women are much more attracted to 

1075
00:51:09,261 --> 00:51:11,060
them.
so you could make,

1076
00:51:11,061 --> 00:51:12,710
you could say,
well that's economics.

1077
00:51:12,711 --> 00:51:13,544
I don't think it is.
So this economic is just a secondary 

1078
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:17,114
consequences of that.
And I don't believe by the way that 

1079
00:51:18,721 --> 00:51:19,554
that's a theory because there's 
excellent documentation on hyper 

1080
00:51:22,431 --> 00:51:23,264
aggression in adolescent males and the 
best evidence suggests that adolescent 

1081
00:51:26,901 --> 00:51:27,734
males become hyper aggressive when you 
put them in situations where they can't 

1082
00:51:30,261 --> 00:51:31,094
win and then they become hyper 
aggressive and ended attempt to 

1083
00:51:33,171 --> 00:51:34,004
formulate a dominance hierarchy so that 
some of them can rise to the top and 

1084
00:51:36,591 --> 00:51:37,424
basically be attractive.
So you can call that economic if you 

1085
00:51:40,941 --> 00:51:41,960
want.
But I think it's,

1086
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:45,950
I think you're pushing your luck with 
that sort of explanation so.

1087
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:49,430
Well.
So that's basically the background.

1088
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,173
So when I was investigating this,
I first started studying political 

1089
00:51:58,481 --> 00:51:59,360
science,
you know,

1090
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:00,213
and I actually liked that quite a bit in
the first couple of years because 

1091
00:52:01,771 --> 00:52:03,730
they're just basically reading political
philosophy,

1092
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,073
you know,
and it's actually worthwhile reading 

1093
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:07,023
great political philosophers because a,
they could think and that's a really 

1094
00:52:09,671 --> 00:52:10,960
good thing.
And b,

1095
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:13,810
you think like they think even if you 
don't know it,

1096
00:52:13,811 --> 00:52:14,644
right?
Because one of the hallmarks of a great 

1097
00:52:16,151 --> 00:52:16,984
philosopher is that his ideas or her 
ideas sink into the culture so deeply 

1098
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:24,640
that like 100 years after they've 
written,

1099
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,680
everybody just thinks they always 
thought that way.

1100
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,560
Like that'S one of the thIngs say that's
happened to freud.

1101
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:30,503
I mean everybody kind of understands 
that there's an unconscious and that 

1102
00:52:32,711 --> 00:52:34,790
people are motivated by sexual,
you know,

1103
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:36,430
sexual drive.
It's like,

1104
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:37,643
what?
So,

1105
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,260
you know,
what's so brilliant about that?

1106
00:52:40,310 --> 00:52:41,320
Like,
well yeah,

1107
00:52:41,321 --> 00:52:42,970
it's obvious ones.
Freud points it out.

1108
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:44,740
No.
So.

1109
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:55,880
So anyways,
I started,

1110
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,700
I took political science first and 
literature,

1111
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:03,350
which I found was also extremely useful 
because great literary people have great

1112
00:53:03,351 --> 00:53:04,184
things to say.
Like dostoevsky mean what his novels 

1113
00:53:07,911 --> 00:53:08,744
just absolutely flattened me.
He's so brilliant and I've never read 

1114
00:53:12,531 --> 00:53:14,840
anyone who takes moral question so 
seriously,

1115
00:53:14,870 --> 00:53:16,040
like.
So for example,

1116
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:17,623
if you look at crime and punishment,
which is a book I would highly 

1117
00:53:19,221 --> 00:53:20,054
recommend,
dostoevsky is the absolute model of a 

1118
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:24,373
true intellectual.
And I say that because in crime and 

1119
00:53:27,301 --> 00:53:28,134
punishment for example,
dostoevsky has this character named 

1120
00:53:31,681 --> 00:53:34,880
roscoe and off and you guys can identify
with risk.

1121
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:35,763
and the call to some degree because he's
about your age and he's a university 

1122
00:53:37,771 --> 00:53:40,080
student now.
He's having a rough time because he's in

1123
00:53:40,081 --> 00:53:40,914
st petersburg and he doesn't have any 
money and he lives in this tiny little 

1124
00:53:43,141 --> 00:53:43,974
room which has basically a bunch of 
clothes on the bed that he can sleep in 

1125
00:53:47,551 --> 00:53:48,570
and he's starving to death.

1126
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:49,753
It can only,
only has bread to eat and he's a law 

1127
00:53:51,211 --> 00:53:53,310
student so he's having a rough time,
you know,

1128
00:53:53,311 --> 00:53:54,144
in st petersburg,
the end of the nIneteenth century is 

1129
00:53:55,921 --> 00:53:57,330
kind of a rough place.
So he hasn't,

1130
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,490
some of you guys probably have is pretty
bad,

1131
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,500
but was calling the call.
I've had it pretty bad.

1132
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:04,260
And so he's half starved and half 
delirious.

1133
00:54:04,261 --> 00:54:06,060
And,
and he's also very,

1134
00:54:06,061 --> 00:54:06,894
his ideas are very adult because he's 
one of the first russians who really 

1135
00:54:10,471 --> 00:54:12,870
considered themselves an atheist.
So,

1136
00:54:12,871 --> 00:54:13,704
you know,
Russia was a medieval society until the 

1137
00:54:17,461 --> 00:54:18,780
late name,
19 hundreds.

1138
00:54:18,781 --> 00:54:22,290
it was sorta like quebec before 1950.
[inaudible] before 1960.

1139
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:23,693
And I'm serious about that because 
quebec was really the last european 

1140
00:54:26,341 --> 00:54:27,330
country,
so to speak,

1141
00:54:27,331 --> 00:54:28,164
that underwent a secularization.
And that happened in in about 1960 and 

1142
00:54:31,741 --> 00:54:32,574
quebec families went from an average 
size of about 12 to 13 to about one 

1143
00:54:35,641 --> 00:54:36,474
point two lowest birth rate in the world
and see all the quebecois while we're 

1144
00:54:38,941 --> 00:54:42,090
married and none of them are now and 
they were all catholic and hardly any of

1145
00:54:42,091 --> 00:54:44,340
them are now and was an overnight 
transformation.

1146
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:48,270
And that's partly what fed quebec 
nationalism because there was actually a

1147
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:49,533
study that was,
or a study that was released by gallup 

1148
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:52,823
organization.
I only heard it referred to in one 

1149
00:54:54,721 --> 00:54:58,550
meeting where they indicated that if you
were a lapsed catholic and in,

1150
00:54:58,620 --> 00:54:59,453
in,
in,

1151
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:00,563
in quebec,
you were 10 times more likely to be a 

1152
00:55:01,771 --> 00:55:04,260
separate that that's really worth 
thinking about,

1153
00:55:04,261 --> 00:55:05,094
right?
Because religion collapses and what 

1154
00:55:05,911 --> 00:55:06,744
happens is nationalism just rises up to,
to take its place because you'd need a 

1155
00:55:09,871 --> 00:55:11,700
bloody belief structure because what 
else?

1156
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:13,710
What are you going to do?
Wander around aimlessly.

1157
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,160
That's not fun.
It's not useless are useful,

1158
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:21,270
you know,
so you just jumped from one structure of

1159
00:55:21,271 --> 00:55:23,430
belief to another or you fall apart.
So.

1160
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:26,430
So that's also something that's very 
much worth knowing.

1161
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:29,010
Finding ways,
so all risk on the cog.

1162
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:29,993
He thinks he's a pretty educated guy and
he's pretty smart and he is pretty 

1163
00:55:32,401 --> 00:55:33,600
smart,
but he's like smart,

1164
00:55:33,601 --> 00:55:36,180
arrogant,
not smart wise because he's 21.

1165
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:37,013
What the hell does he know?
He doesn't know anything but he's smart 

1166
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:40,223
and he's contemptuous of other people 
because he can probably smarter than 

1167
00:55:43,111 --> 00:55:43,980
most of them,
you know,

1168
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:46,740
and he confuses that with health,
with knowing what's going on.

1169
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:51,810
And so he lives in this little horrible 
apartment and he has a horrible landlady

1170
00:55:51,811 --> 00:55:54,660
and she really like this is where is a 
genius.

1171
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,673
Like cove hates his landline and then 
dostoevsky tells you why and you'd 

1172
00:56:00,111 --> 00:56:01,320
think,
well yeah,

1173
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,780
I'd hate her too.
So she's

1174
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,700
miserable.
She owns a bunch of apartments.

1175
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:09,623
She charges too much rent for them.
She tortures all the people that rent 

1176
00:56:12,751 --> 00:56:16,260
from her in every possible way she can,
but places are filthy.

1177
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:20,550
She doesn't provide any furniture.
She hoards money and doesn't do anything

1178
00:56:20,551 --> 00:56:22,770
with it.
So she lives in absolute poverty and you

1179
00:56:22,771 --> 00:56:23,271
know,
and,

1180
00:56:23,271 --> 00:56:27,250
and in film and she's a cruel person in 
every possible way.

1181
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,590
Plus she has this nice who isn't very 
bright,

1182
00:56:29,591 --> 00:56:30,424
you know,
same intellectually impaired and she 

1183
00:56:31,061 --> 00:56:31,894
basically treats her like to slave so 
she's not doing anyone any good and 

1184
00:56:35,771 --> 00:56:36,604
that's where to nicholson and then he 
gets a letter from his mother and his 

1185
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,073
mother basically tells them that his 
sister is going to go marry this rich 

1186
00:56:44,111 --> 00:56:44,944
guy because she's in love with him and a
battle solve all of his monetary 

1187
00:56:49,571 --> 00:56:51,280
problems so he can keep going to law 
school,

1188
00:56:51,281 --> 00:56:52,900
but he reads between the lines and you 
know,

1189
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,610
he realizes pretty quiCkly that this 
rich guys are real like miserly scum rat

1190
00:56:57,611 --> 00:57:01,090
and he's going to treat his sister and 
his mother absolutely miserably.

1191
00:57:01,270 --> 00:57:02,103
And his sister doesn't really love in 
many Ways and the only reason she's 

1192
00:57:04,211 --> 00:57:06,400
marrying him so that risk all knockoff 
can go to school.

1193
00:57:06,550 --> 00:57:08,800
So he's not very happy with that and you
know,

1194
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,600
fair enough,
you know,

1195
00:57:10,601 --> 00:57:12,070
you can understand his motivation.

1196
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:14,500
So he starving and he's full of these 
ideas.

1197
00:57:14,501 --> 00:57:16,420
Also the sort of meat chicken,
you know,

1198
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:17,763
so and like atheistic ideas hit Russia 
really hard because it went from 

1199
00:57:23,561 --> 00:57:24,394
seriously orthodox christian and every 
possible way to unbelievably skeptical 

1200
00:57:27,701 --> 00:57:31,090
in one generation and it just,
it just fractured the society.

1201
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,073
It's partly why communism became so 
absolutely attractive for the russians 

1202
00:57:35,021 --> 00:57:35,854
and dostoevsky also details that 
extremely brIlliantly in a book called 

1203
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:42,370
the possessed of the devils.
So it's a wonderful book.

1204
00:57:42,371 --> 00:57:43,204
It's hard to get into.
You have to read about 200 pages before 

1205
00:57:44,951 --> 00:57:46,490
it really kicks in,
but you know,

1206
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:48,220
that's.
And all those sorta like that.

1207
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:52,510
So anyways,
risk on the curve is he's thinking these

1208
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:56,470
sort of superman ish rationalistic ideas
and he thinks,

1209
00:57:56,471 --> 00:57:57,304
well,
you know,

1210
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:58,173
there's no evidence that there's any 
real moral hierarchy and you can easily 

1211
00:58:02,171 --> 00:58:04,930
make a case that the reason that people 
aren't really moral,

1212
00:58:04,931 --> 00:58:06,100
they're just cowardly.

1213
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,290
And this is a nietzschean observation,
right?

1214
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:11,030
Most of what you call your morality 
isn't morality all.

1215
00:58:11,031 --> 00:58:11,864
It's just too,
you're too afraid to do what you want 

1216
00:58:12,821 --> 00:58:16,180
and because you're too,
we easily to admit that you say that you

1217
00:58:16,181 --> 00:58:17,950
don't do those things because your 
moral.

1218
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:18,963
but it isn't true.
You'd love to do them if you were brave 

1219
00:58:20,741 --> 00:58:21,670
enough,
you just aren't.

1220
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,013
So people misread that to say that what 
nisha thought was that all morality was 

1221
00:58:26,831 --> 00:58:28,600
cowardice.
that isn't what he thought.

1222
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:32,290
He thought that all cowardice 
masquerading as morality,

1223
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:34,600
that's a whole different thing.
So anyways,

1224
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:37,840
recall the call is thinking about these 
things and he's thinking,

1225
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:41,060
well I could be a lawyer and I'd be a 
good one.

1226
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:43,280
I'd help people.
I'd help the poor people you know,

1227
00:58:43,281 --> 00:58:44,114
and,
and what the hell good is it for me to 

1228
00:58:45,161 --> 00:58:48,250
wander around starving like this and it 
doesn't seem reasonable and,

1229
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:52,660
and my is going to go basically 
prostitute herself for this rich guy and

1230
00:58:52,661 --> 00:58:53,350
that sucks.

1231
00:58:53,350 --> 00:58:54,183
And there's my landlady and she's an 
absolutely reprehensible creature and 

1232
00:58:57,790 --> 00:59:01,630
everyone agrees and she's old and worn 
out and it's like,

1233
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:04,480
and she has this person,
she keeps us a slave.

1234
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:06,430
Although maybe I should just get rid of 
her.

1235
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:13,230
And what I love about that is that like
this happens almost all the time

1236
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:17,200
in universities,
I would say,

1237
00:59:17,201 --> 00:59:20,400
but it really between and whenever you 
hear people who think they're smart have

1238
00:59:20,401 --> 00:59:21,234
a discussion,
what they generally do is they have an 

1239
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:27,800
idea and then they have an idea about 
the person who has a different idea.

1240
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:29,293
And the idea about the person who has a 
different idea is that their idea is 

1241
00:59:32,061 --> 00:59:34,640
stupid.
And so what they do is they produce.

1242
00:59:34,641 --> 00:59:35,474
They're caricatures of that person's 
idea and then they blast it and they 

1243
00:59:39,681 --> 00:59:40,201
think,
wow,

1244
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:43,250
I won that argument,
which is really pathetic.

1245
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:44,630
It's a straw man argument.

1246
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:45,553
It's the sign of a weak mind.
What you do if you really want to have 

1247
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:50,180
an argument with someone is you help 
them.

1248
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,033
LIke let's say you're a right winger and
you're arguing with a left winger or 

1249
00:59:53,911 --> 00:59:55,820
you're a left winger and you're arguing 
with a right winger.

1250
00:59:55,821 --> 00:59:56,654
It's like
you want to make their argument as 

1251
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:03,971
magnificent as you possibly can and then
see If you can undermine it.

1252
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:06,163
That's what you do because then you're 
getting somewhere like any idiot can 

1253
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:15,290
make a straw man in light it.
Dostoevsky never does that.

1254
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:20,210
He makes the people that he's like,
when he sets up two ideas to go to war,

1255
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:21,913
he embodies both sets of ideas in the 
most powerful characters he could 

1256
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:25,754
imagine.
So in the brothers karamazov for 

1257
01:00:27,771 --> 01:00:29,990
example,
the two people,

1258
01:00:29,991 --> 01:00:30,824
the two protagonists basically there's a
bunch of them but one is named leo osha 

1259
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:38,030
and the other is named ivan and now osha
is kind of an innocent guy.

1260
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,550
Goodguide fundamentally a little on the 
naive side,

1261
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,060
religious but not in a way that he can 
defend,

1262
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:44,953
you know,
it's more of a natural expression of 

1263
01:00:46,131 --> 01:00:50,710
spirit and he's in a monastery and he's 
the follower of this famous monk and you

1264
01:00:50,711 --> 01:00:51,544
know,
he's kind of into orthodox christianity 

1265
01:00:53,391 --> 01:00:58,250
and his
benevolent and sincere way,

1266
01:00:58,390 --> 01:01:00,890
but he's not much of an intellect.
And ivan,

1267
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,780
his older brother,
like ivan's got everything.

1268
01:01:02,781 --> 01:01:04,040
He's good looking.
He's tall.

1269
01:01:04,041 --> 01:01:07,440
I believe he's a soldier.
Like he's an impressive guy and he's got

1270
01:01:07,441 --> 01:01:08,274
a viciously cutting intellect and he 
just tears leo shoW apart every chance 

1271
01:01:12,801 --> 01:01:14,750
he gets across the whole book and you 
know,

1272
01:01:14,751 --> 01:01:18,680
you can see the two parts of dostoevsky 
fighting it out in the book because part

1273
01:01:18,681 --> 01:01:19,514
of dostoevsky was highly spiritualized,
not least because he was epileptic and 

1274
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:24,583
that often for reasons we'll talk about 
later that often exaggerate 

1275
01:01:28,701 --> 01:01:31,700
spirituality,
but also because he was like,

1276
01:01:31,701 --> 01:01:32,534
he was a deeply spiritual person and 
also a tremendous intellect and so he 

1277
01:01:35,991 --> 01:01:40,610
was at war inside and he put those parts
of emoting into these characters and let

1278
01:01:40,611 --> 01:01:41,870
them just go at it.

1279
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:43,640
And it's brilliant.
You know,

1280
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:47,390
I even makes the best argument for 
atheism that's ever been written.

1281
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:49,700
It's really powerful.
You know,

1282
01:01:49,701 --> 01:01:51,770
he taught.
Basically what he does is he talks about

1283
01:01:51,771 --> 01:01:52,604
all these terrible things that were 
being done to children in Russia at the 

1284
01:01:54,921 --> 01:01:57,220
turn of the century.
Back in the late 19,

1285
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:59,360
18 hundreds.
You know,

1286
01:01:59,361 --> 01:02:00,194
he talks about this one situation where 
the parents of this young girl locked 

1287
01:02:03,351 --> 01:02:04,184
her in a freezing out house overnight 
and she was crying and screaming and 

1288
01:02:07,281 --> 01:02:08,114
telling them that she was sorry,
and they just left her in there and she 

1289
01:02:09,651 --> 01:02:13,640
froze to death and it was like front 
page news and in Russia at the time,

1290
01:02:13,641 --> 01:02:18,020
I guess probably in moscow or maybe in 
st petersburg and dostoevsky lifted that

1291
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:21,710
argument.
TheN said to he had ivan asked leo ships

1292
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:22,321
like,
okay,

1293
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:25,680
well thIs is the sort of thing god 
permits.

1294
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:27,360
okay.
He said,

1295
01:02:27,361 --> 01:02:28,194
the whole damn world isn't worth that.
The suffering of one child in a 

1296
01:02:30,391 --> 01:02:31,224
situation like that,
how can you possibly see that something 

1297
01:02:33,481 --> 01:02:34,314
like that can exist and wander around 
with your bone headed belief in a 

1298
01:02:36,931 --> 01:02:37,764
benevolent god what's up with you?
Would you like a girl in our house 

1299
01:02:40,711 --> 01:02:44,130
overnight and let her freeze if that 
meant that other people would be happy,

1300
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:44,790
you know?
And,

1301
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:46,200
and of course ldl osha says,
well,

1302
01:02:46,201 --> 01:02:47,340
no,
I would never do that.

1303
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:48,930
And so I even tell some,
well,

1304
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:49,764
yeah,
you know,

1305
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:50,933
you wouldn't do that,
but this god that you imagined exists 

1306
01:02:53,101 --> 01:02:56,040
would be perfectly pleased to let 
something like that occur.

1307
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:58,080
You know,
ellie osha has no idea what to say about

1308
01:02:58,170 --> 01:03:00,180
god and you're either that,
you know,

1309
01:03:00,181 --> 01:03:02,070
that's just a fragment of ivan's 
argument.

1310
01:03:02,071 --> 01:03:04,950
He's like punching at him like map,
you know.

1311
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:05,993
And I think the way on the osha 
basically responds is by trying to live 

1312
01:03:08,431 --> 01:03:09,630
a good life,
you know,

1313
01:03:09,631 --> 01:03:10,464
he can't,
he can argue are even better at it than 

1314
01:03:14,941 --> 01:03:15,774
he is in.
Plus there's this vicious strain of 

1315
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,593
critical thinking about religion,
religion that's being lost it in from 

1316
01:03:21,781 --> 01:03:22,710
western europe.
You know,

1317
01:03:22,711 --> 01:03:25,950
there's 300 years of philosophical force
behind it.

1318
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:26,993
And ivan is its mouth bass.
It's like ellie osha and Russia itself 

1319
01:03:29,821 --> 01:03:33,660
is just blown apart by that.
They have no defense against that.

1320
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:34,793
You know,
the bloody western europeans had 300 

1321
01:03:36,061 --> 01:03:36,894
years to get used to it.
The russians had like 10 years solely 

1322
01:03:40,330 --> 01:03:42,620
just frank fragmented them,
you know?

1323
01:03:42,630 --> 01:03:45,630
And they were like waiting for the new 
messiah and they sure got one.

1324
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:49,020
I know.
And both dostoevsky and in each.

1325
01:03:49,021 --> 01:03:49,854
You prophesied about what would happen 
in Russia for 40 years before it 

1326
01:03:53,341 --> 01:03:56,850
happened.
That's bloody amazing to be,

1327
01:03:56,851 --> 01:04:00,330
to think that you could look that far in
the future and actually get it right.

1328
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:01,200
You know,
I mean,

1329
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,420
things didn't change quite as fast and 
as they are now,

1330
01:04:03,421 --> 01:04:05,730
but you know,
it wasn't like victoria,

1331
01:04:05,731 --> 01:04:07,950
the victorian times were static,
you know,

1332
01:04:07,951 --> 01:04:11,340
there were a lot of things going on and 
so to get that right over four decades,

1333
01:04:11,341 --> 01:04:12,174
it's,
those guys were in touch with something 

1334
01:04:13,531 --> 01:04:17,100
very deep that was going on underneath 
the substrata of,

1335
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:19,350
of,
of western civilization.

1336
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:21,113
So.

1337
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:25,170
All right,
so you know,

1338
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:29,490
I'm thinking about belief structures and
I'm thinking about mlevel incident.

1339
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:30,324
I'm thinking about
the psychological role that these sorts 

1340
01:04:35,281 --> 01:04:36,750
of things are playing,
you know,

1341
01:04:36,751 --> 01:04:40,550
because it occurred to me at some point 
something like an idea,

1342
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:43,740
something like this.
And this actually tormented me for about

1343
01:04:43,741 --> 01:04:44,574
six months I would say,
when I'd been thinking these things 

1344
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,424
through.
and I guess it was for probably five 

1345
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:50,460
years at this point.
And I was really obsessed by it.

1346
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:51,433
I was thinking about this literally 
every minute of the day from the time I 

1347
01:04:54,661 --> 01:04:59,370
woke up until the time I went to sleep.
It was really manic probably.

1348
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:01,740
But so I,
I got,

1349
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:04,170
I got at one point I got to this 
conclusion.

1350
01:05:04,171 --> 01:05:04,711
I thought,
okay,

1351
01:05:04,711 --> 01:05:05,544
well here's the situation.
It'S pretty obvious that people need 

1352
01:05:08,941 --> 01:05:09,774
belief structures because first of all,
a belief structure orients them to 

1353
01:05:12,601 --> 01:05:13,950
action,
right?

1354
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:17,730
So you have to believe that one thing is
more valuable than another just to af.

1355
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:20,020
Right?
So why did the chicken cross the road?

1356
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:21,523
Well,
it's because he thought the other side 

1357
01:05:22,121 --> 01:05:24,010
of the road was better than this.
It was on.

1358
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:25,350
Obviously,
you know,

1359
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:30,360
because whenever you're moving,
the implicit hypothesis of your movement

1360
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:31,594
is that the thing you're moving towards 
is better than the thing you're leaving 

1361
01:05:34,170 --> 01:05:35,003
and you know,
unless you're self destructive because 

1362
01:05:35,981 --> 01:05:39,460
otherwise why bother?
And so what that means is you don't move

1363
01:05:39,461 --> 01:05:42,610
without a value structure and you don't 
get to not have one.

1364
01:05:42,611 --> 01:05:43,121
You might say,
well,

1365
01:05:43,121 --> 01:05:44,590
I don't believe in anything.
It's like,

1366
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:47,950
well no.
You say you don't believe in anything.

1367
01:05:49,330 --> 01:05:50,163
So technically you can't make an 
argument for what you believe or you 

1368
01:05:53,801 --> 01:05:54,634
don't know what you believe,
but if you're not just sitting there 

1369
01:05:57,580 --> 01:05:58,413
vegetating than you believe something 
because otherwise because you act it 

1370
01:06:02,501 --> 01:06:03,320
out,

1371
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:05,270
right?
So

1372
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,500
you have to have a belief system

1373
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:12,920
or,
or you fall apart.

1374
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:14,230
Right?

1375
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:16,420
So your nihilistic or depressed or 
hopeless?

1376
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:20,290
Not certainly like who wants that?
That's not good.

1377
01:06:20,291 --> 01:06:23,020
It's painful.
Depression is no joke.

1378
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:24,613
No.

1379
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,193
I know someone who had a very,
very serious illness is an illness that 

1380
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:30,913
destroyed parts of this person's body,
destroyed their joints and they were 

1381
01:06:33,651 --> 01:06:38,540
also had clinical depression.
And I asked this person at one point,

1382
01:06:38,541 --> 01:06:39,320
okay,
you get to get,

1383
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:40,153
you get to have a choice.
You can get rid of the illness that's 

1384
01:06:41,301 --> 01:06:42,134
destroying your joints.
So they had to be replaced or you can 

1385
01:06:44,151 --> 01:06:44,984
get rid of the depression.
He said I'd get rid of the depression 

1386
01:06:47,421 --> 01:06:48,254
first.
No problem.

1387
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:50,270
So that's where thinking about,
right?

1388
01:06:50,271 --> 01:06:52,670
So if you believe nothing,
you're hopeless,

1389
01:06:52,671 --> 01:06:56,060
you've got no values structure to place 
you end up is not good.

1390
01:06:56,450 --> 01:06:58,760
And I'm sure lots of you have 
experienced that.

1391
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:00,560
You know,
I mean most people,

1392
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:03,140
especially the people who are likely to 
come to this class,

1393
01:07:03,410 --> 01:07:05,810
most people by the time they're your 
age,

1394
01:07:05,811 --> 01:07:08,210
I've gone through a dark period or to,
you know,

1395
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:11,690
for whatever reason relationship breaks 
up or maybe you lose the meaning in your

1396
01:07:11,691 --> 01:07:15,240
life for someone betrays you or someone 
gets sick or you get sick or you know,

1397
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:17,600
some tragedy comes along and knocks you 
flat.

1398
01:07:17,870 --> 01:07:18,920
You think,
what the hell?

1399
01:07:18,950 --> 01:07:21,230
What's going on?
Why is any of this worthwhile?

1400
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:23,390
And it's a good question.
Okay,

1401
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:26,090
but you can't go there because that's 
like death.

1402
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:27,800
while then the other problem is,
well,

1403
01:07:27,801 --> 01:07:30,130
let's say you do have a belief system.
All right,

1404
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:31,640
so what happens if I have a different 
one?

1405
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:33,583
What are we supposed to do about that?
You can't give up yours because then 

1406
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:38,263
you're done.
I'm not going to give up mine for the 

1407
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:40,154
sAme reason,
but it isn't clear that we can inhabit 

1408
01:07:41,991 --> 01:07:46,010
the same part of the earth peacefully if
we don't believe the same things.

1409
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:48,410
So I,
when I sorted that oUt,

1410
01:07:48,411 --> 01:07:48,830
I thought,
oh,

1411
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:50,270
well that'S it man.
We're baSically,

1412
01:07:50,271 --> 01:07:51,140
that's it.
We'Re done.

1413
01:07:51,141 --> 01:07:55,400
Because you can't not have a belief 
system and if you have one you can't not

1414
01:07:55,401 --> 01:08:00,080
fight and we're too well armed to fight 
now and we're not jUSt going to collapse

1415
01:08:00,081 --> 01:08:00,914
into nihilism,
although you know that happens quite a 

1416
01:08:02,151 --> 01:08:03,860
bit.
So games over.

1417
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:07,610
Well,
it turned out that that was wrong,

1418
01:08:07,611 --> 01:08:08,444
thank god,
but it took me an awful long time to 

1419
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:10,543
even begin to understand how it could 
possibly be wrong because as far as I 

1420
01:08:12,981 --> 01:08:14,570
could tell,
those were the options.

1421
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:17,413
So another thing we're going to try to 
figure out is not only you know exactly 

1422
01:08:20,631 --> 01:08:21,464
why it people have belief systems 
exactly what a belief system is and why 

1423
01:08:25,491 --> 01:08:28,370
they compete and why you can't just get 
rid of them,

1424
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:32,150
but we're also going to figure out what 
it is that you might be able to do about

1425
01:08:32,151 --> 01:08:32,984
the fact that you're going to inhabit 
places with people who don't have 

1426
01:08:35,091 --> 01:08:38,330
exactly the same belief system as you 
know.

1427
01:08:38,331 --> 01:08:41,860
And in some sense it's really the 
problem with social being right.

1428
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:45,740
And creatures have been trying to solve 
this problem ever since.

1429
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:48,080
Well,
we don't know for how long I like to use

1430
01:08:48,081 --> 01:08:48,914
lobsters as an example because lobsters 
arrange themselves into dominance 

1431
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:55,700
hierarchies and they have very complex 
social behavior and they don't have much

1432
01:08:55,701 --> 01:08:57,560
of a brain,
so you can.

1433
01:08:57,590 --> 01:09:00,910
You can have pretty damn complex social 
behavior without having much of a brain.

1434
01:09:00,910 --> 01:09:04,010
And lobsters have been around for 400 
million years.

1435
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:09,640
So us roughly speaking because we had To
shared ancestor with a lobster,

1436
01:09:10,221 --> 01:09:11,510
you know,
a very long time ago.

1437
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:12,463
We've been trying to figure out how to 
coexist with other creatures that don't 

1438
01:09:15,411 --> 01:09:16,244
precisely share our belief systems for 
400 million years and we'd been 

1439
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:24,530
sufficiently successful about it so that
we're both social and here we are.

1440
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:27,650
So obviously there's ways that it can be
dealt with.

1441
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:31,430
Although I don't think we necessarily 
understand them very well and part of.

1442
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:36,010
So I didn't want to just understand what
it was about belief systems,

1443
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:38,450
you know,
about their necessity and their function

1444
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:40,600
and the way that they become 
pathologist.

1445
01:09:40,970 --> 01:09:41,803
I wanted to figure out if there was also
a pattern to the processes by which 

1446
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:46,093
belief systems are modified and 
negotiated so that the belief systems 

1447
01:09:50,751 --> 01:09:55,190
that have different structures can 
coexist in the same place peacefully and

1448
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,360
it's a vital question,
right?

1449
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:00,140
Because most of you are going to get 
married successfully or unsuccessfully,

1450
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:01,243
and even if you don't,
you're going to live with someone for a 

1451
01:10:02,721 --> 01:10:03,554
long period of time and you're gonna.
Find out that they're not like you and 

1452
01:10:05,871 --> 01:10:09,170
that's extremely annoying,
but you know what are you going to do?

1453
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:10,423
You're either gonna be a slave or a 
tyrant or you're going to negotiate 

1454
01:10:15,230 --> 01:10:16,063
because those are your options and 
negotiation is extraordinarily 

1455
01:10:18,891 --> 01:10:19,581
difficult,
right?

1456
01:10:19,581 --> 01:10:22,400
Because you have to figure out what you 
want and probably won't even admit it,

1457
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:23,713
and second of all,
you have to listen to your stupid 

1458
01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:25,703
partner telling you what they want and 
then you have to try to figure out how 

1459
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:30,160
you're going to make both of them 
possibly.

1460
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:32,750
Well,
slavery,

1461
01:10:32,751 --> 01:10:33,584
tyranny.
That's comparatively easy from a 

1462
01:10:35,091 --> 01:10:35,924
cognitive perspective compared to 
actually trying to figure out How you 

1463
01:10:38,391 --> 01:10:40,730
can be mutually satisfied in the same 
space,

1464
01:10:41,030 --> 01:10:42,590
but you can do it.

1465
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:44,053
That's the thing.
There is a process and it's 

1466
01:10:46,941 --> 01:10:47,774
identifiable,
so I want to talk to you about belief 

1467
01:10:50,421 --> 01:10:52,940
systems and their psychological 
significance,

1468
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:55,190
what they're like,
what function they perform,

1469
01:10:55,191 --> 01:10:59,960
but I also want to talk to you about how
they transform because they do,

1470
01:10:59,961 --> 01:11:00,794
right?
They changed especially with humans so 

1471
01:11:02,541 --> 01:11:03,374
they can change.
That means they can modify and that 

1472
01:11:05,241 --> 01:11:08,000
means at least in principle,
that we could have a dialogue.

1473
01:11:09,050 --> 01:11:10,880
Now dialogue is,
and that's rough,

1474
01:11:10,881 --> 01:11:13,350
but the alternative is war.
Right?

1475
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:14,803
And that's partly why you're supposed to
listen to your enemy because if you 

1476
01:11:17,551 --> 01:11:20,390
don't listen to your enemy,
the only other thing that you

1477
01:11:20,450 --> 01:11:23,200
can do is fight with them.
That's it.

1478
01:11:36,050 --> 01:11:38,060
You mean it's the desire for that to 
happen?

1479
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:39,673
Well,
I would say it's partly the desire for 

1480
01:11:41,421 --> 01:11:42,254
that to happen.
The thing is whenever I look at a 

1481
01:11:43,461 --> 01:11:46,880
political movement,
especially the ideological,

1482
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:49,340
I think,
okay,

1483
01:11:49,341 --> 01:11:53,270
there's a bunch of things your for fine.
What are you against?

1484
01:11:54,170 --> 01:11:55,003
You know,
because one of the things that people 

1485
01:11:55,941 --> 01:11:59,210
who adopted maybe theological position 
like to presume is that all of the right

1486
01:11:59,211 --> 01:12:03,890
is on their side and that makes them 
very unconscious up their shadow,

1487
01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:04,783
let's say from a union perspective.
The nazis had all sorts of positive 

1488
01:12:07,761 --> 01:12:11,510
reasons for what they were doing,
but you know,

1489
01:12:11,511 --> 01:12:12,344
the negative reasons were there too and 
you could easily make a case that the 

1490
01:12:14,661 --> 01:12:16,700
negative reasons were really the 
reasons.

1491
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:18,860
And when I look at ideologues,
I always think,

1492
01:12:18,861 --> 01:12:19,610
yeah,
yeah,

1493
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:22,020
that's what you're for sure.
But I,

1494
01:12:22,021 --> 01:12:24,950
I don't believe all the good people are 
on your site and be.

1495
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:27,920
I know that negative motivations are 
more powerful than positive ones.

1496
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:31,460
So you say you're for things,
but you're against them too.

1497
01:12:31,461 --> 01:12:33,200
So let's,
let's start with that.

1498
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:38,210
So I thought I started thinking about 
this after I read george orwell.

1499
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:40,080
I love george orwell,
by the way.

1500
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,620
How many of you know who george orwell 
is?

1501
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:44,150
Wow.
Really?

1502
01:12:44,870 --> 01:12:46,640
That's impressive.
How many don't?

1503
01:12:48,590 --> 01:12:49,181
Okay,
well that's,

1504
01:12:49,181 --> 01:12:50,510
that's good.
That's amazing.

1505
01:12:50,511 --> 01:12:51,344
I'm like,
how the hell did you learn about george 

1506
01:12:52,971 --> 01:12:53,870
orwell?
Is it 19,

1507
01:12:53,871 --> 01:12:56,060
84?
Fundamentally or animal farm?

1508
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:58,010
Animal farm.
Okay.

1509
01:12:58,011 --> 01:13:00,080
Okay.
Well that's good because george orwell,

1510
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:00,831
man,
I tell you,

1511
01:13:00,831 --> 01:13:01,664
george orwell was the first western 
intellectual who figured out what the 

1512
01:13:04,791 --> 01:13:08,750
hell was going on in the soviet union.
And he did that in the mid forties,

1513
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:10,240
early,
you know,

1514
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:11,083
it was complicated because we sort of 
knew what was happening in the twenties 

1515
01:13:14,601 --> 01:13:15,560
and the thirties,
you know,

1516
01:13:15,561 --> 01:13:17,060
there was len and then that wasn't so 
good.

1517
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:17,893
There was the russian civil war,
there was the idea of universal 

1518
01:13:20,691 --> 01:13:23,250
communism that wasn't such a good idea,
you know,

1519
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:24,193
for,
as far as people who didn't want to be 

1520
01:13:24,861 --> 01:13:25,694
communists were concerned.
And then there was what happened in the 

1521
01:13:27,591 --> 01:13:29,330
Ukraine in the 1930.
So it was like,

1522
01:13:29,770 --> 01:13:31,670
you know,
the evidence was starting to pile up.

1523
01:13:31,671 --> 01:13:32,504
But unfortunately what happened was the 
spanish civil war and the lefties were 

1524
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:39,500
pretty much the good guys in the spanish
civil war.

1525
01:13:39,530 --> 01:13:40,363
Right.
It was like a microcosm of the second 

1526
01:13:42,291 --> 01:13:43,124
world war.
The lefties were fighting the fascists 

1527
01:13:45,710 --> 01:13:46,543
and some of the lefties were communists,
but a lot of them were also people who 

1528
01:13:49,251 --> 01:13:50,084
were,
I think genuinely fighting for freedom 

1529
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:52,603
and a lot of north american literary 
figures went to Spain to fight on the 

1530
01:13:56,271 --> 01:13:58,580
side of the,
you know,

1531
01:13:58,581 --> 01:14:00,710
against the fascists.
And so faIr enough,

1532
01:14:00,711 --> 01:14:01,491
you know,
the fascist,

1533
01:14:01,491 --> 01:14:03,680
we're obviously,
you know,

1534
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:05,203
reprehensible clearly and so and so that
kind of muddied the water right because 

1535
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:11,500
the fastest were bad.

1536
01:14:11,500 --> 01:14:13,450
And then that sort of means that people 
that are fighting them,

1537
01:14:13,451 --> 01:14:16,090
their guard and some of them are 
communists and there was good.

1538
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:20,980
There is pretty good reason for people 
to be radical socialist at that point in

1539
01:14:20,981 --> 01:14:25,330
human history because the plIght of the 
working man was relatively unpleasant.

1540
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:26,493
George orwell wrote a book called road 
to wigan pier and he went up to this 

1541
01:14:31,091 --> 01:14:31,924
town that was a coal mining town and he,
he stayed with the coal miners for 

1542
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:37,600
awhile and just looked at their life.
So here,

1543
01:14:37,601 --> 01:14:42,601
here's pArt of their life.
So you basically work a seven and a half

1544
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,200
hour shift when you're a coal miner and 
you think,

1545
01:14:44,201 --> 01:14:46,420
oh,
that's not too bad by 1930 standards.

1546
01:14:46,421 --> 01:14:47,254
it's like,
yeah,

1547
01:14:47,890 --> 01:14:52,810
except you have to go down to the coal 
mine tunnels,

1548
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:56,290
you know,
and like they're not eight feet high and

1549
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:57,124
carpeted there like four and a half feet
high and rough and poorly lit and the 

1550
01:15:00,451 --> 01:15:01,284
air is terrible.

1551
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:02,463
And so basically you have to chimp walk 
or crawl up to three miles just to get 

1552
01:15:09,701 --> 01:15:10,534
to work and then you have to do that at 
the end of your shift and you don't get 

1553
01:15:14,141 --> 01:15:15,310
paid for that.
That's just,

1554
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:18,130
that's your Commute,
right?

1555
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:19,960
Right.
So you know,

1556
01:15:19,961 --> 01:15:20,794
it was no bloody well.
and then of course what you're doing 

1557
01:15:22,121 --> 01:15:24,430
when you get there,
it's like it's absolutely filthy.

1558
01:15:24,431 --> 01:15:27,160
It's unbelievably noisy.
It's brutally difficult.

1559
01:15:27,161 --> 01:15:30,610
He said coal miners,
they have no teeth because they're like,

1560
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:31,683
because of their living conditions,
but their bodies were absolutely 

1561
01:15:33,851 --> 01:15:34,684
perfect.
They were unbelievably powerful and 

1562
01:15:36,041 --> 01:15:40,090
strong because all they did was 
incredibly intense physical labor,

1563
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:42,430
but it was bloody rough.
ANd the housing,

1564
01:15:42,431 --> 01:15:47,431
those people had like
50 families for one outhouse,

1565
01:15:48,020 --> 01:15:48,853
that's probably good enough to describe 
it and often they were row houses and 

1566
01:15:52,361 --> 01:15:53,194
the row houses had no back doors that 
they had no paths between them and all 

1567
01:15:56,591 --> 01:15:57,940
the old houses were at the back.

1568
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:01,240
So that meant if you were with like 20 
below and it was the winter and you were

1569
01:16:01,241 --> 01:16:02,074
sick,
then you get to go all the way around 

1570
01:16:02,951 --> 01:16:03,784
the block to your damn outhouse.
Or maybe there'S only one there and you 

1571
01:16:06,431 --> 01:16:08,290
light up with 50 people.
So that you know.

1572
01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:11,520
Yeah.
So an orwell,

1573
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:14,350
he was orwell was an upper class guy 
basically,

1574
01:16:14,351 --> 01:16:15,184
and he was trying to help themselves 
overcome these upper class prejudices 

1575
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:19,363
and who is a real documentary,
one of the terrible working conditions 

1576
01:16:22,601 --> 01:16:23,434
of,
of,

1577
01:16:23,470 --> 01:16:24,303
of working class people.
And he wrote this book called road to 

1578
01:16:26,711 --> 01:16:30,190
wigan pier.
But one of the things that orwell said,

1579
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:33,490
he wrote this story about these poor god
damn coal miners.

1580
01:16:33,491 --> 01:16:35,200
and you think,
well yeah.

1581
01:16:35,201 --> 01:16:36,034
It's like how about some social 
legislation so that these people In 

1582
01:16:38,451 --> 01:16:41,770
their children aren't just absolutely 
brutalized nonstop?

1583
01:16:41,850 --> 01:16:42,683
No.
But then he wrote the last half of the 

1584
01:16:44,201 --> 01:16:46,690
book and he wrote it for the left book 
club,

1585
01:16:46,691 --> 01:16:49,480
which was a socialist group that the 
publisher book every month or so.

1586
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:53,650
And what he did was he.
He wrote a critique of socialism,

1587
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:56,080
a pretty socialism.
And he said,

1588
01:16:56,350 --> 01:16:57,790
yeah,
well this sucks man.

1589
01:16:57,791 --> 01:17:01,210
It's like we should be on The.
Sorry to these working people,

1590
01:17:01,211 --> 01:17:02,044
but the socialists,
I mean they're not on the side of the 

1591
01:17:03,311 --> 01:17:04,144
working people.
They're like tweed wearing middle class 

1592
01:17:06,820 --> 01:17:07,653
hyper intellectuals who never go 
anywhere near the working class because 

1593
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:11,143
of their class.
Prejudice isn't for all sorts of other 

1594
01:17:12,471 --> 01:17:14,390
reasons and they don't like the poor at 
all.

1595
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:15,313
They just hate the rich.
And I thought I'd been a member of the 

1596
01:17:18,891 --> 01:17:20,540
ndp for a long time.
At that point.

1597
01:17:20,541 --> 01:17:23,610
It was always something a little off 
about is especially the more radical and

1598
01:17:23,611 --> 01:17:24,444
that works with you guys.
Like it just doesn't look like 

1599
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:31,340
benevolence as far as I can tell.
There's a lot of whining and complaining

1600
01:17:31,341 --> 01:17:32,420
and resentment.
It's like,

1601
01:17:32,421 --> 01:17:33,530
whAt's that?
What's that about?

1602
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:36,890
I read orwell and I thought,
right,

1603
01:17:39,410 --> 01:17:40,243
if you hate the successful,
if you hate the rich who were rich by 

1604
01:17:42,981 --> 01:17:44,690
the way is whoever has more money than 
you.

1605
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:49,700
That's how you defined rich,
and the best way to mask your resentment

1606
01:17:49,701 --> 01:17:51,560
is to pretend that you're on the side of
the poor.

1607
01:17:51,950 --> 01:17:55,250
And are I read that.
I thought that's exactly right.

1608
01:17:55,251 --> 01:17:56,084
And then that's part of also what made 
me psychoanalytically oriented because 

1609
01:17:58,821 --> 01:18:03,821
one thing psychoanalysts always do 
always is if you say you're,

1610
01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:08,930
here's how I'm positively predisposed.
The psychoanalyst says,

1611
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:14,700
how are you using that to mask something
easy and malevolent that you're doing?

1612
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:17,400
And that's always,
that's a very,

1613
01:18:17,401 --> 01:18:19,560
very useful questions.
Not always correct,

1614
01:18:19,561 --> 01:18:20,610
right?
But,

1615
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:25,050
but it's correct a lot more than people 
generally like to think,

1616
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:25,973
you know,
it's like the mothering him grant the 

1617
01:18:26,851 --> 01:18:28,590
mother or the witch in hansel and 
gretel.

1618
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:30,840
You know the story,
right?

1619
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:35,160
This guy gets married,
he's got a couple of kids.

1620
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:36,083
His new wife doesn't relate to the kids.
You have 100 times higher chance by the 

1621
01:18:39,811 --> 01:18:42,930
way of being abused by a step parent.
Then biological parent,

1622
01:18:43,350 --> 01:18:44,850
just so you know.
So the,

1623
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,000
the step where they're just like the 
kids,

1624
01:18:47,001 --> 01:18:47,834
she tells the guy,
well why don't you just go with those 

1625
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:51,090
kids out in the woods,
sold out.

1626
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:53,010
They go out in the woods.
So they're lost kids,

1627
01:18:53,011 --> 01:18:53,940
right?
They have nowhere to go.

1628
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:57,450
So when they're wandering around out 
there in the forest and what happens,

1629
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:01,720
they come across a gingerbread house.
You think,

1630
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:03,550
wow man,
you're a starving kid.

1631
01:19:04,300 --> 01:19:06,670
Gingerbread house.
That's good news,

1632
01:19:06,671 --> 01:19:08,380
right?
Not only is it a house,

1633
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:09,873
but it's made out of candy.
How could anything possibly be any 

1634
01:19:12,821 --> 01:19:14,590
better?
So when they go,

1635
01:19:14,650 --> 01:19:16,870
well,
and then there's this grandmotherly type

1636
01:19:16,871 --> 01:19:17,704
care and you know,
she starts to fatten them up and she 

1637
01:19:20,621 --> 01:19:22,630
puts,
I think it's handling the cage and

1638
01:19:24,430 --> 01:19:27,520
she gets gretel after awhile to 
basically work as their scullery maid.

1639
01:19:27,521 --> 01:19:28,354
And it becomes quite obvious to the 
children that she's actually fattening 

1640
01:19:30,461 --> 01:19:32,590
them up so that she can put them in the 
oven and eat them.

1641
01:19:33,190 --> 01:19:34,023
And so I think what hansel does is I 
think griddle gives him this leg bone 

1642
01:19:37,271 --> 01:19:40,450
from some animal and the old witch's 
half blind.

1643
01:19:40,451 --> 01:19:42,730
And every time she reaches into sorta 
feel his laying,

1644
01:19:43,030 --> 01:19:43,863
he gives her the bone and so like she's 
just not all that interested in meeting 

1645
01:19:47,441 --> 01:19:48,040
them in anyways.

1646
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:48,873
The kids end up pushing her in the oven 
and closing it and getting the hell out 

1647
01:19:51,091 --> 01:19:51,924
of there.
So you know,

1648
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,490
it's a happy ending as far as fairy tale
skill.

1649
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:56,490
But it's an eternal story,
right?

1650
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:59,350
It's a classic story,
but it needs a whole family.

1651
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:03,220
Be bloody wary of people who do too much
for you.

1652
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:05,793
Right?
It's like if have a mother or any other 

1653
01:20:08,821 --> 01:20:09,654
relative for that matter,
who's fattening you up on mercy and 

1654
01:20:14,191 --> 01:20:15,024
candy?
The probability that her basic goal is 

1655
01:20:18,091 --> 01:20:20,430
to eat you enough so that you never 
leave.

1656
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:25,470
The probability is extraordinarily high 
and that's no joke.

1657
01:20:25,471 --> 01:20:26,304
You know,
one of the things that you do learn if 

1658
01:20:29,131 --> 01:20:32,580
you read about the sorts of people who 
burst out of their mother's basement and

1659
01:20:32,581 --> 01:20:36,710
go shoot up dawson colleges that often.
That's exactly the situation that you've

1660
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:37,830
been in,
right?

1661
01:20:37,831 --> 01:20:38,664
They're burning with resentment in your 
uselessness down in the basement for 

1662
01:20:40,981 --> 01:20:42,150
five or six years.

1663
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:43,680
You know,
they don't have to leave,

1664
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:46,620
they don't have to become independent,
everything's done for them,

1665
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:49,140
so they never have to do anything for 
themselves.

1666
01:20:49,480 --> 01:20:54,480
It's like it's not pretty.
And so one of the rules for dealing with

1667
01:20:54,961 --> 01:20:55,794
people,
and I know this is actually a rule for 

1668
01:20:57,031 --> 01:20:58,540
dealing with elderly people in,
in,

1669
01:20:58,650 --> 01:20:59,483
in,
in,

1670
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,410
in,
in hopes for,

1671
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,980
for,
for retired people,

1672
01:21:02,981 --> 01:21:05,640
is do not do anything for anyone they 
can do for themselves.

1673
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:07,740
You are stealing from them when you do 
that.

1674
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:12,360
And it's a great rule of thumb for kids.
Like once they can dress themselves,

1675
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,910
they dress themselves.
If they can set the table,

1676
01:21:14,911 --> 01:21:17,430
even if it takes 20 minutes,
it's like they're setting the table.

1677
01:21:17,610 --> 01:21:18,443
You're not doing them a favor by helping
them do anything they can do themselves 

1678
01:21:22,670 --> 01:21:24,120
and it skips.
It's kind of harsh,

1679
01:21:24,121 --> 01:21:24,954
you know,
but it beats the hell out of the witch 

1680
01:21:25,561 --> 01:21:27,390
in hansel and gretel.
So.

1681
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:28,620
So anyways,
you know,

1682
01:21:28,621 --> 01:21:29,454
one of the things we're going to look at
as well as the dark side of positive 

1683
01:21:31,951 --> 01:21:33,840
motivations.
So

1684
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:37,050
now how are we going to do this?

1685
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:38,473
Hmm.

1686
01:21:40,870 --> 01:21:42,820
One of the things you might ask yourself
is,

1687
01:21:42,821 --> 01:21:44,860
how in the world do you know if 
something is true?

1688
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,193
Now,
the first thing I would suggest is that 

1689
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:49,593
the attitude you guys should bring to 
this class is that nothing that I tell 

1690
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:54,880
you is true.
Okay?

1691
01:21:54,881 --> 01:21:55,714
Now,
I don't mean that you should be 

1692
01:21:57,190 --> 01:22:01,090
arrogantly skeptical because that's not 
appropriate,

1693
01:22:02,230 --> 01:22:07,060
but you should bring every critical 
faculty.

1694
01:22:07,061 --> 01:22:07,894
You have to bear on what I tell you to 
see if you can chip away at it because 

1695
01:22:11,410 --> 01:22:12,243
what you want to do,
you want to build yourself a body of 

1696
01:22:13,691 --> 01:22:14,524
knowledge that you cannot undermine,
and the way you do that is by trying to 

1697
01:22:18,521 --> 01:22:19,354
undermine it,
by hacking away at the foundation with 

1698
01:22:20,590 --> 01:22:22,170
everything you've got,
and if,

1699
01:22:22,360 --> 01:22:25,390
if the ideas can withstand a total 
onslaught,

1700
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:29,080
then you've got something.
You've got a foundation,

1701
01:22:29,081 --> 01:22:32,560
you've got something you could stand on 
that's going to be there when things get

1702
01:22:32,561 --> 01:22:33,394
rough,
and so I'm going to tell you what I've 

1703
01:22:35,411 --> 01:22:36,130
found.

1704
01:22:36,130 --> 01:22:38,320
It's been useful to me when things got 
rough,

1705
01:22:38,770 --> 01:22:39,603
but I don't expect you to assume that 
that's gonna work for you and I don't 

1706
01:22:42,101 --> 01:22:45,790
want you to to like I want you to listen
and to think,

1707
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:48,430
but I want you to keep your wits about 
you.

1708
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:49,863
Now I'm going to tell you how I go about
trying to determine whether or not 

1709
01:22:52,691 --> 01:22:55,360
something is true.
First of all,

1710
01:22:55,361 --> 01:22:56,194
there's different definitions of truth 
and so we're gonna basically flipped 

1711
01:23:01,931 --> 01:23:02,764
back and forth between two.
One of truth is an objective definition 

1712
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:08,583
and we don't have to talk much about 
that because you guys already know what 

1713
01:23:10,361 --> 01:23:11,194
that is,
but there's another definition of truth 

1714
01:23:13,031 --> 01:23:13,864
that the.
I think the best way of defining it is 

1715
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:20,490
as pragmatically true and pragmatism is 
a branch of american philosophy and it's

1716
01:23:20,651 --> 01:23:22,420
a very sophisticated brands and 
philosophy.

1717
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:23,553
In fact,
I actually think it's the most 

1718
01:23:24,491 --> 01:23:25,324
sophisticated brand philosophy part part
probably because it makes the least 

1719
01:23:28,481 --> 01:23:33,340
claims and what the pragmatists state 
basically is.

1720
01:23:33,490 --> 01:23:34,960
Well,
you don't really know anything,

1721
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:36,273
right?
You don't have ultimate knowledge about 

1722
01:23:37,061 --> 01:23:37,894
anything,
so your knowledge always bought himself 

1723
01:23:39,041 --> 01:23:41,200
in ignorance.
And so then the question is,

1724
01:23:41,201 --> 01:23:42,034
well,
how do you know them if anything is 

1725
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:45,100
true?
And the pragmatist would say,

1726
01:23:45,101 --> 01:23:45,934
well in a sense you don't.
What you know always is if something is 

1727
01:23:49,781 --> 01:23:53,650
true enough for a particular function.
So for example,

1728
01:23:53,651 --> 01:23:54,484
your theory about getting to the door 
might be that you can stand up and walk 

1729
01:23:57,161 --> 01:24:00,160
there and you might.
Well god only knows what might happen on

1730
01:24:00,161 --> 01:24:01,150
the way there.
You know,

1731
01:24:01,780 --> 01:24:04,220
maybe there'll be an earthquake or a 
ceiling tile fall on you.

1732
01:24:04,221 --> 01:24:05,290
Or,
or who knows,

1733
01:24:05,291 --> 01:24:06,610
maybe I'll have a heart attack,
you know,

1734
01:24:06,611 --> 01:24:09,460
so you don't know whether you can get 
there.

1735
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:13,510
You can infer from past experience.
But if you get there,

1736
01:24:13,511 --> 01:24:14,344
then what you can say is my statement 
about truth was sufficient so that the 

1737
01:24:18,491 --> 01:24:21,220
outcome was what the theory predicted.

1738
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:24,250
And so in some sense,
what the pragmatists are saying is every

1739
01:24:24,251 --> 01:24:27,370
time you make a statement,
especially if it's related to action,

1740
01:24:28,330 --> 01:24:32,560
that you will offer a theory of truth 
along with that statement implicitly,

1741
01:24:32,561 --> 01:24:37,270
which is that this is true enough if 
what I predict happen happens.

1742
01:24:38,380 --> 01:24:40,840
And so it's really,
it's a binds very nice theory because it

1743
01:24:40,870 --> 01:24:41,703
doesn't require you to be omniscient 
about anything for things to be true 

1744
01:24:45,131 --> 01:24:45,964
enough and you are ignorant.
You don't know everything about 

1745
01:24:48,371 --> 01:24:49,204
anything.
And so obviously you're working in the 

1746
01:24:50,561 --> 01:24:55,561
world with partial knowledge and it 
works not all the time.

1747
01:24:56,411 --> 01:24:57,550
You get old,
you get sick,

1748
01:24:57,551 --> 01:24:58,780
you die.
Like I mean you're,

1749
01:24:58,810 --> 01:24:59,643
you're,
you're not going to work it out 

1750
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:02,980
thoroughly.
But

1751
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:07,990
so we're going to use the pragmatic 
truth framework and we're going to use a

1752
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:08,853
objective truth framework.
And one of the propositions that I'm 

1753
01:25:11,921 --> 01:25:12,754
going to make to you is that the stories
that are associated with our deepest 

1754
01:25:19,481 --> 01:25:20,314
moral intuitions are pragmatic truths 
and that you need pragmatic truths and 

1755
01:25:26,501 --> 01:25:27,670
you need objective truth.

1756
01:25:27,670 --> 01:25:32,670
And you need pragmatic trees because you
don't just need to know what the world's

1757
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:33,544
made up.
You need to know what to do about the 

1758
01:25:36,191 --> 01:25:37,990
fact that the world is made out of 
things.

1759
01:25:38,530 --> 01:25:40,990
And because you know,
human beings are creatures.

1760
01:25:40,991 --> 01:25:43,690
We act in the world.
We act on the world.

1761
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:44,913
And so what we need to know is how is it
that you should act on the world and 

1762
01:25:49,091 --> 01:25:49,924
that is not a question that can be 
addressed by objective methods 

1763
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:52,751
technically,
right?

1764
01:25:52,751 --> 01:25:56,260
Because it's actually a value question.
What should you do?

1765
01:25:56,530 --> 01:26:01,530
Science by its very methodology refuses 
to answer such questions.

1766
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:02,763
And you know,
people confuse the fact that science is 

1767
01:26:04,251 --> 01:26:05,084
value free,
sort of with the idea that existence is 

1768
01:26:08,631 --> 01:26:10,280
value free.
It's like that's,

1769
01:26:10,281 --> 01:26:12,860
that's,
that's philosophically primitive,

1770
01:26:13,070 --> 01:26:13,903
I would say,
because science was actually set up to 

1771
01:26:16,221 --> 01:26:19,180
get rid of the value of the subjective 
value in its,

1772
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:20,210
in its technique.

1773
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:21,193
So you can't say,
well we set this thing up to get rid of 

1774
01:26:22,701 --> 01:26:24,170
the value would look all the value 
score.

1775
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:27,020
It's like there's no value.
It's no,

1776
01:26:27,030 --> 01:26:27,441
no,
no,

1777
01:26:27,441 --> 01:26:28,274
no.
You put that domain out of the range of 

1778
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:35,000
consideration.
That doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

1779
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:37,700
It's just,
it's just a different.

1780
01:26:38,690 --> 01:26:42,170
It requires different.
It requires a different philosophy,

1781
01:26:42,171 --> 01:26:43,760
a different outlook,
different techniques,

1782
01:26:43,761 --> 01:26:45,950
different tools,
different methods of proof,

1783
01:26:46,130 --> 01:26:48,860
all of these things.
And so part of what we're going to do,

1784
01:26:50,090 --> 01:26:53,830
I'm going to use objective truth as much
as i possibly can because I think that,

1785
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:55,083
uh,
that a lot of what psychology as a 

1786
01:26:57,381 --> 01:26:58,214
science has been able to offer in the 
last hundred years is actually 

1787
01:27:00,051 --> 01:27:00,884
extraordinarily useful for elucidating 
some of the issues that we're going to 

1788
01:27:04,701 --> 01:27:08,600
discuss because we really have made some
progress and understanding the psyche,

1789
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:10,070
as you know,
especially at a,

1790
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:13,100
I would say at a biological slash 
behavioral level.

1791
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:16,220
We've got some pretty solid information.
It's not perfect,

1792
01:27:16,221 --> 01:27:18,470
but it's helpful.
Okay.

1793
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:21,200
So we're going to draw on a bunch of 
sources.

1794
01:27:21,910 --> 01:27:24,050
We're drawing stories.
We're going to draw in literature,

1795
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:26,450
we're going to draw on philosophy,
we're going to draw on religion,

1796
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:28,100
we're going to draw a myth,
mythology.

1797
01:27:28,130 --> 01:27:30,440
We're going to draw on biology and 
psychology.

1798
01:27:30,770 --> 01:27:31,603
And there's this idea which you should 
have learned about if you're a 

1799
01:27:34,821 --> 01:27:38,480
psychologist called multi-method 
multitrack matrix.

1800
01:27:38,660 --> 01:27:42,170
So this was invented by a guy back in 
the 19 fifties,

1801
01:27:42,350 --> 01:27:43,183
I think it was neil and chronback,
his famous paper that was published in 

1802
01:27:46,101 --> 01:27:47,660
the fifties.
Everyone is supposed to know it.

1803
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:52,840
No one ever pays any attention to it,
but what they were interested in was how

1804
01:27:53,031 --> 01:27:57,140
do you know if when you say that 
something exists,

1805
01:27:57,141 --> 01:28:00,680
like let's say a anger,
does anger exist?

1806
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:05,420
Well,
the answer seems self evident.

1807
01:28:05,450 --> 01:28:07,580
Yes.
Well it's tricky,

1808
01:28:07,730 --> 01:28:11,990
you know,
because generally no one comes up to you

1809
01:28:11,991 --> 01:28:13,820
and says anger,
you know,

1810
01:28:13,821 --> 01:28:17,240
they tell you a little story where they 
use words relating to anger in the story

1811
01:28:17,241 --> 01:28:18,074
and then you sort of derive what they 
mean by angry from the context and the 

1812
01:28:21,891 --> 01:28:25,340
context is important in defining the 
reality.

1813
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:28,750
Right?
So you don't know if that,

1814
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:29,713
that the central idea anger can be 
pulled out of the context and then you 

1815
01:28:32,421 --> 01:28:33,890
can say,
well that's a thing.

1816
01:28:33,891 --> 01:28:34,724
Like,
like iron is a thing or like mercury is 

1817
01:28:37,101 --> 01:28:37,960
that thing,
you know,

1818
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:39,113
because maybe it's not.
Maybe it's a pattern or maybe it's 

1819
01:28:40,941 --> 01:28:42,530
something that's a convention or you 
know,

1820
01:28:42,531 --> 01:28:44,010
there may be all sorts of things that 
are,

1821
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:49,200
that are associated with it.
So one of back in meals,

1822
01:28:49,311 --> 01:28:50,144
fundamental claims was that in order to 
determine whether or not something 

1823
01:28:54,351 --> 01:28:55,184
existed,
you had to be able to detect it using 

1824
01:28:57,591 --> 01:29:01,070
different methods.
Now it's tricky because it's not obvious

1825
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:03,840
what constitutes a different method,
right?

1826
01:29:04,530 --> 01:29:05,363
So you kind of have to make a judgment.
But I would say you use a multi-method 

1827
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:12,930
multitrack means of determining what's 
true with your senses.

1828
01:29:13,740 --> 01:29:16,860
How many do you have?
Six cars.

1829
01:29:16,861 --> 01:29:18,330
Yeah.
Pro proprioception,

1830
01:29:18,390 --> 01:29:19,800
right?
Why?

1831
01:29:21,150 --> 01:29:21,901
Why,
why?

1832
01:29:21,901 --> 01:29:23,700
Well,
let's say for the sake of simplicity,

1833
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:25,680
why one on one?

1834
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:27,353
Uh,
to increase the likelihood of it being 

1835
01:29:29,701 --> 01:29:30,534
true,
you could see something but not be able 

1836
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:32,633
to touch it.
That might be a mirage maybe or a 

1837
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:43,050
multiple reasons for it to be pointing 
to the probability of it.

1838
01:29:43,470 --> 01:29:43,951
Yes.
Well,

1839
01:29:43,951 --> 01:29:46,470
that's exactly it.
And you want it to be.

1840
01:29:46,750 --> 01:29:50,370
So the sense ideas are really good.
One because you can see that census used

1841
01:29:50,371 --> 01:29:51,540
different modalities,
right?

1842
01:29:51,541 --> 01:29:52,374
It's like obviously the ice relying on 
electromagnetic radiation and the ears 

1843
01:29:55,471 --> 01:29:56,304
rely on vibrations in the air and 
touches really an atomic phenomena in 

1844
01:30:00,361 --> 01:30:01,260
some sense.
You know,

1845
01:30:01,270 --> 01:30:02,103
because you're feeling the outer 
surfaces of electrons with your 

1846
01:30:04,651 --> 01:30:08,700
electronic surfaces and there's taste 
which is again,

1847
01:30:08,701 --> 01:30:11,480
a molecular level phenomena and smell 
and you know,

1848
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:12,590
so our idea,
connie,

1849
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:15,300
is if,
if all five of those things detected,

1850
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:16,493
it's sufficiently real so that we can 
use it to guide our action and we won't 

1851
01:30:19,621 --> 01:30:21,930
be wrong.
So it's five dimensions.

1852
01:30:21,931 --> 01:30:24,510
You need a five dimensional analysis and
that's evolved.

1853
01:30:24,540 --> 01:30:25,321
So you might say,
well,

1854
01:30:25,321 --> 01:30:26,154
you know,
that's.

1855
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:27,083
Let's call that a good estimate.
You need five ways of detecting 

1856
01:30:29,461 --> 01:30:31,650
something before you can be sure it's 
true.

1857
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:36,510
Now you know when you're learning about 
experimental psychology,

1858
01:30:36,750 --> 01:30:38,850
they tell you p is less than point.
Oh,

1859
01:30:38,860 --> 01:30:39,693
five,
right?

1860
01:30:40,030 --> 01:30:40,863
You use a measurement and then you 
determine whether the probability that 

1861
01:30:44,281 --> 01:30:47,840
that has manifested itself exceeds a 
certain level of chance.

1862
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:50,070
If it does,
then the thing exists,

1863
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:52,680
but that's,
that's actually not right.

1864
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:54,833
It's not right for experimental 
psychology and experimental 

1865
01:30:57,091 --> 01:30:59,700
psychologists have known it since the 
late fifties.

1866
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:04,080
You have to demonstrate that the damn 
thing exists multiple different ways.

1867
01:31:04,770 --> 01:31:05,603
Now.
What constitutes a different way can be 

1868
01:31:07,471 --> 01:31:10,800
subject to debate.
It's a complicated thing to sort out,

1869
01:31:10,801 --> 01:31:12,540
but you can kind of figure it out,
right?

1870
01:31:12,870 --> 01:31:15,090
You know,
maybe you as a physiological measurement

1871
01:31:15,091 --> 01:31:15,924
and self report or something like that 
or you self report and other report or 

1872
01:31:19,770 --> 01:31:21,660
you know,
and maybe you don't need five,

1873
01:31:21,661 --> 01:31:24,060
but you probably need three or something
like that,

1874
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:25,140
you know,
depending on them.

1875
01:31:25,530 --> 01:31:26,363
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to 
tell you a story roughly speaking and I 

1876
01:31:30,811 --> 01:31:31,644
want to make this story evident at five 
or six different levels of analysis and 

1877
01:31:35,941 --> 01:31:36,774
I want to show you how the story is the 
same and all of these levels of 

1878
01:31:39,571 --> 01:31:42,570
analysis.
Now the one,

1879
01:31:43,410 --> 01:31:47,010
one of the potential flaws of that 
method is this.

1880
01:31:48,150 --> 01:31:51,100
So Joseph Campbell,
for example,

1881
01:31:51,101 --> 01:31:52,710
he wrote about here on mythology,
right?

1882
01:31:52,711 --> 01:31:53,544
Some of you from undergrad,
the hero with a thousand faces and one 

1883
01:31:56,191 --> 01:31:57,024
of the criticisms of Joseph Campbell and
people like him that they read the 

1884
01:32:01,301 --> 01:32:05,500
stories of multiple cultures,
but they have an a priori framework.

1885
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:08,230
And because of the high priority 
framework,

1886
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:12,400
they only see what their theory tells 
them that they're going to see.

1887
01:32:12,430 --> 01:32:13,263
They don't look for the exceptions,
so it's a problem with pattern 

1888
01:32:15,911 --> 01:32:17,290
recognition,
right?

1889
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:20,560
You may be able to recognize patterns 
where they don't exist.

1890
01:32:21,070 --> 01:32:21,903
Now my method could,
could be criticized on that grounds I 

1891
01:32:25,991 --> 01:32:29,470
think,
but the way I've tried to protect myself

1892
01:32:29,471 --> 01:32:33,520
against that was to make sure that I 
drew from this enough diverse sources so

1893
01:32:33,521 --> 01:32:35,860
that the probability that I would be 
able to tell a coherent,

1894
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:36,813
coherent story across all those 
different types of methods is 

1895
01:32:40,151 --> 01:32:40,984
vanishingly small.
Now you're going to have to decide if 

1896
01:32:43,121 --> 01:32:45,100
you think that's true.
So,

1897
01:32:45,490 --> 01:32:46,980
um,
and I can,

1898
01:32:47,010 --> 01:32:50,200
I can tell you roughly the dimensions of
analysis.

1899
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:53,530
The idea is that I'm going to talk to 
you about.

1900
01:32:53,531 --> 01:32:55,990
I've put into practice personally.
They worked for me.

1901
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:58,600
They work for the people that I've 
taught them to.

1902
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:01,540
so those are family members often,
but not only family members,

1903
01:33:01,541 --> 01:33:03,520
lots of other people because I'm also a 
clinician.

1904
01:33:03,580 --> 01:33:05,920
Right?
And so it seems to work quite nicely.

1905
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:09,730
I have a lot of people write to me and 
tell me that the ideas have worked,

1906
01:33:10,090 --> 01:33:10,923
you know,
and so,

1907
01:33:10,990 --> 01:33:11,823
so I've got multi rater reliability 
there and then I think it's manifests 

1908
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:20,493
biologically and I think it's manifest 
culturally and I think it's manifested 

1909
01:33:23,831 --> 01:33:24,664
in these very,
very old stories and anthropologically 

1910
01:33:27,431 --> 01:33:28,090
and so forth.

1911
01:33:28,090 --> 01:33:29,320
So,
you know,

1912
01:33:29,890 --> 01:33:31,600
make up your own mind,
you,

1913
01:33:31,690 --> 01:33:33,130
you can see,
you know,

1914
01:33:33,131 --> 01:33:34,600
and I think the other,
the other thing,

1915
01:33:34,601 --> 01:33:37,000
and I don't really know what to do,
what to make of this,

1916
01:33:37,180 --> 01:33:38,013
you know,
sometimes you have an intuition of 

1917
01:33:39,041 --> 01:33:39,874
truth,
right?

1918
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:43,570
It's like maybe you're describing a 
problem to someone and they say,

1919
01:33:43,630 --> 01:33:44,463
well this seems to be at the heart of it
and they give you a formulation and 

1920
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:49,000
kinda goes click and you think,
yeah,

1921
01:33:49,450 --> 01:33:51,430
that's how all those things hang 
together.

1922
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:53,770
It's a,
it's a pattern recognition mechanism.

1923
01:33:53,771 --> 01:33:54,604
It's insight mechanism.
People generally have the feeling that 

1924
01:33:57,821 --> 01:33:58,654
when something like that happens,
that something of truth has been 

1925
01:34:01,121 --> 01:34:01,954
revealed.
Now a very common response from the 

1926
01:34:06,341 --> 01:34:07,174
students I've had in these courses is 
that I never tell anyone anything they 

1927
01:34:10,751 --> 01:34:13,780
don't already know.
So,

1928
01:34:13,781 --> 01:34:16,630
and I think the reason for that is I'm 
hoping the reason is,

1929
01:34:16,631 --> 01:34:19,150
is that what I'm outlining our 
archetypal structures,

1930
01:34:19,151 --> 01:34:21,130
you know,
and I've drawn a lot of my work from you

1931
01:34:21,190 --> 01:34:23,110
who was very interested in our critical 
structures.

1932
01:34:23,410 --> 01:34:25,660
And so what should happen,
and I think it will happen,

1933
01:34:25,661 --> 01:34:27,520
is when I tell you a story,
you'll think,

1934
01:34:27,521 --> 01:34:28,180
oh yeah,
right,

1935
01:34:28,180 --> 01:34:31,600
that's what that means and I see and 
here's all the things that it explains.

1936
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:34,390
And so you'll have this sense and that's
the,

1937
01:34:34,630 --> 01:34:36,940
you talked about your friend with the 
spiritual awakening.

1938
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:37,953
Often one of the cognitive phenomena 
that accompanies a spiritual awakening 

1939
01:34:43,031 --> 01:34:43,864
is the connection of many,
many diverse phenomena into a 

1940
01:34:47,530 --> 01:34:48,363
overarching unity.
And you feel that like as a radical 

1941
01:34:50,741 --> 01:34:51,574
simplification or something like that,
a decrease in entropy or something like 

1942
01:34:54,371 --> 01:34:55,450
that.
And a very,

1943
01:34:55,451 --> 01:34:58,610
very powerful sensation.
So,

1944
01:34:58,611 --> 01:35:03,230
I mean there's other sources of what you
might call spiritual experience as well,

1945
01:35:03,231 --> 01:35:05,630
but that's certainly one of them.
And so you can see,

1946
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:06,860
you know,
all you stories,

1947
01:35:06,861 --> 01:35:07,820
you can think,
oh well,

1948
01:35:07,821 --> 01:35:10,340
you know,
how,

1949
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:14,330
how does that story manifest itself in 
your experience?

1950
01:35:14,650 --> 01:35:17,750
Now it's a phenomenal logical level of 
truth,

1951
01:35:17,751 --> 01:35:18,584
right?
So the phenomenologists branch of 

1952
01:35:20,330 --> 01:35:24,620
philosophy started by heidegger,
not exactly,

1953
01:35:24,621 --> 01:35:29,621
but let's say extended as well as anyone
extended it by heidegger.

1954
01:35:31,790 --> 01:35:32,623
Heidegger thought that western 
philosophy had gone wrong basically 

1955
01:35:34,911 --> 01:35:37,670
since the time of socrates,
which is quite a long time,

1956
01:35:38,450 --> 01:35:39,283
and he said that we were,
we became interested in what the world 

1957
01:35:41,931 --> 01:35:42,764
was made of and how we knew things and 
what we should have been interested in 

1958
01:35:45,591 --> 01:35:46,424
stead was the nature and quality of 
being and whaT he meant by being isn't 

1959
01:35:52,070 --> 01:35:57,070
the objective world.
What he meant by being was the manner in

1960
01:35:57,141 --> 01:35:57,974
which you have experience and so there 
are elements of being that aren't 

1961
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:07,160
objective elements and so I would say 
pain is a phenomenological reality,

1962
01:36:07,790 --> 01:36:08,550
right?
It's,

1963
01:36:08,550 --> 01:36:13,130
it's not something you can.
You can Index it objectively,

1964
01:36:13,730 --> 01:36:17,060
but the index is not the phenomena and 
you know,

1965
01:36:17,390 --> 01:36:18,530
is your pain real.

1966
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:20,380
See,
this is.

1967
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:23,330
This is a question for people who think 
there's no such thing as meaning.

1968
01:36:24,730 --> 01:36:27,920
Like you try to argue yourself out of 
pain and see how far you get.

1969
01:36:28,070 --> 01:36:28,791
You might think,
well,

1970
01:36:28,791 --> 01:36:30,950
that's not the sort of meaning I meant.
It's like,

1971
01:36:30,951 --> 01:36:32,840
you know,
a negative meaning is a place to start,

1972
01:36:32,841 --> 01:36:35,210
right?
because if something's negative and it's

1973
01:36:35,211 --> 01:36:36,044
real,
it does imply that there's something 

1974
01:36:37,161 --> 01:36:38,150
positive.
It's real.

1975
01:36:38,450 --> 01:36:42,260
It might be harder to get ahold of.
At least it's not pain,

1976
01:36:42,770 --> 01:36:43,603
you know,
so,

1977
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:48,110
but pain descartes,
and I'll close with this.

1978
01:36:48,111 --> 01:36:50,000
You guys can have a break.
Descartes

1979
01:36:51,530 --> 01:36:52,363
implemented a method he called radical 
doubt when he went on his philosophical 

1980
01:36:55,071 --> 01:36:55,904
journey and what descartes looked for 
was one thing he couldn't doubt because 

1981
01:36:59,751 --> 01:37:03,440
he was probably clinically depressed and
he was just doubting everything.

1982
01:37:03,470 --> 01:37:03,981
It's like,
well,

1983
01:37:03,981 --> 01:37:04,814
why?
How do I know the world isn't just been 

1984
01:37:05,960 --> 01:37:08,960
mirage made by an evil demon to,
you know,

1985
01:37:08,961 --> 01:37:09,740
to,
uh,

1986
01:37:09,740 --> 01:37:11,840
to obfuscate reality from me.

1987
01:37:12,710 --> 01:37:13,543
While his conclusion was the one thing 
that he could not dispute was that he 

1988
01:37:17,460 --> 01:37:19,580
could,
he was an could think.

1989
01:37:20,360 --> 01:37:21,193
Now,
I don't think descartes really meant 

1990
01:37:21,921 --> 01:37:26,921
what we meant by think.
I think he meant more what we would mean

1991
01:37:27,021 --> 01:37:31,490
by experience because thought has become
a much more narrowly defined,

1992
01:37:32,230 --> 01:37:35,090
you know,
term since the time of descartes.

1993
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:37,970
So I don't think he meant,
I think therefore I am.

1994
01:37:37,971 --> 01:37:40,370
I think he meant something like I 
experienced.

1995
01:37:40,371 --> 01:37:43,460
I have experienced there for him.
But regardless of that,

1996
01:37:43,730 --> 01:37:46,670
modern people think about it as thought 
heidegger was different.

1997
01:37:46,671 --> 01:37:47,504
Heidegger basically said the one thing 
you can dispute is that that experience 

1998
01:37:52,100 --> 01:37:55,860
is your experience.
It exists.

1999
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:58,740
You can't.
It's almost by definition,

2000
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:01,080
right?
It's like the definition of exist.

2001
01:38:01,410 --> 01:38:02,243
And then he was interested in what the 
fundamental elements of existence I've 

2002
01:38:05,701 --> 01:38:08,220
existed.
It's work and they're not on just like,

2003
01:38:09,070 --> 01:38:09,903
you know,
like the fundamental elements of the 

2004
01:38:10,771 --> 01:38:11,604
objective world.
There are more things like pain and for 

2005
01:38:14,521 --> 01:38:16,670
me that was the thing that stopped me 
from delhi.

2006
01:38:17,290 --> 01:38:19,740
It's like a candle.
Don't be existence of pain.

2007
01:38:20,550 --> 01:38:21,383
It seems real.
And I might say it seems more real than 

2008
01:38:24,151 --> 01:38:24,984
anything else.
Now you might say you don't believe 

2009
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:28,050
that,
but I would say,

2010
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:32,310
I don't care what you think you believe,
I'll watch you when you're in pain.

2011
01:38:32,730 --> 01:38:36,750
And every single one of your actions 
will indicate that you believe in it.

2012
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:39,660
And not only that,
you can't not believe in it.

2013
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:42,240
Right?
It's there and it's there so much that

2014
01:38:44,300 --> 01:38:45,133
well,
that's a meaning and so that it's in 

2015
01:38:46,881 --> 01:38:50,540
that way that heidegger,
at least in part thought of existence as

2016
01:38:50,630 --> 01:38:51,463
or experience as composed of meetings 
and so part of the reason that this 

2017
01:38:54,801 --> 01:38:57,920
course is called maps of meaning is 
because one of the things we're going to

2018
01:38:57,921 --> 01:38:58,754
look at is the structure of meaning and 
we're going to start with negative 

2019
01:39:02,121 --> 01:39:04,490
meaning because from my perspective 
it's.

2020
01:39:04,970 --> 01:39:05,803
Look,
you can doubt whether or not good 

2021
01:39:06,921 --> 01:39:07,754
exists,
but once I'm done telling you about the 

2022
01:39:10,431 --> 01:39:11,264
things I know about human history,
there won't be a single person in this 

2023
01:39:13,371 --> 01:39:14,204
room who thinks that evil doesn't exist 
and you might think that's a bloody 

2024
01:39:17,121 --> 01:39:19,070
horrible thing to learn,
but it's not.

2025
01:39:19,820 --> 01:39:20,653
It's unbelievably useful because once 
you can establish something that you 

2026
01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:25,124
cannot deny,
then you can move from that and I think 

2027
01:39:28,431 --> 01:39:33,431
you can hypothesize that if you're 
capable of detecting radical evil,

2028
01:39:35,660 --> 01:39:39,140
I'll tell you about unit seven,
31 at some point or you can look them up

2029
01:39:39,141 --> 01:39:40,790
yourself.
I wouldn't recommend it.

2030
01:39:40,820 --> 01:39:41,653
By the way.

2031
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:46,090
Once you can identify radical evil and 
you think,

2032
01:39:46,091 --> 01:39:47,980
well,
that's just beyond a doubt,

2033
01:39:48,010 --> 01:39:48,843
that's reprehensible.
There's no justification for that 

2034
01:39:50,470 --> 01:39:52,000
whatsoever,
no matter what,

2035
01:39:52,570 --> 01:39:54,070
whenever.
Well,

2036
01:39:54,071 --> 01:39:56,770
then you've got something to stand on 
and you can start thinking,

2037
01:39:56,771 --> 01:39:58,420
well,
what's the absolute opposite of that?

2038
01:39:58,421 --> 01:39:59,530
Then,
you know,

2039
01:39:59,531 --> 01:40:00,364
it might be,
how is it that you could conduct 

2040
01:40:02,081 --> 01:40:04,510
yourself so that in your sphere of 
influence,

2041
01:40:04,720 --> 01:40:08,680
the probability like that anything like 
that would ever happen is reduced to the

2042
01:40:08,681 --> 01:40:11,110
absolute maximum.
Well,

2043
01:40:11,111 --> 01:40:13,110
that's a reasonable moral question.
And,

2044
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:13,750
and,
and I,

2045
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:16,450
I don't think it's something that you 
can dispense with,

2046
01:40:16,451 --> 01:40:17,284
with like a casual nihilism.
I don't think a nihilist can dispense 

2047
01:40:21,101 --> 01:40:23,770
with it because he even nihilists 
suffer.

2048
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:26,200
Thank god for that.
You know,

2049
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:27,153
it's their only,
it's their only source of potential 

2050
01:40:29,171 --> 01:40:31,240
salvation.
Sometimes they notice it,

2051
01:40:31,450 --> 01:40:33,340
oh,
I'm suffering about all this nihilism.

2052
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:36,220
Maybe that indicates that there's 
something flawed in it.

2053
01:40:36,430 --> 01:40:38,640
It's always possible.
So.

2054
01:40:38,830 --> 01:40:40,060
Okay,
so let's take a break.

2055
01:40:40,061 --> 01:40:42,470
We'll take a break for.
Oh,

2056
01:40:42,690 --> 01:40:44,230
come back at three.
What time is it?

2057
01:40:44,231 --> 01:40:46,950
I want to make sure my clock,
the 58.

2058
01:40:47,260 --> 01:40:49,180
Okay.
Come back at 3:15.

2059
01:40:50,230 --> 01:40:53,080
We'll see you there and then I'll talk 
to you more about the technical elements

2060
01:40:53,081 --> 01:40:53,914
of the class.
