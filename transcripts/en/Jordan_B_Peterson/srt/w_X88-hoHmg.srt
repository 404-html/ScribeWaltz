1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,153
No,
I use this picture to represent my 

2
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:09,414
class.
You might not know anything about this 

3
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:17,991
picture.
It's a picture of Jonah being thrown out

4
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:22,280
of a whale's belly after spending three 
days inside.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,480
It's an old biblical story.
It's a myth.

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,860
It's a fairy tale.
That's.

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:27,743
That's one way of looking at it and and 
I don't mean that in a derogative 

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,810
manner.
We know for example,

9
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:38,790
that somebody gribbins brothers' 
fairytales are perhaps 50,000 years old.

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,890
It'd be traced back.
The really,

11
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:41,724
really old and old stories are strange 
and they're strange because only been 

12
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,810
told generation after generation after 
generation,

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:54,080
so you can imagine that something 
retooled over such an expansive,

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,020
expansive time has been reduced to its 
just many,

15
00:00:58,021 --> 00:01:01,510
many times and nothing in the story 
anymore.

16
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,840
It's all meaningful in some sense.
Sort of like a a story that's one way of

17
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:11,820
thinking about imagine that you took 100
books,

18
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,223
hundred adventure books,
and you had to extract out the central 

19
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,910
features of an adventure.

20
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:21,990
For now it's hard to do that.
It's like you're averaging across the or

21
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:24,330
something like that.
Instilling them in some manner.

22
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:26,843
You get up Amanda and denture and it 
would be like a myth upon which all 

23
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,950
adventures are based and this story is 
actually one of those stores,

24
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,730
and I'm going to tell you what I think 
the story means,

25
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,180
and I'm not saying that this is all the 
these,

26
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:46,190
because most stories of this sort are in
some sense in exhaustible,

27
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,170
just like great works of art are 
inexhaustible there.

28
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,550
There's more information in them than 
you can possibly articulate.

29
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,940
That's what makes the
profound.

30
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,163
That's why you go look at them,
because otherwise someone could just 

31
00:01:59,761 --> 00:02:02,810
tell you about paying and that would be 
the end of that,

32
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:05,040
but that doesn't work.
So,

33
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:10,690
so Jonah is being stood up by this whale
and of course on your face,

34
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,860
if that's an impossibility,
because

35
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,910
live inside a whale,
that's why it's impossible.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,630
Now,
you may remember and likely do that.

37
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,510
You all know a story about someone who 
is inside whale.

38
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:28,600
That's Pinocchio,
right?

39
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,360
And uh,
you know,

40
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,080
you go to that movie,
maybe even as an adult,

41
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:34,973
you watch that movie and Japan goes down
there and the whale and doesn't mean 

42
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,810
quote this big cavernous inside.
You don't really care that that's,

43
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,490
there's a bunch of things you don't care
about.

44
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:48,420
You don't care that these are drawings 
and not real people.

45
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,503
You don't care about that and you don't 
care that inside of a whale isn't a 

46
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:57,960
cavern and you don't care that 
Pinocchio's a puppet for that matter.

47
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,180
None of that matters to you all.
And that's because you're really strange

48
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,470
creatures and you don't even notice when
you're doing something out.

49
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,780
And that's one of those times when you 
are.

50
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,940
But if someone taps you on the shoulder 
and says,

51
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,273
you know,
when you're just watching drawings of a 

52
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:18,940
puppet operates can really move the 
condom asleep and now he's at the bottom

53
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:19,660
of the ocean.

54
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,493
You have no idea why he's going to 
rescue his father and you're just 

55
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:25,930
sitting there and all you're okay with 
that.

56
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,943
And you'll say,
shut up because I want to finish 

57
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:32,680
watching the movie.
And so that's interesting.

58
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,573
You see that.
Tells you something about your 

59
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:36,244
unconscious.
If you're a psychoanalytically minded 

60
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,210
because you're doing something that you 
cannot account for now,

61
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:44,044
you might say,
well,

62
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,910
it's enjoyable.
Well,

63
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:46,830
that's deep,
man.

64
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,480
You're really going a long ways with 
that.

65
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:54,670
The it is a why is it comprehensive?
Will be why is it enjoyable?

66
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,213
See just exactly what are you doing 
better and you think that whatever you 

67
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:06,340
are doing there is so valuable that you 
will actually pay to do it.

68
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,400
Weird.
Very,

69
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:10,234
very weird.
And you know when you read about let's 

70
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:14,614
say the archaic ritual of tribal people 
and you ask yourself just what are they 

71
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:22,900
up to?
You might think,

72
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,870
well,
they're up to the same thing that you're

73
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,713
up to when you go see a movie.
So then you might also notice that the 

74
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:30,634
most expensive artifacts or among the 
most expensive artifacts that human 

75
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:35,044
beings create our movies,
it's been hundreds of millions of 

76
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,200
dollars on
and we consider that a good deal.

77
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,080
And you know,
it drives our technology too because the

78
00:04:46,081 --> 00:04:50,790
high tech movies like the marvel movies 
that require so much computer animation,

79
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,390
they actually drive the demand for high 
end graphics chips.

80
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,930
So our technological,
it sounds forward,

81
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:58,764
is actually motivated in part by her 
desire to represent things fictionally 

82
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,960
in evermore spectacular manner.
So John,

83
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,060
well let me tell you the story of Jonah

84
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,930
and I'll tell you why I'm going to tell 
you.

85
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,113
This is from Camille Paglia,
who's a critic of the modern university 

86
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,710
and very brilliant woman,
I would say,

87
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:26,770
very controversial,
credibly rapid speaker.

88
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,550
She can think so fast.
It's just unbelievable.

89
00:05:29,551 --> 00:05:31,740
She's really fun to watch it if you 
like,

90
00:05:31,741 --> 00:05:34,860
that sort of thing.
Vicious adversary in an argument.

91
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,953
She says,
the number one problem in academia 

92
00:05:39,021 --> 00:05:40,740
today,
it's not ignorant students.

93
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,013
Professors
let's substitute narrow expertise and 

94
00:05:47,691 --> 00:05:51,860
theoretical sophistication of foster's 
turned for breadth and depth of learning

95
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,813
in the world.
History of art and thought our isn't 

96
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:59,990
interconnected with work.
A fabricated tradition,

97
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,800
overconcentration on any one point,
isn't distortion.

98
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,130
Here's,
here's the problem.

99
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,283
I wrestled with this one.
To understand some of the things that 

100
00:06:18,971 --> 00:06:19,804
I'm going to teach you about,
there's some things that you kind of 

101
00:06:24,581 --> 00:06:26,530
have to grasp as a whole.
You know,

102
00:06:26,531 --> 00:06:27,364
sometimes you have a flash of insight 
and a bunch of things that you didn't 

103
00:06:29,441 --> 00:06:31,810
know were related.
You haven't done that.

104
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,713
That's supposed to happen in 
psychotherapy when you link different 

105
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,680
disparate patterns of behavior together 
because you've linked them saying with a

106
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,160
single cause and you get this like cited
feeling of illumination and possibility

107
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,480
and there are forms of communication 
that require the simultaneous Lee,

108
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,910
the simultaneous realization of a 
multitude of disparate.

109
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:07,610
So now I'm gonna
move.

110
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,210
You can be like that.
You know,

111
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,343
you listen to a movie,
you watch a movie and then you don't 

112
00:07:12,001 --> 00:07:15,010
know what the hell's going on and then 
something happens near the end and

113
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,613
everything fits together and it's 
because you started seeing the thing as 

114
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:22,990
a whole.
And a lot of the things that we.

115
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:28,060
A lot of the ways that we interact with 
the world that are mysterious

116
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:33,850
are like that there.
And this is what Pega is referring to is

117
00:07:33,851 --> 00:07:34,684
that.
And this is a psychoanalytic 

118
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,860
proposition.
I would say our romantic proposition,

119
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:40,290
wow,

120
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,600
no,
no idea roughly is that

121
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,873
way out in the periphery of reality or 
all those things that not only do you 

122
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:52,280
not know,
but you don't even know you don't know,

123
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,340
right?
Eric completely blind to their existence

124
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:56,174
and then there's unknown things that you
have some suspicions about him and 

125
00:07:59,471 --> 00:08:00,304
there's unknown things that you can 
start to imagine and act out and 

126
00:08:05,691 --> 00:08:06,524
dramatize,
and so all of that is on the periphery 

127
00:08:09,651 --> 00:08:13,130
of our knowledge.
Lots of psychoanalytic dictum.

128
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,233
Where do thoughts come from?
They're just getting dreams are the 

129
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,690
birthplace of thoughts.
Fantasy.

130
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,710
It's not that surprising.
Fantasy is the birthplace of ideas.

131
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:25,544
You know,
thinking about what you're gonna do in 

132
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:27,764
the future.
You enter into a reverie of dream state 

133
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,903
and you contemplate multiple 
possibilities and then you start 

134
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:36,104
thinking through,
use your imagination to search beyond 

135
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,543
where you are and the collective human 
attempt to do that is our mysterious 

136
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:50,024
humanistic artistic tradition,
which is very difficult to justify from 

137
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,830
a formal articular point of view.
What good is dance?

138
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,850
What is it that you're doing when you're
dancing?

139
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,730
You don't care because you like to 
dance.

140
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,320
Why?
Well,

141
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,550
you don't know.
You do spill into you music.

142
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,553
Music's a human.
Universal cultures used music to 

143
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:17,370
organize themselves,
right?

144
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:19,800
They use music to catalyze their 
identities.

145
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:24,450
They use music to unite around.
No and more archaic societies.

146
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,110
Less differentiate societies,
let's say no.

147
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,233
A mask to represents part of the family 
tradition will have a particular design 

148
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,410
and there'll be a particular song 
written for it and he'll be a particular

149
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,323
dance about the song and the dance or 
something like the symbolic 

150
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:46,950
representation of a mode of being in the
world.

151
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:47,784
Like maybe the mask is a wolf mask and 
so we locked out the wolf and there's 

152
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:52,860
music that goes along with that and you 
think,

153
00:09:52,861 --> 00:09:53,694
well,
what are you doing when you're acting 

154
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:56,510
out the wolf?
And part of that is what you're trying.

155
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,560
We're trying to understand both it.
It's an event.

156
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,600
It's imitation in part and you know if 
you live in the natural world and if you

157
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,100
have attended,
if you're preyed upon,

158
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,113
then understanding the things that 
you're hunting and preying upon is 

159
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:10,434
useful and there's also perhaps perhaps 
useful things to learn from them and so 

160
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,640
we play this strange symbolic game with 
the world like children's pretending.

161
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,593
That's another way of thinking about it 
and we do that to act out and to begin 

162
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:30,921
to understand things we don't understand
like how it asks us.

163
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,513
For me,
the most important question in life is 

164
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:40,410
not
what the world is made of

165
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:48,010
and in fact I would say that's a 
relatively new preoccupation of,

166
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,890
of humankind.
You know,

167
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,060
we didn't really formalize.
You could say that the ancient Greeks

168
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,730
originated,
laid the groundwork for the emergence of

169
00:11:00,731 --> 00:11:01,900
an empirical science

170
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,140
and then

171
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:09,750
it emerged more formally with Bacon and 
Descartes Newton

172
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,660
600 years ago.
Not very long,

173
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:17,450
like a blink,
blink of the eye in human terms

174
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,470
for that.

175
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,050
People were engineers.
They can build things and so forth,

176
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:26,810
but they didn't know how it.
They weren't scientists.

177
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,950
They didn't really conceptualize the 
world as an objective place.

178
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,840
We do that automatically because science
seats so far into our

179
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,330
set of presuppositions that doesn't make
us good scientists by the way,

180
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:42,523
but it does make us believe that the 
fundamental reality of the world is an 

181
00:11:46,611 --> 00:11:51,410
objective real and I'm not going to 
dispute that you get early,

182
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,870
but leaves one set of questions are 
answered

183
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,653
probably by its nature because it wasn't
designed to answer the question than 

184
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:02,794
that.
The rest of us.

185
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:03,993
How should one conduct oneself in the 
world and that's an important thing 

186
00:12:10,181 --> 00:12:11,014
since you're alive and academically,
you rather stay alive and while you're 

187
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,023
alive,
you probably don't want to suffer 

188
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,833
anymore than you have to and no more 
stupidly than you have to and it might 

189
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:26,530
also be good if some of the things that 
you wanted actually happen and so you're

190
00:12:26,531 --> 00:12:27,364
motivated to know how to act and people 
are always telling each other how to 

191
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:34,660
act.
We're sending each other information all

192
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:36,290
the time about how to actually do that.

193
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,960
What are the expressions on her face?
And of course when we parked the people,

194
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:40,803
we always look at their face and that's 
because their face tells you what 

195
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,510
they're up to.
No.

196
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,620
If they're smiling,
paying attention to you,

197
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:51,400
well then you can assume that you're 
doing something right.

198
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,110
And if they're looking annoyed or 
discussed it,

199
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,953
that's a particularly bad one.
Then you might think you might take a 

200
00:12:58,541 --> 00:12:59,374
hit from that,
especially if you know three or four 

201
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:04,780
people are doing it at the same time.
And so we're reflecting,

202
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:09,490
reflecting some ideal for one another 
constantly.

203
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:11,283
And the more attentive you are,
the more likely you are to act in 

204
00:13:16,271 --> 00:13:17,104
accordance with that ideal.
And the more like you like who you are 

205
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:20,764
to move towards it,
you may not even know what the ideal is 

206
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,270
in an articulate sentence.
In fact,

207
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:26,160
you probably don't.
You know,

208
00:13:26,161 --> 00:13:27,930
you could come up with a while.

209
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,250
I get no good person is nice and 
friendly and cooperative.

210
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,393
Yeah,
yeah.

211
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,260
That's all just cliche.
But you don't know your conception might

212
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,273
be very hollow.
It's very likely that it's very hard 

213
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:44,620
even though he may be back in a minute.
All right,

214
00:13:44,621 --> 00:13:48,170
so anyways,
this is a story I'd say historic,

215
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,990
it's,
it's what would happen,

216
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,053
collected a bunch of stories and then 
you extracted out of the story from and 

217
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:59,050
it's sort of a story about destiny and 
it's couched in a religious language.

218
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,353
Um,
but that's okay because most of these 

219
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,293
distilled stories are formed.
The foundation of religious texts and 

220
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:13,690
religious texts and Agnes and myths and 
stories are,

221
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,733
as I said,
part of the outer perimeter of our 

222
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,970
society.
They have a,

223
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,153
they have a coherent nature and it's all
form a foundation and it's on that 

224
00:14:25,661 --> 00:14:29,680
foundation that everything that you take
for granted risks,

225
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,110
even if you don't understand the 
foundation.

226
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:33,483
So I can give you an example.
There's a metaphysical idea that 

227
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:41,460
underlies western civilization and that 
metaphysical idea is that the individual

228
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,390
has transcendent worth.
That's,

229
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:49,090
that's the idea from which the notion of
natural rights is derived.

230
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,463
And of course,
our legal system is predicated on the 

231
00:14:52,611 --> 00:14:57,611
idea that you have certain natural 
rights that are enshrined in the bill of

232
00:14:58,011 --> 00:14:59,090
rights,
for example,

233
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,553
and you're in the states,
wouldn't have built the bill of rights 

234
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:07,310
was being formulated within the 
legislation.

235
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,040
Original legislation that founded the 
state is being formulated.

236
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,570
The formulator said,
we hold these truths to be self evident.

237
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,980
What does that mean?
They're axioms of faith.

238
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:24,350
They're propositions and there's no 
proof for them.

239
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:29,750
They're their mode of operation in the 
world and so the hypothesis is something

240
00:15:29,751 --> 00:15:30,584
like,
well,

241
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:35,300
if I treat you like there's something 
about you that has transcendent value,

242
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,960
implicit intrinsic value,
whatever that might be,

243
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,510
there are stories,
vocab,

244
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,550
and we'll talk about and you do the same
to me,

245
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,210
and then we set up a body of laws that 
recognize this,

246
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,223
the sovereignty of the individual so 
that the law itself has to act with 

247
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:55,250
respect towards every individual.

248
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,860
Even if that individual has done 
something reprehensible,

249
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,410
which is very weird.
If you think about it,

250
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:06,310
then our society will work better and 
well,

251
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,390
perhaps that's true,
but for better or worse,

252
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:15,890
that is what this society is predicated 
on and that's a very,

253
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:16,491
very,
very,

254
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:17,151
very,
very,

255
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:17,984
very old idea.
It's an idea that people came to with 

256
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:27,640
great difficulty because it was over 
thousands of years that people learn how

257
00:16:28,131 --> 00:16:32,120
to take their little tribal groups which
are always squabbling with one another.

258
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,413
As human beings.
They're very violent and tribal groups 

259
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:36,944
are by no means civilized.
There's no noble savage like the 

260
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:41,534
Europeans thought.
You studied tribal groups in the world 

261
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:45,140
today.
The murder,

262
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,870
the death rate by violence is 
unbelievably high,

263
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,513
so
something that unites a tribe within a 

264
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,490
tribe,
it's often kinships,

265
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:55,363
but then tribes come together to form 
larger civilizations and they have to 

266
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:58,963
determine some sort of method of 
principle that guides them so that they 

267
00:17:02,181 --> 00:17:03,014
can cooperate and come together without 
destroying one another and they have to 

268
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,033
extract out of principle by which the 
society might function and that has to 

269
00:17:10,851 --> 00:17:11,684
work and then as societies get bigger 
and bigger and bigger and bigger and 

270
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:14,954
bigger,
they have to bring more and more of 

271
00:17:16,551 --> 00:17:19,810
these diverse traditions together and 
extract something from them.

272
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:24,810
It has power and functional utility and 
that allows people to unite.

273
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,493
And so
this is one of the stories that talks 

274
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:32,054
about that.
It's a storybook individual 

275
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:39,800
responsibility and what happens when 
it's not heated,

276
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:41,743
so you know,
because we could say you are a social 

277
00:17:45,051 --> 00:17:45,884
creature linked to the core and of your 
environment is other people and those 

278
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,740
other people want something from you.
You want something from them.

279
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,980
So you're going to play games with them.
You're either going to be good at it,

280
00:17:58,981 --> 00:18:01,720
you're going to bad,
but you're going to play games with them

281
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:07,200
and so the game might have rules where 
you sophisticated

282
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,583
and you'd expect that because as 
behavior more and more approximates an 

283
00:18:12,871 --> 00:18:13,704
ideal student sets a thing exists,
then more and more sophisticated than 

284
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,003
the nature of the ideal is perhaps more 
and more complex and physical can 

285
00:18:23,671 --> 00:18:26,190
understand.
You get a hint of that stuff.

286
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,063
We can get a hint of this because you 
will see if you pay attention to your 

287
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:35,250
own soul,
your psyche,

288
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:36,603
your unconscious,
you will see that there are people that 

289
00:18:38,311 --> 00:18:43,311
you admire and the people that you have 
contempt for it and that's,

290
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,590
and it doesn't necessarily.
Then you're 100 percent accurate in your

291
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:47,424
judgment.
You know it's not such a bad idea to 

292
00:18:50,311 --> 00:18:54,210
criticize here first
impressions,

293
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:55,883
but those states exist and so there's a 
reason you admire someone and there's a 

294
00:19:01,831 --> 00:19:02,664
reason you have contempt for someone 
that may be multiple reasons and that's 

295
00:19:05,281 --> 00:19:06,114
a hit to your intrinsic value structure.
It's a hint about your intrinsic value 

296
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:12,630
structure.
You wouldn't admire someone unless there

297
00:19:12,631 --> 00:19:13,464
was something about them that you value 
and perhaps that you would also like to 

298
00:19:16,381 --> 00:19:21,381
be able to do and you wouldn't despise 
someone or have contempt for them if you

299
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:22,554
didn't feel that something they were 
doing was wrong and that it would be 

300
00:19:25,261 --> 00:19:25,530
wrong.

301
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,363
If you get it too,
and so you're bringing to bear on the 

302
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:29,514
situation and implicit morality,
then you have to do that because as I 

303
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:33,984
said,
you can act without a morality because 

304
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,073
if you're going to act,
you're going to try to make things 

305
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:47,481
better that otherwise why bother and if 
you're acting to make things better than

306
00:19:48,891 --> 00:19:51,240
some things have to be better at.
Some things have to be worse,

307
00:19:51,241 --> 00:19:54,390
and that's a value structure,
so you have one.

308
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,840
All right,
so Jonah

309
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:05,060
gets a call from God and God tells him 
that there's a city,

310
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,870
Nineveh that's falling into moral 
disarray.

311
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,480
Now,
what does that mean?

312
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,810
Well,
it's a universal story.

313
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,580
It's like all cultures are always 
falling into disarray.

314
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,210
It's their nature.
Just entropy does that,

315
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,160
right?
Things change.

316
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,053
The world changes.
The environment changes in the culture 

317
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:29,694
doesn't keep up very well,
and then of course it has corrupt the 

318
00:20:31,651 --> 00:20:35,220
elements and so it's an interior eternal
story.

319
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:36,503
The individual is always placed in 
relationship to a culture that somewhat 

320
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:45,660
corrupt and then the question is well do
about and if the answer is nothing,

321
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,150
well then it'll just get more corrupt 
and if the answer is be corrupt too,

322
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,133
then it will just get more corrupt.
So the answer has to be to host the 

323
00:20:58,361 --> 00:21:02,730
corruption because that's the only way 
it's going to start.

324
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,733
Now God threatens to destroy this city 
because of its corruption and I don't 

325
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:12,214
think you need to presume anything 
particular the metaphysical about that 

326
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,013
to understand that it's very 
straightforward that the more corrupt 

327
00:21:21,341 --> 00:21:24,820
the culture is and the less trust is 
possible between individuals,

328
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:29,050
the less productive with the culture is 
going to be because why do anything?

329
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:31,330
If some person is going to come and take
it,

330
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,630
you know it might even be these 
different culture is so corrupted.

331
00:21:34,631 --> 00:21:39,220
If you aren't good for something and you
produce resources,

332
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,143
you're actually more likely to get 
killed because you have something of 

333
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:44,400
value.
So like there's just,

334
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,080
you're just not going anywhere with 
that.

335
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:46,983
And why would you work if you didn't 
have any sense that you know you could 

336
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:54,070
store up the value of your work for some
reasonable time in the future.

337
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,430
So if this society is corrupt and 
there's no trust,

338
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,220
it's degenerate.
Might live for a while,

339
00:22:00,221 --> 00:22:03,260
but he isn't going to last very long.
And so that's the idea.

340
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,750
Corrupt society.
He's collapsed.

341
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,030
Stephanie is open.
What corruption means anyways,

342
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,420
Jonah fake snow,
no bloody way.

343
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,753
I'm not going to that city.
It can go to hell as far as I'm 

344
00:22:18,111 --> 00:22:18,944
concerned and that's really what he 
thinks and why in the world should I do 

345
00:22:21,771 --> 00:22:25,040
anything about it anyways?
And these are good objections.

346
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,560
It's like,
why would you do that?

347
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,530
And you'll face this,
believe me in your life,

348
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,780
you will face this.
In fact,

349
00:22:32,781 --> 00:22:34,850
you've already do always,
constantly,

350
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,953
continually in small ways perhaps when 
you're interacting with people who 

351
00:22:39,861 --> 00:22:42,680
aren't treating you properly when you're
acting,

352
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,750
and those might be your parents,
they might be your friends,

353
00:22:44,751 --> 00:22:46,430
they might be people that can work 
place,

354
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,020
they might be professors,

355
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:55,140
they're playing a crooked game and you 
don't like and you know it's crooked.

356
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,930
And so then the question is,
what would you do about,

357
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,480
well,
if you know your credit,

358
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,400
no,
it's crooked.

359
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,950
It's not so good to play along with it.
I mean,

360
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,110
let's say that you know it's crooked by 
your own standard,

361
00:23:06,111 --> 00:23:09,430
devalues it.
D degrades you to play a long winter,

362
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,430
you to stand up and oppose it.
Well,

363
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,250
no,
probably not.

364
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,533
You're probably gonna do Jonah did you 
don't want to ship and get the hell out 

365
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:24,590
of there and you know,
now it's a logical thing to do,

366
00:23:24,591 --> 00:23:25,424
but it doesn't solve the problem.
And I think this has something to do 

367
00:23:28,401 --> 00:23:32,210
with human ethical responsibility 
because there are other old stories,

368
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:38,300
and I'll tell you one like me were the 
son of the king,

369
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:43,460
the lion king,
the son of the king.

370
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,910
He goes and he's pathetic,
adolescent,

371
00:23:46,911 --> 00:23:47,744
and then he shamed by the reappearance 
of his old girlfriend and him turning 

372
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,304
into something vaguely useful and he 
opens his eyes and he goes back and he 

373
00:23:55,701 --> 00:24:00,230
fights scar and no,
it's a scene of hell,

374
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:01,960
right?
Because there's fire everywhere.

375
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,700
He fights scar,
scar killed.

376
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:07,520
His father,
casts him into the pit,

377
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,383
roughly speaking,
and then the rain comes and then you 

378
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:17,591
know the movie returns to its beginning.
Fundamental Paradise,

379
00:24:17,991 --> 00:24:19,940
Paradise lost,
paradise regained.

380
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,063
That's the movie,
and and that's the story of human 

381
00:24:25,161 --> 00:24:25,994
beings.
You know you're in a place that's 

382
00:24:26,901 --> 00:24:27,734
working out pretty well.
Something happens to knock you off your 

383
00:24:30,591 --> 00:24:31,424
perch.
You're down in chaos for a good amount 

384
00:24:33,321 --> 00:24:34,154
of time and maybe you never get out,
but maybe you learn something down 

385
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:40,100
there.
Maybe you strengthen your character,

386
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:45,190
then you pop up to a new place and maybe
it's better and better.

387
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,790
You.
Now,

388
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,010
I'm not being overly optimistic about 
this.

389
00:24:49,011 --> 00:24:51,980
I know perfectly well that people 
encounter

390
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:58,850
impediments during their life that they 
find almost impossible to recover from,

391
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:04,190
but it's the best shot you have.
So anyways,

392
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:08,750
Jordan runs away,
but God is very happy about that because

393
00:25:08,751 --> 00:25:09,584
it's actually Joe,
his destiny is necessary for Jonah to 

394
00:25:12,591 --> 00:25:17,591
repair the city so God sends a storm
and the waves were high and I think what

395
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:21,554
that means is because the water is often
a symbol for the unconscious and that's 

396
00:25:24,801 --> 00:25:25,634
because things learned down there in the
water and then you could pull up that 

397
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,770
are useful monsters,
things that you can pull up,

398
00:25:30,771 --> 00:25:34,220
their useful.
You can fish for the fishing in your own

399
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,113
being for answers,
which is what you do when you try to 

400
00:25:36,981 --> 00:25:37,814
think.
You ask yourself the question and maybe 

401
00:25:40,961 --> 00:25:42,470
you can answer appearance.
It's like,

402
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,513
where did that come from?
You didn't know what the answer was 

403
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,373
before it appeared,
when it just popped into being an 

404
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,770
nowhere.
Who knows?

405
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,060
So you finish.

406
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,533
So anyways,
the waves come and the bolt's going to 

407
00:25:58,581 --> 00:26:00,470
be knocked over it and that's what 
happens.

408
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:01,304
I think when know when you know you 
should do something mean everyone has 

409
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:05,963
the experience.
I believe perhaps you would be willing 

410
00:26:08,211 --> 00:26:11,120
to put up your hands if this experience 
is foreign to.

411
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,493
Okay.
There's part of you telling you you 

412
00:26:15,381 --> 00:26:16,214
should do something and it's hard to do 
it effortful and maybe you're afraid of 

413
00:26:20,391 --> 00:26:21,620
it,
and so you don't do it.

414
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:23,420
You just procrastinate,
right?

415
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:26,360
And so how do you feel about that?
Good.

416
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,190
I mean,
so what?

417
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:33,920
You feel that you're betraying yourself,
your anxiety actually gets worse,

418
00:26:33,921 --> 00:26:34,754
not better,
even though you know you can put it off 

419
00:26:35,931 --> 00:26:38,420
moment for moment,
but that doesn't help because every time

420
00:26:38,421 --> 00:26:40,520
you put it off,
the anxiety just grows a little bit.

421
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,290
You're proud of yourself.
You have a sense that

422
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,740
you're making things more chaotic than 
they should be known.

423
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:49,703
If you do that long enough,
I'm sure many of you have not 

424
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:52,683
experienced.
If you do that long enough at that 

425
00:26:53,491 --> 00:26:56,760
becomes habitual,
things will get so stormy around you.

426
00:26:56,761 --> 00:27:00,480
Then you will fall right into this feed,
to the chaos,

427
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,990
into the watery chaos,
and maybe you'll drown.

428
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,700
So it's not a very good idea to run from
your destiny.

429
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,563
Let's say

430
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:14,710
whatever that might be and you need an 
estimate.

431
00:27:14,711 --> 00:27:19,600
You need it because that's what gives 
you meaning and you need meaning in your

432
00:27:19,601 --> 00:27:20,434
life because life is hard.
So you know you need something to boxes 

433
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,680
yourself against that.
So anyways,

434
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,873
we make Jonah.
Jonah says that's probably my fault 

435
00:27:30,731 --> 00:27:31,564
because like I'm running away from 
something I'm supposed to do and you 

436
00:27:33,311 --> 00:27:36,040
know on gardens very happy about that.
So why don't you just throw me over.

437
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,100
Overboard.
Crew is very happy about that,

438
00:27:39,101 --> 00:27:39,934
but the waves are really starting to 
come up with Joan is pretty insistent 

439
00:27:42,311 --> 00:27:43,144
that he's the cause of the problem and 
so maybe draw free draw lots and Jonah 

440
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,813
is chosen and so they decided to 
collapse it into the ocean and 

441
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,093
immediately everything's calm.
So he's a center of chaos because he's 

442
00:28:00,851 --> 00:28:03,670
not doing what he's supposed to do.
It's fine.

443
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:08,730
Well then a whale comes up and swallowed
the whale for three days.

444
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:12,183
No,

445
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:15,930
that's a weird thing.
Well,

446
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:20,880
that's the way all the dependencies in 
drag,

447
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,760
it's that thing that you have to go out 
there and conquer,

448
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,190
get something of value.
Now,

449
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,640
when you made an error,
when you

450
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:39,040
fallen off the path where you deviated 
from what you know you should do,

451
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,730
you produces a state of internal chaos 
and worried and concerned.

452
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,230
You're thrust into the unknown.
You're thrust into unknown territory and

453
00:28:48,231 --> 00:28:49,064
chaos.
You don't know what to do and that's 

454
00:28:51,411 --> 00:28:54,350
often symbolized by have you encountered
with a monster,

455
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:57,860
like a dragging somebody that lives 
under the water.

456
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:58,843
That's I think the reason for that is as
far as I've been able to tell is that 

457
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,200
human beings,
because we'd be prey animals for forever

458
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,840
in her battle with carnivorous lizards,
for example,

459
00:29:08,841 --> 00:29:09,674
and alligators and even dinosaurs 
because there were dinosaurs around at 

460
00:29:12,741 --> 00:29:13,574
the time of our most distant ancestors.
There was even a cap at one point that 

461
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:21,881
was.
It was adapted with pierce human skulls,

462
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,413
so it had a head that was exactly shaped
and grab you here through the back of 

463
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:29,810
your skull.

464
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,820
So like we've come through some rough 
times.

465
00:29:31,821 --> 00:29:36,020
Man.
We have a system in our mind.

466
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:37,363
It's a threat Predator detection system.
That's the thing that makes little kids 

467
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,570
thinking about monsters in the dark,
right?

468
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,180
Because while there is monsters in the 
dark,

469
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,290
parents always say,
well,

470
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:50,440
there's no monsters in the dark.
It's like that's not true.

471
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,613
Dark is full of monsters.
There might not be any in your room 

472
00:29:53,771 --> 00:29:54,604
right at that moment,
but that doesn't mean there aren't 

473
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,243
monsters in the dark crimes.
Take place like criminals don't get up 

474
00:30:01,511 --> 00:30:03,620
at six in the morning and like,
you know,

475
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,110
have breakfast and go rob a bank can do 
that sort of thing at night.

476
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,153
People do the things that are fit for 
the night tonight and lots of predators 

477
00:30:15,131 --> 00:30:20,131
are nocturnal and you can't see very 
well in the dark and kids aren't stupid.

478
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,543
They've evolved to stay pretty damn 
close to the fire because of the kids 

479
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:27,424
that wandered away from the fire kicked 
off by hyenas and lions and crocodiles 

480
00:30:33,341 --> 00:30:38,230
and whatever else the hell it was out 
there to eat the unwary.

481
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,480
So

482
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,340
the circuit that we use to defend 
ourselves against predators.

483
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:51,853
As we've evolved cortically,
that circuit has come to represent what 

484
00:30:55,671 --> 00:30:58,420
we don't know in general because the 
predators,

485
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,263
a person count don't know.
And so evolution is a conservative 

486
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,480
forest and we'll use the circuits that 
to representing new things.

487
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,713
So the unknown,
the chaos is often represented by a 

488
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,710
monster swallows you up and pulls you 
down.

489
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,740
I didn't know when you're feeling 
terrible,

490
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:19,970
you know what I'm saying?
Well,

491
00:31:19,971 --> 00:31:23,200
I'm feeling hot.
I'm feeling down well,

492
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:27,540
why is that?
Well down is worse.

493
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,393
I guess you're flat on the ground when 
you're down or you're in a hole or 

494
00:31:30,741 --> 00:31:32,780
something like that.
You're hiding in a hole.

495
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:36,140
You know it's down and you're threatened
by something.

496
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:39,710
If you're threatened by your own 
inadequacy,

497
00:31:39,711 --> 00:31:42,710
that might be part of it.
Maybe that's partly what you imagined as

498
00:31:42,711 --> 00:31:43,544
a monstrous force because you know your 
proclivity towards oppressed 

499
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,413
procrastination and your weakness of 
character is part and parcel of why you 

500
00:31:50,931 --> 00:31:53,210
happened to be in the underworld.

501
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,140
And that's the underworld of 
mythological underworld.

502
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,310
That's where you go when things fall 
apart.

503
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,330
And if you understand that,
if you know that that's what that means,

504
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,373
thank you.
Have One of the keys that opens up 

505
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:11,960
ancient stories to you and you 
understand things you,

506
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:15,080
your life can be organized going very 
well.

507
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:20,090
And then something comes up and 
everything changes.

508
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,953
Some axiom that you were living by it.
It might be the existence of a partner 

509
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:28,250
might be a job that maybe your health,
any of those things

510
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:34,810
go on and you go somewhere,
you go somewhere.

511
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,210
It's a state of being.
You're still in the same world,

512
00:32:38,211 --> 00:32:41,330
but it's not the same all anymore.
Everything about it is different.

513
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,150
It's all negative and dark.
You don't know what to do.

514
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,033
You're confused.
And so what do you do down there in the 

515
00:32:49,011 --> 00:32:50,660
underworld when things are falling 
apart,

516
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,523
especially if hope is it's more possible
case scenario and you realize that you 

517
00:32:56,451 --> 00:33:00,170
actually had something to do with your 
device that's really annoying.

518
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:04,460
You know when something bad happens to 
you and then you know you grind yourself

519
00:33:04,461 --> 00:33:06,950
into bits trying to figure out what the 
hell happened,

520
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:11,951
and then you realize that,
well you were playing a causal role.

521
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,423
Now sometimes you're so depressed.
You assume you're playing a causal role 

522
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:16,783
and you work.
It's not an easy to figure out by any 

523
00:33:18,051 --> 00:33:18,884
stretch of the imagination and it isn't 
the one who chose something terrible is 

524
00:33:22,731 --> 00:33:23,564
at fault for it,
but sometimes you find that you are off 

525
00:33:27,351 --> 00:33:30,920
the path somehow and maybe even that you
knew it and didn't attend to it,

526
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:36,340
and that's why all of this kid
and so then down there in that chaos,

527
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,053
you decide that you're going to do what 
you're supposed to do instead and then 

528
00:33:42,411 --> 00:33:45,170
maybe you get to rise up again,
renewed.

529
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,633
If you're locking and then you can go 
fix the city and that's what this 

530
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:57,530
story's about and that's why I picked 
the image to represent the course.

531
00:33:57,531 --> 00:34:00,680
Because really what happens,
you see it with the psychoanalysts,

532
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,660
the road due to health.
If you're not doing well,

533
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,060
which means that as you act in the 
world,

534
00:34:08,061 --> 00:34:08,894
you're not getting what you want.
There's something wrong with your match 

535
00:34:12,141 --> 00:34:15,140
between your presuppositions and your 
actions,

536
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,093
habitual and the way the world is 
responding to you so it's not turning 

537
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:22,520
out for you.
And the question is,

538
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:23,990
well,
what can you do about that?

539
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,513
And one answer might be to examine 
yourself for presuppositions and action 

540
00:34:29,511 --> 00:34:30,344
patterns that are not serving you will 
find out what they are and what to do 

541
00:34:34,251 --> 00:34:35,084
about.
Maybe some of that is maybe you're not 

542
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:37,933
moving forward because of fear.
That fear is grounded in terrible 

543
00:34:40,461 --> 00:34:41,294
experiences that you've had in the past 
that he's never been able to understand 

544
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,833
and maybe one of the ways of gluing 
yourself back together and expanding 

545
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:52,430
your personality so that you could in 
fact live properly in the world,

546
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:57,490
is to go back to those terrible events 
and untied,

547
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,770
straightened them out and understand the
and drop them,

548
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:05,840
and that's what psychotherapy is about.
In large part,

549
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,690
psychoanalytic behavioral doesn't 
matter.

550
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:12,140
What are you afraid of?
What are you avoiding?

551
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:15,110
What are you finding to develop maybe 
from fear,

552
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:18,470
maybe from avoidance,
God only knows maybe from discuss.

553
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:21,973
How can you get over it?
How can you reclaim those parts of your 

554
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,003
self?
I sent in the first lecture that I was 

555
00:35:41,331 --> 00:35:42,164
going to try to provide you with Schema
into which you can place the theorists 

556
00:35:48,011 --> 00:35:52,400
that we're going to discuss
requires going down deep.

557
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:55,250
To do that,
your presuppositions,

558
00:35:55,251 --> 00:35:56,084
my presupposition,
and this is a psychoanalytic 

559
00:35:57,441 --> 00:35:59,120
presupposition,
it's predicated

560
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:05,380
on a poetic tradition,
I would say rancher tuition.

561
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,130
I learned most of it for breeding young 
was Carl Young.

562
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:09,973
The
help me understand that we're nested 

563
00:36:13,451 --> 00:36:17,950
inside a dream.
I guess we don't know everything.

564
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,833
We have to take things as givens and 
things that be taken as given to nested 

565
00:36:25,841 --> 00:36:26,674
inside stories and we accept the stories
and then outside of the stories is the 

566
00:36:32,921 --> 00:36:35,220
absolute,
you know,

567
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,420
and that's partly.
The stories are tricky,

568
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,450
you know,
if one of the classic stories,

569
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,830
Very Jonah's story I would say is

570
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:48,903
St George and the Dragon Story was 
represented in renaissance and your 

571
00:36:56,510 --> 00:37:00,180
immediate
thousands and thousands of ways.

572
00:37:00,181 --> 00:37:04,920
It's like the story of St Patrick who 
chased the snakes out of Ireland.

573
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,873
Same idea.
And the typical say George story is 

574
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:16,470
hobbit or Harry Potter.
So in the second volume of Harry Potter,

575
00:37:17,491 --> 00:37:19,290
correct me if I have any of these 
details.

576
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,210
Roger,
remember there's that snake,

577
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,060
the Bass lisc.
So there's this magic castle,

578
00:37:24,061 --> 00:37:24,894
right?
You guys have no problem with magic 

579
00:37:26,221 --> 00:37:27,330
castle.
No problem.

580
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,340
Here's an artist.
He was an orphan.

581
00:37:29,341 --> 00:37:34,200
He goes to the magic castle to learn how
to be more than normal with the models.

582
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,780
He has a muggle family,
were not too happy with them.

583
00:37:36,781 --> 00:37:37,614
I'll go family like as representatives 
of normal people think they have some 

584
00:37:42,691 --> 00:37:43,560
blacks now.
Of course,

585
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:44,970
the reason for that is that,
well,

586
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:48,660
that's what teenagers often feel.
Both your parents elt is this.

587
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,493
These could really be my parents.
I must have some other parents who were 

588
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:56,070
like together.
Those are like magical parents,

589
00:37:56,071 --> 00:37:58,260
right?
Parents that live in the sky,

590
00:37:58,261 --> 00:38:00,810
and of course Harry Potter has earthly 
parents.

591
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:04,410
Thoughts.
Mongols nervously I think is the kid.

592
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:07,020
He's at one.
He's a wonderful piece of work.

593
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:11,850
You know,
it will form a spoiled,

594
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:15,060
the old form selfish very far from the 
ideal.

595
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,510
He's a foil for Harry and of course he's
appreciated.

596
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:22,140
Doted on and Harry is actually punished 
for his virtues.

597
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,740
That's a classic story.
Him To be punished for your virtues.

598
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,550
If you look at the story central story 
in Christianity,

599
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:30,923
the central story in Christianity is 
about someone who is precisely punished 

600
00:38:33,721 --> 00:38:34,554
in the worst possible,
waiting for the highest possible 

601
00:38:35,951 --> 00:38:36,784
virtues.
That's what it makes it an architect of 

602
00:38:38,031 --> 00:38:41,050
the story because there isn't anything 
more unfair than that,

603
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,270
and so it's a limit in a sense.

604
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,480
It can't be worse than that.
Being punished for being,

605
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:47,650
you know,
unworthy.

606
00:38:47,651 --> 00:38:48,400
It's like,
yeah,

607
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,690
I will at least make sense,
but to be punished because you have your

608
00:38:52,691 --> 00:38:56,350
act together and you're a good person.
That's real punishment.

609
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:57,803
That's what happens to Harry.
So luckily you find out things magical 

610
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,753
like convenient and off he goes to 
wizarding school and you know that's 

611
00:39:06,641 --> 00:39:07,474
actually like taking.
That's actually like going and studying 

612
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,320
the humanities.
I mean it was when they still were.

613
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:20,420
No,
because it's through the humanities that

614
00:39:20,951 --> 00:39:21,784
you,
that you made contact with the magic of 

615
00:39:23,651 --> 00:39:24,484
your culture and that makes you more 
than merely the child of your parents 

616
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:30,843
because you are more than married the 
child of your parents or the child of 

617
00:39:32,981 --> 00:39:33,814
nature and you're the child of culture 
and until you understand what that 

618
00:39:38,981 --> 00:39:39,814
means,
understand that you have two sets of 

619
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:43,870
parents,
like the divide here always has two sets

620
00:39:43,871 --> 00:39:44,704
of parents.

621
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:49,420
You can't construe yourself property as 
an individual.

622
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:51,790
You're not situated properly in the 
world,

623
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:54,190
you don't know what your 
responsibilities are,

624
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:55,024
you can't orient your values property 
and you will suffer for that because as 

625
00:39:59,711 --> 00:40:03,520
far as I can tell,
because life is so difficult,

626
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,200
you have to do something that's truly 
work while in order to justify it and so

627
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,590
on.
That's what all these stories tell you.

628
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,473
That's story of Jonah is telling you.
It's like you have an ethical duty to 

629
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:23,320
straighten things up and if you don't do
it,

630
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:29,080
you're going to be soaring
and that story's apple everywhere.

631
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,220
Well now,
St George.

632
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:32,080
Well,
let's go to Harry Potter.

633
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:37,150
We're talking about.
So he goes off the magic castle and he's

634
00:40:37,151 --> 00:40:37,984
learning to be a wizard and he's kind of
an interesting character because he's 

635
00:40:41,651 --> 00:40:45,760
not really good and we find out what I 
think that's because because they have a

636
00:40:45,761 --> 00:40:48,350
piece of all the marketing.

637
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,360
Isn't that what happens?
Yeah,

638
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:56,010
and that's what that means is that
to be good,

639
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:59,290
truly good,
you kind of just follow the rules.

640
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,183
That's,
that's very clear in the merit order 

641
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,043
store and you also have to be able to 
understand malevolence and in order to 

642
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:08,440
understand malevolence so that you can 
withstand it.

643
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,490
You have to understand that part of you.
That's

644
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,720
because if you don't,
you're naive.

645
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,013
If you're naive,
you're easy pickings and so that's a 

646
00:41:18,251 --> 00:41:19,084
union idea too and the union idea is 
that part of personality development is 

647
00:41:22,511 --> 00:41:23,344
to understand your shadow and the shadow
is those things about you you do not 

648
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:33,690
want to admit to and you could learn 
about your shouted by reading history.

649
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,473
You can read about Auschwitz,
you've been redeveloped the 

650
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:44,390
concentration camps in Russia and you 
can imagine yourself as a garden

651
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:51,440
instead of as a heroic rescue robot,
unfortunate victims,

652
00:41:51,441 --> 00:41:54,110
which would be very,
very unlikely.

653
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,800
And once you can imagine yourself as a 
guard,

654
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:58,663
which is a terrifying thing to do,
then you understand something about 

655
00:42:03,981 --> 00:42:06,770
yourself.
And I actually think,

656
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,633
and I think this is also from students,
got a young but you cannot have proper 

657
00:42:11,481 --> 00:42:12,314
respect for yourself until you know that
you're a monster because he won't act 

658
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:17,940
carefully enough.
Or you think,

659
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,100
well,
I'm a nice first night,

660
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:20,660
never do anyone any harm.
It's like,

661
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:21,860
you know,
safe.

662
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:25,670
You can be sure of that and the harm 
that you do.

663
00:42:25,671 --> 00:42:26,504
People can come in many,
many ways and so if you regard yourself 

664
00:42:30,531 --> 00:42:32,750
as harmless,
inoffensive,

665
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:33,973
nice,
well where do you have any reason to be 

666
00:42:37,161 --> 00:42:37,994
fearful?
You're like a teddy bear sitting on the 

667
00:42:39,741 --> 00:42:41,900
shelf.
Even if you throw it at someone,

668
00:42:41,901 --> 00:42:44,290
no one's going to get hurt,
but that was the one that your life,

669
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:45,163
because you're a human being and human 
beings are some vicious creatures and 

670
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:53,690
there's utility and knowing that because
it's also the case,

671
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,023
you know when the Harry Potter series 
very could stand up against fool to 

672
00:42:57,231 --> 00:42:58,064
learn and understand and speak his 
language because he was effected by him 

673
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,990
to some degree.
Very,

674
00:43:02,991 --> 00:43:04,910
very interesting idea.
Anyways,

675
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,940
in the second hand,
the reason I tell you this,

676
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:12,140
and this is where thinking about
how long were each of those

677
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:14,983
500 pages here longing and there was how
many of its seven and how many were 

678
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,980
sold.
I mean,

679
00:43:21,981 --> 00:43:23,920
how many of you read every Harry Potter 
book?

680
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,753
Right?
That's how many of you read at least 

681
00:43:29,601 --> 00:43:32,030
one.
Okay?

682
00:43:32,031 --> 00:43:35,660
How many of you saw the movies?
It's like you're all in a cult.

683
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,080
You are.
I'm telling you.

684
00:43:39,081 --> 00:43:40,190
Really,
that's the truth.

685
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:44,900
It's really the truth.
So in the second volume,

686
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,460
there's a snake that zipping around 
there,

687
00:43:46,461 --> 00:43:47,380
the bass list,
right?

688
00:43:47,381 --> 00:43:50,810
And it lives in the underground.
That's chaos.

689
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:54,590
That's chaos,
and that's because wherever you are,

690
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,560
you're on thin ice and underneath your 
thin ice as chaos.

691
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:58,603
And here we are in this unbelievably 
civilized environment and everyone's 

692
00:44:02,331 --> 00:44:07,310
getting along perfectly,
but you know the lights,

693
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:10,130
the electricity,
sewage system is working.

694
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:14,210
No one's hungry.
It's like you can be peaceful,

695
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:15,503
but if any of that fell apart and it 
could easily fall apart because it's a 

696
00:44:18,471 --> 00:44:19,304
bloody miracle it ever works at all,
then the chaos that's just underneath 

697
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:26,840
the surface is going to come up right 
now.

698
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:31,410
And it's useful to know that because it 
makes you properly grateful.

699
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:32,363
If you really understand it,
it makes you properly grateful for the 

700
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:39,030
bloody miracle.
It is that you can be here in peace.

701
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:42,300
So anyways,
there's this snake that's underneath the

702
00:44:42,301 --> 00:44:47,040
surface and it's no joke,
it's vague and it's ancient.

703
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:50,030
It's always been there.
And what happens if you look at it,

704
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,690
it turns you to stone,
right?

705
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,040
You're paralyzed.
Well,

706
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:57,690
that's the,
that's the Gorgon,

707
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,290
that's Medusa.
The woman with the head of snakes.

708
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:03,270
And if you look at her,
it paralyzes you.

709
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:05,340
What does that mean?
Well,

710
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:08,850
you're walking through the jungle and a 
snake appears.

711
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:09,743
What do you do?
You freeze and no bloody wonder because 

712
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,453
you're a prey animal and that's what 
they do when they see things that are 

713
00:45:16,501 --> 00:45:21,000
going to eat them.
And so the snake,

714
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:22,403
well,
lots of people still die from a snake 

715
00:45:23,931 --> 00:45:24,764
bite.

716
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,333
And

717
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,273
our ancestors were,
I don't mean our ancestors like you 

718
00:45:30,491 --> 00:45:31,324
know,
tens of millions of years ago when they 

719
00:45:32,721 --> 00:45:36,710
were living in trees and were very big,
they made a nice snack for a snake.

720
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,633
And there's a woman named Lynn Isabelle,
who's an anthropologist at Ucla who's 

721
00:45:40,911 --> 00:45:41,744
correlated the presence of carnivorous 
snakes with the acuity of primate 

722
00:45:46,731 --> 00:45:47,564
vision.
And what she found was that the more 

723
00:45:49,341 --> 00:45:51,980
snakes around the pattern of primates 
could see.

724
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:54,133
So,
and we're particularly good at picking 

725
00:45:56,211 --> 00:46:00,900
up patterns like snake camouflage in the
Lord half of our visual quadrant here,

726
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:03,530
when people generally don't like snakes,
you can learn to handle them.

727
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:04,863
No snake fear appears to be a native to 
native disease and it tends to increase 

728
00:46:09,021 --> 00:46:11,630
as you age rather than decreasing.
You can overcome it.

729
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:13,693
Well,
my daughter had snakes and one day 

730
00:46:15,061 --> 00:46:17,120
versus the spinner,
it was a fairly big snake

731
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,470
and she hasn't paid attention to it for 
awhile.

732
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:22,323
So it nailed her.
And from then on she had had very 

733
00:46:26,261 --> 00:46:29,920
difficult time grabbing the snake.
It was like once

734
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:32,463
shy permanently.
She also told me years later she had 

735
00:46:35,801 --> 00:46:38,820
nightmares about snakes all the time 
when she had a snake in the room.

736
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,980
You know what?
I think it was probably the smell.

737
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:47,580
So anyways,
so Harry Potter decides he's going to go

738
00:46:47,951 --> 00:46:48,784
after the Vassilis Greg,
he's going to go out there and face the 

739
00:46:50,411 --> 00:46:55,411
thing that he's most afraid of.
So does that way down in the dance.

740
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:57,003
So it's like Joan up going down into the
depths and he faces the task list kind 

741
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:05,170
of bikes and you know that's.
That's right,

742
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,660
because if you go down into the depths,
you can get fit.

743
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:12,610
It's no joke.
I mean this is a hero story,

744
00:47:12,611 --> 00:47:15,110
but the thing about the hero stories,
it's actually real.

745
00:47:15,111 --> 00:47:17,860
The thing that you're facing is actually
dangerous.

746
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:18,873
And even though facing it voluntarily 
might be your best bet and is likely 

747
00:47:23,111 --> 00:47:23,944
your best bet,
because that's the central story of 

748
00:47:25,151 --> 00:47:25,984
humanity.
That doesn't mean you're going to 

749
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,500
succeed.
It's the thing.

750
00:47:29,501 --> 00:47:30,730
So anyways,
he gets bitten,

751
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:32,980
right?
And he's going to die.

752
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,700
Now he's rescuing Jimmy.
So that's the St George Story.

753
00:47:36,701 --> 00:47:41,510
If you go after a dragon,
dragons like to capture virgin,

754
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:45,890
God only knows why.
I think it's how it goes.

755
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:52,923
I think it's because one of the things 
that male humans have done from the 

756
00:47:55,991 --> 00:47:59,680
beginning of time just chase the damn 
predators away.

757
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:01,463
And I suspect that the males from God 
only knows how long ago who were 

758
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:08,374
particularly good at that we're rewarded
with female attention and why the hell 

759
00:48:13,961 --> 00:48:18,130
not so.
It's deeply rooted inside of us,

760
00:48:18,131 --> 00:48:21,820
that idea of facing the unknown and 
freeing the woman.

761
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:22,683
So the idea there is that if you.
It's a male idea in large part I can 

762
00:48:26,831 --> 00:48:30,410
talk about central female myth and then 
we'll proceed.

763
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:31,803
Idea is that if you're the sort of 
person who can stand up against the 

764
00:48:36,701 --> 00:48:37,534
unknown and the frightening,
then you're also likely develop into 

765
00:48:41,171 --> 00:48:42,004
that sort of person.
Then you're also likely to develop into 

766
00:48:43,511 --> 00:48:46,210
the sort of person that other people 
will find attractive.

767
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,633
So you know,
and that's why you don't believe that 

768
00:48:50,801 --> 00:48:54,830
the inside the shadow was the anima,
which is like a female finger.

769
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:57,870
So his idea was something like,
you don't.

770
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:01,060
If you look watch movies as long as this
data male guy,

771
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:02,413
is there a romantic movie you said he's 
a nice guy and he's a friend and you 

772
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:05,734
know,
the woman tells him everything that she 

773
00:49:06,671 --> 00:49:10,500
has liked him a bit.
She likes the guy who's like got an edge

774
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:14,010
and who's capable of,
I would say ma'am,

775
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:14,903
but at least of aggression.
That doesn't mean she wants him to be 

776
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:19,654
aggressive,
but it does mean is that she wants him 

777
00:49:21,251 --> 00:49:23,950
to be able to be aggressive.
That would be good,

778
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,113
and so he's the romantic target and so 
he's the person that's incorporate 

779
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:29,043
shadow.
He's suddenly respectable and perhaps 

780
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:35,220
useful and so.
Well,

781
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,440
that's a very little storage.

782
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:52,540
So let's,
let's think about this for a minute.

783
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:57,900
I've already offered you a proposition.
I think it's an important proposition.

784
00:49:58,840 --> 00:49:59,673
I'm offering you this proposition so 
that you can make sense of art and 

785
00:50:03,971 --> 00:50:04,804
literature and mythology and religion 
and dance and all those strange 

786
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:13,530
ritualistic things that human beings do,
which seems central to us,

787
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:18,590
including included not least,
the ineradicable tendency.

788
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:25,310
I've asked to seek out stories of heroes
when I should finish the Harry Potter.

789
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,540
Harry Potter goes down there to rescue 
Virginia,

790
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:39,940
but is that.
There's a formal name,

791
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:43,690
Virginia anyways,
which is very virgin.

792
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:48,130
So it gets just.
Yes,

793
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:49,160
Jeanette.
That's it.

794
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:54,320
It gets better and the bite is poisonous
and so there is dying.

795
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:58,160
This doesn't seem to be so good.
And then what happens?

796
00:50:58,220 --> 00:50:59,660
And again,
you guys swallowed this.

797
00:50:59,661 --> 00:51:02,780
It's no problem.
So what's his name?

798
00:51:02,781 --> 00:51:05,740
The dumbledore character.
He's got a bird,

799
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:06,583
right?

800
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:09,860
So he's the wise old man.
He's the ruler of the castle.

801
00:51:09,861 --> 00:51:13,310
He's the ruler of the magic castle.
He's the magic king.

802
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:18,230
He's like God the father as far as Harry
Potter is concerned.

803
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:20,300
And he has a bird.
What kind of bird is it?

804
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:22,700
Is a phoenix.
Right?

805
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:24,620
And one of the things that's very 
strange,

806
00:51:24,621 --> 00:51:27,350
but phoenix is that,
well it's a mortal,

807
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,600
but in a strange way,
you know,

808
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:33,170
it may have some as I think 100 years 
and it gets older and older and then one

809
00:51:33,171 --> 00:51:38,171
day the burst into flames and turns into
an egg and then you get a new phoenix.

810
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:43,940
So that was a symbol of transformation.
It's a symbol of transformation.

811
00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:49,150
The burden is a spirit or psyche.
And so here's what it means in part,

812
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:51,083
you know,
you know how when you learn a lesson in 

813
00:51:54,261 --> 00:51:56,450
your life that that's not very pleasant,
right?

814
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:59,420
It's not like when you learn something 
important,

815
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:01,003
it's the best day of your life.
It's often the importance of what you 

816
00:52:05,631 --> 00:52:09,480
learned is often proportionate to just 
how wretched it is to learn it.

817
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:11,390
You know,
you learn things the hard way.

818
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:16,630
You learn things by getting hit because 
obviously if you're doing is working,

819
00:52:16,941 --> 00:52:20,570
you can get what you want and there's no
learning in that and that's happy.

820
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:21,583
It's when you're doing something and you
hit an obstacle and Nydia bloody well 

821
00:52:25,551 --> 00:52:28,890
hit it hard and then you know,
you recoil and then down into the depths

822
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:32,020
you go and you have to sort your out.
You realize that you're,

823
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:33,033
you know,
this particular kind of idiots and that 

824
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,353
you should probably fix that and that's 
really annoying and difficult and you 

825
00:52:38,241 --> 00:52:39,074
know,
and maybe you're down in the dumps and 

826
00:52:40,581 --> 00:52:43,760
anxious for quite a while and then you 
get it repaired more or less than,

827
00:52:43,761 --> 00:52:45,410
you know,
you put yourself back together.

828
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:50,770
That's the Phoenix who into flames,
Bang a new you.

829
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:56,060
And so you know,
that's the ability to learn.

830
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:59,020
Human beings are very strange creatures,
right?

831
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:03,410
Because we're very malleable compared to
most animals.

832
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:06,020
Like grizzly bear is now in prison 
bears.

833
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:08,540
A thousand years ago it was like 
whatever.

834
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:11,510
They are the same thing.
They do the same thing,

835
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:13,933
there's no transformation,
but human beings we have this massive 

836
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:20,720
brain and you know,
it's a pain because if he'd have to take

837
00:53:20,721 --> 00:53:25,721
care of human children until they're 40
and that's a big burden and so,

838
00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:29,100
you know,
we pay a big price for it.

839
00:53:29,101 --> 00:53:31,730
It also makes child birth very difficult
and,

840
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:33,383
and it's costly.
You have to eat a lot because we have a 

841
00:53:34,901 --> 00:53:38,940
big brain,
uses a lot of energy and so you know,

842
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:39,903
you pay a price for it,
but the advantage is your plastic you 

843
00:53:42,961 --> 00:53:43,794
can learn.

844
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,113
Now learning is a strange thing because 
you can take a minute of just acquiring 

845
00:53:50,041 --> 00:53:50,874
more information.
You could also think of it and this is 

846
00:53:54,241 --> 00:53:55,074
more accurate as
finding out something that you're doing 

847
00:53:58,801 --> 00:53:59,634
wrong.
So that's sort of built into like a 

848
00:54:01,111 --> 00:54:03,720
character caring element of your 
character,

849
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:07,680
presumption of your perception or a deep
habit really built into you.

850
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,360
So neuro structure,
right?

851
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,113
It's a lie and you have to kill it 
because it isn't working properly and 

852
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:16,663
the pain that you go through in part 
when you're suffering because he did 

853
00:54:19,021 --> 00:54:22,350
something stupid,
is something like you're,

854
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,353
you're.
The neurology can never get this quite 

855
00:54:26,851 --> 00:54:27,684
right.
It's the pain of the depth of that 

856
00:54:29,971 --> 00:54:32,970
structure and that could be a huge chunk
of,

857
00:54:32,971 --> 00:54:33,804
you know,
if you really have to go through a 

858
00:54:35,611 --> 00:54:36,444
massive revision,
it's like the person that comes out the 

859
00:54:39,931 --> 00:54:42,660
other end might be the same at all.

860
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:43,591
You know,
that happens.

861
00:54:43,591 --> 00:54:46,380
For example,
if you're trying to combat alcoholism,

862
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,310
which is just,
you know,

863
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:49,303
ratchet thing to do because well,
all your friends are alcoholics in your 

864
00:54:53,971 --> 00:54:54,804
family drinks too much.
The only thing you know how to do when 

865
00:54:57,031 --> 00:54:59,640
you're socializing is to go to the bar 
and drink too much.

866
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,880
You know,
you spend like 20 hours a week on it.

867
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,073
It's like,
it's not just that you're addicted to 

868
00:55:06,481 --> 00:55:09,060
the substance.
It's like that's how you live.

869
00:55:09,061 --> 00:55:11,310
And so if you want to stop being an 
alcoholic,

870
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:14,010
not only do you have to stop drinking 
alcohol,

871
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:14,844
but you have to stop seeing all your 
drunk friends and maybe you've had them 

872
00:55:18,391 --> 00:55:22,620
for your whole life and you have to have
continual battles with your drunk family

873
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,470
and then you have to figure out 
something to do with that 20 hours.

874
00:55:25,471 --> 00:55:29,160
It's now like hanging around your neck 
like an albatross.

875
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:30,563
And so you have to live that whole part 
of the personality die and a new part 

876
00:55:35,161 --> 00:55:38,880
has to spring forth.
And that's what the Phoenix is.

877
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:43,050
Phoenix is the capacity of the person to
transport.

878
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:48,490
And so when Harry gets bit by a snake 
and the threes is him,

879
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,740
he gets seriously injured.
The Phoenix comes in Christ,

880
00:55:52,741 --> 00:55:56,260
some tears in his wound
repair,

881
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,310
some May.
He's back to life.

882
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:05,540
And the strange thing is,
that's okay with all the viewers.

883
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:11,880
Why would that be?
There's nothing about if it's rational,

884
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:17,830
nothing.
Magic castle that's not rational.

885
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:22,260
Giant snake underneath it.
That's a little more rational

886
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:27,220
turning you to stone going down there to
face it,

887
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:29,380
being rejuvenated by a phoenix.
It's like,

888
00:56:29,381 --> 00:56:29,741
yeah,
yeah,

889
00:56:29,741 --> 00:56:33,240
that's okay.
We can watch that little swallow.

890
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:35,800
It will be completely engaged in it.
Then the reason for that,

891
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:39,310
because it's a myth,
it's about how people.

892
00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:44,320
It's a medicine about how to act,
how to conduct yourself in the world,

893
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:49,000
face the things that you're afraid of 
that would otherwise paralyze you to let

894
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:54,780
the depth of what is insufficient vote 
you will occur,

895
00:56:55,450 --> 00:57:00,450
and then to wait for the rebirth.
Okay,

896
00:57:03,321 --> 00:57:05,870
so science is about what the world is

897
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:07,813
and

898
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:13,680
myth and drama and dream of young 
parents.

899
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:18,610
All of that.
Let's say the aesthetic and artistic and

900
00:57:18,611 --> 00:57:23,560
fantastic side that's more about how 
things should be.

901
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:24,453
It's more about how to act.
There are lessons in how to act and 

902
00:57:28,151 --> 00:57:30,970
they're abstract lessons.
People are capable of abstraction,

903
00:57:30,971 --> 00:57:32,230
right?
So you say,

904
00:57:32,231 --> 00:57:33,064
well there's something new and there's 
something about you and there's 

905
00:57:35,701 --> 00:57:36,534
something new and it's not about you.
And so we'll take all the good things 

906
00:57:40,611 --> 00:57:41,444
and make one good thing on that and you 
take all the bad things and make one 

907
00:57:43,481 --> 00:57:44,314
batch of that.
And then we sort of understand the 

908
00:57:45,851 --> 00:57:46,684
difference between good and bad.
And we get better and better and better 

909
00:57:48,881 --> 00:57:52,030
and better at that over the centuries as
we distilled out.

910
00:57:52,031 --> 00:57:52,864
And then we have a figure of ultimate 
good and if they of ultimate evil and 

911
00:57:55,661 --> 00:57:58,690
that helps us understand what those two 
things are.

912
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,313
Those are the hostile brothers.
That's a very common mythological 

913
00:58:03,151 --> 00:58:04,680
motifs.
And you could say,

914
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:05,514
well they're at war inside you.
And I think that that's a universal 

915
00:58:10,051 --> 00:58:14,270
truth.
It's an existential truth.

916
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:19,843
The domain of ethics and morality is how
are we in the world and what should we 

917
00:58:23,421 --> 00:58:24,440
be?
What's the good?

918
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:25,970
And the reason I'm telling you,
oh,

919
00:58:25,971 --> 00:58:26,804
this part from the fact that you should 
know it because this is what you should 

920
00:58:28,941 --> 00:58:29,774
know if you go through university,
is that the bears directly on issues of 

921
00:58:33,441 --> 00:58:36,500
health.
You're trying to accomplish something.

922
00:58:36,501 --> 00:58:37,334
Say if you go see a psychotherapist,
you know you can see what I'm trying to 

923
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:40,910
help you,
but you know,

924
00:58:40,911 --> 00:58:44,660
that's not really what you're trying to 
do when you go see your therapist is get

925
00:58:44,661 --> 00:58:47,600
your life together.
And that's not the same thing.

926
00:58:47,601 --> 00:58:48,434
You know,
like mostly when I'm acting as a 

927
00:58:51,441 --> 00:58:52,274
therapist,
it's not like I'm directly treating 

928
00:58:53,751 --> 00:58:56,150
mental disorders,
mental disorders aren't.

929
00:58:56,230 --> 00:58:57,063
They're just not neat little boxes.
It's not like someone has a fully 

930
00:59:00,111 --> 00:59:04,400
functioning life but they have an 
anxiety disorder and then you bring them

931
00:59:04,401 --> 00:59:05,960
in,
you treat the anxiety disorder and he go

932
00:59:05,961 --> 00:59:07,490
back to their fully functioning life.

933
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:08,653
It's not like that at all.
The disorders tangled out into their 

934
00:59:11,361 --> 00:59:11,961
life.
You know,

935
00:59:11,961 --> 00:59:12,794
if you're depressed,
well usually either workplace isn't 

936
00:59:15,321 --> 00:59:16,154
going very well and your relationships 
with the people around you are damaged 

937
00:59:18,201 --> 00:59:19,034
and you know you're connected in the 
actual with all of these things and so 

938
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:24,763
when you come to see a therapist,
you have to work on putting your life 

939
00:59:27,621 --> 00:59:28,454
together in a sustainable manner and 
that certainly not just removing the 

940
00:59:32,271 --> 00:59:36,290
mental illness is very rare now.
And then you see someone who's depressed

941
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:37,603
whose life is together and they're are 
just depressed because something's gone 

942
00:59:40,191 --> 00:59:44,540
wrong probably biochemically and so with
someone like that.

943
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:46,420
Have you been asked to give them an 
Ssri?

944
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,480
I can't give them to you,
but I can recommend them.

945
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:54,910
Recommend they go see a doctor anyways 
and that's sometimes just does the trick

946
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,640
because you know their life is actually 
pretty good.

947
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:00,590
They just can't see it,
but that's funny.

948
01:00:00,591 --> 01:00:03,140
Rare man.
It's usually the case that someone comes

949
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:03,974
and sees you with things that are in a 
serious state of chaos and all of that 

950
01:00:07,431 --> 01:00:08,264
has to be addressed in some of it's 
psychological and a lot of it's just 

951
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:13,910
practical.
It's embedded in there in the world.

952
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:15,673
That's what the behavioral psychology,
behavioral psychology is particularly 

953
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:19,610
concerned about.
So anyways,

954
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:20,953
psychology,
especially the clinical end is 

955
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:27,590
predicated on necessarily predicated on 
the question,

956
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:30,140
how is it that we obtain good,
good,

957
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:33,200
and what would that be?
One of my clients first come to see me.

958
01:00:33,201 --> 01:00:35,330
One of the things I often ask them is,
okay,

959
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:37,670
well let's say you look a year ahead.
What do you want?

960
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:39,920
What are we aiming at?
What would,

961
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:42,290
what would your life isn't the way you 
want it to be?

962
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:43,573
How would it look if it was the way you 
wanted it to be these parking that way 

963
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:51,470
and we ain't get them right.
When we look for impediments,

964
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:54,230
psychological impediments,
fears,

965
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:56,630
avoidance strategies,
that sort of thing,

966
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:01,430
and we developed strategies and we try 
to move towards that.

967
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:07,090
I would say ideal.
Do you understand the categories?

968
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,880
You have to understand something about 
the nature.

969
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:19,660
Now categorization is a tricky thing and
we're gonna run through some complicated

970
01:01:20,721 --> 01:01:25,250
ideas relatively quickly.
You know,

971
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:30,290
you think you put things in the same 
category because they're similar,

972
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:34,670
but the problem is is that first of all,
that's not an answer.

973
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:39,350
It's just the restatement of the initial
proposition and second of all,

974
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:41,453
you can put things in the same category 
that are by no means identical and you 

975
01:01:44,331 --> 01:01:46,790
often do that.
And third,

976
01:01:46,791 --> 01:01:51,530
it's things are things that are similar,
are often also importantly different.

977
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:56,030
And so peggy,
which element of similarity,

978
01:01:56,570 --> 01:01:57,403
you know,
like let's say you have a group of 

979
01:01:59,091 --> 01:01:59,781
books,
will,

980
01:01:59,781 --> 01:02:04,781
are they the same will obviously no 
because they're all the same book,

981
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:07,543
but the category of books,
it's a pretty strange category because 

982
01:02:10,221 --> 01:02:11,054
the content that the book differs 
completely well when you could still 

983
01:02:12,981 --> 01:02:17,590
make a group of books and you pick some 
arbitrary element that unites them.

984
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:20,790
And consider that grounds to make a 
category.

985
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:22,823
There's other categories and more 
scientific categories in scientific 

986
01:02:25,771 --> 01:02:26,604
categories.
10 actually contain things that are 

987
01:02:29,071 --> 01:02:32,350
very,
very similar across multiple dimensions.

988
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:35,070
Protons are like that as far as I can 
tell,

989
01:02:35,071 --> 01:02:37,650
there's nothing that distinguishes one 
proton from another.

990
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:40,290
Same with electrons.
And you know,

991
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:43,440
the set of triangles is like that 
because you can define it precisely,

992
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:47,820
but most of the categories that human 
beings aren't so neat.

993
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,510
And the problem with that is that unless
the categories are neat,

994
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:52,373
like scientific categories,
it's very difficult to investigate them 

995
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,810
scientifically.
So for example,

996
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:01,910
you might do research on a group of 
people with anxiety disorders,

997
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:03,353
but the problem with that is that the 
anxiety disorder category is so 

998
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:12,770
heterogeneous that it's almost 
impossible to identify the commonalities

999
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,860
across all the people are in that 
category.

1000
01:03:16,861 --> 01:03:20,280
And that's part of the category isn't 
actually a scientific category.

1001
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:23,760
It's a hybrid category.
It's a practical category.

1002
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:25,920
I can give you an example of that.

1003
01:03:36,110 --> 01:03:37,350
Wow.

1004
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:49,380
No,
I can't say it anyways.

1005
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:50,723
Many of the DSM categories.
So these are categories for second 

1006
01:03:53,011 --> 01:03:57,330
pathology require.
If you're part of that category,

1007
01:03:57,331 --> 01:03:58,164
imagine there's seven symptoms that you 
could have read symptoms that you could 

1008
01:04:00,730 --> 01:04:03,810
have put you in that category,
like social personality,

1009
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:06,800
eight symptoms.
You still kick,

1010
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:09,690
you hit you bite,
you know you're abusive.

1011
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:12,720
I don't remember the category categories
precisely,

1012
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:13,883
but you can be in the category.
If you have symptoms two through five 

1013
01:04:16,771 --> 01:04:19,620
and you can be in the category.
If you have symptoms six through eight,

1014
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:22,680
they aren't the same symptoms,
but you're in the same category.

1015
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:23,421
Do you think?
Well,

1016
01:04:23,421 --> 01:04:24,750
how they.
How can that be?

1017
01:04:24,990 --> 01:04:27,210
Well,
that's a family resemblance category.

1018
01:04:27,211 --> 01:04:28,044
Roughly speaking.
Lots of the things that we use our 

1019
01:04:30,001 --> 01:04:33,900
family resemblance category.
There's a prototype and then if you have

1020
01:04:33,901 --> 01:04:38,870
enough of the features of that prototype
and the prototype has 10 features and if

1021
01:04:38,871 --> 01:04:43,500
you haven't six of those features,
you get to be in that category,

1022
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:47,070
but it means that the categories are 
actually quite diverse and that's one of

1023
01:04:47,071 --> 01:04:48,270
the problems that plagues

1024
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:52,253
how psychiatry as a science and clinical
psychologist and science really big 

1025
01:04:55,441 --> 01:04:56,274
problems because if the categories are 
homogenous and it's very difficult to 

1026
01:04:59,911 --> 01:05:00,744
draw conclusions about the members of 
the category and the psychologists and 

1027
01:05:04,681 --> 01:05:05,514
the psychiatrists that those are 
scientific categories but what they're 

1028
01:05:09,571 --> 01:05:10,404
not and they can't be hard because 
they're aimed at the classification of 

1029
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:14,453
health or ideal versus non health are 
not ideal and partly because they play 

1030
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:22,381
multiple roles.
You category isn't there just to provide

1031
01:05:23,471 --> 01:05:24,304
neat demarcations for scientific study.
The categories there to give people a 

1032
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:30,603
language to talk about certain symptoms 
to diagnose because you know when you 

1033
01:05:34,901 --> 01:05:36,310
come in and you have a set of 
acceptance,

1034
01:05:36,311 --> 01:05:40,270
you might want to know what they are so 
that you also know what they aren't.

1035
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:41,373
It's really a relief often to find the 
diagnosis and then of course the 

1036
01:05:44,861 --> 01:05:49,570
diagnosis has certain implications for 
treatment and for billing and for all of

1037
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:50,404
that,
so the category has to play all those 

1038
01:05:51,431 --> 01:05:54,310
roles,
so there's multiple types of category

1039
01:05:56,260 --> 01:06:00,460
and the categories that we're talking 
about in relationship to the apology,

1040
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:03,040
art,
scientific categories,

1041
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:07,270
their categories and vote the world 
construed as a place to act,

1042
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:11,950
so here's the way to think about it.

1043
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:17,080
You're always looking at the world 
through a framework of reference and you

1044
01:06:17,081 --> 01:06:22,081
have to do that because there isn't very
much if you can't see the whole world at

1045
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,073
once,
and in fact the amount of the world you 

1046
01:06:24,491 --> 01:06:28,090
actually see is so small,
you can't believe in the central part of

1047
01:06:28,091 --> 01:06:28,924
your vision is zipping around,
producing a pretty high resolution 

1048
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:33,540
representation of exactly what you're 
looking at,

1049
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:37,690
but outside of that center,
like if I look at you,

1050
01:06:37,691 --> 01:06:40,720
I can't see her eyes.
I can see your glasses,

1051
01:06:40,721 --> 01:06:45,250
but barely.
I can't even tell whether you're male or

1052
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:49,120
female.
The person passed that.

1053
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:50,890
I can't see it all.
Now,

1054
01:06:50,891 --> 01:06:52,630
you don't notice that.
No,

1055
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:53,943
you don't notice that you're not blind 
because your central vision is always 

1056
01:06:57,161 --> 01:07:01,300
popping around illuminating that tiny 
space that you sit down blind.

1057
01:07:01,301 --> 01:07:02,134
It's just mind boggling,
and I'm sure some of you have seen the 

1058
01:07:04,481 --> 01:07:05,314
invisible gorilla video where a gorilla 
comes into the video and you don't 

1059
01:07:11,111 --> 01:07:11,944
notice,
which is somewhat shocking because you 

1060
01:07:13,301 --> 01:07:15,400
would think that you'd notice the 
gorilla,

1061
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:16,473
but what happens is that you actually 
don't notice something unless it 

1062
01:07:19,511 --> 01:07:23,380
interferes with what you're doing and 
because what are you going to do?

1063
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:26,300
Notice everything.
You can't do that.

1064
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:27,143
If you've heard of no one say anything.
So what you do is you pick something to 

1065
01:07:28,871 --> 01:07:32,860
focus on using something that you value 
because why else would you focus on it?

1066
01:07:32,861 --> 01:07:33,694
So that means that you're telling the 
system determines the direction of your 

1067
01:07:37,451 --> 01:07:39,610
perception.
Bloody well,

1068
01:07:39,611 --> 01:07:42,580
think about that for a minute.
That's a Buddhist idea,

1069
01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:44,000
right?
People,

1070
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:49,210
people live in a kind of illusion and 
sometimes that illusion causes suffering

1071
01:07:49,211 --> 01:07:50,044
and they can transform the way they look
at the world and that can release them 

1072
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:52,834
from their suffering.
But the idea that you do live in an 

1073
01:07:54,881 --> 01:07:56,200
illusion,
well,

1074
01:07:56,201 --> 01:07:58,210
I don't know if it's exactly illusion 
bucket.

1075
01:07:58,420 --> 01:07:59,253
You certainly do live within a framework
of perception that's determined by your 

1076
01:08:03,851 --> 01:08:04,684
values.
Now that is so weird because we never 

1077
01:08:07,451 --> 01:08:11,350
think of the world and something that 
reveals itself through our values,

1078
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:16,740
but of course if a course it does 
because you look at you want you it what

1079
01:08:18,471 --> 01:08:22,310
you want and once you pay him,
the world lays itself out for you.

1080
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:23,153
And that's exactly how perception works.
That's why this way you're always 

1081
01:08:27,081 --> 01:08:31,910
somewhere that's point day that 
somewhere in some place in some time and

1082
01:08:31,911 --> 01:08:35,840
you're always have some notion about 
what you want to have happen next.

1083
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:38,440
You know you're going to go to the next 
class.

1084
01:08:38,450 --> 01:08:41,180
Maybe you've got a plan after this.
In this class,

1085
01:08:41,181 --> 01:08:42,014
you have a plan.
You're hoping to learn something about 

1086
01:08:43,731 --> 01:08:48,650
presuming you have a goal with regards 
to a grade and that's nested inside your

1087
01:08:48,710 --> 01:08:49,543
desire to get a degree and that's nested
inside your desire to be educated and 

1088
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:54,190
have a career and,
and,

1089
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,120
and,
and have a successful life.

1090
01:08:56,510 --> 01:08:57,343
So attending to me at the moment,
the reason you're doing that is because 

1091
01:09:01,671 --> 01:09:02,504
all of those values exist within you 
simultaneously focusing your attention 

1092
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:10,490
and so you're attending to me and 
knocked to something else,

1093
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:13,390
assuming that all of you with your 
Computers Open Art,

1094
01:09:13,730 --> 01:09:15,890
surfing the web,
which you might be,

1095
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:17,023
but assuming that you're focusing,
whatever you're focusing on is directed 

1096
01:09:21,981 --> 01:09:22,840
by what you value.

1097
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:26,060
And some of that can be unconscious.
In fact,

1098
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:28,250
a lot of it is unconscious because you 
know,

1099
01:09:28,251 --> 01:09:31,150
it's very difficult for you to get 
control of what you pay attention to.

1100
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,353
You know what that's like.
You're trying to study kind of a boring 

1101
01:09:34,851 --> 01:09:36,320
paper.
Christ,

1102
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:38,960
your attention is just like everywhere,
you know,

1103
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:42,920
maybe you'll vacuum under the bed 
instead of doing the paper,

1104
01:09:42,921 --> 01:09:45,650
you know,
you can't get a grip on that thing.

1105
01:09:45,651 --> 01:09:50,020
So your attention has an autonomy and 
that's another psychoanalytic idea,

1106
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:51,350
you know,
because you kind of think,

1107
01:09:51,351 --> 01:09:52,400
well,
you're in control.

1108
01:09:52,430 --> 01:09:56,480
It's like really ever tried telling 
yourself what to do.

1109
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:58,490
Does the,
how does that work for you?

1110
01:09:58,670 --> 01:10:01,190
I'm going to go to the gym three times a
week,

1111
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:02,590
right?
Sure.

1112
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:07,550
I'm going to quit eating sugar for a 
month.

1113
01:10:08,050 --> 01:10:10,700
It's like how long does that lasts?
Fifty minutes.

1114
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:15,240
Three chocolate bars.
So you're this,

1115
01:10:15,241 --> 01:10:17,030
this,
and this is Freud central insight.

1116
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:22,030
I would say you're an autonomous group 
of spiritual agents,

1117
01:10:22,401 --> 01:10:23,234
let's say personalities and they don't 
really get along very well and you ego 

1118
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:30,033
will say is by no means necessarily in 
charge and that's a very strange thing 

1119
01:10:34,461 --> 01:10:35,294
to realize,
but you can really realize that by 

1120
01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:40,010
noticing how little control you have 
over your attentional focus.

1121
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,280
Okay,
so you've got on your pointed a,

1122
01:10:43,650 --> 01:10:46,160
you're going to point b,
you're always doing that.

1123
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:47,093
We'd have it as structure of value and 
it changes what the point a to point B 

1124
01:10:51,231 --> 01:10:52,064
is,
but the structure itself doesn't change 

1125
01:10:53,001 --> 01:10:54,620
it.
When you're looking at the world,

1126
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:58,070
what you see is not objects,
tools,

1127
01:10:58,130 --> 01:10:58,963
and they make you happy.
Those are things that facilitate your 

1128
01:11:00,741 --> 01:11:01,574
movement forward and you see obstacles 
and those are things that make you 

1129
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:06,470
unhappy.
Then when you encounter an obstacle,

1130
01:11:07,070 --> 01:11:07,903
one of the problems is as well,
you don't get to where you're going and 

1131
01:11:10,101 --> 01:11:10,934
that's a problem,
but the other problem is if you 

1132
01:11:12,441 --> 01:11:16,090
encounter an the frame might be wrong,
right?

1133
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:16,943
Because you never know.
It might be just something that you 

1134
01:11:18,091 --> 01:11:18,924
could easily might be a fatal flaw in 
your whole plant and so obstacles have 

1135
01:11:23,551 --> 01:11:26,730
this dual nature.
They get in your way,

1136
01:11:26,830 --> 01:11:30,690
but they can also take your planned down
and so they can reduce anxiety.

1137
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:31,613
So my point is this,
there's a book called visual ecological 

1138
01:11:36,181 --> 01:11:38,490
approach to visual perception was great 
book.

1139
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:42,290
Alright Gibson,
Jj Gibson,

1140
01:11:42,370 --> 01:11:45,570
Urd member correctly,
and this is,

1141
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:47,003
although I thought of this while back,
I realized eventually that it wasn't 

1142
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:51,763
very intelligent.
His theory when he believed was that 

1143
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:57,240
when people looked at the world,
you still have value first,

1144
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:00,540
project second.
So for example,

1145
01:12:00,541 --> 01:12:03,150
for Gibson,
if you're standing by a cliff,

1146
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:04,103
you don't see a play off and then think 
about the fact that you might fall and 

1147
01:12:07,441 --> 01:12:10,930
then feel free to use a falling off 
place.

1148
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:12,083
And part of the seeing of that part of 
the act of seeing is being afraid of 

1149
01:12:15,451 --> 01:12:16,284
that because your eyes are connected 
right to your emotional system and part 

1150
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:22,030
of what your eyes do is count the 
articles,

1151
01:12:22,050 --> 01:12:25,720
but your eyes do all sorts of other 
things like they comparing fractions,

1152
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:29,340
it prepare you for gripping,
be preparing for emotion.

1153
01:12:30,510 --> 01:12:31,343
None of that actually requires the 
existence necessarily the existence of 

1154
01:12:35,881 --> 01:12:40,080
your perception of the object.
So people who are blind sight and if you

1155
01:12:40,081 --> 01:12:44,280
show them so they think they can't see,
but if you flash them an angry face,

1156
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:46,350
they'll show a skin conductance 
response.

1157
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:49,710
And that's because the visual pathways 
to the Amygdala,

1158
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:53,910
which does face facial emotional 
processing and still be active.

1159
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:56,520
These are people usually have a stroke 
so your eyes are okay,

1160
01:12:56,521 --> 01:12:59,670
but they've destroyed the visual cortex.
So.

1161
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:04,250
So anyways,
it's perfectly plausible and at least at

1162
01:13:04,251 --> 01:13:06,320
one level of analysis,
when you look at something,

1163
01:13:06,321 --> 01:13:07,154
you see it's utility first.
So you see a chair and you might say 

1164
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:11,803
Cheddar is an object,
but I wouldn't say that beanbag chair 

1165
01:13:15,110 --> 01:13:19,010
and the stump is a chair and they don't 
share much in common except that you can

1166
01:13:19,011 --> 01:13:24,011
sit on it and so you know the chair is 
the chair is basically conceptualized by

1167
01:13:24,831 --> 01:13:27,500
its functional utility and when you look
at a chair,

1168
01:13:27,501 --> 01:13:28,334
what you perceive is its function 
utility and the chair tells you what to 

1169
01:13:31,311 --> 01:13:32,144
do.
It says sit on me and so and there are 

1170
01:13:34,281 --> 01:13:35,114
people who have pre frontal damage and 
they engage in something called 

1171
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:41,660
utilization behavior.
If they're walking down the hallway,

1172
01:13:41,830 --> 01:13:43,490
a door open,
they have to walk through it.

1173
01:13:43,850 --> 01:13:46,880
It can not do what the object tells them
to do.

1174
01:13:46,970 --> 01:13:51,320
That's called utilization behavior.
So that's how the world is laid out.

1175
01:13:52,190 --> 01:13:56,960
And I would say inside that don't mean 
you're in a predictable world.

1176
01:13:56,990 --> 01:13:58,850
You're in the world that you understand 
that,

1177
01:13:58,851 --> 01:13:59,684
that you know,
and then if you hit an obstacle or if 

1178
01:14:01,641 --> 01:14:03,830
you're outside that domain,
you're in the unknown.

1179
01:14:03,831 --> 01:14:05,080
You're in unknown territory.

1180
01:14:07,780 --> 01:14:12,780
In the mythological world in the world,
for you could conceptualize the world as

1181
01:14:13,481 --> 01:14:14,800
a stage for an option

1182
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:17,870
and

1183
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:21,440
this is a shakespearean quote that sort 
of sums it up quite nicely.

1184
01:14:22,370 --> 01:14:26,660
All the world's a stage and all the men 
and women merely players,

1185
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:28,693
they have their exits and their 
entrances and one man in his time plays 

1186
01:14:30,981 --> 01:14:33,530
many parts and you might say,
well,

1187
01:14:33,531 --> 01:14:34,364
is that really true?
And the answer to that is only depends 

1188
01:14:37,341 --> 01:14:38,174
on what you mean by truth and now really
is the answer because there are 

1189
01:14:41,841 --> 01:14:45,170
different ways of defining truth.
So,

1190
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,193
and it isn't self evident that there's 
only one way of defining true that's 

1191
01:14:53,741 --> 01:14:55,030
appropriate.
You know,

1192
01:14:55,031 --> 01:14:59,310
the truth might be more like a tool and 
you know,

1193
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:01,100
we are a tool using creatures and 
reading.

1194
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:01,953
What we're trying to do with our 
conceptions of truth is to work through 

1195
01:15:04,811 --> 01:15:05,644
the world successfully.
So even science is supporting it 

1196
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:09,873
shouldn't be subordinate to our use of 
the world as a tool because if it isn't 

1197
01:15:13,841 --> 01:15:16,390
useful tool,
like what are we doing with it?

1198
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:17,643
You know,
just generating technology that might 

1199
01:15:19,421 --> 01:15:22,390
destroy the world.
That seems like a bad idea,

1200
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:23,683
so,

1201
01:15:25,390 --> 01:15:26,223
so I think that the world has to o is 
actually the fundamental sort of truth 

1202
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:32,350
and I think that that's a Darwinian 
idea,

1203
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:35,830
right?
That to our notions about the world have

1204
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:36,664
evolved through a Darwinian process and 
that it's appropriate for us to regard 

1205
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:43,233
as what is most real.
Those things that reliably ensure are a 

1206
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:51,143
continuation of our life and the 
probability of our propagation and if 

1207
01:15:55,121 --> 01:15:55,954
you're a true Darwinian,
I don't think there's a way out of that 

1208
01:15:58,541 --> 01:15:59,374
argument and it isn't self evident by 
any stretch of the imagination that 

1209
01:16:04,571 --> 01:16:09,571
seeing the world as well as objects is 
the way that our brain works.

1210
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:11,163
In fact,
I don't think it's the way it works at 

1211
01:16:12,011 --> 01:16:17,011
all and I think that that's why we're so
wired for stories,

1212
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:22,410
right?
It's a mystery.

1213
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:23,693
You know,
like you won't line up for two hours to 

1214
01:16:26,071 --> 01:16:29,880
go see a lecture,
but you'll line up for two hours.

1215
01:16:29,881 --> 01:16:33,300
Maybe you'll even camp overnight if 
you're mythological imagination has been

1216
01:16:33,301 --> 01:16:34,134
seized for God only knows what reason.
By Star Wars and you know that's a 

1217
01:16:39,151 --> 01:16:39,984
source of mythologies.
It's the mythology of the modern person 

1218
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:46,740
and it fills a gap and that's why people
do it

1219
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:49,893
so that to me speaks of men,
the manner in which our psyches are 

1220
01:16:54,491 --> 01:16:55,324
constructed and that's a union idea.
That's the idea of the archetype 

1221
01:16:58,780 --> 01:16:59,613
essentially,
that to be human is to participate in a 

1222
01:17:03,041 --> 01:17:08,041
certain pattern of being and that that 
pattern of being is acting out socially.

1223
01:17:09,441 --> 01:17:13,220
It's not individually,
but it's also part of your structure.

1224
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:18,520
Even your perceptual structure as a as a
living organism of your particular type,

1225
01:17:20,490 --> 01:17:25,460
and it wouldn't be the case at least 
depart for the hero myth which is go out

1226
01:17:25,461 --> 01:17:30,461
where no one has gone before.
Face the terrors of the unknown,

1227
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:36,510
gather something of value and return is 
the central story pub.

1228
01:17:38,050 --> 01:17:40,940
It's not the only central story,
but it's.

1229
01:17:41,410 --> 01:17:42,243
It's out there in the top three.
Many of the dram and if you engage 

1230
01:17:46,991 --> 01:17:51,520
yourself in are variations of that 
story.

1231
01:17:52,030 --> 01:17:56,200
Can you watch it over and over and over 
because you're trying to learn how to do

1232
01:17:56,201 --> 01:17:58,710
that.
If that's what you need to do to live.

1233
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:05,200
Okay,

1234
01:18:05,770 --> 01:18:06,700
okay,
here's the,

1235
01:18:06,701 --> 01:18:07,534
here's your Nike.

1236
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,440
What's common among people?
Well,

1237
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:15,283
the self conscious,
we know of our own existence that we 

1238
01:18:18,691 --> 01:18:19,524
know have our own limitations and so 
that means that he has a certain innate 

1239
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:26,750
terror and fragility.
Our,

1240
01:18:26,751 --> 01:18:27,584
our,
our existence is a problem to us and in 

1241
01:18:30,361 --> 01:18:33,270
some sense what we're trying to do when 
we search for meaning is to search for a

1242
01:18:33,271 --> 01:18:35,790
solution to that problem and that can be
security,

1243
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:39,870
but it can also be molded.
So for example,

1244
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:40,973
being engaged in something worthwhile 
seems to be a good medicine for being 

1245
01:18:44,410 --> 01:18:45,560
fragile,
you know,

1246
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,010
because it's like,
well I'm doing this.

1247
01:18:47,011 --> 01:18:47,844
It seems worthwhile and the fact that 
there's a price to be paid for it and 

1248
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:53,880
things can be followed me.
The darn good I'm willing to put up with

1249
01:18:53,881 --> 01:18:56,650
that because what I'm engaged in seems 
to be appropriate.

1250
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:59,760
A sufficient significance to justify all
that.

1251
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:04,710
We all become self conscious and we're 
all trying to do something about that.

1252
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:09,800
Figure out how we deal with it.
So there's a landscape that we inhabit,

1253
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:14,650
I would say within which that takes 
place,

1254
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:19,920
the human being self conscious job,
too tragic and doomed to be aware of the

1255
01:19:22,460 --> 01:19:25,620
human being has two elements and that's 
the element that seeks to go.

1256
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:27,390
Then there's the other element that 
seeks,

1257
01:19:27,570 --> 01:19:28,403
I would say

1258
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:33,110
revenge and destruction and we have our 
reasons.

1259
01:19:33,111 --> 01:19:35,050
You don't.
If something tragic happens,

1260
01:19:35,051 --> 01:19:39,410
students tragic and unfair,
and it really brings the low probability

1261
01:19:39,411 --> 01:19:43,370
that you're going to become resentful 
and want revenge is extraordinarily high

1262
01:19:43,371 --> 01:19:47,720
and no wonder and you know the 
archetypal representation is not as evil

1263
01:19:47,721 --> 01:19:52,721
itself and the archetypal representation
of good if you could do is the hero.

1264
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:54,973
And so those things in habits,
permanent elements of the human psyche 

1265
01:20:00,530 --> 01:20:03,260
and then what else is universal to us?
Well,

1266
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:06,950
we live in a society.
You can say that's deep,

1267
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:07,853
that's deep.
It's not just human society like we've 

1268
01:20:10,371 --> 01:20:11,204
lived in a society forever so you don't.
Lobsters don't have the time and they 

1269
01:20:16,921 --> 01:20:17,754
used their serotonin system at least in 
part to keep track of their dominance 

1270
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:21,774
position.
And so you can use antidepressants on 

1271
01:20:23,491 --> 01:20:24,324
lobsters when they get defeated.
They don't feel so bad for being 

1272
01:20:26,971 --> 01:20:29,910
defeated in a fight,
and so you just think about that because

1273
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:32,010
any depressants do the same thing to us.

1274
01:20:32,790 --> 01:20:33,623
We're so bloody social that the circuits
that evolved 300 million years ago when 

1275
01:20:41,350 --> 01:20:46,350
the lobsters in us headed shared 
ancestor are still operating at the base

1276
01:20:46,591 --> 01:20:47,630
of your brain.
Now,

1277
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:48,563
my status is so important to people and 
reputation mean that serotonin system 

1278
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:56,020
governs your emotional regulation.
How people respond to you.

1279
01:20:56,030 --> 01:20:57,050
Okay,
thank you man.

1280
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:57,913
That matters.
That's why you're on facebook all the 

1281
01:20:59,611 --> 01:21:00,444
time and checking your texts and 
obsessing continually about your online 

1282
01:21:04,621 --> 01:21:06,740
presence.
As soon as soon as you're doing that,

1283
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,570
you know,
contacting people frantically and seeing

1284
01:21:09,571 --> 01:21:12,630
what the updates are.
It's like where are where?

1285
01:21:12,631 --> 01:21:15,000
How are you held in the esteem of 
others?

1286
01:21:15,210 --> 01:21:16,043
Very,
very important and that's because it 

1287
01:21:17,341 --> 01:21:20,550
determines your emotional regulation.
It's really important.

1288
01:21:20,551 --> 01:21:24,900
So we exist in a society always and this
society as to elements,

1289
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:28,830
the tyrannical element of the society 
that would be the tyrannical king.

1290
01:21:28,831 --> 01:21:30,480
Roughly speaking a very common.

1291
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:33,700
Here's the logical theme.
You see that in the lion king to right?

1292
01:21:33,701 --> 01:21:34,534
If that scar and of course you see it in
the real world almost continually and 

1293
01:21:40,441 --> 01:21:41,274
then the benevolent king who is the 
source of all the good things about 

1294
01:21:44,710 --> 01:21:46,150
culture,
you know,

1295
01:21:46,230 --> 01:21:51,170
and you can see these things play out 
August mythologies in political terms.

1296
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:56,160
So I would say for example,
continually harping about the oppressive

1297
01:21:56,161 --> 01:21:59,100
nature of the Patriarchy is part of a 
myth.

1298
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:02,660
And the myth is that society is 
oppressive.

1299
01:22:02,720 --> 01:22:03,421
It's like,
well,

1300
01:22:03,421 --> 01:22:04,254
yeah,
obviously you know because you have to 

1301
01:22:07,051 --> 01:22:07,884
be quite a bit like you and you have to 
be quite a bit like you even if you're 

1302
01:22:10,291 --> 01:22:14,940
not so that you can get along great.
Everybody sacrifices a tremendous amount

1303
01:22:14,941 --> 01:22:19,941
of their individuality to the common,
to the common motive being asked.

1304
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:25,620
There's a tyrannical element to that,
but by the same token,

1305
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:29,940
it's the basis of cooperation and the 
stability of society.

1306
01:22:30,330 --> 01:22:31,163
And then the final element is perhaps 
often represented in a masculine manner 

1307
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:36,990
by the way,
society.

1308
01:22:36,991 --> 01:22:40,420
And I think that's because our primary 
domicile structures,

1309
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:43,530
given the creatures we are like 
chimpanzees.

1310
01:22:43,710 --> 01:22:44,543
The primary structures of dominance are 
masculine and then outside of what's 

1311
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:51,060
known is the unknown.

1312
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:56,473
And we always have to contend with that 
and it's wonderful in that it's the 

1313
01:23:00,021 --> 01:23:00,854
source of all new things and it's 
terrible in the place where all the 

1314
01:23:04,221 --> 01:23:06,310
things that destabilize you've come 
from.

1315
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:11,830
And so this is a good representation,
although not the only one.

1316
01:23:12,370 --> 01:23:16,150
So that's the feminine
nature,

1317
01:23:16,210 --> 01:23:17,043
that's the masculine order and that's 
the individual who's destined to suffer 

1318
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:26,400
in the grasp of those two things.
Finish this next time.

1319
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:40,700
Yup.
All right,

1320
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:44,310
good enough.
We'll see you next time.

1321
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:50,940
Okay.

1322
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:54,390
So today to begin with,
we're going to finish

1323
01:23:56,150 --> 01:23:56,983
the last lecture and then with any luck,
we're going to start the next one 

1324
01:24:00,390 --> 01:24:02,550
fanatically late anyways.
Well you know what?

1325
01:24:03,510 --> 01:24:06,900
All the lectures for the next call for 
the whole course,

1326
01:24:06,901 --> 01:24:11,580
hopefully we'll be thematically linked 
it to some degree given the knowledge,

1327
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,860
they're about the same topic,
but some are more types of late.

1328
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:16,893
So I started telling you
last week about this idea of the voyage 

1329
01:24:23,911 --> 01:24:28,911
to the underworld and I want to tell you
a little bit more about that

1330
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:32,873
young in particular,
conceptualize the voyage to the 

1331
01:24:35,041 --> 01:24:40,041
underworld as a journey into the 
unconscious and the unconscious.

1332
01:24:41,281 --> 01:24:42,114
For the psychoanalyst is a place of 
fantasy and dream and implicit 

1333
01:24:47,071 --> 01:24:50,560
presupposition and habit.
That's all crap.

1334
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:52,103
There is an unconscious and
it's perfectly reasonable to 

1335
01:24:56,131 --> 01:24:58,140
conceptualize it that way.
That's the big difference,

1336
01:24:58,141 --> 01:25:01,350
I think,
between the psychoanalysts and the later

1337
01:25:01,351 --> 01:25:02,184
more empirical scientists is that the 
psychoanalysts sort of envisioned your 

1338
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:09,623
psyche's as a place of living partial 
personalities instead of cognitive 

1339
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:23,460
computational systems that they took 
into account.

1340
01:25:23,460 --> 01:25:24,293
The fact that you're alive and the parts
of you are alive and you know there's a 

1341
01:25:29,611 --> 01:25:31,470
neuroscientist named Gavin.
They

1342
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:36,780
don't know how to say his name guys in 
India.

1343
01:25:37,230 --> 01:25:38,730
That's wrong.
Does that,

1344
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:39,720
is that and go?
Yeah,

1345
01:25:39,721 --> 01:25:41,380
I think that's it.
Anyways,

1346
01:25:41,790 --> 01:25:42,623
he did some of the earliest experiments 
on split brains and so sometimes if you 

1347
01:25:46,171 --> 01:25:49,110
have intractable epilepsy,
which I wouldn't recommend by the way,

1348
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:54,460
I'm one of the surgical procedures for 
mediating gets negative effects.

1349
01:25:56,041 --> 01:25:56,874
There's something called a cut the 
corpus callosum and it's very large 

1350
01:26:00,561 --> 01:26:03,120
number,
a very large structure in the brain that

1351
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:06,820
connects the two separate hemispheres.
And No,

1352
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:08,960
it's not obvious why we have two 
separate hemispheres,

1353
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:11,750
although I'll probably do a little bit 
about why I think it is,

1354
01:26:12,020 --> 01:26:13,490
but anyways,
they do communicate.

1355
01:26:14,450 --> 01:26:16,680
And uh,
what is that Nigga

1356
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:19,303
demonstrated was that you could tell one
hemisphere something without the other 

1357
01:26:24,171 --> 01:26:29,171
one knowing that both hemispheres we're 
conscious and that the consciousness was

1358
01:26:29,661 --> 01:26:30,860
somewhat independent.

1359
01:26:31,850 --> 01:26:33,770
Really strange.
It's very interesting.

1360
01:26:33,771 --> 01:26:35,770
It makes very interesting reading,
reading,

1361
01:26:36,450 --> 01:26:37,283
you know,
because it suggests that fragments of 

1362
01:26:39,981 --> 01:26:41,060
ourselves,
you can think of,

1363
01:26:41,540 --> 01:26:42,373
you have fragments of yourself within 
you that are like low resolution 

1364
01:26:44,751 --> 01:26:46,480
representations of,
you know,

1365
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:47,593
and the,
and the psychoanalysts would think of 

1366
01:26:48,651 --> 01:26:51,730
those more as they're kind of like,
they're kind of like one giant.

1367
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:52,903
That might be a way of thinking about if
you were thinking about it in a 

1368
01:26:54,531 --> 01:26:58,700
fantastical way.
So there's the angry you and you know,

1369
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:02,720
you all come into contact with the angry
you.

1370
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:03,973
It's a rather rigid.
That's the first thing you might say 

1371
01:27:05,961 --> 01:27:08,480
about it.
It's impulsive than short term.

1372
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:09,613
It doesn't take much about the past 
unless it's bad things about whoever 

1373
01:27:13,431 --> 01:27:16,500
you're angry at,
in which case it makes them a lot.

1374
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:17,893
It's not too concerned with longterm 
future consequences and mostly at wants 

1375
01:27:21,711 --> 01:27:22,544
to be right
and you know when angry you disappears 

1376
01:27:27,261 --> 01:27:31,460
and normal view,
assuming such a thing exists,

1377
01:27:31,610 --> 01:27:32,510
reappears.

1378
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:33,853
You can be perfectly shocked about how 
angry you behave and in fact sometimes 

1379
01:27:40,190 --> 01:27:45,190
if angry you really gets out of hand 
like it might in a battle and the war.

1380
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:49,310
It might do things that you just can't 
imagine that you would do.

1381
01:27:49,950 --> 01:27:50,783
And under those circumstances you can 
reveal parts of yourself to yourself 

1382
01:27:55,910 --> 01:27:56,743
that are so foreign and so horrifying 
that it will leave you with 

1383
01:28:03,231 --> 01:28:07,130
posttraumatic stress disorder because it
is the case that

1384
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:09,553
many but not all.
People who suffer from post traumatic 

1385
01:28:12,890 --> 01:28:16,190
stress disorder especially it's 
battlefield related,

1386
01:28:16,990 --> 01:28:17,823
get it because of something they did 
rather than something they saw or 

1387
01:28:21,291 --> 01:28:25,010
something that happened to them.
And that's really we're thinking about.

1388
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:25,943
You know,
I mean there's a lot of weird potential 

1389
01:28:27,711 --> 01:28:28,544
nested inside people and you know,
you don't see it under normal 

1390
01:28:31,011 --> 01:28:31,844
circumstances because the circumstances 
are normal and part of the reason that 

1391
01:28:35,961 --> 01:28:36,794
we like the circumstances to be normal 
is precisely so that we don't see those 

1392
01:28:42,831 --> 01:28:45,200
parts of people we don't want to see.

1393
01:28:46,030 --> 01:28:47,780
And that's really,
you were knowing.

1394
01:28:47,781 --> 01:28:52,781
It's really worth knowing because
that's why people are so identified with

1395
01:28:54,471 --> 01:28:56,030
your culture,
why they need a coach.

1396
01:28:56,140 --> 01:28:58,490
You know,
the terror management theorists types.

1397
01:28:58,850 --> 01:29:02,700
It kind of think of culture as a 
mechanism that inhibits anxiety.

1398
01:29:02,780 --> 01:29:03,613
Think about it psychologically,
like it's something inside your your 

1399
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:06,924
hand,
let's say,

1400
01:29:07,290 --> 01:29:08,123
um,
and it gives meaning to advanced and 

1401
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:14,990
stops you from collapsing into chaos and
protects you from death anxiety.

1402
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:18,930
But
that isn't done right.

1403
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:22,380
It's sort of right.
But that isn't what your culture is.

1404
01:29:22,410 --> 01:29:27,410
Your culture is a set of value Laden 
presuppositions that you orient yourself

1405
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:34,250
in the world that match the set of Value
Laden presuppositions.

1406
01:29:34,561 --> 01:29:37,770
But everyone in your culture has and 
acts out.

1407
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:38,903
And so what that means is that when you 
believe something and you're among your 

1408
01:29:42,331 --> 01:29:45,940
own people,
you believe something implicitly,

1409
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:48,210
the way you look at the world and the 
way you act things out,

1410
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:50,870
you act about everyone expects you to 
act the bowel,

1411
01:29:51,150 --> 01:29:52,560
they're happy about it,
in fact.

1412
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:55,350
So there's a match between what you're 
doing,

1413
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:58,290
what you see and what you're doing and 
what other people expect.

1414
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:01,230
And it's that matched,
that regulates your emotions.

1415
01:30:02,210 --> 01:30:04,770
It's not the belief system,
it's the match.

1416
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:06,443
And so part of the reason that people 
are so tied to their cultural identity 

1417
01:30:10,830 --> 01:30:11,663
is because their cultural identity 
regulates their emotions and in a 

1418
01:30:17,461 --> 01:30:20,250
profound way like this is no joke.
You know what I mean?

1419
01:30:20,490 --> 01:30:21,323
One of the things that stabilizes human 
nervous systems is that you have a 

1420
01:30:27,091 --> 01:30:29,790
domain of competence.
There's many domains of competence.

1421
01:30:29,791 --> 01:30:32,670
And of course in some of those domains 
you're completely incompetent,

1422
01:30:32,910 --> 01:30:35,730
but they met me not matter because you 
don't go into that domain.

1423
01:30:35,731 --> 01:30:36,564
So you have some area of specialization 
which you might think of as your sub 

1424
01:30:39,691 --> 01:30:42,180
tribe.
You know your university students.

1425
01:30:42,181 --> 01:30:43,014
And so some of you are lower status by 
the rules of the university game and 

1426
01:30:47,461 --> 01:30:48,294
some of you are higher status by the 
rules of the university gate by the 

1427
01:30:50,851 --> 01:30:51,300
tribe.

1428
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:52,133
And so the higher status people tend to 
be the ones who fit into the academic 

1429
01:30:56,491 --> 01:30:57,211
environment,
you know,

1430
01:30:57,211 --> 01:30:58,044
and,
and find it conducive to their mode of 

1431
01:31:00,721 --> 01:31:05,310
being and all who also do well and their
serotonin levels rise.

1432
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:06,893
And you know,
the neurochemicals that moderate mood 

1433
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:14,270
particularly are serotonergic.
It's Serotonin,

1434
01:31:14,660 --> 01:31:16,370
it's lots of other things.
It's an oversimplification,

1435
01:31:16,710 --> 01:31:20,350
but that'll do for now.
As you become dominant in a hierarchy,

1436
01:31:20,351 --> 01:31:24,840
your serotonin levels rise.
And what that means is that happy things

1437
01:31:24,841 --> 01:31:27,990
make you happier and sad things make you
less sad.

1438
01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:29,143
Tunes your nervous system.
So if you're down at the bottom of the 

1439
01:31:31,141 --> 01:31:32,690
hierarchy,
you have your failing.

1440
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:33,573
It's like,
Hey,

1441
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:37,500
hardly anything makes you happy and 
everything makes you nervous.

1442
01:31:37,501 --> 01:31:40,770
And it's no wonder because it's not very
good down there.

1443
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:43,960
So
the,

1444
01:31:44,450 --> 01:31:48,600
the societal structure which which is an
elaborated dominance hierarchy,

1445
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:50,753
regulates your emotions because of the 
match between your expectations and the 

1446
01:31:54,301 --> 01:31:56,370
behaviors of the people within that 
structure,

1447
01:31:56,730 --> 01:32:01,090
and then your position within the 
hierarchy regulates the rate ratio.

1448
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:04,030
Let's say empty intensity between 
positive and negative emotion,

1449
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:09,270
so you mess with people's status at your
peril and you disrupt their culture.

1450
01:32:10,810 --> 01:32:15,810
They don't like that and no wonder 
because when it's disrupted,

1451
01:32:16,091 --> 01:32:18,940
they fall into chaos and chaos is just 
anxiety.

1452
01:32:19,820 --> 01:32:20,653
Anxiety is bad now,
but it's not just anxiety because when 

1453
01:32:23,831 --> 01:32:26,290
you fall into chaos but things fall 
apart for you.

1454
01:32:28,540 --> 01:32:29,373
Of course you're uncertain and anxious 
because you don't know what the hell is 

1455
01:32:32,381 --> 01:32:35,290
going on and you don't know where you 
are and you don't know what to do.

1456
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:36,213
Pants,
anxiety provoking and maybe you can't 

1457
01:32:37,591 --> 01:32:39,850
even understand your past property and 
more of that.

1458
01:32:39,910 --> 01:32:40,743
As I said,
that happens with people could be 

1459
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:46,500
trained and so you fall into this state 
where nothing is certain.

1460
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:51,370
The way you construe the world isn't 
certain and even the way the world is no

1461
01:32:51,371 --> 01:32:52,204
longer certain because you don't know 
how to act or your actions aren't 

1462
01:32:56,231 --> 01:32:58,810
working,
and so the world is presenting itself as

1463
01:32:58,811 --> 01:33:01,630
something that's chaotic.
It's not just psychological.

1464
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:03,033
The chaos is a weird intermingling of 
the chaotic world and the chaotic south 

1465
01:33:07,830 --> 01:33:09,610
and that's what happens when you get 
unemployed,

1466
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:12,240
like devastated,
right?

1467
01:33:12,710 --> 01:33:15,310
It's devastating to people and if you 
could say,

1468
01:33:15,311 --> 01:33:16,390
well,
that's psychological.

1469
01:33:16,391 --> 01:33:16,961
It's like,
well,

1470
01:33:16,961 --> 01:33:18,880
yeah,
but they're unemployed.

1471
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:23,890
That makes the world far more 
incomprehensible and uncertain.

1472
01:33:24,070 --> 01:33:27,820
It's not just psychological,
it's psychological and that's bad,

1473
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,250
but it's also real and that's even 
worse,

1474
01:33:30,251 --> 01:33:31,084
and then those two things can spiral,
which they often do because you know if 

1475
01:33:35,911 --> 01:33:40,570
you don't set your expectations properly
for a drug search and assume that you're

1476
01:33:40,571 --> 01:33:44,230
going to get 49 rejections for every 
interview,

1477
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:47,980
which you really need to know because if
you get 49 rejections,

1478
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:52,900
it's not because you're useless because 
the baseline for rejection is 98 percent

1479
01:33:53,140 --> 01:33:53,973
and that's okay because the base rate 
for rejection for everything is 98 

1480
01:33:57,791 --> 01:33:59,500
percent.
No matter what you do,

1481
01:33:59,830 --> 01:34:00,663
but you need to know that so that you 
don't feel that it's like something 

1482
01:34:02,801 --> 01:34:03,634
wrong with you.
And of course you only have to get it 

1483
01:34:05,621 --> 01:34:09,400
right once that India had the job,
that it's a lottery,

1484
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:10,960
but you have to set yourself up.

1485
01:34:10,990 --> 01:34:11,801
You have to take,
okay,

1486
01:34:11,801 --> 01:34:13,000
well,
I'm going to look for a job.

1487
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:16,030
I need to.
How many resumes can I tolerate?

1488
01:34:16,031 --> 01:34:18,080
Sending out a day?
You know,

1489
01:34:18,100 --> 01:34:21,940
it has to be enough so you don't feel 
like other useless moron and it can't be

1490
01:34:21,941 --> 01:34:25,480
so many that you're overwhelmed by the 
burden.

1491
01:34:25,481 --> 01:34:28,630
So and I help people do this sort of 
thing all the time.

1492
01:34:28,631 --> 01:34:29,830
So maybe you decide,
well,

1493
01:34:30,310 --> 01:34:34,200
you're going to send out 10 a day and 
you're going to work two hours on it and

1494
01:34:34,210 --> 01:34:35,043
it's going to take six months,
and then you know you've got your 

1495
01:34:37,571 --> 01:34:41,140
parameters set properly and you would 
know what to expect in the world.

1496
01:34:41,810 --> 01:34:46,810
And your emotions are regulated and so,
but the state of being unemployed,

1497
01:34:48,150 --> 01:34:51,070
it doesn't just produce psychological 
consequences.

1498
01:34:51,940 --> 01:34:52,773
So the distinction between the psyche 
and the world in some sense is quite 

1499
01:34:56,501 --> 01:34:59,660
arbitrary.
And the psychoanalyst,

1500
01:34:59,661 --> 01:35:03,290
I think,
err too much on the side of the subject.

1501
01:35:03,450 --> 01:35:04,283
They came to think that too much of you 
is inside of you and too little of us 

1502
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:08,393
outside.
When part of the reason I believe that 

1503
01:35:11,781 --> 01:35:15,130
it's because of my clinical experience.
I love the psychoanalyst map.

1504
01:35:16,550 --> 01:35:18,920
They're brilliant,
they're brilliant or deep.

1505
01:35:20,690 --> 01:35:21,523
They grappled with real problems like 
with the problems when people have real 

1506
01:35:25,161 --> 01:35:25,994
problems and I need profound problems.
There really profound moral problems or 

1507
01:35:29,511 --> 01:35:30,344
problems of good and evil really know 
there are things going on in their 

1508
01:35:32,961 --> 01:35:37,570
family that are so terrible that well 
the terrible.

1509
01:35:37,670 --> 01:35:41,180
There are some times fabled lie upon lie
upon,

1510
01:35:41,181 --> 01:35:45,140
lie upon lie for decades and decades and
decades.

1511
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:46,393
Awful.

1512
01:35:53,350 --> 01:35:55,180
And that's not exactly inside them.

1513
01:35:58,020 --> 01:36:00,630
It's out there in the world and lots of 
the people that I see,

1514
01:36:01,530 --> 01:36:06,530
very famous critic of psychology,
I can't remember his name,

1515
01:36:07,171 --> 01:36:08,004
but I probably will
criticize practice of psychology quite 

1516
01:36:13,290 --> 01:36:15,810
effectively in the believe in the early 
sixties.

1517
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:19,850
The Myth of mental illness by Thomas sat
as zed,

1518
01:36:19,950 --> 01:36:22,140
a s zed.
It's classic.

1519
01:36:22,770 --> 01:36:26,150
You should read it if you're interested 
in psychology reading like it's.

1520
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:31,170
It's a classic and he basically said 
most people have problems in living.

1521
01:36:31,171 --> 01:36:35,550
They don't have psychological problems,
and so I've experienced,

1522
01:36:35,670 --> 01:36:36,503
despite my love for the psychoanalysts,
very frequently what I'm doing as a 

1523
01:36:40,531 --> 01:36:44,730
therapist is helping people have a life 
that would work.

1524
01:36:45,690 --> 01:36:48,810
You know,
and you can parameterize that.

1525
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:50,190
It's like,
what do you need?

1526
01:36:51,330 --> 01:36:54,300
How about some friends that will kind of
like that?

1527
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:55,193
How about an intimate relationship with 
someone that you can trust that maybe 

1528
01:36:57,541 --> 01:36:58,380
has a future?

1529
01:36:58,650 --> 01:36:59,483
That'd be good.
How about a career that puts you in a 

1530
01:37:01,321 --> 01:37:02,154
dominance hierarchy somewhere so at 
least you've got some possibility of 

1531
01:37:05,671 --> 01:37:08,340
rising,
some possibility of stabilizing yourself

1532
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:13,350
and their schedule and a routine because
no one can live without a routine.

1533
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:16,320
You just forget that if you guys don't 
have a routine,

1534
01:37:17,010 --> 01:37:17,843
I would recommend you get one going 
because you cannot be mentally healthy 

1535
01:37:21,811 --> 01:37:22,644
without a routine.
You need to pick a time to get up 

1536
01:37:25,170 --> 01:37:26,003
whatever time you want,
but pick one and stick to it because 

1537
01:37:28,381 --> 01:37:33,330
otherwise you've disregulate your 
circadian rhythms and they regulate your

1538
01:37:33,331 --> 01:37:36,210
mood and eat something.
In the morning.

1539
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:38,033
I had lots of clients that anxiety 
disorders are one client who was 

1540
01:37:40,951 --> 01:37:43,980
literally starving.
Very smart girl,

1541
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:45,990
cheat.
There's very little that she liked.

1542
01:37:45,991 --> 01:37:48,930
She kind of tried to subsist on like 
half a cup of rice a day.

1543
01:37:49,110 --> 01:37:51,540
She came to me and said,
I have no energy.

1544
01:37:51,540 --> 01:37:54,780
I come home and all I want to do is 
watch the same movie over and over.

1545
01:37:54,781 --> 01:37:57,840
What is that weird?
And I thought,

1546
01:37:57,900 --> 01:37:59,280
well,
it depends about rj work,

1547
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:01,140
you know,
it's weird,

1548
01:38:01,141 --> 01:38:04,620
but whatever familiar is looking for 
comfort.

1549
01:38:04,830 --> 01:38:05,663
So I did an analysis of her diet.
It's like three quarters of a cup of 

1550
01:38:09,871 --> 01:38:11,850
rice.
It's like you're starving,

1551
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:14,310
eat something,
you know,

1552
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:21,150
you'll feel better.
So she modified her diet and they're all

1553
01:38:21,151 --> 01:38:23,510
or anxiety went away and she had some 
energy.

1554
01:38:23,511 --> 01:38:24,840
It's like,
yeah,

1555
01:38:27,970 --> 01:38:31,750
so schedule.
That's a good thing man.

1556
01:38:31,751 --> 01:38:32,584
And your brain will thank you for it.
It will stabilize your nervous system 

1557
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:37,710
with a bit of a plan.
That's a good thing.

1558
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:41,040
You need a career.
You need something productive to do with

1559
01:38:41,041 --> 01:38:41,874
your time.
You need to regulate your use of drugs 

1560
01:38:44,761 --> 01:38:45,594
and alcohol.
Most particularly the alcohol because 

1561
01:38:47,731 --> 01:38:52,731
that does eat a lot of people
in your family,

1562
01:38:53,581 --> 01:38:56,340
like the family,
you have your parents and all that.

1563
01:38:56,340 --> 01:38:58,800
It'd be nice if you all got along.
You could work on that.

1564
01:38:58,801 --> 01:39:00,800
That's a good thing to work on.
Then you know what?

1565
01:39:00,801 --> 01:39:03,060
You probably need children at some point
and that's life.

1566
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:07,950
That's what life is and if you're 
missing,

1567
01:39:08,220 --> 01:39:09,053
you know you may have a good reason to 
not be operating on one of those 

1568
01:39:12,181 --> 01:39:15,090
dimensions.
It's not mandatory,

1569
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:20,070
but I can tell you that if you're not 
operating reasonably well on four,

1570
01:39:20,071 --> 01:39:20,904
I think I mentioned six,
if you're not operating reasonably well 

1571
01:39:22,771 --> 01:39:23,604
on at least three of them,
there's no way you're going to be 

1572
01:39:27,870 --> 01:39:28,703
psychologically thriving and that's more
pragmatic in some sense than 

1573
01:39:33,361 --> 01:39:36,270
psychological.
Like human beings have a nature.

1574
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:37,583
There's things we need and if we have 
them well that's good and if we don't 

1575
01:39:41,131 --> 01:39:44,820
have them well then we feel the lack.
So behaviorists,

1576
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:48,600
behavioral psychologists concentrated a 
lot more on that sort of thing.

1577
01:39:49,370 --> 01:39:52,300
No.
What's practical strategizing?

1578
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:53,933
Make a career plan,
figuring out how to negotiate because 

1579
01:39:55,321 --> 01:39:57,720
that's bloody important.
Figuring out how to say what you need,

1580
01:39:58,440 --> 01:39:59,273
figure out how to tell the truth,
figuring out how to listen to your 

1581
01:40:04,291 --> 01:40:07,920
partner in particular because if you 
listen to them,

1582
01:40:07,930 --> 01:40:08,763
they will actually tell you what they 
want and sometimes you can give it to 

1583
01:40:12,001 --> 01:40:12,834
them and maybe they'll return the favor 
and if you practice that for like 15 

1584
01:40:15,931 --> 01:40:16,764
years,
well then maybe you don't constantly 

1585
01:40:18,721 --> 01:40:21,150
giving each other what you want.
Well Hooray.

1586
01:40:21,570 --> 01:40:23,970
That would be good.
And then there's two of you.

1587
01:40:24,750 --> 01:40:25,583
Under most circumstances,
it's better to have two brains than one 

1588
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:32,940
because people think differently because
of their temperament mostly.

1589
01:40:33,470 --> 01:40:34,303
And so the negotiation is where the 
wisdom arises and it's part of the 

1590
01:40:39,151 --> 01:40:39,984
transformation,
the psychological transformation that's 

1591
01:40:42,001 --> 01:40:46,380
attendant on an intimate relationship 
and one of the fundamental purposes of a

1592
01:40:46,381 --> 01:40:50,430
long term intimate relationship.
Anyways.

1593
01:40:50,431 --> 01:40:51,264
When that falls apart,
chaos ensues and that's why is 

1594
01:40:53,531 --> 01:40:58,450
represented so continually and myths and
stories,

1595
01:40:58,930 --> 01:41:01,510
and I'm going to walk you through a bit 
of that more today.

1596
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:06,130
I talked about the story of Jonah.
Now,

1597
01:41:06,190 --> 01:41:07,360
here's something to think about.

1598
01:41:10,450 --> 01:41:11,283
The internal representations of language
meaning evolve partly from our pre 

1599
01:41:16,061 --> 01:41:20,290
linguistic ancestor's knowledge of 
social relations like modern monkeys and

1600
01:41:20,291 --> 01:41:21,124
apes.
Our ancestors lived in groups with 

1601
01:41:22,780 --> 01:41:23,613
intricate networks of relationships that
were simultaneously competitive and 

1602
01:41:27,341 --> 01:41:28,174
cooperative.
The demands of social life created 

1603
01:41:29,801 --> 01:41:32,650
selective pressures for just the kind of
complex,

1604
01:41:32,651 --> 01:41:33,484
abstract,
conceptual and computational abilities 

1605
01:41:35,410 --> 01:41:36,243
that are likely to have proceeded.
The earliest forms of linguistic 

1606
01:41:38,921 --> 01:41:39,754
communication.
Although baboons have concepts and 

1607
01:41:42,161 --> 01:41:45,370
acquire propositional information from 
other animals,

1608
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:48,250
vocalizations,
they can articulate this information.

1609
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,200
They understand dominance,
relationships,

1610
01:41:50,201 --> 01:41:52,770
and matrilineal kinship,
but they have the words for them.

1611
01:41:53,290 --> 01:41:54,123
This suggests that the internal 
representation of many concept 

1612
01:41:56,920 --> 01:41:57,753
relations,
an actual action sequences does not 

1613
01:42:00,521 --> 01:42:01,354
require language and the language did 
not evolve because it was uniquely 

1614
01:42:03,940 --> 01:42:05,890
suited to represent the thought.
Well.

1615
01:42:05,891 --> 01:42:09,520
You know,
you can think without laying well,

1616
01:42:09,620 --> 01:42:12,040
take the case of someone who's deaf and 
mute.

1617
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:15,580
They have no language.
Well,

1618
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:19,270
they can operate in society,
they learn how to represent other people

1619
01:42:19,540 --> 01:42:21,760
and they do that with image.
Now,

1620
01:42:21,761 --> 01:42:22,594
the postmodernists who I
despised would be a reasonable way of 

1621
01:42:28,630 --> 01:42:29,463
putting it,
have this proposition that there's no 

1622
01:42:31,931 --> 01:42:35,170
meaning outside language and it's a 
powerful argument by the way,

1623
01:42:35,171 --> 01:42:37,000
but it's seriously wrong.

1624
01:42:39,820 --> 01:42:40,653
There is a meaning network outside of 
language and it's what language is 

1625
01:42:43,151 --> 01:42:48,151
grounded in and that's this pre verbal 
comprehension of the world.

1626
01:42:49,091 --> 01:42:54,091
It's an embodied comprehension.
The world animals have lobsters have it,

1627
01:42:55,130 --> 01:42:58,090
you know,
this particular scientists say far

1628
01:42:59,770 --> 01:43:03,580
talks about our shared history with 
higher primates.

1629
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:06,700
That probably goes back 20 million 
years,

1630
01:43:06,701 --> 01:43:07,534
something like that slip from the common
ancestor with chimps about 7 million 

1631
01:43:11,321 --> 01:43:12,950
years ago.
Um,

1632
01:43:13,780 --> 01:43:17,680
but you know,
lobsters have dominance hierarchies.

1633
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:20,110
They are,
they have a nervous system at all,

1634
01:43:20,111 --> 01:43:22,180
which is partly what you're studying 
quite extensively.

1635
01:43:22,840 --> 01:43:26,380
And so they have a social structure and 
they understand it.

1636
01:43:26,650 --> 01:43:27,483
Like at one lobster,
you're a lobster to be quite a shock to 

1637
01:43:30,581 --> 01:43:31,414
you.
If it happened and you were fighting 

1638
01:43:33,731 --> 01:43:36,730
with another lobster and you lost,
you would remember that.

1639
01:43:36,731 --> 01:43:41,140
And the next time you saw that lobster,
you'd scuttle off somewhere else and you

1640
01:43:41,170 --> 01:43:42,003
know that.

1641
01:43:42,010 --> 01:43:43,720
And all the lobsters and an area.
No,

1642
01:43:43,721 --> 01:43:44,554
who's taught lobster and who isn't.
And Pop lobster gets the best bloody 

1643
01:43:49,271 --> 01:43:51,530
place to be.
And the best food.

1644
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:56,750
So this dominance issue,
this cultural issue,

1645
01:43:57,500 --> 01:43:58,333
the fact that we live in a social 
environment is far deeper than people 

1646
01:44:02,361 --> 01:44:04,550
usually consider it.
It's also worth considering.

1647
01:44:04,790 --> 01:44:07,850
This is what you might think of from an 
evolutionary perspective.

1648
01:44:07,851 --> 01:44:08,684
You know,
you think of natural selection as 

1649
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:12,320
producing evolution,
right?

1650
01:44:12,530 --> 01:44:15,110
Well,
random mutation with natural selection.

1651
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:18,650
But here's something to think about.
And Darwin knew this,

1652
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:20,393
but Darwin was really smart and the 
biologists who followed in his 

1653
01:44:22,971 --> 01:44:24,560
footsteps,
even up to now,

1654
01:44:24,710 --> 01:44:28,960
I've only expanded out a fraction of 
what he had the same.

1655
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:30,513
You know,
he was very interested in sexual 

1656
01:44:31,341 --> 01:44:35,360
selection.
Now one of the things about human beings

1657
01:44:35,361 --> 01:44:39,590
that's unique is that human females are 
picky majors.

1658
01:44:39,980 --> 01:44:41,830
You're choosing a.

1659
01:44:42,220 --> 01:44:43,053
they're also sneaky because you cannot 
tell when they're articulating and with 

1660
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:47,480
many other female animals,
you know,

1661
01:44:48,170 --> 01:44:49,003
so
they have hidden ovulation and their 

1662
01:44:52,431 --> 01:44:53,264
choosing and they tend to choose men who
are more successful in the dominance 

1663
01:44:57,141 --> 01:44:58,280
arch.
Well,

1664
01:44:58,790 --> 01:45:02,090
there there is a shock.
I mean you have a choice.

1665
01:45:02,570 --> 01:45:03,403
Why don't
you pick someone who's at the bottom of 

1666
01:45:06,411 --> 01:45:07,244
the competence hierarchy,
all that's probably not going to work 

1667
01:45:09,441 --> 01:45:13,790
out very well for you and since women 
bear the burden of reproduction,

1668
01:45:15,590 --> 01:45:16,423
it's perfectly reasonable for them to 
search out someone who's going to be 

1669
01:45:18,801 --> 01:45:20,420
helpful,
so productive,

1670
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:22,670
fair,
generous,

1671
01:45:23,210 --> 01:45:25,150
and you know when you think of a 
dominance hierarchy,

1672
01:45:25,151 --> 01:45:27,080
you might think,
well it's the powerful guy.

1673
01:45:27,230 --> 01:45:30,670
The aggressive guy say that rises to the
top of the dominance hierarchy.

1674
01:45:30,700 --> 01:45:32,870
That's not true.
It's not even true among chimps.

1675
01:45:33,590 --> 01:45:34,423
Like you can get a chimp tyrant,
but then what happens is other chimps 

1676
01:45:37,431 --> 01:45:40,700
ganging up on him and tear him to pieces
and they don't do it nicely.

1677
01:45:41,090 --> 01:45:41,923
They don't do it nicely.
And the chimps that tend to maintain 

1678
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:48,710
their dominance for long periods of time
have a pretty wide network of friends.

1679
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:53,510
Roughly speaking with whom they engage 
in reciprocal interactions like grooming

1680
01:45:53,660 --> 01:45:54,493
and they actually pay a lot of positive 
attention to the female chimps who have 

1681
01:45:56,901 --> 01:45:59,630
their own hierarchy by the way and to 
their offspring.

1682
01:46:00,110 --> 01:46:02,090
So they're like baby kissing 
politicians.

1683
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:06,550
And so the idea that it's raw power that
produces dominance is a,

1684
01:46:07,070 --> 01:46:09,950
it's just wrong.
It's wrong.

1685
01:46:09,951 --> 01:46:10,730
Now,
you know,

1686
01:46:10,730 --> 01:46:14,800
tyrants pretty damn of unstable business
being a tyrant.

1687
01:46:14,930 --> 01:46:16,430
There's lots of people who want to kill 
you.

1688
01:46:16,790 --> 01:46:17,390
Plus,
you know,

1689
01:46:17,390 --> 01:46:20,540
you tend to rule over something 
approximating Pale.

1690
01:46:20,810 --> 01:46:24,530
So maybe that's why we're better than 
being a subject in hell,

1691
01:46:24,531 --> 01:46:28,460
but it's not much better.
So anyway,

1692
01:46:28,461 --> 01:46:31,760
so this social social now,
so what this means,

1693
01:46:31,761 --> 01:46:32,750
think about this for a minute.

1694
01:46:33,740 --> 01:46:36,860
So imagine,
imagine what I tell you.

1695
01:46:36,861 --> 01:46:37,694
Bear some resemblance to the truth.
I think there's quite a lot of evidence 

1696
01:46:40,491 --> 01:46:42,860
for it from a,
from a biological perspective.

1697
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:45,553
I mean,
this choosy mating thing occurs with 

1698
01:46:47,481 --> 01:46:48,590
lots of species.
You know,

1699
01:46:48,830 --> 01:46:52,080
here's this bird called the bower bird.
You've got to look up bower birds,

1700
01:46:52,081 --> 01:46:53,110
man.
Those things are,

1701
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:57,570
you just can't even believe they exist.
And so when the Mayo Bower Bird,

1702
01:46:58,260 --> 01:47:00,930
he makes this really complicated nest 
that's close to the ground.

1703
01:47:01,110 --> 01:47:03,330
He weaves it.
It's really quite nice.

1704
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:05,580
You couldn't make one.
So.

1705
01:47:05,700 --> 01:47:06,533
And then he sweeps this the yard in 
front of the nest and then he runs 

1706
01:47:11,671 --> 01:47:16,620
around the forest or flies because he 
has a bird finding pretty things.

1707
01:47:17,130 --> 01:47:19,470
So maybe he'll find a nice collection of
red leaves.

1708
01:47:19,471 --> 01:47:20,304
And so they'd helped take the red leaves
one by one and fly back to his front 

1709
01:47:23,270 --> 01:47:24,660
door and make a little square.

1710
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:26,700
You know,
he's a bird so it's not a great square,

1711
01:47:26,701 --> 01:47:30,510
but it makes a little patch of red and 
he takes a look at that and then he goes

1712
01:47:30,511 --> 01:47:33,630
off and find something blue and had he 
decorates it,

1713
01:47:33,631 --> 01:47:36,990
makes a little piece of abstract art in 
the front of his nest.

1714
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:40,290
And a lot of male bowerbirds do this all
at the same time.

1715
01:47:40,770 --> 01:47:41,603
And so then the females come along,
they hop on something nearby and they 

1716
01:47:44,570 --> 01:47:46,820
kind of look at it like this,
check it out.

1717
01:47:47,190 --> 01:47:50,310
And if they're happy with it,
well then things proceed.

1718
01:47:50,311 --> 01:47:51,144
But if they're not,
they'd fly off to someone else's piece 

1719
01:47:52,801 --> 01:47:53,634
of abstract art and if a mail piece of 
already rejected by like three females 

1720
01:47:58,801 --> 01:48:02,070
in a row,
he gets irritated and brushes it all off

1721
01:48:02,071 --> 01:48:04,320
with his weight and then he makes 
another one.

1722
01:48:04,830 --> 01:48:07,020
It's like,
well,

1723
01:48:07,021 --> 01:48:10,230
they obviously have a sense of a very 
well developed sense of beauty.

1724
01:48:10,740 --> 01:48:12,000
It's so cool.
You know,

1725
01:48:12,330 --> 01:48:16,920
and I guess the idea is that who knows 
what the hell the ID is,

1726
01:48:17,190 --> 01:48:20,070
the female birds,
like artistic mail,

1727
01:48:20,071 --> 01:48:20,904
something like that.
But if you're thinking about it 

1728
01:48:22,201 --> 01:48:23,034
biologically,
maybe it's an indication of 

1729
01:48:24,331 --> 01:48:25,800
intelligence,
right?

1730
01:48:25,801 --> 01:48:26,634
It's a marker of intelligence.
It's certainly the case that female 

1731
01:48:30,271 --> 01:48:35,271
humans prefer creative men.
So wonder horse.

1732
01:48:37,250 --> 01:48:39,120
We wouldn't be creative if that wasn't 
the case.

1733
01:48:39,121 --> 01:48:39,954
So that imagine that there's two primary
forces of evolutionary selection 

1734
01:48:43,590 --> 01:48:46,560
operating on us and they're not really 
the natural world,

1735
01:48:46,561 --> 01:48:48,720
which is what people always think like 
the environment,

1736
01:48:48,721 --> 01:48:52,170
you know,
the animals and the trees and nature.

1737
01:48:52,350 --> 01:48:55,600
But it isn't nature that selected us.
It's to other things.

1738
01:48:55,860 --> 01:48:59,850
Partly it's two things.
So one is the dominance hierarchy.

1739
01:48:59,851 --> 01:49:04,851
The male dominance hierarchy is one of 
the primary mechanisms of selection,

1740
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:06,740
so it's like,
oh,

1741
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:08,520
women are faced with a hard choice.

1742
01:49:08,550 --> 01:49:09,840
Which guided laughter,
right?

1743
01:49:09,841 --> 01:49:11,430
That's a hard choice.
Well,

1744
01:49:11,431 --> 01:49:15,180
so they do the same thing that people do
with the stock market.

1745
01:49:15,450 --> 01:49:16,283
They outsourced the cognitive problems,
the computational problem to the male 

1746
01:49:19,951 --> 01:49:20,784
dominance hierarchy.
Then they just let the mail sort 

1747
01:49:22,531 --> 01:49:23,364
themselves out however they're going to 
and then the appeal from the top and so 

1748
01:49:26,731 --> 01:49:27,564
what that means is the dominant male 
dominance hierarchy itself is a 

1749
01:49:30,521 --> 01:49:33,300
selection mechanism because if you fail 
at it,

1750
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:38,720
then you don't leave any offspring and 
so what that means is at least in part,

1751
01:49:39,601 --> 01:49:40,434
is that we have adapted to be better and
better at attaining status in dominance 

1752
01:49:46,471 --> 01:49:49,300
hierarchies.
God only knows how long a period of time

1753
01:49:49,450 --> 01:49:53,020
and that doesn't mean just power.
You know what it might mean?

1754
01:49:53,021 --> 01:49:55,120
Cognitive flexibility because you could 
imagine,

1755
01:49:55,870 --> 01:49:58,510
do you want me to its hierarchy a 
dominance hierarchy,

1756
01:49:58,511 --> 01:50:00,460
b dominance,
hierarchy seeds.

1757
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:02,440
Okay,
so if like if you're really successful,

1758
01:50:02,441 --> 01:50:05,170
you've climb up dominance hierarchy a 
right,

1759
01:50:05,171 --> 01:50:07,240
but you'd be in seat.
No.

1760
01:50:07,260 --> 01:50:09,490
If you have the landing,
those you just be a failure,

1761
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:10,713
so then you could say the ideal human 
being as someone who can climb to the 

1762
01:50:14,891 --> 01:50:15,724
top of a dominance hierarchy,
no matter what the dominance hierarchy 

1763
01:50:17,531 --> 01:50:19,330
is,
right?

1764
01:50:19,480 --> 01:50:22,150
So we've evolved to.

1765
01:50:24,310 --> 01:50:25,143
We've evolved such that success across 
the set of possible dominance 

1766
01:50:29,771 --> 01:50:30,604
hierarchies is the target and I think 
that's why we have general intelligence 

1767
01:50:34,990 --> 01:50:35,823
because general intelligence is a 
general problem solving mechanism and 

1768
01:50:39,730 --> 01:50:40,563
it's a single factory,
but there is intelligence is a single 

1769
01:50:43,331 --> 01:50:44,164
factor.
It's not divisible despite what people 

1770
01:50:47,951 --> 01:50:48,784
like
Robert Sternberg and Howard Gardner 

1771
01:50:53,790 --> 01:50:58,790
falsely played.
So and then from the female perspective,

1772
01:51:01,570 --> 01:51:04,720
females are the next gate keeper and 
that's why they're often.

1773
01:51:04,721 --> 01:51:06,910
Mother Nature took me a long time to 
figure this out.

1774
01:51:06,940 --> 01:51:08,550
Why the hell is it nature?
Feminine,

1775
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:12,070
multiple representations,
so very various.

1776
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:15,010
It's extraordinarily common mother 
nature.

1777
01:51:15,130 --> 01:51:17,680
You don't think a father of Mother 
Nature.

1778
01:51:17,980 --> 01:51:19,060
It's like why?
Well,

1779
01:51:19,061 --> 01:51:22,600
nature brings forth new forms,
so that's feminine.

1780
01:51:25,940 --> 01:51:29,620
Nature selects in fact,
that's the definition of nature.

1781
01:51:29,860 --> 01:51:30,693
From a Darwinian perspective.
Nature is that which selects women 

1782
01:51:35,051 --> 01:51:40,051
select their nature and that's partly 
why far more men than you might think,

1783
01:51:42,220 --> 01:51:43,053
like far more terrified of women because
to be rejected as a romantic partner by 

1784
01:51:50,141 --> 01:51:55,141
a woman is to be classified as vaguely 
acceptable life form.

1785
01:52:00,340 --> 01:52:02,660
Huh?
No value in propagating.

1786
01:52:02,830 --> 01:52:05,050
All
right,

1787
01:52:05,051 --> 01:52:08,550
so it's a major,
major rejection and no,

1788
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:12,040
I've had
some clients and many,

1789
01:52:12,041 --> 01:52:15,760
many people write to me whose primary 
problem is that?

1790
01:52:15,761 --> 01:52:16,900
They're so careful.
Women,

1791
01:52:16,901 --> 01:52:18,970
they can't even approach them.
Very,

1792
01:52:18,971 --> 01:52:19,810
very,
very cool.

1793
01:52:20,890 --> 01:52:21,723
So alright,
I'm going to show you this little 

1794
01:52:24,551 --> 01:52:25,384
triangle thing.

1795
01:52:26,940 --> 01:52:27,773
Cool.

1796
01:53:34,760 --> 01:53:38,670
Okay.
So your no nonverbal,

1797
01:53:38,671 --> 01:53:39,600
right?
Nonverbal.

1798
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:42,990
So what happened?
Well,

1799
01:53:43,380 --> 01:53:44,213
here's mother triangle.
I'm guess mother triangle has circle as 

1800
01:53:49,860 --> 01:53:54,860
a child and triangle
is maybe a friend,

1801
01:53:56,190 --> 01:54:00,570
but not one that's very welcome.
According to mother and a

1802
01:54:04,710 --> 01:54:05,543
child circled was trying to play with 
triangle filed and mother doesn't like 

1803
01:54:11,161 --> 01:54:12,900
that.
So she goes out there and pecks the hell

1804
01:54:12,901 --> 01:54:15,690
out of them,
chases them away,

1805
01:54:16,740 --> 01:54:21,740
pushes child circle back into that hole,
goes into the that.

1806
01:54:22,410 --> 01:54:25,170
And then Charles Circle isn't very happy
about that.

1807
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:26,753
Running around causing trouble and it 
manages to escape and then bad child 

1808
01:54:31,141 --> 01:54:31,974
train shows up and they play together 
and run around and run around and run 

1809
01:54:34,441 --> 01:54:38,070
around and run around with mother 
chasing them and then they will.

1810
01:54:38,071 --> 01:54:39,840
Maybe they elope.
Who knows,

1811
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:43,440
and then mother triangle has it fit and 
blood was in the house,

1812
01:54:43,570 --> 01:54:44,403
right?

1813
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:48,233
Reasonable.
Would you consider that a reasonable 

1814
01:54:50,100 --> 01:54:55,100
story about what happened?
Perhaps you had other interpretations,

1815
01:54:55,800 --> 01:54:58,860
but I suspect they were vaguely along 
that line,

1816
01:54:59,570 --> 01:55:00,403
but the point here is the point of this 
experiment is how much information do 

1817
01:55:03,871 --> 01:55:08,300
you need from which to derive the 
narrative and the answer is like none.

1818
01:55:08,540 --> 01:55:10,350
It just.
It's just immediate.

1819
01:55:10,380 --> 01:55:11,213
You can watch some triangles moving 
around a box and instantly you 

1820
01:55:15,780 --> 01:55:16,613
personalize it and that's because that's
what your life and the reason you're 

1821
01:55:22,231 --> 01:55:26,250
like that is because your environment 
isn't nature.

1822
01:55:27,900 --> 01:55:29,250
Your environment,
these culture,

1823
01:55:29,600 --> 01:55:32,380
your environment is other people,
other people,

1824
01:55:32,970 --> 01:55:37,830
and that was even more true for 
chimpanzees and so forth that especially

1825
01:55:37,890 --> 01:55:41,100
animals that had a limited diet like 
gorillas,

1826
01:55:41,160 --> 01:55:44,290
they pretty much all eat leaves.
You know what?

1827
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:45,193
Chimps spends like 12 hours a day 
chewing and that's where they have got 

1828
01:55:49,470 --> 01:55:52,320
like this.
It's like you can't eat leaves,

1829
01:55:52,530 --> 01:55:53,760
you know,
have you tried,

1830
01:55:53,990 --> 01:55:56,040
they have no nutrition,
so if you're going to eat leads,

1831
01:55:56,041 --> 01:56:01,041
you have to eat a lot of them and then 
it takes like three months to digest.

1832
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:05,820
And so what we've done,
and this is pretty cool because smart is

1833
01:56:05,821 --> 01:56:10,821
that we've traded gut for brain and 
that's what we're so spelled and the way

1834
01:56:11,401 --> 01:56:12,234
we manage that it appears is that we 
learned how to use fire to cook things 

1835
01:56:15,330 --> 01:56:19,440
and that meant that we had high quality 
nutrition much higher.

1836
01:56:19,441 --> 01:56:22,350
It's easier to digest things especially 
neat.

1837
01:56:22,920 --> 01:56:23,753
And so because we invented fire,
we didn't have to have so much in test 

1838
01:56:27,290 --> 01:56:29,820
items.
We could spend a little more time on the

1839
01:56:29,821 --> 01:56:33,500
brain.
So human beings really are fire users.

1840
01:56:33,510 --> 01:56:38,510
We invented fire or discovered it or 
mastered it at least a couple of million

1841
01:56:38,581 --> 01:56:39,414
years for a long time.
So that's all pretty cool as far as I'm 

1842
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:45,353
concerned.

1843
01:56:47,540 --> 01:56:52,540
So that's partly how we think
and that's naturally how you think.

1844
01:56:53,280 --> 01:56:54,113
You think a certain way.
And so we'll say that your fundamental 

1845
01:56:56,491 --> 01:57:00,780
architecture is social cognitive,
you tend to view the world as a persona.

1846
01:57:02,010 --> 01:57:06,480
And the reason for that is that the 
world in which you emerge as a being was

1847
01:57:06,481 --> 01:57:07,314
primarily social.
What you needed to know was who's the 

1848
01:57:09,481 --> 01:57:11,160
big primate,
who's the little primate,

1849
01:57:11,190 --> 01:57:12,740
who's related to who,
you know,

1850
01:57:12,750 --> 01:57:13,583
among chimps.
If a big chimp is threatened by a small 

1851
01:57:16,231 --> 01:57:18,140
chip,
well,

1852
01:57:18,240 --> 01:57:19,073
you know,
the big chimp just care this small chip 

1853
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:20,993
party,
but the big chimp will back off if it 

1854
01:57:24,391 --> 01:57:29,280
knows that the little chimp is 
associated with some really big chimps.

1855
01:57:29,970 --> 01:57:30,803
And so the little chip can bowling the 
big chimp because it's part of a 

1856
01:57:33,570 --> 01:57:36,990
dominant family.
And that's because the nervous system of

1857
01:57:36,991 --> 01:57:39,840
the big gym doesn't respond to the 
little chimp,

1858
01:57:39,990 --> 01:57:42,270
like a little chimp.
It responds to the little chimp,

1859
01:57:42,271 --> 01:57:43,104
like it's a little chimp with four great
monsters attached to it because it's 

1860
01:57:47,791 --> 01:57:48,624
true.
So it's nervous system is actually 

1861
01:57:50,491 --> 01:57:54,060
responding to the network around the 
champion.

1862
01:57:54,830 --> 01:57:56,220
And so that's exactly what you.
Well,

1863
01:57:56,221 --> 01:57:58,200
it's not exactly what you're like 
because you're not chips,

1864
01:57:58,201 --> 01:57:59,034
but you know,
it's that kind of platform that 

1865
01:58:01,831 --> 01:58:05,700
constitutes the evolutionary 
underpinnings of your psyche.

1866
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:09,480
So what does that mean?
Well,

1867
01:58:09,481 --> 01:58:12,210
it means this is like perfectly fine to 
us,

1868
01:58:12,300 --> 01:58:14,040
right?
Can animate things.

1869
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:16,440
Rabbits are people.
No problem.

1870
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:18,030
We'll go along with that.

1871
01:58:20,080 --> 01:58:23,430
You remember Roger Rabbit,
I presume most of you watch that.

1872
01:58:23,640 --> 01:58:26,070
So this is the detective who's name I 
don't remember.

1873
01:58:26,430 --> 01:58:27,263
He asked to go to toontown because 
there's cartoons and there's people and 

1874
01:58:30,630 --> 01:58:33,890
they share the same world.
And you could go into toontown the.

1875
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:36,280
It's kind of annoying because cartoon 
figures,

1876
01:58:36,281 --> 01:58:37,114
they're kind of annoying,
like slapstick types and so he's very 

1877
01:58:39,870 --> 01:58:42,190
happy to be there.
And this is what it looks like.

1878
01:58:44,380 --> 01:58:47,410
Everything's animated,
meaning alive.

1879
01:58:47,770 --> 01:58:48,603
Anima means soul underway.
So everything has a personality and you 

1880
01:58:53,321 --> 01:58:56,890
know when you're reading books to kids,
his son has a personality,

1881
01:58:56,920 --> 01:58:58,360
train,
has a personality,

1882
01:58:58,480 --> 01:59:00,880
Jeff has a personality.
It doesn't matter what it is,

1883
01:59:00,881 --> 01:59:01,714
it has a personality and that's because 
the child is learning to understand the 

1884
01:59:04,481 --> 01:59:06,850
world using the architecture,
social,

1885
01:59:06,851 --> 01:59:08,410
cognitive,
architecture and so.

1886
01:59:08,680 --> 01:59:10,480
And the thing that's really interesting 
about that,

1887
01:59:10,540 --> 01:59:11,373
it's just blows me away,
know evolution is conservative and so 

1888
01:59:14,111 --> 01:59:16,750
once it's produced something it has to 
build on it.

1889
01:59:17,290 --> 01:59:21,520
It's like dos the operating system.
It's like really?

1890
01:59:22,150 --> 01:59:24,460
It's still there.
If I remember correctly,

1891
01:59:24,461 --> 01:59:29,440
under windows 10 you can get rid of the 
damn thing because it's part part of the

1892
01:59:29,441 --> 01:59:32,860
structure down and it's like the 
keyboards we use,

1893
01:59:33,070 --> 01:59:37,300
which are actually designed to slow 
typers down because with mechanical type

1894
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:38,950
writers,
if you type too fast,

1895
01:59:38,951 --> 01:59:41,470
the keys with jam.
So they divided device,

1896
01:59:41,471 --> 01:59:44,200
the keyboard to slow you down and we 
still use it,

1897
01:59:44,350 --> 01:59:46,330
which is stupid,
you know,

1898
01:59:46,340 --> 01:59:51,160
you want the high frequency letters 
close to your middle fingers.

1899
01:59:51,820 --> 01:59:52,653
That's what it's like at all.
But we can't change it because everyone 

1900
01:59:54,521 --> 01:59:56,920
uses it.
So your body plan,

1901
01:59:57,100 --> 01:59:59,350
that thing has been around a long time,
man.

1902
01:59:59,710 --> 02:00:03,070
If you look at mammals particular,
anybody even lizard,

1903
02:00:04,540 --> 02:00:08,080
there's so much like us in their,
in their skeletal structure that is just

1904
02:00:08,081 --> 02:00:09,220
mind boggling,
you know,

1905
02:00:09,230 --> 02:00:14,230
enroll variants of the same
symmetrical four legged.

1906
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:17,033
How here structure.
And so you have to build a what you 

1907
02:00:21,311 --> 02:00:22,144
have,
and if you have a social cognitive 

1908
02:00:23,531 --> 02:00:24,364
architecture,
then you have to first understand the 

1909
02:00:26,351 --> 02:00:28,480
world through the social cognitive 
categories.

1910
02:00:28,690 --> 02:00:32,110
And what sort of bloody strange about 
that is it actually seems to work.

1911
02:00:32,290 --> 02:00:36,850
We actually seem to develop a coherent 
representation of being.

1912
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:40,090
I would say I'm being.
That's not the same as nature.

1913
02:00:40,590 --> 02:00:41,423
It's not the same as the world because 
when we think of the world we think of 

1914
02:00:44,111 --> 02:00:44,944
the objective world,
and I'm not talking about the objective 

1915
02:00:47,090 --> 02:00:47,923
world,
I'm talking about the world of human 

1916
02:00:49,031 --> 02:00:52,030
experience.
And we see that through social cognitive

1917
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:55,270
filter and it makes perfect sense to us 
and it works.

1918
02:00:55,630 --> 02:00:57,610
That's so strange.
So anyways,

1919
02:00:58,630 --> 02:00:59,463
everything's got this animated nature 
and we don't have a problem with that 

1920
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:04,780
fact.
We actually find it quite fun.

1921
02:01:06,170 --> 02:01:07,003
No people go visit the Disney toontown 
and participate in it to have fun with 

1922
02:01:14,201 --> 02:01:14,370
it.

1923
02:01:14,370 --> 02:01:15,203
And so that shows you as well how,
how natural it is for us to view things 

1924
02:01:20,231 --> 02:01:20,711
this way.
You know,

1925
02:01:20,711 --> 02:01:23,130
cars have faces,
right?

1926
02:01:24,130 --> 02:01:24,963
Designers know that.
They know that people don't want a car 

1927
02:01:27,641 --> 02:01:28,474
with three headlights because like who 
wants to be associated with the three 

1928
02:01:32,170 --> 02:01:33,670
eyed monster?
No one.

1929
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:34,833
It's like two eyes.
That's something you could be 

1930
02:01:36,281 --> 02:01:40,130
comfortable with.
And so cars have faces,

1931
02:01:40,530 --> 02:01:43,970
BMW's and the new ones,
they really look cat like you know,

1932
02:01:44,290 --> 02:01:47,030
and they have sexy curves.
They do,

1933
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:49,340
they do.
There's been MRI studies of that.

1934
02:01:49,341 --> 02:01:50,174
So
if you show man photographs of 

1935
02:01:53,900 --> 02:01:55,610
attractive women looking directly at 
them,

1936
02:01:55,611 --> 02:01:58,130
there's a little part of the brain 
called the nucleus accumbens that lights

1937
02:01:58,131 --> 02:02:00,770
up because to have someone look directly
at you,

1938
02:02:00,860 --> 02:02:01,693
especially if they have like a smile.
It is interpreted as an invitation to 

1939
02:02:05,001 --> 02:02:05,834
approach and women,
they have the same damn problem because 

1940
02:02:08,450 --> 02:02:11,100
with women,
because if you go into drugstores saying

1941
02:02:11,130 --> 02:02:13,640
you look at women's magazines,
they're all the same.

1942
02:02:14,060 --> 02:02:16,190
They've all evolved to the same 
endpoint.

1943
02:02:16,700 --> 02:02:18,290
They all have an attractive woman on 
them,

1944
02:02:18,380 --> 02:02:20,630
all of them,
and they're looking right out.

1945
02:02:20,810 --> 02:02:21,643
And so when women see that,
they actually see it as something to 

1946
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:25,640
approach.
It's an ideal.

1947
02:02:26,210 --> 02:02:27,043
And now you know,
people say that those beauty ideals are 

1948
02:02:29,421 --> 02:02:32,240
oppressive to women.
All ideals are oppressive,

1949
02:02:32,540 --> 02:02:33,373
but the empirical research,
some of it down here suggests that 

1950
02:02:36,080 --> 02:02:41,080
interacting with those images
helps the performance,

1951
02:02:41,361 --> 02:02:42,194
the psychological function of helping 
the woman to equate yourself with the 

1952
02:02:44,721 --> 02:02:49,400
ideal and in most cases that actually 
produces a pop and elevation in mood and

1953
02:02:49,401 --> 02:02:50,234
you know,
think about it.

1954
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:51,313
You're really going to go to the 
magazine store when you're just looking 

1955
02:02:53,211 --> 02:02:54,044
for something to do and you're going to 
buy something that makes you feel 

1956
02:02:56,510 --> 02:02:58,640
depressed and the oppressed.
It's like,

1957
02:02:58,641 --> 02:02:59,750
no,
you're not going to do that.

1958
02:02:59,900 --> 02:03:00,733
Magazines that do that to you,
they will die because no one will buy 

1959
02:03:04,161 --> 02:03:07,190
them and there's a reason they all 
turned out the same way.

1960
02:03:07,191 --> 02:03:09,650
It's like they're just responding to 
demand.

1961
02:03:10,200 --> 02:03:15,200
So
faces.

1962
02:03:16,710 --> 02:03:18,810
Oh yes,
with regards to the sexy curves,

1963
02:03:18,811 --> 02:03:19,644
so
woman who looks woman's picture looking 

1964
02:03:22,891 --> 02:03:24,080
right at us,
man,

1965
02:03:24,090 --> 02:03:26,850
we'll produce this activation in the 
primary reward system.

1966
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,780
Cocaine produces the same response and 
Sodas,

1967
02:03:29,800 --> 02:03:33,810
sports cars,
especially curvy red sports car.

1968
02:03:34,260 --> 02:03:35,093
So that's why you often see an 
attractive woman sitting on a curvy red 

1969
02:03:37,501 --> 02:03:40,680
sports car in an APP because it's,
you know,

1970
02:03:41,040 --> 02:03:43,920
if there's an ad for beer on the side,
it's like,

1971
02:03:44,070 --> 02:03:45,210
hey,
everything's perfect.

1972
02:03:45,640 --> 02:03:46,950
So,
and you know,

1973
02:03:46,951 --> 02:03:47,784
those are all primary reward 
representations that may produce 

1974
02:03:51,150 --> 02:03:53,850
attraction because part of positive 
emotion,

1975
02:03:53,851 --> 02:03:54,684
the Dopa beneath filament,
urgently mediated element of positive 

1976
02:03:57,090 --> 02:03:57,923
emotion isn't approach emotion.
It's not a satiation satisfaction 

1977
02:04:01,561 --> 02:04:02,940
emotion.
It's all good.

1978
02:04:02,941 --> 02:04:04,760
There's something good here I can move 
towards.

1979
02:04:05,120 --> 02:04:09,660
And that that is what happiness is.
That's directed what happiness is.

1980
02:04:10,600 --> 02:04:11,433
It's not attaining something because 
that just puts you in a whole new 

1981
02:04:13,771 --> 02:04:16,110
problem.
You got to figure out what to do next.

1982
02:04:17,720 --> 02:04:19,620
All right,
so I suggested to you

1983
02:04:23,990 --> 02:04:26,720
that one of the problems that we have,
that problem,

1984
02:04:26,810 --> 02:04:30,740
I would say is not what the world is 
made out of,

1985
02:04:30,890 --> 02:04:31,723
but how we should be in the world 
because we're alive and how we should 

1986
02:04:34,700 --> 02:04:35,630
be.
Well,

1987
02:04:36,080 --> 02:04:40,620
it's fairly straightforward.
Not so much pain would be good.

1988
02:04:40,710 --> 02:04:42,510
That'd be good.
Not Too much anxiety.

1989
02:04:42,540 --> 02:04:44,520
Hey,
we're on board for that.

1990
02:04:44,940 --> 02:04:48,090
I'm little pleasure down then some 
stability,

1991
02:04:48,710 --> 02:04:50,460
uh,
not dying.

1992
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:52,530
That's a big one.
That's a big one.

1993
02:04:52,890 --> 02:04:55,770
And then let's say from a Darwinian 
perspective,

1994
02:04:55,950 --> 02:04:59,210
propagate.
And so that's what Raymond out.

1995
02:04:59,211 --> 02:05:01,500
And the reason we did that is you just 
think about this,

1996
02:05:01,501 --> 02:05:06,270
it's so amazing.
So every single one of your,

1997
02:05:06,760 --> 02:05:09,120
of the relatives you have in your 
ancestry,

1998
02:05:09,330 --> 02:05:10,163
every single one of them
successfully produced a child who 

1999
02:05:16,161 --> 02:05:16,994
successively successfully produced a 
child all the way back to 3 billion 

2000
02:05:21,481 --> 02:05:24,750
years ago.
It's bloody unbelievable.

2001
02:05:24,750 --> 02:05:26,850
Like the probability that you exist.
Well,

2002
02:05:26,851 --> 02:05:27,684
it's 100 percent because there you are,
but the probability of predicting that 

2003
02:05:31,201 --> 02:05:32,700
you would exist,
you know,

2004
02:05:32,701 --> 02:05:33,534
if you tried to get predicted,
it's like the chance that the chances 

2005
02:05:36,811 --> 02:05:41,580
that you're here so infinite testable,
that it's just absolutely mind boggling.

2006
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:42,593
Think about that unbroken sequence of 
success over literally over billions of 

2007
02:05:48,120 --> 02:05:49,050
years.
God,

2008
02:05:49,290 --> 02:05:51,660
it's amazing.
And so you have to,

2009
02:05:52,650 --> 02:05:53,483
obviously you have to think that there's
a pretty strong proclivity for that to 

2010
02:05:58,111 --> 02:05:58,681
happen.
I mean,

2011
02:05:58,681 --> 02:06:00,570
some of that,
obviously it was a necessity,

2012
02:06:00,930 --> 02:06:01,763
but not only that,
I mean it's necessary that impregnated 

2013
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:06,713
females have an infant.
It isn't necessary that they keep it 

2014
02:06:09,841 --> 02:06:14,460
alive so you can account for that 
continuity.

2015
02:06:14,461 --> 02:06:16,260
Mary,
from necessity,

2016
02:06:16,500 --> 02:06:17,333
you have to interject at least a small 
amount of consideration that the care 

2017
02:06:22,651 --> 02:06:23,484
that's associated,
especially with taking care of infants 

2018
02:06:25,111 --> 02:06:25,944
because they're,
you know,

2019
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:30,240
there are a lot of work that's there to 
say this.

2020
02:06:30,240 --> 02:06:31,073
It's actually,
I think it's manifested in the 

2021
02:06:32,251 --> 02:06:33,084
personality trait.
Agreeableness looks to be like 

2022
02:06:35,550 --> 02:06:36,383
agreeableness is one of the dimensions 
were admitting women very most 

2023
02:06:38,460 --> 02:06:39,293
substantially.
Agreeableness looks to be like the 

2024
02:06:41,611 --> 02:06:42,444
manifestation of the maternal instinct.
Now men can be agreeable to because of 

2025
02:06:45,421 --> 02:06:47,280
course male human beings to take care of
children.

2026
02:06:47,940 --> 02:06:50,370
You know,
you're a grizzly bear female.

2027
02:06:50,580 --> 02:06:53,610
You just chase the damn mail away 
because he'll kill your cups.

2028
02:06:53,611 --> 02:06:56,970
That's not so helpful,
but they're not maternal at all.

2029
02:06:57,210 --> 02:06:59,280
Quite the contrary.
But you know,

2030
02:06:59,281 --> 02:07:00,114
human manner are pretty damn maternal.
They're not as a wait a minute on 

2031
02:07:03,241 --> 02:07:04,074
average,
although some women are less maternal 

2032
02:07:06,930 --> 02:07:09,600
than some men because you know the 
curves overlap.

2033
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:14,640
But on balance,
how are we in the world?

2034
02:07:14,670 --> 02:07:16,920
Well,
we're aware of our own vulnerability,

2035
02:07:17,630 --> 02:07:21,060
who are aware of our own shortcomings,
let's say,

2036
02:07:21,240 --> 02:07:22,073
and that's I think that's partly from 
being a social being because people are 

2037
02:07:24,661 --> 02:07:25,494
always signaling your shortcomings to 
you to such a degree that you even say 

2038
02:07:28,361 --> 02:07:29,194
go your shortcomings to yourself because
while you might as well fix them before 

2039
02:07:32,011 --> 02:07:32,844
someone else points them out,
that's guilt and know when Freud called 

2040
02:07:36,851 --> 02:07:37,684
that the Superego,
the superego is kind of like the 

2041
02:07:38,981 --> 02:07:43,420
internalized representation of the 
judgmental father and culture I think is

2042
02:07:43,421 --> 02:07:45,550
represented as a father figure.

2043
02:07:46,240 --> 02:07:47,073
God,
the father dies say because it's 

2044
02:07:48,341 --> 02:07:49,174
actually.
It's actually quite a bit like there 

2045
02:07:50,351 --> 02:07:52,690
isn't all CNI and it's all of these 
watching you.

2046
02:07:53,050 --> 02:07:53,883
It's a really,
really intelligent way of 

2047
02:07:54,881 --> 02:07:55,714
conceptualizing it because the group 
which is more or less eternal is 

2048
02:08:00,911 --> 02:08:03,580
watching you all the time,
all the time.

2049
02:08:03,970 --> 02:08:04,803
And it's judging all the time.
And we know that if you put people in a 

2050
02:08:09,131 --> 02:08:11,450
room when you put a pig eye on the ball,
you know nick,

2051
02:08:11,580 --> 02:08:14,800
you give them an opportunity to cheat on
some little cheesy thing.

2052
02:08:14,801 --> 02:08:15,850
You know,
nothing too important.

2053
02:08:16,960 --> 02:08:17,793
If they're in the room with the big guy,
they're less likely to cheat if they're 

2054
02:08:19,751 --> 02:08:23,020
in the room with no light at all,
so you know,

2055
02:08:23,080 --> 02:08:23,913
and what do you do?
You keep an eye on your kids and the 

2056
02:08:25,331 --> 02:08:26,164
reason you do that and so they don't 
misbehave and we keep an eye on each 

2057
02:08:28,481 --> 02:08:33,340
other and so we have a representation of
that and as far as I can tell,

2058
02:08:33,341 --> 02:08:37,930
we represented as a transcendent figure 
of judgment and just like.

2059
02:08:37,931 --> 02:08:40,390
Yeah,
Hey,

2060
02:08:41,020 --> 02:08:44,640
that's a pretty good metaphor.
So

2061
02:08:48,670 --> 02:08:49,503
one of the.

2062
02:08:53,140 --> 02:08:53,973
This is a major intellectual about the 
major intellectual and it's raging in 

2063
02:09:00,191 --> 02:09:01,024
universities.
It's basically a battle between post 

2064
02:09:03,950 --> 02:09:08,950
modernism and traditional and tradition.
I think that's the right way of thinking

2065
02:09:11,261 --> 02:09:14,650
about it for the postmodernists.
Human beings have no nature.

2066
02:09:15,790 --> 02:09:19,320
We're blank slates and everything that 
we are as inculturating,

2067
02:09:19,380 --> 02:09:24,010
so we're completely malleable and all 
elements of our identity or going on the

2068
02:09:24,011 --> 02:09:26,470
other side are the traditionalists who 
are,

2069
02:09:26,530 --> 02:09:30,820
I would say grounded more in
biology on the one hand,

2070
02:09:30,821 --> 02:09:31,654
but also in historical
humanities tradition that suggests that 

2071
02:09:37,421 --> 02:09:41,350
people have in nature.
I explained some of that nature.

2072
02:09:41,500 --> 02:09:44,020
Most people want to have friends as part
of your nature,

2073
02:09:44,370 --> 02:09:45,203
you know,
most people want to find love part of 

2074
02:09:47,621 --> 02:09:50,900
your nature and you suffer without it,
so you know,

2075
02:09:51,150 --> 02:09:52,930
he could say those are all social 
constructs,

2076
02:09:52,931 --> 02:09:53,764
but
you can say you can say anything so you 

2077
02:09:57,701 --> 02:09:58,660
know,
and

2078
02:10:00,160 --> 02:10:04,510
no one ever trust someone who has one 
explanation for everything.

2079
02:10:05,350 --> 02:10:07,540
You know,
how much intelligence does that take?

2080
02:10:08,120 --> 02:10:08,953
You got one explanation.
You just try to note for every 

2081
02:10:10,871 --> 02:10:14,260
phenomena,
this is an alternative.

2082
02:10:14,290 --> 02:10:15,730
Now,
here's what happened in part

2083
02:10:17,620 --> 02:10:19,990
nature.
Back in the late 18,

2084
02:10:19,991 --> 02:10:20,824
hundreds was very interested in the 
disillusion of traditional faith and in 

2085
02:10:25,850 --> 02:10:29,260
the West we fell out of our myth.
That's a way of thinking about it.

2086
02:10:29,590 --> 02:10:30,423
You start believing in its fundamental 
axioms was he stopped believing that 

2087
02:10:33,621 --> 02:10:35,960
there was such a thing as a transcendent
deity.

2088
02:10:35,961 --> 02:10:36,794
For example,
if you didn't mesh well with the 

2089
02:10:39,021 --> 02:10:43,220
emerging scientific viewpoint,
and so in the late 18 hundreds,

2090
02:10:43,221 --> 02:10:48,221
Nietzsche announced the depth of God,
which sounds fairly presumptuous,

2091
02:10:50,390 --> 02:10:51,223
but it wasn't something.
He was celebrating the full quote and I 

2092
02:10:53,691 --> 02:10:55,690
haven't gotten it exactly right.
His thoughts here,

2093
02:10:55,760 --> 02:10:56,593
we've killed them and we'll never find 
enough water to wash away the rivers of 

2094
02:10:59,901 --> 02:11:01,320
blood like that.

2095
02:11:01,340 --> 02:11:06,340
It's a lot different than what you see 
scrawled on bathroom walls and meet you.

2096
02:11:07,590 --> 02:11:08,423
Apply that in the 20th century.
Millions of people would die in the 

2097
02:11:12,411 --> 02:11:13,244
conflicts over what values we're going 
to reign as an alternative to that 

2098
02:11:17,121 --> 02:11:20,360
tradition,
and he particularly brilliantly

2099
02:11:22,280 --> 02:11:24,950
pointed to communism.
He said that's where it's going to be,

2100
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:27,770
and dusty,
she did the same thing and so

2101
02:11:31,060 --> 02:11:34,460
since then there's this been this battle
and the battle is kind of like this.

2102
02:11:34,461 --> 02:11:38,030
The battle is on the one hand between 
social construction,

2103
02:11:38,480 --> 02:11:42,410
social constructionist utopians who 
believed that human nature is infinitely

2104
02:11:42,411 --> 02:11:45,770
malleable and that with the proper 
transformation since society,

2105
02:11:45,771 --> 02:11:50,210
you can bring the part about the perfect
state in the perfect human being and

2106
02:11:52,130 --> 02:11:52,963
and traditionalists
and you and I think is the classic 

2107
02:11:57,801 --> 02:11:58,634
example of this who believed that there 
is a human nature and it's deeply 

2108
02:12:02,661 --> 02:12:06,110
embedded within us and that the culture 
is we set up,

2109
02:12:06,111 --> 02:12:10,580
have to manifest themselves in 
accordance with that nature or they will

2110
02:12:10,581 --> 02:12:11,414
fail.

2111
02:12:13,430 --> 02:12:14,263
Oh,
young believed in the existence of a 

2112
02:12:15,910 --> 02:12:17,330
narrative,
the hero myth,

2113
02:12:17,420 --> 02:12:18,253
roughly speaking,
and he explained his connections to 

2114
02:12:20,511 --> 02:12:24,770
various religious traditions,
staggeringly brilliant manner.

2115
02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:25,873
Camille Paglia,
who I would recommend that they picked 

2116
02:12:27,680 --> 02:12:29,810
already told me that you know,
she,

2117
02:12:29,870 --> 02:12:30,703
she's already concluded after going 
through a radical feminist period early 

2118
02:12:34,490 --> 02:12:35,323
in your life,
that the proper way for society to 

2119
02:12:37,701 --> 02:12:38,534
Orient itself is within a mythological 
structure and that that's part of what 

2120
02:12:41,540 --> 02:12:46,340
the humanities provides
and the alternative is

2121
02:12:49,310 --> 02:12:50,143
rational arguments over what values are 
going to dominate and it isn't obvious 

2122
02:12:54,051 --> 02:12:57,200
that rationality can solve that problem.
I don't think it can.

2123
02:12:57,680 --> 02:12:59,780
That's humans point.
David Hume said,

2124
02:12:59,810 --> 02:13:02,660
you can't derive an entrepreneur is 
right.

2125
02:13:02,750 --> 02:13:05,390
You cannot use science as a guide to 
behavior.

2126
02:13:06,500 --> 02:13:07,370
So what do you use?

2127
02:13:09,650 --> 02:13:11,570
Instinct,
instinct,

2128
02:13:11,571 --> 02:13:15,890
manifested in imagination and the 
evolution,

2129
02:13:15,950 --> 02:13:18,860
the evolved structure of your organic 
cultures,

2130
02:13:19,370 --> 02:13:21,290
something like that.
Do they have a structure?

2131
02:13:22,100 --> 02:13:23,300
That's the question.
Okay,

2132
02:13:23,301 --> 02:13:27,530
so you ask yourself this question,
what is it that every human being shares

2133
02:13:27,531 --> 02:13:28,364
regardless of place and time,
so any universally comprehensive 

2134
02:13:31,891 --> 02:13:35,430
language that would be a Meta narrative,
a myth,

2135
02:13:35,431 --> 02:13:36,264
the hero myth.
Let's say a myth about what a human 

2136
02:13:38,281 --> 02:13:43,281
being not only his life but shouldn't be
asked to speak to us about those aspects

2137
02:13:43,801 --> 02:13:47,160
of experience that we all share because 
otherwise we just kept the damn story.

2138
02:13:47,310 --> 02:13:48,143
Now we go to how we go to the stories 
that we understand that all the time 

2139
02:13:51,270 --> 02:13:54,060
like star wars and it really doesn't 
matter what country,

2140
02:13:54,310 --> 02:13:56,130
you know,
everybody gets it more legs.

2141
02:13:56,550 --> 02:14:00,600
So obviously there are stories that you 
can understand and mutually,

2142
02:14:00,660 --> 02:14:02,310
you know,
we understand the law of stories.

2143
02:14:02,311 --> 02:14:05,250
We understand stories of conflict,
we understand the stories of betrayal,

2144
02:14:05,251 --> 02:14:08,400
we understand stories of anger.
And that's because we can feel jealousy.

2145
02:14:08,401 --> 02:14:10,260
We can feel love,
we can feel anger.

2146
02:14:10,500 --> 02:14:13,140
It's his party.
It's right there.

2147
02:14:13,290 --> 02:14:15,850
We even know where the circuits are,
you know,

2148
02:14:15,960 --> 02:14:18,540
and then you're like other animals,
they feel that too.

2149
02:14:18,600 --> 02:14:21,540
So very similar emotions as far as we 
can tell.

2150
02:14:22,500 --> 02:14:23,333
So

2151
02:14:26,870 --> 02:14:28,370
here's,
here's,

2152
02:14:28,520 --> 02:14:31,700
this is derived in large part from you,
but not only,

2153
02:14:32,620 --> 02:14:34,850
um,
here's what we share,

2154
02:14:36,440 --> 02:14:41,440
natural world social world and the fact 
of our existence as an individual.

2155
02:14:43,250 --> 02:14:44,900
And that can be represented different 
ways.

2156
02:14:44,901 --> 02:14:45,734
It can be represented as you,
the known and the unknown or it can be 

2157
02:14:50,091 --> 02:14:50,924
you culture and nature,
all the same representations and the 

2158
02:14:55,700 --> 02:14:59,180
cultural representation tends to be 
male.

2159
02:14:59,750 --> 02:15:00,650
That's gone.
Father,

2160
02:15:00,651 --> 02:15:02,090
let's say,
and they

2161
02:15:03,950 --> 02:15:07,280
representation.
The Feminine Representation tends to be

2162
02:15:08,930 --> 02:15:11,990
female.
This is the known

2163
02:15:13,490 --> 02:15:14,323
culture apollonian control that's 
associated with the sun son 

2164
02:15:17,730 --> 02:15:18,830
consciousness,
the cane,

2165
02:15:18,831 --> 02:15:19,664
the patriarch,
the cloud because it pushes up the 

2166
02:15:21,681 --> 02:15:22,514
earth.
The Phallus obviously order and 

2167
02:15:24,990 --> 02:15:26,810
authority and the crushing weight of 
tradition,

2168
02:15:26,811 --> 02:15:31,130
the wise old man and the tyrant dogma,
the day sky,

2169
02:15:31,500 --> 02:15:34,370
the country down the iron heights,
the ancestral spirits,

2170
02:15:34,640 --> 02:15:35,860
the activity of the death

2171
02:15:40,010 --> 02:15:40,843
Captain Hook.
He's a tyrant and that's why Peter Pan 

2172
02:15:42,621 --> 02:15:43,454
doesn't want to grow up to become him 
and that's why Peter Pan doesn't grow 

2173
02:15:46,430 --> 02:15:48,470
because he thinks that adults are 
pirates.

2174
02:15:48,740 --> 02:15:51,570
Why is captain hook a tyrant as a 
crocodile?

2175
02:15:51,571 --> 02:15:52,404
Laid his hand in the crocodile has a 
clock in its stomach and the reason for 

2176
02:15:55,551 --> 02:15:56,384
that is that the crocodile is time and 
time's over and he got a piece of 

2177
02:15:59,750 --> 02:16:02,210
Captain Hook and he's not very happy 
about.

2178
02:16:02,300 --> 02:16:04,550
He's bitter and resentful and too 
radical,

2179
02:16:04,670 --> 02:16:08,330
and when Peter Pan looks out adulthood,
that's what he sees and he thinks,

2180
02:16:08,331 --> 02:16:09,164
why should I sacrifice the potential of 
childhood for the singularity of 

2181
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:13,633
tyranny?
And so we stay as immature his entire 

2182
02:16:15,681 --> 02:16:19,850
life and he's king of the lost boys.
Jesus break.

2183
02:16:20,300 --> 02:16:25,130
There's a porn star named Jeremy.
Can't remember his name.

2184
02:16:25,560 --> 02:16:29,050
Really good
guy.

2185
02:16:29,610 --> 02:16:32,770
He didn't miss it.
Something funny.

2186
02:16:32,771 --> 02:16:36,790
I was watching a documentary about him 
and he said the funniest thing.

2187
02:16:36,820 --> 02:16:38,920
He said,
alright,

2188
02:16:38,980 --> 02:16:43,240
with that hero to people who think 
people like me are heroes.

2189
02:16:43,480 --> 02:16:45,020
Hey,
what a drag.

2190
02:16:45,220 --> 02:16:47,500
I mean,
he's just in this horrible situation.

2191
02:16:47,501 --> 02:16:49,870
He doesn't admire the people that admire
him,

2192
02:16:50,350 --> 02:16:52,030
but he gets inspired by them all the 
time,

2193
02:16:52,440 --> 02:16:54,040
but it's sort of like Peter Pan.
It's like,

2194
02:16:54,041 --> 02:16:55,210
well,
he's kicking the lost boys.

2195
02:16:55,330 --> 02:16:58,490
He doesn't get windy though,
right?

2196
02:16:58,750 --> 02:17:00,640
She grows up.
She has family.

2197
02:17:00,910 --> 02:17:03,340
He asked to contend himself with 
Tinkerbell,

2198
02:17:03,850 --> 02:17:06,250
and you know what?
Tinkerbell doesn't exist.

2199
02:17:07,370 --> 02:17:08,150
Well,
that's what happens.

2200
02:17:08,150 --> 02:17:11,230
You can do it for a lot.
That's a representation of culture.

2201
02:17:11,690 --> 02:17:12,523
That's a nasty

2202
02:17:16,540 --> 02:17:20,080
hell kiss.
Kiss the statue of Stellar.

2203
02:17:20,920 --> 02:17:25,030
Who cares that he murdered 30 million 
people culture?

2204
02:17:25,960 --> 02:17:26,793
Well,
you know,

2205
02:17:27,440 --> 02:17:30,400
in university you hear a lot about the 
patriarchy and how oppressive it is.

2206
02:17:30,401 --> 02:17:30,921
It's like,
yeah,

2207
02:17:30,921 --> 02:17:32,230
yeah,
definitely.

2208
02:17:32,440 --> 02:17:33,273
No,
I'm kidding,

2209
02:17:33,400 --> 02:17:34,233
but you know,
it's kind of useful as well as provides 

2210
02:17:36,620 --> 02:17:37,453
to eat the food.
All of that which kind of 

2211
02:17:40,301 --> 02:17:44,900
counterbalances to some degree culture 
has opposed development.

2212
02:17:44,950 --> 02:17:45,783
Tenant take advil,
but the individual has a positive over 

2213
02:17:47,340 --> 02:17:48,173
the negative element.
Nature has a positive element and a 

2214
02:17:50,291 --> 02:17:51,124
negative element and if people tell you 
a one sided story which has the 

2215
02:17:54,240 --> 02:17:58,660
ideological story they leave out that 
you say all culture is terrible.

2216
02:17:58,790 --> 02:18:01,900
Human being or despoiled and nature is 
perfect.

2217
02:18:02,200 --> 02:18:03,033
It's like no nature kills you.
Culture keeps you alive and there's 

2218
02:18:08,970 --> 02:18:11,380
things about you that are honorable and 
good is wellness.

2219
02:18:11,381 --> 02:18:14,740
Things about you can learn and you need 
to know both of those.

2220
02:18:15,160 --> 02:18:16,810
And that's what the great stories tell 
us.

2221
02:18:18,780 --> 02:18:19,613
Alright.
