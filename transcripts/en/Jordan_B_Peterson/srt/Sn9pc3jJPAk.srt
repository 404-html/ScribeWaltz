1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,930
It's on me.
There we go.

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:04,860
All right.
We're live.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,210
We're live.
Holy Cow.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,051
Hello,
Youtube.

5
00:00:07,051 --> 00:00:10,440
We are live in Phoenix.
We're at Comerica theater.

6
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,940
I've got this Jordan Peterson guy.
I'm Simon.

7
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,070
I'm somehow hosting on his channel,
but that doesn't see right.

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,590
We're about to do what are maybe 13th,
14th,

9
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:21,120
15th.
They're all starting to blend.

10
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:24,150
Yeah.
In a good way for this one.

11
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,780
You really stepped up in the wardrobe 
department.

12
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:31,200
I feel very sharp.
Sharp.

13
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,450
This thing has been unbelievable.
Huh?

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,673
It's pretty remarkable.
And this theater in Phoenix is one of 

15
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:40,290
the most interesting ones yet.
It's very big.

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,050
It's about eight stories.
High side.

17
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,083
Yeah.
So about about 4,000 people waiting in 

18
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:48,390
there.
It's about 105 and Phoenix today.

19
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,750
They're actually only here to purchase 
the arch and

20
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,693
pretty much I,
I literally went to the gym twice today 

21
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:58,560
to sweat indoors because it was so hot 
outdoors.

22
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,420
Um,
but we've been bouncing around.

23
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,840
We just did three stops and tenses that 
night.

24
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,190
Everything has been great.
Like,

25
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,283
and what I say to you every night,
I say it before we started and then at 

26
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:10,650
the end it's like,
man,

27
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,550
everything that they say about this man,
about this tour,

28
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:15,384
about everything going on here,
it's completely the reverse of the 

29
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:19,390
truth.
Yeah,

30
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,760
it's pretty interesting.
Yeah.

31
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:21,594
Well,
I spent a fair bit of time after the 

32
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,060
lectures talking to people.
It's usually about 150 people that I get

33
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:27,894
to say hello to and,
and everybody has 15 seconds or so to 

34
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:34,260
tell me a story,
but they don't

35
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,430
really low.
Audio is low.

36
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,550
All right,
we're going to talk louder.

37
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,331
Okay.
All right.

38
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:42,420
We're going to talk louder.
Let's see if we can pick it up.

39
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,480
So yeah.
Energy,

40
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,353
peanuts in men.
So I talked to about 150 people 

41
00:01:48,571 --> 00:01:51,370
afterwards and um,
they,

42
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,523
they all have a story to tell me,
but most of the stories are variants on 

43
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:58,260
a theme,
which is that they're happy to listen to

44
00:01:58,261 --> 00:02:01,980
the lectures because it's helping them 
clarify their thinking or providing them

45
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,960
with words that they haven't had before.

46
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:05,483
Describe things they know to be true or 
they tell me that they're doing better 

47
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:13,520
as a couple or the father and son 
they're or or father and the daughter or

48
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,490
mother and the daughter and they're 
getting along better or it's a couple of

49
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,080
just decided to get engaged and their 
relationship is better.

50
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:24,290
Or a father who's he was doing better 
with his kids are,

51
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:27,240
but none of it's political.
It's political.

52
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,220
It's maybe it's maybe 10 percent 
political and I'll.

53
00:02:31,221 --> 00:02:35,490
I'll talk to the camera for a second for
this because everyday when they tell you

54
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:38,370
that Jordan's got angry white men,
right?

55
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:42,480
That's first off,
I would guess it's about 60 slash 40,

56
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:46,050
usually a male to female.
There are gay people.

57
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:48,090
There are black people,
white people,

58
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:51,720
Asian people.
There were Muslims last night and Jews.

59
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:53,610
I mean the whole thing.
All of that diversity.

60
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:55,110
That actually doesn't matter.

61
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,950
It's all there and they just.
They just consistently lie about it.

62
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,083
I think that it seems to me that the,
let's say the mainstream media types 

63
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:06,604
that have been pillaring me in various 
ways don't have a lexicon for dealing 

64
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:15,280
with a phenomena that's primarily 
psychological.

65
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,190
They have to make this fundamentally 
political,

66
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,710
the political aspects of it,
you know,

67
00:03:20,711 --> 00:03:24,460
and so far as I'm not a fan of the 
radical leftists for example.

68
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:26,260
And,
but by the way,

69
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,720
you had been slamming the radical right 
to.

70
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:29,554
I mean your whole thing.
I mean this is the irony of the 

71
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:34,150
situation is you talk about the identity
politics,

72
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,223
right?
And the danger of that as much almost 

73
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,610
onstage.
I don't like collecting this.

74
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,360
Yeah,
I think it's a bad route.

75
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,373
I think it takes us down a path and I 
think that in destiny of a tribal path 

76
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:49,900
is bloodshed and I don't care whether 
it's the west wing or the right.

77
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,003
I'm more perturbed about the left lane 
because of their dominance in the 

78
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:58,230
universities in particular and that's 
why,

79
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,040
you know,
the lots were lower this came from,

80
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,830
but it,
it's the collectivist issue that's the,

81
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,043
that's.
It has an almost everything that we've 

82
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:06,664
been talking about that I'm talking 
about with the audience is about the 

83
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,624
western tradition of individual 
responsibility essentially also not 

84
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:16,480
individual rights,
although they're part of the discussion.

85
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,703
It's funny to be,
but I would also say that in the 

86
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:21,424
collectivist lexical and there's no such
thing as free speech and there's really 

87
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:24,484
no such thing as individual 
responsibility and so in so far as I'm 

88
00:04:28,781 --> 00:04:30,790
able to make a case for that,
that makes me an enemy,

89
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,540
but even more importantly,
it takes the dialogue outside of their.

90
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,180
The way they frame the world.
They don't know what to do about it.

91
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,400
I don't know how to handle it,
so they invent an enemy essentially.

92
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,293
Right.
They don't really do the work 

93
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:43,803
intellectually to counter the arguments,
so they just do the same old thing we 

94
00:04:46,981 --> 00:04:50,700
were saying right before we started how,
what a year and a half ago.

95
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:51,840
We didn't even know each other.
You.

96
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,600
The first time we ever did anything 
together was,

97
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,290
I think it was November,
second of 2016,

98
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,090
which was a day or two before the 
American election.

99
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,340
It feels like a lifetime ago when we 
did,

100
00:05:02,341 --> 00:05:05,490
I just moved into my house,
I didn't know my studio yet and we did a

101
00:05:05,491 --> 00:05:06,324
little google hangout thing and the 
audio was terrible and the video is bad 

102
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,430
and you were telling me that the 
Pinocchio Story,

103
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:12,264
which now most of your audience knows 
about and you were getting teary eyed 

104
00:05:14,671 --> 00:05:17,520
and it and it ended and I thought,
I truly,

105
00:05:17,521 --> 00:05:18,780
I mean I've said this to you,
I was like,

106
00:05:18,781 --> 00:05:20,580
I don't know exactly what to make of 
this guy.

107
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,473
And then subsequently you came on my 
show many times and we've done a couple 

108
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:25,464
of hours together and we did the sit 
down with Shapiro and it's like every 

109
00:05:29,221 --> 00:05:31,590
month or two months this thing just 
levels up,

110
00:05:31,591 --> 00:05:34,680
levels up and it feels more real.
It feels more concrete.

111
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,620
And uh,
and we're all kind of growing together.

112
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,370
But I gotta tell you man,
we crossed 600,000 youtube subscribers.

113
00:05:41,371 --> 00:05:44,160
I think on the same day you got to like 
one point two.

114
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:46,520
Right now I'm,
I'm almost at $800.

115
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,100
So it stopped me a good sense.
I like competition.

116
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,110
I do like competition,
we do like that,

117
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,500
but it's just so cool watching this 
whole thing growing.

118
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:59,980
Luckily as as hundreds of millions of 
people come online,

119
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,530
we're not gonna run out of audience 
because there's another 2 billion people

120
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:04,364
to join,
to join the electronic web with enough 

121
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:09,070
bandwidth to start streaming videos.

122
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:09,903
So it looks to me like this whole online
video and audio and podcasts world is 

123
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:17,300
just getting its legs underneath it.
God only knows where it's gonna go.

124
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,223
Alright.
Well since we're a behind the scenes in 

125
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:20,324
the green room here,
let's just do a couple of behind the 

126
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:22,790
scenes things here.
First off,

127
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,773
just how you feel while doing this whole
thing on my health is improving very 

128
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:27,710
much.
I'm much,

129
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,573
much better than I was a month ago and 
in comparatively better than I was a 

130
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,750
year ago.
So yeah.

131
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:33,584
So that's really working out well.
I'm having a very nice time with the 

132
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:38,870
audiences.
They're unbelievably,

133
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:40,610
isn't it incredible.
I mean,

134
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,540
meeting these people like just literally
every.

135
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,790
We haven't had one protest or no,
uh,

136
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,590
just everywhere they're planning 
something in Portland.

137
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah.
Well,

138
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,220
we'll see about port credit or if it's 
gonna happen,

139
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,820
it's gonna happen,
it's gonna happen in Portland,

140
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:53,571
but being really,
you know,

141
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:55,220
every night after the show,
uh,

142
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,370
you meet a certain amount of people 
afterwards and I usually go out into the

143
00:06:58,371 --> 00:06:59,010
crowd.

144
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,080
Yeah,
there's hundreds,

145
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:02,120
sometimes thousands of people wait.
And it's like,

146
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,630
man,
they just want to hug you.

147
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:08,060
And a lot of hugs.
It's pretty vicious people.

148
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,530
Yeah.
Yeah.

149
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,700
It's a good thing.
You're not a Germaphobe.

150
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,440
Yeah.
Yeah.

151
00:07:12,441 --> 00:07:16,730
Well the other thing too is if,
if I'm protested enrichment or,

152
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,830
or Portland to any degree,
I'm going to videotape the lecture elite

153
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,703
and put it,
put it online and then people can see 

154
00:07:23,061 --> 00:07:24,890
what's being protested.
Yeah,

155
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,053
I think so.
I think that's the plan when we do 

156
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:29,420
these,
they've pretty much been different every

157
00:07:29,421 --> 00:07:30,254
single night.
I mean we've done about 15 shows and I 

158
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,770
mix it up a little bit every night,
you know,

159
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,820
and then a couple of jokes in there that
are the mainstays,

160
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,560
some lobsters stuff and the rest.
But you can dispatch the logs have to be

161
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,361
in there,
but.

162
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:42,194
But you pretty much,
I mean the hour and a half that you do 

163
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:45,140
and then especially when we do the q and
a after,

164
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:49,740
which is totally off the cuff,
you're kind of just going in and out and

165
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,100
sometimes you do three rules,
sometimes you do eight rules,

166
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:53,090
sometimes you know rules.

167
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,350
It's kind of amazing.
Yeah,

168
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,213
well I'm trying to develop a very large 
corpus of stories around each of the 

169
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:01,214
chapters and then I can mix and match 
them and I'm also trying to push the 

170
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:07,910
ideas that I've been developing in the 
book farther ahead with each talk.

171
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,253
And so I spent a lot of time talking 
about the relationship between 

172
00:08:12,231 --> 00:08:17,231
hierarchies and goals and and and 
difference in status.

173
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,903
That's been a,
that's been a main theme and the 

174
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:26,360
relationship between Truth and quality 
of existence.

175
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,540
That's another one that there's a very 
powerful positive relationship.

176
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,870
They're necessary and so on.
All of those themes,

177
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,173
you know,
there's no end to the amount you can 

178
00:08:34,851 --> 00:08:35,684
develop them.
And each venue gives me an opportunity 

179
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:38,744
to push it a little bit farther and 
clarify what I'm thinking and get the 

180
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:42,824
story a little bit tighter and see how 
the audience see how the individuals in 

181
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:47,090
the audience are reacting.

182
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:52,420
And so I liked the fact that you opened 
with some with a humorous intro and then

183
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,373
the q and a has an element of lightness 
and comedy in it because one of the 

184
00:08:57,601 --> 00:08:58,434
things I learned a long time ago was 
that even if you're dealing with 

185
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:04,740
something that's extremely serious,
if you can't do it with a comedic touch,

186
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,700
then you haven't got the balance right.
Even if it's deadly serious stuff.

187
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,780
They love it when you make them laugh 
sometimes accidentally.

188
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,640
Then like they're like,
they love that.

189
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,660
They really love it.
Yeah.

190
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,610
That's pretty cool.
Well,

191
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,950
you got to show today.
I do.

192
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:22,890
I guess I got to show to do.
To show you.

193
00:09:22,891 --> 00:09:25,530
All right guys.
That's Jordan Peterson.

194
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,960
I'm Deborah.
Would you tell these people to subscribe

195
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:30,600
to my channel?
Subscribe to Dave's damn channel.

196
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,920
Needs the subscribers falling far behind
it.

197
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:37,320
Not The bottom lobster.
Don't.

198
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,860
Don't make me the bottom line guys.
I guess he's the top lobster,

199
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:43,740
but can we look at second level lobster 
or something?

200
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,060
All right,
well it's good.

201
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:45,894
It's going to be fun tonight and we look
forward to seeing you guys were doing 

202
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:50,190
this through through July and then 
you're continuing into August.

203
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,330
Maybe September going to jump back in 
and September.

204
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:55,170
I'll job.
Good.

205
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,153
Good.
All right.

206
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,690
Awesome.
Great.

207
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,980
You Bet.
Thanks Johnny.
