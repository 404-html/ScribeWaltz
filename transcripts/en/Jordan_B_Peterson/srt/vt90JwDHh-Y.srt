1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:05,870
Okay,
so you know how I been telling you guys

2
00:00:06,211 --> 00:00:09,930
about the hierarchical model,
you know where the motor actions on the

3
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:14,931
bottom and then higher order abstract
conceptions at the top so you can be a

4
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:19,440
good person if you're a good parent,
you don't know how to take care of your

5
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:22,590
children.
If you can keep your house orderly and

6
00:00:22,591 --> 00:00:24,690
productivity.
If you can make dinner,

7
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:28,500
if you can set a table and so on,
all the way decomposed all the way down

8
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:29,580
to motor actions,
right?

9
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:33,270
So it brings you from the level of
abstract to the level of concrete.

10
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:35,130
Okay,
so now think about this,

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,000
so keep that in your mind first.
Now the second thing you want to keep in

12
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:42,960
your mind is the kind of models that we
were talking about a little bit last

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,200
week.
So they're the,

14
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,180
their expectancy models that were
derived from vinegar,

15
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,870
Nova and soca law and so forth and,
and,

16
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,691
and really,
you know,

17
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:53,520
finalized in some sense by great.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,860
Now,
what those models say fundamentally is

19
00:00:58,861 --> 00:01:03,861
that if you're moving towards a target,
a conservatory target,

20
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:09,210
which would be specified by hypothalamic
or other underlying motivational systems

21
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,470
or some combination of those,
sometimes it can be a higher order goal.

22
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,720
Then anything that occurs while you're
proceeding towards that goal,

23
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,110
that indicates that you're going to get
it or move closer to it,

24
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:25,440
produces positive emotion.
Okay?

25
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,090
And that's mediated by the hypothalamic
exploratory,

26
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,250
paused,
have an effect circuit that runs through

27
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:35,310
the nucleus accumbens,
and it basically runs on dopamine.

28
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:36,840
Okay?
So that's positive emotion.

29
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,050
Roughly speaking,
it's positive emotion in relationship to

30
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:43,680
incentive reward.
What happens if you attain the goal,

31
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:46,740
which is the consumer story.
Reward is it satisfies you,

32
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:52,250
and that's also a form of reward,
but it's not associated with as much

33
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:55,080
positive emotion,
it's more associated with

34
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,120
the lack of necessity to do that
anymore,

35
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,920
you know,
so you're done with that and that can be

36
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:06,660
satisfying and it does seem to be
motivated mediated by Serotonin,

37
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:10,200
which is basically a satiating agent
among its other properties.

38
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,600
Okay?
So that's on the positive emotion end of

39
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:14,210
things.
Um,

40
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,270
briefly,
an incentive reward is also equivalent

41
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:21,960
to a conditioned reward in classical
behavior theory,

42
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,840
so that's actually something you should
probably know,

43
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:27,720
but all talk about it a bit more because
you kind of need,

44
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:32,490
you need to know how behavior is theory
developed across time because behaviors,

45
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,500
theory has been incredibly instill is
incredibly influential in neuroscience,

46
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:40,800
especially in the real neuroscience,
which is almost always done with

47
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:42,720
animals.
So,

48
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,120
so that's one of the positive emotion
in.

49
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:50,150
Now let's go to the negative emotion.
And so now you're proceeding towards a

50
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:53,280
goal and something gets in your way.
Um,

51
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,740
you're walking across the carpet to go
to work and you step on a dog bone,

52
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,590
you know,
and that's maybe a little painful,

53
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:06,340
but we'll keep that apart from this
discussion for a moment.

54
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,140
It constitutes an impediment to your
progress forward,

55
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,990
or maybe your kid left,
uh,

56
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,060
you know,
like a piece of furniture in the

57
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:17,500
hallway,
that's a better example.

58
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,160
So it's a bit of an obstacle and when
you look at that,

59
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,400
then that's going to produce negative
emotion.

60
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,630
And the negative emotion is because
there's an obstacle in your path.

61
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,720
Now you might say,
how much negative emotion should you

62
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:33,970
experienced when you encounter an
obstacle?

63
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:38,410
And that's something that I don't
remember if I got,

64
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:42,310
if I assigned you guys the entropy paper
that I wrote with Jacob Hersch and

65
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:43,360
Raymond Martin,
but anyways,

66
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:45,820
we,
we took a long time to figure out how

67
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:49,630
you might calibrate how upset you should
get when something negative happens.

68
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:54,631
And what we realized fundamentally was
that it was proportional to the place in

69
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:59,530
the hierarchy where your goals were
disrupted.

70
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,080
You know,
so if you just have to make a minor

71
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:06,670
course correction by walking around,
the amount of upset you should get is

72
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:11,380
basically proportional to the amount of
extra energy that you have to expand

73
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,910
correcting your course.

74
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,990
And so a minor obstacle is just going
to,

75
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,370
you know,
produce a little bit of arousal and

76
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,010
stress.
Whereas if you go out to try to start

77
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:26,011
your car and it won't start well,
then that's gonna make you more upset,

78
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,080
experience more negative emotion.
You know?

79
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,600
And if,
if you read that you're,

80
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,770
the business you work in has just
collapsed because of the CEO was a

81
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:37,270
crook.
And now it's bankrupt,

82
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,320
that's going to cause you even more
distressed.

83
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,530
And the distress,
roughly speaking,

84
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:46,531
should be proportional to the level of
the hierarchy in your expectancy network

85
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,430
or desire network more accurately.
That's disrupted by the occurrence.

86
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,400
Okay?
So in that,

87
00:04:53,401 --> 00:04:54,820
that makes sense.
It's solid.

88
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:56,860
And then,
um,

89
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:01,900
you know,
then there's the special case of things

90
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,880
you don't know about,
you know,

91
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:04,740
so,
and,

92
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:06,610
and often when something gets in your
way,

93
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:10,210
the problem with what gets in your way
is you actually can't compute how much

94
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:12,280
time and energy it's going to take you
to fix it.

95
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,270
And so it's very hard to calibrate how
much negative emotion you're going to

96
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:18,460
feel under those circumstances,
right?

97
00:05:18,461 --> 00:05:19,900
Like the,
for example,

98
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:25,140
how anxious should you get if your car
quits working while they answered that

99
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:30,481
is you don't know.
And because maybe it'll never work

100
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:32,110
again,
you know,

101
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,300
and then it would depend on,
well,

102
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,220
you know,
do you have enough money to replace it?

103
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,000
And how much trouble will you run into
practically speaking,

104
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:43,870
if you use that money to replace it.
And then it might also depend on,

105
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:47,830
um,
your baseline levels of neuroticism

106
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,670
because what a neuroticism neuroticism
is,

107
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,460
it's the negative emotion factor in the
big five.

108
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:56,380
What neuroticism is,
is a,

109
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,650
it's a,
it's a,

110
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,920
it's a role of the genetic dice which
says that your body should output x

111
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:09,701
amount of physiological energy or
preparation for energy in response to x

112
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,170
amount of disruption.

113
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,240
And X varies,
right?

114
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,600
So imagine that.
Imagine you're calibrated for a

115
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:19,790
dangerous environment.
So on average,

116
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,290
the evolutionary design dice has
designed your genetic system so that

117
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:29,090
you're much more reactive to a normal
list or punishing things,

118
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:33,710
anomalous or threatening things more
accurately punishing as well than the

119
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:35,840
typical person might be.
Now,

120
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:36,620
you might say,
well,

121
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,320
is that right?
Is that wrong?

122
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:41,510
Is there something wrong with that?
It's like there's nothing wrong with

123
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:43,940
that at all.
If it turns out that on average,

124
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,450
the environment tends to be much more
dangerous than the typical human

125
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:49,340
environment.
You know,

126
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:53,270
now it might be kind of rough on you,
especially if you have a nervous system

127
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:56,930
that's high in neuroticism when you're
actually not at that much risk,

128
00:06:56,931 --> 00:06:59,990
roughly speaking.
Then there'd be a mismatch between the

129
00:06:59,991 --> 00:07:03,980
genetic roll of the dice and the average
safety of the environment.

130
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,960
And you know,
modern environments are pretty safe.

131
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:09,650
So we all worry about being anxious,
which is funny because we're anxious

132
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:14,210
about being anxious and the reason we
can afford to be anxious about being

133
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:18,890
anxious is because we actually don't
experience that many punishments

134
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:22,880
compared to what we might have
experienced 120 years ago.

135
00:07:22,881 --> 00:07:26,300
You know,
when the average daily income incorrect

136
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:29,990
to dollars for people in North America
was under a dollar a day,

137
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,610
you know,
that was hard.

138
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,220
So okay,
so anyways,

139
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:39,340
your neuroticism is one of the things
that that helps determine how much upset

140
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:43,460
you should experience per unit of
uncertainty or threat.

141
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:47,690
Okay.
Another thing is your status among other

142
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:49,970
people.
So you might think,

143
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:52,670
well,
what else should determine how anxious

144
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:54,680
you get when something you don't want
happens?

145
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:55,910
And you might say,
well,

146
00:07:55,911 --> 00:08:00,890
your competence and your competence,
roughly speaking should be how good on

147
00:08:00,891 --> 00:08:05,810
average are you compared to other people
at dealing with problems when they

148
00:08:05,811 --> 00:08:06,644
arise.

149
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,500
And so competence is actually one of the
more,

150
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,600
um,
what would you say?

151
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,080
Cognitive elements of what you might
call self esteem,

152
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,300
you know,
if it turns out that you're pretty good

153
00:08:17,301 --> 00:08:22,301
at problem solving or it turns out that
you actually have a very wide network of

154
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:25,730
social resources,
which basically boils down to the same

155
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:26,370
thing,
right?

156
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,460
It doesn't really matter if you can
solve a problem,

157
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,650
if you know someone who can solve the
problem.

158
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:36,100
So social network and intrinsic
computational resources are comparable

159
00:08:36,861 --> 00:08:39,110
phenomena.
And if you turn out to be a good problem

160
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:42,470
solver,
then on average you should be less upset

161
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:45,710
when something is upsetting than someone
who isn't a good problem solver.

162
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,900
Okay?
So that makes sense.

163
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:55,901
I presumed now here's something I've
been thinking for a long time and

164
00:08:55,951 --> 00:08:58,770
there's a lot of debate about this and
the relevant literature.

165
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,000
The terror management people,
for example,

166
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,930
they claim that people get anxious
because they're afraid of death.

167
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:09,960
Um,
you know,

168
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:14,130
at a psychological level,
it's lurking at the back of their minds

169
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:16,980
all the time.
It's an existential problem and I

170
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:21,150
suppose that's because death is one of
those threats that threatens you right

171
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,040
at the very top of your hierarchy,
right?

172
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,760
Good person and dead person don't go
well together.

173
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,240
So death threatens the entire hierarchy.
And so it's very anxiety provoking.

174
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,670
That seems quite reasonable as a
proposition.

175
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,390
Now the other thing that happens in the
terror management theorists,

176
00:09:39,391 --> 00:09:42,540
theories which are,
which are variants of the Freud Freud in

177
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,900
theories,
is that there's a further

178
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,140
claim made,
which is that

179
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,630
belief systems protect you against death
anxiety.

180
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:59,850
Now this is a complicated claim.
Partly it,

181
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:04,290
it,
it is extracted from Freud's observation

182
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:09,060
that religious systems are protective
against death anxiety.

183
00:10:09,061 --> 00:10:11,770
He actually thought they were neurotic
protections against dense,

184
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,390
that they have anxiety.
So it was sort of like,

185
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:19,430
like a primitive faith in the ability of
the father roughly speaking to solve the

186
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:23,760
problem and protect you.
So he thought it was a projection of the

187
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:28,290
infant tile world onto the broader world
and powerful critique.

188
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,390
I think sometimes it's true and the
death anxiety people,

189
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:37,560
the terror management people who
basically developed their theories from

190
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:42,561
a book by
the book's called the denial of death.

191
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,960
I'll remember the author in a moment

192
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,080
anyways.
It doesn't matter.

193
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:54,170
The theory was broadened out to to
propose that your belief systems as

194
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:58,320
such,
I provided you with that protection and

195
00:10:58,321 --> 00:11:00,450
then there was a bit of a variation of
that theory,

196
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:05,451
which was your vision of yourself as an
illusory climber upon value hierarchy

197
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,730
also protected you now exactly how it
protected you.

198
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:12,660
It was never really explained,
and I'm not taking issue with Becker.

199
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:13,860
Ernest Becker,
Becker,

200
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:16,050
who wrote the book.
Becker is a smart guy.

201
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,810
It's a great book.
It's dangerously wrong,

202
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,370
but it's.
But it's a great book.

203
00:11:20,371 --> 00:11:21,450
Well,
lots of great books.

204
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:22,284
You know,
they,

205
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,180
they're,
they're wrong and an extraordinarily

206
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:27,180
interesting way and that makes them.
That can make them a great book.

207
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:33,360
I think Becker's wrong because he
assumes that are all everything we do to

208
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:35,910
cope with death.
Anxiety is actually an illusion and I

209
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:38,550
think that's a terrible thing.
Terrible idea.

210
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,000
It's extraordinarily dangerous idea and
I also don't believe it's true for

211
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,430
reasons I'll talk to you about later
anyways,

212
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:49,431
you can sort of see that,
so then we can lay that on top of the

213
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,650
expectations theory in some sense,
right?

214
00:11:52,651 --> 00:11:57,280
Because basically what the expectancy
theory people do do like gray is they

215
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:58,450
assume,
okay,

216
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:03,970
novelty itself is both threatening and
incentive rewarding.

217
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:07,480
So it's threatening because God only
knows what might happen to you if you

218
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:12,100
run into something novel and it's.
It has an incentive reward element

219
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:13,810
because if you dig around in the
novelty,

220
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,800
you never know what sort of treasure you
might bring to the surface and so people

221
00:12:17,801 --> 00:12:22,120
have an ambivalent relationship with
novelty and I think you can actually

222
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:24,790
understand how that ambivalent
relationship works.

223
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,810
If you think about the hierarchy again,
so here's the,

224
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:34,300
here's the rough proposition.
If an enormously emerges at the lowest

225
00:12:34,301 --> 00:12:36,730
level,
the highest resolution level,

226
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,890
then it's sort of interesting.
You know,

227
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,240
so a baby might be playing with a fork
and you know,

228
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,030
find out that the forte makes a tinging
noise when he hits it on the table.

229
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,420
Now that doesn't terrify the baby.

230
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,660
It's funny though,
you know when you see babies on youtube

231
00:12:53,661 --> 00:12:56,470
now go absolutely pick it,
absolutely terrified if their mothers

232
00:12:56,471 --> 00:12:58,490
sneezes or sometimes if she laughs,
you know,

233
00:12:58,491 --> 00:13:01,310
so anyways,
but whatever for if the baby's sort of

234
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:04,100
mastered a fork,
then the fact that it makes a ticking

235
00:13:04,101 --> 00:13:08,210
noise is gonna make them curious and
that's an incentive reward phenomena

236
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,040
more than frightened,
you know,

237
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:12,890
it's going to depend to some degree on
the baby's level of neuroticism.

238
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,790
And it might also depend on how close
the baby is to the mother because it

239
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:21,710
actually turns out that maternal
proximity proximity more dilates the

240
00:13:21,711 --> 00:13:25,550
expression of negative emotion and
children and touch really does that by

241
00:13:25,551 --> 00:13:27,140
the way,
which is quite cool.

242
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:30,810
And that's that strict site that's
direct physical physiology touches

243
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,250
calming and it's also analgesic,
which is quite cool.

244
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:37,010
So it quells pain.
So okay,

245
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,950
so anyways,
the baby is making this ticking noise

246
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:42,290
and he finds that quite interesting
because it never happened before.

247
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:45,680
And so he's curious enough about it to
replicate it,

248
00:13:45,681 --> 00:13:50,090
to do it again and he's under the
control of his psychomotor approach

249
00:13:50,091 --> 00:13:52,290
systems.
And they mediate exploration as well,

250
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,020
positive promotion,
but

251
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,360
you know,
it's a great big dog comes bounding in,

252
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,270
well the dog has teeth and it's big and
it,

253
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,670
you know,
maybe it's got a deep bark and all that.

254
00:14:05,671 --> 00:14:10,671
So it's associated with,
with unexpected movement power and

255
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,010
predatory features.
Like you know,

256
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,640
lots of babies,
let's say toddlers will run and hide

257
00:14:18,641 --> 00:14:21,430
behind their mother that's a little bit
more novelty than they can really

258
00:14:21,431 --> 00:14:23,560
tolerate.
And so you might think that whether you

259
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:27,860
find something positive or negative when
it's a normal plus,

260
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,650
depends on how high up in the hierarchy
the threat apparently exists.

261
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,060
Okay?
Now here's another corollary.

262
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,820
Let's assume that before you build your
map of the world,

263
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,710
which you could think about as a map of
expectancy or you think about as a map

264
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:52,711
of desire or of how to fulfill desire.
Or You could think about it as a map of

265
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:58,640
how to organize your body and your
thoughts in the world so that when you

266
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,510
express that in the world,
the world delivers you what it wants.

267
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,510
And I think that's the most accurate
terminology.

268
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,170
Okay.
The,

269
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,083
the,
the,

270
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,380
the idea there is that as you build up
and differentiate this map,

271
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,851
you bring the,
uh,

272
00:15:13,851 --> 00:15:18,770
normally under control because you
reduce it from God only knows what it is

273
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:23,180
to something you can either use or
ignore and that regulates your nervous

274
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:28,181
system chronically.
So the a priori phenomena is novelty and

275
00:15:30,111 --> 00:15:34,910
that would be equivalent to the
phenomenologists thing that shines

276
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,744
forth.

277
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,990
Same idea,
completely different derivation,

278
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,530
and then you build a model that inhibits
it,

279
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:48,550
and the rule is the mortal inhibits it
as if when you act out the model,

280
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,030
it delivers what you want it to deliver,
which is kind of a form of pragmatism

281
00:15:53,031 --> 00:15:56,180
from a philosophical perspective.
So you understand that.

282
00:15:56,181 --> 00:16:01,181
So then the next proposition is that
model inhibits anxiety.

283
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,160
Okay?
Now you can see that that idea is akin

284
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:10,640
to the idea that your culture inhibits
death anxiety.

285
00:16:10,641 --> 00:16:15,290
Although I would say it's a more
delineated model and it explains,

286
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:20,270
it better be part of the problem with a
death anxiety idea is that first of all,

287
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:23,120
your culture is not in your head.
Right?

288
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,210
Where's your culture
and your beliefs there?

289
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:28,280
It's around you.
Yeah,

290
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:30,560
yeah,
so a big part of the culture,

291
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,410
the culture is the fact that you're all
sitting there,

292
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:37,850
you know,
basically clones of each other doing

293
00:16:37,851 --> 00:16:41,240
exactly the same thing in this room at
exactly the same time.

294
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:45,710
That's the damn culture and it means
that you can all ignore each other and

295
00:16:45,711 --> 00:16:49,400
concentrate on something else.
And so the culture is all like it's the

296
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:51,740
floor beneath your feet.
It's the ceiling over your head.

297
00:16:51,741 --> 00:16:53,270
It's the car you drive to work.
It's,

298
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,850
you know,
it's the traffic light system that

299
00:16:55,851 --> 00:17:00,140
pretty much everybody attends to.
So in some sense the matches,

300
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:05,170
the culture is actually the match
between the technologies and and webs of

301
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:10,940
comprehension that the individuals use
in the world and the world.

302
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,050
It's the match.
It's not the phenomena itself and it's

303
00:17:15,051 --> 00:17:17,420
certainly not only what you believe in
your head,

304
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,500
which is a little too much on the
psychoanalytic and it doesn't take into

305
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:26,070
account the pragmatics of culture,
which are the things we act out and the

306
00:17:26,071 --> 00:17:30,380
technological phenomena that exist and
the whole web of game,

307
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:32,900
like structures.
Those are all embedded in.

308
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,060
So that would be a of an idea,
right?

309
00:17:35,061 --> 00:17:40,040
All this stuff's organized and very much
high order games and as long as it works

310
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,670
the way you think will work in the
world.

311
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:47,270
So that keeps your anxiety under control
because there's no mismatch,

312
00:17:47,271 --> 00:17:50,910
but even better,
not only are you not afraid of death at

313
00:17:50,911 --> 00:17:51,661
every moment,
but yeah,

314
00:17:51,661 --> 00:17:55,770
actually don't die,
which is even better than not being

315
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:57,630
afraid of death,
right?

316
00:17:57,631 --> 00:18:01,260
Because you're not freezing to death in
here and there's no insurrection and the

317
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:03,750
probability that you're going to get run
over on the way home.

318
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,210
It's pretty damn low as long as you
follow the rules.

319
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:11,211
And so we should never remember that.
Culture is culture is not only

320
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:15,360
represented in the interior space,
it's not only beliefs,

321
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,180
its actions,
and we should also remember very,

322
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:21,000
very carefully that it's distributed in
the world.

323
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,100
Okay?
So back to the match mismatch idea.

324
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:31,310
So you've got this map of how your of
what effects your behaviors are going to

325
00:18:31,771 --> 00:18:33,330
have in the world when you implement
them,

326
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:38,040
and sometimes that match works,
in which case you're pretty happy

327
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:42,390
because that's an incentive reward.
You're moving towards your goal and it's

328
00:18:42,391 --> 00:18:44,220
happening.
Not only that,

329
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:47,730
and this is a secondary thing that the
behaviorists could never get a handle on

330
00:18:47,731 --> 00:18:50,940
because they didn't use hierarchical
representations in this way.

331
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,630
One of the advantages,
I mean,

332
00:18:54,631 --> 00:18:59,190
imagine that you're trying to pick
someone up and it's going pretty well.

333
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,170
Well,
there's two sources of reward there.

334
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:05,790
One is it's going pretty well.
The second is you're the sort of person

335
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,170
who in this situation can implement a
strategy that's going well,

336
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,810
right?
So not only is it a signal that you're

337
00:19:12,811 --> 00:19:15,660
making progress,
it's a signal that the structure that

338
00:19:15,661 --> 00:19:18,960
you're using to guide your actions and
your perceptions while you're making

339
00:19:18,961 --> 00:19:23,961
progress is working so it validates the
whole damn theory and you know that will

340
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:27,540
echo through your entire hierarchy of
presupposition.

341
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:31,650
It's especially true.
I used an amazing scenario because you

342
00:19:31,651 --> 00:19:35,550
know those are particularly relevant to
self esteem,

343
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,320
let's say,
which is a word that no one should ever

344
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:39,110
be allowed to use,
but will.

345
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,560
It's a word that we'll use in this
situation on the less so and it's hard

346
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:46,800
to tell exactly what's being reinforced
or reward.

347
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:50,910
Reward is feeling good.
Reinforcement is how the structures that

348
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:55,470
you're using to perceive and approach
what you're perceiving and approaching

349
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:58,680
are asked to grow.
Okay,

350
00:19:58,681 --> 00:20:01,590
so most of the time if,
if something happens that's rewarding,

351
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,730
what that means is the structures that
you have been using to bring about that

352
00:20:05,731 --> 00:20:08,820
outcome are actually cold.
To grow a bit,

353
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:13,080
gets stronger and Dopa means seems to do
that as well as making you feel good and

354
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:17,490
sometimes I wonder,
it's not exactly this because you can

355
00:20:17,491 --> 00:20:22,260
separate reward and reinforcement,
but sometimes I wonder if the goodness

356
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:27,261
of feeling isn't associated with the
thriving and flourishing of neural

357
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:28,571
tissue.
You know,

358
00:20:28,571 --> 00:20:32,880
it's like it's an invitation to grow
instead of die because if you're being

359
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:36,990
punished and threatened all the time,
then the systems that are leading you to

360
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,210
be in those situations do get
extinguished.

361
00:20:39,211 --> 00:20:42,150
Fundamentally.
They get starved of what gives them life

362
00:20:42,151 --> 00:20:46,020
and they wither away or are inhibited.
I don't think that's very pleasant.

363
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:53,910
Okay,
so you got your map and you got the

364
00:20:53,911 --> 00:20:58,911
world and you're acting out this map and
hopefully the match between your map of

365
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:05,031
the world is such that the Mac matches
the world and if it doesn't,

366
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:09,030
you get into normally and then the
anomaly can be of different sizes

367
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:14,430
proportionate to the hierarchy and then
your emotional response is proportionate

368
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:19,230
to where the anomaly seems to rest in
the hierarchy as well.

369
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,750
Subject to your own neuroticism,
say,

370
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,570
and your own competence,
which we could think of as somewhat

371
00:21:24,571 --> 00:21:26,340
separate phenomena.
Okay.

372
00:21:26,341 --> 00:21:31,341
So then you can say the reason that
people don't like other people who are

373
00:21:32,971 --> 00:21:37,971
foreigners say or different ethnicity or
who have different belief systems is

374
00:21:38,971 --> 00:21:42,330
because they appeared to challenge the
integrity of that map.

375
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:47,850
And so because their belief systems and
the way they act first of all aren't

376
00:21:47,851 --> 00:21:49,500
very well mapped by the map.

377
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,600
So you don't know what the hell those
people are up to,

378
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,820
you know,
and the differences may be much smaller

379
00:21:53,821 --> 00:21:55,170
than you think.
But what do you know?

380
00:21:55,171 --> 00:21:56,940
You don't know?
Um,

381
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,330
plus if their belief systems come with
them,

382
00:22:00,331 --> 00:22:04,140
which they will,
that has an indeterminant effect on the

383
00:22:04,141 --> 00:22:05,370
structure,
the map,

384
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:09,510
and it also has an indeterminant effect
on your position within the map.

385
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,050
And so then those theories,
and it's a part of that is the theory

386
00:22:13,051 --> 00:22:17,940
that I developed in the book called maps
of meaning that theory proposes at least

387
00:22:17,941 --> 00:22:22,941
in part that the reason that people
cling to their belief systems the way

388
00:22:23,611 --> 00:22:28,500
they do is because of their belief
systems are disrupted at a high level,

389
00:22:28,501 --> 00:22:30,420
low resolution level.
Just that the,

390
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,180
you know,
level of action or way the hell up the

391
00:22:33,181 --> 00:22:38,070
hierarchy in terms of the definition of
the good or what constitutes a redeemed

392
00:22:38,071 --> 00:22:39,660
person or something like that.

393
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,640
Then that brings out tremendous
disruption and then you'd expect to

394
00:22:44,641 --> 00:22:47,750
phenomena from that.
You'd expect that people would be afraid

395
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:51,360
say a foreigners are a strange ideas,
but also that they'd be kind of

396
00:22:51,361 --> 00:22:54,960
interested in them.
And I think generally our interactions

397
00:22:54,961 --> 00:22:59,580
with people who aren't like us generally
or we think aren't like us,

398
00:22:59,581 --> 00:23:04,581
whatever take place at a level where
it's more curiosity than fear.

399
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,830
I mean,
that would be almost the definition of a

400
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,470
of a sustainable tolerant society,
right?

401
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:14,250
Everything around you is functioning
well enough so that if someone comes

402
00:23:14,251 --> 00:23:17,160
along who's different in belief or
action,

403
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,590
they're not gonna.
You're not gonna.

404
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:24,570
Assume they're there a fatal threat to
the integrity of your hierarchy and fall

405
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:28,140
apart because of terror and curiosity.
Mostly tear.

406
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:31,590
Okay,
so now you can vary that theory a bit

407
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,510
and you can say,

408
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:41,640
wait a minute.
Maybe it's not just anxiety that gets

409
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:46,190
inhibited when your belief systems are
structured to some degree,

410
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:50,540
maybe it's more primordial.
Maybe what happens is that it's more

411
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:55,541
akin to the generalized stress response,
which seems to be a more primordial and

412
00:23:57,591 --> 00:24:02,591
global reaction to threat or anomaly,
and the generalized stress response

413
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,700
basically occurs or seems to occur when
the hippocampus.

414
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:12,110
So the hippocampus,
the map seems to be associated with the

415
00:24:12,111 --> 00:24:15,650
hippocampus in some way.
Now the hippocampus is also the part of

416
00:24:15,651 --> 00:24:20,480
the brain that takes what you're
observing and transforms Osho show short

417
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:24,260
term attention and transforms it into
medium to longterm memory.

418
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:29,030
So first of all,
the hippocampus keeps track of what it

419
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:32,720
is that you're seeing and then it stores
it there for awhile and then later it

420
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:36,560
integrates it into the generalized map
and so then the hippocampus seems to

421
00:24:36,561 --> 00:24:41,561
sort of stay at that nexus of the map
which is likely represented cortically

422
00:24:42,891 --> 00:24:46,130
to a large degree and what's actually
going on in the world.

423
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,710
So for example,
grades hypothesis,

424
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:53,270
roughly speaking is you're watching what
goes on in the world and the map is

425
00:24:53,271 --> 00:24:57,770
telling you what's supposed to happen
and then when something else happens,

426
00:24:57,771 --> 00:25:02,660
the hippocampus detects that that's a
mismatch and then somehow it makes you

427
00:25:02,661 --> 00:25:05,090
afraid.
Now here's how it seems to make you

428
00:25:05,091 --> 00:25:08,030
afraid.
This I don't think was really laid out

429
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:11,330
well until vinegar.
Dova discovered it when she was really

430
00:25:11,331 --> 00:25:13,790
old.
I mean she was doing most of her work in

431
00:25:13,791 --> 00:25:16,010
the early sixties,
but she laid this out.

432
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,840
I think it was in the early two
thousands.

433
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,440
What she showed was that,
okay,

434
00:25:21,441 --> 00:25:23,510
so you have this part in the bottom of
your,

435
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,750
of your nervous system way,
the hell down there called the reticular

436
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:28,760
activating system.
And it's old,

437
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,940
old,
and it's the thing upon which your sleep

438
00:25:31,941 --> 00:25:36,060
wake cycles dependent,
so and your consciousness without your

439
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,300
particular activating system is down.

440
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,140
It's like you're unplugged.
So if you have a car accident way back

441
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:44,750
here,
if you have a car accident and your head

442
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:49,610
twists enough to shear off the neural
projections from the reticular

443
00:25:49,611 --> 00:25:52,670
activating system,
you're in a permanent and irreversible

444
00:25:52,671 --> 00:25:55,070
coma.
It was pretty interesting a because it

445
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:58,130
means your consciousness depends on
something that's not new.

446
00:25:58,131 --> 00:26:01,070
Like you're relatively new,
like your cortical cap,

447
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:05,000
but something that's so damn old that it
was there before your whole brain.

448
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,090
So that's pretty weird.
Anyways,

449
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:14,080
what vinegar Dover proposed was that
the hippocampus,

450
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,960
the hippocampus decides that's what's
what's going on.

451
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,870
Roughly matches what you expect or what
you want,

452
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:25,640
which is more accurate than it tells the
reticular activating system not to be in

453
00:26:25,641 --> 00:26:29,180
a panic.
And then the reticular activating system

454
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,640
controlled.
We're going to assume it's on all the

455
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:33,920
time,
except when it's told to be off.

456
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,470
The hippocampus says you can more or
less stay off right now because

457
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,440
everything's going according to plan.
And then all of a sudden,

458
00:26:39,441 --> 00:26:41,360
poof,
things don't go according to plan.

459
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,960
The hippocampus tells,
the reticular re releases the reticular

460
00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:49,980
activating system from inhibition and
then the reticular activating system

461
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:55,190
wakes up all your sub cortical circuits
and that stress and so wake up would

462
00:26:56,251 --> 00:26:59,610
mean get afraid,
but it would also mean prepared to get

463
00:26:59,611 --> 00:27:02,880
the hell out of there.
So prepare to panic and then it might

464
00:27:02,881 --> 00:27:06,690
also mean ready other motivational
systems,

465
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,530
just in case they might be useful.
And then that also means shut off your

466
00:27:10,531 --> 00:27:12,510
immune system because who the hell cares
about that?

467
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:15,450
If you're being chased by a tiger,
you know and pull all the sugar out of

468
00:27:15,451 --> 00:27:18,260
your blood because you bloody well are
going to need the energy.

469
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:20,490
And so it's an emergency preparedness
state.

470
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:25,490
So then you could say that when you
encounter in a normally what happens is

471
00:27:27,031 --> 00:27:31,530
that your body generates an emergency
preparation state and the magnitude of

472
00:27:31,531 --> 00:27:36,531
that is proportional to your perception
of where the threat of what level the

473
00:27:37,111 --> 00:27:41,040
threat corresponds to in your map.
Okay,

474
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,320
got it.
Is that makes sense.

475
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,890
Okay.
So there's something wrong with that

476
00:27:46,891 --> 00:27:51,670
theory and that's very annoying because
it's a really good theory and,

477
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:54,960
and people have been coming at it from
all sorts of angles and it sort of

478
00:27:54,961 --> 00:27:59,400
matches the phenomenological ideas that
actually matches heidegger's thinking

479
00:27:59,401 --> 00:28:03,570
quite nicely and that it was derived as
far as I can tell virtually

480
00:28:03,571 --> 00:28:06,510
independently of heidegger.
And it goes along well with the

481
00:28:06,511 --> 00:28:09,960
neuroscience of anxiety and motivation
in general.

482
00:28:09,961 --> 00:28:13,890
Like it's a vicious theory.
But here's the problem.

483
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:24,770
So for a long time people debated about
who the hell was authoritarian,

484
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,100
you know,
because you could say after the Second

485
00:28:28,101 --> 00:28:30,950
World War,
most people assumed that all the damn

486
00:28:30,951 --> 00:28:32,810
authoritarians were on the right way.
Right?

487
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:36,350
They were the fascists.
And so you could say that's an

488
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,940
exaggeration of conservatism.
Get all that seems kind of reasonable.

489
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,770
But then people pointed out later,
well,

490
00:28:42,771 --> 00:28:44,810
yeah,
but let's not forget about the radical

491
00:28:44,811 --> 00:28:48,440
left wingers because by the time they
become communist dictators,

492
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,840
they seem pretty damn old press of an
intolerant to.

493
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,250
Alright.
So I would say we don't understand what

494
00:28:55,251 --> 00:28:59,270
happens when political systems get too
far in any direction,

495
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:04,690
but there are models which are in
development that basically indicate that

496
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:12,390
imagine this is agreeable list and this
is disagreeableness,

497
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,100
okay,
and you can think about them as a

498
00:29:14,101 --> 00:29:16,470
continuum,
but let's not do that.

499
00:29:16,471 --> 00:29:18,570
Let's twist them.
So they form a circle,

500
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,790
all right?
And then we'll say,

501
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:22,350
well,
how agreeable should you be?

502
00:29:22,351 --> 00:29:24,150
Well,
if you're disagreeable and this

503
00:29:24,151 --> 00:29:26,760
disagreeable things are going pretty
well for you.

504
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:29,760
It's a nice place to be.
But if you're this agreeable,

505
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,250
well then you turn into Freud's
devouring mother,

506
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:35,100
right?
You're so damn easy to get along with

507
00:29:35,101 --> 00:29:36,060
it.
It's okay.

508
00:29:36,061 --> 00:29:39,450
You just do everything for your child.
Absolutely everything forever.

509
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:42,850
And by that doing that,
you undermine their capabilities and

510
00:29:42,851 --> 00:29:44,910
they,
they remain locked in the eatables

511
00:29:44,911 --> 00:29:47,620
situation.
So that's like too much mercy and pity.

512
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,860
Or You could be like the tyrannical
father,

513
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:54,490
like the crumb brother's father who was
like completely disagreeable and

514
00:29:54,491 --> 00:29:57,250
extraordinarily punitive.
But the thing is it ends up in the same

515
00:29:57,251 --> 00:29:58,084
place.
It,

516
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,520
they both ended up in a variation of
hell.

517
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:05,730
And so these models seem to seem to
promote the idea that if you run any

518
00:30:05,741 --> 00:30:10,741
virtue too far,
it turns into a vice and all the vices

519
00:30:10,811 --> 00:30:14,350
have more common in each other with each
other than they do with everything else,

520
00:30:14,351 --> 00:30:18,460
with anything else.
So bad things are lumped together more

521
00:30:18,461 --> 00:30:23,200
because they're bad than they are by
what variant of bad they happen to be.

522
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,070
And we kind of know that because if,
you know,

523
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,520
when we developed the big five,

524
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,750
when people develop the big five because
it wasn't me,

525
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,200
they had,
they threw out all the,

526
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:37,850
uh,
evaluative words.

527
00:30:37,851 --> 00:30:40,570
That was the idea.
They threw out all the evaluative boards

528
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:45,290
like good and evil disappeared.
So anything that seemed to have a moral

529
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:49,130
overtone was arbitrarily thrown out.
Now there was actually some statistical

530
00:30:49,131 --> 00:30:52,100
reasons for that.
And the statistical reason is,

531
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:54,830
is if you just leave the good,
you know,

532
00:30:54,831 --> 00:30:57,770
the,
the adjectives that represent someone as

533
00:30:57,771 --> 00:31:01,730
good or the adjectives that represent
someone as evil.

534
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,760
If you leave those in the damn analysis,
then you get one whopping factor,

535
00:31:07,161 --> 00:31:09,140
which is something like good versus
evil.

536
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:13,060
And that's not that helpful.
Maybe anyways,

537
00:31:13,061 --> 00:31:17,390
so you throw all those things out so
they don't distort your,

538
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,540
your analysis,
and then that's when you get the five

539
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:22,010
factors revealing themselves.
So,

540
00:31:22,011 --> 00:31:24,020
but if you throw the pejorative items
back in,

541
00:31:24,021 --> 00:31:26,930
then you get this whopping single
dimension.

542
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,660
Now one of the things you should think
about that,

543
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:32,270
especially those of you who are going to
be researchers,

544
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:36,740
is the fact that the evaluative words
were thrown out of the big five

545
00:31:36,741 --> 00:31:40,280
adjective pool before the big five were
derived,

546
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:46,150
makes the correlation between the big
five factors and psychopathology much

547
00:31:47,301 --> 00:31:50,210
weaker than it would otherwise be.
Right?

548
00:31:50,211 --> 00:31:52,400
Because with psychopathology,
you know,

549
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:56,420
a lot of it can't be described without
roughly good versus evil.

550
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,870
You know,
it depends on the cycle,

551
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,980
pathological condition,
but if you're describing like

552
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,780
what murderous pedophilia,
you know,

553
00:32:05,781 --> 00:32:09,980
it's hard to use adjectives that aren't
loading pretty hard on the negative end

554
00:32:09,981 --> 00:32:12,310
of the adjective distribution.
You know,

555
00:32:12,311 --> 00:32:14,960
when that's the case with most
personality disorders,

556
00:32:14,961 --> 00:32:17,330
you know,
because there seems to be an element of

557
00:32:17,331 --> 00:32:22,200
misbehavior and many of them.
And so the big five isn't correlated all

558
00:32:22,201 --> 00:32:25,670
that strongly with most measures of say,
personality disorders,

559
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:29,270
but that's partly because all the words
that weren't correlate were thrown out

560
00:32:29,271 --> 00:32:32,390
before the analysis was done.
And so that's something you really,

561
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,400
really need to know.
Okay,

562
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:39,010
so
back one step,

563
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:43,550
because I said
that there's a.

564
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:46,550
That there's a problem with the theory
that I presented to you.

565
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:49,460
Here's the problem.

566
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,370
We're going to assume for the time
being,

567
00:32:54,371 --> 00:32:58,000
the easiest place to localize
authoritarianism is on the right hand

568
00:32:58,001 --> 00:32:59,230
end of the spectrum.
Okay,

569
00:32:59,231 --> 00:33:01,690
so we're going to think about fascism.
Roughly.

570
00:33:01,691 --> 00:33:05,710
Speak in.
I think that totalitarian governments

571
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,470
tend towards fascism whether they're
left or right wing,

572
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:11,050
but how to sort that out hasn't been
established yet.

573
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:16,080
We don't exactly know what makes left
wing authoritarian is like right wing

574
00:33:16,571 --> 00:33:18,160
authoritarian.
Something does,

575
00:33:18,161 --> 00:33:20,590
but we don't know.
So I'm going to ignore that for a moment

576
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,630
and I'm going to concentrate on the
right wing,

577
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,170
on the right wing side of the spectrum,
the conservative side of the spectrum.

578
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,630
Now we know some things about
conservatives.

579
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:33,340
They don't like foreigners that much.
They're pretty tradition heavy.

580
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:38,980
They tend to frown on non normal forms
of sexual interaction or even on many

581
00:33:40,091 --> 00:33:44,050
normal forms of sexual interaction.
They may not even be that happy about

582
00:33:44,051 --> 00:33:45,940
fun,
you know,

583
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:49,900
so you could say the conservative is
basically trying to destabilize society

584
00:33:49,901 --> 00:33:54,040
so that there isn't a lot that's
unpredictable that's going to go on or

585
00:33:54,041 --> 00:33:57,820
that's going to go on in the future and
so they're trying to maintain stability

586
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:02,290
and you can give them some credit for
that because it's the match between your

587
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:06,760
expectations and the way the world lays
itself out that basically inhibit your

588
00:34:06,761 --> 00:34:07,660
stress response.

589
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,980
So stability,
man,

590
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:14,930
it's something you probably can't
appreciate until you've had it's

591
00:34:14,931 --> 00:34:16,970
complete absence,
you know,

592
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,680
while the liberals,
you know,

593
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:19,850
their,
their position is.

594
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:20,684
Yeah,
yeah.

595
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,690
Stability.
The problem is stability gets old unless

596
00:34:23,691 --> 00:34:26,180
you keep updating it.
So you know you can't be,

597
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:30,620
you can't clamp too hard down on change
because if you do then the system gets

598
00:34:30,621 --> 00:34:33,540
stale and outdated and the stability
goes away anyway.

599
00:34:33,541 --> 00:34:37,220
So you go out to allow some change and
some exploration and some growth.

600
00:34:37,221 --> 00:34:40,880
And then the battle is between the
people who wants to ability and the

601
00:34:40,881 --> 00:34:43,730
people who want change and neither of
them is right.

602
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,680
It's the argument.
That's right,

603
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:47,990
right.
They got to keep arguing about it

604
00:34:47,991 --> 00:34:50,960
because whether we should be more stable
or more plastic,

605
00:34:50,961 --> 00:34:55,250
roughly speaking depends on the context
and the time.

606
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,300
And so that's something to think about
too because a lot of you are going,

607
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,650
most of your left wingers because you're
open,

608
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:06,660
you're open and that's a very big marker
of the proclivity towards left wing

609
00:35:06,661 --> 00:35:08,730
thinking.
And so you're all going to be thinking

610
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,770
that the left wingers are right,
but,

611
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:13,680
but it's,
it's a primitive attitude if your

612
00:35:13,681 --> 00:35:16,770
scientific.
Because really what seems to happen is

613
00:35:16,771 --> 00:35:20,730
that both attitudes are right and
they're both adapted to slightly

614
00:35:20,731 --> 00:35:25,650
different evolutionary conditions.
So there are variants of the damn big

615
00:35:25,651 --> 00:35:27,060
five,
those political beliefs.

616
00:35:27,061 --> 00:35:31,140
So liberal people are high in openness
and low in conscientiousness.

617
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,980
Whereas right wing people are low in
openness and high in conscientiousness.

618
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,260
And there's implications to that.
One is liberal start the companies for

619
00:35:40,261 --> 00:35:42,270
example,
but conservatives run them.

620
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,793
So

621
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,180
art artists settled territory and make
real estate values rise.

622
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:54,420
They're very open people,
but then the conservatives swoop in and

623
00:35:54,421 --> 00:35:56,650
monetize it,
which is kinda hard on artists,

624
00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:01,410
but my point is is that there's a
dynamic between these two positions that

625
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:06,000
has to be maintained dynamically in
order for the system to survive because

626
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:08,790
you need to stabilize the damn thing so
it doesn't fall apart,

627
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:12,360
but you have to keep it adapted to
continual change.

628
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,710
And the only way you can figure out how
much of that should be done on either

629
00:36:16,711 --> 00:36:20,970
side is to keep talking to the people
that you don't like because it's the

630
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:24,300
only way to figure it out.
So some people pull this way and some

631
00:36:24,301 --> 00:36:28,680
people pull the other way and we hope
that the middle of the polling basically

632
00:36:28,681 --> 00:36:33,681
matches the line of optimal progression.
So that's a much better way of thinking

633
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:35,520
about democracy.
Okay?

634
00:36:35,521 --> 00:36:38,100
Now,
so back to the problem.

635
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:43,310
Now
the problem is if you take this damn

636
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:50,161
model and you think about conservatives,
you're gonna think those people should

637
00:36:51,761 --> 00:36:54,610
be higher in neuroticism.
Like if that,

638
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:58,750
if their defining characteristic is
inability to tolerate it normally or one

639
00:36:58,751 --> 00:37:01,510
of their defining characteristics,
then you'd think,

640
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,610
well,
they should be more timid.

641
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,650
On average.
They should have more depression,

642
00:37:05,651 --> 00:37:09,010
they should be more anxious,
they should have more negative emotion

643
00:37:09,011 --> 00:37:09,890
in general,
so you'd.

644
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:13,330
You'd think you'd see some reflection of
that in neuroticism,

645
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:15,933
but you don't

646
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,620
at all.
In fact,

647
00:37:18,621 --> 00:37:21,500
liberals seemed to be a little more
neurotic than conservatives,

648
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:26,330
so and in fact the most neurotic people
seem to be male liberals,

649
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:28,940
so you think,
well,

650
00:37:28,941 --> 00:37:31,160
maybe you could salvage the old theory
because you could say,

651
00:37:31,161 --> 00:37:33,140
well,
the damn conservatives are so protected

652
00:37:33,141 --> 00:37:38,141
by the radiology that they mask their
underlying neuroticism so well that it

653
00:37:38,931 --> 00:37:42,050
actually reverses,
but if you're stupid theory can predict

654
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:45,980
the reverse of what it should predict,
then it's not a very good theory and so

655
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:50,510
you couldn't do that,
but you know you're pushing your luck at

656
00:37:50,511 --> 00:37:51,770
that point.
It's better to think,

657
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:53,270
hm,
something screwy here.

658
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:57,830
Something's not right.
Even though it's also conservatives

659
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,180
score higher in in wellbeing measures of
wellbeing,

660
00:38:02,181 --> 00:38:05,240
which is basically extroversion,
minus neuroticism,

661
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,720
something like that.
With maybe a bit of conscientiousness

662
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:12,470
thrown in and they're conscientious
behavior does tend to make their life

663
00:38:12,471 --> 00:38:16,100
turn out more stable across time so
they're less likely conscientious.

664
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:16,821
People,
for example,

665
00:38:16,821 --> 00:38:21,821
are less likely to get divorced.
So it's hard to reconcile the fact that

666
00:38:22,821 --> 00:38:27,020
those damn conservatives keep insisting
that they're not neurotic with the

667
00:38:27,021 --> 00:38:30,410
theories that predict well they have to
be because the reason they're so rigid,

668
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:33,530
especially if you've cranked their
beliefs over to the right is because

669
00:38:33,531 --> 00:38:36,480
they're afraid of foreigners,
new ideas and you know,

670
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:39,520
all the sorts of things that right
wingers are hypothetically afraid of,

671
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,860
but they're not.
And they actually seem to be like,

672
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:45,010
like I said,
they report that they're happier.

673
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,821
You know,
when you could say,

674
00:38:45,821 --> 00:38:46,840
well,
it's naive,

675
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:50,620
happiness and all that,
but you can't say those things after you

676
00:38:50,621 --> 00:38:51,730
make the finding.
Right?

677
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:54,820
Because you're explaining it away.
You have to predict the damn thing.

678
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:59,560
You can backfill your theory later.
Now,

679
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:02,620
however,
conservatives are higher than

680
00:39:02,621 --> 00:39:05,470
conscientiousness.
So you're saying,

681
00:39:05,471 --> 00:39:07,210
so what?
What the hell does that have to do with

682
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:09,280
emotional regulation?
You know,

683
00:39:09,281 --> 00:39:10,120
when you could say,
well,

684
00:39:10,121 --> 00:39:11,420
they make more.
They are there,

685
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:15,410
their lives are more stable,
so the external manifestations of the

686
00:39:15,411 --> 00:39:19,000
society that they encompass themselves
in are more stable,

687
00:39:19,001 --> 00:39:21,220
so there's not as much normally.
Okay,

688
00:39:21,221 --> 00:39:24,870
that's possible.
However now and that's,

689
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,560
that's possible.
And it may be even,

690
00:39:26,561 --> 00:39:27,394
it's part of it.

691
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:33,430
About seven years ago,
I did some work with one of my students,

692
00:39:33,431 --> 00:39:35,560
call Indian.
He did a lot of this.

693
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,250
Um,
I had recognized by that time that

694
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,840
the psychometric that the big five
needed to be psychometrically

695
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:49,841
differentiated or maybe more than it was
because at that point that the stage was

696
00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:52,550
basically,
there were the big five that usually

697
00:39:52,551 --> 00:39:57,551
measured by an instrument called the neo
or the neo pii or the Neil Pei revised.

698
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:02,420
You've got your five factors and then
each of them were broken down into what

699
00:40:02,421 --> 00:40:06,470
they called facet.
So they were sub sections of the each

700
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:09,350
trait.
But the problem with the damn facets as

701
00:40:09,351 --> 00:40:11,300
they weren't empirically derived,
you know,

702
00:40:11,301 --> 00:40:13,490
the factors were derived from factor
analysis.

703
00:40:13,491 --> 00:40:17,710
It's just more or less arbitrary
statistics or at least objective

704
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,660
statistics.
But then the facets where like a guess.

705
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:22,370
And we thought,
well,

706
00:40:22,371 --> 00:40:25,910
you know,
you can't rely on statistical reasoning

707
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,360
to formulate the major part of the
theory.

708
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:31,360
Then just gas sat the higher resolution
detail,

709
00:40:31,361 --> 00:40:36,361
so calling factor analyzed our data set
called the Ip Ip,

710
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:42,010
which is the international pool of
that's item pool in international

711
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,880
ip Ip,
I don't remember what it stands for.

712
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:50,180
A guy named Lou Goldberg put it up
online and he was one of the founders of

713
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:53,060
the big five theory,
the adjective form of the Big Five

714
00:40:53,061 --> 00:40:55,460
theory,
so Colin factor and analyze that very

715
00:40:55,461 --> 00:40:59,300
carefully and what he found in a
differentiated factor analysis was that

716
00:40:59,301 --> 00:41:03,620
you could take each of the big five and
you could break them weirdly enough into

717
00:41:03,621 --> 00:41:05,930
two.
So each of the big five had to.

718
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:10,931
So extroversion had enthusiasm and
assertiveness and then neuroticism had

719
00:41:11,931 --> 00:41:16,910
withdrawal and volatility and actually
there's some evidence showing that those

720
00:41:16,911 --> 00:41:20,180
actually have different neurological
underpinnings was quite cool.

721
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:25,840
Agreeableness factors out into
politeness and compassion and liberals

722
00:41:27,471 --> 00:41:30,020
are higher on compassion.
That's the bleeding heart.

723
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:33,110
Liberal and Conservatives are higher on
politeness.

724
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,170
If you mangled the two together,
you don't get any difference in

725
00:41:36,171 --> 00:41:38,660
agreeableness between the political
dimensions,

726
00:41:38,661 --> 00:41:41,630
but if you separate them,
then the liberals are compassionate and

727
00:41:41,631 --> 00:41:46,400
the Conservatives are polite and we
think that politeness may be the more

728
00:41:46,401 --> 00:41:48,870
conforming end of agreeableness,
you know,

729
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:49,860
so.
All right,

730
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,200
Nan,
openness.

731
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:52,940
This is a good one.

732
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:00,890
Roughly speaking,
openness seems to fragment into openness

733
00:42:00,891 --> 00:42:05,891
to experience and intellect and openness
to experience predicts whether you're

734
00:42:06,561 --> 00:42:11,120
going to take the humanities versus the
sciences and it's the factor that's most

735
00:42:11,121 --> 00:42:16,121
strongly associated with artistic
creativity and aesthetic sensibility and

736
00:42:16,881 --> 00:42:19,700
philosophy,
philosophical idiation and

737
00:42:19,701 --> 00:42:23,000
entrepreneurial ability because
entrepreneurs load with the bloody

738
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:25,010
artists,
which is pretty hard on your basic

739
00:42:25,011 --> 00:42:26,270
conservative capitalists,
right?

740
00:42:26,271 --> 00:42:27,650
Because they'd rather.
It wasn't that way,

741
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:31,970
but it does turn out that that's.
That's how it works out and then

742
00:42:31,971 --> 00:42:35,540
conscientiousness fragments into
industriousness,

743
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,780
which we do not understand at all
really.

744
00:42:38,781 --> 00:42:43,340
We just don't have no idea what that
trait is like.

745
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,070
Why do people work hard towards their
goals?

746
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:51,820
We can't find a single bloody laboratory
task that industrious people do better

747
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:56,210
than non industrious people.
Despite the fact that industriousness is

748
00:42:56,211 --> 00:42:59,270
an excellent predictor of longterm life
outcomes,

749
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,620
it's like,
what the hell?

750
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,110
You know,
we can't boil that down to a task in the

751
00:43:03,111 --> 00:43:05,330
lab.
We've had people do things like count

752
00:43:05,331 --> 00:43:06,620
ends,
ends,

753
00:43:06,621 --> 00:43:08,090
ams,
and use in many,

754
00:43:08,091 --> 00:43:12,800
many sentences a count the use Jesus.
You'd think that that would be something

755
00:43:12,801 --> 00:43:15,260
that an industrious conservative could
get right into,

756
00:43:15,261 --> 00:43:16,370
you know,
but no,

757
00:43:16,371 --> 00:43:20,900
there's no effect whatsoever.
We can find some things that industrious

758
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:24,740
and conscientious people do worse.
So we have lab tests where they do

759
00:43:24,741 --> 00:43:25,960
worse.
It's like

760
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:30,350
that's something but.
But anyways,

761
00:43:30,351 --> 00:43:33,350
it's a great mystery and I've been
trying to crack that for like six years

762
00:43:33,351 --> 00:43:38,090
with no success at all.
We keep getting industrious people to do

763
00:43:38,091 --> 00:43:42,770
things and they seem just as useless as
non industrious people even though we

764
00:43:42,771 --> 00:43:45,560
know that's not true.
It's a very good predictor of academic

765
00:43:45,561 --> 00:43:46,311
grades,
by the way.

766
00:43:46,311 --> 00:43:48,860
Conscientiousness,
and I'm sure it's the industrious

767
00:43:48,861 --> 00:43:51,080
component.
It's just about as powerful as Iq.

768
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,430
Oh yeah.
Openness,

769
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:58,210
creativity and ICU.
Intellect is roughly icu except the

770
00:43:58,731 --> 00:44:01,370
intellect measure of.
It's kind of bad because if I asked you

771
00:44:01,371 --> 00:44:03,650
how smart you are on a scale from one to
seven,

772
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:07,220
you'll tell me and that will correlate
with your Iq,

773
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:10,790
but Iq measures way more accurate than
how smart you think you are.

774
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,730
So that's a.
that's a cool division.

775
00:44:14,731 --> 00:44:17,790
That's very useful division.
Okay,

776
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:21,870
but on now on the conscientious and
we've got orderliness and industrious

777
00:44:21,871 --> 00:44:26,871
now turns out that the conservatives are
more orderly than the liberals.

778
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:31,590
Not more industrious.
Now that's now you think,

779
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,690
Ooh,
that's kind of cool because one of the

780
00:44:33,691 --> 00:44:36,120
things you might say about the Germans
for example,

781
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:40,680
is that they are orderly and you could
certainly say that about Hitler because

782
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:45,270
he was damn orderly and orderly.
People we know conscientiousness is

783
00:44:45,271 --> 00:44:48,750
associated with anti immigration
attitudes and,

784
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:53,990
and you know,
a moral stance against non normative

785
00:44:54,001 --> 00:44:59,001
forms of sexual behavior and,
but conscientious people all,

786
00:44:59,661 --> 00:45:03,870
she'll wash their hands more and their
standards of hygiene are better and they

787
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:06,750
are healthier.
So that's kind of interesting.

788
00:45:06,751 --> 00:45:07,251
You know,
that's,

789
00:45:07,251 --> 00:45:11,910
that's an unsettling lake because
there's these positive things that are

790
00:45:11,911 --> 00:45:13,830
associated with orderliness that,
you know,

791
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,950
are obviously positive.
But then there's these other things that

792
00:45:16,951 --> 00:45:21,240
seem to be associated with stigma or
stigmatism and,

793
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,910
and uh,
what,

794
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:24,853
what,
uh,

795
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:26,640
you know,
strong Ingroup,

796
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:30,450
outgroup divisions and derogation of the
outgroup and all the things that you

797
00:45:30,451 --> 00:45:34,740
might see going extraordinarily
pathologically in something like

798
00:45:34,741 --> 00:45:36,570
genocidal fascism,
for example.

799
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:40,770
Now,
when I was starting to sort this out,

800
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,280
I was reading Hitler's spontaneous talks
at the dinner table which were recorded

801
00:45:47,041 --> 00:45:50,310
over about a three year period.
And one of the things I came to realize

802
00:45:50,311 --> 00:45:53,880
was that he didn't really see him afraid
of Jews and Gypsies.

803
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,590
He seemed disgusted by them and
contemptuous of them,

804
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:01,800
which is not the same thing [inaudible]
discussed.

805
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:04,680
It doesn't load on neuroticism or not
very much.

806
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:08,640
It loads on orderliness.
And so that was a weird surprise because

807
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:11,010
we thought all the damn negative
emotions clumped together in

808
00:46:11,011 --> 00:46:13,590
neuroticism.
And that was that and the problem,

809
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:17,890
but discussed which,
which hadn't been studied very much load

810
00:46:17,891 --> 00:46:21,050
zone orderliness.
So then we thought hot,

811
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,420
we've got the biological basis of half
of conscientiousness.

812
00:46:24,421 --> 00:46:27,420
The biological basis is disgust,
sensitivity.

813
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:34,570
That hasn't been published yet.
Okay.

814
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:38,730
So I was thinking about that and then
Hitler washed his hands a lot.

815
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:42,990
He bathed four times a day and he was
also a real

816
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:48,660
worshiper of willpower and orderly.
People have strong willpower is one of

817
00:46:48,661 --> 00:46:51,270
the things about anorexic people you
know,

818
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:55,650
they're often anorexics are kind of
strange because they tend to be like

819
00:46:55,651 --> 00:46:57,780
high achieving women.
Fundamentally.

820
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,580
They're usually smart and they're
usually very,

821
00:46:59,581 --> 00:47:02,820
very dedicated and industrious.
But the other thing is they're orderly.

822
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:06,330
And so what seems to happen with the.
I told you this before with the

823
00:47:06,331 --> 00:47:11,160
anorexics is the disgust system goes off
the wires and it's too much happens with

824
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:14,730
obsessive compulsive disorder too,
which is usually classified as an

825
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:17,480
anxiety disorder but really doesn't seem
to be one.

826
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,810
Maybe it's also an anxiety disorder,
but mostly what people with ocd hate is

827
00:47:21,811 --> 00:47:22,920
to be contaminated.

828
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:28,170
So I had to know CD client once who she
had lost her husband and her children

829
00:47:28,171 --> 00:47:31,240
and everything and she in the hospital
and she'd actually gone so far as to

830
00:47:31,241 --> 00:47:36,241
build like a pseudo airlock on her house
so that her children and her husband

831
00:47:37,241 --> 00:47:40,180
would have to decontaminate themselves
before they entered the house,

832
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:41,181
you know,
so.

833
00:47:41,181 --> 00:47:43,900
And that was too much for her marriage
to sustain.

834
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:49,590
And whenever she was walking down the
hall at the hospital and the guys,

835
00:47:49,871 --> 00:47:52,480
the janitors walked by,
she flattened herself up against the

836
00:47:52,481 --> 00:47:53,314
wall,
you know,

837
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:55,360
and then she'd run off and wash your
hands.

838
00:47:55,361 --> 00:47:57,490
And if you're really OCD is really out
of control,

839
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:00,250
you wash your hands until the skin is
raw basically.

840
00:48:00,251 --> 00:48:03,730
Or until you run out of soap,
which you try running out of soap.

841
00:48:03,731 --> 00:48:07,300
When you're using a bar of soap,
you have to wash your hands a lot or you

842
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,460
shower until you run out of hot water.

843
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:12,520
You can't stop.
And so you're never cleaned enough.

844
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,760
And the,
I was doing exposure therapy with her,

845
00:48:15,761 --> 00:48:20,761
which means you have to sort of make the
person make contact with what they don't

846
00:48:20,921 --> 00:48:23,180
want to make contact with and you do it
step wise,

847
00:48:23,181 --> 00:48:25,320
like you just don't throw them into a
garbage can,

848
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:29,090
you know,
you have to get them to agree to,

849
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:31,450
to what degree they're willing to expose
themselves.

850
00:48:31,451 --> 00:48:35,680
And so this is what I could get her to
do if I took a garbage can that was new.

851
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:40,830
And I took a garbage bag that was new
and I put them over there and I gave her

852
00:48:41,381 --> 00:48:45,070
a pool cue.
She would touch the new garbage can with

853
00:48:45,071 --> 00:48:46,930
the new garbage bag,
with the pool cue.

854
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:49,630
That was the best she could do.
And even then,

855
00:48:49,631 --> 00:48:53,020
like I was talking to her perfectly
normal appearing person,

856
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,430
you know,
in,

857
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,370
in many respects touch whack.

858
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:59,510
Like she's,
she's going to that sake and she's going

859
00:48:59,511 --> 00:49:03,490
to wash your hands right now and you're
supposed to do re response prevention,

860
00:49:03,491 --> 00:49:05,530
which is why you don't get to wash your
hands.

861
00:49:05,531 --> 00:49:08,470
And so that turns out to be a very
awkward thing to do in the middle of a

862
00:49:08,471 --> 00:49:12,430
psychiatric ward because I was standing
there in the door trying not to let her

863
00:49:12,431 --> 00:49:14,950
get to the bathroom and she was wanting
to get to the bathroom.

864
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:17,710
So all the other psychiatric patients
came up and you know,

865
00:49:17,711 --> 00:49:21,790
they started accusing me of basically
being an authoritarian and interfering

866
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:24,070
with her rights and it's wall.
It's a weird thing,

867
00:49:24,071 --> 00:49:24,840
a,
because,

868
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:29,840
you know,
was she given me permission five minutes

869
00:49:30,341 --> 00:49:34,900
before when she was in the normal state
of mind and now she was retracting it.

870
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:37,330
So who the hell did I ever contract
with?

871
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:41,620
And the answer is her now,
because you can't sell yourself into

872
00:49:41,621 --> 00:49:44,080
slavery roughly speaking,
you don't have that.

873
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:47,170
Right?
So maybe I was interfering with their

874
00:49:47,171 --> 00:49:47,980
rights,
you know,

875
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:52,870
it's a tricky thing because
while she was hospitalized,

876
00:49:52,871 --> 00:49:55,410
so obviously something had gone wrong,
but anyways,

877
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:58,360
you get the picture.
So it gives you an example of how

878
00:49:58,361 --> 00:50:01,300
powerful contamination concern can be.
Okay.

879
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:05,230
Now then there was a paper published in
Plos one awhile back

880
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:12,790
looking at the prevalence of infectious
diseases in route in countries around

881
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:15,160
the world and then in provinces within
countries,

882
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:19,780
and then they measured the authoritarian
attitudes using an authoritarian

883
00:50:19,781 --> 00:50:24,610
attitudes scale logically enough and
what they found was the higher the

884
00:50:24,611 --> 00:50:27,770
prevalence of infectious diseases in the
geographical locale,

885
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:32,120
the more authoritarian people were
locally in their individual political

886
00:50:32,121 --> 00:50:34,880
attitudes and the correlation wasn't
point two,

887
00:50:34,881 --> 00:50:39,190
which is the general correlation between
a personality trait and some phenomena.

888
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:40,910
Point two,
point three,

889
00:50:40,911 --> 00:50:42,470
if you're really lucky,
point five,

890
00:50:42,471 --> 00:50:44,570
if it's ICU with that's the best he ever
get.

891
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:46,490
It was like point seven.
It's like,

892
00:50:46,491 --> 00:50:48,320
wow,
that's unbelievable.

893
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:52,310
It's something to do with contamination
and infection transmission,

894
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:56,420
and so then I was thinking this is
really annoying because this whole

895
00:50:57,020 --> 00:50:59,480
expectation theory,
it's beautiful.

896
00:50:59,481 --> 00:51:01,470
It's.
It works at a neurological level.

897
00:51:01,471 --> 00:51:04,910
It works at neuro psychological level.
You can understand it pharmacologically,

898
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:09,680
it makes conceptual sense.
You can see that it unites theories that

899
00:51:09,681 --> 00:51:11,570
were derived from all sorts of different
places.

900
00:51:11,571 --> 00:51:16,010
If it has all the classic elements of a
beautiful theory and and it's wrong,

901
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,050
and so then I thought,
all right,

902
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:21,710
what the hell,
its orderliness and discussed what is

903
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:24,950
going on there,
and the sticking point was I could

904
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:25,790
understand

905
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:32,660
how your brain could calculate how upset
it should get when you hit an anomaly by

906
00:51:33,541 --> 00:51:36,750
referring to this hierarchy.
That took me a long time to figure that

907
00:51:36,751 --> 00:51:40,140
out,
like 10 years probably to map that out

908
00:51:40,141 --> 00:51:40,890
and I thought,
okay,

909
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:44,790
and then you know how neurotic you are
and how high in esteem you're held by

910
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:46,200
your,
by your,

911
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:48,090
the people around you.
That's fine.

912
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,540
But then what does disgust do about
that?

913
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:57,780
Disgust doesn't seem to undo your damn
belief system.

914
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,610
You know,
like you can encounter something

915
00:51:59,611 --> 00:52:01,050
disgusting and you know,
you,

916
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:03,270
you may be revolted by it.
It's a very,

917
00:52:03,271 --> 00:52:05,640
very physiological sensation,
right?

918
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:09,570
Maybe I'll even throw up if it's,
if it's bad enough and maybe you'll be

919
00:52:09,571 --> 00:52:12,270
shocked to the point where you're damn
near traumatized,

920
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:14,730
you know,
and that's disgust related trauma,

921
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:18,900
which we don't really understand,
but you're not going to give up your

922
00:52:18,901 --> 00:52:21,360
damn beliefs.
Not Most of the time it doesn't seem to

923
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:25,380
represent a direct challenge to the
validity of your,

924
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:28,830
like Islam faith or Islamic faith or
something like that.

925
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:34,160
So what the hell is going on?
So then I was talking to one of my

926
00:52:34,331 --> 00:52:36,730
graduates,
there's graduate students this morning,

927
00:52:36,731 --> 00:52:39,700
we're trying to sort this out.
And I was thinking,

928
00:52:41,370 --> 00:52:42,520
okay,
what would happen?

929
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:44,320
Here's an experiment we're thinking
about running.

930
00:52:44,321 --> 00:52:45,940
So you,
you tell me what you think about this.

931
00:52:45,941 --> 00:52:46,774
So

932
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:52,630
we thought we would take people have a
different range of appearance,

933
00:52:52,631 --> 00:52:54,640
you know,
from really not so beautiful too,

934
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,740
quite attractive and different,
different races and different

935
00:52:59,741 --> 00:53:02,230
ethnicities.
And then we would announce the

936
00:53:02,231 --> 00:53:03,620
ethnicity,
you know,

937
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:07,300
Jewish Bang,
we'd show them a picture black,

938
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:11,560
show them a picture Caucasian Bank,
show them a picture and the pictures

939
00:53:11,561 --> 00:53:15,190
would vary in attractiveness.
But then what we're gonna do is we're

940
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:18,130
going to morph them with snakes and
rats.

941
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:21,130
So then you,
because you can take a morphing program,

942
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:22,120
right?
And you could,

943
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:26,120
I could make you like 10 percent snake
our percent wrapped.

944
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:29,250
You've seen that movies all the time.
And so then the question would be,

945
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:34,740
would you be more likely a to see an
unattractive person as a rat or a snake?

946
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:38,130
And B,
would you be more likely to see a person

947
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:41,670
who isn't a member of your ethnic and
racial group as a rat or a snake?

948
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:44,370
Ha.
Now that's interesting because the thing

949
00:53:44,371 --> 00:53:46,380
to do with rats and snakes is get rid of
them.

950
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:49,260
Right?
And that's a problem.

951
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,750
So,
and then we thought we would also

952
00:53:51,751 --> 00:53:54,600
measure how orderly people were to see
if that mediated,

953
00:53:54,601 --> 00:53:59,130
the degree to which they were willing to
perceive and be in place at perception.

954
00:53:59,131 --> 00:54:02,130
Fundamentally whether this person was
rat or snake.

955
00:54:02,131 --> 00:54:07,131
Like we've got some other experience
experiments that are of the same sort

956
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,050
device.
So I think that's a great experiment.

957
00:54:10,051 --> 00:54:12,030
I'm really curious.
And then we'd have people rate them.

958
00:54:12,031 --> 00:54:15,420
It's like how afraid are you of this
person?

959
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:19,680
How happy does this person make you
know how,

960
00:54:19,681 --> 00:54:20,820
how,
how,

961
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:23,310
how contemptuous are you have this
person,

962
00:54:23,311 --> 00:54:25,290
how disgusted are you by this person?
You know,

963
00:54:25,291 --> 00:54:29,670
a whole emotional response scale.
And hopefully what we would find is the

964
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:34,850
orderly people were more contemptuous
and disgusted but not more afraid by the

965
00:54:36,001 --> 00:54:40,590
morphed faces and they would be more
likely to categorize them as rat and

966
00:54:40,591 --> 00:54:43,290
snake,
like especially if they were from a

967
00:54:43,291 --> 00:54:48,180
different ethnic group or race.
So it's a scary experiment,

968
00:54:48,181 --> 00:54:50,890
but it would allow us to distinguish
between fear and,

969
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:52,590
and,
and contempt.

970
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:58,070
And then I was thinking,
well still why do the hell do you care?

971
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:04,700
Why is the disgusting so important?
What the hell does it have to do with

972
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:07,430
you?
And then I was remembering maybe,

973
00:55:07,431 --> 00:55:09,740
I don't know,
maybe this game doesn't even exist

974
00:55:09,741 --> 00:55:11,810
anymore because the world has changed,
but I bet it does.

975
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,700
When I was a little kid in like grade
one,

976
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:22,470
we used to play this game in school and
the game was,

977
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:25,170
I think on the simpsons they call it
cooties,

978
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:28,980
but we called it flees.
And so we'd play this recess and some

979
00:55:28,981 --> 00:55:32,280
person would have fleas and then they
would chase you around and they touched

980
00:55:32,281 --> 00:55:33,940
you.
And then you had fleas and everyone ran

981
00:55:33,950 --> 00:55:36,600
away from you.
And the game often start,

982
00:55:36,601 --> 00:55:40,530
sometimes it was just spontaneous,
but often the game could take a vicious

983
00:55:40,531 --> 00:55:43,860
twist and one of the lower status kids
in the room would get,

984
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:46,500
you know,
accused of having fleas and that just

985
00:55:46,501 --> 00:55:49,140
wouldn't be,
wouldn't be just a game that'd be a

986
00:55:49,141 --> 00:55:53,160
source of taunting and exclusion.
So how many of you can remember games

987
00:55:53,161 --> 00:55:55,380
like that?
Okay.

988
00:55:55,381 --> 00:55:56,100
Okay,
good,

989
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,750
good.
So that shows all this political

990
00:55:57,751 --> 00:56:00,660
correctness hasn't done a goddamn thing
to how children behave,

991
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:02,790
you know,
and actually that's a relief to me.

992
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:03,900
So.
Okay,

993
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:07,560
so then you think what the hell's going
on there?

994
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:11,730
And the first thing that's going out is
that the kids are playing out the idea

995
00:56:11,731 --> 00:56:14,280
of contamination,
right?

996
00:56:14,281 --> 00:56:17,460
So let's say your contempt dibble and
disgusting,

997
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,030
you know,
so maybe you,

998
00:56:19,050 --> 00:56:23,680
you have syphilis because you're a,
what do you call your,

999
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:24,514
uh,
your,

1000
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:27,200
your,
your dissolute and they botched and you

1001
00:56:27,201 --> 00:56:29,350
know,
it's gone to the final stage and it's

1002
00:56:29,351 --> 00:56:30,670
just horrific.

1003
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:36,140
So anybody who is going to look at you
is going to have a reaction like this.

1004
00:56:36,141 --> 00:56:36,711
They're,
you know,

1005
00:56:36,711 --> 00:56:39,170
they're gonna want to look away.
Okay?

1006
00:56:39,171 --> 00:56:40,070
So then I was thinking,

1007
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:43,910
what happens if you touch someone like
that?

1008
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:45,501
No,
no,

1009
00:56:45,501 --> 00:56:46,370
no.
Think about it.

1010
00:56:46,371 --> 00:56:47,540
Now,
think about it for a minute.

1011
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:48,650
Well,
first of all,

1012
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:50,960
in a place where there's lots of
infectious diseases,

1013
00:56:50,961 --> 00:56:54,260
what happens is then you die.
So that's not a good thing you know,

1014
00:56:54,261 --> 00:56:58,460
or if you're near anything corrupt like
a carcass that has been rotting,

1015
00:56:58,461 --> 00:57:01,850
you don't get to eat it because then you
die like you gotta be sensitive to

1016
00:57:01,851 --> 00:57:05,990
discussed because otherwise you'll run
into contamination and the contamination

1017
00:57:05,991 --> 00:57:09,890
will kill you.
The question is how contagious is

1018
00:57:09,891 --> 00:57:13,280
contamination?
And I think that's the issue.

1019
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:16,130
So now you've put yourself in this
position,

1020
00:57:16,131 --> 00:57:19,370
so you're on a dating site and you find
someone,

1021
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:24,410
and this might even be more powerful
initially for women than for men because

1022
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:28,820
I don't know if you know this,
but women rank 85 percent of men as

1023
00:57:28,821 --> 00:57:30,410
below average in attractiveness.

1024
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:33,170
Now men get the revenge.
Don't get me wrong,

1025
00:57:33,171 --> 00:57:37,430
I'm not trying to make a case that women
are more demanded when it comes to men

1026
00:57:37,431 --> 00:57:38,780
than men are.
When it comes to women.

1027
00:57:38,781 --> 00:57:40,580
It's just they're demented in different
ways.

1028
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:45,200
So.
So then you think it's interesting

1029
00:57:45,201 --> 00:57:47,150
because I've watched my daughter go
through tinder,

1030
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,440
you know,
it's sort of painful.

1031
00:57:48,441 --> 00:57:49,221
It's like,
nope,

1032
00:57:49,221 --> 00:57:49,761
nope,
don't,

1033
00:57:49,761 --> 00:57:50,241
don't,
don't.

1034
00:57:50,241 --> 00:57:50,721
Nope.
Nope,

1035
00:57:50,721 --> 00:57:51,531
nope.
And you know,

1036
00:57:51,531 --> 00:57:52,580
she's,
she's Kinda,

1037
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:55,550
she kinda thinks it's funny and I
suppose it is,

1038
00:57:55,551 --> 00:57:57,020
but it's cruel as hell,
right?

1039
00:57:57,021 --> 00:58:00,410
If all these poor we easily guys,
they're just getting sorted into the,

1040
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:03,320
you should not be in the damn meeting
pool pile.

1041
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:04,911
Right?
Right.

1042
00:58:04,911 --> 00:58:08,000
And that's a fundamental judgment.
You should not be in the meeting pool.

1043
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:12,860
Like if you're off on a genocidal spree,
that's exactly what you're trying to do.

1044
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,390
You're trying to prevent that.

1045
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:15,680
So,
you know,

1046
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:18,080
I'm not saying my daughter's got
genocidal tendencies,

1047
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:21,860
although she probably does because she
is human by the way.

1048
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:23,510
So.
Alright.

1049
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:28,810
So now
let's say that you've categorized some

1050
00:58:29,181 --> 00:58:33,320
person in there as you know,
you're not going to respond to their

1051
00:58:33,321 --> 00:58:38,321
damn email and you know,
you've put them down as a one out of 10,

1052
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:39,800
you know,
so no,

1053
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:43,580
no.
And then someone says you have to go out

1054
00:58:43,581 --> 00:58:45,140
with that person.
You have to act.

1055
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:48,080
Ask that person out and then you think,
well,

1056
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,390
how are you going to react to that,
that idea?

1057
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,090
Well,
the first thing is I think you're going

1058
00:58:52,091 --> 00:58:54,740
to be angry at the person who's going to
force you to do that.

1059
00:58:54,741 --> 00:58:59,030
It's going to be anger and then the
second thing is how are you going to

1060
00:58:59,031 --> 00:59:02,330
feel when you bring that person into
public with you,

1061
00:59:02,990 --> 00:59:05,180
around your friends?
Okay,

1062
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:08,330
how are you going to feel?
And the answer to that is

1063
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:13,930
you're going to feel disgusted and
ashamed and the reason for that is

1064
00:59:13,931 --> 00:59:18,770
because
it's.

1065
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,300
It's,
it's contaminating,

1066
00:59:20,301 --> 00:59:23,030
it's catching,
and so then that puts the damn theories

1067
00:59:23,031 --> 00:59:24,470
together and this is why

1068
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:31,410
if I forced you to go out with someone
that's low status and will say low

1069
00:59:31,631 --> 00:59:34,030
attractiveness,
we'll put the whole package together,

1070
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:37,180
low attractiveness,
low socioeconomic status,

1071
00:59:37,181 --> 00:59:40,060
no real hope for the future,
and really unlikable.

1072
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:42,670
We can put all those sorts of things
together and you're going to think no

1073
00:59:42,671 --> 00:59:45,340
way,
and then you bring that person out on a

1074
00:59:45,341 --> 00:59:47,530
date with all your friends and they
think,

1075
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:51,130
what the hell is up with you?
And so maybe you're an eight,

1076
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:54,490
roughly speaking,
and then you get to go visit five land

1077
00:59:54,491 --> 00:59:56,590
for awhile.
Okay,

1078
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:59,410
now what happens to you?
Now?

1079
00:59:59,411 --> 01:00:02,230
This is where it gets tricky.
So we know

1080
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:10,400
that you liked the lobster.
Have a counter way down in the bottom of

1081
01:00:10,401 --> 01:00:12,530
your brain that's really,
really old.

1082
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:15,440
It's pre-cognitive.
It's even pre emotional.

1083
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:18,770
It's way down there.
Our reticular activating level.

1084
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:23,690
And what it does is scan the world to
figure out where you are in the

1085
01:00:23,691 --> 01:00:27,200
hierarchy and it actually matters
because if you're low,

1086
01:00:27,201 --> 01:00:31,070
then you die or you're stressed or your
children die.

1087
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:32,260
You know,
and you,

1088
01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:34,520
you're,
everything's worrisome to you because

1089
01:00:34,521 --> 01:00:37,550
you're barely clinging onto the edge of
existence and you will only take

1090
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:42,020
impulsive pleasures because that's the
longest span that you can count on

1091
01:00:42,021 --> 01:00:47,021
having pleasures over and it's rough at
the bottom and you get low status mates

1092
01:00:47,571 --> 01:00:52,571
if you get any at all and it's not good.
So you actually do not want to be there.

1093
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:55,400
And there's a reason for that.
Whereas at the cop,

1094
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:56,600
it's like,
yes,

1095
01:00:56,601 --> 01:00:58,820
you know,
you get preferential access to

1096
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:00,140
everything,
everything.

1097
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:05,510
So it's better to be there and you can
say what you want about egalitarianism

1098
01:01:05,511 --> 01:01:07,880
and there's lots of arguments to be held
on both sides,

1099
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:12,110
but given a choice you will go up rather
than down.

1100
01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:19,930
So let's say you associate with someone
who's contaminated and it knocks your

1101
01:01:20,121 --> 01:01:22,010
status down.
Now how does it do that?

1102
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,510
Well,
it might do it a variety of ways.

1103
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:27,770
You feel bad about yourself.
So that would be low self esteem.

1104
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:31,460
So that means the part of your brain
that's evaluating you as a high status

1105
01:01:31,461 --> 01:01:35,780
competent being is now doubtful about
whether you actually fit that

1106
01:01:35,781 --> 01:01:38,180
description.
And then there's all your peers because

1107
01:01:38,181 --> 01:01:40,600
they're judging you like mad.
And what they're basically doing is

1108
01:01:40,601 --> 01:01:43,430
status evaluation.
Are you like a lowly,

1109
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:47,750
a crumb brother who's absolutely outside
the meeting hierarchy completely?

1110
01:01:47,751 --> 01:01:50,870
Or are you like Mr Vampire billionaire,
who's the,

1111
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:51,913
you know,
the,

1112
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:52,753
the,
uh,

1113
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:58,170
dawn linen vampire billionaire who's at
the pinnacle of generic female literary

1114
01:02:00,331 --> 01:02:02,670
pornography.
So that's basically the,

1115
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:07,820
the hierarchy.
So the problem is is that if you take a

1116
01:02:07,951 --> 01:02:09,030
dominance,
hit

1117
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:12,570
your serotonin level,
fall,

1118
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:18,240
what that does is increase your negative
emotion and decrease your positive

1119
01:02:18,241 --> 01:02:22,770
emotion and increase the probability
that when anything abnormal is so curves

1120
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:26,490
that you're going to have a generalized
stress response.

1121
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:29,280
So that's the connection between the
damn theories.

1122
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:32,550
If you're associated with the disgusting
your status falls.

1123
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:35,790
And that's what these stabilizes the
belief hierarchy.

1124
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:38,100
It's not a direct effect on belief.

1125
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:56,520
And that puts the problem in a
completely different light in many ways.

1126
01:02:56,521 --> 01:02:57,051
It's like,
what?

1127
01:02:57,051 --> 01:02:59,400
What the hell are you supposed to do
about that?

1128
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:01,590
Exactly.
Because it looks like

1129
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:09,390
there's no denying the fact that the top
of the bottom or top of the dominant

1130
01:03:09,391 --> 01:03:11,070
Turkey's a better place.
Oh,

1131
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:12,930
I got to put one more twist in that.

1132
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:17,480
So you know,
the,

1133
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:21,350
the terror management theories and
they're like basically say that it's

1134
01:03:21,351 --> 01:03:24,710
your belief system,
it stabilizes your emotions.

1135
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:27,980
And then you know,
I vary that a bit and said,

1136
01:03:27,981 --> 01:03:28,940
well,
wait a minute.

1137
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:32,270
It's your expectation,
desire,

1138
01:03:32,271 --> 01:03:36,830
hierarchy and the match between that in
the world that stabilizes your emotions.

1139
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:42,670
And that's partly because it does,
because you're not freezing to death or

1140
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:46,100
overheated or starving,
but also because you can sit in a room

1141
01:03:46,101 --> 01:03:49,250
like this with all the other conformance
to feel like no one's going to,

1142
01:03:49,550 --> 01:03:52,550
you know,
stand up screaming and become murderous,

1143
01:03:52,551 --> 01:03:54,800
which is a really good thing.
So,

1144
01:03:57,810 --> 01:04:02,810
but here's a twist.
The twist would be the degree to which

1145
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:08,180
the expectancy desire map regulates your
emotions and your general response.

1146
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:13,170
Your general stress response is
proportionate to your position in the

1147
01:04:13,171 --> 01:04:15,090
dominance hierarchy,
right?

1148
01:04:15,091 --> 01:04:20,091
So it's more dilated by the degree of
success that you have and that's an

1149
01:04:20,671 --> 01:04:25,410
important sale because it means the,
the integrity of your theory about the

1150
01:04:25,411 --> 01:04:30,411
world works better as well as that
theory of the world is in fact working

1151
01:04:30,841 --> 01:04:32,670
well for you,
which means you're near the top of the

1152
01:04:32,671 --> 01:04:34,980
dominance hierarchy.
And then it really regulates your

1153
01:04:34,981 --> 01:04:38,550
emotions as it should because the
environment is less dangerous for you.

1154
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:42,390
It's not psychological man.
If you're hiring the dominance

1155
01:04:42,391 --> 01:04:44,250
hierarchy,
even in Canada and you have someone

1156
01:04:44,251 --> 01:04:47,390
who's sick in your family,
they get to see the doctor a lot,

1157
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:51,570
long time before someone who has a low
Iq and no social connections and it's

1158
01:04:51,571 --> 01:04:53,480
not just corruption,
you know,

1159
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:55,920
there's an element of that who,
you know,

1160
01:04:56,100 --> 01:05:00,570
it's just successful conscientious
people who are open.

1161
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:04,890
They have access to all sorts of
strategies and plans and ways of

1162
01:05:04,891 --> 01:05:07,230
figuring out,
figuring things out that people who are

1163
01:05:07,231 --> 01:05:11,430
at the bottom of the dominant Turkey,
they just can't even muster.

1164
01:05:11,431 --> 01:05:14,760
Plus they're way more likely to be taken
seriously when they go see a doctor

1165
01:05:14,761 --> 01:05:16,050
because they're articulate,
you know,

1166
01:05:16,051 --> 01:05:18,850
so it's a big deal.
Okay,

1167
01:05:18,851 --> 01:05:23,851
so then we're saying the degree to which
your theory protects you from the world

1168
01:05:24,830 --> 01:05:29,110
and your theory and its incarnation in
the actual world is proportional to

1169
01:05:29,111 --> 01:05:30,460
where you are in the dominance
hierarchy.

1170
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:34,660
And so what that means is that if you
ever associate with anything or anyone

1171
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:38,330
that lowers your status,
you forfeit the protection of the

1172
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:42,610
associate cultural confines.
And the best way to do that is to

1173
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:46,210
associate yourself with someone who is
disgusting or contemptible.

1174
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:51,010
Now the next problem.
So I think I was thrilled about that

1175
01:05:51,011 --> 01:05:51,970
this morning.
I tell you,

1176
01:05:52,010 --> 01:05:54,700
because I've been trying to figure this
out for like six years.

1177
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:57,220
I was thinking,
how the hell do these things tied

1178
01:05:57,221 --> 01:05:58,500
together?
And I think,

1179
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:00,820
I don't think that's absolutely right,
but I think it's,

1180
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:04,330
it's pushing towards something that's
right.

1181
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:08,260
But then the problem that comes out of
that is what do you do about it?

1182
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,000
You know,
it's one,

1183
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,850
it's a real bind,
isn't it?

1184
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:16,540
Because you're just not going to get rid
of the damn hierarchies.

1185
01:06:16,541 --> 01:06:19,150
It's not even clear that you should,
partly because you know,

1186
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:21,760
you can be cynical like a postmodernist
and you can say,

1187
01:06:21,761 --> 01:06:24,580
well hierarchies are just based on
power,

1188
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:27,510
which is,
that's such a stupid theory that it's

1189
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:30,880
just painful.
Some hierarchies are based on power,

1190
01:06:30,881 --> 01:06:32,920
but lot of them are based on competence,
right?

1191
01:06:32,921 --> 01:06:36,250
In a functioning society it's like,
who do you want to do your brain

1192
01:06:36,251 --> 01:06:37,750
surgery?
You know,

1193
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:42,130
do you want to have the person who
really knows how to do brain surgery or

1194
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:43,840
do you want some person who's just,
you know,

1195
01:06:43,841 --> 01:06:45,910
sort of they're doing it as an amateur
in,

1196
01:06:45,911 --> 01:06:48,120
in the back alley,
you know,

1197
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:51,880
so you're going to assume that there's a
bloody hierarchy and that it's based on

1198
01:06:51,881 --> 01:06:55,900
competence and that you're going to peel
from the top and so they're going to be

1199
01:06:55,901 --> 01:06:58,690
more powerful obviously because they're
at the top of the hierarchy.

1200
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:01,300
But you're going to be pretty damn
thrilled about that when you're looking

1201
01:07:01,301 --> 01:07:03,670
for competence,
which you often are.

1202
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:06,190
And to think about all that is power.
It's like,

1203
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:08,680
you know,
really like live in the world.

1204
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:11,830
Some of its power,
but lots of it isn't so.

1205
01:07:12,370 --> 01:07:17,110
So if it's our proclivity to arrange
ourselves in dominance hierarchies and

1206
01:07:17,111 --> 01:07:22,111
our dislike of our associated anything
that looks contaminated in a disgusting

1207
01:07:24,431 --> 01:07:27,610
sort of way,
and the reason that,

1208
01:07:27,820 --> 01:07:31,510
that,
that'll lower are visible status in her

1209
01:07:31,511 --> 01:07:33,490
own eyes and in the eyes of other
people.

1210
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:35,860
How the hell do you get people to be
tolerant?

1211
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:40,070
You know?
And the thing is,

1212
01:07:40,071 --> 01:07:43,970
you're not tolerant and for all the talk
about egalitarianism,

1213
01:07:43,971 --> 01:07:48,971
I can tell you the egalitarian thing to
do is to date the next person who asks

1214
01:07:49,701 --> 01:07:54,020
you and you're not going to do that and
no bloody wonder.

1215
01:07:54,410 --> 01:07:56,540
So that's a big.
And you can talk around that all you

1216
01:07:56,541 --> 01:07:57,374
want,
but you know,

1217
01:07:57,500 --> 01:08:00,950
we know if you're going to be a
biologist about this sort of thing,

1218
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:03,620
which is useful.
I don't think you should only view

1219
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:07,160
people through biological lenses because
our biological lenses aren't very

1220
01:08:07,161 --> 01:08:10,100
sophisticated,
but you know it's pretty damn hard to

1221
01:08:10,101 --> 01:08:14,210
argue with the idea that you're
concerned roughly speaking with two

1222
01:08:14,211 --> 01:08:17,720
things and one is or not you survive.
And the other is whether or not your

1223
01:08:17,721 --> 01:08:21,200
progeny survive and thrive.
You know when you can just boil that

1224
01:08:21,201 --> 01:08:25,010
down to the desire to have healthy,
competent,

1225
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,450
beautiful,
attractive,

1226
01:08:26,451 --> 01:08:27,800
successful children.

1227
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:31,220
It's like,
is that a vice or a virtue?

1228
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:35,750
Well,
if you can't make that egalitarianism,

1229
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:38,810
like good luck with the rest of it.
It's like smoke and mirrors.

1230
01:08:38,811 --> 01:08:42,140
As far as I can tell,
you might be able to alleviate suffering

1231
01:08:42,141 --> 01:08:44,030
at the bottom of the dominance
hierarchy,

1232
01:08:44,210 --> 01:08:47,370
although even that's much more difficult
than you think because you know,

1233
01:08:47,371 --> 01:08:49,970
if you pump resources from the top to
the bottom,

1234
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:53,060
what happens is the resources fly right
up to the top again,

1235
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:54,163
you know,
it's almost,

1236
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:56,920
it's like it's like pumping water up
hill.

1237
01:08:57,580 --> 01:09:01,460
It's bad analogy because it's backwards,
but you're fighting against a very,

1238
01:09:01,461 --> 01:09:06,461
very powerful tendency for resources to
aggregate themselves into single

1239
01:09:06,591 --> 01:09:08,900
locations.
And I'll talk to you a lot about that

1240
01:09:08,901 --> 01:09:11,400
when we get to intelligence because it's
a,

1241
01:09:11,570 --> 01:09:15,420
it's like a bloody natural law.
It's really hard to fight against it.

1242
01:09:15,421 --> 01:09:19,400
And it's like that inequality is
characteristic of all societies.

1243
01:09:19,401 --> 01:09:23,510
Even egalitarian societies.
It's really hard to get rid of it and

1244
01:09:23,511 --> 01:09:25,490
you're not going to get rid of it in the
sexual world.

1245
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:26,773
That's for sure.

1246
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:32,820
So you know,
I thought about,

1247
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:36,330
I thought about,
and we've talked a lot about in this

1248
01:09:36,331 --> 01:09:38,430
class,
in the sections on phenomenology and

1249
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:41,610
existentialism and you know,
this idea that there's something

1250
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:45,770
redemptive about living in truth,
you know,

1251
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:50,790
and that that seems to protect people
against the worst elements of rigid and

1252
01:09:50,791 --> 01:09:54,540
judgmental dominance hierarchies.
And I think I think discussed can even

1253
01:09:54,541 --> 01:09:58,920
get more out of hand when you get
arrogant and superior,

1254
01:09:58,950 --> 01:10:01,440
you know,
and you're looking down on the

1255
01:10:01,441 --> 01:10:04,230
contemptible from a High Place of
narcissism.

1256
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:09,350
And so maybe part of living in truth
helps you not fall prey to that.

1257
01:10:10,230 --> 01:10:12,870
What narcissistic,
judgmental tendency,

1258
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:15,000
and that'll keep some of this under
control,

1259
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:19,980
but how to deal with the underlying
problem of,

1260
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:22,170
of disgust,
sensitivity.

1261
01:10:24,610 --> 01:10:26,140
What are you going to be?
Not Orderly.

1262
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:29,200
That's not helpful.
You know,

1263
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:32,440
now you know,
one thing that you might think about is

1264
01:10:32,441 --> 01:10:35,020
that compassion,
which is part of agreeableness might

1265
01:10:35,021 --> 01:10:38,530
moderate the judgmental tendency of
orderliness.

1266
01:10:38,531 --> 01:10:39,700
They're not opposites,
right?

1267
01:10:39,701 --> 01:10:43,030
Because they're on different dimensions
and that's kind of one of the liberal

1268
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:45,160
ideas.
Even though liberals are mostly high in

1269
01:10:45,161 --> 01:10:48,520
openness and low in orderliness,
they're also higher in compassion than

1270
01:10:48,521 --> 01:10:50,310
conservatives.
Conservatives,

1271
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:54,850
liberals debate a lot about the role of
compassion because the Conservatives

1272
01:10:54,851 --> 01:10:57,250
think you're just being a new mother,
you know,

1273
01:10:57,251 --> 01:10:59,110
and the Liberals think,
well,

1274
01:10:59,111 --> 01:11:03,100
you're just being a totalitarian father
and both of those things can and are

1275
01:11:03,101 --> 01:11:05,310
true,
but it seems to me that there's

1276
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:10,320
something about compassion that that
might serve at least to some degree as

1277
01:11:11,831 --> 01:11:16,500
an antidote for the pathological
elements of orderliness,

1278
01:11:16,501 --> 01:11:17,340
which include,
by the way,

1279
01:11:17,341 --> 01:11:20,280
conservatives,
especially the ordinary ones are also

1280
01:11:20,281 --> 01:11:25,281
much more judgemental.
So if you present to them someone who's

1281
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:30,450
committed a moral crime,
like careless prostitution,

1282
01:11:30,451 --> 01:11:35,160
say they will and you ask them how long
that person should be in prison,

1283
01:11:35,161 --> 01:11:38,160
then the orderly person will say that
they should be in prison longer than the

1284
01:11:38,161 --> 01:11:40,810
person who's disorderly.
And

1285
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:47,520
so then I guess the question is can
compassion mediate that without it

1286
01:11:48,130 --> 01:11:51,940
falling into like the hellish Friday
Anita Pool pit

1287
01:11:54,990 --> 01:11:55,621
now?
Anyways,

1288
01:11:55,621 --> 01:11:57,150
that's about as far as I've got with
that.

1289
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:03,260
So.
So I thought I'd tell you that because I

1290
01:12:07,151 --> 01:12:11,080
think it's worth knowing and because I
was too excited about it.

1291
01:12:11,081 --> 01:12:15,460
Not too so.
So we'll see you on Thursday.
