1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,990
Anyway,
okay,

2
00:00:00,991 --> 00:00:01,590
good,
good.

3
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,850
Let's go for it.
So,

4
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,950
jared,
you're going to bring us up to date.

5
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:07,561
Yeah.
So,

6
00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:09,840
uh,
obviously a lot's been happening since,

7
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:11,010
um,
since we,

8
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,980
we last spoke on this issue and um,
to some extent I guess,

9
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:18,463
um,
what surprised me was not the amount of 

10
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:21,774
lawyers and paralegals and licensees 
that have not only reached out but 

11
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:29,370
apparently written to the law society on
this statement of principles issue,

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,560
but more importantly,
the public.

13
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:33,030
I'm getting a lot of,
uh,

14
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,940
outreach from the general public and I 
mean,

15
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:36,840
you can look at the,
uh,

16
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:39,360
the comments on the youtube video that 
we put up.

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,793
The general public is concerned and they
are very much watching in terms of the 

18
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:44,990
legal,
uh,

19
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,440
uh,
actors,

20
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,660
lawyers,
paralegals.

21
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,010
Um,
they,

22
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:51,840
I understand there are a lot that have 
written,

23
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,580
um,
to the law society.

24
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:54,503
Uh,
the types of people that are reaching 

25
00:00:56,011 --> 00:00:57,450
out to me,
um,

26
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,330
are a broad cross section of the 
industry,

27
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:03,570
a very experienced lawyers,
a very,

28
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:05,610
um,
well established lawyers.

29
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,550
Constitutional scholars are,
uh,

30
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,413
are doing their thing,
but I'm also getting paralegals who a 

31
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,910
sense that there's a problem and they're
also writing.

32
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,823
One of the things that I think has been 
interesting through all of this is that 

33
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,370
the tone of the comments that I'm,
or the feedback I'm getting has migrated

34
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,430
in first instance.
It was a,

35
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,630
uh,
an issue with,

36
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,860
um,
okay.

37
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,151
Uh,
yes,

38
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:32,520
this compelled speech idea,
uh,

39
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:33,354
it sounds objectionable.
Those same people and some new people 

40
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:38,124
are beginning to reach out and the,
and the commentary is changing to some 

41
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:41,754
extent.
It is now that they're beginning to 

42
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:43,584
examine the underlying report itself and
they're coming to me with questions 

43
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:48,450
about,
well,

44
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:50,760
what does it mean that,
that the,

45
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,750
that there is systemic discrimination 
and racism within the legal industry.

46
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:59,320
And what's interesting is I've actually 
got racialized licensees that are big,

47
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,473
that are beginning to not only reach out
but also publicizing their opinions on 

48
00:02:04,561 --> 00:02:05,670
these things.
And,

49
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,520
and they're starting to grapple with 
that larger question of,

50
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,743
well,
what does it mean when our industry is 

51
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:16,401
systemically a discriminatory?
So people are becoming aware.

52
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:18,360
There's an awareness that's coming 
about.

53
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:19,690
And I think a lot of that has to do 
with,

54
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,620
with the media that's been coming out in
tandem with,

55
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,630
with what we did on,
on Youtube.

56
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,423
Yeah.
So the,

57
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,110
well in the problem with the systemic 
racism charges that while it's vague and

58
00:02:32,111 --> 00:02:32,944
that's for sure,
and then it targets everyone equally in 

59
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:40,120
some sense within the profession and 
requires systemic adjustment.

60
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:40,954
That's the other thing.
And obviously has to be supported with 

61
00:02:43,061 --> 00:02:43,894
hard data and it isn't self evident that
the data to support that claim is valid 

62
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,990
by,
I would say,

63
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:52,810
by any stretch of the scientific 
imagination.

64
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,940
So I've had a great deal of feedback as 
well from,

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,040
from both lawyers and the

66
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,540
general public and they are of a mind,
uh,

67
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,374
I think as a jared described about their
concerns over the forced speech aspects 

68
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,813
of this requirement.
I think we should make note of the kind 

69
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,600
of response that has been generated from
supporters of this policy in response to

70
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:24,580
the kinds of concerns that have been 
raised.

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,833
And a lot of those people who are 
insisting that this is a legitimate 

72
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:34,330
requirement are saying that although 
it's called a statement,

73
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,080
it is not forced speech,
it's simply governance conduct.

74
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,130
And if I might,
I'll just read out a quote attributed to

75
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:45,790
the treasurer on this question that 
appeared in the La Times.

76
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,253
Uh,
the treasurer was quoted as saying with 

77
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:50,974
respect to the statement of values,
this is a conduct obligation to 

78
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:57,214
recognize that we have to commit to 
these values and it's not a speech 

79
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:07,450
obligation or a thought obligation.
Now,

80
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:08,284
just on the face of it,
that statement seems strange to say the 

81
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:16,420
least to say that when we have to do is 
to commit.

82
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,870
And yet that's not either a thought 
proposition or a speech proposition even

83
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,410
have to commit in a statement that 
indicates that you have.

84
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,593
Right?
So it begs the question of what's the 

85
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,060
definition of commit?

86
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,420
Correct?
Yes.

87
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:37,070
And the way that they're portraying it 
is that this is simply a,

88
00:04:37,071 --> 00:04:38,110
uh,
uh,

89
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:39,123
an articulation of the obligations that 
lawyers already have in both the rules 

90
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:45,830
of professional conduct and,
and in the human rights code,

91
00:04:45,831 --> 00:04:48,020
which,
which is clearly not the case,

92
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:51,980
nowhere in the rules of professional 
conduct or in the human rights code.

93
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,400
Is there any obligation upon anyone to 
promote anything?

94
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,970
Well,
and also it's,

95
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,870
if,
if we,

96
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,713
if you already have that obligation and 
why is it necessary to add this 

97
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:03,490
additional layer of,
of,

98
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,210
let's call it obedience.
Yes.

99
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,113
Well,
let's just,

100
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,370
let's just note the,
the,

101
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,600
the two,
the two

102
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,860
contradictions in the portrayal of this.
On the one hand,

103
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:22,240
it is described as not a big deal.
Uh,

104
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,430
there are no immediate sanctions to 
follow.

105
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,320
You don't have to send the statement in,
you just have to write it.

106
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,910
You just have to put it in your own 
file.

107
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,410
So we're not worried about it.
It's,

108
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,453
it's,
it's,

109
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,190
it's no big thing.
Why are you so concerned about it?

110
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,880
And on the other hand,
they are emphasizing how central this is

111
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:39,940
to the project that they had set out.
And,

112
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,500
and,
and,

113
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,333
and there are many people who have 
suggested essentially that if you are 

114
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:45,644
not willing to do this statement and 
indicate your agreement with a certain 

115
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:50,984
set of values,
then you should not be allowed to be a 

116
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:55,220
lawyer and practice in Ontario.

117
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:55,901
Right?
Well,

118
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:59,810
that certainly seems to be the end game 
and my sense has been watching this,

119
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:00,644
that because of the public pressure,
they're backing off to some degree in 

120
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:05,024
their public statements by moving 
forward into the future at some 

121
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:10,304
indeterminate date,
the actual sanctions that will be 

122
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:12,884
applied.
So that right now from a public 

123
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:18,020
relations perspective,
it looks like this isn't a direct Konijn

124
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,580
a measure and we might as well also 
remind people that,

125
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,420
and they might wonder why I am here.
Um,

126
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,120
my concern when I first encountered this
was that I know

127
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:31,803
I know what that sinking feeling you get
when you can predict the future 

128
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:35,174
accurately and you don't like your 
prediction that if the law society 

129
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,783
prevails with this,
that the rest of the professional 

130
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:46,580
organizations in Canada will follow in 
lockstep very,

131
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:47,414
very rapidly and will end up in a 
situation where every professional in 

132
00:06:49,971 --> 00:06:50,804
Canada is required to panda statement of
Principles that are essentially I'm 

133
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,240
required by,
by their colleges espousing a particular

134
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:02,744
political and not only political but 
philosophical and worldview philosophy 

135
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,810
or risk losing their licenses.
And I mean,

136
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,160
I know in the legal,
in the law society already,

137
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:13,994
you have to.
There's a requirement that you have to 

138
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,010
undertake training in relationship to 
equity,

139
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,780
diversity and inclusivity,
right?

140
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:22,370
That's part of what they're requiring.

141
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,720
Well,
let's just read that out.

142
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:25,843
In this roster of recommendations,
that complication has passed his 

143
00:07:29,811 --> 00:07:34,811
recommendation and the third party 
recommendation nine reads as follows,

144
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,553
the law society will require each 
licensee to complete three hours of an 

145
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:43,004
accredited program focused on equality 
and inclusion with within the first 

146
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:47,594
three years following the adoption of 
the recommendations and one hour per 

147
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:53,090
year.
They're every year thereafter,

148
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,270
which will count towards professionalism
hours for that year.

149
00:07:56,271 --> 00:07:59,210
So in other words,
it is exactly as you've described,

150
00:07:59,240 --> 00:07:59,901
Jordan,
uh,

151
00:07:59,901 --> 00:08:00,734
there,
there will be training now so that you 

152
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,020
have the right attitude about these 
matters.

153
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,033
Right?
And I can just imagine what that 

154
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:09,470
training will be like.
So.

155
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:10,743
Well,
there was some commentary in the 

156
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,370
underlying report about unconscious bias
training.

157
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,421
And,
uh,

158
00:08:16,421 --> 00:08:17,161
and I know,
Jordan,

159
00:08:17,161 --> 00:08:17,994
that you've,
you've had some discussions about that 

160
00:08:19,121 --> 00:08:20,080
and some of your,
uh,

161
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,460
your public works.

162
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,441
Yeah.
Well,

163
00:08:22,441 --> 00:08:23,274
there is absolutely no evidence 
whatsoever that unconscious bias 

164
00:08:25,441 --> 00:08:27,990
training produces the results intended.
First of all,

165
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,720
the relationship between unconscious 
bias,

166
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:33,480
say as assessed by the implicit 
association test,

167
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,810
which is a pathological misuse of a 
psychological instrument.

168
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,733
Even the people who designed it have 
grudgingly admitted that there's a 

169
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,790
relationship between those implicit 
prejudice is so to speak,

170
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,530
which aren't even recognized universally
by psychologist as implicit prejudices.

171
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,470
The relationship between them in any 
case in behavior is very,

172
00:08:52,471 --> 00:08:56,460
very small.
It accounts for very overt behavior

173
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,563
and then the evidence that you can train
people out of those unconscious biases 

174
00:09:01,861 --> 00:09:05,070
is zero.
So this is,

175
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,370
this is a misuse of science and 
education at,

176
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,940
at every level from a scientific 
perspective.

177
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:12,774
It's the inappropriate politicization of
a very new line of inquiry in social 

178
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,010
psychology.
And if the people who designed the IAT,

179
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,230
in my estimation had an ounce of,
of,

180
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,300
of,
uh,

181
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,030
what would you say?
Intellectual Integrity,

182
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:27,864
they would denounce the misuse of their 
test because it doesn't fit the 

183
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:35,340
requirements that psychologists have 
laid down for validity or reliability.

184
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,500
And that's partly why it's not 
admissible in court,

185
00:09:37,501 --> 00:09:38,334
for example.

186
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,523
Well,
the committees that are selecting our 

187
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:45,710
judges currently are being put through 
unconscious bias training.

188
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:46,544
And so,
uh,

189
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,640
uh,
question,

190
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,210
um,
whether or not the law society will,

191
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,340
will heed the warning that you just put 
out there.

192
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:52,720
But yeah,

193
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,330
it's very unlikely,
and so you know,

194
00:09:55,331 --> 00:09:58,360
I've already decided that with regards 
to my clinical license,

195
00:09:58,361 --> 00:09:59,194
if I was required to undertake this kind
of reeducation program and to pen a 

196
00:10:03,361 --> 00:10:06,400
statement of principles of that sort,
that I just give up my license.

197
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,590
So the way I'm doing that.

198
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,100
So the public,
that's the one thing I wanted to let you

199
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:12,750
know is that you're not alone,
Jordan.

200
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:13,140
The,
the,

201
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,110
the,
the groundswell of public feedback that,

202
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,650
that I'm seeing and receiving directly 
into my office has been significant.

203
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,110
People recognize exactly what we talked 
about on the last video that,

204
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,233
that the legal industry and lawyers in 
particular are supposed to be that bull 

205
00:10:28,271 --> 00:10:33,271
work against this type of overreach.
And so they really very much.

206
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,583
There's a,
there's a large segment of the 

207
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:37,860
population that are worried.
They see that if the lawyers fall down,

208
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:38,940
then the rest will follow.

209
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,573
Can we just make a note of one argument 
that has been made in favor of the 

210
00:10:45,141 --> 00:10:45,974
statement with kids that lawyers are 
already subject to a set of ethical 

211
00:10:51,321 --> 00:10:56,321
obligations and this is just a one more 
an extension of the same kind of idea,

212
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,183
but there is a significant difference 
between the kind of ethical obligations 

213
00:11:01,491 --> 00:11:02,324
that exist,
which are essentially neutral non 

214
00:11:04,301 --> 00:11:05,134
political obligations that relate to the
way that our adversarial adjudication 

215
00:11:10,701 --> 00:11:12,290
system is supposed to work.
So it just,

216
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,124
for example,
every lawyer has an ethical obligation 

217
00:11:15,891 --> 00:11:16,724
to avoid a conflict of interest.
You can't represent both sides in a 

218
00:11:20,631 --> 00:11:21,464
dispute because that would be contrary 
to the way our adversarial system that 

219
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:26,060
is supposed to function.
That doesn't.

220
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:26,923
That doesn't make any sense.
You can't represent both sides in the 

221
00:11:28,461 --> 00:11:31,880
dispute,
but that ethical obligation doesn't have

222
00:11:31,881 --> 00:11:32,714
political content.
It doesn't matter whether you are a 

223
00:11:35,631 --> 00:11:36,464
socialist or a conservative or a 
classical liberal or anywhere on the 

224
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,040
political spectrum.
The the.

225
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,580
If you are functioning in this legal 
system,

226
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,890
it only makes logical sense that you 
must proceed without in the absence of a

227
00:11:51,891 --> 00:11:52,724
conflict of interest,
which is substantially different 

228
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:59,650
proposition than the proposition that 
these requirements are based on,

229
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:01,990
which are as,
as Jordan that you mentioned earlier,

230
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,273
these are politically charged and had 
substantive political content in them 

231
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,483
that they'd lost.
Society is essentially saying that 

232
00:12:09,731 --> 00:12:14,731
unless you adhere to a certain ideology 
that you are not fit to practice law.

233
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,420
No.
It's also an admission that this is,

234
00:12:19,421 --> 00:12:20,680
and this is,
I think the more,

235
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,753
perhaps even more dangerous element of 
this is that to undertake reeducation 

236
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:27,694
with regards to your political beliefs 
surrounding or even factual beliefs 

237
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:32,764
surrounding equity,
diversity and inclusivity is to act out 

238
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,473
by implication the fact that you need 
that reeducation because you're part of 

239
00:12:42,371 --> 00:12:45,760
the problem of systemic racism.
And you know,

240
00:12:45,761 --> 00:12:49,570
it's very.
It's very psychologically significant to

241
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:50,404
act out in admission of your guilt.
Because what happens is generally 

242
00:12:54,101 --> 00:12:54,934
speaking,
is that people then retroactively alter 

243
00:12:57,041 --> 00:13:01,720
their self images and start to wonder 
about such things.

244
00:13:01,721 --> 00:13:04,480
You know,
because they're either powereds for,

245
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,600
for going along with the um,
uh,

246
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,513
with the requirements are liars for 
producing a statement of principle that 

247
00:13:12,701 --> 00:13:13,534
they don't actually agree in or they 
start to tilt their beliefs in the 

248
00:13:16,451 --> 00:13:18,760
direction that's required by the 
demands.

249
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:20,620
And that's usually what happens.
And so,

250
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,490
and I'm quite convinced that the people 
who do this sort of thing who make these

251
00:13:24,491 --> 00:13:25,324
requirements know that and that it's a,
it's a manipulation on their part to 

252
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:34,230
tell political belief overtly.
And so it,

253
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:38,650
you can't act these things out without 
it having psychological consequences and

254
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,600
consequences.
Moral consequences,

255
00:13:40,601 --> 00:13:44,110
let's say.
So it's very intrusive.

256
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,660
The other thing,
bruce,

257
00:13:46,661 --> 00:13:50,050
it's important to remember is,
I mean the dichotomy between belief,

258
00:13:50,051 --> 00:13:53,920
thought and conduct.
Currently lawyers in Ontario are subject

259
00:13:53,921 --> 00:13:56,380
to the rules of professional conduct.
And,

260
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,490
and I,
uh,

261
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,623
right now we have an obligation to act 
in a certain way and to refrain from 

262
00:14:02,381 --> 00:14:03,214
acting in other ways.
And one of the rules of professional 

263
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:06,784
conduct is thou shall not discriminate.
And I don't think anybody would argue 

264
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:12,250
with that and that thou shall act in 
accordance with the,

265
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:14,340
with the human rights regime,
uh,

266
00:14:14,341 --> 00:14:16,870
and,
and associated codes across Canada.

267
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,913
Nobody could argue with that.
But this statement of principles is 

268
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,270
crossing the line into thought and 
opinion.

269
00:14:22,271 --> 00:14:23,104
And,
and one of the recommendations I would 

270
00:14:24,971 --> 00:14:26,650
note in the,
in the report,

271
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:30,970
recommendation number one,
they're actually proposing to review and

272
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:33,610
amend where appropriate,
the rules of professional conduct,

273
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,653
the paralegal rules of conduct and 
commentaries to reinforce the 

274
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:40,240
professional obligations of all 
licensees to recognize,

275
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:43,120
acknowledge and promote principles of 
equality,

276
00:14:43,121 --> 00:14:43,954
diversity and inclusion.
Now I find that fascinating because 

277
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:46,984
you're going to,
you're going to amend a rule of conduct 

278
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,050
to,
to include of a sudden a,

279
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:52,883
uh,
an affirmation of thought while end and 

280
00:14:56,191 --> 00:14:59,130
to insist upon promotion as well,
which is,

281
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,840
why do you say very ill defined?

282
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,210
Yes.
So,

283
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,043
let's,
let's just go back to the words just to 

284
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,880
make this point.
So again,

285
00:15:05,881 --> 00:15:07,860
I'm going back through a,
um,

286
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,240
a quote attributed to the treasurer and 
the La Times piece.

287
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,620
He says this,
uh,

288
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,780
the statement of values is an obligation
to promote equality,

289
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:18,060
diversity,
and inclusion generally,

290
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:22,290
which is nothing more than the 
obligation lawyers have already,

291
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,770
but when you go to the rules of 
professional conduct,

292
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,233
it says a lawyer has a special 
responsibility to respect the 

293
00:15:29,911 --> 00:15:30,744
requirements of human rights laws in 
force in Ontario and to honor the 

294
00:15:34,681 --> 00:15:39,390
obligation not to discriminate on the 
grounds of race as a place of origin,

295
00:15:39,391 --> 00:15:40,500
color,
etc. Etc.

296
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,630
That's Exactly as you just said,
jared.

297
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,493
This describes an obligation to observe 
the law and this law consists of 

298
00:15:49,591 --> 00:15:50,424
prohibitions.
That is the obligation that lawyers are 

299
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:55,230
under no doubt about it,
but they must do so,

300
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,303
but that does not include an obligation 
to endorse and it does not include an 

301
00:16:00,191 --> 00:16:01,230
obligation to promote.

302
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,563
RighT,
and we should also point out just in 

303
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:05,264
case it needs to be sad that none of the
three of us disagree with the idea that 

304
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:12,650
people shouldn't be discriminated 
against for reasons that have nothing to

305
00:16:12,651 --> 00:16:14,060
do with their competence.

306
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,530
Agreed.
Agreed.

307
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,383
This is about is not what this was about
and it might also be useful to talk for 

308
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:25,860
a moment.
Also about the word equality is equality

309
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,713
has two competing legal meanings and and
the law society has not defined which 

310
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,074
one of them they mean explicitly,
but it's clear by implication which one 

311
00:16:35,631 --> 00:16:36,464
they mean,
and the two choices are formal equality 

312
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,380
or substandard quality or quality of 
results,

313
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,393
and the two things are quite different.
Formal equality simply means that the 

314
00:16:46,221 --> 00:16:51,221
same rules of conduct apply to everybody
regardless of background of of wealth,

315
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,640
of lineage,
of heritage,

316
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,683
and so on.
Same rules apply to everybody in the 

317
00:16:58,941 --> 00:16:59,774
same way.
Equality of result means that everybody 

318
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:05,054
ends up in the same place and and note 
that these two ideas of equality are 

319
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:10,424
diametrically opposed and inconsistent 
with each other because if you have 

320
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,773
formal equality,
applying the same rules to everybody 

321
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,133
because everybody is different,
you're going to have different results 

322
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:21,403
for everybody.
If you insist upon the same results for 

323
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:24,464
everybody.
That means you need different rules for 

324
00:17:26,451 --> 00:17:28,520
everybody for them to end up in the same
place,

325
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:33,230
so you cannot have both formally quality
and substandard quality together.

326
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,500
And traditionally the rule of law has 
included the notion of formal equality.

327
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,120
If you have a properly functioning rule 
of law,

328
00:17:41,121 --> 00:17:41,954
that means you have the same rules 
applying to everybody without regard to 

329
00:17:45,141 --> 00:17:45,974
who they are

330
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,880
with equality of outcome,
which is now often termed equity,

331
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,043
is you can group people,
each individual in a multitude of 

332
00:17:55,981 --> 00:17:56,814
different ways and it's impossible to 
produce equality of outcome across all 

333
00:18:00,691 --> 00:18:02,550
those different dimensions of the 
comparison,

334
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:06,210
so it's a never ending struggle to 
produce equality of outcome.

335
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,073
It's technically impossible and and 
societies that have tried that have had 

336
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,333
a well,
it's been absolutely catastrophic and 

337
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,230
terribly divisive.

338
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:21,580
It is also contrary to that fundamental 
legal proposition that justice is blind.

339
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:22,963
Justice is supposed to be blind to all 
of those personal certain 

340
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,633
characteristics that one has,
whether it's race or color or gender or 

341
00:18:32,451 --> 00:18:35,680
wealth or background or lineage or or 
or,

342
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,000
or political connection.
Whatever it happens to be,

343
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:43,060
a properly functioning judicial system 
doesn't take account of who you are.

344
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,533
It simply takes account of the rules 
that exist and tries to ensure that the 

345
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,220
rules,
those rules are,

346
00:18:49,221 --> 00:18:50,054
are,
are enforced equally in the same way 

347
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,140
with an even hand against everybody.

348
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,210
And The so called,
well,

349
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,840
the data that has been generated is also
predicated on the implicit acceptance of

350
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:03,660
inequality of outcome,
a doctrine,

351
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:04,523
because the fact that every group isn't 
equally represented at outcome is the 

352
00:19:10,531 --> 00:19:13,830
data point that's being used to indicate
systemic racism.

353
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:15,900
And so the,
uh,

354
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,430
so then you also think,
well,

355
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,700
what if you,
what if you're in a situation where as a

356
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:23,220
professional and an informed 
professional,

357
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:27,750
you don't agree with the,
with the conclusions drawn from the data

358
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:28,584
set,
that there is indication of systemic 

359
00:19:30,391 --> 00:19:33,990
racism means is that now a belief that 
you don't get to have?

360
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,853
Because if you are forced to write this 
statement of principles and alter your 

361
00:19:38,281 --> 00:19:39,114
conduct,
then you're acting out the proposition 

362
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:41,874
that you accept the conclusion that the 
reason there are some differences in 

363
00:19:45,061 --> 00:19:45,894
representation across groups is because 
the enterprise is the whole legal 

364
00:19:49,591 --> 00:19:52,710
enterprise is systemically racist and 
they're buying.

365
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,573
You're also there by admitting your own 
culpability in relationship to that and 

366
00:19:57,961 --> 00:20:00,030
the corruption of the entire legal 
system.

367
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,283
It seems to me that you shouldn't be 
required to admit to that if you don't 

368
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:05,933
agree with it.

369
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,870
And that's the arc of the commentary,
as I mentioned at the outset,

370
00:20:09,871 --> 00:20:14,250
is that it started in one place and the 
feedback I'm getting now is very much in

371
00:20:14,251 --> 00:20:17,040
that place that people are beginning to 
question,

372
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,630
okay,
what does it mean,

373
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,913
uh,
the findings of this report for me 

374
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:23,810
personally and for my industry?
And,

375
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,760
and what does the data say?
And people are digging down on it.

376
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:27,594
In fact,
I just read an article the other day 

377
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,833
that said that there's actually been a 
doubling in the representation of 

378
00:20:32,911 --> 00:20:35,010
racialized licensees within the 
industry,

379
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,740
uh,
between 2011 and 2014.

380
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:38,950
Um,
you know,

381
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,790
that's not something I think a lot of 
people recognize is that,

382
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,470
yes,
well,

383
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,980
the report may may have touched on 
something in terms of findings.

384
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,360
Um,
there's also,

385
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,840
uh,
some things to celebrate.

386
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:54,160
The other thing too is that you have to 
specify it in a report like that.

387
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:54,994
If you're going to consider this 
something approximating a scientific 

388
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:58,803
investigation which you and it wasn't 
conducted in a manner that would meet 

389
00:21:01,481 --> 00:21:03,160
those requirements,
in my estimation,

390
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:03,994
that there's going to be a lag in ethnic
representation as the population 

391
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:08,374
demographics change because the 
demographics of the population from 

392
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:12,214
immigration are going to change more 
rapidly than the the than a than a 

393
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,343
representation of people in the 
professions just because of the 

394
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:26,050
necessity for the new immigrants to take
time to be incorporated into the culture

395
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:26,884
and so the real point of data should 
have been the rate at which new comers 

396
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:32,624
are being integrated into the profession
rather than the absolute numbers of 

397
00:21:36,281 --> 00:21:37,114
people who are there already and that's 
self evident and so the fact that that 

398
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:41,944
isn't being considered deeply in the in 
the data is also indicative in my 

399
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:46,534
opinion,
of the political slapped of the 

400
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:51,400
interpretative framework through which 
the data was analyzed.

401
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,013
We'll make noTe of the irony of the way 
that the word diversity is being used 

402
00:22:00,571 --> 00:22:05,250
and the means by which are being used to
promote diversity.

403
00:22:05,251 --> 00:22:06,084
because in a sense,
I'm the objectives of these 

404
00:22:09,301 --> 00:22:11,700
recommendations is the opposite of 
diversity,

405
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:15,180
real diversity,
genuine deep diversity is diverse,

406
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:18,000
includes diversity of thought,
diversity of opinion,

407
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,240
diversity of worldview,
diversity of ideology,

408
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:25,410
including all the other issues of 
diversity and diversity is a very,

409
00:22:25,411 --> 00:22:28,080
very important thing for a pluralistic 
society.

410
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,070
You don't have diversity in a 
pluralistic society,

411
00:22:32,071 --> 00:22:32,904
then you,
you must be living under some kind of 

412
00:22:34,681 --> 00:22:35,514
tyranny because everybody is different 
and everybody deserves to be allowed to 

413
00:22:39,751 --> 00:22:40,584
be different than to think different 
things and to behave in different ways 

414
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,390
as long as they don't encroach upon the 
rights of other people.

415
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,620
But,
um,

416
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,010
but the,
the vision that seems to ally underneath

417
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:55,040
these provisions is a very singular one,
a vision that everybody will think and,

418
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,133
and adopt progressive values that a 
proper law firm consists of a group of 

419
00:23:02,401 --> 00:23:04,930
progressively thinking lawyers,
uh,

420
00:23:04,931 --> 00:23:06,360
that,
that looked like a rainbow,

421
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,520
um,
as opposed to.

422
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:09,140
So there's,

423
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,770
there's an appalling proposition 
underneath that tooth.

424
00:23:11,771 --> 00:23:16,190
It's actually factually incorrect.
So the fundamental racist proposition is

425
00:23:16,191 --> 00:23:17,024
that racial groups differ sufficiently 
so that you can identify them as 

426
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:23,840
separate entities and that they should 
be treated in that manner,

427
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,320
but the data suggests very strongly that
even in situations where men and women,

428
00:23:29,661 --> 00:23:31,210
different temperament,
um,

429
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,113
on average,
that the overlap between men and women 

430
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:38,180
is larger than the differences and the 
differences within the groups.

431
00:23:38,181 --> 00:23:42,320
So the differences between women and the
differences between men within their own

432
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:45,620
groups are larger than the differences 
between and women.

433
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,083
So you don't get true diversity by 
selecting across groups that isn't how 

434
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:51,440
it works.
In fact,

435
00:23:51,441 --> 00:23:56,441
that's actually a fundamentally racist 
or sexist claim right down to the core.

436
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:02,170
And to predicate to assume that what you
get is diversity of opinion by selecting

437
00:24:02,781 --> 00:24:03,920
for diversity,
let's say,

438
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:04,820
of race is.

439
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,560
Well,
first of all it's wrong.

440
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,680
It's just technically incorrect.
And second,

441
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:13,230
I don't see how that's distinguishable 
from the claims of the jim crow type.

442
00:24:13,231 --> 00:24:15,050
So the 19 fifties who said,
well,

443
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,123
you know,
black people and white people are so 

444
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:19,220
different that they should remain 
segregated.

445
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:22,160
It's like they're not that different.
so,

446
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,740
and,
but within the groups,

447
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:26,450
they're very different,
but between the groups,

448
00:24:26,451 --> 00:24:28,850
they're not that much different.
The differences aren't,

449
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:33,440
aren't like the differences between men 
and women aren't nonexistent,

450
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,513
but even then you wouldn't select on the
basis of those differences to produce 

451
00:24:37,551 --> 00:24:39,930
diversity of opinion.
So yeah,

452
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,990
but it's not the diversity of thought 
model that,

453
00:24:42,991 --> 00:24:47,600
that organizations are including our own
governments are pursuing at this point,

454
00:24:47,601 --> 00:24:49,700
the philosophy side.
He's not alone in that,

455
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,480
in assuming that,
that people who all think alike but that

456
00:24:53,481 --> 00:24:56,000
have different racial or gender 
backgrounds,

457
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,580
um,
is in fact diversity.

458
00:24:58,581 --> 00:24:59,414
I mean the ontario securities commission
has been mandating that type of 

459
00:25:02,511 --> 00:25:03,344
diversity on,
on boards of directors for publicly 

460
00:25:05,571 --> 00:25:07,110
traded companies.
Um,

461
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:07,631
you know,
the,

462
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:08,464
the,
the federal government in its cabinet 

463
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:11,203
appointments is pursuing that,
that type of diversity that really is 

464
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,970
not a diversity of thought,
so to speak or opinion.

465
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:18,230
But a diversity of,
of,

466
00:25:18,231 --> 00:25:19,260
um,
well in,

467
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:20,930
in the federal government's case,
gendered.

468
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:22,121
Yeah.
Well,

469
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:24,880
the other thing that's going to happen 
is that if we,

470
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,063
you know,
the people who hold the political views 

471
00:25:28,451 --> 00:25:32,230
that are pushing these ideas forward are
convinced beyond,

472
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,463
um,
beyond argument that what they're going 

473
00:25:35,981 --> 00:25:36,814
to do is to what the instantiation of 
these policies is going to result in is 

474
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:44,140
increased racial harmony and let's say 
harmony between the sexes,

475
00:25:44,141 --> 00:25:48,280
but I think you could make a very strong
case for exactly the opposite,

476
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:51,370
which is the more that we define people 
by race and gender,

477
00:25:51,371 --> 00:25:54,160
the more that people are going to be 
defined by race and gender.

478
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,173
And I don't see that at all.
I Really don't see that as a recipe for 

479
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,033
social harmony.
I don't think it's worked in the United 

480
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,340
States at all.
Quite the contrary.

481
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:07,120
And we actually have a pretty harmonious
society already by,

482
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,660
by any reasonable standard,
any reasonable world standard.

483
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:15,880
And I think that this will inflame 
tensions between groups unnecessarily.

484
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:17,920
Well,
I actually had a,

485
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:18,873
a lawyer reach out to me,
a racialized licensee and say exactly 

486
00:26:22,091 --> 00:26:22,924
that,
that their main concern with what they 

487
00:26:24,221 --> 00:26:25,054
were seeing,
not only in the compelled speech 

488
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:27,484
component on the statement of values,
but also the underlying recommendations 

489
00:26:30,311 --> 00:26:31,144
of the report is he thought that that 
was going to inflame tensions or 

490
00:26:34,721 --> 00:26:39,040
animosity towards people in his group.
And,

491
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:40,750
and I,
I had never thought of it that way,

492
00:26:40,751 --> 00:26:43,660
but he was quite concerned that this was
actually to,

493
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:47,820
to generate anamis against those that 
actually sought to protect.

494
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,040
So that's,
that's one viewpoint that I hadn't,

495
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,173
hadn't expected.

496
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,613
So should we are discussed for a moment 
on the emotion that is being brought to 

497
00:26:57,421 --> 00:26:58,254
complication.
A joe [inaudible] who is a lawyer in an 

498
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,180
adventure,
uh,

499
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,060
has,
uh,

500
00:27:03,061 --> 00:27:03,894
put together a motion to change the 
nature of the statement of values 

501
00:27:07,951 --> 00:27:08,784
requirement.
And perhaps I'll just read out the key 

502
00:27:10,231 --> 00:27:14,010
provision of this motion,
moved that convocation,

503
00:27:14,011 --> 00:27:14,844
approve that no licensee who has a 
conscientious objection to the adoption 

504
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:25,370
of a statement of principles shall be 
required to comply with recommendations.

505
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,060
And they shall be exempted from the 
requirements of recommendation three,

506
00:27:30,061 --> 00:27:33,540
one to adopt and abide by a statement of
principles.

507
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:39,060
Now I'm joe is a fellow that has my 
utmost respect.

508
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,180
Uh,
he's,

509
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,190
uh,
he's,

510
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,400
he's done a great deal of good inside 
complication,

511
00:27:44,401 --> 00:27:46,020
I think as,
as a venture.

512
00:27:46,021 --> 00:27:51,000
And I admire his willingness to put 
forward this motion,

513
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:55,800
which means he's sticking his head up 
from a crowd that doesn't really want to

514
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:57,750
stick their heads up.
Absolutely.

515
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,840
But nevertheless,
they're there.

516
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,430
There are some difficulties with the 
emotion.

517
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,950
Jared,
do you want to speak to that first?

518
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:05,931
Well,
yeah.

519
00:28:05,931 --> 00:28:06,580
So,
uh,

520
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,413
the motion itself,
somebody was talking to me about it and 

521
00:28:10,281 --> 00:28:11,990
they said the problem is,
is that,

522
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,373
um,
it makes it appear that if one elects 

523
00:28:15,711 --> 00:28:18,110
not to file the statement of values.
So if you,

524
00:28:18,111 --> 00:28:18,944
if the motion is passed and they,
they then decide I'm not going to file 

525
00:28:21,321 --> 00:28:22,154
the statement of values on that basis 
that you would be seen or it would be 

526
00:28:25,191 --> 00:28:26,024
interpreted as you being a conscientious
objector to the values that the law 

527
00:28:29,661 --> 00:28:32,870
society statement of values is,
is asking us to affirm.

528
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,093
And,
and it rather than an objection to this 

529
00:28:36,651 --> 00:28:37,484
idea of compelled speech or being forced
to disclose or divulge what may be in 

530
00:28:41,601 --> 00:28:43,760
your head or what your thoughts and 
opinions may be,

531
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:45,320
and I,
and I hadn't thought of it that way,

532
00:28:45,321 --> 00:28:46,730
but when you look at the motion,
yes,

533
00:28:46,731 --> 00:28:48,320
it very much can be interpreted that 
way.

534
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,520
Right?
And so in essence,

535
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:54,410
it does not save you from having to,
uh,

536
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:55,420
uh,
to,

537
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,343
to perform the forced speech obligation.
Just use you another thing to indicate 

538
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,253
which essentially requires you to stick 
your head up and be counted one way or 

539
00:29:05,561 --> 00:29:07,060
the other.
In other words,

540
00:29:07,061 --> 00:29:10,780
the law society is still succeeding at 
dividing people between those people who

541
00:29:10,781 --> 00:29:14,560
are willing to do the statement and 
those people who refuse to do it,

542
00:29:14,561 --> 00:29:16,090
but have to say that they refused to do 
it.

543
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:21,420
So there is still forced speech in here,
even if the motion passes.

544
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,473
Yeah,
I don't think it gets us to where we 

545
00:29:28,261 --> 00:29:29,470
need to be.
Um,

546
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,630
you know,
and as you said,

547
00:29:30,631 --> 00:29:31,840
I think joe's,
uh,

548
00:29:31,841 --> 00:29:34,770
joe's a tremendous person deserves a lot
of respect.

549
00:29:34,771 --> 00:29:37,280
He's fighting his own free speech 
battles before,

550
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,660
before the supreme court of Canada in 
early november.

551
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,410
Um,
as you may know,

552
00:29:41,411 --> 00:29:42,131
he,
he was,

553
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:42,964
uh,
accused of crossing some imaginary line 

554
00:29:45,161 --> 00:29:50,161
about the conduct of his defense.
I'm a of an individual before the courts

555
00:29:51,941 --> 00:29:54,550
and,
and that is a very novel idea.

556
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:55,930
Uh,
and so,

557
00:29:55,931 --> 00:29:56,764
uh,
the industry is watching with some 

558
00:29:57,821 --> 00:29:58,654
interest to see what the supreme court 
of Canada says about whether or not 

559
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:03,940
there is a line in the sand as to the 
type of advocacy can pursue.

560
00:30:03,941 --> 00:30:04,774
So he is,
uh,

561
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:05,893
uh,
joe is somebody to watch and someone 

562
00:30:06,851 --> 00:30:07,684
respected.
But I think the emotion comes up 

563
00:30:08,741 --> 00:30:09,574
slightly short of where it needs to be.
I don't think it gets us to the plAce 

564
00:30:12,581 --> 00:30:15,130
that I think we need to be,
which is that the law society should not

565
00:30:15,131 --> 00:30:18,330
be mad meddling or even asking what the,
uh,

566
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:22,090
what the thoughts in and conscience is 
of its members.

567
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,720
Right?
So As of right now,

568
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:28,721
there is nothing on the table that as 
far as we are,

569
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,830
we're concerned that vex offers the 
possibility of,

570
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:34,803
of eliminating the objectionable aspect 
of this forced speech obligation on 

571
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,113
flooding.

572
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,760
Know iT's interesting.
Go ahead Jordan.

573
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:43,843
Okay.
Well,

574
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:46,310
we'd also talked a little bit about the 
fact that,

575
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:47,163
you know,
we had concentrated specifically on the 

576
00:30:49,111 --> 00:30:49,944
statement of principles as the 
objectionable element of the 

577
00:30:52,761 --> 00:30:53,594
recommendations,
but the recommendations as a package or 

578
00:30:56,031 --> 00:30:56,864
also objectionable because they're all 
fed by the same underlying philosophy 

579
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,070
of,
of well systemic racism,

580
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:05,280
let's say,
and,

581
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,820
and the promotion of equity,
diversity,

582
00:31:07,821 --> 00:31:09,880
and,
and equality as the highest of,

583
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,630
of,
of moral values.

584
00:31:11,631 --> 00:31:15,590
So do we want to talk a little bit about
the rest of the recommendation?

585
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,050
Sure.
Yeah.

586
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:17,441
Let's.
Well,

587
00:31:17,441 --> 00:31:18,200
let's,
let's,

588
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,861
uh,
I'll,

589
00:31:18,861 --> 00:31:22,280
I'll read out the first one.
Perhaps the first one,

590
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,310
uh,
gives a flavor for the whole,

591
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,500
the whole host of them.
So the first one goes like this.

592
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,813
The law society will review and amend 
where appropriate the rules of 

593
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,014
professional conduct and the paralegal 
rules of conduct and commentaries to 

594
00:31:37,071 --> 00:31:41,540
reinforce the professional obligations 
of all licensees to recognize,

595
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:45,710
acknowledge,
and promote principles of equality,

596
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,573
diversity and inclusion,
consistent with the requirements under 

597
00:31:49,521 --> 00:31:53,690
human rights legislation and this 
special responsibilities of licensees in

598
00:31:53,691 --> 00:31:56,480
the legal imperiled legal profession.
Now,

599
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:57,840
um,
the,

600
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:58,880
there are those words,
again,

601
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:01,300
we talked on.
You also mean if you abide by that,

602
00:32:01,301 --> 00:32:02,134
that you have to accept the definition 
of diversity as essentially predicated 

603
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,790
both on race and sex.

604
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,630
Uh,
yeah.

605
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,080
Well,
yeah.

606
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,913
Well,
of course they haven't defined 

607
00:32:10,191 --> 00:32:11,024
diversity,
but consistent with the rest of the 

608
00:32:12,381 --> 00:32:13,460
regime.
Yes.

609
00:32:13,461 --> 00:32:14,070
That,
that,

610
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:14,903
that in the way that we have previously 
described that that is the meaning of 

611
00:32:19,071 --> 00:32:19,904
diversity that they're going for.
And also the meaning of equality as I 

612
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,090
suggested earlier.
Right.

613
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,760
So,
um,

614
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,223
the,
and of course there's their internal 

615
00:32:29,271 --> 00:32:30,104
contradictions in the statement because 
they're going to amend the rules of 

616
00:32:33,111 --> 00:32:33,944
professional conduct.
So as to reinforce obligations that 

617
00:32:37,761 --> 00:32:38,594
don't exist,
would they really mean to say is we're 

618
00:32:41,451 --> 00:32:44,510
going to change them so as to create new
obligations.

619
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,793
The,
um,

620
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,873
requirements under human rights 
legislation that this recommendation 

621
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:50,414
refers to act again,
do not include the obligation to 

622
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,200
acknowledge and promote.
They are,

623
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,410
they are conduct laws that everybody is 
subject to,

624
00:33:00,411 --> 00:33:02,480
but they prohibit certain things.
So,

625
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:05,150
um,
so like the statement,

626
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,670
uh,
this first recommendation that gives the

627
00:33:07,671 --> 00:33:09,430
flavor of all the rest of them,
uh,

628
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,340
suggests that the law society is 
essentially moving into a new area,

629
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:18,550
an area of regulating competence.
And if I can put it this way,

630
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,600
instead of being a,
a neutral regulator of competence in the

631
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:24,990
political sentence,
uh,

632
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:30,260
they have now more or less taken on the 
mandate of regulating competence in,

633
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,750
in the political sense,
in the ideological sense.

634
00:33:32,751 --> 00:33:33,584
They are essentially saying,
here are some values that regulator is 

635
00:33:37,521 --> 00:33:41,090
going to require you to comply with 
these values.

636
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:41,983
Essentially our progressive values.
So in the digital or not a progressive 

637
00:33:44,991 --> 00:33:45,824
lawyer,
we do not think that you have the right 

638
00:33:47,871 --> 00:33:49,460
to practice law in this province

639
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:55,250
and as the only values that are going to
be the subject of a statement of values.

640
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,860
they are elevating those,
uh,

641
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,830
to a position of prominence.
Uh,

642
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:02,690
and I would suggest beyond all others,

643
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,630
yes,
sure.

644
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,290
The,
these,

645
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:08,110
these,
these values because of their,

646
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,153
of their listed in a special way.
It seemed to be put above other more 

647
00:34:14,931 --> 00:34:18,300
fundamental values like the rule of law,
like formal equality,

648
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,560
like competence or like,
like,

649
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,513
well,
competence you would think would be the 

650
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:27,620
core mandate of the law society itself.
And my competence,

651
00:34:27,621 --> 00:34:32,090
I mean skills,
knowledge and compliance with ethics,

652
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,760
professionalism,
professional.

653
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,103
This also seems to be to be reflective 
of a constant push on the part of 

654
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,010
political ideologues,
of the progressive type

655
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,503
to mandate that have all the rights that
canadians enjoy or perhaps the 

656
00:34:48,741 --> 00:34:49,574
obligations they have to undertake,
that the rights of the rights that are 

657
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:56,594
associated with equality,
diversity and inclusivity are going to 

658
00:34:59,121 --> 00:35:02,150
be made paramount in relationship to all
of the other rights.

659
00:35:02,151 --> 00:35:04,850
And that seems to me to be an utter 
catastrophe.

660
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,190
So.

661
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,440
well,
the proponents of the,

662
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,890
uh,
of the statement of values,

663
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:11,650
the people that I've seen writing 
commentary pieces,

664
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:16,930
none of them seem to disagree that there
is a compelled speech component inherent

665
00:35:16,931 --> 00:35:20,440
in the statement of values.
What they do is they say,

666
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,080
okay,
but under section one of the charter and

667
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:27,610
an oaks test analysis that infringement 
on freedom of conscience,

668
00:35:27,611 --> 00:35:28,444
freedom of thought,
freedom of expression is reasonable to 

669
00:35:31,541 --> 00:35:32,374
attain the objective of equality,
which is also a competing right under 

670
00:35:36,581 --> 00:35:38,190
the charter.
And inevitably,

671
00:35:38,191 --> 00:35:40,050
and I think they have a point,
a,

672
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,093
anytime the supreme court of Canada has 
engaged in a section one analysis on 

673
00:35:43,711 --> 00:35:45,660
freedom of speech,
uh,

674
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,533
that,
that butts up against the competing 

675
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,140
equality,
right?

676
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,003
They tend to find that save and except 
for the most egregious infringements 

677
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,130
that the equality rights shall prevail 
or be the,

678
00:35:57,131 --> 00:36:00,210
the tipping factor.
And so it's like I said,

679
00:36:00,211 --> 00:36:02,970
it's interesting that the proponents,
they don't disagree.

680
00:36:02,971 --> 00:36:03,804
Oh yeah,
we're putting a compelled speech 

681
00:36:04,441 --> 00:36:07,610
component on you,
but it's a very effective.

682
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:13,760
Also note this though,
because the first part of section 15 it,

683
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,920
is it really a section about formal 
equality vii,

684
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:20,340
the equal application of laws to 
everybody.

685
00:36:20,341 --> 00:36:22,590
What does not the,
the quality of their talking about.

686
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,790
So they,
they are,

687
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:28,470
they aren't shifting the ground on what 
equality means and then staying and that

688
00:36:28,471 --> 00:36:31,860
content kind of equality justified the 
infringement of these,

689
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:34,540
of these other rights under section one,
as you say.

690
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,050
So do you want to continue bruce?
With.

691
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,190
So,
so let me,

692
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,850
let me read
another one.

693
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,980
Um,
let me just find it here.

694
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,310
Uh,
I want to read the one.

695
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,170
Here we go.
This is recommendation 10.

696
00:36:49,171 --> 00:36:50,004
This is,
I want to read this one because it just 

697
00:36:51,721 --> 00:36:55,800
reinforces the proposition that we spoke
about which is at the law society is,

698
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,053
is changing the nature of competence to 
encompass a certain set of political 

699
00:37:01,411 --> 00:37:03,450
values.
So they're doing this explicitly.

700
00:37:03,451 --> 00:37:04,284
Recommendation 10 says as follows,
the law society will include the topics 

701
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,503
of cultural competency,
equality and inclusion in the 

702
00:37:13,501 --> 00:37:17,100
professions as competencies to be 
acquired in the license,

703
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,860
the process.
So if you are along a young lawyer,

704
00:37:19,861 --> 00:37:22,440
a young law school,
graduate,

705
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,130
and you were applying to be licensed by 
the law society,

706
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,780
these are among the things that you must
show to them that you are competent in,

707
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:31,600
that you,
you,

708
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,400
you believe and agree and follow.
These particular values,

709
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,430
it'll be on the bar exam.
Yes.

710
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,090
Yeah.
Shelly,

711
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,200
continue on.
There's the uh,

712
00:37:45,201 --> 00:37:47,000
there's the same.
Uh,

713
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:52,990
I believe I read out already is the 
requirement for the continuing education

714
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,670
matter.
Let,

715
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,140
let's move to one of the recommendations
that are being put in place this year.

716
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,303
The statement of values is,
is one on the and the other one that is 

717
00:38:03,471 --> 00:38:08,471
mandatory for work legal workplaces have
over a 10 lawyers goes like this.

718
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,543
The law society will require a,
a licensee representative of each legal 

719
00:38:14,961 --> 00:38:19,730
workplace of at least 10 licensees in 
ontario to develop,

720
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,103
implement and maintain a human rights 
diversity policy or their legal 

721
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:30,590
workforce addressing at the very least 
fair recruitment,

722
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,453
retention and advancement which will be 
available to members of the profession 

723
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,880
and the public upon request.

724
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,830
So,
so there,

725
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,930
there's a measurement issue because 
measurement,

726
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,130
an enforcement issue.
So the measurement issue is well what is

727
00:38:45,131 --> 00:38:50,131
fair and how is it defined?
So is it defined by the racial makeup of

728
00:38:50,351 --> 00:38:51,184
the firm over the next 10 years?
So if it doesn't shift in the required 

729
00:38:54,161 --> 00:38:55,060
direction,
let's say,

730
00:38:55,061 --> 00:38:55,894
or the gender makeup of the firm,
it doesn't shift in the required 

731
00:38:58,031 --> 00:39:00,190
direction.
Does that mean you're out of compliance,

732
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,413
like the details in this sort of the 
measurement details and this sort of 

733
00:39:03,971 --> 00:39:04,804
thing really matter who defines fair and
then what's enforced and who's going to 

734
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:12,430
like it are,
are the firm's going to be subject to an

735
00:39:12,431 --> 00:39:13,264
external analysis that examines their,
their diversity makeup over some period 

736
00:39:18,461 --> 00:39:19,690
of time?
And is there,

737
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:22,990
is there going to be provisions about 
how rapidly the,

738
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,003
the,
uh,

739
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:28,810
the ethnic and sex makeup of the firm 
has to transform across time?

740
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,480
Like the devil's in the details in this 
sort of thing.

741
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:36,070
They're proposing actually that a,
that a member of the workplace conduct,

742
00:39:36,071 --> 00:39:38,500
uh,
an inclusion self-assessment every,

743
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:42,580
every two years to get at the measuring 
component.

744
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,860
And so what's an inclusion 
self-assessment mean?

745
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,940
Exactly.
What do you think that means?

746
00:39:48,941 --> 00:39:49,774
Does that mean what do you do?
Do you lift list your race mean or do 

747
00:39:53,801 --> 00:39:54,634
you,
do you,

748
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,690
do you examine your soul to determine 
whether you're,

749
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,003
you're oriented in the proper inclusive 
in this direction in relationship to 

750
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:07,050
race and gender?
Like I don't understand.

751
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,760
I don't because I'm a measurement guy.
Fundamentally,

752
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:10,893
you know,
I don't understand how these things are 

753
00:40:12,011 --> 00:40:14,800
going to be assessed.
They are not easy to assess.

754
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,600
And then there's the enforcement 
problem.

755
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:18,773
I,
I really don't know what the word 

756
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:21,874
inclusion means.
I have ideas about what a quality can 

757
00:40:24,731 --> 00:40:25,564
mean.
I have ideas about what diversity can 

758
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:29,260
mean.
I don't know what inclusion means.

759
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:31,720
I,
I really just don't understand the word.

760
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:34,810
I don't know how you measure it.
I don't know what you mean by that.

761
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:38,510
The law society has been collecting data
for four years.

762
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,433
Uh,
I'm on these types of demographics on 

763
00:40:42,141 --> 00:40:45,620
the basis of a,
a voluntary survey basis.

764
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,140
Um,
and so what they've,

765
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:48,043
they're actually proposing to go further
is that within these legal workplaces 

766
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,710
that these workplaces conduct inclusion 
surveys now,

767
00:40:54,711 --> 00:40:55,544
there was a tremendous amount of 
conversation at the convocation meeting 

768
00:40:58,491 --> 00:40:59,324
that adopted these recommendations about
compelling people to self identify 

769
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:07,520
within some sort of demographic group or
the other and that there would be some,

770
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,620
there's,
there would be some risk resistance,

771
00:41:09,621 --> 00:41:13,790
particularly among racialized licensees 
of doing so,

772
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,773
so they're going to make it voluntary,
but that then goes to the issue of 

773
00:41:18,921 --> 00:41:20,720
what's the quality of the data that 
they're getting,

774
00:41:20,721 --> 00:41:21,554
Jordan,
if it's a voluntary self reporting 

775
00:41:24,621 --> 00:41:28,820
exercise and not everybody's reporting 
because as they said at convocation,

776
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,970
some groups may be,
uh,

777
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:31,873
disinclined or fearful of,
of identifying themselves for whatever 

778
00:41:35,091 --> 00:41:35,924
reason,
what's the quality of the data they're 

779
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:37,994
getting,
and then how are they going to act on 

780
00:41:38,691 --> 00:41:39,524
that data?

781
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:40,403
Yeah.
Or maybe even unwilling to identify 

782
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:42,660
themselves.
Well,

783
00:41:42,661 --> 00:41:44,140
that's what I told you.
I don't see why,

784
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,233
why it's free.
It should be required of me that I 

785
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,990
reveal my what,
what,

786
00:41:48,991 --> 00:41:52,110
which aspects of my identity,
what am I going to reveal?

787
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:56,280
So I mean obviously I'm white,
whatever the hell that means,

788
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,473
so,
but there's all sorts of other aspects 

789
00:41:59,281 --> 00:42:01,200
of my identity that for,
for example,

790
00:42:01,201 --> 00:42:02,490
I might want to keep private

791
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,860
even the existing data on which they 
founded a,

792
00:42:05,861 --> 00:42:06,694
the finding of systemic discrimination.
The empirical data was based on 

793
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,433
voluntary survey data.
So we're not even certain that we're 

794
00:42:14,201 --> 00:42:15,034
getting what I would say is his 
confidence send census type quality 

795
00:42:18,431 --> 00:42:19,264
data.

796
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:23,020
So I read you another one of these 
recommendations,

797
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,570
a recommendation 12,
two,

798
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:25,893
it says that the law society will revise
the rules of professional conduct and 

799
00:42:30,161 --> 00:42:30,994
the paralegal rules of conduct where 
appropriate so that the discrimination 

800
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:41,430
is clearly identified as a breach of 
professional conduct requirements.

801
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,600
So say that.
Say that again.

802
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:46,650
Yes,
I,

803
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:50,850
I will.
The law society will revise the rules of

804
00:42:50,851 --> 00:42:51,684
professional conduct where appropriate 
so that systemic discrimination is 

805
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:01,830
clearly identified as a breach of 
professional conduct requirements.

806
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:02,903
Okay.
So that means that at some point in the 

807
00:43:04,171 --> 00:43:09,171
future could be assessed for its 
compliance with equality.

808
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,163
However,
that's defined perhaps as equality of 

809
00:43:11,941 --> 00:43:13,740
outcome,
but we don't know.

810
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,353
Or with regards to rate of 
transformation of demographic 

811
00:43:18,391 --> 00:43:19,224
membership,
and if you're found not to be in 

812
00:43:20,911 --> 00:43:22,890
compliance,
whatever that means,

813
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:23,963
then that means that you've.
You've engaged in proFessional 

814
00:43:26,731 --> 00:43:27,564
misconduct.

815
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,133
Yes,
but it's interesting that they used the 

816
00:43:30,221 --> 00:43:34,270
word systemic discrimination because 
that meant we're talking,

817
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,433
we've used that term in the past to talk
about the profession and that's the way 

818
00:43:38,441 --> 00:43:42,370
they use that term in the report that 
the profession has a problem of systemic

819
00:43:42,371 --> 00:43:43,204
discrimination,
so I'm just puzzling over the use of 

820
00:43:47,621 --> 00:43:48,454
that term in this particular 
recommendation because it suggests that 

821
00:43:50,831 --> 00:43:55,831
if you are or your firm is,
is guilty of systemic discrimination,

822
00:43:55,941 --> 00:43:58,690
then that is a matter of reaching your 
conduct obligation.

823
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,833
What does that.
Does that mean that every single lawyer 

824
00:44:01,591 --> 00:44:06,150
in the firm is guilty of that because 
that's what systemic would imply.

825
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,133
It also begs the question of how many 
people you need to be systemically 

826
00:44:11,311 --> 00:44:13,740
racist before you actually have a 
system?

827
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,640
Well,
they're going to be doing a benchmarking

828
00:44:15,641 --> 00:44:16,391
exercise.
I mean,

829
00:44:16,391 --> 00:44:17,224
that's part of it is that you're going 
to have to submit these inclusion 

830
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:23,320
assessments to the law society and then 
they're actually going to review that as

831
00:44:23,321 --> 00:44:24,910
against the industry as a whole,
uh,

832
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:28,960
in terms of finding out where you're at 
on your inclusivity.

833
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:30,063
And so my concern would that they find 
systemic discrimination within an 

834
00:44:33,481 --> 00:44:34,314
organization because it falls short of,
of what the industry writes wide 

835
00:44:38,341 --> 00:44:40,980
standard is in terms of it's um,
well,

836
00:44:40,981 --> 00:44:43,080
it's diversity a layup

837
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:45,020
date.
Right?

838
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:46,950
And so what that'll mean fundamentally,
it's,

839
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:50,760
let's say that you have a firm that has,
that it's a small firm,

840
00:44:50,761 --> 00:44:55,710
say 10 people and all of the people in 
it happened to be caucasian just for the

841
00:44:55,711 --> 00:44:56,544
sake of argument.
So that mean that you'll be mandated to 

842
00:44:58,531 --> 00:45:00,480
hire by race for the next while.

843
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:01,670
Well,
your systemics,

844
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:02,663
you're just,
you're systemically discriminatory 

845
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,550
organization.
I think.

846
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,320
Let's,
do you mandated to do that?

847
00:45:09,321 --> 00:45:10,154
How is that legal?
How is that possibly illegal to be 

848
00:45:12,231 --> 00:45:14,480
mandated to hire by race

849
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:16,573
only by virtue of the mandate that the 
law society has from the government to 

850
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:22,240
regulate the,
the legal professional.

851
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:22,820
I mean that,
that,

852
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,780
that what it has to rest on,
if,

853
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:29,810
if you read the statutory mandate of the
law society,

854
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,633
it would seem to fall outside the 
marching orders and the law society has 

855
00:45:34,821 --> 00:45:38,270
at least as it is simply worded.
The prompts I can read you that this is,

856
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:41,690
this is a,
a section 41 of the law society act.

857
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:43,790
Uh,
sorry.

858
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:45,620
Let me read first,
section four,

859
00:45:45,621 --> 00:45:46,454
point one.
This is the function of the law society 

860
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:49,963
is to ensure that all persons who 
practiced law in ontario or provide 

861
00:45:53,931 --> 00:45:54,764
legal services in ontario meet standards
of learning professional competence and 

862
00:45:59,301 --> 00:46:00,134
professional conduct that are 
appropriate for the legal services they 

863
00:46:03,021 --> 00:46:03,854
provide.
So unless you can fit this into the 

864
00:46:05,931 --> 00:46:06,764
phrase professional conduct then then 
under this section there is no mandate 

865
00:46:11,001 --> 00:46:12,980
to do these kinds of things.

866
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,513
I was going to read section 41 which 
lists a the standards of professional 

867
00:46:18,591 --> 00:46:20,960
competence that the law society supposed
to ensure.

868
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,393
And section 41 says a licensee fails to 
meet standards of professional 

869
00:46:26,901 --> 00:46:30,140
competence for the purpose of this act.
If,

870
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:31,453
and there are a number of things listed,
but the ones that are relevant here are 

871
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:34,993
a,
if there are deficiencies in the 

872
00:46:36,531 --> 00:46:37,364
licensees knowledge,
skill or judgment or the licensees 

873
00:46:42,681 --> 00:46:43,514
attention to the interests of clients,
and those are the only two bits of that 

874
00:46:47,061 --> 00:46:49,790
section that applied to this question 
and they don't apply.

875
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:51,103
They don't destroy drive the nature of 
these obligations that are being 

876
00:46:54,321 --> 00:46:55,154
contemplated.

877
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:56,423
Can you zoom?
If I was applying for a job at a law 

878
00:46:58,591 --> 00:47:03,030
firm that was a compelled by this 
mandate to diverse itself,

879
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,013
diversify itself racially and I was a 
qualified candidate and I got wind of 

880
00:47:08,401 --> 00:47:10,890
the fact that that requirement had been 
put in place,

881
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,410
couldn't I go after the firm for 
discrimination because they made race a,

882
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:16,403
one of the basis of hiring that they 
were compelled to make race one of the 

883
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:19,650
basis of hiring

884
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:20,451
the,
uh,

885
00:47:20,451 --> 00:47:21,284
the human rights code and the charter of
rights and freedoms allow for certain 

886
00:47:23,751 --> 00:47:25,960
forms of discrimination when it's,
uh,

887
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:30,800
when it's for the purposes of an amelia 
amelia exercise.

888
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,440
Um,
for instance,

889
00:47:32,441 --> 00:47:35,020
if there is systemic discrimination 
identified,

890
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:36,123
the charter will permit discrimination 
against a group in order to remedy what 

891
00:47:40,311 --> 00:47:43,540
it may be perceived as a systemic 
discrimination issue.

892
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:44,374
This,
I mean specifically addresses and 

893
00:47:46,221 --> 00:47:47,320
exempts,
uh,

894
00:47:47,321 --> 00:47:48,154
affirmative action type programs as,
as being found to be discriminatory and 

895
00:47:50,891 --> 00:47:52,180
allows them,
it permits them.

896
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:54,700
So the answer would be yes,
you could raise that,

897
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:55,883
um,
but the but the law firm and the law 

898
00:47:58,391 --> 00:48:01,000
society,
if they would have to then bring forward

899
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,180
evidence that this is part of a,
a,

900
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:04,523
you know,
an affirmative action type program that 

901
00:48:05,531 --> 00:48:06,364
is exempted and I'll let you,
you're allowed to discriminate on that 

902
00:48:08,861 --> 00:48:09,694
basis.

903
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:11,923
We,
for a moment just turned to one of the 

904
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:19,830
justifications that have been given for 
this whole slate of recommendations.

905
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:20,903
This whole program which is that your,
your membership in the law society is a 

906
00:48:27,631 --> 00:48:28,464
voluntary thing.
You don't have to belong to the law 

907
00:48:30,721 --> 00:48:31,554
society.
This is not the state coming down and 

908
00:48:32,731 --> 00:48:34,860
requiring all its citizens to do a 
certain thing.

909
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,083
You have chosen to be a member of the 
law society and therefore you must take 

910
00:48:39,631 --> 00:48:44,631
these obligations on voluntarily.
Which of course is a ridiculous thing to

911
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:49,560
say because the law society takes its 
mandate from the government.

912
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:52,500
The government has,
has given the law society of the job,

913
00:48:52,501 --> 00:48:54,720
of being the gatekeeper,
um,

914
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:55,950
of,
of the,

915
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:56,903
of the rights to practice law.
And if you are to practice law in this 

916
00:48:59,401 --> 00:49:00,470
province,
you,

917
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:04,950
you must be a member and you must adhere
to the rules of conduct that they,

918
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,000
that they require you to suggest that,
that your at your,

919
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:12,773
uh,
your engagement with the law society is 

920
00:49:14,821 --> 00:49:19,230
something that you do a voluntarily just
because you wish to do so.

921
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:21,360
And that makeS it a voluntary 
organization.

922
00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:23,520
It is in a.

923
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:24,783
Right?
So the voluntary aspect is that you can 

924
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:31,381
give up your heart one livelihood if you
don't want to be subject to these rules.

925
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:32,793
Yes.
So I suppose you could make a case that 

926
00:49:33,941 --> 00:49:34,774
that's voluntary,
but I mean it's certainly the case that 

927
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:42,460
it stretches.
It certainly stretches the definition of

928
00:49:42,461 --> 00:49:45,040
what normal people would consider 
volunteering.

929
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:45,571
Well,
it,

930
00:49:45,571 --> 00:49:45,931
it,
it,

931
00:49:45,931 --> 00:49:50,931
it turns,
it turns the idea that you would have a,

932
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,363
you would have a right to practice in 
any profession if you have the proper 

933
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,960
skill and training and competence to do 
so.

934
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:02,903
That question is,
is up for grabs now because they're 

935
00:50:06,271 --> 00:50:07,104
essentially saying,
well actually what you also have to do 

936
00:50:09,811 --> 00:50:10,644
is go along with our vision the way 
things are supposed to be and the way 

937
00:50:14,071 --> 00:50:17,070
you think.
And if you don't choose to go along with

938
00:50:17,071 --> 00:50:17,904
that way,
well then you're free to go off and do 

939
00:50:18,931 --> 00:50:19,660
something else

940
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,820
and what other people's values migrate 
over time.

941
00:50:21,821 --> 00:50:23,480
So it is right now,
you know,

942
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,333
these,
these values that we're looking at in 

943
00:50:25,271 --> 00:50:28,640
the statement of principles here.
But what if they migrate over time,

944
00:50:28,641 --> 00:50:30,020
what could they become?
You know,

945
00:50:30,021 --> 00:50:33,890
and I think it sets a precedent that,
that we might want to push back against

946
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:34,803
swelled it,
it's worrisome because the values are 

947
00:50:38,771 --> 00:50:39,604
very ill defined.
And so an ill dEfined like a box that 

948
00:50:43,481 --> 00:50:44,314
could contain anything ends up 
containing a very strange number of 

949
00:50:46,721 --> 00:50:47,960
things.
And you know,

950
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:48,813
bruce pointed that out very clearly when
he talked about his inability to 

951
00:50:51,941 --> 00:50:55,090
understand what constitutes inclusivity.
It's like,

952
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:57,220
okay,
so let's say that we could,

953
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,113
we could define equality and diversity 
if we were willing to even using racial 

954
00:51:02,441 --> 00:51:03,274
and gender categories,
which I think is a unbelievably 

955
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,650
catastrophic error.
But okay.

956
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:13,210
Inclusivity.
Well if that's definition list,

957
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:17,410
then it's a place to put any other 
requirements that might come along.

958
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,190
I don't know.
I really can't say what it.

959
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:23,140
What does inclusivity mean?
Is that more like the nonverbal behavior

960
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:25,000
that you might manifest,
you know,

961
00:51:25,001 --> 00:51:26,030
or,
or,

962
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:26,883
or is it,
does it refer to more subtle 

963
00:51:28,091 --> 00:51:31,420
interactions within the firm?
That's kinda what it sounds like.

964
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,333
So yeah.
So at least it might be worthwhile 

965
00:51:37,571 --> 00:51:40,150
trying to find out what they mean by 
inclusivity.

966
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:41,860
No.
If they really want to be inclusive,

967
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:45,040
they would get rid of the bar admission 
exams.

968
00:51:45,041 --> 00:51:48,790
They would get rid of the loss of law 
school record underlying requirements.

969
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,180
I mean that's essentially makes your 
organization inclusive,

970
00:51:52,181 --> 00:51:53,014
doesn't it?
When you get rid of the barriers to 

971
00:51:54,171 --> 00:51:54,500
entry

972
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,530
fish and too is that if you went and 
analyzed the uh,

973
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:01,310
the success rate at with regards to the 
bar exam,

974
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,413
that you'd find that it produced 
systemic discrimination as well because 

975
00:52:06,171 --> 00:52:07,004
the probability that that an objective 
test produces exactly the same results 

976
00:52:12,171 --> 00:52:16,310
across all conceivable groups is zero.
So,

977
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,233
and you know,
you see this sort of thing happening in 

978
00:52:18,321 --> 00:52:19,154
the United States already where 
competency requirements produce group 

979
00:52:22,521 --> 00:52:23,354
differences,
especially if you analyze enough group 

980
00:52:25,341 --> 00:52:26,174
differences.
and so what happens then is the 

981
00:52:27,531 --> 00:52:28,364
competency requirements are 
gerrymandered to eliminate the group 

982
00:52:30,651 --> 00:52:32,600
differences.
So,

983
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:33,673
and that's all part of an assault,
I would say on the idea of objective 

984
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:38,570
competence.
so

985
00:52:41,330 --> 00:52:42,760
book are there,
are there more,

986
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:46,090
are there more statements that are worth
analyzing?

987
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:47,180
Well,
let's just have a look here.

988
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:51,100
I mean there's a,
there's a whole a whole roster of them,

989
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:54,880
but I think those are the ones that are 
most pressing.

990
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:55,760
Um,
well,

991
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,380
well I thought there was,
there was

992
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:57,520
an interesting one.
It was,

993
00:52:57,521 --> 00:53:02,440
it was recommendation 12 sub for they 
want,

994
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,333
they want to create a specialized and 
trained team to address complaints of 

995
00:53:05,921 --> 00:53:07,240
discrimination.
Now,

996
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,340
I mean,
I don't argue that,

997
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,313
I mean discrimination in any act of 
discrimination that is a contravention 

998
00:53:14,561 --> 00:53:15,394
of,
of human rights legislation should be 

999
00:53:16,271 --> 00:53:17,320
stamped out.
It should be,

1000
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,513
it should be identified and dealt with.
But my understanding is that we've got 

1001
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,840
the bodies that are responsible for 
already not only the spirit court,

1002
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:27,990
but also the,
uh,

1003
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:30,420
the human rights tribunals.
So I,

1004
00:53:30,421 --> 00:53:33,690
I wonder what that,
I mean I read that and I say that that's

1005
00:53:33,691 --> 00:53:34,524
a swat team.
There's a swat team that's going to 

1006
00:53:35,641 --> 00:53:36,474
swoop in on the noncompliant,
systemically discriminatory 

1007
00:53:39,451 --> 00:53:43,620
organizations and sort them out that,
that concerns me to some extent,

1008
00:53:43,621 --> 00:53:44,730
particularly,
like I said,

1009
00:53:44,731 --> 00:53:45,564
because we have this,
we have these bodies already in place 

1010
00:53:47,941 --> 00:53:49,410
that are supposed to deal with these 
types of things.

1011
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:50,120
They're doing

1012
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:50,953
get bodies.
So you have the classic court system 

1013
00:53:52,531 --> 00:53:57,450
plus the ontario human rights tribunals 
which already have their own problems.

1014
00:53:57,890 --> 00:53:58,723
So the word in that recommendation,
that consciously real concern is the 

1015
00:54:01,791 --> 00:54:03,560
word address.
This,

1016
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,280
this team will address complaints of 
discrimination.

1017
00:54:07,281 --> 00:54:11,600
Now that doesn't say whether or not they
are the investigator or whether they are

1018
00:54:11,601 --> 00:54:15,290
the adjudicator or whether or not 
they're a combination of the two,

1019
00:54:15,291 --> 00:54:16,124
whether or not they are judge,
jury and executioner all rolled into 

1020
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:20,870
one.
I would be much more comfortable if they

1021
00:54:20,871 --> 00:54:25,430
were procedurally precise to say exactly
what the function of this so called team

1022
00:54:25,431 --> 00:54:26,264
was supposed to be.

1023
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,221
But what's,
I mean,

1024
00:54:27,221 --> 00:54:29,260
what's it for?
We've got a human rights commission that

1025
00:54:29,261 --> 00:54:33,130
can come into any organization and 
workplace in ontario without a warrant,

1026
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:34,540
uh,
and do this,

1027
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:36,200
whatever it is these,
this,

1028
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:37,700
this group wants to do.
So I,

1029
00:54:37,701 --> 00:54:39,940
I questioned creating another layer of 
bureaucracy.

1030
00:54:39,941 --> 00:54:40,590
But.

1031
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:41,161
Well,
I agree,

1032
00:54:41,161 --> 00:54:42,660
I agree.
But what I mean,

1033
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,553
one of the needs for this might be 
because of the point that we made 

1034
00:54:46,831 --> 00:54:47,664
earlier,
which is that the requirements of the 

1035
00:54:49,111 --> 00:54:49,944
law society is now creating our,
are not the same as they are under the 

1036
00:54:54,181 --> 00:54:55,620
human rights code.
Right?

1037
00:54:55,621 --> 00:54:56,454
So the human rights commission and 
tribunal might not have jurisdiction 

1038
00:55:00,511 --> 00:55:03,010
because that's not what the access.
And if,

1039
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:03,873
if these do we create extra and 
additional requirements that are not 

1040
00:55:07,621 --> 00:55:08,500
now,
um,

1041
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:12,030
uh,
the doe now apply to lawyers,

1042
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,900
then you do need an extra bureaucracy 
to,

1043
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,880
to enforce them because nobody else has 
the jurisdiction to do so.

1044
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:20,090
Right?
And then you can pursue,

1045
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:21,163
I think without any fearing error that 
the people who would constitute such a 

1046
00:55:26,181 --> 00:55:27,014
team would be the ones who would be most
zealously in favor of precisely this 

1047
00:55:30,801 --> 00:55:33,350
kind of progressive,
let's call it.

1048
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:35,210
You would expect.
Oh yes,

1049
00:55:35,211 --> 00:55:36,220
definitely.
That,

1050
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:37,250
that's how it works.

1051
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:39,483
Well,
if they're in favor of compelled speech 

1052
00:55:40,631 --> 00:55:41,464
and think that that's justified,
then I would question what other 

1053
00:55:43,691 --> 00:55:48,640
fundamental rights and freedoms they,
they might a dean to stamp stamp upon.

1054
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:52,570
Alright.
So maybe we should move from dance.

1055
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:53,443
one of the things we discussed was 
perhaps asking for more public 

1056
00:55:56,691 --> 00:55:59,240
involvement in our campaign,
let's say.

1057
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:00,783
Um,
and so I believe that we're going to 

1058
00:56:02,871 --> 00:56:05,750
provide contact information for the 
benchers,

1059
00:56:05,751 --> 00:56:06,584
is that correct?
And asked members of the public to 

1060
00:56:09,681 --> 00:56:10,514
listen very carefully to the discussions
that we've had and to indicate to the 

1061
00:56:14,271 --> 00:56:19,271
benchers their concern about this in 
terms of its relationship to the broader

1062
00:56:20,271 --> 00:56:23,650
public potential relationship to the 
broader public sat,

1063
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,540
the law society is,
is his mandate is to,

1064
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:29,510
is to govern the profession,
but within the,

1065
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:32,210
I guess the best interest of the public 
to protect the public.

1066
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,393
And so the public very much as a 
stakeholder in what's happening right 

1067
00:56:35,751 --> 00:56:38,270
now within the legal industry and the 
law society.

1068
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:41,400
And so absolutely I would encourage the 
public to,

1069
00:56:41,430 --> 00:56:43,730
to make any concerns that they may have 
known,

1070
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:44,863
um,
and right to the people that make these 

1071
00:56:45,801 --> 00:56:50,030
decisions and let them know their 
thoughts because this is,

1072
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:50,873
this is something like this was a,
a public trust in this industry to some 

1073
00:56:53,961 --> 00:56:55,070
extent.
And so the public,

1074
00:56:55,071 --> 00:56:57,800
very much it hasn't.
It should be vested in what's happening.

1075
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:58,581
Yeah.
Well,

1076
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,870
it's a fundamental public trust because 
it,

1077
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:01,763
it deals with the,
the underlying structure of the legal 

1078
00:57:04,191 --> 00:57:05,720
system.
And so it,

1079
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:09,920
this is partly why this is so worrisome 
to me because I know perfectly well that

1080
00:57:09,921 --> 00:57:10,754
if,
if the lawyers fold on this and the law 

1081
00:57:14,221 --> 00:57:18,790
society succeeds in pushing forward 
these requirements and then,

1082
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:19,783
and then enforcing them across time,
that every professional organization in 

1083
00:57:22,311 --> 00:57:24,830
Canada is going to follow suit.
And after that,

1084
00:57:24,831 --> 00:57:25,664
well,
once the professional organizations 

1085
00:57:27,141 --> 00:57:29,090
follow suit,
then there's no,

1086
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:32,930
there's no reason to assume that this 
isn't going to spread more widely.

1087
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:34,900
So the,
the,

1088
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:35,763
the,
the,

1089
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:36,623
the main justification underlying all of
this that the law society is relying on 

1090
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:45,220
is the public interest.
So if,

1091
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:49,240
if the public doesn't think this 
reflects their interest,

1092
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:51,040
they had better say so.

1093
00:57:54,140 --> 00:57:58,010
And the licensees obviously a,
anything they can do to reach out,

1094
00:57:58,011 --> 00:57:58,820
I think is,
uh,

1095
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:01,610
is some assistance.
I think the current motion that's before

1096
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:02,444
the law society is to a great extent,
a byproduct of that groundswell of 

1097
00:58:05,811 --> 00:58:08,240
support or opposition,
I guess you'd say.

1098
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:13,150
I'm from lawyers and paralegals.
And if they can direct those efforts and

1099
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:16,100
continue them,
I think it can be of some assistance.

1100
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,333
Hmm.

1101
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,453
Alright.
So we broadened the scope of what we 

1102
00:58:22,911 --> 00:58:27,911
regard as worthy of opposition,
partly because the attempts,

1103
00:58:28,971 --> 00:58:29,804
let's say so far to ameliorate the worst
elements of the policies that are being 

1104
00:58:34,881 --> 00:58:35,714
promoted are insufficient for the task 
and even if they were put into place 

1105
00:58:39,621 --> 00:58:40,454
like the motion that you described it 
would be a victory at 10 percent or 

1106
00:58:45,051 --> 00:58:46,280
something like that.
And,

1107
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:48,710
and not,
not move the underlying,

1108
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:52,940
um,
pathological principals in my estimation

1109
00:58:52,941 --> 00:58:54,590
far enough.
It's something like that.

1110
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:57,800
It wouldn't eradicate the threat that 
we've been trying to warn people about.

1111
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:00,620
correct.
That's right there.

1112
00:59:00,621 --> 00:59:05,621
There is no immediate prospect right now
of,

1113
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:06,823
of getting rid of the forced speech 
element of this policy and the other 

1114
00:59:10,651 --> 00:59:11,484
elements are consistent with that,
that requirement and are being carried 

1115
00:59:16,381 --> 00:59:17,214
along.
And,

1116
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,233
and although only three of the 
recommendations are being put in place 

1117
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:21,883
immediately,
the rest will follow into a course and 

1118
00:59:24,081 --> 00:59:26,390
there's no reason to think that they 
won't be done aggressively.

1119
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:27,920
And uh,
and was forced.

1120
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:34,330
Alright.
Well I guess,

1121
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,450
do you guys have anything else to say?
I mean,

1122
00:59:37,451 --> 00:59:42,010
maybe thank you to the people who've 
already been paying attention and

1123
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:42,581
well,
let's,

1124
00:59:42,581 --> 00:59:46,510
let's just thank the people who have 
gone ahead already and,

1125
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,530
and contacted their benchers contact 
with the law society to,

1126
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:53,360
to register their objection to ask 
questions.

1127
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:57,230
A lot of people have done a very good 
things on and,

1128
00:59:57,290 --> 00:59:59,850
and our thinking well about this.
They,

1129
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:02,900
they're thinking intelligently.
They're thinking broadly.

1130
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,720
They the lie.
My hat's off to them.

1131
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:06,613
There are a great number of people who,
who are very clear about this and some 

1132
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:13,183
are reticent to make too much of a fuss.
Some are quite happy to say what they 

1133
01:00:18,231 --> 01:00:20,690
think and I respect both of those 
positions.

1134
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:21,831
Um,
but,

1135
01:00:21,831 --> 01:00:22,664
but I guess the message overall is there
are a great many people who think this 

1136
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:27,103
and the,
that the worst outcome would be that 

1137
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:34,190
nobody acts upon what they think.
And this just sort of happens without us

1138
01:00:34,191 --> 01:00:34,980
noticing.

1139
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:35,813
I've been heartened by the but by what I
see to be singular acts of courage in 

1140
01:00:39,331 --> 01:00:43,320
the people that have taken action 
written to the law society and even just

1141
01:00:43,321 --> 01:00:45,930
reaching out to,
to my office and to others.

1142
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:48,080
It's not easy to do.
And,

1143
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:48,931
and I,
you know,

1144
01:00:48,931 --> 01:00:51,720
I support and,
and commend those that are doing that

1145
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:53,903
and people have written,
people have written articles and blog 

1146
01:00:57,211 --> 01:00:58,044
posts.
There are some really excellent pieces 

1147
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:03,120
of work on this topic and perhaps we 
could even refer,

1148
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:04,890
um,
uh,

1149
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,550
provide links to some of those sources.
But,

1150
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:08,250
but,
uh,

1151
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:11,790
they're really worth a read a reading.
They're very well done,

1152
01:01:11,791 --> 01:01:14,370
very thoughtful pieces and they have a 
ring of truth to them

1153
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:15,793
from all over to them from outside.
I've seen things from outside the 

1154
01:01:17,961 --> 01:01:18,880
jurisdiction.
I'll,

1155
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,900
I think New Zealand,
there's a great,

1156
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:25,500
great blog by a professor at university 
of auckland in New Zealand who's written

1157
01:01:25,501 --> 01:01:26,150
on this.
It's,

1158
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:27,360
it's,
it's well worth the read.

1159
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:28,091
Yeah.
Well,

1160
01:01:28,091 --> 01:01:28,924
these things do have international 
significance because my observation has 

1161
01:01:31,931 --> 01:01:32,764
been that if one major jurisdiction or 
organization in the west moves forward 

1162
01:01:38,801 --> 01:01:41,260
in this hypothetically progressive 
direction,

1163
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:42,483
the probability that it will spread 
because of rapid electronic 

1164
01:01:45,791 --> 01:01:46,624
communication and pretty decent 
organization on the part of the people 

1165
01:01:49,181 --> 01:01:51,010
who do push these things forward,
that it,

1166
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,760
that it emerges everywhere with 
extraordinary,

1167
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:59,820
extraordinary rapidity.
So anyone who shares the basIc axioms of

1168
01:02:01,051 --> 01:02:05,160
our legal system is,
is involved in this whether they like it

1169
01:02:05,161 --> 01:02:05,994
or not.

1170
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:08,253
Right.

1171
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:13,040
All right,
well I guess we'll see what happens

1172
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:17,870
and maybe will provide an update again 
in a couple of weeks.
